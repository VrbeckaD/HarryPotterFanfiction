    <p>
  <span>Hermione wasn’t sure if her throat was swollen because of the screaming or the dust.   She may have fallen asleep. She may have been close to falling asleep. Through the musty air, the smell of adrenaline mixed with sweat made an uncomfortably familiar background.  The lumpy cushions pressed into her sore muscles and she trained her eyes on Ron’s chest, rising and falling, and willfully ignored the shadows, shifting in the periphery. It didn’t matter why she was choking.  It didn’t matter</span>
  <em>
    <span> that</span>
  </em>
  <span> she was choking.  They were breathing.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry hadn’t moved, but Ron might be awake.  He had gone quiet some time ago when the hour of the night necessitated some feigned attempt at sleep, but he rustled in a fitful way that made her doubtful he was resting.  She wondered if she should say something, and drew her breath as he rolled to face her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey there you.” His voice was thick, low. She saw concern register in his sunken eyes, still blue in the dark.  Her face must be doing something. She closed her eyes and reset it manually. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I might have been sleeping.  Did you rest any?” He grunted noncommittally.    “So much for beauty sleep.” She mustered a small, pinched smile.  He stared down his nose solemnly at her.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re beautiful.”  His fingers were inches from hers.  Her throat constricted further. Ron’s expression was entirely too serious.  She was accustomed to his face appearing as it did, slightly off due to newly mended injuries. It was the straight line of his mouth, his teeth set together as he watched her in the dark, that looked wrong now.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m terrified.”  She stopped holding her expression and it did, whatever it did.  He threaded his fingers through hers all at once and squeezed. She squeezed back, angry at how much the flutter in her stomach felt raw in the back of her throat and reminded her of fear and bile.  She wanted to roll off of the ridiculously uncomfortable cushions and into his arms. She didn’t care about the way he smelled or she smelled or any of the unspoken rules about how this inevitable thing was supposed to happen.  There were only so many safe places in the world left. But Harry was breathing steadily, sweating, needing them. He was missing this moment.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you think he has a plan?”  Ron averted his eyes, rolling them to the ceiling so he didn’t have to look at her while she processed the unspoken part.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>And what do we do if he doesn’t?  </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And she didn’t know.  She had spent so much energy, so much of herself, cramming every potentially useful thing into a bag, no matter how remote the possibility of its utility  Hermione had told herself that this was the best effort she could have made towards planning. But this was not an abstract scenario and she wasn’t sure where the right things for it could be found.   She ran her thumb along the calluses on his palm and bent her head to his, coming just to edge of her cushions. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He blinked at her slowly, considering her silence.  His free hand fiddled with the zipper of his sleeping bag.  His jaw was softer. She could hear her own heart beating in her ears and feel it gathering in the rasp of in throat.   She started to lean. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Not without him.”  She winced. He looked determined, hurt.  Three small words and he’d managed to summarize the situation entirely.  She loved and hated him for putting his finger so squarely on it and for being the one to say it out loud.  His fingers fluttered in hers. He smoothed the blanket around her.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re a better person than I am.”  He had turned his head and they watched Harry together.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“In no universe is that true.”  She knew he really believed that and it scared her.  She knew the kind of things that wandered around in her head, the things she never ever said, and maybe never even let herself think all the way through.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>This is impossible.  We’re going to die. And fuck everyone for making this our fault.  </span>
  </em>
  <span>And fuck Ron for looking at her like that, refusing to see that part of her that was angry, that wanted to escape.  Fuck him for waiting for her to tell him what to do. And fuck Harry for sleeping there, so broken. Fuck him when he work up and joined Ron in the waiting to be told.  And the worst part was that she knew she wasn’t a monster. She just couldn’t let herself drown in that sea of righteous anger. There was so, so fucking much of it to go around.  It wouldn’t save the world. Or maybe it would.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But not today.  Her bones hurt. He insides felt grimy with exhaustion and she wanted so much to feel normal.  But not even this was normal. Two breathing, gorgeous, bruised up people were beside her. And they were probably going to die for each other.  It was just fact. You had to acknowledge it without paying too much attention to it. It wasn’t going to save the world. Or maybe it would. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Jesus, and if they died, what if the never got around to it?  What if there was another night like this and then another and the moments just passed because it was never quite right and no one wanted to be the first to say, and then all hell broke loose.  Everything was terrifyingly out of control already. And hell had not yet broken loose. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She didn’t give him the option.  She kissed him all at once, surging forward and pulling herself on top of him. She ground her hips hard.  “Ron.” He moaned into her ear, not quite kissing her back, his hands gripped her around the middle, squeezing almost too tight.  “Please, just a little bit.” It wasn’t her imagination, he was hardening as she slowly rocked her hips. Of course he was. It felt fantastic.  Their raw nerves were so close to the surface. She was vibrating in his arms. She just wanted to push through the way it made her ache and feel the explosion on the other side.  And they would feel so guilty later. They would throw it on the pile with everything else. They would make it right later. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, it wasn’t going to take very long.  Everything snapped loose in a sharp kind of way. She would have pulled back because it was so intense, it kept happening, it felt completely foreign.  She wondered what would happen next. He was pulled her down again, harder, and again, each time relentlessly pushing against her hard enough to chafe through their favorite pajamas.  She had packed them on top. Should she waste any topical potions on this tomorrow? It didn’t matter. She met him, kissing him hard as it finally subsided. He was pulling at her, rocking her hips back and forth over the soft flannel of his pants.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She had come against Ron and he was in the process of bringing himself off against her.  Fucking lucidity. It had ruined this too soon.  They were going to die for eachother. They would make it right later.  She whispered this as Ron pulled his forehead to her and came as silently as she had. She whispered it again.  He kissed her on the mouth. Merlin, but she loved him. He fell asleep holding her hand.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She told herself she would try to sleep, that it was okay if it didn’t happen.  It ached. And she just didn’t know who to be angry with anymore. </span>
