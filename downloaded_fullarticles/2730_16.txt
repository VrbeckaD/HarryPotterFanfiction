He stood before the massive family tapestry, his father’s hands heavy on his shoulders as he reminded his son of all who came before him and the things they had achieved. Of the generations of Slytherins, masters in dark arts, cutthroat and cunning, reaching the top of their fields wherever they deigned to work.</p><p>He followed with his eyes the twisting branches of the tree, more interested in animals that danced below it than in the deeds by those upon it. That tapestry was so large it stretched across most of the drawing room, where Sirius was only allowed during lessons or by his father’s command. He was educated in the ways of pure blood supremacy and the art of giving orders, but it was the scorch marks burned into the fabric that stayed with him the most. Nevertheless, he learned quickly the punishment for curiosity of those black marks at the end of the drawing room’s fire poker.</p><p>Rather than becoming discouraged about being curious, Sirius became more careful and secretive in his curiosity. Covering his trail with intricately woven lies about his whereabouts and what he was reading. The approval it garnered granted him more freedom, which he used to sneak out of the house and meet children he never otherwise would have been allowed around. It quickly planted the seed of mistrust in his parents words and ideas, but left him unsure what that really meant.</p><p>All his father ever spoke of was Slytherin; he hadn’t even known there were other houses until his new books arrived after receiving his letter to Hogwarts. Late at night, when the rest of the house was fast asleep, Sirius would pull out his copy of <em> Hogwarts: a History </em>and read in wonder about the options that awaited him.</p><p>He read about brave Gryffindor, swathed in crimson red and gold. Of the daring deeds of the students there and the chivalry of their namesake. He read about kind and loyal Hufflepuff, and the hard workers therewithin, understanding immediately why his father had never mentioned them before…  Ravenclaw’s eagle swooped across the pages, making Sirius envious of its freedom. He tapped the side of his face idly, skimming over the values of intelligence, creativity, and learning. He considered himself to be smart enough, but it wasn’t his top priority.</p><p>Sighing, he finally reached the twisting snake of Slytherin and the familiar green and silver. Ambitious, cunning, resourceful. It certainly took cunning and resourcefulness to avoid his parents and sneak out, to meet the friends he’d made in secret. And he had been told time and time again how ambitious the Blacks were. Sirius knew nothing of how Hogwarts decided where you belonged, but he doubted Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff would have him, and afterall, everyone in his family had been in Slytherin. With one last look of longing at the pacing lion of Gryffindor, he closed his book and stored it in his trunk.</p><p>Standing on the platform of 9 ¾ Sirius couldn’t focus on a single word his parents were saying. Last instructions of protocol and expectations went in one ear and out the other, and he would have been surprised he hadn’t been slapped yet if he hadn’t been too busy looking at all the different people and colours and owls in cages. Trunks of all sizes and shapes, some old some very new, were just as varied as the witches and wizards around him.</p><p>His mother grabbed him by the arm, pulling him hard against her and pinching the inside of his tender skin. He bit down on his lip to keep from yelping, listening as she hissed in his ear that he better not let them down and to stay with Bella on the train. Dropping her grip on him, she turned to join her husband in instructing their niece on their expectations of her for their heir, but Sirius didn’t stick around to hear it. His trunk had already been loaded so all that stood in his way of freedom was quietly slipping away and melting into the crowd.</p><p>The halls of the train were even more crammed than the platform had been, with bodies pressing into one another in way Sirius had never before experienced and was easily overwhelmed by. Between the yelling students, hooting owls, and meowing cats, he wasn’t sure whether he wanted to hide from the noise or contribute to it, just because he could.</p><p>Sirius knew that Bella would be in a car near the front, with other pure bloods who considered themselves practically royalty among their peers, so he turned toward the back. He was nearly at the last car when he found an empty compartment, slipping in and shutting the door behind him with a breath of relief. It was very cool being around other people, but all of the brushes against him and being <em> touched </em> when he wasn’t used to it had left him trembling. He couldn’t seem to stop, so he sat in the corner closest to the window and drew his legs up on the seat with him, wrapping his arms around them.</p><p><em> Breathe in, breathe out. </em>He pictured his favourite piano song in his mind and breathed with the twelve beat pattern, calming himself down until he no longer trembled. He was sufficiently calm and looking out the window at the green landscape rushing past when the door opened again. In the doorway stood a boy who must have also been a first year, as he seemed a bit younger than Sirius himself.</p><p>“Mind if I join you?”</p><p>He shook his head no, waving his hand toward the empty seat across from him. The boys plopped down and held out his hand.</p><p>“James Potter.”</p><p>“Sirius Black,” he replied, taking the hand in his own.</p><p>James eyed him with curiosity, his head cocked to the side in question. “Why aren’t you up front with the rest of your lot?”</p><p>“I’m supposed to be, but snuck off before ole’ Bella could trap me.”</p><p>The boy grinned wide at that, “nice!”</p><p>When the trolley came by they both bought all kinds of snacks, piling them up between them. They passed the time playing exploding snaps and throwing Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans into each other’s mouths, and were just starting to get bored when an older student with an important looking badge pinned primly to his chest informed them they should change into their uniforms, as they would be arriving shortly.</p><p>Both shrugged into their dress shirts and robes, devoid of ties or identifying colour like the students outside their compartment all had.</p><p>“What house do you figure you’ll be in?” he asked James curiously.</p><p>“Gryffindor, I hope!”</p><p>“You hope, so you don’t know?”</p><p>“Who really knows until they tell you?”</p><p>“Who is they?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know. They. At the school I guess.”</p><p>Sirius huffed, frustrated that he still don’t know much about this whole house thing. Not long ago he thought <em> everyone </em> was a Slytherin and now he knew that wasn’t true, but had no idea how to go about NOT being a Slytherin! He was running out of time.</p><p>“Yes, but how do they <em> decide </em>?”</p><p>“Dunno!” James exclaimed, biting the head off a chocolate frog and talking through a mouth full of gooey chocolate, causing Sirius to cringe. “It’s a big secret, couldn’t get my mum and da to tell me. Even tried a fast-unto-death like Gandhi! But I just got scolded for being petulant and disrespectful to his memory. Well, and hungry. I also got hungry. So, that didn’t work.”</p><p>Sirius chewed on his lip thoughtfully, kicking his feet against the wood of his seat. “Wonder if I could convince them to <em> not </em> put me in Slytherin.”</p><p>James looked thoughtful, watching Sirius with more interest than most 11-year-olds spared for anything outside of Quidditch and sweets. “I bet we could, mate. If they try to, I’ll fight em off for you! You’re not a snake.”</p><p>Soothed by James’ conviction, he relaxed and gazed out the window, for the first time daring to believe he could be something other than what his parents had said he was.</p>
