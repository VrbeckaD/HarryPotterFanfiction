    <p align="center"><strong>Chrysanthemum</strong><br/> <strong> Chapter One :: Lily</strong><br/> <strong> (The flower most commonly associated with funeral services as they symbolize the innocence that has been restored to the soul of the departed. The white lily expresses majesty and purity, where as white stargazer lilies specifically symbolize sympathy.)</strong></p><p>Â </p><p>Falling through time was an odd experience, even for Azalea Dorea Potter-West - a witch who had thought she had experienced everything life had to throw at her. But, in a way, it wasn't truly life throwing her for a loop for once; apparently she could blame her latest Goddamnit moment on Death of all entities.</p><p><em>Rude</em>.</p><p>And Wally had been dragged in right alongside her.</p><p>Well, at least there was one silver lining about the whole broohaha they had found themselves in, because it seemed the personification of the end of all things really wanted them to see something, because it was tugging them all over the time stream, and honestly? Azalea was starting to get real tired of Death's shit.</p><p>Scowling at the golden void around her, Azalea placed her hands on her hips in a move that would have cowed her children and made her husband pause, and glowered. "Alright Death, what do you want?"</p><p>A dry chuckle resounded around the husband and wife pair, "As impatient as always, my Mistress."</p><p>Azalea clicked her tongue, "Yes, well, you took my husband and I from our home. Nearly scared said husband to death. And you've been dragging us through time and space. I think you're stalling."</p><p>"Death?" Wally shot her a look that seemed to be asking her if she were crazy. "Something you were planning on mentioning, Honey?"</p><p>Azalea fought down a slight wince, "Something I didn't know how to put into words for you... How do you tell someone you're the legendary Master of Death?"</p><p>"We'll be having words when we get home." Wally sighed, but didn't push furthed. "But really? Sassing Death?"</p><p>Really, Wally. Her darling husband needed to learn that she needed to be firm with immortal beings, otherwise they would think they could get away with everything.</p><p>Death chuckled again, and their boring golden surroundings pulsed and reformed.</p><p>Malfoy Manor.</p><p>Azalea shivered slightly, eyeing the extravagant decor around her that brought back memories of torture and Hermione's screams. Her hand twitched for her wand on instinct, and her foci cuffs flared in time with her nervous magic, before relaxing when Wally's larger hand slipped around her own.</p><p>The shadows around them twisted, gathering together as they rose from the ground, writhing as they melded together to form a humanoid shape. And then the darkness seeped away, leaving the two humans to stare at a mirror image.</p><p>The form Death had chosen was that of its Mistress; identical in everything but the eyes that were crimson instead of green, and the lacey black gown.</p><p>"Nice dress." Azalea offered dryly, and Death grinned fluttering it's eyelashes at her.</p><p>"Thank you, Mistress." It brushed a delicate hand gently across the embroidered waist of the dress. "I must say, your form is very comfortable."</p><p>Azalea hummed, studying the personification. "Maybe I should cut my hair again."</p><p>"I am <em>so</em> weirded out right now." Wally whispered, voice strained.</p><p>Death smiled coyly at Azalea's redheaded husband, and Azalea herself quirked a grin.</p><p>"So, Death. Why did you kidnap us?" The witch asked, turning her eyes back to the immortal being. "We <em>do</em> have a life, D."</p><p>"You will not if you do not listen to my warnings, Mistress." Death's smile melted away and Azalea found herself pinned with hard red eyes, and Azalea straightened.</p><p>"What do you mean, Death?" Azalea's voice was harder, much more serious than the one she usually used; the voice she had used to lead and inspire a student army into battle and to victory.</p><p>The voice of the leader she tried to pretend she wasn't.</p><p>Death's head tilted, and it looked almost proud as it studied her. "Follow me." Death turned and swept down the hall, leaving Azalea and Wally to exchange a look before following after it. "Welcome to Malfoy Manor, December 1997."</p><p>"I recognized the tacky decorating." Azalea drawled, "Not something one easily forgets - even if most of my time here was spent in the dungeons." Wally released a displeased grumble at the mention of her torturers, and the dark-haired witch offered him a small smile.</p><p>Death hummed, "What happened on this day was not something within my area of expertise." It continued, coming to a halt in front of a thick door. "The bringing of a new life." It shot them a small glance before melting through the wall as if it didn't exist.</p><p>"A <em>baby</em>?" Wally said flatly, and Azalea shrugged, gently tugging her husband into the room after the personification of death.</p><p>The scene they came apon was frozen, like someone had paused a movie. A woman with wild dark hair, and a gaunt face that could have once been beautiful contorted in pain lay in the bed before them, bent partially over her distended stomach.</p><p>Azalea recognized her immediately.</p><p>The woman who murdered her godfather.</p><p>"Bellatrix Lestrange."</p><p>Wally let out a slow hiss of breath; he recognized the name from the story of Sirius Black's murder, a death that still weighed heavily on Azalea's mind and one that she had tearfully told him when telling him of the man who could and should have raised her.</p><p>Death nodded, "The life that Bellatrix Lestrange brought into your world in 1997 would forever be painted with death - an echo of what could have happened to you, Mistress. An orphan who would lose her parents young, raised with cruelty and hatred." Azalea stiffened, "However, where you were born to a loving couple who did not deserve to meet me the way they did, Bellatrix Lestrange and Tom Riddle cared not for the precious life they had brought into the world, and were fated to suffer after death when they turned down the path they did."</p><p>Bellatrix and Riddle had had a child.</p><p>"<em>Shit</em>."</p><p>"Indeed." Death agreed, "You were both expected to be great, but for different reasons. Where you became a hero, this child became a villain."</p><p>"Damn." Wally muttered quietly.</p><p>"Just as you became the opposite of Tom Riddle, his daughter became the opposite of you." Death continued. "And if she succeeds in her goals, the End will come for all life on Earth."</p><p>"I knew it had been too quiet this year." Wally complained lightly, but Azalea knew her husband well enough to know he was trying to bring light to the dark conversation. "No one had tried to destroy the Earth yet."</p><p>Azalea cracked a small grin, then turned back to her mirror image. "What does she want?"</p><p>Death frowned heavily, red eyes sliding back to the frozen image of Bellatrix Lestrange, it's face serious and it's lips twisted in disgust.</p><p>"To control Death."</p>
