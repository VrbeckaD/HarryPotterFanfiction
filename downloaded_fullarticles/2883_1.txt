    <p>The short black haired werewolf sat alone on the ledge that overlooked a small city that he once called home he knew that he had no place there not anymore. Not after what happened to him just over five years ago when he was on a camping trip, he remembers that day perfectly and each night it haunted his dreams.</p>
<p>His glossy black orbs looked down as if he was reliving his past, with his step-father that once loved him before he turned into a monster. If his mother was alive would she have thrown him out? Would she have disowned him? Would she have stopped his step-father in throwing him out? The questions swirled around in his head. He knew that he had been thinking about it a few times over the last couple of months but, he was always so curious if she would have put a stop to it.  </p>
<p>His step-father was a complicated man he was a politician for the Magical Congress. Even though a high amount of people were supportive of werewolves and believed that they had a place in the Wizarding Community he didn't think that they belong in it. His step-father had taken it upon himself to try to make a new law where all of the half-breeds were sent away to Azkaban for life just because they were different than most wizards. </p>
<p>"Samuel," the brown furred wolf heard the feminine voice in his head. At first, he had no idea who it was and lowered himself to get into the attack mode ready to pounce. </p>
<p>However, he rose when he saw a snow white-furred wolf walking towards him. Their piercing sea-green eyes stared into him like it was trying to figure something out. To most people, the wolf looked beautiful but, to Samuel, it was another story entirely.  "Samuel," the feminine voice invaded his mind once again a bit more eager.   Samuel quickly shook his head and spoke. </p>
<p>"What do you want Elizabeth!" Samuel snapped in her head. The young wolf looked offended but let out a sigh sort of knowing that she interrupted his thoughts. "You need to come back Johnathan is asking for you. It sounds like it is urgent." Elizabeth slightly on edge on how he would react. Samuel nodded his dog-like head and, he took off running towards the camp. Unknowing what is about to happen is going to change his life forever.</p>
