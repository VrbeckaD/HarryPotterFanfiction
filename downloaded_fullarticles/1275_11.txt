    <p>Minister Granger had been waiting for this bill to go through the Wizengamot for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
When she was planning on leaving the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, she had been anxious to know that someone capable would be able to take the reins. There was much to be done in that department, and while Hermione had done a considerable amount to advocate for the rights of specific creatures, she always had a terrible anxiety that whomever stepped in as the head of that department might make the policies even more regressive than they already were. And it had been that way for a time. Until Minister Granger stepped into this role. Now, she had the pleasure of hearing her longtime acquaintance deliver one of the most impassioned speeches that she had ever heard delivered to the Wizengamot. Penelope Clearwater had not seemed like the natural fit to Hermione to take over as the Head of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. While she and Penelope had stayed in touch after the Basilisk incident, Penelope seemed to be on a different track. A typical Ravenclaw, Hermione would have pegged Clearwater as the kind of student who immediately went into graduate school. Whereas Hermione had been the best at almost everything, Clearwater had a true talent for Transfiguration. It would have been easy to see her as the next McGonagall. Hermione had always appreciated her conjuring. There was something so beautifully fearless about it. With a soft smile, she remembered another time when she had witnessed that ferocity.<br/>
<br/>
After Hogwarts, they hadn’t kept in contact. It was only until, much later, when she had gotten a tip-off about some Occamy eggs that were being sold in an illegal deal near the Black Forest that their paths crossed again. Imagine her surprise when she apparated to the edge of the forest and found none other than Penelope Clearwater with her wand at the throat of the man Hermione had never seen before, with an Occamy egg in her hand.<br/>
<br/>
Later, Clearwater would explain that, in a roundabout way, it was the Basilisk attack that had piqued her interest in the care of magical creatures. Over a firewhiskey or two, she related to Hermione that she used to wake up to nightmares where Hermione had been petrified by the snake but Penelope hadn’t. And then the snake with its red eyes bore down on her.<br/>
<br/>
She had been terrified, she admitted, to get close to any magical creature again. And then Hagrid introduced her to a small dragon he had just hatched. (Hermione had bolted upright in her chair. Hagrid had promised them that there were to be no more dragons after Norbert. Then she laughed and shook her head. <em>Of course there wasn’t just one</em>, Hermione chuckled to herself.) Clearwater’s eyes got a far-off look in them when she told Hermione about how the small dragon had flown into her hand, curled up like a dog in the center of her palm, licked her thumb, and went to sleep. Hermione could just imagine Hagrid’s choked up voice as he told Penelope she would never have anything to fear from a creature if she treated them with the respect that they deserved. After that, Penelope spent every day that she could with Hagrid and the dragon until Hagrid released it in its native home.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s probably the gentlest Hungarian Horntail that’s ever lived,” Penelope said with a laugh, shaking her blonde curls. Hermione straightened up again. <em>I really must get it through to Hagrid that not every creature is friendly</em>, she thought, thinking of Aragog. After Hogwarts, Penelope had wandered, trying to locate as many magical creatures for herself as she could. She was inspired by Newt Scamander, she said. When she said this, Hermione considered her carefully over her glass of firewhiskey. “Then why don’t you follow his footsteps and join our department?”<br/>
<br/>
Clearwater looked shocked for a moment. “Is that an official offer?” She’d joked.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione shrugged. “It’s not my place to offer anything official. But the department head does owe me a favor or two.” As she drained her glass of firewhiskey, she did not mention exactly for what or how many salacious photos of him she had found of him engaging in some extremely flagrant acts while dressed as a niffler.<br/>
<br/>
Clearwater had been instated within the month. Then, when Hermione stepped into the position of Minister, she had immediately used her influence to promote Clearwater. She and Minister Granger had worked assiduously for months on this bill. If Hermione had still been the person she had been at Hogwarts, she might have ghostwritten this bill herself. But she wasn’t. And, besides, she didn’t have the time to.<br/>
<br/>
Clearwater was getting to the moment that Granger was the most nervous about. Hermione slid the nail of her thumb into her mouth and clamped it between her teeth but did not chew. Her shoulders were tense as Clearwater launched into her final proposal.<br/>
<br/>
“I move to have the following stipulations instated onto the werewolf registry of 1965. As you have seen from the bill in front of you, I am proposing today that all persons who have had the misfortune of having been infected with the disease have equal rights to their undiseased counterparts.This means that all persons who have been infected with the disease have equal access to job opportunities, housing, hospital treatment, and any other natural rights which are their ethical rights as self-autonomous beings. To do otherwise would be to unjustly infringe upon their rights as magical beings and take away their rightful dignity. And to remind the Wizengamot,” and here her bright blue eyes swept the court, “we are all magical beings. Unlike most magical beings, we have the strongest voice and the most power. As such, we must advocate for the voiceless and the powerless and must then reinstate those natural rights that they deserve.”<br/>
<br/>
<em>Yes</em>, Hermione thought, biting down on the nail, though not hard enough to go through, <em>though it might be too little too late for some</em>. A wave of sadness went through her as she remembered a particular friend. Clearwater’s voice stirred her out of her reverie. “I move for a vote that this particular group of voiceless and powerless magical beings be given the respect that they have deserved ever since this registry was put into effect.”<br/>
<br/>
Minister Granger folded her arms over each other on the desk in front of her. “I second this vote. Those in favor –” She lifted her own arm and scanned the room, looking over her rimless reading glasses. Her usual allies were quick to shoot up their hands. She locked eyes with Harry, and shot the smallest smile briefly at Ronald, before continuing to scan the room. She was slightly shocked when Malfoy’s hand lifted. She watched as his knee jerked into Parkinson, and she, with a sigh, lifted her own pale hand. Minister Granger quirked an eyebrow and continued to scan the room. The rest of the former Death Eaters did not oblige her with a hand. When she had finished surveying the room, her aide, Cordelia, squeaked the tally in her ear. She gave the merest hint of a nod. “And those against?” Her eyes flicked around the room again. Now the latter crowd lifted their hands. <em>So, she thought, you will happily join with Fenrir Greyback when it suits you most but you would deny him his basic rights? Why am I not surprised...</em><br/>
<br/>
Inexplicably, she glanced back at Malfoy. His face seemed to communicate the same thought, just with a disgusted twist of the mouth. He looked down at the page in front of him and scribbled something. If Granger were to consider him for a moment, Malfoy had been surprising her of late. He had been voting contrary to what she had presumed his beliefs were. Perhaps that Greengrass woman is better for him that I had assumed, she thought. Lady Malfoy, as she reminded herself.<br/>
“The ayes have it,” she said with a soft smile.</p><p><br/>
A general cheer broke out, much to the displeasure of the former Death Eaters.</p><p><br/>
Minister Granger connected eyes with Clearwater, beamed at her, and clapped in her honor. A surge of pride went through her. It was quickly followed by relief. <em>We’ve done something good today,</em> she thought to herself, <em>and we should be proud</em>.</p><p>At the break, after congratulating Penelope profusely, instead of mingling solely with Harry or catching up with Ronald about the children, Hermione surprised herself by walking up to Malfoy. She reached out her hand.</p><p><br/>
“Malfoy,” she said with a smile.</p><p><br/>
“Minister Granger,” he replied, holding her hand and bowing his head over it.</p><p><br/>
<em>Oh</em>, she thought, with a malicious internal grin, <em>If my thirteen year old self could see me now</em>. And then she frowned. She had always been able to read Malfoy, even when they were at the height of their animosity in school. His face looked more ferrity than ever. His face was extremely pale and pinched. He had huge dark circles ringing his eyes. She had heard the rumors about his son, Scorpius, though she had never believed them. It had taken her one meeting with Scorpius to know that he was entirely Malfoy’s son. Scorpius looked almost exactly like his father, except for his mouth. He had inherited the curved lips of a woman. She remembered thinking it was an unfortunate feature for an eleven year old boy and she felt a pang go through her when she thought, <em>I hope he doesn’t get teased too harshly for it</em>. Maybe when he was eighteen he would understand the benefits of this feature. But no adolescent boy wants to be singled out for anything.</p><p><br/>
Six months after seeing Scorpius with his mother and father at Platform 9 ¾, she and Harry were chatting in her office after having finished an official debriefing. “Oh,” Harry had said, with a laugh, smoothing back a long forelock that had fallen from his bun. “Albus wrote to us the other day. It seems he has made a close friend in that Malfoy kid.” Hermione, who was rarely surprised, lifted her brows slightly at this. “Did he,” she said in a bemused voice. “Well, I hope it is a relief for them both.”</p><p>Harry absentmindedly scratched his beard. “What’re you getting at?”</p><p><br/>
She smiled back into his frown. “Harry, has it never occurred to you that Malfoy wanted more than anything to be your friend?”</p><p><br/>
“Of course,” he said, still frowning, “but I knew he was not someone I could trust.”</p><p><br/>
She looked off at her bookcase in the corner, as if she were remembering something.</p><p><br/>
“Sometimes I wonder,” she said, “what Malfoy would have been like if his father weren’t such a heinously bigoted and overbearing father.”</p><p>“Mm,” Harry was giving her a look.</p><p><br/>
She sighed. “As you probably know, father-son relationships are...challenging. As are mother-daughter relationships,” she said, thinking of her most recent clash with Rose over a particularly bright shade of Muggle eyeshadow. “I sometimes wonder...if we had given Malfoy a chance all those years ago...would he still have made the same decisions?”</p><p><br/>
Harry gave her a hard stare. “It doesn’t matter, Hermione.” His tone was flat and direct. “He made his choices and so did we. We can’t change the past.”</p><p><br/>
Now it was her turn to give him a humored look out of the corner of her eyes.</p><p><br/>
“Can’t we?” She replied with a smile.</p><p><br/>
He rolled his eyes, realizing the trap he had put himself in. “We can. But I don’t believe Malfoy deserves that chance.”</p><p><br/>
She laughed softly and picked up her quill. “He may surprise you yet, Harry.” There was a silence as Harry refused to look up at her, his brows contracted as he mulled over some internal thought. “Anyway, this is all to say that I am happy that Albus has a friend. We need as many of those as we can get.” Her eyes twinkled as she smiled at him.</p><p><br/>
Harry laughed. “Is your cold, English heart finally melting then?”</p><p><br/>
“Nev-ah,” she said in her swottiest accent.</p><p><br/>
“Well!” he exclaimed, pushing himself from the chair, “I must do some work. I’m told I have a whole department of people to oversee?”</p><p><br/>
She gave him a very serious look, “That you do, Auror Potter, that you do.”</p><p><br/>
He looked at her with a fond, far off look. “Who would’ve thought it, huh?”</p><p><br/>
She half-smiled at him again. “Now whose cold, English heart is melting?”</p><p><br/>
He laughed and rapped the doorway with his knuckles.</p><p><br/>
“Until next time, Minister.” He winked at her and then was gone. She smiled and shook her head to herself, still charmed by her oldest friend.</p><p> </p><p>Now, standing in front of Malfoy, her own words came back to her as she looked at him.</p><p><br/>
“Are you quite well, Draco?” She asked, the briefest hint of gentleness edging into her voice.</p><p><br/>
He flinched a little at this and looked at her with a a fleeting look of guilt. “Quite,” he said sternly.</p><p><br/>
She did not believe him in the slightest but shot him her most comforting smile. “I’ve heard from Harry that your son and his are getting along famously in their time together at Hogwarts.”</p><p><br/>
Draco’s shoulders relaxed their tension a little. “It seems to be that way, yes.” His brow furrowed and his lips tensed into a straight line. “I was rather shocked that a Potter child would deign to be sorted into Slytherin. What a blow for the heir of Gryffindor.”</p><p><br/>
She knew he was trying to get a rise out of her. She laughed and looked away but she still kept her back straight. He always had a gift at making her feel spectacularly awkward for no reason. She could begin to feel her childhood self rise up in her shouting: <em>This is the one who said the worst things about you! How dare you stand here and chatter with him?!</em> But she was no longer a child. Besides, she had long ago learned the value of becoming friends with her old enemies.</p><p><br/>
“I have long thought that Slytherin and Gryffindor were cut of the same cloth,” she said, looking back at him with a warm smile she did not entirely feel. “After all, loyalty is foremost to our nature. It is the thing we would sacrifice the most for – loyalty to our friends, to our families…” She looked at him from the corners of her eyes. “I’m sure we would both do anything for our respective children.” Another flinch went through his body and he looked suddenly at the floor. She smiled more warmly at him. “The only difference is that it manifests differently for each of us.”</p><p><br/>
He looked back into her face. For a split second, the ghost of a smile went across his face before it was lost in pain. “Astoria used to say that, too.” His voice was suddenly rougher and he cleared it with a cough.</p><p><br/>
“Ah,” she said out loud, remembering with a sudden flash. Her aide had told her that at a certain point. She could remember that her head had been bent over the many bills that needed her signature when Cordelia had slid a card in front of her face saying, “<em>Lady Astoria Malfoy died due to complications regarding a blood curse. Could you please sign this condolence card, Minister?</em>” She hadn’t given it a second thought – though neither had she made it particularly personable. “<em>Many condolences for your loss</em>,” it had been signed, in Cordelia’s hand. “Did she?” Hermione finished quickly, hoping Draco had not recognized that Hermione had forgotten.</p><p><br/>
His eyes slid up to hers and his eyebrow quirked. He had not missed it then. <em>Merlin’s beard</em>, she thought, feeling slightly ashamed but not letting it show on her face.<br/>
He nodded and looked down quickly at his feet. “She was a remarkable woman,” he said quietly. “I would be a completely different person if not for her. A much worse one, too, I’d reckon.” His head tilted up, revealing that his mouth was quirked up in a regretful half-smile. “I’d still be the most selfish person you’d ever met.”</p><p><br/>
With that she let out a real laugh. “Don’t flatter yourself, Malfoy. Cormic McLaggen still has miles on you in that respect.”</p><p><br/>
He laughed drily and gave her a rare smile. “I’m sure you are correct once again, Minister.” In a sudden shift, his voice went back to being smooth and distant. “And to what do I owe the pleasure of the Minister’s speaking with me today?”</p><p><br/>
It was her turn to cock an eyebrow and laugh drily. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see Ronald giving her a dark look. She didn’t bother to acknowledge him. “The Minister merely wishes to extend her thanks to Lord Malfoy for assisting the passing of this monumental and historical vote today.” Well, if he was going to be so pompous to make everything they said be stilted and formal then she would best him at his game. For better or for worse, she was still the young witch who couldn’t resist a challenge. She extended her hand and he took it. She gave him a warm yet firm handshake. “Please do inform your charming son that, if he were to ever wish to visit his friend during the winter holidays, my husband and I hold an annual Christmas party to which the entire Potter clan is invited. You both would be warmly welcomed should you choose to join in the festivities.” Again, she gave him a politely warm smile as he gave her a stunned look in return. “Good day to you, Lord Malfoy.”</p><p><br/>
“Good day, Minister Granger,” he mumbled.</p><p><br/>
When she went over to Ronald, he gave her the politest peck on the cheek and, when she slid next to him, he whispered, “Merlin’s beard. What the devil was that all about then?”</p><p><br/>
She cut her eyes at him and mock sighed. “Oh, Roonil Wazlib. You would not even begin to understand."</p><p><br/>
He looked slightly hurt but she did not care. She had managed and trodden on and tipped toed around his feelings for thirty years. In the spot where she knew she should care for how he felt – that endless tendril that reached out from her to him had long since died. She just could not care enough any more. Still, she could not help but feel a small thrill of fear, though, when Ron’s hand came up to her shoulder and squeezed her a little too hard through the fabric as they both laughed at a joke Harry had made. She felt a heavy lump of foreboding in the bottom of her stomach, though she laughed it off. As she did, her smile felt too tight and a wave of nausea coursed through her. She could not make herself look up at her husband. </p>
