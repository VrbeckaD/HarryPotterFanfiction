</p><p>He is pulling weeds in the garden when he first hears a hissing voice.<b><em>"Stupid humans, thinking they can trap me and feed me poisoned mice!" </em></b>Boy looks around, trying to see where the voice is coming from. He looks down and sees a beautiful snake. The snake is covered in shining black scales and has crimson red eyes. It is thin, beautiful and only about a foot long. He stares at the snake curiously, wondering if he actually just heard a snake talk. <b><em>“But I escaped! As I knew I would.” </em></b>the snake hastily continues as though the mere thought of not having managed to escape a human is demeaning. <b><em>“They can't keep me from hunting outside. Filthy humans.” </em></b>his eyes widen in surprise. He's understanding a snakes hissing. First, it was owls. Then the owl named Hedwig decided to bond with him now he can understand snakes. So far he hasn’t met any other creatures or animals. Would the snake want to bond with him as well? The snake then appears to notice him and begins to glare at him as it hisses. <b><em>"Another stupid human!? No not a human… but not a wizard either. Maybe I should bite this one since he interrupted my hunt! Might as well kill him while I'm at it. He’s probably going to try and put me in a cage too!”</em></b></p><p>He quickly holds his hands up and tries to explain himself; <b> <em>"Please don't bite or kill me! I mean you no harm and I'm sorry for interrupting your hunt! I was just thinking about bonding with you, I swear!"</em> </b> <b> <em><br/> </em> </b> Now the snake is staring at him shocked. It’s silent for a few moments before it excitedly says, <b> <em>"A speaker!! I have never met a speaker before! The last speaker that was born is my mother's master! You will be my master now. I will protect you, speaker!"</em> </b> The snake quickly nips his finger. Boy shifts as he takes on the traits of the snake and the snake takes on some of his traits and extended lifespan in turn. After the light glow of the bond, settling finishes the snake continues on excitedly. <b> <em>“You speak the snake tongue young hatching. No humans can speak the snake tongue! There is only one other alive on this land that snakes know of who speaks the snake tongue. He is a wizard. You have magic. You must be his hatching.”</em> </b></p><p><b> <em>“You know of my parents? My family before I came here?” </em> </b> he says happy and excited. <b> <em> “Do you know my name?” </em> </b> he asks hopefully. <b></b> <em>“The family I live with don't seem to know it.”</em></p><p>The snake seems surprised for a second before replying carefully.<b> <em> "I do not know your name young hatchling. I am called Alexis. My mother says it means to defend and help. I earned my name by guarding and helping my siblings as a hatchling.”</em> </b></p><p><b> <em>“Oh, what do you think my name will be?” </em> </b>he asks curiously.</p><p>
  <b> <em>"I am not certain however I suspect that is not how it works for your kind master… I do know only very rare wizards can speak the snake tongue! Wizards that are descended from Salazar Slytherin! He was the last of his family. It's a very special gift! My mothers master’s name is Tom- well he goes by Voldemort now. He has been the only other speaker alive for many generations, so you must be his hatchling!"</em> </b>
</p><p>The boy gapes at the snake. He’s known for years that he doesn't have a name so the knowledge that this new familiar doesn't know it doesn't bother him too much. Now he can't help but smile. Salazar Slytherin?! His second idol to the Dark Lord Voldemort. His owl familiar Hedwig has spent the past year educating him about the world of magic and the subsequent war going on there. In the beginning, she was only partial to wizards who gave her food, treats, shelter or water. After he began deciding his allegiances she began to side with him. <b> <em>"You mean that I'm a descendant of one of the greatest wizards to ever live and potentially related to the second greatest wizard? Are you sure?"</em>  </b>Alexis hisses a few elevating and falling notes which he quickly realizes is laughter. He frowns before realizing Alexis is not laughing at him. Hope blooms in his chest at the thought of having someone other than Hedwig to share his happiness with.</p><p><b><em>"Of course! You must share ancestry! Only pure-blooded wizard descendants of Salazar Slytherin can be speakers. Others without his ancestors or without magic can't speak the snake tongue. Salazar Slytherin was a great friend to serpents especially the Basilisk’s who are Kings and Queens of serpents. I am a Basilisk. You are my master now, I will stay with you forever to protect you. We will find your family hatchling."</em> </b><br/> His mind is going a million miles a minute. He is related to Salazar Slytherin and potentially the Dark Lord Voldemort! That means he might have another family out there! He is brimming with happiness at the mere thought.</p><p><b><em>"My mother's master was a very powerful Wizard.” </em></b>Alexis the Basilisk continues proudly once he has his attention again. <b><em>“One of the most powerful in the world! He led the dark side in the war before he disappeared seven years ago. The light side says that seven years ago he was defeated and killed by an infant hatchling. But the dark side does not think that's what happened because that is nonsense. Completely implausible. I have personally heard rumors from the light and the dark sides that the light side lied about his death. But I do not know for certain what happened to him. I know he is alive because I can still feel my mothers bond with me and should he die she will too. Just as should you die now I will too."</em></b></p><p>The boy sits back and remembers what Hedwig told him about the war going on in the world of magic. Apparently, for three hundred years the light side has ruled the Wizarding world in Britain. Eventually, they suppressed the dark wizards and made laws so that the dark wizards can't practice dark magic in public without going to a large cage called Azkaban. When he turns 11 and begins school at Hogwarts this will become a problem because his magical core is dark. The light side believes that all dark magic is evil, and shouldn't be practiced. Yet according to Hedwig, they have no cause or reason to believe this. They also believe that wizards should live in harmony with muggles and muggleborns. Something he is personally adamantly against.</p><p>The dark side wants to be able to practice their dark magic freely, and they want to separate the magical world from the muggles. After all muggles are dangerous. Historically they have feared, tortured and killed witches and wizards. They have done anything they can to destroy the world of magic when they find out about it. The dark side wants to take all wizards out of muggle homes, and either moves them into magical orphanages or put them in Wizarding homes. After all like with the Dursleys muggles often abuse their families. In the world of magic, the gods and goddesses strip you of your magic if you ever lay a hand on a child or hurt a child in any way.</p><p>All in all most muggles are heartless and cruel and if too many of them even a group of say 100 muggles learned about magic again they can easily destroy the Wizarding world also known as the World of Magic. Salazar Slytherin fought for these ideas and Voldemort is still fighting. According to Hedwig, the leader light side an Albus Dumbledore is the headmaster of Hogwarts, the chief Wizengamot as well as the minister advisory. Albus Dumbledore is the one making all the decisions for all of the wizarding United Kingdom and has been doing so for the past 300 years.</p><p>Again Hedwig's words come to him ‘Emotions are what fuel dark magic. Light magic is about clinical and detached intelligence. Dark magic is the original magic and its connection to Lady magic, the planets, and existence itself. In comparison light magic is easy. Dark magic needs more strength to practice than Light magic, otherwise, the witch or wizard can lose control. There are many dark spells, curses, jinxes, charms, and hexes that are meant to hurt people. In the same manner, there are many light spells, curses, jinx, charms, and hexes that are meant to hurt people. Overall, magic is not evil. There are just different types and desired intents. You can be dark, grey, or light for example. The dark side fought against the light because the light are ignorant and the dark wanted to be able to practice their magic freely.’</p><p>Before he was just biding his time, training his magic to hide more aptly, waiting until it was time to leave for Hogwarts. Now he's wondering of more possibilities. He can already feel his time here with the Dursleys drawing to a closer end. Maybe someday he can meet his family. Maybe someday he can meet The Dark Lord Voldemort. He wants to read about Salazar Slytherin and see his portrait in the Hogwarts castle. Hedwig says they are sediment in the world of magic. Just as he begins imagining the possibilities, Miss Petunia calls from inside. "BOY GET IN THE HOUSE AND MAKE DINNER!!"</p><p>His happiness dims slightly. He looks down at his new familiar and apologizes.<b><em>“Miss Petunia is calling for me to come and cook dinner. I have to go."</em>  </b>His new familiar then leaps under Dudley’s hand me down baggy shirt and wraps himself around his waist so he can't be seen by Miss Petunia.</p><p>The snake is angry as he hisses, <b> <em>"My master cooks dinner for the humans?! That is not acceptable! My master should not have to cook for anyone! I am coming with you. You are my master and I shall not leave you. I will be training you to harness your magic master. Soon you will be strong enough to leave this strange large cage we have found ourselves in."</em>  </b>Harry smiles happily at the Basilisk’s reply. Hedwig had a said basically the same thing. Harry then dashes into the house to cook dinner for the Dursleys.</p>
