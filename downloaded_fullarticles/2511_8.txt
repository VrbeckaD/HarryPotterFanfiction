    <p>The distant chimes of Big Ben echoed through the empty streets of London. A slight fog was laying over the city while the snow was slowly falling from the dark night sky.</p><p>A smile crept over Harry Potters face, as he approached the door of the Leaky Cauldron in the west end of London. Harry enjoyed his time in the muggle world, simply because his life there was a far more silent then the circus caused by him simply entering a small store in the Diagon Alley, which happened quite often since he first stepped foot into this magical world.</p><p>But this wasn't all. He also chooses to simply destroy one of the most powerful wizards of all time, not once, not twice or even three times. No, of course, he had to destroy him four times. Once as a Baby, which was the root of all his fame, then twice in his first two years at Hogwarts, which wasn't known to a lot of people, thankfully, and of course in his seventh year, which he used to track down the Horcruxes of said dark wizard to set an end to the thread he was to the world.</p><p>Only two years later Harry had signed his first professional Quidditch contract, with only one of the biggest English Quidditch clubs, as the star seeker. Adding to his wealth and to his dismay to his fame amongst wizards and witches all across the globe. Harry was now, three years later, at the end of his first contract with the English side Puddlemere United and had won his last game against the Heidelberg Harriers, in the European competition, with a stunning 330 to 110.</p><p>Now with the offseason and him without a contract he had no training and no worries. For the first time in three years, Harry could relax knowing that he wouldn't have to get up and start training within the next few hours. In order to celebrate this, he chooses, instead of being at home all day, to go out and have some fun and maybe even have a drink or two. With that in mind, he set out for the only bar in London where he could be himself and not having to hide behind the false claim of being a muggle.</p><p>As he entered the Leaky Cauldron, he noticed how cold it actually was outside, as a flood wave of heated air was streaming past him into the night.</p><p>He had hoped that he could slip through to a little table far of the public eye, but this hope was squandered as a female voice yelled: "Hey, Isn't that Harry Potter?!". Within seconds he was surrounded by about twenty different wizards and witches who wanted him to sign a picture of him on a broom in the Puddlemere kit, introduce themselves or just straight up hug him.</p><p>Harry put on his best smile, even though he would have loved to just sit down and drink a beer or something with alcohol to soothe his nerves.</p><p>To escape the large crowd of wizards he, after signing, greeting and being hugged by about five witches, went and entered the rather empty Diagon Alley.</p>
