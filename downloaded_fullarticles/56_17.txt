    <p>“Severus, both you and I know that you have difficulties sleeping,” Dumbledore stated. The man across from him shot him an irritated look.</p><p><br/>
“And you won’t let me take care of it myself anymore? I know what I’m doing, Albus. Let me be.”</p><p><br/>
“Normally, I would. However, with Voldemort’s return and the added stress, I want to ensure that you at least are sleeping well enough that you can handle whatever he throws at you.”</p><p><br/>
Snape’s face froze slightly at the mention of Voldemort. “I can handle it,” he muttered, his eyes flickering from Dumbledore’s gaze.</p><p><br/>
“I’m certain you can, but I would still like you to try this. Help out an old man who wants to help you.”</p><p><br/>
Something twisted in Snape’s eyes, and Dumbledore witnessed the fight leave Snape’s body. The quick submission alarmed Dumbledore. He had never met anyone more stubborn than a well-rested Snape. Reaffirmed in his decision, Dumbledore took a sip of tea.</p><p><br/>
“There is someone else who has struggled with nightmares and insomnia. I believe that letting you both sleep in the same bed would alleviate some of the affects and help both of you garner a few more hours of rest. If you are unhappy with the arrangement after two weeks, then you may stop. Until then, every night should be spent together.”</p><p><br/>
“Fine,” Severus hissed after a minute of contemplation, “I’ll give you your two weeks. But don’t expect anything more.”</p><p><br/>
“That’s all I’m asking, my dear boy.”</p><p><br/>
“Who is it?” Snape’s voice curled over the room, and Dumbledore felt his heart sink.</p><p><br/>
“Severus, before you get defensive, understand that the other person has already agreed to this. And I warned him that if he wrongs you in any way, I will ensure that the punishment is swift.”</p><p><br/>
“Who is it?” Snape repeated, his voice hardening. Dumbledore ran a hand through his beard.</p><p><br/>
“None other than Sirius Black, my dear boy.”</p><p><br/>
At times like these, Dumbledore was always impressed by how well Snape maintained control of his emotions. The only movement that signified his anger of shock was the slight pressing of his lips while his eyes remained stony and unreadable.</p><p><br/>
“No,” Snape put out bluntly. He moved to stand up. “This conversation is over.”</p><p><br/>
“Sit down,” Dumbledore ordered in his no-nonsense voice. Snape sat down. “I understand your hesitation, but understand this, this is something I need you to do. I will not allow Voldemort to take advantage of you because your mind is too sluggish after only an hour of sleep. I will not allow it.”</p><p><br/>
“So give me some sleeping potions, if you so worried,” Snape snarled. Dumbledore shook his head.</p><p><br/>
“And find you in a few months addicted and dependent? No. You agreed to the two weeks, and so it will happen. You don’t have to talk to him, you don’t even have to look at him, but I want both of you sleeping in the same bed. Consider me a fool if you’d like.”</p><p><br/>
“So you’re going to force me to do this then?” A darkness had overcome Snape’s face. “No wonder I don’t get any sleep, with two masters,” his tongue curling viciously around the word, “ordering me around.” Snape’s hands clenched the arms of the chair, his knuckles turning white. Dumbledore regarded him sadly. The poor man was suffering, and it was entirely Dumbledore’s fault.</p><p><br/>
“Please, Severus.”</p><p><br/>
Snape sat silently for a minute, his breathing ragged. “Fine!” he suddenly shouted. “Fine.” His shoulders shuddered for a moment. Dumbledore wished he could comfort him but now wasn’t the time. Instead, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, silver necklace. The pendant showed a moon, and he handed it to Snape. Snape looked at it in disgust.</p><p><br/>
“It’s a portkey to Sirius’ room. Take hold the pendant and think of him, and you’ll be immediately transported to his quarters. I would like you to start tonight.” Severus stood up and twisted the necklace in his hand. He stared at Dumbledore for a moment, his expression unreadable. Dumbledore hoped he wasn’t making a severe mistake, but his gut told him otherwise. Whatever would happen would work itself out to help both of his broken boys. It would be hard at first, but he was certain it would end beneficially. All they had to do was work out thirty plus years of resentment and hatred towards each other.</p><p><br/>
Before Snape reached the door, he lifted the necklace around his neck and clasped it shut. He quickly tucked it under his shirt. Without looking back at Dumbledore, he quickly left the room.</p><p><br/>
Dumbledore sighed. “Well, that could have gone a lot worse.” Fawkes cawed in agreement.</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
Severus Snape wanted to be angry. He wanted to be livid over what Dumbledore had forced him into, furious over the fact that he had agreed to share a bed with Sirius Black. He wanted to rush back into Dumbledore’s office and object to his ludicrous idea. He wanted to do all of this, he knew he should do all of this, but he was just so…tired.</p><p><br/>
Exhaustion padded his mind, acting like a heavy anchor sinking into his subconscious. He couldn’t remember the last time he had slept well. Certainly before the Dark Lord’s return, but then the days started to blur.</p><p><br/>
It wasn’t like he didn’t want to sleep. He really did. Those few hours of blackness and oblivion felt like salvation from the clattering in his head. Memories would dissipate and pain would fade, until, of course, the nightmares jerked him awake and left him more scared and agonized than before. Events would be replayed in his mind with startling vividness. The blood seemed bloodier, the corpses seemed colder, and the pain always cut deep and hard. It took him a while to recover, but once he did, any hope for more sleep was dashed. He felt lucky if he got more than a few hours.</p><p><br/>
That was, of course, if he could fall asleep at all. And usually, he couldn’t.</p><p><br/>
Maybe Dumbledore had a point. Maybe the crazy old man actually had stumbled upon some realization that would finally let him sleep. Or maybe the crazy old man was just a crazy old man intent on wreaking havoc in Severus’s life.</p><p><br/>
He didn’t know. He didn’t care. He needed to sleep.</p><p><br/>
But he couldn’t. Not tonight. The Dark Lord would surely call with pain that snaked up Severus’s arm, and he never slept when the Dark Lord called.</p><p><br/>
With a few hours remaining until nightfall, Severus stumbled to his room. He warily regarded the bed before turning to his cauldron. The Dark Lord had requested Mille Poenarum Noctibus, a fiendishly tricky concoction. It would take Severus the next few hours to finish the potion, and by then the Dark Lord would call.</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
Sirius Black stared at the clock. The clock stared back at him.</p><p><br/>
Sirius Black stared harder at the clock. The clock simply ticked along.</p><p><br/>
Sirius sighed, leaning back into the bed. It approached one o’clock and the greasy git had yet to show up. Dumbledore had assured Sirius that Snape had agreed, but now it looked like the man had bailed. Fucking coward, Sirius thought, turning around in bed. Sleep rarely came to him, but it didn’t stop him from trying. Every night, he would lie down and engage in a staring match with the clock, but nothing ever happened. He was stuck watching the clock, waiting for sleep that rarely came.</p><p><br/>
And now neither would Snape. Sirius shut his eyes. Sure, he wasn’t happy that Dumbledore’s choice was Snape. He hated that man, hated him since the moment he met him and would probably hate him until he died. It was just the way it was. So spending two weeks in bed with him wasn’t ideal. But so was not ever falling asleep, so Sirius was caught in a bind.</p><p><br/>
With great reluctance, Sirius had agreed to Dumbledore’s conditions. In two weeks, it would probably all be over anyway, so in his classic what the hell moments, Sirius just went for it. Of course, the man wouldn’t even be bothered to show up.</p><p><br/>
Sirius sat up in bed. He wanted a glass of water, but just as he was standing up, a thump reverberated through the room.</p><p><br/>
“Fuck,” he exclaimed, startled by the sudden figure standing in front of him. “Well, it took you long enough,” he muttered.</p><p><br/>
Snape just nodded. Sirius rolled his eyes and lay back down. “So we going to do this or not?”</p><p><br/>
No response.</p><p><br/>
“For fuck’s sake, you can talk to me.”</p><p><br/>
No response except for the sound of shuffling across the wooden floor. The bed dipped suddenly, and Sirius felt Snape lie down.</p><p><br/>
Sirius chuckled. “Well it looks like I finally got you into my bed.”</p><p><br/>
No response. No whipping insult. No angry comeback. Nothing.</p><p><br/>
Sirius sat up again, turned on the light, and looked over at Snape. “Shit,” he muttered, gazing at the man. Snape’s eyes were clenched tight, his lips a nearly invisible line, and worst of all, tremors wracked his hands. His chest rose and fell quickly, disrupted by haggard breaths. Sirius lifted a hand and pressed softly against Snape’s forehead. It wasn’t hot, so it couldn’t be a fever. Snape muttered something.</p><p><br/>
“Huh?” Sirius leaned in closer.</p><p><br/>
“Cruciatus,” Snape said again, his teeth clicking together on the last syllable. “Should…be…ov…over…in…thirty…thirty…minutes.”</p><p><br/>
Sirius sat back and stared at his sworn enemy reduced to a shuddering mess. It wasn’t right seeing Snape like this. Snape was cool and unflappable. He was controlled. Now, he seemed like none of that. He looked like a man in pain.</p><p><br/>
Cursing Dumbledore, Sirius laid down again. Snape was going to hate him for this, but Sirius didn’t know what else to do. He had little experience in dealing with the cruciatus curse, and none with helping Snape, but when he was little, Regulus often fell sick. To comfort his brother, Sirius would lie next to him and wrap his arms around Regulus's quivering and fevered frame. Then, he would hold on until the episode passed and Regulus stilled.</p><p><br/>
Repulsed at what he was about to do, Sirius scooted closer to Snape. His whole body shook with the aftermaths of the curse. Sirius reached out and lay an arm across Snape’s chest. He pulled himself against Snape’s tremoring form and lay his head down. He wanted to gag, but he felt Snape relax against him. Some of the tension eased from Snape’s body. His breathing had evened just a tiny bit. Whatever Sirius had done had helped.</p><p><br/>
Wrapped around Snape, Sirius lay there. The tremors slowly subsided and Snape’s breath evened out. Sirius could sense every movement of Snape’s, casting away their privacy. He eventually lost track of time. His head fell against Snape’s shoulder, and his arm rose and fell with every one of Snape’s breaths. He didn’t say anything, and neither did Snape. They just lay there together as a deep silence obscured the room.</p><p><br/>
At one point, Sirius shut his eyes. He could hear Snape’s heart pulsing, a monotonous pounding that filled Sirius’s consciousness.</p><p><br/>
When he opened his eyes, the heartbeat was gone. His head lay on nothing but a pillow. The spot next to him was empty except for a faint warmth. Sirius sat up slowly, blinking away the sleep from his eyes.</p><p><br/>
He sat like that for a moment before he realized his action. He was blinking away sleep! Sleep, the fickle mistresses that had abandoned him, had returned in the night. He had slept, and with a quick glance at the clock, he had slept for six hours! He wouldn’t even get six hours on a good night. This was cause for celebration! He should crack open the fire whiskey, and oh shit.</p><p><br/>
Sirius stilled. A gnawing feeling entered his gut. He put his head in his hand. He listed off some expletives. Of fucking course Dumbledore was right. Of fucking course, it had to be Snape. The only thing that could get him to sleep had to be that slimy Slytherin. He groaned and pulled at his hair. That slimy Slytherin had also suffered last night. He had been cruciatioed extensively because one go at the cruse wouldn’t leave someone a shaking mess. It had to be Voldemort.<br/>
Sighing, Sirius stood up. He had all day to mull it over. And then he had a night to (hopefully) sleep it over in the fucking arms of Severus Snape.</p><p><br/>
For now, he would spend his time cursing Dumbledore.</p>
<hr/><p>Hi all! This story is a fun passion project I've had for a while, and I decided I might as well post it. I have a lot more of it written, but I can't make any promises about update speed. Regardless, I'll do my best and I hope you enjoy. </p><p> </p>
