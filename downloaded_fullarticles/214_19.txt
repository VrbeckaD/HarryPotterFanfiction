    <p>On the fated morning of November second, Petunia Dursley opened the door to pick up the new bottles of milk and leave the old, empty ones from the week before.</p><p>But what her eyes met instead of fresh bottles of milk, was instead a small basket with a baby inside. There was a letter attached to the handle. It read ‘For Petunia Evans’.</p><p>The handwriting, she knew that handwriting. It was the same handwriting that told her how she couldn’t go to Hogwarts, like her sister. The same handwriting that haunted her after all these years of being left behind by her own sister. And then, her blue eyes met Lily’s.</p><p>But it wasn’t Lily, no. It was the baby’s eyes, her niece’s.</p><p>Petunia choked down a wet sob as she quickly picked up the baby and the letter, forgetting about the empty, bottles of milk. She quickly entered the house and rushed to warm the small body in her arms.</p><p>Petunia didn’t notice the burning eyes of an owl. Neither did she notice how quickly it flew away, into the distance.</p><p>“Oh, God.” the woman whispered, safe in the four walls of her home. “Lily, Lily, what do I do?”</p><p>Petunia grew up knowing about magic. Grew up on the shadow of her sister. She knew all about magic, about their laws and their do’s and don'ts. So, what did it mean to have Harriet Lillian Potter in her arms?</p><p>Petunia didn’t allow herself to mourn over her sister, nor about her other nephew. She had another baby to take care of, another mouth to feed and another soul to cherish.</p><p>“Let’s get you warm, hm?” Petunia whispered at Lily’s daughter.</p><p>She received a toothless grin, and Petunia suddenly remembered how Lily used to grin at her this way when they were toddlers. God, how did it burn, her heartache. She settled the letter aside, giving Harriet her full attention.</p><p>Petunia took off the blankets and the strange robe the baby wore and changed her diapers. Then, she dressed her into one of the baby onesies Sister Marge had gifted her on the baby shower. Petunia was suddenly glad she had put off Dudley’s gender until the last minute, now she had enough clothes for both her son and her niece.</p><p>“Dudley, this is Harriet.” Petunia whispered to the asleep form of her son, “She is your sister now.”</p><p>Petunia laid Harriet next to Dudley, in the baby crib that was big enough to fit both babies. Petunia turned away, checking on the baby monitor before leaving the room. She had a few calls to make.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Vernon Dursley had a growing migraine since the morning of November first. He had seen multiple of owls flying around and many shady looking people whispering about some kind of Hitler vanishing.</p><p>The man grumbled to himself, this couldn’t get any worse, could it?</p><p>“... The Potters…” he heard as he turned a corner to get into the Grunnings building.</p><p>He froze, reaching subtly to his pick up recording watch. Vernon feigned looking at the time as he blasted on full power the recording cog on his watch. His earphone subtly vibrated as it powered on.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “... James Potter, vanished You-Know-Who. The Saviour, the Boy Who Lived.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Such shame for Harriet, no one knows where she is.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Ah, probably dead. Like Lily and James Snr. Potter.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Vernon squashed down the bile rising to his throat and continued his way to his office. Turning off the recorder and powering off the connection of his watch. He started to think of ways to break the news to his wife before anyone else.</p><p>Vernon made his way into the building, the big letters reading ‘GRUNNINGS’ right on top of it signed that he was on the right building.</p><p>“Mornin’, Boss.” a dark haired male saluted as they crossed paths. Vernon grunted a greeting as the male made himself scarce after greeting each other.</p><p>“Boss, I have the reports of London.” a young looking woman approached him as they walked towards the elevator. “Also, good morning sir.”</p><p>Vernon nodded at Alisa as he gestured her to continue on about the reports. The brunette woman continued.</p><p>He blanked out five seconds into the report.</p><p>“... Kyle was having an orgy with me and Gerald last week. And…” Alisa babbled, making Vernon snap out of it.</p><p>“Wait, what?” he turned to look at her. Vernon internally winced at the scorching glare Alisa sent him.</p><p>“I was checking, <em> sir, </em> to see if you were listening.” she sniffed haughtily as the doors opened on their floor. “Clearly, you were not.”</p><p>Vernon slightly groaned under his breath as he allowed his personal assistant to reprimand him as they walked towards his office. There were some workers fluttering around, some of them sent him sympathetic glances when they saw Alisa next to him.</p><p>Vernon was sure that their sector of the organization would crumble without her iron grip on the management department.</p><p>“Alisa, I just got the news of my brother and sister in law’s death. I’m not in the mood.” Vernon said, fed up with Alisa. He started unlocking the door of his office. Vernon heard Alisa’s sharp intake of breath, “I don’t know anything about my nephew and niece, so…”</p><p>Alisa backed off, “Sorry Boss. Want me to clear your schedule so that you can spend the day with your wife?”</p><p>Vernon mulled over his options, “Do I have any important meetings today?”</p><p>“<em> Blood over Work, </em> Boss.” Alisa straightened herself, “That’s what you taught me the first day of my initiation, that’s what I’m telling you today.”</p><p>Vernon allowed himself to smirk slightly at his protegé.</p><p>“Very well, call me if this shitstorm goes up in flames.” he locked the door of his office. “Don’t forget to make sure everything is running smooth, and please, don’t fuck with the interns.”</p><p>Vernon internally gagged at the thought.</p><p>“Will do,” Alisa said over her shoulder as they parted ways. She sent a wink to one of the new interns.</p><p>Vernon sighed at his PA before turning on his heel and left the top floor.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Vernon didn’t waste any time as soon as he was out the building, reaching his car and pulling out of the parking lot.</p><p>His phone started to ring, the caller’s name flashing brightly.</p><p>“Honey?” Vernon answered the call.</p><p>“Vernon,” Petunia’s wobbly voice reached his ears.</p><p>“I’m already on the way back home, darling.” Vernon reassured Petunia, “Whatever you do, do not leave the house.”</p><p>Petunia sniffed on the other side of the line, “We have to talk. Get home quickly. Be safe.”</p><p>“You too,” Vernon gruffed. “love you, Flower.”</p><p>“Love you, too.” Petunia managed a small laugh at the endearment. Vernon had started calling her that the first time they met. Five years later, the term ‘flower’ held more meaning than just a plant.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The tall, blonde woman looked over the room. It was strangely quiet when her son, Dudley, slept. She gingerly looked at the letter addressed to her. It was taunting her. She knew.</p><p>“Get a grip on yourself, Petunia.” she whispered.</p><p>Petunia, hesitantly, reached for the letter.</p><p>Twenty seconds later she was silently crying.</p><p><em>God, </em> Petunia thought, <em> Lily is… </em> was <em> twenty one. </em> She held back a whimper. Closing her eyes, she sent a prayer to her sister’s soul.</p><p>Petunia composed herself, firmly pursing her lips as she battled through the rest of the letter.</p><p><em> So, my nephew is alive and well. </em> She bitterly thought, <em> And what Dumbledore thought was right, was to discard my niece to me, in hopes that I would keep her safe if my nephew failed to meet his destiny? </em></p><p>Petunia’s hand was shaking.<em> Lily sacrificed her life, for this? For her children to be, what, pawns of a game? </em></p><p>“No.” Petunia whispered out loud, “You will not do what you did with me, Dumbledore. Lily’s daughter will grow up knowing who she is. What you did. And you’ll pay.”</p><p>“I’ll take care of you, Harriet.” Petunia vowed to her niece, “I’ll make sure you know everything you have to know about this world and your own.”</p><p>She faintly heard Vernon’s car approach their house. It was time for her past and present to meet once again.</p><p> </p>
