  <em> When you get lonely, call me </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Anytime at all and I’ll be there with you, always </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Anywhere at all! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Its a penny for your thoughts, quarter for the call </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And all of your momma’s love </em>

<li><em><em>The Wilkinsons</em></em></li>
</ul><p> </p><p>They had known for a while that this day was coming. Spent the last couple of weeks preparing for it.  Grimmauld was thoroughly gutted from the attic to the wardstones; little survived. What did, was either sentimental or useful. Sirius’ and Regulus’ rooms were combined into a memorial for The Marauders plus Lily and Tonks, as well as all the loved ones lost during both wars. Hermione insisted that the entire Black library be preserved, and expanded. The house was no longer a prison, but a home. Even if it still had fortress quality wards.</p><p>Andromeda opened her home to them, recommended contractors, and lent her magic to rebuild the Black Wards. Teaching them exactly what it means to be Lord Potter and Lady Black, the responsibilities the titles held and the weight they carried.  She taught Harry how to change a nappy, showed Hermione the charms for temperature tracking. Gave them advice on parenting, her blessing for their upcoming marriage. She had even welcomed Crookshanks and his brood of half grown kneazle kittens with open arms.</p><p>The room was cozy, painted in warm colors and filled with overstuffed furniture. Despite that, Harry still felt cold. Teddy was curled into his neck sound asleep. His shoulder was going numb but Harry didn’t have the heart to move the sleeping baby. Teddy had fallen asleep in his grandmother's arms for the last time just ten minutes earlier.</p><p>In the five short months of his life, Teddy has lost so much. First his parents and now his grandmother. Harry stopped rocking and tightened his hold on his godson. No, on his <em> Son </em>. Edward “Teddy” Remus Lupin would grow up loved and knowing everything about his family. He will not be told that his father was a drunk, and his mother a freak. Nor will he ever question the love that his family has for him.</p><p>Hermione slipped into the room. The Black legacy was startling in its familiarity. Her eyes were no longer a deep brown, but a shade of honey touched with gold. Her hair had been tamed, no longer frizzy but perfect ringlets that ranged from reddish brown to the deepest black. In the last month of her life, Andromeda adopted Hermione in blood and magic. Teaching her everything there was to know about the Black legacy and what it meant to be one.</p><p>Harry may be Sirius’ heir- inheriting the Black fortune- but Hermione carried the Black magic. Together they would meld the Potter and Black magics through their children; one to carry the Potter name, one for Black, and one for Lupin.</p><p>Harry lifted his arm and Hermione snuggled into his side. Shoulders trembling she cried silently into his chest and looped one arm around his waist.  She laced her fingers with his on Teddy’s back.</p><p>“Won’t be much longer,” Hermione said with a shuddering breath, “She wanted to be alone in her final moments.”</p><p>“I don’t blame her. Death is easier when you know your loved ones are safe.” Harry kissed the top of her head and squeezed her side twice.</p><p>Hermione squeezed his hip twice in return. <em> Squeezy-squeezy means I love you. </em></p><p>“I’ll wake her portrait when we get home and start working on her funeral,” She placed a hand on Teddy’s back. “I know she has it planned right down to what kind of flowers she wants, but she wouldn’t let me look at the plans.”</p><p>Harry snorted, “She requested that I write a speech. Then she edited the speech until it was exactly how she wanted it. When I asked why she didn’t just write it for me, she tutted. Actually tutted and pet my head.”</p><p>She didn’t laugh, just chuckled lowly once. But his chest stopped constricting and her shoulders loosened a notch. So it would have to do.</p><p>Narcissa Malfoy breezed into the room with all the grace of a ballerina and the air of a rainstorm. Her makeup was flawless and body seemingly at ease. But her piercing grey eyes were red and watery. Draco, only a few steps behind his mother, slouched.</p><p>“Cousin, Potter.” He greeted them, neither friendly or unfriendly. Carefully neutral. It was the most he’d said to them all day. Having arrived shortly after 2 that afternoon to say goodbye and then following his mother on her quest to hassle the healers. Neither wanted to believe that there was nothing to be done. All the gold in the Malfoy vault was worthless in the face of Andromeda’s failing health.</p><p>Only the person who cast the curse could lift it and Hermione killed him just moments after Andromeda had been hit.</p><p>“Aunt Cissa, Cousin.” Hermione returned, voice no longer wavering. She had long since learned not to show weakness to sharks. Family they may be, but they fought on opposite sides of the war for too long, and been family not nearly long enough to be trusted. Maybe someday. But not four months out of the war. Definitely not in the face of losing her second mother.</p><p>Narcissa pursed her lips but said nothing. Only enveloping Hermione in a tight hug and nodding at Harry.</p><p>Teddy fussed and Harry switched him to his other shoulder. He was having a long nap, but neither Hermione or himself would sleep much anyway. Besides a sleeping baby was easier to handle than a wide awake and bored baby.</p><p>The five of them waited in near silence, broken only by Teddy grunting and shifting. What a sight they made. Two pinnacles of Pure-blood aristocracy with their hair perfectly coiffed and wearing casual-for-them robes. Next to two teens and a baby in comfortable muggle clothes. Despite the vast differences between them, they were together for the same reason and the atmosphere stayed loose.</p><p>It wasn’t a surprise. But when the Healer stepped into the room and merely shook her head, they crumpled. Andromeda was gone.</p><p>~oOo~</p><p>Winky and Kreacher met them in the entrance hall. Neither said a word just bowed their heads as the family of three headed into the lounge. Hermione laid Teddy down in his playpen. Against all odds, he had stayed asleep during their breakdown at St Mungo's and the trip through the floo.</p><p>Hermione tucked one leg beneath herself and curled into Andromeda’s favorite armchair; it was treacherously soft, in a green so dark it was almost black. And stared at a painting of a wolf pack. They were curled together next to their den, dozing while pups played nearby. The entire lounge was filled with paintings of a forest. Some featured a lake, others had deer and birds. All belonged to the same set and it was common for the pack to frequent them.</p><p>Each room had a theme. The lounge belonged to the wolves, the Sunroom had an African savannah, the Parlor had a jungle of colorful birds and so on. The hallways held pictures of family, friends, and familiars. Crookshanks’ little family took up a solid three feet of a wall next to the bathroom. Getting the kittens to pose for those photos had been a nightmare.</p><p>Harry was numb straight to the bone. A deep ache set in like during the Triwizard tournament. Only this time he couldn’t climb out of the lake and into a warm towel. So he stayed on the settee across from Hermione and watched her watch the wolves.</p><p>Hermione's eyes burned with tears that wouldn’t or couldn’t manifest. She felt like a nerve, raw and exposed. The weight of the Black legacy bore down on her. She was the Matriarch, protector, and foundation of the family, and her family was hurting.  Losing Andromeda was like losing a limb. Hermione could feel Draco’s sadness and Narcissa’s agony echoing through the family magic. She imagined on some level they could feel her sorrow as well. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath.</p><p>A tea service popped into place on the coffee table between the chair and settee. A plate of cucumber sandwiches followed. Harry played mum and poured them each a cuppa before placing two sandwich wedges on a smaller plate. Raising a brow he nudged the plate toward Hermione.</p><p>“You should eat. When was the last time either of us ate something? This morning, last night? I know we didn’t eat this afternoon.”</p><p>“Pretty sure I ended up eating more of Teddy’s smashed peas than he did.”</p><p>Harry chuckled, “I told you showing him how good they were wouldn’t work. He’s a smart one! Letting his mummy eat most of those nasty things.”</p><p>Hermione paused with her cup halfway to her mouth, furrowed her brow and stabbed a finger across the table. “Listen here! Just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean he shouldn’t. Vegetables are a fund-”</p><p>“I’m not saying they aren’t. But peas are the scum of the earth alright? Mixed in with stew or something where you can’t taste them is fine. But on their own?” Harry shrugged and tucked into a sandwich. “All I’ll say is I don't blame him.”</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she sipped the tea and sighed blissfully. Like always Harry got it right; perfect amounts of honey and cream. It’s the little things.</p><p>Stretching her legs out in front of herself, she placed the plate in her lap and nudged Harry’s foot under the table with her own. Twice. He met her gaze and returned the nudge, a grin teasing at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>“So carrots tomorrow?”.</p><p>“I suppose we could have introduced carrots today, but with everything going on…”</p><p>“Yeah. I get that,” and he did. Starting Teddy on mushy food had to be done carefully. Allergies were no joke.</p><p>As Hermione polished off the first of her sandwiches Harry let the tension ease out of his shoulders. Little steps; first she eats, then she wakes the portrait.</p><p>~oOo~</p><p>When she agreed to the adoption Hermione had no idea what exactly Family Magic meant. Oh, she read up on it of course, but theory and practise are not often good bedfellows. Experiencing it though… no amount of research could have prepared her: The sheer amount of love she felt from Andromeda upon waking after the ceremony. Feeling her mother’s magic twine around her own, weaving them together as the Black legacy settled.</p><p>Pieces clicked into place, not to make her whole. She was already an entire person. But to make her somehow more. She was Hermione Jean Black, the brightest witch of her age and every bit her mother’s daughter. Her biological parents, Helena and Richard might be lost to her forever but she was still their daughter. Just as she was Andromeda’s daughter. A sister to Nymphadora, and mother to Teddy.</p><p>Due to her age, not much was expected to change. She would become more powerful and some magics would come easier to her. The animagus transformation process for one, would be much easier to complete. However her form might lend itself to be a canid, and a magical one at that. Sirius had been a Grim, and once one magical form appears others tend to follow.</p><p>Her physical changes were as startling as they were welcome. The ringlets were wonderful, and the darker hair color flattered her. Her eyes took a bit of getting used to, cycling through shades of honey flecked with gold, but in the end, she loved them.</p><p>How she felt about people changed as well. Narcissa was her Aunt, Draco her cousin and magic would not let her file them into neutral enemies. Bellatrix was dead and Hermione had never been so happy about the loss of a family member before.</p><p>Hermione could feel the losses. Gaping holes in the bonds that ached to be filled. Nymphadora, Sirius, Regulus, Bellatrix. The generation that the magic was promised and had stolen instead. <em> Children </em> The magic demanded. <em> More children </em>. Rebuild the family from the ground up. Teddy helped: being a child of the Black line. But Hermione wondered if the emptiness within herself would only be filled once she birthed an heir. Yet another subject to talk to Harry about.</p><p>Because blurting out “Love, does your family magic demand children like the Gods of olde demanded sacrifices? No, just me then?” was a grand idea.</p><p>She wondered though if that was the case. Did it hound him his entire life? Or did it start on his birthday, when he put on the ring and accepted his place as Lord Potter? He hadn’t mentioned it before, but mayhap he was facing the same problem she was. How do you ask such a question.</p><p>Their betrothal was still new(the ring felt heavy on her finger even after a month), and asking about children would be a bit sudden. On the other hand though, they were already parents. Later. She would sit down and talk to him about it all. Just not tonight, and probably not tomorrow either.</p><p>Not once in seven years had the topic of children ever come up. Perhaps it was because her best mates were boys, or that school was all consuming, or maybe it was because they had been too busy fighting a war. Honestly it could be any or all of the aforementioned reasons. Did any of them even stop to <em> really </em> think about the future? About what they would do if they survived?</p><p>Year after year they faced off with voldemort in one form or another. The only year they didn’t was third. But an escaped Sirius Black was just as, if not more, stressful! At least they knew without a doubt that Voldemort wanted to kill them. Sirius was a wild card in a game of chess. Completely out of left field. At least it ended well. Harry needed a solid connection to his parents, and he found it in both Sirius and Remus. For a while anyway.</p><p>Heart heavy Hermione turned the last corner and paused. Carpeted stairs stretched before her ominously. At the top of them was the entrance to the Family Room. Dread curling in her belly, Hermione began to climb. The West wing(more like top floor) of Grimmauld was accessible to family only. As both The Lady Black and Lord Potter’s fiance, Hermione had unfettered access.</p><p>Andromeda’s Portrait sat above a quiet fireplace and stretched from wall to wall. It was a near copy of the Lounge. Her favorite chair and settee, the oak coffee table and additional wolf paintings. The difference was bookcases. Floor to painted ceiling was covered in glossy black shelves and filled with all of Andromeda's favorite books. Children’s story books, mysteries, romances. If she loved it in life, it followed her into death.</p><p>Witches and Wizards live extremely long lives. Growing up at the same pace as muggles but staying young far longer. Her mother was 44 and didn’t look a day over 30. Long ebony hair fell over her shoulders in waves, not a grey hair in sight. The only wrinkles she had were laugh lines that hinted at crows feet when she smiled. Her face was pale and completely at peace. An expression Hermione had never seen on her mother. Andromeda spent her last weeks in constant pain and unable to rest because of it.</p><p>Breathe in, count to three, breathe out. Repeat until calm.</p><p>“Mother,” Hermione placed her hand on the golden frame, “It’s time to wake up.”</p><p>Andromeda didn’t startle, she just opened her silver eyes and quirked her lips into a secret smile. Rising from the settee she displaced Sheera, a long hair tawny kitten, and Gretchen, a short-haired peach, grey and white kitten. Her favorites of Crookshanks litter.</p><p>“My sweet Song, how long?”</p><p>“A few hours. I-” Hermione swallowed around a sudden lump in her throat. Sweet Song was Andromeda’s pet name for her. It had started in the days before the adoption and carried on afterward. Her mother likened Hermione’s addition to the family to the song of a Phoenix, igniting hope that the Black family would emerge from its own ashes. Stronger and more powerful than ever before. “I couldn’t come in here right away.”</p><p>“Understandable,” Andromeda stepped closer to the portrait edge. “Had I the chance, I wouldn’t have been able to do it either. What’s the date and time?”</p><p>“September 10th, its after 9pm.”</p><p>Andromeda cocked her head and scooped up a mewling kitten, scratching her tawny ears. “Not returning to Hogwarts?”</p><p>“No. It wouldn’t be fair to Teddy so much has changed for him already. We’re going to sit our N.E.W.T.S in December though. Have to be good role models and all that.” Hermione sniffed and wiped her hands over her cheeks. “Besides I doubt I’d forgive myself if I didn’t.”</p><p>Andromeda lifted her chin and stared down her aristocratic nose. Pinning Hermione with the weight of her stare. “No, I don't believe you would. But my Song, you are already a fantastic role model. I am so proud of you. I wish we had more time together. Promise me that you will get family Portraits done. Nymphadora- I need one of my daughters with me. Please.”</p><p>“I will. Harry and I already talked about it. His parents didn’t have portraits and neither did Teddy’s. We will, our children and grandchildren will know us.” Hermione promised as she settled into a wingback chair. Feet aching she tucked them under herself and propped her head on her hand. It was late but she couldn’t drag herself away. Within minutes she was asleep.</p><p>Kreacher popped silently into the room and covered his new Mistress with a blanket. Snapping his fingers he resized the chair and slipped a pillow beneath Hermione's head. Turning to Andromeda he placed his right hand over his heart and bowed.</p><p>“It be a great loss losing you mistress. Rest well, Kreacher be taking care of the House Black.”</p><p>Andromeda only nodded in thanks. There were no words to describe the profound relief she felt. An Elf’s loyalty was nothing to scoff at. Kreature slipped away as she turned her attention to Hermione, and watched her sleep. She hoped that the next few days wouldn’t be too hard on her.</p><p>~oOo~</p>
