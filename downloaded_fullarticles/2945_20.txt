    <ul>
<li>He walked through the door of Grimmauld Place, his bag over his shoulder and his wand clutched in his hand more tightly than it usually was</li>
<li>He always found it eased his mind if made sure he was constantly on the defensive until after he was through the door</li>
<li>Once he was his body would relax</li>
<li>The tension partially falling away as he released his muscles for the first time in weeks</li>
<li>He sighed at the relief of his aching shoulders, his aging bones</li>
<li>But was suddenly overcome</li>
<li>A feeling of overwhelming weakness</li>
<li>The last four months had been a series of incessant transformations, blood lust and, of course, blood loss</li>
<li>He groaned as he walked through the house, his muscles cried out and his head throbbed</li>
<li>He just wanted to sleep</li>
<li>To have some peace before Sirius came home from his own mission later that evening</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>He had planned to be away for much longer than four months until his cover had been blown and Greyback had nearly ripped his jugular from his neck</li>
<li>He had run</li>
<li>And apparated almost immediately</li>
<li>Not daring to turn back even for a moment</li>
<li>He then spent the past few weeks in hiding</li>
<li>Choosing caves and dark forests over back alleys and sleazy shops</li>
<li>He didn’t want to show up somewhere that they would anticipate</li>
<li>He wanted to keep fellow members of the Order off Greyback’s trail</li>
<li>And now that he was finally, <em>finally</em>, okay to return home a weight had been lifted</li>
<li>The constant high from running from Greyback left him on edge </li>
<li>But for now he was .. the term safe didn’t feel normal to say anymore</li>
<li>Nonetheless the Death Eaters tailing him had returned to building Voldemort’s army</li>
<li>Thankfully he had gotten enough information in the short time he had been there</li>
<li>Maybe now they could put up a real fight against the Dark Lord this time</li>
<li>He pushed the thoughts from his head as he padded up the stairs into his room</li>
<li>He would find food and Mad-Eye later, right now he just needed to settle himself in and allow himself the pleasure of falling asleep in an actual bed</li>
<li>Maybe even into a dreamless slumber</li>
<li>He fell flat on the bed as soon as he approached it, he ignored his stomach which was rumbling loudly and allowed his eyelids to fall shut</li>
<li>He let himself fall into a stone cold sleep until a cold sweat started across his forehead and his mind jolted him back into reality</li>
<li>The night terrors after a mission often meant many sleepless nights</li>
<li>He had hoped being so worn out would offer him some peace but he was used to this by now</li>
<li>He glanced up at the clock beside his bed; it had been no more than an hour since his return, he groaned loudly</li>
<li>His stomach began its rumblings again and he sighed heavily as he pushed himself from the bed</li>
<li>He strode out of his room to find the kitchen, find something to quell the hunger pains, but as he swung open the door he was surprised to find Sirius</li>
<li>His eyes immediately narrowed on one of his oldest friends when he realized his head in his palms and his body was hunched over the counter</li>
<li>Remus kinked his eyebrow at the sight and spoke weakly</li>
<li>“Padfoot, you’re here”</li>
<li>The man’s head jolted up to see Remus, his eyes were wide and dark with red rims</li>
<li>He looked as though he had been awake for days, like he had been crying</li>
<li>Remus froze and his stomach lurched</li>
<li>“Rem-”</li>
<li>“What happened?”</li>
<li>They were the first words to escape Lupin’s lips as Sirius raised himself from the counter top and flattened his palms against it</li>
<li>Sirius looked back down, his mouth pursed and his eyes hard</li>
<li>He opened his mouth several times before he actually spoke</li>
<li>Remus’ anxiety heightening each time</li>
<li>“They knew. I don’t know how but, they knew”</li>
<li>Sirius’ fingers turned in towards to clutch against his palm</li>
<li>Remus could see him close his eyes as he spoke as if the memories of whatever events had occurred while he was away began swarming him</li>
<li>Remus kept his eyes fixated on him</li>
<li>“Is everyone okay?”</li>
<li>Sirius kept his eyes closed, “For the most part.”</li>
<li>Remus’ mind was racing a mile a minute so fast he could barely stop himself from asking all his questions</li>
<li>But he remained quiet</li>
<li>He had known the man long enough to know he had to let him take a few deep breaths before his eyes would flutter open and his words would come</li>
<li>The wait was agony but when Sirius finally stood straight, turned around to lean against the counter and crossed his arms over his chest, Remus’ ears perked up</li>
<li>“No one died”</li>
<li>Sirius eyed him gently</li>
<li>And Remus understood immediately who his glance was referring too and released a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding in</li>
<li>“Then what’s going on?”</li>
<li>Sirius looked at the fire that was crackling in the kitchen, his voice quiet and irritated</li>
<li>“Everything was going so smooth. Too smoothly honestly and I should have known. But I didn’t say anything and it got so fucked up so fast.”</li>
<li>Remus was clutching the door knob harshly; the sharp corners of the pristine crystal were cutting into his fingers but he couldn’t stop</li>
<li>The tension in his shoulders returned and his eyes were glaring now</li>
<li>He needed to know</li>
<li>“Bellatrix was practically on top of me before I even realized but Tonks …”</li>
<li>The air in Remus’ throat hitched at the name, his mind going to the worst possible scenario and the overwhelming guilt of the fight they had came rushing back to him</li>
<li>It was just before he left</li>
<li>She had leaned close to him</li>
<li>Her eyes closed, her breathing soft</li>
<li>“Come back to me”</li>
<li>Her hands gripped the opening of his jacket</li>
<li>And the overwhelming warmth that spread throughout Remus was all too much</li>
<li>He had let her push too far</li>
<li>Let her come to close</li>
<li>He couldn’t hold it back</li>
<li>Everything inside him burst through the wall he had built</li>
<li>Every demon came out much more angrily, much less hesitant</li>
<li>He hadn’t been able to get the sight of her broken face out of his mind for weeks</li>
<li>It was still there if he sought it, tormenting him, telling him he was a weak, unctuous, a coward</li>
<li>“She dove in front of me. I tried to stop her Remus I did but she- She got hit …”</li>
<li>Remus didn’t know what to do other than stare, his eyes blinking wildly, his mind completely blank</li>
<li>“I’ve seen people be hit with the Cruciatus Curse before, but this- this came from Bellatrix. It was – It- I-”</li>
<li>Sirius felt the words rolling and bubbling off his tongue but no words were coming to him other than the image of Tonks flat on her back</li>
<li>He was trying to keep his eyes off Remus, he didn’t want to see the reaction, didn’t want to see the disappointment</li>
<li>He had tried to protect her but the woman was one of the most loyal he had ever met, the most brave</li>
<li>Remus tore his eyes off Sirius to stare at the ground as he spoke</li>
<li>The image of Nymphadora withering on the ground, her piercing screams, the green glow that would encase her body</li>
<li>It was overwhelming</li>
<li>He felt complete and utter rage, he wanted to find Bellatrix and throw her malice right back in her face</li>
<li>The image of himself, of his claws and his teeth ripping and biting and tearing at her pale skin sped through him</li>
<li>But he could barely move</li>
<li>He had tried to protect her by staying away from her and it had resulted in breaking her heart</li>
<li>Now she had been attacked and he wasn’t there</li>
<li><em>What had happened if it hadn’t been the Cruciatus Curse?</em></li>
<li>The thought alone affirmed that he needed to see her, make sure she was okay</li>
<li>“Where is she?”</li>
<li>Sirius turned to Remus, the man’s face was hardened but his eyes gave him away</li>
<li>The look of worry was plastered in his furrowing brows, his straight mouth and his glazed eyes</li>
<li>As Sirius opened his mouth to speak but they were interrupted by the sound of a loud pop, the noise normally attributed to apparition, followed by loud cursing</li>
<li>They looked at each other, wands instantly clutched in their hands</li>
<li>There was another pop and then a booming voice sounded</li>
<li>“EVERY BLOODY TIME”</li>
<li>Remus didn’t even turn to look at Sirius as he bolted from the kitchen into the front hallway</li>
<li>Sirius was right behind him and nearly toppled over him as he realized Remus had stopped</li>
<li>They were standing before Tonks, her hand clutching her arm and her shoulder pressed into the corridor’s wall</li>
<li>She had a deep gash on her cheek, it appeared fresh and her body was trembling</li>
<li>Mad-Eye appeared to have similar markings on his face as he looked up to see them</li>
<li>“Fucking Dolohov must have been tracking us. Couldn’t even get two bloody seconds to fix her up before they were on top of us! Fought our way out easily enough, thought it’d be best to come here”</li>
<li>Tonks eyes were squeezed tightly, her face was mucked with dirt and blood, her hair was a mousy brown rather than its usually effervescent pink</li>
<li>She spoke quietly, so quietly that if anyone had been speaking they wouldn’t have heard her</li>
<li>“<em>Home</em>”</li>
<li>Then she crumbled forward and Remus was lunging to catch her</li>
<li>She toppled into his arms, her head on his chest and her limbs limp around her</li>
<li>“Get her upstairs.”</li>
<li>Remus didn’t hesitate to scoop her into his arms and rush her to his room</li>
<li>He didn’t know why he picked his room but he figured if she was like this he wouldn’t be able to get much sleep anyway</li>
<li>Mad-Eye and Sirius trailed behind him as he slammed open the door with his foot and gentle placed her on the bed</li>
<li>Her breathing was shallow, her pulse extremely faint, and he could feel his blood pumping loudly in his ears</li>
<li>Remus stood against the wall near the door watching patiently as Mad-Eye worked over her</li>
<li>He watched him heal the markings on her face</li>
<li>Ones surely caused by dark magic</li>
<li>Ones sure to scar</li>
<li>And he could feel Sirius’ eyes on him rather than on her</li>
<li>And it wasn’t jealousy anymore that Remus could feel boring into him</li>
<li>Wasn’t like the possessiveness Remus once felt </li>
<li>And he knew, once Sirius left the room, once Sirius turned away, what was coming</li>
</ul>
