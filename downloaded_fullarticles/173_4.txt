    <p>Remus pulled her covers up to her chin and shivered. It was late at night, and the house was dark and silent. </p><p>Remus didn't know why she had awoken; only she knew something wasn't quite right. Moonlight dappled the shadowed ceiling, streaming in through the ajar window. It swung slightly, in the breeze off the moor. Remus stared at it, certain that it hadn't been open when she'd gone to sleep earlier. </p><p>Fighting the impulse to call for her parents, Remus reluctantly tossed her covers aside, and sat on the edge of her bed. She gauged the dark distance between the safety of her bed and the window, deciding whether or not it was worth the risk. </p><p>She couldn't call for her mother or her father again; over the past couple weeks, Remus had disturbed them at all hours of the night due to her increasing night terrors, and her fear of 'the man under the bed'.</p><p>Each night, Lyall Lupin had rushed to his daughter's bedroom, closely followed by his wife, Hope, to ensure their child was safe. When Remus explained the situation, her parents, with tired eyes and increasingly frequent sighs bent down to check what was underneath the bed. After casting a light underneath, they would tell her that there was nothing there, and that it was just her overactive imagination playing tricks on her.</p><p>Remus gathered up her courage. Not tonight. Tonight, she'd be brave, and she wouldn't call for her mother and father. She swallowed nervously as the darkness toyed with her mind, and made her see shadows where there shouldn't be, skittering under the bed like rats.</p><p>Remus took a deep breath and leapt off of her bed, well away from the edge. She spun around, her heart racing, expecting some sort of terrible monster to be grinning behind her in the dark.</p><p>But her room was still empty, and she was still alone. Remus crept to the swinging window, unable to shake the feeling of unease that overcame her, and gave her that sensation of dropping in her stomach.</p><p>She cast another furtive look about the room, and scampered over to the window, telling herself she was just being stupid as usual. </p><p>She hopped onto the chair by her window so that she could reach the it, despite being tall for a child of nearly five. Her clumsy fingers closed around the handle, and she pulled it shut, letting out a sigh of relief once it was done. </p><p>Encouraged, she slid off the chair, and began to walk back to her own bed. She didn't notice the jagged marks carved onto the windowsill, or the smears of blood and saliva that came after them.</p><p>She still wasn't quite brave enough to venture too close to the gap under her bed, though. Eyeing the shadowy space with trepidation, she jumped onto the bed, feeling an immense sense of relief once she was safely returned, and that the window was closed. </p><p>She sat in the middle of her bed for a moment or two, her feet hanging off the edge. She slowed her rapid breathing, and focused on telling herself that everything was all right, and to back to sleep and to forget about it--</p><p>Remus froze as the bed shook, and seemed to rise and fall and breathe as if it were alive.</p><p>If she called her parents right now, they'd come running, and check under the bed as they always did. And then they'd shake their heads, and sigh, and explain to Remus that there was nothing there and nothing to fear--</p><p>Remus could only let out a faint moan of terror as her stomach dropped sickeningly, and an icy, rough hand grasped her ankle tightly.</p><p>She stared at it a minute, her heart in her throat, as a dark, shadowy shape emerged from the void under her bed.</p><p>Once it was out, it released her ankle, and straightened to its full, terrifying height. </p><p>Petrified, Remus could make out the outline of a bulky man, who seemed to be shuddering with every heartbeat, and writhing in his own skin.</p><p>Despite this, he seemed to be enjoying himself thoroughly. His yellowish eyes glinted promisingly at Remus in the dark, and his sharpened teeth gleamed in the faint moonlight as he grinned widely.</p><p>'I wondered when I'd be meeting you,' he said, his voice thick and gravelly. 'You're Lyall's kid, aren't ya?'</p><p>Remus nodded, shaking uncontrollably. She glanced towards her open door, but the man noticed this, and slammed it shut silently with a flick of his wand.</p><p>'Scream, and I'll kill them both,' he growled.</p><p>Remus crawled back further on her bed.</p><p>He shook back his filthy, matted hair. 'Well I'm Fenrir. Fenrir Greyback. You probably haven't a ruddy clue why I'm here. I believe it's only fair I tell you before--' he glanced out the window, 'well, before I'm done.'</p><p>Remus gazed at him with huge eyes. If only tonight hadn't been the night she'd chosen to be brave. If only she'd called for her mother and father like she always did. None of this would he happening, her father would have dealt with him by now, and Remus would be safe and sound, in her mother's arms.</p><p>Instead, the huge man before her cracked his neck from side to side. 'Had a little run in with your old man a short while back. Took me in for questioning at the Ministry. Meddling in affairs that ain't got nothing to do with him. He almost had them Ministry goofs convinced, though it came to nothing. Seemed convinced I wasn't quite...' he grinned, evidently enjoying this. 'Well, you'll see. Anyway, he offended me, and my kind, and this is me showing him. You don't offend me and get away with it.'</p><p>A shiver went down Remus's back at the words 'my kind'. What wasn't this man 'quite'? </p><p>Her voice was hoarse and crackly as she spoke. 'Sh-showing him what?'</p><p>'What it's like,' he said simply, drawing nearer, until Remus could smell the foul stink of his breath, and the odour of his sweat sodden robes. </p><p>He turned to face the window, the moon illuminating his sharp and scarred features, as it neared its highest point--</p><p>Remus stifled a scream as the man suddenly let out a wild growl, and crumpled in on himself, groaning in pain.</p><p>His bones seemed to be snapping and stretching out of place, and thick, bristly fur erupted from his skin like spines. </p><p>His robes stretched and ripped as his body expanded, and his face elongated into a wide, heavy muzzle, with two glaring, angry eyes fixed on Remus.</p><p>Remus screamed.</p><p>As the creature threw back it's  head and howled, Remus could hear Lyall yelling, and rushing over. He pounded at the door, blasting it to bits with his wand, and barging in.</p><p>He let out a gasp of horror as he saw the creature before him.</p><p>It had been desperately leaping the door, again, and again, driven mad by the scent of human flesh and blood, whimpering horribly high pitched whines, until the door finally gave in to the combined forces and shattered into splinters with a huge CRACK.</p><p>Remus could not move. A mighty beast faced her father, a canine creature with glowing red eyes, scruffy blackish grey fur that was patchy and mangy, huge, heavy paws with long, sharp claws, used to rip and tear and kill, and finally the slavering, dripping jaws, hung wide open, drool slipping down to the floor, the tongue lolling madly... Werewolf, thought Remus.</p><p>It leapt at her father, who deflected it with a roared, 'PROTEGO!' A shield charm sprung up between the two.</p><p>Surprisingly, it worked against the wolf, who fell backwards with a low grunt. Hope ran down stairs to the kitchen to arm herself. The wolf turned away from the larger threats to face Remus. Its eyes gleamed wickedly at the prospect of another meal. </p><p>Hope saw Remus and screamed. 'NO!' Her voice rent the air, but still it was not enough to save little Remus from what was in store for her.</p><p>Remus could not recall any other time she had felt more scared. She sat there, frozen and wide eyed, as the wolf kicked off the floor, and bounded onto the bed beside her, in slow motion...</p><p>Now, if she had been a little quicker, Remus might have escaped by a couple inches. For a couple inches, they could have been a wholesome, happy family, with bright prospects ahead of them. All for a couple of inches. </p><p>But these were all ifs. Her father's eyes were stretched wide with horror, his mouth wide open in a silent 'NO!' that Remus could not hear, as the wolf knocked flat on her back, and held her beneath it, its horrific breath petrifying her.</p><p>Remus closed her eyes and accepted her imminent death. The wolf savoured her fear scent for a moment, then leaned in and took a horrible, crunching bite somewhere near her collarbone. She was sure it took a chunk of flesh with it. She screamed wildly in agony.</p><p>That was what it took for her father to come to his senses. Her roared wildly in unintelligible anger, and began to fire all sorts of unknown hexes at the wolf in all sorts of different colours.</p><p>The wolf picked up Remus's limp form in its jaws, and fled from the room. It tumbled down the stairs, snapping and barking, its jowls dripping with blood. </p><p>Lyall cast a curse at the wolf and it dropped Remus by the door. Hope charged at it with a rolling pin, but was kicked back by the creature's powerful hind legs, claws tearing into her skin. It threw itself at the door until it broke, and raced out satisfied, the job done.</p><p>Lyall stood a sweaty mess in the broken doorway, silhoueted by the accursed, beautiful, wicked moonlight, heaving, his face ashen, and his hair filled with dust and debris.</p><p>All because of a damned Werewolf Legislation. All because of a piece of parchment, and his damned big mouth. All because of a stupid act, that only hurt, and benefitted nobody. All because he hadn't been fast enough. All because of a few, tiny, damn inches.</p><p>Lyall dropped to his knees, by his daughter's broken body, and his wife's unconscious, mangled form. He tried to send off a Patronus for help, but found he could not conjure one. He was not sure who he would call anyway. His daughter was a werewolf now. Who would help her? How was she to ever have a future? He was seeing it all from quite a different perspective now. A feeble silver wisp came from the tip of his wand. Lyall raised his head to the starry sky outside, and howled his misery to the moon.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
