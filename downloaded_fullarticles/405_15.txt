    <p>Kakashi yelped, falling through the vortex created by a combination of his and Obito's Mangekyou only to fall right back into the thick of the war, except... He looked around and blinked twice to make sure it was not a problem with his eyes before being forced to accept that no, he was actually looking at another version of himself dressed with, of all things, a tinfoil hat.</p>
<p>"Why am I wearing a tinfoil hat?" Kakashi asked, and then made a double-take when he realized that his alternate self was not the only one doing so in this bizarre parallel of the fourth shinobi world war.</p>
<p>"Kaguya is an alien," weird-parallel-world-Obito (who looks beaten up but incredibly sane, even wearing a ridiculous tinfoil hatâ€”Kakashi would like to complain to the powers that be; why isn't his own world's Obito sane?) said, as if that answered everything.</p>
