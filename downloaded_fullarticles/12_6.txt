    <p>Fire’s work is never quite done. George’s life used to be filled with fireworks, with bells and whistles; now the decorum, the dignity, the delight has been snuffed from them. He is no longer one of a pair. No longer does he have the reliable company of someone who understood him completely, without effort. Where everywhere he had gone with the association of mischief, now he walks in death’s shadow. He thinks of Peter Pan and imagines Fred is the shadow his body casts on the wall of their room…talks to him, keeps him up to date on all the happenings of the Burrow and their shop…eventually the light dims, and each nightfall brings another small death to the pile building in his core. He doesn’t think but he thinks about death for days…weeks on end. Numbness, the keen awareness of loss, of distance - Fred had always been right there; where was he? Of missing, feeling incomplete, and lost. </p><p>George conjures up a portable blue flame and watches as it slowly slides across the floor of their room, screams in frustration, jumping on it, wanting it to spread, to burn, to engulf his body. He stands stock still, his eyes closed, trying to tell if warmth was spreading - this infuriating fire; it’s child’s play! He crumples to the floor, the feeble charm having gone out, and curls up into a ball, winding himself as tightly as possible, howling silently.</p>
