    <p>Ginny sat on rim of the bathtub, the straps of her silver dress hanging lifelessly on her arms, her carefully curled hair now hang in loose ringlets around her face. The steam rolled of the water, she hadn’t meant to run it so hot. Carefully she reached over and turned the tap. The squeak of the metal turning the only sound in the room. With the water off, she could now hear Harry slamming kitchen cupboard doors and the sound of glass smashing. He must have thrown a tumbler, she mused.</p><p>Tonight, was supposed to be a celebration, it was supposed to be a happy night. It was the night they announced their engagement. The evening had started out so well, Ginny had never felt so glamorous. The silver dress, hugged her body and sparkled with every move she made, the robe she had worn over it had made her look even more elegant. Her hair and make up had been expertly styled by professionals hired just for this evening.</p><p>The beginning of the evening had been a dream, and then the dark cloud that had been hanging over them for the past year and descended. Ginny rubbed her wet eyes, cursing herself. She should have never suggested they get married, marriage wasn’t a plaster. It wouldn’t magically fix everything wrong with their relationship. Arguments had turned into shouting matches which turned into screaming matches. Standing the middle of the living room, her father holding her back as she and Harry hurled insults at each other had poured cold water on her. She couldn’t believe how low they had sunk. The look in her mother’s eyes. Ginny squeezed her eyes shut tightly, trying to forget that look.</p><p>She opened her eyes and clasped her hands together. The ring Harry had given her sparkled in the harsh light of the bathroom. It was beautiful, a diamond mounted on a gold and silver band. She ha no idea how they can come to this. How could their love turn into something so rotten?</p><p>‘Ginny, dear?’ She jumped, startled.</p><p>‘Mum…,’ So lost in her own thoughts had she become, she not heard her mother walk into her room, had no idea her mother was still even in the house even. ‘I’m so sorry.’ Tears rolled down her cheeks.</p><p>‘Oh, Ginny.’ Molly sat in front of her daughter and the pulled the girl into her arms. Ginny’s whole body shook with sobs. Molly sighed and just held her, rubbing slow circles onto her daughter’s back, whispering words of comfort into her ear.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Harry sat on the edge of the kitchen counter. Bottles of Fire Whiskey and aged Ale cluttered around him. He had <em>accio’d</em> every bottle of alcohol he could think of to him, even the ones he knew Ginny had hidden because of his “problem.”</p><p>Harry could honestly say had no idea what kicked off this latest fight. Everything had been going fine. People had congratulated them, Ginny had seemed happy enough. Ron and Hermione had turned up, making the evening that bit more bearable. Everything seemed more bearable when they were around. Ever since the war had ended three years ago, Harry had avoided crowds and parties. He didn’t want to be praised, as tendered to happen when he showed up. It made him sick when people told them how proud, how <em>grateful</em> they were to him for being a murderer. As far as he was concerned, the public could shove their thanks up their backsides.</p><p>Ginny though, Ginny loved the parties. Anytime Harry declined an invitation she was unhappy and went alone. Harry assumed she was doing it to try and spite him, but he couldn’t give less of a shit. If Ginny wanted to party, she was more than welcome to do so. If she wanted to bask in the thanks of the public, then she could go ahead and bask. Harry felt no desire to join in her that, whatsoever.</p><p>Harry had finished the Elf Matured Wine and moved on to aged bottles of Ale he had hidden away in the garden (and he had to hide them, because otherwise Ginny would take them away from him), when his favourite headache had her mother walked into the kitchen.</p><p>‘Merlin damnit, are you seriously drinking? Haven’t we talked about this?’ Ginny rubbed her forehead, she had thought she had hidden or thrown away all of Harry’s alcohol, but no, the Saviour just <em>had</em> to drink.</p><p>‘I thought we also agreed tonight was about having <em>fun</em>, and I am.’ Harry raised a bottle in salute.</p><p>Ginny turned to Molly frustration ‘You see? You see what I’m putting up with?!’</p><p>‘You’re “putting up” with me? That’s rich.’ Harry spat, if she felt that way, why hadn’t she left?</p><p>‘What the hell would you call this? I try to help you, and this is your answer to it.’ Ginny placed her hands on her hips, looking like a younger version of Molly. Harry sneered at her, there was no way in hell was becoming a cuck like Arthur.</p><p>‘Help me? How is taking away my alcohol helping? Who even asked you to help?’</p><p>‘I love you, you didn’t have to ask, because helping each other is what people in love do.’</p><p>‘Love? That is what you call this mess?’</p><p>‘Enough,’ Molly closed her eyes, counted to ten and then looked between the warring couple. Merlin, these two wanted to get married? ‘Enough, now. If you can’t talk like the adults you are, then you have no business acting like adults. I will make you both sit in different corners until you've calmed down.' </p><p>‘It’s alright mum, I was going to leave anyway.’Ginny spat. </p><p>‘Ha, if you stay gone longer than a week, I’ll be impressed. You and I both know you love this life more than you love me.’</p><p>‘You think I love your money? Is that how little you think of me?’</p><p>‘Darling it’s the truth. Who paid for tonight’s front-page drama? I did. The endless shopping trips you just <em>have</em> to go on – I did. That dress, your new top of the range broom – you love the money and status I provide.’</p><p>Ginny’s hand was on her wand faster than she realised. The tip of a very nasty hex on her lips.</p><p>‘<em>Harry</em>,’ Molly marched over the young man she had long ago taken in as her own, and smacked him hard, upside the head. ‘I would think you knew Ginny better than that. I do not know what going on with the two of you, but it stops now, this childishness ends, right now.’</p><p>‘You’re right, I’m going to pack a bag.’ Ginny whispered. Defeated.</p><p>‘No, don’t,’ Harry hopped of the counter top and brushed past the two women he had once considered important in his life. ‘I’ll go, I’m sick of this place anyway.’</p><p>Harry vanished in loud <em>Crack</em>! That ripped through the silence of the kitchen. Molly and Ginny stared at each other for a long moment, waiting to see if Harry would return. Minutes ticked by.</p><p>‘He’s coming back, isn’t he mum?’ Harry couldn’t just <em>go</em>. He had no where to go! Not unless we went to Ron and Hermione’s and Ginny doubted he would that. The Hero had his pride after all.</p><p>‘Honey, I think you should go to bed. You and Harry both need to calm down and everything will look better in the morning.’ Molly walked back over to her daughter and gently walked her from the kitchen.</p><p>‘No, I’m going to wait for him to get back.’ Molly watched helplessly as Ginny re-entered the kitchen, sitting down with her back against the table; facing the doorway, waiting for Harry’s return.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>It took a week before the Prophet discovered that the Harry Potter Destroyer-of- You-Know-Who and Savoir of them all had disappeared. No one seemed to know where the boy hero had gone, and Prophet carried the story on multiple pages, seemingly enjoying the fact Harry had given them something new to print.</p><p>Draco Malfoy read the latest headline <em>Harry Potter Spotted in France?</em> With mounting incredulity. He hadn’t been invited Harry’s engagement party on the night he had disappeared. He and Potter had never been friends and while, after the war, Harry had defended him and his family; there was still an air of tension that surrounded them. Six years of disliking each other did not make for a good friendship – even if you both ended up on the same side in the end. Draco folded the paper and tossed it in the trash. If Harry Potter was in France, Draco would have heard about it by now.</p><p>Lucius had relocated the family to their Manor in the outskirts of the beautiful town, Lourmarin, located in the south of France. Draco lived there until recentl, when he finally allowed himself a treat and brought this beautiful stone town house in Venasque. It was close enough to his parents and allowed him his own freedom. It was, in a word, perfect.</p><p>Surely, Potter, of all people had manged to escape the pressures the Ministry hoped to place on him? The Ministry, as far as Draco was aware; had offered Harry a place on the Auror Training Programme without him needing to complete Hogwarts. If Harry wasn’t careful, he’d be Head Auror and then Minister of Magic if his popularity held and Draco had a feeling it would. Bloody Potter.</p><p>No, the smartest thing Harry could’ve done was remove himself completely from all that nonsense, find his own private sanctuary and married that Weasley he was so fond off. They could have lived happily ever after. The beautiful blushing bride, the dashing hero – isn’t that what everyone thought of when they pictured the pair? It should have happened, something must have gone very wrong for it not to. Not that Draco cared.</p><p><em>Potter was missing</em>. The words repeated themselves inside of his brain until he was tired and fed up of it. If Harry couldn’t handle his own problems, that was his deal. Draco turned his face up to the sun, basking in it’s warm glow. Breakfasting on the balcony had been a splendid idea. To his left, the crystal blue pool water called to him. Smiling contently to himself, he ambled leisurely down to the pool, removing his lose sweat pants and shirt with a causal flick of his wand as he did so. A morning swimming in the pool sounded a great way to start the day.</p>
