    <p>Harry was a noticeably lonely child, he never had any friends or even acquaintances in school and outside of school he was barely seen outside of the house. The only people who really spoke to him were the teachers, his godawful aunt and uncle or <strong>dud</strong>-<strong>brain</strong> <strong>Dudley</strong> who never said anything nice, even though Dudley was most probably the dumbest boy in school everyone was still terrified of him, afraid that if they did one thing out of line he’d smack his chubby little fist into your face or even worse set his pretentious parents onto you. So when Dudley bullied Harry at school no one said a word, afraid of what a snobby little boy like Dudley might do, afraid that he would make fun of or beat them as bad as he did poor Harry and it unfortunately went on like this for years. No one even batted an eye in Harry’s direction or even bothered to help his cause. Until, someone finally had enough, had enough of seeing the daily name calling, shoving and general abuse and not to mention the scruffy boy’s sad green eyes. It was killing this one child.</p>
<p>So one day they finally marched up to Harry on the playground, lunchbox in hand jangling with every step and stood abruptly next to the raven haired boy, who was sat on the concrete playground his emerald eyes glued to the floor not even noticing the person standing next to him. The girl stubbornly clears her throat to grab the boy’s attention, then once Harry’s eyes were on her she opened the lunchbox slowly to draw out the moment before rummaging around as if looking for something specific. Then with a quick,</p>
<p>“ah-hah!”</p>
<p>Drew out a scruffily wrapped sandwich, the inside being chocolate spread, and hastily presenting it to Harry with a proud smile. Harry at first didn’t quite understand the gesture, looking at the girl like she must have mistaken him for someone else, but the girl stood there firmly and even pushed the sandwich further into Harry’s face. His eyes were still crinkled with confusion as he reached for the sandwich taking it gently in his hands.</p>
<p>“Want to be friends?”</p>
<p>The girl spoke up. Her voice slightly quivering with nervousness afraid that even the loner of the school would reject her. Harry found it rather funny thinking of the sandwich as some kind of strange offering, an offering to be her friend, though he’s not quite sure why anyone would want to be his friend. Still slightly taken aback Harry just blinked at her expecting some kind of punchline to the joke called his life but the girl still stood there, her eyes still staring at him expectedly for a answer. Which never came. The girl huffed unsatisfied with the lack of a reply and plopped down next to him,</p>
<p>“ well are you going to eat it?”</p>
<p>She said gesturing to the fully wrapped sandwich still in his hand. Harry responded with an,</p>
<p>“oh- right.”</p>
<p>And slowly began unfolding the seram wrap before bringing the sandwich to his lips and taking a small bite. Harry expected it to be some sort of prank, for the girl to have filled it with sand or mushed up worms then once he took a bite and scrunched up his face in disgust or even worse was sick the girl would laugh at him and tell the whole school about her hilarious practical joke on everyone’s favourite punching bag, Harry Potter. But to harry’s surprise, It was delicious. A simple chocolate spread sandwich, but even so, still delicious. The girl smiled at Harry’s reaction and laughed a little in triumph,</p>
<p><br/> “By the way I’m (y/n)”</p>
