    <p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">The lavender walls of the cabin were stained with cracks, stray bullet holes and patches of blood. The once clean marble floor was littered with corpses of well-dressed Mafioso- <strong>who were either missing a few limbs, or had huge slashes or deep wounds on their bodies, with their weapons scattered around the floor like broken toys</strong>. The corpses were losing their warmth by now, and blood still dripped from them slowly, pooling on the floor as if they had died just few moments ago. The stench of death hovered along with a bone chilling cold that settled in the air. The whole forest around the cabin was deathly silent, as if even the animals in the wild were terrified of the culprits who had caused this massacre.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">A dark, twisting shadow hovered in the air, and the only visible feature of the shadow was a pair of dark, depthless eyes that glanced at the corpses in the room in cold indifference.  A clawed hand reached out from the shadows, and with a snap of it’s fingers, white orbs from every single corpse floated towards the shadow’s hand, and formed a little, glittering ball of light. The shadow stared at the glittering ball of light, before it clenched it in it’s fist, and the ball disappeared.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">After gathering the souls of the deceased, the clawed hand of the shadow disappeared. A few moments later, a warped portal –reeking of Deathly magic- appeared next to the shadow, and a white cat walked out of it. The portal disappeared as soon as the white cat stepped out of it. The white cat paused and eyed the destruction in the room. It then stared at the shadow hovering in the air, and walked towards it nonchalantly, unconcerned of the various corpses and some weapons it was trampling on during his walk, leaving behind bloody paw prints due to blood staining the floor. As soon as the white cat reached nearer to the shadow, it mewed questioningly. The cold indifference in the eyes of the supernatural being turned to annoyance, before the shadow twisted again, and shrunk. Soon, the deathly silence in the air was broken by flapping of wings, and a familiar raven flew towards a chair and perched on it’s back.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">The cat then rolled it’s dark eyes and eyed the corpses around the room in contempt. <strong>&lt;Some people really have no manners, barging into someone else’s home like that. I don’t remember Mafioso being this manner-less a few centuries ago.&gt;</strong></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">The raven rolled it’s dark eyes and cawed in arrogance. <strong>&lt;They should be grateful that it was <em>us</em> who had ended their lives, and not Harry, or even their souls might not been left intact by her.&gt;</strong></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Little white's body trembled slightly and even his ears were pressed flatly to his head as he remembered the incident a few centuries ago that still instilled fear deep within many Reapers. <strong>&lt;Don't remind me. I'd rather get rid of these pests than let Harry rage for letting these bugs hurt her Cloud.&gt;</strong></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><strong>&lt;That's for the best.&gt;</strong> The raven agreed wholeheartedly for once.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Little White then flicked it’s tail and jumped onto a table and sat down on a clean spot-<em>that wasn’t stained by blood</em>- and mewed softly. <strong>&lt;The administrator sure is scheming though. To force the cursed ones to reunite under his Chosen Sky, he actually spread the information about the new chosen Strongest Seven in Cosa Nostra, and manipulated various Mafioso into attacking the Cursed Ones when they’re at their weakest.&gt;</strong> Little White nodded in approval and praised the Administrator's wit. <strong>&lt;Smart.&gt;</strong></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Little Black let out a noise that sounded more like a snort. <strong>&lt; That isn’t going to earn him brownie points from either of the cursed ones.&gt;</strong></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">The white cat shrugged. <strong>&lt;That’s not our problem, at least not at the moment.&gt;</strong> His eyes glinted as he mewed then stretched it’s limbs. <strong>&lt;Let’s head back.&gt;</strong></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">The raven nodded. <strong>&lt;Alright.&gt;</strong></p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p>
