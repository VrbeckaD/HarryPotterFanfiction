    <p>His dissheleved hair fell uncomfortably onto his face, falling over his tired silvery eyes that sagged from lack of sleep. Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead, too, and his chapped lips only craved the sensation of lip blam more with every drop. But it's not like he could fix any of this. No, his hands were tightly bound by a rusted metal that's edges threatened to cut deep into his skin. He was sure he could only move his hands a few centimetres above the table before feeling the wrath of the cuffs, though he hadn't tried it: he was too scared the cuffs were enchanted and would cause him too much pain if he tried. So he sat there, waiting, for minutes, hours, or possibly even days (as he felt as if he'd blacked out a few times) while barely moving. </p><p>Slowly, his eyes started to drift to a close again, his body ready to shut down and allow him to rest, properly rest. If he had blacked out, it hadn't restored his energy properly and if he hadn't... well, he was tired enough to hallucinate so he clearly needed rest. But just as he did, just as he was about to feel the sweet release sleep brought him, the heavy metal door behind him swung open and light flooded the room. Even with his back to it, the light made his eyes cower, so he kept them screwed tightly shut until he felt more used to the light. It only took him a few seconds, as when he opened his eyes, he heard soft footsteps from behind him. He knew who it was: an Aura. Someone who'd come to question him about the crime he was accused of commiting; someone who didn't really need to question him as it seemed the Ministry of Magic was set on blaming him and someone who was just another person biased against his family after the whole war- </p><p>Or not. </p><p>When he looked up at the Aura, who was now walking in front of him and taking a seat in the chair on the opposite side of the table, he realised he recognised him. The messy hair falling unevenly down the side of his head, the piercingly green eyes staring directly back at him, the thin red lipsspread firmly across his face and his round glasses perched on the bridge of his nose made it hard not to recognise him, even if you hadn't gone to school with him for seven years. It was Harry Potter. The boy who lived. </p><p>When he sat down, he placed a file on the table and folded his legs, leaning back in the seat. Draco knew Harry was waiting for him to speak first, but Draco didn't have anything to say to him. He didn't want to explain why he was here, Harry already knew that, didn't want to try and say why he wasn't guilty, because Harry wouldn't believe him - he was starting to think no one would - so Draco sat there, equally as tensed, and waited. </p><p>"Malfoy," Harry started after a while, and Draco opened his mouth to speak but was cut off by Harry continuing. "Draco Lucius Malfoy, aged 25, arrested under the suspicion of robbery, and murder in the first degree through use of magic. Resisted arrest, seemed uncomfortable around officers and repeatedly mentioned his innocence despite being asked to say quiet. And..." Harry paused and Draco knew which part of his file he was reading. "No prior arrests or history with the police." </p><p>"I know what you're thinkinhg_" Draco tried to say, only to be cut off by Harry yet again. </p><p>"What I think doesn't matter. I'm here to talk about you, and what you've done to get yourself in this situation." Harry stated bluntly. </p><p>"If by what I've done you mean be an average, working citizen who does his job, pays his taxes and doesn't commit crime, then we can gladly talk about that." Draco retorted, his pride shining through, despite being a little hurt by the accusations and how they could dare to accuse him. "If not, then I have nothing to say."</p><p>"Then you'll be convicted for your crimes, and God knows what sentence you'd be given for what you've done." Harry said, rather smugly, knowing it would bother Draco to be blamed for everything. </p><p>"Innocent until proven guilty, Potter! Isn't that the saying around here?" Draco asked, noticbly irritated, as he rasied his eyebrow disapprovingly at Harry. </p><p>"There's enough evidence to put you away, Malfoy. Don't get cocky thinking you're nearly off the hook with this one, you're in deep. This," he pointed between the two of them, "this conversation is just a curtesy to see if you have anything to add or want to confess. With what we have on you, the law at the Ministry of Magic states that we can send you to trial immediately." </p><p>Draco's eyes widened. He knew it was bad, but having it voiced by someone who wasn't just his own subconscious made it feel more real, more terrifying. But not only that, this was supposed to be a curtesy? He'd been in here for what felt like days without proper sleep, food or a drink. This did not feel like the Ministry was being curteous.</p><p>“It certainly doesn’t feel like a curtesy,” Draco replied coolly, managing to keep his composure despite burning up inside. “But since it’s you I’m dealing with, I’m not surprised you think this is something nice the Ministry is doing.” </p><p>Keeping his eyes fixed on Draco, he narrowed them and raised his eyebrows curiously. As far as he was aware, nothing bad happened to Malfoy, so why was he acting like it had? Maybe that was just the Malfoy way. He wouldn’t be surprised if it was - he’d never seen Draco act anything other than entitled and arrogant. But still, to be in this situation and acting like he was... why? He couldn’t quite grasp that, so he just kept staring, hoping it would help him figure it out. </p><p>When he finally snapped back into reality, he realised he must’ve been pondering over it for longer than he thought. Considering Draco was in the middle of a long speech, that was.</p><p>“And you know what the worst part of it all is? I’m now stuck, handcuffed to a goddamn table, like I have been for the past... Merlin knows how long, and I’m dealing with you!” Draco finished, angrily slamming his clenched fist into the table. </p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry said finally, after taking in what he said. “Stop being dramatic and focus. You’ve been here for no more than fifteen minutes, and we need to get to work.”</p><p>“Fifteen minutes my ass!” He exclaimed with a shake of his head. “I might not know much but I promise you, I have been here for more than fifteen minutes.”</p><p>“Stop yelling! It’s getting you nowhere. All it does it make you look more aggressive. If you really are innocent, like you keep saying, looking aggressive is not what you want. So do me a favour and just answer these questions.” Harry said. </p><p>A rather annoyed look washed over his face when Harry said ‘like you keep saying’ as if he was making it up and it wasn’t the truth. Of course, he expected Harry not to believe him, but it just seemed like an underhanded way of confessing it. It bothered Draco, because he knew it was the sort of smug thing he would do if he were in Harry’s situation and he would do it to bother Harry. Though it didn’t even cross his mind that Harry said it without any meaning; he was sure it meant something.</p><p>He was wrong, of course. Because Harry wasn’t him, wouldn’t go out of his way to rub it in Draco’s face when it involved his job. The job that he took very seriously.</p><p>“Joseph Hardin.” Harry started, flicking through some of the photos he’d tucked away into Draco’s file. “Can you tell me your connection to him?”</p><p>“None, Potter.” Draco sighed out. “I don’t know that man, I’ve never met that man. Hell, I didn’t even know he existed until I was arrested for the murder of him.”</p><p>Harry decided not to pry yet, not to force him to talk yet or tell him the consequences of staying quite. He’d just ask the rest of the questions, and then repeat. If Draco didn’t answer after that, he’d start praying and pushing, while repeating everything. Draco would get bored eventually and give in. </p><p>“Fine,” Harry said, putting the photos of Joseph to one side and casually sliding Draco a photo of hand-made China that was carefully crafted, an intricate wand, and a jewellery set - complete with fitted diamonds on the earrings, necklace and rings. “He was a very wealthy man, as you may have put together. So he had lots of expensive items. Do you... happen to recognise any of these items?” </p><p>“Not at all,” said Draco while he tapped incessantly on the table with his long, rounded nails.</p><p>Harry puffed out his cheeks in annoyance. This was going to be a long night, longer than he’d first thought. He knew Draco was annoyed he was arrested, but he knew he wasn’t just going to give in straight away. Draco Malfoy was far too stubborn to cave this early, Harry just hoped he would get lucky. Alas, no. He was going to have to be here a while. </p><p>The questioning went on for an hour or so more, with Harry bouncing between the same few questions just phrased differently, and Draco doing the same just with his answers. They weren’t getting anywhere, except somewhere more tired. Draco’s voice was now sore, feeling as if it was being more tightly wound every time he opened it, just from trying to talk louder than Harry to get a word in. Harry felt like his head was about to explode. It thudded against the inside of his skull, rattling around in there like it didn’t contain anything. But he couldn’t do anything about it until he had the answers he wanted.</p><p>“Malfoy!” Harry yelled quickly, massaging his temples with one hand while the other rested on his hip. “We are getting no where. I keep asking the same questions and you keep giving me the same answers.”</p><p>“If you asked different questions, maybe then you’d get different answers,” Draco replied smugly. Seeing Harry getting worked up just gave him even more reason to keep his anger and frustration hidden, not just that he was a Malfoy and had to live up to what the name meant, even if he had moved out. His mother still held that name, and he wouldn’t disgrace it while she did. He knew if his mother wasn’t there in the back of his mind, he would’ve lost it and snapped at Harry, not caring about dishonouring the unwritten rules of the Malfoy name. Now he could focus on two things to keep him calm though. And that was just enough. </p><p>“But I can’t ask different questions. There’s no other relevant questions and the repetition was supposed to make you bored and give me honest answers, maybe even a confession.” </p><p>“I have nothing to confess, and I am being honest. So I guess it’s just back and forth, but going by the looks of things, I won’t be the first to get bored.” Draco cocked his eyebrow, a smirk playing at his lips.</p><p>Even in a situation like this, he found a way to annoy Harry. </p><p>“Not to the bearer of bad news, Malfoy. But look at the evidence we have. It all points at you having something to confess, and you knowing more than you’re telling me right now. So, I will ask again, do you know Joseph Hardin? And if you do, what is your connection to him?”</p><p>It was then something clicked in Draco’s head. He could use Harry’s desperation and get something out of this. Maybe out of these handcuffs and a glass of water, just something like that. </p><p>“Okay Potter,” Draco started, his smirk growing. “I will be completely honest with you, swear it on the Malfoy’d name, if you can get me out of these handcuffs and some water. I know you said I haven’t been here long, but it feels like I have and I need to be able to move and drink. So if you can do that, I will tell you everything I know about this situation.”</p><p>He wanted to say no and be stern. Of course he did. He was an Aura and it was his job to handle prisoners like this every day. But the desperation was seeping in, coursing through his veins and becoming more intense with every word that stumbled past Draco’s lips. Saying no to this would be denying him a possible opportunity to get something good. A confession at best, more evidence at least. Maybe that way he’d get things at work because he deserved it, not just because he was The Boy Who Lived. He needed at least that. </p><p>“Fine.” He said quietly, looking at Draco who seemed completely and utterly proud of himself. “Fine, I will speak to them and I’ll be back in a moment.” </p><p>With that, Harry opened the door, letting Draco embellish in the light for a moment before it fell shut behind him and Draco was left in the monstrous darkness. Again.</p>
