    <p>When you settled for working as a translator for the Ministry after graduating Hogwarts, you hadn’t really envisioned yourself leading a life of traveling the world and excitement.  </p><p>And yet, here you were, swimming back up to a small sailboat not too far off the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea after chatting with some very helpful Merpeople to see if they had seen a rare subspecies of Hippocampi.  And this was all thanks to a certain lovable Magizoologist who had sought you out for your talents. </p><p>As soon as you broke the surface of the water next to the small sail boat and dispelled your bubble charm, you were greeted by the sight of said Magizoologist.  Newt extended a hand to you with an adorable grin, clearly all too excited to hear about what you learned, and helped you climb back aboard.  Sitting down next to each other on the deck, you used your wand to start drying your clothes back out again.</p><p>You could practically feel him vibrate next to you out of anticipation at hearing how your meeting went, the questions came flying out of his mouth rapid fire, “So, how was your visit?  What were they like?  Did they know anything?”</p><p>“It went very well, they were a bit more friendly than the ones back home.  And a couple of them said that they saw a colony a few miles further in, toward the northwest.”  You spoke absentmindedly as you finished wicking the water away from you and with a swish of your apple wand, sent it back into the sea.</p><p>Newt took advantage of your distraction to sneak in a shy kiss to your cheek, his blue eyes reflecting a degree of adoration that made your heart momentarily stop.  “You’re positively brilliant, you know that?”</p><p>You could practically feel your face flush from how sincere his comment was, even if he told you that every time you used your talent.  Leaning up, you placed a chaste kiss on his lips, “So are you.”</p><p>Unable to suppress a small chuckle at how Newt immediately dropped his eyes away from yours, a blush spreading underneath his fruckles, you watched him fondly as he stood up and cleared his throat.</p><p>“Now, let’s go find those Hippocampi, shall we?”  He offered his hand to you, which you gladly took once more.</p><p>
  <em>And there was no place in the world you’d rather be.</em>
