    <p> </p>
<p>Harry James Potter was extremely odd child. He was sometimes almost happy sitting alone in dark cupboard, he was very satisfied being completely friendless and he didn’t complain when he did all the housework for his guardians. He didn’t also complain them treating him bad, worse than bad. He was not their family and he knew that. He also knew that in a way he deserved to be called a freak. There was nothing normal about him and he had learned all that without his guardians help, they just confirmed it.</p>
<p>He didn’t mind being quiet and staying out of sight. Being quiet had been quite handy sometimes, no one really expected him to say much, so they wouldn’t ask so he wouldn’t have to lie. And there would then be no trouble or at least not much.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He liked his long hair that refused to be shorter; growing back in seconds after Aunt Petunia would cut half of it off.  That for once showed that there was something wrong with him. He didn’t mind, it was nice. It made him feel good, not being like them, his guardians and all of their friends with same haircuts and flowers in gardens. He didn’t exactly think he was better than them but he was very happy being different even thought it meant being a freak, son of an alcoholic murderer and a crack whore. That they reminded him, daily. He didn’t hate them, at least he was sure he didn’t, he didn’t exactly know what hate was. He didn’t know what was being sad or happy. He thought that he was happy when he was alone or had he’s books, but if he didn’t know sad, how could he be sure what was happiness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not hating didn’t mean that he liked. He had come thinking that he didn’t like humans’ period. He never met anyone that interested him or was nice to him, no matter how polite he had been or how quiet. He had come to liking birds; they seemed to follow him sometimes when he went out. Especially the black ones.</p>
<p>Harry thought that the birds were pretty and he would often give them his food and not eat himself. He thought that the birds were hungrier and more deserving. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He often liked to wonder around, find new places to hide and read. He wasn’t yet that good at reading but he had come to liking Dickens, Shakespeare, Tolstoy and Dostoyevsksi. He could remember few sayings and would repeat them in his mind in nights when he was bit too scared to sleep. Those times would be when his uncle was drunk or when his cousin had friends over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had also tried to read book called bible after his Aunt would talk about it and tell him he would go to hell and God would judge him to internal pain and horror. He had been confused that what was God, how could someone to such a thing. He didn’t get too long with bible and came to conclusion that it was better to just wait the judgment than try to understand it.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>He was hiding in the bushes and trying to be quiet as he could but it didn’t seem to work too well. He was shaking and he’s teeth were making noise as they clinked together. It was really cold, freezing really; the ground was fully white and icy, more snow coming down. He of course had no coat or proper shoes, just too big, rag like t-shirt and matching pants. He’s shoes had holes and only thing trying to keep his ear from freezing off was the long black hair. He could barely move his hands or legs so he had no escape plan if he ever needed one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had run straight to bushes as he had heard steps of someone coming to playground. He wasn’t supposed to be there, he was suppose to stay in the shed and not be seen as his guardians hosted some kind of fancy dinner party. He was the shame of the family, the freak and burden that no one wanted. They always wanted him ether out of the sight or doing housework. But he had been hungry and wondered off and not looked exactly where he was going. So ending up at the tiny playground at the end of driveway was not the plan. It was obvious that there was no food in there, but the swings could have somehow kept him warm as they moved. He didn’t get to that and now he was indeed hiding from whoever was coming in his way. He tried to make himself even smaller, what seemed impossible, since the child was already unbelievably small, tiny and bony or however you would like to describe him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some reason he couldn’t hear the steps anymore that scared him since there was no reason to them just disappear. He hadn’t heard the person leaving or anything. The situation cleared pretty soon as he heard a voice above his head.</p>
<p>“That does not look very warm or comfortable place to sit”</p>
<p>Man had a thick accent, but Harry didn’t know its origin, since he never met anyone from abroad. It did sound wonderful in he’s ears and when the man said some words, most likely some kind of curse, in weird language, Harry thought that it was the most amazing thing he had ever heard. It took him almost minutes to realize that he should have answered something. It was rude not to. Still he was scared out of his mind so maybe that excused him.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir”. Harry's voice was really quiet, he had learned in his six years of life that it was easier to be quiet, less trouble, less making his guardians angry. He couldn’t keep his eyes away from the strange man, even thought that was even ruder than not answering, he knew that. But still, the man had something in him that made it hard to look away. Some sort of an aura around him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was very pale man, even more pale than Harry whose skin could get lost in snow, with very dark eyes. Dangerous eyes you would say. He was tall and his shoulders were so board that it would be miracle to ever reach hands around the man. As his eyes, the hair was dark, long like Harry’s but tied back, very neatly. What caught Harry’s eyes, beside the beard that was very unusual in Surrey, were the clothes. Man was wearing a suit that looked like it was from 1800’s and huge fur coat. It sure was cold for someone without a coat at all, but it was only -1 degrees Celsius so fur coat was not a thing to go running around without tripping from sweat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I take that as you agree. Tell me then what are you sitting in there for?” Man hovering over Harry talked again. In a way Harry had forgotten he was there, what was ridiculous, since all he did was stare at the man and wondered about him. Still he jumped a bit hearing his voice and feeling eyes burning into his skull.</p>
<p>“Well, sir. I am hiding” Harry’s voice was shaking, partly from cold and partly from obvious reasons. He had terrible need to get up and run into hiding somewhere else, where he would actually be hiding, but even getting up seemed impossible in this moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That is interesting. May I ask why you are hiding? You should at least wear some clothes that are proper for hiding in such a places. Don’t you agree, Harry”. Again, Harry didn’t answer, for many reasons. First, he was not sure if it was okay to say he was hiding from the man or if it was better to say that he was hiding because he had run away from the shed he had been sent to. Second, explaining his clothing situation never went too well. There had been some of those in school and when he told the truth there would always be trouble and when he lied there was also trouble. And last, he was thinking really hard that when had he told the man his name or had his guardians maybe sent someone after him and that was why the man knew his name. He wasn’t sure so he didn’t say a thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I see that you are not saying anything. I should take offence in that but it looks like I scared the shit out of you, so I must apologize. I think it’s time for you to get up now Harry and go home; they will be looking for you soon.  We shall meet again and next time, don’t hide, so we can use the time to talk.” This time he was very serious so Harry got up very fast but still when he was up the man was gone. Leaving the six years old boy standing into park, confused and still hungry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was very weird and interesting meeting and in way Harry was looking forward to the fact that man had said they would be meeting again. He had no idea who the man was but it couldn’t be worse than his uncle for sure. It was weird being interested in another human for Harry, it never happened before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t own a watch but as some of the crows around him started to get restless; Harry took the man’s advice and took his direction toward home. Or whatever place it was suppose to call, it wasn’t exactly what his books descripted as home. For some reason he wasn’t cold anymore and it took some time to notice, he just assumed that the weather had gotten better or his feet were just too numb to freeze anymore. Sure there was no other explanation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his cupboard, Harry had a small flashlight, it wasn’t a good one, no, but enough to see some of the print in book. He did miss some of the lines as he couldn’t keep the light directed straight to the book since then it would also been seen outside his little personal space. It was past midnight, but Harry was too restless to read, usually the books made him sleepy but not tonight. He was exhausted but no sleep was granted. He got lost in his thoughts once in a while, seeing stars and snow, feeling freezing but warm in funny way. The spiders he shared the cupboard with seemed to stare at him, what was extremely weird, spiders didn’t stare. Did they?</p>
<p> </p>

  <em>“My friend, I've been lying all my life. Even when I was telling the truth. I never spoke for the truth, but only for myself, I knew that before, but only now do I see...Oh, where are those friends whom I have insulted with my friendship all my life? And everyone, everyone! Savez-vous, perhaps I'm lying now; certainly I'm also lying now. The worst of it is that I believe myself when I lie. The most difficult thing in life is to live and not lie...and...and not believe one's own lie, yes, yes, that's precisely it!” </em>

</p>
<p>Back in his book, Harry had no idea what it meant, but it did sound nice. Something about lies, those he did tend to avoid but they often followed him, saved him. Weird being saved by a lie, absolutely weird, made no sense at all. Perhaps thought, it was meant to be so. Weird, indeed. Harry wondered what the foreign words meant and what country they came from, certainly not from same as the man from park. These were too elegant, the way his man spoke was more brazen and harsh, better to his ears.</p>
<p>His man? Why was he thinking that the man was his, Harry did not even know his name. He did know Harry’s what was scary in way. The man was not his. Someone cannot be someone’s. Someone is not an object, could something that is not an object be owned. That would be just stupid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The man in dark corner of dirty pub in Knockturn Alley was a regular sight. He didn’t exactly look like a regular, being dressed like a gentleman and rich and pub being dirty, filthy and most likely a place for criminals. Still, there he was every day in that same dark corner with same drink. Whiskey, no rocks. It was not good whiskey, some cheap piece of shite, found from traders market. Owner of the pub was not into selling anything expensive since most of his customers would rather spend their money on whores. He didn’t count on this man coming every day, but for some reason he always came.</p>
<p>It annoyed the owner, he didn’t like foreigners, even thought he knew that man had been in England for years, God know why.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today the man has showed up soaking wet, what was a wonder, you would think someone loaded and most likely with title could have an umbrella. The owner still didn’t say anything, the man brought money in, his weird friends came by and bough all the booze he had.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now he was alone, mumbling something in Russian. Sometimes cursing in English and scaring other customers. Some women would time to time try to get man interest, but soon failing.</p>
<p>“ебать , сатана , дьявол”, words came flying out of his mouth, with frustration. He had gotten step forward today, talked to the boy, Harry. It was good, but it had been terrible. Boy had been so cold and seemed really dumb what he knew Harry wasn’t. He was really smart boy but those muggles were destroying him. He should have stayed longer or just kidnapped him. That could have worked. No one else was watching the boy and the muggles wouldn’t care so it should have been easy. Instead he chose to scare the boy and leave him in disgusting clothes in to snow. That wasn’t the best plan. He had been there almost 5 years, watching the boy, making sure he didn’t die or get too hurt. Sometimes he had actually saved the boy, not that Harry knew that. He had been in cold too long, would have died of it if he hadn’t cast a warning spell, same with sun and no water situation. It took year and half to find him after idiot headmaster had dumped the kid to muggles. So the boy was alive and not hurt, well not too badly at least, except he might be crazy or somehow mentally ill. Then again who wasn’t? He himself had spent 4 years in Siberian prison in his youth so he could definitely not say that he was fully in his mind. He wasn’t sure why had gotten so interested in the boy, at first it was a job, but now he was actually feeling protective and somehow had managed to make a list in his head to fix things about the boy and his life. Fixing the boy wasn’t exactly like it sounded; more like introducing him to right style and making sure he would speak many languages and know when to be arrogant or humble. 5 years was a long time for sure, after the fall of Dark Lord he had been ready to go home but the boss had other plans. “Watch the boy”, “Mold the boy”, “Teach him”, “When the time comes…” He had no idea what was so special, well something in that boy had put the Dark Lord into to ground, but now, it was everything. Everything was special and soon it was time, to whatever. So here he was, thinking what exactly it was that he would be speaking to Harry about next time he saw him, he did tell the boy that they would talk after all.  So far it was not going too well.</p>
<p> “Mac! Get me another whiskey. Now”                                                                                                 </p>
<p>*</p>
<p> Harry was sitting in frozen bench behind the house, so someone seeing him was around 0,01% chance, he was reading Mein Kampf. He had been staring the words over an hour already like a maniac, what suited the theme pretty well. It was like he was in hurry to finish it, what could make sense, since if his aunt would ever saw that Harry was reading something written by Hitler, he wouldn’t be getting away with only a hit in a head with a frying pan.  But aunt and uncle had called Hitler a freak, like Harry, so the six years old got curious about what made Hitler freak and could Hitler have had any similar things that described him as a freak. Mein Kampf didn’t exactly help finding out the reason since it was by Hitler’s own words and not someone who decided to call Herr Hitler a freak.  Also it didn’t help that Harry was six and had no understanding of politics and the book had many words he never heard of. He made himself a promise that when grow up a little and got to meet these things called politics, he would read it again. Till then he needed to find another way to research the freakiness of both of them.  His list of what to do had gotten quite big already. He loved to read his books, that were digged out of trash or given him by nice library lady, and he thought that what he read was beautiful, inspiring and extremely useful. But the scripts were not easy to understand, from almost every book he made some kind of note about what to learn before he read that book again.  From Demons he made a note to learn French, not that he knew that the language was actually French and from war and peace he made a note to learn about humanity and what is a definition of life. Hard questions for a young boy.  </p>
<p>But he was Harry; he needed to learn like he needed his own space and quiet thing.</p>
