<p>Just Right</p>

<p>“This one?” Harry asked, holding up a wreath and shaking off the snow. </p>
<p>Severus raised an eyebrow. “It’s rather big, isn’t it?” </p>
<p>Shaking his head, Harry put it aside. “This one?” he asked, holding up a smaller wreath. </p>
<p>“Too small.” </p>
<p>“Oh for—” Harry placed his hands on his hips, glaring at Severus. “This shouldn’t be that difficult, Severus!” </p>
<p>Severus crossed his arms. “It isn’t. Just pick the correct wreath for our door and we can go.” </p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine. <i>You</i> pick it out, then.” </p>
<p>Drawing his wand, Severus waved it, and a wreath came flying towards him. He caught it, holding it up. “How about this one?” </p>
<p>Harry narrowed his eyes. “If you could have done that all along, why didn’t you?” </p>
<p>Severus smirked. “You always seem to enjoy this whole process of coming to the tree farm and picking out our greenery. I’m getting cold and hungry, however, and Warming Charms only go so far.” </p>
<p>Harry scowled. “Next year <i>you</i> can do it, then,” he growled, turning away. </p>
<p>Sighing, Severus reached for him, clasping his arm. “Are you truly upset?” </p>
<p>Harry sent him a half-hearted glare. “I don’t like wasting time, so if you don’t enjoy it—”</p>
<p>“I enjoy,” murmured Severus, pulling Harry close, “spending time with you, no matter what we’re doing.” Leaning in, he kissed Harry, who immediately sagged against him, kissing him back as the snow swirled around them. When they drew apart, they were both panting. “Although right now,” Severus continued, “my bits are about  to freeze off, and since I’m rather fond of them—”</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “Say no more. We can go home now that you’ve picked our wreath.” He kissed the corner of Severus’ mouth. “And I’m rather fond of your bits, too,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“I should hope so.” Severus smirked. </p>
