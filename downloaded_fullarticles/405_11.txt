Bloody hell! You’re going too fast!”</p><p>“Just leave me alone” You cried out as your robe flew behind you in the wind. It was cold and near Christmas time. Most of the students had already left to be with family but you were some of the few that stayed in school.</p><p>You and Draco have been in a secret relationship since first-year. Now you both are third-year students and still helplessly in love. However, despite you being a pureblood, Draco thought it would best to keep your love a secret.</p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy’s being sus</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>he was shady enough</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>but now he’s just a shadow</em>
</p><p>You absolutely hated it, seeing him flirt with Slytherin girls almost every day hurt you. They were everything you weren’t. From your afro or box braids to your beautiful brown skin, to your breast, your waist beads, and anklets. You didn’t try to hide who you were. You were proud of your culture and your house, everything everyone, not of your house, told you to be ashamed of.</p><p>Slowing down as you reached further into the forest, you took a right knowing exactly where you wanted to be. The snow was slowly falling and it freezing causing your dark cheeks to have a small red tint and your eyes to water. But you didn’t care. The cold was the least of your concern. A gazebo in the distance grew closer and closer with every second as you continued to run. Stopping in your tracks you stood under it knowing Draco wasn’t too far behind. Taking deep breaths you wiped your tears from the cold away, calming down.</p><p>“What… The.. Blood hell..” Draco said out of breath. “Why did… you run?”</p><p>“Do you love me Draco?”</p><p>“What- Y/n what are you talking about of course I do!” he cried. Taking careful steps, Draco gently grabbed your arm and pulled you to his chest. His pale lips met your hairline where your smooth down edges were laid. “Why did you run? Is it because of Parkinson?”</p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy loves his friends</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>like I love my split ends</em>
</p><p>“It’s more than that Draco! Every day… Every fucking day I have to watch you flirt and hold other girls! I’m tired of it. I’m tired of hearing you and your friends make fun of me and my house. I know I’m not perfect but I miss the days where you treated me like I was. Nowadays the only time you seem to care is if Harry looks at me or Cedric talks to me. I’m tired of the double standard. So.. I think we should break up.” you said with a sigh while pushing away from the warmth of his body.</p><p>“Brea- what!? If this is because of Parkinson I won’t talk to her again. You’re really taking this out of proportion though.” he said in shock.</p><p>“No, I’m really not. I did not come all the way from my country to get disrespected and treated like the side piece. And it’s not just that I can hear the little side comments your friends make about me, about my hair, and you don’t ever say a thing.” you countered angrily.</p><p align="center">
  <em>and by that I mean</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>He cuts </em>em<em> off</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>(What?!)</em>
</p><p>“Then they’re gone too Y/n!” he exclaimed while grabbing your wrist. You let out a groan seeing he obviously didn’t understand your point. “Look, I’m sorry love. Let’s just go inside where its warm to talk about this.”</p><p>“What are you sorry for Draco?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You heard me, what are you sorry for? Where did you go wrong?” Draco looked at you in confusion.</p><p>“I’m sorry for not treating you like the queen you are to me.”</p><p>“Wrong. I don’t want to be treated like a queen, well I mean I do, but not like that. I want to be treated like a person, like your equal, like your girlfriend that you’re proud of, not like something or someone you’re ashamed of..”</p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy, my boy, my boy</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>Don’t love me </em>like<em> he promised</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy, my boy, my boy,</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He ain’t a man and sure as hell ain’t honest</em>
</p><p>“I- I didn’t know”</p><p>“Of course you didn’t. You don’t care. Which is why I can’t do this anymore. These past three years have been nice. But-”</p><p>“But nothing Y/n! You can’t just give up on us!” Draco shouted while turning you to face him. His silver-grey eyes glaring down at you. But you were having none of that.</p><p>“The fuck you mean “You can’t give up on us’!? I’ve been the only one trying! I’ve been the one crying over a boy who cares more about his name than me! I’ve been the one pushed to the side and mistreated and you never cared! I’m the only one that gave this relationship my all. So what the fuck did you contribute to besides my tears!?” You looked into his eyes for any sign of protest. Seeing none you decided to continue. “Your friends are asshats Draco. I’ve had to cut my hair twice! Twice! Because of their stupid pranks! If it wasn’t for the same people you want me to stay away from I would have left them in Madam Pomfrey’s care for a month! Either we tell everyone about us or we’re through. I’m done being in the shadows Draco”</p><p>“Bloody hell Y/n give me time at least! You can’t fucking just do this to me out of nowhere. I promise I’ll change.” he tried to reason. His eyes shined with desperation, unshed tears, and urgency.</p><p align="center">
  <em>my boy’s being sus</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>and he </em>don’t<em> know how to cuss,</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>he just sounds like he’s tryna be his father</em>
</p><p>“No. I just can’t do this anymore. Draco please. I’m tired. You said the same thing last year. And if you can’t see my worth I know exactly who will.” you said with a sigh. You hated to see him so sad and stressed. But he needed to understand how you felt. You just wanted to be able to show publicly how much you cared for each other. “Draco, baby, I love you. But I can’t keep doing this. I want be able to hold your hand whenever I want. To hold you when I need to. Please stop pushing me away.”</p><p>Both of you were crying at this point. Snow stuck in your afro and snow stuck in platinum blond hair. With shaky hands, he gently cupped your face and placed his cold chapped lips against your plump smooth ones. You didn’t pull away. The cycle was slowly repeating itself. Wrapping your arms around his neck your lips did a synchronized dance, making air the least of your concerns. Just being in each other’s arms and holding each other close is all you could think of in the cold of the day. His hands slowly left your face and dipped down to your shoulders, sliding off the robe you proudly wore. Everything around you faded to black as you focused on each other’s existences. Your hands never left his neck as you desperately pulled him closer.</p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy’s an ugly crier</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>but he’s such a pretty liar</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>and by that I mean he said he’d “change”</em></p><p>His hands slowly searched the curves of your body, whether they were little or big, and stopped at your hips. The two of you pulled away for air and let out a little chuckle. You could see the white of your breath in the cold air but you didn’t care. You unravel your hands from Draco’s neck and pulled off your sweater vest. Draco quickly caught up by shaking off his robe and pulling off his vest. While unloosening his tie he gave you a cheeky smirk with a chuckle.</p><p>“Don’t look at me like that. You’re still in trouble.” You said with a click of your teeth but he didn’t care. His hands met your hips again and he pulled you into another passionate kiss.</p><p>“Shush Don’t ruin the moment.”</p><p>Before you could protest his lips were on yours again and his quick pale hands were quickly working at your buttons leaving your bra-clad chest exposed to the cold winter air. He didn’t waste his time with his own buttons and yanked his shirt open. His tone body was once again exposed to your eyes and didn’t need an invitation to touch. Grasping your hands to a stop Draco kissed your wrist with a smile. Something so genuine and truly only the people he loves has seen it.</p><p align="center">“Give me a minute, love.” He said softly before pulling away and moving around your robes and sweaters to make a makeshift blanket to the cold. Rolling your eyes you gigged and pushed him down gently. Draco let out a gasp but didn’t fight it one bit. Instead, he placed his hands behind his head and winked. “Go on.”<br/>
<br/>
<em>My boy, my boy, my boy</em></p><p align="center"><em>Don’t love me </em>like<em> he </em>promise</p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy, my boy, my boy</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He ain’t a man and sure as hell ain’t honest</em>
</p><p>Laughing softly you climbed on top of him and his lips once again. His hands moved from his head and found its place comfortably up your skirt on your ass. Giving it an experimental squeeze he let out a soft moan. “Mmm I love you babe..”</p><p>You didn’t respond, instead, you slowly kissed down his cold body without breaking eye contact. Once you reached his hips you unbuckled his belt and unzipped his pants. Reaching in you pulled out his semi-hard member and gave the soft pink tip a kiss. Draco let out a soft hiss when you began your assault with a slow tentative lick from his base to his uncircumcised tip. Swirling your tongue around the head while stroking it slowly you held back your smiles and giggles at his moans. “Fuck Y/n.. Shhhit..” he drawled out.</p><p>You knew what you were doing and you weren’t gonna stop. You were done playing his games. So you were gonna give him something to miss when he’s with the Slytherin girls. When his hand fell on top your head pushing down your hair in the process you decided to stop your teasing and take him in. You started with less than half and you bobbed your head while stroking the rest. You could feel his member grow in size in your mouth and you used this as encouragement to take him deeper.</p><p>Soon enough you were taking his whole length at a steady paste. Hollowing out your cheeks you slowly pulled away from his length letting the cold air touch his wet member causing him to groan and shiver looking down at you. Looking into his half-lidded hazy eyes you let a soft chuckle and stroked his fully erect dick. “Babe, why’d you stop?”</p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy… I love… my split ends</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy… I love…</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>(Alright dude, go trip over a knife)</em>
</p><p>“Maybe I don’t want to continue..” you teased. However, Draco wasn’t having any of that. He flipped the two of you over leaving him on top. Rolling up your skirt he tore your stockings open with a huff causing you to let out a gasp. “Draco! Why would you!?-”</p><p>Draco cut you off with a rough kiss as he placed your legs on his shoulder lining his dick up with your damp entrance. “Taking them off would have been too much work. I’ll buy you three new pairs and a little something just for me as well,” he explained into your neck. “God, you’re perfect..”</p><p>“Apparently not perfect enough for you to want to make us public,” you said as a snide remark. Draco didn’t respond not wanting to fight when he’s so close to being in you.</p><p>The snowfall around the gazebo slowly increased but neither of you could feel it while in each other’s arms. The cold air could not intrude on the warmth of the young lovers, and it wasn’t felt one bit as Draco slowly slid inside of you. Is hard length stretched you open to accommodate to his size and you couldn’t help but to moan as your body reacted to him. Your back arched as he got closer and closer to being at the base of his cock, and once he was you nails racked against his back.</p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy, my boy, my boy</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>Don’t love me </em>like<em> he promised</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>My boy, my boy, my boy</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He ain’t a man and sure as hell ain’t honest</em>
</p><p>The two of you have only done it a few time. So you weren’t completely used to his size which he was proud about. Draco stared into your dark brown eyes as he started off his thrust deep yet slow. With your legs on his shoulders, he was hitting deeper than you’ve ever felt. Tilting your head back you let out a soft moan digging your nails into his back.</p><p>Draco used this as encouragement to thrust faster, and soon enough his hips were moving at a breakneck speed slamming into yours. His gruff groans and moans filled your ears as you cried out his name in pleasure. You could feel him hitting deep in you and when his thumb found your clit you almost lost it completely. Your screams and cries filled the winter nature around you along with his grunts and praise.</p><p>Time stood still between the two of you, and after multiple orgasms, Draco finally finished deep inside you. Your breaths were ragged as he pumped in you a few more time before collapsing next to you with a smile.”Bloody hell.. That was amazing Y/n”</p><p>By now it was sunset and the two of you were tired from your activities. You couldn’t stop yourselves from dozing off. The two of you used Draco’s robe as a blanket. You came to before he did and brushing his hair away from his face you frowned sadly.</p><p align="center">
  <em>You want me to be yours</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>well, then you gotta be mine,</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>and if you want a good girl,</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>then goodbye</em>
</p><p>You knew you couldn’t keep doing this. You couldn’t keep being his mistake. You will always love Draco but you needed him to put the same amount of energy in. With a sigh, you placed a soft kiss on his lips in goodbye. Picking up your sweater vest, you buttoned up your blouse and fixed you ripped stocking the best you could to concealing the mess Draco made. Putting on your vest you took Draco’s robe and put it on. That way both of you had something to remember each other by. Kissing his lips one last time as you walked away you didn’t know he watched sadly.</p><p align="center">
  <em>You want me to be yours</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>well, then you gotta be mine,</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>and if you want a good girl,</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>then goodbye</em></p>
