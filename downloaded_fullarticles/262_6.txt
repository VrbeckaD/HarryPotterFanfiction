</p><p> </p><p>“Good evening, Nagini… You missed an intriguing visit with Narcissa Black – <em>Malfoy</em>, now,” Lord Voldemort hissed as the giant snake leisurely wound its way up the chair leg to slither across the top of the chair and down Voldemort’s left arm.</p><p> </p><p>“It was quite enthralling… It seems she and Lucius have been unable to conceive a child. They’ve been to Healers. Nothing is <em>physically</em> wrong with them… Young Mrs. Malfoy shared some intimate details about Lucius and I suspect he is more than just a wizard…”</p><p> </p><p>Nagini lifted her head to the dangling tips of Voldemort’s right fingers, in search of a caress.</p><p> </p><p>“I gave her a highly effective potion and she should conceive. I would never tell him this but I suspect that Lucius Malfoy is a shifter… And that his wife is not his mate…”</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Hermione met the eyes of the notorious Malfoy patriarch and experienced something quite different from what she expected.</p><p> </p><p>The dull roar of the Quidditch World Cup crowd fell away as she admired his pale hair and eyes and sharp features. He was simply beautiful. His grey gaze roved her face and she felt an actual blush crawl across her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>Even so young and despite the wizard’s disposition towards Muggle-borns, Hermione identified her feelings as intense physical attraction.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius finally ripped his gaze from her and Hermione dumbly followed Harry and Ron until her heart calmed and her senses returned.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>The girl’s screams tore through Lucius like a hot dagger and he could bear the sound no longer. His once sharp mind struggled to find an excuse – any excuse – to point Bellatrix at another victim.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you get into my vault?” Bellatrix screamed. “Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?”</p><p> </p><p>“We only met him tonight!” the Muggle-born witch sobbed. “We’ve never been inside your vault. . . . It isn’t the real sword! It’s a copy, just a copy!”</p><p> </p><p>“A copy?” screeched Bellatrix. “Oh, a likely story!”</p><p> </p><p>“But we can find out easily!” Lucius interjected. “Draco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!”</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>As birthdays go, Lucius Malfoy had had better.  Narcissa was a year gone and Draco, happily settled with his fiancé in Diagon Alley, rarely returned owls. Lucius spent the better part of his birthday repairing his dilapidated home and trying not to think about his increasing loneliness.</p><p> </p><p>Over the past couple of days, a hollow, gnawing sensation had started to expand within his chest. Lucius couldn’t shake the idea that he should be looking for a companion. Idiotic as it was to think he’d be desired by any witch, he missed female camaraderie.</p><p> </p><p>So it was that Lucius lay sleepless in bed on the night of his forty-fifth birthday, pining for company.</p><p> </p><p>A gust of wind buffeting the corners of the Malfoy home preceded a thunderous growl. Wand and dressing robe summoned almost without thought, Lucius yanked open his bedroom door and raced down the grand staircase. Large shadows gave evidence of a beast outside the manor’s garden doors. Had someone set a Manticore loose on his property as a prank?</p><p> </p><p>Lucius stalked carefully towards the windows. Sudden movement might draw the attention of the creature.</p><p> </p><p>“Lucius!”</p><p> </p><p>The deep, gravelly voice boomed from outside.</p><p> </p><p>Heart beating wildly, Lucius peered at the moonlit figure. Was it a dragon? Dragons didn’t speak! And why would a dragon know him?  </p><p> </p><p>A flicker of flame-like light danced across the beast and it reduced to the size of a man. …A familiar man in white robes.</p><p> </p><p>As the figure opened the garden’s glass doors, Lucius remained still.</p><p> </p><p>Surely, he was dreaming…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>…Abraxas was dead. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Lucius,” said the specter, moving slowly towards Lucius. “Son.”</p><p> </p><p>The air around Abraxas carried a hint of smoke. Mystified by the familiarity of the scent and apparent shape-shifting magic of his father, Lucius stood rooted beside the foyer’s cold fireplace.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m alive, as you can see,” said the man that Lucius had mourned for a distinctly short period.</p><p> </p><p>“Father,” he finally replied, unclenching his jaw.</p><p> </p><p>“Are we to exchange pleasantries in the dark? Show me where you keep the whiskey.”</p><p> </p><p>There it was; the verbal lash. Lucius fought the urge to curl his lip. His father was a crude and thoroughly chilly individual.</p><p> </p><p>“Follow me,” he intoned, stiffly leading the other man to his study.</p><p> </p><p>With sharp flicks of his wand, Lucius lit the dark fireplace and summoned the serving tray. Abraxas’ gaze darted about the study as he accepted the glass of whiskey levitating towards him.</p><p> </p><p>“Drafty,” the older wizard muttered.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a dragon,” Lucius prompted. He wanted this riddle solved quickly. That his father lived was shock enough without the idea of him being a shape-shifter.</p><p> </p><p>“Weißer Drache. As are you, son.”</p><p> </p><p>“Auf Deutsch?” Lucius asked, heart skipping to hear his father name him a ‘white dragon.’</p><p> </p><p>“Ja, a few ancestors ago… You know, of course, that we’re an ancient family.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I believed us to be of French descent,” Lucius mused, sipping his whiskey. The burn of the alcohol down his throat warmed him to his toes. “Does Mother know?”</p><p> </p><p>“She did. But she believes me dead and I’d just as soon keep it that way.”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here, then?” Lucius asked.</p><p> </p><p>With an angry clink of his glass onto the table beside him, Abraxas gave an irritated sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I have a purpose here you ungrateful pup. You’re maturing and you must find your mate or you’ll live the rest of your days a dragon.”</p><p> </p><p>“My wife-”</p><p> </p><p>“Is she still such? I was under the impression she’d gone.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius pressed his lips together. Yes, Narcissa was gone.</p><p> </p><p>“Narcissa Black was chosen for you because we thought she might be a Weißer Drache with her coloring. Obviously, she’s not. She probably insn’t a Black. And she’s not your mate, either. She should have never been able to conceive and bear your child.”</p><p> </p><p>“We lost many,” Lucius murmurred, rapt with his father’s revelation.</p><p> </p><p>Abraxas nodded. “Only your mate may bear your child... I believe Narcissa used the darkest magics to give you one.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius’ gaze went hazy as he recalled the challenges they had faced and the care Narcissa had taken during her pregnancy. They had lost three unborn children before Draco. As well as one, after…</p><p> </p><p>“Even if you find your mate it’s unlikely you will father another. Our line only has one, apiece. Always a male. Always a Drache. However, the witch stole your rightful son from you and gave you only a wizard.”</p><p> </p><p>Mind swirling with the news, Lucius remained quiet. He knew better than to ask incessant questions of his father. Abraxas was not a sympathetic man but he wasn’t a liar. Lucius could only hide his emotions and wait for the man’s departure.</p><p> </p><p>“It was necessary I disappear when I did… When Mathilde lost another unborn, my grief was so great that I could not change back to a man for two years… She made up a story I died of Dragon Pox – ha!”</p><p> </p><p>For lack of wanting to converse, Lucius offered Abraxas more whisky. Abraxas shook his head.</p><p> </p><p>“…I dare not see her. She might not forgive me for having left. …I’ll be off, now. Returning to my sancuatry in the north. Find your mate – learn to control your change.”</p><p> </p><p>“If you’ve been watching you must know that I’m disgraced by society…” Lucius confessed.</p><p> </p><p>Abraxas huffed. “Think, boy. Is there no one who made your blood boil and stir at the same time? No one who you found equally alluring and infuriating?”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius’ hand rested thoughtfully on the whisky decanter. He <em>had</em> felt that particular combination. But, he could not remember for whom.</p><p> </p><p>“Best get out and socialize. Find her and make her yours. Soon. She’ll be the reason you become human, again. Trust me, you don’t want to live out your days in some magical zoo. You’re the last of our kind, now.”</p><p> </p><p>Overwhelmed by his father’s parting words, Lucius missed the man’s exit. It was no matter; Abraxas knew the manor.</p><p> </p><p>“Weißer Drache,” Lucius whispered to himself, settling the serving tray and hushing the fire.</p><p> </p><p>It explained a few things, actually. Lucius mounted the stairs, remembering how he lost his temper in the past and felt as though a bellows inside him was stoking fire in his chest. He worked hard to emotionally neuter himself.</p><p> </p><p>And, perhaps his current restlessness could now be explained. He needed to find his mate.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius finally slept, pondering where to begin the search.</p>
