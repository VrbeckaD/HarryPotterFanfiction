    <p>K so what if reginald took away vanyas powers and stuff but instead of being like ur worthless he just gave her gun and just left to her business and vanyas just ?? im fiv e ? ?? </p>
<p>So after reginald gives her the pills and all that he takes her out and brings her to his office and shes just s w e a t i n g beacuse uh<br/>She got locked in a box for a few days and was “Very Sick™”<br/>Getting called into her dads office is almost never a good thing</p>
<p>But instead of sitting down behind his desk like he usually does he takes her to a different corner of the room and starts diging through a drawer</p>
<p>Vanyas just patiently waiting like the Best Girl™ she is dont @ me. </p>
<p>Until he pulls out a gun. Then she starts panicking because oh no did she do something wrond is dad going to hurt her wh</p>
<p>And he stands up brushes his coat off hands her the gun and says “i suggest you learn quickly if you want to keep up with your siblings number seven.”</p>
<p>So she learns</p>
<p>Reginald programs mom to to teach cuz aint got time for children and set up a scedule like the rest of her siblings</p>
<p>Diego doesnt know how to feel about this,, i mean hes a knife person,, why would someone wants to use a gun,¿¿ but they get along more anyway cuz why not</p>
<p>Ben is mildy scared of her</p>
<p>For many reasons</p>
<p>Her and five are like besties by now beacuse ??math ?? yes?? Vanya uses math and crap to shoot beter and when five learns thsi hes just,, :00</p>
<p>So yeah vanya has a gun now</p>
<p>FEEL FREE TO ADD SUGGESTIONS!!!</p>
