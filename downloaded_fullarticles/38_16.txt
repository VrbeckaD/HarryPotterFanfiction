    <h5>Prologue</h5>
<p></p><div>
  <p>When a situation becomes unnecessarily complicated the body automatically enters a fight or flight mindset. However, after exhausting the first option, what do you do when you have nowhere to <em>flee</em> to? The same thoughts endlessly looped through his mind as he stared at the still body on the floor.</p>
  <p>The girl's pale skin contrasted sharply against the dark floor and her ginger hair made her appear to be burning.</p>
  <p>All in all, the image was entirely surreal. Like a scene from a fairy tale, she laid on the cold dungeon floor as though a princess waiting to be rescued from the evil warlock. Or she would have been if the bloody hero <strong>ACTUALLY. BOTHERED. TO. SHOW. UP</strong>. He huffed in frustration. Whatever happened to heroic courtesy?</p>
  <p>And he had been really looking forward to finally meeting the infamous boy wonder too. Still, he had to admit that the day wasn't completely wasted, he had achieved his initial goal. Acquiring a tangible body only out of life force and magic was nothing to scoff at, surely.</p>
  <p>And yet, ever since he heard about his supposed rival, the so-called saviour of the Wizarding world, he couldn't help but feel a burning desire to meet him. That feeling only intensified when he talked to (well, was written on - he did start as a diary) the wiz kid himself. He hadn't planned on talking to the boy. He couldn't believe his luck when instead of the usual ramblings of a love-struck pre-pubescent girl, the (Godawful really) writing of the chosen one appeared on his pages.</p>
  <p>And just like that his carefully thought out plans changed overnight.</p>
  <p>No longer did he care about ridding the school from mudbloods or slowly gaining enough life force until he no longer needed a host to possess, oh no, from now on it was all about the boy who lived - the famous Harry Potter, the sole being in known history who got hit with a killing curse and survived. Not only the boy managed to live when he was not supposed to but to also vanquish the most powerful dark Lord: Lord Voldemort (at least since Grindelwald - incredibly talented, incredibly strong, incredibly wasted potential). No one knew how exactly the Dark Lord was defeated, some speculate powerful offensive magic or maybe some form of magical defence? Either way, seeing as he was (is? Will be?) the Dark Lord, he felt justifiably invested in finding out how.</p>
  <p>However his hasty actions - forcing his vessel to kidnap herself in order to lure Potter, didn't really pay off.</p>
  <p>Potter didn't <em>show</em>.</p>
  <p>Instead, he was left alone standing in a disgusting dungeon with a corpse.</p>
  <p>And a ten-foot giant killer snake.</p>
  <p>
    <em>Bullocks.</em>
  </p>
  <p>The snake wasn't a problem (seeing as he was a parselmouth and could speak to snakes), and neither was the corpse really, the girl, his vessel was meant to die anyway. The problem laid in his next action. Which he hadn't come up with yet. The obvious choice would be to leave Hogwarts, the Wizarding school, in which he was currently located. The school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore has long since distrusted him. Ever since Dumbledore first met him in the orphanage and introduced magic to him, the headmaster (back then just a teacher) was constantly keeping an eye out on him. All things considered, Dumbledore wasn't exactly <em>wrong</em> in his suspicions, still practically stalking an underaged child was pushing past justifiable concern and into a creepy obsession.</p>
  <p>So getting out of Hogwarts was definitely a must.</p>
  <p>The act of sneaking out is relatively easy. All he had to do was to cast a minor glamour, even without a proper wand (all he had was the vessel's wand and in her place, he would've asked for a refund- was it a magical instrument or a muggle twig?) it would be incredibly simple. The hardship is to decide where to go next.</p>
  <p>Being an orphan he didn't have a lot of options, even in his own time, much less in the future where apparently he ended up as an evil overlord and <strong><em>died</em></strong>.</p>
  <p><strike>He supposed there was always his father’s Manor</strike> No, he couldn’t stay there and suffer the knowledge that his dirty muggle family lived there. That leaves only one more option. Tom sighed, wedged a small black diary (where he previously resided in) out of the girl’s clutched hands and ordered the snake to stay inside the chamber.</p>
  <p>It’s time to meet his current (future?) followers</p>
