  <strong>Bold - Hermione Granger</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Italics - Daphne Greengrass</em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Hi</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Who is this? Why have you charmed my paper into a message sheet? What do you want?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione Jean Granger, I love you. I have been in love with you for over 3 years now, and I can't take it anymore. I couldn't tell you before because of the war, so that's why I'm telling you this right now.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Who are you? Why are you trying to prank me? This is not funny.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm not pranking you. I'm being honest. I love you.</em>
</p><p><strong>I don't believe it. I won't believe it is anything but a prank, until you tell me who you are and show me</strong> <strong>that you actually love me.</strong></p><p>
  <em>Alright, I'll show you that I love you, but as for who I am. Find me. You're smart enough.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Why should I play your stupid game?</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Hello?</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Are you there?</strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Hi Granger.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>What do you want?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I knew you wouldn't throw away the sheet. You're just too curious. Haha. Anyways, open your bag.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>What? Why? I'm IN CLASS right now.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Oh, don't be such a prude. You're in History of Magic. Binns won't notice even if you hop on the table and strip to your undies. Actually, why don't you do that?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>NO!</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Then check your bag.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>But-</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Just check your bag already.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Fine… Why are there roses and chocolates in my bag?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Red Roses from the gardens in Switzerland, and Premium Pierre Marcolini Dark Chocolate from Brussels. Because I know how much you love Dark Chocolate and Muggle Brands.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>These must've cost a fortune.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>It's nothing in front of you. I love you Hermione Granger… So, do you believe me now?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Not in the slightest. I'm not even going to open these things before they go into trash.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>What? Why?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>They could've been charmed, or worse, cursed. I'm Hermione Granger, don't assume you could fool me that easily. And now I know something about you. You're either a Hufflepuff or a Gryffindor, and you're currently awake.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Of course, why would anything ever be easy with you? And you could be wrong. I could just know your schedule.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Shit.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Language. You're Hermione Granger. How can you say something like that?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Shut up.</strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>I love your outfit today. The green just brings out the gold in your eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Thank You.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>So you believe me?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Yes.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Would you believe me if I said I love you?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Of course not.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Of course you don't. Anyway, I was just thinking about what I said earlier.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>What about?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Oh nothing, just you, on a table… stripping.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Ugh...</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Then I started masturbating.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Eww, No… Fuck you.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>And I realized something.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>I really don't want to ask, but… What did you realize?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I realized that it aroused me more to think of you swearing than to think of you stripping.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Eww… Fu… Gross.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Thank You. I needed that.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>I hate you.</strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Granger.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Granger, are you there?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Granger why aren't you answering me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Graaaaaaaaaaanger</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione Jean Granger, you answer this message right now.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Okay, darling, time to turn it up a notch.</em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Hi</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>WHAT THE FUCK? When did you charm my History of Magic Parchment?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Not important.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>IT IS IMPORTANT! THESE ARE MY CLASS NOTES!</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>You didn't respond to my message.</em>
</p><p><strong>Why should I? You keep teasing me, you're going to prank me, and now all these messages have</strong> <strong>completely spoiled my class notes as well. Why should I keep replying to your messages?</strong></p><p>
  <em>Look I'll rewrite your notes for you. But just please reply to my messages. Just give me a chance. I know it seems like a prank to you, but there is still a chance that it's not. And would you be so cruel to ignore that possibility until you know it's not the case?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Fine. Now remove the charm on my class notes.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Okay.</em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong>Hey, my History of Magic notes are missing. Do you know something about that?</strong>
</p><hr/><p><strong>Hey… What do I call you? Anyways, you still haven't replied to me on the notes thing. Did you take</strong> <strong>them?</strong></p><hr/><p>
  <strong>Now look who isn't replying to messages.</strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Hi.</em>
</p><p><strong>FINALLY! You bitch about me not replying to YOUR messages. But you get to just randomly disappear for</strong> <strong>a week with no response whatsoever. Talk about double standards.</strong></p><p>
  <em>Sorry. I wa-</em>
</p><p><strong>Whatever, have you seen my History of Magic notes? They've been missing since the day you messed</strong> <strong>with them and now Professor Binns is about to enter any second and I DO NOT HAVE MY NOTES!</strong></p><p>
  <em>Yes, you do.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>No, I do not.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Have you checked your bag?</em>
</p><p><strong>So you did take my not-… these are not my notes… This is your handwriting. Wait, did you rewrite my</strong> <strong>notes for me?</strong></p><p>
  <em>Don't be silly Granger. I used something called my wand.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>I didn't find a single trace of magic on these notes.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I used a spell to hide the magic.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>And why would you do that?</strong>
</p><p>…</p><p><strong>See, I was right. Oh god, I can't believe you wrote all of these notes for me by hand. I spent nearly a</strong> <strong>month writing those and you wrote them for me in a week.</strong></p><p>
  <em>Granger.</em>
</p><p><strong>And so neatly as well. You are aware of the standards I uphold while writing my notes. I know your usual</strong> <strong>scribble, so I can see how much effort you put into this. But I could also recognize it as yours.</strong></p><p>
  <em>Granger.</em>
</p><p><strong>Although, I have to admit, your handwriting is quite elegant… and also quite feminine. Please don't take</strong> <strong>that as an insult. Many guys have elegant handwriting.</strong></p><p>
  <em>Granger, I think Binns must be inside the class by now.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Oh, right. And thank you for the notes.</strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong>Hey.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Hi.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>What happened, you disappeared for a week?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Is someone getting worried?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>I gave you a chance, I'd hate to see it getting wasted.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>You're just curious about my identity.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Of course not. You know I will find out who you are regardless of these stupid games you play.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Actually, I do not believe you can find me anymore.</em>
</p><p><strong>What? Why? I can search for a simpler solution but all I have to do is check every guy's handwriting in</strong> <strong>Hogwarts.</strong></p><p>
  <em>Still, I don't believe you'll ever find me.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Nonsense, I'm Hermione Granger, and I will find you. You can be sure of that.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>We'll see.</em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Hi</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Hey.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Open your bag.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Again! Why do you always do this in History of Magic?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Granger, I know you've read the textbook at least 3 times by now. You don't need to listen to class. And besides, History of Magic is the only class where I don't have to worry about someone peeping into the sheet or that the Professor would come and check your book. Merlin knows, if I get you in detention, I will never have a chance with you.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>You would do well to remember that.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Anyways, did you open your bag yet?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>A book. You got me a book. A bit of a cliché isn't it?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>It worked didn't it?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Only because it is quite rare to find a book on the early goblin wars of 322 AD. And in such condition too.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Good, I would've been really pissed if that didn't work. Even if it's a cliché to gift Hermione a book.</em>
</p><p><strong>Yeah, all Ron ever gets me for Christmas is Hogwarts: A History. I love him and all, but does he really</strong> <strong>think I'll want the exact same book 5 years in a row. And he doesn't even get me a limited edition or</strong> <strong>anything. It's the exact same book.</strong></p><p>
  <em>And he's supposed to be in love with you.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Apparently so.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>He's such an idiot.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Of course you'd say that. He's your rival.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>He's not worthy of being my rival. Is he?</em>
</p><p><strong>Who Ron? No. Contrary to what many people say and believe, including himself, I do NOT love him that</strong> <strong>way. He's too brother-like for me. And terrible at kissing.</strong></p><p>
  <em>He kissed you…</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Yes. Why? Does that bother you? Are you jealous?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes. Never kiss him again. Ever. In fact try and avoid him altogether. That'll make him understand that you don't see him that way.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Already tried that, he just thinks I'm playing hard to get.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>That annoying Weasel.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Well, what can you do?</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Hey.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Still there?</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Maybe not.</strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong>Hey you're not Draco Malfoy, are you?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Of course not, whatever gave you that idea?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>It's just… You seem to hate Ron… and you have quite an elegant handwriting.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>No, I'm not Draco Malfoy. Sorry to crush your dreams, sweetheart.</em>
</p><p><strong>No, you did not crush my dreams. In fact you saved them. I was starting to get worried that it might</strong> <strong>actually be him. That would be a nightmare.</strong></p><hr/><p>
  <em>Hi. You looked lovely today in that baby blue shirt and brown skirt.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Thank You.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>And did you trim your hair a little?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Yes, I did. I can't believe you noticed that. Even Ginny didn't at first.</strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong>WAS IT YOU? DID YOU DO SOMETHING TO RON?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Relax, I didn't do anything.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>YOU ATTACKED HIM!</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I did not, I bound him up with a body bind curse, and explained to him, very calmly might I add, that you are never going to be his girlfriend.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>But-</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Listen up Granger. I love you, and I just made him understand that. I didn't hurt him or threaten his life or any of the other things that you might imagine. I only wanted to talk to him. And you of all people know that he would not listen if you try and talk to him nicely.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>But-</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>And I don't trust you to be harsh, especially to him. So I took the task upon myself.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Fine.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm sorry. Some stuff just have to be done.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Now he's not talking to me either.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>He's a big boy. He'll get over it. And if he doesn't, you now know he's not fit to be your boyfriend.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>And you'll know that you won't have a chance anymore.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Fine…</em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong>Have you given up on me?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Not yet.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Then what is wrong? You haven't talked to me in two weeks.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Hello.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Nothing. Sorry, it's nothing.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Do you want to talk about it?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>It's nothing.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Please, tell me. Give me a chance. You'll feel better if you tell someone.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Fine. My mother… she… committed suicide.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Oh.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I shouldn't be feeling this way though. But for some reason… I can't stop the tears.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>What are you saying? She is your mother. Who would ever stop you from feeling sad about her death?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>If you knew who she was, you'd understand…</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>She was a death eater. Wasn't she?</strong>
</p><p>…</p><p><strong>But she's still your mother. And you should be allowed to feel sad for death, even if she wasn't the best</strong> <strong>person out there.</strong></p><p>
  <em>She was a fucked up person. Not only did she fuck her own life up, she also went and destroyed what little chance I had to keep living a normal life. How can you still say that about her?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Do you believe in what she did?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>No. Of course not. They were a bunch of idiots who-</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Then you have nothing to worry about.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>You know, when we were younger, around Christmas of our second year, I overheard someone say you were an angel. I didn't believe it then, but I do now. You really are an angel.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>You're joking.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Of course not, why else would I be in love with you?</em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <strong>Daphne?</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Daphne, why did you run from me?</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Daphne, please. Talk to me.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm sorry I will never ever dream of kissing you again. I'm sorry I ever bothered you. Goodbye Hermione.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>DAPHNE!</strong>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>You kissed me.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>You wouldn't listen to me otherwise.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>But-</em>
</p><p><strong>Listen to me. I like you and it doesn't matter if you're a death eater's daughter, or that you are a</strong> <strong>woman. I never thought there was anything wrong with that. The only thing that mattered to me was</strong> <strong>that you didn't agree with them and that you truly love me. So I'm willing to give it a chance. So next time,</strong> <strong>don't run from me when I kiss you.</strong></p><p>
  <em>There's going to be a next time?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Of course. In fact, as kisses go I kind of liked that one.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Hello?</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Are you doing a victory dance?</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Maybe…</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>You dork.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>So do you believe me now? Do you believe that I'm in love with you?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>Of course I do.</strong>
</p>
