    <p>Katerina Bellatrix Snape-Riddle-Lupin, was a Metamorphmagus. She was once known Harry Potter. That was after she got stolen from her parents Bellatrix Black and Remus Black. Her parents named him/her Antlia Regulus Black. She was Slytherin and Ravenclaw Heir.</p><p>She also has a familiar named Fawkes who is a phoenix that will take her though time, she will never have to worry about not understanding someone or something thanks to him.</p><p>Her mates just died during a huge war. She won the war to get revenge for her lovers. She was seventeen, her birthday was January 13th 1979.</p><p>Katerina had light brown hair that went past her lower back. She no longer needed glasses as she used a spell to fix her eyesight. She filled out the corset she always wore. She had fair skin, her eyes a deep blue that her mother had. No one could deny she was beautiful.</p><p>She also had a tattoo in memory of her lovers. The tattoo had the shape of a human heart over it, it had a cauldron over it in the middle it. Below the cauldron was a wolf laying there protecting it. A snake wrapped around the wolf and the cauldron. Finally, a rose wrapped around the entire thing with thorns protecting it. Below it had S.T.S. T.M.R.J. R.J.L. with 06:07:1996 as the date on it.</p><p>○○○○</p><p>"Where are we Fawkes?" Katerina asked.</p><p>"I could ask you the same thing." Regulus Black said. They were in the Black family home</p><p>"Katerina, this is my Phoenix Fawkes. You're Regulus Black and this is your family home. The real question is what year is it?" She said.</p><p>"1979, February 7th." He said.</p><p>"Well, that saves me a lot of trouble. I go by many names as I'm a Metamorphmagus. You only know me by one, it's Antlia Regulus Black."</p><p>"So you're my child?" Regulus asked.</p><p>"Yup, I just finished a great war. I hope you'd be proud of me. I never knew you. Antlia will be stolen, when she's sixteen she will reconnect with Bella and now I'm 17 and I've lost everything I have ever known. I'm glad I met you. I love you. I know that may not be to much for you."</p><p>"No matter what I'll always be proud of you no matter what form you take." He said.</p><p>"Here take this, it's my memories. You deserve to know your child." She said as she pulled the memory out of her temple and give them to him.</p><p>"Aren't you afraid of changing everything you know?" He asked her.</p><p>"Maybe, I'll change a few things. But I know no matter what my past happened the same way. When I arrive and it isn't the same it won't matter. I'll still leave to go on this quest." She said.</p><p>"Here, you deserve to know me too. No matter what I'm proud of you." He said. He took his memories and connected them to her head. "Just know no matter what has or will happen I'm proud of you."</p><p>"Thank you dad. I'm sad I'll never know you until now." She said. "Maybe I'll stop by again, I don't know what my future hold though.</p><p>○○○○</p><p>"Who are you?" A young Severus said. She looked around and saw the two beds, he must be in fifth year.</p><p>"Is it before or after OWLs for you?" She asked as she sat down on his bed.</p><p>"I'm a seventh year." He said.</p><p>"Oh, sorry I forgot. I really should've known better. So before or after NEWTs?"</p><p>"It's Christmas break. As you can see I'm the only one here." He said. His wand was still trained on her. She didn't mind though.</p><p>"Well, Severus, I'm Katerina." She said.</p><p>"That cannot be your full name." He said.</p><p>"Katerina never had a last name. Although I did take my lovers last names." She said.</p><p>"What happened to them?" He asked now sitting next to her.</p><p>"I failed them. We were in this huge battle. We outnumber the other side completely. Someone on the other side was aiming to kill, something we didn't expect. <em>He</em> had to kill them. We were going to have a family after the war. I was going to protect them. I failed them." She said, she took a deep breath trying to calm herself, she was surpised when he put his arms around hsr.</p><p>"I don't think you failed them. You didn't kill them. You're obviously a time traveler. why did you come see me?"</p><p>"You were special to me before I left." She said.</p><p>"How so?" He asked.</p><p>"You wouldn't believe me, you were one of my lovers." She said.</p><p>"One of them?" He asked her.</p><p>"I had three lovers. I won't tell you who the other two are. Though we were all together. They will/did, love you too. You'll have happiness. You deserve all of that." She said.</p><p>"What's that?" He asked at the tattoo on her arm. Her corsets never had sleeves so it was in the open.</p><p>"It's in memory of them, they died. I know they were happy. I got revenge on their killer. I still failed them, you and the others."</p><p>"Is this the day I will die?" He asked as he saw the day. After the three sets of initials there was 06:07:1996</p><p>"Yes." She said.</p><p>"And someone as pretty as you love me?" He asked.</p><p>"Yes, Severus Snape. You deserve all the happiness I can give you. I didn't look like this when I met you. I'm Metamorphmagus, though I didn't know it at the time. I was so naive. You'll fall in love with him, and one day he'll be delirious, you'll be watching him and he'll confess to you. Don't worry about finding me, it will happen, I'll find you." She said.</p><p>"Why don't you stay for a bit, eat, sleep. Maybe shower." He said.</p><p>"I'll go take a shower then, would you like to join me?" She asked. She was happily surpised when he nodded. She made her way into the showers off the dorm.</p><p>"That was my dorm room when I was in Slytherin. That was the best year of my life." She said.</p><p>"All the boy's dorms are on this side."</p><p>"Yes, but girls can choose to be in the same dorm as a boy. He was a good friend, it's funny to think he was once my enemy. Sorry I'm getting off track. I was loyal to my mates and never will be with anyone else." She said.</p><p>"We died, we would want you happy. If you find some one again, be with them. I want you to be happy, and we wouldn't ask you to be alone forever, wizards and witches live for a really long time." He said. "And maybe we didn't really die. I couldn't say, but that bird of yours can. I have a feeling you have a few places to be before you find them again."</p><p>••••</p><p>"Here, before I go, I want you to have it. It's my memories, all of them including you. I want to show you that you'll be loved no matter what. You are my world. No matter what you do I love you and I will be proud of you, I was always the most protective of you." She said as she handed him her memories. She gave him a small kiss on his lips. "You're beautiful too, Severus."</p><p>"I'll miss you, I guess I'll see you in the future?" He asked.</p><p>"Of course you will."</p><p>○○○○</p>
