    <p>Remus Lupin had been just a boy when he had been bitten. It was late afternoon, and he was walking the three blocks home from school when he had been grabbed from behind. Two strong hands gripped his shoulders, and yanked him off his feet into the alley. Remus opened his mouth to cry for help, but someone stuffed a dirty rag into his mouth and muffled the sound. His taste buds recoiled at the foreign intrusion; it tasted oily, like gasoline. His abductor pulled a black canvas bag over his head. He could hear voices behind him. It sounded like there were no more than two people.<br/>
“We got ‘im. It's the Lupin kid, ain't it?” The first man spoke in a deep, gravelly voice.<br/>
“Yeah, it's him. Greyback’s gonna be happy. This one’s bastard father has been causing him a helluva lot of trouble. This'll shut ‘em up.” The second one drawled. Lupin struggled and lashed out, and he felt his foot collide with something squishy. “Ow! You little prick! Tie em up!” The deep voice snapped.<br/>
***
“No!” Lupin tried to shout, but it came out as a muted yelp instead. Ropes cinched down around his ankles, keeping him from striking out again. The same happened to his hands, which were bound painfully tight in front of his chest. He whimpered shrilly through his teeth as the coils of rope burned at his soft wrists, rough and tight. He wriggled, trying to worm his way out of his bindings, feeling the rope rub his skin raw.<br/>
“Damn, this one’s a little fighter. He’ll make a good packmate one day.” Chuckled the man with the deep voice. “Toss him in the back. I don't think anyone saw us.”<br/>
Packmate? Lupin thought, head spinning. What do they mean? What’s happening to me? Who are these people? What do they want with my dad?<br/>
Lupin felt his feet leave the ground as one of the men lifted him into the air. He kicked and punched with his bound limbs, hoping to break something important, but had no such luck. He hit the grimy floor of the van with a loud thud. He heard the doors slam, and the engine start.<br/>
The spluttering of the engine made it impossible to hear what his captors were talking about. I have to count. That's what dad said. If anyone ever took me, count the seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… many minutes passed by Lupin lay still in the back of the vehicle. Every bump jostled him, every turn rolled him back and forth. Six thousand and twelve, six thousand and thirteen six thousand and fourteen, six thousand and fifteen, six thousand and sixteen, six thousand and seventeen.<br/>
The vehicle stuttered to a stop. I wonder why they’re using a muggle vehicle? They know who my father is, so they have to be wizards. Remus thought. The engine went quiet, and the floor stopped vibrating. Remus let out a sigh of relief despite himself. The ride had been painful, jostling him over uneven roads with sharp, swerving turns. His whole body hurt, and there would surely be bruises blooming over his shoulder and the parts of his limbs that had been slammed against the inside of the trunk. Someone wrapped their hands around his ankles, roughly pulling him out of the vehicle. He fell to the ground, sharp pebbles and irritating specks of dirt rubbing against the chafing wounds on his wrists. Pain shot up his arm as he landed on it, and he whimpered weakly. Is my arm broken? Remus worried, but he didn’t have the chance to think about it for too long.<br/>
“Stand up, boy!” the second voice, which Remus had decided to call Growler, ordered gruffly. Remus twitched feebly, but made no attempt to stand up.<br/>
“I said, STAND!” Growler snarled. He roughly nudged Remus’s stomach with the toe of his boot. Remus curled himself into a tiny little ball, pulling his knees up to his chin in the fetal position.<br/>
“Do I gotta do everything around here?” Growler whined. “Get. Up!” Remus felt the man’s meaty hand reach around his tiny bicep and yank him upright. Remus squeaked in pain, but the sound was clipped by the chemical-soaked rag in his mouth.<br/>
“Alright, in we go.” Growler dragged Remus forward, “get the door would ya mate?” He asked.<br/>
“Sure.” The other responded. Remus heard the screech of rusted metal on metal coming from in front of him.<br/>
“Get in there. Greyback will be here soon.” Growler clapped him on the back, sending him stumbling blindly forwards. He barely caught himself in time to prevent falling. Someone else entered behind him.<br/>
“I'm gonna tie you to the chair, and if you cooperate I'll take the hood and gag out. Clear?” Remus nodded timidly, trembling. He was led to a chair and shoved down in it. He felt his hands being untied, sighing in relief at the release of pressure on his wrists, but the respite was short-lived. They were clipped into a pair of handcuffs which were bolted into the underside of a metal table. He whimpered when Growler tightened them, the metal stinging his wrists where the ropes had excoriated them. His feet were unbound and tied to the chair legs.<br/>
Growler untied and pulled the bag off his head. Remus kept his eyes closed. He didn't want to see where he was. He hoped against hope that in a few minutes he would wake up, that his father would pull him into a hug and tell him it was all just a dream. The gag was yanked out of his mouth. Remus spat on to the table, swishing at the roof of his mouth with saliva, trying to clear the acrid chemical stink from his tongue. His tongue felt dry, the rag had soaked up most of the liquid in his mouth. His lips had dried on the ride over and his throat was parched from the chemical filth of the rag.<br/>
***
“Don't try anything stupid. Greyback will be here in a bit.” Growler’s voice echoed in the small metal box. Remus heard his footsteps receding out the door. He nearly fainted from fear when the door slammed suddenly behind him.<br/>
Remus slowly opened his eyes. The room he was in was dimly lit, but it was still brighter than what he had been used to for the past hour and a half. He blinked a few times to help his eyes adjust to the new light. He looked around, and it was almost precisely what he had pictured: a barren room, with nothing but a table with a chair at either end. There were no cuffs attached to the other chair.<br/>
Remus waited.<br/>
Six thousand and seventeen. Six thousand and seventeen. Six thousand and seventeen seconds away from home. I can't do this. I want my dad. Why is it so scary? Why won't I wake up? I'm so thirsty, my throat hurts so much, Daddy come save me! Six thousand and seventeen seconds away from home. Remus’ thoughts were a frantic, desperate squall. He put his cheek down on the cold metal table, bowing his head. He was facing the door, so if someone came in, he would know. A few more minutes passed by.<br/>
The door opened with a bang, all but flying off its hinges. Remus’ eyes opened wide, in time to see two men who had to be Growler and Deep Voice kicked through it by a third. Remus closed his eyes and ducked under the table as best he could. His heart kickstarted into panic mode, he could feel it pounding frantically in his chest. The blood rushed in his ears. Who is he? What's he doing? Is he going to hurt me? DAD! Remus’s thoughts became ever more jumbled as the strange man approached. Sixthousandandseventeensixthousandandseventeensixthousandseventeensixthousandandseventeensixthousandandseventeen. Remus was jerked out his thoughts. The third man who had come into the room behind the other two gently placed his hand on Remus’s shoulder.<br/>
“Remus? Are these the two men who brought you here?” He asked quietly, voice uncannily tender for a someone who had just booted two fully grown men through a doorway. Remus nodded, his whole body shaking. “Thank you. I'll be back in a moment, just let me take care of them.” The third man squeezed Remus’ shoulder as he lifted his hand and walked towards Growler and Deep Voice.<br/>
“JOEY, MIKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?!” The third man roared. Remus peaked up from where he was hiding his head. The third man was considerably larger than Joey and Mike, although they were a bit above average themselves in the size department, the third man towered over them. He was also built like a brick house, with a neck like a tree trunk and burly, corded limbs. And yet… his touch had been soft? How could a man like that, who was built to be rough, be so… gentle?<br/>
The man grabbed Growler, who Remus assumed was actually Joey, by the neck and hoisted him into the air with one powerful arm. Joey wriggled and squirmed, clawing in vain at the new man’s hand, “What the hell were you thinking??” The largest man snarled, “He’s a boy, not a man! He’s not his father! I told you to pick him up and bring him here, not torture the poor boy!” He threw Joey to the side where he rolled to a stop against the wall, Joey clutched at his throat, his chest heaving as his breath came in agonized gasps.<br/>
“I just,” he wheezed, “thought,” he sucked in another breath, “that was what you meant.” he coughed harshly. “Sir.” Joey slumped down on to his shoulder, still gasping for air.<br/>
“No matter.” the man muttered. “I’ll deal with you two later.” Joey and Mike scrambled towards the door. The man they called Greyback slammed it behind them. He turned to walk towards where Remus was sitting. The poor door must have had enough. It collided with the frame, and rather than stopping in the grooves, it broke clean off its hinges and flew out the other side. Judging by the muffled screaming coming from outside where the door had once been, Mike and Joey had not managed to outrun the heavy steel door.<br/>
The man glanced at Remus apologetically. “Just a second.” he swung back around, and stepped carefully outside the ruined doorframe. Remus gazed out the hole the door had left in the wall. The sun was close to going down, perhaps another hour until sunset. The man walked over to where the door had landed on top of Joey and Mike. He stared down with disdain at the metal door, as if by falling off its hinges it had severely disappointed him. He bent down and grasped the door with one hand, lifting it easily off of Joey and Mike. Remus heard them gibbering muffled apologies and thanks.<br/>
The man ignored them and marched back to the room where Remus was sitting. He tilted the door so that it would fit through the frame. With both hands, he fitted it back into the hinges. The door squealed in protest, “that's the third time this week you’ve done that. Seriously. It hurts you know, getting ripped off your hinges!”<br/>
“Quiet Janet, we have guests.” the man walked to where Remus was sitting. He shrunk back in fear, worrying that maybe this man was going to hurt him as well.<br/>
“Here, let me un-cuff you. Those barbarians don’t know what they are doing, I am so sorry for how they treated you. My name is Fenrir, but you can just call me Fenn, everyone here who’s like you calls me that.” He unclipped the handcuffs from Remus’s wrists. Remus silently rubbed the two sore spots the bindings had left. He did not look up from the spot on the table he had been staring at.<br/>
“Daddy says I shouldn’t talk to strangers.” Remus mumbled.<br/>
“I’m not a stranger, I’m your new pack alpha, and when you grow up a bit, you’re gonna be my right hand man.” Fenn ruffled Remus’ hair. He walked to the other side of the table and pulled the chair from underneath. He twisted it around, so the back was leaning against the table edge. Fenn sat down, he placed his elbows on the table and laced his fingers together.<br/>
“Tell me Remus, has your father said anything about what he’s going to be doing later?” he asked softly.<br/>
Recognition and understanding dawned on Remus. It’s Fenrir Greyback, he's the one who dad’s been trying to catch. Daddy says he’s the worst kind, that h-he likes you-know-who. Remus glanced up to where Greyback was sitting. “Excuse me, Mr. Fenn, could I go home now?” Remus asked politely.<br/>
“Why would you want to go back there?” Greyback asked. “You have everything you could ever want or need right here.”<br/>
“I miss my parents.” Remus’ voice broke on the last word.<br/>
“You miss the mother who spends all her time working a muggle job because she brought shame to her American pureblood family by marrying a half blood? She has no time for you, she doesn’t care about you. All the other kids have their parents walk them home from school. Yours obviously don’t. You miss your father? The man who sometimes comes home, but barely ever because all he focuses on is his job and hurting innocent people like me? It would be better for you if you came to live with us, in the pack.” by this time, Remus had started to cry. His chest heaved and shook, and his breath came in large gasps. Tears leaked out of his eyes, Remus just managed to shout something before the coughing took over. “I-” he wheezed. “WANT” he coughed again “MY PARENTS!”<br/>
Greyback growled, “I am your new parent now. You answer to me. You will never see Charles John Lupin or Cara Amelia Adams again! Your name is not Lupin, it is Greyback! Tonight, you will be turned, and you will become a member of The Pack.” He stood suddenly, and without a backward glance, Greyback stormed out of the room. He ripped open the door, which barely hung on to its hinges.<br/>
“Nox. ” he flicked his wand behind his back. The door slammed shut behind him, and the room was plunged into darkness.<br/>
Remus whimpered. He was afraid of the dark, and afraid of what was going to happen tonight. I want my parents, sixthousnd and seventeen, I’ve got to get home. Six thousand and seventeen, you can do this Remus. He thought to himself.<br/>
“J-Janet? I-is that your name?” his voice shook.<br/>
“Yes dear. I’m sorry about Fenn, he gets mad sometimes. What can I do for you?” the disembodied female voice asked.<br/>
“C-can you turn the lights back on? P-please?” Remus asked hopefully.<br/>
“Honey, I’m a ghost. I can’t do magic anymore. But maybe my spectral form can provide you with some comfort. Are you okay if I materialize in front of you?” The voice sounded like it was closer to him.<br/>
“Y-yeah, that’s okay. Thanks.” Remus responded. His voice had nearly stopped shaking.<br/>
“Alright, close your eyes. I’ll tell you when it's okay to open ‘em.” she sounded like she was standing right in front of him, which seemed impossible since there was a table there. Remus waited a minute.<br/>
“You can open up now, I’m right in front of you.” Remus opened his eyes. Sitting on top of the table in front of him was a girl. She looked no older than 16. Her face was long and pointy, but framed well by shoulder length, straight, purple hair. She had big, bedroom eyes, which appeared to be a greenish blue. The girl had a small pointy nose, and a cupid’s bow down to thin pink lips. She was skinny, unhealthily so. Her bones stuck out in odd angles, and her skin barely stretched over her collarbones. Her clothing was loose fitting on her, but on a normal girl her size it would be considered too tight. Her whole form glowed, the light comforted Remus who was deathly terrified of the dark.<br/>
“My name’s Janet, Janet Louise Murray. Who are you?” she stuck out one spectral, bony hand.<br/>
“I’m Remus, Remus John Lupin. Nice to meet you.” he stuck his hand out to grasp hers, but his fingers clasped around cold, empty air. It sent a small shiver up his spine, and he twitched.<br/>
“Right, sorry. It’s easy to forget sometimes that I’m not… well, I’m not human anymore.” she brought her hand back to lie in her lap.<br/>
“That’s okay. Thanks for coming out to talk to me.” he smiled weakly at her. And, as most nine year olds would, he asked the first question that popped into his head. “How did you die?”<br/>
“Oh um, I don't really like to think about that much. But since you asked, I guess I’ll tell you.” she paused.<br/>
“I’m so sorry! I didn’t know. You don’t have to tell me if you don't want to.” Remus apologized.<br/>
“No, it’s okay, I’ll tell you.” she took a deep breath in. “I was taken from my home just like you were, but I was the first. They hadn’t perfected the process of turning yet. I was their test subject. My mom, Capella, she was responsible for putting Greyback behind bars the first time see, and when he got out, he was not happy. So he took me as retaliation. I got put in here, and was chained to the wall. When the full moon came ‘round, it had been weeks. They gave me some food and water, but barely any. That night, they all came into the room where I was. The moon turned them. One of them bit me. Then another, and another and another, and then suddenly I was watching my body get torn to pieces by the wolves. I don’t really remember my last moment, other than that it hurt. A lot.” she looked down at her hands, fiddling with her skirt.<br/>
“I’m so sorry that happened to you.” Remus whispered. “Would you like to be friends?” Remus asked.<br/>
“Yeah!” Janet replied enthusiastically, he face fell a second later. “But, I can never leave here… unless…” she paused a moment. “Are you able to go to the right corner of the room? I’ll guide you to exactly where.” she pepped up.<br/>
“Yeah, I can drag the chair with me.” Remus stood. His feet were still bound to the chair, but he could move in little steps. He shuffled behind Janet to the corner of the room.<br/>
“There it is, my necklace. I need you to pick it up and put it on.” Remus felt around in the corner. The light from Janet was not enough for him to see the corner very clearly. His hand brushed a tattered cloth, it was stiff and rough under his fingers. The edges were frayed and torn, he lifted it out of the way, choosing not to think about what it could be. He felt a small, cold metal chain under his pinkie finger. Remus scooped it up with his hand and held it up to his face. It was a simple silver chain with a small anchor pendant dangling at the bottom. Long dried blood clung to parts of the chain and anchor.<br/>
“You can wash it off later, but put it on and I’ll be able to leave with you.” Janet smiled at him encouragingly.<br/>
“Why did Greyback take you?” Remus dropped the chain over his head, the pendant settled in front of his neck. “I know why I was taken, cause my dad’s gonna put Greyback behind bars.”<br/>
“Well, my reason is quite similar to yours I explained a little bit of it earlier.” she floated next to him as he shuffled back to the table. My mom, Capella, she put Greyback in jail the first time around. The day he got out, he took me and well, you know what happened next. Both my moms were devastated when he got out on a technicality. Jamie, my other mom, she was the auror who had captured Greyback’s son. He’s still in prison I think. I miss my parents a lot.”<br/>
She paused. Remus stated to give her a response, but she held up her finger to silence him. “Shh, someone’s coming.” Janet vanished, the room went dark, but only for a moment. The door swung open a second later, Joey and Mike pushed their way into the room. Joey unclipped Remus’ feet from the chair.<br/>
“Where are you taking me?” Remus whimpered.<br/>
“Shh it’s alright, Remus.” Janet’s disembodied voice whispered in his ear.<br/>
“You’re going to get turned. Don't worry, it don’t hurt too bad.” Joey gruffly stated, yanking Remus up by the armpits. “Don’t struggle, and I won’t throw you over my shoulder.” he roughly gripped Remus’s arm, pulling him towards the door. Remus forced his feet to follow, he stumbled along a few steps behind Joey. Remus felt Joey throw him forward out the door. He stumbled and fell into the dirt ground outside the little room.<br/>
“Get up kid.” Joey growled. “I ain’t got time for games.” Remus slowly stood, brushing the dirt off his clothes.<br/>
“This way.” Joey steered him towards another building. This one was much larger than the original room he had been held in, but like the other one, there were no windows and only one door. “The Pack is waiting for you.” Mike opened the door for them.<br/>
Remus hardened his resolve. Squaring his shoulders, he wiped his face of all emotion. “That’s the way Remus, don’t let them see you cry. ” Janet whispered, he felt a cold presence brush through his hand. Remus straightened and curled his fingers ever so slightly inside the cold spot. He looked over his shoulder and saw Janet floating next to him, he turned his gaze down to his hand and saw her ghostly one clasped in his. Even in the dying sunbeams, her hair still glowed. It radiated a warm purple light, almost like a halo. She smiled at him weakly. “Be brave little one.” Joey pushed Remus into the dark room.<br/>
If anyone had looked at this scene, they would have seen a small, nine year old holding hands with no one. But Minerva McGonagall was not no one. Cats can see things most humans cannot, and she saw a small, 16 year old girl comforting Remus. She was here for one purpose, to rescue Remus. His father had called her when Remus had not returned from school that day, Minerva had scanned for his scent and enlisted Kingsley Shacklebolt to help her rescue the boy from Greyback after his scent had led them to a dark alley. And now, they were here. Waiting for the correct moment to attack.<br/>
A werewolf is weakest when it's transforming. They would strike when the moon rose. Minerva and Kingsley waited, patiently watching the door, preparing a plan of attack. She would stupify the guards, then petrify Greyback and take Remus and his ghostly friend out of the compound and to safety. Meanwhile, Kingsley would defend her from behind in his animagus form, a lynx, and distract them as they made their exit.<br/>
Kingsley had always been one of McGonagall’s favorites at Hogwarts, and her most recent animagus student. He was good with his wand, and generally a strong wizard. Greyback had killed his werewolf friend who had refused his offer to join The Pack once they had graduated, so Kingsley had a personal bone to pick with him. Exactly why Minerva had chosen him.<br/>
Remus blinked a few times, allowing his eyes to adjust to the dim light. It was much darker in here than it had been outside. What he saw almost made him turn tail and run, but Janet caught his scared, amber eyes with her own, giving him a reassuring glance. In front of him was a long warehouse full of hundreds of men and women who were, presumably werewolves.<br/>
“Did your dad tell you to count? My moms did. How many seconds away from home are you?” Janet soothed, “Don’t stop, no, never stop repeating that number until it’s zero.”<br/>
“Six thousand and seventeen.” Remus whispered.<br/>
“Good, just focus on that.” Remus followed Janet’s advice. He repeated the number over and over, ignoring the shouted slurs and swears, ignoring the droplets of beer and spit that landed on him as he walked through the warehouse.<br/>
They reached the end, Remus kept whispering the number to himself. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Greyback stand, heard words come out of his mouth, but none of them registered in his head. He repeated the number over and over as they strung him up. He felt them clip the cuffs to his hands and feet, felt the tug from the ropes as they hoisted him into the air. There he waited, all while saying the number to himself and Janet.<br/>
He shut his eyes, he didn’t want to see the transformation. He heard them growling, howling, their bones cracking and reforming. And he waited for the bite. But it never came. Instead, Remus heard a loud bang emanate from the direction from which he had come. Remus didn’t stop whispering the number though, he did as Janet had said, focus on the number, nothing else.<br/>
***
Remus heard the howls increase around him, he cracked one of his eyes open and looked in the direction of the noise. His eyes widened in surprise. He stopped his repetition of the number when he saw Minerva McGonagall marched through the chaos, petrifying wolves right and left. Not a single one landed a blow on her person.<br/>
Behind her, a silver lynx grappled with the ones who tried to sneak up and attack from behind. He killed each and every one that tried to harm Minerva with one smooth motion. The lynx surged upwards, ripping their white skin with his needle-like claws, then tore out their throats with his jagged teeth. He let their bodies fall where they had stood, necks spurting blood like lopsided fountains, spraying his front with red. His whole face, chest and belly were soaked with their blood. But he didn’t seem to mind. The lynx grinned savagely, one of the wolves’ bloody, severed windpipes still clenched in between his red tinged teeth. Blood dripped from his jaws to the fast growing puddle surrounding his blood-stained paws. His eyes were alight with glee.<br/>
The lynx spat out the werewolf gore and leapt on to the next one’s back. He sunk his teeth into the back of its neck. The wolf screamed in pain and dropped to all fours. He whipped his head back and forth, taking out the soft skin behind the throat, leaving the spine exposed. Blood spritzed from the wound, spraying into the lynx’s eyes. He blinked, then tore out the werewolf’s spine. It collapsed on to its stomach, its eyes frantically flitting back and forth, the rest of its body, completely paralyzed. The lynx dropped the gory spine in the growing pile of blood and vitals. He yowled triumphantly, then vaulted to his next target.<br/>
Remus looked away, as much as he hated the wolves, he couldn’t watch this happen. Greyback jumped from the ground and severed the cords that were suspending with his claws, dropping Remus to the ground in a heap. He loosed a bloodcurtling scream as he fell. Greyback sunk his teeth into the soft skin on Remus’s neck, Remus opened his mouth in a wordless cry for help. The pain paralyzed his voice and body. Greyback shook him as if he were a rabbit. Pain blurred his vision, he could hear nothing but the blood rushing in his ears.<br/>
***
Remus felt his body drop to the ground. He opened his eyes wide, seeing the ghostly form of Janet leaning over him. Her lips were moving, but he could not make out what she was saying. Remus gave in to the heavy feeling in his eyelids, letting them close and roll back into his head.<br/>
“Hello Remus.” Remus opened his eyes. His surroundings were pitch black, he was sitting on what felt like cold metal, but when he looked down, he was met with the same inky blackness. He pushed himself to his feet, standing slowly in case he fell back down. His legs felt weak, and his whole body was fatigued. He blinked a few times, trying to work out where the voice had come from.<br/>
“Janet?” Remus asked hopefully, turning around as he spoke.<br/>
“Indeed.” she smiled at him. Janet stepped closer to Remus. He reached out for her, remembering too late that she was a ghost. But instead of his hand floating through empty space, it connected with warm, solid skin.<br/>
“Janet--” He trailed off.<br/>
“Here in the World Between, I have form, and a body. It’s where spirits are anchored. We may visit the World Below, the World Under, and the World Above when we please, but we are weaker there then we are here.” she wrapped her arms around him, pulling him into chest in a tight hug.<br/>
“Why am I here?” Remus asked softly.<br/>
“Because your spirit is between the world below and the World Above. It has not decided whether it wishes to stay or leave.”<br/>
“Why aren’t you in the World Above? Why are you in the World Between?” Remus inquired.<br/>
“I chose to stay in the World Below, even when my spirit had already left my body. It was because I had wanted to try and find my parents. I found out soon after that I couldn’t leave the place where I had died. I wasn’t and still am not strong enough to move things in the World Below. When spirits become strong enough, they can move the object they are tied to that keeps them in one place. The older a spirit becomes, the stronger it is.” she frowned. “But you my friend, you must make a choice. Will you choose to fight for your place in the World Below, or will you go up?” Janet pulled away from their embrace. She held him at arm’s length, looking him in the eye.<br/>
“I want to be with my parents again.” Remus murmured.<br/>
“Then fight.” Janet pulled him into another hug. “It’s time for you to leave here. Go, see what the world has to offer. I’ll be there with you. Don’t worry.”<br/>
“Thanks Janet. I will.” He squeezed her once, but her body was already fading. She chuckled softly. White light filled the space. Remus closed his eyes to defend against the brightness of it. </p>
