</p><p> </p><p>A 5 year old boy with untidy black hair , bright green eyes and a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead sat in his cupboard under the stairs. He is small and skinny for his age with a thin face and body full of scars and bruises.</p><p> </p><p>He only knows his first name a week ago, Harry , his aunt had to answer her friends question during a tea party when they spotted harry trying to sneak back into his cupboard after finishing his chores in the backyard. Not wanting to embarrass herself, Petunia explained his existence and Harry got to know his name after 5 years of ‘Boy’ or ‘Freak’.</p><p> </p><p>It was 9pm and he just got a scolding from the Dursley for trying to secretly watch the telly. His efforts though was useless and Vernon spotted him.</p><p> </p><p>“Boy! You get back into your cupboard now! You useless freak are not allowed to watch the telly!”</p><p>“But..but..uncle, can I just watch it for 5 minutes?” Harry said, looking up to the whale of an uncle with wide pleading green eyes. “ I’ve already finished cleaning up the kitchen and I’ve done all of my chores-”</p><p>“No! You ungrateful freak! I’ve already sacrificed enough for you! I’ve given you a place in my home and food and clothes and you dare to ask for more?!” Vernon smacked his face and while pulling his ear, dragged him back to his cupboard. “ Now you stay there and keep your freakishness out of my sight you hear me?! “ pushing harry in roughly and locking the cupboard.</p><p> </p><p>Nursing his injuries, harry can only sit there and stifle his sobs, not wanting to draw more of his uncles fury. He lay down on his makeshift bed consisting of all of his ragged hand me downs clothes from his cousin, Dudley , and pull a thin old blanket over himself. He pulled a stuffed teddy bear from a hidden compartment at the back of the cupboard and hugged it.</p><p> </p><p>The teddy is his only possession and he found the teddy a year ago inside the trash can a few houses over, he was busy weeding the lawn and saw the teddy while he went to throw out all the weeds. It was an old teddy, it was missing an eye and a right leg , it was originally a dark brown colour but now its nearly cream-coloured with odd patches of brown ,but to harry it was his treasure and his only friend.</p><p> </p><p>After much washing-secretly without his aunt or uncle noticing-using the hose in the front lawn, harry got it as clean as it can be and stashed it in his cupboard. Since then he always talk to his teddy before he goes to bed or whenever he is in the cupboard.</p><p> </p><p>“Teddy, my body hurts so much!” hiding his face in the teddy’s tummy.</p><p>“Why is my uncle so mad at me teddy? Am I a bad boy? But I did all the chores teddy, I didn’t even eat anything today teddy, I did everything on the list teddy” harry mumbled into teddy’s tummy while sniffling.</p><p>“Tonight is going to be my birthday teddy, I’m going to be 6 years old now, I know nobody really cares except you teddy and I just..I just wish…that I can go somewhere else , someplace far away from here..” Harry’s eye widened and he quickly pull up teddy and look him face to face “Of course you are coming with me teddy! I will never forget about you! We’ll go somewhere nice and live with a real family that will loves us and tucks us to bed and read us a bedtime story and gives us a kiss and…and…I wish it will come true.”</p><p> </p><p>With the sounds of the telly and the occasional comment from his aunt or uncle and his cousin, harry closed his eyes and went to sleep dreaming of a future life without the grasp of his aunt’s family.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Harry woke up from his restless sleep, blinking up to the ceiling of his small bedroom in privet drive.</p><p>‘Well that was a very weird dream or is it a memory…?’. He sat up and rubbed his eyes, put on his glasses and looked at the clock and noticed the time,</p><p>‘ half an hour before I’m officially 16.’</p><p>Harry fell into an exhausted sleep around 10pm after he was done with the backyard.</p><p>‘Uh, my body hurts though, guess all that weeding packs a nasty punch! A pain reliever potion would be nice right about now’.</p><p>Stifling a yawn , Harry looked up just in time to see Hedwig came flying to his window. He got up and open the window to let her in.</p><p>Hedwig landed on his shoulder and hooted a greeting.</p><p>“Hello there girl, what do you have there for me?”</p><p>Hedwig hooted again and outstretched her leg for harry to untie the letters. Harry did just that and after nibbling on harry’s unruly hair she flew to her perch and start eating the owl snacks there.</p><p>Shrugging , Harry sat down on his bed and opened up the letters.</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>He folded the letter and put it on the table beside his bed and lay down on the bed.</p><p>‘Now that is a lot to take in, I’m filthy rich but I’m still living with my horrid muggle family and slept in a cupboard for 10 years and now ,in this tiny bedroom, wearing old unwanted hand me downs of Dudley and I am barely being fed.’ He can only smile sadly. Harry decided to not think about the letter and put it at the back of his mind for later.</p><p> </p><p>For the past 16 years, he’s been through so much pain. His body is full of scars and always gaining new one and always full of bruises. All courtesy of his cousin and uncle’s beatings. Even after the war ended, he still need to come here. There’s no more dark lord, so why is he still here, why does he still end up here of all places?</p><p>‘Oh yeah, there’s nobody to take me in. Nobody wants a freak like me. Everyone I considered as a friend dies. Dumbledore died, the Grangers , The Weasleys , The Lupins, The Malfoys , The Blacks, everyone. They died all because of me.’</p><p> </p><p>In the last battle with Voldemort, Harry’s wand and the elder wand that was being used by Voldermort, exploded and everyone except Harry, died. The new ministry took over and he has to stay here with his muggle family for his own protection even though Voldemort is dead. They say there’s a lot of death eaters still trying to come and kill him but he doesn’t believe that at all. All of the crazy and loyal ones are dead and the rest are all more eager to just finally be free from the madman but nobody listens to him. Sigh.</p><p> </p><p>I guess it is expected seeing how their ‘Savior’ end up killing almost all of the population of the wizarding world , many heir of multiple houses died in that day. Hence ending a lot of family names. Only those who were not involved in the last battle at Hogwarts survive. It’s unfortunate really , how all that innocent people both adult and children died from that explosion. Ending up with the famous Boy-Who-Lived being the <em><em>only</em></em> person to live through that war again. The future of the wizarding community is not really bright anymore. No wonder the new ministry hates him.‘Soon…soon I’ll go somewhere far away from here.’</p><p> </p><p>He looked over to his clock and its almost midnight. Harry ducked under his bed and pull out an old teddy bear.</p><p>“Guess happy 10 years anniversary huh teddy?” and the clock strikes midnight.</p><p>Harry smiled and sang himself a soft happy birthday and he started to sweat.</p><p>‘is it me or its getting hot in here?’. He put his teddy on the table and sat on his bed, he swipe the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve and took off his glasses and put it on the table also. Then the heat increases, and it starts to get uncomfortable, his magic level starts to get out of control, fluctuating and dropping rapidly repeatedly.</p><p> </p><p>‘what’s happening to me?’. Then, the heat turns into pain and he doubled over, falling down to the floor. Gasping, trying to control his breathing. ‘Am I going to die?’</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>The pain was excruciating. He tried to stand up but the pain was just too much and he end up falling to the floor. ‘why am I in this much pain?!’</p><p>The worse of the pain is from his stomach and it feels like his intestine is on fire and felt like its being ripped out. Another wave of pain comes and he screamed. This time it feels like all of his body is on fire and he swear his bones are breaking and regrowing. Harry’s body arched from the floor and he screamed again. More like screeching and sounds very inhuman.</p><p> </p><p>His vision white out and the pain traveled to his back and it intensifies and all Harry can do is scream. He can see Hedwig by the table hooting and flapping her wings crazily and he can’t do anything else other then just suffer from this pain.</p><p> </p><p>Aunt Petunia banged on the door. “Boy! Shut up! Stop screaming bloody murder! You are disturbing the neighbors!”. she waited for a few seconds and the screaming didn’t stop, so she opened up the door and gasped, seeing Harry writhing on the floor looking like his bones were all jumbled up and distorted. Worried that she will get hurt from the freak, she ran to her room to wake up Vernon and Dudley, urging them to get out of this house. They immediately pack up what they can and drove away. Leaving Harry all alone to suffer.</p><p> </p><p>Harry tried to call for help but he can’t stop screaming. And after much suffering, he finally blacked out into the darkness. No longer care about the world or the pain. Drifting off into the peaceful night.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>In a room lit up by the fire in the fireplace , a man sat on an armchair near the fireplace looked up when he heard the Cri of an awakened mate. He hastily put down the book and quickly stood up. He was 6ft6 and has light skin with dark brown hair cut short, his body is well muscled but not overly so. His stance breathe out confidence and power. He pulled out all his creature attribute and foreshadow himself to the human realm, set on searching for his awakened mate.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Harry slowly started to wake up. The first thing he noticed was the massive headache pounding on his skull.</p><p>“ Urgh, my head hurts..what time is it?”</p><p>He blearily sat up from lying on the floor and immediately regretted it when a wave of nausea came and he huddled back down and vomited on the floor. After much of dry heaving , Harry lay back down on the floor, careful not to lay down on his own sick.</p><p> </p><p>Something white and feathery flew by his face and a hooted is heard. Harry opens his eyes to see a very worried looking Hedwig, well as worried looking as an owl can.</p><p>“Hey Hedwig…you’re not hurt are you?”</p><p>Hedwig hooted again, presumably to say no.</p><p>“I’m sorry for the ruckus last night. Forgive me.” Harry reached out and petted Hedwig on her breastbone.</p><p>Hedwig climbed up and nestled herself on Harry’s head, preening his hair.</p><p> </p><p>Harry blinked up the ceiling and ‘ I can…see? Without my glasses? Am I dead? No, dead people don’t have headaches and they sure don’t vomit out their stomach content all over the floor. But why is my eyesight fixed? I can see the dust particle floating around, I can see the light spectrum, I can see the texture of the walls…what’s wrong with me? Or what’s right with me? ’</p><p> </p><p>Harry tried to sit up again -Hedwig hooted for being disturbed but flew back to her perch to take a nap, she was up all night looking after Harry so she’s dead tired- this time slowly because there’s this uncomfortable pressure on his back and its starting to get painful. Harry cautiously sit up and happily noted that the remnants of his stomach will stay where it is without any warning of getting out again. Not that there’s much in it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Harry twist his body to face the door when something caught on his table and the clock fell down, its 8.30 in the morning, ‘ the Dursley won’t be up till later after 9 so I’m safe for now ’.</p><p>But wait, Harry turned his head around and a little screamed came out because ‘ There is something leathery and big behind me! is that wings I’m seeing?! what the heck happened to me?! ’</p><p> </p><p>Without Harry realizing, he let out a distress call instead of a normal scream. The man from earlier heard the call and quickly entered the house and followed the scent of his mate.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked up towards the door when someone opened it. There, stood a man, a very gorgeous man , not that he’s into men mind you, and without any reason that Harry knows, he let out a chirped , Harry gasped and covered his mouth with his hand. ‘what the heck is that sound?!’</p><p> </p><p>The man entered the small room and crouched down , seemingly not to startle Harry, he rumbled back to harry, trying to say that everything is okay and I meant no harm and I offer help. Harry quickly settled down and relaxed. ‘ This is weird. My life is weird. Everything is weird right now! ’</p><p> </p><p>The man, seeing the panicked in Harry’s face stretched out his hand.</p><p>“Hello there , my name is Arian Hynson. What’s your name little one?”</p><p>“...Harry…” he said cautiously.</p><p>“Harry..?”</p><p>“Just Harry”</p><p>“Okay Harry , I heard your call and I came here to help you, would you let me help you Harry?” Arian said with his sexy,husky voice.</p><p> </p><p>Harry tilted his head to the side and studied the man in front of him. ‘well, he seems nice and he doesn’t look like he means any harm’. Harry chirped again and there is this weird instinct saying that he can trust this man and that he <em><em>should </em></em>trust him, and that his instinct is screaming MATE.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had long learn to trust his instinct. It’s just better to trust a feeling that comes from your gut rather than your brain, it tends to be easily influenced and altered.</p><p> </p><p>Again Arian answered with a deep rumble and Harry carefully put his hand inside Arian’s still outstretched hand. Arian smiled and picked Harry up and put him on the bed. Harry blushed, embarrassed seeing how Arian just casually vanished his puke and picked him up like he weighs nothing to the bed.</p><p>‘Merlin this is so embarrassing!’</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, do you know what you are?”</p><p>Harry shook his head no.</p><p>“Would you like me to explain it to you?”</p><p>After thinking about it for a while , Hary nodded yes, because why not?</p><p>Arian conjured a cushion on the floor and sat on it, he feels like sitting here facing face to face with Harry is a good choice rather than sitting beside him. Harry looked into Arian eyes, his eyes is the brightest blue he has ever seen, looks like all the colour of the ocean and the sky mixed up together and decided to reside in his eyes. So mesmerizing. Without Harry’s awareness, he was openly staring Arian right into his eyes, transfixed.</p><p> </p><p>Arian smiled up to Harry and cleared his throat. Harry startled and blushed, ‘good moves there Harry, staring people straight in the eyes geez!’.</p><p>“Urm, sorry about that.” Harry mumbled and looked down to his hands.</p><p>“Its okay little one. Can I just…remove you shirt? I meant no ill intention, I just…I want to have a better look at your attributes”</p><p> </p><p>Harry was wary at first but seeing nothing but sincerity in Arians blue blue eyes, he eventually agreed and Arian smiled while taking his shirt off. Harry looked down and gasped, seeing how there’s a mass of scales and white tattoos swirling around his torso.</p><p> </p><p>Arian’s eyes also widen, now seeing all of his attributes, he knows that this little submissive is one of the rare type of species in the realm. He suspected it, but didn’t have the confirmation seeing how there’s only one of them every 100 years. Not wanting to scare the submissive , he started to explain.</p><p>“From what I can see, you are a Niluveras. Niluveras has leathery wings like you have there on your back , and you have beautiful wings by the way Harry”. Harry blushed at his comment. “ and you have a tail like a demon but without the pointed end like the human always describe demons as, more like a cat’s tail , but without the fur, like a sphynx,, your ears are a bit pointed but not as much as a dominant like mine here” he showed Harry his pointy ears. Then he softly lift harry’s lips to see his teeth “…and you have fangs, not as sharp or as long but it can still be painful if you meant it to be” Arian smiled. “ and by the curves of your body and the colour of your tattoos, also the ears and the fangs, you are a submissive.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s eyes widened. “what do you mean by submissive!?” he yelled. ‘ Submissive as in the girl role?! but I don’t even like men! Well maybe a bit but this is ridiculous! ’</p><p> </p><p>Arian seeing the conflict in Harry’s eyes quickly assured him , “Its not a bad thing Harry, you may be a submissive but that doesn’t mean that you always have to obey your alpha/dominant. You still have a say in your mateship, but really, the submissive holds the power actually, but us dominants doesn’t want to admit it,” Arian grinned , “you rule the household and everything comes back to you, if you say no, then if your dominant decided to go on with it. Then he/she will have a very angry submissive in their hands and that is not a good situation to have in hand.”</p><p> </p><p>Grumbling to himself, Harry finally took a look around his room. Why is the house so quiet?</p><p>“How did you come in Arian?”</p><p>“I foreshadow in front of your house, and got in through the front door. Why?”</p><p>“you came in through the front door?! did my aunt and uncle saw you?” Harry asked, troubled.</p><p>“There’s nobody except you in this house Harry, there’s not even a car and the front door wasn’t even lock”</p><p>“They’re not..here?” Harry mumbled to nobody. ‘Did they left last night? Am I free?’</p><p>“Do you want to come back with me Harry? To my home in the Autre Realm?”</p><p>“Autre realm? Where is that?”</p><p>Arian chuckled. “ Its the creature realm, there’s where all the creature comes from. And I want to be your Alpha, and I want you as my submissive. Will you let me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait , what? My alpha? Your submissive?”</p><p>Seeing how the submissive was getting confused and on his way to a full blown panic he quickly intervened, “Say what, you come with me to the realm and I’ll explain it all to you there. Or do you prefer to stay here in this house living in this tiny room and looking from the cat flap there and all the locks and your clothing, it doesn’t seem like you are happy here.”</p><p> </p><p>‘its not like I have anything to lose, literally nothing. His scent is mesmerizing and he is gorgeous and I can’t sense any malice from him.’ A whisper of ‘mate’ came to mind and that seal the deal. Harry nodded in agreement.</p>
