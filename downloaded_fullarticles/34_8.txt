    <p>It only takes two weeks of Harry enduring what is quite possible the worst and most miserable summer ever before he is saved. Those two weeks truly are the epitome of despair, though. He doesn’t receive any letters from his friends; Uncle Vernon won’t let him let Hedwig out to stretch her wings which makes her hoot loudly and annoyedly throughout the day and night, angering Uncle Vernon even further; and he just really misses life at Hogwarts.</p><p>Help comes in the form of Harry’s best friend, Draco Malfoy, and his mother, Narcissa Malfoy, when they appear with a loud <em>crack</em> in the Dursleys’ living room in the middle of breakfast one Saturday morning.</p><p>“Excuse me, but who are you?!” Uncle Vernon shouts at them. “You are breaking and entering, and I’ve had enough of <em>your kind</em> doing that on my property to la at me a lifetime already, thank you very much!”</p><p>Narcissa doesn’t even blink at him, only smiling at Harry and dropping her son’s arm to walk over to Harry standing by the stovetop cooking bacon and check him over for any injuries.</p><p>“Harry, dear, are you well? Draco told me he hasn’t received any letters from you and we’ve been worried,” she says, although her cool and collected tone and appearance contradict the last part of her statement.</p><p>“I’m alright,” Harry says, stopping in his cooking to smile at her and return her hug, which initially surprises him. “I just haven’t been able to let Hedwig out to send anything.”</p><p>“That’s good,” Narcissa says, pulling away and letting Draco take over the hug. “Do you have anything packed?” she asks, and Harry shakes his head. “How about you and Draco go and pack them, then. I want to have a little chat with your aunt and uncle, and then we can head back to the manor.”</p><p>“Manor?” Uncle Vernon asks, seemingly much more interested in the conversation at this single word. “I didn’t think your kind could live in manors.”</p><p>“Oh, yes,” Narcissa says, suddenly haughty and regal. “<em>Our kind</em> can be extremely wealthy, in fact, most wizarding families <em>are</em>. I believe the only Muggles wealthier than my family are the royals, but we might even have <em>them</em> beat. Lots of land both here and in France, you know, and we like to keep high positions within the Wizarding World. Only the best for the Malfoys, as my husband always says, and with me growing up a Black it was much the same.”</p><p>Harry smirks at Uncle Vernon’s purpling face as he takes in this information in a way that he definitely learned how to do from Draco, before Draco drags him out of the kitchen to start packing.</p><p>“Where are your things?” Draco asks.</p><p>“Um… my school stuff is in the cupboard under the stairs, but all of my clothes and Hedwig are upstairs in my room. The cupboard’s locked, though, we can’t get in,” Harry replies.</p><p>Draco grins wickedly. “You’re a wizard, Harry. You can get in anywhere.”</p><p>“We’re not allowed to do magic outside of school, though,” Harry says.</p><p>“Oh, fine,” Draco says, rolling his eyes. “Be that way. Dobby!”</p><p>A second later there is another <em>crack</em> and this time, the Malfoys’ house-elf, Dobby, appears.</p><p>“What is it you is needing Dobby to do, Young Master Draco, sir?” Dobby asks before he notices Harry standing next to Draco. “Harry Potter, sir! Dobby is happy to be seeing you, sir! Is Harry Potter needing help from Dobby, too?”</p><p>“Um, yes,” Harry says, realizing what it is that Draco called Dobby for. “We both need the same thing actually. Can you unlock that cupboard for us so we can get my school things out?”</p><p>“Of course, Harry Potter, sir!” Dobby squeaks, and then he snaps his fingers and the cupboard door swings open to reveal Harry’s trunk with his Hogwarts robes and his school books and his cauldron, all tucked away inside. “Is that all, sirs?”</p><p>“Yes, Dobby, that’s all for now. We’ll be see you back at the manor later today,” Draco says, and Dobby disapparates with another <em>crack</em>. “Okay, so that’s all of that stuff. Now we just need to pack the rest of your things and then we tell Mum we’re ready to go.”</p><p>Harry’s bedroom was originally Dudley’s second bedroom, and the evidence of it is still there. Broken toys and entertainment sets fill most of the room, as Harry has yet to find someplace else to put them.</p><p>“What is all this rubbish?” Draco asks, looking around the room with a grimace.</p><p>“Not mine,” Harry says instead of answering. He doubts Draco actually knows what any of it is, it’s all too Muggle, and he doesn’t really feel like taking the time to explain it all. “Come on, help me pack.”</p><p>Harry wads up his clothes that make him look the least like a mouse trying on an elephant’s skin and stuffs them inside his trunk wherever they’ll fit; he knows he has wizard’s robes in his closet at Malfoy Manor, and he doesn’t really see a point in dressing Muggle. He then puts the book Hagrid had given him as a gift at the end of his first year gently inside his trunk in a place where it can’t get ruined by anything around it. Lastly, he closes the trunk and lets Hedwig out of her cage, telling her to fly ahead to Malfoy Manor.</p><p>“Ready then?” Draco asks, and Harry nods.</p><p>They carry Harry’s things back down to the living room where Narcissa seems to be wrapping up her conversation with the Dursleys, a soft yet malicious smile graces Narcissa’s face as she looks at Uncle Vernon’s angry purple face and Aunt Petunia’s guarded expression.</p><p>“Ah, you’re all packed and ready to go, I take it?” Narcissa asks Harry, standing up rather elegantly. Harry decides both she and Draco look severely out of place in the Dursleys’ home, not just because they are so obviously magical in a Muggle setting, but because the house just seems too simple for them. These are the people who own albino peacocks that just wander the grounds of their manor, after all.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m ready,” Harry says with a smile, thankful to be able to escape from this place to somewhere he is actually welcome.</p><p>“Good,” Narcissa replies, before turning to the Dursleys again. “He’ll spend the rest of the summer with us. I do understand that Dumbledore wishes him to spend at least some time here every year, however, so he will, unfortunately, have to come back here next summer. We will be taking him back if we have any reason to We will be taking him back if we have any reason to believe he is not being treated properly, and then Dumbledore will be hearing from me about changing this little <em>arrangement</em> he has with you.”</p><p>“We understand,” Aunt Petunia says. Harry is surprised to hear the tone she uses when she’s gossiping and pretending to be better than everyone else, although he is surprised to here a note of sincerity in her voice. Maybe he’s imagining things.</p><p>“Come, Harry, Draco,” Narcissa says, beckoning the boys closer to her and pulling out her wand, waving it at Harry’s luggage to shrink it so Harry can put it in his pocket.</p><p>Harry and Draco each grab one of Narcissa’s arms and then he feels the strange sensation the goes along with apparating: the feeling of being stretched like taffy and forced through a small tube before they finally land in front of the elaborate and magical front gate of Malfoy Manor.</p><p>“Welcome home,” Draco says happily as they walk through the iron bars together, and Harry smiles.</p><p>He wouldn’t mind this being home, he had enjoyed himself immensely when he came here last Christmas, once he had gotten used to the place. Draco had even suggested the idea of Harry moving in then, and Harry was all for it. He already has his own room and after a week or so he and Draco had traveled the manor and its grounds enough that he knew his way around. Apparently, the only thing stopping him from living here is Dumbledore. Harry wonders why that is exactly, but can’t come up with any explanations.</p><p>The grounds of Malfoy Manor are a different kind of fascinating in the summer than they are in the winter. Where the grounds were once covered in delicate, glimmering, pristine white snow, brilliantly green grass sparkles in its place, not a weed in sight. Occasionally, Harry spots a cobblestone path twisting across the grounds, leading to a garden, the stables, the expansive forest with the secret cabin Draco’s grandfather lives in, a large pond, and other things that Harry has yet to discover.</p><p>One of the many albino peacocks that roams the grounds steps up to them and starts following them as they walk up the front steps then stares at them as the doors magically open themselves and they head inside the manor. The inside hasn’t changed as much as the outside has, in fact, it’s exactly the way Harry remembers it from Christmas.</p><p>“Race you to your room!” Draco says suddenly and then they both take off running, Narcissa not even bothering to call after them as she knows it will do no good.</p><p>Harry’s room in the manor is exactly how he left it, albeit cleaner. The bed sheets are now stretched tight across the bed instead of rumpled from his sleeping in them, the curtains are pulled back to reveal a view of the front garden, and his belongings have not yet been strewn across the floor.</p><p>Harry and Draco make quick work of unpacking, hanging the few cloths Harry brought up in the closet for Dobby to iron later, setting the photo book from Hagrid on the bedside table, putting his school stuff and Hedwig’s cage on the desk in the corner of the room, and then stuffing his trunk underneath his bed.</p><p>This room looks more like his room than his room at the Dursleys’ ever did and the only truly personal thing he has here is that single photo book.</p><p>“Do you think your parents would mind if I decorated?” Harry asks, deciding that even though he is already starting to feel at home he wants to make it even more so.</p><p>Draco shrugs. “Everyone else has and they didn’t care, so I don’t see why not. Maybe you, me, Mum, and Dobby could go to Diagon Alley tomorrow to look for stuff!”</p><p>“Brilliant!” Harry replies, smiling around at <em>his</em> room.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Dinner is nowhere near as torturous an affair as it had been at the Dursleys’ or here back at Christmas. Harry quickly picked up on the proper etiquette of dining with the Malfoys back then, and as long as he avoids talking to Mr. Malfoy, he has nothing to worry about. It all works out, too, as Mr. Malfoy seems to be resolutely ignoring Harry as well in preference of eating in silence as Narcissa, Draco, and Harry chatter away around him.</p><p>That is, until dessert.</p><p>“So, Potter, I understand you will be staying here for the rest of the summer, and possibly next summer as well,” Mr. Malfoy says.</p><p>Harry’s eyes widen and he looks between Draco and Narcissa for a second before answering Mr. Malfoy. “Uh, yes, sir. I hope that’s not an issue?” he can’t help that a slight amount of sarcasm enters his voice as he replies, causing Mr. Malfoy to raise an eyebrow, but the man makes no comment on it.</p><p>“It’s no issue at all,” he says. “I was just thinking that since you <em>are</em> going to be here for a while, maybe it would be… most prudent… that you learn a few things about this family and the way things are done here.”</p><p>“Um… okay… sir,” Harry replies, not quite sure how else to respond.</p><p>“Excellent,” Mr. Malfoy says, and that’s the end of all conversation at the table for the rest of the evening.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>The next morning, Harry slips on some of the lighter and more summery looking wizard’s robes before stepping out into the hall where he meets Draco and they head down to breakfast together, during which Narcissa informs them that all four of them will be taking a walk around the grounds together after breakfast. She winks at Harry and he thinks maybe he’s supposed to know something significant about this walk, but he can’t think of anything.</p><p>As it turns out, he <em>does</em> know something. Shortly after starting their walk, they turn down a path heading to the forest on the grounds, and Harry realizes exactly what is going on. His ideas are only proven when they finally step into a clearing in the forest that reveals a cabin, Draco’s grandfather Abraxas sitting on a wooden chair on the front porch, sipping on what looks like pumpkin juice.</p><p>“Ah, you must be Harry!” Abraxas says jovially, shaking Harry’s hand as they all walk up the stairs and onto the wraparound porch.</p><p>“Yes! And, you are…?” Harry says, playing along as if he’s never met this man before.</p><p>“Abraxas Malfoy. Draco’s grandfather,” Abraxas replies, his smile mischievous. “Oh, come in, come in! We can chat outside later. Now, I believe we have some family history to discuss?”</p><p>And just like that, Harry is re-experiencing the second day he spent at the manor when he stayed for Christmas, only this time in the presence of Narcissa and Mr. Malfoy. The first time, Narcissa had only known that Harry would be learning of the Malfoys’ dealings with less sinister dealings with Muggles, but it seems this time they would be letting Mr. Malfoy in on the secret.</p><p>“Are you following, dear boy?” Abraxas asks Harry when he is finished with his detailed explanation of the Malfoy family history.</p><p>“I think so,” Harry replies, trying to act like he is still processing this information that he had already accepted about six months ago. “It’s a lot to take in.”</p><p>“No doubt it is, no doubt,” Abraxas says. “How about you and Draco come downstairs with me? You can see all of our prizes for yourself. Lucius, Narcissa, help yourselves to anything in the kitchen.”</p><p>Harry walks down the creaky wooden stairs just behind Draco and Abraxas, and they all start laughing when they make it to the bottom.</p><p>“We’re letting Mr. Malfoy in on the secret in the least controversial way possible, I take it?” Harry says once they have calmed down.</p><p>Abraxas nods. “Narcissa told me you’d be staying here and I wanted you boys to be able to visit, so she and I talked Lucius into allowing you to know everything.”</p><p>“Well, I’m glad you did,” Harry says, smiling. “I rather enjoy it here and I didn’t want to have to try and keep that secret forever. Don’t worry, though, <em>this</em> secret is perfectly safe with me,” Harry says, motioning around at all of the Muggle artwork and artifacts around the basement.</p><p>“I never had any doubts, my dear boy,” Abraxas says.</p><p>They go back upstairs to find Narcissa sipping on a glass of lemonade while Mr. Malfoy remains expressionless, seared at the little island in the kitchen.</p><p>“What do you say we all head outside to talk on the porch? It’s a beautiful day out. Maybe we can have Dobby bring us some snacks for lunch?” Abraxas asks.</p><p>“I think that sounds lovely,” Narcissa says, and they all head outside.</p>
