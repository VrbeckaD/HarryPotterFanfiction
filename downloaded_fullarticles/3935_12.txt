    <p>Harry Potter was a curious kid by nature, so he liked watching people. He could see things about how they walked dressed, and talked. His Aunt Petunia for example, her pristine clothes were always prim and proper, always wearing a perfume that smelled like the lavender he took care of in the garden. He knew that she was trying to imitate something higher than the middle class suburban neighborhood they were part of. A cheap version of what the wife of Vernon’s boss wore. The clothes that held onto her thin form were pricy but made her feel better about the whale of a husband she married. Vernon on the other hand wasn't that particular about the clothes he wore. Since if one looked closely the belt he wore had two handmade holes that tried to imitate their counterparts. But it was evidence that the man was cheap unless it came to his wife who liked to wear new and high quality clothes; ‘Happy wife, happy life’ after all. Dudley was spoiled and Harry didn't like looking at the bulbous cousin, but there were actions his cousin made. The way he liked to be a little too touchy with his friend Piers, or let his eyes linger too long on his friend. Harry was sure that Dudley was gay or bisexual, which made him want to laugh since Petunia would be horrified if Dudley wasn't anything but her view of normal. Harry himself didn't care much for gender but he wasn't about to admit that to any of his horrible family members, if one could consider them that.</p><p>Harry Potter was very good at reading people and living with the Dursleys allowed him to know how far he could push somebody and blend into the background. Harry became a natural at directing attention away from himself and surviving tense social situations. So when he was outside working on the garden which had a variety of flowers that would not be found in any other garden; because he had a talent in making things grow, was surprised to see an owl. “Hello there what are you doing flying out during the day?” He felt slightly foolish because he was talking to an owl.</p><p>“Is this for me?”</p><p>The bird hooted and dropped the letter and left shortly after. “Gringotts Bank to Harry James Potter.”</p><p>Harry finished tending to the gardened and managed to sneak it to his cupboard so he could read it later. He wondered if this had anything to do why Petunia was edgy around his 11th birthday and then started to treat him better once the school year started up again.</p><p>
  <em> Dear Harry James Potter, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> It has come to our attention at Gringotts Wizarding Bank that you have come at the age to access your trust fund. Gringotts Wizarding Bank has made an appointment for Thursday at 4pm. Knowing that you have no prior exposure to the Wizarding world, we have provided you a portkey to arrive at Gringotts Wizarding Bank 20 minutes early. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Sincerely, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Narnok, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Head of Gringotts Wizarding Bank </em>
</p><p>Harry Potter asked Petunia on Thursday if he could go to the park, thankfully Dudley had gone to a friend's house that afternoon. At 3:40pm Harry disappeared from the park and appeared on the marbled floor of Gringotts bank. Harry watched for a minute on how the Goblins treated the wizards and vice versa. He saw that the Goblins hated being treated like they were dirt beneath someone's feet. Then a man who seemed tattered and grim entered the bank. He wasn't like the rest Harry could tell, something about him felt different. An old instinct that was long forgotten that told Harry that this man was much more dangerous than he appeared. While the Goblins and the man treated each other with contempt, there was still a respect they gave each other. A respect two predators would give each other, the man was probably a creature Harry thought.</p><p>He went up to a Goblin and once they payed attention, “may your gold flow freely and gain much profit. I have a meeting at four concerning a trust fund I have acquired.” The goblin he greeted seemed surprised on how he greeted him, but Harry new that he just earned some points for treating them with decency. The goblin nodded, “follow me, this meeting will be behind doors.” Harry followed the goblin and was led to a room where he was told to sit down and wait. Little did he know that the goblin had told the manager of Potter assets about this young wizard’s greeting.</p><p>“Hello Harry Potter, I am the manager of the Potter's family assets.” The goblin saw as the young wizard nodded his head, “It's a pleasure to meet you, may I know your name?”</p><p>This was something that Harry did not know helped the goblin decide he would help the Half-blood wizard. “My name is Griphook. We are here to speak about your trust fund and future inheritance.”</p><p>“Mr. Potter there is a trust fund where you get money monthly in for your expenses for when attending Hogwarts.” He saw the confusion on the boy's face but was pleased that the boy didn't interrupt. “You will still receive it even if you do not attend Hogwarts due to changes in the Ministry. Once you reach the age of 17 you will be able to access the family vaults and have a key. Do you have any questions?”</p><p>“Yes Mister Griphook. Is there anyone who has access to the family vault? Is there a currency exchange between Wizarding money and non-wizarding money?”</p><p>“Other than you Mr. Potter no. I believe all other persons that would have had access are dead. Yes one can convert Galleons to muggle money.”</p><p>Harry had converted his allowance to muggle money and was hoping to pay for his schooling. He had put in order his assets with the help of Gringotts, he was about to leave when Gringotts stopped him. “Mister Potter you must know that the minister is a man going by the name of Tom Marvolo Slytherin. He has changed the Wizarding law to highly favor Purebloods. While he is not as harsh on half-bloods as he is on muggleborns, it would still be hard for you to thrive in the Britain Wizarding world. There is a time limit where a half-blood can request to enter Hogwarts but it carries a hefty price and many restrictions on what the student is allowed to do. It would be in your best interest to not enter the Britain Wizarding Community until you are older and have gotten your magical education elsewhere. I would heavily recommend France by the means of hiring tutors, because for the school in France all subjects are taught in French and required to know French. Or perhaps think about going to America. You have made a good impression on us, and while we care little for wizard affairs it would be a shame for someone that isn't impaired by prejudice to be stunted in growth by the Britain Wizarding Ministry. May your gold flow freely and gain much profit.”</p><p>Harry thought long and hard about the advice given to him by Griphook, he was also given pamphlets on what Half-bloods could and could not do. He decided that he would not join the Wizarding world but still get an education.</p><p>Petunia was delighted to see the little nuisance finally leave her home but couldn't help but be bitter. The Freak had gotten a scholarship at some American university, her Dudley had to go to the local community college. The boy was described as a prodigy and a genius, those words described Dudley not that good for nothing twit. If she didn't hear from him again in her life she would be happy.</p><p>Harry Potter was excellent in the field of Botany; he had gotten his degree at a well-known University and gotten it fully paid by the college itself. He had also hired tutors in every subject needed for O.W.L.S and N.E.W.T.S in Britain he was well-rounded and knowledgeable. He definitely liked Herbology. He was 24 and was working out in the field, he thought nothing odd about the tickling sensation in his chest.</p><p>He wrote it off as allergies.</p><p>It came and went but after a month he went to see a doctor to be informed that he had a respiratory disease that they hadn't seen before. Slowly his lungs were degrading and in a year or two he would be dead. The American Wizarding world had no cure and to hire a potions master to try to find a cure one had to be a citizen. Harry had cried, cursed, and yelled. But it hurt his lungs to do any of those. He was weary and he decided he wanted to die in Britain. He would enter the Wizarding world and maybe open a shop, he would help a few people get to their feet and die quietly. How much trouble could he get into in one or two years.</p><p>Britain was similar as it had been since he left, going to Diagon alley as he remembered from when he first entered the Wizarding World. “May your gold flow freely and gain much profit. I am Lord Potter, and would like to talk with Griphook.”</p><p>“It is a pleasure to meet you again Mister Potter.”</p><p>Harry smiled at the Goblin, “Yes it is Griphook. I want to make a business proposition on opening a store in Diagon Alley, as well as a draft for a will.”</p><p>He saw as the Goblin sitting before his raised his eyebrows. “You will have to fill out paperwork for the business and of course we will withdraw the money for the shop of your choosing. You will also need to file papers at the Ministry once you have finalized everything here. A will Lord Potter?”</p><p>Harry sighed, “Yes. Sadly, it seems that I will only have 1 to 2 years left to live. And I will be cut short on your wonderful company.” The goblin laughed at the wizard’s humor, “you have my sympathy Lord Potter. Let's get everything in order.”</p><p>By the end he had found out her had three more Lordships; Sirius Black had made him his heir and he was heir to Gryffindor and the Peverell line. He had bought a three story building in Diagon Alley that would be his flower shop. The bottom floor would be the storefront, the middle floor would be enchanted so he could grow a variety of plants, and top floor would be where he would be living.  He paid the Goblins to hire maintenance workers and a designer. Thankfully since he had bought the building from Gringotts it already had warding. He bought a whole new wardrobe before he went to go file with the Ministry. It went easier than expected, since the woman at the desk didn't know whether to sneer or ogle him. His shop soon opened with a variety of plants and was scouted by many Purebloods. His shop managed to be grudgingly accepted by them because his plants were superior and it did hurt that he knew how to genetically alter his plants. Two weeks into his business he stumbled onto a young witch who was obviously struggling to live.</p><p>“Do you need a job? I happen to be hiring.” The woman wondered if this person was an angel and why he was so kind to her. “I'm Harry Potter a half-blood if you're wondering. What's your name?”</p><p>“Mandy Brocklehurst.”</p><p>Harry got his first employee that day.</p><p>Lord Slytherin was the epitome of what Purebloods stove for. He was handsome, wealthy, and magically powerful. He had beaten the Order of Phoenix members; he was still hunting for the head of it. Yet that would come in due time. The Wizarding world changed tremendously but there were still some things left to be desired. Muggleborns were not admitted to Hogwarts but some Half-bloods were; now the Purebloods were unhappy that their magic that was stolen by mudbloods was now being stolen by half-bloods. They had demanded him to do something and he had showed them that their place was beneath his feet. He was distracted by the opening of his office door, in walked Daphne Greengrass. The fiance to the Malfoy scion, but she often batted her eyelashes at him hoping he would take a physical interest in her. In she came with new flowers to decorate his office with.</p><p>“I don’t remember Noltie's Botanical Novelties caring that strand of roses.”</p><p>Daphne smiled as she put the flowers in a vase, “They don't. It's a new store called ‘Spelled Flowers’. It's has high quality flowers even though it's owned by a <em> half-blood. </em>”</p><p>He remembered Gringotts selling property to a wizard but hardly cared what the Goblins did with the property they owned. He was bored and had very little to do today so he decided that he would go see this new shop and its owner.</p><p>He walked into the store to be greeted by a man who was slightly smaller than the average height but fit. What stuck out most to the Slytherin Lord were his Avada Kedavra green eyes. “Hello how can I help you?”</p><p>Tom’s eyes narrowed at this, “<em> half-blood... </em>you are to address me by my title.”</p><p>The boy gave him an impish smile, “Minister, may I help you?</p><p>Tom hissed at this, “I should kill you for your disrespect.”</p><p>Tom expected the man to cower or beg for his life, he was not expecting the man to laugh. He did not know that Harry did not fear death but would welcome it. He had finally come to terms that he was going to die.</p><p>Tom left as he promised to ruin the man and take the store that he had recently bought. Yet to his surprise the Goblins were uncooperative and he grudgingly could not ruin the man. He knew that many went there and we're not only captivated by the flowers but by the man himself. He knew why, the man not only carried the Potter lordship but the Black as well. Even if he was half-blood he had two old family lines, some of the Blacks had supported his cause. Perhaps the man could provide him some entertainment.</p><p>“You're back.” Tom gritted his teeth at the lack of properly addressing him.</p><p>“I must ask Lord Potter-Black how is it that you grew up without being kept track of.”  </p><p>The man looked up from the flowers he was spraying with water, “O... the whole invasion of privacy for half-bloods and muggleborns. I was raised by muggles before that fully finalized and went for my muggle education first and then my Wizarding education in America.”</p><p>The Lord across from him looked pissed at Harry's insult, but Harry could care less. Harry still hated this bastard for not allowing one to hire a potions master unless one was a Pureblood. So might as well insult the idiot here and there very subtly.</p><p>“Is there anything I can get for the esteemed Minister of Magic?” He smiled as the man before him scowled, Harry thought it was such a shame the handsome man didn't smile.</p><p>“You have guts. Many wouldn't dare to antagonize me so openly.”</p><p>He saw as the young man went back to his flowers, “Ah you must live a tragic life then. Not having anyone to argue with, no playful banter. How have you managed this long is truly a wonder.” The Slytherin Lord scoffed he didn't need to argue with someone, but a voice in his mind whispered that he was tired that everyone around him submitted so easily. They took his word as gospel, as law, and they should but he would not let this man know he was close to the truth.</p><p>“Well Miss Greengrass took Coretta Scott King Roses to your office this morning. I do like roses but you strike me more as a Foxglove type. They were commonly known as dead man’s bells and witch's gloves, a beautiful but deadly flower.”</p><p>“Are you calling me beautiful, Lord Potter?”</p><p>He saw as the young man smirked, “I also said deadly. Please Lord Slytherin, I can't have you falling in love with me.” Tom was taken by surprise by the statement but then fury was all he could feel. “How dare you?! I would never fall in love with someone like you?!”</p><p>He was about to raise his wand to Crucio the brat when the man's gentle smile stopped him.</p><p>“I'm sorry I guess you really aren't used to playful banter. I did not mean to offend you, My Lord. Of course someone such as yourself, should never fall in love with someone like me.” Lord Slytherin didn't know how to respond but he didn't have to, the Potter brat bowed and left.</p><p>“Mandy it's lunch time would you like to join me?”</p><p>Tom hadn't noticed the girl there before; Harry Potter had taken all of his attention that he didn't pay attention to his surroundings. He saw her fearful face and the worry she showed for her boss. It agitated Tom that he was easily forgotten for that lowly trash. He saw as the man smiled kindly at the girl as she nodded and with that Tom left the store in a sour mood.</p><p>“Miss Greengrass, what can I get for you today?” He saw as the Pureblood scowled at him but pointed at the Saffron Crocus. “These will do Potter. My wedding will be this Friday so soon it'll be Ms. Malfoy to you. Although, you are a half-blood you have excellent quality, I will be ordering flowers Mr. Potter. I expect them to be your best.”</p><p>Harry politely nodded his head even when she practically said his name with distaste. “Nothing but the best for you Miss Greengrass, soon to be Ms. Malfoy.” He saw as Daphne preened at being called Ms.Malfoy, it made Harry want to vomit. “What do you have in mind for your wedding? I also have enchantments options for their behavior, if you want them to be an active decoration.”</p><p>This caught her attention and they discussed exactly what she needed and wanted for the wedding. Harry was glad that he would never get the chance to marry a woman, he was sure that Greengrass’ taste was going to bankrupt the Malfoys before they were even married. He met Lady Malfoy who was taking an interactive role in the construction of the ceremony. When she eyed him she didn't show her distaste but he was sure she was probably seething inside to have a half-blood in her <em> pure </em>presence. Or maybe because soon to be former Miss Greengrass had insisted on buying from ‘Spelled Flowers’ rather than getting flowers from the Malfoy greenhouses. It was probably the latter because when she saw the flowers he had brought her eyes showed defeat. Harry had once again made a Pureblood admit internally that his flowers were superior to whatever they could produce. He wondered how they even had greenhouses he felt like Lady Malfoy would be offended at the sight of dirt. He went to work with the flowers and his wand, casting one enchantment after another. Little did he know he was being watched by several eyes, as the flowers floated around him without the wand being pointed at them. They were surprised as the half-blood’s show of wandless magic, a certain lord was watching the young man with irritation.</p><p>Tom Marvolo Slytherin didn't know what to think of this half-blood Lord, not only was the man not scared of him but was showing wandless magic as if it were nothing. He saw as the boy enchanted the flowers to wrap around the decorations and seem as they were one with whatever they were attached to. He saw as the young Lord muttered under his breath soon he saw the results, the flowers had a small shimmer to them and their fragrance was more evident. Tom was amused as he saw Narcissa eye the boy with some sort of respect in his ability to integrate the flowers flawlessly, standing out but not disrupting the flow of the design she had worked hard on.</p><p>Many seemed taken by the young man's talent with plants and enchantments; he knew that there would be a boost in business for Lord Potter-Black.</p><p>Draco Malfoy didn't love Daphne Greengrass but he appreciated her heritage and taste. Especially her taste in beauty, the flowers she picked weren't atrocious. Yet he didn't care for the flowers, no, his interest was caught by the young man in charge of the flowers. Dressed in formal robes that brought out his emerald eyes and he thought that perhaps he should visit the flower shop with Daphne to see that fine specimen. Surely Daphne would not mind after all they were married for the sole reason of having a heir, and that they were promised to each other before they were born. His eyes would wander and he was sure that the half-blood would be honored to entertain him.</p><p>Harry smiled at his work and his payment was handed to him by a house elf, typical. He quickly left before anyone could ask or talk to him.</p><p>A month had passed and Harry was feeling his breathing slowly becoming more strained. It seemed that Lord Slytherin was becoming a frequent customer, or he would if the man ever bought something. “I made you sandwiches too, would you like some?” He saw as the minister's eyes widened and Harry wanted to laugh at him. The man looked hesitantly at the pile of sandwiches, “Come on I didn't poison them, at least not this batch. They are quite good if I do say so myself.” Harry smiled brightly as he saw Tom take one of them and glare at Harry while he took a bite. Harry chuckled as Tom reached for another one, “I'll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Harry looked up to the man, “because if they weren't good you wouldn't be reaching out for another one.”</p><p>“No, you imbecile. Why aren't you scared of me? While you do have great magical reserves you would surely lose in a fight. I could cast unforgivables on you and no one would protest and you would be helpless if I chose to end your life.” Harry's eyes seemed distant and hinted to being haunted by truths. “Well eventually one meets death. Death is a constant and inevitable. The only thing that varies is how someone meets it, whether it's by the killing curse or a shower accident. It happens, the thing people should fear is the pain one feels before they die. If you were to shoot a killing curse at me I would call you merciful. There are plenty worse ways to die.”</p><p>Tom couldn't help but feel that Harry was not all there, but the boy being insane would certainly explain a few things. He had come to realize he didn't mind their arguments or banter. Tom had realized that the boy was pleasant company, a breath of fresh air in the stagnate company of Purebloods. Harry was entertaining and he liked seeing the determination flare in the boy's eyes. He liked when Harry stopped what he was doing to greet him, or gave him a flower or plant before he left to go back to his office. He never cared much for the language of flowers but he noticed Harry's choice in flowers. A yellow tulip even though the Dark Lord knew he never smiled at Potter before. Sweet Gallant, a sunflower, a pink rose, lotus flower; the list was long. Positive messages but sometimes he was sure Harry was humoring him, and it aggravated him for some unknown reason. Throughout his time he saw as the Potter-Black Lord payed for Brocklehurst’s education and picked up another stray. It seemed the boy was too kind for his own good or so he thought.</p><p>Harry smiled as he went throughout the morning, the newly Miss Malfoy stopped by. When Harry had not been the one to greet her she had been upset to his surprise. “I'm your best customer Potter. I expect you to greet me every time I step in your shop.” Harry wanted to roll his eyes but nodded and let Mandy scurry away from Daphne’s rant. “Of course, my apologies Lady Malfoy.” He was sure that she now only visited to have him constantly say Lady Malfoy, “I must say that your work with the flowers was impressive and everyone was envious of my skills to see beyond the pathetic exterior of a half-blood.” Perhaps she was a Malfoy from what he had heard; the family failed to always give compliments or gratitude where it was deserved.</p><p>“Yes from what I saw your wedding was a truly remarkable sight. I heard some people say the best wedding they've seen in years.” Harry lied and snickered in his head as he saw Daphne Malfoy gleam with pleasure. She left with what would be the smallest smile in existence, because merlin forbid Purebloods show any emotion. He thought he was rid of the Malfoy when her husband came into view and Harry almost groaned out loud. “Hello Lord Malfoy. Congratulations on your wedding.” The man openly assessed Harry and was pleased with what he saw. “No need for formalities Harry, after all I wish to know you better.”</p><p>‘<em> O Merlin last thing I want to deal with is a horny Pureblood who probably won't take a no for an answer, </em>’ Harry thought. “Mister Malfoy I must admit that I am always professional. My business depends on me being respectful of all my customers.”</p><p>Harry was being purposely dense which he hoped would deter Malfoy from trying to get into his pants. “Yes. Perhaps we could meet outside of business hours.”</p><p>All Harry could think was, ‘<em> Shit. </em>’</p><p>“Lord Malfoy, you are married.” If the man tried to later turn on him of insinuating anything, Harry would just say he said a statement that was a fact. He would show them that not only Purebloods could play a game of wits and words. “Yes there is that. But Daphne has always been a bit blind to the obvious. My inclinations have always been to the same gender.”</p><p>Harry could only curse stupid Purebloods and keeping their stupid word of marrying off their stupid future offspring. There surely should be a male Pureblood that could hold Lord Malfoy's interest; he had after all seen plenty of same sex couples. Harry instantly wished there was a flower that meant ‘FUCK NO.’ “I'm not one care for gender but I am not looking for a partner or someone to take me to bed.”</p><p>“Who said it had to be a bed.” The man whispered, out of the corner of his eyes Harry saw his other employee walk in.</p><p>“Anthony! I see you are here, just on time. I need some help with a particular strain of Amaryllis.” He saw as Malfoy was agitated that they had been interrupted and soon bid farewell and left. “What was that about Harry?”</p><p>“You don't want to know Anthony. I might have to obliviate myself.” Harry wished that Purebloods were uptight about what went on in the bedroom as they were about blood status. But he figured with all their constrained mannerisms they probably released their stresses in bed; the thought sent a shiver of fear down his spine. He didn't have the lungs to play in their twisted fantasies.</p><p>Tom Marvolo Slytherin saw that today Harry was tensed and scowled randomly as he thought about something. He wondered what had made Potter so agitated, he felt cheated that he wasn't the cause of Harry's anguish. “You're crushing my flower, Potter.” He saw as the young Lord came out of his thoughts and realized that he was supposed to be handing Tom his daily flower. Then he noticed the flower in his hand, it was a yellow carnation and cursed. He turned around and picked a Gladiolus and quickly handed it to the amused Lord Slytherin. “I'm offended I'm not at the forefront of your mind.” Harry looked up in surprise; this was after all the first time that Tom was teasing him. “Apologies Lord Slytherin.” Too bad he wasn't feeling like playing with words anymore, last thing he needed was to have the cruciatus curse cast upon him for accidentally offending the man's delicate sensibilities. His chest was hurting he felt like he would probably be having a coughing fit soon. “I need to tend to some exotic flowers that just arrived, Good day.” Tom saw as Harry retreated deeper into his store and couldn't help but feel agitated at the young man's mind wandering elsewhere. He left with the meaning of the yellow carnation on his mind and the dark scowl on Harry's face. He wondered who had aggravated Lord Potter, but it seemed like the man could have bad days.</p><p>6 months had gone by and Harry cursed, all he could do is lessen the pain from his failing lungs. Coughing was now producing small flecks of blood. The pain caused Harry's eyes to water, and like when he was a child he cried silently but this time it was not to agitate his lungs more. He saw the worried looks Anthony and Mandy gave him but he didn't tell them he was dying, he didn't want their pity and worry. Then it would be constant contact with their concerned words and touches, and before he would know his customers would find out. Speaking of customers, the Malfoys were becoming the bane of his existence. Draco Malfoy could not take a hint, Daphne Malfoy was clueless as she was useless, and then Narcissa had started to become a customer too. He saw as Narcissa looked at his door like it personally offended her about her status or her clothes before she opened it. She came to buy flowers for her greenhouses and arrangements to decorate her home. Unlike Daphne she noticed her son's interest in him and raised her brow when Harry unsubtly and continually turned down her son. He was surprised to see that her respect for him had grown just by not sleeping with her son. Harry thought that she probably had seen many people throw themselves at her son, Pureblood or not. He wished that Madam Malfoy would take her son by the ear and talk to him about proper Pureblood behavior.</p><p>Lord Slytherin had released Daphne Malfoy from her job as his secretary. The girl was complaining about pregnancy and she was barely three months in. He had convinced her that she needed time off to prepare for motherhood and enjoy it without the stress of work. She had gone reluctantly but eventually Tom had gotten rid of her. To his surprise he had only passed on the problem to Harry who was visited more frequently by them. He chuckled at the memory of Harry ranting about the Malfoys being friendless and having nothing better to do with their life than harass a shop owner. He had hired Luna Lovegood, a spacey Pureblood whose family had been neutral during the war. She was so far competent even if she sprouted nonsense at time. “Poor Peverell, his lungs are infested with nargles.” Tom felt a familiarity with the name but couldn't quite pin where he had heard it before. He ignored it since Lovegood usually sprouted nonsense about imaginary creatures and people who were there but not there. “The Gryffindor snake is one of a kind. Once it's gone the world will be the worse for it.” She said airily one day and Tom had questioned her about it but all she replied was; “O Tom, but you've seen it.”</p><p>“You should go see Harry today Tom.” He saw as Lovegood's eyes were firm and serious. “Why?”</p><p>“He misses you, plus he could use the company.”</p><p>Tom thought about her words and was aware of the warmth that expanded in his chest when hearing those words. Gradually over the months the playful banter began and Tom found himself savoring the moments where he had Harry's undivided attention. He had begun to actually <em> like </em> Harry Potter, and found that he wasn't opposed to it as he would have been months ago.</p><p>Harry was positively infuriated; Draco Malfoy could still not take a hint. The man was much more forceful today than usual. “Come on, Potter you have to have some attraction to me. Or is that half-blood slut the reason you don't want to sleep with me.”</p><p>“I'm a half-blood as well Lord Malfoy.” Draco went around the table and cornered him, “but you are a Lord, Potter-Black. I don't see why you're so against this. I could make it enjoyable or not.” Harry hadn't felt a lot of fear in his life but this was one of the moments he was afraid to do act. If he attacked the Pureblood Lord he would probably be killed publicly and he couldn't really scream for help because of his worsening condition. “Please Lord Malfoy I have no interest.” Draco grabbed him by the waist and pinned him to the wall and started to attack his neck. “Stop. Please stop.”</p><p>When he was about to resort to magic he hadn't realized someone had entered. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!”</p><p>Harry looked to the voice with relief while he saw Draco's face turn blank. “Harry here wanted a little foreplay my Lord.” Harry felt complete dread when those words left the mouth of a smug Malfoy.</p><p>“Crucio.”</p><p>Harry expected to be on the floor writhing in pain, but he saw Malfoy on the floor in his stead. “You dare lie to me Draco.” Harry could feel the venom dripping from Tom’s words and so did Malfoy who whimpered on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“I want the truth now Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco stayed on the floor hoping that he would be spared, “I was trying to get Potter to sleep with me.” Tom once again punished Malfoy for overstepping his boundaries and Harry was coming out his shock. “You will know better than lie to me and touch something of mine, Young Draco.” Tom’s fake sweet voice made Harry shiver and act, “Tom, you should stop he has a child to raise and Daphne would never forgive me for letting her husband die in my shop.”</p><p>“Scurry along Malfoy. From now on you will stay away from Harry.”</p><p>“Yes, My Lord.” Malfoy ran like his life depended on it and it probably did.</p><p> </p><p>“You will not interrupt me Harry when I am teaching one of my followers a lesson.” His cold eyes now scanned the young Lord to look at his state. “Sorry, but I didn’t want his ghost haunting my shop. Thanks Tom. Thank you for saving me” Lord Slytherin chuckled at Harry’s humor and let Harry hug him, it was nice to be embraced by Harry. Tom took Harry deeper into the shop away from the open store front, he began to gently nip at Harry’s neck. He felt as Lord Potter hardened when he bit him softly and was pleased with his reaction. “We shall take this to your bed Harry.”</p><p>“I can’t, We can’t do this. I’m sorry Tom.”</p><p> </p><p>Confusion was Tom’s first reactions to Harry’s words and then fury at being rejected just like Malfoy. “You can’t or won’t?”</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t. I told you Tom not to fall in love with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not in love with you Harry but at least I won’t force myself on you like Malfoy.” Tom left furious not seeing the tears that fell from Harry’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Harry picked himself up after crying for a bit on the floor and went to write letters to Anthony and Mandy, the two he would be leaving the store to. He later went to Gringotts and bought a separate flat and hired a house elf to tend to him until he died. Griphook was kind enough to hire a healer for the young Lord, who would check on him and make his episodes more bearable.</p><p> </p><p>“Tom, the Nargles are hovering around you again, would you like me to make you some radish earrings.” The man pierced the strange girl with red eyes but she just smiled wistfully at his sneer. “No, those things are dreadful.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t mean that Tom. You know this is my 12th time in a row going to the shop, but the flowers are mourning.” This caught Tom’s attention, “what are they mourning, my absence?”</p><p>The girl gave him several forms that he needed to fill out by the end of the week and he groaned. “Well they do love you just like their owner. Though they are mourning the absence of their maker.”</p><p>“And I care why?” Luna smiled sadly while staring at one of his office walls, “because when does a flower mourn Tom.”</p><p> </p><p>The realization hit Tom and he fled to the shop where he was greeted by two half-bloods but neither were Harry. “Where is he?” They both looked worry and ready to faint at the anger in those words, “We aren't sure.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean you aren’t sure?”</p><p> </p><p>He knew his growl didn’t help their nerves but he couldn’t bring himself to care. “He just said he probably might not come back due to circumstances and left us a book on how to take care of the flowers. He left us the store and the living quarters above.”</p><p>Alarms were going off in Tom’s head, “I’m going to Gringotts to find out where that idiot went.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry Lord Slytherin but we are not allowed to disclose information about our clientele. It would be bad for business and unprofessional.”</p><p> </p><p>“How much of a fee would it be to get a hint.” He saw as the Goblins smiled and decided that the Malfoy family would be more than happy to pay for the fee. He was ordering the receptionist to find him a permit from Lord Harry James Potter-Black to live in a flat close to Diagon alley.</p><p>He stood in front of the small flat and opened the door, being the Minister of Magical Britain really came in handy sometimes.He heard voices and followed them, he saw as Harry lay in bed and their was someone obviously in healer attire attending to the Lord. He heard the harsh coughing and after it stopped the healer continued talking. This time he was close enough to hear what the man was saying, “the pain relieving potion can only do so much Lord Potter, but it should make your pain a little bit more bearable. I will continue to monitor your progress, yet we can discuss what measures you want taken after you pass away at a later date.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>He saw as Harry looked up with surprise and then fear slowly seep into his expression.</p><p> </p><p>“Tom, what are you doing here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Your dying?”</p><p> </p><p>The shock and anger in his voice must have been evident for the healer looked terrified with the growing possibility of dying with his patient.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked defeated as he met Tom’s eyes, the words he said next were enough.</p><p> </p><p>“I told you not to fall in love with me Tom.”</p>
