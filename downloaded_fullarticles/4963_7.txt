  <strong>LONDON QUIDDITCH LEAGUE VICTORIOUS AGAINST KILKENNY</strong>
</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The London Quidditch League won their match against the Kilkenny Quidditch Squad  270 points to 50 in Saturday past.</p><p>London has long been home to recreational Quidditch teams comprised of former Hogwarts players and amateur enthusiasts alike.  However, it has only been recently that the LQL has organised into a certifiable team.  The growth of the group is largely thanks to the combined efforts of former house captains Roger Davies (Ravenclaw, 1990 – 1997) and Angelina Johnson (Gryffindor, 1989 – 1996).</p><p>“The League is stronger than it's ever been,” Davies said.  “It's been brilliant training alongside my old teammates, as well as some very talented former opponents."</p><p>“The spirit of the League is so positive,” Johnson added.  “We don't want to be playing for the national team.  We're all in it for the love of the sport.”</p><p>The London Quidditch League's next match is 15 March against the Aberdeen Fliers.</p></div>
