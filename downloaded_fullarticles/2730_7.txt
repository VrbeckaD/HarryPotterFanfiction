<p>December Surprise</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“You really want this one?” Harry stares up at the inflatable dragon holding, of all things, inflated candy canes. “Sweetheart, I dunno. It’s not very, erm—”</p>
<p>“Please, Daddy?” Lily Luna looks up at him with those big brown eyes of hers and Harry’s heart melts. </p>
<p>He sighs. “Fine. But I am holding this over you when you’re an adult,” he mutters.</p>
<p>Lily giggles. “Okay!” </p>
<p>Shaking his head (mostly at himself), Harry lets her drag him towards the tent where the proprietor is doing what looks like a brisk business selling trees and assorted holiday garden decorations. </p>
<p>“Hurry, Daddy! We have to get him home!” Lily is practically bouncing. </p>
<p>“All right, sweetheart, but we have to wait for all these other people to make their purchases first.” </p>
<p>“But Mama says we should never have to wait because we’re important—”</p>
<p>“Mama’s not here right now, Lily, it’s just us! We go by my rules!” Harry bites his tongue as Lily blinks up at him. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. I didn’t mean to snap,” he continues more gently. </p>
<p>“It’s okay, Daddy.” More wisdom than there should be in a six-year-old’s eyes gaze up at him. Lily squeezes his hand. “Grandma Molly says I shouldn’t go around saying I’m a Potter because it’s braggadocios. What does braggadocios mean?” </p>
<p>Harry opens his mouth to reply but is interrupted. “It means someone who boasts about their accomplishments, usually someone who doesn’t deserve to. Fortunately, your father does not fall into that category.”</p>
<p>Blinking, Harry turns towards the speaker, only to gape at them. “Snape?!” </p>
<p>“Mr Potter.” Snape looks down at Lily and his expression softens infinitesimally for a moment. “As the lines are long, perhaps I can help you over here.” </p>
<p>“You…work here?” Harry stands there in shock, and it’s only when Lily tugs him into following Snape that he moves. “But you—”</p>
<p>“Disappeared?” Stepping behind the counter, Snape hums. “I do live a more private life these days, yes. And obviously I work here.” The unsaid ‘you idiot’ hangs in the air.</p>
<p>“I tried to find you,” says Harry. “I searched and searched—”</p>
<p>“So I hear.” Snape raises an eyebrow. “Now, how can I help you this evening?” </p>
<p>“We want a dragon,” declares Lily. </p>
<p>“Of course.” Snape doesn’t smile, but something about his expression hints at it. “The one on display is the last one. If that’s acceptable—”</p>
<p>“That’s fine,” says Harry, struggling to reconcile the man before him with his erstwhile professor. “It’s twenty Galleons, right?” </p>
<p>Snape inclines his head. “As it’s the display model, the price is slightly less. Fifteen Galleons.” </p>
<p>“Done.”</p>
<p>“Hooray!” says Lily, and Harry smiles, patting her head. </p>
<p>“This way,” says Snape once Harry hands him the money. “I’ll shrink him for you.” </p>
<p>The dragon is the size of a large Crup when there’s a loud cry. “Noooo!” Harry turns to look and sees a boy about Lily’s age, with a shock of pale blond hair, running towards them. “Not Braxy!” </p>
<p>Snape doesn’t look surprised when the boy flings himself at him. He simply pats his back and says, “Now we discussed this, Scorpius. He’s on sale like everything here.”</p>
<p>“But I like him!” Scorpius turns pleading eyes towards Harry and Lily, blinking when he sees Lily. “Don’t take him!” </p>
<p>“Scorpius.” Snape’s tone is soft, but with underlying steel. “We do not beg.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Scorpius’ eyes well up. </p>
<p>Lily tilts her head. “You can visit him at our house,” she says. “Right, Daddy?” </p>
<p>Harry coughs. “I don’t think—” Scorpius looks up at him pleadingly, and Harry discovers he’s evidently susceptible to all six-year-old’s eyes. “If it’s all right with his parents, then I suppose,” he says weakly.</p>
<p>Scorpius turns his eyes towards Snape, who sighs. “Very well. Since Mr Potter agrees, you may visit.” </p>
<p>Harry blinks. “Wait, <i>you’re</i> his parent?”</p>
<p>“One of them, anyway,” comes a familiar voice. “Hello, Potter.” </p>
<p>Harry gapes as Draco Malfoy comes up behind them and walks over to Snape and Scorpius. “Father!” cries Scorpius. “Papa says I can visit Braxy at their house.” </p>
<p>Malfoy exhales. “Does he?” He shoots Snape an indecipherable look. “We’ll talk about it later.” And bending down, he hands Harry the now small dragon. “Here you go, Potter. Will that be all?” </p>
<p>Mouth working, Harry manages to nod and, pulling Lily with him, he turns and flees. </p>
