  <em>
    <span>Ellis</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The brittle twigs that littered the floor of the dense forest behind Aisling Brooks’s house snapped under Ellis’s feet as she made her way slowly and uncertainly deeper in to the eerily welcoming darkness. And uncertainty was not an often occurrence in Ellis Prewett’s life. She could faintly hear a Muggle stereo playing some Muggle song through the dimly lit windows of the small house behind her. On her right, was Tonks, looking equally dubious. On her left was Ais, who had a mad grin plastered across her dark face, russet eyes glinting with crazed elation. Without a warning, Ais took off sprinting, her long black hair waving like a banner behind her. “Catch me if you cAAAAaaaan!” she taunted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks rolled their eyes and muttered something about “stupid bloody Gryffindors.” Ellis entirely understood. They did understand each other very well; something to do with living in the same room at school. The Hufflepuff pair reluctantly started jogging after their jubilant friend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks had changed their hair to a dusky green, almost black color. It wasn’t very attractive, but it did blend in well with their dark, sinister surroundings. Ellis, on the other hand, did not have metamorphic abilities, and had a black hoodie on to hide her electric turquoise hair, which had been a result of a mistake in Transfiguration class at Hogwarts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ais, galloping and bouncing over tree roots like she did it every day (which, Ellis reflected, she probably did. Who wouldn’t if they had </span>
  <em>
    <span>this </span>
  </em>
  <span>as their backyard?), was now singing at the top of her voice. Ellis couldn’t quite make out the words, but it sure sounded like “We all live in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine!” Ellis had grown up around wizards and witches and only had a vague idea of what a submarine was, but even with her limited knowledge on the subject, she knew that that made approximately zero sense. Ais was a decently straightforward girl, or, at least, as straight-forward as a thirteen-year-old girl could be. The music that she listened to was questionable.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Looking around, Ellis began to realize that the woods were quite beautiful, despite her initial misgivings. She could see the moonshadows of the silver birch trees and the three young girls, now laughing and bounding through the forest, all cast by the big, milky-white full moon that hung almost directly above their heads.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The trio were not supposed to be out here.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In fact, they had only a couple of minutes ago sneaked out of Ais’s bedroom window. At eleven-thirty at night. Right under the Gryffindor girl’s Muggle mum’s nose.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ais stopped abruptly in a small mossy clearing and waited for her friends to catch up. When they did, gasping and panting for breath but exhilarated from running, she turned her face to the midnight sky and howled playfully. She finished and reached out to hold Tonks’s right hand, and Ellis’s left. “This is what I wanted to show you,” she said quietly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Silver beams of moonlight shone through the thinner part of the leafy canopy. Ellis extended her free hand, palm-up, and watched the little circles of light dance as she shifted her hand left-to-right in front of her. A soft breeze blew into Ellis’s face, pushing her hood back ever so slightly. Even the few strands of vibrant hair that fluttered in front of her face looked silvery. It seemed to radiate magic. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Everything </span>
  </em>
  <span>around her seemed to radiate magic, pulsing with the massive power of something just beyond human reach. She briefly entertained the idea that perhaps Muggles were more in tune with this kind of magic than witches, without already having their minds cluttered with the more visible, touchable magic of the wizarding world.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Wow,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” she whispered. Tonks nodded emphatically. Ais grinned at them in an </span>
  <em>
    <span>I-told-you-so</span>
  </em>
  <span> sort of way. But the grin faded quickly and her whole body stiffened as she spotted something ahead. Ellis and Tonks both whirled around and followed her eyes to the same place, frantically searching for movement, or anything –</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two glowing, golden eyes, glinting with malevolence, but also holding the anticipation of a predator who had just pin-pointed its prey.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Wolf.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Ellis wasn’t sure who had said it. It might’ve been her. But whoever it was, they most certainly weren’t wrong. The beast slunk from the undergrowth and into the light. It had tawny fur that was covered with overlapping, interlocking scars, some so fresh they were still red and oozing -- Ellis could actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>smell</span>
  </em>
  <span> the blood on it</span>
  <em>
    <span>.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Had it fought with another wolf? That seemed to be the only possibility, unless it had done that to </span>
  <em>
    <span>itself… No. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Ellis mentally shook off the idea – there was no reason any animal would do that. The monster bared its razor-sharp teeth, which were also stained red. It was so thin, she could see its ribs jutting out, though this did not make it at all less terrifying. Its thin black pupils slid back and forth over the three girls in rhythm with its deliberate footsteps. Tonks seemed to be unable to move, rooted to the spot and hyperventilating. Ais backed into a tree and fell to the ground. Not moving her eyes even the slightest bit, Ellis reached down and scooped up a jagged rock about twice the size of her fist and held it next to her head, ready to strike at any moment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The eyes stopped moving. It had made its decision. And those terrible eyes were fixed right on Ais…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Quicker than any creature should be able to run, than any rock could be thrown, the giant wolf sprung at Ais, pinning her to the ground by the shoulders with two massive paws. Ellis grabbed Tonks’s arm tugged hard, jerking the Metamorphmagus back into the real world. She flung the rock at the wolf, hoping to stop it before it could do any harm to her friend, but it was too late. Ais was screaming, and those huge, glinting teeth sank mercilessly in to the girl’s side.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wolf stepped back, but kept its eyes glued to Ais expectantly. Ais’s screams faded to whimpers and she curled on to her side instinctively, trying to escape the pain. Her entire body was shaking violently. With no small effort, she opened her mouth and moaned, “Not a wolf…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And suddenly, it clicked in Ellis’s mind. No wolf would behave like this, it wouldn’t simply bite, then step back and abandon a meal. Because if it wasn’t a wolf, then it had to be…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Run!” she exclaimed, dragging Tonks with her and sprinting towards the house.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But Ais…” Tonks called back, trying desperately to pull back, to help the injured girl behind them. But Ellis knew that nothing could be done, that she would be changing already, and no one could stop it. So she just yelled back, “RUN, DAMN IT!” and Tonks seemed to give in and silently agree.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis would never know how they made it back to the house. Adrenaline, she told herself. They burst in through the back door, and both collapsed to the floor, gasping for breath. Everything seemed to replay in Ellis’s mind. The trees, the moonshadows, the clearing, the werewolf, and the big, beautiful, milky moon that hung uncaringly over it all. Looking out the kitchen window, Ellis didn’t think the moon looked beautiful anymore. Leaning on the glossy counter top, Ellis burst into tears, sobbing, because her best friend was a werewolf… She couldn’t even think about what would happen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks looked at her, apparently confused but none the less horrified. “I don’t understand –”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ais was right. It wasn’t a wolf.” Ellis cut Tonks off mid sentence. “It was a werewolf,” she finished in a whisper.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks was staring at nothing. “So that means…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis nodded grimly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ais’s mum burst suddenly in to the room. “What happened? Where’s Ais?” she was yelling. Ellis could hardly hear her. Tonks was explaining in sobs what had happened, but Ellis couldn’t even make out the words that were coming from their mouth. The message was still sinking in, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ais is a werewolf, Ais is a werewolf, she’s a werewolf…</span>
  </em>
  <span>” At the same time, a million questions were spiraling through her head. Would she still be the same person? Would she be able to go back to Hogwarts? Would she even </span>
  <em>
    <span>survive the night</span>
  </em>
  <span>, all alone out in the woods, taken over by another body, another mind?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis was pulled back in to the world of the living by a hand tapping repeatedly on her upper arm. Her eyes moved reluctantly up and met Tonks’s. The Metamorphmagus’s cheeks were streaked with tears. Ellis was suddenly filled with gratitude that Tonks had been able to be the strong one and take charge when things got rough. “Do you have any floo powder?” they asked softly. “We need to contact St. Mungo’s.” Ellis nodded numbly. Of course she did – she carried floo powder with her everywhere.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s upstairs.” She pushed herself up with her elbows and padded up the staircase to Ais’s bedroom where she had dropped her belongings. She rummaged through her clothes, books, toiletries; things that didn’t matter anymore; until she unburied the small bag filled with what appeared to be just fine sand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just when she was about to leave the room, Ellis stopped and looked around, trying not to think that Ais might never step foot in that room again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks was waiting at the bottom of the stairs. Their hair had faded to its natural brown and their eyes were fixed firmly on the tile floor. They looked up the slightest bit, just to take the floo powder, but still didn’t make eye contact. Tonks held out their hand, which Ellis dropped the bag in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are we going to do now?” Tonks asked in a frightened whisper.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t know. But I suppose we can’t do anything until the moon sets.” She uttered an exhausted sigh and paced to the living room, where she collapsed on the sofa. Tonks followed, curling close next to their friend. Ms. Brooks followed uncertainly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The night seemed to drag on for years rather than hours. The three sat in an unnerving silence that no one dared to break.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Weak rays of sun were beginning to shine through the sitting room window. Ellis and Tonks jumped up at the exact same moment and rushed over to the fireplace. Tonks tossed in a pinch of the floo powder and said clearly, “Saint Mungo’s Hospital!” In an instant the dying flames flared up and turned bright green. Tonks looked over at the other three expectantly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You have to walk through the flames,” Ellis addressed Ais’s mum. “Don’t worry, it won’t hurt you. Just keep your elbows in.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Looking very confused, but apparently realizing she had no better options, Ms. Brooks complied.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After a few moments of the familiar, uncomfortable spinning sensation, the flitting images in front of Ellis’s eyes slowed down and settled on the bright, too-clean-to-be-comfortable waiting room of St. Mungo’s. Ms. Brooks stumbled unsteadily out of the fireplace. The white walls of the hospital seemed to mock their dire situation. The Welcome Witch looked like she could fall asleep at any moment. She didn’t even look up as they came through the fire.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY!” Ellis screamed. The Welcome Witch’s head shot up, eyes wide.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What? What happened?” She stuttered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis and Tonks approached the desk at a rapid pace. “Werewolf bite,” Tonks announced.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That was all it took. The Welcome Witch swore loudly and shouted an incantation that Ellis didn’t recognize, causing a silver chinchilla to burst from her wand. It scampered apparently through a wall and disappeared. She turned back to the three waiting nervously before her. “I’m sorry, misses, we’ll ask for your information later, in situations such as these –”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She didn’t have time to finish. Three aurors apparated suddenly, one of them – who had a wooden leg and one too-big, vibrant blue eye, which seemed to move independently of the other – holding a silver instrument that Ellis recognized as a werewolf detector. “Take us to the location,” he ordered gruffly. He addressed Ms. Brooks, but it was Tonks who nodded and threw more powder into the fire, shouting the address.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She’s a muggle,” Ellis explained to the aurors, trusting that they would understand that she was talking about Ais’s mum, not Tonks, before jumping through the floo herself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The journey through floo had never felt longer before.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wooden-legged man hobbled hastily out of the fire just seconds after Ellis had found herself sprawled on the floor. She had to scramble out of the way to avoid being squashed. The auror ignored Ellis as if she were just another piece of furniture. She could hear him barking orders to the other aurors, but couldn’t take in anything they were saying -- everything was just a blur of dark blue robes and early morning light. She hadn’t kept track of time, but it couldn’t be much later than five-thirty. Birdsong drifted through the windows, carefree and blissfully unaware of what had taken place the night before.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The half hour before the aurors returned could’ve been decades. But at long last, they returned through the back door. The wooden-legged auror led the others inside. Ellis noticed that while his apparently magical electric-blue eye was whizzing around, taking in his surroundings, the dark, human eye remained fixed on Ais, who was unconscious in his arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis had to force down a scream at the sight of her friend’s body. It seemed that she had retained her clothes through the transformation, but they were completely torn, and blood leaked from slashes all over her body. On her left side, the crimson, crescent-moon-shaped  bite mark was clearly visible. A sobbing Ms. Brooks leaped forwards to snatch her daughter from the auror’s hands. He visibly hesitated before allowing her to do so.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tears ran down Ms. Brook’s face, eventually dripping off her chin and onto Ais’s side as the aurors stood in a tight huddle, talking in hushed voices. The one with the magical eye turned suddenly and fixed both his mismatched eyes on Tonks. Ellis realized that she had almost forgotten that her friend was there.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey, you, kid,” he barked. “You still got that floo powder?” Tonks gave a frightened nod and handed him the small bag. He took it in his rough hands and shouted, “Saint Mungos!” as he took a pinch and tossed it in the fire, then gestured to the rest of them to follow through the flames.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“First floor!” was the first thing Ellis heard as she emerged from the flames for the third time, coughing and spitting out a chunk of soot in her mouth. The Welcome Witch nodded, and another conjured silvery chinchilla flew through the wall. Most of the aurors were just standing awkwardly after emerging from the fire, until the wooden-legged one shouted, “Well? Go on then! I’ve got this covered!” The two other Aurors nodded and hurriedly disapperated.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Two white-robed healers burst suddenly through a door behind the desk, one levitating a stretcher. The other ran to Ms. Brooks and lifted Ais onto it. The healers said nothing to the others as they ran off, stretcher trailing behind them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once again, the old, mismatched-eyed auror turned to the three with a sigh. “Alastor Moody,” he said, extending his hand to Ms. Brooks. She shook it timidly. “I’d better be off to see what’s going on. Wait here.” And with that he was gone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis collapsed into one of the waiting room chairs. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Why, why is it that we are always the ones </span>
  </em>
  <span>waiting</span>
  <em>
    <span>? </span>
  </em>
  <span>she thought bitterly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If the situation hadn’t been so grim, Ellis probably would have found it fairly interesting how each of them expressed their anxiety. Tonks, having always been fairly fidgety, was pacing across the room. Ms. Brooks fidgeted with the hem of her shirt and kept checking her watch. Ellis, on the other hand, curled into a tight ball in her armchair, hugging her arms around her knees. She ignored the tears that were filling her eyes. Surely Ais would wake soon, right? Ellis had read some books on werewolves, but they had all depicted them as nothing but bloodthirsty monsters. But that couldn’t be Ais, right?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Right?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>=)0O0(=</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was almost noon before they heard anything. It was Moody who hobbled in and gestured for them to follow him. They walked in silence through some twisting hallways and up through a lift. When they emerged, Ellis was face to face with a sign across the hall that read:</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>First Floor</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Creature-Induced Injuries</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>(Bites, stings, burns, embedded spines, etc.)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shuddering, Ellis continued along with the others for a while longer, before Moody stopped abruptly in front of a closed white door, opening it slowly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The interior of the room was as white as everything else in the hospital. Yet another white-robed healer sat in a chair next to the bed, on which Ais lay on her side, facing them, but her eyes were shut tightly. She’d been dressed in loose (white, of course) hospital clothes which covered the bite, but Ellis could see bandages wrapped around her arms, so she assumed that her torso had been bandaged too. She also assumed that cleaning spells had been used to vanish all of the blood.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis was getting </span>
  <em>
    <span>sick</span>
  </em>
  <span> of white. In fact, the small amount of Ais’s coffee-colored skin that was still visible underneath all of those </span>
  <em>
    <span>white</span>
  </em>
  <span> bandages was the most colorful thing in the room. Seriously, had these people even heard of color?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Moody stepped into the room first, Ms. Brooks hurrying in behind him and rushing to kneel at her daughter’s side. Ellis bit her lip as she crept in with Tonks at her side. The Hufflepuffs eventually settled beside Ms. Brooks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ais’s mother reached out cautiously and closed both her hands around one of Ais’s. There was a moment of slightly nervous silence from everyone in the room, including the healer, who still had his eyes fixed on Ais. Ellis had felt it was safe to assume that her friend was unconscious, as she hadn’t visibly responded to any of them entering, or, now, her mother’s protective inclination. It therefore came as a surprise to her when Ais’s other hand moved to lay on top of Ms. Brook’s.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ms. Brooks gasped and leaned in towards her daughter. “Ais?” she said softly and slightly breathlessly. “Aisling, are you awake?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ais cracked open her eyes. Her mother pulled her hands away as Ais tried to prop herself up on her elbows, only to collapse on her pillow with a whimper that sounded far more canine than human. She opened her eyes again, slowly this time. Hesitantly, she held out a hand to Ellis and Tonks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis could see the hurt in Ais’s eyes when both flinched away. She could barely hear her whisper, “I’m still the same person. I haven’t changed.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>=)0O0(=</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Later that day, when they had left the hospital room, Moody approached them again. “Look,” he growled. “Werewolves aren’t treated well in the magical world. You’ll have to be careful. Dumbledore will let her back to Hogwarts though, he’s done it before.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis briefly wondered about what he meant by about “he’s done it before,” but that was soon pushed to the back of her mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The ministry doesn’t like it, but frankly they’re too terrified of him to do anything about it,” Moody continued. “She’s been contaminated, obviously, but arrangements can be made for full moons. Like I said, Dumbledore’s had a student before under similar circumstances. This won’t be much of a problem for him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ellis felt that she had never really given Ms. Brooks the admiration that she deserved. For someone who had only known that magic existed for two years, and had just about sixteen hours ago discovered that </span>
  <em>
    <span>werewolves </span>
  </em>
  <span>existed, it was remarkable how well she handled her daughter becoming one. Determination and love shone in her ice-blue eyes as she nodded to everything that Moody said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After a short pause, Moody looked at all of them and offered a smile that surprisingly didn’t look that out of place on his old, worn face. “Also, do call me Mad-Eye. Everyone does.”</span>
</p>
