    <p>The people were rushing around to get places, thank goodness Hagrid's so tall. I would've lost him otherwise. Here I was, in Diagon Alley. </p><p>Let me start from the beginning. I'm Harry Potter, some people in the Leakey Cauldron called me 'the boy who lived'. Hagrid had told me, that when I was a baby my parents were killed by voldemort, he didn't like the name. I was sent to live with the Dursleys, it was more like being a slave... But let's not get into that. When I got my Hogwarts letter,  uncle Vernon tried to run away from them. It didn't work.  But now I'm here... I think it's a dream. </p><p>"All yeh need now is some robes, go on 'Arry, " he pushed my towards Madam Malkins and said, "I got some business ter' do. I'll meet yeh 'ere.." I walked into the robes shop to be greeted by a woman,  <br/>"Hello dear, Hogwarts? " before I could nod my head she carried on saying, " come along then, we've got another boy going to Hogwarts too. " There was a boy stood on a stool, he had slicked back platnumn blond hair and emerald green robes. I stood on a stool and somebody started measuring me. </p><p>After a few minutes silence the boy spoke up, <br/>"What house do you want to be in? " I gave him a confused look, "oh. Are you a mudblood, " another confused look, "muggle born? " I shook my head. <br/>"My parents weren't muggles, no. " He gave me a smile, "um... What, what d'you mean house? " This time, he gave me a confused look.<br/>"The Hogwarts houses are: Slytherin, Griffindor,  Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. I'm going to be slytherin." The boy got done and walked away waving calling I'll see you at school as he went. </p><p>I hope I see him again, I want us to be friends.</p>
