    <p>*Please note, I have never written any FanFic before so please be kind* *Comments and Votes are very much appreciated*</p><p>Â </p><p>It's a Wednesday evening and Harry hadn't been back at Hogwarts long after the summer holidays when he starts to notice Draco Malfoy acting strange. Malfoy hadn't insulted him once all day and Harry even thought he'd caught Malfoy staring at him a few times during potions, however, when Harry looked up and over at Malfoy he just smiled and went back to his potion. It wasn't that snarky smirk kind of smile either, it seemed genuine which just confused Harry even more. </p><p>Lying in bed that night listening to his fellow Gryffindors snores Harry decided to check on the Marauders Map to see what Malfoy was doing. Not expecting to see anything Harry was surprised to see Malfoy pacing back and forth in the Slytherin common room. Suddenly an idea struck Harry, he grabbed his inkpot, quill and a piece of parchment and scribbled out a note to Malfoy. </p><p>Malfoy, <br/>            What are you doing awake? It's 3 am.<br/>                                               X</p><p>Harry crept over to the window where an owl sat perched on the windowsill. He attached the letter to the owl's leg and told her "Wait for a Reply, Make sure he gives you one" The owl flew away into the night.</p><p>(Dracos POV)</p><p>Draco was pacing and if he wasn't careful he'd walk a hole in the dam rug at his rate. 3 am and yet again he couldn't sleep. He was so caught up in his own thoughts he didn't notice the owl land on the windowsill outside so when the bird tapped on the window he jumped a mile. Confused Draco opened the window to let the owl in, who would be writing to him at this time of the morning? Taking the note from the owl he began to read, suddenly feeling like he was being watched he looked around the common room when suddenly the owl nipped at his fingers. "Ouch," He exclaimed, "What the bloody hell did you do that for?" "You want a reply now?" The owl hooted as if in response "Fine, Hang on a minute" </p><p>Seriously Who is this? <br/>Who writes to people at 3 am without telling them who you are?</p><p>Also, how do you know I'm awake?</p><p>Why are you awake?<br/>Malfoy</p><p>Draco attached the letter to the owl and she flew away.  After watching the owl fly into the night wondering if this night could get any stranger, Draco returned to pacing before deciding to settle onto the couch to await a reply. </p><p>(Harry's POV)</p><p>Harry saw the owl return and rushed to take the letter from her, he raced back to his bed to read Draco's reply. Suddenly very aware of the butterflies in his stomach and the excitement he was feeling at getting a reply from Malfoy. Trying to shake off these feelings Harry read the letter smiling to himself he prepared to write his reply. </p><p>Malfoy,</p><p>I believe I asked you first why you're awake.<br/>Glad to see you've stopped pacing.<br/>X</p><p>Harry attached the letter to the owl's leg and sent her on her way with the same instructions as before to ensure he got a reply.</p><p>(Draco's POV)</p><p>Another tap on the window told Draco the owl was back "Why did I even bother closing the window?" he mumbled to himself whilst letting the owl in, this time leaving the window open. Sitting back on the couch he read the letter and smiled. Draco picked up his quill to reply. </p><p>I'm awake because I'm having relationship issues. Now it's your turn why are you awake?<br/>How did you know I was pacing? Are you watching me?<br/>Who are you?<br/>Malfoy x</p><p>Shaking his head he gave the letter to the owl and she flew off, this time he didn't bother closing the window before returning to the couch. </p><p>(Harry's POV)</p><p>Harry laughed when he read Malfoy's reply and couldn't wait to send one back. </p><p>Malfoy,<br/>Relationship problems? Why don't you tell me about them? Might help!<br/>Don't worry I'm not watching you, I Can't see you.<br/>Why am I awake? Kind of the same reason as you but different<br/>H x</p><p>H,<br/>H is it now? Well, we're getting closer to a name.<br/>I Can't tell you what if you tell people?<br/>How can you have the same problems as me but different?</p><p>Malfoy x</p><p>Malfoy,<br/>That's as close as you're getting for now.<br/>I won't tell anyone I'm not like that, honest.<br/>I'm having sexuality issues.<br/>H x</p><p>H,<br/>Sexuality issues? So you're gay? That's not a problem though, is it? You'd be surprised how similar our situations are. Okay so I'm gay and the guy I like won't ever like me back EVER!</p><p>I have no idea why I'm telling you this, you could be anyone.<br/>Draco x</p><p>Draco,<br/>Wow, Thank You for trusting me with that! Does anybody else know?<br/>How do you know the guy you like doesn't like you back? How could he not?<br/>I'm in the same situation though, the guy I like, HA he would freak out if he knew how I felt about him. Maybe in a parallel universe, he'd like me back. <br/>Wow we've been writing for hours, My dorm mates will be awake soon, maybe we can continue writing after classes?<br/>See you at breakfast<br/>H x<br/>p.s here's a clue as to who I am...I'm not a Slytherin x</p><p>Harry rushed to get ready for breakfast, he'd never been so excited to get to the great hall before and Ron and Hermionie seemed to be taking forever to get ready. "Come on Ron, Hurry up" Exclaimed Harry "Mate, why are you in such a rush this morning?" replied Ron "I'm erm, just hungry" answered Harry defensively.</p><p>Practically bouncing up and down Harry tried to hurry Ron up as they walked down to the Gryffindor common room to meet up with Hermione. "What's the rush boys?" asked Hermione "Harry is apparently starving this morning" answered Ron. Hermione watched Harry carefully noticing that he seemed to have an extra bounce in his step that morning. </p><p>As the trio entered the great hall, it took everything Harry had not to look over at the Slytherin table for Malfoy. Just then Draco walked into the great hall hand in hand with Pansy Parkinson and Harry's stomach dropped. </p><p>Having been watching Harry carefully Hermione noticed Harry's expression change. "Since when have Draco and Pansy been an item?" asked Harry sounding way more annoyed then he meant to. Suddenly everything made sense to Hermione, Harry had finally realised he was crushing on Malfoy, stifling a laugh Hermionie took a sip of her pumpkin juice. </p><p>"No idea mate, Why do you care? And since when did you call Malfoy by his first name?" Asked Ron confused. Hermione rolled her eyes, sometimes she wondered how her two friends navigated the world with them both being so oblivious. </p><p>"Wha...What I don't care and that's his name isn't it?" Snapped Harry suddenly standing up to leave. "I thought you were starving, where you going?" asked Ron. "Lost my appetite" mumbled Harry as he left the great hall.</p><p>Just as Harry left a letter landed on the table for him, Hermione grabbed it before Ron could, saying "I'll give that to Harry in potions"</p><p>(Draco's POV) </p><p>Draco watched as Harry stormed out of the great hall with a face like thunder, he looked over at the Gryffindor table to find Hermione staring at him as if telling him to go after Harry. Without thinking Draco jumped up and ran out of the great hall. Once in the corridor, he realised he'd taken to long and Harry was gone. He was deciding what to do next when he felt a tap on his shoulder, he spun round to find Hermione stood there "Library" is all she said before turning around and disappearing back into the great hall.  </p><p>Draco ran to the library, he searched the stacks till right at the back in the furthest corner he found Harry, sat on the floor knees bent and arms wrapped tight around himself. "Potter," Said Draco. Harry jumped not realising anyone was there. "Malfoy? What do you want?" snarled Harry.  "You alright?" Asked Draco, shocked Harry remained quiet for a few seconds before standing up and  looking Draco right in the eye he shouted: "You confuse the hell out of me, you know that?" "Me, What'd I do?" Asked Draco shocked.</p><p>Still shouting Harry said "You say your gay and the guy you like won't ever like you back then you waltz into the great hall hand in hand with Pansy bloody Parkinson. WHAT THE HELL" "Wai..What, wait a minute your H? H as in Harry" stammered Draco but before Harry could answer Draco had slammed their mouths together, pushing Harry against the stacks. Shocked but pleased Harry returned Draco's kiss, slipping his hand into the nape of Draco's neck and the other onto his hips pulling him closer.</p><p>What seemed like hours but could only have been minutes passed by, the boys finally broke apart staring at each other before Draco said "See you in potions Potter"</p>
