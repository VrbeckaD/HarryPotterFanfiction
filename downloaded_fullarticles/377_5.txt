  <strong>London – 1997, September 2<sup>nd</sup>, Tuesday</strong>
</p><p>The trio had been watching the Ministry for weeks, calculating a plan. Harry knew that Hermione’s plan was very well formulated and should work without a hitch, but for some reason, he just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was going to go wrong, though it could have just been the argument the night before. He hadn’t slept well that night thanks to the vision he’d gotten from Voldemort, and he ended up getting up a few hours before they had to leave. He stayed in his room until Ron came to get him, the pair going downstairs to eat breakfast with Hermione.</p><p>The group ate in relative silence before getting up again to go upstairs. Behind them, Kreacher promised to have steak and kidney pies prepared for them by the time they got back.</p><p>“Bless him,” said Ron fondly. “And to think I used to fantasise about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.”</p><p>Harry snorted and glanced at his friend, grinning. “I think we all did at one stage.”</p><p>They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square. Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry.</p><p>After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was deserted, except for a couple of large bins; as the first Ministry workers did not usually appear until at least eight o’clock.</p><p>Hermione started to go over the plan again before Ron shut her up with a ‘We know Hermione’. Within a half hour, the three were all disguised and sneaking into the Ministry. Eventually, after a few hiccups, they managed to find Umbridge, and by extension, the locket. And the real problems started after that.</p><p>When Harry stunned Umbridge in his rage at her blatant lie about the origins of the locket, her prowling cat patronus holding the dementors at bay vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind, and Yaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble only to see Harry’s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but Harry’s “Stupefy!” hit him before he could.</p><p>Hermione cried out to Harry, reminding him about Mrs. Cattermole and the dementors. He quickly whirled around, throwing off his invisibility cloak. Below the raised platform, the dementors had moved out of their corners and were gliding towards the woman chained to the chair in the middle of the room. Whether it was because the patronus had vanished, or because they sensed their masters were no longer in control, they had seemed to abandon their restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrifying scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin, forcing her head back.</p><p>“EXPECTO PATRONUM!” Harry shouted, his silver stag patronus soaring from the tip of Harry’s wand, leaping toward the dementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag’s light, more powerful and more warming than the cat’s protection, filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around the room.</p><p>“Get the horcrux,” he told Hermione as he ran down the steps towards Mrs. Cattermole, stuffing the invisibility cloak in his bag.</p><p> “You?” she whispered, gazing into his face. “But – but Reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning!”</p><p>“Did I?” Harry muttered, tugging at the chains binding her arms, “Well, I’ve had a change of heart. Diffindo!” Nothing happened. “Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains?”</p><p>“Wait, I’m trying something up here –“</p><p>“Hermione, we’re surrounded by dementors!”</p><p>“I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket’s gone… I need to duplicate it – Geminio! There, that should fool her…” Hermione came running downstairs. “Let’s see… Relashio!”</p><p>The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before. “I don’t understand,” she whispered.</p><p>“You’re going to leave here with us,” Harry told her, pulling her to her feet. “Go home, grab your children, and get out. Get out of the country if you’ve got to. Disguise yourselves and run. You’ve seen how it is, you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here.”</p><p>“Harry,” Hermione started quietly. “How are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door?”</p><p>“Patronuses,” Harry answered, pointing his wand at his own. The stag slowed and walked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door. “As many as we can muster. Do yours, Hermione.”</p><p>“Expec – Expecto patronum,” Hermione said. Nothing happened.</p><p>“It’s the only spell she ever has trouble with,” Harry told a very confused Mrs. Cattermole. “Bit unfortunate, really. Come on Hermione!”</p><p>“Expecto patronum!” Hermione cried out. A silver otter burst from the end of her wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag.</p><p>“C’mon,” Harry urged, leading Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door.</p><p>When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back on both sides of them, melding into the darkness, scattering before the silver stag and otter.</p><p>“It’s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families,” Harry told the waiting Muggle-borns, who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering slightly. “Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That’s the… Erm… New official position. Now, if you’ll just follow the Patronuses, you’ll be able to leave the Atrium.”</p><p>They managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted, but as they approached the lifts Harry started to have reservations. If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside it while accompanied by twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them.</p><p>“Reg!” Mrs. Cattermole screamed, and she threw herself into Ron’s arms. “Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he’s told all of us to leave the country. I think we’d better do it, Reg, I really do. Let’s hurry home and fetch the children and,” she paused, studying him. “Why are you so wet?”</p><p>“Water,” Ron muttered, separating himself from her. “Harry, they know there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge’s office door. I reckon we’ve got five minutes if that.“</p><p>Hermione’s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to Harry.<br/>“Harry, if we’re trapped here-!”</p><p>“We won’t be if we move fast,” Harry cut in. He turned to address the silent group behind them, who were all gawping at him. “Who’s got wands?”</p><p>About half of them raised their hands.</p><p>“Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has. We’ll need to be fast before they stop us. Come on.”</p><p>The group managed to cram themselves into two lifts and Harry’s Patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise.</p><p>“Level eight,” the witch’s cool voice said, “Atrium.”</p><p>Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off.</p><p>“Harry!” Hermione squeaked. “What are we going to-?”</p><p>“STOP!” Harry thundered, and as the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the Atrium, the wizards sealing the fireplaces froze.</p><p>“Follow me,” he then whispered to the group of terrified Muggle-borns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and Hermione.</p><p>The balding wizard that had followed Harry out of the fireplace earlier looked to them. “What’s up, Albert?’ he asked, looking nervous.</p><p>“This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,” said Harry with all the authority he could muster. The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another.</p><p>“We’ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone-“</p><p>“Are you contradicting me?” Harry interrupted. “Would you like me to have your family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell’s?”</p><p>“Sorry!” the balding wizard gasped out, backing away. “I didn’t mean nothing, Albert, but I thought… I thought they were in for questioning and…”</p><p>“Their blood is pure,” Harry stated, and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall. “Purer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go,” he boomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and fearful.</p><p>Then…</p><p>“Mary!”</p><p>Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting but pale and ashen, had just come running out of a lift.</p><p>“R- Reg?” She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.</p><p>The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other. “Hey – what’s going on? What is this?”</p><p>“Seal the exit! SEAL IT!” a new voice yelled.</p><p>Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces, into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending him flying through the air.</p><p>“He’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!” Harry shouted.</p><p>The balding wizard’s colleagues set up and uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, “My wife! Who was that with my wife? What’s going on?”</p><p>Harry saw Yaxley’s head turn and saw an inkling of truth dawn on his brutish face.</p><p>“Come on!” Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley sent a strange looking curse sailing towards Harry’s back, which hit him square in the middle of his back. They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Entirely unaware he’d been hit with a curse, Harry flung open the door to find Ron standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole.</p><p>“Reg, I don’t understand-“ she cried.</p><p>“Let go, I’m not your husband! You’ve got to go home!” Ron protested.</p><p>There was a noise in the cubicle behind them and Harry looked around to find that Yaxley had just appeared.</p><p>“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot.</p><p>Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing hands, but something was very wrong… Hermione’s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip and there was a sudden, burning pain in his back.</p><p>He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were Ron’s arm and Hermione’s fingers, which were slowly slipping away…</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Hogwarts – 1944, September 5<sup>th</sup>, Tuesday</strong>
</p><p>As school days went, it had been a pretty uneventful day for Tom Riddle. He’d gotten up at his usual time, and had gone for a nice long walk before returning to catch breakfast, dining with his friends. After that, the group of seventh years had classes until lunch.</p><p>After lunch, Tom had managed to sneak away to the Chamber to spend time with the basilisk, returning to the school in time for his class that afternoon. He had a relaxed dinner with the other Slytherins, ignoring the rest of the school, until finally, he had to go on his rounds after curfew. He found a few students out of bed whom he sent off with a warning.</p><p>Overall, a very uneventful and boring day at Hogwarts.</p><p>That is, until there was a loud bang from a corridor to his right. Going to check it, his wand out, he found a boy slumped over against the wall. He looked to be rather young, maybe a fifth year, and he sported messy, black hair and pale skin. Beside him lay a wand and a pair of broken glasses. The boy wore a strange clothing, and was unfamiliar to Tom, but as Head Boy, he quickly moved into action, checking to see if the strange male was breathing before trying to wake him.</p><p>That failing, he gathered the wand and broken glasses before levitating the boy, taking him to the hospital wing.</p><p>The mediwitch was, understandably, very shocked at the appearance of the boy, getting Tom to put him on a bed before casting a multitude of diagnostic charms on him. With each result, she grew more and more concerned. “Tom, please fetch Headmaster Dippet and Professor Slughorn,” she asked of the Slytherin.</p><p>Tom gave her a nod, casting a glance at the boy he’d found before turning to do as was requested of him.</p><p>He returned a little while later with Professor Slughorn and Headmaster Dippet, frowning a little when he saw that the boy had yet to wake up.</p><p>“What can you tell us?” Headmaster Dippet asked of the mediwitch, managing to hide his surprise rather well. Professor Slughorn, however, wasn’t as skilled at hiding his surprise.</p><p>“This boy has been through hell and back,” the mediwitch said sadly. “There’s signs of both magical and muggle abuse, bones that had broken and never been set properly. He’s severely malnourished and he’s tiny for his age.”</p><p>“How old is he?” Tom asked curiously.</p><p>“He’s 17,” the mediwitch answered to everyone’s shock. “Horace, I need nutrition potions, and everything else you can think of to help him.”</p><p>The potions professor nodded. “Yes, of course,” he said before hurrying off to get the potions for him.</p><p>Whilst they waited for Slughorn’s return, Headmaster Dippet and the mediwitch moved to her office to talk while Tom remained with the boy, his ever curious mind trying to solve the puzzle that he came with.</p><p>With Slughorn’s return, the mediwitch dosed the boy with a slew of potions while telling the men gathered that she didn’t know when he’d wake up, but that he’d need to take the potions for at least a month and that she’d like for him to either remain in the hospital wing or at Hogwarts.</p><p>It was then that Tom finally spoke up. “I can keep an eye on him when he wakes up. My friends and I won’t mind helping him with classes either,” he offered, looking to Headmaster Dippet.</p><p>The headmaster nodded after a moment, nodding. “Very well. We’ll have to ask the boy, of course, but at least we now have a plan. Tom, why don’t you go to bed? It’s very late and you have classes tomorrow.”</p><p>Tom nodded in response to the headmaster and cast one last glance at the boy before leaving, all the while thinking; ‘This will be interesting’.</p>
