    <p class="ql-long-8161715"> </p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Someone is <em>staring</em> at him.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">This is not some ordinary spying. Harry doesn't think he is being watched by a pair of eyes behind a tree or a cabin. It is something cold, as if it is attached to the back of his head, like a sticky, smelly doughnut, cold as ice.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">They seized the Locket of Slytherin in the Ministry the other day, and just within a few seconds, they exposed their safe house, Grimmauld, to the enemies when apparating. Now, they are on the run.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry starts to suspect if a Death Eater has followed them here. Ron is injured. They have no food. They are starving. If there is a Death Eater around at this moment, they are doomed. But no matter where he searches, Harry doesn't find anyone suspicious. He can't help asking Hermione whether her spells and jinxes of protection are reliable. She seems offended.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I don't think anyone would find us, Harry,'' says Hermione. ''If anyone hostile<em> does </em>approach, my spells will warn us.''</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">''Sure.'' Harry quits it. Either Hermione is wrong, or he has an illusion. Maybe he's just too intense. Ron begins moaning in pain. Harry gets up and puts on the Invisibility Cloak. ''I'll try to get some food. There is a muggle street nearby." Hermione nods at him and lets him out of the wards. "Careful, Harry," she says softly.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Taking a deep breath, Harry slowly walks across the woods. He has confidence in his cloak. Even if there is someone spying on him, he won't be seen. Harry carefully lifts the hem of the cloak when he passes a muddy path. There are still small sounds of the hem brushing the grass along the path.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Perhaps he is heard, thinks Harry. If that spy knows where he is, he or she might follow up, so that Harry will know who it has been. Harry turns around, trying to spot a leg, a figure that fails to hide itself, or some rustling sounds from walking, only to find no one. That <em>pair of eyes</em>...still attached to the back of his head.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Bloody hell. He thinks to himself. What the hell is this?</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Right in front of him is the busy muggle street. The afternoon sunshine spreads across the trees and the shops along both sides, the crowd loitering. Harry breathes deeply, half closes his eyes and takes a precious moment to relax. It has been ages since he talked to anyone other than Ron and Hermione, except in that riot at the Ministry, which couldn't really count as a pleasant experience.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He pulls the cloak tighter around him, moving cautiously. To his east, there is a bakery full of guests. A chilly breeze causes a shiver down his spine. Rubbing his nose, Harry looks down. His shadow somehow becomes darker. The winds grow stronger, and the coldness gets through the cloak, penetrating his skin like countless tiny thorns. Looking up, Harry finds the street suddenly falling into the dark, cold winter. Every beam of sunlight is gone. The muggles freeze, their faces as blank as ghosts.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Cold breathes have wrapped him up from head to feet. It seems that his blood is also frozen. Dark, foggy shadows are floating to his direction. All happiness is gone... A scream starts in his brain. The sickness of being <em>stared</em> has devoured him like a black hole. It is his father's cry, then his mother's...<em>Let him go! No</em>...He stumbles backwards dizzily, struggling to get rid of the control of that negative power. The large shadows of Dementors are so close, close enough to see their waving cloaks, to hear their ugly mouths breathing and the rustling sounds of their movement...</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">It occurs to Harry that the Invisibility Cloak won't fool the Dementors. He desperately pulls the wand out of his pocket, mind empty. ''Expecto patronum!"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">From the tip of his wand bursts a cloud of mist, which disappears in no time. The locket against his chest shakes a dead sound. Harry wracks his brain for happy memories. He can feel a Dementor touching his hand...Slimy and cold, he hates it.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"<em>Expecto patronum!</em>"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Still a helpless cloud of mist. The Dememtors didn't draw back. They come closer as one of them takes off its hood. <em>No...No! Never...Expecto patronum...expecto...</em>He wants to scream, but his throat is too dry, so he can only make a hoarse cry.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He doesn't need this, and they can't...No...Harry draws back. He bumps into a muggle and falls to the ground. The Dementor pounces on him, opening its mouth, a rotten black hole with disgusting smell</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry feels a power that can drain his soul. His vision blurry, all kinds of cold emotions are surrounding him. There is no light. He has realised that his soul is being fed on, and this is exactly an out-of-body moment. He is facing a mincer, a mincer that rips every piece of a rich soul out of its owner, every piece of happiness, until there are only negative feelings left.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry vaguely knows that once he falls into that black hole, he will disappear forever, so he starts to struggle. But he can hardly fight against the storm surrounding him. The wind howls. Gradually it starts to sound as sharp as the friction of numerous tin cans. Their shriek is cutting his soul into slices.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He is dying. Harry has never known better. His soul will be drained. He will be the food of Dementors, and he will disappear forever. There is no worse way to die, but he can't do anything about it. Hermione and Rom will find him on the street, maybe not a dead body yet, but not alive, either. There will be so many tears for him.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">How should they deal with his body?</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">It doesn't matter anymore. He will be dead then.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He is been drawing closer to the black hole. Large hands reach out for his limbs. Harry lets them. Perhaps they are trying to dig some happiness from him, like a burglar trying to dig out some treasure. But there is no happiness left in him, not anymore.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715"> </p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Something suddenly hit him. Its force drives him back to the winds. He struggles to look back, where floats a dark grey shadow, towed by the black hole the way Harry is. Harry can tell the shadow is trying to fly backwards, but barely moving under such power.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Give me a push," the shadow voices itself. It sounds somewhat familiar. Harry starts to pull back, too.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Who <em>are</em> you?" growls Harry, his voice echoing about.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Give me a push!" The shadow leans to him. Harry stretches his hand, but fails to touch it. It's not close enough.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Who are you?" he repeats.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">No response. Harry lets out a breath; then he is pulled back at the very moment.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"No." He says, "Why should I?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"What?" Anger swells in that voice, "Do as I say, Potter!"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"You want to take over my body. I know perfectly well," snaps Harry. "Why should I help you?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">The shadow is in his reach now. Harry grabs the leg of it, trying to get rid of the gravity of the black hole. It kicks violently, attempting to throw Harry off. But Harry grips tight, so they start to swirl in the storm.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Get off, Potter!" hisses the shadow. Harry remains silent, for he doesn't want to waste more strength. It's not easy to ''get off'' in a storm. What he grips seems way lighter than him, way more illusory as well. He feels like holding a half-full bag of rice in hand.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"If you want to live, don't move," says Harry. "The friction of two is stronger than one. I daresay once I let you go, you will be ripped into parts."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Not you to judge." The shadow turns around. Harry finally sees who it is, tightening his grip unconsciously.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">The eyes that stick to the back of his head, <em>staring</em> at him, black and icy.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry thinks he's going to throw up.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Bloody hell! Why <em>you</em>?" he roars. "I'm letting go, Voldemort!"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I dare you, Potter!" Now it's Voldemort who is gripping, while Harry twists and turns. They are rolling in the air.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He has seen this face before — in Dumbledore's memory, when Voldemort came to Hogwarts to apply for a position and got rejected. His features reveal that he used to be handsome, but it is as though they were burnt. The face looks oddly distorted.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry's arm is in the tight grip of Voldemort's long fingers. He can hardly believe so illusory a ghost has such power.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">This won't work. Harry thinks. As much as he wants to fight Voldemort, he can't risk causing both of them to disappear. Maybe he should take a chance, throwing Voldemort into that dark abyss so that the counterforce can help him escape. That's a perfect plan, though difficult to implement, considering how tight Voldemort grips.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Listen. We need a plan." Harry's voice hoarse, it's too difficult to talk here. "You don't want to be devoured by the Dementors, do you? We have the same aim now."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">The man lets out a ''humph''.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"First, you have to let go of me."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"In your dreams, Potter. I know what your trick is, " replies Voldemort immediately. Harry groans in pain due to the firm grip.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Well then. We'll fly back together. Don't waste your time here!" he yelled in anger.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">The man sneers, but there is no objection from him. The gravity grows stronger. Perhaps the Dementor has lost its patience, which is lethal to them. Harry struggles backwards for his life. He no longer feels cold. The will to live pulls him together again. He is ashamed of himself for thinking of giving up moments ago.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Voldemort grabs Harry by the hand, flying back. Harry finds him surprisingly lithe, though the weight of Harry makes him a little bulkier, but it also prevents him from being blown down by the wind.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Why can you..." he can't help asking. They have gradually left the storm zone and float evenly in the air.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"It's safe now," says Voldemort. Harry stares at his hand, wishing he could predict his next move. He secretly tenses.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"So..." The hand on his shoulder suddenly gives him a push. Harry falls forward. He <em>knew</em> it. Harry instantly flies back from the other side. Voldemort has already headed to the entrance. He flies much faster than Harry. Gritting his teeth, Harry bounces towards it.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">His whole brain feels the concussion. Harry is on all fours, gasping heavily. He looks up, the muggle street back in vision. The Dementors are still wandering about. His cloak is sliding down. Harry quickly pulls it up, and turns back to where he came.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715"> </p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Damn! What is this all about? Harry rubs his face violently. He has no idea why Voldemort would appear in his brain. He did sense his thoughts and look through his eyes before, but this time is <em>different</em>.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Is he possessed by Voldemort again? Harry feels like throwing up. Did Voldemort possess him to kill him? But given what happened just now, he seems in a dangerous condition himself, so Harry doesn't think he will take the risk.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">It has been <em>his</em> stare.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry feels numb. It reminds him of the fifth year. Back then, every time he looked at Dumbledore, an impulse to attack would emerge. It was like what he feels now, but Dumbledore told him that Voldemort would never attempt to possess him after that time.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Your soul is so complete and pure that it becomes lethal to him, Harry," said Dumbledore then. "He already knows what it costs to possess you."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">But Dumbledore had kept a lot of things from him, hadn't he? He never talked about his family, nor himself. Still, he cared about him, and he told him things he thought useful, hoping to help him live.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry slowly walks to their tent. Hermione and Ron are waiting inside. He has realised the moment he enters that he didn't buy the bread. He completely forgot about it.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Any food?" asks Ron.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"There were Dementors on the street. I couldn't produce a Patronus," says Harry.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"How come? You can make a brilliant Patronus!" Hermione is shocked. Harry reads disappointment in their eyes. He feels terrible.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">How was that his fault? He was nearly kissed -- they nearly lost him. Do they think he was willing to see how it went?</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"No idea," replies Harry finally.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"So we still haven't got any food, right?" Ron exclaims, "I am starving! All I’ve had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Then you go and fight your way through the dementors, then.“ Harry is stung by his words.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">“I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!”</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">“That’s convenient.”</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">“And what’s that supposed to — ?”</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">“Of course!” cries Hermione, startling both of them into silence and looking at her. “Harry, the locket! Are you still wearing it?” Harry looks down, the locket pressing at his skin. Hermione takes it off from him, which immediately relieves him greatly.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Better?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Much better!"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"You don't think you've been possessed, do you?" Ron frowns.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">That fight in his head...Harry wishes it had been a mere illusion.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I don't. I still remember everything we've done."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Anyway, we must go somewhere else. It would be unwise to stay where Dementors are around. " Hermione releases the protective spells. Holding hands, they apparate.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">At last they managed to obtain egg and bread on a farm. They sit in the tent, devouring dinner when the night falls. Hermione seems troubled. "It's not stealing, is it? Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Hermione, you worry too much!"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">A full stomach brings delight, while an empty one brings angst and arguments. Harry had learnt this when he was sleeping and starving in the cupboard. This has been the first night of laughter after a long time. He has stayed hopeful until he takes the night watch. The lights in the remote windows are gradually out. The night breeze lingers at his collar, sending a slight chill. Harry gasps and settles himself down in the grass.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He doesn't sense the stare anymore. It must have been the locket. Voldemort is able to manipulate people via his Horcruxes, just the way he did with that diary. They need to be more cautious.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry is about to return to the tent and warn his friends about this, especially when Hermione has the locket with her now. A sudden voice announces itself in his mind. He feels being stared again.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"You can't be more wrong, Potter."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He stops instantly, stiff.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"...Voldemort?"he thinks in his head, not making a sound. "Why are you still there?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"You should ask yourself, Potter. What have you done to me?" There is icy rage in his voice, as well as, surprisingly, some confusion.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Myself? What are you talking about?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I shouldn't have been here," says the man coldly. "Once I find out what you've done, Potter, you will know the consequences."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I said I had no idea. Damn it! Do you think you are <em>welcome</em> in my head?" Nausea strikes Harry. This is similar to talking with that diary, only far more dangerous, because he can't really toss his brain away. "If you do have a way to get out of my head, just do so, please."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">A couple of seconds have passed in silence before Voldemort suddenly speaks, "What's the time now?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Sorry?" Harry didn't get it.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"The <em>year</em>, Potter."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"...1998. You are messed up due to entering my head, aren't you?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"It's impossible," the man says firmly. He can hardly pretend to be calm. "Impossible. You are lying, Potter. You know how I hate it when people lie to me..."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"If you are in a dream, wake up then!" Harry shouts in his mind. His scar stings viciously, which should have got a moan out of him if Harry hadn't covered his mouth. "Anyone with a clear mind knows what time it is. If you don't, congratulations! I'm more than happy!"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I wish I was dreaming. Better than staying in a childish brain." Voldemort tries to contain himself.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I'm an adult, Voldemort," Harry talks back, "it's nothing though, compared to your pursuit of immortality."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Another few seconds of annoying silence. Harry didn't expect this. Something's wrong. He thought Voldemort was plotting behind all this, but he seemed even more confused than Harry.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry attempts to connect Voldemort's mind, but he gets caught in no time. His scar starts burning.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Don't you even try, Potter."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Actually, in most cases they come to me." Harry pants.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"What?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I mean that I don't want to know what you are thinking of, but it just comes through my scar. Get it?" Harry is almost over the edge. Voldemort should know this. Did he really lose his memories?</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Explain, Potter."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Enough. I am not obliged to explain that. You've lost your memories. But I won't let you off simply for this, even though you are in my brain."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Oh, so you are going to cut your brain out, then?" says Voldemort sarcastically, sneering.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"...I'll find another way. There must be a way to wipe you out while let me live."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Sadly, Potter, you are the one to be wiped out."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Then why don't you try? Try killing me at this moment. Surely you can do that." Harry is furious, "What? You are afraid?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Voldemort goes silent. Harry finds himself more and more used to this silence; it's soothing in some way.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"So...it's been sixteen years since then." Harry is yawning when Voldemort suddenly begins. "You've lived for sixteen years after that night."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Sorry, I don't feel so nostalgic right now," says Harry sincerely. "We may talk about how you lost your memories though."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"What happened after that?" Voldemort refuses to take the bait.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Sixteen years ago —"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I went where the prophecy located. Then —"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Do we have to talk about this?" Harry snaps. "About how you killed, how it pleased you. Do we<em> have</em> to?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"That's all I remember, brat," retorts Voldemort. "You were only one, and I killed you --"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Congratulations on killing your arch-enemy — an one-year-old boy. No, you didn't, 'cause I'm still alive till now." Harry says coldly, "You should give a toast to The Boy Who Lived!"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He screams the moment he finishes that sentence. The rage of Voldemort has gone beyond his expectation. Pain bursts, burning from his scar to his eyes. Harry takes off his glasses, panting with hands on his eyes. It doesn't make him better.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Harry, what's wrong?" asks Hermione anxiously, who just drew the curtains of the tent apart. "You spot anyone suspicious?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"No, er...It's just the scar." He gasps, pressing at it with his palm.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Okay then." She puts on a poker face, "You said you no longer sensed his thoughts."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">It's nothing," he shakes his head. "Really — nothing."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">After a couple of reminders, Hermione returns to the tent. Harry continues rubbing his forehead. It's getting better, but the scar still stings.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I was right," he mutters. "You have never succeeded. You can't really expect me to be kind to you."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"'Never succeeded'."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Of course not."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"You mean I've made other attempts?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry stops rubbing his forehead, irritated.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Right. Every year since I entered Hogwarts, you attempted to kill me. I can't believe you've forgotten that, Voldemort. I thought I couldn't hate you more." Harry finds it extremely hard not to swear, but the pain from his scar prevents him. "In my first year, you went to steal the Philosopher's Stone, and I stopped you. In the next year, your diary opened the Chamber of Secrets, and you were going to kill me. In year three, you had obtained a servant and you two conspired for your resurrection. You did resurrect, and attempted to kill me again — another failure. We had a fight in the Ministry in the fifth year. Last year you killed Dumbledore. You've forgotten all this?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"...I wasn't completely senseless," Voldemort sounds thoughtful. "Sometimes I knew a little, at least after your fourth year. But...it wasn't me."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Not you! Who else could it be?" Harry sneers.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Not this one, boy." The iciness in his voice returns.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry wants to retort when there is a sudden revelation. A headache follows.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"A Horcrux," he is out of breath. "You are inside me...God, this <em>can't</em> be happening...How did you..."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"Make it clear, Potter." Voldemort is out of patience. Harry's face is distorted.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"You should have killed me." After a few seconds, he lays his head on the knees, staring at his shoes.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"That's the plan all along, boy. But you haven't explained your words yet."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"I am totally fed up," murmurs Harry. "I'm fed up, Voldemort. I thought I only had to kill you. Now I have to commit suicide."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"And you were bluffing about finding a way."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"That was because I didn't know I was a Horcrux. I though it was some dark magic. But a Horcrux — I only know how to destroy one." Harry digs the clods on the ground, hard, mud going under his nails. "Your can only recall what happened sixteen years ago, right? Do you remember how you died when you tried to kill me?"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"<em>Shut up, </em>Potter."</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">"It must be lonely to be dead for sixteen years," he keeps going anyway. "But you <em>deserved</em> it. You even deserve another taste of it, for the sake of all your victims --"</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He didn't finish it before he started screaming. Harry has been writhing on the ground, bracing himself, until Hermione and Ron rush out of the tent and drag him back. His scream goes on with the deadly pain.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715"> </p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry can't continue his nightwatch, and Hermione takes his place. He lies in the bed, his quilt aside, and stares at the ceiling motionlessly. The pain in his scar has never been more acute, as if it's announcing its presence. He knows why now. This rage is not conveyed to him <em>via</em> that piece of soul inside, but <em>from</em> it.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He. Is. A. Horcrux. Of. Lord Voldemort.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">He senses the emotions of Voldemort only because he himself is a filthy part of that broken soul. A piece of soul was split from Voldemort's body and entered his at that man's failure, living with him for sixteen years. He has stayed with the murderer of his parents for <em>sixteen</em> years, knowing nothing.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Voldemort couldn't have plotted for this. There was no reason that he should use his enemy as a Horcrux. Harry hates dark magic all the time, whereas he is a part of the darkest one.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Ron begins snoring. Harry can't fall asleep. He wants to find a rope and strangle himself. Without the protection of its vessel, that piece of soul will die. He is so filthy, filthier than being possessed. He is a <em>Horcrux</em>.</p><p class="ql-long-8161715">Harry closes his eyes, forcing himself to sleep.</p><p> </p><p class="ql-long-8161715">TBC.</p><p> </p>
