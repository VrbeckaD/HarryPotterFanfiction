    <p>A young belladonna ran after her big brother Draco in the beautiful garden outside playing tag happily, when a voice called out to them</p><p>“Come on in darlings dinner will be served, go wash your hands and tidy yourselves up” her mother’s voice called out to both of them</p><p>Bella and Draco stopped running and looked at each other smiling before running off in the direction of the house, trying to be the first one to the table both giggling as they  ran but as they entered the house Bella seemed to trip, sending her sliding across the polished floor on her stomach a good few meters ending up by her father’s feet</p><p>“What do we have here” her father’s voice sounded in her ear causing her to look up at the man who seemed angry</p><p>“Get up this instance “</p><p>Bella whimpered slightly as she slowly got up looking down at the floor not meeting Lucius's angry gaze</p><p>“What did I tell you about tracking mud indoors”</p><p>“Not to do it” Bella whispered quietly</p><p>“What happens when you do “ her father’s voice seemed to lower an octave</p><p>“Punishment”</p><p>“Very good “</p><p>Just as her father was about to grab her arm to drag her off to the room where he punished her Draco popped up next to her</p><p>“Are you okay sissy?” Draco asked grabbing her hand squeezing it</p><p><br/> Bella could only nod because tears had formed in her eyes, she didn’t like her father because she always got punished for everything that went wrong even for her brothers mistakes but she always had to be strong so that her brother and mother would not receive any of her fathers anger and would not worry about her but right now all she wanted to do was scream at her father because she was so sick of it even though she was only 8 years old.</p><p>“Darlings what are you doing, dinner will get cold if you do not hurry ” her mother’s voice sounded through the room </p><p>That night after dinner her father had hit her over and over again away from prying eye’s and ears. That was the night she vowed to get stronger so she would not have to endure it much longer.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>That was 3 years ago and from there everyday she would wake up early and exercise to the point her little body would collapse. Sure it was brutal work for an 8-year-old but she was focused on not allowing her father to hit her anymore and if he did she would be somewhat strong enough to defend herself even in magic as she practised wandlessly.</p><p>By the time she was 10 she read almost all of the books in the library learning all she could about the magical world.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>She was 11 now and had learnt of her true heritage and of course, it was by mistake.</p><p>Bella was sitting in the study room reading a book on The Most Noble Houses when a house elf appeared before her.</p><p>“Miss, Master and Mistress wish to see you”</p><p>She looked over to the little elf giving it a smile</p><p>“Thank-you dobby please tell mother and father I will be there shortly “</p><p>“Right away miss” the little elf bowed his head before disappearing</p><p>Bella sighed running a hand through her dark jet black hair, pulling her glasses off and placing them on the desk beside the couch she sat on as she got up to go and meet her parents.</p><p>She entered the dining room looking around seeing her parents and her brother already there, she smiled at both her mother and brother before looking at her father void of any emotions </p><p>“ You called for me father” she said with a voice to match her stare</p><p>“You and your brother have been accepted into Hogwarts this year, you will be going with your brother and mother to purchase the things you need “</p><p>Looking over at Draco and her mother she could see that they both were excited but her father paid no attention to them</p><p>“Understood father”</p><p>“Dobby” Bella summoned one of their house elves</p><p>“Yes miss “</p><p>“Fetch my Mother’s and Brother’s robs do not worry about my own”</p><p>“Right away miss”</p><p>Bella stood as she watched her father walk out of the room and once he was gone she took a deep breath in and out</p><p>
  <strong>At Diagon Alley</strong>
</p><p>Bella stood in front of a small tea store in Diagon Alley with her mother and brother while their mother fussed over them</p><p>“Ma do you mind if I go to Gringott, I wish to speak to the goblins about their jobs and get to know the working of the area just in case I may want to take a job there one day” Bella said</p><p>“Not at all dear but be careful if you need me you know what to do “</p><p>“of course mother and Draco don’t cause to much trouble” Bella smiled at her brother before kissing him and her mother on the cheek</p><p>“You're the troublemaker Bella,” Draco said in return wiping his cheek free from saliva as he smiled</p><p>“ ah, of course, one of us has to be”</p><p>Bella smiled one last time at her family before making her way to the bank</p><p>She greeted a few of the goblins who worked there having met them before, as she approached the teller where Grip-hook was stationed. She had been there many times before with her mother and father but never on her own but each time she came by she made sure to smile and wave at the creatures, she never did have the pureblood society views on things as her family had and for one reason or another they had come to be fond of her</p><p>“Good evening grip-hook how has business been”</p><p>“Very well I suppose Youngling “</p><p>“That’s good and how is the ministry treating you all”</p><p>“Like they have always treated us really but I am sure you are here for something else”</p><p>“I am indeed I wish to access a certain vault I have the necessary items on my personal to indicate I am who I am but none of this is to be mentioned to anyone else, of course, there will be something for you as well to ensure your silence but if anything gets out I will ruin you and the bank”</p><p>She never did like making threats but she knew when it was needed and today was one of those day’s</p><p>“Very well which vault are you wishing to enter today”</p><p>Bella grabbed an envelope from her breast pocket placing it on the desk in front of the goblin</p><p>“Everything is there and explanations as well do not ask for more information”</p><p>Bella sighed as she remembered where she found the envelope</p><p>
  <em>Flashback</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She had been looking through the books in Malfoy library when a certain book caught her eye with a plain black leather covering which seemed old, she had taken it front its place and opened to read the contents of the book only to find an envelope</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She had opened it seeing a letter and an object which looked like a ring of sorts. She had gently placed the envelope on the desk getting the letter out and reading it</em>
</p><p>
  <em>To my beautiful baby girl</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I am writing this letter in case something happens to myself and if you have found this note then I am no longer here. You will find encased with this letter is an enchanted ring by my own making such a difficult piece of work, a small vial containing a single drop of my own blood and a key. I have placed such items along with this letter for a purpose, that purpose being when a time come in which you wish to claim what is rightfully yours these items will help. Place the drop of blood on the ring before you put the item on and after place a single drop of your own blood on it, if the ring accepts you as my own it will adjust to your finger size and the colour will change to whichever you desire however if it does not then prepare to take your final breaths.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I am sorry I could not be there for you darling but this ring is my last gift to you oh and the key is connected to the ring so it will know</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love your father</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tom Riddle</em>
</p><p>End flashback</p><p>Of course, she had not tested the ring having saving it for this moment but she was curious if the goblin would accept such thing</p><p>Letting grip-hook read over the letter and doing what he needed she looked around admiring how beautiful the bank looked from the inside, a few moments later she felt a tap on her head</p><p>“Excuse me I was caught up admiring the interior of the bank”</p><p>“You say that every time sometimes I wonder if you mean it but back to the matter at hand, while normally you will need the ministry approval of such matters we will make an exception for you if you would please “</p><p>Bella smiled at the goblin and held her hand out to the creature allowing him to place the single blood drop on the ring before placing the object on her finger noticing that it was twice the size of her finger before using his nail to draw blood from the same finger once he deemed there was enough of blood he slowly and carefully dropped it onto the ring allowing a few seconds to pass before the effects</p><p>Bella watched and the ring slowly shrunk to her size fitting her finger snuggly and comfortably before the colours flashed all kinds of colours before settling on a reddish black tint, she smiled down at the ring on her finger and admired it slightly it was beautiful</p><p>“Well it seems you have access to the vault I dear say that particular vault has not been touched in some time I advise taking your time, “ Grip-hook said somewhat smiling as he made his way from the desk handing the letter back and leading her to the carts</p><p>Bella made small talk with the goblin as they made their way to the middle vault. Upon entering the vault she to see many different things from money, books, jewellery and much more, she thought that it was more than what was in Malfoy vault. Spending around 10 minutes looking at the many things around the vault Bella decided to take a few books on dark magic and advanced spells placing it in her extended charmed pocket before grabbing a couple bag full of coins before exiting.</p><p>She turned to grip hook and handed him one large pouch full just galleons and another bag filled with knuts, sickles and galleons before grabbing out a</p><p>“Would you be able to invest the money in that bag towards properties, businesses and anything you deem fit to make a profit ,  watch over it for me and you may take 10 galleons from the first bag for your silence, the second bag is to be divided between the goblins that work here if there are any troubles please owl me directly, my family especially my father will not hear a single thing I do at Gringotts”</p><p>Grip-hook looked at Bella like she was somewhat crazy considering she was a Malfoy riddle girl, either family is known for evil but he knew her well enough that she was dead serious plus he could see she was kind at heart so he wasn’t complaining especially since money was involved</p><p>“I will see to it youngling”</p><p>Bella smiled at grip-hook looking back at the vault thinking for a moment</p><p>“What extra security can I put in place so it ensures my vault will not be touched “<br/> Griphook seemed to think a moment before turning to the door waving his hand over the door</p><p>“Besides what is in place already Wards would be a start perhaps even blood wards along with charms”</p><p>Bella nodded at the creature before turning to the cart sighing</p><p>“Frankly I don’t dabble in powerful ward’s yet that will have to wait a couple of years but for now I trust you will look after what’s mine each year that it stays save I will pay you and all goblins who work here naturally oh any and all purchases I made under the name of D.R.M will be taking from purchases under Belladonna Malfoy will be taken out of Malfoy vault”</p><p>“For a youngling, you sure have a decent head on your shoulders girl “</p><p>“I have to, after all, I am a Malfoy”</p><p>They did not say anything for the rest of Bella's time at Gringotts which wasn’t long before she went to purchase a few of her things</p><p>Having brought a couple things already Bella reached to the pocket watch in her pocket flipping it open running her thumb over the glass pouring a little bit of her magic into it waiting a few seconds before her mothers face appeared</p><p>“Hello darling are you finished “ her mother spoke</p><p>“Yes I have also taken the time to purchase some of my things I was wondering where you and Draco where so we could meet “</p><p>“I see well I hope you saved your wand and robes for me to buy love but if you look behind you you’ll find what you are looking for” her mother smiled before cutting the link off</p><p>Bella looked at the time noticing they had been shopping for around an hour sighing she spun around coming face to face with her brother’s finger against her forehead</p><p>“ Hey sis” Draco spoke smiling flicking Bella's forehead lightly</p><p>“Hello dear brother and mother“ she smiled back at Draco slapping his hand away from her face looking over his shoulder to see her mother smiling</p><p>“ shall we go now we are caught up “ her mother spoke</p><p>“Of course let’s go get the rest of our stuff,” she said hooking her arm around her brother’s walking with him</p>
