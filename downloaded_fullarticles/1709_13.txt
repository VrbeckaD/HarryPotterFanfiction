  <p><br/>
As fast she fled thro’ sun and shade,<br/>
The happy winds upon her played,<br/>
Blowing the ringlet from the braid:<br/>
She looked so lovely, as she swayed<br/>
The rein with dainty finger-tips,<br/>
A man had given all other bliss,<br/>
And all his worldly worth for this,<br/>
To waste his whole heart in one kiss<br/>
Upon her perfect lips.</p>

</center><em></em><hr/><p>The kitchen at the Burrow was for once blessedly, miraculously quiet, the only sounds the hushed rush of water from the sink mixing with soft humming as Molly Weasley waved her wand, washing the vegetables for dinner, and the gentle scratching of quill on parchment as Hermione frowned down at a stack of paperwork, chewing on her bottom lip in concentration. Ginny had a stack of plays in front of her that she was meant to be working through, but instead she simply let her eyes drift shut and take in the peacefulness she hadn’t known if she’d ever be able to enjoy. </p><p>Suddenly, her eyes jerked open at the roar of the Floo and the sound of loud, creative swearing coming from the living room in familiar voices. </p><p>Well, the peace had been good while it had lasted. </p><p>She rose and turned to where Ron and Harry were making their way into the kitchen, newly clad in the robes of graduates from the Auror program. They were supposed to be here to celebrate, but from the grim look on Harry’s face and the red bluster of Ron’s, it didn’t seem that celebrating was really in order. </p><p>“Go to Kingsley, tell him that you absolutely won’t do it. He’d change it for you, you know he would,” Ron was saying as the two rounded the corner into the small kitchen. </p><p>“No, I’m not going to asking for special favors,” Harry said stubbornly, though the set of his jaw made him look as if he were very much considering it. </p><p>“What’s going on?” Ginny asked, looking between her brother and her boyfriend. Her mum had left the potatoes to finish themselves and even Hermione had paused in her scribbling to look up at the boys. “You’ve both actually passed everything, right?” She made a quick sweep of their robes, which were, in fact, no longer the trainee robes. </p><p>“Yes, but we were—” Harry started, before Ron interrupted.</p><p>“Harry’s got stuck with <em>Malfoy</em> as his partner!” </p><p>“What?” Ginny exclaimed, echoed shortly by Hermione, who looked perplexed.</p><p>“But I thought the protocol is that you’d get partnered with someone more senior,” Hermione said, brow furrowed as she tried to take in this new piece of information. Trust Hermione to think first of protocol. </p><p>They’d all known that Draco Malfoy had joined the Auror program; it had been an uproar when Kingsley had given them all the heads up after he’d first been accepted. Malfoy, like Ron and Harry, hadn’t had any NEWTs, having spent what would have been his final year trapped in his home by Voldemort, but, after Harry’s testimony had kept him out of Azkaban, he’d told the Ministry he wanted to be an Auror. Kingsley said he’d interviewed the boy personally, had believed he truly wanted to atone for the mistakes he’d made in his past, and had administered the initial assessments, which Malfoy had passed with flying colors. None of the former Gryffindors were exactly <em>thrilled</em> with Malfoy’s new position, but Ron and Harry had been certain that he’d drop out at some point, and, when it had become obvious that that wasn’t going to happen, had just been happy that he’d mainly kept to himself. Two years later, obviously that hadn’t worked out exactly as they’d planned.</p><p>“Well, it’s supposed to work that way,” Harry said, slumping down into a chair and sounding resigned, “except with all the vacancies on the force because of the war, and all of the new recruits, there weren’t enough. So the two trainees with the best scores on our final assessment got paired together.” When the room was silent, he gave them all a scowl. “Malfoy and me, obviously.” </p><p>“Ron’s right, you know,” Ginny said, scooting her chair closing to Harry’s and putting a comforting hand on his arm. “You could always go to Kingsley and ask for a switch. He’d completely understand.” </p><p>Harry shook his head. “No, no. I already said, I don’t want any special treatment just because I’m me.” Ginny bit her tongue, refraining from pointing out the fact that Harry and Ron hadn’t a single NEWT between them, and hadn’t been forced to take the preliminary assessments either before they’d joined the program, which in and of itself seemed like quite a lot of special treatment.  “Besides, if Malfoy’s going to be an Auror, it might as well be me who keeps an eye on him and makes sure he’s not up to no good.” </p><p>Ron grunted in approbation, admitting that Harry had a point there about the ferrety git, and the group was interrupted by the twin sounds of her mum’s kitchen timer dinging and Mr. Weasley’s voice ringing out over the rush of the Floo. </p><p>“Well, dears, at least we still have cake,” her mum said, pulling out the large chocolate cake she’d made in celebration and proffering it to the group with a desperate smile.</p>
