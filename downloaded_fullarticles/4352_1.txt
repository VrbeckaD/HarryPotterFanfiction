          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry knows something is wrong the moment he opens his eyes. A silence is settling over the dorm room, creeping up Harry's spine like a bad feeling. There's a vacuum where there should be the shouts of half a dozen rowdy teenagers throwing various pieces of homework at each other to copy. It doesn't <em>really</em> feel like Hogwarts without Harry being woken up by a sharp jab in the hips and a whisper of, "Oi, did you do Flitwick's essay? It's due today and I can't be arsed doing it - can I borrow yours?" Moving his pillow slightly so he can read the time on his alarm clock, he has to stop himself from falling out of his bed in shock. Ten minutes into first period and he's still in his pyjamas. </p><p></p><div>
  <p>He shuffles into the classroom head bowed to avoid McGonagall's stare. He's a full half an hour late, underwear on the wrong way round, hair uncombed and messy. He sneaks a quick glance upwards, expecting the room's eyes to fall upon him. However, the class seems to be bubbling with life, the students much too giddy and excitable to pay attention to him. It's a nice change. So nice that he doesn't feel irritated when McGonagall orders him to write five pages on the disadvantages of using troll's hair to aid transfiguration spells for his tardiness. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry slips into his regular seat, knees knocking against Ron's.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Has Snape resigned? Haven't seen a class like this the Muggle Studies teacher and the Arithmancy teacher were caught together in that broom closet." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Ron grins at him toothily, "Even better mate."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>In return, Hermione shoots Ron a fierce glare, "Although he may be Harry's rival, the fact remains that this... <em>incident</em> is an abhorrent invasion of said person's privacy and completely defies any ethics I hold. I can't help but feel sorry for him, actually, that it was found is not his fault, is it?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"But Malfoy's a tosser!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hang on," interjects Harry, baffled and lost by this thread of conversation, "<em>Malfoy?</em>" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hermione sighs, opening her copy of 'A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration' and shaking it until a small piece of paper falls out. Harry picks it up, realising that it was an old muggle polaroid and <em>oh- </em>that's clearly two boys snogging. One of the boys takes up most of the photo. Harry catalogues the bottle of alcohol gripped tightly in his palm, the light capturing flashes of emerald on his robes, illuminating his silky blonde hair and- <em>Draco.</em> He blinks back his surprise before moving to Malfoy's partner. He's mostly out of frame, features masked in the dull light. The only thing that stands out is the scarf: thick, a pale lavender with big white stars. There's something familiar about it, something that tugs at the very corners of his mind.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Fuck," he whispers, only faintly aware he's said it out loud and not, as he intended, in his head.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What? Harry? Do you recognise the other person?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No," Harry lies, "Just, ermm, Malfoy being gay, it's a bit... unexpected, is all."</p>
</div><div>
  <p><em>It was </em>definitely <em>not because Harry knew who owned that lavender scarf. That if Harry went to his room right now, retrieved his trunk and dug to the very bottom of it he would find that exact scarf. The scarf he never wore because it had been one of the rare things that the Dursleys had given him. The scarf he'd thrown on when Gryffindor has lost last week and they'd headed to Hogsmeade to get stupidly drunk with Dean and Seamus. When his friends were replaced by Draco Malfoy, unusually docile as a result of all the whisky. Yes, that night.</em></p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <em>*<br/></em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He's sipping a pint of God knows what (Seamus had passed it to him not long ago, and Harry accepted it.) Having just assured Dean and Seamus that he'd be alright on his own for the rest of the night, he scans the pub, hoping to find someone to drink away his problems with. The only face he recognizes is Malfoy, and Harry chuckles into his glass. Thoughts of other boy had been occupying his mind for <em>very </em>different reasons. Tonight he feels bold enough to act on those. He drinks the rest of the liquid in three straight gulps, stumbling over to Malfoy's table. He flings his body where he thinks the seat next to Malfoy's body is and misses, half landing on Malfoy's lap. An elbow to his hip fixes his mistake, but the booth is too small for their thighs not to touch.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Not tonight, Potter," Draco snarls. Well, it's not a full, typical-Malfoy snarl, there's a sadness and an exhaustion to it that makes a bit of Harry's heart suddenly ache.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Look Draco, I'm probably s'posed to stay away from you because we're 'enemies' or whatever but I was over there and I saw you and you looked really fucking gorgeous, you did and now I'm here and your shirt's undone and that's even <em>worse.</em>"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>It's not easy to make the great Draco Malfoy stutter, but somehow Harry manages it. "Potter, are you taking the piss?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry brings his finger to Draco's lips, and giggles an intoxicated, "shh." Harry catches the tension in Draco's shoulders disappear, almost relaxing himself under Harry's touch. His hips turn, facing Harry with a strangely compliant gaze. Before he can change his mind, Harry captures Draco's lips in a kiss. There's no finesse to it: he's sloppy and clumsy and the mix of alcohol on their tongues isn't the most attractive flavour. It doesn't seem to matter to Draco, who's kissing back like his life depends on it, like he's staking everything on this moment of intimacy, and maybe he is. Everything - his nerves, his supposed hatred of Draco, the pressure he carries, the fact they're in public - falls from Harry. He cares that Draco is here and Draco is warm and Draco is <em>his. </em>He keeps kissing Harry like he's trying to prove something, eliciting small groans every few seconds, hands mapping the expanse of skin on Harry's back. The kiss is sweet and slow and <em>real</em> an-</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Both of them quickly pull away when they here the sound of a camera click. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>A first year Ravenclaw student stands at the edge of the table, furiously shaking the polaroid that had just come out of his camera. Immediately, Draco rushes up, raising a fist in fury, going to punch him until Harry intervenes. </p>
  <p>"Malfoy," he warns.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco huffs at the use of his surname. Proof that this was a one time thing, just Potter getting some of his repressed feelings out. Nothing more.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Once Harry had retrieved the photo of them kissing and put it safely in his pocket, Draco runs. Runs to avoid the conversation that would have ensued. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>*</p>
</div><div>
  <p>It takes Harry a few days to come to terms with his face in the polaroid. He's still reluctant to tell Hermione and Ron, not prepared for Ron's anger and Hermione's pity. However, coming clean to Draco is another thing. Whether Draco remembers or not, Harry's got a lot of explaining to do.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>It's almost midnight, most pupils now in a deep sleep. Except Harry, of course, who was under his bedsheets studying the other exception to this statement - Draco Malfoy - on the Marauder's Map. His fellow classmate was pacing the floor of the Astronomy Tower. He pushes down his worries - rejection, hatred - knowing he'll never get a better chance to talk to the other boy. He sneaks out, invisibility cloak in tow. The march up to the tower is lonely and uneventful but he ploughs on, ignoring the anxieties that seem to grow louder with each step he takes.</p>
  <p>When Draco catches sight of Harry, he swears. He swears and swears and swears and Harry thinks of kissing him against just to shut him up. He catches something Draco says, something about Harry not understanding any of this, and Harry doubts that Draco even knows it's him. He still doesn't feel ready to come clean just yet, instead asking who the boy in the picture is.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I was so drunk I didn’t even remember it until <em>this</em>,” Draco digs in his robes to retrieve multiple copies of the picture in question, throwing them to the floor, “surfaced. How am I supposed to know if he's the one that spread this? I don’t even know who he is.”</p>
  <p>Harry schools his face into a neutral expression, curling his fingers into a fist to stop himself from pulling Draco into a hug. His takes as big of a breath as he can muster.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Draco..."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco wonders why the use of his first name sounds so familiar and so palatable coming from Harry's mouth.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'm so sorry and I really have to tell yo-"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No!" Draco hissed, "Stop trying to understand me, to pity me. It's pathetic, Potter."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry takes a faltering step to Draco, hand inches away from the other boy's, forcing himself to make eye contact with him, "It could just as easily have been my name dragged through the dirt."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I-", the words clog in Draco's throat, eyes widening with shock. Harry forces himself to keep talking with the knowledge that he'll never again work up the courage to get this out in the open.</p>
  <p>“You see, one night I found myself alone in the Hog's Head.”</p>
  <p>Draco refused to make eye contact with Harry. He carries on, pushing, anyway.</p>
  <p>“I had rather too much to drink, you know how it is?”</p>
  <p>All Draco can do in nod, numbness spreading through him. </p>
  <p>“And somehow I found the courage to flirt with my crush - someone I'd liked for a while now. Someone who,” he swallows, trying to remember just how Draco had kissed him back, “I was nearly a hundred percent sure hated my guts.”</p>
  <p>His heart was hammering now, willing Draco to say something, anything. Or, better still, to say nothing and to lean in to kiss him, like the incident had never happened. Draco's breath was ragged, matching his own, and the seconds seemed to stretch on endlessly.</p>
  <p>“And then we were rudely interrupted,” Harry whispers suddenly. “I'm- I'm sorry, that nosey little Ravenclaw. I could have sworn I took the photo from him but I was too drunk to remember. I had no clue that we had shared that night until I realised the scarf was mine."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Suddenly, Draco's fear and anxiety turns into pure anger. Tears forming in the corner of his eyes he screams, "It was you! It was your fault! You've ruined my life, do you know how awful it is - people staring at you in the halls and whispering to each other? Knowing that you've brought shame upon your entire family?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Draco cannot control the flow of tears anymore, letting his anger by hitting Harry in the chest. Not hard enough to hurt him, but even if they were Harry doubts he could feel it -he can't feel much, just self-hatred for how ignorant he was and how much he wished it could've been him - the realisation that Draco had so much more to lose. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I hate you, I hate this! I hate all of this!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Something changes. Draco begins to fist his hands into Harry's shirt, sobbing into Harry's neck. It takes a moment for Harry to respond, overcome with shock. When he does, he begins to run his hands through Draco's hair, whispering words of comfort. They spend a good deal of time this way, until Draco finally lifts his head. He stares at Harry with big, doe eyes and Harry can't help wiping the tears on his cheek with his thumb. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>When Draco kisses him, it's just as Harry remembers. Just as intoxicating, but completely different. This time it's slow, comforting. There's no expectation, content to explore each other's mouths because they know they have all the time in the world. Harry's never felt warmth like this before. This is what liquid gold must taste like, he thinks. This is it.</p>
  <p>"Don't leave me, Harry," Draco says, soft and meek against Harry's jaw. </p>
  <p>Harry rests his forehead against Draco's, breaths mingling. </p>
  <p>"You'll never be alone again," he whispers, threading their hands together, "I promise."</p>
