    <p><em>There</em>, Draco thought triumphantly as he spotted his target. There, all alone at the farthest, shabbiest table near the Herbology section, Potter sat with his face determinedly buried in a thick and dusty old book, looking quite sullen and displeased.<br/> <br/> <em>Interesting</em>, was the next thought that went through Draco's head as he watched his past rival. What on earth could make Harry Potter, the entire school's darling and oh-so-admired saviour look so sour?</p><p>A sly smirk slowly spread over Draco's lips and one delicate eyebrow rose as he caught the opportunity, deciding in a split second to have some fun with the Wizarding World number one hero. After all, ever since Potter and himself had realized they would be sharing a dorm during their eighth year, the two had decided on a tentative truce. A truce that since then had turned into a bloodied, ruthless prank war, into an odd kind of friendship, and honestly, who could blame Draco for seeing a sulky Potter and taking the chance to tease?<br/> <br/> And so, certain in his logic and justifications, Draco schooled his delighted expression into a teasing smirk, and slowly sauntered towards the table, stopping a few steps away from the seat Potter was occupying as he leaned his hip against the dark, worn wood, crossing his arms while he waited for Potter to notice him.<br/> <br/> It took longer than Draco had hoped, although the subtle tightening of Potter's shoulders made him suspect the shorter boy had noticed, and was simply attempting to ignore him. <em>Too bad for him,</em> Draco sneered to himself. <em>I'm going to stand right here all day if necessary.</em><br/> <br/> His patience soon proved worthwhile as eventually, Potter made a small noise of annoyance and put his book down with a dull thump before two annoyed green eyes slowly rose to meet his own, watching him warily and narrowing in suspicion.<br/> <br/> "What do you want, Malfoy?" Potter was obviously trying for that usual mockingly harsh tone he had grown fond of using against Draco in their daily banters, but all that came out was a quiet, bitter murmur. Draco's eyebrow rose higher, eyes glinting in interest.<br/> <br/> "I just came to find out why our oh-so-wonderful hero is sitting here in this dusty library all by himself, sulking." He drawled lightly, eyes gleaming as he secretly delighted in the scowl that scrunched up Potter's face in response to his taunts. "Where are all of your friends, Potter? Are they the reason you're here, <em>sulking</em>?"<br/> <br/> Potter's sour expression stayed pinched for a few more short seconds, before the scowl suddenly turned alarmingly blank and clipped words tumbled from his mouth, as if out of his control. "My friends were in the common room when I left. Yes, they are."<br/> <br/> Draco let out a high, delighted laugh. "<em>Yes</em>?" He asked, obviously enjoying himself. "Yes, are you sulking, Potter? <em>Sulking?</em>"<br/> <br/> Harry gritted his teeth.<br/> <br/> "Yes." He forced out.<br/> <br/> "And why would that be, may I ask?" Draco said, a smirk dancing over the corner of his mouth. Harry seemed to struggle for a moment, as if fighting not to talk to him, but then-<br/> <br/> "I didn't want to be around people."<br/> <br/> Draco's smirk faltered. Mighty, famous Potter, not wanting to be around people? Not wanting to be surrounded by their admiring, vacant eyes? And what was it with that forced manner in which he had answered? It didn't seem like him. For some unfathomable reason, he obviously didn't want to say those things that he did, or give in to Draco's teasing or the easy banter than had become their routine. Why wasn't he mocking him back?</p><p>Odd.<br/> <br/> "You didn't... why?" Draco asked the first thing he could think of, his tone on the verge of demanding. Something didn't add up, and Draco didn't like not knowing things. Especially things that had to do with Potter.<br/> <br/> "Th-they were taking advantage of me." Potter blurted out, his face twisting as if saying those words caused him pain.<br/> <br/> Draco paused, his mouth opening around a soundless word. <em>Taking advantage? </em>What the hell did that even mean? Draco must have misheard. Or misunderstood. And yet, watching potter sit there, looking utterly miserable and lonely, made something uncomfortable sit heavily inside Draco's stomach. A sort of niggling feeling that he recognized as guilt and - Merlin forbid - <em>sympathy</em>, started twisting inside his guts. Slowly, not entirely sure what he was doing or why, he asked, "Do you want to talk about it?"<br/> <br/> "N-N-Ye-" Potter struggled. "I- I don't know." He eventually whispered, biting his lower lip, as if surprised himself by his answer.<br/> <br/> Draco hesitated. "If you say that you'd rather I leave you alone, I would, but..."<br/> <br/> Potter opened his mouth for a moment, then closed it again, dropping his eyes back to his dusty book. <em>Potions and Poisons - How to Counter and how to Conquer,</em> Draco noticed briefly.<br/> <br/> "...Stay." Was the quiet whisper.<br/> <br/> So Draco did.</p>
