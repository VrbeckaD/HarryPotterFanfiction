    <p>Flagstone, despite its pillowy appearance, is not soft. Few such stones truly could be, no matter their appearance, though sandstone did sometimes give off an odd, welcoming aura. It had frequently come to the attention of many within the esteemed, ever shifting walls of Hogwarts that stone was, regrettably, rather unyielding.</p><p>Well, unless someone cast the keymore spell. Odd how such a strange combination of words would combine to turn any surface into a sucking, grasping entity that could swallow one whole. Thankfully, the spell had fallen out of favor long before the Weasley twins had begun to haunt the hallways. The last group to really employ it had been the Prewett clan back when the Knights of Walpurgis still existed.</p><p>A great many things had changed since then. For one, the Knights no longer existed. Well, not in that form, at least. Perhaps something of their original intent remained, ensconced as it was so firmly in the statutes of Roger de Moulins. The Moulin line had long held their pride at retaining their nobility and purity, though the Malfoy line, an offshoot founded in the early fourteenth century, was the only one to have been recorded to have settled within the British Isles. Perhaps that was why the Malfoys had so long been keen on their apothecary - it tied them back to the family business, no matter how many broken bodies they and theirs might have caused to require their services.</p><p>Yet many of the old and Olde were coming through again, a fact which tended to worry Albus Dumbledore greatly. Much of the world was changing, had changed, and the wizarding world retained its staunch adherence to mores that did naught to advance the larger wizarding world. Perhaps that was another sign of the Moulin influence within the Most Noble and Ancient House of Malfoy. They had, after all, been one of the last to adhere to the Secrecy Statute, keen on continuing to fleece the Muggles for every farthing they could. Little enough could be said of how much this benefited the other families - The Most Noble and Ancient House of Black had begun a decline around the time their heir presumptive turned out to be a squib. Turned out to make somewhat of a splash in the Muggle world, so it was told, unless there had been a different Beau Brummel. Perhaps that was what had triggered the fixation by members such as Walburga on vocalizing the status and might of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black.</p><p>Individual members had done much to raise the stature of the House - Phineas had comported himself well during his tenure as Headmaster, and naturally, no one could fault the efforts of the current Scion of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black.</p><p>It was her efforts that had brought them to this impasse in the first place.</p><p>Albus Dumblebore leaned back in his chair, his spectacles resting low on his nose. Across from him stood three sixth years, each of them notable in their own way. Though lacking in tact or any form of forethought, the young Ron Weasley was a rather masterful strategist. It rarely offered a proper chance to shine, as the boy was far too fixated on the needs of the flesh and the distractions of youth. Beside him, The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter, shoved his glasses up his nose yet again, smudging a bit of ink from his hand onto his nose. Dumbledore mourned his plans as he fixated his gaze upon the boy, allowing himself a moment of sadness that his lamb would not be brought to slaughter.</p><p>No, instead it would be the unassuming and much overlooked who would step forward on this day, for between the two boys, standing with quiet patience and a calm gaze, was the Muggleborn top of the class student, Hermione Granger. The likes of her marks would not have been out of line in past years, before he had slowly altered the standards. Many of the wizards who came out of Hogwarts now would never see the likes of the glory of their ancestors, for that was not what would be needed by the Ministry. No, the bulk of students would be as nameless, faceless cogs in the machinery to make wizarding Britain remain the powerhouse of international wizarding that it was. Most wizards.</p><p>Not these three. Ron, for his part, cared nothing for what they taught, and Harry? While giving some effort, the boy was hampered by the lacking knowledge which Dumbledore had withheld from him. It would be better for the boy to meet his destiny unencumbered by the details of his ancestry and House. He knew his control was slipping - his term as Supreme Mugwump had been unceremoniously lifted from him, and his role as Chief Warlock was similarly about to be lifted if the rumbling within the Ministry were to hold true. It would take more than a few influencing spells to get his way.</p><p>It had been a boon, then, for him to be approached by the ancient and doddering house elf Kreacher during a stopover in Grimmauld Place between Order of the Phoenix meetings. Sneering and barely deigning to spit out the necessary words, Kreacher had extended to Dumbledore a request for a parley from a most unexpected source.</p><p>Bellatrix Black, Scion of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black, had returned, and she wanted a boon. A favor, of sorts, hearkening back to the days of their ancestors when knights were more than musicians and actors. Whilst he had purview over the task, it was decidedly one which he could not, in good conscience, explicitly ask.</p><p>Instead, he had faffed about over the task for days, knowing he would do as requested. Bellatrix had given him a strict deadline, after all, and the benefits would be likened to his youthful exploits, should any actually bother to remember them. So it had been, then, that he had called the young Miss Granger to his office and somehow, managed to pull a blinder. She'd hesitated, as any should when presented with a situation as shambles as it sounded. Still, she'd left his office thoughtful, obviously drinking in his words of promised glory and renown for single handedly ending the war.</p><p>Naturally, he knew no such thing could happen. Not with the boy's prophecy still hanging about, not that he could bloody well remember the wording.</p><p>He'd sold a bill of goods and now, Bellatrix Black was due to collect.</p>
