<p>Private Conversation</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you doing here, Pansy?” Draco, eyes narrowed, loomed over her. </p>
<p>Parkinson, meanwhile, didn’t appear cowed in the least. “I’m checking in on my best friend since I haven’t heard from him in ages and since I heard about him being on a forced time off from his job!” </p>
<p>“Since when do you—?”</p>
<p>Harry cleared his throat loudly, interrupting. “Maybe you should continue this conversation in private?” he suggested. </p>
<p>A hurt look crossed Draco’s face. “You’re leaving?” </p>
<p>“No.” Harry clasped his arm. “I’m going into the other room to give you some space.” </p>
<p>“Oh.” Draco exhaled. “Okay.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Even in the bedroom, Harry could still hear Parkinson and Draco yelling. Sighing, he tried to tune them out, picking up a random magazine from Draco’s bedside table to skim. </p>
<p>It turned out to be a sex mag, and as Harry skimmed, he found himself gaping at some of the positions the men managed to twist themselves into. Some looked like they would hurt. A lot. </p>
<p>Absorbed in the mag, Harry wasn’t aware when Draco came in until arms embraced him from behind. </p>
<p>“What are—? Oh. Found my wank mag, have you?” Draco nibbled Harry’s ear. “See anything you like?” </p>
