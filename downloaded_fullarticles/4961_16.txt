    <p>Bang!</p>
<p>Sluuuurp.</p>
<p>Pop.</p>
<p>Gasp!</p>
<p>Reaching his hand to the right, a man grasps hold of a polymer handle, and brings his arm back up in front of him, pointing at the door. A head of brown hair raises itself from his naked lap, revealing itself streaked with tears and mascara. His left hand shoots up, and drags her head back down.</p>
<p>Slurp.</p>
<p>Gag.</p>
<p>Throwing his head back, the man moans, shudders, and his eyes roll back ever so slightly. He releases the head after a few more seconds, and the woman falls to the ground, crying and choking. His arm never wavered from the door. The man turns to focus solely on the door, the woman now of no consequence as she crawls slowly towards the bed. The heavy clatter of footfalls resounds outside the door, as stairs are climbed.</p>
<p>Crash!</p>
<p>The door comes flying off its hinges, sailing neatly in front of the man. With two quick pulls of his finger, a loud report issues twice from the man’s hand, large holes appearing in the first man to come through the door. Another quick pull, and the man who hastily flicked his wrist to erect a glowing blue shield found himself with a hole neatly between the eyeholes of his silver mask.</p>
<p>Three red streaks follow the second man, and rend a great hole in the floor under the bed. A great shower of red liquid sprays the room. Two more shots sees the man that fired them dead on the ground, blood pooling from under his chest.</p>
<p>“Well, it seems that this one is over,” the man says.</p>
<p>Raising the gun in his hand, he bent his elbow, a large, black hole appearing before his eye. He pulls the trigger, and the sixth and final shot blows his brain through the back of his skull.</p>
<p>Three more men rush into the room, sticks protruding from their hands and pointing around the room. When they see the man dead, they take off their silver skull masks.</p>
<p>The man on the right, the tallest coincidentally, pulls a mirror from his pocket. He raises it to his face, and taps it with his stick.</p>
<p>“Mercurius is dead,” he speaks into the mirror.</p>
<p>A hissing laugh issues forth from the mirror.</p>
