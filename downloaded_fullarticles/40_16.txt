    <p>Dumbledore and I were sitting in the den of our safe house. He was stroking his beard while sipping his tea, my tea had gotten cold while I waited for Voldemort to make his next move. The sun had set an hour and a half ago, the sky was dark, too dark to see the horizon. Dumbledore had set his cup down. There was a beat.<br/>
“What does it say?” he asked, voice gruff and weary from the lack of sleep. We’ve been waiting three long days for a sign. He won’t allow me to sleep, even though he knows my dreams are the closest thing I have to the spirits. My dreams hold the key to my seeing. I’m exhausted and could use a great nap. I’ve been thinking about lying to him for the sweetness of slumber. I sigh and take his cup. It’s filled with the same tea leaves as always: four lines, that start off thick and get thinner. Two of the lines come together at the tip, the other two make a “y” that is backwards. There is also a medium-sized, filled in circle. The circle is about the diameter of a small straw.<br/>
“It says that you have bad news again. He hasn’t made any decisions. I cannot see this future. It’s been three days. That means only one thing: it involves me,” to make a point I took my moon crystal and moved toward the moonlight that flowed through the open window. I took a whiff of the light breeze that graced my face as I took a seat by the window, I couldn’t help the smile on my face at the smell of the perfume in the air. I chuckled softly as I stared into my crystal. Nothing but the deep abscesses of the crystal faced me. I waited, rubbing my hand over the ball a few times to clear anything that could be covering it up. “I’m sorry Dumbledore, I’m not seeing anything. If I could just see into my own--”<br/>
“No,” his voice boomed the single word. “You cannot see your own future. Your mother wouldn’t allow it and neither will I,” he stared at me before getting up, ”You are free to leave. Go get some rest. Ask the spirits, if they know anything.”<br/>
I got up to leave, taking my spell book with me and retiring to my room. I read a few pages before finally allowing myself to sleep. Sadly, it was another dreamless night. It had to have something to do with me. I need to have access to my future.</p>
