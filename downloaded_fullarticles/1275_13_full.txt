  <b>CHAPTER ONE: Late 2010</b>
</p><p>Draco Malfoy is heading home, incredibly intoxicated.  He’s standing, more like swaying, on the edge of the curb attempting to hail a cab, cigarette hanging out of his mouth, the too big ash clinging on despite the strong wind.  His coworkers are laughing beside him at something that had happened earlier, talking about another bar or getting some falafel from the halal cart on the corner.</p><p>“Bloody prats, you’re pissed out of your minds, it’s 2:30 in the morning.” Draco slurs, stumbling forward off the curb as he unsteadily steps one foot onto the road. He turns his hand still outstretched, facing his coworkers Joe and Nicole. A yellow cab pulls up and he calls out to them as he opens the door, “Go home, prats!” He throws his half smoked cigarette in the street.</p><p>“You already called us that, ya ponce!” Joe calls out, effecting Draco’s posh accent for the last word which dissolves Nicole into another laughing fit. Draco flips him two fingers, then a slight wave before settling down into the yellow.</p><p>“Greenwood and Sherman, please.” Draco states calmly as he pulls out his iPhone. He looks down at the picture on the lock screen, and pauses before unlocking his phone. It’s a picture of Harry leaning back on the couch with his head resting against their cat, Scorpius.</p><p>Draco and Harry have been together for three years, two of those they have been living together here in New York City.  Draco has been in New York for ten years in total, having moved here right after his two year probation period from his trial.  He could not wait to get a new start to his life. A start that would mean no one knowing of his past doings, a fresh start in a new city, where blood purity in the magic community was, hopefully, far from people's minds.  </p><p>He had fallen out of contact with everyone except Blaise and Pansy after the war.  Blaise stayed in England, his mother had kept their position neutral in the war. She found that it was easier to pull new young lovers by remaining inactive and aloof politically. Blaise was continuing the family ‘business’ by remaining a high society party boy. Pansy had went back to one of her family estates in Tokyo, after all there wasn’t much for Pansy in England. Her mother passed away from incurable magical cancer that plagued some pureblood lines, leaving her father alone for the first time since their arranged marriage at 18. It was public knowledge that Pansy had wanted to offer Harry to Voldemort and that hadn't went well for her family. Even after Harry accepted her public apology, it didn't mean the British magical community did.</p><p>Draco was tempted to press his face against the cold glass of the cab window, but he rather not smear his forehead against who knows who else's that’d been there before.  He thinks about him and Harry, how they had gotten here at this weird cross roads in their relationship.</p><p>Harry had moved across the ocean to be with him after only dating less than a year, it was an impulsive and entirely Gryffindor thing to do. They had reconnected at the 5 year war reunion at Hogwarts. Then kept in moderate touch for a couple years, texting each other drunkenly, the other person sober or sleeping in Harry’s case most often.  Then Harry had come to New York for a charity event, and asked Draco to suggest some places for lunch and dinner. Draco had one upped him, telling the other man that he was going to spend his Saturday with him, what else had he to do?</p><p>They had brunched in Chelsea Market, walked the recently opened section of the High Line like tourists, well Draco supposed Harry was one at the time.  The cab veers off the parkway, stopping at a light a couple blocks from their apartment. He pulls out his keys and credit card in anticipation, sitting up a bit higher in the seat, no longer touching his back to it.  </p><p>Harry had of course insisted on paying for almost all of it, the dinner at the Red Cat, the drinks at GYM Sportsbar, drinks at Stonewall in the early morning hours, and then the steamy cab ride to Harry’s hotel in Tribeca.   </p><p>They had the most drunken, erotic, shower sex turned pressed-against-the-hotel-window sex Draco has ever had.  Draco still vividly remembers his skin flush against the chill glass walls of the shower stall, while getting his arsehole licked open by Harry’s eager tongue. He had felt raw from Harry’s rough stubble rubbing against his arse for a week afterwards.</p><p>They had then started a bit of a relationship, with early morning phone calls for Draco. Harry coming to New York every so often to reenact their sexy calls in person. It had been fabulous, waking up every morning feeling like the best of your music was specifically for you.  Draco can fondly remember walking down the street in Tribeca, looking up at the tall building, headphones blasting such sappy, happy indie music he’d never admit to, feeling as if he was the most in love lucky bastard in the world.</p><p>Then Harry had moved in and there was a time when he was looking for a job that he had played house husband, making food for Draco to take to work. Draco would wake up to his arse being eaten out, and they’d fuck before work. He’d come home to Potter cooking dinner and dancing goofily to some muggle punk band on the wireless. Then maybe he’d fuck Harry into the uneven plaster walls in the hallway.</p><p>Draco swipes his card, “Have a good night, thanks!” He calls to the cabbie as he steps out onto the frosty sidewalk, he shoves his hands into his jacket fishing out his keys. He passes by his bodega and contemplates going in for a tall bottle of water and stale bagel, but resists, wrapping his coat around him more firmly.</p><p>Harry was now in a bit of a funk, he’d gotten a job being a dog groomer and hated it. Draco had told him time and time again to switch jobs to something else, go back to school, do anything.  It wasn’t like either of them needed the money, but ever the stubborn Gryffindor, Harry persisted, complaining as he’d get home late, complaining he had to work all weekends, complaining some dog had peed all over him again.</p><p>Draco keys into their apartment, a black cat is immediately at his ankles, rubbing against him and purring. He reaches down and scratches the top of his head, “Hey little boy, you miss me?”</p><p>He named his cat Scorpius because his mother had ingrained in him that to be a proper Black one must name their male children after constellations.</p><p>The cat meows throatily, still rubbing himself against Draco’s legs as he turns the flashlight on his phone on low. He doesn't want to wake up Harry, and they always sleep with their door open so Scorpius can go in and out as he pleases.  He toes off his shoes, nearly falling over into the stacked bikes to his right in the process. He turns around, undoing his belt and hanging it on the hooks on the front door. Then after levitating his phone to follow in front of him a beat, he pads into further up the hallway, undoing the buttons of his shirt, throwing it on top of a pile of worn shirts on his black dresser. He strips down to his bright purple boxer briefs, throwing his trousers on top of the dresser and bright green patterned socks into the laundry basket beside the dresser.</p><p>Their apartment is modest, it’s a two bedroom, but they use the second bedroom as a living room because it’s New York and the designated living space is small. Harry always says that when Granger comes to visit he’s going to have her cast some extender charms. But it’s been two years and she still hasn’t.</p><p>No one blames her and Ron, they have two kids both not yet Hogwarts age. Draco hasn’t even been to England in that time and all he has is a needy cat. Oh, and Harry, he supposes.</p><p>He walks a few steps forward sneaking quickly and quietly passed the bedroom’s open door, and into their tiny hallway kitchen. It is literally one tiny usable space of counter, where an espresso machine sits, hogging all except a small sliver of the usable counter.  Harry loves to cook, but hates cooking in this teaspoon sized kitchen. The only other counter is next to their sink and has their drying rack for the dishes. There’s no way they’d have a dishwasher paying this low of rent, which by any standards would be outrageously high. Harry had almost gagged at how much it is. But Draco had assured it was low and rent stabilized.</p><p>Draco pours himself a huge glass of water from the charmed self-refilling pitcher next to the espresso machine.  He takes huge gulps, audibly guzzling down as much water as possible. He knows it’s the only way to cure tomorrow’s impending hangover, since he hasn't had time to brew any hangover potion and Harry’s rubbish at potions.  His work is always craziest this time of year, and between that and all the parties for the different companies he works at, he definitely has not had any time to brew.</p><p>He sips the last of the water and grabs his phone out of the air, turning off the flashlight.  Then he double backs down the slender hallway, to the bedroom. He slips into bed knowing he’ll be mad at not brushing his teeth in the morning, but not caring as his bare chest feels the soft sheets and mattress under it.  He sighs heavily, risking a glance at Harry who’s wrapped up, well more like tangled in four blankets, but somehow not sweating. His breathing is steady, Draco’s notorious for waking him when he comes home this late, he can’t help but feel relieved he hasn't, he’s insufferable if he wakes up.</p>
<hr/><p>Draco feels his shoulder being repeatedly shaken, he hears the far away sound of what he thinks is his alarm.</p><p>“Fucking turn that shit off, Malfoy!”</p><p>Draco snaps awake, shoving his hand under his pillow, and silencing his phone.  He’s still on his stomach, face turned away from the other man, his cat is repeatedly pawing at his bare calf with his claws for food.  </p><p>“Good morning to you too, sweetheart.” Draco says and he hopes it sounds more cheeky than groggy, but he’s not sure he’s succeeded. He pulls himself up, rolling over, his cat jumps off the bed yowling at him from the door.  He walks out, realizes he really has to piss, and does a bit of a shuffle dance as he peels off his boxer-briefs. He throws them somewhere and quickly grabs the cat food, feeding Scorpius too much in his haste. Draco laughs a bit to himself, what a sexy sight he must be, bent over feeding his cat completely naked, and nearly pissing himself. He yawns as he levitates the bag of cat food back in place, then half runs into the bathroom. He pisses and washes his hands making sure not to look at himself in the mirror. With a long and somewhat dramatic sigh he could win an award for, he braces himself on the sink with both hands.</p><p>He feels pretty much how he’d thought he would, his head feels a bit like it’s full of cotton instead of a working brain.  Gathering his courage he looks at himself in the mirror, all these parties and long hours are weighing on his face, he has dark circles under his eyes. His skin is somehow much paler than it ever was at Hogwarts, he blames it on the tall buildings.  </p><p>Draco is late, but what else is new? The apparation point closest to his office is still a 10 minute walk if he doesn't stop for coffee, which he must if he has any hope of survival. He casts a quick few charms to clean his teeth, and hair.  He washes his face in the sink, touching the deepening wrinkles that are forming between his eyes and at the edges of his mouth from laughing. He prods at the bags under his eyes and thinks about casting some glamours.</p><p>“You’re hogging the bathroom.” Harry calls from the other-side of the door.</p><p>Draco fucking <em> hates </em> it when they both have to be in at the same time.  It seriously is the bloody <em> worst </em> , their space is too cramped, they end up both being late. Well, Draco always ends up later than usual, and Harry who’s usually punctual ends up late and then bitches about it for at least two fucking <em> awful </em> days.  </p><p>“Harry, you <em> know </em> my routine.  You should wake up earlier, this <em> always </em> happens.” Draco says as he opens the bathroom door, and steps away, past Harry, knocking shoulders with him.</p><p>“Well, if you actually went into work on time, and didn't drink till Merlin knows when, you’d be gone when I got up.” Harry says, punctuating it with a slam of the bathroom door. Draco flips the closed door two fingers with a glare in a fit of maturity, then moves to his pile of clothes, he pulls out some grey jeans that he hasn’t worn lately, then walks to his closet picking out a light purple button up. He summons his socks and pants, because he always forgets his socks. He puts on all his clothes, tucks the button up into his jeans, as he walks over to the front door where the belts are and selecting his black one.</p><p>Harry is still in the bathroom, the shower is still running.  Draco rolls his eyes, his hair potion is in there. He walks over to the bathroom, rolling up his sleeves to just under his elbows, putting on display the half sleeve of flower tattoos he’s gotten to cover up the dark mark.</p><p>He places a pale hand onto the handle and pushes it open in one steady movement. Harry is sitting on the toilet, hand moving in a rapid upward and down motion, phone in his other hand with a pair of female tits, which then cuts to a shaved twat on his phone.  </p><p>“Jesus, Malfoy!” Harry bellows, clicking the home button to clear the screen too late. The damage has been done.</p><p>He’s wanking to gals again.</p><p>The use of his last name hurts somehow more with what he’d been viewing. Draco summons the hair potion, it slaps against his palm loudly. “Classy, <em> Potter </em>.” He coldly bites out, making the man's last name sound as sharp as daggers.  Then mimicking Harry, slams the door as hard as he can. Scorpius poofs up all the hair on his tail and runs down the hall to, Draco assumes, hide under the bed.</p><p>Draco smooths his hair in the bedroom mirror, it falls around his face perfectly now kinks gone, reaching just below his chin. He hears the shower turn off, he’s still smoothing a perfect patch of bang when he hears wet footsteps coming closer. He looks up meeting Harry’s eyes in the mirror.</p><p>“Draco…” Harry starts, he’s shirtless in just an orange towel hanging low over his hipbones, water droplets fall from the curls at the base of his neck onto his shoulders.  The skin there starts to prick up into goosebumps.</p><p>“So, I’m Draco again, now?” One thin blond eyebrow raises. There aren't any words exchanged between them for a beat, it's awkward, unpleasant, so <em> bloody </em>telling. “Right then, I’ll be back late tonight.  Music library party.”</p><p>“Draco…” Harry starts again, but Draco strides forward past Harry, grabbing his black tote bag, with a graphic of a cat scratching a record, from the hallway floor. Without looking back, he unlocks the door and apparates once he hits the threshold of the wards.</p>
<hr/><p>Draco works in television. It's a very high stress, long hours, somewhat well paid position.</p><p>He loves it.  </p><p>He’s mostly a supervisor, and his favorite part of his job is finding errors during the color correction screening. Finding those small errors are his specialty, everyone knows he’ll find one frame long mistakes.</p><p>“Time code 41:45 there’s a subtitle that overhangs a frame too long, please cut with the cut.” Draco says, he’s been extra critical during this review after this morning. “That’s all my notes,” he takes out his pack of American Spirit’s and lighter, “do you guys need me or are we good?” His coworkers tell them he’s fine to leave, “I don't need to watch the shit that goes to international.” And with that he’s gone. He’s walking away, down the hall, placing his cigarette so it dangles loosely against his lips, bobbing precariously with every step.</p><p>Draco strides to the elevator bank, impatiently pressing the button several times. With a heavy sigh he grabs the cigarette and places it behind his ear just to have something to do with his hands, besides check his phone for what he knows are zero texts from Harry. He braces himself with his left hand against the wall, he remembers when they use to text all day, he’d get so worked up and hard at work just from Harry’s dirty texts and pictures he thought for sure he’d get fired.</p><p>“You feel like shit too?” Joe says as he approaches from behind Draco, the blond turns around and studies Joe’s face.  The brunette man before him has a scruffy beard and is rather slight of frame, his blue eyes look tired, he has slight freckles over his nose and cheeks. Draco lets out another puff of air, as if to say no shit. “Where the fucks your coat?”</p><p>“Eh, I’ll be fine.” The elevator chimes and opens, Draco casts a quick warming charm as Joe files into the elevator ahead of him. New York City has a much more lax law on misuse of magic, which is to say so long as nobody sees, they don’t care.  See something say something.</p><p>They chat idly about the shows they are currently working on in the elevator. Then they exit and smoke outside, bitching about their deadlines.</p><p>If there’s three things this industry is known for it’s alcohol, long hours, and complaining. Everyone complains about their job, but most of the time they actually really enjoy it. It’s a bit of a masochistic industry. Everyone's been abused as freelancer at some point (or most of their careers) and when they finally get shit company paid for health insurance they know they’ve made it.</p><p>Harry doesn't get it, he doesn't work the hours Draco does, he doesn't care about his job like Draco does.  He just works to get paid, never working to really accomplish anything to make a career, to make a name for himself.  His name is known, his name is not toiled in the mud in England. He can go back and go back to his life there. Harry's not a Malfoy.</p><p>He doesn’t get it.  </p><p>Draco takes a deep breath in of his cigarette, and finds himself wanting to bitch about Harry. But it’s a topic for over drinks, not over a cigarette at three in the afternoon. But he can’t help himself.</p><p>“Joe, are you seeing anyone?” Joe throws him a raised eyebrow, and exhales a long drag out of the corner of his mouth before speaking.</p><p>“You already know the answer to that Draco,” he pauses a beat before continuing, his tone somewhat cautious,“but if you're asking, I assume not all is well with,” he places the butt of his cigarette between his lips, inflecting his voice in muffled fake-awe, while doing half arsed air quotes, “the Chosen One.”</p><p>Joe is the only other wizard he knows about that works in his office. When he had introduced him to Harry, Joe had stuttered and dropped his full beer on the ground.</p><p>“I might have,” Draco thinks of how to word the next part, while their industry isn't the most professional he still tries to be, at least during business hours, “caught him wanking to girls, again.” Eh, fuck it.</p><p>He waits for Joe to react. Joe takes the last long drag from his cigarette, dropping it on the sidewalk and smothering it with his toe. “You waited till I was done to reveal that?” He says as he takes out another cigarette, Draco still has half his American Spirit left.</p><p>He watches Joe light his cigarette then with the same hand run it through his hair.  “I’m not sure what to say Draco. Was she a redhead?”</p><p>Everyone knows that Harry’s redhead ex-girlfriend, who he still talks to, is a huge sore spot for Draco. Draco hates Ginny with fierce jealousy that’s truly unbecoming. Harry is bisexual, with his preference for men more steady, or at least that's what he had told Draco.  </p><p>“Didn’t get to see a face,” he pauses, “or any hair.” Draco shudders for effect, he inhales his cigarette, and looks towards the other man.</p><p>“Was he like…” Joe pauses, lips moving without speaking for a moment, as if he’s not sure how to word the next part. Then he stops, and says slowly, “laying… next to you?”</p><p>“No, it was in the bathroom.” Draco says, furrowing his brow as he looks down at his cigarette to avoid Joe’s eyes.</p><p>“So, uh… he was alone so…?” Joe says also pointedly looking away from Draco. Suddenly interested at anything completely not near the other man.</p><p>“I’m not sure what I’m looking for here, just wanted to say it out loud, I suppose.” Draco answers honestly, he looks at Joe through his blond fringe, not tilting his head up.</p><p>“I mean, you think about other men, right?” Joe says, punctuating it with a deep inhale and a shiver. Draco supposes it is quite cold and this topic is quite cringeworthy.</p><p>“I mean… sure? I more so would say I think of others then inserting myself in a situation?”</p><p>“Harry's bisexual, so it’s not like he’s also… uh?” He trails off, squinting at nothing. “Whatever Draco.” Joe snaps, like he’s fed up tip toeing around what he’s trying to say. “We all fucking jerk off to other people just because it was a female someone, doesn't mean you need to get all…” he trails off again, gesturing in a circling motion in Draco’s direction with his cigarette, “whatever this is? Jealous? Weirded out? Pissed off?”</p><p>“I’m not like such a prude…” Draco lowers his voice, “I know it’s normal to fantasize, but it's different when-” he stops. He really shouldn't get into his sex life or really the fact that there isn't one at bloody three thirty, outside his office building. They stand in a beat of awkward silence. Both not looking at each other.</p><p>“You guys have been so weird lately.” Joe tells him, with a single shoulder shrug, real concern seeping through the sentence. And really what an understatement. Draco changes the subject to Network deadlines.</p>
<hr/><p>His alarm is blaring, it finally rouses Draco enough to get out of bed and stop pressing snooze. There’s a moment where he hugs his phone to his bare chest and he honestly thinks about dozing again. What’s another 10 minutes when you’re already thirty late anyways? But in that moment Scorpius walks the length of the bed from his position at their feet and starts pawing at Draco’s face for food. He groans loudly, Harry is still somewhat asleep, somehow not yelling at Draco after the orchestra of snoozed alarms for the past hour.</p><p>He stands up, displacing the cat who jumps down meowing throatily at him. Scorpius runs ahead of him, tail up, Draco takes the first few steps towards the door and down the narrow hall. He scratches his bare back, making his way towards the cat food in yesterday's boxer briefs. Scorpius runs full sprint into the living room, his giant goofy leaps make Draco ponder the weirdness of cats as he pours some food out. He then turns towards the bathroom and looks up, “Fuck!” He shouts, cat food spills everywhere as he startles backwards, at the large eagle owl at his window by the record player.</p><p>“What the fuck!” Harry yells and he hears him get up, the annoyed rhythm of his padded footsteps as he stomps over, turning from the bedroom door frame towards Draco, entirely naked and half hard. “All your alarms and now- Merlin’s beard!” Harry yelps as he sees the owl, covering his dick as if the bird cares about modesty.</p><p>Draco steps forward, tentatively. Both his and Harry’s friends and family all talk to each other through mostly muggle means. Between texting, Skype, and WhatsApp it’s just easier and faster than large owls appearing in the <em> middle of fucking </em>Brooklyn.</p><p>“It has to be the ministry.” Draco whispers, stock still. His mind reels, maybe he somehow violated his parole? What had he done? He couldn't think of anything, maybe a muggle saw him cast a warming charm? Maybe they changed lubrication charms from a class three to a class five? Maybe it was his mother, she was still incredibly young for a witch at 55 and Pureblood there wasn't much to worry about except accidents and slowly progressing illnesses . And he supposed everyone hating Malfoy's, but that's been going on for centuries.</p><p>“Go get it.” Harry says urgently, still covering himself with his hands. The owls starts to tap impatiently against the window. Scorpius who at some point had poked his head out the living room, ducks back into it.</p><p>Draco strides forward, pulling up the window and taking the letter that’s safely stashed into a satchel around the bird. The ministry used them for long flights or inclement weather. The owl hoots and takes off. The letter feels heavy in Draco’s hand and he feels his world tilt sideways, it’s addressed to him.</p><p>Harry waddles to the window, slamming it down on the sill and placing the curtain back in place. He places a hand on Draco's bare lower back, he grips the taller man’s wrist in the other and Draco realizes that he’s shaking.</p><p>They stand there for a moment, Draco’s fingers press in the fancy parchment. Harry’s hands are warm and spread heat into Draco, he has a feeling he’s using a warming charm. Then they walk, Harry steering Draco into the living room. They sit, Scorpius poking his head out from behind one of the curtains before disappearing again.</p><p>Draco breaks open the wax seal, he can’t stand the anticipation anymore. He pulls out the letter, it’s thick and multiple pages of different parchment colors and weights. When his eyes land on the words, he scans them quickly and breathes out a sigh of relief. He immediately feels guilt twist his stomach at feeling relieved for a second. Lucius Malfoy’s will and letter of condolences from the Ministry sits in his hands. His face feels hot and he isn't sure how he should feel.</p><p>This man was never really a father, so obsessed with power and Pureblood culture. Draco wonders sometimes what he would say if he knew he was gay. If he knew he was dating Harry Potter. If he knew he had tattooed over the red faded burn of the dark lord’s mark. Maybe he had known, the news of his and Harry's relationship had run for multiple weeks due to Rita Skeeter’s penmanship.</p><p>Now, he stands conflicted. This man is his father, but he never knew Draco really. They’d interact over Draco’s studies, or Quidditch, or their hatred of Potter. Lucius had been strict bordering on abusive when Draco had let him down or done something wrong. Draco had always strived to make him proud as a child, eventually taking the mark and staring at his father as he was burned and tasked with the impossible. Losing himself and his childhood innocence because of his expectations. While, ultimately Draco's choice, at the time it hadn't felt like he had any options.</p><p>He couldn't forgive that. He couldn't pretend he was okay with his father and answer his messages. The last one he had received had been a few days prior, his mother had visited and recorded a voice message of Lucius for him. He hadn't listened. They had been estranged for close to ten years, around the time he had moved here.</p><p>His death didn’t feel real. Draco felt the same, maybe just shocked? Maybe just a little angry at feeling guilty about their relationship? It wasn't like it really changed anything, really?</p><p>The death was unexpected, and the report was vague. Draco suspected the death wasn't natural, but couldn't bare to read more dry Ministry bullshit for a man he wasn't sure how to feel about. He pushed the papers towards Harry, who took them with a very serious face, despite being completely naked. He flips through the papers and reads in silence as Draco counts his breaths.</p><p>“He left you a few vaults and some possessions in the manor.” Harry says eventually, strained, unsympathetic. He looks at Draco who leans to his left, placing his elbow on the arm of the sofa and leaning heavily onto it.</p><p>“I don't care.” Draco mumbles into his hand. There’s a long pause, one where Harry stops flittering with the pages and just stares at the other man.</p><p>“This says your mother is supposed to collect his remains from Azkaban today. Do you-”</p><p>“I don't want to fucking go.” Draco snaps, looking around the living room, he’s sure he left a pack of cigarettes in here.</p><p>“Accio cigarette pack.” Harry says specifically, after a gross handful of ash and cigarette butts he knows to be specific. They fly from somewhere else in the apartment to his outstretched palm. Draco is already leaning over to grab the long lighter they keep in here for candles. Harry passes him one, and the takes the foot-long lighter and helps Draco.</p><p>“I can't fucking go.” Draco repeats, smoke punctuating every syllable. “I don't even really feel anything, but annoyed and bloody guilty.” He puffs the cigarette, inhaling and exhaling too fast. He feels like he can't breathe.</p><p>“Then don't go.” Harry says, again it’s plainly and emotionless. For whatever reason this annoys Draco and places the cigarette in his lips. He uncurls from the arm of the sofa and throws his head back, lifting his feet to rest on the coffee table. One arm lazily falls over the arm rest the other into Harry’s bare lap as he stares into the ceiling. Cigarette smoke floats up in his peripheral vision before dissipating.</p><p>“I already said I’m not.” Draco says, the filter of his cigarette bounces on his bottom lip, stuck there. Harry sits beside him not saying anything. There isn't anything to say since Draco knows he’s not sorry. He finishes the cigarette in silence, not really moving except to pull the cigarette away from his lips to ash it.</p><p>“Are you-” Harry starts, he’s biting the nail of his left thumb. Something he only does when he's truly worried.</p><p>“I have to get ready for work, I’m so late.” Draco says as he stands, he feels off balance. Harry doesn't say anything still, just watches as he walks out of the room.</p>
<hr/><p>The funeral for Lucius comes and goes. A week passes and Draco throws himself into his work. He throws himself into his social life, he feels reckless and restless. He has to do something at all times to feel occupied not with the guilt of not going, of not answering, of not talking. It itches beneath his skin, begging him to scratch at his inner forearm.</p><p>His mother had understood because she always does.</p><p>So he leaves work and calls his friend Bradley, who’s very attractive and unemployed. They get shit faced together at three o’clock on a Tuesday. His friend is confused why Draco called him, they use to just get drunk and high, then hook up. Draco tells him about Harry and nervously laughs, saying he can't do the latter part of their usual plans. Bradley tells him about his new apartment and the weed he has from California. The amount of not sly mentions of the short cab distance to Bradley's Gramercy apartment makes Draco feel uneasy.</p><p>He remembers the amazing sex they use to have, Bradley grinding him into the kitchen counter, Draco’s legs spread wide one over his shoulder the other wrapped around his waist. Bradley flirts with him the whole time, making innuendos about fucking him and other men at any chance. The conversation always veers back to sex no matter where it starts. And Draco’s reminded why he stopped hanging out with him.</p>
<hr/><p>Draco is out again.  It’s his third night in a row. He texted Harry a long novel using his father as an excuse. Harry texted him back passive aggressively, Draco had chosen to ignore it, instead opting to throw back his drink and order another in silent protest.  Joe has already left, it’s just him and some people from other companies including the music house who’s hosting the event. He leans his back against the bar, his drink sweats against his right palm, it’s cold against his fingers. He usually takes whiskey neat, but has opted for an Old Fashion because he’s already a bit sloshed.</p><p>A thin man walks up beside him at the bar, Draco doesn't recognize him from last year. He must be one of the new music producers at Extreme. He reaches his hand out and orders a beer from the bartender, then rests his hip against the bar, leaning close to Draco.  </p><p>“Hey, I’ve seen you around the parties this year. I’m Rich.” He reaches out a dark skinned hand, Draco grips it looking down at their contrasting skin colors and feeling how soft his skin is.  His mind goes for a second to the first time he saw Harry’s dark skin against his pale pink cock.</p><p>Fuck, he’s drunk and hasn’t been laid in months.</p><p>Draco smiles at the man, then makes semi painful small talk.  The man insists on exchanging numbers under the pretense of work. Draco just doesn't care he looks down at his phone, guilt seeping through him, debates with himself on handing it over. He orders a last drink knowing it should’ve been two or three whiskeys ago, but throws it back anyways.  He stumbles a bit, Rich steadies him with one of those thin hands.</p><p>
  <span>He still hasn't brewed hangover potion.  But at least tomorrow is Saturday. He honestly isn't sure why he’s still out, he just knows he doesn't want to go home. Rich’s hands are still on his waist and hip, and he finds himself chatting for a few fuzzy moments, he’s not sure if it's been five minutes or an hour. There’s a smile on the other man’s face, he looks drunk too, he feels the other man’s hand slip into his pocket, grabbing his phone and typing in his contact info, while Draco wavers in his spot without the other man’s steadying hands. The phone makes its way back into his left hand and he looks down to see the angry red bubble of 12 unread text messages. He opens the ap and sees ten of them are from Harry. He closes it, slipping the phone into his pocket, scrubs his hand over his face then flags the bartender. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Draco wakes up and doesn't have any recollection of getting home, but his head hurts and he has to rush to his bathroom to puke. Regret fills his pores as he purges his body of all liquid left in his stomach. He doesn't think he made too much of an ass of himself, but anxiety floods his brain and he can't think of anything else. Joe texts him, he ignores it. Nicole sends him a picture of what he assumes is her in bed, but it just looks like a pile of patterned blankets with some brown hair poking out. There’s a moment when he thinks about texting back, but he can't bring himself to open the floodgates telling him what he did last night. </span>
</p><p>Harry hasn't texted him since yesterday at three am, he’s working the early shift, and Draco has to make himself presentable before he comes home. The blond forces himself to puke again as Scorpius scratches on the door trying to get in. The world spins as he sits up, feeling both sick to his stomach and hungry. Why does he do this? He’s not 19 anymore.</p><p>He places his feet against the cool tile and forces himself to stand, opening Seamless on his phone and ordering a bagel with cream cheese and two large waters to meet the minimum for delivery. Then, with what has to be all his effort, he stands opening the door to a very curious Scorpius. Stumbling he makes his way to the kitchen sink, he promised Harry he’d do the dishes, so he levitates them and repeatedly casts scourgify, until he deems them clean enough and sends them flying into the various cabinets.</p><p>This simple set of first year spells has him all but heaving, he shoves his wand behind his ear before falling onto his hands, raking in breathes. Without much warning he pukes in the sink, he pulls out his wand and vanishes it. He’s hunched over and starts to sob uncontrollably. The tears leak out and roll onto the floor as he presses his eyes into his wrists laying against the counter.</p><p>He’ll never speak to his father again, and he realizes that he fucking <em> cares </em> . It startles him. It fucking <em> hurts </em>. He sobs emptily into the backs of his hands, and he can’t stop. Draco collapses onto the floor, laying like a rag-doll in the middle of the hallway. One knee is bent at an uncomfortable angle, half his leg falls asleep as he lays there. Scorpius eventually plops down half on his chest purring.</p><p>He thinks about the good things they had shared. Watching quidditch matches together every summer holiday. The time he had made his father laugh so hard over the anecdote of Greg and Vince eating bewitched floating pastries. Making his father proud over making it onto the Slytherin team second term. Eating green apples from their orchard fresh off the trees together. Walking the grounds only to both have to run away from some of the meaner peacocks.</p><p>Draco stops crying at some point, his ears and neck are still moist.  He finds himself staring at the ceiling, mind no longer reeling. He brings a hand to idly pet Scorpius. The restless reckless feeling is still there, but seems further away.</p><p>Where the hell is his bagel and water?</p>
<hr/><p>The next week Harry has Sunday off in a scheduling mix up. Draco finds himself sitting next to Harry on the beach in early January. It’s cold, but Harry’s wandless warming charms are a thing of legends, right under the whole killing the dark lord with a bloody expelliarmus. Harry has brought warm Butterbeer and they sit in silence.</p><p>It’s not awkward, just a bit tense like they both have too much to say, but don’t want to say anything. Draco sighs heavily and takes a sip of the warm drink, it’s too sweet for his tastes, but it takes him back to time spent at the Three Broomsticks with Pansy, Blaise, and Theo. She was always all over him, complaining about professors or her father, nursing a pumpkin juice with her head against his shoulder. He can remember her snorting laugh that’d slip out if something actually amused her. Blaise had been flippant, always looking for some girl or guy to charm into doing his homework for him or get him into the prefects bathroom. Draco and Theo would share secret glances from across the table, having had a very on-again, off-again, secret relationship throughout all of school that mostly consisted of rushed, toothy blow jobs.</p><p>Sometimes, especially in sixth year, he’d go with just Crabbe and Goyle. So preoccupied and honestly scared shitless. At the time he liked their lackluster conversation, something to fill the space, but nothing to concentrate on. Relishing in their fiercely loyal to Draco, but in the back of his mind knowing they were really scared of Lucius as well as their own fathers.</p><p>Harry hums beside him bringing him to the present, away from Hogwarts, back to Coney Island. He looks over and Harry is staring at him.</p><p>“Honestly Draco, we’ve been together what, three years, yeah?” Harry’s hair blows in the wind, it’s trapped under a maroon beanie, but the long curls blow into his eyes and over his wind-reddened dark skinned nose. He looks so cute, Draco just wants to kiss him.</p><p>“Yeah, almost.” Draco hears himself respond, the weight of it feels heavier than it should be. He isn't sure if Harry is going to break up with him or propose, he could really see it go either way.</p><p>“We really should be better at this.” Harry looks away from his eyes and lifts his chin into the air, looking at the wispy thin clouds that hang low in the sky, it almost looks like they could fall and just be fog over Brooklyn, but they don't move, just hang stagnant, mocking them.</p><p>“I’m damaged, Potter.” Draco says, it’s a bit too bitter and raw sounding even in his own head than to feel like the joke he intended it to be.</p><p>“I think in our year,” Harry hums again, reaching his left hand to the stubble that’s grown too much on his chin. He scratches at it for a moment before taking a sip and continues, “we all are, yeah?”</p><p>It’s Draco’s turn to look away and hum in agreement, so he does and avoids Harry’s green eyes that are tracking the emotions that flitter across his face. Since leaving England it’s been harder to school himself without completely shutting everything down. He partially blames it on Harry’s influence and the rest on the lack of Lucius’s presence.</p><p>“We use to be so happy.” Harry says, and it’s sort of wistful. He stares at Draco who fiddles with his hat, making it cover his ears more. Then there’s a sigh from the other man, he turns away again, fidgeting with the paper around the bottle, peeling it off in uneven jagged strips.</p><p>“What happened to us?” Draco finds himself asking earnestly. It hurts, but so does this relationship a lot of days.</p><p>“I rely on you too much? I’m lonely.” Harry says, tearing off another strip and letting it go in the wind.</p><p>“And I feel guilty that you're lonely.”Draco says, putting his unoccupied hand on top of his hat. “Lucius’s death kinda made me a bit of a crazy person.” Harry whips around to look at him again.</p><p>“Draco, I love you, but you’re so bloody out of control and weird sometimes.” Harry’s voice wavers, there’s a moment that Draco thinks he can look at him, but he can't bring himself to, so instead he plops his Butterbeer in the sand and reaches for his cigarettes. He needs one to get through this moment. Harry waits until Draco finally looks at him, blowing smoke in his general direction. “You really have to quit, those things are gonna kill you.”</p><p>“What do you want me to say to that?” Draco retorts, feeling prickly. “You knew I was a smoker and apparently a fucking weird out of control one.” Draco pulls off his slate grey beanie, it lands in the sand, he runs his left hand through his hair. He didn’t put any product in it and it hangs in slight waves past his ears. He looks to the right, there’s a couple that’s making their way closer to them. They look so <em> fucking </em> happy, hand in hand, matching in those slim winter jackets runners use.</p><p>“Fucking unfair Draco, I want to try, and I get the shit with your dad, but I know it’s not all that.” Harry pauses to chew on his thumbnail for a brief few seconds. “And sometimes you make it almost impossible, you know?” Harry’s staring at him, all heated angry intensity. Draco knows what he’s saying is true, but it still stings that old pride portion of him. He hasn’t had it easy and it hurts to have his faults poked at by someone he loves even if it is out of concern.</p><p>He inhales the cigarette before exclaiming, “You think you make it easy? You’re not innocent either.” With each word a small puff of smoke releases, until he’s exhaling a thin line at the end.</p><p>“I didn't bloody say- Merlin Malfoy!” Harry’s still staring at him, Draco stares daggers at the dumb couple who look so <em> in love </em> they must be only a couple months in <em> max </em>.</p><p>“Well, I want to give this a go, too, you know!” Draco feels himself all but yell, he puffs his cigarette too fast, it’s already a third gone. There’s another long beat, the couple is closer now, Draco can almost make out the woman’s face, any reason to not look at Harry.</p><p>“You gotta fucking talk to me!” Harry explodes beside him, he’s all antsy, probably wanting to throw or crush things, as he glares Draco who keeps avoiding his gaze. “You’re a fucking mess and I’m not saying I’m not either, but we can't keep existing together this way!”</p><p>“You gotta stop being so bloody stubborn and out of control angry at my existence.” Draco accuses, exhaling smoke furiously. “Also, fucking fuck me!” The couple has come within apparently shouting distance, they’re both looking at them. “Welcome to the fucking freak show!” Draco yells waving, his cigarette hanging limply from his lips, then flips them off, they look away and walk faster.</p><p>“You’re such a prick.” Harry moans, covering his face with both hands, pulling his knees to his chest and all but burying within himself here on the beach.</p><p>“You’ve definitely always known that, Potter.” Draco sighs and flicks his cigarette away, then looks at Harry who’s brooding into his sleeves, his knees are draw up, arms slung around them. Draco can't see his mouth as the bottom half of his face is pressed into his legs, but sees his eyes are staring ahead at the rolling waves. “Okay, I’m going to try. I really am no more secrets, Prefects honor.”</p><p>“I’ll fuck you tonight if you want.” Harry bursts out, still curled up in himself.</p><p>“Such a romantic, Potter.”</p><p>“What do they say in those Star Trek romance novels you read online?” Harry asks turning a blinding grin resembling a cat, Draco sputters a bit, thrown. “Take me in your battleship?”</p><p>“Oh my god!” Draco exclaims, turning pink all over his face instantly. “It’s not Star Trek! It’s Star Wars.”</p><p>“Oh sorry, your royal nerdiness , I didn't know there was a difference.” His eyes get that glint that tell Draco he’s purposely fucking with him.</p><p>Draco huffs, mock annoyed, still pink, “You don't get it.”</p><p>“Get what? Draco Malfoy, scary ex-Death Eater is a huge sci-fi geek?” Harry smirks mischievously.</p><p>“It’s basically cannon! It’s destiny!” Draco exclaims passionately. He reaches forward and grips the collar of Harry’s jacket with one hand, dramatically. The other man grins at him sideways before laughing soft and fond.</p><p>“God you’re a fucking dork. I love you.” He turns and kisses the inside of Draco's wrist, head still tilted. Draco pulls his hand back as Harry settles back still staring, his face sets into a serious line. “Seriously though, trying again?” Harry asks muffled, as he tilts his face in his arms towards Draco, one eye is covered, the other peeks at him. His hair moves in the slight breeze, and Draco sighs with just how cute Harry can be.</p><p>Harry pulls his head back, untangling from himself, and reaches for his Butterbeer. Draco rolls his eyes, but grabs his as well it’s chilly to the touch, but he doesn't mind.</p><p>“Trying harder.” Draco replies and clinks their glasses together, they both take a large swig of the cold sickly-sweet butterscotch beverage, Draco gags. “God this drink is utter shite, how did we ever drink this as children.” Harry laughs, it’s warm and loud and so <em> Harry. </em>He then leans over and places his head on Draco’s shoulder. They sit and watch the waves roll into each other, crashing against the cold winter sand.</p><p><br/>
