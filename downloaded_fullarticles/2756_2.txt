<p> </p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes and stared up at the ceiling in confusion, wondering why he was awake. His small bedroom at the Dursley's was still enveloped in darkness and the house was utterly silent.</p>
<p>He was about to blame it on bad dreams and close his eyes again when he suddenly noticed it: a strange vibration throughout his body, as though a weak electric current was running just under his skin.</p>
<p>He quickly became a lot more alert when he realised that in conjunction with the strange buzzing, he felt an overwhelming achiness in his limbs, as well as being stiflingly hot and sweaty.</p>
<p>Harry sat up with a muted groan as his body immediately protested the movement.</p>
<p>"Brilliant," he muttered as he rubbed at his eyes, assuming that he’d come down with some sort of virus. He was currently living on his own; his Aunt and Uncle having decided to remain where they had fled to during the war. They intended to resume their life in Surrey after Harry returned to Hogwarts for his eighth and final year of schooling, and Harry hoped to never see them again.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and his breath caught in his throat. His fingers were glowing with a faint white light, which then began to crackle the longer he stared at them. The electric buzzing just under his skin suddenly intensified and Harry quickly threw back the bedclothes and jumped to his feet, staring down at his body in fear.</p>
<p>Nothing else appeared to be amiss aside from his glowing fingertips.</p>
<p>Harry frowned and glanced at his wand sitting on the bedside cabinet, unsure as to whether he should touch it or not. It felt as though his magic suddenly had a mind of its own and wanted to strike out at something.</p>
<p>Harry clapped a hand over his mouth when his stomach suddenly turned over.</p>
<p>He immediately sprinted for the toilet down the hall and collapsed onto his knees before the porcelain bowl. He only just made it in time as he emptied the contents of his stomach into it in great heaving convulsions.</p>
<p>Once his stomach was empty and the swirling nausea had faded to a tolerable level, Harry dropped his forehead onto the cool white toilet seat and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>He swallowed and kept his eyes shut as wave after wave of dizziness continued to break over him, making him feel faint and light-headed. He <em>really</em> wasn’t keen on the idea of passing out on the floor all alone. What if he hit his head? No one would even think to check on him until he didn't show up for the Hogwarts Express - which was still a month away.</p>
<p>Harry swallowed and did the only thing he could think of - he croakily called out for Kreacher.</p>
<p>The stooped and knobbly-kneed little house-elf appeared quite quickly. "Master Harry, how may I assist you?" he asked in a voice as dry as paper. He gave a slight bow as though he wasn't even aware that he was standing in the loo next to someone who was currently hunched over a toilet smelling of vomit.</p>
<p>Harry forced his eyes open a crack and looked at him. "I'm not well Kreacher, could you perhaps bring me some potions from Hogwarts? I'm sure Madam Pomfrey wouldn't mind…"</p>
<p>Kreacher's large bulbous eyes narrowed at Harry and his nostrils flared when he leaned in and sniffed.</p>
<p>Harry flinched away from him with a frown. "What…?"</p>
<p>"Master is in the midst of his change," he replied as though that answered everything.</p>
<p>"What… change?" Harry questioned weakly, closing his eyes when another wave of nausea abruptly washed over him.</p>
<p>Kreacher stepped in and took another whiff then nodded to himself. "Master is coming into his Omega inheritance."</p>
<p>Harry's eyes snapped back open. "O-omega?" he repeated, tripping over the word. "Don't you mean Alpha? I thought only females were Omegas."</p>
<p>Kreacher slowly shook his head. Ever since the war Kreacher had become a lot more helpful, and Harry had come to trust him; though by no means had he become even half the friend to Harry that Dobby had been.</p>
<p>"Male Omega is rare," Kreacher explained slowly. "The Black family had one a century ago."</p>
<p>"Are you sure that I'm… that I'm one?" Harry asked, not wanting to say the word out loud; it was too embarrassing. Omegas were highly sought after females who produced offspring for their Alpha mates when they went through a heat cycle - that wasn't <em>him</em>.</p>
<p>Kreacher nodded confidently. "You are producing the Omega scent. Mistress Narcissa was the same when she turned eighteen. Master Sirius' Alpha scent was very different to this one. You are not Alpha or Beta."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Harry replied dryly, closing his eyes and leaning against the toilet once more. "Is there anything I can take to stop feeling quite so awful?"</p>
<p>Kreacher bowed again. "I will fetch Master Harry potion from Hogwarts. And bring potion to mask the scent."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"You should not make known the fact that you are Omega among new Alphas at Hogwarts. Young Alphas do not have same control as older ones. Master Harry will also not make wise decisions when Alpha is near.”</p>
<p>Harry cracked his eyes open and grimaced at the small house-elf. "So what you’re saying is this special eighth year is more trouble than it’s worth?”</p>
<p>Kreacher nodded and Harry rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"Why did no one mention this when they thought it was a good idea to extend the invitation to us to return for another year?"</p>
<p>Kreacher merely stared back at him, blinking large glassy eyes.</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "Fine, please fetch me those potions Kreacher."</p>
<p>Kreacher bowed then paused before leaving. "Master Harry must also register with Ministry for own safety.”</p>
<p>"What?" Harry exclaimed in alarm. "I'm not telling the Ministry that I'm an Omega! It'll be splashed across every newspaper… how is advertising to the world that I'm an Omega a safety precaution? No, I'm not telling them anything," Harry adamantly refused, shaking his head. "Just fetch me those potions Kreacher."</p>
<p>Kreacher bowed once more before disappearing on the spot.</p>
<p>Harry dropped his head back onto the cool toilet bowl and closed his eyes. He couldn't believe he'd finally rid the world of Voldemort, ready to begin a somewhat normal life, and now <em>this</em> was suddenly thrust upon him.</p>
<p>He was beginning to think that he was cursed.</p>
<p>Harry reached up to flush the toilet and then leaned back against the cabinet beside him.</p>
<p>He would just have to confide in Ron and Hermione on the way back to Hogwarts; he was sure Hermione would know all about male Omegas and their history and have some sort of advice for him.</p>
<p>What did being 'mated' even mean for him? Did this mean that he could now get pregnant? Would the Alphas even <em>want</em> him? Would they even be interested in having a male Omega as a mate? And did he <em>have</em> to choose an Alpha or could he still be with whomever he wanted, regardless of status?</p>
<p>It was all so confusing and he found for the first time in his life that he was actually dreading returning to Hogwarts.</p>
