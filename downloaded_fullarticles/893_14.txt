  <em>On The First Day Of Christmas</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">Sarah climbed the height of the Castle's large ivory tower and huffed quietly as she nearly tripped over her gown's hem at the top. She tried the handle of the thick oaken door; locked of course; and clutched her gown higher and tighter to her breast. She turned on her heel, and glared up into the mismatched eyes of her husband. <br/>
"Are you sure this is really necessary, Jareth? You've never made a fuss about clearing out any of the other rooms in the castle before-" The tall, otherworldly blonde leaned over her with an enigmatic smile and opened the door with the lightest of touches. <br/>
"Why, Sarah~ After all these years, you still don't trust me?" he murmured softly, turning her right way 'round and ushering her through the door. The petulance at the long climb and the interruption of what <em>had </em>been shaping up to be a very lazy, self-indulgent sunday, faded from her face. </p><p align="left">"Oh-" she dropped the sage green folds of her dress to the dusty floor; caught up in the moment as sunlight spilled through stained glass windows across the floor, and caught the occult objects lining the walls. Here were ancient tomes left half-open and covered in marginalia. There, a collection of crystal orbs. Desk overflowing with notes and models and little brass instruments- the walls covered in maps; some crumbling, some as new as though just completed a moment ago. Against that wall, a fireplace. Bookshelves upon crates upon stacks of books- And, in the center of it all, a little marble lectern and a thick leatherbound tome wrapped with crimson cording. </p><p align="left">Jareth smiled to himself as she rushed off into the garret, exclaiming over this or that object. When she'd come of age, he'd gone back for her. It mattered not whether by trickery, guile, enchantment, or choice. She'd come back, she was his, and in the intervening years the magic of the Labyrinth had changed her. Taken those "certain gifts" and magnified them. And now, here in his old workshop, she would finally learn to harness them. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Blessed Yule, my Queen," he said softly, and turned to look for the book they'd been discussing before their picnic lunch had been forgotten. The answering smile on Sarah's face was worth all the bother it had taken to get here. </p><p align="left">"Merry Christmas, Jareth."</p>
