"You do?"</p><p>The Bloody Baron replied, "Just because we're dead, doesn't mean we can't feel."</p><p>Justin muttered, "I'm sorry, Mr. Bloody Baron; Sir."</p><p>The Bloody Baron insisted, "Call me Norman or Norm, young Hufflepuff."</p><p>Justin smiled. "Justin Finch-Fletchley."</p><p>The Bloody Baron asked, "Do you still wish you were a ghost, Finch-Fletchley?"</p><p>Justin beamed, "No, I'm perfectly happy being a heartbroken human; Norman."</p><p>The Bloody Baron nodded his approval and smirked.
