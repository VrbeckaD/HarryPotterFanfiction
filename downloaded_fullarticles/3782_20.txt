    <p class="p1">In the moment after the battle ended it was all Hermione could do not to flee. Every inch of her felt frightened and she could feel eyes on her all the time. Not used to being the center of attention, and very much not liking it, she confided in Ron who shared her concerns. He promised to take her away then, to someplace where the sun was warm and the air wasn’t thick with magic and death.</p><p class="p1">They stayed through the funerals, feeling that at the very least it was their duty to honor those who had fought so bravely alongside them. And with every handshake, Hermione felt like she’s fading and when the last body is in the ground they packed their things with haste. They offered to take Harry with them. He’d been just as miserable as they and they still hadn’t talked about what would happen after they’d left the cave. He looked at them seriously and then shook his head at their packed suitcases, suddenly unable to meet their eyes.</p><p class="p1">“Ginny and I-“ he whispered to them, looking out the window sounding very much like there was something stuck in his throat.</p><p class="p1">He didn’t need to say anything more. It had been weeks since he’d been theirs and with a final hug and kiss on the cheek they left the room at midnight, telling only Harry where they planned to go should he ever change his mind or they needed to be found. He forced on them enough money on them to be comfortable for years telling them that they’d given him their last seven years, it was at least his right to give them that.</p><p class="p1">They ended up purchasing a small cottage in need of repairs on the coast of France where their only neighbors are retired and leave them alone most of the year. Their house needs work and they do it slowly, spending their mornings laying new flooring and ripping out rusted pipes. They sleep among their mess but vow not to do magic, not for this part of their lives, and not for now. They shed their wizard clothing and jumpers that they’d always worn. In a fit, Hermione chopped off her long hair at her shoulders, crying about it for hours until Ron can finally tell her she’s beautiful with each and every one of her scars and kisses her so deeply that she doesn’t ache for a moment. And when after a month and a half of potions and rehabilitation his shoulder still won’t work, Hermione cried with him in the middle of their living room floor.</p><p class="p1">After half a year of remodeling, they finish the original layout of their home. The add-on bedrooms seem unsalvageable, but they don’t mind. They hadn’t had any visitors and had become more than comfortable interacting with one another in such a small space. They officially deem the former dining room where their bed goes and unpack their things.</p><p class="p1">Without renovations to occupy their time, Ron worried that Hermione will be bored and grow sad again, but they quickly adopt a new routine. They wake early for coffee and breakfast on the porch and spend their mid-days reading out on blankets spread on the lawn or exploring the countryside. They eat at new restaurants and make friends with strangers on vacation and never seem to have a shortage of interesting tales to hear.</p><p class="p1">With a week left until Christmas Harry visited them for the first time. He looked upset but doesn’t say anything as they show him around.</p><p class="p1">“I’m glad to see that you’re both doing well,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Harry told them as they all stand in the kitchen, preparing lunch of roasted red peppers topped with goat cheese from their neighbors and freshly pressed olive oil another neighbor had given them as a present before returning home for the holidays. “You both look great actually, I never would have thought it, but this lifestyle suits you.”</p><p class="p1">Hermione smiles, squeezing his hand as she passes. She knows what he means. Ron, after getting viciously sunburned for several weeks upon their arrival, finally took her advice to not be in the sun 24 hours a day and let her take care of him when he was hot to the touch. Since then he’d adopted a healthy tan rival of Charlie’s and his many freckles decorated his face. Likewise, the years of sleepless nights spent worrying about her boys and hours spent hunched over a textbook had been replaced with a carefree smile and a glow that made Harry feel warm.</p><p class="p1">When Hermione looked up Harry’s eyes were on Ron’s broad shoulders as he bent over the oven to pull the tray out. He glanced over at her and blushed, “and your hair.”</p><p class="p1">“Are you hitting on my woman?” Ron asked good-naturedly, setting the tray atop the oven and as he shut the oven door with his foot.</p><p class="p1">Harry doesn’t say anything at first and then cracks a smile. “Well, someone has to.”</p><p class="p1">Hermione is sure that this isn’t what he wants to say but they let it pass, taking their meal to their outdoor dining room and refuse to talk about anything serious while they ate. Instead, Ron and Hermione share stories of their adventures, hiking through the hills and eating with strangers and Harry fills them in on what they’d been missing back at home.</p><p class="p1">It wasn’t until they were long finished with their meal, lounging on the couch with Hermione and Ron on one end, Harry on the other, Hermione’s feet on his lap that he even mentioned why he was there.</p><p class="p1">“I expect you know why I came,” he finally said, rubbing Hermione’s foot absentmindedly, an old habit of his.</p><p class="p1">Hermione and Ron share a glance, utterly perplexed on how to proceed. “Oh?" Ron finally settled on, casually taking a sip of his wine while not breaking eye contact.</p><p class="p1">“Molly wants you home for Christmas of course.” He continued quickly.</p><p class="p1">Again Ron and Hermione look at one another, this time differently. After fleeing the aftermath, Ron and Hermione hadn’t planned on returning. They had exchanged a series of letters with Molly and Arthur, using owls from the next wizarding town over when Hermione told Ron about how guilty she felt taking him away from his parents.</p><p class="p1">“You didn’t take me away Hermione,” Ron told her with a chuckle which he realized a moment too late was ill-timed.</p><p class="p1">“I know that you wanted to come with me,” Hermione insisted, “But I still feel like I stole you from them, if it wasn’t for me then you wouldn’t even have left the country!”</p><p class="p1">In the end, they agreed to make contact with his parents at the least and since exchanged letters monthly, assuring Ron’s parents that they were alright and that they’d nothing to worry about while receiving news from back in England.</p><p class="p1">“I don’t know about that Harry,” Ron finally said for both of them, putting his arm across Hermione’s chest and kissing the side of her head. “England is a long way away, and it’s so cold in the winter.”</p><p class="p1">Harry watched this silent exchange with interest and replied, “They miss you both, everyone’s always asking if I’ve heard from you. They’re staying away because you asked, but it’s been six months, I can’t keep everyone at bay for forever.”</p><p class="p1">Again they communicated wordlessly, Hermione removing one of her feet from Harry’s lap and drawing it closer to her, she looked up at Ron once more who sighed.</p><p class="p1">“You’re more than welcome to stay at my place,” Harry answered them. “I’d love for you to come and see it.”</p><p class="p1">“I heard Ginny moved in,” Hermione said, this finally being the opening that she’d been waiting for all night. At the name, Harry appeared quite uncomfortable. “Is everything alright with both of you?”</p><p class="p1">“Yeah,” Harry answered shortly, unable to meet her eyes. “Anyway I’d better be getting back, I’ll need to get far enough away to apparate-“ </p><p class="p1">"Harry!” Hermione called as he stood abruptly.</p><p class="p1">“Thanks for dinner, it was good seeing you both-“</p><p class="p1">“Come on mate,” Ron said, standing up just as suddenly, leaving Hermione sitting alone on the couch. “Stay the night, it’s one hell of a journey when you’re sober.”</p><p class="p1">He looked back at them, brow furrowed.</p><p class="p1">“We don’t have to talk about Ginny if you don’t like,” Hermione promised him, straightening her long skirt that had gotten ruffled in the exchange. “Please don’t run away from us.”</p><p class="p1">Harry looked like he’d like to say something, but shut his mouth as soon as he’d opened it. “Alright then.”</p><p class="p1">Hermione smiled warmly, walking over and wrapped her arms around him. “We’ve really missed you, Harry.”</p><p class="p1">He sighed, melting into her hug and stood there for a long moment. Finally, Ron cleared his throat and Hermione winked at him, inviting him into the hug. He rolled his eyes and began clearing the table. Harry jumped apart from Hermione then, eagerly helping while Hermione went around extinguishing the lights they’d lit.</p><p class="p1">“Why don’t you get washed up?” Ron offered as she entered behind them. “I’ve got this.”</p><p class="p1">“If you insist,” she teased, setting down his and her gathered glasses and leaned over to give him a quick kiss. Hermione felt briefly in that moment as if he was claiming her, his hand moving to tangle in her hair for a moment before finally releasing her, looking breathless with a satisfied smirk.</p><p class="p1">Hermione swatted at his hip and left the room with a final wink to Harry, leaving to the small bathroom that they’d expanded into a full washroom. They don’t talk much for the rest of the night and in the morning see Harry off into the hills before returning to their home with new smiles.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">It’s another year and a half before they see Harry again. He visits, looking just as somber as before. He tells them stories of being an Auror with scars and burns to match. They tell him about their marriage in Rome over the holiday while they did nothing but dance and drink wine with some real gypsies who claimed to sense their darkness and did nothing but bless them for the week they traveled with them.</p><p class="p1">For three nights he stayed with them and the sunshine and smiles take years from his worn look. He said nothing about his life at home until their last afternoon, lounging on the lawn when he suddenly sat up straight and gave them a very sad look.</p><p class="p1">“I’m thinking about proposing,” he told them.</p><p class="p1">Ron and Hermione stare at each other, speechless. Quite under the impression that he and Ginny had broken up, as he hadn’t mentioned her or done anything to stop their advances, they find themselves with nothing kind to say. Harry smiled at them sheepishly.</p><p class="p1">“And by thinking I mean,” he paused, fumbling with something in his pocket and then produces a velvet box. Inside is a ring with a diamond as large as the nail on Hermione’s smallest finger.</p><p class="p1">“Oh, Harry-“ Hermione sighed, staring at him helplessly. She knows what she wants to say, to ask if he’s sure if it would really make him happy and why, oh why did he look so miserable? But she knows the answers to all of these questions and instead gives him a shaky smile with tears in her eyes.</p><p class="p1">Harry catches this and questions her on her look.</p><p class="p1">“It’s nothing,” Hermione whispered. They’d had such a nice week. She didn’t want to spoil it now.</p><p class="p1">“What?” Harry asked again, this time his voice is much more demanding as if challenging her. Hermione could feel the retorts at the back of his tongue. “What is it, Hermione? I’m not looking for your permission, you didn’t ask for mine.”</p><p class="p1">“It’s not that-“</p><p class="p1">“Look, not all of us can run away from our problems. We can’t all go off to a foreign country and live some half-life, trying to convince ourselves we’re happy. You haven’t fixed anything, you’re not cured, you just pretend that everything is fine. You’re not the people I grew up with. The person I knew wouldn’t be happy with this waste of a life. You want me to be happy about your marriage? Ron is the only person you’ve spoken to in years, of course, you’re going to pretend you’re married. Anyone you would have run away with you would have said yes to.”</p><p class="p1">His words bite at her and tears run down her cheeks. Unaware, she sinks into Ron’s side, trying to shield herself from his harsh words. Harry stood suddenly. “I’m glad you think you’re happy, but not all of us can pretend what happened to us didn’t.”</p><p class="p1">Hermione didn’t follow as he walked out of the home. She looked at Ron who was fuming and didn’t try to stop him as he marched after Harry. She could hear them shouting at each other even though the shut door, but doesn’t make any move to stop them. There’s the sharp crack of someone disapparating followed by deafening silence. At the sight of Ron re-entering the house the small part of her holding her together breaks and she begins to sob, rooted to the spot. She’s aware of Ron’s arm wrapping around her from behind and she begins to howl, unable even to draw a breath.</p><p class="p1">It had been years since she’d cried like this. Years since she’d felt guilt and shame over her decision. Years since she’d wished she’d never left after the war. Years since she’d mourned for a life lost.</p><p class="p1">Ron held her until she’s able to sit and then guides her to the bed, leaving behind the remnants of a happy meal and a different time. They lay there for hours as the sun sets and she can just make out his features in the blueish light of evening. There’s not much left to say.</p><p class="p1">“What did you say to him?” Hermione finally asked on the second day. They still haven’t left their bed and the dishes from their last meal crowd their sink.</p><p class="p1">Ron raised his head, staring at her. His expression seems to question what she had to gain from knowing but he answered her still. It was their pact not to keep any secrets.</p><p class="p1">“I asked why he came.” Ron answered and his lips narrow for a moment. “I asked if he wanted our encouragement or something and I told him that we weren’t just going to be here for him to run away to whenever he felt like it.”</p><p class="p1">Gently Hermione caressed his face. Ron’s face is drawn tightly still and he lets out a long breath. “It ended with me telling him that he could keep fucking my wife and I or he could fuck my sister, but he sure as hell couldn’t keep doing both.”</p><p class="p1">“Oh Ron,” she whispered. He sniffled, laying his head on her chest and though he tried to stop it, fat tears keep leaking onto her white top.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">For the next week, they stay close but don’t speak much. The shower is the only time Hermione finds herself alone, but even the short time alone she dreads. The echoes of Harry’s last words still wash over her every time she allows them. She’s grateful when Ron joins her, sitting on the toilet as he watched her brush her teeth, towel still wrapped around her wet hair.</p><p class="p1">“Are you okay?” Ron asked. It’s the first time he’s asked her since. Hermione nodded, unable to meet his eyes. “Hermione.” He whispered in a knowing voice and she turned to him for a moment before spitting out the toothpaste in her mouth.</p><p class="p1">“Do you love me?” she asked, trying to sound casual but aware of the speed of her voice.</p><p class="p1">Surprised, Ron stares at her before hurriedly answering “Yes, of course, I do Hermione.”</p><p class="p1">“I mean really, properly love me.”</p><p class="p1">“Hermione, of course, I love you, I have always loved you. Is this about what Harry said?”</p><p class="p1">Hermione felt herself nodding, forcing herself to look up at him.</p><p class="p1">“He was looking for a fight.” Ron told her seriously, “He was looking for any reason to say those things, you could have said nothing and he still would have yelled.”</p><p class="p1">“Perhaps, there’s some truth to what he said,” Hermione answered, choosing her words carefully. “We did run away Ron, we’re not the people we were.”</p><p class="p1">Ron stood up. The mixture of fear and concern in his eyes makes her want to stop talking but she forces herself to meet his gaze.</p><p class="p1">“I know you love me, Ron, it’s just, do you feel for me romantically or like you do for Harry?”</p><p class="p1">“I don’t know if Harry’s the best example.”</p><p class="p1">Hermione is unsure if he’s trying to make a joke, but she knows there’s something serious in what he says.</p><p class="p1">“Do you really love me, Ron?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or do you love me as you would someone you had to take care of all the time, someone you have to fix all the time?”</p><p class="p1">“I don’t fix you, Hermione.” He said as he stands up and stepped towards her.</p><p class="p1">“Yes, you do. You spend all of your time-“</p><p class="p1">“No, I don’t.” He interrupted, unsure of what to say next. “Come here.”</p><p class="p1">Hermione stepped toward him without thinking and he placed his hand on her shoulder and leaned down so their eyes were on the same level. “Hermione, I do not fix you. You have fixed yourself. Harry is mad because he is not apart of this because he doesn’t understand how we are actually fine. He is mad because we left and he can feel that way all he wants because we would not be okay if we had stayed.”</p><p class="p1">“I just, did we do the wrong thing? What would have happened to him if we’d stayed?”</p><p class="p1">“Broken people can’t fix broken people.” Ron reminded her. “And Hermione,” he paused and tears well up in his eyes. “You are the love of my life. My happiness comes from a life with you. I am grateful every day to wake up next to you and that you’re willing to share your life with me. I don’t ever want you to doubt how I feel for you because it is so strong it scares me. I will spend every day for the rest of my life trying to make sure you know how much I love you, for as long as you’ll have me.”</p><p class="p1">“I will always want you,” Hermione whispered, pressing her hand against his cheek. “Ronald I can’t imagine a life without you.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">It takes Harry an entire year to propose. The four of them vacation together to celebrate. Ginny’s ecstatic and tells them how much she’s missed them and begs them to come home. Easily they refuse, telling stories of their travels. She doesn’t seem to believe that they’re actually happy like somehow the disappeared shadows that still plague Harry’s eyes are the result of something else.</p><p class="p1">They spend a week in Spain, visiting the beaches and markets and then another week in France, visiting Bill and Fleur and Paris before parting. It’s not until the last night that Harry comes onto them. Ginny, exhausted, waves them off when they make plans for the night and instead it’s only the three of them, visiting a noisy pub. People keep coming over wanting to shake Harry’s hand (even now he can’t go anywhere without being recognized) but he doesn’t seem to have eyes for anyone but them. His face grew sadder and sadder as he got very drunk off of the drinks that everyone seems to be buying them, and long before closing Hermione insists on taking him home. Harry stumbled around like a child and they half carry him. Unfit to apparate they rent a room across the street and throw Harry into the bed in hopes that he’ll simply sleep it off.</p><p class="p1">He lays there obediently, insisting that Hermione lay with him. He tries something with them again and again until finally Ron, who’d steadily been growing angrier and angrier, picks him up with ease and throws him into the shower, cold water running. Harry sobers up quickly, and with tears in his eyes emerges, still sopping wet. Hermione doesn’t even offer to dry his clothes and they sit facing each other.</p><p class="p1">“Are you done?” Hermione asked scathingly as he drips onto the floor.</p><p class="p1">Harry nodded, unable to meet their eyes.</p><p class="p1">She looked to Ron who had an angry look on his face. “I thought I made myself clear, it’s us or her, you can’t have both Potter.”</p><p class="p1">Harry begins to shake so violently that Hermione worries that he was having a seizure until he looked up, tears rolling down his face.</p><p class="p1">“I don’t know why I can’t just be happy.” He told them, pulling the wet towel around his shoulders tightly. “I just-“ he sobbed again.</p><p class="p1">“Why?” Hermione asked him. “Just,” she looked to Ron. They’d never had the breakup conversation. They’d never talked about getting together either but from what little talks they had about beginning their relationship, ending it was a topic they’d never discussed. “We offered it to you, Harry. We were never the ones to end things. From the very beginning, we told you that we’d never push you away or ask you to leave. And when we left after the war we offered to take you with us and you refused so why Harry? Why do you insist on acting like we rejected you and refuse to let yourself be happy?”</p><p class="p1">“Because it’s not natural,” he muttered to them. “Think of what your family would say Ron, and they’re the only family I’ve got-“</p><p class="p1">“Fuck that Potter,” Ron snaped, “I would have thought that you’d have learned by now that if you spend your entire life living up to everyone else’s expectations that you’re going to be miserable. You know what will make you happy and we’re sitting here offering it to you. Either take it or stop making excuses.”</p><p class="p1">There’s a new sort of sadness in his eyes. But it’s overshadowed with sudden anger. He yelled at them then. About how cowardly they’d been by running away. That they have no authority to speak of his happiness when they hadn’t spent the last three years since the war had ended taking care of the mess that they’d left behind in a war-torn wizarding world.</p><p class="p1">They let him rage himself into tears, taking every small blow about them, and their choices and even their personalities until he breaks down into tears and they leave him there, having sobbed himself into sleep. Fleur is awake when they arrive and they thank her for letting them stay as they collect their things and leave without another goodbye.</p><p class="p2"> </p>
