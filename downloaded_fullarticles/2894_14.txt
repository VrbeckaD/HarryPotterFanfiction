    <p>“I know I can do a backflip,” Sirius said after taking another shot at the bar.</p><p>“Really, if you do it, then I’ll give you £8,000 for the Potter’s charity.” The man with the nice hair and pretty smile had been flirting with Sirius all night at this charity event (as if he didn’t know Sirius Black was rather serious with Gilderoy Lockhart). He was due to give a speech at any moment about Fleamont’s charity that bought gifts for unprivileged kids. It was connected to Godric’s Gifts, which was a giant gifting empire. Sirius had been working there since finishing school. James, his best mate and Monty’s son, wanted nothing to do with it. It was assumed Sirius was going to be made CEO when Monty retired sometime in the (probably near) future.</p><p>“Deal.” Sirius smiled.</p><p>He made a big show of stretching then went into a run and did a flip. Perfectly, mind you. But as he landed, he tripped over a present that was by the Christmas tree that was in the bar. He tried to control his fall but he went right into the tree. Ornaments crashed to the ground. Sirius ate a few pine needles. When he regained his equilibrium, he looked up to see about five cameras pointing at him as well as many mobiles. This was not good.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>The next day, Sirius’ name and the picture of him sitting in the wreckage of the tree was splashed across the headlines and he knew that it wasn’t going to go over well with Monty. Sirius wished he could just do the right thing when he needed to. He didn’t understand why that rebellious streak in him still ran so bloody deep. He loved the Potters and he loved the company. He wanted to do right by everyone but there was just something in him that wouldn’t let him. It was as if he constantly needed to fuck up for some reason.</p><p>“Ah, Sirius, can you come in?” Monty’s voice startled him as he had just passed by the man’s office. He thought he had got on without incident but he should have guessed Monty was lying in wait for him.</p><p>“Yes,” Sirius turned on his heel to go back towards Monty’s office where the tall man was standing with a smile on his face. That didn’t mean Sirius wasn’t in some type of trouble. Monty was always calm, cool, and collected. Even when he was angry.</p><p>They went into his office and Monty took a seat behind his desk. Sirius noticed that on top of it was the old red, gold, and green wooden box that held the Christmas letters. Those letters were started as a tradition between Monty and Albus, his partner in the company. They started them the year they began the company. Every year they traded off who wrote the letter. They were basically newsletters of their lives. This year, Monty was meant to send his letter along to Albus, who lived in Godric’s Hollow still. Both he and Monty had grown up there and lived there until Godric’s grew so big they needed to run it from London. Albus had retired two years before and went back to Godric’s.</p><p>“Sirius, I think… I think you need a reminder about what our company is about.” Fleamont leaned on the desk with his elbows.</p><p>Sirius nodded, not sure what to say.</p><p>“You know that you’re meant to be put in as CEO when I retire but I’m not sure if you’re ready.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry about last night. It was daft. The bloke said he’d give the charity money if I did a backflip and—”</p><p>“As glad as I am that it was for — charity — Sirius, I think you’re not in touch with who we are. Godric’s started in that Hollow all those years ago before you were even born. Our business is regular people in small towns like that all over the world.”</p><p>“Right.” Sirius knew their demographic, he wasn’t sure where this was all going.</p><p>“Sirius, I want you to go to Godric’s Hollow tomorrow to deliver these letters to Albus.”</p><p>“Oh, I can do that.” Sirius nodded. That was easy enough.</p><p>“I want you to do it on a few different terms.”</p><p>Sirius raised an eyebrow, “Like what?”</p><p>“Like only have £100 in your pocket, what we started the company with. I don’t want you to tell everyone that you’re — well, you’re who you are.”</p><p>“All right.”</p><p>“So, you’ll take the bus there because if you go in a car it won’t make much sense and you’ll stay at Albus’ inn there. It’s nice so it’s not as if I’m sending you to a shack somewhere. All you need to do is to give the letters to Al. You must hand deliver them, though. It’s tradition.”</p><p>Sirius agreed. It didn’t sound like too much work. It wasn’t as if he was being sent to a foreign country with a dollar in his pocket. All he needed to do was drop the letters off and that was it. He never really thought about going to Godric’s before because he loved the city. It was fine because the company did start there but he wasn’t sure what else the place would have to offer him.</p><p>Later that night he was at home packing when his boyfriend, Gilderoy came into the flat. He looked very perturbed as to why Sirius was packing. “Darling, we don’t leave for Maui until Christmas Eve.”</p><p>Sirius snickered, “I’m being sent on a little work trip to Godric’s.” He shoved a pair of socks in his bag.</p><p>Gil made an annoyed face, “You’re joking. It’s right before Christmas. Also, that’s pretty far north.”</p><p>“Well, if I do this then I might just secure the CEO position.”</p><p>Gil’s eyes went wide.</p><p>“Exactly, now shut up and hand me that scarf.” Sirius pointed behind his boyfriend. “I have to deliver Monty and Al’s letters to Al. I’ll be home in like a day. I will be back in plenty of time to make our flight to Maui.” Sirius assured Gilderoy.</p><p>Little did he know what was awaiting him.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>The bus ride was long. So bloody long. The seats were tight and not as comfortable as one would hope for when sitting on their arse for hours. Sirius was regretting his night with Gil because it just made it worse. He understood why Monty was sending him like that and not in a private car but he hated it a little. He wasn’t sure what he was supposed to learn while on a long bus ride that felt like he was suffering through.</p><p>It was late in the afternoon by the time he arrived in Godric’s Hollow. He stepped off at the bus station, which was right on the High Street, which was so typical it hurt. The street was lined with shops of all kinds. Up and down and across the street were Christmas lights. Sirius thought it was so so quaint. Which was fine but he wasn’t sure if it was for him. He was sure that it looked lovely at night with some freshly fallen snow but now it was just slushy and cold. London had no snow and Godric’s seemed to be full of it. There was another storm on the horizon. Thankfully, Sirius was going to be gone before that.</p><p>As Sirius went to reach for his luggage, a man with a Christmas tree bumped right into it. Sirius nearly broke his ankle trying to stop it sliding into the oncoming car. It was an old looking antique red car. Sirius had no interest in cars. It was probably a fancy important thing worth a lot of money but he had no idea. He only knew that his bag hit the bumper as the driver tried to come to a quick stop. His clothes ended up everywhere on the ground. Sirius groaned and swore under his breath.</p><p>“If you needed a ride somewhere, then you could have asked someone round here. They would have helped you out. You didn’t need to throw your shite in the street.” The driver said as Sirius was bending down to pick up his things.</p><p>“Someone knocked it into the street with their bleeding Christmas tree.” Sirius stood up straight again to shout at the sarcastic prick. He was going to say something else snappy but the words died on his tongue when he saw the man standing there with his hands on his hips. He was tall, taller than Sirius so that was bloody tall. He had curly light brown hair and hazel eyes. He had dimples too, which would have been nicer if he were smiling not making a judgmental face. He was still handsome, though.</p><p>“Someone knocked it into the street with a Christmas tree… that’s… what?”</p><p>“I don’t know but it happened.” Sirius went back to picking things up and the man began to help him. “Sorry if there’s any damage.”</p><p>“I’m sure it’s fine.” The driver shook his hand, shoving a handful of clothes into the bag. “So, I’m assuming you’re staying at the inn. Or are you seeing a family member?”</p><p>“Oh, er, well I’m seeing someone but at the inn. I’m staying there.” Sirius explained a bit awkwardly, standing up once the bag was properly packed.</p><p>“I’ll drive you, if you want. I work there.” The man explained. “Least I could do for running your stuff over.”</p><p>“Um, I’ll just call a taxi or uber.”</p><p>“Yeah, ah, neither of those things exist here. You must be a Londoner. I can tell by the accent…and the fact you were on the bus from London.”</p><p>“I am,” Sirius considered the man. He didn’t know how else he would get to the inn so he agreed. “Sure, I’ll take the ride.”</p><p>“Brilliant, I’m Remus Lupin by the way.”</p><p>“I’m Sir-Si Brown.” Very creative, he almost scoffed at himself. “I’m in town to see my… uncle.”</p><p>“Who’s that then?” Remus picked his bag up and went to put it into the boot of his car. “I mean, I know everyone, not exactly a big place, Godric’s.”</p><p>“Ha, it’s Albus Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Fantastic! You’re Abe’s son? Their sister? I—”</p><p>“Don’t see the resemblance, no.” Sirius said as they both got into the car. “I’m not Abe’s son, I’m not even a nephew. It was just, his family was close with mine.” Sirius attempted to explain.</p><p>“That’s nice and all but Al’s not here. He went on some nature retreat. Cabin in the sodding woods shite.” Remus scoffed as he started to drive towards the inn. “He does this stuff now that he’s retired.”</p><p>Sirius frowned, “How long is he going to be gone?”</p><p>“Don’t know, few days. I’m sure he’ll be back before Christmas Eve. He’s always excited about the holiday.” Remus explained.</p><p>Sirius hoped it was before Christmas Eve. He had a flight to catch that afternoon. Plus, he didn’t have much money to get him through five days here. He also wanted to be on a plane to Maui Christmas Eve.</p><p>It didn’t take long to get to the inn, which didn’t surprise Sirius at all. Godric’s was small but lively. There were a lot of tourists in the area because of how nice it was during the holiday season. Godric’s Gifts also did a lot for that tourism because the company talked about how important the Hollow was to them. Albus and Monty credited the fact they were so giving to how they grew up in this place. Sirius wondered if it was crap or not. He wasn’t sure but because Remus had been a bit of a snarky arsehole then turned around and offered to help him.</p><p>Hogwarts, the small inn was a big old typically English building just off the high street. It was just missing a thatched roof, Sirius considered as they pulled up. It was properly decorated for Christmas, just like the rest of the Hollow. Inside it carried the same British Holiday Christmas Winter theme. There was a tree in the entryway and the sitting room and the dining room and behind the check-in desk. Fairy lights were hung up everywhere delicately. There were Santas and reindeer and holly and fresh garland all over the place. It was rather magical.</p><p>Remus checked him in then showed Sirius up to his room. Sirius met Alice, Mary, and Caradoc who all worked around the inn as well. They welcomed him happily and seemed interested in why he was there. He hoped none of them had seen him in the gossip blogs before. He didn’t want to blow his cover. That was something Monty had emphasized. Sirius was a bit surprised at how busy the place was, all the rooms were surely taken.</p><p>Once Sirius settled, he tried to call Monty, James, and Gil but the connection was complete shite. He had no bars at all. He couldn’t even send a damn text. How do people live that way? Were they not in the twenty-first century? Godric’s Hollow was a bit like stepping back in time. He wanted to talk to Monty about the letters and ask if it were possible to leave them at the inn if Al didn’t show up tomorrow. He wanted to tell James about Godric’s. James had been born there after all. He wanted to let Gil know that he made it and might be more than a night.</p><p>A few hours later, after fighting with his phone and trying to find something to watch on the small telly in his room, Sirius’ stomach growled. He went downstairs to ask someone about room service or dinner. Behind the desk, Remus and Alice were chatting.</p><p>“Hi, Si!” Alice smiled. “What can we do for you?”</p><p>Sirius hated that he gave Si as his name. He hated when Gil would call him that as a nickname. “I was a bit hungry. Is there room service or…”</p><p>“Well, we only do breakfast.” Remus explained. “Hope’s Cafe is the next best thing. It’s just a two minute walk.”</p><p>“Where’s that?”</p><p>“I’ll show you, I was about to head over actually.”</p><p>“Oh, thank you.” Sirius nodded. “I’ll grab my coat.”</p><p>When Sirius came back downstairs, he found Remus waiting for him near the door. He had his hands in the pockets of his coat looking a bit thoughtful. They headed out without a word and went towards High Street.</p><p>“You know,” Sirius started as they took the turn on to the street. “You have no mobile service here.”</p><p>“It must be your service because mine’s fine. If you need the phone, you can use the one at the desk.” The man returned as they came upon a man with a long beard with old tattered clothes. He was playing a guitar and singing but stopped as they approached. “Hi, Moody, here you go,” Remus handed the man some money. “Hope that buys you something warm.”</p><p>“Thank you Remus.” The man, Moody, replied.</p><p>Sirius felt a bit awkward. He only had his two £50 notes and didn’t normally give to the homeless on the street. He was charitable but he never really gave that way. Remus looked at him a bit expectantly but began to walk again.</p><p>“So, don’t really like charity?”</p><p>“No! No, I love charity — even if it’s a bit selfish. I mean, we’re doing it for ourselves after all. It’s just, I don’t think giving homeless people money directly helps. Encouraging them to get jobs and all that might be better. At least that’s what my boyfriend says.”</p><p>Remus snickered, “Well, no offense, but your boyfriend sounds like a twat.”</p><p>Sometimes, Sirius couldn’t agree more with that statement but bristled a little because Remus didn’t even know Gil. “Well, I do plenty of charitable things. Not that it matters.” Like backflips after a few shots…</p><p>“Huh, okay.” Remus didn’t believe him. “Here we are.” He opened the door to the cafe with a simple sign that read: Hope’s Café.</p><p>Sirius went right up to the counter and looked at the menu. It had a mix of breakfast, lunch, and dinner things as well as bakery items and coffees. “Oh, look who’s here.” The woman behind the counter said with a smile. Sirius suddenly realized it was Remus’ mum. They had the same nose and eyes. There was also something vaguely familiar about her. “Not a place to bring your date, I would think.”</p><p>“Not my date, mum.” Remus said as if that was the last thing he could ever want in his life. “He’s here to see Al.”</p><p>“Oh, well, he’s out of town now. He’ll be back by Christmas Eve, he’d never miss the Santa Dinner.”</p><p>“What’s the Santa Dinner?” Sirius raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“We raise money for people in the town who need it.” Hope explained to him. “Remus here is in charge of it this year.” She said proudly. “You should come!”</p><p>“Er, well, I’m going to Maui for Christmas so I won’t be around.” Sirius said.</p><p>Hope’s face fell a little, “No worries, now, what can I get you?”</p><p>“Ah, what do you suggest?”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Later that night, “Well he’s cute.” Hope said with a twinkle in her eyes. Remus hadn’t seen that look in ages.</p><p>“He’s a bit off a twat.” Remus snorted, helping his mum wipe down the tables. “Something’s weird about him too.”</p><p>“He was sweet to me.”</p><p>“Probably because he has this natural charm about him but the more you talk the more you realize that he’s an arse. He wouldn’t give Moody money.”</p><p>“Well, he took out his wallet and did you notice he only had £100? There weren’t even any cards in his wallet.” Hope insisted.</p><p>“Maybe he’s trying to get money from Al.” Remus set the cloth down on the counter.</p><p>“Or maybe he’s just in a tough spot. We’ve all been there, done that.”</p><p>“Did you see how he’s dressed? He looks fresh out of some investment firm in those trousers and that shirt and jacket. He’s going to freeze in that coat of his if he plans to stay any longer.”</p><p>“Remus,” Hope began to lecture.</p><p>“I’ll stop judging, sorry.” He smiled. “I should go, I’ll see you tomorrow.” He was staying at the inn until Al came back. He hoped one day to run it on his own. Until then, he was happy to do whatever was needed.</p><p>“You know, Remus, the fact that you reject the idea of dating someone so quickly isn’t great. I thought you worked out your trust issues.”</p><p>Remus didn’t want to talk about that.</p>
