    <p>Harry peered up at the Head Table over his plateful of 'welcoming feast', scanning the occupants of the seats there for the third time. "Merlin," he muttered, "Snape's missing. You don't think he...?"</p><p>"Got the Defense post and is going to make a dramatic entrance?" Ron intuited. He was always on Harry's wavelength when it came to Snape.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, shushing them. "Professor Dumbledore's about to speak."</p><p>Even from this distance, it was easy to see the black, withered hand hanging limply at the headmaster's side. Harry had last seen Dumbledore during the Slughorn retrieval (the successful retrieval, apparently, given all that had happened on the train here). The twinkle in Dumbledore's piercing blue eyes had returned, compared to that time at least. Harry hoped it meant he was recovering.</p><p> </p><p>"...Professor Snape is on sabbatical this year, developing an optimized Wolfsbane Potion," the old wizard was saying -- Harry perked up in his seat, surprised. "Professor Horace Slughorn has generously agreed to come out of his retirement for the year and return to his place as Hogwarts' Potions Master and Head of Slytherin House. Please welcome him back to our hallowed halls."</p><p>The applause was, notably, coming primarily from the table in green. It didn't surprise Harry, per se, given how the portly wizard "collected" people. Obviously the news of his "club" had already permeated House gossip.</p><p>"Which brings us to the yet-empty position of Hogwarts' Defense professor, that you all have surely begun to wonder about. This year," Dumbledore paused for effect, "Hogwarts welcomes its first visiting professor from outside Britain in over fifty years: Professor Markus Misslich of Durmstrang Institute. <em> Doktor </em> Misslich, I believe you wished to say a few words?"</p><p>Every face in the hall turned to the wizard now rising from his seat in the middle of the table. Honey-blond, wavy hair framed the man's -- Misslich's -- round, boyish face, blue eyes peering out over the crowd. He was, Harry observed, objectively very pretty, especially when a shy blush turned his cheeks rosy. When the applause for the wizard finished, he spoke, voice musical:</p><p>"I thank you for tsis varm velcome," he began, German accent sibilant and much more polished than Karkaroff's had been. "It is mein hope that tse year vill be both educational und enjoyable for all students. I am very eager to foster talent in every one of you."</p><p>As Misslich sat down again, Harry was one of the first to applaud a second time -- he already liked Misslich, he could tell. The man had given the very opposite of Umbridge's speech from last year.</p><p><em> Maybe, </em> Harry dared to hope, <em> sixth year will work out after all. </em></p><p> </p><p>His hope only grew as the student schedules were handed out on Monday. "Defense four days out of five," Ron gaped. "He's going to run us ragged --"</p><p>"Oh!" Hermione interrupted, beaming. "It's the Durmstrang system! Viktor was telling me about this last year." She ignored Ron's mouthing 'Viktor?', waving her parchment excitedly. "There's two or three days of lecture and one or two days of demonstration -- I think -- it's going to be great," she insisted, "you'll like it, Ron, there's very little homework --"</p><p>That had the redhead's attention. Harry scanned his schedule again while his friends' conversation devolved into bickering over the value of homework. Misslich had scheduled afternoon lessons on Mondays and Tuesdays, three out of four time blocks on Wednesdays, and one morning session on Thursdays -- leaving Fridays through Sundays empty. Today, being Monday, was an afternooner.</p><p><em> Intensive Defense. </em> Honestly, Harry couldn't wait.</p><p> </p><p>The Defense classroom had been moved to a third-floor area Harry was quite sure had previously held the Cerberus -- it was huge, and seats were arranged around the room like a massive lecture hall. Harry realized, taking a seat in the front, that he might possibly be excited to learn, just a little bit.</p><p>He was surprised when the other students began to file in -- not just Gryffindors and Slytherins, but Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs too. They spread out in cliques around the room; besides him and Hermione, nobody else dared sit in the very first row. Chatter among the sixth-years cut off abruptly as their professor glided into the room in tight-fitting white robes, taking up a position on the raised section of floor where a podium might have been, were anyone else teaching the class.</p><p>Misslich smiled at them all, brightening the room with a wandless gesture.</p><p>"So," he spoke, at a conversational volume that nonetheless reached them all clearly, <em>"mein</em> sixth-year students. Today I will get to know you, hm? <em> Aber </em> first, you should know <em> me." </em></p><p>He swept his arms out, looking, for all his golden hair and white robes and wide-eyed expression, like a Muggle angel. "<em> Ich heisse </em> Markus Misslich, Department Chair of Magical Theory and Co-Chair of Applied Magic at Durmstrang Institute. I am spending this year on sabbatical, much like your professor...Snape, was it?" A few students nodded.</p><p>"My specialty und research focus lies in the world's most obscure, most dangerous magics; Britannia simply calls them 'dark arts', but there is a broad range of spells in that category which I will cover this <em> jahr." </em></p><p>Misslich began conjuring spheres of colored light from his palms which grew larger as they floated overhead. "Temporary to permanent," he listed, calling up light and dark blue spheres; "weak to strong," pale pink to bright red, "stable to unstable," orange to yellow, "harmless to fatal." Dark green to the bright green of the Killing Curse.</p><p>"Much of magic, by British definitions, is dark; I will not pretend to believe it should all be hidden away like some Britons do. <em> However!" </em> The sharpness in his tone made Harry and most everyone else flinch, simultaneously cutting off any student commentary on the rather political statement he'd just made. Harry found himself at the edge of his seat, leaning forward to listen -- and he was not the only one.</p><p>"As with any dangerous tsing, common sense und basic safety are paramount. We vill explore many dangerous things in zis room, <em> ja? </em> You need not fear them."</p><p>Hermione put her hand in the air, expression perturbed. "Professor Misslich," she asked, "aren't dark arts banned for a reason?"</p><p>Misslich made a thoughtful gesture, peering at her. "Ah, I see, I see. I forget that Britannia teaches such views to its students. It is a valid concern, do not misunderstand," he placated, "but you need not vorry. I am much unlike those professors of zis subject who came before me -- indeed I shall demonstrate mein ability in advance. <em> Achtung! </em> Observe!"</p><p>He drew his wand from his sleeve and spun several circles in the air over his head. On the sixth or seventh rotation, the end of the wand erupted in a great gout of flame -- burning every color of the rainbow -- that began to take the shapes of shifting animals.</p><p>"Zis," Misslich proclaimed, "is Fiendfyre!" Students gasped, some flinching back; a few were, by the sound of it, getting out of their seats to run. "Your Ministry claims it is uncontrollable. They are mistaken. It is only very difficult."</p><p>He gestured sharply with his wand, and the hellhounds and tigers and wolves and dragons, their teeth snapping inches from Harry's nose -- in the heat of their proximity, sweat had beaded on his temples and trailed down the side of his face -- pulled back, consolidating into a bright blue-white orb on the end of Misslich's wand. As everyone blinked away the spots in their vision, the orb cooled down to yellow, then orange, then red, until it had finally faded to nothing. Only a lingering scent of ozone filled the air in its wake to show it had ever been.</p><p>Misslich returned his wand to his sleeve while the class sat, stunned, at the display. "If you are impressed," the wizard murmured, "do not be -- <em> more than half of you can learn to do the same through practice!" </em> He gestured dramatically, sparks flying from outstretched fingertips. "Tsis is only <em> one </em> example of the talent I might foster in you, students.</p><p>"And now, having seen what I can do," Misslich's expression shifted into a genial smile, "all of you -- show me what <em> you </em> can do! Your favorite magic. Your best magic. We will have duelling in my classes once veekly; today, I call for demonstration."</p><p>A warm breeze swept through the room, overturning parchment and closing books. Misslich laughed, a charming, bell-like sound, and pointed to the students in the back row. "No notes now. Each of you," he called, "to the front here -- tell us your favorite magic, and demonstrate what you are best at! Und," he winked, "if you suspect your classmates do not recognize you after a summer away, your name, hm?"</p><p>It was odd for Harry to realize that he really didn't recognize a lot of the students outside of Gryffindor and Slytherin. Many Ravenclaws in the middle seats, Harry couldn't recall having once met, even.</p><p>And had there always been so many kinds of magic? Illusions, art spells, protective amulets, a potion for liquid luck; one Ravenclaw adored the enchantments believed to be on the House founder's lost diadem and was working to replicate them. Misslich had not specified that their favorite magic had to be cast with wands, after all.</p><p>Harry felt a surge of pride, too, whenever anyone chose the Patronus as their best spell. DA members, the lot of them; they would glance in his direction as if seeking his approval.</p><p>Then, it was Harry's turn to stand, Hermione at his side. They were the last two.</p><p>"My favorite magic," declared Hermione, "is the wardwork powering the Hogwarts library. In Ancient Runes, we've been examining the arrays -- it's terribly complex, and works in perfect harmony despite centuries of additions and changes from later librarians --" she paused, realizing she'd begun to monologue. "My best spell," Harry's friend continued after a beat, "is the Undetectable Expansion Charm." To demonstrate, she promptly turned out one pocket of her robes -- to reveal no less than ten textbooks, two inkwells, and a bag of Kneazle treats, blushing at the applause that drew from the Ravenclaws in particular.</p><p>Then she returned to her seat, and there was just Harry.</p><p>"My favorite magic," he hesitated, "is blood magic." Before anyone could comment, he hastily added, "it's how my mum protected me -- I'm not <em> doing </em> blood magic!" Merlin, that would have been an awful rumor. "My best magic is probably the Patronus too. I drove off a whole swarm of dementors, once." Without much thought, he cast the spell, and let the stag gallop a circuit around the room.</p><p>Misslich nodded, gesturing to Harry to return to his seat. "<em> Sehr gut, </em> all of you," the professor exclaimed. "We will begin discussing magical theory tomorrow. For now, you are all dismissed -- und yes, I know it is earlier than scheduled. Perhaps you will find time to ask each other about the spells you have in common?" He snapped his fingers and the lights in the classroom dimmed to normal. Students began to pack their satchels, murmuring amongst themselves and casting glances at each other as if they meant to take Misslich's advice. Harry was just lifting his satchel onto his shoulder when Professor MIsslich approached his desk. "Mister Potter, Miss Granger," he greeted in turn, "ein excellent closing performance today." A smile to Hermione, who smiled sheepishly back.</p><p>"Ach, I digress. Mister Potter, please remain behind a moment."</p><p>Hermione nodded, stepping toward the door. "See you in the Tower," she said to Harry, which meant she would wait for him in the library instead, and made her way out of the classroom.</p><p>Now it was just Harry and Misslich in the room. "Walk vith me to my office, Mr. Potter?" Misslich waited for Harry to fall in step before setting a leisurely pace down the hall, stopping at a hidden passageway Harry had sometimes used in the past. The one-floor descent took less than a minute; very shortly, they were crossing the threshold into Misslich's office.</p><p>It was indeed the same office granted to each Defense professor, over the years, and Harry had seen some rather nauseating decorations in the room before (Lockhart and Umbridge came to mind), but there were no kitten plates or pink wallpapers now. Misslich had a fire lit in the fireplace, a wall of bookshelves surrounding the mantel, and two large leather armchairs facing each other across a low, round table. His desk was already piled high with books, scrolls and parchment. And in one corner, Harry was surprised to spot a polished gramophone on a small table with what looked like vinyl records on a shelf underneath. It was <em> cozy, </em> and felt very much like a professor's office ought to, he thought.</p><p>"Please, have a seat," said Misslich, crossing the room to a large wooden cabinet on a far wall. Ever cautious, Harry took the chair closer to the door, the better to watch Misslich from as well. He wasn't sure what to expect from the German wizard just yet, and what Misslich retrieved from the cabinet only confused him more.</p><p>"Biscuits, Mr. Potter?" he asked, setting the dish of them on the table. A tea set appeared beside it moments later, courtesy of Hogwarts house-elves, no doubt. Having had previous experiences with tea in this office of varying pleasantness, Harry took a teacup, and a biscuit, but did not partake, for the moment.</p><p>"Er, you can call me Harry, sir," he thought to say, feeling awkward.</p><p>Misslich only smiled that sunshiney smile at him again, sipping his tea. "As you wish, Harry. I vould like to assuage any worries about being called here on ze first day -- I merely vished to speak with you before the term truly begins."</p><p>Harry nodded. "All right."</p><p>"Ah! It is not because of your fame," Misslich hastened to add. He seemed almost flustered.</p><p><em> If not that, then what? </em> Harry wondered, but did not ask. Fortunately, the professor answered that question in his next sentence.</p><p>"Vhen I arrived for tsis year, Albus informed me of your defense club from last year -- und it is quite <em> klar </em> which students benefitted from your help, ja?" Misslich sipped his tea again. "As I said -- it is mein goal to foster talent in all students, including you, Harry."</p><p>"...Sir?"</p><p>Misslich set his teacup down, leaning forward in his chair. "It is <em> sehr </em> important to me tsat mein brightest students are not held back by the rest. Hogwarts is not large enough to justify a gifted students program, you understand? Und so I vill be available always for extracurricular study and practice."</p><p>Was Misslich saying Harry was...talented? He averted his eyes to the floor, embarrassed. "If you want talented students, Professor, my friend Hermione is a lot more qualified than I am --"</p><p>The wizard laughed a little laugh, just as melodic as the one from before. "Make no mistake, Harry, I <em> will </em> be giving this advice to Miss Granger and plenty of others as the term progresses. But you are mistaken to consider yourself untalented. We faculty do discuss students, from time to time, und it is unanimous that Defense is your best subject. You do enjoy it, do you not?" Harry looked up to meet his blue gaze, finding Misslich honestly curious, eyebrows raised.</p><p>"Well, yeah," Harry admitted, "I guess I do."</p><p>Misslich reached out to pat him on the shoulder, very lightly, telegraphing the motion as he went like he thought Harry might cringe away from the touch. "Und tsat is all you need, to begin with."</p><p>Just then, the bell rang to mark the end of the class period. Misslich sat back in his chair, summoning his teacup and another biscuit off the table again. "Please consider the opportunity for extra practice, Harry," he said, expression now solemn over his teacup. "Tsere is no time limit on such an offer, but the earlier the better, that we might set a regular time for it. For now, you may remain here as long as you like, hm?" Another, brief smile, and when Harry was not forthcoming with a reply, Misslich merely nodded, summoning a scroll into his free hand to read while he took his tea.</p><p>Mysteriously, now that he knew he was free to leave, Harry supposed, <em> I might as well stay for the rest of this tea. </em></p><p>He took a sip.</p><p>It was delicious.</p><p> </p><p>When Harry arrived at the library about twenty minutes later, Hermione was waiting for him in her usual spot. "So, what did Misslich want to talk to you about?" she asked, eyes bright. "Is it another Umbridge situation? Or worse, a Lockhart?"</p><p>"More like a Lupin," Harry admitted, pensive. "We had tea and biscuits and he offered me extra lessons to practice if I wanted. I haven't decided yet."</p><p>"Is it," Hermione spoke in an undertone, "to do with 'keeping order'?"</p><p>Harry shook his head, peering at the titles of the books stacked by her left elbow. "Doesn't seem like it. He just seems like he wants to help." Harry's lips quirked in a smile. "What a scandal: 'school teacher actually cares about students.'"</p><p>Hermione's bark of a laugh got them shushed by Madam Pince. They shared a grin, before packing up and heading down to the Great Hall after all.</p><p>As Ron and Hermione fell into their routine of bickering, which Harry dutifully tuned out, he picked at his food and let his mind wander back to the comfortable silence that had fallen over the professor’s office in the last few minutes. He wondered what tomorrow’s lecture would be like.</p>
