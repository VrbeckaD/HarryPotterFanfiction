    <p>
  <em>
    <span>There were few things in the world that brought Credence true joy. One of those things was Mr Graves.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Credence had come to know the price of Mr Graves’ kindness to be a small thing. All it took was letting the older man rut against him as they kissed and Credence would be fed, healed, and treated with kindness. What did it matter if that made him a sinner, impure in the eyes of God?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Usually, Mr Graves was able to bring him home before dark, but tonight Credence had to make his own way home. His mother would be furious, but Mary Lou’s wrath seemed distant.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>That was because Credence was light-hearted and giddy from his time spent with Mr Graves. The second he walked through the door, he changed his mind.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Credence woke from his dream right before it became a nightmare. That night had been the worst beating of his life, as well as his last. He remembered clutching the pendant that Mr Graves had given him like a holy man would cling to his cross, pleading and begging.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mr Graves hadn’t failed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That was also when Credence learned the truth about his lover. When Mr Graves arrived, Credence’s fear didn’t leave him. Mr Graves' true form was monstrous, with skin and hair like snow, glowing white eyes, and scars criss-crossing his face. When the monster (for Credence could no longer think of him as Mr Graves) revealed his powers, killing Credence’s mother and sister, the fear only grew worse.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Credence must have blacked out after that, because the next thing he knew, he was in Mr Graves’ apartment, tucked into bed. Mr Graves, back as himself, was sat on the loveseat at the foot of the bed, waiting for Credence to wake up.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Then, he explained everything. He was a vampire, hundreds of years old, and the pendant he’d given Credence was what connected them. That was why he was to carry it with him at all times. In case something like this happened.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Once he overcame the initial shock of what had happened, Credence understood why Mr Graves had killed his mother. In fact, he was grateful that she was dead. He didn’t have to fear her anymore. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span></span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Things moved quickly after that. Mr Graves told Credence that they had to leave New York and flee to his home up North. It was a long trip, but they would be safe there.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That was where Credence woke up. He was still in Mr Graves’ car, having fallen asleep in the passenger seat. He was woken by the trunk having slammed shut, and moments later, Mr Graves poked his head through the window.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re awake,” Mr Graves said, his deep, gravelly voice sending shivers down Credence’s spine. He took a moment to open the passenger door, helping Credence out of the car. Credence was grateful for it, since his legs were still wobbly from sleeping. It must not have bothered Mr Graves too much either, since only one hand was full. He’d only brought one suitcase.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That didn’t worry Credence at all, because Mr Graves’ “home” was, in reality, a mansion.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The massive house took up most of the property, crowded against the wrought iron fence. The darkly-colored Victorian home towered above them, and the points of its spired roofs seemed to pierce the stars. The windows were dark, and grotesque gargoyles grinned down at them from where they sat. The mansion made Credence uneasy, but at the same time, was the most beautiful building he’d ever seen.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You live here?” Credence blurted out. It seemed like a castle, and the idea of any modern human being living there was outlandish. Especially coming from Credence, who’s room back at the church might as well have been a cardboard box compared to this.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mr Graves chuckled. “Yes,” he replied, offering his arm to Credence, who gladly took it. They strode along the cobbled path that led to the building, which seemed to grow even larger as they approached. “So do you, now.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Credence took a minute to process that. He lived here, with Mr Graves, free from his abusive home. It was like he’d stepped out of hell and right into paradise.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He didn’t make a sound, as they stepped inside, but his smile said enough.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Percival led the boy up the stairs, pleased with the wide-eyed looks and little gasps of wonder as Credence observed his home. The boy jumped in surprise when the lights came on automatically, which Percival found especially amusing. It was all very simple magic, but Credence’s amazement was cute.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Percival keep a hand on Credence’s arm, steering him down the corridor and  towards the bedroom. He’d been preparing it ever since they’d met months ago, and couldn’t help but feel excited about finally having Credence live in it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The boy’s reaction was more than what was expected, in the best possible way. The room itself was blue and white, with a comfortable four-poster bed. A cushy loveseat faced the fireplace. On the right wall, pressed against the window, was a computer desk, and on the opposite wall, a bookcase, dresser, and mirror. Right next to the bed, elegantly carved and painted the color of ivory, was an empty cradle.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Credence looked over it for now. Percival was thankful for it; he had to hurry away and take care of business before the sun rose, and didn’t have time to answer Credence’s questions. Later, when he returned.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Percival watched with a smile on his face as the boy walked around the room in an awed daze. The room was soft and comfortable, almost three times the size of Credence’s old bedroom and tailored to his every need. Graves was glad the boy appreciated his work.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you think?” he asked, already knowing the answer.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s beautiful,” Credence replied, turning to look back at Percival with wide, doe-like eyes. “This whole room is for me?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes.” Percival’s smile only grew warmer, and he stepped forward, reaching out to cup Credence’s chin--</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Credence’s reaction took him by surprise. His wide eyes suddenly grew fearful, and his body moved backwards as though with a mind of its own. Percival froze in his tracks, watching as Credence immediately started to fret.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I-I’m sorry--” Credence said, with the tone of someone who was begging not to be hit. “I-I-I--”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hush.” As he said it, Percival’s eyes glowed white. He used his powers to command the boy into being calm, making his own voice soft and reassuring. He watched, satisfied with Credence’s slumped shoulders and relaxed muscles. Still, he didn’t come closer. “It’s alright. I have business to attend to. Don’t leave this room until I come back.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Credence nodded, and Percival turned, breaking the contact. Credence wouldn’t be alone for long. Percival wouldn’t leave him at all after what had transpired, if only his business wasn’t so pressing.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He left the mansion, eyes turning towards the moon as it crept lower through the sky. He had plans for Credence. The boy was of more courage and strength than he let himself know, and Percival planned to unlock that. It would take time and work -- much more after what Percival had done to the boy’s family -- but it would all be worth it. Credence’s potential would be recognized.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was going to make an excellent vampire.</span>
