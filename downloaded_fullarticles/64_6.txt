    <em>
      <b>Brave New World</b>
    </em>
  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Much had changed since Gellert Grindelwald had emerged victorious from his duel with Albus Dumbledore. The Dark Lord had won and showed no mercy to those who had dared to openly defy him. However, although he was merciless, he was also quite clever. Grindelwald had changed his strategy and secured an alliance with the British Queen. Nothing would ever be the same again.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Of course, sacrifices had to be made. The first one had been the Statute of Secrecy. The British World and Commonwealth finally learned of the existence of the Magicals in their midst. This time, nobody would be able to force them into hiding.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>A new treaty had been made and enforced on all societies and nations at a time when they had been too tired and weary after the end of World War II to fight again. The treaty required a drop blood from everyone and a vow that magical beings were sacred and had a right to live as they saw fit. All citizens </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> no matter their nationality, would be bound by blood in accordance with the new laws. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The British Magical world had been handed over to Grindelwald and his cronies on a silver platter to run as they saw fit. All it took was for Grindelwald to make a vow on his life and magic </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> that he and his followers would leave the muggles alone. But again, he could reign over every magical citizen according to his own wishes. He decided that, since there was no longer a secrecy law, Magical Beings would need to be protected and therefore new laws had been created.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>One of laws stated that all magical children had to be registered at birth in both societies, and that no muggle, also known as ‘no-maj’, would ever be able to get custody of a magical child. Should the child be in an environment where he or she was being abused or neglected in any way, then the child would be removed from that environment and be placed under magical guardianship, until it was time for the child to go to one of the magical schools.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The views on the social status of muggleborns and half-bloods changed drastically. Make no mistake, they like everyone else had a right to a magical education, but there were many reforms put in place. The first one was that both muggleborns and half-bloods were considered ‘pets’, as soon as they were old enough to start their magical education. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>All pets should be loyal to their owners and to the Magical culture. The prospective owner would be carefully chosen from a loyal pureblood family, and anyone caught mistreating his or her pet would be harshly punished by immediately losing their owner status, then they would be demoted to pet status and be handed over to one of the Auror brothels that had been built in Knockturn Alley. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Blood </span>
  <span>T</span>
  <span>raitors were not allowed to own a pet even though they hailed from pureblood lines. Blood Traitors would be put on probation or, depending on the circumstances, could be demoted to pet status and had rules to follow that were far more strict than the rules followed by regular pets. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>What happened to Andromeda Tonks was good lesson for anyone who was thinking of breaking the laws of society. Andromeda was a blood traitor, who had broken their laws by running off with and marrying a muggleborn pet who belonged to another pureblood. Not only was this action illegal, she was not even allowed to own a pet because she had failed the necessary courses to qualify for one of her own. A third charge against her was that when she ran off with the muggleborn pet, she broke her existing marriage contract with Rodolphus Lestrange, which was another very serious violation in their society. Due to these breaches in protocol, in addition to having been a negative influence on her younger cousins and showing no remorse whatsoever, she had been faced with the true force of the law. Her only saving grace and the one thing that kept her from being demoted to ‘pet’ status was the child that resulted from her unlawful mating with the muggleborn Ted Tonks. Nymphadora had been born a Metamorphmagus, which was a highly prized skill in their society. Regardless of that extremely good fortune, punishment was due, and punishment would be served.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Andromeda had been immobilised and forced to watch her brilliant Ted get tortured and cursed for hours until they finally used blood magic to bind him as a breeding slave to the Noble and Ancient House of Black. As a breeding slave, he was permitted to pleasure Andromeda sexually on a set schedule, but otherwise he was not allowed to be near his family ever again.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The intelligence in his eyes had been vanquished, and he only looked dully around, unable to speak, as the slave collar prevented it. The master of his collar had been her Aunt Walburga. Andromeda had cried for hours after learning this information.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Andromeda had faced her own punishment </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> nothing that could affect her fertility, but while she was not demoted to pet status, she had still been bound in slavery to her own family. She became the new family healer, who was unable to speak about anything she had seen happen in her family. And she lost her little baby to their head of house. Lord Arcturus Black would raise the baby, after a specialised blood adoption ceremony would remove the filthy blood from her veins. Instead of being a half-blood and therefore endangered by the new regime that now ruled their lives, this action would serve Nymphadora well as she would now be known and raised as a pureblood witch.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Other than Nymphadora, only one other prominent member of their society had been forced to undergo the blood ritual, and that was Tom Marvolo Riddle Jr. - current Headmaster of Hogwarts since the 1</span>
  <span>st</span>
  <span> of September 1960 – after Gellert Grindelwald had saved him and his mother Merope.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Gellert had been travelling through Britain in the late summer of 1926 when he encountered the pregnant Merope Riddle née Gaunt. She had been kicked out by her husband </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> Tom Riddle </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> a muggle and the son of the wealthiest man in Little Hangleton. Even though their marriage had been proven valid and she carried his heir, to Tom it didn’t matter. He didn’t care and claimed that ‘the chit’ had given him a love potion and stated that, that was the only reason he married her.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>This was a blatant lie. The truth was that Merope’s family had successfully cowed him into submission and got his agreement in a written contract </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> signed with his own blood, that he would marry Merope, honour her and always take good care of her and all their future children. When Morfin and Marvolo had caught Tom violating Merope near their home, Marvolo’s magic had lashed out and immobilised the brash muggle fool.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Due to the circumstances, they really hadn’t given Riddle a choice other than marry Merope or be killed on the spot by her enraged family. Tom Riddle had been such a coward that he chose marriage, and signed their contract, fearing for his life. Morfin and Marvolo knew that that after having her virginity stolen, not being a natural beauty in the first place, and being only a weak witch </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <b> </b>
  <span>well, it was likely that nobody in the magical community would be willing to marry her. It was certain that no other purebloods would want a bride who had already been defiled and was with child.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The contract stated, that the couple had to immediately leave home and travel to London to stay until their child was born. Also, no contact with Tom’s relatives was allowed. The muggle broke his word shortly after they reached London and found a comfortable flat in Whitechapel.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Riddle tried everything he could to ensure that Merope would lose her baby, but her magic protected them against the physical abuse. In the end, he kicked a pregnant Merope out of the flat and went to the docks and the bars to hire a few thugs in hopes of ridding himself of his unwanted family.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Gellert had intervened in the murder attempt, saving mother and her unborn child on the 21</span>
  <span>st</span>
  <span> of December 1926, while brutally killing the hired thugs. Gellert recognised her locket and got the truth from the shy and terrified young girl. After hearing all that she had been through, he offered her a deal. After dealing with her scum of a husband, he would bond with Merope according to the Old Ways and adopt the boy with one of the ancient blood adoption rituals. Merope agreed, and after getting a new wardrobe, she was secured on an estate that belonged to one of Gellert’s British allies.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The attack had ensured that labour set in quite early, and as a result, Gellert had been very happy to have Merope under the watchful eyes of experienced house elves along with a family who had been healers for generations. Luckily the birthing process was free of any complications and a healthy baby wizard was delivered on the same day.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>None of those present even batted an eye. They all treated Merope, who had been trained in pureblood etiquette and history, with the necessary politeness. On the 21</span>
  <span>st</span>
  <span> of December 1926 her son Thomas Marvolo Riddle Jr. had been born and she couldn’t be happier. The child had been named after the Saint and not his ungrateful sire. Gellert had proposed to Merope in front of his close circle of friends and blood adopted Tom a few days later, while blessing his heir. Luckily even though baby Tom was a pureblood now, he retained the Parselmouth abilities of his infamous ancestor along with his naturally strong magic that if anything had been enhanced by the adoption ceremony.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Although it was early yet, Gellert was thinking of his son’s future education. He knew that his son’s name would be in the Book to attend Hogwarts when he was 11 years old, but Gellert no longer trusted his so-called friend Albus Dumbledore, who was Hogwarts’ current Headmaster any longer. This had nothing to do with the death of Albus’ sister, Ariana. The death of Ariana had been a tragic accident. It was likely that the British Ministry of Magic would have killed the young woman sooner or later after learning that she was an Obscurial. No, he didn’t trust Dumbledore, because he knew that Dumbledore was a master manipulator and was not the friendly person he tried to portray to the people. Therefore, Gellert had no intention of letting his son attend Hogwarts while Dumbledore was still breathing.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Gellert challenged Dumbledore to a duel in the Forest of Dean on the 14</span>
  <span>th</span>
  <span> of February 1930 </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> the victor would get the legendary Elder Wand, also known as the Death Stick. Gellert had remembered only too well how obsessed Albus had been with this fairy tale associated with the powerful wand.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The duel had been vicious, but in the end, Dumbledore was not a true match for Gellert, who hadn’t even bothered to fight with the Death Stick and instead used a custom-made wand, that he had bought in Russia from the wand maker Gregorovich.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Those allied with Albus had been declared blood traitors and been viciously hunted and rounded up. The Potters and Weasleys had foolishly followed him which led to their downfall and to the declaration that although any offspring would be allowed to attend Hogwarts, their status would not be the same as that of the other purebloods. They would be classified as pets along with the other half-bloods and muggleborns.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>In certain old circles, the muggleborns had been commonly known as </span>
  <span>
    <em>
      <b>muds</b>
    </em>
  </span>
  <span>, and</span>
  <b> </b>
  <span>any muggleborn who after attending Hogwarts wished or tried to leave the Magical World, got captured by snatchers and taken in to one of the hidden re-education bases for a special training. They could be kept for three-five years without any contact with their families and friends. Anyone who still did not learn from their mistakes and persisted in their desire to leave Magical Britain was forced to drink a potion that reduced them to mere squibs. This did not result in freedom, it resulted in the newly made squib being enslaved at one of the numerous squib brothels in Magical Britain.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Those who fell under that category had been marked with different symbols. The first symbol was for the owner that they had tried to escape, the second for the brothel they now served and a third one marked them as a runaway. The best of those that worked the brothels were usually those who had been born as squibs. They had been trained early in the sexual arts, usually as lust or breeding slaves.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Raising and teaching one’s pet was one of the most important duties for any magical family. Usually very strong bonds would be evoked between both parties, and quite often marriage was the popular choice at the maturity of the pet. After seven years of teaching one’s pet, most owners would not want to lose them.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Even after ownership status had been confirmed, no penetrative sex could take place before the pet turned 16 years old. However, there were many ways, other than penetration, to ensure that one’s pet was ready for consummating their bond.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>On their first night at Hogwarts </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> all new pets would be sorted into their houses, after which their new owners would be assigned and loudly proclaimed in the Great Hall. Only staff members, or one of the older students in years 5-7 were permitted to own a pet. These people could own </span>
  <span>
    <b>1 pet only </b>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>— </span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>although it was quite usual that betrothed couples shared and taught their pet together.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The pet’s magical family and their owner’s family crest would be displayed on the pet’s collar. For example, if a half-blood pet that was originally from the House of Prince was chosen for the Malfoy family, that pet would have three crests on his or her collar </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> Black, Malfoy and Prince </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <b> </b>
  <span>along with a symbol for the pet’s blood status.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>It was important to teach one’s pet rules, which they had to obey. Any owner could add more rules for their pet to follow in addition to the school rules, but even then, there were limits. Punishments were limited to groundings and spankings. Spankings were to be administered either by hand or by using a disciplinary tool (cane, paddle, hairbrush, etc.) usually on the naked backside of the pet. Owners were not allowed to administer more swats than the current age of the pet and aftercare was considered a most important part of discipline to prevent long-term damage.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>All pureblood students were required to participate in a special course called ‘Pet Training’, during the first four years of their magical education. Only after the instructors deemed a person suitable and mature enough, would they be allowed to apply for a pet.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>A list of the names and blood statuses of the future students hung in all four common rooms. Therefore, it was not uncommon that a potential owner, along with their chaperone, would secretly visit their future intended pet for an introduction </span>

  <span>Lucius Malfoy, Tom’s godson was not able to sleep. This year, he would be getting his own pet, and even though he would have to share the delightful creature with his betrothed Narcissa, the Malfoy heir could not wait. Unlike others, he knew exactly who would be his </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>— </span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span>Severus Prince-Snape, the son of the blood traitor Eileen Snape née Prince.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Severus had been living in Cokeworth with his parents, and there had been rumours about abusive and neglectful behaviour towards the sole magical child in the household by Severus’ own parents. Nothing was ever able to be proven but still </span>
  <span>— </span>
  <span>Lucius had already applied for a special license that would allow his future pet to live with him during the holidays.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Under the usage of a strong glamour Lucius and his godfather had visited his future pet in Cokeworth during the last few summers, and the Malfoy heir had been appalled at his discoveries. The worst was the muggleborn witch who lived near Severus. She could become a danger to his bond with his future pet if Lucius wasn’t careful. No, he would quickly nip this in the bud, ensuring that Severus would forget her and be very eager to become a good little pet for his new Master.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Today he would buy the last items he would need for the education and the training of young Severus. Lucius was in an excellent mood. This was because the first magical physical after Severus had been born, had shown that Severus had inherited the rare male pregnancy gene, that was quite common in the Prince family line. His little Prince would be able to bear him children without needing a special potion or a spell to trigger a magical pregnancy. It was perfect, and soon he would ensure that Severus would be happy to serve him in any capacity while only Lucius, and later Narcissa, would be watching his total submission to their orders.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The teenager was counting the days until the 1</span>
  <span>st</span>
  <span> of September 1971, especially since he had promised his godfather and his parents, that he would not return to Cokeworth during the next four weeks. It was hard, but sacrifices had to be made, and in the end the enforced waiting would make their first meeting so much sweeter.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>As soon as his little prince knelt in front of the dais, with his eyes directed submissively on the floor after the Sorting Hat called out the House his pet would be joining, Lucius would step behind him, collar in his hand and part Severus’ hair so that he could collar him. Lucius would then steal his first kiss in front of the whole school, as was tradition.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Perhaps he would ask Narcissa to lend him a hand as she would be his equal partner in raising their pet together, and she would be the only one, besides Lucius, who would be allowed to kiss their little prince.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Lucius had to hide a laugh as he remembered what his Uncle Tom told him. He mentioned that James Potter </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> the obnoxious brat of those blood traitors, should be handed over to Bellatrix and Rodolphus. Yes, they would teach him to obey or he would face the consequences. And Sirius Black </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> oh, he remembered just too well how loudly Walburga Black had groaned over her oldest son </span>
  <span>
    <span>
      <span>—</span>
    </span>
  </span>
  <span> who was a true disgrace to their noble family.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>It seemed that Andromeda had quite successfully poisoned his mind, and therefore Lord Black had been forced to use an old and rarely used by-law to hand Sirius’ schooling and discipline over to the Headmaster. He would be a mix of pet and delinquent. However, Lucius was certain that his godfather would be able to guide Sirius Black back onto the correct path.</span>
