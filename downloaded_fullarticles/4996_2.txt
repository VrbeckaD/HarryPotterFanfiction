    <p>Chapter 1: Prologue<br/>A story where Harry Potter possesses a few girls. With possess I mean that he can feel, hear, smell, taste and watch through the bodies of the ladies he possesses. He can control them either. Also does he control his normal body the same as always.</p>
<p>'One of the girls speaking to Harry in his mind'</p>

<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Harry wakes up in his bedroom at Privet Drive number 4 on the 31st day of the ninth month at exactly 7 o'clock in the morning. It's the day before the new school year starts. Harry is going to begin on his fifth year and hopes for a year without visits to Madame Pomfrey, even though he loves her like a mother. But seriously! He is spending WAY too much time in the hospital wing. He get to see his classmates again and meet his best friends again. Also, Harry is trying to get some girls notice him for his looks instead of his fame. There are some pretty girls in Hogwars. You have Susan Bones from Hufflepuff, with her large chest, you have Daphne Greengrass from Slyterin, with her nice platinum blonde hair and Katie Bell from Griffendor, with her large rear. He is just missing something right now, He doesn't know how he is going to leave from here, because Dumbledore saw it fit to just let him starve this summer without contact to one of his friends. Hedwig also didn't came back after he send her to Ron, so he guessed that she is still that moment there was a large, resounding crack heard across Privet Drive. When Harry looks out of the window he saw someone he was VERY VERY VERY angry with. Guess who?</p>
<p>Right, Dumbledore. He still didn't forgive the man for withholding the propercy about him which he gave him at the end of last school year. Harry thinks that Dumbledore deserved the blown office, seeing as then Dumbledore has something else to do but playing with his emotions and guilt about Sirius. Sirius... He would have wanted me to make a big party and find lots and lots of girls... thought Harry.</p>
<p>Time skip</p>
<p>A little before 10 AM</p>
<p>1 September 1996</p>
<p>Kings Cross Station</p>
<p>The platform between track 9 and 10</p>
<p>Harry has the a-ma-zing idea to go there on his own with the help of the Knight Bus. He is SO nauseous, he has to throw up. Lucky there are toilets nearby, so he runs there with his hand before his mouth. As he is done throwing up and got to platform 9 3/4, he saw someone who he was fantasizing about a few weeks ago, namely Susan Bones with her aunt saying goodbye. As he regonised her from the DA What a stupid name, Dumbledore's army. Many we should change it to Defence Association. He greeted her and then asked if she would like to sit with him in a compartment. When she said yes and goes in with him, she suddenly kissed him full on the lips. If Harry and Susan looked around them they could have seen the amazing bright red-green aura surrounding them, but alas, they did not. While this all happened Harry and Susan were happily kissing, now with their mouths slightly open and really enjoying it. But, all good things must come to an end. When Harry opened his eyes again, he saw Susan, but also himself through Susan's eyes. When he realized that he could move his body as well as her body, he wonders where Susan actually is. When he thought that, he heard her voice in his head. She said 'Harry? What happened? Why can't I move my own body anymore?' Harry thought (once he figured out how to do it) to her 'I don't know, but I can feel everything you feel too. I can also see through your eyes and a girls' body feels really weird with your ... eummm thingies.' While they were having a conversation and Harry (as Susan) picks himself off the ground and sit on the bench Susan's girlfriend is searching the train for Susan.</p>
<p>A/N: Cliffhanger! Who do you guess is Susan's girlfriend? The one who gets it right will get a shoutout in the next chapter in the A/N</p>
