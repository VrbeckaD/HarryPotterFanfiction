  <em>During Chapter Twelve:</em>
</p><hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> Remus regained consciousness shortly after being transported to the Black servant's infirmary. He flailed his arms, almost smacking an innocent nurse.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> “Frank,” he slurred, “between you and me, we have two ears and three eyes.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> He started laughing madly before passing out. Lily and Alice turned to each other with wide eyes and Frank was left waiting for someone to sign to him what Remus said.</span>

  <span class="s1"> A strange cat snuck into the sickroom Remus was taken to and couldn’t be chased away by any nurse or doctor. The cat always found a way back into the room and once they relented, the cat curled up next to Remus while they tended to his wounds, never leaving for a moment. James tried to pet the animal, only to receive a warning scratch, nothing more than a flesh wound. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Alice and Frank shared a mutual fond look. It took Lily a day to notice the glasses-like marking around the cat's eyes and she turned excitedly to James, finding him slowly inch forward, cooing, attempting to pet the "cat" again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">She decided to let him discover for himself.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> A few days after the big ballroom werewolf celebration party, Remus sheepishly admitted to Sirius that he had lost sight in his left eye. Sirius’ mouth dried up and his mind failed to function.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> “Really, love, it’s okay. It might only last a few weeks or months. And if it stays it will be fine,” Remus said. “It’s not a bad thing, it’s just something we have to adjust to, like Frank with his ears. And you with bees—you were scared of them but now you’re fine being near them.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> Sirius thought this was vastly different than <em>bees</em>. He didn’t say that out loud—he took Remus’ hand and squeezed it. “Alright.” He worked on softening his voice, earnestly saying, “We’ll adjust and I’ll help in any way I can.” Remus released a small relieved breath and Sirius wondered why Remus had been so worried to admit this. Looking back, things started to make a lot more sense—Remus’ wooziness and instability. “Does this mean I can carry you everywhere?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> Remus slapped Sirius’ arm. “No.” He side-eyed Sirius. “Not like you don’t do it already enough, though.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">—</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> The partial blindness never faded away. Remus hid it well from others—anything perceived as a weakness was not ideal when working close to Walburga—but it wasn’t always easy. For Remus’ next birthday, Sirius contacted Alice and they worked together to write a book with a blind protagonist. </span>
