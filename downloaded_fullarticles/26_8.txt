    <p>The Club, as it had become known, had been started by one Rory Williams. It's beginnings were not quite as grand as the stories shared by its members, in fact it began as an act of desperate frustration. How was Rory to know so many people had died and come back? Some even (like himself) had done so several times.<br/>"Jack, what are you doing?"<br/>"I think he's drinking Dean "under the table", Doctor. "<br/>"Shut up Cas, he can't do that!"<br/>"You bet I can Hunter-boy!"<br/>"Ha! Take that Merlin! I beat you! Merlin's beard I beat Merlin!"<br/>"Only because I let you Golden Boy."<br/>Rory sighed. He didn't know what he had planned for The Club but, somehow, it wasn't this.<br/>"Rory!" A voice that sounded like a child called. "Rory, I think Krillin's dead again!" Rory turned and saw Gohan stood over the still form of Krilin. He sighed. No, this is definitely not what he had wanted when he started the club.</p>
