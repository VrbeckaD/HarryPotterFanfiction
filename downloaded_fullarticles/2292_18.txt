</blockquote><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">I look at my watch and it’s nearly down. How can you sleep when you know you fucked up the best thing you ever had?</p><p align="justify">The woman that lays besides me is not my wife. She is not as beautiful, as kind and is not even close to have ten per cent of her intelligence.</p><p align="justify">I should have come home hours ago, right after the funeral. But the minute, no, the second I emptied myself inside her, I knew I had fucked up everything. As a former Slytheryn, I should be able to lie myself out of this situation. I should and certainly would if it was anyone else, but not with my wife. I have a greater chance of being forgiven for the cheating than for disrespecting her intelligence with empty lies. Because my wife, I can guarantee you, already knows. She is the brightest f them all.</p><p align="justify">Astoria stirs on the bed and I decide that is finally time to man up and face my acts. So, I leave my spot and begin collecting my clothes and dressing up. It is time to go home.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">....</p><p align="justify">I can feel her before I even see her. She is sitting on the side of the fireplace dressed in black. She hates black because of the amount of funerals we were forced to attend during the war. Why is she wearing it? I didn’t want anyone in the funeral. Just me and that bastard.</p><p align="justify">I look at her. My heart breaks. I can see the lines in her face, the lines that the muggle make up left. New scars.</p><p align="justify">The silence is suffocating me. All I want to do is crawl to her and beg for forgiveness and cry and ask her to yell at me. But I know everything that is about her: body, mind and soul. I must talk. She will want to know everything.</p><p align="justify">“What do you want to know first?” I ask softly while I pour myself firewhiskey and offer the other to her. Oddly, she doesn’t drink it. She looks straight into my eyes and correct her spine. She is on war mode.</p><p align="justify">“For the first time in my life I wish I didn’t know. Being a know it all is a burden for the first time.”</p><p align="justify">She is on her feet now. The glass in her hand. She is having trouble to breath.</p><p align="justify">“Because I know it all already. You know, of course. I am aware that you run to that blond whore that has nothing more than good hair in her head. That instead of trust in me, confide in me, yell at me, cry with me, talk to me, fuck me, you opted to put your dick inside another to not deal with your feelings. I know every insecurity that drove you to her. I know because I kissed every scar. Over and over again. So the only thing”</p><p align="justify">Her voice breaks and she sobs. I can’t breathe because she can’t. And I fucking feel it. The pain. She takes a deep breath.</p><p align="justify">“The only thing that last to ask you is…was it good? Was it worth it ending our marriage because of a fucking whore?”</p><p align="justify">“Baby, I…”</p><p align="justify">I don’t have words. What can I tell her?</p><p align="justify">“TELL ME. BE A MAN AND FUCKING TELL ME THAT YOU CUM SO HARD THAT MADE IT ALL WORTH IT. TELL ME THAT HER PUSSY WAS SO TIGHT THAT YOU FOUGHT NOT TO CUM. TELL ME THAT THIS FUCKING SHAG WAS WONDERFUL. THAT YOU DON’T REGRET IT BECAUSE IT WAS MIND BLOWING. THE BEST YOU EVER HAD. THAT SHE COULD MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY LIKE I NEVER COULD IN THOSE COLD NIGHTS DURING THE WAR… TELL ME ECAUSE I AM BLEEDING INSIDE OUT. I AM IN SO MUCH PAIN RIGHT NOW THAT I FEEL LIKE I BROKE EVERY BONE IN MY BODY. I CAN’T. TELL ME. PLEASE.”</p><p align="justify">My body is shaking. I feel like my lungs are on fire. I feel like being crucio. I feel like her being kidnapped again. I feel her pain.</p><p align="justify">But I have to make it worst. So I speak. I tell her.</p><p>“I regretted it the moment I spilled myself inside of her. I just wanted the pain to stop. I don’t want to mourn his death and still. I can’t. I can’t feel, I shouldn’t feel, but I feel. There is only pain.”</p><p>She drags herself from the floor. Her hair is wild. I love it so much. I love her so much. All of her. I almost died to rescue her. I betrayed every single person of my family because of her. I killed my uncles because of her. She is my life. How did I not know she was the only one who could make it stop? She was the only one who could after mom killed herself. She is the only one who can make it all go away.</p><p>“Pain?I will tell you what pain is.” She hisses.</p><p>And I feel my anger boil inside me. And I cut her speech off before she can continue.</p><p>“The monster I used to call my father was tortured and killed in the prison that I helped put him in. He, who hurt me like no one else, who drove my mom to suicide. So, yes, you are right. I don’t know pain.”</p><p>I stare at her and wait for the end of it. Wait for the screams. But ,for my surprise, she speaks really low.</p><p>“Pain is feeling sad because of the death of the man who watched you being broken to pieces. Pain is loving someone so much that you pray for the life of this horrible person because his son is the air that you breathe. Pain is waiting outside of the room that your husband is having sex with another woman. Is hearing him cum inside someone else.”</p><p>The glass crashed in her hands and her blood begin to fall in the floor.</p><p>“Pain, Draco, is being cheated on the same night you’ve found out that you are pregnant.”</p>
