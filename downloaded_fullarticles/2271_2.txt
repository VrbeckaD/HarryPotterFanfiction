    <p>Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived With The Dark Lord</p>
<p>His gaze shifted around the cottage across the street. For long, tedious months had he been searching for this cottage in specific. The thrice-be-damned Mudblood had done an excellent job at hiding from him, but she was a fool. She should have known that nobody, especially her of all people, could hide from Lord Voldemort.</p>
<p>A figure walked past the lower level's window. Upon closer inspection he determined it was the blood-traitor the Mudblood woman called husband. But what was this? The blood-traitor was holding something – something small and –</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort felt his blood boil. The blood-traitor was holding him.</p>
<p>How dare he!</p>
<p>Feeling the almost uncontainable urge to storm right now into the cottage Lord Voldemort quickly managed to rein his killing impulses.</p>
<p>No, he couldn't let his rage overcome him now, not now that his plan was mere minutes from fulfilling itself.</p>
<p>Another few minutes went by and finally the Mudblood woman took him from the blood traitor. Moments later one of the windows upstairs lit up with light.</p>
<p>Yes, this was it.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort rose from his hiding place and calmly walked across the street.</p>
<p>Stealthily opening the front gate he almost laughed at the idiot blood-traitor who didn't even notice him as he glided through their garden up to their front door.</p>
<p>Raising his wand he quickly blasted the door off.</p>
<p>Yelling ensued from the inside of the cottage as he idly stepped over the remains of the front door.</p>
<p>Eyeing the stairs he took a step towards them but was blocked by the blood-traitor Potter who was still yelling orders at his wife to stay away from harm's way.</p>
<p>"Step aside", he commanded coldly at the blood-traitor.</p>
<p>Straightening himself the blood-traitor Potter met his eyes defiantly and spat, "Never! You'll never win Voldemort!"</p>
<p>Raising his wand once he again he quickly cast the killing curse at the blood-traitor, smiling when the thud of his body hitting the floor sounded across the room.</p>
<p>Walking further he stepped over the corpse and went up the stairs towards his room.</p>
<p>Stepping inside the room of the reason he'd been spending months searching and burning houses across the country he found himself facing his second obstacle to his way towardshim.</p>
<p>"Move, if you know what's better for you", he ordered the Mudblood.</p>
<p>"NO! Don't take Harry! Please not Harry! Not Harry please!", she pleaded, tears streaming down her cheeks as she stood in front of the crib, obscuring the view of him.</p>
<p>"And let him be raised by blood-traitors?", he asked, his voice dangerously cold.</p>
<p>"PLEASE! Don't take him away! Not Harry!", she continued to plead.</p>
<p>"I am only taking what is rightfully mine, now, step aside or I shall send you to your husband", he warned her one last time.</p>
<p>"JAMES! Oh, James!", she wailed, "Don't take Harry! PLEASE!", she cried desperately.</p>
<p>His patience finally worn out, he cursed, "AVADA KEDAVRA!"</p>
<p>Green light filled the room as she screamed one last time the name of her son and fell lifeless on the floor, finally letting him see him.</p>
<p>In the crib, Harry sat looking mildly scared but also curious at the stranger standing in his room, having no real idea what had just happened with his mother.</p>
<p>A thin smile crept into Lord Voldemort's face as he took a few steps towards Harry and inspected him closely.</p>
<p>"He was right", he mused as he touched the baby's soft black hair and gently ruffled it, "You do look like me."</p>
<p>Harry just stared with his curiosity filled green eyes at him, no longer being scared at the stranger with the red eyes.</p>
<p>Awkwardly stretching his arms out and lifting the baby from its crib, Lord Voldemort held his son for the very first time.</p>
<p>Never before had the Dark Lord held an infant in his arms, never before had he even wanted to be near one. Always feeling repulsed by the mere presence of small children ever since his days at the orphanage, Voldemort had never as much as touched one. But yet here he was. And he was neither repulsed nor did he wish to get the infant out of his sight. This was different. This was his heir, blood of his blood, flesh of his flesh.</p>
<p>Suddenly snapping out of his musing as Harry began squirming in his arms, Voldemort hastily turned and walked downstairs. Intending to be far, far away by the time the Order arrived.</p>
<p>"One last thing", he said as he stood in front of the cottage, "Look Harry", he raised his wand, gaining his son's attention.</p>
<p>Casting a nonverbal curse the cottage suddenly caught fire, but not just any fire, but a powerful magical fire. No one, Muggle or Wizard, would be able to extinguish the fire for hours and by then there would almost be nothing left of the house, never mind the bodies.</p>
<p>Harry, meanwhile, stared at the fire consuming what he had come to know as his home with growing fear.</p>
<p>"Look here Harry", he once more directed Harry's attention to his wand, "This will be the first spell you learn", he smiled cruelly and pointed his wand at the sky above the cottage.</p>
<p>"MORSMORDRE!"</p>
<p>The Dark Mark immediately appeared above the cottage, the serpent coiling itself around the skull.</p>
<p>"It is a spell of my own invention Harry, but I am sure you will also one day come to create spells and curses of your own", he glanced back down at the infant in his arms and saw, not fear as he had expected, but something akin to fascination as he watched the serpent coiling itself around the skull.</p>
<p>Smiling, Voldemort said, now confident in his words, "Yes, terrible spells and curses, Harry."</p>
<p>Several poping sounds could suddenly be heard from across the street and Voldemort hid Harry inside his cloak as his Death Eaters walked towards him, levitating the limp form of a person among them.</p>
<p>"Master", said the leading Death Eater as he knelt and the other echoed his action.</p>
<p>"Do you have him?", Voldemort asked coldly.</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord, just as you requested."</p>
<p>"Good, set everything up as I told you, I want no errors", he said coldly and made his way back to the street but stopped as he passed one of the still kneeling Death Eater that was trembling uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"Well done Wormtail, you have finally done something right, I expect you to finish everything here off as I ordered you just as well."</p>
<p>"Y-yes, m-m-my Lord", said the trembling form of Wormtail and all the Death Eaters set to work as their Master had told them.</p>
<p>Once standing in the middle of the street, and without offering the burning cottage a second glance, Lord Voldemort and his son disapparated.</p>
