    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus Dumbledore was proud to say that he was one of the, if not the most , intelligent man alive. Many wizards listened to his advices, and many more counted on him to protect the wizarding community from the dark forces. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After the defeat of Grindelwald the general population started looking up to him as the leader of light, the protector of the good and just. When Lord Voldemort rose to power Albus’s words were the law, and his orders were to be followed blindly. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was a slow and steady process, but by the end of it Albus Dumbledore had transformed into a man that believed that his thoughts and opinions were the right ones, and opinions that differ to his should be discarded and changed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So on Halloween, when he arrived to what was left of the once Potter’s house, nobody questioned his decision to take Harry and bring him to a muggle family. McGonagall<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was the only one who put up a fight but quickly stopped once she learned they were Harry’s relatives.<br/>
</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Had he not been so blinded by his own greatness, maybe he would have seen the mistake he was making. Maybe if he had looked into the boys eyes and seen the unnatural and magical green, if he had seen the stillness with which he laid in the blankets, maybe, just maybe he could have prevented it all. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But he didn’t. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And when morning came, and Harry was waiting for Petunia Dursley to open the door and take him in, Albus was absolutely sure that his plan would succeed. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Only it didn’t. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry spent precisely six hours with the Dursley’s before he was shoved into a car and taken to the furthest orphanage in London. There Petunia claimed she had no idea who he was and couldn’t possible raise another child. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“ Does he have a name?” Asked Mrs Bennett , the head of the orphanage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“ Harry…” Petunia paused for a second, and looked into Harry’s eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“ Harry Emrys , his name is Harry Emrys ” </span>
