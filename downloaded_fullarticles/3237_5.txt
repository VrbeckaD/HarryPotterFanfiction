    <p> </p><p> </p><p>07/31/2017</p><p>Harry was sitting on his throne at Hogwarts, thinking about what he was going to do, wondering how Magical Beings got here. He kept wondering what they were going to do, should they pray for any cosmic entity to help them and give them a solution, yet nothing answered their pleas. Harry thought back to his past, to everything that had happened to him. He still remembered when his life changed dramatically when he was five years old.</p><p>* Flashback *</p><p>
  <em>31/07/1985</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry was sleeping in the closet under the stairs in the Dursleys' house, the place where he had lived for the last four years, following the death of his parents in a car accident, or at least that’s what happened according to his aunt. His "bedroom" was very small, 6 X 6 ft., with an old mattress on the floor along with his baby blanket, an old moldy pillow and two broken toys that had belonged to his cousin, Dudley. Harry was also not dressed properly, wearing the worn clothes of his cousin, who was already too big and had to change his clothes, giving the old clothes to his cousin, which were much too big for him. In addition, he literally bathed in his piss, not being allowed to leave his closet at night, locked up like an animal, he could only do his needs directly on the ground. In short, he lived in unsustainable conditions, and he did not know why. And besides, he knew that today he was going to suffer, because strangely, it was always the 31st of July that he suffered the most. His aunt liked to say it was the day of the demon's birth, probably referring to him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yet he did not understand why his birthday was a day of suffering, while his cousin's birthday was a day of peace and joy for Dudley. He thought it was unfair, and wanted it to change. At only five years old, he was already very intelligent, understanding everything around him, already knew how to read, but had to hide it, because he knew that if he showed himself superior to his cousin, he would be put back in his place by his uncle, and not without pain.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry was awakened with a start by his aunt who knocked violently on his door. He could hear her yelling in a shrill voice, making him wince a bit as it was too high.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Wake up, freak! You shall prepare the breakfast, and if you fail it, you will not eat for a week! "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry did not waste any time and stood up, taking his glasses, old binoculars picked up at a flea market by his aunt so he could see properly. He then got out of his "jail" to go to the kitchen and started preparing the family's breakfast. Being too small, he had to use a stool to access the stove more easily.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"And do not miss the bacon this time!" Then added his aunt.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, Aunt Petunia." Harry answered tiredly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He set about making the traditional breakfast for the Dursley’s. Fried eggs with bacon, toast, coffee for Vernon, hot chocolate for Dudley, and squeezed orange juice for Petunia. "It's unfair, why can’t I be treated like Dudley?" thought Harry. He kept repeating the question while preparing the meal. It was then that Vernon arrived in the kitchen with Dudley, sitting at the table. Vernon then took his journal and opened it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I hope for your sake that you have not missed anything, boy." Said the overweighed man.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry did not answer because he knew that Vernon did not like being answered, and that the question was rhetorical. "If only they could be nicer to me.", was his thought.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was then that the incredible happened, and that Harry felt a strange sensation in his belly. The sensation traveled very quickly his body, surprising him in passing, so much that he dropped his uncle’s plate. The latter rose furiously, ready to administer a correction to his freak nephew, when he froze. Harry, who had closed his eyes, opened them, and saw that Petunia and Vernon were frozen. It was then that their eyes became more sparkling, more alive. Harry had always wondered why the looks of his uncle and aunt were veiled, different from the others, and yet it was that the looks were no longer veiled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Vernon looked at Harry as if he was seeing him for the first time, turning pale as Petunia gasped in surprise and quickly raised her hand to her mouth, trying to interrupt a sort of scream. She too was looking at Harry with a look so different from the usual one. For the first time in his life, Harry saw in their eyes a different emotion than hatred and disgust. It was sadness, shame and regret.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Before he could react, Petunia rushed towards Harry to hug him, burst into tears, and kept mumbling. Harry had a hard time understanding what was going on, but he appreciated his first hug. He raised his head, fearing Vernon's reaction, but he did not see anger in his eyes, but regret indeed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What did we do?" asked a wide-eyed Vernon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For his part, Dudley did not understand and did not care, just wanting to eat. After a few minutes, Petunia pulled away from Harry and apologized again. Before he could do anything, she took him in his arms and placed him directly at the table, serving him a good plate.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Mum, 'he is he eating wit' us?" Tried to say Dudley, still having a little trouble speaking.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Because it's his birthday and he is your cousin. From now on, Harry will eat with us, like a real family, do you understand my angel? "Petunia answered with a smile.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dudley just nodded before starting to eat again. For his part, Vernon quickly grabbed his jacket and wallet before leaving the house, after whispering something in his wife's ear.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Harry, you will not go to the garden any more, you will also not cook anymore and neither will you have to do the housework any more, do you understand darling?" Said Petunia then.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Okay, Aunt Petunia. But why? "Harry asked, intrigued by this change.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Let's just say that Vernon and I understood our mistakes, and we behaved badly, but everything will change. Besides, you will not sleep in the closet under the stairs, we will install you in the guest room for the moment” Said Petunia with a tear in her eye.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"But that's Aunt Marge's room."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Do not worry, we'll arrange the room next to Dudley's room for you. You will not stay long in Marge's room, and, anyway as she's not here, so it's not a problem." replied Petunia.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"All right, aunt Petunia." Harry simply replied, still haggard after this impromptu change, but he did not complain.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For the first time he enjoyed a splendid breakfast. The day passed quietly, and Harry was able to enjoy television for the first time, and also read books owned by Petunia. The latter was delighted to hear (or rather, notice) that Harry could read, and was happy to give him interesting books, extolling his merits, which made Harry blush. It was late in the afternoon that Vernon returned, and when he arrived, he whispered something in Petunia's ear, and Petunia followed him, ordering Harry and Dudley not to leave Dudley's room. The two kids then began to play quietly with the figurines scattered in the room.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Meanwhile, Vernon, helped by Petunia, went down to take all the groceries and things he bought. There were several gift packages, as well as a beautiful Forêt Noire that he had bought in a French pastry shop not far away. They laid everything in the living room and placed the cake, adorned with five candles, on the dining room table. Without wasting time, Petunia called the boys, asking them to come into the dining room. They were very quick, and Harry's eyes widened at the sight of the splendid cake. That's when he saw Vernon with a big smile, a rare thing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Happy birthday, Harry." Said the man before lighting the candles.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Slowly, Petunia and Vernon began to sing a Happy Birthday to Harry, which made him cry with joy. Harry then went over to the cake, and when the song was over, he blew out the candles, wishing that it would not be a dream. They ate the cake afterwards.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I took a day off for tomorrow." Vernon said.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Excellent idea. I am guessing it's for picking up the furniture? "Petunia asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Indeed. We'll all go to stores together and buy everything Harry needs, he can choose what he wants for his room. "Exclaimed Vernon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Really?" Harry asked timidly, looking at Vernon with hopeful eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, Harry. I swear to you that from now on you will be well treated. "Vernon answered with a big smile.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry could only smile back, enjoying the chocolate cake. Right after that, Petunia covered her eyes and took him to the living room. The night had already fallen. Harry's heart was pounding hard, not knowing what to expect. It was then that Petunia removed her hands, and Harry saw a mountain of gifts.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Happy Birthday!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shouted the two adults, and even Dudley, who was all excited.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry cried and hugged Petunia and Vernon in his arms. He opened his presents, discovering toys, stuffed animals and clothes that fit him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"We'll put all your toys in your room tomorrow, once it's ready, okay?" Vernon asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Okay!" Harry answered happily.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"On this, hop to bed! We have a busy day tomorrow.” Petunia said, taking the two boys upstairs.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She bathed them, made them brush their teeth, and made them wear pajamas. Harry was wearing pretty blue pajamas with stars that Vernon had just given him. She first took Dudley to his room and tucked him. Then she took Harry to his temporary room and tucked him as well.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Good night, my angel." Said Petunia.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Good night, mum." Harry answered without doing it on purpose, tired and with his eyes closed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He fell asleep immediately, not noticing the wide eyes of Petunia upon hearing the word "mum". She then left the room, leaving the door open, as was for Dudley. She went down to the living room, where she found Vernon with a glass of bourbon in his hand, sitting on his armchair, looking thoughtful. For once, she also took a glass of bourbon to sit in front of him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What happened?" Vernon asked, referring to their behavior.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm not sure, but I have some idea, and I do not like it." Petunia answered, squinting and in a pensive mood.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What then?" Vernon asked, puzzled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Dumbledore's letter. I remember my sister telling me that you can enchant objects to change people's behavior. I think that old man had bewitched us to hate magic and hate Harry". Explained Petunia.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"But why? What does he gain? "Vernon asked, not liking the fact that someone could control him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm not sure, but I think I know what happened. The letter said that Harry had defeated the so-called Dark Lord and that James and my sister were killed by this wizard. As I understand it, Harry is very famous among wizards, a living legend." Said Petunia.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I still do not see how the fuck Harry can serve this old fool with us being bewitched." Vernon said.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I suppose he was counting on us to mistreat him and hide the magical world from him. He probably wanted to come here and present himself as a hero in front of Harry, as his savior, saving him from muggle bad guys! Surely to make him his puppet. "Continued Petunia, deep in thought.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"But why? I do not understand anything. And what is a muggle? "Vernon asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"A muggle is a person who does not have magic powers, like us. And for Harry, I think it's a matter of politics. James Potter, Harry's father, was a very rich and powerful Lord, and Harry his only heir. If I remember correctly, wizards have their own government, and are led by the nobles. Harry, being a star through his victory, besides being the heir to a big house and a large fortune, becomes the perfect political tool, and I'm sure this old fool intends to use Harry. "Finished explaining Petunia.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"We're not going to let him go, isn't that right my love?" Vernon said, his voice deep and full of disgust with Dumbledore.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Oh no, we're not going to let him get away with it. We're going to raise Harry right, and we're going to tell him everything about magic. I even think we will have to go to their bank to learn more. "Exclaimed Petunia with a sadistic smile.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"A bank? Where is it?" Vernon asked, stunned.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I think I remember that this bank was called Gringotts, and it's in a neighborhood called Diagon Alley, a magical district hidden in London. It can be reached through an old pub called The Leaky Cauldron, located at Charing Cross Road. I went with my sister when we bought her supplies the second time, and I remember that Gringotts was run by goblins. "Petunia explained.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Goblins? These things really exists? "Vernon wondered, almost spitting out his bourbon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, they really exist, like all other creatures of our fairy tales. Although we will have to be very careful when we go there. Petunia said, looking out the window, across the house.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Why is that?" Vernon asked, following her gaze.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Do you not think it's strange that the day after Harry arrived, a weird woman who never leaves her house and who often watches us came here, and in the house opposite us? I think she's a spy of the old pervert. Surely a Squib. "Explained Petunia, suspiciously.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"A squib? What is it? "Vernon asked, puzzled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"A Squib is a person born in a magic family, but who has no powers." Quickly explained Petunia.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"And you think the other crazy lady-cat is a spy?" Said Vernon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, I'm sure. But we will take care of her in due time. We should go to sleep, we have a lot to do tomorrow. "Replied Petunia.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You're right, darling. Go to sleep, because tomorrow begins a new era for us. " Said Vernon now smiling.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They climbed the stairs, watching as Dudley and Harry slept, before heading to their room, smiling. They did not see Harry's eyes open and wide of surprise in the dark.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Dumbledore ... It's all Dumbledore's fault ... I hate him!" Thought so Harry before falling asleep.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>\Break/</em>
</p><p>
  <em>09/26/1985</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It had been a few months since life for Harry at the Dursleys had changed, and all for the better. He now lived in his own room, which earlier was Dudley's second bedroom, and everything had been arranged to his liking. His room now had a large bed, a large wardrobe and a library. An office had been added, obviously dedicated to future use, when it was bigger.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Vernon and Petunia had also decided to reveal everything to Harry, especially after a case of accidental magic, which changed the color of Petunia's hair, which ended up with blue hair, to the delight of Dudley and Harry. Harry learned that his father was a wizard, and moreover a Lord. He also learned that his mother was in fact adopted by the Evans family, that she was a brilliant witch, and that she was not an alcoholic prostitute. Of course, Harry was slightly frightened at being abandoned by his aunt and uncle, as they were not his real family, but he was reassured.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So on this day, the Dursleys decided to take Harry to Diagon Alley to try to find out more about the wizarding world, to get books, if possible, to help Harry with magical culture, and finally, inquire at Gringotts about Harry's legacy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They arrived quietly at Charing Cross Road, and when they held Harry's hand, they could see the Leaky Cauldron in all its splendor. They did not hesitate to enter the old building, finding several wizards and witches talking or eating, dressed in robes and other clothes dating certainly from the Middle-Ages. Not wasting any time, Petunia immediately led them to the counter where there was a man she knew to be the manager.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Hello! My name is Tom, what can I do for you? "Asked the man at the counter with a big smile.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Hello. We would like to access Diagon Alley, but not being wizards, we cannot open the portal. "Petunia answered with a polite smile.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Oh? However, the school has already taken place, how is it that you are here? "Tom then asked, intrigued by the family before him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"In fact, we came to collect some books and other information for my nephew." Replied Petunia.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Oh good? Who is it? "Tom asked, curious.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Petunia did not notice all the tense ears of the other wizards occupying the tavern. She pointed to Harry with a wave of her hand.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I present you my darling nephew, Harry Potter." She revealed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A deafening silence fell on the tavern, the wizards gasping and wide eyed, watching the boy. Immediately, Tom turned his gaze to Harry's forehead and saw the lightning-shaped scar.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"By my beard! It’s Harry Potter! "The man said, looking happily.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Suddenly, a monster hubbub seized the tavern, and it was a real cacophony. The wizards all headed towards Harry to touch or watch him, but were quickly pushed back by Vernon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tom did not waste time and took them directly to the back of the tavern to open the way to Diagon Alley. The Dursley family did not waste time and headed for the Gringotts Bank, followed closely by a delirious crowd who wanted at all costs to see Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived. They arrived in front of the Bank quickly, to be greeted by the two goblins guarding the entrance who opened the door. Dursleys could then see, displayed on the door, a most interesting inscription:</em>
</p><p align="center"><strong></strong><em>Enter, stranger, but take heed</em><br/> of what awaits the sin of greed<br/> for those who take, but do not earn,<br/> Must pay most dearly in their turn.<br/> So if you seek beneath our floors<br/> a treasure that was never yours,<br/> Thief, you have been warned, beware<br/> of finding more than treasure there.</p><p>
  <em>The inscription made Vernon uneasy, who understood the implied threat. The goblins were probably the last creatures to annoy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They entered the Bank and headed straight for the central podium, occupied by a goblin better dressed than the others. He watched the family closely, and his gaze lingered on Harry's scar. His eyes widened as he realized Harry Potter was facing him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Hello. We would like more information about my nephew, Harry Potter. We would also like to know why we have not received statements and other statements about his affairs and get access to the will of my sister, Lily Jane Potter born Evans and her husband, James Charlus Potter. "Said Petunia, repeating what Vernon had told her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The goblin's eyes widened once again at the woman's politeness in front of him. He clicked a button hidden under his desk to call the Potter family's account manager directly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Hello to you too. I am Ralnuk, the Senior Bank clerk, and I assure you that soon you will have all the answers you want. The Potter family account manager, Glomgold will take care of you. "Replied the goblin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A few seconds later, Glomgold arrived and motioned for the Dursley family to follow him to his office. They arrived in a large office, and the goblin went to his seat, inviting them to sit down in front.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What can I do for you?" asked Glomgold.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"As we told your Senior Teller earlier, we want to know more about my nephew Harry Potter's assets and accounts. We also want to know why we did not receive his monthly statements of account or a summary of his parents' will. I'm Vernon Dursley, and this is my wife, Petunia Dursley born Evans, Harry's aunt. And our son, Dudley. "Vernon explained, taking the lead.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I see. First and foremost, we will have to prove that it's Harry Potter. For this, "He took a white stone out of his drawer. It is enough for him to hold this stone. If he really is Harry Potter, then the stone will shine blue. On the other hand, if it is not the case, then the stone will be red. In that case, I can promise you that you will not come out of this bank in one piece. "Fit the goblin with a scary smile, handing them the stone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The Dursleys nodded and handed the stone to Harry. He took the stone, which began to shine with a bluish glow. The goblin was satisfied and retrieved the stone without delay.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Okay, now that we have verified his identity, I will be able to answer your questions. To begin, know that I send, personally if I can add, your weekly and monthly statements of account. It's really weird that you did not receive any, knowing that I had an acknowledgment about the letters. "The Goblin pointed out, showed a letter with Dumbledore's signature.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Why the hell is his signature valid?" Petunia asked, surprised.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Well, Albus Dumbledore is the magic guardian of Harry Potter. Did you not know? "The surprised goblin asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No, not at all! We never saw him, he just left my nephew in front of our door on the night of 01/11/1981 and that's it! "Fit Petunia, pissed off.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I see. You can then confirm that Harry Potter never stayed in Dumbledore's presence for over a year, that's right? "The goblin asked, a sadistic gleam in his eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Petunia just nodded, and a carnivorous smile appeared on the goblin's face. He then took a scroll from his desk and began writing quickly on it. After a few seconds the parchment began to shine, and a gleam of pure pleasure could be seen in the goblin's eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“In this case, Albus Dumbledore can no longer be considered the magic guardian of Harry Potter. I still want to add that this tutelage was completely illegal, and that the official guardian is Sirius Black, who is currently in Azkaban, but it is not important. Who should I name as a magical guardian? "Asked the goblin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Can I be?" Petunia asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, you can. Contrary to popular belief, muggles can get magical tutelage from wizards. In this case, you are now officially considered Harry’s guardian”. Revealed the goblin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Perfect. On the other hand, how to explain the illegal tutelage? "Vernon asked, puzzled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"It's very simple. Albus Dumbledore sealed the wills of James and Lily Potter, under his authority as President of Wizengamot, and then declared himself the legal guardian of their child, Hadrian James Potter. "Then revealed the goblin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"And we cannot do anything for the will?" Vernon asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Unfortunately, no. The only way would be to unseal it, and to do this, you will have to either get the approval of the President of the Wizengamot, who is still Albus Dumbledore, or a vote on the part of the Wizengamot. As muggles, you cannot start proceedings, and only Harry can. On the other hand, we were able to appoint you as legal guardians, and as a result, Dumbledore will no longer have access to the accounts of the young Mr. Potter. We will also redirect the mail to your address. Albus Dumbledore, as guardian, ordered the redirection of all mail to his personal home at Godric's Hollow. "Explained Glomgold.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"We want to buy some books for Harry so that he has the necessary knowledge for his official entry into the wizarding world. Any recommendations? "Fit Petunia then.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I recommend the Flourish &amp; Blotts shop, and ask them directly for books on the wizarding world, ethics among wizards, manners, as well as the political climate of the wizarding world and the general history of the Wizarding World, Wizards and Avalon. Do you have any currency to pay for his books? "Asked the goblin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, we have some pounds that we will use." Fit Vernon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"That will not be enough, we use our own currency, Mr. Dursley. I'm going to give you a Wizards Credit Card, directly linked to one of Mr. Potter's accounts. It will remain limited to 500 gallons a month, which represents a total of £ 2500 in muggle money. I can assure you, this card also works in muggle dispensers and other shops, with a 5% exchange rate, which would then leave you £2375 a month in the muggle world. Does this suit you? "Glomgold asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"That will be enough, thank you. On the other hand, would it be possible to delay updating Harry's information? We do not want to inform Dumbledore. "Fit a pensive Petunia.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Perfect. Know that this old man is not appreciated among us, and that we will do all that is necessary to block it. So we will continue to send him false statements, and say that the accounts are temporarily blocked until the arrival of Harry Potter. "Fit the goblin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Why block them?" Vernon asked suspiciously.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>" Well, according to our records, Albus Dumbledore took a total of 500 gallons a month from Mr. Potter's account for his own account, and paid Molly Weasley 250G a month. The account is replenished each year by the master account up to a total cap of 10 000 galleons, Dumbledore theoretically stole the total sum of 36 000 Gallions, or £180 000 in four years. "Revealed the goblin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"180 000 pounds? How dare this fucking asshole son of a whore? I'm going to make him eat his beard and snap his neck! "Shouted Vernon, red with anger.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"All right, do as planned and block access to accounts for Dumbledore. Could you also repatriate all the keys? I know my sister had one for her vault. "Petunia asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The goblin nodded and opened a small chest, having already repatriated the keys. He then gave Petunia a small golden key, explaining that it was Harry's trust vault, and that they would have to go back to Gringotts to get gold if there was not enough with the card.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Petunia and Vernon thanked the goblin, took the key and left the bank to buy the books Harry needed. After buying the books, they went back to Privet Drive and Harry plunged into his books, cursing Dumbledore once again, but also the Weasleys.</em>
</p><p>* Flashback end *</p><p>Apart from that moment, his life had changed dramatically. He was able to grow as he should have been, living in relative financial security, never lacking anything. Over the years, and with a balanced diet, he finally lost his glasses, no longer required, which had delighted him to the highest point. He had gone to school with Dudley, still being the first in his class, quickly learning everything he needed.</p><p>He also devoured the books on the wizarding world, learning all he needed to know about the Potters and their importance in the wizarding world. At the age of eleven, he was fetched by Hagrid from the Dursleys, and as agreed with his aunt, he pretended not to know anything about the wizarding world to avoid putting Dumbledore's notice on him. He picked up his wand directly from Ollivander, and was delighted to hear that it was Voldemort's twin wand.</p><p>At Gringotts, he took the opportunity to learn a little more about the inheritance tests, and decided to take one, seeing no harm. He took advantage of Hagrid's idiocy to convince him to go get a beer. In fact, Hagrid had gone looking for an owl, Hedwig, to offer it to Harry. He still remembered the most astonishing result of his inheritance test. He had kept the old parchment with him as a souvenir, and looked down to read it again.</p><p align="center"><strong>Name</strong> <strong>used;</strong></p><p align="center">

</p><p>At first he had a hard time believing what was written, but he did not look any further. Of course, he realized then that he should research the Riddle family, as he didn’t knew anything about it at all, but remembered that the Gaunt family was Slytherin's. Unfortunately he did not understand what he had done to be the heir to Merlin, real name, Myrdin Emrys.</p><p>On 01/09/1991, Harry boarded the Hogwarts Express, carefully avoiding the Weasley, and met Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. He soon became friends with them, which did not result in a skewed view of the Slytherin house. Harry still remembered his presentation.</p><p>* Flashback *</p><p>
  <em>Harry was quietly looking for a wagon to settle in, when he saw far off the red heads he wanted to avoid at all costs. He did not hesitate to enter the first car he saw, even though he was busy. There were three people inside, three boys. There was a pretty blue-eyed blond, and two rather muscular boys with silly faces.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Excuse me, can I sit down with you? I want to avoid some unwanted persons, and they are on the way to the other wagons. "Harry then said.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Ah, yes, of course. I am Draco Lucius Malfoy, heir to the Ancient and Most Noble House of Malfoy." said the blond, holding out his hand.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Gregory Goyle, heir to the Ancient and Noble House of Goyle." Presented one of the gorillas.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Vincent Crabbe, heir to the Ancient and Noble House of Crabbe." Fit the other Gorilla.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry looked at them and thought back to the books on the wizarding etiquette he had read. He had to introduce himself by his full name, and he hoped they would not make a mess of them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>" I am Hadrian James Potter, Heir to the Most Archaic and the Most Gracious House of Emrys and Heir to the Most Ancient and Most Noble Houses of Peverell, Black, Gryffindor , Slytherin, Potter and Gaunt. " Harry stood up, shaking Draco's hand.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The other three young wizards opened their eyes wide, surprised to have the famous Harry Potter with them. Draco then noted the different families used by Harry.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Merlin?! You are Merlin's heir? "Draco said, his voice high.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes, I know it's shocking, I myself was shocked when I learnt about this from the goblins." Harry said, blushing at the stunned eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You really have a scar?" Vincent asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry just nodded and lifted his bangs to show his scar, catching a hiccup of stupor from the three boys. For his part, Draco was delighted to see that Harry knew the pureblood traditions, and then rethought his father's orders, who had asked him to watch Harry and keep in touch with him, telling his son that Harry was in fact the grandson of the Dark Lord. He also told him to never look at Dumbledore in the eyes.</em>
</p><p>* end flashback *</p><p>He was really amused by the reaction of one who would later become his best friend, Draco Malfoy. He also remembered one of Glomgold's messages, his account manager, informing him that Dumbledore had tried to pay Molly Weasley money once again, but also Guinevere Weasley, Ronald Weasley and some nobody named Hermione Granger. Of course, Harry did everything humanly possible to avoid them. It was obvious when he was assigned to one of the Hogwarts Houses that Dumbledore realized that there was a problem.</p><p>* Flashback *</p><p>
  <em>Guided by Professor McGonagall, they crossed the huge floor-paved room and entered a small room for first-year students. Harry heard the sound of hundreds of voices coming through a door on his right. The other students had to be there already. The small size of the room forced them to huddle together. They stood in silence, casting a few worried glances around.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Welcome to Hogwarts", said Professor McGonagall, "The banquet at the beginning of the year will begin soon, but before you take a seat in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into the different houses. The sorting is a very important ceremony. You should know, indeed, that throughout your stay in school, your house will be like a second family for you. You will follow the same courses, sleep in the same dormitory and spend your free time in the same common room. The houses are four in number. Their names are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has its own history, its own nobility, and each of them has trained witches and witches in the years. During your year at Hogwarts, every time you get good results you will earn points for your house, but every time you break the common rules, your house will lose points. At the end of the school year, the house with the most points wins the Four Houses Cup, which is a great honor. I hope that each and every one of you will be committed to serving your house, whichever it may be. The Ceremony of the Sorting will take place in a few minutes in the presence of all the students of the school. I advise you to take advantage of the remaining time to cleanup. "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The professor's gaze lingered on Neville, whose cloak was crooked, and on Ron, who still had a stain on his nose.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'll get you back when everything's ready", said Professor McGonagall, "Wait for me in silence." She left the room.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"How do they sort us?" He asked Draco, intrigued.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"My father told me it was a secret, so it may be tests."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry felt faint. Tests? In front of everybody? He looked around, the other students looked terrified. Nobody said much, except Hermione Granger whispering at full speed she had learned by heart all possible spells and she wondered which should be well cast. Harry tried not to listen to what she was saying, he wanted only one thing which was to gut her so that she would stop blabbering. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. At any moment, now, Professor McGonagall would come in and take him to his fate.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Suddenly, screams rose behind Harry. He turned around and gaped, like the others. About twenty ghosts had appeared while crossing the back wall. Pearly white, slightly transparent, they floated across the room without giving a glance to the students gathered. They seemed to argue. One of them, who looked like a little fat monk, said:</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Observe and forgive. We should give him a second chance. "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"My dear Brother, have we not given Peeves all the chances he deserved?" answered another specter, dressed in high-boots and the neck surrounded by a strawberry. "He gives us a horrible reputation while he himself is not really a ghost. Here, who… what are they doing here? "He noticed the presence of the first years, who were careful not to utter a single word.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"These are the new students, said the fat monk, smiling at them. You're waiting for the Sorting, I guess? "Some students nodded silently.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I hope to see you in Hufflepuff", said the monk. "It was my house, in time."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Let's go. The ceremony will now begin. “Said a sudden voice. Professor McGonagall was back.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>One by one, the ghosts left the room crossing the opposite wall.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Stand in line and follow me", said the teacher to the students.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry felt a weird sensation, as if his legs had suddenly changed to lead. He slipped between Draco and a boy with hair black and curly, and students left the room, crossed the hall and then through a double door that opened into the Great Hall.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The place was strange and beautiful. Thousands of lit candles suspended in the air, four long tables around which the other students were already sitting, plates and golden goblets in front of them. At the end of the room, the teachers sat around another table.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Professor McGonagall aligned the early years with their classmates behind which the teachers were standing. In the uncertain light of the candles, the faces looked at them like lanterns with pale gleams. Scattered among the students, the ghosts shone like plumes of silver mist. Embarrassed by the staring eyes on the new ones, Harry looked up at a velvet-black ceiling studded with stars.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"It's a magic ceiling, Hermione murmured. It was made to look like the sky. I read it in The Hogwarts Story. "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry had also read the story of Hogwarts, and he did not tell it to everyone. He frankly found this hellish girl annoying.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry looked at what was happening in front of him where Professor McGonagall set up a four-legged stool in front of the new students. On the stool she laid a pointed witch hat. The hat was shredded, dirty, patched. Aunt Petunia would never have wanted it in her home.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Maybe they would ask them to bring out a rabbit? Harry thought. Everyone now had their eyes fixed on the pointed hat. For a few moments there reigned a total silence. Then, suddenly, the hat stirred. A tear near the edge opened wide like a mouth, and the hat began to sing:</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>"Oh you may not think I'm pretty,</em><br/> But don't judge on what you see,<br/> I'll eat myself if you can find<br/> A smarter hat than me.</p><p align="center"><em>You can keep your bowlers black,</em><br/> your top hats sleek and tall,<br/> for I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat<br/> and I can cap them all.</p><p align="center"><em>There's nothing hidden in your head</em><br/> The Sorting Hat can't see,<br/> so try me on and I will tell you<br/> where you ought to be.</p><p align="center"><em>You might belong in Gryffindor,</em><br/> Where dwell the brave at heart,<br/> their daring, nerve, and chivalry<br/> Set Gryffindors apart;</p><p align="center"><em>You might belong in Hufflepuff,</em><br/> Where they are just and loyal,<br/> those patient Hufflepuffs are true<br/> and unafraid of toil;</p><p align="center"><em>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,</em><br/> if you've a ready mind,<br/> where those of wit and learning,<br/> Will always find their kind;</p><p align="center"><em>Or perhaps in Slytherin</em><br/> you'll make your real friends,<br/> those cunning folks use any means<br/> to achieve their ends.</p><p align="center"><em>So put me on! Don't be afraid!</em><br/> And don't get in a flap!<br/> You're in safe hands (though I have none)<br/> for I'm a Thinking Cap!"</p><p>
  <em>When it finished the song, applause broke out all over the room. The hat bowed to greet the four tables, then it stopped again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"So, we just wear the hat!" Whispered Draco in Harry's ear.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry gave a weak smile. Trying a hat was better than being forced to cast a spell, but he would have preferred not to do it in front of everyone. The hat scared him and Harry felt no more courage. If there had been a house for students on the verge of nausea, he would have gone right away. Professor McGonagall stepped forward with a long roll of parchment in his hand.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"When I call your name, you put the hat on your head and sit on the stool. Abbot, Hannah! "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A girl with a pink complexion and blonde mats came out of the rank with unsteady steps. She went to put the hat that fell in front of her eyes and sat on the stool.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"HUFFLEPUFF!" The hat shouted after a moment's silence.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Cheers and applause rose from the table on the right and Hannah sat down among the other Hufflepuff students. Harry saw the ghost of the fat monk make him big, enthusiastic signs.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Bones, Susan!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"HUFFLEPUFF!" The hat shouted again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Susan hastened to sit next to Hannah.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Boot, Terry!" Called Professor McGonagall.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"RAVENCLAWN!" Shouted the hat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>This time the applause rose from the second table on the left. Ravenclaw students greeted Terry with a hand shake.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Brocklehurst, Mandy was also sent to Ravenclaw. Brown, Lavender was the first to go to Gryffindor. A standing ovation came from the table on the far left. The twins whistled happily to greet her arrival.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bulstrode, Millicent was sent to Slytherin. The Slytherin table seemed to be made up of quite distinct students, and less likely to be silly, which Harry liked a lot. Maybe he was made for Slytherin? Was he not its heir?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Finch-Fletchey, Justin!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"HUFFLEPUFF!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Several pupils were thus distributed in the various houses. Harry noticed that the hat sometimes took time to think before deciding.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Granger, Hermione!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione almost ran to the stool and frantically wore the hat on her head.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"GRYFFINDOR!" Shouted the hat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco made a sneer, muttering a "good riddance". Harry suddenly had one of those horrible thoughts that usually accompany panic states. What if he was not chosen at all? "If he stayed there with the Hat on his head without anything happening and Professor McGonagall ended up telling him there was a mistake and he had to go home by the next train?" But he comforted himself that his passing at Gringotts had proved his belonging to the Magical World.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When Neville Longbottom, the boy who was constantly losing his toad, was called, he stumbled and fell as he approached the stool. The Sorting Hat took a long time to decide. Finally, he shouted:</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"GRYFFINDOR."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Neville immediately rushed to his comrades without removing the hat from his head and had to return to give it to MacDougal, Morag, under the bursts of laughter.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When his name was called, Malfoy advanced with a conquering step towards the stool. As soon as he brushed his head, the hat exclaimed:</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"SLYTHERIN!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Satisfied, Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle who had been sent to Slytherin, too. Draco looked at Harry as he sat down and waved him, hoping he'd join him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There were not many people left in the queue of newcomers.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Moon ... Nott ... Professor McGonagall called names that started with "P". Parkinson ... the twins Patil ... Perks, Sally Anne ... and finally...</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Potter, Harry!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When Harry stepped out of the row, murmurs rose throughout the room.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Did she say Potter?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Harry Potter?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Before the hat fell to his eyes and plunged him into absolute darkness, Harry had time to see the heads stretching to look at him better.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Hmm, it's not easy, said a small voice in his ear. Very difficult. I see a lot of courage. Fascinating intellectual qualities, too, There is talent and ... ho! Ho! My boy, you're eager to prove yourself, that's interesting ... Come on, where am I going to put you? "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry gripped his fingers on the edge of the stool. "Not Gryffindor, not Gryffindor," he thought forcefully.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"No Gryffindor? Why, then? Oh, I see, you're suspicious of Dumbledore, and you're right, boy. Yes, you are very intelligent, and very cunning, this house is not made for you. But what do you really know about Dumbledore? "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry became thoughtful. "Not much, but I know he wants me ill, he tried to bewitch my family to abuse me, and he paid the Weasley and Granger." He thought in answer.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Excellent, you learn quickly, my boy. But not all Weasley are under Dumbledore's thumb, and you'll have to discover it over time. Hm ... Yes, it's obvious that you're not made for Gryffindor, even though you're the heir. You know, you could give me the order, and I'll put you in the house of your choice. "Fit the hat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry was stunned. "Order it? What do you mean?" He thought.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Come on, you know what I'm talking about, young Harry. You are the heir of Gryffindor, and also Slytherin. This school belongs to you, and everything in it too, including me. But it's time for me to place you, and for that I see nothing better than ... SLYTHERIN! "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A silence fell over the room, students being surprised that Harry Potter was not going to Gryffindor. Suddenly, the silence was broken by applause from the Slytherin table, with Draco Malfoy applauding with gusto. It was a trigger, and all at the Slytherin table stood up to applaud their hero, and those who knew, among them, the heir of the Dark Lord. They were later joined by the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables, but not Gryffindor.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As for the teachers, their reactions were varied. A funny little fellow seemed astonished, and McGonagall seemed disappointed. But the most amusing thing for Harry was seeing Dumbledore's worried look, comfortably seated on his golden throne at the end of the table. He did not notice the intrigued looks of Severus Snape and Quirinus Quirell.</em>
</p><p>* Flashback end *</p><p>His year passed peacefully at Hogwarts among the Slytherins. He was slightly rushed by Severus Snape, his main teacher and potions teacher, but Snape eventually accepted Harry as he was, especially when Harry made reference to the friendship between Snape and his mother. Throughout the year, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger tried all the different means to become his friend, but Harry ignored them royally. Fortunately for Hermione, when she was attacked by a troll, she was miraculously saved by Dumbledore before she could finish as a tapestry for the school.</p><p>He was still intrigued by the third floor corridor, and with Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott, he went to inspect the place. There he discovered a Cerberus, a dog with three heads, and being a passionate mythology since his childhood, he remembered the myth of Orpheus, then singing distractedly, which puts the dog to sleep. They quietly passed the hatch, and so fell into a plant, a Devil's trap, nothing but a simple <strong><em>Lumos Solem </em></strong>cannot arrange. For the Quidditch test, they let Draco take care of it, and when they had to face a Troll, they all used a <strong><em>Bombarda Maxima</em></strong> that literally exploded the troll</p><p>Harry finally faced a sort of magical chessboard, and being very clever, he easily managed to defeat the opposing King, passing through to the second last test, that of Severus Snape. Seeing that there was only enough potion for one person, it was Harry who swallowed the potion necessary to finally arrive at the last test.</p><p>Harry was surprised when he met Quirell, controlled by Voldemort there? He still managed to defeat him, and in a flash of genius, Harry hid the Philosopher's stone in a bag he had brought with him. He then destroyed the mirror, not seeing Voldemort's specter running straight at him, which made him faint.</p><p>Thus ended his first year, with winning the Cup of Four Houses, and stealing, under Dumbledore's eyes and beard, the Philosopher's Stone, which he later deposited in his vault at Gringotts, placing the goblins in the confidence.</p><p>During the summer Harry was invited by none other than Lucius Malfoy to spend his holidays at Malfoy Manor. He learned all he needed to know about his grandfather, and Lucius confessed to him the real reasons Voldemort had waged this war, for the suppression of magical anti-creature laws, as well as for the full integration of the muggleborns in the wizarding society by bringing them into the wizarding world much earlier, and preferably by permanently erasing the memory of the parents, so that the child can be adopted through a blood ritual in a wizarding family. Harry also discovered that his grandfather was a real genius, just like him, before he became completely mad after creating his many horcruxes and splinting his soul, which Lucius had previously explained to him. Moreover, Lucius did not hesitate to tell him that the Death Eaters were still active, but their loyalty was directly to Harry, since the Mark of the Death Eaters was in fact related to Voldemort's blood, and thus to Harry.</p><p>Following the discovery of Horcruxes, and the madness of Voldemort, they agreed to search and eliminate horcruxes, Lucius then revealed the Diary. He then explained to Harry that he was discreetly going to place it at the Wesley's house, so that they could take him to the Ministry and destroy him without raising any suspicions about the Malfoy.</p><p>Harry took the opportunity to inquire about Sirius Black, and discovered the absence of a trial. Now having doubts, he asked Lucius to organize if possible a trial, to be sure of his guilt. To make Harry's life easier, Lucius offered Dobby, a House Elf, to Harry.</p><p>The second year went quietly, except for the little problem with his grandfather's horcrux hidden in a diary, as the Weasley never noticed it, so Lucius' plan backfired a bit and endangered Harry and his own son. He discovered the Chamber of Secrets and Selene, the Basilisk of his ancestor, Salazar Slytherin. Unfortunately, he could not take advantage of it because he was joined in the Chamber by none other than Ginny Weasley, controlled by Voldemort and his Horcrux. Before she could react, Harry ordered the snake to destroy the Diary, immediately destroying the receptacle, and erased Ginny's memory.</p><p>To his astonishment, he was joined by Fawkes, who was carrying with him the Sorting Hat. He had his answer later, when Selene begged him to free her from this infernal and immortal life without her master. The sword of his ancestor, Godric Gryffindor, then appeared in the Sorting Hat, and with a lament from Fawkes, he pierced Selene's mouth, ending her days, parting with a last thank you for this mercy. The sword was soaked with her venom, but unfortunately Harry had pierced his arm with one of her fangs. Fortunately, Fawkes being close to him, could cry over his wound to heal him. Harry also discovered that he could now summon the Gryffindor sword whenever he saw fit.</p><p>For the rest of the year, Harry's relationship with Snape and the rest of the school (apart from Gryffindor because of Ron and Hermione) developed well, and during a duel, organized by their new teacher, Lockhart, his parseltongue ability was revealed to all. Of course, the Slytherins were ecstatic about this discovery, the Ravenclaws intrigued and curious, the Hufflepuffs thought nothing of it, and of course the Gryffindors accused him of being a dangerous Dark Wizard and the second coming of Voldemort (Ironic as Harry is Voldemort's grandson, but they didn't know this). So when the news spread through the Wizarding World, Harry, helped by Lucius, revealed that his mother was Slytherin's descendant, and that his father was the Gryffindor descendant.</p><p>It was a complete shock to the wizarding community, and many Gryffindors were uncomfortable after hearing that they badmouthed the descendant of their house founder. The year ended quietly, and Lockhart was arrested for sexual harassment and attempted rape of minors, which, at the same time, revealed his fraudulent works and caused Dumbledore's reputation for hiring him to fall deeply. It was after this fall in Dumbledor’s reputation that Lucius and Harry took this opportunity to seek a trial for Sirius Black, a trial that was quickly put in place, especially when Fudge discovered that he could gain a lot of glory by fixing the mistakes of his predecessors and, on top of that, destroy Dumbledore's reputation.</p><p>The trial was swift, and the Wizarding World was once again turned upside down when they learned that they had arrested an innocent person from the beginning, and especially when they learned that Dumbledore knew the truth perfectly, being the one who had set up the <strong><em>Fidelius</em></strong> . Following this, the old man lost his title of Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and his position as President of Wizengamot, keeping only his position as Headmaster of Hogwarts. It was a landslide victory for the dark side of the Wizengamot (and the grey side), even more so when they were officially joined by the House of Black with Sirius. They were also joined by the Houses of Potter, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Gaunt and Peverell when Sirius became Harry's magical guardian, with his permission and that of Petunia. In addition, Harry began living with Sirius at Grimmauld, and the encounter between him and the portrait of Walburga Black was memorable.</p><p>* Flashback *</p><p>
  <em>07/26/1992</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry decided to live with his godfather, Sirius Black, and was taken to Grimmauld Place, the Black's Ancestral Manor, hidden by a powerful <strong>Fidelius</strong> spell, along with other anti-muggle enchantments. Sirius told him as he opened the door.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Go on Harry, I'm sure you'll love living with me."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry chuckled before entering. No sooner had he set foot inside the old barracks that he noticed the state of disrepair and abandonment of the once splendid Manor. He sneezed due to so much dust, and was surprised by Kreacher, the Black House elf.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"The traitor to his blood is back! Oh, poor mistress is not going to be happy. The traitor has also brought a vile half-blood, poor, poor Kreacher. "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hardly had the elf finished speaking than Harry heard a shrill scream that made him jump, and startled Sirius at the same time.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What do you mean? Who dares enter the Abode of the Black? I hope it's not my traitor of a son! Show yourself! "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry, closely followed by Sirius who was intrigued to see how his godson was going to react, went to the stairs to find a portrait of a woman, Walburga Black. The portrait looked at Harry haughtily, before focusing on Sirius.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"How dare you enter here, traitor?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm in my home, mother! And whether you like it or not, I am the Lord of the House of Black so shut your trap! "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius answered with a certain vehemence. She stared at him before focusing on Harry. It was then that she saw my scar on her forehead.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What?! You dared bring an infamous half-blood here? Home? Shame on you, you degenerate son, I knew you were just a bum, a traitor! "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I am not a half-blood, you hateful shrew, and I advise you to shut up before I cast a strong <strong>Fienfyre </strong>on your ugly face and destroy your portrait and this wall!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry's answer froze Walburga. Sirius then asked how it was possible that he was not a half-blood.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"My mother was revealed as the daughter of Tom Marvolo Riddle and Melinda Rosier, making her a pureblood. Tom Marvolo Riddle best known to you by his pseudonym, Voldemort. "</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Only seconds later, Walburga begged Harry to forgive her, offering her total obedience, while Sirius froze. Harry then explained everything he knew, and Sirius was disgusted by all of Dumbledore's manipulations, swearing to make his life a nightmare. Immediately afterwards, Kreacher cleaned everything up, delighted to finally serve a true Black.</em>
</p><p>* Flashback end *</p><p>The third year was much simpler, and Harry met his first love, named Cedric Diggory, with whom he began to go out. He was also delighted to discover his new Defense against the Dark Arts professor, Remus Lupin, his "Uncle Moony". The latter was very happy to know that Sirius was innocent, and promised to join them at Grimmauld. There were no hiccups, and everything went perfectly, much to Harry's delight. Of course, there were still some problems with Ron and Hermione continuing to raise Gryffindor against him, not to mention Ginny Weasley who was a little too interested in him.</p><p>There was only one milestone in his third year, and it was not at Hogwarts but in Grimmauld. Indeed, he managed to communicate with Kreacher, especially when he was ordered by Walburga to obey him. He then discovered the existence of the Slytherin amulet, and did not hesitate a single second to destroy it with the Gryffindor sword, to the delight of the house elf who then swore his loyalty to him his last breath, to Sirius's biggest shock. So it was an event marking the beginning of the end for Voldemort.</p><p>During the summer of this third year, just before the fourth school year, Harry, Sirius and Remus were awarded VIP tickets for the Quidditch Championship, much to Harry's joy. Sirius was excited like a flea, just like Remus (although he cleverly concealed it).</p><p> </p><p> </p>
