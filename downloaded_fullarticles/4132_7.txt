<p>Snoggable</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Because I had to die,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Neville, seated beside him, blinked. “What?” </p>
<p>Harry turned towards him, smiling. “You asked why I went into the forest and turned myself over. That’s why.” </p>
<p>Neville stared at him. “But you didn’t. How—?” </p>
<p>“Voldemort left a piece of his soul inside me, so he had to kill it.” </p>
<p>Neville flinched at the name. “Merlin, no wonder you look—”</p>
<p>“Haunted?” Harry snorted. “Yeah, I’m still trying to wrap my head around the whole thing.” </p>
<p>Shivering, Neville reached out, clasping Harry’s hand. “Thanks.”</p>
<p>Harry raised an eyebrow. “For?” </p>
<p>“Being willing to sacrifice yourself for us.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“So, you and Harry, hm?” Ginny sat down next to Neville. </p>
<p>Neville blinked. “What?” </p>
<p>Ginny tossed her hair. “I saw you holding hands last night by the lake.” </p>
<p>Neville shook his head. “It’s not like that. I was just…He’d just told me something and I wanted to comfort him.” </p>
<p>Ginny snorted. “It didn’t look like just comfort to me.” She leaned in. “I think he likes boys, and I think he <i>especially</i> likes you.” </p>
<p>Neville frowned. “But you and he—”</p>
<p>“Aren’t together anymore.” Ginny winked. “Turns out, I like girls better than he does.” </p>
<p>Neville was distracted all day. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Where are Ron and Hermione?” </p>
<p>Harry, poking at the Flitterblooms, looked up. “They’re off snogging again.” He rolled his eyes. “Seems that’s all they do these days.” </p>
<p>Neville cleared his throat. “Does it bother you?” </p>
<p>“What, that they’re together?” Harry snorted. “They’ve been heading that way since second year, so…no.” </p>
<p>“And how about you?” Neville asked, keeping his eyes on the Fanged Geranium he was trimming. “Shouldn’t you be off snogging someone?” </p>
<p>“I think people are too scared to snog me,” Harry sighed. </p>
<p>“Then they’re mad,” said Neville. “You’re—”</p>
<p>“What? Snoggable?” </p>
<p>Neville could feel himself blushing. “Absolutely.” </p>
<p>“Prove it.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry turned out to be eminently snoggable, although after they knocked over several plants while kissing in the greenhouse, Neville insisted they snog elsewhere. </p>
<p>And so they did. </p>
<p>At first, Neville wasn’t sure Harry would tell people, but when he walked in on Ginny teasing Harry, and rushed to Harry’s defence, he figured the secret was out. </p>
<p>“They say Longbottom’s built like a Hippogriff,” sneered Malfoy one day at Quidditch. “That true, Potter?” </p>
<p>Everyone roared except Harry, who smirked, and Neville, who blushed. “Shame you’ll never find out,” purred Harry. “Although there’s a reason he’s called the sword of Gryffindor.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Did you see Malfoy’s face?” Ron chortled when they got back to the common room. “That was brilliant!”</p>
<p>Harry clung to Neville’s hand, and when no one seemed upset or surprised, Neville relaxed. “I almost said all Gryffindors have big swords,” Neville quipped, and everyone roared again.</p>
<p>Afterwards, as they all chatted quietly, Ginny whispered, “So, you and Harry, hm?” </p>
<p>Neville laughed. “And you and Luna.” </p>
<p>Ginny blinked. “What? No! I—”</p>
<p>“She <i>especially</i> likes you.” Neville grinned. </p>
<p>Ginny sighed. “Really?” </p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Luna, sitting down beside her and clasping her hand. </p>
<p>Neville beamed, leaning against Harry. All was well. </p>
