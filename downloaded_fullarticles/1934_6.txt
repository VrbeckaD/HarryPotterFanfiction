  <em> Or you won't own it anymore! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Instead you'll just own rips and slashes, </em>

  <em> Or perhaps, a pile of ashes. </em>

  <em><u> An Ode to Dicks</u> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You've said that I'm a dick </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'll take that as a compliment </em>
</p><p>
  <em> For without the noble dong </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Humanity would soon be gone </em>
</p><p>
  <em> There'd be no mothers up the duff </em>
</p><p>
  <em> No fathers left to knock them up </em>
</p><p>
  <em> People would stop procreating </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Pointless, fruitless, copulation </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Nothing left but humping dry </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I think that I would rather die </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Cos though my love of girls is true </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’ll admit a love for all dicks too </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Solid, probing, lovely cocks </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Keep them coming lots and lots </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I've no issue being called a dick </em>
</p><p>
  <em> A bell-end, knob-head or a prick </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Perhaps I'll call you something too </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Something honest, real and true </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Perhaps "wanker" would be a fit </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Certainly seems appropriate </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Considering your nocturnal fun </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Almost every night, (each one!) </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And you may ask how I know this </em>
</p><p>
  <em> It's cos your silence charms are shit </em>
</p><p>
  <em> So, see, I know you love a dick </em>
</p><p>
  <em> At least your own, The Chosen Prick </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Nice try, Potter, but I'm not vexed </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Choose a better insult next </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>You want to talk dicks</p><p>Like them in your arse, perhaps?</p><p>Join the fucking club</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Although I feel honoured, yes </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You chose to share with me </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The epic tale of your arse </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And divergent sexuality </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I didn't need any EVIDENCE </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You unbelievable heathen </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Your dick up his arse on my bed </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I could've done without seeing </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Do yourself, and me, a favour </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Or I'll punch you so hard in the face </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Do your dirty work elsewhere </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And never again in this space </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> And you can fucking tell Blaise </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm not his friend anymore </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Because we had an agreement </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And he broke it - bloody whore </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> And honestly, Potter, really, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm sure you can do better than him </em>
</p><p>
  <em> All he cares about is protein shakes </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And 'hitting it' at the gym </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>Blaise does have protein on the brain</p><p>That's how his muscles all sustain</p><p>Big long meat-probes</p><p>Salty come-loads</p><p>He likes it twice, then twice again</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I'm well aware of Blaise's kinks </em>
</p><p>
  <em> His appetites and thirsts </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Yes, you're flavour of the week </em>
</p><p>
  <em> But you were not his first </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>Oh wow, jealous much?</p><p>That perhaps you've been replaced?</p><p>Cry into your shoes</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Not at all, you fool </em>
</p><p>
  <em> He's no sense of commitment </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And terrible taste </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>Oh, so it's me then,</p><p>That's got inside you head?</p><p>Malfoy, <em> dearest </em>, really,</p><p>You know, you could've said.</p><p>Instead of simply dreaming,</p><p>Of me inside your bed.</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Oh, of course, Potter, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> My loins are all aflame </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Douse my dick with water </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Or kill me - it's the same </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I burn, I pine, I perish </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I exist for only you </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I love you, need you, oh baby </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Oh baby, it's all true </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> So cast your Blaise asunder </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And say you love me more </em>
</p><p><em> But most important, </em> <em> dearest </em></p><p>
  <em> Why’s there tea cups on the floor? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>There's a party tomorrow at the pub</p><p>It's the only reason I cleaned up</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Lord, if you're hooking up with him again </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Or perhaps some slattern witch </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Could you please not do it in our room? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Go fuck on the Quidditch pitch! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>Instead of whinging, come with me</p><p>I'm pretty sure that they serve tea</p><p>Pack your slippers up, old man</p><p>I'll teach you to have fun again</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I'm sorry I was in a mood </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm sorry that I ate your food </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm sorry that I mocked your mate </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm sorry that I punched your date </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm sorry you invited me </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm sorry that we had to leave </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm sorry I spewed on your coat </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I'm sorry, so I left this note </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>Are you sorry for anything else?</p><p>Can you remember what you said?</p><p>Because I can't forget.</p><p>Your confession’s like a spider’s web</p><p>It's stuck inside my head.</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Can we please forget that bit? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I think I feel enough like shit </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>Did you mean it?</p><p>
  <strike> Or did I dream it? </strike>

  <em> I am not a liar </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I am an idiot, though </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I can't take it back </em>
</p><p>
  <em> So can we let it go? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> (I'd appreciate as well </em>
</p><p>
  <em> If no one else could know) </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>Fuck everyone else</p><p>I want you to talk to me</p><p>Can we just be real?</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I’ve languished in a constant state of dread </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And looked uncounted days upon your hair </em>
</p><p>
  <em> There lives two truths of you I wish were dead </em>
</p><p>
  <em> One's that you hate me, two is my despair </em>
</p><p>
  <em> My tongue will tell the anger of my heart </em>
</p><p>
  <em> And rage against this curse of mine, the pain </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The turmoil you have made, and not took part </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Each glance you give me rips my breast again </em>
</p><p>
  <em> So sit me here to bleed among the waste </em>
</p><p>
  <em> As I'm the one in love, you see, a fool </em>
</p><p>
  <em> For loving one so deep among distaste </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I think I hate the most, myself, not you </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Are you the weakness in my very heart? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Or was I weak right from the very start? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>ᚔ</p><p> </p><p>Well, fuck - isn't that a piece of luck</p><p>Finally, your tongue's unstuck</p><p>I definitely do not hate your arse</p><p>Our room, tonight, after class</p><p>We best not fuck this up</p><p><br/>
