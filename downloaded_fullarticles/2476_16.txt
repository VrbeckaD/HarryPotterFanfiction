    <p>Sirius was sitting in the cold of his room, a piteous fire fluttering in the wastepaper bin by the door. He was wringing his hands together as he watched the flames engulf the paper, clenching his jaw as not to let the tears fall from hooded eyes. He could still make out James’ scrawled handwriting, and Remus’ neater script on the parchment before the flame grew and enveloped the letters entirely. Letters from his friends were what made his summers at home even slightly bearable. He was remined of this fact as his mother’s shrill voice echoed up the stairs, breaking the uneasy silence that never really left the Black household. As the parchment turned to ashes in the bottom of the bin, the adolescent extinguished the fire with a slight flick of his wand. He had received many letters over the course of the summer and each time a letter arrived, he went through the same procedure: open it, read it, burn it. The last step a precaution to prevent his family ever getting a hold of the letters, which would reveal the kind of person he truly was, rather than the façade that his family believed to be his honest personality.</p><p>Digging his nails into his palm to prevent tears from falling from closed eyes, Sirius lowered his head to his knees, attempting block out thoughts of his father’s stern face, and his cousins’ harsh words. He allowed better memories to flood in: receiving Christmas presents from Mr and Mrs Potter; gorging on sweets and gagging on firewhisky with Peter; Remus and James in their dorm room; skating on the frozen Black Lake in the dead of winter. He remembered the first time he’d managed to change into his animagi form, and the look of utter joy and relief on Remus’ face as he realised that he’d no longer have to transform alone. Peter’s way of managing to make them all laugh, even after a particularly tough full moon. Sirius thought back to James’ roaring laughter, and the way it always managed to get him smiling. He let his mind wander for a long while, until a smile had relaxed his face, along with his fists.</p><p>“Oi, Padfoot!” Sirius looked up from his seat on the train to see a familiar face grinning down at him from the door of the compartment. James entered the compartment with his usual casual saunter, plonking himself down next to his best friend.</p><p>“Alright?” James nodded in the affirmative in answer to Sirius’ question, his mouth already stuffed with Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. When Remus arrived, James was sprawled over one cushioned bench, while Sirius had his feet up on another, his back against the window. As Remus shuffled in, Sirius reflexively separated his legs, allowing Remus to sit between them and lean his head back against his friend’s collarbone. Both so unknowingly engrossed in each other, neither noticed James smirking at them, frustrated with their obliviousness.</p><p>The werewolf and his best friend began murmuring to each other in quiet words, and at some point, Sirius’ hands found their way into Remus’ hair, and they remained that way until they were interrupted by Peter’s entrance to the compartment.</p><p>By the time they all arrived at Hogwarts for the beginning of their fifth year, Sirius had almost forgotten about his life at home. Almost. He shook his head as the blocked those thoughts out and slung an arm around Remus’ shoulder; he didn’t notice the way Remus ducked his head and blushed at the action, but James did. He smiled to himself as the four of them disembarked the platform and climbed onto carriages pulled by thestrals that only Remus could see.</p><p>The sorting ceremony went as usual, each table piping up in cheers as a first year made the shy journey over to their designated table. Sirius cheered the loudest out of all the Marauders, if only because he remembered so clearly what it was like to be placed by the Sorting Hat. He remembered being so scared and unsure, staring down at the eager faces of young witches and wizards as he begged and bartered with the Hat to be placed anywhere, anywhere, but Slytherin. And then his wish had been acquiesced, and he, the first Black ever to do so, stalked over to the tale laden with red décor. He had realised, then, that he didn’t know a single person, and was about to take a seat at the end of the table, when a hand had grabbed his elbow, and a young boy with messy hair and round glasses had congratulated him heartily, and demanded that he sit with him and the lanky boy in the oversized jumper.</p><p>“Pads? There’s apple pie, want some?” Remus’ husky voice snapped Sirius out of his reminisces, and he gratefully accepted the plate of his favourite pudding. As always, Sirius also found himself appreciating Remus’ voice, and maybe (although he would never admit it) focusing on Remus’ smile for far longer than was strictly necessary. Remus’ smile. Sirius could talk about it, him, for days. And he’d never admit it, but he had the biggest fucking crush on the guy, and it was quickly becoming an issue, for three reasons. Firstly, the Black family weren’t what one would describe as accepting, in fact, they were about as narrow-minded as it was possible to be. Now, it’s not as if Sirius would miss them – they had done nothing but treat him like shit for the majority of his life (with the exception of Andromeda, and maybe Regulus). The only factor that was preventing Sirius turning up at the next family dinner with a pride flag draped around his shoulders, booty shorts that read ‘GAY AS FUCK’, with ABBA playing in the background, was the massive inheritance he was due to receive once his parents finally kicked the bucket.</p><p>The second reason that the ever-growing crush was an issue was that he didn’t think his mental health (or Remus’ for that matter) could quite handle it. With his frankly taxing family life, ongoing sexuality crisis, and the growing threat of war as pure blood families like his own rallied in unity against muggleborns, Sirius wasn’t sure if he could actually handle a rejection from Remus Lupin. The third reason was so cliché that Sirius mentally slapped himself for even thinking it, but he truly didn’t want to fuck up the friendship he had with Remus. He thought about how close they were, putting their behaviour down to a simply platonic friendship, oblivious to the fact that his feelings were entirely reciprocated. A lifetime of friendship with Remus was more than enough, and Sirius wasn’t about to throw that away for a crush. Well, maybe it was more than a crush, but nobody else needed to know that.</p><p>The first night back at school in September was always something. Sirius could never predict whether this would turn out to be a good or bad something, but on September 1st of their fifth year, it was a good something, and Sirius was immensely glad of that, because a good something was exactly what he needed. It was late. Late enough that most of the younger years had already made their way up to their shared dorms, and a mere handful of older Gryffindors lounged in the common room. Some sat on the plush, patterned bean bags next to the windows; some were sprawled on the sofas in the middle of the room, or, in the case of Sirius and his friends, on the floor in the gentle heat of the crackling fireplace. Sirius had his back leaning against the sofa, facing the fire, and his hands in Remus’ hair, whose head lay in Sirius’ lap. Remus’ long legs stuck out at angles, one of them bent at the knee, and the other pressing against James’ shoulder. James was sat uncomfortably close to the fireplace, and all he could hear was Peter crunching popcorn next to him, but there was no way in hell he was going to move and disrupt the scene before him.</p><p>“So, muggles really believe that a fairy flies into kids’ rooms at night, steals their teeth, and leaves cash behind?” James sounded incredulous as he questioned Remus on muggle traditions, and Sirius chuckled at how shocked Remus sounded in his reply.</p><p>“Prongs, we’ve been friends for five years-”</p><p>“Unfortunately.” James interjected, earning himself a pillow to the head.</p><p>“Unfortunate on my part too, mate. Anyway, tooth fairy. James, how the fuck have you known me for five years and still claim to never have heard of the tooth fairy.”</p><p>“To be fair, Prongs,” Peter piped up from his position closest to the fireplace, “not knowing about the tooth fairy is like never hearing of Babbity Rabbity.”</p><p>“Yeah, but at least Babbity Rabbity is somewhat believable!”</p><p>“Not if you’re a muggle.” Listening to the others continue the playful argument – “don’t you dare bring up fucking Father Christmas, Lupin, that dude’s about as creepy as it gets” – Sirius quite suddenly realised that he was getting tired, and his reply lacked the usual punch that his comments normally held, but to be fair to him, it had been a long day, and the clock proved that it had now passed into September 2nd. It was somewhat of a tradition for the Marauders to do that – stay up and watch one day pass into the next. Sirius appreciated it; starting the day with his friends felt like he was fully saying goodbye to the horrid Black household, at least until the next summer. The only downside: they all needed a metric fuckton of coffee the next day to function through hours of transfiguration, potions, and, worst of all, history of magic.</p><p>As he did with most lessons, Sirius spent most of the time staring at Remus’ too pretty face. The face in question was marred with a pretty impressive scar that stretched from his eyebrow all the way down to his jawline, but Sirius had spent so much time around Remus that he barely even registered it anymore. His eyes focused on Remus’ messy eyebrows that were partially hidden under even messier hair. Green-grey eyes glittered like sea glass in the late afternoon sun and Sirius found himself wondering how such a colour was even possible. As usual, Remus was everything that was unique and beautiful and Sirius was never much of a one for art, bit give him a brush and some paint and Sirius was pretty sure he could recreate Remus from memory alone. James noticed him staring, and, as he always did, smirked and rolled his eyes, but still said nothing. He’d just complain about it to his mum later in his weekly owls home (<em>“She misses me Padfoot, shut it, alright? Also, you need to write something here too.”</em>)</p><p>Due to Sirius’ extensive home schooling, he knew most of what was being taught already (in all subjects except muggle studies, of course), so he had rolls and rolls of parchment that contained snippets of poetry, rather than notes on the wand movement of silent spells. The poetry wasn’t good by any means, in Sirius’ opinion, which is why he hid the poems in a small box under his bed, concealed with a charm that had taken him a month to perfect, to ensure that no one ever read them. There was an extensive variety of poems; abstract prose about how the rain fell that day; sonnets about the way Remus had laughed at a joke; limericks for James when he was being a knob. It was somewhat of a release, Sirius found, to write about shit, even if no one would ever read it, it made him feel a little better that it was on paper, rather than just in his head.</p>
