    <p>A man with black hair and a messed up nose turned around the corner and met up with a cat sitting near a sign that said 'Privet Drive'. He got a silver cigarette lighter out and lit a cigarette...then, used it to steal all of the lights from the street lamps.</p>
<p>"What're you doing 'ere, McGonagall?" The satanist asked as the cat transformed into a woman with square glasses, her black hair tied back into a bun, and wearing an emerald cloak.</p>
<p>"How did you know it was me?"</p>
<p>"How could I tell it was <em>not</em> you? Where's Hagrid?" Before McGonagall could answer, the sound of engine was heard, and there was Hagrid, landing his flying motorcycle. He stepped out, the man with the cigarette rushing over to Hagrid.</p>
<p>"Well, where is 'e?"</p>
<p>"Right 'ere." Hagrid said, taking a baby wrapped in a blanket out of the back of the motorcycle. He handed him to the man with the messed up nose, who blew cigarette smoke in the baby's face, the baby coughing in return.</p>
<p>"There won't be a wizard who won't know his name...and we're leaving him with Muggles so he can be safe, yet tortured. I'll see him again in eleven years, don't worry." The man dropped the baby off at the Muggle's doorway with a note, but before he could leave, McGonagall said</p>
<p>"The boy's parents just died and you're going to leave him here?!"</p>
<p>"They're the last remaining family he has...and if he grows up like this, he'll have the same nightmare childhood I had and we could connect more so he can eventually save the world." Confused, McGonagall asked</p>
<p>"Niccals, what do you mean-" But Niccals apparated away,</p>
<p>"Augh, that man is so selfish. Why did he become headmaster?!" McGonagall cried, turning towards Hagrid. He shrugged and went back on his motorcycle, leaving the worried Professor.</p>
<p>"Tsk, men."</p>
