  <em> <strong> <span class="s1">1.</span> </strong> </em>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the things Albus loved the most about Gellert was his tendency to get enthusiastic over the simplest, most ordinary aspects of life. The way his eyes would widen slightly in awe whenever he saw a beautiful sunset, or Albus performed a particularly difficult spell, or they went near the lake and the sun’s reflection would dance on its surface and hit the water </span> <span class="s2"> <em>just right</em>. He was usually calm and composed, but sometimes he would just... lit up, and it was something Albus dearly cherished.</span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Something he didn’t love was, however, being woken up at five in the morning by his partner for that exact same reason.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus heard the familiar sound of apparition permeating his mind still foggy with sleep, followed by the gentle breeze that usually accompanied it. He groaned and pulled his pillow over his ears in an attempt to muffle the noise and get back to sleep. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Gellert had other plans, apparently.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The redhead was just beginning to drift off again when he felt the other person in his room coming closer to the bed. Normally, that would excite him (for obvious reasons), but now, with barely four hours of sleep on his shoulders, he really didn’t want to hear whatever it was that had spiked his lover’s interest this time.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The younger wizard sat in front of his bed and proceeded to slowly free his ears from the pillow, his left hand coming to rest on Albus’ head soon after. Albus leaned sleepily into the touch and heard a faint, heartwarming chuckle coming from the other boy in response. He felt Gellert’s fingers starting to run through his hair, and suddenly he couldn’t remember why he was so adverse to being woken up before dawn to begin with. He sighed contentedly and let himself be cared for for a while. </span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">He loved the way Gellert made him feel, with his fingers tracing lazy shapes on his head, or by simply being close to him, really. He felt warm, serene and just so </span> <span class="s2"><em>loved</em>. It was a nice feeling, one that made his heart sing and flutter in the most pleasant way.</span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Albus?” Gellert said in a low voice, his ministrations coming to a stop. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t stop, ‘s nice,” Albus mumbled, earning another light chuckle that made him smile despite his somewhat still hazy state. Gellert resumed his previous activity, and the room grew silent for a while once more, with the two of them simply enjoying each other’s company.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus felt Gellert’s hand hesitating again for a moment, meaning that he was about to tell him the reason behind his early visit. He pretended not to notice, giving his boyfriend the time he needed to gather the courage to talk. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He heard a deep intake of breath and then, “Would you... would you like to watch the sunrise with me, lieber? Only if you want to. I’m sorry for waking you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus’ eyes shot open in surprise, his heart literally melting. Gellert wasn’t looking at him, his eyes fixed on an indefinite spot on the left side of his room. He loved these rare moments of uncertainty where Gellert was not a genius, a strategist or a brilliant wizard, but simply him, a sixteen year old boy who wanted to share a moment of intimacy with his boyfriend but was afraid of rejection, of being made fun of, even though he knew Albus would never do either of those things. As if he could deny him anything. It was cute.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A fond smile made its way to his lips. “Of course, liebling, just give me a few moments,” he whispered, propping himself up on one elbow so that he could kiss Gellert properly on the lips. It was a gesture of reassurance, to tell him that it was okay to ask, that he didn’t mind being woken up if it was to spend some time with him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After they parted, Gellert nodded. “Alright,” he agreed, leaning closer once more to press a kiss on his forehead instead.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">***</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They apparated on the hill near Godric’s Hallow less than ten minutes later, the deep blue of the night sky already beginning to fade, shifting to the lighter color that always preceded sunrise.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The two settled there, on the grass (conveniently dried off with magic), Gellert sitting against a tree with Albus between his legs. The blond’s arms soon encircled the other’s waist, and Albus’ own hands promptly covered his. It was chilly outside, but neither of them minded, content in their personal little bubble, warming each other up with the heat of their bodies, while the sun slowly made its way into the morning sky.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Albus turned slightly and nuzzled his nose against the crook of his lover’s neck.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Gellert... I may be insane, but I think I’m in love with you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was the first time he said those words out loud, but even though he had been certain of his feelings before, he hadn’t imagined just how </span> <span class="s2"><em>right </em>voicing those feelings would actually feel.</span></p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Gellert gently kissed the top of his head and held him a little tighter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re lucky we’re both insane, then,” he whispered softly, for only the two of them to hear.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That was enough.</span>
</p><p> </p>
