          <div class="userstuff"><p>Clearing his throat the Narrator spoke in a deep baritone as he read the lines off the page in his hand (not that he had hands since he was body-less voice floating in the ether).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Once upon a time, in a land far far away, there was a location referred to by its residents as the Archive. This was due to the fact that it was neither here nor there but also everywhere at once.”</p><p>As the Narrator spoke, a butterfly flew in to view and drifted down before alighting on the shoulder of a woman with long flowing locks. Dressed in red and blue, with gold embellishments, she was athletically beautiful but additionally, her presence commanded an air of distinction.</p><p>“That’s a very confusing introduction,” Diana Prince said. “Why don’t you just say that this world is the work of the imagination? And while you’re at it, you could mention that the population here is both real and imaginary while encapsulating every variation of ourselves.”</p><p>“He’s not going to do that,” announced a man that had somehow appeared from a blue phone box that had just materialized out of thin air. “And I’ll tell you why.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Diana replied, her brow furrowed. “Have we meant before?”</p><p>“Yes,” replied the man with the cool hair and donning a pair of 3D glasses. “But not in this particular time stream. And that is what our dear Narrator isn’t going tell you or the readers sitting behind their phones, computers, and tablets reading this. We all co-exist in multiple time streams that overlap and intertwine in a timey-wimey wibbily-wobbily fashion. The thing is that this place is both canon and non-canon while existing in its theoretical universe and alternative universes as well. See what I mean?”</p><p>“Makes sense,” Diana said. “However, I don’t quite know if the readers understand.</p><p>“Here,” the man said, walking back to his box, “follow me and we can show them together.</p><p>“I don’t even know your name.”</p><p>“Well, I know who you are. You’re Wonder Woman. And I’m the Doctor.”</p><p>“Doctor who?”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Gripping the lasso at her side tightly, she followed him through the door and suddenly found herself in a large room and at its center stood some sort of cylindrical console making a whooshing noise.</p><p>“It’s bigger on the inside,” she stated.</p><p>“Yes. Indeed it is,” he said as he leaned against the central paneling and his elbow accidentally hit a lever.</p><p>Loud noises and deep bangs filled the space as the entire room seem to jostle about.</p><p>“Oops,” said the Doctor as he checked the screen. “Where did we go?”</p><p>“Are we out of the Archive?” Diana asked.</p><p>“No. Once you’re in the Archive you can never escape. But it’s a wonderful place so why would you want to?”</p><p>“So where are we?”</p><p>“Um,” mumbled the Doctor, “let’s have look.”</p><p>Pushing open the door, he peeked his head out and looked around.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Seeing two men at a dining table, one with dark curls and glasses and the other older and dressed so very elegantly, the Doctor stepped out and inquired as to his present location.</p><p>“Baltimore, Maryland,” replied the older man who’s facial structure was very distinct. “I am Doctor Hannibal Lecter and this is my college, Will Graham. Would you care to join us for dinner?”</p><p>Fumbling with the inner pocket of his long overcoat, the Doctor pulled out his sonic screwdriver and pointing it at the delectable food on the table. It only took one look at the device and the Doctor’s face fell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You know what? I think I left my oven on back in 1985, I better go check on that,” the Doctor said as he backed a hasty retreat.</p><p>Climbing inside of his TARDIS once more, the Doctor pulled Wonder Woman back as he shut the doors.</p><p>“Who was that?” she asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Murder Husbands,” replied the Doctor with a shudder as he quickly ran to the console before flipping a few gears and pulling the lever, this time on purpose.</p><p>Once more the strange larger-on-the-inside-box whirled and whined before landing someplace new.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Alrighty then,” the Doctor exclaimed with glee, “I think we’re at the right place now. Allons-y!”</p><p>“Diana was growing restless,” the Narrator narrated. “Still, she never was one to back away from a challenge. And this Doctor fellow certainly was challenging.”</p><p>“We can hear you, you know,” the Doctor shouted up at the void.</p><p>“Hear who?” asked a man who had pulled open the TARDIS door.</p><p>“Tony,” the Doctor greeted the man as he and Diana exited into a spacious room where a small group was gathered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hiya, Doc.”</p><p>“Is this Malibu?”</p><p>“It is,” Tony answered. “We were just playing a game of a <em>Man Who Would Not Be King</em>. Care to join us?”</p><p>“Brilliant,” replied the Doctor as he made his way between chairs to settle himself on a couch next to a handsome man with long blonde hair, greeting everyone as he went. “Bruce, Thor, Steve, Natasha, Clint, James, and Robin. Did I forget anyone?”</p><p>“It’s Agent Hill,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the dark-haired woman replied. “Not Robin.”</p><p>“Sorry,” the Doctor replied. “Sometimes going through regenerations scrambles my memory.”</p><p>“And you are?” Tony asked, extending his hand to Diana.</p><p>“Out of your league,” she said, eyeing him carefully, “and out of your universe.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Doctor was distracted as he too was taking a turn at the game of trying to lift the oversized hammer off of a coffee table.</p><p>“So, Thor, if I lift this,” he postulated, “I then rule Asgard? I’d like to take that Bifrost for a ride.”</p><p>“No, no,” Thor explained. “For that, you’d need Heimdall’s sword, Hofud.”</p><p>“What is it with your people and odd names?” Natasha enquired.</p><p>“Magic and science,” the Doctor huffed as he exerted himself trying to lift the hammer, “both the same thing and both pre-occupied with pretentious names.”</p><p>Still unable to move the weapon, the Doctor pulled out his sonic screwdriver and pointed at the hammer.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Bruce asked.</p><p>“I’m trying to reverse the polarity of the neutron flow.”</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing sound went off and Tony looked around in slight bewilderment before pulling a device out of his pocket.</p><p>“Oh,” the Doctor announced. “That’s our cue to leave. Good luck with your robots, Tony. Give me a call if they start chanting ‘delete’ over and over again.”</p><p>“Huh? I don’t have your number.”</p><p>“In that case,” the Doctor replied as he pulled Tony’s smartphone from the man’s jacket, “can I borrow this?”</p><p>Some sort of dilapidated droid was making its way to the room and the Doctor grabbed Diana’s hand and beat a hasty exit to the blue box. Closing the door quickly behind them, the Doctor flew to the controls and set them in motion once more.</p><p>“So,” the Doctor explained, as he took the phone and placed it on the console so Diana could plainly see the screen, “the reason we are here is because of this.”</p><p>“The Doctor pulled up the internet browser on the phone and open a website,” the Narrator said from above.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I know what I’m doing,” the Doctor said looking upward.</p><p>“Just trying to do my job,” the Narrator grumbled.</p><p>Ignoring the both of them, Diana explained for the benefit of those in the proximity of her voice, “So this is the Archive, a place for fan-created works, mostly creative fiction but a few other mediums as well.”</p><p>“I’m partial to the fan art,” the Doctor added. “Though sometimes it’s hard to view on a mobile device if the creator doesn’t know to adjust the width in the html settings. It has to be set at a percentage.”</p><p>Rolling his proverbial eyes, the Narrator groaned at the author’s poor attempt at tongue in cheek humor.</p><p>“You know what would be fun,” the Doctors suggested, taking the phone and transferring the data to the TARDIS. “If we were able to take a walk through the Archival grounds.”</p><p>“But the Archive isn’t a physical place,” Diana replied. “So how are we supposed to do that?”</p><p>“Like so,” the Doctor replied, with a flip of a switch.</p><p>Then everything immediately ground to a stop.</p><p>“I swear,” a short blonde man said as he opened the entry door and he along with his lanky companion entered the TARDIS, “if you use the word ‘elementary’ one more time in my presence, I’m going to take it and shove it up your—“</p><p>Clearing his throat, the tall man interrupted, “John. Where are we?”</p><p>Glancing around, John suddenly realized where they were.</p><p>“Sherlock,” John muttered looking around, “Weren’t we just on Earls Court Road a second ago?”</p><p>“Mmm?” Sherlock puzzled as he was too busy taking every minute detail of his surroundings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Clearing his throat the Doctor walked forward and ushered the two men back out of the room. Mumbling something about how the two weren’t supposed to be here until one of them jumped off of a building.</p><p>“Sorry,” the Doctor apologized to Diana as he closed the door. “The lock’s broken. Now, where were we?”</p><p>“You wanted to take a walk through the Archive.”</p><p>“Oh, yes. That’s right. Shall we?” he asked extending his arm.</p><p>Smiling bemusedly, Diana took it and the two of them exited the TARDIS only to find themselves in a brightly lit hallway extending forward into an infinitesimal beyond. Thousand upon thousand of doors lined the corridor and both the Doctor and the Amazonian looked on in amazement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Let me guess,” Diana said, “though each of these doors is a different universe?”</p><p>“Yes and no,” the Doctor answered. “Each door is a work in the Archive. Some of them led to known universes and other alternate universes. Many of them even led to the same universe. And this corridor is how we get to them, it’s called the Index.”</p><p>“What’s this one?” She asked opening the first door on her left.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A dark figure dressed all in black and wearing a mask growled in a tone so low it was like the man had gargled with gravel, “I’m Batman.”</p><p>Quickly shutting the door, Diana laughed, “Never mind, I already know that one.”</p><p>“What about this one?” the Doctor inquired as he opened one on the right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A tall man with shaggy hair sat on the hood of a black 1967 Chevy Impala, his back turned to the two men making out in the back seat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Cheers, Sam,” the Doctor called. “Dean and Castiel still going at it?”</p><p>“Yep,” Sam replied.</p><p>“Everyone still ignoring you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“For the most part, unless… you know…”</p><p>“Say no more,” the Doctor replied as he closed the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Do you know everyone?” Diana questioned.</p><p>“Yes, he does,” the Narrator butted into the conversation. “Good ol’ number 10 here shows up pretty much everywhere.”</p><p>“Oh come off it,” the Doctor grumbled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Opening another door, Diana asked, “So do you know these people?”</p><p>“That’s Dragon Age,” the Narrator answered. “Care to guess how many times he’s had encounters with The Warden as his friends?”</p><p>“Loghain Mac Tir is not my friend,” the Warden retorted from his/her side of the door.”</p><p>“At the moment, 42,” the Narrator announced, answering his own question.</p><p>“Don’t Panic,” the Doctor replied as he shut the door on the Warden. “Ha ha, very funny.”</p><p>“Do you do happen to do a lot of cross-overs?” Diana asked the Doctor.</p><p>“I’ve been around longer than most,” the Doctor replied with a shrug. “It just kind of happens.”</p><p>Trailing down the hallway, Diana and the Doctor took turns opening doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh dear,” Wonder Woman exclaimed upon opening the door to the Land of Waves. “Was this what you were talking about when you said some people don’t know how to size images correctly?</p><p>

</p><p>“Unfortunately, yes. Naruto here seems to be far too large to view on mobile,” the Doctor replied pulling out his sonic and pointing towards the image. “But fear not, it is an easy fix. Just erase the height and change the width to 100% and violà!”</p><p>

</p><p>“Well done,” Diana said approvingly.</p><p>The Doctor merely shrugged his shoulders and moved onto the next door.</p><p>Just minutes after fixing Uzumaki Naruto’s size issue, they were in 21st century South Korea,” the Narrator explained, “standing next to a stage watching BTS perform, a rather exciting place to be. However, the story they were in ended rather abruptly as it was a work-in-process. Ergo, the pair made their way back to the Archival Index.”</p><p>“<em>Take it Take it</em>,” Diana hummed along with a whistle on her lips as they exited the world of K-Pop.</p><p>A few doors down they found themselves in a room packed with people and creatures, many of whom were wearing uniforms.</p><p>“Oh, so this is a cross-over,” Diana announced loudly above the noise.</p><p>“I think you’re right,” the Doctor shouted back as the two pushed their way forward to the center of the room to see what all the commotion was about.</p><p>Suddenly, the room went silent as the event began.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A tall man with pointy ears and arched brows faced off against an older gentleman with a gray beard and a hood over his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the older man said, “These are not the droids you’re looking for.”</p><p>Feeling the need to be useful, the Narrator dictated, “The steely-eyed man from the planet Vulcan was not moved and his gaze stayed steady.”</p><p>“Ignore everything, Spock,” a man next to the Vulcan urged. “I’ve got a lot riding on this bet so you better not mess it up, you green-blooded hobgoblin.”</p><p>“Is that completely necessary Bones?” a bald man in a red captain’s uniform scolded in his British accent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hey, Picard,” said another man. “Keep quiet man. This is between us originals and I’m the captain here.”</p><p>A very large hairy creature behind the old man added to the conversation, “RAWRGWAWGGR.”</p><p>“Ease up, Chewy,” said the handsome man next to the creature. “If the old man can’t hack it you can rip the other guy’s arms off.”</p><p>His eyes going wide, the Doctor motioned to Diana that they better leave before they found themselves in an unpleasant situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Whew,” the Doctor sighed once they had left the multi-alternative universe that held the creatures that lived in galaxies far far away and boldly went where no man had gone before.</p><p>“I think we need to pick an easier one.”</p><p>“Okay… how about here,” the Doctor said as he opened a door.</p><p>“Oh,” Diana said with a gasp, looking around at the world they had entered. Stone walls towered around them, adorned in painting that appeared to be moving. The staircases leading to the upper floors were moving as well. “It’s so magical.”</p><p>“That’s because we are at Hogwarts,” the Doctor grinned. “I like to come here and relax.”</p><p>“Relax?!” A young girl with frizzy brown hair asked as she approached them. “Who has time for relaxing? This is a school. We are here to study.”</p><p>“Hello Hermione,” the Doctor greeted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How do you know who I am?” Hermione asked cautiously.</p><p>“Time-turner,” the Doctor replied as he pulled a small circular mounted hour-glass from his pocket. “We’re from the future.”</p><p>“Okay,” Hermione said with a shrug. “Well, if you want to relax, go outside and walk the grounds.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Diana said, we might just do that.</p><p>A few minutes later, the Doctor and the Woman of Wonder found themselves wandering around the grassy knolls of Scotland. It was a lovely day and the breeze was blowing softly, stirring up earthly scents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hmm,” Diana hummed. “This is lovely.”</p><p>“It really is the best,” the Doctor added.</p><p>As they wandered, they came upon a forested area and decided to travel beyond the line of trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Picking their way through the brush, Diana asked, “That time-turner, does it really take you back in time.”</p><p>“Yes,” noted the Doctor as he pulled it out along with his sonic. “And if you adjust the settings, it can take you to other universes.”</p><p>“We’ve been to so many already,” Diana quipped, “what’s a few more?”</p><p>“There might be some fandoms you want to avoid,” the Narrator interjected.</p><p>“Such as?” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“The one with the sparkly vampires,” answered the Narrator.</p><p>“One does not simply mention that particular foray into literature and film without stirring up strong opinions,” the Doctor noted with a grin as he gave his altered time-turner a spin.</p><p>The golden hourglass twirled in its intricate framework but nothing happened.</p><p>“That’s odd,” he noted. “Let’s turn back and go through the hallway again.”</p><p>“However, as they traveled,” the Narrator narrated, “they soon found that the edge of the forest had disappeared. The trees went on and on. The once lovely day turned cold and snow began to mount on the ground before them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Seeing her breath form in the air before her Diana asked, “Doctor, where have you taken us?”</p><p>“Oh, no,” the Doctor remarked, looking back at her. “Winter is coming.”</p><p>An unnatural chill ran up her spine and Diana turned around. Behind them in the woods were figures standing still. Figures with bright blue eyes. Figures that were not entirely whole. Figures of animated dead men, women, and children.</p><p>“Doctor,” Diana whispered, “what should we do?”</p><p>“Basically… RUN!”</p><p>The pair spared no time in fleeing from the dead men, snaking through trees and dodging branches. And as they ran, the Doctor had taken in time-turner in his hand one more time and was spinning it frantically.</p><p>One spin.</p><p>Two spins.</p><p>Three spins.</p><p>A wave of hot air slammed into them as they pushed out of the woods and climbed a hill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But the dead were still coming.</p><p>Reaching the top of the hill, the pair realized they were surrounded. The dead all around moving slowly but still forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The fear in the air was palpable and the Doctor and Diana stood back to back. For unlike their canon counterparts, that lived on an on in different reboots and mediums, for characters in alternative universes death was a very real possibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Thankfully, the Doctor knew his way around this sort of situation. Time slowed as the Doctor readjusted the setting on the time-turner and rewound the clock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This is getting to be too much,” Diana lamented, sinking to the ground. “Where are we? But more importantly, how do we get out of here?”</p><p>Shrugging, the Doctor replied, “We walk.”</p><p>A short while later, Diana found herself trudging behind the Doctor on a dirt road. They continued on this road for what seemed like hours until the tell-tale sign of billowing dirt indicated a vehicle coming in their direction.</p><p>When the vehicle, which turned out to be an RV, approached, the Doctor waved it down. Grinding to a halt, a seasoned and worn looking man got out and walked up to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Not batting an eye the man said, “Three questions: How many walkers have you killed? How many people have you killed? And why?”</p><p>“Erm,” the Doctor said, wrinkling his nose and squinting his eyes, “you know what? I think it’s best if we just pretend like this never happened.”</p><p>“Wha—“</p><p>“A TARDIS NAMED SEXY!” the Time Lord shouted as he and Diana were enveloped in a cloud of green smoke.</p><p>Coughing, Wonder Woman waved her hand in front of her face. Blinking against the green flecks floating in the air, she realized that she and the Doctor had returned to the interior of the TARDIS.</p><p>“How?” she wondered.</p><p>“Eh,” the Doctor shrugged, “I knicked some floo powder back at Hogwarts. I didn’t think it would work but I figured it would be better than sticking around in that miserable place.”</p><p>“Why you…,” Diana grumbled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She had had enough. Stalking over to the TARDIS door, she pulled it open. As she did so, two young men fell in past the door and into her legs, bowling her over.</p><p>The younger man, practically a kid, disentangled himself from the heap before helping Diana to her feet.</p><p>“Sorry,” he apologized. “Derek and I were just waiting for the Doctor when—“</p><p>“Nope,” Diana proclaimed. “I don’t want to hear it. I’m done.”</p><p>“And with that closing statement,” the Narrator said, “Wonder Woman left the TARDIS.”</p><p>“Derek, Stiles,” the Doctor said coming round, still brushing green dust off his overcoat. “What can I do for you?”</p><p>Derek, with his piercing green eyes, said nothing.</p><p>Stiles, on the other hand, was quick to respond, launching into some sort of explanation about alphas, betas, and omegas.</p><p>“Oh dear,” the Doctor remarked to Derek, “it seems to me that you’ve been a bad wolf.”</p><p>“Gee Willikers, is this where this story is going? You know what, I’ve had enough,” the Narrator said with a grimace. “I’m out of here.”</p><p>As a gust of wind rattled the still-open door of the TARDIS, a leaf from a nearby tree was released from the near barren branch where it had hung. This leaf was the last of its fellows, having turned a golden-yellow. Its edges curling inward, the crisp piece of foliage was born aloft by that same wind that sent it spiraling downwards. And yet, where it should’ve met the ground, it did not. Instead, it continued downwards through the nothingness ether.</p><p>While the scene panned through the ineffable mists of the ether, the leaf was lost from view. It was all swirling chaos until at long last everything came to a standstill. The world around focused on a group of nine individuals. Calling them all men would be inaccurate since these persons were clearly of different races. There was an old man, dressed in gray robes and holding a staff. Another was a tall lean figure with the bluest eyes and pointy ears. The other seven males ranged in both size and stature. They sat in a dusty and war-torn room, covered in the signs of a long lost battle and the echos of time.</p><p>“Do you think the author has forgotten about us?” a hobbit asked as he fiddled with a band of gold between his dirty and nail-bitten fingers.</p><p>“I doubt it,” came the grumbling tones of the wizard. “We were a favorite... once.”</p><p>“No,” the Narrator explained, “the author hasn’t forgotten. Just been rather distracted of late.”</p><p>“Does this mean we have come to an end then,” Gimli asked.</p><p>“End? No, the journey doesn’t end here,” Gandalf answered. “This story is concluding but there are many paths yet to be explored. Stories left unread or unwritten that, in time, will take the place of this one. Such is the nature of things.”</p><p>“Well, said,” concluded the Narrator as he closed the non-existent book he held in his incorporeal hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>THE END</p></div>
