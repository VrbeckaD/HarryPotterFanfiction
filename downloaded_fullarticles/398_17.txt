    <p>The ring gleamed slightly in the soft light, twisting and turning on her finger as she focused on it with rapt attention.</p><p>"We're really doing this?"</p><p>There's a slight pause after she says this, and she looks up to him, his face apprehensive and - not <em>heartbroken</em>, but veering on the edge of it. Less sure than he usually is. Almost unnervingly scared. She softens her gaze and takes his hand into hers, rubbing it slightly with her fingers, relishing in the feeling of his slightly calloused fingers against hers. She didn't mean for it to sound so much like a question. It wasn't. Not really.</p><p>"I'm glad."</p><p>There's a flicker of joy on his face as she says this, another level of assurance she wasn’t aware he needed. Her boyfriend, fiancée now, she supposes, takes her hand palm up and presses a kiss to it. Lily moves to stand from the makeshift table, twisting her hand so she can grab on to him and drags him to the open side of the tower. Sitting down, she leans against him and looks out on to the quiet field, a cold breeze caressing her face.</p><p>Nothing could disturb tonight.</p><p>She feels his arm wrap around her shoulder, a slight moment before she's squeezed closer to his side. She presses a slight kiss to his shoulder, seeing the look of pure adoration, wonderment and disbelief on his face before turning to the night sky again. She recognises some constellations, vaguely recalls their names, but her skills in Astronomy were rusty and left in the dust since she dropped the subject after her OWLs.</p><p>She thinks that it would be nice if their story was worth noting through the celestial bodies. If their love was a love recalled centuries later in history books, as pure and unyielding. Something that changed history. She already felt like this passion between them could make and unmake the world, a consuming fire that could re-forge the stars if it chose to. If they chose to.</p><p>Lily paused in her thoughts, turning to James who looked equally distracted, lost in thought. She quirked a smile as she saw the soft furrow of his brow, the gentle lilt in his lips and the shine in his eyes that was always there when he thought about them. About her. With him by her side, it felt like it wouldn't matter if she didn't make it amongst the pages of history books to come. Her ambitions didn't disappear. No, they made too large a part of her and he was well too aware of it. But, with him, her ambitions shifted. No longer was she seeking purely respect and admiration. Not when she had him. Now, she was looking for something different, though what it was exactly she couldn't say.</p><p>She nudged her head against the nape of his neck, closing her eyes and feeling his pulse beneath her lips, the shift in his body as he felt her come back to him from her stargazing. He hesitated, before placing a neatly woven ring of ivy entwined with myrtle on the crown of her head.</p><p>"From now till we part?"</p><p>The words are uncharacteristically soft. Much like everything about him this week. Still, every new side of him made her fall deeper in love. Every single aspect that he revealed to her, making her more engrossed with the man she had the pleasure to call <em>hers</em>. She was his and he was hers till the end of time. She’d have it no other way.</p><p>"From now till forever. So long as you'll have me." She pauses then, shifting herself up so that her forehead is touching his, their breathing mingling in the sharp night air.</p><p>She hears him rather than sees him, feels his breath on her face, the soft press of his lips on her lips, her nose, her eyelids, her forehead. The top of her head.</p><p>"Always."</p><p>They stay still for a moment. The world quiet around them, almost like they were the only two who existed. The only ones who mattered. She wasn't good with her words. Lily was far better at reading the words of others or logically presenting facts.</p><p>Still, it seemed that what she said what he needed because that thrice-damned boyish smirk showed on his face again after several beats. The one that came with the sharp rise in his lips and that dark<em>, oh so dark</em>, wanting look in his eyes. She loved to hate it. His face lit up in that way that was pure James with that look, and he pulled her into a kiss far deeper than the soft pecks and presses of lips they've exchanged today. Everything around them melted away as they melted into each other. Two temporarily becoming one, souls intertwining and joining in a heavy moment, hands holding on for the feel of warm flesh and lips searching for each other in the stillness of the night.</p><p>Neither of them noticed the slight shift in the tower as the words were said, the flicker of the conjured lights from a soft white glow to the palest of blues flecked with silver. The rise of the temperature by ten degrees for three seconds. The soft hum that vibrated in the air upon their first contact.</p><p>Tonight, all they cared to notice or remember was a golden ring, a starry sky and whispered words of devotion.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>As usual, on a Sunday, the students of Hogwarts came in a trickle for breakfast. There were always constants. The same groups appearing no matter what year it was, unchanged since the creation of Hogwarts itself.</p><p>Small groups of Ravenclaws started to mill around their table, already with planners, parchment and textbooks in hand. A couple started to drain the coffee pots into mugs, plates pushed to the side in favour of making space for their books. Though, every so often they would reach for said plates where someone, something, ensured those plates were kept stocked with food that wouldn't damage their books or notes.</p><p>Then some had no sleep the night before. The lovers, the schemers and the insomniacs of the castle. They were from a variety of houses and unlike the Ravenclaws, their numbers were always limited to one or two, at most three people - equally tired.</p><p>The last getting set up in the early hours of Sunday morning was the Quidditch team. This week specifically it was the Hufflepuff's who pulled the short straw on Sunday morning practice. Their captain was easily recognisable from the slight hop to their step and an easy grin on their face. Her face. Alice beamed at her small group of begrudging and tired teammates and grabbed herself a protein-heavy breakfast, sausages and bacon and honey-glazed ham sandwiches filled her plate, sausage rolls wrapped somewhat haphazardly into napkins as a snack for practice.</p><p>She was filling her second glass of apple juice to the brim and stealing away a pain au chocolat alongside an apple as an additional snack when she noticed them. To be fair, it wasn't that rare of a sight anymore, the pair having started dating in the 5th year and it already being the end of their 6th. She would've simply waved and gone back to her food if it wasn't for the fact something was distinctly off.</p><p>Not in a bad way. At least, her gut wasn't telling her it was bad, and she had very good instincts. It's why she's been a captain since 4th year. In the way that the two seemed closer? She couldn't really say. It was different though. Good.</p><p>Turning to her team, she gestured to her second in command.</p><p>"I'll be right back, make sure they eat, wake up and that nobody touches my food."</p><p>She gets a somewhat confused nod that she barely acknowledges before she trots up to her best friend.</p><p>"Lily!"</p><p>The name was the only warning the tall redhead got as she was tackled by a blonde blur. She felt his arms steady her, ensuring she wouldn't fall to the floor from the impact, and leaned slightly as thanks before standing up straight. The tight grip around her middle made her only grin wider, though she did crane her neck to raise an eyebrow at James. Who, in his ever mature manner, rolled his eyes and touched her back slightly before turning towards the Gryffindor table.</p><p>"It's like you haven't seen me since yesterday."</p><p>The words only seemed to spur Alice on as she tightened her grip. Confused, and slightly worried, Lily moved her hand to Alice's cheek.</p><p>"You okay?"</p><p>"Just felt weird," Alice muttered into her palm, her smile slipping slightly. Something felt <em>off</em>. She quickly shook her head, grin returning to her face. "Ready for the last match? We're totally going to kick your butts."</p><p>She heard the exasperation from her best friend before she saw it cross her face.</p><p>"Honestly, Alice? You know I don't care about sports."</p><p>"But your boy does. And you care about your boy. And me. Obviously."</p><p>"Obviously." The grin remains on her face but there's distinct fond tiredness to it. Alice looks at her friend up and down again, trying to see what could be <em>off</em>. But everything seemed the same. Lily was still the tall, slender, redhead with a permanent glint in her eyes.</p><p>"I can't believe we're going to be 7th years soon." Her smile turned wry at the idea. Alice didn't know what she wanted to do. Where to go. The thought of more exams spooked her, sure, but the murky nature of the future terrified her to the core.</p><p>"Even after we leave, we'll be close." Alice leaned into the warm hug of her best friend. At least one thing that would remain a constant in her life. For now. She grimaced at that, not one for such pessimism usually.</p><p>"Why are you guys up this early? I mean, I'm not too surprised about you. Though you're usually a more 10 a.m. gal than half past 7. But Jamie boy usually wakes up at 11 on a good day."</p><p>Ah. There it was. Alice could feel the slight shift in her friend and saw as her hand moved towards her neck.</p><p>"Stayed up a bit late together. Astronomy Tower." She wrinkled her nose. Lovebirds. Gross.</p><p>"Meet me at lunch? By the Willow, for a picnic?" Lily nodded in response turning away towards the table. "And don't bring your lover! I need some me time!" That led to laughter from both of them. As Alice started to head back towards her team, who thankfully seemed more awake through the miracle of caffeine and good food, she caught a glimpse of something golden around Lily's neck.</p><p>A bit strange, she thought, Lily wasn't too big on jewellery.</p><p>The thought escaped her as soon as she saw Frank Longbottom heading towards her table, the Gryffindor looking surprisingly awake, easy confidence in his step and a charming grin on his face. The mild surprise at his rare morning appearance faded as she saw the bouquet, sweet alyssum, daisies and a sole gladiolus. She let out a laugh.</p><p>Today was a <em>good</em> day for love.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was the summer before 7<sup>th</sup> year, and it was sweltering hot. In some ways, it felt like he was deep within an active volcano, suffocated and surrounded by heat and pressure and molten rock. Wherever he went there was a distinctly pungent note of sulphur in the air and a pressure on his <em>soul</em> that wouldn’t go away.</p><p>It was the first summer since 2<sup>nd</sup> year that Sirius wasn’t with him.</p><p>It was also the first summer since he got engaged.</p><p>Not that any people knew barring, him and well, Lily. No need for people to go off about them being ‘too young’. They knew. They…well, it’s not that they didn’t care. They just…didn’t?</p><p>The thing was, the separation from her this summer was worse than in 5<sup>th</sup> year when they were just dating. And it was worse than when he thought she might forget him over the summers or find someone else that he couldn’t compete with. At least at school, he was aware of his competition and how to <em>win</em>. Not that she was a prize. She was her own woman and he wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p>This time it physically hurt to be so far away. Or maybe he was being overly dramatic? Lily did say he had a strong tendency for theatrics. His heart tightened at the thought of her, the easy smile and the friendly jabs at each other. The warmth of her by his side, an anchor in a storm. He couldn’t wait to see her again, to have her presence soothe this ache.</p><p>He stretched his hands out at the window sill, his fingers brushing a piece of finely made parchment. He glowered out at the world before turning to read the letter again.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Darling Son,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>              </em>
</p><p><em>Your father and I have recently accepted an invitation from the Lord Abraxas Malfoy, it’s on the 17<sup>th</sup> of this month so if you should arrive during that week be aware we won’t be home for the next foreseeable days. Maybe 2 or 3 from that day. I’ll make sure to alert the house-elves once I get a more secure timeframe. I understand that you have some sort of rivalry going on with Heir Malfoy so I won’t even ask of you to come home early. It might help avoid conflict in all honestly. I’m sure the Malfoys won’t see it as too much of a slight. So long as your father behaves. Other than that, we have a soiree that you’ll have to attend on the 20<sup>th</sup> of the month held by the Macmillan Family. I know you’re friends with the Macmillan Heir and I’ve heard Frank has also been invited. </em> <em>              </em></p><p>
  <em>We’ve decided that next year, as you finish term early in June, you may join us officially for the Summer Solstice festivities proper. This invitation can be extended to your motley crew of friends and significant other. Do ensure they know how to behave, though if they simply wish to observe rather than partake, they can still join.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>How is the Château? I hope the house-elves were able to alter it to a more liveable state? I understand you’re angry, but I cannot, as a daughter of House Black, hold Sirius at our estate whilst the situation is what it is. I promise that as soon as this is dealt with he won’t have to interact with the House unless he chooses otherwise. I know I’ve promised you things before, but trust in what I say – this is the only thing he currently can’t evade as Heir Apparent to House Black.  If you are planning to stay within the region during the 13<sup>th</sup>-15<sup>th</sup>, your father and I would like to ask of you to visit the Ball held by Mme. Marietta Zabini and Lady Amelié Valois. I know it’s not your favourite activity, but it is your duty. You only need to attend the event for an hour, limit your drinking but feel free to gorge on the food. All I ask is that you maintain a low level of decorum.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>If not for me then for your father.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In other news, there have been unsavoury rumours afoot. At least, in our circles. And by our circles I mean my circles, your father is as unsociable as he has been the last 39 years of his life. I want you to practice your defence skills and keep your eyes and ears open. I’ve sent over several books which may be of use, focusing on practical applications rather than theory. Two of them are focused on transfiguration magicks which I know fully well you are more than talented and should do well enough with supervision. All I can send by owl, and most of the things I’ve confirmed by now is the talk of an old family coming back, the current Light Lord setting up some sort of ‘guild’ and that there’s talk of restrictions on the Old Ways. More than there are currently.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Try to avoid that mess until I receive more information.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Stay hale and safe,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>All our love,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mother &amp; Father.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>He sighed and looked out the window, the smell of salt and sea on the wind. He missed home. He wasn’t even angry at his mother anymore. Sure, he was frustrated at first because she allowed for Sirius to be taken. But he understood.</p><p>Well, Lily made him understand. That also meant that he knew he had to attend the twice-cursed ball. No point in trying to have a fight he knows he’ll lose, from what his father told him the foundations of a good marriage where compromise, love and knowing which battles to fight. A ball he had to attend by virtue of being an heir to a prominent British family was literally an uphill battle whilst stuck in tar.  </p><p>He turned towards the books set on his study table and flicked through one casually.</p><p>“<em>Creative Uses of Transfiguration, A Guide to Unconventional Duelling”</em></p><p>At least he’d have something to occupy his time in the meanwhile. Something to distract him from the fact that there was still a month left before they reunited.</p><p>22 days left.</p><p>He flinched as a flare of heat ran up his spine and pressure wrapped around his heart. A crushing sensation in his chest and burning heat in his blood.</p><p>22 days.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>Sirius glared at his cousin.</p><p>“Bella, fucking stop.”</p><p>The cackle she let out was ear-piercing and he sighed, rubbing his temples. His older cousin was literal demon-spawn. Maybe she was actually a changeling and he had a somewhat normal cousin.</p><p>No, nevermind.</p><p>That’d be impossible with the Black Blood. He just had to accept that his family was insane, that he was insane and that all his friends, by being his friends, were insane. That’s the only way anything would make sense. He sighed again and looked on at his torn shirt.</p><p>“You’re lucky it wasn’t a shirt I liked.”</p><p>Not that he liked any of his shirts. He liked being shirtless. Or naked. Or a dog. Just, clothing was a pain and restrictive and he was hot, okay? He could get away with it. Somewhat. Obviously, he wasn’t able to get away with it at the Manor but fortunately, or currently, unfortunately, his cousins understood that. Always happy to help in giving him excuses for lack of clothing. He tore off his shirt and rubbed the fabric against the slowly dripping wound.</p><p>“I love you too, Siri.” Bella grinned at him, a slightly crazed glint in her eyes, but he took it well and simply tugged on her curls sharply.</p><p>“Maybe don’t attack me every time you see me if you love me so much?” Why ask when he already knew the answer?</p><p>“Learn to dodge, dearest cousin.” She hopped out of his grasp leaving several strands of dark hair in his grip. “I’m just making sure you stay alive.” As she jumped up the stairs, she turned, her face more serious than was the norm. “Your mother is coming tomorrow.” That explained it. Nobody liked Walburga. Probably not even Walburga. “She’s not happy.”</p><p>“She never is.” That made her snort. Bellatrix shook her head and continued her trek back up the stairs without a glance backwards. He didn’t know how to feel about her, honestly. Sighing for what felt like the hundredth time that day, he moved towards the lounge, grimacing at the ghastly display of house-elf heads in a cabinet that was cursed to the n<sup>th</sup> degree. Someone needed to destroy it at some point.</p><p>Maybe him.</p><p>If you know, he knew enough about the black arts to know where to start. He could potentially get Bella to realise it was hideous. Or he could make her want it enough that she’d steal it and hoard it somewhere else…</p><p>Eh…too much effort. Plus, that last one sounds way too Slytherin for his liking.</p><p>He sat on one of the chaise lounges and looked at the family tree glaring at him, his name still prominent on the tapestry despite his mother’s sincerest wishes. He must have been out of it for a couple of minutes because when he came to, he saw what looked like a mirror image of him.</p><p>Only younger and skinnier. Reggie. He grinned.</p><p>“Glad to see you aren’t fully dead yet. I was worried you were looking quite empty-headed. Then again, that’s just your average weekday look.” Ah, Regulus and his attempts at being cutthroat.</p><p>“Never was.” He winked. “I have a list of women who’d verify that statement.”</p><p>His younger brother’s face wrinkled in disgust, before smoothing out.</p><p>“I wish you wouldn’t ignore me, you know?”</p><p>“You know that if I didn’t, one of your <em>friends</em> would oust the fact that I actually like some of my family. And then the Harpy would be impossible to deal with.” Sirius huffed slightly. “I’ve been able to escape her but you haven’t. I can’t get you out.” He walked over to his brother, sitting next to him and wrapping an arm around the thin shoulders. “But I can try to make sure your life isn’t too hard.”</p><p>Regulus just pushed him lightly. Not knowing what to say. Both frustrated and despairing. Fond and betrayed at the same time.</p><p>“She heard you’re still taking the role.”</p><p>Sirius shrugged, twisting the ring on his finger, uncertain.</p><p>“Neither of us want it. But I won’t have you suffer more.” The joys of having an older, self-sacrificing, Gryffindor sibling. Then again, as the Slytherin, he should’ve wanted the role of an heir. Ambition. Honestly, he would’ve been in Ravenclaw if it wasn’t for the fact he wanted some peace and quiet and the Hat was willing to listen.</p><p>“I would have you suffer less.”</p><p>Regulus felt his breathing shudder at that. The light touch of family magic embracing him, the wild nature of it tinged with the love and affection his elder brother had for him. His fingers touched the oak ring around his pinkie, crude but etched with runes and darker in colour than normal oak. Dyed.</p><p>“As soon as I do this I’m not coming back, Little Lion. Not until she’s dead.” Sirius looked at his brother in despair as he said this. Sure, he knew this would happen, that he wouldn’t be back. That he wouldn’t be able to see his family for a while. But he never said it out loud – not till now anyway. There was a cold sinking feeling at that.</p><p>He might be the white sheep of the family but he was intimately tied to the Family Magic. He couldn’t escape it, and he didn’t truly want to. It was part of him, much like his Black Blood and his blood brothers. He lived for and through his family, being away from them, even by choice was nigh impossible for Blacks. Regulus just looked at him with that now painfully common look of defeat and worry.</p><p>“I have to do this.”</p><p>He didn’t know whether he was trying to reassure his brother or himself at this point.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Remus Lupin was aware of his lot in life.</p><p>First, he was the youngest child of seven in a family of farmers with barely any land, with barely any income and too many mouths to feed. The feeling of hunger and neglect from parental figures was common and a constant in his life.</p><p>He grew to accept it by age 5. At least he had his siblings to feel loved and cherished by. A different sort of constant. His memories of that time were filled with a small room and puppy piles surrounded by his elder siblings as they whispered to him tales of fantastical nature.</p><p>He loved his siblings more than he loved himself. But even they couldn’t protect him from the reality of their life.</p><p>It was hard.</p><p>None of his siblings went to school and everyone had to help out at the farm, working on sewing with their mother to sell in town during the weekends and logging in the nearby woods for lumber. Remus understood hard work. He also learned that life was cruel and nothing good is ever free.</p><p>That was a lesson he learned when he was 4.</p><p>It was Octavia’s birthday and she was 16.</p><p>She was the third child of seven and the eldest daughter. She was the best at sewing and made everyone the warmest socks for Christmas. Her eyes were the colour of grass in spring and her smile was as bright as the sun. She was the one who technically raised him. It was Octavia who taught him how to walk and how to sew. She was the one who patched him up when he got cuts from scissors and knives when he had to peel potatoes. Octavia was his mother in all but name.</p><p>The night before her birthday, Ma and Pa got him and his siblings all together after dinner and washing up and told them that tomorrow, after work was done they would all have a party. Remus was thrilled. He heard from his siblings about parties they had when they were younger, of cake and presents and no work. His siblings told him about stories of young princes who held balls at their castles and everyone was happy and well-fed.</p><p>Remus was excited.</p><p>The dawn of Octavia’s birthday, all his siblings got to work harder than usual, finishing their chores earlier. Not because they were lazy or not working hard enough normally. No, this time, they all pumped up with extra energy with the promise of cake. A treat that the family of nine hadn’t had since Octavia was 5.</p><p>His parents didn’t lie. Remus had to give that to their parents. They never were liars.</p><p>Cowards, however, was a different story.</p><p>The cake tasted divine on the day of Octavia’s birthday. Their tiny house felt warm and joyful as a collective unit. Ma and Pa and his siblings seemed to be happy with each other and that made Remus happy. The taste of chocolate on his tongue searing into his brain for the first time ever and when all the cake was finished, their parents surprised them with tiny brown paper packages for each of them.</p><p>His eldest brothers, Tiberius and Maximus received well-made pocket knives, engraved with their names on black leather handles. Octavia received a new dress made of the softest wool they’ve ever felt and new shiny brown shoes that he saw some of the well-to-do girls at Sunday Mass wear. The twins, Caspian and Aurelia received matching wellies that had warm fur on the inside to keep their feet dry. Romulus, the closest to him out of the boys, received a simple pocket-watch. Not new by any means, banged up as it was, and purely decorative at this point as plenty of the gears were missing and one of the hands were broken off. But the inscription in it, ‘Romulus the Barn Owl’, and the photo of their family taken when Remus was 2 stuck opposite the clock face made up for it.</p><p>Remus, on the other hand, received a lovely felt teddy bear, with a woollen red scarf around its neck that he promptly named ‘Bear’. He was 4. The bear also made up for the glaring disparity amongst his siblings, who, despite their unflinching affection for their youngest sibling weren’t keen to give up their only toys to him. Now, Remus had his own.</p><p>And they were all happy.</p><p>Until 4 a.m. rolled about the next day and there was a pounding on the door. They all started to wake bleary-eyed and confused, barring Max who slept like the dead until their Pa woke him up. Remus, clutching to Bear was one of the first to slip downstairs, being the smallest, the fastest and the one with the most energy out of his siblings. He hadn’t realised Octavia wasn’t with them until he was half-way down the stairs and saw her in tears as a strange, older man looked at her impassively.</p><p>He still remembered being confused and increasingly terrified as Octavia started to shout at their parents.</p><p>He still remembered the sound of Bear falling down the stairs and Octavia turning around, anger melting into despair before a smile sat on her lips.</p><p>Remus can still remember that wobbly grin on a red face, with red eyes and tears streaming down her face.</p><p>The look of determination that crossed it a moment later.</p><p>It was the last time he saw Octavia.</p><p>And then he was 7.</p><p>Life was…not normal. Not really. His siblings were quieter and Aurelia was always skittish. On edge. His brothers were more protective and his parents more distant than before. It wasn’t good, but it also wasn’t that bad. After Octavia left, his parents acquired a larger plot of land, more livestock to take care of but also more products to sell. His siblings didn’t have to give him their portion of food anymore. They were all fed.</p><p>They weren’t happy though.</p><p>The puppy pile they held for warmth and companionship felt jarring, the space beside Remus empty for 2 years before they gave up. There were constant arguments between Tiberius, 23 at the time, and Ma and Pa. He wanted to leave.</p><p>He didn’t have anywhere else to go.</p><p>Life was continuing on a dull, grating cycle. Until the 23<sup>rd</sup> of November. He recalled that day more vividly than when Octavia left. It started off well.</p><p>
  <em>Remus should’ve known something was wrong at that point. He should’ve learnt.</em>
</p><p>It was a Good Day. None of the adults were fighting and his Pa had gotten more money this week at the market, something about a price increase on eggs. He didn’t care much. The fact they had more money this week and the harvest was done with meant that he could go hide in the woods with Bear and just…hide. Runaway for a little bit. But he always came back – for his siblings and Octavia and their sow and her little piglets. For the chickens and the cows. He would always come back for them.</p><p>So, after breakfast, he made sure everything was ready for dinner, he took his basket of sewing and some sandwiches wrapped in cloth, told Aurelia where he was headed and that he’d be home before dinner, Remus left the little house for his favourite spot. He got started on some mending of their clothes, ate a sandwich – egg and ham – and cleaned up his little hiding spot, a fairly large hole that could fit two small boys inside an ancient and large oak tree. He took Bear inside and went to take a short nap in the tree.</p><p>By the time he woke up, it was early evening and the air was cold, nipping at his nose and uncovered hands which were now a pale blue. His breath was frosty and dense as he stood up and picked up his basket and trudged home.</p><p>A home where no light was on in the windows and the chimney wasn’t spewing out grey smoke.</p><p>A home where the door was slightly ajar despite the cold temperature outside.</p><p>He moved in with his father’s cousin shortly after that and stayed with him till he was 11.</p><p>Caius Lupin, despite his name, was a man who inspired little joy and held even less of it within himself. Not that the man was spiteful or purposefully bitter. He was simply a man raised without love and disciplined far too thoroughly. This did, however, mean that Caius had no love for anything barring his work and hatred for things that tended to disobey, like children. Fortunately for Caius, Remus had already grown up without much love from adult figures and any desire for love faded on the 23<sup>rd</sup> when he realised that everything he held that emotion for was ripped from him.</p><p>Remus could and would be self-sufficient. Caius was only glad to ensure that would become true by providing him with tutors galore to catch him up to speed as Remus never had any formal education. The boy wasn’t even able to read when he first arrived.</p><p>Life wasn’t great, or better or good. It just wasn’t bad and couldn’t get worse.</p><p>At least, not until the Easter Term after he came back from Hogwarts.</p><p>Remus had been living in a constant state of paranoia since the letter from Hogwarts, waiting for the other shoe to drop at any given moment. After all, he had friends now. He was magic. His uncle was warming up to him a bit because he wasn’t just a squib’s son.</p><p>He was a wizard.</p><p>A human wizard.</p><p>Until Easter, when Caius decided it would be a good idea to try and bond over a past time he half enjoyed after a brief stint with a Hit Wizard force in the 1910s. Camping. It seemed like a good idea at first.</p><p>
  <em>It was a bad idea.</em>
</p><p>They went camping in the more remote reaches of Scotland, Caius having decided it would do them well to travel into more unfamiliar territory to bond – something about ‘evening the playing field’ from what Remus could recall. It sounded somewhat good in theory and Caius was beyond competent with a wand should some wild animal happen upon them at any point.</p><p>They would be safe. It would be fun. It seemed fine on the surface.</p><p>The issue was, not that Remus or Caius or anyone within the Ministry of Magic was aware, the Scottish Highlands housed several small packs of werewolves, unregistered and mostly uncaring of the Ministry legislation. What made the issue worse was the fact that whilst these packs cared nought for legislation, they were aware of who implemented them and one of the most recent pieces, written by a Lord C Lupin after Grindelwald fell, led to the aforementioned ‘register list’ for lycanthropes.</p><p>Word spread like wildfire throughout the northwest of the trip and Remus wasn’t sure what was worse.</p><p>The feeling of poison travelling through his bloodstream, tearing him apart internally, or watching his uncle get ripped into pieces as Caius tried to protect him from the onslaught.</p><p>He supposed that for now at least, at the age of 16 going on 17, he was aware of the balance. He remained in Hogwarts and kept his wand, something most werewolves weren’t able to do, had friends who remained steadfast despite his <em>condition</em> and a small trust fund set up by his uncle. The downside was he was a werewolf, his job prospects weren’t good, any other money he may have gotten neatly held off because he was a werewolf. Not a suitable heir for the Lupus Venator family.</p><p>And that fact didn’t hurt him as much as the knowledge that his future hasn’t improved since he was born.</p><p>That his existence only served as punishment and a tightening noose around the necks of those who cared for him.</p><p>Remus at heart was still the 3-year-old boy whose greatest joy was the nights huddled amongst his older siblings and despite the brothers, he found at Hogwarts, this pervasive sense that he didn’t deserve it and that it would be taken away from him clung to him like a shadow, never truly out of sight.</p><p>His nightmares a constant reminder that he may have placed <em>his people</em> in danger because at heart Remus was selfish and a coward who longed for family.</p>
