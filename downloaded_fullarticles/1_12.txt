    <p>Severus tugged at his fingers as Dumbledore spoke, willing them to stop shaking, or, at the very least, to break into pieces. Then he might be able to return to the Hospital Wing and have Madam Pomfrey look over him again. She’d make sure Dumbledore stayed away until he was feeling better--until he started to feel like his body belonged to him again. Until he stopped wondering what might have happened if Potter hadn’t stepped in to save him.</p>
<p>“...you understand the severity of the situation...”</p>
<p>His fingers didn’t break, and they didn’t stop shaking, but the way his skin blanched white and then faded to pink with each tug was grounding. Severus curled inward, hunching over his fingers until his whole world was made up of that gradient. </p>
<p>“...today’s events must have been deeply upsetting for you. However...”</p>
<p>Severus glanced up at the Headmaster. Dumbledore didn’t seem real. Neither did anything else. If Severus blinked too long, he’d find himself back in the Shack with a wolf charging at him. Not a wolf. A werewolf. Lupin. </p>
<p>“...I must guarantee your silence on what happened, as well as on Mr. Lupin’s condition.”</p>
<p>Severus scowled. Of course Dumbledore would pick the werewolf’s side. Dumbledore was the one who let the beast in here after all. Kicking him out now would mean admitting he was wrong. It would mean telling the world one of his precious Gryffindors wasn’t as pure as he made them all out to be. Severus didn’t say anything, but he managed to nod jerkily. His body still didn’t seem to be cooperating, just like it hadn’t been earlier when Lupin came toward him and Severus froze. If Potter hadn’t dragged him out of there...</p>
<p>Severus supposed his muscles and limbs were still thawing out. He chose that as an explanation for why he didn’t notice Dumbledore casting a spell over him until he was tucking his wand away. </p>
<p>“What--”</p>
<p>“Not to worry, my boy. I’m just making sure Mr. Lupin’s secret stays between Mr. Lupin and yourself.” He had a twinkle in his eyes that was damn annoying, but Severus didn’t have the mental capacity at the moment to figure out what it meant. </p>
<p>“If that’s all...” he started, before shutting his jaw with a snap. He hated the way his voice sounded. It was nasally (it always was) but worse, it was wavering, like the words were being swallowed back into his chest as he voiced them. </p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded at him. “I know tonight’s events may be difficult for you to handle. But remember: you are not alone, even if it may seem like it at first. Even if it seems like no one can see or hear you at all, help will find you. I suggest you accept it when it does.”</p>
<p>Severus fought back a retort to the man’s cryptic words and nodded once more before taking his leave. </p>
<p>He passed Black and Potter at the base of the stairs, but mercifully, they ignored him. A part of Severus wanted to believe they’d learned their lesson this time and would stop bothering him from now on, but he wasn’t naive enough to think it would last. Before meeting with Dumbledore, Severus had assumed this would be the straw that finally got Black expelled, but the Headmaster hadn’t been particularly sympathetic toward Severus, so that was probably a lost cause as well. Severus doubted Gryffindor would even lose any points. Potter might actually convince Dumbledore to <em> give </em> points to Gryffindor for saving Severus’ life--as if he was a saint instead of a rich boy who got afraid of the consequences of his actions too late. Severus didn’t know which of the gang was involved in Black’s “prank” but he couldn’t fathom Potter being truly innocent. </p>
<p>As he made his way to Slytherin, he pondered the spell Dumbledore had cast, wondering what measures had been taken to keep Lupin’s secret. </p>
<p>“Lupin is a werewolf,” Severus tested under his breath. The words came out easily, and he didn’t die on the spot. Perhaps it would only tie his tongue when there were listeners nearby. Or maybe the spell alerted Dumbledore when Severus said it. When Severus made it the rest of the way to the dungeons without the Headmaster appearing in a cloud of fire, he determined it wasn’t that either. Maybe the whole spell was a fake to intimidate Severus into staying mum. Well, if that was the case, Severus would definitely be telling Lily tomorrow that his werewolf theory was correct after all. Then at least this horrible night would have accomplished part of what he intended--even if Dumbledore knew about Lupin after all and wouldn’t expel him or his friends. Even if his small victory wouldn’t be enough to make the nightmares worth it.</p>
<p>Severus crawled into bed, almost wishing one of his dormmates would wake up and chide him, if only to make the room feel a little less cold, a little less empty. As the night drew on, Severus listened for Avery’s soft snores and Mulciber’s mumbling breaths. They were too quiet, too quiet, too quiet, and the wolf was so loud. He would have given anything to block out the howls in his memory. His ears pulsed with the strain of trying to hear those gentle sleep sounds from too far away, and when he finally fell asleep, they escaped him entirely. In the thrall of his nightmares, only he and the wolf remained.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>x*x*Remus*x*x</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The moment Remus woke up, he knew something was wrong. </p>
<p>The first sign was the pain--worse even than before the Marauders had started joining him in their Animagus forms. Remus’ skin was on fire, and he stayed as still as he could while he surveyed his wounds without opening his eyes. His ribcage was tight--possibly bruised or partially broken. His face, neck, and chest stung, and Remus mentally filled in the new claw marks on his canvas of scars. He wondered how he would explain them away. When he only acquired a few prominent ones every now and then, he could pretend the cause was something benign, but if he returned to classes looking like a butchered slab of meat, he would raise more questions than he knew how to answer. </p>
<p>The second sign was the restlessness. Usually, after a full moon running with the Marauders, the wolf retreated for a while, sleepy and satisfied, like a warm embrace instead of an animal tearing at his skin from the inside. Now, it felt like the wolf was as present as Remus, still vying for control of the body they shared. Remus’ muscles twitched and writhed against his bones, and nausea filled him at the sensation.</p>
<p>The third sign was that Sirius wasn’t holding his hand. Remus could recognize the people in the room by scent--the Marauders and Madam Pomfrey easily broke through the sterile Hospital Wing smell--so he knew Sirius was there, but he wasn’t touching him. Remus wondered if he’d torn his own arm off during the transformation. Maybe part of his pain belonged to a phantom limb. Or maybe Remus had done something worse--hurt someone--and Sirius was repulsed by him, too horrified or disgusted to hold his hand. It was that thought that made Remus open his eyes.</p>
<p>The bright lights blinded him for a few moments, but when his vision cleared, he spotted Sirius, a step behind James, and Peter a few feet to the side.</p>
<p>“Moony,” Sirius breathed, fingers twitching as if they wanted to curl into a fist. </p>
<p>James shifted his foot further in front of Sirius, and Remus’ throat tightened at the thought that James was protecting Sirius from him. <em> Oh God, what had he done last night? </em></p>
<p>“Good morning, Mr. Lupin,” Madam Pomfrey said, moving into view and blocking the Marauders. Her voice was as brisk and no-nonsense as ever, but there was pity in her eyes. Remus hoped it was because he looked like a corpse that would fall out of a cupboard in a Muggle horror movie and not because he had just become a murderer. “Drink this.” She tilted a potion to his lips, and he swallowed it down. The pungent taste forced a cough out of him, and it made his ribs scream in protest. Madam Pomfrey nodded in approval at his dutiful swallow. “That should help quicken the healing. Of course, you know by now that I can’t get rid of the scars, but with a week of rest, you should feel as good as new, even if you don’t look it.” </p>
<p>Relief shot through him at her words. Surely Madam Pomfrey wouldn’t tell him he’d be better in a week if they were planning to execute him in an hour. Remus tried to thank her, but his throat was still scratchy from the potion, and he ended up coughing again. </p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey grabbed a glass of water from her potions cart and tipped it into his mouth. </p>
<p>“...thank you,” Remus managed when he had finished. </p>
<p>“You’re very welcome, Mr. Lupin. I’ll let you have a few minutes with your friends, but then I’ll be kicking everyone out so you can get some sleep.” She eyed the Marauders sternly. “That's the best thing for you right now.”</p>
<p>Remus managed a small smile, and she smiled back before leaving the room. Remus’ jaw clenched with worry now that he was alone with his friends, but he forced his eyes to flick toward them. “So,” he said with as much strength as he could muster, “is someone going to tell me what the hell happened last night?”</p>
<p>Sirius opened his mouth to answer, but James cut him off with a look. </p>
<p>“Everyone is fine, Remus,” James said. “You didn’t hurt anyone.” </p>
<p>Remus studied his eyes for a tell, but something in his voice made Remus sure he wasn’t lying, despite Remus’ own doubts. Still, he couldn’t relax. If James was speaking the truth, then there was something else. “I almost did,” Remus said with as much certainty as he could have with so little memory of the night before.</p>
<p>James hesitated, then nodded.</p>
<p>“Sirius?” Remus guessed, unable to tear his eyes from the floor where James’ foot was still separating them protectively. </p>
<p>“What? Moony, no. You didn’t try to hurt me. I...” Remus glanced up at the pain in his friend's voice. Sirius swallowed. “I tried to let you hurt someone else.” </p>
<p>Remus felt his mouth go dry. “You...who? Why?” </p>
<p>“Snivellus,” James muttered. “Padfoot thought it was a good idea to tell him how to get past the Whomping Willow.”</p>
<p>Remus’ eyes burned with unshed tears. He shook his head, again and again until he thought it might rattle onto the floor. “No.” </p>
<p>“James rescued him though,” Peter added, shifting on his feet with discomfort. </p>
<p>“No,” Remus said again. “You wouldn’t. I can’t believe--” </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Moony,” Sirius said, and it was his tone, tortured and broken, that finally cut through Remus’ denial. </p>
<p>Remus closed his eyes. He couldn’t look at him. He couldn’t listen to his apologies. “Get out.”</p>
<p>“Moons...”</p>
<p><em>“Get out!” </em>he snapped, and he knew the wolf slipped into his voice because he could feel the growl rumbling in his chest. Remus didn’t look up, afraid his eyes might be golden and wolflike. He heard a shuffling sound, and then the door opened and closed. Remus took several deep breaths, but they only grew more shallow the more he tried not to panic. </p>
<p>“Is he really okay?” Remus choked out after a few fruitless minutes of this. </p>
<p>There was silence for a moment as if James and Peter didn’t know what to make of his words. “Yeah,” James said finally. “Snape is okay. I got to him before...”</p>
<p>Remus nodded, unable to speak. When his breathing slowed enough to form words, he asked, “Did he see your Animagus form?”</p>
<p>James softened at his friend's concern. “No, he didn't. I pushed him out of the tunnel and then transformed. I, uh, might have broken a few of your ribs trying to drive you back into the Shack though. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Remus whispered, and suddenly he was too tired to deal with anything else. He didn’t know what time it was, but since Madam Pomfrey wasn’t rushing the Marauders off to class, Remus assumed it was still early. He could sleep for a few hours, and then he would sneak out when Madam Pomfrey wasn’t looking and check on Snape. He wouldn’t be able to breathe normally until then. “Can you leave please?” Remus told them, not looking up. “I’m tired.”</p>
<p>“Course, Moony, whatever you need.”</p>
<p>“We’ll come back to check on you at lunch,” Peter piped in uncertainly, “That is, if you want us to.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded once, even though he wasn’t sure he wanted that. He wasn’t sure he wanted to see another human being for the rest of his life. Maybe it would be better if they locked him up in Azkaban. At least he wouldn’t have to worry about hurting the dementors. He wondered nonsensically if they could be friends--if the dark creature in him might find solace in the darkness in them.</p>
<p>James and Peter’s soft footsteps were the last sounds Remus heard before drifting off to sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>x*x*Severus*x*x</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Severus awoke, he felt like Potter had let a snitch loose in his skull. The memory of sharp teeth and wolf howls kept him up most of the night, and when he did sleep, the nightmares kept it from being restful. </p>
<p>Avery and Mulciber were already rummaging around the room, and Severus stared at the ceiling, dreading the day ahead. Being late to class, however, would only sour his mood further, so he reluctantly pulled back his bed curtains. </p>
<p>Avery glanced up sharply at the movement before turning to Mulciber. “Did you do that?” </p>
<p>“Did I do what?” Mulciber’s voice was gruff like it always was in the mornings, and Severus was too exhausted to remind himself not to find it appealing. </p>
<p>“Open Snape’s curtains.” </p>
<p>Severus furrowed his brows, wondering if he should just go back to bed. His temporary inability to make sense of the English language would make going to classes irrelevant.</p>
<p>“Avery, why in Merlin’s name would I do that?” </p>
<p>“More importantly,” Severus said, rubbing the sleep from his eyes to make room for his bewilderment, “what the fuck are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“I dunno, Mulc, but they were closed a second ago, and now they’re open,” Avery said, shaking his head like maybe he was seeing things. “And Snape isn’t here, so I guessed it was you.”</p>
<p>Severus blinked. It seemed Avery’s problem wasn’t ‘seeing things’ but rather ‘not seeing things’. ‘Things’ being Severus. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I am very much here.” </p>
<p>Avery didn’t look at him. Instead, he shook his head. “Never mind. I guess I imagined it.”</p>
<p>Mulciber eyed Avery warily as he finished dressing. “Come on then, let’s get to breakfast. You can go crazy after we’ve eaten.” </p>
<p>Avery nodded and followed him out the door. </p>
<p>Severus blinked again. Was that...a joke? It didn’t sound like one. If they were joking, surely they would have made rude comments about him or something, because moving curtains weren’t very funny. But if it wasn’t a joke...</p>
<p>...then they really couldn’t see--or hear--Severus. And if that was true, it was almost too much to contemplate. Was he dead? Had he pulled a Professor Binns and continued on with his routine as if he was still among the living? Severus was going to haunt Lupin to the grave if he had killed him last night. </p>
<p>But then, if he was a ghost, Avery and Mulciber would still have been able to see and hear him. He just would have been transparent. At least, he thought that was how it worked. Were there different levels of ghostliness? </p>
<p>His stomach grumbled, and he decided breakfast was a necessary precursor to questioning his existence. He pulled on his robes and grabbed his bag, not bothering to clean himself up. He’d look like shit either way, and when it came to his appearance, at the moment he was more worried about whether or not he had one at all.</p>
<p>Severus grew more and more nervous the nearer he came to the Great Hall as he passed more and more people who didn’t notice him. He reminded himself that most of those people didn’t notice him on a normal day, but his paranoia was making it harder to believe it. He started humming, hoping to draw someone’s--anyone’s--attention, even if it meant ruining his reputation or getting teased. “Killer Queen” buzzed out through his nose, but still, no one looked his way.</p>
<p>Finally, a few feet from the doors, Severus spotted a head of red hair.</p>
<p>“Lily!”</p>
<p>She didn’t turn around. Severus sped up, ducking around people until he was right behind her.</p>
<p>“LILY!”</p>
<p>She didn’t turn around.</p>
<p>Severus felt his stomach drop, and his knees started to shake. </p>
<p>She didn’t turn around.</p>
<p>She didn’t fucking turn around. </p>
<p><em>Oh, God.</em> No one could see him. No one could hear him. He wasn’t even a ghost, he was something worse than that. Fuck fuck <em> fuck.</em> Severus knew he was hyperventilating, but he couldn’t get his breathing under control.</p>
<p>
  <em> If a student faints in the hallway and there’s no one who can see him, does he really make a sound? </em>
</p>
<p>Black spots danced across his vision. Severus closed his eyes to make them stop, but that only caused him to lose his balance. </p>
<p>“Snape!” he heard from a few feet behind him. He tried to open his eyes to see who the speaker was, but instead, he fell toward them, and his vision went black. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>x*x*Remus*x*x</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape tried to scream when he woke, but Remus covered his mouth with his hand. “It’s okay, I’m not going to hurt you.” Remus released Snape when he saw the panic in his eyes, and a wave of guilt washed over him. “You fainted, so I carried you here.”</p>
<p>Snape scuttled away as fast as he could. He wiped his sleeve across his mouth, and his features twisted up, making it clear he was wondering where else Remus had touched him so he could scrub there too. </p>
<p>Remus had brought him to the nearest unlocked room he could find which turned out to be an empty classroom. He knew he should have taken Snape to the Hospital Wing, but he didn’t want Madam Pomfrey to put him back in his room before he could make sure Snape was okay. Not to mention, Remus was embarrassingly weak after the full moon, and it was hard enough on his wounds to drag himself that distance, not to mention another person. He wondered how many stitches he’d torn already. Madam Pomfrey was going to kill him when he returned to her care--or at least tut at him very severely. </p>
<p>When Snape gathered his bearings, he scooted even further away until he backed up against a desk. “Stay away from me, you mutt.”</p>
<p>Remus winced, but he deserved that after what Snape had gone through. After what Remus had unknowingly put him through. “I won’t come any closer,” Remus said, “and I’ll leave you alone forever after this if you’d like. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry for what happened last night. I had no idea what Sirius was planning, and if I’d known, I would have done anything I could to stop it. I never would have intentionally...” Remus trailed off, too horrified by the possibility to finish. “I don’t even know what I would have done if I had hurt you.”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t have done anything," Snape hissed. "The Ministry would have had you executed.” Remus heard the silent <em>‘which they should have done anyway.’</em></p>
<p>“I would have deserved it,” Remus agreed. He had been considering going to the Ministry and coming clean about his condition all morning. He still hadn’t decided. Perhaps Snape would do him a favor and just tell everyone about him. Then Remus wouldn't have to make the decision. “Anyway, I’m sorry for coming to find you. I know it must be revolting to be around me after what you saw. I just--I had to see with my own eyes that you’re okay.” Some sort of realization flickered in Snape’s eyes, but Remus didn’t know what he said to cause it. “I know you don’t believe me, but...I really am sorry.” </p>
<p>“Of course you are,” Snape sneered. “And after this, you’ll go back and have a laugh about it with your boyfriend.” </p>
<p>Remus stared. “What?”</p>
<p>Snape rolled his eyes. “You can claim innocence as much as you like, Lupin. I don’t buy it.”</p>
<p>“I--” Remus felt his face go red. He hated it when that happened because it made his scars stand out stark white against the flush. It was worse now that Snape knew what had caused them. “No, not that. I um, <em> boyfriend?”</em></p>
<p>“Black,” Snape said, like Remus was the one who was out of his mind. Remus wondered if his jaw was hanging open. He thought it might be. Snape’s face contorted in response. “It was a joke, Lupin. Calm down.” </p>
<p>Remus closed his mouth, which he supposed meant it must have been open. He felt exposed. Surely Snape hadn’t noticed that Remus--</p>
<p>Remus brushed the thought aside. Snape himself had just said it was a joke. It didn’t mean anything. Instead, Remus grounded himself in reality by thinking about what Sirius had done. He kept having to remind himself because it still didn’t feel real. Remus had trusted Sirius. Remus had thought Sirius cared for him. But after last night…well, he must have been wrong. No one could do that to someone they loved. “Right. Well. Sirius and I aren’t speaking at the moment. So.”</p>
<p>Snape studied him. “How terrible for you.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t looking for sympathy.” Remus wasn’t sure how to make Snape understand that he was truly sorry, but suddenly it seemed like the most important task in the world.</p>
<p>Snape continued to stare, and for a moment, Remus thought he might have gotten through to him. But then a muscle in Snape’s jaw twitched, and he looked away. “Well, whatever you’re looking for, you can forget it,” Snape snarled, picking himself up off the floor. “I don’t owe you anything.” </p>
<p>Before Remus could think of a reason to make him stay, he was out the door.</p>
