          <div class="userstuff"><p>You and your best friend Sirius Black were sitting in the (Y/H) common room with you reading a book aloud with his head in your lap as you ran your fingers through his hair instinctively and he munched on sweets he’d nabbed from the kitchens earlier.<br/>After you had read two full scenes from Hamlet, Sirius sat up and dramatically declared, “You’ve ruined me!”<br/>You looked up at him in surprise and then smirked, “How did I do that?”<br/>“You’ve made me like books!”<br/>“Did I now?” You ask, not believing him.<br/>“Yes. Guess how many books I’ve read in the last week alone.”<br/>“How many?”<br/>“Twelve,” he declared proudly. <br/>You raised an an eyebrow, “That so?”<br/>“Yes! And Prongs won’t stop teasing me about it!”<br/>“What have you read then?”<br/>“Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, Peter Pan, Treasure Islan-“<br/>You cut him off, “You read books by Jane Austen?”<br/>“I did. You started reading Pride and Prejudice to me and I just had to know if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth got together! And then I couldn’t stop reading Jane Austen! And then the other day you started reading Shakespeare and so I read Romeo and Juliet, The Tragedy Of Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Midsummer Night's Dream.” Sirius said. <br/>“Where’d you get the books?” You asked incredulously. <br/>“Moony,” Sirius said, as though it should have been obvious. <br/>“So if I ask Remus, he’ll back up your story?”<br/>“Yep! One hundred percent.”<br/>You closed Hamlet and turned to face him, “So what did you think?”<br/>And that’s how you got no sleep that night.</p></div>
