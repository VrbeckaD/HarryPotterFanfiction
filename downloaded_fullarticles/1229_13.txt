    <p>“You’re always making me come first,” panted Lily, struggling to push James off her.</p><p>“And? You’re complaining?” James raised himself up on his arms to look her. Her lips were swollen from kissing and her cheeks were flushed. James couldn’t help himself, he leaned down to kiss her again. She sighed happily.</p><p>“Not complaining, my love.” Her green eyes glinted mischievously. “But that’s not happening today.”</p><p>“Isn’t it?” James raised an eyebrow, an exaggeratedly inquisitive look on his face. “And here I was thinking you were already close.”</p><p>“I am– was.”</p><p>“Mind if I continue, then?” James started to lower himself slowly back into his girlfriend, grinning.</p><p>“I do, actually.”</p><p>James paused. “You want me to stop?”</p><p>She returned his grin and wriggled out from under him. “Lie down, Potter. On your back.”</p><p>“You’re serious?” He was sitting upright.</p><p>“Actually I’m Lily. Sorry to disappoint.” Lily took hold of his shoulders and pressed backwards.</p><p>“Just my luck,” he smirked.</p><p>“It really is.” Lily guided James’ hands over his head and pressed them into the mattress. As soon as she took her hands away from his, he brought his left hand back to rest on Lily’s chest. “No touching,” she commanded. Her voice faltered as he pinched her nipple between thumb and index finger, tugging softly.</p><p>James maintained eye contact as his right hand inched towards Lily’s other nipple. She watched him in amusement. He canted his hips to tease her with his cock.</p><p>This brought her to her senses. She swatted his hands away and scooted backwards out of his reach, placing her hands on his hips. Her red hair was a curtain as she bent to kiss his inner thigh. He twitched but kept quiet. She kissed his other leg and nibbled gently.</p><p>James made no sound of encouragement, so she looked up at him to see how he was doing. His eyes were closed and his smile was contented. Lily moved her lips to James’  cock and hummed happily, taking his head in her mouth.</p><p>He tasted like precum and like Lily, having been inside her just moments before. The taste wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t good, either. She swirled her tongue around his tip. James made a sound between a moan and a grunt. She responded by taking him further into her mouth. He thrust involuntarily and she made a noise of displeasure.</p><p>Hallowing her cheeks, she drew back slowly and removed her lips from him with a soft <em> pop</em>. His cock twitched and a bit more precum leaked out.  </p><p>“What’d you stop for?”</p><p>“I don’t want you to fuck my mouth,” she answered. “I want you to lie still and let me take care of you.”</p><p>“What if I want to fuck your mouth?”</p><p>“Do you?”</p><p>“Not really. But imagine I did.”</p><p>Lily didn’t answer. Instead, she pushed her hair back so James could watch her. She started again with his thighs, leaving a trail of wet little kisses up to his base.</p><p>“Are you going to be good and let me take care of you?” She felt silly and hoped her voice sounded more confident than she felt. It must not have, though, because he chuckled softly.</p><p>“Am I going to be good? Did you just ask me to be a good boy and let you suck me off?”</p><p>Lily’s cheeks burned but she didn’t back down. “I didn’t ask, I commanded. Be still for me, my love.” She pressed her nails across his stomach and he groaned. Taking his shaft in her other hand she stroked him up and down, still placing kisses around his cock.</p><p>She took him back in her mouth, sliding him in deeply and trying not to gag. Again, his hips bucked involuntarily.  Again, she stopped sucking and looked at him.</p><p>“Did I say you could do that?”</p><p>“C’mon, Lil, it was an accident. Don’t stop.”</p><p>“You don’t tell me when I can or can’t stop.” He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>She added quickly: “unless you actually want me to stop, as in, you don’t consent, or whatever. Then, you definitely have the right to tell me to stop. Obviously.”</p><p>James laughed. “Way to ruin the mood, Evans. I was just starting to take you seriously.”</p><p>“Fuck off, Potter. Consent doesn’t ruin the mood. Anyway, keep taking me seriously. One of us has to.”</p><p>“You’re not taking yourself seriously?”</p><p>“No, I feel silly as hell. But– ”</p><p>James sat up and kissed her. He took her lower lip between his teeth and she let out a little “<em>ooh</em>.”</p><p>“You certainly don’t seem very confident, ordering me around. Let me relax you, Lil. Then you can do whatever you want to me.”</p><p>Lily’s eyes flashed. “No! You’re not convincing me so easily. Lie back down.”</p><p>He grinned indulgently, an if-you-insist look on his face. Once he was on his back, Lily straddled his hips. Her cunt was wet and warm against him. She took his cock in her hand and lowered herself onto it. She gasped as it entered her, savouring the familiar fullness. She blinked back stars and tried to remember what she had meant to do. This was for James. He was going to come first. She rolled her hips experimentally until she found a comfortable rhythm.</p><p>She tried to distract herself from the pleasure pooling in her belly by thinking about other things. NEWTs were coming up, and she hadn’t studied nearly enough yet. Oh well, she hadn’t started studying in earnest for her OWLs until two weeks prior and she’d gotten all Exceeds Expectations. <em> God</em>, she thought. <em> I sound so boastful. At least James isn’t a Legilimens. </em> She looked him, and he looked at her. He didn’t appear to have heard any of her thoughts. <em> Good</em>.</p><p>“Have you started studying for your NEWTs yet?” She asked, mind still on the upcoming exams.</p><p>“Can I move my hands?”</p><p>“Sure?”</p><p>He stuck out his right hand as if to introduce himself. “Hi, my name is James Fl– James Potter. I’ve never studied a day in my life and I’m getting along just fine. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Lily laughed. “Nice to meet you too.”</p><p>“Why do you ask? Is this some sort of roleplay thing? You should know, Lils, I’m not really into teacher stuff. If I was I’d probably do my homework once in a while. Or I’d be shagging Moony.”</p><p>“Sirius would kill you. Anyway, I was just curious. Now put your hands back over your head.” His hands had come to rest on her hips, trying to slow down her movements.</p><p>Normally, Lily felt uncomfortable being watched, whether by James or anyone else. Once, in fifth year, Sirius dared her to give Dorcas a lap dance. They’d all been drunk, and they were both fully clothed, but the shame still itched somewhere in the back of her brain. Another time, that utter git, Severus, asked her out and for days afterwards Slytherins would gather around in groups and talk about her. Everything they said was too quiet to hear, and somehow that made it worse.</p><p>Being on top during sex, though, that was a different thing entirely. Riding James’ cock felt powerful. She felt pretty, feminine, sexy, the way James described her when she was feeling self-conscious. She imagined her hair to be artfully mussed, though it was probably sticking up at odd angles. <em> Could use some Sleekeazy’s right now. </em>She rubbed her clit up against James.</p><p><em> Feeling attractive is a terribly narcissistic aphrodisiac</em>, thought Lily. She continued to roll her hips. James groaned softly. His hands had made their way back to her hips, but he wasn’t trying to slow her down. Instead, he grabbed her in a way that she hoped would leave finger-shaped bruises to press on later.</p><p>James’ sharp hip bones were digging into Lily’s thighs, and she redoubled her efforts to give him the first orgasm. Mostly so she could enjoy watching him come without getting distracted by her own orgasm, but also because once he came she’d let him get back on top and his stupidly sharp bones would stop cutting off her circulation.</p><p>“You close, my love?” Lily whispered in James’ ear. “I want you to come for me. Please?”</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” responded James.</p><p>She threw her head back, partly because of how good it all felt. But also partly because it was an excuse to push her chest forward and she liked to imagine how James must see her in this moment. She filed away that troubling bit of patriarchal nonsense to unpack it later.</p><p>She felt her legs quivering and prayed that her body would hold out just a bit longer. Tragically (or not), James chose that moment to let go of her hip and brush his fingers over her clit. Just that bit of pressure sent her over the edge, shaking and floating and cursing. She continued to grind against James as the waves of pleasure coursed through her but as soon as it was over she collapsed onto his chest, fitting her face into the crook of his neck. He wrapped his arms around her, and she was surprised to find that she was cold. She slipped off his cock and burrowed into his side.</p><p>After a few minutes of lazy kisses, Lily realized that she never had gotten around to doing what she’d intended.</p><p>“Shit, it happened again,” she said. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“What happened again?”</p><p>“I came first.”</p><p>“Oh, right. It’s fine, Lils. I prefer it this way.”</p><p>It <em> wasn’t </em> fine, though, because Lily wanted, at the very least, to prove to herself that she was in control enough of her own body to not be so selfish. James didn’t see it as selfish, they’d talked about it before, but his opinion wasn’t really the point.</p><p>“Are you still close?” She asked hopefully.</p><p>He laughed and guided her hand to his painfully straining cock. “You tell me.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask if you were still hard, you dolt.” Lily tried to move to get back on top of him, but her legs felt sluggish. Instead she traced the muscles on his Quidditch-toned chest. “Fuck me?”</p><p>“Thought you’d never ask.” James lifted her completely off of him, leaving a feather-light kiss on her forehead as he did so. She moaned softly when he thrust into her, filling her again with that lovely stretched feeling. He immediately started pounding into her, each thrust giving her butterflies. </p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” she said. “Fucking shit, you feel good. Oh, <em> oh</em>, sweet fucking Jesus– shit. I’m already so close again, Jamie, don’t stop, fucking keep going, ah–”</p><p>James pushed his mouth against hers. “Shh. Stop talking.” Lily pressed her lips together to keep from babbling. A couple more thrusts and they were coming simultaneously; James with a choked-sounding moan and Lily with her eyes shut tight and a sharp inhale through her nose.</p><p>“Thank you.” Her half-lidded eyes looked dreamily up at him. Instead of answering, James dropped down to rest his face in her neck, just as she’d done before to him. He mumbled something that she didn’t catch. Probably something sweet, the complete sap.</p><p>“Hmm?” She prompted. She traced a pattern onto his shoulder. He pushed himself up onto one elbow and repeated himself.</p><p>“Do you have any summer plans?” She shook her head no, and he looked nervous. “It’s just my parents are going to visit family for two months and I only have to go for a week, for a wedding, so I’m just going to stay at their place. If you wanted to stay with me. Sirius’ll also be there, if that’s okay. Is that weird? Is it like I’m asking to move in together? Is it even weirder that my best mate will be there too? Sorry.”</p><p>Lily pushed his mouth against his. “Shh. Stop talking. I’d love to live with you for the summer. And longer, if you want.” James grinned.</p><p>“Merlin, you’re gorgeous.” He pushed a lock of sweaty auburn hair behind Lily’s ear.</p><p>“It’s Lily,” she said. “I thought I mentioned my name earlier.”</p><p>“Clever.”  </p><p>“I know I am.”</p>
