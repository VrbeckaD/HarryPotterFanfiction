He might need to have the fit on his arms altered, it seemed the weightlifting he'd recently begun engaging in might actually be making a difference. He blinked and twisted his wrist, subtly checking the time on his watch. He tapped his fingers on his thigh and his toes in his shoes and let his mind wander to the professional Quidditch game he would be going to see later in the month.

He paused and watched the slight disappointment flash in the eyes of the paranoid man sharing a meal with him.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh," he paused looking down at the mishappen doll under the napkin. He swallowed thickly and then returned his eyes to Kingsley, "What else can I do to, you know, hurt my enemies?"</p>
