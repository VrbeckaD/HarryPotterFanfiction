    <p>Harry sighed as he crawled into bed, he was tired after a long day of school and was glad that tomorrow he had off.</p><p> </p><p>Still, he wasn’t happy.</p><p> </p><p>Two months ago during potions class a potion had exploded when Ron put in an ingredient he wasn’t suppose to, Harry had been rushed to the hospital wing unconscious.</p><p> </p><p>Thing is, scans said teh potion had forced creature blood from far in the past to awaken, but Harry felt no different and looked no different. Best guess it would go into effect once his body hit puberty.</p><p> </p><p>Great, now he wasn’t human either.</p><p> </p><p>Sighing, he slipped asleep.</p><p> </p><p>OoOoO</p><p> </p><p>Two hours later Golden once emerald eyes opened, the sound of the wizarding children dead to the world around him. He slipped out of the bed stretching, glad that his human.. human like self had gone sky clad for once.</p><p> </p><p>It was very awkward going from cute tiny human child, to adult tall Kitsune. In moments of controlled yokai he was dressed in a lilac and blue kimono, and left his long silver hair loose. His siken fox years twitched as he slipped from the tower, as he followed his nose after a delightful scent.</p><p> </p><p>He woke every few days since Harry’s blood awakened him. He did hop they merged back into one once puberty hit, after all multiple personalities was not a comfortable thought.</p><p> </p><p>For a kitsune he was a very powerful level, he was born a nine tails.. something he knew shouldn’t be possible. But the power in his blood told him that yes he did have that power.</p><p> </p><p>This issue was, his form was fully adult and adult kitsunes went into heat, guess who had just entered there first heat.</p><p> </p><p>H would have to make sure no pregnancy happened, after all while his body was ready sweet Harry was definitely not.</p><p> </p><p>OoOoO</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Sensei,” a deep husky voice purred, Severus froze not expecting that voice after long hours of grading. There laying on his bed was someone that could only be described as beautiful and not human.</p><p> </p><p>“A kitsune... outside of Japan?” Severus asked, the beauty smirked and he gulped a bit seeing the nine silken tails behind the creature.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmmmm... very far away from it, I’ll go there someday. And you my dear, smell very nice and tasty,” the Kitsune said, the silken folds of there kimono began to slide off there body showing a very nice body flushed in heat.</p><p> </p><p>“This is an invitation by the way,” The Kitsune purred.</p><p> </p><p>It had been a very long time since he’d been lucky.</p><p> </p><p>OoOoO</p><p> </p><p>The potions master was very skilled, and for his first time the Kitsune found it perfect. He watched the mans sleeping face, who was quite handsome when not scowling.</p><p> </p><p>One day he may allow kits with this human, because h wouldn’t allow children yet with his other side so young.</p><p> </p><p>Still, his heat wasn’t over but he had to get back to the tower so his human self would wake in hsi own bed and he had to cleanse his body of the mating.</p><p> </p><p>“See you soon lovely,” he purred, and was gone.</p><p> </p><p>After all, a heat would last a week so he’d be waking up every night for a bit.</p><p> </p><p>OoOoO</p><p> </p><p>Harry woke with a yawn, stretching and feeling more relaxed then he had in months.</p><p> </p><p>He must have slept deep to be this relaxed.</p><p> </p><p>TBC</p>
