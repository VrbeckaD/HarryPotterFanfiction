  <strong>Monday, 5th of August 2002</strong>
</p><p>That morning, Hermione woke up earlier than usual. The sky was dark, and most souls were still running wild in their dreams. The gentle breeze from the open window beside her bed made chills run down her spine. She closed the window and turned over to face the blank wall. She huddled into the covers and tried in vain to fall asleep again. Hermione’s mind kept racing no matter what calming techniques she tried. Giving up on sleep, she took a deep breath, sighed, and heaved herself up from the mattress.</p><p>The floor was ice cold under her bare feet, and she quickly walked to her bathroom. She turned the shower on and undressed from her grey, slip nightgown. The warm water running over her face made her feel a little better. She attempted to steady her beating heart. She was anxious. Yesterday, she’d arrived back in Britain for the first time in more than three years.</p><p>After finishing her education, Hermione had decided to start over somewhere new. She wanted a fresh start. Her memories from the war and all that had transpired haunted her too much to stay. She could not look at her friends without thinking about everything they’d all lost or seeing all the pain that surrounded her.</p><p>She’d fled to Italy to start over, enrolling at the <em>Trotula Institute of Magical Healing </em>in Salerno. Hermione threw herself into her studies, devoting every waking hour to learning about healing.</p><p>When she first left the Isle, she’d wanted to become a tranquil girl—someone who took walks on the beach under a waxing moon, someone who’d listen to the bird’s song and find beauty in it. </p><p>She wanted to feel the world breathing around her, but she’d started living in her head like a madwoman locked in a tower instead. Hermione felt like she was hearing the wind howling through her hair, just waiting for someone to rescue her from her own mind and nightmares.</p><p>She knew she had a chance of creating a new life for herself, a good life, yet she could not muster the energy to live the life she had. When she had a free moment, she buried herself in fantastic stories, spending all her time living imaginary lives so unlike her own. Stories with happy endings.</p><p>Still, she was never able to escape the war--because even after it was over, it continued in her mind.</p><p>Hermione realized that no matter how far she ran, she could never run away from herself. No matter where she went, her memories and nightmares were still the same. After three years of healing school and distractions, she’d come to the conclusion that she needed to stop fantasizing about running away to some other life; it was time to take action and start figuring out the one she had.  </p><p>So… She came back. Back to Britain, back to the life she’d left behind. Back to her home, or what was left of it. Back to her friends, whom she had not spoken to in far too long. Back to everything she’d fled from, years prior. She came back so that perhaps one day she’d be able to move forward.</p><p>When Hermione got out of the shower, she toweled off quickly and began drying her hair with several charms. It was longer these days; the weight made the curls stretch out, leaving her hair more manageable. She began the task of gathering it in a French braid that snaked down her back, all the way down to her waist.</p><p>She glanced at her own reflection in the still dewy mirror and it was like she could see herself for the first time since she’d left. Her skin was pale, her eyes too large for her small face; two empty, dark pits engulfing the rest of her features. Her cheeks were hollow, and her gaze was tired. Her body was thin, plain, nearly flat. She looked much like a starved child. She hated the way she looked. Hated that her trauma was still written all over her features, all over her body. She hated that she couldn’t hide it. She knew that neither charms nor makeup would do the job. She turned away from the looking glass.</p><p>Walking back into her bedroom, she donned some simple underwear, a grey dress, stockings, and some loafers. She was set to start her trainee year at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries later that morning.</p><p>Hermione walked into her kitchen and poured some cat food into Crookshanks’ bowl. Opening the fridge, she retrieved the packed lunch she’d made the previous evening and put a charm on it to keep it cold before she put it in her purse. She poured herself some cereal and brewed a mug of coffee before heading over to the small kitchen table. She tried to take her time eating the meal one tiny piece of cereal at a time. After 20 minutes, both her bowl and mug were empty and it was still before 5 o’clock in the morning. She was not expected to be at the hospital for another hour.</p><p>A tapping from her window made her jump in her seat, and she turned to see a barn owl tapping the glass. She opened the window and paid the bird for the Prophet it brought.</p><p>She settled down once more and began reading. None of the pieces were of any interest to her, but still, she trudged on, trying to make time tick by faster so she could leave her tiny, quiet flat for the bustling magical hospital. </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione’s eyes flickered around the room they were located in as the head healer - her new mentor, Hippocrates Smethwyck, welcomed that year’s ten new healer trainees to the program. Crystal bubbles full of candles floated up on the ceiling, looking like giant soapsuds lighting the wards as they moved through the hospital. Smethwyck was a man in his mid 50’s. He seemed like a no-nonsense kind of mentor and she quickly found that she rather liked him.</p><p> “A month ago, you were in school, learning the theory and perfecting healing spells. Today, you are the healers,” he said, eyeing them all with his piercing brown eyes. He prosed on.</p><p>“Once your training here is completed, in three years’ time, only four of you will remain. Statistically speaking two of you will break under the pressure, two will switch to easier specialties, and two will be asked to leave,” he continued. Hermione tried to bring her mind back into focus. She was distracted.</p><p>Once she’d arrived on the ground floor that morning, she’d quickly recognized a few of the faces in her group of new trainees. Theo Nott from her year at Hogwarts was present, as well as Hannah Abbott and Terry Boot. A Gryffindor from the year below her at school named Eloise Midgen was also there, as well as a few faces she’d seen before but couldn’t put a name to. A few completely new faces were also present; presumably, they’d gone to other magical schools.</p><p>Hermione followed behind the group as they continued on their tour of the hospital. So far, they’d seen the ground floor, which contained the Artefact Accident ward, the reception, and the Apparition Point. They’d been to the first floor that contained wards connected to Creature-Induced Injuries and the second floor that was dedicated to Magical Bugs, such as dragon pox and scrofungulus.</p><p>As they made it up to the third floor, an odd kind of odor filled the hall. It reminded her of Snape’s classroom at Hogwarts.</p><p>“This is the Potion and Plant Poisoning floor,” the healer told them, as he pushed two doors open to the corridor inside. The corridor was filled with different wards on either side. At the end of the hallway, a pair of swinging doors opened. exposing a potions lab.</p><p>“We usually cook up easy antidotes and the likes in here ourselves. We also use this room as a skills lab for you trainees. I suggest you use it as often as you have an opportunity!” Smethwyck told them.</p><p>The fourth floor was for Spell Damage victims. It also held the infamous Janus Thickey Ward – St. Mungo’s ward for long-term residents. Witches and wizards with permanent spell damage resided in this ward. She remembered the ward from her visit at St. Mungo’s during fifth-year, and it still looked much the same.</p><p>Hermione’s throat closed up as she caught sight of the once so beautiful Alice Longbottom sitting on a bed in her robe. Shaking her head, and averting her eye from the slumping figure, she tried to regain her wits.</p><p>They did not linger in the ward and made it to the final floor of the hospital.</p><p>A tearoom and a small gift shop were located on the fifth floor. Healer Smethwyck led them past the public areas and through a set of doors behind the cafeteria. They found themselves in a large locker room. The head healer pointed to four doors on the far wall.</p><p>“We have two on-call rooms for sleep.” He gestured to the doors farthest to the left.</p><p>“The other door in the middle leads to shower stalls and a lavatory.”</p><p>He gestured to the last door. “Staff kitchen and lunchroom through there, use it when you find the time. The tearoom here does not offer many options so I’d suggest you bring a packed lunch,” he said a bit grudgingly.</p><p>He left them there to wait for their new supervisors and they quickly changed from their own outer robes into the St. Mungo’s standard-issue green hospital robes they were required to wear. On her left breast lapel, the hospital emblem was embroidered in gold. It depicted a wand and bone, crossed.</p><p>The staff was allowed to wear their own clothing under the lime robes, though the clothes had to be modest and in neutral colors. Hermione’s knee-length, grey dress fit the bill perfectly. From her newly assigned locker, she retrieved her nameplate and fastened it on her right lapel. Finally, she transferred her wand from her outer robes to her hospital ones. She sat down on one of the many benches in the stuffy locker room and waited.</p><p>Suddenly, the door leading out to the public area swung open and two healers stepped in.</p><p>“Hi,” they both said with smiles on their faces as they caught sight of the trainees waiting.</p><p>“I’m Adrian Pucey, and this is Alica Spinnet,” Adrian introduced.</p><p>“We are third-year trainees here at St. Mungo’s and we will be in charge of you,” Spinnet added.</p><p>“We’ll divide you into two groups and be responsible for five each, if Eloise Midgen, Hannah Abbott, Terry Boot, Samuel Burbage, and Isobel MacDougal will come with me,” Spinnet droned and half the trainees got up and followed her out.</p><p>Pucey stayed in the room.</p><p>“Great,” he smiled. “That leaves me with Christina Yaxley, Rolf Cattermole, Theodore Nott, Herman Munter, and Hermione Granger.” He sat down across from them.</p><p>The five trainees looked at each other. Nott was the only one she knew in her group and she inwardly cursed at the fact that she had not been paired with either Abbott, Boot, or Midgen. She also vaguely remembered Pucey from school. He’d been two years ahead of her year at Hogwarts and, of course, Spinnet had played quidditch for the Gryffindor team.</p><p>“I have four rules and you will all memorize them! Rule number one. Don’t bother sucking up. I already hate you, that’s not likely to change for quite a while!” Pucey began, voice stern.  </p><p>“We use Patronuses to communicate. If you receive a message you will answer it at a run. A run! That’s rule number two. And people, if you don’t already know how to cast one, yesterday was the time to learn it. It’s required. Figure it out!” He rushed on.</p><p>“You’re trainees, the trolls of this hospital, nobodies. You do the tests, write the orders, work every second night until you drop, and you do not complain! Your first shift begins now and lasts for 30 hours,” he smiled.</p><p>“As the Head told you, we have several ‘On-call Rooms’, these are intended for sleeping, not sex. I’d advise you to sleep when you can, where you can, which brings me to rule number three. If I’m sleeping, do not wake me unless your patient is bloody dying!”</p><p>They all chuckled a bit, then fell quiet. Pucey did not continue, he seemed to be weighing them up, one by one, with his eyes.</p><p>“Healer Pucey?” Hermione inquired.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You said four rules. That was only … three.” She continued.</p><p>Nott snorted. ‘Know-it-all’ she heard him whisper under his breath next to her. </p><p>In that very moment, a silver raccoon came running up to Pucey.</p><p>“Adrian Pucey to the first floor: Dai Llewellyn Ward,” a male voice spoke.</p><p>Pucey looked up at them all then pushed off the bench and bolted for the door. “Rule number four! When I move, you move—come along!” He called over his shoulder as he ran through the door. They hurried after him.</p><p>When they made it to the Creature-Induced Injuries floor, she saw an older man lying on a table shaking violently. A healer was standing over him trying to make the man swallow a potion. His nametag said ‘Augustus Pye’. Pucey rushed over and helped restrain the man. Once the potion was in his system, he seemed to calm down but stayed alert.</p><p>“What happened?” Pucey wheezed.</p><p>“Bit by the right head of a baby Runespoor. Poor lad works for ‘the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures’ and was on a mission where they had gotten wind that someone was trying to smuggle the snake into the country,” Pye answered as he began applying Dittany to the bites.</p><p>“Don’t just stand there,” Pucey barked at the group who stood stunned watching. “Someone, get me a vial of ‘Antidote to Common Poison’ as well as ‘Blood Replenisher’.”</p><p>“The rest of you help contain the mauling,” Pye smiled. He was amazingly cool in the heated situation.</p><p>Hermione rushed to the potions cabinet and got the vials she needed. The potions could not be <em>Accio’d</em>, due to security measures created by the hospital as a result of theft. One had to be wearing healer robes to open the medicine cabinets located in every ward.</p><p>Quickly, she shut the cupboard and made it back to the patient. She poured the potions down the patient’s throat and set to work with the others, healing and containing the wounds.</p><p>Pye stepped away as they worked and cast a diagnostic.</p><p>“He’s made it out of the storm. Good work,” he congratulated and left them to finish up.</p><p>Once finished they moved the man into a cot. Hermione cast a <em>Scourgify </em>as well as a <em>Tergeo </em>to clean up the mess they’d made.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The day slowed down a bit after the morning’s excitement. Adrian had patients on all floors, and they completed rounds, getting to know the different cases.</p><p>While on the second floor, a woman was brought in and they went to help her. Before they could make it all the way to her cot, Pucey turned around and winced.</p><p>“She seems to have caught Spattergoits,” he told them, gesturing to the woman’s face. Painful purplish-red boils covered her neck and face.</p><p>The woman in question wheezed as she tried to talk to them from the great distance. “I don’t know what happened,” she told them, her voice strained. “I was taking a nap and when I woke up, I felt fatigued and my muscles and joints hurt a lot.”</p><p>She started coughing and Pucey conjured a glass of water that he levitated over to her bedside.</p><p>“It looks like you caught Spattergoits,” he told the woman. “As it is highly contagious, we’ll have to place you under quarantine for some time.”</p><p>The woman sighed but nodded. Her throat seemed to have swelled to a point where it physically hurt for her to speak.</p><p>When the group went on to the next patient, Hermione stayed behind. She felt as though something was amiss. Quickly she performed a <em>bubble-head charm</em> and went to the woman’s bedside.</p><p>“Do you mind if I run a diagnostic charm on you?” She asked the woman.</p><p>The patient shook her head and watched Hermione with grateful eyes.</p><p>Hermione cast a quick <em>Constituto Venenuma </em>to see whether the body contained any poisons or venoms. The result came back positive. She scratched her head. Leaning in closer to get a look at the boils, she noticed small puncture holes in each of the purplish-red spots.</p><p>“They’re bites, not boils,” she muttered to herself.</p><p>“What do you think you are doing?” A male voice barked from behind her.</p><p>She turned around to find her trainee group and Pucey staring at her.</p><p>“Sir,” she began, but he cut her off.</p><p>“I require you to keep up when I move, Granger,” he stated and there was acid in his voice.</p><p>Swallowing she tried again. “Sir, these aren’t boils, they’re bites. Doxy bites if I had to make a guess,” she stated.</p><p>Her group of trainees seemed to tense. Theo Nott and Christina Yaxley were fighting smiles, indicating that they both found it hilarious that Hermione was arguing with her supervisor on the first day. Rolf Cattermole’s mouth hung open at Hermione’s gall, and Hermann Munter was looking at her as though he was trying to solve a puzzle. Munter's eyes were narrowed and he seemed to be biting his cheek. The tall, blonde had struck Hermione as rather arrogant when she first greeted him. Deeming by the look on Munter’s face at that moment he seemed to be angry that he hadn’t made the discovery himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Nonsense, I already diagnosed her,” Pucey scoffed and Hermione's eyes snapped back to him.</p><p>“But, Sir,” she repeated.</p><p>Pucey looked exasperated. “Come along, Granger,” he sighed and turned around again.</p><p>However, Hermione did not move from her place beside the woman’s bed.</p><p>“Do we have a problem here?” A warm voice cut in. Hippocrates Smethwyck walked towards them with a smile on his face.</p><p>“No, we're fine, Si-,” Pucey stated, glaring at her, but she cut him off.</p><p>“Sir, I believe this woman is suffering from an allergic reaction to Doxy venom,” she stated.</p><p>The Head Healer looked at her. “Please explain, Miss Granger,” he said kindly. “What makes you believe that, and how would you proceed if you were to diagnose this patient?”</p><p>She sucked in a lungful of air and then let the words rush out. “Well, Sir, first of all, I would have listened to the patient while she was still able to talk,” she replied and shot Pucey a dirty look.</p><p>“The patient claimed to have symptoms of muscle and joint pain in addition to the fatigue. And the spots, though they do look a lot like Spattergroits in size and placement, are slightly too red in my opinion.”</p><p>Taking another lungful of air, she continued. “If this was my patient, Sir, I would use the <em>Constituto Venenuma </em>diagnostic to see whether or not the body contained any venom. When it was confirmed to me that the boils contained poison, I would study them closer and realize they are in fact doxy bites. I would administer a dose of the ‘Antidote to Uncommon Poisons’ and watch for an allergic reaction to the poison. I would also have examined the rest of the body for more bites. I would treat all bites with the Essence of Dittany,” she finished, then added, a bit smugly, “The patient would be able to leave within a few hours, instead of months, as is the case for Spattergroits.”</p><p>The head healer studied her. “Did you cast the diagnostic and find venom?” He inquired.</p><p>“Yes, Sir,” she answered.</p><p>“Mr. Nott - confirm the diagnosis. Miss Yaxley - get the potions she mentioned and start administering treatment,” he barked to Theo and Christina, who stood at the forefront of the group.</p><p>Adrian looked as though he wanted to murder her. She swallowed.</p><p>As the others rushed past her, she turned back to Smethwyck. “What are the symptoms of doxy bites, Miss Granger?” He asked her, brown eyes twinkling with mirth.</p><p>“Well, there is fever, headaches, muscle and joint pain, and in case of an allergic reaction, an inflamed throat. That could cause the patient to struggle communicating and experience shortness of breath. Lastly, fatigue and tender or inflamed bites.”</p><p>Smethwyck grinned and turned to Pucey.  “Well, Mr. Pucey, take note! We always run diagnostics, no matter how small or simple the case might seem. Seems like you got yourself a good study, Adrian. Miss Granger, keep up the good work!”</p><p>She gave him a curt nod and he left them be. Pucey was fuming. If he thought he was concealing his anger, he was wrong. The boy was being as subtle as a giant. He did not reprimand her, but she knew punishment for her little stunt would be delivered soon enough.</p><hr/><p>As day turned into night, and then the night turned into a new day, the group of trainees became more and more tired. They were all lounging in the locker room, enjoying the calm of the early morning, consuming a cartload of snacks they’d bought in the Tea Room and getting to know each other.</p><p>“I’m telling you, the Institute of Salem is the best Healing School there is!” Christina insisted with her mouth full of pumpkin pasty.</p><p>Christina was an American Witch with a thick New York accent. She was of half-Chinese, half-British heritage. Her British family had moved to America in the mid-1800s and was only distantly related to the Yaxleys that resided in England today.</p><p>Nott was shaking his head. “No way! Both Rolf and I went to the Akhr Academy in Cairo. It was a bloody brilliant school. Right, Rolf?” He insisted.</p><p>Rolf Cattermole nodded. He was a mousey little man, shy and rather quiet. Apparently, he’d been a year below her at Hogwarts, a Ravenclaw.</p><p>“Where did you attend?” The last boy of the group asked her, dragging her back into the conversation. His name was Hermann Munter and he’d gone to Durmstrang. He had informed the others that he'd been top of his year there when introducing himself.</p><p>Munter came from Sweden and had attended MagiMalmö Medischool, a very modern healing school in Scandinavia.</p><p>“I went to the Trotula Institute in Salerno,” she stated, picking up an apple.</p><p>“They offer a lot of controversial classes, don’t they?” Nott inquired. “What additional classes did you take?”</p><p>“Yeah, they do. Uhm, I took ‘Modern Magical Healing,’ and ‘A Guide to Mind Healing,’” she answered, biting into the apple.</p><p>“‘Modern Magical Healing’? Isn’t that mostly about how we can adapt muggle healing techniques to branch out? What a waste of a class!” Nott noted.</p><p>Hermione finished chewing, raising her eyebrow at him.</p><p>“It was really interesting actually. I’m sure you’ll have much more use for the ‘Most Common Curses in Ancient Egypt’ or whatever nonsense you chose,” she said sarcastically. </p><p>After a moment, she continued. “Actually, I’d be willing to bet galleons that I’ll be able to use something I learned in those classes before you’re able to use something you learned in yours!”</p><p>Nott snorted. “Aegrotos sanabit ars magica - magic will heal the sick, Granger. You’re on!” He stated, confidently.</p><hr/><p>As their shift was nearing an end, they split up in two groups for a final round to check on Pucey’s patients. Theo and Hermione were making their way to the ‘Artefacts Accidents Ward’ located on the ground floor. They were on the steps close to the apparition point when they heard a strangled cry.</p><p>“Help, I need help—he’s dying!” A blond woman sobbed, holding a soaking man with blood streaming down his arm. The man seemed to be unconscious, and the woman was clutching him to her chest, her hair hanging like a curtain over them, screening their faces from being seen.</p><p>Hermione rushed towards the pair on the floor, Theo on her heel. When they got close enough to catch a proper look at the bloodied arm, they both gasped.</p><p>What met their eyes was a badly carved up Dark Mark and it was gushing blood…</p>
