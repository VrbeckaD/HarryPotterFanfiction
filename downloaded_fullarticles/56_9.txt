    <p>“We’re getting an Omega.”</p><p>“I don’t want an Omega, and don’t pout, you’re the most feared Werewolf in Britain.”</p><p>“But Severussss!”</p><p>Ignoring his whining mate plastered to his back, Severus picked up the ladle, and stirred his potion.</p><p>“Hand me the dried dung.”</p><p>The bottled dung was obediently given to him, and he sprinkled it into the now bubbling purple liquid.</p><p>“Come on,” Fenrir huffed, settling his chin on top of the other’s head, “don’t you want to come home to a sweet thing, a home cooked meal, and mind blowing sex?”</p><p>“And here I was believing the sex we were having was already mind blowing.”</p><p>“It is, but it’ll been even more mind blowing with an Omega.”</p><p>“Somehow, I doubt that,” Severus said dryly, lowing the fire, “and we’re Werewolves, since when have we ever cared if our meals are cooked or not? Or even have flavor?”</p><p>“Tell that to that giant arse cake you got hidden in the cup broad.”</p><p>“Leave my three layered triple chocolate cake out of this.”</p><p>Chuckling, Fenrir watched as his mate work, it never cease to amaze him, and probably will continue to do so.</p><p>“…..Why <strong><em><b><em>do</em></b></em></strong> you want another mate?”</p><p>The soft, almost not there, venerable tone, had Fenrir tighten his arms, and moving his head to nuzzling Severus’s neck in comfort.</p><p>“I adore, and love you.” Fenrir soothed, “And everything about you. Snark included. Me wanting another mate does not mean I’ve tired of you, and plan on throwing you away. You are mine, just as I am yours.”</p><p>“.….Then why?”</p><p>“Because I see the way you look at the parents with their children.” Severus went still in his arms, “I know how much you want children, and how much you hate not being able to bear cubs for yourself, and I.”</p><p>“Fenrir—”</p><p>The Werewolf shushed him as he gently took the ladle out of Severus’s hand to settle it on the table, before turning him around to face him. Rumbling deeply from his chest, Fenrir pressed a kiss to the other’s forehead.</p><p>“We don’t even have to mate with them if you don’t want to, surrogate is fine.”  </p><p>Severus leaned up against the Wolf, brows furrowing in thought. He did want cubs, but he didn’t want a surrogate. Despite his earlier protests, He wanted a Omega, to love, and care for in a way Fenrir didn’t allow, and he was okay with that, but didn’t stop him from wanting. Wanting to come home to warm food and equally warm smile, wanting to be greeted with the thunder of little feet, the problem was, unlike Fenrir, who had that animalistic appeal to him. Severus knew he wasn’t a handsome man, he wasn’t an agreeable person to be around most days, his only redeeming quality was his potion making and that he was an Alpha. What Omega would want him?</p><p> “I can hear your brain thinking.”</p><p>Hands cupped his cheek, and lifted his head up to meet searching amber eyes, they narrowed when they found whatever it was he was looking for.</p><p>“You doubt yourself, doubt that there is an Omega out there that would want you for a mate.”</p><p>“And my doubt has merit,” Severus moved his head out of the Wolf’s grip.</p><p>“Most of those merits were because of assholes who taught you that you have no worth, that you don’t deserve to be happy.”</p><p>Severus doesn’t flinch, but his eyes go cold, Fenrir charged through like a bull in a china shop.</p><p>“You want an Omega, you want a child. I want you to have those things, I want you to be happy, because you deserve to be.”</p><p>Severus goes back to his potion, one part annoyed, and another part happy and touched that his mate was so….adamant about his happiness.</p><p>“I’m not above going behind your back,” Fenrir then said.</p><p>Fenrir would do it too, and not feel one ounce of shame, even when he’s kicked out the bedroom for a week, mainly because the bastard would sneak back in and cuddle Severus into forgiveness.</p><p>“I also really want to see you fuck, and knot an Omega.”</p><p>Severus smacked him with the ladle, eyes sparkling with amusement. “Fine,” He then gave in after five more minutes of begging and whining, “we can at least try some introductions.”</p><p>Fenrir grinned, and held him tighter.</p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em> <b> <em>~.~</em> </b> </em> </strong>
</p><p>A month later, Severus and Fenrir were sitting in a parlor, Narcissa fluttering around them making sure they looked presentable for their first introduction.</p><p>“I really wish you would have let me take you shopping Sev,” the Alpha sighed.</p><p> Severus folded his arms over his chest, “My wardrobe is fine.”</p><p> Narcissa rolled her eyes, “Everything you own is black, you could have at least added some greys. Or something besides your usual robes”</p><p>“Black is a perfectly respectable color, as are my robes”</p><p>“Yes, but you want to make a good impression, I mean, Fenrir wore a shirt.”</p><p>Fenrir indeed had worn a shirt, a fitting one even, though it did not seem hide much of his muscular body, something Severus did not mind one bit, and maybe their potential future mate wouldn’t either.</p><p>The door opened, Remus, mate to Lucius and Nacrissa and Omega, smiled at the two. He, like the Malfoys was an old friend of theirs, specifically Fenrir’s. He smiled at his mate’ and Severus’ bickering, before clearing his throat. “Darling, I have the papers you asked for.”</p><p>“Thank you Remus,” Nacrissa took the papers and handed them over to Severus, “go over these once more, make sure everything’s in order.</p><p>Before all this started, Severus had given the Malfoys some requirements. One was that they had to have an education, while he would love to have an stay at home Omega, he would also love if they had a career of their own if they decided to go in that direction. Which came to number two, he did not want subservient, yes submission in some aspects, but he did not want that to be it. He wanted a mate to tell them no, especially with the way he and Fenrir were at times. Number three, have skill in keeping house. Severus himself could clean and cook basic meals when needed, but some help would not be amiss, Fenrir tried, but it usually doesn’t even well. Number four, he didn’t care about whether they came from a well to do Pack or not.  Though knowing Lucius and Nacrissa as he does, they will look into bloodlines, mainly dealing with fertility; since both had made mention they wanted children.</p><p>All and all, pretty basic requests.</p><p>The two Malfoys had gotten to work, gathering dozens of candidate papers, all of which were sorted through and handpicked by both Severus and Fenrir, and narrowing it down to about twenty, which surprised the Malfoys as they knew how picky Severus could be, especially when he was nervous. Which is how they got here, meeting the first five.</p><p>Once sure, the papers were handed back, and Nacrissa told them the first candidate would be with them shortly.</p><p>Which apparently meant five minutes.</p><p>It was a male, older then what they were expecting, and more beautiful then handsome. He took one look at Severus, and wrinkled his nose. Fenrir all but threw him out, before turning his attention to his mate, nuzzling and rubbing his scent all over him.</p><p>Whelp, they were off to a great start.</p><p>Their next guests was more polite, younger than the other, and had her first Heat.  And she loved to talk.</p><p>The next was another young man, Oliver Wood, friendly,  but it was obvious that he was merely here on request of a most likely pushy relative; it happened from time to time.</p><p>The fourth candidate was barely seated before the door burst open, and a tall beta had came in confessing her love for the Omega, and saying how she didn’t care about status or what her bastard of a grandfather thought. She also went nearly toe to toe with Fenrir who thought it both hilarious and romantic, and decided he should play the role of jilted courtier. Severus just watched it all while nibbling on the bowl of fruit that Remus had provided earlier.</p><p>They were invited to the wedding.</p><p>The last one were not as entertaining.</p><p>Around the fourth day, Severus was being to give up hope, especially when he got the next set of papers, which was a depressing number of three.</p><p>“Ah, Severus, Fenrir, a minute please.”</p><p>Pausing just outside the parlor door, both turned around and watched as the Werewolf made his way over.</p><p>Remus smiled at the two, “I’m glad I caught you, here.”</p><p>In his hand was a paper, “….It’s a candidate.”</p><p>Severus’s eyes narrowed at the somewhat nervous Omega, Fenrir noticed it too, tilting his head curiously.</p><p>“Did Lucius and Narcissa forget one?” The big Alpha asked, voice holding some doubt.</p><p>“Well, it’s more along the fact that Lucius would most likely dump it the moment he saw the name.” Remus sighed in exasperation, “But not because of the reasons you think!” he then added hastily at Severus’s raised brow.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Remus bite his bottom lip nervously, “Just please, at least see them?”</p><p>Severus looked at Fenrir, who shrugged, “Not gonna hurt anyone, beside I’m kind of curious.”</p><p>If Severus, was honest, so was he. What kind of person was this candidate that Remus was so obviously sneaking behind his mates’ back for?</p><p>“Very well, though they will be last.”</p><p>“Understandable,” Remus nodded, “I’ll escort them when it’s time.”</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em> <b> <em>~.~</em> </b> </em> </strong>
</p><p>This list of candidates were better then last three, which gave both some hope. So after saying goodbye to the last. They took a quick break before meeting their mysterious fourth.</p><p> The door opened, and <strong><em><b><em>holy shit</em></b></em></strong> that smell! Beside him, Fenrir rumbled, and shifted.</p><p>Dear Merlin, he was tiny. Okay, not tiny. But, compare to everyone else they’ve seen, he was small. Not mention both Severus and Fenrir were very tall, Fenrir beating Severus by a head.</p><p>Black hair that was unruly, green eyes, skinned tanned like he all he did was spend his days in the sun. He wore simple clothes, but it did nothing to hide the Omega curves and hips.  </p><p>The Omega sat down, fidgeting a little under their gaze.</p><p>“Erm,” he said, “my name is Harry, it’s nice to meet you.”</p><p>He was biting his bottom lip, making it all red and plump,  dear heavens.</p><p>“A pleasure,” Severus managed out, voice deeper than usual, “you’re information was very limited, so please, tell us about yourself.”</p><p>“Oh yes! I’m sixteen.”</p><p>So, of age, good.</p><p>“I can clean, I like to cook.”</p><p>“Like too?”</p><p>That was different, everyone else was they could, not that they liked it.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because it’s fun.” Harry’s face light up, and he bounced a little in his seat, Fenrir thought it adorable, “Creating new recipes, or tweaking an old one to see what comes out of it. Whether the outcome is good or bad, there’s just something about it that gives me a sense of: I did that with my own two hands.”</p><p><em><em>“Sounds like Sev with his potions,” </em></em>Fenrir thought, it was a pleasant realization.</p><p>“Can you do desserts?” Severus asked a little eager.</p><p>Harry nodded, “I can do cookies, cobbler, brownies, and cupcakes. I just started doing cakes a few weeks back.”</p><p>Fenrir had to hold  back on laughter, his mate looked five seconds away from proposing right then and there. “What are your thoughts on children?” The Alpha then asked.</p><p>Harry doesn’t answer right away, in fact his expression turned thoughtful, then almost hesitantly he spoke.  “Erm, can I ask some questions?”</p><p>Fenrir and Severus glanced at each other, curious, then Severus nodded, “Of course.”</p><p>“…..Why do you want an Omega?”</p><p>That was….that was an interesting question, none of the others bothered to ask. Most likely because it wasn’t unheard of for any Alpha to want an Omega.</p><p>Fenrir answered first, “Mostly because I want to watch him fuck and knot one. And I know he wants to watch me do the same.”</p><p>Harry squeaked, and his face turned red.  Severus groaned at his mate’s bluntness, his nose suddenly twitched and he blinked at the unmistakable scent of aroused Omega. It was low, but definitely there and definitely coming from Harry…..interesting.</p><p>Fenrir shifting, told Severus that the other had noticed. Clearing his throat, he stirred the conversation back on track.</p><p>“While that is true,” Severus spoke up,  giving his mate a look that said to ease up a little on the bluntness,“we also want an Omega, because we want to love and care for someone in a way that neither of us will allow each other to do. An Alpha’s nature is.....it’s hard to be vulnerable around another Alpha, yes, two Alpha can be mates. But it isn’t long before we’re at each other’s throat fighting for dominance.”</p><p>And it’s true, while he and Fenrir don’t get into constant fights like most Alphas, they still did.</p><p>“So, you want a buffer?” Harry didn’t sound upset, just curious.</p><p>Fenrir shook his head, “No, what we want, we want because there is a space between us. And we just feel like, having a another mate, an equal, is just the right fit for us.”</p><p><em><em>“And maybe for you too.”</em></em> Is the unspoken but easily heard.</p><p>Harry doesn’t have any more questions on the subject, instead asking them about other things, and answering their questions. And when they were done, and Harry left. Fenrir didn’t even have to ask, they had found their mate.</p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em> <b> <em>~.~</em> </b> </em> </strong>
</p><p>The moment the door closed, Severus is lifted, and carried to the bed,</p><p>“Damn that pup smelt so good!” Fenrir growled as he hastily removed his clothes.“Wanted to fuck him right then and there.”</p><p>Severus made a noise of agreement, as he removed his own clothes. With clothes tossed on the floor, Severus is flipped onto his belly, and arse in the air.</p><p>“Put my knot in him,” Fenrir purred as he parted an arse cheek with one hand while he wet the other with his mouth.</p><p>“Did you see his mouth?” Severus pushed back against the hand, rubbing against length that was hard, “all soft looking, lips red and plump from him biting on them.”</p><p>Fenrir growled as he released his fingers with a wet pop, “You wanted to fuck it, didn’t you.”</p><p>Severus nodded, moaning when a finger was pushed passed his tight hole.</p><p>“Maybe even knot it.” Fenrir twisted and crooked his finger, grin turning feral at the loud moan. “Wouldn’t that be a sight, our cute little Omega taking both our knots.”</p><p>Severus whimpered, “Him round with our cubs.”</p><p>Fenrir cursed, reaching down to squeeze his cock, preventing it from cumming. Another finger is hastily added, prep is hurried, then Fenrir is in him, hands tight on waist as he fucked his gasping and moaning mate.</p><p>“What you to fuck him just like this,” Fenrir’s voice is slurred as his fangs enlarged as his control started to slip, “make him let out pretty noises.”</p><p>Severus moaned loudly, whether because the Alpha was now pounding at his prostate or the thought of fucking the Omega, Fenrir didn’t know as he leaned over to clamp his fangs on the back of Severus’s neck. He didn’t last long, cumming and knotting inside his mate.</p><p>“We’re going to cuddle him the next time we see him.” Severus panted, shivering when his mate’s twitched, pushing the knot deeper.</p><p>Fenrir grunted in agreement before seeing if he could make Severus cum a second time.</p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em> <b> <em>~.~</em> </b> </em> </strong>
</p><p>Choosing Harry came with two problems.</p><p>The first was that, apparently, Harry was Narcissa’s godson, or godson-in-law. She had been caring for him after the boy’s godfather, and Narcissa’s cousin had passed away.</p><p>Lucius and Nacrissa adored the boy.</p><p>Fenrir’s balls had been threaten no less then five times, and Severus discovered that Narcissa could out cuss a sailor.  </p><p>“And you!” Lucius whirled around to snarl at his Omega, who merely raised a brow, not at all threatened, “How dare you go behind our backs!”</p><p>“Oh, don’t get your knickers in a bunch,” Remus huffed, “I did it because one, Harry asked me to, and two, if left to you two, Harry would be old, gray, and still mate-less.”</p><p>Lucius spluttered.</p><p>Sitting in his chair next to his amused god-brother, Draco, Harry wondered if by the end of this he was either going to witness a murder or witness his Uncle’s heart giving out. It’s then that Draco opened his big stupid mouth.</p><p>“Would it help, if I told you I’ve been taking Harry to Alpha introductions since the start of December last year?”</p><p>They were in August.</p><p>There was silence, then Remus spoke in a calm voice that had all the Alphas shivering, “<strong><em><b><em>What.</em></b></em></strong>”</p><p>It was going to be a murder.</p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em> <b> <em>~.~</em> </b> </em> </strong>
</p><p>The second problem was that Harry’s wonderful scent had the two Alphas missing the fact that he was human.  His parents had been humans who had befriend the Omega’s late godfather, when the boy had lost his parents when he had been a Pup of one, then lost his godfather at the age of seven. Lucius and Nacrissa had taken him in,  and the rest was history. None of this changed the fact that Harry was human.</p><p>Werewolves  were designed to be the apex predator,  strength, speed,  stamina , and durability.  Between a fight with a human and Werewolf, the Wolf will always win.  And sex was no exception, a regular mating without a Heat or Rut was…vigorous.<strong><em><b><em> With </em></b></em></strong>it, well, there was a reason why Severus stock plied supplies and demanded that all orders are made at least a month in advance. Nature built Werewolf Omegas  for a lot of things, sex was one of them, able to handle an Alpha’s rut and knot in and out of Heat to insure procreation.</p><p>Human were, not fragile, but if a Wolf wasn’t mindful, they could do some serious damage.</p><p>“You’re not the first ones to mate with a Human Omega, believe it or not.” Remus had shurgged when Severus had brought it up</p><p>And that was it for that conversation.</p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em> <b> <em>~.~</em> </b> </em> </strong>
</p><p>The two problems were nothing compared to the biggest concern.</p><p>Whether or not Harry wanted to accept their courtship, which will hopefully end with them mating. Because regardless of everyone else feelings,  it was still Harry’s decision in the end.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Watching his mate nuzzle against their soon to be Omega, despite Lucius’s protest, and Narcissa’s disapproving glare. Severus was inwardly relieved, if Harry had said no, the Alpha was pretty sure his mate would have picked up the Omega then and there and ran off with him. And Severus is pretty sure he would have been right on his heel. </p>
