  <b>Helga (Wales. Muggleborn)</b>
</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Helga is born to Arthur and Guinevere, King and Queen of Britain. This would be a bigger legacy if it weren’t for what happens next.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Guinevere dies in childbirth. Arthur would never blame Helga, not for a second but he’s in mourning and still king so maybe he can’t be blamed for being a bit of an absent father.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Helga’s brother Ellyn doesn’t blame her either. Or well, he doesn’t want to.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>As far as Ellyn is concerned he’s been forced to exchange a loving mother for a screaming child. He isn’t happy with the swap. But he’s twelve now. He’s an adult.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>(Arthur either doesn’t notice his coldness or puts it down to sibling rivalry. He didn’t get along with his sister either.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>They’re friends now and he tries very, very hard to put aside Morgana’s sins. He forgets.)</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Helga is four when she starts showing signs of magic.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Merlin had been younger but Morgana had been elder.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Arthur makes sure she knows he loves her. She never doubted it, but then, she never met her grandfather.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Ellyn finally <em>understands</em>.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>He loves his sister of course, but he’s always known she killed his mother.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>The only thing is; it’s never made sense that she could kill their mother when he had been a much bigger and stronger baby.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>But magic? It must be hard for someone without magic to carry a magical child.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Of course.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Do not blame him. Helga never did.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Arthur is a good king, a great king, the best there ever was. Still there will always be people who want power and there will always, always be complaints. Ellyn finds these people, collects them and then goes to his father.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Arthur hasn’t been paying enough attention to his son. He was more than self-sufficient at that age so why wouldn’t his son be?</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>(Ellyn has never met Uther Pendragon either)</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Still when his son arrives in an empty throne-room with his hand on his sword even Arthur knows something is wrong.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Ellyn didn’t want his mother to die. He doesn’t want his father to die. He doesn’t want his sister to die. But he’s scared, and he’s young. Neither of these are sins.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>His father won’t yield his stance on magic.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Meanwhile,</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Merlin is teaching Helga. Or is it the other way round? No one can quite tell.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>He feels something dangerous in the air but it’s been so long since they were at war.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>He doesn’t want to ever see war again.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Perhaps he gets his wish because he meets Ellyn before he can reach Arthur.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>He never sees his king’s body.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Ellyn doesn’t want to kill his sister. He might still have killed his uncle if she hadn’t been there.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>He says leave.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>They do.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>They find Morgana while still in Camelot.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>This is deliberate on every side.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Arthur may have forgotten but his kingdom hasn’t. The war was started by Morgana le Fey. Morgana desired the throne above all else.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Morgana has killed the king!</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>The cry runs though the country.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Merlin hides Helga in the folds of his cloak, finds Morgana about to storm the castle, and runs.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>He never does see the war that follows.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>So Helga doesn’t grow up with the legacy of King Arthur on her shoulders</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>But the much worse one of Prince Ellyn, the man who declares magic a killer, who will give gold to anyone who brings him a sorcerer’s head, who gave her a chance to run,</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Who sang her to sleep and never let her notice that her father wasn’t around.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>She grows up on the run.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Hiding in hedgerows and caves. In forests and lakes. In taverns and hermit houses.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>She learns from these: she learns plants and poisons from the wilds. She learns other things in the cities.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Merlin and Morgana try to shield her from the worst of it. They don’t succeed.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Helga takes her first life at age ten.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>She slits his throat the same way she would a wild animal and hides the body in the outhouse.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>They need a place to stay to hide from the storm. Merlin doesn’t question it – it isn’t the first empty home they’ve come across.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>Morgana notices her niece’s shaking hands. She doesn’t question it either.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>After the storm they go to a forest again. That’s when they meet Salazar.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Salazar (England. Muggleborn)</b>

He is given his baby sister to hold and pushed out the back</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>He doesn’t run</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>He doesn’t know what he’s running from yet</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>The fire doesn’t touch him</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>He doesn’t notice but the hunters do</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>They pull him into the village centre</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>They try to fan the flames in his direction. It doesn’t work so they hold him down to torch him.</p><p> </p><p><span><span>-<span>          </span></span></span>His parents are watching.
