          <div class="userstuff"><p>At first Draco's eyes were lightning. They flashed with screams. Fury. Fear. They communicated everything yet held it all inside.</p><p>Then he saw Draco's eyes were overcast: promises of snow, sleet and hail. The reign of distance. Misery. The cold light of winter streetlights.</p><p>When Draco's eyes became cloudy, Harry thought of rain. He hoped he would not see it fall. The distance seemed unbridgeable, yet Harry could not help but imagine a night free of storms, a day free of lightning, a chance encounter with no thunder.</p><p>Harry reached, pushing the storm to recede. </p><p>Then finally, came the sun.</p>

</center>At first, Harry… just <i>friendship</i> with Harry; hell, anything other than angry sparks or miserable, strained <i>politeness</i> with Harry, seemed distant. Impossible. The moon.<p>Harry's eyes: tentative. Starry. Longing? Promised cloudless sun. But the glares from everyone else threatened endings. </p><p>Draco knew better than to trust Harry over the rest of their world. </p><p>Except when he looked up "tenacity," there was Potter's thrice-cursed face.</p>

</center>Draco hid all over the castle.<p>Harry found him.</p><p>He responded with distancing etiquette.</p><p>Harry beamed at him, like he'd offered to hug.</p><p>Finally, Draco capitulated.</p><p>"Potter. Tea?"</p><p>Grinning fear, Potter stuck out a hand. "Please!"</p>

</center>Laughing, Harry twirled in the rain.<p>"I can't even explain, Hermione. I never suspected I was gay. Until he kissed me."</p><p>Shivering, Hermione hovered in the (mostly) dry doorway.</p><p>"But, Harry…" she wavered.</p><p>"I know you don't understand," he said, as he wiped ineffectively at his wet glasses, "but I don't need you to. I just need you to… let me try this. It might be a disaster. He might… Harry hesitated. "He might break my heart. But right now, Hermione, Draco just makes me <i>so, so happy.</i>"</p><p>"Well," Hermione tried. "Ok, Harry. But please, come in from the rain?"</p></div>
