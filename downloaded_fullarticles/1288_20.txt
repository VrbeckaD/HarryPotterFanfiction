  <strong>:  This story is dedicated to Rayne who gave me the “birthday” prompt.  This story could be canon or not.  Canon says little about Abraxas or his unnamed wife who was Lucius’s mother.  For this story, I am establishing that Lucius’s mother died months after her son’s birth because she never recovered from the stress of the birth.  Lucius is three-years-old, almost four, in this story, but since his father has had sole care of him, his pureblood behavior has left him very mature for his age.  Abraxas does break character a bit in this story and so does Lucius.  However, I think it’s understandable.  I have established that this is the first time that Abraxas has spoken to Lucius about his mother, and I am also operating under the assumption that Abraxas, pureblood though he was, did harbor some degree of feeling toward his wife.  That Lucius lived and his mother didn’t sets up a difficult situation for Lucius to be raised in.</strong>
</p>
<p>            “Lucius, come here,” Abraxas said, standing at the door to his son’s playroom.  Even at three-years-old, Lucius knew better than to allow the room to get into disarray.  Currently, Lucius was looking at one of his special magical books, the kind that would, upon touching the cover in a special sequence, read to him over and over again.  Additional pictures and movement were available whenever he spoke the words with the magical voice.  It was the latest thing for the early education of magical children, but the books were expensive and only available to the wealthy.  Of course, Abraxas had a standing order for each book as soon as it was published.</p>
<p>            Lucius looked up at Abraxas.  “Yes, Father,” he said, moving immediately to stand, taking care to lower himself to the floor from his chair rather than jumping down like a child of the common rabble.  He smoothed his short robe and the trousers and shirt that he wore beneath, the one concession to his age.  Then Lucius closed his book and returned it to its appropriate place on the shelf.  His house elf nanny bowed low to him as he passed her, but he paid her no mind as he followed his father. </p>
<p>            Abraxas said nothing as Lucius walked at his side, but he did shorten his stride in order to allow his son to keep up with him without breaking into an undignified run.  He did not take the boy’s hand, and he certainly did not pick him up and carry him.  Lucius did not expect it because pureblood children understood that one had legs for a reason, and only infants learning to walk required someone to hold their hands.  Lucius was aware that several of his friends were occasionally carried by their parents, but Abraxas had pointed out that they were clearly not as aware of the rules of proper behavior as the Malfoy family was.  His father saw to it that Lucius was carefully watched whenever he was with those lesser children so that any influence they might have on his son’s behavior could be negated.</p>
<p>             Lucius hastily covered his shock when he realized just where his father was going.  While he had, on rare occasion, been allowed to visit the master bedroom, where his father slept, and the study, which was his father’s inner sanctum, he had never been permitted into the room that his father was entering now, gesturing for him to follow.  This room always had the door shut.  Lucius had been sternly warned against even going near the door, and now, Abraxas was allowing him to go inside.</p>
<p>            Inside was a very different world.  It was decorated in pale, feminine colors and filled with delicate embroidery, lace, and ruffles.  There was a padded rocking chair and a Slytherin green blanket was draped over it.  Abraxas stood in the middle of the room, looking around, and Lucius was shocked to see, for a brief moment, complete bewilderment on his father’s face.  Then it was gone.</p>
<p>            “Lucius, today is a very important day.  Do you know what day it is?” Abraxas asked.</p>
<p>            “No, Father.  I do not know,” Lucius answered promptly, having been sternly instructed to always respond aloud rather than with gestures like an animal would.</p>
<p>            “Today is, or would have been, your mother’s birthday.” Abraxas sat down abruptly in the rocking chair, and Lucius was puzzled to see his father sitting in it.  Only a mother sat in such a chair and only to calm a fussy baby.  But his father sat there awkwardly, not rocking, as his aristocratic hands smoothed over the green velvet blanket.</p>
<p>            Lucius did not like this.  His father was not acting like himself, and Lucius was uncertain of how he should respond.  Finally, he gathered his courage.</p>
<p>            “I do not remember my mother, Father,” Lucius said in a small voice.</p>
<p>            Abraxas glanced up from the blanket startled, almost as if he had forgotten for a moment where he was.  His pureblood mask slipped back into place, but Lucius realized that his father was struggling to hold onto it. </p>
<p>            “Of course you would not remember her, Lucius.  You were an infant when she died, less than half a year old.”  Abraxas looked at him, and Lucius glanced down immediately, fearful of what his father might see in his eyes. </p>
<p>            Lucius did not remember his mother, and it was the pureblood way not to speak to very young children about such things like a parent’s death.  However, late at night when the darkness in his room seemed to come alive with monsters that all his father’s teachings could not banish, he wished he could remember her.  It would be nice, during those times when he was shamefully afraid, to think that there was someone soft and warm and gentle who might touch him with the tenderness that he sometimes saw lesser children receive from their mothers. </p>
<p>            It was wrong to want such childish things.  He was a pureblood, the only heir to the house of Malfoy.  His father had already mentioned that he would soon begin giving him lessons in dealing with goblins which meant that his first visit to Gringott’s, the first time he would be officially and legally recognized as his father’s heir, would follow soon after.  It was an important step for a pureblood son especially one whose family held as much standing as his did.</p>
<p>            But there were times he still wished for his mother.</p>
<p>            “Have you any questions about her for me, Lucius?” Abraxas asked.  “While curiosity is not an acceptable trait for a pureblood child, I am willing to indulge you this once.”</p>
<p>            Lucius managed to keep his face immobile, but he could not help his startled glance up at his father.  His father had never allowed him to ask questions about anything, and he would never have dreamed of probing him for information on a topic that could possibly make his father uncomfortable.  Pureblood children knew not to introduce topics that might unsettle their company, and such children certainly knew that they were only permitted to speak when they were spoken to.</p>
<p>            For a moment, Lucius considered asking no questions at all.  Surely, his father would be proud of his restraint!  But his three-year-old mind was ready to burst with questions, and he finally decided that perhaps one question might not be totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>            “How did my mother die?”</p>
<p>            Lucius was not prepared for his father’s response.  The pureblood patriarch rose with undignified haste, every muscle in his body stiff, his robes whirling around him as he turned to face the wall.</p>
<p>            Lucius actually stumbled backward, catching himself on the edge of his mother’s dressing table before he could fall.  Eyes wide, he tried with all his might to get his shock back under control.  An apology for his clearly inappropriate question was on his tongue, but Abraxas spoke before Lucius had a chance.</p>
<p>            “Your mother died mere months after your birth.  Childbirth is difficult in our world, Lucius.  Never forget that when the day comes that your own wife is with child.  This is something that you must learn.  There are very few things that money, power, and magic cannot eliminate or at least forestall.  However, death is one of those things.”</p>
<p>            Abraxas stood straight and tall as always, but Lucius noticed that his hands were restlessly twisting the green blanket. </p>
<p>            “Your birth was difficult, and your mother had been a sickly child who had grown into a weak woman.  She never recovered from your birth.  Her energy simply left her, Lucius.  No healer could tell me why.”  Abraxas looked down at the blanket he held.  “She wrapped you in this every night when she put you in your cradle.  Here in this corner, you can see her embroidery.  As soon as we chose your name, she embroidered it here.”  His fingers traced the silver stitches.  “The night she died, she was holding you in this blanket when she ordered the elves to send for me.”</p>
<p>            Lucius was afraid to speak in the sudden moment of silence.  It seemed almost as if his father was trying to gather his composure.  Surely not!  His father had never lost his composure, not within his memory at least.</p>
<p>            Finally, Abraxas continued.  “She asked me to sit beside her.  She took you and placed you in my arms.”  He paused.  “It was only the second time that I had held you.  The first time had been at your presentation.  Then she smiled at us.”  There was another silent moment.  “Then she did not breathe again.  Then your mother died.”</p>
<p>            Lucius had no idea what to say or to do.  His father had not prepared him for this rush of feeling, as though he wanted to cry like an infant, as though he wanted to bury himself in his father’s arms and weep.  Instead, he froze, staring at the floor, willing himself not to do anything that might cause his father to be displeased with him. </p>
<p>            Abraxas turned back.  Lucius stared down at the floor in shame, too overwhelmed to risk looking at his father.  But Lucius suddenly found his hands full of the green blanket.  When Abraxas spoke, it was not with censure.  His voice was oddly rough, as though he was ill.</p>
<p>            “Would you like to keep it?” Abraxas asked.</p>
<p>            “Yes, Father, I would.  Thank you.” Lucius knew his voice was shaking, but for once, his father didn’t seem to mind.  A hand rested briefly on his small shoulder, lightly squeezing, then was gone.</p>
<p>            “I miss her too,” Abraxas said.</p>
<p>            He walked away, leaving Lucius holding the blanket.</p></div>
