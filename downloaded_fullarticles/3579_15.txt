    <p>"I'm sorry Harry, but I’m leaving.” Draco’s voice was soft and apologetic but determined to carry out whatever he needed to do. Harry’s face was awash with unchecked tears as he watched Draco pick up his duffle and walk out the door. As the door shut with a soft click Harry collapsed to his knees, sobs finally breaking through his tight lips and filling the room with agony.<br/>
Harry never thought his mate would leave him. They’d mated at the end of their 7th year, happy and secure in the fact that, even as part Elf, Harry was comfortable with Draco as his mate. They, for obvious reasons, took a long time getting to the mating stage. Nearly two years, as Harry had approached Draco not long after his 15th birthday.  As an Elf, a submissive one at that, Harry had to mate, or have contact with his mate, to survive. It had taken some getting used to on Draco’s side.  However, as a result Voldemort had been destroyed none the wiser, and earlier than predicted.<br/>
Harry’s cry of pain as his bond broke went unheard. They lived in the middle of nowhere so there were no neighbours to hear and Hermione and Ron never came around when they thought Draco would be there. Never able to move passed his younger years despite everything he had done since being with Harry.<br/>
Harry’s hand moved to his stomach a sighed in relief as he felt the small magical signature. It has all happened so fast he hadn’t even been able to tell Draco what he’d found out just that morning before Draco stating firmly that he was leaving and there was nothing Harry could do about it. He never even gave a reason as to why he was breaking the bond.<br/>
Harry pulled himself off the floor and into the bathroom just in time for morning sickness to bring him to his knees again against the toilet. His hands gripped the rim until they were white and his stomach settled. He huffed, stood and wiped his face of anything left over and his tears. He needed a plan and the only place he knew he could go was somewhere he wasn’t even sure he’d be welcome.<br/>
He spent the next half a day packing his things, his essentials knowing that the end of this he was unlikely to return anyway. He left the house sealing it as he went and moved down the path until he reached the anti-apparition wards end. With an almost inaudible pop Harry was gone from the spot, reappearing in front of a grand white manor house somewhere in Wiltshire. He hesitated for a second before knocking and easing the door open. He was quickly greeted by a well-dressed house elf, “what does guest want at Malfoy manor?”<br/>
A little surprised at the articulation of the little creature Harry managed to stutter a reply, “I need to speak to the lord of the manor, quite urgently if you please.”<br/>
The elf nodded, sensing that the man before him was more than he let on, and popped away. It didn’t take long before a stately blond man came from one of the corridors leading off the entrance hall, “Mr Potter, what can I do for you?”<br/>
“I need to discuss matters of family with you, it’s quite urgent, I’ve already tarried enough as it is.” Lucius nodded and gestured for harry to follow him back down the same corridor. The paintings lining it scrutinised him with a critical eye, thankfully keeping their comments to themselves. He was ushered into a study and given a seat before Lucius took his behind the desk. Lucius indicated for Harry to start, “I don’t know if you were aware but your son is my mate.”<br/>
It was such a simple sentence and yet Lucius’ reaction wasn’t quite so simple. His mask slipped showing harry a myriad of emotions, happiness, shock and annoyance among them. “no, was not aware, Draco never mentioned it.<br/>
Harry sighed, he figured as much. The next dilemma was how to precede, he knew he need to inform Lucius of everything, however, he didn’t know how it would be taken. “he’s my mate, I’m half elf. My mother was a pureblood Royal Elf. I approached Draco 3 years ago, I knew if I didn’t have contact, at least with my mate, I would slowly wither away. Elves are very tactile creatures and as such submissives require constant reassurance that their mate is alive and with them.”<br/>
With acknowledgment from Lucius Harry described their courting, how patient and attentive Draco had been. That was until that morning. Which he described in detail. His voice broke a few times before managing to get it out. “he left before I could tell him, tell I was pregnant.”<br/>
The last came out barely loud enough for Lucius to hear. But when his brain clicked to what Harry was saying an audible growl came from the man. Harry startled thinking he’d made the wrong choice and that Lucius would attack him. His arms covered his middle as he leant over to make himself as small as he could. Without a mate Harry felt defenceless even against, what was to his elven side anyway, family. This man held blood ties to the child he was carrying, his heritage almost demanded the contact. “oh merlin, I apologise Harry, it wasn’t aimed at you, I promise. My son however needs a boot!”<br/>
“No, please! He made his choice! I just… I just need somewhere safe.” Harry went from small to pleading with the blink of an eye, “please, I need my child to have a family, I never got the chance I can’t let that happen again please!”<br/>
Lucius was shocked by the pleading fervour in Harry’s voice and nodded his voice, settling back in his chair. Harry settled back down, the pleading look never leaving his face, “Harry do you know why Draco left?”<br/>
Harry shook his head, if he knew he wouldn’t be here, he’d be fixing whatever was wrong, he told Lucius as such and the man nodded, “then, it might actually be my fault…”<br/>
Harry cocked his head to the side in confusion, how could Lucius be at fault when he’d barely met the man, “I impressed the importance of bloodlines on Draco just the other day. He never mentioned having a mate, nor that you were half submissive royal elf.”<br/>
“I gathered. It’s not your fault, Draco is an idiot.” Lucius chuckled and nodded. Either way he was determined to speak to his son, “besides, it’s too late now. The bond is broken, I’m only here because of my pregnancy as the likelihood of certain things happening are slim to none.”<br/>
“what do you mean?” Lucius was curious, he didn’t know much about elves, they were a close-knit creature, only sharing with their mates.<br/>
“there is a small chance, that I may change into an animal when the baby comes. It happens so rarely that we still don’t know what triggers it, or why. However, the most likely course is I will simply pass away.” Harry was so matter of fact about it that Lucius was a little shocked. This alone would have convinced him that harry needed his help, he clearly wasn’t after anything but a family for his time remaining, and then for his child, his next comment cementing that in his brain, “I just wish my child to be loved and cared for when I’m gone, Draco doesn’t need to know now, in fact I’d prefer that he didn’t know… I couldn’t face him now that I know he wouldn’t face you for me.”<br/>
Lucius gave a small nod, “Draco isn’t going to be here for the summer, he’s away, didn’t give me a reason just said he would return by august, September time and he would be ready to do he duty. His words not mine. I never meant for him to leave you Harry, had I know about you I would have insisted on meeting you.”<br/>
Harry smiled, it was a little strained but Lucius knew that it was probably all he was going to get. He called a house elf and told him to set up a room for Harry in the same hall as him before ordering tea and sandwiches. He wanted to learn more about elves so that he could better help the mother of his grandchild. He stopped and then quickly summoned Narcissa as well, “she will be over joyed to hear of a child in the family.” Was Lucius’ comment as he set a cup in front of Harry.<br/>
After Narcissa got settled with a cup and caught up she too was upset at her son but seemed happy about a grandchild, “I hope Harry, that you view as family as such come to us for anything, even if it is for just the time of your pregnancy. How far along are you anyway.”<br/>
“3 months, I found out early this morning before everything went down. I must say I’m surprised Draco was so quick in leaving. To be fair, I never did tell him what breaking the bond would do. I didn’t think that it would ever be an issue. I would have pushed for you to know but Draco always seemed hesitant and an elf’s first priority is always to their mate.” Harry was quick to explain why he’d only just come to them, he didn’t want to offend them, especially when they were being so accommodating.<br/>
Narcissa fussed over him for the next hour as Harry answered questions about his inheritance, what he’d need from them in the coming months and what he was going to do about a healer, “I don’t know any healers besides Poppy and she knows nothing that can help me. I know Professor Snape does, but he doesn’t like me.”<br/>
“I’ll make sure he helps Harry, give me 5 minutes with him.” Lucius threw him a smirk and it made Harry chuckle lightly. After that it wasn’t long before Harry was shown his room and left to settle in. </p><p> </p><p>Lucius moved to his fire place and threw in the floo powder he had taken a handful of before calling out, “Severus Snape, Potions master, Hogwarts.”<br/>
He waited for the flames to turn green for moving to place his head in them, he quickly spotted Severus sitting in his receiving chair, “ah Severus, old friend. What do you know of elven pregnancies?”<br/>
“much Lucius, why?” Lucius hesitated before diving into an explanation of what had happened, edited down of course. He made sure to stress that if he were to help he was to keep his attitude and opinions to himself, “who is it Lucius?”<br/>
“my son mated with an elf, and then broke the bond.” Severus gave him a half glare at Lucius skirting the question, it made the blond sigh before answering, “Harry Potter.”<br/>
Severus sighed, he had a feeling, he’d known about Lily was an elf when they had been younger. It had been the sole reason for his learning all he could about elves. “if Draco has broken the bond Potter is very lucky to be pregnant.”<br/>
“and you’re going to have to get to know him Severus. I think it’s time.” Severus looked shocked, he knew what his long-time friend was alluding to, but he hadn’t known Lucius had known. He hung his head, he didn’t know if he could ever repair what he had broken. “you’d be surprised Sev, if he can forgive me for everything I have done then maybe he will you too. Would you like me to ease it to him before you visit?”<br/>
Severus nodded, “I’ll be over for dinner this evening.”<br/>
With that Lucius cut the connection and went to find his guest. He found him relaxing on the large bed in his assigned room, “hello Harry, I have some news. Some of it might be a bit of a shock.”<br/>
Harry sat up, pulling a pillow in to his lap so he was comfortable, “I managed to get Severus to agree, it wasn’t hard, I know something about him that made it particularly easy. However, this information actually pertains to you also and I wanted to ease you into it knowing full well how Severus is with words.”<br/>
This peaked Harry’s curiosity, he leaned forward waiting for Lucius to continue, “I need you to just take in the information do you think you can do that, I don’t want to stress you and I need you to hear this with a level head and open heart.”<br/>
“Of course, I’ll try my best, can’t really say much for my emotional state right now, but I will try.” Lucius knew that was the best he could hope for.<br/>
“Dumbledore lied to you about your parentage…” Harry held up a hand as if to stop him and moved to say something before Lucius could continue.<br/>
“I know, Severus is My father. My mother wrote me a letter, it detailed everything I would need to know, from everything to do with my Heritage all the way to why I hadn’t grown up with my father. I know that he had to conceal his link to me in the effort of getting close to old snake face.” Lucius wasn’t actually all that surprised that Lily had informed her son, “will he help?”<br/>
“yes harry, he’d love to help. He will be here in time for dinner this evening. Is there anything you wish for dinner?” Harry thought before answering with simple sausage and mash before Lucius left him to get a nap before the excitement to come.</p>
