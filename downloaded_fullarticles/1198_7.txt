    <p>The wedding had been lovely, complete with the flower garlands and other sorts of things. Many of her friends attended, congratulating her. She had the best husband in the world. He was everything she had dreamed of, kind and compassionate. The fact that he was good looking and had a stable job as an Auror helped as well.</p>
<p>Looking back, she should have known better. She should have known that sometimes, things were too good to be true.</p>
<p>But in that moment, she didn't. She gave birth a year later, to a healthy baby boy. And he grew, grew with her. When he was a year old, his hair began to emerge. It was blonde, almost golden. Like a freshly plucked wheat.</p>
<p>She should have known better. She should have known it wouldn't last.</p>
<p>After all, if you stare into the abyss too long, the abyss would stare back at you.</p>
<p>Her husband became engrossed in his work. He never had time to spare for them. He didn't have time for his family. It was his work which was more important. He chose his work over his family.</p>
<p>Yes, it was him who drove their family to ruin. Even though not all the blame fell onto him, most of it did.</p>
<p>But back then, she was young and carefree.</p>
<p>The world deserved to know the truth.</p>
<p>About the young boy who got lost in the darkness. About a man who pushed his family away.</p>
<p>Yes, the world would know everything.</p>
<p>She resumed writing her memoirs. One day, someone would find them and the truth will be uncovered at last.</p>
