    <p>            I tapped my foot, a little impatient. Charlotte had said that she’d meet me in the library at noon- it was now twenty past. A familiar figure suddenly appeared in the entrance of the library.</p>
<p>“Charlotte!” I stood with a warm smile (impatience forgotten), my arms stretched out to hug my girlfriend.</p>
<p>            “James!” she replied, returning my hug.</p>
<p>            I pressed my nose into her head, breathing in her cool, fresh scent that I had missed over the summer. She’s been vacationing in Europe for most of the summer, and had accordingly obtained a slight tan. She smelled like fresh laundry and mint, probably due to her habit of constantly chewing mint gum. “I missed you,” I murmured into her hair.</p>
<p>            Charlotte pulled away before I could kiss her, a tight smile and a crease between her brows.</p>
<p>            Oh no. I knew that look. “What’s wrong, Char?”</p>
<p>            “Erm…sit down James, will you?” Char suggested. Shrugging, I sat back down into my chair. I pulled out the one next to me, expecting her to take it. Instead, she took the one opposite mine.</p>
<p>            Odd.</p>
<p>            “So, um…” Char started. She seemed unable to continue. “Jeez, this is hard.”</p>
<p>            “Char? What is it? You’re scaring me a little,” I said, my own brows starting to furrow.</p>
<p>            “Well, I might as well just come out with it,” Char said, sighing. “James, I’ve…I’ve fallen out of love.”</p>
<p>            I froze. “You…you what?” This couldn’t be happening.</p>
<p>            “I’ve fallen out of love- with you,” Char repeated. Her eyes appeared to be welling up. “I don’t- I don’t think we should keep seeing each other.”</p>
<p>            I inhaled sharply. “What?”</p>
<p>            “James, you’re such a lovely person. I- dating you was amazing. Incredible, even,” Char said, blinking rapidly and chuckling a little. “But- but it isn’t fair to you. It isn’t fair to keep dating you when I know I don’t love you as much- as much as you love me.”</p>
<p>            “But…Char. <em>Two years</em>, Charlotte,” I pleaded, tears beginning to prick at the back of my own eyes. “I- I still love you, Char. What about all our plans? We were going to go to university in Holland together. Live together with a cat named Xavier. We were- we were gonna- I still love you, Charlotte!”</p>
<p>            But Charlotte was just shaking her head as tears dripped down her cheeks, staining her shirt with dark drops. “James, I can’t. I just- I can’t.” She looked up at me. “I’m…I’m so sorry, James,” she whispered.</p>
<p>            And with that, she stood up, furiously wiping at her eyes, walked over to me, dropped a kiss on top of my head, and walked out of the library. I was left staring at her swinging blonde hair as it disappeared from view.</p>
<p>            I stared into the empty space for a few moments, feeling numb.</p>
<p>            <em>Charlotte</em>.</p>
<p>            And suddenly, the full force of what had just happened hit me. My throat started to close up, and the tears in my eyes were threatening to fall in a matter of seconds. My mind felt clogged and horrible, swirling with nasty thoughts about Char that I knew I didn’t mean and a black hole of pure sadness that felt like it was pulling me in with no escape.</p>
<p>            <em>Not here. Not in front of all these people.</em></p>
<p>            As quickly as I could in my misty state of mind, I gathered up all my belongings, and high-tailed it out the other entrance of the library, not wanting to risk a run-in with Char. Besides, I had no intention of going to Gryffindor Tower, or for that matter, Ravenclaw, which was where Char was probably headed.</p>
<p>            No. I needed Molly.</p>
<p>            I stood in front of the barrels that were the entrance way to the Hufflepuff common room. Quickly, I whipped out my wand, and tapped out the passcode onto the correct barrel. At least, I thought it was the correct barrel, until I was suddenly doused with a bucketful of vinegar.</p>
<p>            Great. Just what I needed after being dumped.</p>
<p>            I did the tapping again, this time on the actually correct barrel, and the wall before me dissolved so I was looking into the warm, yellow common room. I strode through the throng of excited, yellow clad students, nearly knocking over a puny little first year that glared at me. I made it to the girl’s dormitories, and immediately opened the door to the seventh years’ dorm.</p>
<p>            Molly was the only one inside, sitting on her bed, carefully folding her clothes. I knocked on the already open door, and she turned to look at me.</p>
<p>            “James! What a surprise! What can I do- why are you sopping wet?”</p>
<p>            “Lemongrass.”</p>
<p>            Molly’s face immediately sobered, and she opened her arms out. And like a two-year-old, dropping everything on the floor, I crawled into her arms and burst into tears.</p>
<p>            I was back in the library.</p>
<p>            After having a proper sob session with Molly (whose roommates were kind enough to clear out for an hour while I cried about Charlotte), and a hot mug of lemongrass tea, she sent me off with an armful of chocolate and a box of tissues.</p>
<p>            I didn’t think that a breakup could affect me this badly. After all, only <em>girls</em> cry when they’re dumped. Right?</p>
<p>            However, it was Charlotte. Lovely, smart, kind Charlotte.</p>
<p>            Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it.</p>
<p>            I took out my sketchbook, and began a new drawing, not sure where it would lead me. I jut wanted my mind off Charlotte.</p>
<p>            I’d really thought we’d be together forever. We’d gone two years with almost no spats- it was a perfect, healthy relationship. We weren’t clingy, or hostile. We never cheated, and we never got too jealous. Charlotte could talk to other boys and I could talk to other girls. It was fine. I took her on romantic picnics out on the Quidditch pitch. She made me soup when I was sick. I took her on wild broomstick rides, and she talked to me endlessly about books that she read. We could sit in silence for hours and still feel content and happy.</p>
<p>            I hated not feeling her presence by my side. I hated not being able to swing my arm around her shoulders, not having her minty smell constantly wafting into my nose. Merlin, I missed her. It’d only been a couple hours and I was already having withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>            I directed my attention back to my sketchbook, only to see Charlotte’s face staring back at me.</p>
<p>            Dammit. So much for getting Charlotte off my mind.</p>
<p>            I allowed my head to thunk down onto the table, pressing my eyes closed and trying as hard as I could to push thoughts of her to the back of my mind. It didn’t really work. The hard oak table wasn’t the most comfy of surfaces either.</p>
<p>            “You okay?”</p>
<p>            I lifted my head up to examine the source of the unfamiliar voice. In front of me stood a short girl with black hair, wearing a large sweatshirt and jeans. I was fairly sure that I had never before seen her in my entire life.</p>
<p>            “None of your business,” I muttered, putting my head back down. Nosy little Hufflepuffs.</p>
<p>            She huffed. “No need to get testy,” she said. “You looked sad, is all.”</p>
<p>            “Thanks a lot.”</p>
<p>            The girl didn’t say anything. I assumed she had left, but the next moment I heard some rustling and zipping, and suddenly a delicious smell was tucked underneath my nose.</p>
<p>            I opened my eyes to see a large brownie with sprinkles, sitting perfectly on a green square napkin.</p>
<p>            I examined it for a moment, then looked at the girl suspiciously as she tucked a plastic box into her bag. “What’s this?”</p>
<p>            She looked at me like I was an idiot. “It’s a brownie.”</p>
<p>            “No shit,” I replied. “Why are you giving this to me?”</p>
<p>            The girl shrugged. “You look like you could use it.”</p>
<p>            I eyed the brownie, then asked, “Does this have pot in it or something?”</p>
<p>            The girl’s eyes widened. “Dumbledore’s beard, no! It’s just a regular brownie!”</p>
<p>            “…really?”</p>
<p>            “Of course! Now really, I must be going,” the girl said. “Enjoy your brownie.”</p>
<p>            And with that, she walked off, bag swinging obnoxiously by her side.</p>
<p>            I stared at the brownie. It didn’t <em>look</em> suspicious. Then I smelled it. Just chocolatey goodness, as far as I could tell.</p>
<p>            <em>It couldn’t hurt to take just one bite, could it?</em></p>
<p>            Cautiously, I lifted the brownie off the napkin, and took a small bite.</p>
<p>            Damn. Now<em> that</em> was a brownie. I looked up to see whether the girl was still there, but she had disappeared.</p>
<p>            Well. That was an experience.</p>
