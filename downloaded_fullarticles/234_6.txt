</center><p>The day Harry met Tom Riddle was a Monday, the first day of summer vacation, and from the start to the finish he was sure it was the best day of his life.</p><p>He had heard back on his application just that Friday. It came in an excited call from Ron, since they’d agreed Harry should use his mailing address.</p><p>Ron exclaimed so loudly Harry winced and held the phone away from his ear, but he was still laughing. He could barely understand what Ron was saying, but the gist of it was impossible to miss.</p><p>That evening Harry had to carefully navigate the subject with his aunt and uncle, which had involved four major lies, one of which he wasn’t yet sure he would be able to cover up, but he’d find a way. That particular lie had been the most necessary of all, so it wasn’t as though he’d had a choice.</p><p>Harry began when their program hit a commercial break and he’d done all the dishes and taken extra care plating their desserts. He set a slice of cheesecake with a fresh mint leaf for garnish on Uncle Vernon’s TV tray, and then presented a scoop of low-fat ice cream in a little cut glass cup to his aunt.</p><p>The first lie: “A client at the barn told me about a job opening at Windmere.”</p><p>Uncle Vernon looked at Harry suspiciously over his spoon. “That’s the place with the gates? And all the stone fencing?”</p><p>Harry nodded. “Yes, that place.”</p><p>“Pay better there? I like having you out of the house, mind, but the hassle of driving you to these places is hardly worth what they pay us to spare you.”</p><p>Harry shifted nervously from one foot to the other, and told the second lie. “It’s a live-in arrangement, so you wouldn’t have to drive me.”</p><p>Uncle Vernon looked more interested. Aunt Petunia frowned, but he knew how she was, which was why he’d thought of the third lie.</p><p>“It’s just mucking out stalls.” He looked down and bit his lip. “But I’d at least get to see the best horses training, if I can get my work done early.”</p><p>Petunia’s mouth twitched thoughtfully, but she seemed intrigued. Her main complaint about Harry’s present job was that he got to ride a bit after he finished picking stalls. It wasn’t <em>real</em> riding, just cooling down horses that had already had their exercise, but it annoyed her to think he’d be paid for something he enjoyed.</p><p>Now Vernon was frowning. “But the pay? Is it better? If they’re boarding you, they probably think they don’t need to offer a wage. But we’ll have the strain of taking care of all your responsibilities here.”</p><p>Harry’s heart was beating fast. He’d hoped he wouldn’t have to lie about <em>this</em>, because he wasn’t sure where he’d find the money. The position didn’t pay, but he could tell Vernon was leaning toward telling him no, and he couldn’t bear it.</p><p>“The pay is even better,” he said before he could stop himself. “Almost twice as much.”</p><p>Which brought him to this morning. His backpack was stuffed with two changes of clothes and his toothbrush, and he wore the best riding clothes he had, which weren’t great but shouldn’t attract stares, even at Windmere.</p><p>Harry stepped out of Uncle Vernon’s car just outside the big gates of the stable’s main entrance. Over the sign—silver metal letters on a slab of rectangular stone reading “Windmere Equestrian Center”—was a sculpture of a horse, close to life life-sized and poised in mid-leap.</p><p>Uncle Vernon was frowning, looking doubtfully from Harry to the jumping horse, as though it pained him for Harry to be associated in any way with something so grand. Harry’s heart pounded at the thought that Uncle Vernon would change his mind and order Harry back in the car.</p><p>But all he said was, “You’re sure I don’t need to sign a form, or anything?”</p><p>“No,” Harry said. “You, um, signed them already. I have them with me.” He bent over to speak to Uncle Vernon, and his arm itched with the barely-restrained urge to slam the door and run up the winding blacktop driveway.</p><p>“Hmm. Well. And your check is monthly?”</p><p>Harry nodded, throat suddenly dry. “Yes.”</p><p>“Your Aunt gave you what you need to mail them along, I presume. And if there’s an emergency, you may call. But we better not hear you’ve been any trouble.”</p><p>“You won’t,” Harry promised. “Bye, Uncle Vernon.”</p><p>“Hmm,” replied Uncle Vernon. Immensely relieved, Harry closed the door and stepped back just as Vernon took off. He watched the car disappear, before he turned to the driveway, heart swelling with excitement, and started walking.</p><p>Windmere was an elite eventing and dressage facility. It was owned by a conglomerate of three supporters of the United States’ international teams, but the only one Harry could ever remember was Lucius Malfoy, because his son, who rode, was Harry’s age. Draco competed as an American, though they were, controversially, French citizens too.</p><p>The head trainer at Windmere was Minerva McGonagall, a world-renowned trainer and instructor in evening, and a present coach of the U.S. Olympic team for dressage.</p><p>Every summer, Minerva took on a working student at Windmere. She required references, a video audition of the student on the flat and over fences, and she was so discerning that once or twice she didn’t take a student at all, claiming that none of the dozens of applicants showed sufficient skill. But of those she did take under her wing, the majority jump-started their professional riding careers with her help.</p><p>Harry had worked extra shifts at his old barn for months, telling Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon he was studying for a school project, and saved up enough for a few sessions with his beloved school master at the barn. She was an arthritic, former Grand Prix eventer with a grizzled muzzle, but she was still game to piaffe and take even a conservative jump with scope. Harry smuggled Ron in to take the audition video with his cell phone.</p><p>Harry knew he was a good rider. It was in his blood, his father’s friend Remus had told him. Harry’s father hadn’t ridden professionally, but he was a decorated young rider. Remus had been the one to help Harry scrape together the money to get in the saddle in front of Alastor Moody. Moody had been out of the business a long time but happened to have been a personal acquaintance of Minerva, and they hoped he would therefore have some sway with her.</p><p>It had all worked out, somehow, and here Harry was. He looked down nervously at his breeches (they were used, but the worst wear was in the calves, which he’d cover with half chaps soon anyway) and the shiny toes of his leather paddock boots (they were new, but cheap).</p><p><em>None of that matters, Harry,</em> Remus would say. And Harry knew that, but he also knew what kind of kids rode at places like Windmere. Still, now he was a working student, not stall help. He’d earn their respect, he was sure, even if he didn’t make any friends.</p><p>The driveway sloped steeply, and Harry leaned in to it, the strain on the backs of his thighs pleasant. He was almost at the top of the hill when he heard the sound of an engine, coming fast up the drive from the road.</p><p>Harry stepped off the asphalt and turned to see a glossy black convertible—it was some kind of classic, but Harry didn’t know cars well enough to say more than that. It had the distinct look of something deliriously expensive, though, and Harry assumed it cost more than the Dursleys’ two vehicles and house, combined.</p><p>A guy—seventeen or so, about Harry’s age—drove it. The wind ruffled his wavy black hair, and he wore a sky blue polo shirt in the Windmere colors. He hit the brakes at the sight of Harry, with a startlingly beautiful smile that made Harry blink reflexively, as though it was a camera flash.</p><p>Then he reached up with a pale, sculpted arm to take off his sunglasses just as Harry realized who he must be. Sure enough, dark brown eyes and model-worthy bone structure confirmed Harry’s budding suspicion. This was Tom Riddle, Minerva McGonagall’s rising star; the youngest rider to be scouted for the US Olympic team in the whole history of the sport. Of course, it didn’t hurt that his father was a billionaire and had bought him a series of superstar mounts.</p><p>“Hello,” said Tom, easy to hear over the nearly-silent murmur of the engine. “Where did you come from?” He leaned over the supple ivory leather of the passenger seat. “Did you have a fall?” He raked Harry with his eyes for signs of grass stains or injury.</p><p>“Um, n-no,” Harry was stammering, which wasn’t like him, even if he was understandably star struck. “I just got here.”</p><p>Tom laughed. It lit up his eyes, and widened his smile. Harry watched, mesmerized.</p><p>“Did you drop out of the sky?” He pulled the release on the door and shoved it open. “Come on, I’ll give you a ride.”</p><p>“Okay,” Harry said, sounding and feeling a bit faint. There was a centerfold in <em>Modern Riding</em> that featured Tom Riddle frozen midway in the process of swinging into the saddle, his shoulders taut, his left thigh bulging as he pressed all his weight into the stirrup, the right leg in the air as elegant as a dancer’s, his ass—</p><p>Well, it was almost pornographic, that photo. Harry couldn’t be the only boy who’d wanked to it, albeit guiltily, for weeks.</p><p>And now Tom was inviting him into his priceless car with a friendly smile and a warm, intense stare. Harry’s stomach hurt and his palms were sweaty. But he forced himself to smile and slide inside.</p><p>Being in the car with Tom was almost too much. First there was the way the leather felt: pillow soft—was that what leather was supposed to feel like? And it smelled different than he expected, too; almost like a tack room but cleaner, clearer, without the underlying polish and the ever-pervasive, but pleasant, scent of horse.</p><p>More overwhelming was Tom, who smelled great also, a combination of delicate notes. The cocktail had to have something to do with how his hair was lying perfectly despite having just driven a convertible at presumably high speed, the starch in his collar, and the gloss of his cognac tall boots.</p><p>”What’s your name?” Tom slid his sunglasses back on and the car glided forward, smoothly as a hovercraft, giving Harry the strange impulse to lean over the door and make sure the tires were still on the ground. Instead he looked straight ahead, seeing in his peripheral vision the way Tom steered with one wrist on the top of the wheel.</p><p>Harry bit his lip. He’d been mistaken for a lesson student before, and seen how someone’s whole demeanor changed when they realized he was only the help. “I’m Harry Potter. I’m—”</p><p>“Minerva’s working student,” Tom finished for him, tone still friendly. Harry’s shoulders had crept into a hunch, but lowered now as he relaxed. He smiled over at Tom, who grinned back.</p><p>“I’ve seen your video,” he said. “You’ve got a great seat.”</p><p>Harry was suddenly blushing furiously, imagining Tom Riddle watching the wobbly cell phone video, and hearing Ron’s occasional muttering. They hadn’t managed to edit out the sound.</p><p>“Thanks,” he murmured, turning as though to admire the scene outside the car and effectively hiding his red face. Beyond the stone and wood fence the pastures rolled, as well-groomed as a golf course, dotted with the distant, bright shapes of grazing horses.</p><p>Tom chuckled, and the car went faster, which startled a laugh from Harry too. It was wild, how the car soared like an aircraft but tightly hugged the sharp final curve of the drive, throwing Harry almost past the gear shift so his shoulder bumped Tom’s. The unexpected contact, the warmth of Tom’s arm, the nearness of his laugh made Harry’s laughter bloom, too, and they were both half-breathless and smiling when Tom slowed and swept the car neatly into a parking space by the stables. They’d come upon the buildings so suddenly Harry noticed them all at once. Long, looming, white steel, accented with stone wainscot and pillars, green trim and raw wood beams.</p><p>“Good luck with our girl Minerva, Harry,” Tom said, stepping out of the car and stretching his arms one at a time like a pitcher at the mound. His sunglasses reflected the sky and a slice of green as clearly as a mirror. He only stood there a few seconds before turning and walking off, leaving Harry still sitting in his car and noting, despite himself, that his ass looked even better in person.</p><p>Harry hadn’t thought to ask exactly where he should go when he got here. He got out of the car and looked around again. The first person he saw was a girl in a blue polo that was the same color as Tom’s had been, but clearly a fraction of the quality, pushing a wheelbarrow with a pitchfork propped inside.</p><p>“Hey, sorry,” Harry called, jogging toward her. The distinct round shape of the helmet in his backpack thumped the small of his back with each step. She looked up with a puzzled smile. She had long blond braids and odd, almost lavender eyes that seemed too big for her face.</p><p>“Can I help you with something?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry said, smiling gratefully. “I’m looking for Ms. McGonagall?”</p><p>The girl pointed toward the largest barn. “I just saw her first ride go by, so she should still be in the grooming bay. She always double checks the tack.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Harry said. “And I’m Harry, by the way.”</p><p>The girl smiled. “I’m Luna. And you’re welcome, Harry.”</p><p><em>Our girl </em>Tom had said. It seemed like a strange way to refer to Minerva, Harry reflected belatedly. He slowed his walk as he stepped out of the cool morning sunlight and into the bright artificial light inside the barn.  </p><p>The building was enormous, the ceiling vaulting a few stories high over wrought-iron stall fronts. A few curious horses hung their heads over their half doors, watching Harry curiously. He looked from one to the next, stunned. He recognized the dark bay countenance of Natilla, who Juliette Miller had ridden to the bronze in stadium two years ago, and the up and comer Fendi, a classic chestnut with a wide blaze.</p><p>As promised, Minerva McGonagall was there too. She was turned in profile to Harry, checking the cinch of a monstrous grey mare who was contentedly fiddling with the loosened flash on her bridle with her upper lip, nubile as a giraffe’s.</p><p>Minerva turned, catching Harry gawking at the horses. It felt like being in the green room of a movie set. Minerva was, of course, as famous as any of the horses, but he felt a little steadier when he met her stern eye and stuck his hands in his pockets.</p><p>“Ms. McGonagall—I’m Harry Potter.”</p><p>She continued to frown, but he had the sense that she didn’t mean anything critical by it. “Resting bitch face,” Ginny would say, then dodge Hermione’s reprimanding swat.</p><p>“So you are,” said Minerva. Harry knew she had a Scottish accent, but having only seen written interviews, the rhythm of it still took him by surprise. “Well, here’s Hedwig. Take her out to the turf course and we’ll see if you have any luck waking her up.”</p><p>Harry had known he’d be riding. Riding good horses, even. But the mare—Hedwig—was broad, with the muscle over her top line of an advanced horse. That he’d have the privilege of riding something like her straight off was almost as intense and pleasantly surprising as Tom Riddle, smiling at Harry and leaning over to invite him into his car.</p><p>Harry shook himself and hastily sat on a bench along the wall to get out his helmet and half chaps and get them on, his fingers trembling as he zipped his chaps and tugged them by the gusset until they were as high as possible, snug behind his knees.</p><p>Minerva glanced at his backpack as he stood up. “You can leave your things in a locker in the clubhouse in future, but for today the tack room will do.”</p><p>Harry nodded, ducked into the tack room, identifiable by the placard in its center that read “Tack.” He promised himself a more thorough look around another time, but had a strong impression of cedar paneled walls, rows of gleaming hurdles, and saddles tucked into blue velvet covers.</p><p>In the barn aisle, Minerva held out Hedwig’s reins, and tucked her own helmet under her arm.</p><p>Fourteen hours later, Harry was sore everywhere. Hedwig had lagged at the water hazard so he’d started the morning half-soaked in muddy water, then spilled the oil when he was cleaning the saddle afterward. Then it had taken two sweaty hours jogging uphill to collect a rambunctious three-year-old colt from a ten-acre pasture. Then he’d been thrown three times from said colt when he’d breezed him to take the edge off before Minerva took him to the indoor ring to school him.</p><p>Without exception, during every moment, it was the best day of his life.</p><p>“You’re still smiling, Harry,” Minerva observed. She’d changed into a pink blouse and let her hair down, which made her whole face look almost unrecognizably soft. “That’s generally a good sign.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry sighed, smiling up at her as they walked out of the barn.</p><p>Minerva nodded shortly, but she was smiling too, just a slight curve on the left side of her mouth but it had a definite upward trajectory. “You did well,” she said, and Harry felt like he could skip despite his exhaustion.</p><p>She started for the parking area. Harry was headed to the clubhouse to shower, but paused. “Thanks,” he called softly. “Thanks so much.”</p><p>She shrugged, not turning, but lifted her hand and wiggled her fingers in a sort of reverse-wave.</p><p>Harry showered, then began reflecting on the complications arising from the second lie. He’d formed a very half-assed plan with Ron over the weekend, but it all turned on whether Arthur left their family car at home, and they knew that wouldn’t happen every day. The Weasleys lived a relatively short distance from Windmere, but the bus route was meandering and took two hours.</p><p>It was after ten when he dried off, got into his change of clothes and sat on the carved bench beside the lounge to text Ron.</p><p>
  <em>Can you borrow your dad’s car, or not?</em>
</p><p>“Hello again,” said Tom Riddle. Harry had been resting his elbows on his thighs, head bent over his phone while he waited for Ron’s reply.</p><p>Now he jerked his head up and saw Tom, looking even better than he had that morning, in taupe khaki breeches and his tall-boots. His hair still looked suspiciously perfect, considering he must have worn a helmet at some point during the day.</p><p>“I was just going to meet a few friends. Want to come along?”</p><p>Harry wasn’t sure how he was going to get back off the bench. His whole body hurt. His feet were throbbing; his legs were jelly. He looked like shit, certainly not appropriate for anywhere Tom Riddle would be going. It had to be a pity invite, which Harry had learned to watch out for.</p><p>It was probably spending all day crawling on horses equivalent in value to the cost of a private college education, but Harry felt uncharacteristically sure of himself. He sat up a little straighter in the dizzying spotlight of Tom’s undivided attention, and didn’t say no.</p><p>“Yeah, but I don’t have anything better to wear.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes moved over him, warm and interested. “You’ll do,” he said. “But if you’d be more comfortable, we can see if Draco has anything you’d like to borrow.”</p><p>“Draco <em>Malfoy</em>?” Harry knew he was gaping, but he couldn’t help it. Draco Malfoy was another young, very likely Olympian, though only because his father was exerting pressure on the French committee, and owned Interstellar, the World Equestrian Games’ runner-up three years ago.</p><p>“Yeah. He can hardly complain, when he’s the one who told me to come straight from the barn. Has anyone shown you the locker room?”</p><p>Tom walked off, and before Harry knew it, he had he stood and followed. “Locker room” was a very casual way of referring to the rows of solid wood wardrobes in a marble-tiled dressing room. Harry gaped a little while Tom went to one of the closets and inserted a key, opening the doors and gesturing in a “have at it” sort of way at the contents.</p><p>“He’s leaving tomorrow for Milan or somewhere even more dull, and it’s a send-off,” Tom explained, backing out the door. “So, if you’ll come, take whatever you like. Draco won’t mind.” He winked, which in Harry’s dazed state, somehow wasn’t even a shock.</p><p>He chose a pair of black jeans he would never wear in real life, and a charcoal button-down in a satiny fabric that clung pleasantly to his skin. Everything fit fairly well, and since there weren’t any shoes, Harry licked his thumb and rubbed the smudges off his paddock boots and just tucked the cuffs of the jeans down over them.</p><p>He didn’t know where Tom had gone to change, but apparently he had. He was wearing slim-fitted dark grey pants that made his legs look like they were a mile long and a stretchy white v-neck under a denim jacket with the sleeves rolled to the elbows. He’d been scrolling through his phone, but stood up at the sight of Harry and looked him over with a slow smile.</p><p>The car was where Tom had left it. Harry had noticed it throughout the day. It was no less dizzying getting into the seat beside Tom a second time.</p><p>Tom lifted the top on the car and drove them out to the highway. Harry didn’t know the area, but noted the symbolism of turning the opposite way on the two lane highway where Windmere sat from the direction of the Dursleys’.</p><p>Then he noticed it was already 11 pm.</p><p>“I—I have work first thing,” Harry said anxiously. “God, maybe I shouldn’t be coming?” He put his hands in his hair, suddenly dismayed with himself.</p><p>Tom laid his hand on Harry’s knee as though it was perfectly natural. “I’ll be sure you’re not late for Minerva,” he promised. He was smiling, just a bit, gazing through the windshield. The indirect light from the headlights painted his face into silver shadows, and highlighted the dimple in his cheek.</p><p>Harry stared at Tom’s hand. His thumb was circling the outside of Harry’s knee.</p><p>“Great,” Harry said, but it came out so quietly it was more of a sigh. He wasn’t sure Tom heard.</p><p>They didn’t go far. The southern tail of the city curved south five miles up, with an entrance ramp to the primary connector. There Tom opened up the car with a purer version of the recklessness he’d showed off that morning. It was the same way he rode, Harry thought dizzily, imagining the video clips of Tom that had gone viral in the Equestrian social media circles. Tom had bold horses to start with, but he rode them with such confidence they seemed absolutely fearless—winged.</p><p>Downtown, the glittering lights and the teeming people in short skirts and deliberately unbuttoned shirts, artful hair and heels were mesmerizing. Particularly when Harry noticed them noticing the car, and maybe even Tom and Harry. Tom lowered the roof, and Harry could <em>hear</em> the city too, in a way he never had.</p><p>“Here’s the place,” Tom said, slowing as they approached a laughably upscale restaurant and bar with a dedicated lane for valet. Tom eased the car up along the curb and got out, circling around to open Harry’s door, too. Harry felt a lingering heat in the knee Tom had been touching, tingling and pulsing like a fresh brand.</p><p>They went in, and Harry was immediately conscious of his shoes, until Tom picked up his hand and guided him to the host’s table. Then Harry could think of nothing but how long and smooth Tom’s fingers were, wrapped around his. Tom had several inches on him, which was as appealing as it was infuriating, and didn’t adjust his stride. To keep from being effectively towed along, Harry had to rush alongside him, and he felt in every way unsteady as Tom asked for the Malfoy party, then followed the uniformed host through dozens of full tables, all lit by the golden glow of a dozen chandeliers affixed forty or fifty feet overhead.</p><p>Most people were in black tie, but there were a handful here and there as casually attired as Tom.</p><p>Harry saw Draco Malfoy before Draco saw them. He was hard to miss, being noisily French and distinctly silver-haired.</p><p>“Riddle!” He called, face alight at the first sight of Tom, then taking him in further detail, dismayed. “What,” he demanded tonelessly as Tom pulled out two chairs, “are you wearing?”</p><p>“I didn’t have sufficient notice to have my tuxedo aired,” Tom said flippantly, and Harry wondered if he was being serious. Harry had no idea how one cared for dress clothes.</p><p>Unfortunately, Draco’s shocked stare had found its way to Harry, and he physically recoiled at the sight.</p><p>“Before you say something rude,” Tom murmured, a clear warning in his voice, “let me introduce my dear new friend Harry Potter, who I invited to borrow something from your locker.”</p><p>Something indescribable was happening on Draco’s face. He was obviously being struck by several conflicting emotions all at once, and eventually covered his face with his hands and leaned over the table, mumbling in French.</p><p>“What…?” Harry began, but Tom stopped him by releasing his hand and guiding him into a chair.</p><p>“Harry, this is Pansy, and Theo, and Millicent,” Tom said, and the other people around the table nodded, looking at Harry with cautious interest. “Has everyone eaten already?” Tom reached for a menu, which had a leather cover that smelled like the seats in Tom’s car.</p><p>Draco’s face reappeared. His cheeks were pink, but he was determinedly pleasant. “No, Riddle, we wouldn’t dream of starting without you.”</p><p>Harry darted a glance at the menu for long enough to see a starter salad was $35, and swallowed hard.</p><p>“I’ve eaten,” he told Millicent, because she was the only one who happened to be looking at Harry and not a menu.</p><p>“You’ll offend Malfoy if you don’t eat, when he’s said he’ll treat us all,” Tom murmured. Harry glanced sharply at him, wondering if the reassurance was accidental, and still chose the cheapest thing on the menu for each course.</p><p>After they’d placed their orders, Draco leaned toward Harry. Somehow, Harry was sitting almost directly across the table from him. “Tell me, Harry,” Draco said, smiling with a sharp edge. “How was your first day at Windmere?”</p><p>Harry frowned. “It was good, but how did you know—?”</p><p>“Ah,” Draco said, quick and careless, “Tom texted me this morning to let me know how promising Minerva’s student was.”</p><p>“Oh?” Harry felt himself blush, and saw Draco notice it: a flicker of his eyes, a brief lowering of long eyelashes several shades darker than his hair.</p><p>“You could say we share everything,” Draco added, and Harry felt the steady, firm pressure of a foot over his beneath the table.</p><p>“Not everything,” said Tom silkily. Harry hadn’t even realized he was listening, but Draco’s foot disappeared from Harry’s and didn’t return.</p><p>The food was exotic. Harry normally considered his tastes uncomplicated and basic, but now he realized he just didn’t know how good it could be. He kept encountering new, foreign things in each course, the pairing of sweetness with spice in a salad, shaved watermelon garnishing his soup, fragrant lavender sauce on his chicken. He tried to mimic Tom’s table manners at first then gave up, letting himself enjoy a meal he’d probably remember the rest of his life without letting self-consciousness ruin it.</p><p>There was wine, too, though Harry had deduced that the oldest person at the table was Draco, seventeen and a half.</p><p>Like the food, the wine was unspeakably delicious. Another thing Harry had assumed he didn’t like, but now he attributed the opinion to having insofar tried things that were more similar to vinegar than to whatever kept refilling his glass.</p><p>By the time they’d shared two bottles—though Harry noticed Tom just had water—the entire table had relaxed. Harry had warmed to Draco, who he’d twice sent into minor hysterics arguing the conformational superiority of Holsteiners compared to any other breed. Millicent had calmly asked if Harry was homeless, then only blinked, nonplussed, when Harry buried his face in his arms and laughed for ten seconds straight.</p><p>The wine; the food; the bizarre conversation; the way Tom’s thigh kept pressing against Harry’s. He felt like Cinderella, straight up until he excused himself to go to the restroom and realized it was two in the morning, and Minerva expected him to be saddling horses in three hours.</p><p>He had a taxi service saved in his phone. His phone didn’t have data, so he couldn’t use Uber. He’d probably spend way too much of what was left of his life’s savings, a very meager roll of cash shoved deep in his jeans pocket, getting a ride back to the barn. But he couldn’t think of an alternative. Somehow, asking Tom to leave earlier than he would have otherwise felt impossible.</p><p>Back in the dining room, Harry wound between now-empty tables. Draco’s group must be one of the last to leave at this point. Tom had his arm resting over the back of Harry’s chair, his head thrown back to laugh at something Draco was saying. Harry had never wanted to sit down beside someone so badly, but instead he hovered by the chair until Tom looked up.</p><p>“I’ve gotta get back to the barn,” he murmured. “Can I get my stuff from your car?”</p><p>“Oh, I’ll drive you,” Tom said carelessly. “They'll make Malfoy go soon, anyway.”</p><p>The restaurant, Harry realized, wasn’t just thinning out, it was <em>empty</em> save for them. The only other people in sight were a few staff leaning behind the bar and speaking quietly to one another, carefully not looking in their direction.</p><p>“This is one of Draco’s mother’s places,” Tom explained. “They’re used to helping her spoil her only kid.” He pushed his chair back.</p><p>“Spoiled?” Draco demanded, glaring, then frowned at Harry. “You’re going?”</p><p>“I am, but Tom doesn’t have to,” Harry protested. In a lower voice he asked Tom, “Are you sure? I don’t want to, um, trouble you.”</p><p>Tom waved him off, saying his farewells and standing up. He seemed just fine. Harry followed him toward the doors, and an exhausted-looking valet smiled at them with such open relief, Harry felt a pang of self-loathing. Were all these people really waiting to go home until a few tipsy teenagers decided to call it a night?</p><p>Tom opened Harry’s door for him again, and Harry got inside without looking up at him. Tom got in too.</p><p>“Back to the barn?” he said doubtfully. “Shouldn’t I take you <em>home</em>?”</p><p>“I’d get in trouble,” Harry said, which was the truth. “I’ll just stay in the lounge.” It wasn’t technically allowed, but Harry knew people must do it and besides, no one would know. No one, he corrected himself, but Tom. Somehow that seemed alright, though, which felt strange. Harry wasn’t used to trusting someone so soon.</p><p>“Whatever you want,” Tom said doubtfully. He looked pensive, and didn’t touch Harry’s knee the entire short journey. Harry, hating himself for compromising his position, <em>on his first day</em>, couldn’t even enjoy the drive.</p><p>When Tom pulled up to the stable, Harry opened his own door and got out, grabbing his backpack from behind the seat, and eased the straps over his shoulders with a final strained smile for Tom.</p><p>“Thanks for asking me. I just, uh, wasn’t thinking when I said yes.”</p><p>“Hmm,” said Tom, leaning against the rear of the car, a bit rumpled and flushed from eating and drinking, looking at Harry in an unmistakable way.</p><p>It was too much, Tom Riddle looking at him like that. An indignant part of Harry noted the unfairness of it. Harry was a pathetically easy conquest. Tom probably was interested out of convenience and novelty, and it couldn’t possibly last.</p><p>Full of these thoughts, Harry ducked his head. “Bye, Tom. I’ll see you…”</p><p>“Tomorrow,” Tom supplied. He made as though to take a step forward, and Harry, his head still down, hastily shuffled backwards.</p><p>“Good night,” he said, and turned and walked fast toward the clubhouse.</p><p>****</p><p>The couch in the lounge was beautiful, but hard, and Harry was so afraid of being discovered there, and so intent on reliving every moment of the past twenty hours or so, he couldn’t sleep at all.</p><p>So, two sleepless hours later, he was walking up to the barn in the foggy pre-dawn with a saddle on his hip. The buildings were half-lit; the feed crew had come and gone. Harry set the saddle on a rack by the grooming bay and peered in at Hedwig. She was midway through her hay, and peered over quizzically at Harry her mouth full and a few stalks sticking out of the side of her mouth.</p><p>She was only nine, but she had the temperament of a thirty-year-old lesson horse, as though deeply exasperated by everyone but willing to humor them. She walked over to greet Harry after considering him a moment, brushing her muzzle against his outstretched hands. There were little flakes of sawdust tangled in her mane and tail.</p><p>“I can see you slept well,” Harry told her, chuckling, and reached for her halter.</p><p>It took almost ten minutes to comb the shavings out of Hedwig’s tail. She dozed peacefully in the cross ties while Harry worked, enjoying the silence and the methodical nature of the task, until he realized he had slumped against the mare’s shoulder and was half-asleep with his cheek on her warm, silky skin.</p><p>The sound of someone clearing their throat startled him back to alertness.</p><p>Minerva was frowning at Harry, and not in the way he had gotten used to yesterday. This was more than sternness: it was disapproval. She was already dressed for the day, her hair in a sleek bun, wearing her helmet and clearly ready to ride the horse that Harry had yet to saddle. He blushed.</p><p>“Good morning ma’am,” he stammered.</p><p>“Harry, it’s Minerva, I keep telling you,” she sighed, but her expression wasn’t as forgiving as her words. “Are you ill?”</p><p>“I’m...no,” Harry said carefully. “I just didn’t get enough sleep.” He fought the ill-timed urge to yawn, which was of course the sort of thing that became almost impossible to suppress the harder you thought about it, so he turned his head and swallowed it against his shoulder, horrified.</p><p>“I see. One of the staff mentioned they saw you leave last night with Tom Riddle. Is that correct?”</p><p>Harry didn’t really consider lying. He nodded meekly, glancing up at her and hoping his shame was easy to see.</p><p>“Harry,” she began, then stopped. She closed her mouth tightly, exhaled hard through her nostrils, and started again. “Harry. It is neither my business, nor my particular interest what teenagers get up to in their spare time. Trust me when I say that. But you are a talented young man. Tom enjoys certain benefits which you—and I—do not. In many ways, his life is less difficult, and places him above the ordinary rules which most of us have to respect, if we seek success. Do you follow, Harry?”</p><p>Harry hadn’t articulated any of this to himself, yet, but he’d already come to the same conclusion, more or less, the previous night. He nodded, looking down and shuffling his feet.</p><p>“I really am sorry to have let you down in any way,” he murmured.</p><p>“You haven’t let anyone down, Harry. But I’m not letting you on that horse in your state. You can hand walk her on the trails and then help Luna with the laundry.”</p><p>Harry was far too grateful he wasn’t being fired to object to untangling polo wraps and ironing quilts, so he nodded at once.</p><p>“Thanks, Ms. McGonagall. I mean, Minerva,” he amended at her sharp look.</p><p>“You’re welcome, Harry. I’m an understanding person, but I’m also a pragmatic one. Take care not to become unduly troublesome, hm?”</p><p>****</p><p>Harry didn’t see Tom all day, but in the early evening, when Harry was hauling in the last load of scrims to the feed room with the industrial washer and dryer in the corner, he noticed the black convertible parked in the same spot Tom had chosen the day before.</p><p>Knowing he was nearby set Harry into a spiral of uncertainty. Stupid, idiotic crush, making him compromise his lifelong goal, which was finally within reach. He couldn’t let his hormones steer him in this, let alone the giddy and impossible thought of really <em>being</em> with Tom Riddle.</p><p>He was so busy lecturing himself that he hardly said a word to Luna, who stopped trying to engage him in conversation after a while. Her half-hearted “see you” when they finally folded and packed away the last load was the first thing either of them had said for two hours.</p><p>Harry waved awkwardly at her, waited a few long seconds, then left too, switching off the lights behind him.</p><p>Ron was supposed to be picking him up and dropping him off, but his phone buzzed as he stepped outside. <em>Bad news</em>, said the text from Ron. Harry had been very much looking forward to a warm, familiar bed, and felt faintly sick at the thought of sneaking around the clubhouse another night. But he took a deep breath, reminded himself to keep everything in perspective, and walked to the clubhouse to shower anyway.</p><p>It was deja vu to emerge, damp but dressed, drop onto a bench to lace his shoes, and find Tom Riddle standing in the same place he’d intercepted Harry the night before.</p><p>“Can I borrow you?” Tom asked quietly, flashing a smile. Again, he was still in his riding clothes, and again, it didn’t look like he’d exerted himself much. He seemed more like someone who had spent the evening modeling for another photoshoot than anywhere near an actual horse.</p><p>“I have to get home,” Harry said, hating himself a little, and also feeling an odd thrill at turning down the invitation. “I have to do this all over again starting sometime around dawn tomorrow, and I barely slept last night.”</p><p>“Oh,” Tom said, looking completely surprised. Harry wondered how often he’d been told “no” in his life. Could he count the instances on one hand? “Well, perhaps tomorrow evening, then? We could meet earlier. Don’t you get done at five?”</p><p>In theory that was true, but Harry had quickly learned that for the staff and trainers there was no such thing as “hours of business” at any barn, even Windmere. “Not really.”</p><p>Tom’s puzzled frown deepened, and Harry sighed. There was really only one mature approach.</p><p>“Look, Tom. You’ve been really...nice. I don’t totally understand why, but you have been. Still, I can’t really...hang out with you. I’m not...I’m not here to, you know, have <em>fun</em>. I need to focus on the work.”</p><p>There was a long beat of silence between them.</p><p>“I see,” said Tom coolly. The transition from friendly and relaxed to chilly and distant was so sudden, Harry blinked. “If that’s how you prefer this to go.”</p><p>Harry stared at him, totally at a loss. “How I prefer...<em>what</em>?”</p><p>The space was dark. There were some outdoor lights left on, probably for security, and they cast enough light back through the oversized windows to half illuminate Tom’s face as he closed in. Harry leaned away from him, thinking too late that he should have stood up, but by the time that occurred to him Tom was standing between his knees and there was nowhere for him to go.</p><p>Harry was paralyzed by shock, but his body wasn’t totally immune to the press of Tom’s calves, encased in smooth leather, through the washed-thin denim of Harry’s ratty jeans. Tom reached into the waistband of his breeches behind him and drew out a short leather crop, which he placed under Harry’s chin to tip back Harry’s head.</p><p>“It’s vile to mention your fat uncle at a moment like this, but when he called over the weekend, he very serendipitously got me on the line, rather than Minerva. He had a few questions—just to clarify things, he said.”</p><p>Harry’s mind blanked with horrified shock. Tom <em>knew</em> about at least one of the lies, then. Not that it explained what was happening now, or why the firm pressure of the crop’s popper under Harry’s jaw was making his mouth water.</p><p>"I kept to what was obviously your story, Harry, don't worry about that. But one thing your uncle was eager to 'confirm' was the pay. You can imagine how interesting I found it to learn that you're being paid $2,000 <em>per month</em> for the honor of riding and learning here. Quite a bit of money. I suppose your relatives expect some evidence you were paid."</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes. Now that he had started to get his shock under control, he had no patience for whatever was going on with Tom Riddle, who could leap so abruptly from one personality to another. If he was fired, fine, but he didn't need to sit down and listen to this smug asshole lord it over him. He braced his hands on the bench and jerked his legs up, then half-vaulted to the backside of the bench. It was clumsy, but it got him out from under Tom, whose eyes flashed like a cat looking at something on the other end of a string.</p><p>"Fuck off," Harry said, his voice rougher and softer than he'd meant for it to be. "Why do you even care what I told my uncle?"</p><p>Tom smiled, the same easy grin he'd worn in the car, which threw Harry for another loop. "I said I'd seen your video, didn't I? I wanted you here, Harry. I could tell I'd enjoy your company. And I thought you could use my help, too."</p><p>"Your help?" Harry felt lost again. "With what, my dressage?"</p><p>Tom breathed out in a little huff that might have been a laugh, but he wasn't smiling anymore. "No. With your cash flow problem. That is, assuming you don't actually have six thousand dollars lying around?"</p><p>Harry crossed his arms tightly over his chest and leaned back against the wall, wishing he could get further away. The bench was between them, but Tom could still reach out with the crop and touch him if he wanted to. Harry wondered why that thought had even occurred to him, and tried furiously to focus on what Riddle was saying.</p><p>"Like a loan?" Harry asked cautiously.</p><p>"No, like a payment for service rendered."</p><p>Harry stared at him. "Services?"</p><p>Tom nodded, utterly business-like, as he absently dropped a hand to his crotch and rubbed himself, just once, the way Harry might if he was adjusting himself over an ill-timed stray thought in the inconveniently betraying standard riding attire. Without thinking, Harry dropped his gaze to follow the path of Tom's hand against the thick, dark khaki cotton.</p><p>"I could use someone who will do as I tell them, and $2,000 is Saturday pocket money to me. I'd be happy to give you a company check in that amount to pass along to your uncle, and no one has to know."</p><p>Harry's heart stopped, then thundered back to life, leaving him breathless and hot everywhere, especially in his fingertips, the soles of his feet, and his apparently shameless cock.</p><p>"Are you saying you'll pay me to fuck you?"</p><p>Tom grinned lazily. "No, nothing like that. But you have a pretty mouth, Harry. I can't be the first person to tell you that. And the way you're looking at me, I have a feeling you've used it before."</p><p>Harry wasn't sure whether he was supposed to be offended by the insinuation. He actually had exchanged a few blow jobs the previous spring with a junior rider named Neville. It hadn't been so bad, though—Harry reflected half-hysterically on the irony—Harry had mostly imagined Tom Riddle's centerfold when Neville returned the favor.</p><p>Six thousand dollars was a lot of money for something that Harry might have been convinced under other circumstances to do for free. The only thing that might stop him was the principle of the matter, and how he'd have to grit his teeth at letting Tom, who he now knew to be the most entitled, perverted asshole on the planet, have the satisfaction.</p><p>"How do I know you won't tell anyone?"</p><p>Tom snorted, looking surprised, which made Harry feel a weak flare of satisfaction.</p><p>"I guess you'll have to trust me when I say this isn't a secret I would benefit from telling anyone," he said. "This isn't something we're going to negotiate, Harry. You may either say yes or no, and don't mistake me, if you say no I will certainly ensure that you're no longer welcome here. So?"</p><p>"I..." Harry looked away, but there was nothing to guide him in the right direction, here. Maybe it wasn't such a big deal. "Okay."</p><p>Tom looked pale, but he was unmistakably excited. His smile wavered with a fanatic edge as he looked at Harry's throat, then his hands, then his face. Or rather, his mouth. The back of Harry's neck prickled with humiliation and he cleared his throat.</p><p>"Right here?"</p><p>Tom swallowed, composing himself in that swift way he had. Harry hated him, of course, but he was still fascinated by how Tom could do that: assemble a whole affect, expression, posture and all, and put it on like a shirt or a pair of shoes.</p><p>"No," Tom said gruffly, looking around the room as though just now realizing they were in a public place. Harry wondered with faint amusement if Tom, despite all his bravado, hadn't expected Harry to say yes. "We'll—maybe, my car." He looked at Harry, again turning his face at an angle that hid most of his expression and left his eyes colorless, just a dark gleam. Harry shivered.</p><p>"Okay," he agreed.</p><p>Harry followed Tom outside, feeling the strange urge to laugh. The situation felt completely bizarre, but Harry couldn't bring himself to break free of it. It was as though the moment Tom touched him with the crop he'd cast a spell, and Harry, though conscious of it, couldn't break free. He paused, puzzled, when Tom walked around the car instead of getting in on the driver's side, then arched a brow when Tom opened the passenger door and stepped back.</p><p>"What a gentleman," Harry observed, voice heavy with sarcasm, and Tom met his eye without any hint of the unease he'd betrayed right after Harry had said yes.</p><p>"You have no idea," he said smoothly, looking straight back at Harry. After another second, Harry relented and walked past him, bemused, to lower himself into the seat. Tom closed the door, walked back around the car, and got in too. Harry jumped when he started the engine.</p><p>"I thought...?"</p><p>Tom smirked, looking over his shoulder to check his blind spot, elbow resting on the back of the seat. When he shifted the car into gear, his right hand left the shift and slid over the seatback to settle on the back of Harry's neck.</p><p>"We'll find a spot that's private," he said. "I'd rather not have to be quiet."</p><p>The car sped silently down the dark driveway, its headlights illuminating the pavement, the trees and fence posts. It was like being inside a bubble, except they were going so fast that the wind picked up and tossed Harry's hair. The evening was cool, and he might have been chilly under other circumstances. Instead he still felt uncomfortably hot, having mostly to do with Tom's hand on his neck, rubbing his nape absently with his fingertips as though they were on a second date that was going well, rather than driving out somewhere isolated so that Harry could suck Tom off for money.</p><p>Harry felt a strange thrill at the thought of it. It wouldn't be like Neville at all. He wondered if Tom would appreciate Harry using his teeth, which was a tip he'd gotten from a website, but which Neville hadn't responded to well at all. Was this the sort of thing that should be negotiated in advance? He fidgeted, fighting the urge to cross his legs to control his own physical reaction to Tom's hand, and to the thought of going out in the grass somewhere and kneeling in front of him. It was almost romantic in Harry's mind's-eye, the hand that was holding him possessively by the neck gently cradling his head instead.</p><p>They got on the highway, but barely went a mile. He thought that driving out to a dark remote location with a stranger wasn’t wise, but couldn’t bring himself to worry. If there was such thing as teenage billionaire serial killers, he doubted they could also find time to perfect their two-point over a double oxer on a muddy incline, the way Tom had in the National Finals the summer before. Ron had recorded the final go for Harry, who’d watched it three times after class before Ron had awkwardly asked to have his phone back.</p><p>Tom had turned off onto a narrow gravel lane, hemmed in on both sides by tall, untidy trees, a stark contrast to the sculpted hedges and carefully pruned blossoming pear trees at Windmere’s main entrance. Harry realized, though, that they were still on the property. It was a couple thousand acres, he remembered. The new construction was layered over the old, but according to the website the property still boasted the original house and outbuildings of the historic ranch.</p><p>Tom had slowed to a crawl to keep the tires from peppering the car with gravel, and Harry leaned back against his hand. “Do you do this with all the working students?” he asked curiously.</p><p>“They're usually girls,” said Tom, easing the car into the grass. He turned off the engine and shifted to face Harry, his hand moving from Harry’s neck so he could trace Harry’s cheek and then his jaw with his knuckles. “I’ve never been interested in girls.”</p><p>For some reason, Harry found his gentleness to be too much. He angled his head away from Tom’s touch and breathed in, steeling himself. Tom didn’t appear to be getting out of the car, so Harry tentatively put a hand on his thigh.</p><p>“Here?”</p><p>It was too dark for Harry to see his expression, but Tom’s profile was edged in silver by the moon and stars, and Harry could make out his nod. Hear his breath hitch and feel his muscles twitch under Harry’s palm.</p><p>“What do you like?” Harry murmured, turning and putting his knees in the seat so he could lean over and be near enough to get his mouth in the right place. He looked assessingly at the steering wheel, but didn’t think it would get in the way. He moved his hand up Tom’s inseam and jumped when he felt the soft bulge of Tom’s balls between his parted thighs.</p><p>Tom let out a short breath and ran his hand up Harry’s back. “I like to be swallowed. I like it wet.” He was talking fast. “I want to hold you down on it and hear you gag.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. Nothing surprising, then. He had a vague suspicion, which he wasn’t stupid enough to voice, that Tom hadn’t done this much more than Harry. Maybe even less.</p><p>But Harry was reading something, too, from the cautious tenderness of the hand on his back. It wasn’t uncertainty exactly, but more like the way Harry had felt unbearably fond of Neville all through what were some objectively awkward and unexciting experiences. No one had ever offered any kind of intimacy to Harry, except the fierce, but at-arm’s-length love of his friends and Remus. Perhaps Tom and Harry had that in common.</p><p>The thought was half-formed in Harry’s conscious, but it made his hands steady and gentle when he popped the snap at the waist of Tom’s breeches and eased down the slim zipper. Tom lifted his hips and together they eased his breeches and briefs halfway down his thighs. Tom had either stopped breathing, or was doing it too quietly for Harry to hear.</p><p>Tom was about Neville’s length, but thicker, and his balls were large and heavy, which Harry didn’t think should seem so erotic, but he wanted to see if he could get them both in his mouth.</p><p>Not today; he was already concerned about the angle and the space. He’d only done this kneeling, and now he was at a ninety degree angle to Tom’s lap. He put his right hand firmly around the shaft, lowered his head and inhaled. The expensive-soap-smell was heady here. There was the pungent scent of salt—sweat—too. Harry opened his mouth and sucked the head into his mouth. Tom’s startled gasp sounded like music. He moaned too, and his first closing in the ends of Harry’s hair made Harry’s scalp sting. Harry twisted his head around so he could glare up at Tom, but he still couldn’t make out his face.</p><p>“What?” Harry panted.</p><p>“I don’t...” He couldn’t see Tom’s face, but his mouth was practically pressed against Tom’s abs, which were taut and trembling with tension. He sounded perplexed. “I didn’t think you’d just...begin.”</p><p>Harry snorted. “I asked what you wanted, and you weren’t exactly specific,” he pointed out.</p><p>Tom cleared his throat. “C-continue, then,” he said, and Harry, feeling the inappropriate urge to laugh, swallowed instead and got back to work.</p><p>After a few minutes of exploring, and Tom twitching every time Harry changed pressure or licked a new path across the velvety skin, Harry had found a rhythm and Tom finally seemed to relax. He had kept a loose hold of Harry’s hair, but suddenly he twisted his hand and pulled tight.</p><p>“Deeper,” he breathed, and lifted his hips as Harry exhaled through his nose and sank down.</p><p>The angle was almost impossible for Tom to actually make good on his initial wish, and Harry hadn’t ever taken anyone past his palate, so he felt mildly panicked when Tom pushed him down hard. But then, just as quickly, Tom was guiding him completely off.</p><p>Harry let him, startled. He couldn’t imagine he’d done anything unpleasant enough to spoil a blow job, which all the articles said would be at least acceptable no matter how badly you did it. But unexpectedly, Tom was grabbing at Harry’s waist, and hauling him closer to press their mouths together, a strange bruising sort of pressure like the violent cousin of a kiss.</p><p>“Use your hand,” Tom said against Harry’s mouth, his voice a hot breath, and grasped Harry’s right wrist to guide it down between them. Harry had to balance with his left hand on Tom’s shoulder, their foreheads close. A half inch away, he could finally see Tom’s eyes, ringed with amber, pupils huge and black, eyelashes dense and curled like a girl’s. He put his fingers around Tom’s cock and Tom covered Harry’s hand with his to guide the pressure and rhythm.</p><p>”This...” Harry gasped, his hip lodged painfully against the gear shift, his own hardness brushing agonizingly against Tom’s forearm, but not with pressure or friction enough. “This isn’t a blowjob,” he managed, and Tom grunted and took his hand off Harry’s, tipping his head back. That left Harry gazing at his Adam’s Apple, his hand stuttering a moment without guidance before he picked the rhythm up again with growing confidence.</p><p>Tom’s cock was sloppy wet from Harry’s mouth, and bigger around than Harry’s, but Tom seemed to like what Harry liked: firm, fast, with an occasional hard twist on the head.</p><p>“Fuck, Harry,” Tom said, still staring up, baring his throat. Harry impulsively leaned in and scraped his teeth against Tom’s the side of his neck. Tom’s cock jerked against his palm. Harry thought for a half-second that might be it, but then Tom was wrenching Harry’s hand off of him and shoving Harry’s head back into his lap.</p><p>Harry hadn’t had any time to prepare himself, but he reflexively opened his mouth. It was like jumping into a pool without taking a breath, and he had a moment of urgent panic before he remembered he could breathe through his nose. Tom’s cock went in further than it had so far, and Harry fought it with instinctive fury, gagging and digging his fingernails into Tom’s thigh, clawing him.</p><p>Tom’s response was to press in another half inch and come.</p><p>Harry thought he might die. It was the worst sort of claustrophobia, his vision tunneling from lack of air, and at the same time, in the midst of all of that fury, the hand Tom didn't have on his head snaked out and unbuttoned his jeans.</p><p>Harry jerked his head off as soon as Tom's grip on his head loosened and grabbed him hard by the arm, coughing, murderous. "You fucking asshole," he rasped.</p><p>Tom was leaning back in his seat, his fingers still hooked in Harry's fly. He looked boneless, and so smug Harry could have punched him, and he was also reaching lazily into Harry's jeans to palm him through his underwear.</p><p>"What the fuck," Harry growled, but the hand he had clenched on Tom's arm didn't do anything to deter Tom, and Harry couldn't actually bring himself to pull the other boy away. He had the taste of Tom's cum far on the back of his tongue; it was bitter, both literally and as a reminder that Tom had just raped his throat, more or less. But now he was caressing Harry's not disinterested cock with almost unbearable gentleness. Harry shivered and slumped back against the seat.</p><p>"This isn't," he panted, "Some kind of trade."</p><p>"No," Tom agreed, his hand gliding up so his fingers could slip down past the waistband of Harry's briefs and race over the bare skin beneath. "You can consider this a tip."</p><p>Harry looked down at Tom's hand, disappearing inside his clothes. Within the confines of all the fabric, and with his arm held all the way out, he had hardly any leverage. But his fingers were long and smooth, and his absent touch felt more thrilling than Harry's ever had.</p><p>But what sent him toward the edge was lifting his head to blink in Tom's direction, expecting only the silver silhouette and shadow, and finding instead that the moon had suddenly brightened, casting Tom's face in clear relief. So that Harry, captured by the look on his face, stared mesmerized and thrust up against his palm no more than a few times before he came, whimpering, against Tom's palm and wrist while Tom skated his fingertips in slow circles over Harry's tight, aching balls.</p><p>Tom pulled his hand free slowly, smirked at his messy hand, and held it in front of Harry's face. "Clean me up?" he asked, grinning.</p><p>"I," Harry said, feeling like he'd melded with the leather seat and would never move again, "will bite your fucking finger off if you try to make me."</p><p>Tom laughed, and pulled his hand back as though the threat was sincere. "There's some things in the glove box."</p><p>"Things?" Harry echoed, but he was already fumbling above his sprawled knees, searching for a glove box, concealed there somewhere. He found a release and the compartment sprang open, the automatic light bright enough to make him flinch back, eyes hyper-sensitized by all this time in the dark. There was nothing inside except a miniature manila envelope for the registration, a leather-bound owner's manual, and a soft plastic dispenser for wet wipes.</p><p>Harry drew it out, mystified. "God, you get up to all kinds of shit in this car, don't you?"</p><p>"Ha, ha," Tom replied, wiggling his fingers pointedly. Harry grumbled a bit, but he obliged Tom by opening the dispenser, pulling out a few wipes, and holding Tom's wrist between his left finger and thumb, he carefully wiped his fingers clean.</p><p>As soon as Tom's hand was clean, he took it back, the back of his hand brushing Harry's cheek what could have been accidentally. Harry closed the glove box as Tom jerked up his pants and pulled back onto the gravel. The headlights flipped on.</p><p>Harry's phone vibrated. He dug in his pocket for it, and swore when he saw the little lit screen informing him he had 22 unread text messages and four missed calls. He flipped the phone open, ignoring Tom's sidelong glance and amazed laugh.</p><p>"Is that a flip phone? I didn't know they still made them."</p><p>Harry ignored Tom and scrolled through his notifications. Ron had sent a string of increasingly alarmed messages, wondering whether Harry had made suitable arrangements and reminding him that he had a long list of friends who would be eager to help out.</p><p>Harry texted him back. <em>Sorry, phone died. I've got tonight covered. See u tomorrow.</em> He could sleep in the lounge without anyone noticing, he was pretty sure. He'd seen in-house trainers or their guests do it in other barns. Owners usually didn't care so long as you weren't seen or heard. He shoved his phone in his pocket, and realized they were still coasting up the driveway instead of back toward the road. A yard light was illuminated what had to be the original house, a sprawling story and a half of natural stone and painted wood siding, with a curving porch and semicircular dormers, it had a sort of Victorian style Harry hadn't seen before in old country places.</p><p>"Where are we going?" Harry looked over at Tom, confused. Tom's smile was gone, and at some point he'd buttoned his breeches and changed his face. He didn't so much as glance over at Harry and his voice was neutral when he replied.</p><p>"I said your uncle confirmed everything, didn't I? I don't know where you thought you could hole up—in the hay loft or something? Honestly, Harry. Anyway. No one ever uses this house anymore, and I have a key."</p><p>He stopped the car by the porch and tossed something small and gold to Harry, who caught it without difficulty and stared at it. A key.</p><p>"You'll have to turn the air down, I imagine, but it shouldn't be difficult to find what you need. They keep it all set up so it can be ready at once."</p><p>Harry just kept staring at the key, suddenly sure he couldn't look at Tom without losing ground somehow. "Oh."</p><p>Tom didn't say anything, and Harry didn't look up. After another long moment, Tom sighed, reached across Harry and flung open the door. It was oddly reminiscent, and yet nothing like, the gesture from the previous morning when they'd met on the main driveway.</p><p>"Okay," Harry said, closing his hand around the key and sliding out of the car, grabbing his backpack from the floorboards. He stepped back, closed the car door, sucked in a breath and looked at Tom.</p><p>"See you tomorrow," he said, but he wasn't looking at Harry. And then he put the car in reverse and sped backwards so fast Harry thought the tire might have grazed the toe of his tennis shoe. He drove fast, Harry thought; without the care he'd shown for the gravel on the way in. Soon the car was gone, and Harry was left in the utter stillness of the night, all the problems he'd been dwelling on all weekend abruptly solved.</p><p>But he had the strong sense that he'd only traded them for something much more difficult.</p>
