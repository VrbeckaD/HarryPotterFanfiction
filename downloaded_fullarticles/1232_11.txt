    <p>It was a pleasantly cool night in England, with plenty of stars shining overhead and a waxing crescent moon just barely visible in the sky. Godric’s Hollow was blissfully quiet as a woman in a yellow robe strode down the sidewalk, making next to no sound save for the soft tap-tap-tap of boots on the concrete. </p><p> </p><p>On the outside, all seemed peaceful to the Sorcerer Supreme. Naught a branch nor snowflake was out of place, everything serenely put together on the calm October night. But the Ancient One knew better. For just down the road great darkness arose in the shape of a black curl of smoke, rising out a window and into the night air, unaware of the one witness to it’s escape. A child’s magic cried out in sorrow, the sobs barely audible from the now open window. The feel of death was strong within the nearby magic, echoing of dark spells and bitter hatred. </p><p> </p><p>The Sorcerer Supreme picked up her pace. </p><p> </p><p>When she arrived at the opened door of a rather quaint looking house, she was nearly taken aback by the sheer <em> grief </em>that permeated the air. A man’s body lay on the floor of the living room, arms splayed out over his head and empty, soulless eyes gazing blankly at the ceiling. The yellow-clad sorcerer showed little reaction to the body, save for walking over and bowing her head before shutting his eyes. Now was not the time to lament just what she could have prevented. When she finished paying her respects to the first dead, she made her way up the stairs. Residual magic lingered all the way up, tears involuntarily springing to the corners of her eyes. She felt her heart sink to her stomach when the trail of magic leads to the ajar door of a nursery. </p><p> </p><p><em> Of all the Gods above and below, </em> she thought, <em> please let the child be uninjured.  </em></p><p> </p><p>From the hallway, she could make out the shadow of a woman’s body. Walking swiftly down the hall, she opened the door all the way. She felt a tear slip down her cheek and brushes it away with her sleeve. The woman, clearly the child’s mother, suffered the same fate as her husband. Her eyes were half-lidded, blankly staring at a spot on the wall. The sorcerer kneeled down to shut them, bowing her head and paying her respects as she did to the man downstairs. The child’s cries had silenced when she entered the house, but a quick look in the crib made her exhale in relief. The child, a young boy, was still alive. His forehead bore a lighting mark, still bleeding, a drop of blood drying in one eyebrow. Big blue eyes stared sadly up at her, tears silently rolling down the infant’s cheeks. Her heart, ancient and hardened from many years of experience, broke at the sight. </p><p> </p><p>She concentrated past her own grief and the magic-amplified emotions of the murder to pull at her magic. The Ancient One felt her voice become sweeter, a calming aura washing away all other emotions in the room. Gingerly, as to not frighten the poor boy, the sorcerer cupped his cheeks and wiped away his tears. </p><p> </p><p>“I am very sorry, little one,” spoke the Sorcerer Supreme as she felt her magic worm it’s way through the child soul. A mark had been left, both physical and spiritual, and she could not help but blame herself and her poor timing. If only she had been faster in tracking the dark force that terrorized this family, they may have continued their lives. She knew that someone would be coming soon, however, feeling panic and shame rise in her gut. Her mind conjured images of all those she left behind, of all those she couldn’t save. Glassy eyes and betrayed faces surfaced, and words came to her in the cool night air. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Not another.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps fate decreed it, perhaps her conscience demanded it, either way, it didn’t really matter. Though her arms retracted from the face of the child, she kept her calming magic in the air. Turning to the open windows, she adjusted the grip on her sling ring and focused once more. Muscle memory took over as her hands made a familiar circle. Golden sparks began the makings of a portal, Kamar-Taj’s courtyard pictured strongly in her mind’s eye. When the spell was done, there stood her home, the barest hints of dawn just peeking over the building walls through her small conjured window. She takes a deep breath and turns back to pick up the orphaned child and carry him where both his mind and soul could be healed. </p><p> </p><p><em> Harry Potter </em> , whispers the nothingness. Even with tragedy and dark magic in the air, she manages to smile as she balances the boy, <em> Harry </em>, on her hip. Nepal’s warmer air washes over her tired body when she steps through the portal, the sun just rising to greet her good-morning. It is a beautiful sight, maybe a good omen. No matter what, this child would not grow in the shadow of his parent’s demise. No, he would live here, far from the dark wizard who wished death upon him, far from those who would not know how to heal the wound on his soul. The Ancient One bowed her head to look at the face of her new charge as the portal closed behind them, the last flakes of golden light reflected in the boy’s eyes. He smiled up at her and giggled, and she could not help but smile back. </p><p> </p><p>In the light of the dawn, the Ancient One felt grief, anger at herself and at the world. But she also felt love and reassurance, knowing that perhaps all would be well. Something in her whispered, quietly, as though it could be heard aloud: </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Redemption. </em>
