    <p>"HAMELTON!! WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?!?! an angry Snape strode up to me in the great hall. In front of everyone.</p><p>"What do you mean, professor?" I say 'innocently'.</p><p>"Why. Did. I. Wake. Up. In. A. Prom. Dress?" He snarls *loudly*. "Anytime I try to change, it turns into a prom dress."</p><p>"Dream helped, and I don't care about detention." I say.</p><p>"Hi!" Dream said in her fake innocent voice from Hufflepuff.</p><p>"Get up, both of you!"</p><p>     We're walked down to Professor McGonagall's office and Snape explains. With Dream &amp; I being Lenginamens, we see that McGonagall's <strong>dying </strong>inside.</p><p>"Detention for 3 months." Snape said while leaving "150 points from Gryffindor &amp; Hufflepuff."</p><p>We are left with McGonagall.</p><p>"40 points each," McGonagall said after a while. "to Gryffindor, and Hufflepuff for outstanding transfiguration."</p>
