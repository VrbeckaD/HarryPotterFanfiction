    <p>           Lance couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face as he breathed in the late summer air. His luggage cart felt comfortably heavy in his hands as he maneuvered it through the bustling station, every so often a soft mewl coming from Mona’s cat carrier when he hit a bump in the flooring. He could hear his family chatting behind him, mainly his mother’s worried bumbling over his little sister Rosa. It was her first year as a student of Hogwarts, and his mother was running through her packing list for probably the sixtieth time. Even though it wouldn’t matter if she had since the train leaves in an hour, and they had already left their home.</p>
<p>           He allowed his mind to wander as he made his way across the station to the platform nine ¾. Lance vividly remembered his first year going to Hogwarts. He had been an anxious mess worrying about everything and anything he could. What house would he be in? What if he didn’t make any friends? What if he was a terrible wizard? His mother made sure to assuage any of his worries swiftly and decisively.</p>
<p>           Lance smiled fondly at the memories of meeting his best friend on the Hogwarts express, as well as his sort-of-best-friend-sort-of-rival. Hunk and Keith had been with his since day one, with Pidge joining their merry band of misfits a year later. He and Keith had been sorted into Gryffindor, Hunk into Ravenclaw, and Pidge into Slytherin.</p>
<p>           Lance glance upwards at the red numbered signs that adorned the red brick pillars lining the platform. Once he saw the numbered sign he knew so well his legs picked up pace automatically. His worn, brown brogue shoes clicked against the smooth marble floor in a steady beat. He ignored the shouts of his mother telling him to slow down and wait, the idea of seeing his friends proving to be more powerful than the potential wrath of his mom. Lance leaned down and hunched his shoulders, bracing himself for the impact of magic that would wash over him. Lance dove cart first into the pillar and revealed in the familiar feeling of magic flooding around him. London was lovely, but it didn’t have the electric atmosphere that wizarding areas had. The sense of anything and everything being possible, the feeling that he belonged.</p>
<p>           The Hogwarts express stood tall and proud, its burgundy paint shining in the early morning sun. Wizards and witches alike hurried around the platform, trying to fit luggage, robes, and pets onto the train before it departed. Emotional first years hugged their even more emotional parents, hushed whispers of promising to write every day and “I love you,” flowing between them. In the distance, he could hear the sound of spells casting in the distance followed by laughter, seventh years casting hexes at each other no doubt.</p>
<p>           Lance shuffled through the crowd cautiously pushing his way through a sea of colorful robes. He damn near tripped over at least six first years on his way to car 4. He made a motion to begin loading his luggage onto the train when he heard a voice shout his name.</p>
<p>           “Lance Averez McClain! Don’t you dare think you can get on that train without saying goodbye first!” His mother’s voice was teasing but still carried the stern tone that could put the fear of god into an atheist. Lance sighed and made his way back through the crowd over to his mother, arms open and cart forgotten by the side of the train. He wrapped his mother in a tight hug, squeezing her as hard as he could without causing her harm.</p>
<p>           “I’m going to miss you, mama. I’ll see you for Christmas, and I’ll write all the time!” He leaned back and kissed his mother’s cheek. He wiped away a small tear that had formed on her cheek, causing her to chuckle. She pulled him down to her level; he had grown at least a foot taller than his mother’s five-foot fame. She looked at him with large brown eyes filled with pride, love, and a hint of sadness. His mother then leaned n and placed a small kiss on his forehead.</p>
<p>           “Go find your friends baby. I need to help Rosa, and Sam, get situated. You better study for your Owls young man! And don’t do anything stupid. If I get one more owl from Professor Zarkon, you’ll be in deep, deep trouble!” By the time she had finished speaking Lance was running back to his cart, smiling and waving as he ran.</p>
<p>           Lance pushed his cart to the luggage compartment storing his large trunks; he thanked the attendant before lifting Mona’s carrier into his arms and making his way to car 4. Lance dodged a barrage of chocolate frogs and enchanted origami as he trekked to room 4C, the room he and his friends claimed every year. Upon arriving, He found that a shaggy light brown haired head was already jamming their luggage into the overhead compartments.</p>
<p>           “Need some help, short stuff? I know you first years are pretty weak and tiny.” Lance teased from the door. Pidge turned to look over her shoulder; a piercing glare fixed on Lance’s frame. He gave her a dazzling smile and moved to push the trunk onto the overhead compartment. She huffed and crossed her arms; a scowl fixed on her face. She lasted about five seconds before she cracked. Pidge surged forward and wrapped her arms around Lance’s middle briefly before pulling back with a broad smile on her face.</p>
<p>           “How was your summer, Lance? I didn’t get many letters from you this summer. Were you to busy messaging a certain mullet?’ Pidge smirked at the light blush that dusted Lance’s cheek.</p>
<p>           “Shut the hell up Pidge. I am not afraid to hex you.”</p>
<p>           She chuckled at that, “No seriously, how was your break?” she flopped onto the bench seat, pulling her small ferret Rover from her carrier.</p>
<p>           “It was good, hectic.” Pidge raised a blonde brow at him in a suggestive manner, “Not like that damnit. I was working two jobs and babysitting nonstop. I was stretched so thin I thought I was going to turn into a Stretch Armstrong doll.”</p>
<p>           “Two jobs? Why the hell would you take two jobs, let alone one?”</p>
<p>           “Well, dearest Pidgeon, not all of us have cool dads with awesomely well-paying jobs. I wanted to help out with rent for the townhouse, especially since I know how much more expensive it is when Sam, Alex, Veronica, and I all come home for summer. We all pitch in to help with food and bills.” Lance scratched his neck at the mention of his family’s monetary situation. He always felt so uncomfortable with the looks of pity people gave him, as if he was a poor street rat. He cleared his throat before continuing, “As for the second job, I got a job at the pet store in Diagon Alley for some cash to use during school. I’m tired of Keith and you always having to pay for me.”</p>
<p>           Pidge rolled her eyes, “You know we don’t care right? You’re our friend, and we’re not just gonna let you go hungry on our trips to Hogsmeade.” Lance opened his mouth to protest, but pidge cut him off by raising a hand, “I know, you’re very prideful about being able to take care of yourself.”</p>
<p>           “Enough about my summer, you still haven’t told me about yours you gremlin.” Lance changed the subject, anxious to keep talking about his financial situation.</p>
<p>           “It was okay. Matt took me on a few retreats to hunt for rare creatures. And by hunt, I mean study because anyone who kills a pandalope deserves to be hung by the neck until dead. We found some cool shit. Matt got a lot of good editions to his journal. I’d tell you about all the cool shit we saw, but you know Keith would get pissy if I talked mythical creatures without him.” She smiled brightly, her excitement to talk about the rare creatures plain to see.</p>
<p>           “Why don’t I tell you some of my babysitting horror stories? Sam and Rosa loaded me up with them this summer.” Lance leaned back in his seat, “It’ll help pass the time till mullet gets here.”</p>
<p>           Right as Lance was about to tell how Sam almost set the house on fire a knock sounded at the door. Two figures stood in the frame, “What about me and my mullet?”</p>
<p>           Hunk smiled at the two students already seated in the cart. His frame had changed over the years; the round pudgy baby fat had turned into bulky muscles. His face had become more angular, his square face accented by his sharp jaw. Hunk had let his hair grow out during the summer; he styled it in a long undercut with the majority of his hair pulled into a bun. The remaining fringe fell in front of his cocoa eyes giving the appearance of bangs. He still wore his yellow bandana tied around his wrist mainly because it wasn’t within the Ravenclaw dress code.</p>
<p>           Keith stood to his side with a smirk on his lips and arms crossed. Lance’s eyes were immediately drawn to Keith jawline. When they had left for the summer, Keith still had his baby faced cuteness that Shiro teased him for. This Keith and that Keith are not the same. The teen that stood before him had a sharp jaw, and his cheekbones were defined. His aforementioned mullet was pulled into a small ponytail, his dark bangs falling in his face. Keith’s eyes shone with amusement, his irises ever changing from deep violet to the color of the midnight sky. His once sickly thin frame had filled out nicely. Keith's shoulders were broader, and his chest was well toned, puberty hit him like a Nimbus 10000. His biceps are muscular from the intense training he and Shiro partook in. Overall his physique was muscular and lean, but not too bulky; anyone could see that Keith was fit. Being the Gryffindor seeker for three years would do that to a guy. But damn if it didn’t happen fast.</p>
<p>           “We didn’t miss too many stories, did we? Shiro wouldn’t let us leave until he pet Sophie and ‘Let her know how much he loved her.’” Keith’s voice had taken on a mocking tone as he finished his imitation of Shiro. Said cat was purring in the Korean’s arms, her fluffy brown tail swaying every few moments. Amber eyes lit up when she spotted Mona, who had been resting next to the window until the disruption Keith and Hunk had caused.</p>
<p>           A smile crossed Lance’s face, “Nah, I was just about to tell Pidge about how Sam almost set my house on fire. But what about you, mullet? How was your summer?” He scooched over to make room for the other boy, resting his arm across the seat.</p>
<p>           Keith slumped into the seat allowing Sophie to wander over to Mona. He glared in Lance’s direction. “It’s not a mullet. It just grows that way.” He raised a hand self-consciously to his hair, his pale fingers stark against the dark locks. “My summer was okay. Shiro taught me a few more tricks for Quidditch, and I learned something that I’ll have to show you later.” He shrugged his hoodie-clad shoulders, his tone indifferent to the idea of his summer.</p>
<p>           Lance raised an eyebrow, “Oh? And what’s this something?”</p>
<p>           The raven-haired teen simply smirked, “You’ll just have to wait and see.” He gave a small wink that had a slight blush to rise on Lance’s face. Since when does Keith wink?</p>
<p>           “Aww, you’re no fun! I was going to tell you all about my summer, but since we’re keeping secrets, I guess you don’t get to know how Sam almost burned down the house. So good day to you sir!” He crossed his arms and gave an exaggerated huff, turning his nose up at the other Gryffindor.</p>
<p>           Pidge snorted from across the cart, “You’re such a drama queen, my god.” They quickly turned their attention to Keith, ignoring Lance’s loud gasp and feigned offense, “So, now that Keith is here I can finally talk about all the cool ass creatures we saw.”</p>
<p>           Keith perked up at the mention of mythical creatures, “Holy shit he took you? What did you see? Did you see any sasquatch?”</p>
<p>           “No, Keith, I did not see Bigfoot.” The Gryffindor pouted at this, but Pidge ignored him, “But, we did see a bunch of shit. We saw pandalopes, death-dogs and blink dogs, a damn owlbear, and a multi-faced minx. And that’s just the new stuff.”</p>
<p>           “What in Merlin’s beard is a multi-faced minx?” Lance questioned.</p>
<p>           “It’s just what it sounds like,” Pidge answers, “It's a minx that can change its face. Sort of like a skinwalker but not as good. They can supposedly steal faces, but Matt decided not to test that theory.”</p>
<p>           “That’s so cool. You have to tell me everything Pidge.” Keith leaned forward in his seat; he looked like a child on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>           While the two monster hunters gushed about all the things, Pidge had seen Lance turned to Hunk. “How was your summer, man? You spend any time with Shay?”</p>
<p>           The Samoan flushed at the mention of his girlfriend, a fond smile on his lips, “Yeah, I spent a month at her house with her and her brother. We tried out so many new recipes, and I have a lot I want to try while we’re at school.”</p>
<p>           “Oh yeah?” Lance quirked a brow.</p>
<p>           “I have an idea for a candy that will make any food taste sweet, as well as candy for sour and savory. I also managed to figure out a spell to turn almost any food vegetarian. I’m still ironing out the kinks, but I’m excited about it.”</p>
<p>           “That’s bloody brilliant Hunk! If you need a guinea pig, you know I’m always willing.”</p>
<p>           “Hey,” Pidge’s voice interjected, “You wanna hear how I got a signed copy of Magical Creatures and Where to Find Them?” She flashed them a wolf-like smile.</p>
<p>           “You what?” Keith gave her a skeptical look.</p>
<p>           “Okay,” she began, “Matt needed some new books and school supplies and what not. So, naturally, he goes to Diagon Alley and drags me along because he hates me. While he’s off doing who knows what I decided to go into Second Hand Books.”</p>
<p>           “Cause that’s the place to go in Diagon Alley, not Weasley's or anything,” Lance interjected.</p>
<p>           “Shush Lance. As I was saying, I went into Second Hand Books to see what they have, ‘cause every now and again they’ll have books with notes on the pages or old restricted versions of books. While I was sifting through the new additions, what do I see? This baby right here.” Pidge pulled the book out with a flourish. The thick leather-bound book had seen better days, but it was in stunning condition for being almost eighty years old. The golden lettering on the cover curved in ornate script, a small bronze latch held the two coats together by a leather strip.</p>
<p>           “Merlin’s beard,” Lance whispered. He, Keith, and Hunk all looked at the tomb in awe.</p>
<p>           “I know right! So, I flip through it and see the signature as well as a small message in the back, and I knew I needed to have it. Now, I don’t know if you all can identify Newt Scamander’s handwriting, but with how much Matt adores him I’d have to be denser than troll bogies not to recognize it. I brought it up to the counter, and the clerk charged me five galleons. Five whole galleons, for a book worth thousands!”</p>
<p>           “And you’re positive it’s real?” Keith asked, peering suspiciously at the book.</p>
<p>           “Yup.” Pidge popped the p of the word, “As soon as I showed it to Matt and he almost had a heart attack. He checked it against his records of Newt’s papers and letters, and it was identical. He said the tell is that the 'e' connected to the 'w,' and he always left two drops of ink under his name.” Pidge proceeded to bury her nose in her new book, and quickly became absorbed in the tome.</p>
<p>           Lance recalled his babysitting horror stories to Keith and Hunk while Pidge read. He told them about how Sam had almost burned the house down with a haywire hex. Rosa lost her frog, so they had to tear the house apart to find the little bugger. Marco had developed a bootleg version of puking patsies and had wreaked havoc for weeks after. He also had some horror stories of his elder siblings. Alex had managed to half transform into his animagus form after a forty-eight hour stretch of no sleep. He ended up looking like a Japanese catgirl for three days afterward. Veronica had gotten smashed one night, she drunkenly tried to snog her girlfriend but ended up falling face first into the garden. At least three gnomes bit her.</p>
<p>           After what Keith and Pidge had begun to call ‘story time with Lance’ the train was about four hours from the castle. Pidge's nose had only gone deeper into the musty pages of her book, and Hunk was busy writing notes, probably about the spells he was developing.</p>
<p>           Lance turned to look at Keith, and the teen had fallen asleep. His head lolled against the bench; his long eyelashes fanned out over his cheeks. Keith's hair fell into his face; his lips parted ever so slightly. Keith looked so relaxed while he slept. He was beautiful. Wait. What? Where in the bloody hell did that come from? Keith was pretty, sure. But Lance thought all of his friends were pretty. He shook his head, causing Keith to stir slightly. Lance decided to follow his lead and catch some sleep before their arrival at school.</p>
<p>           He didn’t notice or care when soft strands of hair tickled his cheek. The smell of cinnamon and leather was filling Lance’s senses. He glanced down to peer at Keith from the corner of his eye, the other teen had fallen against his shoulder and was now using him as a pillow. He had curled himself up against Lance’s side, much like Mona would do on cold winter days. It was frankly adorable. A feeling of comfort flowed through him, a warm sensation that settled in his stomach. He rested his head against the pillow of raven colored hair and allowed sleep to take him.</p>
