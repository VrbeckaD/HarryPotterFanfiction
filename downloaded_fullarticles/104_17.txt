          <div class="userstuff"><p>He met Draco's eyes from across the room and this time he couldn't turn away, couldn't pretend not to see him.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the Firewhiskey he'd been shotting all night. Maybe it was the look on Draco's face, like the layers of protection and pride had been stripped away and he was <i>finally</i> vulnerable. Maybe it was the song, crooning away in the background.</p>
<p>
  <i>Remember when I moved in you</i>
</p>
<p>Draco's tongue darted out to wet his lips in a movement that looked unconscious and suddenly all Harry could think of was the taste of his mouth, the heat of his skin and the indescribable feeling of being inside him.</p>
<p>
  <i>The holy dark was moving too</i>
</p>
<p>Draco's face flickered with emotions, too quickly to follow, and he put his drink down. Harry felt his heartbeat quicken in anticipation. He shouldn't. He knew he shouldn't. Draco had been such a bastard when he'd pushed Harry out the door.</p>
<p>
  <i>And every breath we took was Hallelujah</i>
</p>
<p>Draco took a step forward, eyes on Harry, clear and certain, despite the bottle of wine he'd downed.</p>
<p>Harry stood straighter, unsure what he wanted to say, or do, but knowing he needed Draco closer.</p>
<p>He saw something spark in Draco's eyes - hope? - and then he half-turned, startled, as Charlie touched his arm and handed him a glass of water.</p>
<p>Harry glanced back to see Draco freeze, his face reverting to that cool, infuriating, indifference as Charlie stepped closer, putting a warm, strong arm around Harry and tracing a gentle pattern on his hip.</p>
<p>Harry didn't stop him.</p>
<p>Instead, he watched Draco turn and walk away. </p>
<p>Again.</p></div>
