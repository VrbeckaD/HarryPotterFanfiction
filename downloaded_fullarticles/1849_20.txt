    <p>~Hermione and Ron~  </p><p>Song Recommendations: Colourblind- Counting Crows, Make You Feel- Alina Baraz</p><p>“I can’t believe you guys aren’t coming back to Hogwarts this year!” Hermione mused as she packed her trunk for her final year. </p><p>Harry and Ron stared at her blankly. </p><p>“Of course we aren’t going back Hermione. We are 18 and the Ministry has offered us direct entry into the Auror program.” Ron replied. “Why would we go back and study and do exams when we can go out and hunt dark wizards”. </p><p>Hermione paused and raised an eyebrow at the boys. They knew they were going to train to become aurors right? That involved a lot of study AND exams. Instead of bursting Ron’s bubble she let it go and continued to pack her trunk. The boys were also packing because  when Hermione left for Hogwarts in the morning, they were headed to the Auror training camp. </p><p>Harry excused himself to say goodbye to Ginny, leaving Hermione and Ron alone for the first time since the war ended. They were celebrated as the heroes of the war and as such had been ushered from event to event. The few moments they had managed to sneak together since were awkward, rushed and unsatisfying. Now though, they were alone. In a room with a lockable door. And a bed. They rushed towards each other, their lips crashing together. </p><p>Ron’s hands went to Hermione’s hair and tangled in her curls. As he tried to deepen the kiss his teeth scratched against her lips causing her to recoil in pain. </p><p>“Ow! Be careful Ron.” She snapped.<br/>
“Sorry” He let his hands fall from her hair and rested them on her hips. He looked up at her apologetically. </p><p>Hermione placed her hands on Ron’s shoulders and pulled him towards her again. Their lips met, more softly this time, and Hermione slowly walked Ron backwards until the backs of his knees hit the bed. He stalled against the furniture. His hands slid up slowly from her hips along the curve of her waist, the flair of her ribcage and came to a rest when his fingers curled in her hair. He tugged her hair lightly and her head dropped back exposing her neck to him. He bent his head to her and peppered light kisses down her throat. When his lips came to the spot beneath her ear her breath hitched in her throat and a heat began to spread throughout her body. Without warning she shifted her weight and sent Ron backwards onto the bed. He pulled her down with him and she landed straddled across him. Hermione could feel his growing erection through both their pants and she ground her pelvis against it.</p><p>Ron moaned loudly and reached up to pull Hermione back down for a heated kiss. Their tongues met and swirled together. Hermione pulled back and sat up again, unintentionally grinding her pelvis against him again. Ron responded by pushing his hips up into her. The friction caused by the sliding fabric caused a moan to escape Hermione’s lips. She stared into his eyes for a moment, their mutual lust evident before reaching into her back pocket and pulling out her wand. Confusion hazed Ron’s eyes as he stared at her wand. She smirked at him and cocked an eyebrow before turning to the door.<br/>
“Colloportus. Muffliato”.</p><p>A sly grin appeared on Ron’s face and he immediately flipped her so she now lay beneath him and he was settled between her thighs. He kissed her chastely and he balanced his weight above her on one arm. His free hand cupped her face as he kissed her and slowly trailed from her cheek, down her neck and across her chest. His fingers danced lightly over the thin fabric shirt she was wearing until it found the hardened bud of her nipple. </p><p>As his fingers drew lazy circles around her nipple, Hermione felt a flush spread across her chest and between her legs. Ron’s hand left her breast and reached for the bottom of her shirt. He pulled it up and over her head in one swift motion. He threw her shirt behind him, making her giggle. He loved that sound. Her happiness meant the world to him. She lay before him in her lace bra and cotton tights. He stared at her breasts while sliding one strap down her arm. He traced the line of her bra and pulled the cup down exposing her to him. He placed a kiss on her nipple and savoured the feel as she bucked beneath him. His tongue swirled around her nipple dragging a desperate moan from her. </p><p>This slow teasing was driving her insane and her body was on fire. She was desperate for Ron to take the next step. Her hips ground up against him, trying to entice him to remove their pants. He was taking his time though making tonight count. Hermione’s hands were running up and down Ron’s back feeling the war developed muscles shift as he moved on top of her. When she had had enough playing she reached up and pulled his shirt over his head. He paused what he was doing to help remove the obstacle and sat back slightly. Hermione took this as her opportunity to pounce and sat up quickly, her hands making it to the button on his pants. Popping the button and sliding the zip down quickly her hands returned to his hips and she grabbed both his pants and boxers and pushed them down freeing his erection. </p><p>“Are you sure you want to do this?” Ron asked nervously.<br/>
Hermione’s answer was easily interpreted as she tucked her fingers into the waistband of her tights and began to slide them down her legs. Ron helped and soon they joined her shirt on the ground. </p><p>She felt his hands come around her and undo the clip on her bra and it fell away leaving them both completely naked. He stared at her in awe his mouth slightly agape. </p><p>“What are you looking at?” Hermione said nervously bringing her hands up to hide her nakedness.<br/>
“No.” Ron brought his hands to hers to stop her from hiding. “You are so beautiful”</p><p>The next minute Ron was crashing down on top of her, his mouth seeking hers in a hot wet kiss. His mouth scorched her body as he quickly kissed down her before settling his body between her thighs. Hermione stared into his eyes as he looked up at her and placed a kiss on her inner thigh. That kiss was followed by another that was slightly higher. He kissed up her thigh until..</p><p>“Oh god!” Hermione screamed her pleasure as Ron licked her molten centre. </p><p>His tongue was making a path of little circles around her over sensitive clit and he traced her opening with a finger. Her whole body was shaking. She had never been touched like this by another person before and she was already close to orgasm from his previous foreplay. </p><p>Hermione grabbed Ron’s head and tightened her fingers in his hair, encouraging him to keep going. Ron pushed his finger inside her and could feel how tight she was. He continued to lick and suck on her clit and could feel her muscles clench around his finger as she mewed her pleasure. Suddenly, with a final suck he felt her body tense and she screamed his name as her orgasm overtook her body. Her thighs clenched around his head as they both rode out her pleasure. </p><p>Hermione fell back onto the bed as her orgasm subsided. Her breathing was ragged and she had lost most of the feeling in her legs. Ron lay on his side beside her and lazily stroked her side while she recovered. </p><p>“Wow. Ron that was amazing” she breathed. </p><p>She saw the smirk grow on his face and she lent in a kissed him softly. Her tongue licking against his lower lip begging for entry. Before he could respond she pulled him on top of her again. </p><p>“Ron, I’m ready” she said as she stared into his eyes. </p><p>He hesitated. “Hermione, we don’t have to if you want to wait”.</p><p>“No! This is our last night together for a while and the only time we’ve ever been alone since the war ended. I want you now.”</p><p>He sat up quickly and lent over the side of the bed to retrieve his wand. She watched him as he muttered the contraception charm around them and she felt tingle of magic through her pelvis. With the charm in place he tossed his wand aside and leant over Hermione to give her a sensual kiss. She could feel his hard erection sliding against her wet opening as they kissed and again she rocked her pelvis against him. Ron took his hard cock in his hand and lined up against Hermione. He knew she was a virgin and that he would need to go slow. He just hoped he didn’t hurt her too badly. </p><p>“If this gets too much tell me and I will stop, ok?” he asked her. </p><p>She nodded slightly and Ron slowly pushed into her. She tensed beneath him as he entered her and her hands grabbed his forearms and squeezed. He immediately froze allowing her time to adjust. </p><p>“Just breathe, baby” he said and she did. </p><p>When she relaxed her grip he pushed in further. Hermione felt him stop again and she looked at him questioningly. </p><p>“What’s wrong?”<br/>
“Nothing’s wrong” he replied. “This bit is going to hurt. But I promise it will only hurt for a minute.”</p><p>Unsure of what he was talking about Hermione went back to paying attention to the feeling of him inside her. While slightly uncomfortable she wasn’t sure what the big deal was. In fact it was starting to feel good. Just at that moment Ron thrust through her virginity and her body convulsed in pain. He stilled inside her again and it must have taken all his will power to do so. He peppered kisses on her neck and chest to distract her while she recovered. She was breathing hard beneath him as her body became accustomed to the feeling of him inside her. </p><p>“Are you ok?”<br/>
“Yeah. I think you can keep going now” she replied.</p><p>Ron pulled out of her slowly and then pushed back again. Her body tensed at the change of direction and she willed herself to relax. He set a slow pace to allow her time to adjust and he kept up his kissing. A few more strokes and Hermione began to feel a tingle of pleasure. She pushed her hips up to meet his rhythm and he groaned into her neck at the feeling. He began to increase his speed and he pumped in and out of her. Hermione wrapped her legs around his hips which increased the depth of Ron inside her and they both moaned. Ron’s breathing and movements were starting to get more erratic as he got closer to his orgasm. Hermione reached between them and fingered her clit as he fucked her. Ron nearly blew his load there and then. </p><p>Hermione could feel the start of another orgasm and she called out to Ron. </p><p>“Ron, please, I’m so close”<br/>
“Me too baby. I want you to cum again for me ok?”</p><p>Hermione cried out as her orgasm overtook her and she felt her body contract around him. When this happened she felt Ron thrust inside her once more and he growled as he came inside her. </p><p>When their orgasms had subsided Ron pulled out of her slowly and lay beside her. She leant into his chest and they shared a tender kiss. A shiver spread through her body and she realised the cool night air was seeping into the room. She reached for a blanket but found there was none on the bed.<br/>
“Dammit. Accio blanket!” she said and the blanket flew from the floor to wrap around them. Hermione rolled over and Ron gathered her in his arms. She relaxed into him and he planted light kisses on her neck. </p><p>“I love you, you know” he muttered sleepily into her hair.<br/>
“I know” she replied.</p>
