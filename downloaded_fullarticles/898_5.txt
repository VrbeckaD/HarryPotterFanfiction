    <p>“Oh come on!” </p><p>“No no no! Not today Sirius Black!” A short woman screamed out over her shoulder. The woman dragged a large suitcase behind her and stepped into the side walk. </p><p>“You’re being ridiculous,” Sirius rolled his eyes. “I’ll call you a cab if you want to leave that badly.” A long drawl, surely enough to make her swoon but not today it seemed. </p><p>“I don’t need you to call me a cab, I am perfectly fine calling the night bus!” If she had paid attention she would have seen her breath in the cold chilly air. Large puffs of cloudy white in front of her face that she took no heed of. </p><p>One foot in front of the other, a steady march on through the quiet street. Or well it was quiet until they came along. </p><p>“Not in that condition you aren’t!” He called our, his own breath he did seem to take notice of. No large breaths as hers was, but small and sporadic. His heart rate was fast, his face turning pink. </p><p>He looked adorable really. Comically so, pink face and long black hair over a chronically cute face suited him to well. It made her angry just thinking about the unfair reality genetics had over physical appearance. </p><p>“Oh yes I am!” The sentence, when it finally pulled it’s way from her lips, was said in a rushed sort of fashion that was strange for her. She took her time with everything. Waking, waking, eating but especially talking. </p><p>It almost seemed as if she was unaccustomed with sleeping so fast, her face was turning an interesting shade of red as if the effort tired her. </p><p>“You. Are. Ridiculous.” Sirius crosses his arms around his torso and marched on steadily catching up to the her. </p><p>“Not today Sirius Black! Not today!” She glanced over her shoulder and seeing him closer then he should have had her walking faster. A dash to get away from him it seemed. </p><p>Magic in her state of panic would almost certainly cause her to make a mistake, she was almost desperate enough to do it. Sirius Black was the only man to ever make her desperate. Of course for all the wrong reasons. </p><p>“Amara! Stop walking away!” Right next to her. She could feel his breath. Almost catch sight of his statues features. Completely unfair.</p><p>“No!” She swiveled her head over to him, the sight of his quivering lip and kicked expression almost knocked the wind out of her. </p><p>A stray thought ran through her. ‘Purebloods and their stupid manipulation.’</p><p>Didn’t matter much that she was a pure blood as well. His blood was far greater then hers by virtue of who his family was. </p><p>“Amara!”</p><p>“Oh what are you going to do? Jinx me? Please! Oh I dare say I’d like to see you at it!” She was getting bold. She had never talked to him like this before. Even when she was at her angriest. He was the one who said things that made her cringe, she was the one who fixed. </p><p>“Amara I’m serious!” She felt the urge..</p><p>“Yes I know you’re name is Sirius now let go I’m leaving and you can’t stop me.”  His hand clutched at her forearm, not even his hand could completely grasp it. One of her many insecurities and he managed to set it off just like that. </p><p>“You’re making a mistake.” His words dripped with poison, and even then as she ripped herself from his grasp. She couldn’t really feel that she had made a mistake. </p><p>“Let it be the last mistake I make. I’m gone Sirius, you can’t stop me.”</p><p>She knew deep within her heart that whatever Sirius said about wanting a family was a lie. She knew, he knew. So why did he insist on playing house? As soon as he found out that she was with child, she would be gone. She knew it was the right thing. He would as well if he completely grasped the situation. </p><p>But Sirius was an idiot, an idiot man child who never got past his 16 year old self and his abandonment issues. He wasn’t fit for children. She knew, he knew. And yet he still fooled himself.</p>
