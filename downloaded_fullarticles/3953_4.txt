<p>Cocooned by scarlet fabric, magic unfolds<br/>a tale of lives long past - and lost<br/>Letters spanning time, proof of a loss<br/>that is not truly loss, but hurts as much<br/>A friendship, severed by the impossible<br/>and yet, maybe reborn<br/>its baptism are tears, because he who was<br/>is beyond her reach, forever<br/>But he who is become may yet<br/>become as dear to her as he once was<br/>A friend who sees, who understands.</p>
<p>Time is a circle, and not kind<br/>but along the way, there is light.</p></div>
