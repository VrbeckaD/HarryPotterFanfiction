    <p>
  <span>Harry got off the train dejectedly, his thoughts stuck on Cedric. Ron and Hermione got off behind him, arguing pointlessly. He saw his uncle and turned to say goodbye to his friends. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I should go, don't wanna keep Vlad waiting, ya know?" He said with a shrug. Hermione gave him an odd look. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Are you sure you're alright Harry? What you went through-" Harry interrupted her before she could get too far.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Hermione I'm fine. I just want to go home and forget this entire year even happened." Ron looked at him sympathetically, nodding his head as if he could understand what Harry was going through. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry spotted Mrs. Weasley pushing towards them through the crowd and quickly made his escape before she could reach them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I'll write you guys once I'm back home, okay?" He said over his shoulder not waiting for a response before pushing his trunk over to Vlad. He soon found himself pressed up against expensive Italian cashmere. For the first time in months he felt at ease. Vlad must have already been informed of what had happened as he began rubbing small circles into Harry's back with one hand and was soothingly running his other through his messy hair. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They stood there just holding onto one another for a few more minutes before silently releasing each other. Harry could feel tears collecting in his eyes. He quickly grabbed his trunk and made for the exit. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Vlad silently followed and directed him to a sleek black limousine at the curb. His trunk was put in the back by some faceless employee of his uncle's. Harry quickly made himself comfortable in the back seat and tried to wait for the door to shut before losing his composure. The dam that kept back a tidal wave of emotions finally started to break.  Vlad sat down next to him and put his arm around his shoulder offering silent support as tears began to stream down his face. He felt himself being gathered into Vlad's arms as he quietly began sobbing into his chest. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn't long before they reached the private airport where his uncle's jet was waiting to take them home. With strength he didn't know his uncle had, he was lifted into the air. He quickly wrapped his arms around Vlad's neck to keep himself from being dropped before realizing it was unnecessary. With an unusual ease his uncle boarded the jet with Harry still in his arms before sitting with Harry wrapped around him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Feeling too weak to protest being treated like a child Harry soon drifted off into an uneasy sleep listening to his uncle's slow heartbeat. </span>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Vlad looked down at Harry, gently petting his raven hair. His heart went out to the boy who had been through too much in his short life. He had heard the details of Voldemort's return through his wizarding contacts in the UK.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There were many things that the Fentons didn't know about Vlad. Though he had been their friend for many years, and would continue to be a close friend and confidant to the family if he had any say in the matter, there were some things he figured were best kept separate from that life. Becoming half ghost had opened many doors, which had eventually led him to uncover a whole new world to use to his advantage. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He had been dealing in rare magical artifacts for many years now, and what with shady clients and the inherent secrecy of the magical world, it became common sense that his personal life would stay separate from his magical one. This of course, was complicated when Harry was revealed to be a wizard.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Vlad never knew Harry was magical until he got his letter. He'd only ever known Harry as Harry Daniel Fenton, his favorite (and only) nephew. He never could have guessed that his best friends had actually adopted Harry James Potter. Seeing as the vast majority of his wizarding contacts were dark and had only ever had bad things to say about the Boy Who Lived, it came as quite a shock to discover that his cheerful and selfless little badger was in fact the same hero they had come to loathe. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Vlad's thoughts were interrupted by a tug on his lapel as Harry stirred. "No...please…" he whimpered in his sleep.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Harry," Vlad gently shook Harry's shoulder attempting to wake him. "Harry it's just a dream, wake up!"</span>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"I'm going to kill you Harry Potter." Voldemort spat with sick and malicious pleasure. "I'm going to destroy you." Voldemort stared down at Harry </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"After tonight no one will ever again question my power." Harry's heart began to race. He knew that this was the end for him. No one was coming to save him this time. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"After tonight if they speak of you, they'll speak only of how you begged for death." Harry stared at the tip of his ivory wand, rising to in place to point directly at him. Harry sat frozen. The tip began to glow a sickening green. "And I, being a merciful lord obliged."</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"HARRY WAKE UP!"</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry sat up with a gasp. Breathing heavily, he looked around trying to get his bearings. He spotted his uncle Vlad's concerned blue eyes before casting his own down at his shaking hands, a feeling of shame falling into his stomach.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"It's alright to feel afraid Harry. We all have nightmares sometimes." Vlad reassured him softly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry looked up at him bitterly, "But I don't have nightmares sometimes, I have them every night!" Harry yelled out running his hands through his hair. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Vlad sighed, unsure how to help his beloved nephew. Hopefully being back home with his family would help him to forget what had happened just a short week ago. The jet started it's decent into Amity Park airports private runway. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Come on Harry your parents are waiting for us. I'm sure Jack is just bouncing in his seat with excitement." Harry smiled at the thought of his family. It's always hard leaving them every September. Especially his best friends, well his best muggle friends. They didn't understand why he couldn't call or FaceTime them while at school.  Tucker was appalled when he heard that Harry's boarding school didn't have any internet or cell service. He tried to explain to them that it was an really old school, way out in the middle of nowhere. That just made them even more suspicious, well it made Sam suspicious. All Tuck cared about was the lack of technology.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He couldn't wait to have some nice, normal fun this summer. No dragons, no mermaids, no giant three headed dogs, just him and his friends. Or so he thought.</span>
