          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">The Blacks’ ancestral house functioned more as a theatre than a home. Here, his family (aside from those unmentionable exceptions) honed their skills and performed their parts and aimed to leave no visitor in doubt that the Blacks were the purest, oldest, <em>noblest </em>of all the ancient wizarding families.</p><p class="p1">Not noble in the Gryffindor sense of self-sacrificing fat-headedness, but in the sense of <em>power</em> and <em>superiority</em>: Black patronage was a thing to be coveted.</p><p class="p1">At least, it ought to be.</p><p class="p1">Regulus knew, now, that it was just a façade.</p><p class="p1">The Blacks had no more power than any other family. Less, perhaps, then some. They made a good show of it with the dark green wallpaper, the ebony floorboards, the goblin-wrought silverware all decorated with carved and etched serpents, the fussy clothes and attentive house-elves and mysterious artefacts lurking on every surface.</p><p class="p1">But in reality, Regulus suspected that most of the world considered them a bit… <em>passé</em>. Something to be tolerated for the sake of tradition, like an embarrassing spinster aunt. It was only the likes of the Crabbes and the Rosiers and the Bulstrodes, those cauldron-lickers, that fawned over the House of Black these days.</p><p class="p1"><em>Toujours Pur. </em>What a joke.</p></div>
