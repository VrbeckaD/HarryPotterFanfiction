    <p align="center">The Werewolf brother chapter one:</p><p align="center">Family sticks together: No matter what.</p><p>              It was a cold day in December. The year was 1927. Newton Scamander walked down the long path to his childhood home. He was feeling slightly nervous. For he had not seen his brother since his mother’s death a few weeks before. Newt sighed when he got to the door. He hesitated a little when he rang the doorbell. Newt was there for a few seconds before the door opened. In the doorway stood Newt’s older brother Theseus. He looked paler than usual. Like he was attacked by a dementor or a werewolf. His black-brown and brown-blue eyes were the only color on him. Even though he looked sick he had a smile on his face when he saw his brother’s face. “Newton. It’s good to see you,” his voice was weak but still strong and booming,</p><p>“Hello brother,” Newt said in his calm quiet voice.  </p><p>“Come in it’s cold out here,” Newt met his eyes as he said this and nodded without saying anything. Theseus stood out of the way, so his little brother could walk into the manor.  “How have you been brother?” Theseus asked as they walked into the living room and sat down. Newt did the same. Newt did not say anything for a while, for he was thinking about what’s wrong with his brother.</p><p>“I’m doing ok brother. How are you doing you seem…...” Theseus cut him off with his hand. Theseus then sighed.</p><p>“I know I don’t look well. There's something I need……” Theseus cut himself off. Newt was shocked by his brother’s tied tongue.</p><p>“What are you trying to tell me?” Newt asked looking at the door avoiding his brother’s gaze. Theseus sighed and looked at his brother.</p><p>“It happened last month around this time.  I was walking home from a walk. Because you know I needed to clear my head. Anyway, I was walking when I heard something it sounded like a howl,” Newt’s eyes grew wide.</p><p>“A werewolf. Did it?”  Theseus nodded. Newt put his hand over his mouth.</p><p>“You’re a werewolf now?”  Newt said taking his hand off his mouth. Theseus nodded.</p><p>“’I, Brother, do you see me as your brother?” Newt met his eyes, he could see tears.</p><p><em>‘This is rare.’ </em> Newt thought as tears formed in his eyes as well. “Yes, Theseus I do. In fact, I think it makes you a better brother in my eyes,” Theseus raised an eyebrow and laughed a little.</p><p>“A better brother? You see me as a brother now? I always thought you saw me more of a father than a brother?” Newt nodded.</p><p>“Yes, I have sorry,” Theseus nodded as the two fell quiet.  </p><p>“Would mother want this though: Me as a werewolf and you running around with animals more dangerous than Grindelwald himself?” Theseus said after a while. Newt laughed a little as he stood up and took off his coat. He winced as he did so. Theseus saw this. “Are you ok Newton?” Theseus asked before he took a drink of his tea that he made before Newt came over.</p><p>“Yes, just a little sore. I just came back from fieldwork,” Newt said bluntly. Theseus let out a sigh and looked at his brother who sat back down.</p><p>“What did you go against this time?” Theseus asked slightly annoyed.</p><p>“Dragon. Norwegian Ridgeback,” Newt said with a sheepish smile without meeting his brother's eyes. Theseus laughed at this.</p><p>“Why does that not surprise me,” Newt laughed also. For the first time, Newt saw his brother as a brother. This brother moment was ruined however when an unwanted knock came on the door.</p><p>“Are you expecting someone Theseus?” Newt asked getting to his feet pulling out his wand. Theseus did the same. Newt then switched to tracker mode right in front of Theseus. Theseus was amazed by his little brother for he never seen him like this. “Who’s there?” Newt asked voice stern but still quiet.  However, no answer came from the door.</p><p>“Who’s there?” Theseus asked this time with his big booming voice returning to its normal tone.  Newt looked to Theseus who nodded. Newt nodded back and opened the door slowly.  In the doorway stood someone that Newt had never seen before.</p><p>“Hello. I’m looking for Theseus Scamander: The war hero,” Newt rolled his eyes.</p><p>“It’s for you Theseus,” Newt said voice breaking a little. Theseus stepped forward with his wand still raised.  However, he dropped it when he recognized the person.</p><p>“Father?” Theseus said voice turning quiet like his brother’s voice but it was still louder. Newt raised an eyebrow at his older brother.</p><p>“Theseus how……..” Newt was cut off when Theseus raised his hand to stop him. Theseus was acting like a father again. Then Newt saw Theseus ran up to the man and hugged him tightly. However, Newt saw Theseus quickly pull away from it.</p><p>“Newt can you hand me my wand so I can stun this man,” Newt was confused as he handed his older brother his wand.</p><p>“What? what are you doing my son?”  Theseus pointed his wand at the man.</p><p>“Shut it. You left us. You left us right after Newt was born. How could you?”  Newt stepped up behind his brother.</p><p>“Um, Theseus,” Theseus turned around with his wand still aimed at his, their father. Theseus realized that he was shaking slightly. <em> ‘The full moon was last night.’</em> Newt mouthed. Theseus lowered his wand and sighed.</p><p>“Fine. Why don’t you come in ‘father,’” Theseus said through his gritted teeth. His father smiled slightly and walked into the house.  Newt was still confused as he watched this man whom Theseus claims is their father sit down in a chair. Theseus did the same. While Newt stayed standing not looking at anyone. Not even his brother who looks worse then he did before. “How did you find us, father?” Theseus asked voice getting weaker. Their father looked at Newt who was looking at the floor, then he looked at Theseus who put his hand over his eyes and let out a shaky breath. This made Newt look up sharply. Newt knew the signs of a werewolf. He studied them in school and after he was expelled. Their father looked in between the brothers slightly concerned.</p><p>“Are you ok Theseus?” he asked looking at Newt who was looking at the floor once again. Theseus nodded but did not say anything.</p><p>“Do you want me to get you anything Thes?” Newt asked not meeting his brother’s brown eyes.</p><p>“No Newt I’m fine,” Newt sighed at how firm his brother’s voice was.</p><p>“Who are you?” their father asked Newt who looked up to meet his eyes for a minute before he looked at the ceiling.</p><p>“Who is  he?” Newt flinched at his brother’s tone. Newt knew that his brother was going to lose his temper. “He’s your son. My brother, my little brother. You left right after he was born. Don’t you remember that?” Newt could hear the weakness in his voice. His temper was there but his voice was getting weaker.</p><p>“Brother. I think you need something to drink. I will go get some,” Newt left the room.  Theseus sighed. he knew that his brother wanted to get out of this situation but his father did not know this.</p><p>“What’s his name? Your brother, my other son,” Theseus sighed and cleared his throat.</p><p>“Newton. Newton Artamus-Fido Scamander,”</p><p>“Artamus?” Theseus nodded and closed his eyes. His father opened his mouth to say something when Newt came back into the room. He had tea in his hand. Theseus opened his eyes and nodded thanks when Newt handed it to him.</p><p>“Thank you Newt,” Newt smiled a little but he did not meet his brother’s eyes.</p><p>“So Newton, what do you do for a job? What house were you in, if you went to Hogwarts?” Newt smiled a little.</p><p>“I work with Magical Beasts and I was a Hufflepuff,” Newt’s father smiled a little as  Theseus closed his eyes as he listened to Newt talk about his work and school days. However, they opened when Newt started talking about Leta. Theseus could see tears in his brother’s eyes as tears formed in his own. Oh, how he missed her.</p><p><em>‘Why did she go against Grindelwald? Why didn’t she stay with me?’</em> Tears were falling down his face as he thought of his dead fancée</p><p>“She was very brave,” this was the last thing Theseus heard before he fell asleep.</p><p>              “Theseus?” Theseus woke with a start as his brother shook him gently. Theseus opened his eyes slowly.</p><p>‘Where’s father?” Theseus asked voice less booming but still demanding. Newt sighed.</p><p>“He said that he had something to do. He left about an hour ago,” Theseus nodded and cleared his throat.</p><p>“Did he tell you where he was going?” Theseus asked sitting up a little. Newt however only shook his head as he sat down across from his brother. The two brothers fell quiet but a question was still on Newt’s mind, but he said something else after a while.</p><p>“I don’t trust him Theseus, I don’t,” Newt said in a quiet voice.  Theseus raised an eyebrow and nodded into his teacup that was to his lips as he drank.</p><p>“We are known for our trust issues little brother,” Theseus laughed. Newt however only smiled and nodded. The two fell quiet again as they both fell into their own thoughts in their minds.</p><p>Newt decided to leave a few hours later but Theseus stopped him. “Wait, little brother, don’t trust anyone. You have a stronger will then me, well we both but still. Don’t even trust father,” Newt nodded to his brother who was standing now but his hand was on a chair for support. Newt nodded once more before he left the house. Newt walked down the road thinking about his brother’s warning. Newt got lost in thought again as he walked down the road to his house. Newt, however, did not see where he was going when he ran into someone. Unfortunately, it was his father.</p><p>“Hello, son. Where are you going?” He asked in a sing-song voice. Newt did not say anything for he did not trust his father and he was keeping his brother’s warning in the back of his mind. “Son, what's wrong?” Newt started to walk away from him at a fast pace. He did not listen to his father yelling at him. There were some people on the street and only a few looked at the father and son. “Newton get back here right now!”  Newt did not stop when his father used his full name. He, however, flinched at it. People in the street screamed when Newt’s father pulled out his wand and aimed it at his youngest son. He then yelled a spell. Newt then fell to the ground unconscious. No one saw what happened next as Newt’s father pulled him into an alleyway and apparated away.</p><p>              Theseus woke with a start as he had a nightmare. This was rare for Theseus he never has any nightmares. Theseus realized that he felt better than the night before. Theseus then sighed as he got off his bed and walked to the window where he saw the mail. However, one letter made him drop all the others. The note was addressed to him from his father it read:</p><p>
  <em>‘Dear Theseus,</em>
</p><p><em>I have your little brother who you failed to tell me about. I’m taking him to Grindelwald, don’t come looking for us, if you want your brother to live.’</em>             </p><p>Theseus had tears in his eyes as anger when though him. He could feel his inner wolf clawing to break free but failing at it. Theseus threw the letter across the room and ran to the door, picking up the letter as he ran to the door. He then quickly checked if he had his wand and then ran out the door.</p>
