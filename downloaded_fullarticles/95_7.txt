  <strong>Prologue</strong>
</p><p>Blinding headlights; screeching tires—</p><p>People say that you reminisce in your final moments of life. Well, maybe they had the luxury of time to do so. I didn’t—not that I had issues with that. After all, I always believed that a swift death was the best way to die. Was it morbid? To think of how I’d like to die?</p><p>It was a whimsical thought, floating in and out whenever life got a bit <em>boring</em>. Ah, that same relentless repetition where everybody, generations upon generations, seemed programmed to do the same sort of thing: do well in school, get a job, earn money, settle down and start a family…</p><p>And even when life wasn’t dull, it was a terribly twisted game. Hard work could mean nothing in the face of true genius. But even being a genius, did not guarantee success in life because there was this thing called <em>luck </em>where for the same efforts, some were rewarded while others were ignored.</p><p><em>Life is not fair</em>.</p><p>It wasn't. There were those who failed at an exam that I had passed with relatively little studying. And there were those one or two students who excelled without needing to crack open their textbooks during their whole college life—a feat that I could never dream of accomplishing.</p><p>Intelligence, success, good relationships, and a happy family. One would say that I should want for nothing more.</p><p>But I did.</p><p>The intelligence that had paved a road for a successful future, friends who would lend a helping hand whenever I was in difficulty, a family that always stood by me… I had them all, but still, I do not think I could say that I was happy.</p><p>So, perhaps Life in its own twisted way <em>was </em>fair.</p><p>The basic sympathy I lacked was the one thing that I found to be of great importance as I went through life. Humans were social creatures, and <em>sympathy </em>was something that <em>connected </em>individuals together. It was normal to care, and while I could imitate that normality— never act coldly to others, a comforting touch on the arm at times of distress, a hug, a gentle pat on the back when the person was sad—I could never feel a single thing towards another person.</p><p>I didn't care about anyone.</p><p>Suffice to say, the issue with a lack of sympathy is that it isolates you. Not physically. But emotionally. I think I could have owned the world, and still, I would not have been happy. There was only so much joy that material objects could give to me; without sympathy, I could form no bonds with others—I simply had no attachment to the world.</p><p>And so I went on with my life. Days turned to years as they blurred together, and somewhere along the line, I realized that while I <em>existed</em>, I had stopped <em>living</em>. The days started and ended like clockwork and life became a dull, tedious game I was forced to partake in. I never thought of ending it, but I did question the reason of my existence.</p><p>So, I can honestly say that it was with great relief when I felt darkness settle into my vision as I relaxed and prepared myself for the embrace of death.</p><p>That embrace never came.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>
  <strong>Chapter 1: The Game Called Life</strong>
</p><p>The sounds of a nearby trickling stream and the soft melodic trills of birds could be heard. The gentle breeze rustling through the woods and the morning rays which created pools of light on the leaves-covered ground gave an ephemeral air to the forest. Many villagers who lived near the forest had always claimed that there was something <em>magical</em> about it—and they were not wrong, for there was indeed magic at play.</p><p>However, on this seemingly peaceful summer day, the beauty of the forest was marred by the broken form of what should have been a fair-skinned child. The child's body was mottled with bruises and her raven-coloured hair, filthy and disheveled, hid her face.</p><p>More important was that she had been dead, at least until a few moments ago.</p><p>Suddenly, the child's chest lifted. A sharp rasping gasp echoed in the silence of the forest.</p><p> </p><p align="center">o - o - o - o - o</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Once, once upon a time she remembered the warm fuzzy feelings, the cold bitter pangs; the vibrant colours that emotions painted…</em>
</p><p>Cyrna Raine had always known that there was something a bit… <em>off </em>about her. Her lack of reaction to certain situations scared even herself. The word callous echoed strikingly in her mind since the day she had stared blandly at her weeping cousin. The death of her aunt, someone practically like a second mother to her, should have shocked her into tears, at the very least. Her cousin stared at her with a hint of disgust at the hospital, eyes red and puffed from the crying before she screamed <em>that</em> <em>word</em> at her in anger.</p><p>But Cyrna hadn't been trying to be cold. She hadn't been trying to not feel anything—in fact, never before had she wanted to feel <em>something</em>, but like all the other times in the past, she just simply <em>didn't.</em></p><p>The steady throbbing in her temple worsened as she tried to open her eyes, and a feverish chill seemed to settle in her body, making her feel hot and cold at the same time. A sharp throb raced across her mind leaving behind a trail of blinding pain. Despite this, she grasped desperately at consciousness, forcing her eyes open. She saw blurs of green above her, some patches reaching down to the muddy brown that seemed to stretch on forever. The scent of dampened soil just after rain… her fingers twitched, and she felt the moistened dirt cake under her fingernails.</p><p>Not dead, since she didn’t want to believe that death could feel this awful.</p><p>She had been walking back to her apartment from the library beside her medical school… a school boasting of tall arches of steel and iron; wide expanses of glass… certainly <em>nothing</em> remotely close to nature—</p><p>A rustle of leaves; a tiny blurred form with large floppy ears peered down at her.</p><p>A snuffle. Something terribly similar to whiskers brushed across her face. It nudged her, and its soft fur was like a feather against her skin. Another snuffle before it skittered away.</p><p>Definitely not dead. Alive—</p><p>—Then where was she?</p><p>A turbulent emotion started to build in her chest; her breaths felt shallow as her heart drummed quicker and quicker. <em>Think! </em>The library… finally finished her notes thirty minutes till midnight—she remembered glancing at her phone… it was pitch black as she walked back despite the few streetlights… then…</p><p>A bright light and then she was no longer standing, airborne for a moment before her world exploded with pain, sharp and swift—a <em>crack as she hit the ground. </em>A simple car accident, but it had felt pretty fatal to her—</p><p>—<em>How could she be alive?</em></p><p>Even if she <em>had</em> survived, shouldn't she be in a clean, sterile hospital room? Or even on the asphalt ground if she had been left for dead? Where the <em>hell </em>was she?</p><p>
  <em>"Laufeia…"</em>
</p><p>Cyrna was shaken from her thoughts at the sound of a voice. It echoed eerily; touched upon her mind in a light caress. A hallucination? Her breaths shortened; vision fading in and out as pain continued to build, her head pounding as if someone was repeatedly smacking her temple with a metal rod. Her fists tightened, refusing to scream.</p><p>Then suddenly, the pain doubled, sharp and piercing.</p><p>Nonsensical images began to flash through her mind: a circle of elders whose faces stared severely down at her. Dim-lit room. Walls that trapped her in solitude —<em> Why?</em></p><p>Cyrna grasped blindly at these images as they appeared, but the moment she did so, the scene faded away like the wisps of cigarette smoke, a new one then taking its place:</p><p>One of the most beautiful women she had ever seen if not for the absolute look of disgust on her face.</p><p><em>Mother? </em>a quiet voice which did not belong to her had cried out.</p><p>The image faded to smoke, in its place was a sneering raven-haired man.</p><p>
  <em>Father?</em>
</p><p>A strangled sound as memories upon memories flooded her mind. The joy, the curiosity, the fear, the sorrow and desolation. She could feel them all as if they were her own. <em>Hers. </em></p><p>The whine which had been building in her throat poured out into the still of the forest. A keen. <em>Sheer pain. </em>She clutched her head, biting her lips in an effort to silent herself as <em>pain</em>, indescribable to any other sensation she had felt before, built in her chest.</p><p>It bubbled; then burst.</p><p>She screamed; a loud guttural cry ripping from her mouth filled with an intensity that frightened even her.</p><p>In the creeping darkness of her vision, she could hear a faint "pop"—a pop that was awfully reminiscent of the times she played with bubbles as a child. Cyrna smiled. Perhaps she <em>was </em>dead, and this was all just one mad dream. <em>But dead people don’t dream, do they?</em></p><p> </p><p align="center">o - o - o - o – o</p><p> </p><p>Consciousness was slow in returning. But when it did, it was painless. She was lying on something cushy; she was warm and the whole world seemed to be blissfully soft and fluffy. Perhaps this was death.</p><p>"Nicolas! Did you see the state she was in?” someone shrieked, high-pitched. Distinctly female.</p><p><em>Nope. Not dead.</em> She wouldn’t be that lucky.</p><p>Carefully, she cracked open her eyes, and once she did, there was little she could do to keep her mouth from falling open in a mix of wonder and confusion. Right in front of her, a distance away was a stone-cobbled fireplace lit with a hearty fire, dusty bookshelves that stored not only books but also jars filled with strange colourful things and—</p><p><em>—Eyeballs</em>. The round shapes bobbed up and down in the liquid suspension. Even from this distance, she could make out the iris and pupil of the eyes. The optic nerve, still attached, trailed after the eyeball as it floated around. The way it was stored sent shivers tingling up her spine. It deviated so much from the standard procedures of preservation that Cyrna was fairly certain it had no medical uses anymore.</p><p>In the other corner of the room sat a cauldron. It was a big iron thing that looked terrifyingly similar to the ones in a children's storybook where creepy looking witches huddled around to make their magic. The cauldron was actually pretty clean compared to the many other pieces of furniture that decorated this room, but the sickly green glow and quiet bubbles that came from it did nothing to calm her quickly fraying nerves.</p><p>However, all those things—those <em>issues</em>—they all seemed rather mundane before her last worry: the floating candles. They weren't those pretty decorations that hung by thin strings, nor were they projections made by some sort of advanced technology. They were, god's honest truth, <em>floating</em> candles in the most literal way.</p><p>"Not normal… black hair…"</p><p>A breeze blew in from a nearby window, stirring the candles as they bobbed gently along with the wind. Their flames flickered steadily, and squint as she might, Cyrna could see no strings. Was she still dreaming?</p><p>"I'm not sending her back!" the woman said more insistently.</p><p>No, better not to think that way.</p><p>Cyrna fought to remember snatches of what she had seen before she had died? Fainted?—</p><p><em>Where am I? </em>Her throat tightened again as she swallowed back a tiny seedling of panic. She stared at the couple who continued bickering as if she was not here. They did not disappear when she pinched herself, nor did the scene blur and morph into something else.</p><p><em>Of course it couldn't be a dream</em>.</p><p>She watched them for a moment longer; they had helped her, she knew. Well, the lady did, at least. The man didn’t seem to want to be a part of this. Either way, she didn’t think she was in any immediate danger. A deep breath.</p><p>"Excuse me," Cyrna said, her voice steady and calm—the voice she herself had used to talk with patients. Immediately, the couple ceased their arguments and their sharp gazes turned to her. She fought against her instinctual want to shrink under the nice white covers of her bed as they approached. "Could someone tell me where I am?"</p><p>"You're with the Flamels—in our cottage," the male said in a clipped tone.</p><p>
  <em>Flamels?</em>
</p><p>"You were injured in the Elven Forest, so we brought you back with us, little one," said the woman gently. "Though I have no idea of how you got into the for—"</p><p>"Yes, how <em>did</em> you get into the Forest?" the man asked. His expression was dark, eyes flashing with steel as he stood up and strode over to her bed. "Witches like you shouldn’t be able to enter."</p><p>
  <em>Witches?</em>
</p><p>"I - I'm not sure," Cyrna stammered, calm falling away as confusion took hold.</p><p>"Of course you aren't,” the man sneered.</p><p>"Nicolas!" the woman exclaimed.</p><p>Cyrna studied the man standing by her bed. He looked ancient with his hunched back. His countenance was not kind, though she wouldn't say that it was cruel. His gaze narrowed suspiciously at her as she continued her observations. Her eyes fell to his hands and she noted that his fingers seemed to have been stained permanently.</p><p>"It's suspicious, Perenelle," the man—Nicolas—said. "You know that only creatures live there, and you <em>know </em>how <em>they</em> are with their secrets."</p><p>The woman looked kind. She looked like someone you would be tempted to trust. Her forehead was creased with wrinkles as she stared at Cyrna with a hint of concern. Her gaze was warm, and her smile was soft. She made a noise of assent. “But perhaps—"</p><p>"No! There's absolutely no way she could be one. Look at how black her hair is for Merlin's sake."</p><p>
  <em>Merlin's sake?</em>
</p><p>The familiarity of that phrase stirred up some childhood memories. However, that was not the reason she was frowning. <em>They had said black hair?</em> She might not know what was going on, and maybe she was even a bit delusional, but she wasn't so far gone to forget that she was a brunette.</p><p>A brunette… she suddenly recalled the small raven-haired child that she had seen in the strange flashes of memories. Quickly, she scrambled out of bed to the nearest window. Black hair which framed a childish face was paired with wide blue eyes that seemed to peer mockingly back at her.</p><p>Cyrna stumbled back, her mind rapidly assembling a plausible story together.</p><p><em>Impossible! </em>This story was impossible—yet, here she was.</p><p>Life had always been a game where people were never dealt equal hands. It was a pathetic game, one that she had grudgingly suffered through once. To think that she had to play it <em>again</em>.</p><p><em>Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel</em>. She knew of them. How could she not? They were written about in history books and they made occasional appearances in fiction. Then there was the idea of <em>magic.</em></p><p>She glanced at the floating candles and reached up to grab one. The wax felt warm in her hand, and after waving it around, she released it back into the air and watched with a morbid sense of wonder as it floated back up to join its peers. No strings at all.</p><p>A twisted smile insistently tugged on her lips. Put <em>Flamel </em>and <em>magic </em>together…</p><p>"We should obliviate her and just get this over with," Nicolas said, eyeing her with suspicion.</p><p>Perenelle frowned disapprovingly at her husband.</p><p>
  <em>Obliviate?</em>
</p><p>A bitter laugh escaped.</p><p>"So has Dumbledore, sorry, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, contacted you yet?" Cyrna could barely ask the question out without laughing again.</p><p>"No, my dear." Perenelle stared with no little concern as a glossy sheen settled on the child's eyes. Terror and panic leaked off from the magic the child was subconsciously releasing. "Is there a reason we should hear from him?" she asked in a gentle tone, wanting to calm the child.</p><p>Cyrna had <em>never</em> viewed Life as a friend. And now, she had to wonder what trespasses she had committed against it. She thought back to the books. Dumbledore had not been the Headmaster during Riddle's childhood and the Flamels were still alive…</p><p>
  <em>So I could be in any time between the end of Voldemort's time at Hogwarts to the start of the Hogwarts Era.</em>
</p><p>She cursed brilliantly in her mind. It didn't ultimately matter which part of the timeline she was in. Even if it was the moment of peace before Harry Potter's life, it didn't change one simple fact—</p><p>—<em>Voldemort was still alive.</em></p><p>She was going to be stuck in the middle of a war.</p><p>It felt like her heart had stopped beating; she held her breath and stared blankly with a hint of twisted amusement at the faces of the couple who didn't even know they would soon be dead. It was ridiculous. <em>This </em>was supposed to be a <em>story.</em></p><p><em>This… stop! </em>Her mind spun. She needed to leave Britain and head to America—or anywhere else. But she couldn’t, could she? Not for a long time, at least. She had no money and was probably—unless the minimum age to work had somehow changed significantly, too young to earn any. So she was trapped. Trapped in this blasted place until she got enough money.</p><p><em>Trapped in another game Life had decided to play</em>.</p><p>The safety… her stability—family, friends, her career, success—<em>everything </em>that she had painstakingly cultivated… she watched it wither away, amounting to nothing now in this new and strange world.</p><p>
  <em>This was so stupid.</em>
</p><p>Her breaths quickened and became more and more pronounced before she lost herself.</p><p>Time seemed irrelevant as she laughed.</p><p>Laughed.</p><p>
  <em>And laughed.</em>
</p><p>Tears dribbled down her cheeks as the body she was now wearing shook uncontrollably with bitter laughter. She failed to notice as the room filled with magic, despite the magic being almost palpable. She failed to notice the screaming for her to calm down; failed to notice the crackling sounds of glass as the windows shattered.</p><p>But what was impossible to notice, even when she was so stuck in her head, was the thundering <em>boom </em>as the house was torn apart.</p><p>She halted mid-laughter, bitterness overwhelmed by the shock of what had just happened: <em>The house was completely leveled.</em></p><p>Her mouth slowly began to pull up, twitching into something that resembled a smile. Cyrna surveyed the broken glass and the debris that surrounded her. Her smile widened.</p><p>How could she forget?</p><p>She was in a world of magic, meaning that there had been a possibility that she could do magic as well.</p><p>…<em>did I just do that?</em></p><p>She surveyed the remains of the house; the rubble, the splintered wood…</p><p>Was that<em> me?</em></p><p>She stared at Nicolas and Perenelle who were both inside a translucent shield. They stared at her in a mix of shock and horror. She stared back, not even bothering to hide the unadulterated excitement that coursed through her veins. Her heart thumped faster, and for the first time, she felt and heard the whistling of the wind that whipped around her body.</p><p>The smile turned into a large grin.</p><p>
  <em>It was me. I did it.</em>
</p><p><em>I did magic</em>.</p><p>Giddy with excitement, she missed the softly spoken words of <em>stupefy</em> and the red light heading her way.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
