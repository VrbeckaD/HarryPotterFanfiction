    <p>A/N: I’m having writer’s block with Hogwarts is what??? So I figure that I’ll give you the first chapter of the next part. It’s short, because I’m moving before Christmas and my computer is dead. I’m writing on my iPad, so I do have a way to continue. I’ll keep trying to get the next part of HIW??? Up as soon as I can get past this block, and new chapters of this too. Enjoy!!!! Happy Holidays to all of you.</p>

<p>     An owl tapping on the window of his small apartment pulled Sam away from his newest book on Arithmancy. He got up from his chair and opened the window, allowing Dean’s owl Angus to fly in and land on his owl’s perch.</p>
<p>“Angus, what are you doing here?” He asked. The owl hooted at him and stuck out his leg.</p>
<p>Sam took the letter from him and dropped a few owl treats on the food tray. “I guess that you’re going to wait for an answer.” He said as he opened the letter and began to read.</p>
<p>  Sam,</p>
<p>       Dad is on a hunt and he hasn’t been heard from in over a week. Travis tried tracking him, but all of his stuff is at a motel in Jericho, and he’s not. I hate to ask, but can you help me look for him. The department is worried, Dad would never leave all of his stuff behind. His wallet and journal are even there. Harry would be with me, but he is taking care of some red caps. He’ll join me (or us) as soon as he’s finished. Send Angus back if you can join me, if not, keep him there. I don’t know what I’m going to find when I start looking for Dad. If you can’t come, keep him safe for me.</p>
<p>                         Dean</p>
<p>He dropped the note on the table in front of him and pulled out his phone, dialing Dean’s number and waiting for him to answer.</p>
<p>“Sammy, did you get my note?” He asked.</p>
<p>Sam laughed and shook his head. “Yes, are you close enough to pick me up or am I flooing to Jericho?” He asked as he stuffed clothes in his bag and tossed his potions kit and wand on top of them.</p>
<p>Dean laughed, “I’m downstairs, figured that you would need a ride if you were coming. You always hated the floo.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how long it’s going to take Harry to finish?” He asked as he checked to make sure that the window spelled for the owls was open and that there was enough food and water to last for a week for Angus and his own owl Frigga. </p>
<p>“He just called, he’s going to meet us in Jericho. He’s just waiting for the cleanup crew and then he’s going to apperate directly there.” He answered.</p>
<p>Sam looked around and grabbed the book he was reading, then stepped out the door and headed down the stairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dean had the impala parked right in front of the door, so Sam opened the passenger side door and dropped into the seat, dropping his book in between them. </p>
<p>Dean looked down at the book, “Sam, did Hermione send you an advanced copy.” He asked.</p>
<p>Sam laughed, “Yes, she didn’t want me to have to wait until it came out.” He picked it up and ran his hand over the title ‘Advanced Arithmancy: A hunter’s guidebook to staying safe and hunting monsters.’</p>
<p>Dean laughed, “She watches out for you like a big sister.” He said. “She’ll be here next week, she’s visiting with the Hogwarts professors and staying with her parents for a couple of days.”</p>
<p>Sam opened the book and continued reading from where he left off. “She really made it understandable for any hunter. I mean, I understand it because I did Arithmancy the entire time that I was at Salem and finished up with a degree in it from Stanford’s magical counterpart, but she’s made it so easy to understand that even Ron would get it and he never took Arithmancy.”</p>
<p>Dean snorted, “Ron never took anything that wasn’t easy. He does make a damn fine hunter, but his wife has him beat. I went to Salem with her, she’s one of the very best with magical beasts.”</p>
<p>They drove on, heading for Jericho.</p>
<p>****************************************************</p>
<p>“Sam, 5-0 get out of here.” Dean said into his phone.</p>
<p>“What about you?” He said, looking out the motel room window.</p>
<p>“They’ve seen me. Just go, Harry should be here soon.”</p>
<p>*****************************************************</p>
<p>Dean was sitting in an interrogation room, they had already taken his ID and his weapons. All they had to do was call his boss, they would take care of everything but since his dad hadn’t been using his work identifications they thought that he was in on it with him.</p>
<p>He sat picking at the handcuffs when he heard a door slam and raised voices. A few minutes later he could hear someone coming down the hall.</p>
<p>The door opened and the sheriff came in. “Agent Winchester, we are so sorry for the misunderstanding. When we assumed that you were working with the other guy, we didn’t know that he was an agent too. He never identified himself as one.” He removed Dean’s handcuffs and handed him back his belongings. “We didn’t know that the other agent had gone missing either. I’m having his things delivered to the hotel that the other agent told us you were staying at. You’ll have it by morning.”</p>
<p>Dean followed him out to the entrance and found Harry there smirking. “Can’t leave you alone for any amount of time without you getting into trouble Dean.” He said laughing. “Good thing Sam told me what happened. He was getting ready to come here and raise hell, but since I have seniority over him I figured that I should do it.”</p>
