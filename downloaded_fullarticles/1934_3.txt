    <p dir="ltr">As Harry sits in the train compartment on his way back to London, back to Surrey, back to Privet Drive, he thinks of the past week of what happened.</p><p dir="ltr">After having the false vision of his godfather, Sirius, being tortured in the Department of Mystery's Hall of Prophecy he remembered trying to think of who he could get to help. Dumbledore was gone, McGonagall was gone, Snape was there but when he started to head to the dungeons his mind started to think of why would he ever go to the dungeon bat? He wouldn't help Harry. No one would, he had to do this on his own, like always. He was alone, but he had to save Sirius.</p><p dir="ltr">He had devised his plan to verify that Sirius was safe, but got caught by Umbridge, almost to be tortured himself, meeting with Hagrid's brother, Grawp, running into the centaurs, ditching Umbridge in the Forbidden Forest, flying to the Ministry of Magic on the thestrals.</p><p dir="ltr">Once there, fighting the death eaters and trying to get out with the prophecy orb. Something was nagging at the back of his mind that something wasn't quite right. The prophecy orb was important but every time he tried to figure out why, the thought would continue to slip away.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the Order of the Phoenix members showed up to assist the teenagers, Harry was relieved that help had come. But Sirius was there as well and he lost him. Sirius fell through the Veil of Death because of Harry.</p><p dir="ltr">Overcome with grief, and irrational hatred and rage, he ran after Bellatrix Lestrange. After catching up to her he just wanted her to hurt like he hurt. Trying to cast the <em>Cruciatus</em> felt right, but his magic wouldn't come, it felt like it was pulling but never came loose.</p><p dir="ltr">Up in the atrium he met with Lord Voldemort. Harry was ready to fight the snake faced bastard, even though he could tell again that something wasn't right, something was very wrong with this scenario. However, Albus <em>bloody</em> Dumbledore shows up to fight instead. At that moment Harry wanted nothing more than to reach out with all his magic and suffocate Dumbledore with his own beard. Again, however, that thought slipped through as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore fought Voldemort, Harry got possessed and pushed him out, Bellatrix escaped, the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, arrived in time to <em>finally</em> see that Lord Voldemort had returned. By this time Harry was utterly exhausted and just wanted to go to sleep. But, Dumbledore wouldn't allow that yet. Harry was sent to the headmaster's office.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry was told the prophecy, his magic seemed to finally answer his call and destroyed Dumbledore's office and all his little trinkets. By this point Harry just wanted the night to end. His mind was sluggish and he couldn't think properly.</p><p dir="ltr">As Harry sat in the train compartment he continued to feel like a lot of things weren't quite right, he wasn't able to focus on much. He knew something was wrong, but wasn't sure what or how to fix whatever was wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">As the train got closer to King's Cross, Harry dreaded having to go back to his aunt and uncle's for the summer. Fucking Dumbledore and fucking blood wards that probably don't even function properly anymore. He knew this summer was going to be the worst yet.</p><p dir="ltr">When he disembarked the train, Luna pulled him aside and said, “The snake and the bat will learn of the wrongs, the false lion's mother and Death will be their salvation. The lion's needs will be met after the broken den is found. The bee will lose the lion, the weasel and the beaver will be found and all will begin to right itself again.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry was confused by this as Luna walked away. He knew this would be the only thing to push him through this summer but didn't understand why.</p><p dir="ltr">When Harry went through to the muggle side of Platform 9 3/4 he saw his uncle waiting for him. When he arrived there were Order members talking to his uncle about the events at the Ministry, even telling him that his godfather was dead. He knew then, that his safety net was gone. Yes, this would be his worst summer of all.</p><p dir="ltr">_*_*_*_</p><p dir="ltr">The car ride to Privet Drive was a silent one. Harry could see Uncle Vernon was furious with the Order members trying to bully him into behaving. Aunt Petunia's face was pinched. Dudley was quiet, which was odd for him to be so.</p><p dir="ltr">When they arrived at the house, Uncle Vernon was purple in the face but didn't say anything, they were still in view of the neighbors of course. “Boy!” Uncle Vernon growled, “inside - room - now!”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry took Hedwig's cage with him upstairs. He heard the cupboard under the stairs being opened and his school trunk with all his possessions inside, shoved into the cupboard. He knew that he had to quickly hide his most important items before someone entered Dudley's second bedroom. Lifting the loose floorboard under the bed, Harry placed his wand, invisibility cloak, photo album, and what little food and snacks he had left, into the small space available. </p><p dir="ltr">As soon as he finished he heard Uncle Vernon's heavy footsteps on the staircase. Harry hurriedly sat on the bed, waiting for his uncle and aunt to enter the bedroom.</p><p dir="ltr">“Boy! I will have none of your freakishness in my house. If any of those, those <em>freaks</em> enter my home you will understand the consequences of such abnormalities,” Vernon spat out at him.</p><p dir="ltr">“You will be locked in, your freaky bird will be locked in. If it makes any sound I will have it disposed of. Keep it locked up. Don't send any letters to your freaky friends. You will do your chores everyday. You will be allowed out once a day for the bathroom for 15 minutes. Any meals will be brought to you. We know that your good for nothing convict of a godfather is dead now, you aren't allowed any of your freakishness if you want to remain at school so we'll know if you use it to get out,” Petunia stated coldly.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, Uncle Vernon, yes, Aunt Petunia,” Harry stated blandly.</p><p dir="ltr">With that said, Petunia walked away and left Vernon to deal with Harry's punishment for last summer's fiasco.</p><p dir="ltr">“Get up. In position. Shirt off, hands on the wall, and feet apart,” Vernon told Harry. As Harry obeyed, his mind started to shut down. He had been through this routine so many times by now, that he knew that it was best to do as Uncle Vernon said. Harry could hear leather being removed from the belt loops of Uncle Vernon's trousers. “You will count, 20 lashes.”</p><p dir="ltr">Harry counted as each swing of the belt came down on his bare back. He could hear Hedwig getting distressed in her cage. Harry hoped that she stayed silent, he didn't want her to get hurt. After the last swing down of the belt, Vernon left the room and locked the door. The seventh lock clicked into place, allowing Harry to finally relax his tight shoulders.</p><p dir="ltr">He could feel the welts on his back burning, and the trickle of blood going down into his trousers. This was going to be the worst summer of all.</p><p dir="ltr">_*_*_*_</p><p dir="ltr">Over the few weeks, Harry's routine continued. Aunt Petunia would wake him up every morning at 6:00 am, left him for 15 minutes for his morning ablutions, then gave him his list of daily chores. This included making breakfast before Uncle Vernon left for work, laundry, dusting, vacuuming, cleaning the dishes, gardening, mowing the lawn, painting the shed, organizing the garage, making lunch, having dinner prepared for when Uncle Vernon returned from work, and anything else that could be thought up by his loving relatives.</p><p dir="ltr">If his chores for the day weren't finished Harry could expect his daily punishment after dinner. If he got dinner. Harry went many days without eating anything, or getting stale bread and moldy cheese. He drank as much water as his stomach could handle during his morning bathroom breaks. With the list of chores ridiculously long, he never finished his entire list. That meant he was punished every night since being back to Privet Drive. </p><p dir="ltr">Harry's back was covered with welts and scabs. There was never enough time for any proper healing to get done, even with his magic helping. His butt and legs were starting to get worse as each day went on as well. Uncle Vernon also started to use the knife on him again. His newest body art included FREAK and DISGRACE on his back and stomach. At one point his left shoulder was dislocated and his right ankle had been snapped.</p><p dir="ltr">With the starvation and the beatings getting worse with each day, Harry didn't know how he was going to make it through the summer. Each night he was having strange dreams too. Harry figured that it was him starting to hallucinate from fever and dehydration. </p><p dir="ltr">In the dreams, he could hear a woman saying, “Just hold on, dear. Uncle Thantanos is working. Help is coming. Just hold on for Mummy. Daddy Sev and Papa Tom are going to get you out. Keep holding on for me.” He could then feel as if someone was stroking his messy hair, and a soothing magic that calmed his mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry didn't know what to make of these dreams, or these words. He remembered what Luna had told him after the train, but he didn't know what he was waiting for. He was so tired and he hurt. His life was not worth this much pain anymore, he was trying to hold on, but it was getting harder to do every day.</p><p dir="ltr">_*_*_*_</p><p dir="ltr">On one particular day, about three weeks into the summer break, Uncle Vernon came home drunk. He was really pissed, stank of pub food and drink. He had received a visit at work that day from Child Services because one of the neighbors had seen Harry outside gardening for over 4 hours without a break.</p><p dir="ltr">Vernon of course told his usual lies about Harry, how the boy was a delinquent and a little bit slow in the head. How he didn't know when he was outside for too long and didn't know how to take care of himself. The social worker believed him but stated that she would have to follow up and to put a warning into Harry's case notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, this caused Vernon to get angry enough to get pissed and take all his rage out on Harry. When he saw his nephew finish the dinner preparations on arriving home, he grabbed Harry by the throat and dragged his upstairs to Dudley's second bedroom.</p><p dir="ltr">“Freak! What have I told you about being seen by the neighbors! I had a visit today from a social worker. At my place of business! Do you know how humiliating that was?! What will my boss and coworkers think of me and my family! You've done it this time.” Vernon was on the war path tonight.</p><p dir="ltr">_*_*_*_</p><p dir="ltr">From downstairs, Dudley could hear his dad beating his cousin again. He didn't know what to do. Dudley knew what his parents did to Harry was wrong. After last summer's events with the demon things he started to reevaluate his life and everything in it. However, he also knew that his parents would not like it if Dudley intervened. He knew that tonight's beating was not going to be one that Harry survived on his own.</p><p dir="ltr">After dinner, Vernon and Petunia went to bed. Dudley waited for his parents to fall asleep so that he could sneak the keys to Harry's bedroom. Once he unlocked the locks, Dudley slowly opened the door. He could see Harry lying on the floor, naked. There was so much blood. All over the floor and splashes across the walls and ceiling. Dudley tried to not breathe, or gag on the stench. He went to his cousins broken form on the floor, and rolled him to his side so Dudley could talk to Harry.</p><p dir="ltr">“Harry, what can I do to help you? You need to get out of here. What do I do?!” Dudley was frantic in trying to help his cousin.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hed-hedwig...” Harry croaked in a broken voice.</p><p dir="ltr">Dudley went to the owl in her cage, and unlocked it. He asked the intelligent owl, “Where's his stuff to send a letter? Do you know who to send it to? I don't know what to do.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hedwig hooted softly and flew out of her cage. She soared out of the room, down the stairs and waited for Dudley to meet her in front of Harry's cupboard. She started to peck at the lock, trying to get Dudley to open it.</p><p dir="ltr">Once Dudley did so, Hedwig hopped onto Harry's school trunk. Dudley understood what she was try in to tell him, so he opened the trunk to find parchment and a quill. “Do you know who to send this letter to? Harry needs medical help.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hedwig once again hooted and hopped into the trunk, rummaging  until she grabbed an old homework assignment with her beak.</p><p dir="ltr">“Potions?” Dudley asked. Hedwig hooted again, and bobbed her head. “His potions professor? I don't know his name, will you be able to send the letter without it?” Once again she bobbed her head, and hooted.</p><p dir="ltr">“Alright, let me get this written.” Dudley was having trouble with the quill but eventually he had a letter written.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Dear Potions Professor, </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>I'm not sure who you are but my cousin's owl said that I could write to you for help. My dad came home drunk tonight after a visit from a social worker at his job today. He took it out on Harry again. He won't make it through the day without some help. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Hedwig pointed me towards you for help. Please help. Harry and I haven't always gotten along, but he doesn't deserve what my parents do to him. Please come, he's dying and I don't know what to do. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Harry Potter</em><br/> <em>4 Privet Drive</em><br/> <em>Little Whinging, Surrey</em></p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Please come as soon as you can. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Dudley Dursley</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">“Here you go Hedwig. Do I need to tie it, or will you carry it in your beak?” Dudley asked the owl. Hedwig grabbed it in her beak and flew over to the front door, waiting for him to open it so she could fly into the night.</p><p dir="ltr">After letting Harry's owl go with the letter, Dudley went back upstairs to Harry. He sat on the floor next to his cousin and started to talk to him, “I sent a letter to your teacher. Hedwig helped me figure it out. She's one smart bird. She'll get it to the person who can help you, Harry. I know that I haven't been very nice to you growing up but after you saved me last summer from those demon things, I've tried to look at how we were raised by my parents. It hasn't been very pretty, huh? I'm sorry that you had to go through this. Just hold on a bit longer. Help will be here soon, Harry, I know it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dudley kept talking to Harry as best he could. He sat beside his cousin for hours just trying to keep Harry awake. He didn't know what else to do.</p><p dir="ltr">_*_*_*_</p><p dir="ltr">After Uncle Vernon had left the room, Harry had no energy to get off the floor so he just lied there. Maybe this was the end for him. It would be nice to be with his mummy and Uncle Thantanos again, he missed them.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry knew that something was going on with his mind. He could feel himself slipping after hours of being on the floor, waiting for the darkness to overtake him. He was so tired. It hurt so much to breathe.</p><p dir="ltr">When he heard the locks on his door opening he figured that Uncle Vernon had come back to finish him off. Harry was surprised when he saw Dudley. He was rolled onto his side, it hurt so much.</p><p dir="ltr">“Harry, what can I do to help you? You need to get out of here. What do I do?!” Dudley was frantic in trying to help his cousin.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hed-hedwig...” Harry croaked in a broken voice.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry heard Dudley talk to Hedwig, saw him leave the room and heard the cupboard door opening. He knew that he wouldn't last much longer. His mind was regressing fast. He was so tired.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry closed his eyes for a moment. He thought he heard the woman from his dream again. “Haddy, honey, Dudley sent a letter to Daddy Sev. He's coming for you. Just hold on for Mummy, okay? It's not time yet for you to come be with us. Daddy Sev will make the hurt go away. He'll bring Papa Tom and Uncle Lucy too. Auntie Bella and Auntie Cissa are waiting for you, also. Hold on just a bit longer, Haddy.”</p><p dir="ltr">Haddy heard mummy and knew she was right. He couldn't sleep forever yet. Daddy and Papa were coming. Duddy was getting help from Heddy to get his daddy and papa.</p><p dir="ltr">He heard Duddy come back into the room, and sat next to him on the floor. Duddy started talking to Haddy, but it was hard to listen when he was trying so hard to stay awake for mummy. He couldn't sleep forever yet, Uncle Tanny can't take him yet, mummy said so.</p><p dir="ltr">It felt like forever, he hurt and he was tired. He tried to tell Duddy, “Daddy, Papa, coming?” but he didn't understand. “Duddy, wan Daddy, wan Papa. Pease, Duddy. Owie, owie.”</p><p dir="ltr">_*_*_*_</p><p dir="ltr">Dudley waited next to his cousin for hours. He didn't know how long it would take for Hedwig to get to the professor and how long after that it would take for anyone to show up.</p><p dir="ltr">After a while he heard Harry trying to speak, “Daddy, Papa, coming?” but Dudley didn't understand. “Duddy, wan Daddy, wan Papa. Pease, Duddy. Owie, owie.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Harry, your dad isn't here. I know it hurts, but your teacher is coming, I sent Hedwig with a letter to come help you, okay? He's coming, not your dad.” Dudley didn't understand why Harry was talking like a little kid. This is bad. Harry's mind isn't right. Dudley hoped help was coming soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Another 20 minutes went by, when he heard three cracks outside the house, that sounded like a car backfiring. Soon after the front door opened up downstairs. He knew this was the help he was waiting for.</p><p dir="ltr">Running downstairs, he saw three men entering the front hallway. The first one inside was a tall man, around 6'3", dressed in black. He had long black hair to his shoulders and a large nose. His skin was pale and had eyes as black as the robe he was wearing.</p><p dir="ltr">The second man who entered was just a little shorter than the first man, but was still tall. He has brown wavy hair that was worn short around to his ears. His face was that of what Dudley imagined a fairy tale Prince to look like. The most startling thing about him though was his ruby red eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">The last man to enter the house was the shortest at around 5'11" and was almost the opposite of the first man in looks. He had long hair of blond so light it was almost white that fell down his back. He was dressed in silver blue robes that made his grey eyes look almost silver in the low lighting coming from outside.</p><p dir="ltr">Dudley spoke up when they were all inside, “Professor?”</p><p dir="ltr">The man in black replied, “Yes, where is he? Take me to Harry.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dudley didn't say anything after that, just took the stairs at a run with the men following behind him. When he got to Harry's door, he heard the three men gasp in shock at the sight of his cousin on the floor.</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to hurt him any more than he already was. I rolled him onto his side so he could breathe, but that was it. I didn't know what else to do.” Dudley was wringing his hands together. The blond haired man stood next to him and squeezed his shoulder to reassure Dudley.</p><p dir="ltr">The red eyed man spoke up, “You did the right thing by getting help. Thank you.”</p><p dir="ltr">The man in black, the professor Dudley assumed, started to say words in a language Dudley didn't understand and waving his wand over Harry.</p><p dir="ltr">“I've been talking to him to keep him awake, but about 20 minutes ago he started asking for his dad. I don't know what he was trying to say, his dad is dead. I think his mind might be broken. He was talking like a little kid. I'm sorry, I tried... I tried.” Dudley was starting to cry, he didn't want his cousin to die.</p><p dir="ltr">_*_*_*_</p><p dir="ltr">Haddy heard voices downstairs. He hoped it was Daddy and Papa and Uncle Lucy. They would make the owies go bye bye.</p><p dir="ltr">He saw Duddy come back, and behind him was Daddy Sev and Papa Tom and Uncle Lucy. Yes, they would make the owies go bye bye.</p><p dir="ltr">_*_*_*_</p><p dir="ltr">When Severus saw the snowy owl come into his kitchen that night he was confused. Did Harry figure out that they have been looking for him for the last two weeks? Tom, Lucius, and he had been trying to find Harry. Severus knew that he was with that bitch, Petunia, and her husband, but for the life of him, he couldn't remember where they lived. He knew that Dumbledore had something to do with it.</p><p dir="ltr">So, when he saw Hedwig with a letter in her beak, Severus quickly took it and read the letter, before floo calling to Malfoy Manor. He knew Tom was there with Lucius tonight talking about future plans.</p><p dir="ltr">Severus entered the floo and stepped out the other end into the reception hall at Malfoy Manor as Tom and Lucius entered the room.</p><p dir="ltr">“Severus, what's going on? You look frantic with worry,” Tom spoke up as he neared Severus, grabbing onto his forearm.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tom, Lucius. I just received a letter from Harry's cousin, Dudley. His uncle beat him tonight, he's dying. His cousin gave us the address. We can finally go get him,” Severus spoke quickly, making sure the urgency of the situation was conveyed.</p><p dir="ltr">Tom didn't need any more prompting than that. He called for an elf. “What can Felly do for Master Lord?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Tell Narcissa and Bellatrix that Harry has been located, and he needs medical attention. Tell them to get the hospital wing ready for him,” Tom told Felly.</p><p dir="ltr">With that the three men quickly apparated to the address given to them by Dudley. Harry didn't have much time.</p><p dir="ltr">As the world stopped spinning, Severus located which house that Harry was in, “Do you feel the wards? There is nothing protective about them.”</p><p dir="ltr">Lucius replied, “No, there isn't. We will have to come back with the goblin master warders to get a full accounting. We don't have much time.”</p><p dir="ltr">With that said they entered Number 4, Privet Drive.</p><p dir="ltr">Severus used an <em>alohomora</em> on the front door. Tom and Lucius followed him into the house. When they were fully entered in the house, he saw a teenage boy coming down the stairs. He had dirty blond hair and was average size for his age. However, he was also quite large around the middle.</p><p dir="ltr">Dudley spoke up, “Professor?”</p><p dir="ltr">Severus replied, “Yes, where is he? Take me to Harry.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dudley didn't say anything after that, just took the stairs at a run with the men following behind him. When he got to Harry's door, the three men gasped in shock at the sight of Harry on the floor.</p><p dir="ltr">Severus quickly went to Harry and started casting diagnostic spells to see what he could do. He pulled out his potions pouch. Severus gave Harry a blood replenisher and a pain reliever. He heard Dudley talking behind him but paid no mind to what was being said.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry opened his eyes, “Daddy Sev came for his Haddy. Mummy told Haddy he come and Uncle Tanny said it not time yet. Mummy said hold on. But Haddy tired and owie. Papa Tom kiss owie bye bye? Daddy, Haddy be a good boy but Uncle Vernon made Haddy hurt.”</p><p dir="ltr">Severus was shocked. He didn't know what happened to Harry but he was asking for him and Tom. Lily talked to Harry? How? What was going on?</p><p dir="ltr">“It's okay now, Harry. I've got you. I'll make it better.” Severus was getting Harry ready for them to leave soon. “Lucius, please get all of Harry's things ready to leave. He's almost stable enough to get to the manor.”</p><p dir="ltr">Behind him, Lucius was asking Dudley where all of Harry's belongings were. Tom came over to help Severus get Harry healed up.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry looked up when Tom knelt down next to them. “Papa Tom kiss Haddy better? Mummy said so. Daddy Sev made the owie stop. Haddy tired, Papa.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Sev, what is he talking about?” Tom was confused, and by the looks of it, Severus was too.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don't know. He keeps calling me Daddy and you Papa. He said that Lily told him we were coming and to hold on for us. I don't know, Tom.” Severus was getting more confused as Harry kept talking. “He keeps call in himself Haddy, too.”</p><p dir="ltr">Tom started talking to Harry to see if he could understand what had happened. “Harry, can you tell me what's going on? Did you talk to your mother?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Not Harry, I Haddy. Harry hurt and Haddy here now. Mummy tell me that Haddy stay awake. Daddy and Papa and Uncle Lucy coming. They take Haddy and Duddy. We see Auntie Cissa and Auntie Bella. Haddy owie go bye bye.” Harry's eyes were still clouded over with residual pain.</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay, Haddy. We'll take you with us, and make the owies go bye bye. Alright, baby? We've got you.” Tom spoke up, looking at Severus for confirmation. Severus nodded his head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Do you have all of Harry's things? We're ready to go. He's stable enough for a portkey.” Severus asked Lucius.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, I have everything from the cupboard under the stairs and from the loose floorboard under his bed.” Lucius spoke from behind the other two men.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry spoke then, “Duddy have stuff? Mummy said so. Haddy have to be with Duddy. Can't leave Duddy. No, no, no. Duddy go with Haddy.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Dudley, looks like you're coming with us. Get some clothes quickly. Anything else you need we can get at the manor or come back for another time,” Tom spoke over his shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, sir.” Dudley left the room and was back within five minutes with a small overnight bag. “Ready, sirs.”</p><p dir="ltr">With that said, the five gathered around the portkey and left Privet Drive behind.</p><p dir="ltr">_*_*_*_</p>
