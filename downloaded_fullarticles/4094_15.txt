    <p align="center">"The Angel" by Chris Corso</p>
<p align="center">Hogwarts</p>
<p>"Avada kadva," spat a dark, evil voice. A woman screamed; a child cried.</p>
<p>Ginny Weasley bolted upright in her bed, panting in fear. Her night clothes, drenched in sweat, just increased the chill that enveloped her. Her hand scrambled for her wand, and she instinctively murmurded "Lumous!"</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>'Nothing. Nothing's there,' she thought, relieved. "It was just a dream." Her hand grasped the small pendant that hung between her breasts. Touching it made her feel better. It reminded her of Harry, of their feelings for each other; of what had briefly been and would hopefully be again. The pendant had once belonged to Harry's mum and it was one of the only things that he had of hers. The pendant was of a small exquisite angel; specifically, it was a guardian angel, as Harry had explained to her. Guardian angels were not part of wizard folklore, but, of course, Harry's mum had been muggle born. Yet, Ginny understood the muggle attraction to them. She hoped that a guardian angel was watching over Harry now, wherever he was. She laid back thinking about Harry, missing him, envisioning his eyes... His beautiful green eyes.</p>
<p>The next morning , Ginny made her way carefully out of the Gryffindor common room toward the Great Hall. It paid to be very careful this year. The random violence of the Carrows and their Slytherin lackeys was an ever present threat for all non-Slytherin students, but especially for anybody in Gryffindor house.</p>
<p>"Miss Weasley."</p>
<p>Ginny turned and saw her head of house, Professor McGonagall, walking toward her. "Miss Weasley, I've been instructed by our..." Professor McGonagall cleared her throat and said tightly, "new Headmaster to inform you, as the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain, that all future games have been suspended."</p>
<p>Ginny's temper flared. Her initial emotion was one of outrage. Her brown eyes filled with contempt, but her temper cooled as she remembered how...horrible...the last quidditch match had been. Her hand absently moved to the necklace and Ginny noted Professor McGonagall's interest.</p>
<p>"It was a gift from Harry." Ginny said his name boldy, proudly. "Before heâ€¦ do you know it, Professor?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's eyes filled with sadness, with memories of the past. "Yes. It meant a great deal to his mother. If my memory serves correct, it was a gift from her mother-in-law. Her last gift. Just before the bad times began."</p>
<p>Ginny's eyes widened at the explanation. "How strange- and special- to have passed from mother-in-law to daughter-in-law," she thought. A lump formed in Ginny's throat. She wondered if Harry knew of its significance or the story behind it. He'd received the pendent from Professor Dumbledore, who'd kept it all those years, so it was possible he had known. Ginny had to ask, needed to ask, about her dream.</p>
<p>"Professor. Several times since I received it from Harry, I've had strange dreams... sometimes good ones- sometimes nightmares. The last one-" Ginny stopped, but , finding her courage, she continued. "The last one was of the night when his-when she-was killed. It was like I was there, like I was her. What might it mean?"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall exhaled sharply and closed her eyes. She opened them and her wand appeared in her hand. Slowly, she moved it across the pendent before again lowering her wand to her side. "It has been imprinted with memories, both good and bad. I think the longer you wear it, the more it becomes yours; the more your memories will be combined with hers. Good memoirs beget good memories. It is a connection between you."</p>
<p>Ginny had no idea what to say; her mind swam. She'd never thought of Harry's mum beyond what she was-his mum-and the one who sacrificed herself to save him. But now she began to see her as more than a memory. Rather, than simply being a person whom she'd never known, she became,in a sense, a real being: a woman, a girlfriend, a wife, a mother. Ginny shook her head. She refused to allow herself to dream, to go to place herself on the same path Harry's mum had walked. Not yet.</p>
<p>Still, Harry had given it to her. She brushed tears from her eyes. She missed him so much.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall looked at Ginny with sympathy. She reached out a hand and said softly, "Ginny, you have to believe in a future. You have to believe so he believes. When he comes back, and I know he will, he'll need you beside him." Ginny nodded her head slowly in agreement.</p>
<p>"Now, on your way. And Ginny?" she added urgently. "Do-not-allow the headmaster to see you wearing it."</p>
<p>Ginny nodded, mute. She would try to believe. Be ready for his return. Be ready to love him. Be ready to be his...forever.</p>
