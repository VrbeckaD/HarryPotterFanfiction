  <em>
    <span>Silence.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>That was all he could hear. Maybe aside from the thunderous pounding of his heart as he stood tall, but inwardly shaking, in front of the man he was forced to serve. If one could call Voldemort a man. Draco couldn’t see much humanity left in the putrefying shell the Dark Lord called a body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The grand hall of Malfoy Manor was cold. A shiver ran up Draco’s spine as the Dark Lord approached, every step echoing and reverberating in Draco’s ears. To his left, his mother stood in an almost protective stance, ready to defend her son at the drop of a hat. Draco felt comforted with this thought. He had always felt that his father had never really loved him; not as much as he loved power, money, or the Dark Lord, anyway. But his mother had always doted on him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco, my boy.” The Dark Lord’s voice was a hoarse, slimy wheeze. Draco inwardly cringed as a scaly, dry hand reached out and touched his face. “You have fought bravely for me, Draco. Perhaps there is something you would like in return?” He was so close now that Draco could see his reflection in those awful black eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco summoned his courage and all his remaining wits, determined not to let his voice shake. “No, my Lord. I can’t think of anything I require.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The black eyes narrowed coldly, as though a personal insult had been delivered. They pierced through Draco’s own eyes, as if seeing through his unwavering demeanour to the vulnerable, bitter heart beyond. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No matter.” The Dark Lord smiled thinly and spoke pointedly. “I have something that may be of interest to you. Perhaps,” he continued with an emotionless chuckle, “you might like to share it with...the others.” The pale white hand waved mockingly over the rows of Death Eaters gathered in the hall and a ripple of cruel laughter echoed. The Dark Lord took up position behind Draco and leered with sadistic glee over his shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Bring forth the gift.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Loud footsteps thudded through the hall. Draco felt himself catch his breath. The footsteps were slow and purposeful, as if the creator of them was making a point. And soon this was made clear. Antonin Dolohov entered the hall. In one hand, he held his wand, emitting blue electrical currents to continuously torture what he was holding in his other hand. A girl. As every current hit her, the shock tore through her body, making her convulse in agony. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dolohov dragged her by her hair all the way up the centre aisle created by the wave of Death Eaters parting like the Red Sea. He kept forcefully dragging her and simultaneously torturing her until he was nose to nose with Draco, at which point he slammed her into the cold, hard flagstone floor. She fell with a sickening thud. Draco flinched as he watched her head crack into the tiles. And then...nothing. The girl lay limp, unmoving, and to all appearances, dead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A foreboding whisper in his ear startled Draco back to reality. “She is yours to do with as you will. Antonin has already expressed his desire to...share her company again.” Draco felt the hairs on his arms and neck stand up as he felt the Dark Lord’s breath on his ear, and his stomach turned in horror as he processed the words. He forced a pleased smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I find myself undeserving of the honour of this gift, my lord, but I humbly accept it.” He hesitantly walked down the steps and stood over the girl. She was petite, with silvery blonde hair, but she had clearly been neglected and tortured. Her hair was matted and filled with dirt and blood, and her arms were covered in bruises, rope burns and knife cuts. Draco bent down and turned her over so he could see her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sharp audible gasp escaped his lips and he looked up and met the Dark Lord’s unfathomable gaze. “ My lord, I request permission to take her to my bedchamber. I think,” he continued, cringing inwardly at his next words, “that I should like to...enjoy her...myself for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A ripple of approving demonic laughter spread through the hall. Draco got a sick feeling in his stomach as he saw his own father smirk. The Dark Lord himself let out a mirthless chuckle. “It is yours. Do with it as you will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Draco wanted to say. </span>
  <em>
    <span>She is mine. Not it. </span>
  </em>
  <span>But he didn’t. He picked the girl up and carried her out of the hall, away from the monsters who had hurt and violated her. He felt a sudden protectiveness for the small, soft girl in his arms. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Rule number one, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he told himself. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t get attached.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Reaching the door of his bedroom, he kicked it open and entered, before pushing it shut behind him. Leaning against the heavy wooden door for a second, Draco slowed his breathing and closed his eyes. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Silence. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He carefully laid the girl out on his bed, gently propping her battered head on a soft pillow and covering her bruised and bloody body with a warm blanket. As she rested, he sat by her on the large bed. As he looked down at the unconscious girl, he rested his weary head in his hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t worry Luna, I won’t let them hurt you. I’ve got you.</span>
