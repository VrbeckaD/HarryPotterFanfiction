    <p>"Harry Potter," Dumbledore called. His voice was frayed, old, and broken. He had failed his people once more. "The tribute for this cycle is Harry Potter."</p><p>The village froze for all but a moment before bursting into a cacophony of noise. Outraged cries, quiet gasps of relief, and murmured words of condolences blended together. <em>'Thank goodness it wasn't me,'</em>  some thought. <em>'Thank goodness it wasn't my child.'</em><br/>
<br/>
Hermione sobbed, clutching Harry's hands in a crushing grip. Ron's gaze widened in horror, icy dread pooling in his lungs.</p><p>Harry's heart stuttered once, twice, before he finally caught his breath. He could protect them all, by going willingly. He could doom them all, by running away.</p><p>The choice wasn't difficult to make.</p>
<hr/><p>The village had a legend, you see. Every seven years, as the first rays of light would rise over the distant mountains, a great catastrophe would strike the land- in the shape of a typhoon, an immense earthquake, a disastrous drought- that would leave any and all life in ruins. Crops would rot, diseases would run rampant, and fresh water reserves would become poisoned. The people of the land fell into despair, at a loss for what to do. Distraught, a village elder, the wisest of their people, turned to nature itself to find a solution. <em>'A clearing within the Forbidden Forest,'</em>  they decided. <em>'The place where the barrier between realms is most thin.'  </em></p><p>The elder fell to the forest floor, coughing and wheezing as they struggled against the disease, the pain, the thirst.<em> 'I beseech you,'</em>  they called out. <em>'How can I save my people?'</em></p><p><em>'The answer is simple,'</em>  the forest called back. <em>'Present me with a soul worthy of all the lives that could be spared.'</em></p><p>The people became desperate, their anguish fueling their pain. How could they measure the worthiness of a soul? From their character, their talents, their experiences? No one wanted to die, nor could they bring themselves to encourage anyone else to step forward.</p><p><em>A fair decision,</em> they decided. Collecting the names of all those above the age of majority, the village elder picked a person at random. The tribute chosen was then told to walk to the clearing where the forest had first spoken, and the catastrophe would be put to an end.</p><p>The village grieved for the member they had lost, but as history has proven, life began anew. Hope, hope was now tangibly felt. They were free!</p><p>But seven years later, the catastrophe still took place.</p><p><em>'This was not our bargain,'</em>  the elder called out. <em>'A tribute was offered!'</em></p><p><em>'The answer is simple,'</em>  the forest called back once more. <em>'Present me with a soul worthy of all the lives that could be spared.'</em></p>
<hr/><p>Preparations were made as the grains of time continued to slip by.</p><p>A bath, to clear away impurities. A simple tunic, to show humility. A shroud, to protect the sacrifice.</p><p>
  <em>A lotus flower, to gift the forest for its kindness.</em>
</p><p>Glistening tears continued to slip past Hermione's cheeks as she anointed Harry's forehead, the soft skin behind his ears, the pulse points on each wrist. "Harry," Ron whispered, voice rough, cracking, from where he stood guard. "It's time."</p><p>Slowly, Harry stood. He had a minute, two at most, before the rules dictated his departure.</p><p>
  <em>'Alone, before the sky begins to change from black to deep blue, into the forest,' the forest said. 'There, I will await you.'</em>
</p><p>Despite everything, Harry's strongest emotion was that of relief. He would protect his people. For their smiles, for their futures, he would volunteer himself every time, in every life, if he could. A bittersweet, melancholic happiness spread through his veins as he turned to face Ron and Hermione. "I'll miss you," Harry whispered fiercely, risking a final embrace with his two closest friends despite the elder's warnings. "Be happy enough for my share, too."</p><p>Heart aching, but spirit ablaze, Harry walked. </p><p>
