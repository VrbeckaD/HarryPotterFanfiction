  <em>"DAILY PROPHET REPORTER MISSING!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CLAIMS "YOU-KNOW-WHO" IS BACK ONCE AGAIN!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"FUDGE TELLS PUBLIC ALL IS WELL"</em>
</p><p>"Hey Harry, it says here that Rita Skeeter is missing." Helena Snape said while reading the morning newspaper. "She is? Aw, that's a bummer. I really liked her articles." Harry said, the sarcasm dripping from his voice and his twin sister grinned. "He just will not give up, will he?" Remus Lupin asked, reading the newspaper over his goddaughter's shoulder and indicating the article about Dumbledore.</p><p>"No, but all the better for us. Let them focus on the old idiot while we secretly infiltrate the ministry. How's that going anyway?" Harry asked. "Several unspeakables of the Department of Mysteries are already on our side after one of us went to talk to them. They hate what Dumbledore is doing to magic by only trying to allow light magic to be used. There has to be a balance, otherwise, everything goes to hell." His godfather, Sirius Black answered, before looking up at hearing Remus suddenly let out a strangled sound. "Moony? What is it?" He asked in concern, walking towards him. </p><p>Remus lifted the newspaper out of Helena's hands and showed his boyfriend the article he had seen. "<em>FENRIR GREYBACK FOUND DEAD IN MUGGLE GRAVEYARD!"</em> The article's title read. "Oh Remus." Sirius whispered, wrapping his arm around the man. "He's.... gone." Remus breathed, before starting to laugh as he realised the monster that had bitten and turned him, was finally dead. Both Sirius and the twins hugged the man as tears of relief rolled down his cheeks.</p><p>This was what Severus walked in on. "Did I miss anything?" He asked after a few seconds. "Greyback is dead." Harry said, his voice muffled from where his face was smushed between his uncle and Severus immediately smiled in answer. "That explains it, but we really have to go. Ragnok expects us in ten minutes." He said.The twins nodded and pulled themselves from the hug with effort and followed him out after saying goodbye to their uncles. </p><p>A few minutes later, the Snape family was at Gringotts, meeting with Ragnok and Lucius Malfoy, who was their proxy in the Wizengamot. Their (forced) participation to the Triwizard Tournament last year had emancipated the twins, meaning that they could take up their lordship and ladyship rings. Apart from the Liesmith ring, who would only accept Helena at seventeen. Lucius would still stay their proxy for now, but they could take up their seats anytime. Ragnok congratulated them as their rings accepted them. "Now that we're here, have you thought of another motion for the next meeting?" Lucius asked. </p><p>"I have one: a magical orphanage for abused children. We all know what our relatives tried to do. How many other guardians do you think try to do the same? How many catholic parents think their muggleborn child is possessed by the devil and try to "drive him out", possibly killing the child in the process or worse: force the child to suppress their powers. We know what happens with those children. They don't live past the age of ten." She said seriously</p><p>Everyone fell silent, never having thought of that. "There are some small vaults for children of school age, who never came back to collect it." Ragnok said solemnly and Severus put his hands on his children's shoulders and they both covered his hands with their own. "We really need something like that." Lucius murmured. The meeting quickly wrapped up after that, but not before the twins donated their prize money and some more to a new vault. </p><p>A few days later, three Weasleys were nervously sitting in two different rooms. Fred and George were in their best robes as they waited in another office. The day before, they had gotten a letter from the goblins to meet with them. They had no idea why, but they would soon find out as a goblin walked in. "Good morning, Mr and Mr. Weasley. I am Gnartooth, your newly appointed vault manager." He said, really confusing the twins. "I'm really sorry sir, but we don't have a vault. Apart from our family vault." George spoke up hesitantly. </p><p>Gnartooth gave them a vicious grin. "Until a few days ago, that was true, but one of our other clients opened a vault in your name and put two thousand galleons in it." He told them and both twins felt their jaw drop. Their dreams of opening a joke shop suddenly became a lot more realistic. "Who on earth would donate so much money to us?" Fred asked. "The client only told me to tell you to make the Marauders proud." Gnartooth told them. </p><p>Fred and George immediately shared a look, now knowing exactly who had donated the money. "Harry and Helena. Are they insane? Can they miss so much money?" They asked. "I'm sure that the lord Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell-Emerys and the lady Ravenclaw-Hufflepuf-Le Fay will be able to miss some money." Gnartooth answered, having gotten permission to reveal that little tidbit and Fred and George could feel their jaws fall even more.</p><p>"I'm sorry sir. Could you repeat those titles." George asked and Gnartooth grinned. In another part of Gringotts, a nervous Bill Weasley was sitting with his boss another goblin named Boldjaw. The goblin had written to him that they had possibly found his soulmate and that she wanted to meet him, hence the nerves. There was a knock on the door and another goblin walked in with four people following. One of them was the most beautiful young woman he had ever seen. He politely stood up and held out his hand, introducing himself.</p><p>The older man and woman went first, looking him up and down critically. Knowing that this could possibly be a very important meeting, Bill had done his best to make himself at least a bit more presentable, although he had refused to cut his hair. It wasn't until the oldest daughter gave him her hand to introduce herself that his mark warmed up and glowed a bit. The girl immediately beamed at him.</p><p>"They were right. You really are my soulmate." She said, a French accent clear in her voice. "Uhm, they?" Bill asked nervously. "Harry and Helena Snape. They recognised my mark from when they met you." Fleur told him, before the youngest girl introduced herself. They were allowed to leave and walked out of the bank. As he slowly got to know his soulmate, Bill reminded himself to thank the twins next time he saw them. </p><p>Back at Peverell manor, Severus, Sirius and Remus were reluctantly preparing themselves. They had gotten an "invitation" (order) to meet with Dumbledore and the "old crowd," meaning the order of the Phoenix. They had sighed at the old fool's stubbornness, but at least they could use this to spy on Dumbledore for Tom and give the old man absolutely rubbish news about the "dark lord". Harry and Helena were safely at the Malfoys as the three men still didn't want them completely alone at the manor, even if Winky, Dobby and Kreacher would keep an eye out on them</p><p>"Great, now we have to deal with all of those idiots in the same room. I'd rather go back to Azkaban." Sirius muttered darkly, before stepping into the floo and disappearing. They had decided to enter at different times as almost no one knew that they lived in the same house. Remus soon followed and Severus called Winky. "Call me if anything happens, understood?" He asked and she nodded. He nodded back, before disappearing as well.</p>
