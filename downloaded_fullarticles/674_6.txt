  <em>Saturday, September 12, 1992</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>        Slytherin Common Room</em>
</p>
<p>Eden yawned sleepily and curled into Monty’s side as he continued to run his fingers through her hair.</p>
<p>He had long since tugged it out of the complex Viking braid updo she had it in, and she was nearly purring as his calloused fingers rubbed against her scalp and her silky black hair. Her tense muscles relaxed further when his short nails scraped her scalp and purred and curled closer to him.</p>
<p>Monty laughed at one of the fights going on in front of the large fireplace—the one he laughed at, and she watched was right in front of them. Draco plopped onto the couch next to her and forced his head onto her thighs, uncaring of the way her legs were curled under her. As he pulled out a book, she began to run her fingers through his gelled hair—she used one of the spells that one of the one too many books that Narcissa had bought her to keep it from sticking to her fingers.</p>
<p>“Merlin, you are such a <strong>sadist</strong>, Marcus,” Anna-Maria Jynx snarled after he shot some curse she didn’t recognize at her. Eden’s eyes opened and she sat up slightly at the <strong>new word</strong>.</p>
<p>“At least I’m not a submissive <strong>masochist</strong>,” the sixth year returned, “I mean, come on love, just admit it already. Everyone knows that you <em>are</em> a <strong>masochist</strong>.”</p>
<p>She pulled completely out of Monty’s embrace, and attention was brought to the duo as he tried to get her back. “Little Eden, <em>come on</em>! I was having <em>fun</em>!” he griped.</p>
<p>“What does ‘<strong>sadist</strong>’ and ‘<strong>masochist</strong>’ mean?” she demanded instead.</p>
<p>Marcus choked along with Anna-Maria, Julia Morginnson, Antony Selwyn, Orion Frost, Dillon Willoson, Athania Thornton, Ursula Kobe, and Echo Rathmore. “What? Why would you ask that?”</p>
<p>“You called her a <strong>masochist</strong>, and she called you a <strong>sadist</strong>. What do those words mean?” Her lips were pulled into an adorable pout as her left brow was furrowed—which only added to the cuteness. When no one answered, she repeated the question.</p>
<p>“Little Eden,” Echo started, “you don’t need to know what they mean.”</p>
<p>She pouted even more. “What do they mean?”</p>
<p>Ursula tried her hand at dissuading her. “You’re too young to know.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not. If I were too young for it, you guys wouldn’t say it around first and second years. What. Do. They. Mean?”</p>
<p>Draco, Pansy, Daphne, Blaise, Millicent, Theo, Tracy, Gregory, Vincent, Ambrosia, Evanius, Blaire, Septimus, and Janice joined in on the begging until the sixth and seventh years finally relented.</p>
<p>“Alright, <em>fine</em>! You mangy <em>mutts</em>,” Marcus hissed. The second years just laughed at the insult because they all saw the affection in the words. “A <strong>sadist</strong>…is someone who…uh…”</p>
<p>“Likes…” Athania took over, “uhm…they like to uh…”</p>
<p>“They like to cause…uh…<em>pain</em> to people.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Let’s go with that! A <strong>sadist</strong> likes to inflict pain upon others. Just pain. Nothing else. <em>Definitely</em> nothing else.”</p>
<p>The second years narrowed their eyes at them before they reluctantly accepted the definition. “And <strong>masochist</strong>? What does that mean?”</p>
<p>The older students got together into a small circle and whispered amongst themselves for five minutes before they agreed on something. “A <strong>masochist</strong> is someone who finds…gratification…in pain.”</p>
<p>Something clicked in Eden’s head from something Sirius had said once. “Oh! Like, no pain, no gain?”</p>
<p>They all exchanged looks before they shrugged. “Yes. Exactly like that. Just that way, alright?”</p>
<p>Eden was confused as to why they looked so relieved that she had accepted that definition and even offered her own take on it.</p>
<p>She shrugged and forgot about it.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Until that night as she waited to go to Tom.</p>
<p>Was it possible to be something <em>other</em> than a sadist or a masochist?</p>
<p>She didn’t think she was either one.</p><hr/>

  <em>        Slytherin Common Room</em>
</p>
<p>“Hey, Marcus?”</p>
<p>The sixth year turned from his conversation about Quidditch—gag—and pulled her onto his lap, much to her consternation. “What’s up, Little Eden?”</p>
<p>Anna-Mariea started to run her fingers through her curled hair and she purred slightly, but she would <em>not</em> be deterred from her quest. “I have a question.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re in luck, I happen to have an answer.”</p>
<p>She smiled. “Is there something between a sadist and a masochist? I don’t think I’m either.”</p>
<p>He choked along with the other students around her—they were all sixth and seventh years, as the younger years seemed eager to hear the answer as well.</p>
<p>“We should have obliviated you instead of humoring you,” he groaned.</p>
<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Something you are <em>far</em> too young to know.”</p>
<p>She scowled, and before she could say anything, a fifth year who didn’t mind telling her things piped up. “It’s called <strong>sadomasochism</strong>.”</p>
<p>Great. A <strong>new word</strong>. Again.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>“What does that mean, Selwyn?”</p>
<p>“It means you like causing pain, and you like being in pain.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>She wasn’t that either.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
