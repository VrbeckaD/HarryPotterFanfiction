<p>&gt; Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a boy and a girl. The boy was timid and shy. The girl was spontaneous and strong. They were siblings, close ones, they went almost every where together. They lived in a home with their parents. They were happy.</p>
<p>&gt; <strike>Until...</strike></p>
<p>&gt; Their parents sent them away. It was necessary to help them, so the parents said. The children were not happy to spend a summer with their great uncle. On a hot summer day, they arrived at their great uncle's home, though it was more like a shack than anything else. A shack in the midst of a great woods. They hung around their great uncle and his associates. The boy developed a crush. The girl fell in love multiple times.</p>
<p>&gt; <strike>They were happy.</strike></p>
<p><strike></strike>&gt; That changed the day the boy found the book covered in dust and age. It was uncertain to know how long it had been there, but the boy took it anyway. It was mysterious, but he took it. The pages were heavy with ink depicting pictures of mythical creatures evil and good alike. It was a book that the boy grew to love and protect. It was his, and he was its. They're destiny was forever enter twined, tangling and curving in a way that was not clear at first.</p>
<p>&gt; When he read the book, the boy felt powerful. He had knowledge beyond his wildest dreams. With the book he began to explore the odd happenings of his town. With his sister by his side, he explored, jotting down his own notes as he went. He loved it. She loved it. The siblings had fun.</p>
<p>&gt; And then the world became dangerous. A child psychic was on the loose. There were monsters in the water. Crazy genius roamed the streets. Dinosaurs were coming back. A portal was around. A great uncle was lying.</p>
<p>&gt; A sinister triangle was coming for the siblings.</p>
<p>&gt; <strike>It was B*^^.</strike></p>
<p>&gt; <strike>He was on his way.</strike></p>
<p>&gt; <strike><strong>And out for blood.</strong> </strike></p>

<p>&gt; There was nothing the siblings could do to stop it from happening. The FBI was on their trail, and they had no where to go. Their great uncle was under arrest. So, they did what anyone would do. They worked non-stop to prove their great uncle's innocence.</p>
<p>&gt; <strike>It was a waste of time.</strike></p>
<p>&gt; Their great uncle was guilty, and there was nothing they could do about it.</p>
<p>&gt; That night, a portal changed the twins world forever. The boy tried to stop it. The question mark tried to protect them. The great uncle tried to keep the portal. The girl made a choice. It was the hardest choice she ever had to make.</p>
<p>&gt;The portal opened.</p>
<p>&gt;The man escaped.</p>
<p>&gt; The world turned upside down.</p>
<p>&gt; And it was okay.</p>
<p>&gt; The great uncle's brother was back. The six-fingered man. He was there once more. It was sad, how happy they were.</p>
<p>&gt; <strike>The worst was yet to come.</strike></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt; Weeks passed, and the boy became close with the six-fingered man. The six-fingered man offered a apprenticeship. The boy accepted on the spot. It was a relationship unlike any other. And they were happy.</p>
<p>&gt; The girl was not. She was angry. She began to loathe the six-fingered man. She wished he would go away and never come back. She wished her brother would come back to her. She wished she didn't need him. She wished everything would go back to normal. She wished, and she got.</p>
<p>&gt; With the girl in his clutches, the triangle took over. It wasn't hard. With the globe out of the way, he could bring his friends, and together they could rule the earth.</p>
<p>&gt; But.</p>
<p>&gt; There was a barrier.</p>
<p>&gt; And this angered the triangle.</p>
<p>&gt; He wanted to leave.</p>
<p>&gt; He wanted to rule.</p>
<p>&gt; He wanted, and he stole.</p>
<p>&gt; He abducted the six-fingered man.</p>
<p>&gt; It wasn't hard. What little resistance there was, was quickly dying out.</p>
<p>&gt; Soon, it would die.</p>
<p>&gt; <strike>Or not.</strike></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt; The boy would not give up.</p>
<p>&gt; Weirdmagedden would not stop him.</p>
<p>&gt; He would not break.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt; The glasses, the broken heart, the shooting star, the llama, the six-fingered hand, the star, the pine tree, the ice, the question mark.</p>
<p>&gt; They are united.</p>
<p>&gt; They can win.</p>
<p>&gt; They are ready.</p>
<p>&gt; But they are missing one. The mark of the great uncle.</p>
<p>&gt; <strike>They fail.</strike></p>
<p>&gt; <strike>They fall. </strike></p>
<p>&gt; <strike>They loose. </strike></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt; The greatest sacrifice of all.</p>
<p>&gt; The only way to win.</p>
<p>&gt;The worst mistake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt; Whiteness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt; A battle won.</p>
<p>&gt; A friend lost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt; And then regained...?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt; <strike>And with the friend, comes an enemy. </strike></p>
<p>&gt; <strike>But that is another file entirely. </strike></p>
