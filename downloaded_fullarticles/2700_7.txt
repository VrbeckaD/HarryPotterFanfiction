  <b> The Drive </b>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>The hottest day of summer so far was just heating up. Privet Drive had seldom looked so discolored. Its usually polished, spotless cars were dusty from the lack of washing. The flowerbeds were wilting. A drought caused a ban on housepipes and the ban was scheduled through the end of summer. Windows had been opened to catch a nonexistent breeze and people had shuttered themselves inside. There was just one person outside; a teenage girl, who sat on the doorstep of Number Four Privet Drive with her trunk. [B5, 1]<br/>The girl had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who grew a lot very quickly (B5, 1). Her messy black hair was stuffed through a black baseball cap with a silhouetted wolf and a crescent moon embroidered on it. She worn a knee-high, navy dress with a lace back, and a black jacket with several pockets and a very stiff front. The back of her jacket had the same silhouette as her baseball cap. Around her bright green eyes, her midnight blue eyeliner was smudged into her eyeshadow, in an attempt to blend them. Siria Potter-Black looked to her watch, then her phone, then back to her laptop screen.<br/>She sighed and continued to type away into the spreadsheet on the screen. Siria stole glances to her watch, which was not like a usual watch. The silver watch had three hands, but the second hand was frozen in place. It was also the most decorated part of the watch. While the watch itself was a simple silver band with a plain face, someone had detailed the thin, second hand to look like a rune covered wand. Siria sighed at the hand, frozen at five o’clock.<br/>	Number Four’s front door creaked open. Dudley Dursley, Siria’s cousin, snuck onto the front porch. Like his father, Dudley was a vast, red faced boy of very little neck. He had his mother’s blonde hair and height. As Uncle Vernon boasted to everyone, Dudley had earned the title of Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of the Southeast (B5, 11). Though Dudley wrote Siria to tell her he earned the title, he said very little else of his boxing.<br/>	“Are you really leaving?” Dudley asked as he slumped down to sit on the step of the porch. Siria closed her laptop and rested a hand on it.<br/>“You’ve been cool this summer, but I really need to go,” said Siria.<br/>“But he’s late, your dad,” said Dudley.<br/>“He’s on his way.”<br/>“Don’t you want to wait inside?”<br/>“Not with your mum glaring at me.”<br/>“She won’t glare if I sit with you. We—we could even watch the news,” he said. Dudley hated the news, but Siria wanted to watch every day since summer started. <br/>	Siria picked at the dirt beneath her glittering green nails. She clicked her tongue at her nails then looked over the rim of her glasses, to her cousin. “Big D, I’m not safe here and my friends aren’t safe without me,” said Siria. “Voldemort is back and he’s going to come after me again.”<br/>“I thought your dad said you were safe here,” said Dudley.<br/>“As in inside,” Siria pointed over her shoulder, to the mahogany door of Number Four. “I don’t want to live inside my trunk for the rest of summer with rubbish letters like ‘wish I could tell you’ and ‘loads going on’ and ‘see you soon’, but not news on when that is.” Siria leaned forward, careful to hold her laptop tighter.<br/>	“Dudley, I’m going mad and I mean both angry and crazy,” Siria confessed. She pressed the nails of one hand into her scalp as she closed her eyes. Siria shuddered while she pulled herself back together. “Hermione,” Siria whispered to herself, “Ron, Transfiguration, Kreacher, Colin, Dennis,” with each name her heart and mind steadied until her breath was calm.<br/>	“Is that why you keep making stuff shake?” Dudley asked. Siria slid off her trunk to sit beside her cousin. She leaned her head on his shoulder and muttered her reply. “Can your dad help though?”<br/>“I don’t know, but I know being here isn’t,” she confessed. “For what it’s worth, I’ll send you extra fudge for Christmas.”<br/>“From that Honeydukes place?”<br/>“Yeah. Sure they’ve got a menu or something so you can order what you actually want.”<br/>“That giadia stuff was good,” said Dudley. She opened her mouth to correct him with “Gianduia”, but realized the name wasn’t important. Siria nodded.<br/>	A very flashy, red coloured Austin Healey Sprite rounded the corner of Privet Drive and Siria’s face lit. She opened her trunk, orange point of its star up, and pulled out a messenger bag, which she stuffed the laptop into. Siria positively beamed as Sirius pulled up. Dudley picked up her trunk when Siria reached for it. He shrugged and headed to the car.<br/>	“Don’t you look happy,” Sirius said to Dudley with a smile. Sirius opened up the boot of the car and Dudley placed Siria’s trunk inside. Dudley extended his hand to Siria.<br/>“See you, cousin,” said Dudley. Siria smiled at him and opened her arms for a hug. She shrugged.<br/>“Even Mrs. Nosey Number Three’s not looking,” said Siria. Dudley hugged Siria, however short and awkward it was. “See you next summer,” Siria opened the passenger door.<br/>“Talk to you sooner, since you got that phone, an’ all.”<br/>“Maybe you could visit in London,” said Sirius. Dudley and Siria looked to him in shared surprise. Sirius shrugged. “Just remember, if you ever bully my daughter I’ll make you trip up every set of stairs you touch for the rest of your life,” and Sirius closed the driver’s door.<br/>“He’s joking... maybe,” Siria eyed her father, but waved to her cousin, and settled into the car with her bag.<br/>	“Nice of him to see you off,” Sirius smiled as they pulled off of Privet Drive. Siria shook her head.<br/>“Don’t think you’re getting off being late,” she snapped. “I’d half a mind to just take the Knight Bus after all. You didn’t even call.” Siria pulled her laptop from her bag and resumed her spreadsheet.<br/>“Siria, there’s a lot going on,” said Sirius. “Once you get home, you’ll see what I mean.”<br/>“You’re not going to tell me?”<br/>“What do you want to hear?”<br/>“Everything, but, first: how is everyone?”<br/>“Everyone?” Sirius asked.<br/>“Don’t be coy. I know who all is there,” she said “but I want details and to know why Colin and Dennis got there before me.”<br/>	Sirius sighed, but his smile told Siria he was prepared for as much. “Once Barbara learned what happened before, she and Eric decided that the boys would be safer with us, learning all they could, than with two Muggles,” Sirius explained. “Don’t worry. Colin and Dennis haven’t learned anything you haven’t. They’re still working on Shield Charms. I was going to start them on Helping Hands, but someone,” he shot Siria a sideways glance with a smile, “already had them go over them.”<br/>“You can never have enough Healers, isn’t that what you told me?” Siria raised an eyebrow. “So that’s the Creevey Brothers, what about Alice?”<br/>	The color drained from Sirius’s already pale face. Siria had debated saving Alice Travers for last, but needed to know. Alice Travers was a Slytherin seventh year who excelled at Charms, could lighten almost any mood as the Weasley twins did, and whose father joined Voldemort just before summer started. She returned home only to learn that her father had taken the Dark Mark the day before, at the advice of his cousin, Lucius Malfoy. None of Siria’s letters gave specifics, but Alice ran away and was taken in by Cassius Warrington and his family.<br/>	“She’s put on a brave face,” said Sirius after a moment of silence.<br/>“So she’s miserable?” Siria asked, though she didn’t know why.<br/>“Rightfully so,” Sirius drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. “Cassius is doing well though. He’s been fighting for you to come since day one— of course I have too,” Sirius said at the expression on her face. “Dumbledore seems convinced information is on a ‘need-to-know’ and you should only know what is absolutely necessary.” Sirius rolled his eyes, which told Siria he didn’t agree.<br/>	“Albus Dumbledore is the greatest wizard of our time,” Siria quoted with a smile, which she let fall the moment she was done. Dumbledore was Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Siria attended. He was also held in high esteem for his contributions to the wizarding community, though some did not agree with his views on half breeds or Muggleborns, which was that they deserved the same opportunities and education as other wizards. There was no doubt that Siria and Sirius agreed with Dumbledore on many of his stances, but neither agreed with keeping Siria in the dark.<br/>	“Has he done the same for Cassius?” Siria asked.<br/>“Yes. He doesn’t even allow Cassius in meetings, though Willow and William don’t agree with keeping him out,” said Sirius.<br/>“Who?”<br/>“Willow and William— the Warringtons,” said Sirius.<br/>“Willow and William Warrington? And then Cassius?” Siria sighed.<br/>“It gets better, Willow Olivia Warrington and William Oliver Warrington. You don’t marry someone for their last name, you marry because you love them,” Sirius shrugged, “or you want a tax break or something.”<br/>“I guess I’d rather be ‘wow’ than ‘sob’,” confessed Siria.<br/>“Excuse me, Siria Jessica Potter-Black, not all of us get all consonants for our name.”<br/>	“Anyways, who else isn’t getting into meetings?” Siria asked.<br/>“Anyone still in school,” answered Sirius. “Chloe’s been ripping out her hair with all the interns she got thrown on her. It would be one thing if people knew what they were doing, but the Creeveys and Hermione are the only ones that have seen a computer before.”<br/>“How is Hermione?” Siria asked.<br/>“Missing you terribly.”<br/>“And Ron?” Siria asked and slowed down on the keys of her laptop.<br/>“Eager for your return.”<br/>“Hagrid?” she asked and didn’t notice she stopped typing.<br/>“Still on secret, official business,” said Sirius. Siria tsked and resumed her spreadsheet.<br/>	“Really though, what is happening?” Siria asked. She opened up a new document to type in whatever he told her. Sirius sighed.<br/>“Even if I tell you, you’re not allowed in the Order, alright?” Sirius instructed. Siria nodded. She spent the rest of the drive typing up any and all information Sirius offered her. Siria couldn’t afford to forget something and not tell the others. <br/>Voldemort, who tried to kill Siria in his family graveyard not even three weeks ago, had not surfaced since. The Order of the Phoenix had been recruiting allies and members where they could. Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, continued to deny what happened in the graveyard; he’s put pressure on the Daily Prophet to paint Siria in the worst light they can. Though Fudge’s real fear is that Dumbledore wants to be the Minister of Magic. Siria opened her mouth to point out that Dumbledore doesn’t want to be Minister, but knew that Sirius knew just as well as she did. Dumbledore has continued to try and put the word of Voldemort’s return out, with much resistance. [B5, 91-95]<br/>“So,” said Siria, “part of me understands that Fudge is scared and scared people can do stupid things, but hasn’t Lumos done anything to stop it? Like, the Daily Prophet has free competition saying something completely different, and people don’t believe it?”<br/>“Oh, people do believe it,” Sirius assured her. “Hermione got your interviews out so quickly, the Daily Prophet had to scramble to form an argument. It just isn’t enough though. The Daily Prophet’s been established for a long time, then this flyer— I’m sorry, my dear,” Sirius said at the look on Siria’s face “it’s on nice paper, but it’s a flyer—then this flyer shows up out of nowhere, to almost everyone.”<br/>	Sirius sighed. He reached over and placed a hand on Siria’s head, to pat her hair for a moment. “People will believe what they want to and some people just aren’t ready to believe it,” he confessed. “The Stargazers assured you’d at least have a lot of Hogwarts behind you, but the Minister of Magic does have some influence.”<br/>	He continued to tell her about some of the new Order members, many of who were knew to Siria, but he assured her that she’d meet them someday. Sirius went on to tell her that, aside from gaining followers, Voldemort is trying to gain something more. “It’s something like a weapon,” said Sirius [B5, 95-96]<br/>	“Like a weapon?” Siria asked and paused her typing. “What? Does he have a death ray?” She let out a small laugh. Sirius’s lips forced a thin smile.<br/>“Even Voldemort knows there are some things more valuable than being able to murder,” said Sirius. Siria made a note on the document of “better than a death ray”. “That’s all I can say, though.”<br/>“Do we have it? The ‘like a weapon’?” Siria asked.<br/>“We’re guarding it,” said Sirius. “That’s really all though.” Siria hummed as she wondered.<br/>	Sirius parked in front of a tall, glass building that glared back at them with the heat of the summer sun. Siria shook her head. “I thought we were going home!” She said.<br/>“Everyone else is here. Don’t you want to see Cassius fight with the printer?” Sirius asked as he opened his door.<br/>“Not really,” Siria sang in reply.<br/>“Come on, Chloe hasn’t seen you all summer,” Sirius ducked his head into the car.<br/>“That’s a whole week an’ a half.”<br/>“Don’t punish others just because you were wrongfully imprisoned for an extra three days.”<br/>“It was only three because I wrote you that I’d get home with or without you!”<br/>“Stubborn like you mother,” he told her.<br/>“Like all of my parents!” Siria shouted back. “You ought to be proud.” Sirius rested his head on his arm, on the car door frame.<br/>“Why are we fighting?” He asked.<br/>“I don’t know!” Siria shouted. “I’m so mad— I’m furious.”<br/>“It’s the heat,” Sirius reasoned. “Let’s go inside, where there’s air conditioning and most of your friends.”<br/>	Siria pressed her face deep into her hands, beneath her glasses and screamed. She pulled at her face. “Hermione, Ron, Colin, Dennis, George, Fred, Transfiguration…” Siria listed silently. She stepped out and slammed the car door, which she shouted at. “I’m trying!” She snapped at Sirius.<br/>“I know,” Sirius placed an arm around her shoulders and they walked into Moony &amp; Padfoot headquarters together.<br/>	“Good afternoon Mr. Black!” A harassed looking woman forced a smile at them. Colin Creevey bolted from behind her desk to hug Siria around the waist. He launched into a monologue of his week and a half without her so quickly no one could stop him. In a single breath, he explained being shuffled from department to department before he ended up at the front desk.<br/>	“Isn’t Colin a little young to be working?” Siria asked as she stepped into the elevator with Sirius. He shrugged.<br/>“Not sure the logistics, but Chloe’s ex’s sister got us the permits… or him the permit. Dennis is modeling, if you can believe that,” said Sirius. Siria tilted her head while she tossed around the image of Dennis modeling. She supposed he was cute in the way Astoria was. They stepped out of the elevator and onto the cracked ice painted floor. Siria held onto Sirius’s arm while they crossed to the office.<br/>	“Finally!” Chloe barked and grabbed Siria by the arm. “I understand you are intent to hire Siria’s entire school,” Chloe bellowed at Sirius, “but at least teach them all their colors before you send one to help me.” She dragged Siria along. Chloe looked to Ron. “Sweetie, you’re so painfully awkward that it is both endearing and too close to the heart, please help Gred or Forge—” Chloe let out a short scream, “you know your brothers’ names, just,” and she pointed to the door.<br/>“Catch up soon,” Ron mouthed then he sprinted out of the room.<br/>Chloe took Siria’s face in her hands and sighed. She put her head on Siria’s shoulder. “Which is chartreuse?” Chloe asked as she let go. Her eyes were caked in makeup to hide the bags beneath them. Siria side stepped over to a bolt of fabric and raised it. “That’s the easy test.” For the next half hour, Siria lifted or pointed to bolt after bolt of fabric until Chloe plopped down on a pile of bolts. “Thank you,” Chloe whispered. “There is a greater power and it doesn’t want your father dead after all,” she sighed. “Honestly, Siria, if he hadn’t taught at least you colors I would have murdered him.” Chloe draped her arm over her eyes. Take a break… be back,” she looked to her watch then dropped her arm back down, “eventually.”<br/>Siria slipped out of the room before Chloe could change her mind. She paused over the painted floor. Her first instinct was to call someone to walk her across, but she knew it was silly. Siria closed her eyes and dashed into the doors of the elevator. When it dinged she was pleased to see the bushy brown hair of Hermione Granger. The girls threw their arms around the other and laughed as they hugged. Hermione’s hug was warm, long, and felt comfortable.</p>
