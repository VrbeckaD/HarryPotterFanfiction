  <em>You come to this place of wonder, of magic.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>You come here to learn, to grow.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>You come here as a child first, and it’s accepted you’ll leave as an adult.</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>Here’s the weird bit, though; you’re put into a house and you </em>can<em> choose it.</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>Not everyone chooses and not everyone argues, but you can.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>The possibility is there.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>So what about the Hufflepuffs of Hogwarts; where do they fit in?</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>They are kind beings, not noble – that’s a Gryffindor trait.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>They are unafraid of toil; hard working.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>They are loyal.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Except, no one ever sees – you are more than this.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Hufflepuff is more than your cast offs, your spares.</em>
</p><p>If you get into Hufflepuff, it isn’t because you’re not intelligent, not brave, not ambitious. There are a host of reasons, numerous and as various as the owners of such opinions. Your reason, <em>your</em> reason and not anyone else’s, is because you think about being intelligent, about being brave, about being ambitious and you think, yeah, that would be nice, except you <em>could be better</em>. It’s not ambition with striving towards a goal and forever focussed. It’s not intelligence because you aren’t tracking a path to reach a goal. It’s not bravery because you’re not fighting fear to succeed.</p><p>It’s damn hard work, it’s being unafraid of toil. It’s building yourself up from the ground. It’s holding on by the tips of your fingernails and not letting go. It’s a refusal to give in, it’s a refusal to give up. You want a tale about Hufflepuffs? You want to see them scorned – well, no. You stand up for what’s right here, don’t you? Who cares what everyone else says about you and your house – here you have a family, you have a home, you have people who care, and a good environment.</p><p>If I’m to be honest with you, Hufflepuff is probably where you’re safest. Hard working doesn’t mean hard work put in. Unafraid of toil doesn’t mean being brave about your work. It’s not… It’s not like the other houses, not Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is different because they know the meaning of <em>work</em> and like Ravenclaw, when they commit <em>they commit</em>. Hufflepuff is different because being unafraid doesn’t mean bravery, it just means you’ll do it, and maybe that’s like Gryffindor. Hufflepuff is different because when they want something they stick their heels into the ground and <em>dare</em> you to make them move, and maybe that’s somewhat like Slytherin.</p><p>The point is that Hufflepuff is like every other house – it is made up of a multitude of witches and wizards, and they are all different. The point is that Hufflepuff is unlike every other house because it is a home before anything else.</p><p align="center">
  <em>They give your house a badger for an animal.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>A badger, and then they dare think it equates to sweetness, to kindness.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Do they know what a badger is?</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Badgers are carnivorous animals, are underestimated.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Like us, really. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>The thing is, they live quietly until attacked, and that’s when you run like hell.</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>See, badgers can fight off </em>wolves<em>, can fight off bigger animals.</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>So get off your high horse with your eagles and their renown.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Forget about your claws and hearty roars with your lions.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Ignore your stealth with your snakes and their poison.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Remember this instead: badgers are dangerous.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Honestly, creatures that have bright colours – like white – are the most dangerous.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>No one shouldn’t forget that. You don’t want to live to regret it.</em>
</p><p>You make it through one year, you learn and you learn. You can use your wand now, barely, but you can use it. You can think of a few spells quickly enough, and you’ve got a fair hand at the shield charm. You still aren’t important to the greater world, though. That’s alright though – you don’t want to be the world’s hero. Leave that for people like Harry Potter who are superhuman and defy death.</p><p>You’ve got your friends and your role models. You have a small world clad in yellow and black. You have a cosy home and a kitchen nearby. You have laughter and you have smiles <em>and you get help</em>. See, that’s what some of the other houses forget, it’s what teachers forget – not everyone learns the same way. You have people who teach you and they try different ways until you get it. You figure out the way you learn best and you adapt.</p><p>You learn of hauntings and petrification and you go, <em>alright</em>, and then you look to your prefects and they organise a buddy-system so that no one remains alone. You wander in groups from the beginning. You move together because family looks after family.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Look, Hufflepuff may be about family, and even family argues.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>That’s not the problem, because family here is a badger watching over her young.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Family here is protective, is dangerous, is steady, is loyal.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>The problem with Hufflepuff isn’t about being in Hufflepuff – you’re proud of your house.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>The problem with being in Hufflepuff is that Hogwarts is built on stereotypes.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Stereotypes are lies, twisted and warped. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>You get as good as you are going to be and they still laugh because you are a Puff, a duffer.</em>
</p><p>You know the traits of Hufflepuff, you know their names and the twisted way they become insults. The insults don’t flow off your back, don’t drip off like water – because words hurt. You can turn to friends and take comfort, but it hurts regardless. You can’t strike out because you aren’t meant to injure, to harm. You are patience, you are fair play, you are loyalty, you are tolerance.</p><p>The thing is, people put the traits in a way so that they don’t look dangerous. You put ambition beside cunning and suddenly Slytherins seem dangerous. You underline intelligence and place it by itself and then Ravenclaws are backstabbers. You order bravery above chivalry and Gryffindors are either arrogant or heroes. You put hard work above fair play and every Hufflepuff is nice.</p><p>Let’s change the order, though. Let’s group dedication and patience; let’s make that <em>danger</em>. Let’s remember that tolerance has a limit – let’s think about hard work and dedication and that <em>waiting pays off</em>. You think Hufflepuffs aren’t dangerous? You’re in for a hell of a surprise. You see, Hufflepuffs are just more tolerant. That doesn’t mean they aren’t dangerous.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Insult and lie to us; it doesn’t change us.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>These things hurt but you eventually grow past them.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>You learn to grow a coat of fur, a coat of armour.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>You make it, sometimes, you put on your make-up, and it puts up a shield.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Magic is wonderful, yes, but it can make people more judgemental.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Or maybe that’s society, but we are all part of society.</em>
</p><p>Come Triwizard Tournament, and then everyone pays attention to Hufflepuff. A champion, <em>your champion</em>, is a Hufflepuff. We do not forget all your insults, your harsh words. We are fair play and this is fair. Moreover, because we are human and flawed, this is us showing that <em>we are better. </em>We are the chosen ones here. It’s not that we are quick to forget or forgive; it is that we have the chance to show off.</p><p>We don’t forget what you’ve said and we don’t forget what you’ve done. Except, we’ve grown past it – have you? We give you a champion, we give you our best – and then you chuck Harry Potter in, illegally. The boy-who-lived is the hero of the world, and Gryffindor refuses to allow Hufflepuff a moment of fame, a moment of life.</p><p>You’ve ignored our heroes and you… you end up taking this one from us too. You mention him, give us a few lines, you call him loyal, fair, hard working. And then he’s taken from us, made a martyr, made a reason for a cause. You make him your reason to speak about Voldemort.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Bravery wasn’t Hufflepuff.</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>Don’t make Cedric Diggory your figurehead, your symbol, your </em>hero<em>, your bravery.</em></p><p align="center">
  <em>Don’t make him into a Gryffindor-Hufflepuff; he was Hufflepuff’s alone.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>His house was the one of badgers, of home, of family.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>His house was the one that was a home – the only one in Hogwarts.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He was a Hufflepuff down to the core, and that shows.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>So make him your loyalty, your fairness, your hard work.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Make him your dedication, your kindness, your tolerance.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Make him your hero, but make him a Hufflepuff one.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>You’ve already forgotten our others – what’s one more?</em>
</p><p>Cedric Diggory was ours, and for that we will come together with the other houses. For Cedric and for his death, for our hero being killed in moments that should’ve been filled with glory but were only filled with fear. For Cedric, for protection, we will come.</p><p>Dumbledore’s Army gains Hufflepuff members, and they do not come to learn for the sake of learning like the Ravenclaws. They do not come like the Gryffindors because they will need to be brave, because Voldemort has apparently arisen. They were invited, unlike the Slytherins. They come because their house needs protection. They come because Cedric was theirs.</p><p>The Ministry of Magic can try to tame the school, tame the houses, but Slytherin will manipulate her and Gryffindor will distract her. Ravenclaw will sink into their books and be forgotten. Hufflepuff will never even be thought about in the first place. So, naturally, hard work and fairness ensure that they undermine Umbridge’s teachings anyway.</p><p>Hufflepuff has always helped their members – it doesn’t take much to become a group effort to learn Defence Against the Dark Arts.</p><p align="center">
  <em>The world is deadly, dangerous.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Sometimes you have to find your burrow and weather the storm.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Sometimes you need to leave your comfort zone and fight.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Sometimes you need to laugh until you cry, because bad times are coming.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>You-Know-Who (Voldemort) is back. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>This is the time to come together, to tighten bonds, to find your reason to fight or hide.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>This isn’t their time; they are still children.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It’s a pity that the war doesn’t care.</em>
</p><p>Perhaps in another world Hufflepuff would act like another house, they would be taking the time to smile and knowing the war approaches, but ignoring it for what they have right now. In another world, Cedric Diggory hadn’t died and Hufflepuff hadn’t been the first to lose.</p><p>In this world, Cedric was the first to fall. He was the first casualty of war, and Hufflepuff wouldn’t let that lie. They take being unafraid of toil and they take their hard work. They think fairness and remember a Hufflepuff and he was a <em>hero</em>. They take everything they are and stick heels into the dirt, and they plant themselves, steady and ready. They think who needs to hide, who can come back, who will fight for which side. They think of themselves as family and <em>it shows</em>. It shows.</p><p>They spent a year with darkness haunting their footsteps before the war enters Hogwarts. They think safety and survival, but protection first, <em>always</em>. They do not put Cedric on a pedestal – he was human, flawed. They are too, but he is theirs. For that reason and for that reason only, they will prepare to fight.</p><p>In another world, there would be other reasons, but in this world – this is theirs.</p><p align="center">
  <em>This is war.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>This is screams echoing in hallways and not being able to turn away.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It’s learning torture, torturing, under the guise of a lesson.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It’s linking hands with your closest friend and holding on tight because letting go can mean death.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It’s setting up the buddy system but with an offensive member and a defensive member.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It’s stone walls seeming colder than ever before.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It’s secret passageways from the common room to the kitchen.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It’s stocking up and hiding in your burrow when it’s too dangerous.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It’s about keeping everyone safe. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It’s about the ghost of Cedric that makes up everyone’s spirit.</em>
</p><p>Look at what they called you – <em>look at what they said.</em> Duffer. Puff, but they said it like it’s an insult. Fourth-best. Second-best. Spares. Cast-offs. Weak. Useless. You called us these things – and it hurt, but we aren’t defined by these terms. Besides, the best part of hard work is taking something and claiming it. We take these insults and they become ours; they do not ruffle our fur because we have learnt. We have grown. We have armour now.</p><p>Here’s the thing about loyalty – you get to choose it. It is not Dumbledore we are loyal to. It is not Harry Potter. It is not Voldemort. It is not Snape. We are loyal to this – a memory of Cedric, <em>because he fought, because he was a Hufflepuff</em>.</p><p>So what if we seem weak, seem useless? We are <em>hard work</em>. We are <em>unafraid of toil</em>. That means we have skills. It means that we have strength. Maybe we aren’t intelligence or ambition or bravery – but we don’t need to be. We are so, so much more.</p><p>Perhaps the world needs to stop defining us by our house. Our house should be defined by us. Yes, there are foundations, there is a basis – but we are more than simple character traits. We are brains and personalities and bodies. We are a family. We found our home; we <em>made</em> it.</p><p>We might not be the best but you don’t need to be the best, you need to be enough for yourself. We are stubborn, heels turned to rock and a refusal to give up. We are patient, waiting for the right time to strike. We are fair play, because there are people who need justice and equality doesn’t exist. We are dedication, because you can put it, all in but you decide if you get something out of it. We are hard work because this world isn’t easy. We are kindness, because everyone deserves a chance. We are unafraid of toil because skills only get you so far. We are tolerance, but there is a limit, and everyone has one.</p><p>So, listen up all of you, call us whatever. We know what we are. We are strong and we are <em>alive.</em> We are fighting and fighting and fighting – fighting to not be forgotten, fighting to have our heroes remembered, fighting to not be a figurehead. We are fighting because we want to, because Cedric died, because there is unfairness in the world.</p><p>Kindness does not mean you have to be kind. Kindness can mean understanding, but understanding does not mean you must like someone. You can understand and you can still hate. But, that doesn’t matter – because Hufflepuff is not made up of kindness. There are people within Hufflepuff who are kind, but that does not mean all of them are.</p><p align="center">
  <em>When the boy-who-lived came back, we were already there.</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>We had been fighting; this was </em>war<em>. </em></p><p align="center">
  <em>It doesn’t matter that he had been fighting too. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Everyone has been fighting, because you cannot escape war.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>The point is that we went through something and he didn’t.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Children of war, children of peace, and growing up to be adults.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Where once we had tried our best – and failed – to brush of insults, there was something else.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Now we did our best to avoid curses, shields covering everyone’s backs. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>We stuck together because the buddy system works – one attack, one defend.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>You called us useless? We don’t care. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Hufflepuff is a badger and they fight to the bitter end.</em>
</p><p>The thing, is when we gathered in that hall, we did not leave. Oh, we pushed the young ones out, knocked them out and forced them to leave because we already had enough causalities on our hands and we knew that death would be the fate of many here. We were family and family hides the younger siblings to keep them from harm.</p><p>We were dangerous – and we had proven it, yet still they forgot, still they underestimated us. Underestimating us only gives us the advantage, but still we wonder. Why? Think of the colours – red and gold for the chivalrous in armour, blue and bronze for knowledge and keys, green and silver for hiding and weapons, yellow and black for bright and danger.</p><p>We fought, and we lost. We lost like every other house, because war ends with one side proclaiming themselves the victor but there are corpses on both sides. Cedric was the first to fall, but he was not the last. We fought, fought for individual reasons and fought for Cedric and fought for fairness.</p><p>Maybe we weren’t the strongest house overall, but you say strength and think of one meaning. We say strength and think that strength covers a lot of different meanings. Say what you want, but we fought and you can’t ask for more.</p><p>We found our dead and we went to their funerals. What more can you want? We were at war. War does not have much place for the kindness you think we hold. Perhaps you should change your definitions, update them.</p><p align="center">
  <em>Kindness is not a weakness. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Fairness does not meet niceness.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Dedication can mean strength.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Hard work means you get skilled regardless of your actual talent.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Unafraid of toil means you understand that hard work doesn’t mean you become the best.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Sometimes you learn to make what you have enough.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Find a home and a family at Hogwarts; only one house allows for that. </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Cedric Diggory died, yes, but not for a cause. He died a hero, a Hufflepuff.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Make him your loyalty, your fairness, your hard work.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Make him your dedication, your kindness, your tolerance.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>See, Hufflepuff is not your cast offs, your spares.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Hands and fingers coated in dirt doesn’t mean you ignore something.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>It means they did something; it means they worked.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>First things first, we are loyal. To ourselves and to each other.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>Kindness does not mean weakness; strength can be found clad in yellow and black.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>Words hurt, but they do not make you. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>
    <em>Dare the world and dig your heels in – no matter what, you are a Hufflepuff.</em>
