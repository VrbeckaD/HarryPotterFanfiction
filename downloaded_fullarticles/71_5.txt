</p>
<p>On his last night at Hogwarts before the train whisks him back to his Muggles, the Room of Requirement does something Tom had thought impossible. He isn’t even surprised – this has been a day for betrayal.</p>
<p>Tom, who had breezed through exams with the kind of careless grace his classmates could only envy, who this year had finally gained the allegiance of old Abraxas Malfoy, who had charmed a house elf into showing him some of Hogwarts’s greatest mysteries – he had gone to the Leaving Feast, of all events, with a bundle of anxious nerves writhing in his stomach.</p>
<p>Because in the heat of June, as Tom passed by on the way to his Runes exam, Dumbledore had stopped him in the hallway. And Dumbledore had put his hand on Tom’s shoulder, leaned in slightly so he could look him in the eye. He'd said, “You’re going to do great things, Tom,” and Tom had nodded, because he <em>knew that</em>. And Dumbledore had said, “I’m proud of you. Remember that,” with his eyes going all warm and crinkly, and then, “if you need anything, my boy, just ask.”</p>
<p>Tom had felt Dumbledore pat his shoulder fondly, felt a tightness in his throat, watched as Dumbledore strode away in a maelstrom of chartreuse and tangerine robes. He had thought of how, four long years ago, Dumbledore had given him his first hug even as he left him in gray Wool’s Orphanage. He’d remembered the feel of Fawkes perching on his shoulder, the warmth of being praised in Transfiguration class. Tom’s old fantasy of rescue from the orphanage reared its head once more, and he hadn’t the heart to kill it again.</p>
<p>So Tom had hurried off to ace his Runes exam, and then his Defense exam, and the next day his History of Magic exam. And then he was done, alone in a common room full of Slytherins that couldn’t stop talking about how <em>excited</em> they were to be free for the summer.</p>
<p>As he’d packed his bags for the next morning’s journey, Dumbledore’s hope was a snake coiled loosely around his heart, hissing quiet encouragement. And as Tom had walked to the Leaving Feast, had taken his seat between Gideon Nott and Simon Avery, had dug into a plate of sprouts and quiche, a decision was forming in his mind.</p>
<p>Tom had never asked for a favor before. Not the kind of favor someone could refuse, anyway. He found that he didn’t much like it, this feeling that he was at Dumbledore's mercy, but the looming specter of the orphanage and the prodding of the little hope-snake would not let him back down.</p>
<p>As the Great Hall emptied itself of laughing students and Tom forced down his last bites of sweet apple pudding, he had looked up towards the head table to catch Dumbledore’s sharp blue eyes.</p>
<p>He strode up to the head table like this was normal, like his kneecaps weren’t ready to invert themselves over the indignity of it all. He had looked past a pair of paisley-patterned robes, past the long auburn hair, up at Dumbledore himself, mind a mystery behind piercing blue. “I need a home for the summer, sir,” he had said, throat closing over his rehearsed, <em>Can you provide?</em> And Dumbledore’s mind may have been a mystery, but Tom could see his face turn sorrowful and apologetic, and sense what was coming. He tuned out the old man’s excuses and assurances while he slit the hope-snake’s lying throat and hung it out to dry. May its bones serve as a reminder never to trust.</p>
<p>Tom had smiled beautifully and shuttered his mind as tightly as possible, told Dumbledore that he understood perfectly and yes, can’t wait to see you again next year, professor.</p>
<p>He had done his very best to sulk in the common room, but Gideon and Simon had accosted him with smiles and an arm around his shoulders, and Tom – who couldn’t stand that kind of familiarity even on a good day, who looked into their eyes and tasted pity on Gideon’s thoughts and felt the cloud of firewhiskey over Simon’s mind – had fled.</p>
<p>The Room of Requirement, far above the dungeons, stood as immovable proof that Hogwarts was <em>his</em>. Her greatest secret, laid bare to him after a weeks-long search this Yule. The Room unfolded to him as a vision of the Dark Forest, knowing that it would help calm him. Tom sunk to the mossy floor, feeling his shoulders loosen and his breath come more easily.</p>
<p>When he couldn’t put thoughts of Dumbledore out of his head, the Room had provided apparitions for him to blast down, bleeding away his anger and feeling the misery surge up in its place.</p>
<p>And it’s then – when the lonesome sorrow starts to nip at his heels, when the world beyond the Room seems too much to bear and Tom finds himself wondering, idle and desperate, whether the Room could hide him away for the whole summer – that the impossible happens.</p>
<p>Tom hears a click, a <em>woosh</em>, as the door to the Room opens to reveal a boy in a hand-knitted sweater, a cloak like liquid moonlight hanging loosely from his hand.</p>
<p>“Tom Riddle,” says the boy, and Tom watches as his face contorts into an ugly mask. Tom pivots to face the boy fully, sizing him up: third year, perhaps, a bit younger than Tom, hair in complete disarray, death-green eyes magnified by thick glasses. Tom fails to recognize him, yet the Room had just – clicked open for him. Like this scrawny boy in a dragon-patterned sweater and too-big trousers should be permitted into this space of Tom’s, this refuge in the heart of the school. The rage from before spills back, and Tom nearly chokes on it.</p>
<p>No, he must be polite, delicate; he must always play the good boy for the other magicals – <em>but how is it that Tom doesn’t recognize this boy</em> – Tom licks his lips and runs a hand through his hair, fixing on his most charming expression. The Dark Forest recedes behind him, peeling back to allow a radius of plain stone walls around the doorway where the boy hovers.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe I’ve yet had the pleasure of your acquaintance,” Tom says, making his way towards the invader, trying not to let his voice go high with rage. The Forest fades from the room entirely. The boy’s eyes dart wildly; Tom notes his wand begin to rise. He thrusts his hand out for a shake. Woodenly, the boy passes his wand to his other palm and takes Tom’s hand, making eye contact.</p>
<p>Tom slips into his mind and nearly jumps back out at the torrent of bone-blackening hatred that hits him. Why – no matter. He delves deeper, weathering the hatred. <em>There</em>. A paper-white mask, flat and sharp-boned, burning red eyes staring madly out. An enormous fang sticking out of a child’s bony brown arm. A boy settling to the ground with the winged grace of an <em>Avada</em> victim.</p>
<p>The green-eyed boy jerks away, back into the hall. <em>No</em>, thinks Tom. <em>I need to understand, you can’t leave</em>. Gripping the boy’s hand, Tom steps with him.</p>
<p>A vicious pull in his navel, like a terribly violent Portkey – pain in his hand where it touches the boy’s – an explosive force, a moment of flight – and all goes blissfully black.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>A sheep is chewing on Tom’s hand. He hisses at it to go away, but it seems perfectly content to keep gnawing. He rasps out a string of angry Parseltongue. The sheep turns to him, eyes vacant and alien. Its mouth is caked with blood; Tom realizes suddenly that his hand is on fire, and the sheep is on fire, and…</p>
<p>His eyes fly open. The dream retreats, leaving him with the pain in his right arm and a lingering unease.</p>
<p>“Excellent! We were hoping you weren’t brain-dead,” says a voice. With his injuries, Tom dares not sit up fully; wincing, he raises just his head and sees a pair of hooded figures looming over the foot of his bed. One leans closer, and some impulse has Tom trying to scramble backward.</p>
<p>His body is unresponsive. The quiet panic that has simmered in his mind since he dreamed the bloody too-sharp teeth of that sheep rises in his throat. His head lolls, searching desperately for his wand to no avail.</p>
<p>The panic sharpens now, and as the figure creeps ever closer, wielding a clipboard like a threat, Tom lets go. Magic curls out of him, settling in the corners of the room. A sheaf of papers takes flight, twisting into a flock of deep black birds that tear around the room in a great gust before the second figure waves their wand and returns the conjurations to their original form.</p>
<p>“The Minister was not joking about this one’s power,” tuts the first figure, seemingly unruffled by the assault.</p>
<p>The silent figure has come over to Tom’s left and is fussing with an overturned table of instruments: chalk, scalpels, what looks like the steering wheel of a Muggle car…</p>
<p>The first figure wiggles a ritual athame out of where it sticks in the far wall, then makes a notation on their clipboard. “However, he completely failed to mention the subject’s emotional volatility.”</p>
<p>Somewhere behind the bed they’ve lain him, Tom hears a door swing gently open. The figures stand up straighter. “Minister!” says the annoying one, “Perfect timing! Our first subject is conscious, and judging by the health of his magic he seems to be on the way to a full recovery.”</p>
<p>“And the other subject?” says a very familiar voice.</p>
<p>“All we can do is hope, sir. There’s been no change in his condition… and if he follows with our precedents he’ll remain in the current vegetative state for around three months before his magic gives up on him and we can ethically terminate.”</p>
<p>Tom spends a moment grappling with the phrase ‘ethically terminate’ before his attention is caught by the new man, who is most definitively <em>not</em> Minister Spencer-Moon. The man wears respectable blue-black robes. His hair is long and white, his face lined with age. He cannot possibly be Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Hello, Tom,” says the man – Tom’s mind pinwheels. Dumbledore has an elder brother, but surely no one in their right mind would call Aberforth ‘Minister.’ The man-who-isn’t-Dumbledore puts a gentle hand on Tom’s shoulder and smiles. There is something strange about his eyes that Tom can’t quite pinpoint, but they are as bright and impregnable as ever. No one has ever smiled at Tom the way Dumbledore does.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore,” he says, alarmed to find his voice scratchy and weak. “How – Where –”</p>
<p>“We are in the Department of Mysteries, in the human research lab of the Time Sector. The year is 1995.”</p>
<p>Tom feels icy shock spread down his body. He tries to flex his paralyzed fingers, but they remain motionless and freezing.</p>
<p>Dumbledore, perceptive as ever, waves an unfamiliar wand over Tom, ending whatever spell had kept him pinned. Tom curls around his core, taking a moment for relief over his own mobility, then brings himself into a sitting position, the better to display his righteous anger. Old as this Dumbledore may be, he has still betrayed Tom in a way that puts his magic in the mood to go for another vengeful circle around the little research room.</p>
<p>“I don’t care to be a human research subject, sir,” Tom says evenly, relieved to hear his voice come out stronger.</p>
<p>“Common procedure for cases of time slippage, my boy. Situations like yours happen more often than one would expect, especially within the halls of Hogwarts castle.”</p>
<p>“Is it procedurally appropriate to <em>release</em> subjects once they’ve been briefed on their situation?”</p>
<p>Tom has been trying to forget about the worryingly excited hooded figure with the clipboard – a Ministry Unspeakable, he now realizes – but they seemingly can’t help but respond to his question. “Mr. Riddle, we can’t possibly let you loose until we’ve properly analyzed your case! Fifty-three years’ travel into the future is a significant outlier in the data we’ve collected up till now.”</p>
<p>The silent Unspeakable nods their hooded head and holds up a graph that means nothing to Tom, pointing emphatically at a dot to the upper right.</p>
<p>Tom pinches the bridge of his nose and wonders if the Ministry might consider feeding him.</p>
<p>Dumbledore kneels on the floor beside Tom’s bed. “I’m so glad that you’ve returned to us, Tom. I feared for so long that you might be lost completely… that fear has haunted me for five long decades.” His voice is soft enough not to carry to the Unspeakables.</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir,” says Tom, failing to conceal a tremble in his voice.</p>
<p>“Can you stand?”</p>
<p>Tom tries, with Dumbledore’s spindly strength holding him up. The Unspeakable makes a kind of clucking noise every time Tom moves, but seems to respect Dumbledore’s authority. Upright once more, Tom finally considers his wounded right hand.</p>
<p>It’s like a strange art piece, the scars; embroidery thread looped around his bones, pink and white and fragmentary. Like his hand were a fine glass sculpture hit in the palm by a mallet, shattered, and pieced back together badly, so the cracks still showed. He touches it gently with his left hand, feeling the rawness and bumps to it. How utterly bizarre.</p>
<p>Dumbledore watches over his investigation with a kind of sad fondness that leaves Tom uncomfortable. “You’re Minister, then?” Tom hears himself say as if from a great distance. “Must have been a strange fifty-three years.”</p>
<p>“Unspeakables Spavin and Fawley, I must ask for a moment of privacy,” says Dumbledore over his shoulder, and Tom’s hooded figures dart like shadows out into the hall. Dumbledore guides Tom back to his seat on the bed, and perches beside him. “If I have your permission to waffle on about history, I would be delighted to fill you in on the state of our world.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore tells Tom that after his encounter with the green-eyed boy outside the Room, the war against Grindelwald had raged another three years. Dumbledore had finally come to his senses: the Dark Lord had to be stopped. He led a force of British wizards to the Continent in support of the Allied Wizarding Front. Grindelwald, already driven to desperation by the American involvement in his war, had agreed to stake everything on a duel with Dumbledore. Dumbledore won, though he does not tell Tom much more about the duel.</p>
<p>With the war won, a new era of peace enfolded Wizarding Europe. Dumbledore was offered the seat of Minister, but he refused in favor of remaining at Hogwarts as Headmaster in old Dippet’s place. After seven years at Hogwarts, however, he finally accepted the Wizengamot’s call to the office of the Minister.</p>
<p>“Such a shame,” Dumbledore sighs. “As Minister, I’m expected to dress so… conservatively.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” says Tom, not really hearing. That makes thirty-three years in office. He is eying Dumbledore in a different light, now. “And there’s been peace for all that time?”</p>
<p>“More or less.”</p>
<p>“Has anyone,” Tom checks that the door is shut tight and lowers his voice. “Has anyone openly carried the Mantle since Grindelwald?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s eyes seem strange in the ambient light of Tom’s holding chamber. For a moment, he thinks they aren’t blue at all, but rather – he blinks, and the illusion vanishes. “Wherever the Mantle – both Mantles, in fact – might be, they are not advertising themselves.”</p>
<p>Tom feels a bit faint. He needs to get his newly-scarred hands on some modern history books.</p>
<p>“In a moment, I’ll leave you to get some well-deserved rest,” says Dumbledore. “But I think  it would be best if we first checked in with your fellow patient.”</p>
<p>In one motion, Dumbledore rises to his feet and conjures an elegant cane for Tom. Tom hobbles in his mentor’s wake, following him into a hallway of polished black surfaces. If not for gravity and the shape of the doorframe, Tom thinks, he would not be able to tell the floor from the walls from the ceiling.</p>
<p>There are no lights, but Tom can still see perfectly. Dumbledore, as if sensing his fascination, sends him an amused smile over half-moon glasses before guiding him a short way down the hallway towards a door identical to the one they had only just emerged from.</p>
<p>The Unspeakables wait inside, looming in all their hooded glory over a bed that is like Tom’s, but for the circles of runes scrawled around it – and, Tom realizes, the floor and walls, too, are papered with symbols. <em>Forbiddance</em>, he reads, and <em>Quietude</em>, and <em>DO NOT TOUCH</em>. Runes are weird.</p>
<p>“Do you know this child?” says Dumbledore, and Tom forces himself to look at the boy lying, corpselike, on the bed. <em>Ethically terminate</em>, he thinks. That could have been <em>him</em>. He could have been dead.</p>
<p>“I don’t know him,” Tom swallows. “But I’ve seen him before. <em>He</em> knew <em>me</em>. He said my name.”</p>
<p>“It is our belief that he is from this time. 1995. You see, there is a boy of the same age attending Hogwarts who bears a remarkable similarity to him, but for some… physical indicators.” Dumbledore smooths back the boy’s bangs to reveal a jagged white scar.</p>
<p>Tom’s eyes wander, catching on the boy’s right arm. The same shattered-glass scars on his own hand stand lividly out from the boy’s. “So, what, he’s the secret twin of a Hogwarts student? That makes no sense.”</p>
<p>The noisier Unspeakable clears their throat self-importantly. “This is the fourth-recorded incident of reality-hopping in the last seven centuries. We believe that this child is a version of Henry Potter from a timeline separate from our own.”</p>
<p>Tom steps closer to the boy’s bed. “And none of these other… reality hoppers… have woken up?”</p>
<p>“It was believed that their souls flee in the jump between worlds.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t there spells to check for that?” Tom’s hand hovers over the boy’s. Twin mirrors, both in fragments.</p>
<p>“Invented just in the last century, after the three previous subjects had all passed. We tested this one, and he has his soul. It’s… irregular, certainly, but there.”</p>
<p>Tom touches his shattered right hand to the back of the boy’s scarred palm.</p>
<p>The boy’s eyes, green as death, slam open.</p>
<p>The chatty Unspeakable crows with animal joy. Their partner scribbles eager notes on their graphing paper. Tom… Tom stares.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>Harry wakes to Tom Riddle – not <em>again</em> – looming over him like a vengeful skeleton, with his pale bony face and rot-dark eyes. Harry remembers thinking that diary-Riddle was very handsome, but in plain hospital robes, his hair a wreck and his eye sockets bruised with lack of sleep, this Riddle is much diminished. Harry wishes he would stop staring like that, all murderous and intrigued. As if <em>Harry</em> were the impossibility between the two of them.</p>
<p>Beyond Riddle stand two hooded figures. A terrible jolt of fear runs through Harry – perhaps the week since the graveyard was just a dream – Voldemort has captured him, somehow revived the diary-Riddle – those figures could be Death Eaters, disguised by darkness rather than masks. Harry tries to leap to his feet, to reach for his wand, but finds himself immobilized.</p>
<p>“<em>Hell</em>,” says Riddle, backing up a step – Harry figures something in his expression has alarmed him. <em>Good</em>, he thinks for a fierce moment before all his mental energy suddenly shifts to complete shock over the strangeness of hearing Lord Voldemort use a Muggle swear.</p>
<p>Then Harry notices Dumbledore, wearing professional clothing and a practical hat, at the shoulders of the Death Eaters. It’s the hat, finally, that breaks him. Dumbledore would never wear something so boring and – frankly – Muggle. Harry closes his eyes and tries to breathe, closing himself off from the gibbering nonsense of it all.</p>
<p>A minute passes, then: “Mister Riddle has gone to get a well-deserved snack and a nap. Unspeakable Spavin is still here to keep watch over you, but Unspeakable Fawley has gone with Tom. We need your testimonial, my boy. Can you tell us what happened?”</p>
<p>Harry opens his eyes. Dumbledore is still wearing muted colors and looking presentable, but he can deal with that. Tom Riddle is gone, and those hadn’t been Death Eaters at all, just overly mysterious Ministry workers. Okay. “With all due respect, sir, I already told you all about what happened at the graveyard… If the Ministry needs my testimony, can’t they just get it from you?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore looks rather dumbfounded. “Let’s start at the beginning, please. I don’t need to know about… the graveyard.”</p>
<p>Harry closed his mouth, frowning. What could possibly –</p>
<p>“What is your name?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore never struck Harry as the type to play cruel jokes like this. Is this some kind of concussion protocol, like Dudley had started teasing him with whenever he hit Harry in the head? <em>How many fingers am I holding up? No. Let’s try an easier one. How dead are your parents</em>? Maybe Harry <em>has</em> hit his head. That would make all of this make more sense. “My name is Harry James Potter.”</p>
<p>“Good. And your parents’ names?”</p>
<p>“James Potter and Lily Potter.”</p>
<p>“Today’s date?”</p>
<p>“June… June 26<sup>th</sup>. 1995.”</p>
<p>“Your blood status?”</p>
<p>“Er – half-blood.”</p>
<p>“What can you last remember?”</p>
<p>Harry relaxes slightly. This seems a lot like concussion protocol – real concussion protocol, not the crap Dudley had picked up from wrestling. “I was out – after curfew,” Harry says, checking to see that Dumbledore doesn’t look mad. He doesn’t. “Just going for a walk around the castle. To say goodbye, y’know, before I’d have to go back to the Dursleys for the summer. I saw a door that I’d never seen before –” even on the Marauder’s Map “– and I was curious, so I opened it.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore leans forwards, an intensity in his eyes that Harry has never seen before. “What did you see?”</p>
<p>“A forest. Tom Riddle. He saw me, too – he looked angry, but then he wanted to shake my hand. I took his hand, but he squeezed it so tightly I was scared it would bruise. I stepped backwards out of the room with the forest – but the forest was gone – and everything exploded.”</p>
<p>“This was a room on the seventh floor?” Confused, Harry nods. “Good. Now, who are the Dursleys, Mister Potter?”</p>
<p>“My aunt and uncle. I live with them,” says Harry, but he’s becoming angry now – his head is fine, and he doesn’t want to talk about his family.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you live with Lily and James?”</p>
<p>“Because Voldemort killed them thirteen years ago.” Harry snaps. “I’m not bloody concussed, okay? I don’t know why I’m here, but this little interrogation is not helping.”</p>
<p>“Spavin, do you have the Veritaserum on hand?” Dumbledore says, looking beyond Harry. There is such ice in his eyes that Harry barely recognizes him.</p>
<p>The Unspeakable in the shadows cackles. “Thought you’d never ask!”</p>
<p>They administer the potion by a syringe to his immobilized arm rather than by mouth. The injection hurts even through his paralysis.</p>
<p>For a fleeting moment, Harry thinks he can fight the potion just like he had the Imperius curse, but he’s so tired and the fog of willful obedience that the Veritaserum invokes is so intoxicating. Harry tells them about his childhood, about Voldemort, about Quirrel and Sirius and the travesty that was the Yule Ball. He tells them about the diary, the basilisk, the terrible Chamber locked deep under the school.</p>
<p>When the potion finally wears off, Harry finds that his throat is raw from it all. Dumbledore is very quiet.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand, sir,” Harry croaks. “You were there…”</p>
<p>“Mr. Potter,” Dumbledore says, “I am afraid that you have been the unfortunate victim of a rare form of what the Department of Mysteries calls time slippage. Today is the 28<sup>th</sup> of June, 1995, but no Dark Lord has set foot on British soil for over a century, James and Lily Potter are very much alive, and Tom Riddle has been missing for fifty-three years.”</p>
<p>“My parents are alive?” is all Harry can think to say.</p>
<p>The last of the ice in Dumbledore’s eyes melts. “I’m sure they’ll be ecstatic to meet you, Harry.”</p>
<p>The Unspeakable squawks. “Minister, that is against every rule we have! Does this mean <em>nothing</em> to you?” Harry follows their gloved finger to a series of completely unintelligible runes painted near the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Those rules are for cases of travelers to the past from the future in a continuous timeline. We’re only invoking them because we have no rules for inter-reality travelers. Besides, this is <em>Lily and James</em> we’re talking about. If we cannot trust those two, we are truly lost.”</p>
<p>Harry is exhausted and beyond confused, his hand feels like it was gored by a Hungarian Horntail, and some of the implications of Dumbledore’s words are starting to sink in. But all of that is nothing compared to the bright joy he feels at the prospect of meeting his parents. He feels eleven again, sat in the dust, staring up at a phantasmal family.</p>
<p>“Mister Potter,” Dumbledore says, so serious that Harry feels himself wake up a little, putting aside his fantasies. “During our scans, we found something strange that you ought to know about. Did you consent to a semi-sentient magical parasite’s attachment to your soul?”</p>
<p>“Fuck,” says Harry, biting his tongue too late. “What does that even mean? I – <em>no</em>. Shit.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiles benignly. Harry figures that’s his way of saying he doesn’t mind the profanity. “Do you want it removed?”</p>
<p>“Yes? I think? What is it? Magical parasite sounds – bad. Really bad.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore looks into his eyes for a long moment. <em>That’s it</em>, thinks Harry. <em>That’s what seems off about his eyes. They aren’t twinkling like they did. How strange.</em></p>
<p>“We’ll leave you to your rest now, Harry. We will discuss your soul at a later date,” says Dumbledore. “Stay brave, little one.”</p>
<p>The Unspeakable who had seemed so joyful at the prospect of dosing Harry with Veritaserum lingers by his bedside. The lower their hood, revealing a woman with yellowy eyes and a head of feathers growing where most people have hair. “Would you like me to spell you to sleep, Mister Potter?”</p>
<p>She seems kinder now that he can see her face. “Yes, please.”</p>
<p>The strange little Ministry room dissolves into an ashy dreamscape as Harry lets Spavin’s spell carry him to sleep at last.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>Harry comes to with the abrupt sensation of a <em>Rennervate</em>. In the same breath, he feels the magic that had kept his body petrified dissipate, leaving him free to set about methodically cracking his knuckles, spine, neck, and toes.</p>
<p>Riddle has returned. He regards Harry’s popping toes with abject horror. Dumbledore, standing cranelike beside Riddle, seems fascinated. The quiet Unspeakable happily scribbles away at their clipboard, no doubt making record of Harry’s wakeup ritual. He cracks his wrists, too, just for them.</p>
<p>“What happened to my hand?” he says, glimpsing the mostly healed patchwork of scars scrambling over his right arm. “I don’t think I had these before.”</p>
<p>“A side effect of the powerful time magic you invoked, we think. Tom here was also marked.” Dumbledore gives Riddle an unsubtle nudge, prompting him to hold up his similarly mangled forearm.</p>
<p>“Now back to business!” Unspeakable Spavin, who has pulled her cloak back up over her face, steps out to stand beside her silent partner. She claps in apparent delight, filling Harry with a deep, wriggling dread. “Time for paperwork and restrictions!”</p>
<p>Dumbledore beams. “I can hardly wait. But first, might I suggest we bring in Lily and James?”</p>
<p>The quiet Unspeakable points insistently at one of the runes, this time one on the floor.</p>
<p>Riddle frowns, squinting at the ground. “Does that say something about whale organs?”</p>
<p>“Excellent translation, Tom! But no, Unspeakable Fawley is indicating those symbols a bit to the right, which serve as the key to this third runic circle. We’ve found that a combination of –”</p>
<p>“No time for humdingering around, Minister. Mr. Potter, if you’d just sign here, we can all get moving…”</p>
<p>Harry takes the document Spavin offers him, still puzzling over ‘whale organs’ and desperate to get out of this stifling room. Between Veritaserum and Riddle’s future employment as a Dark Lord, he trusts no one in his vicinity. Dashing out his signature, Harry resolves to take a page from fake-Moody’s book and practice <em>constant vigilance</em> until he manages to get out of this mess. Yes, no one in this supposed other timeline would be getting one over on him, not again –</p>
<p>“Excellent!” crows Spavin, snatching the contract from Harry. “We have ourselves a legal consent to brand! Everyone ready?”</p>
<p>As they paralyze Harry once more, brush aside the hair growing shaggily over the nape of his neck, and press something blisteringly hot into the skin there, Harry realizes that he has made a mistake. The smell of burning flesh hits him a moment later, and Harry feels his thoughts slow to an incredulous crawl. He’s spent over fourteen years on this planet. How has it taken him until now to realize how monumentally <em>stupid</em> he is?</p>
<p>Quiet Fawley comes up beside him. They don’t verbalize their spells, but Harry feels his damaged nape knit itself together, pain fading into a cool numbness. He tries to say ‘thank you,’ but realizes that paralysis has locked up his head and mouth, too.</p>
<p>After a moment, Dumbledore murmurs what Harry recognizes as the counter to <em>Petrificus Totalus</em>. Harry finds himself locking eyes with a blank Riddle. His face has a bit more color to it now, but he still only seems to increase in creepiness each time Harry meets him.</p>
<p>Harry very gingerly reaches around to prod the back of his neck. “What –”</p>
<p>“Simple unspeak-seal,” says Spavin idly. “Everyone in the Department has one. It’s what gives us our name – just stops us from spilling intradepartmental secrets to anyone not in the fold. The same brand is also applied to people who have slipped in from the future – it’s a way to protect the timeline.” She turns her hood on Harry. “Just because <em>we</em> didn’t mean you harm, though, doesn’t mean that you should be signing binding contracts willy-nilly.”</p>
<p>A ghost of a smug smile touches Riddle’s lips. Harry hates him with every twitching muscle in his body.</p>
<p>Dumbledore breaks rudely into Harry’s murder fantasy. “Intradepartmental secrets include most details of your, ah… home dimension, I suppose we could call it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, have you been reading those Muggle sci-fi books I lent you, Minister?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiles enigmatically. The expression seems empty given the strange new flatness of his eyes. “Harry, I believe we are now at liberty to invite Lily and James inside. I’ve offered them the day off so they can meet you.”</p>
<p>“They work here, sir?”</p>
<p>“James is a bit of a rising star among the Aurors. Your mother works in Charms Architecture. Both brilliant, both with a strong working relationship to the Department of Mysteries.”</p>
<p>Spavin clucks anxiously. “We still haven’t fulfilled qualifications alpha-two and theta for the subject to be exposed to the outer world. I met with my bosses, and we may be bypassing a lot of normal procedure in this case, but we will not stand for <em>that</em> particular twisting of rules, oh no…”</p>
<p>“James and Lily already know enough about this case that those two measures are completely irrelevant to them. It is probably better, even, that they are in the room when we explain our next steps to Mr. Potter.”</p>
<p>Fawley, seeming to agree with Dumbledore, wanders over to the door and opens it. Harry twists to follow their movement – his breath catches in his throat as two adults stride inside.</p>
<p>They look so much older than Harry expected. In his mind, they had forever been preserved as photographs of joyous twenty-somethings, caught up in the kind of love that ends wars. This Lily’s face is lined with laughter under the tiger-bright explosion of her hair – she’s cut it short enough that it just grazes her shoulders, but it still seems to fill the room. James has gone gray at the temples and grown a well-trimmed beard. Maybe it’s because of the facial hair, but looking at him doesn’t give Harry that same looking-in-a-mirror feeling that James’s old photos do.</p>
<p>“Sweet Merlin,” Lily murmurs, glancing around the room. “He’s a boy, not a bomb; aren’t most of these runes a tad overkill?”</p>
<p>“He kind of <em>is</em> a bomb, though. It has been our job to defuse him,” says Spavin, seeming to puff up under the cloak.</p>
<p>“Er, thanks as always, Fawley.” James nods to the silent Unspeakable, skirting around Lily and Spavin’s little tiff so he can kneel beside Harry. “Can’t believe how much you look like Henry.” He clears his throat and gives Harry a smile he recognizes as his own. “How are you holding up, buddy? I know this is probably all kinds of overwhelming, and I know we aren’t quite the parents you knew, but the Minister has agreed to let us give you a home, if that’s what you want.”</p>
<p>Harry feels his throat close up. He blinks hard and feels a tear slip down his face.</p>
<p>James looks rather taken aback at the crying. He broadcasts an S.O.S. to Lily, but Spavin intercepts. “I see our report missed out on a couple of important details. My apologies, Mr. and Mrs. Potter! Harry here was orphaned at the age of one! A full analysis of his testimony under Veritaserum is still pending, but he suffered severe abuse throughout early childhood and likely has a bit of a complex around… family.”</p>
<p>Angry, Harry wipes away the tear with the hem of his hospital gown. “I don’t have a <em>complex</em>. And I wouldn’t characterize the Dursley’s treatment as ‘severe abuse’, just… I dunno, neglect?”</p>
<p>Spavin ignores him. “I recommend he start seeing a Mind Healer to work through all that.”</p>
<p>“I am going to murder Petunia,” Lily’s face has gone very pale. Harry wonders why no one ever bothered telling him how scary she had been. How scary she <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Harry finds himself crying again, rather to his horror. James sits on his bed next to him, slings a rough arm around his shoulders, and half-holds him. It’s – comforting. No one has ever quite done something like this for him, not with this air of practice and love. James’s real son – Henry – had better know how lucky he is.</p>
<p>James interrupts Lily’s interrogation of Spavin for ‘classified’ details of Harry’s childhood. “When can we get the kid out of this place?”</p>
<p>Harry finds himself distracted by Riddle, still lurking in the corner. Dumbledore’s hand rests on his shoulder, either as a comfort or a restraint. Riddle’s face wears an expression more human than Harry thought him capable of, but still beyond comprehension. Jealousy, perhaps? Is that even possible?</p>
<p>Lily seems to have quite rattled Spavins, who is eager to answer James’s concerns. “Harry needs to comply with sections alpha-two and theta of the Conservation of the Timeline Against Extratemporal Threats ruling. C-TAET. We passed it yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Okay. And what does that mean?”</p>
<p>At Spavin’s insistent gesturing, Fawley slips over to her side, helpfully holding up a simple pendant.</p>
<p>“Requirement alpha-two: disguise! The subject should not be recognizable as what we are calling a ‘temporal clone’, or a new version of a person already present in the timeline. Henry and Harry have different enough phenotypes that they are distinguishable, but they’re still genetic twins. This necklace is enchanted to place a glamour over the wearer. Fawley will now demonstrate!”</p>
<p>Fawley loops the pendant over their hood. There is no visible change to the shadowy abyss of their face.</p>
<p>“Excellent! As you can see, quite effective. Harry should feel very lucky; this product won’t be on the market for at least another year.” Spavin snaps her fingers very loudly. Fawley hands back the pendant, which Spavin places around Harry’s neck.</p>
<p>Harry prods his face, but it doesn’t feel any different. Riddle stares at him. Harry looks away.</p>
<p>“Now all we need is a cover story. The Time Council themselves have decided that you will be posing as a classmate of Tom Riddle’s who traveled with him through time! Your new family name is Partridge, and you are the last remaining member of a politically unimportant family that died out around the fifties. Sound good?”</p>
<p>It does <em>not</em>, but Harry nods mutely anyway, fingering the disguise pendant.</p>
<p>Lily cracks her knuckles. “So, we’ve got that sorted. What’s requirement theta?”</p>
<p>With a flourish, Fawley offers her a sheet of thick parchment. Lily reads it over, frowning. “Three sessions a year? Why?”</p>
<p>“Research!” Spavin claps in delight. “We’ve already learned a great deal from Harry here. Not as much as we get from travelers from our own timeline’s future, but, well.” Her hood swivels for a moment to point at Dumbledore and Riddle. “Certainly enough information to guide the Ministry in the coming years.”</p>
<p>James smiles down at Harry. “What do you think about that, fawn? Three sessions a year with the Unspeakables?”</p>
<p>“Er, yeah, sure.”</p>
<p>“And Tom?” Lily’s voice goes very gentle, like she’s speaking to a wild animal. “I understand you’re stranded just as much as our Harry. Minister Dumbledore’s asked if we might open our home to you, as well, if you have nowhere else to go. It would be our sincere pleasure to share our family with you.”</p>
<p>Riddle opens his mouth, then looks at Dumbledore and quiets. Harry wonders if James can feel how tense Harry’s own shoulders have gotten.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Lily,” Dumbledore says mildly. “I think that will be an excellent arrangement for all parties.”</p>
<p>Riddle curls his lip, and for a moment Harry worries for Dumbledore’s safety. “Certainly, sir,” is all he says, then to the Potters, “it would be an honor to share your home, if only for the summer.” His face melts into the charismatic smile Harry remembers from second year.</p>
<p>“I suppose that’s all sorted, then,” says a cheery Spavin as she wipes away the runes encircling Harry. “I’ll see you in two months, Mister <em>Partridge</em>! We’ll take a look at that parasite, hit you up with more Veritaserum, and have an all-around great time. Congratulations on getting some parents! Be nice to Tom! Goodbye, now!”</p>
