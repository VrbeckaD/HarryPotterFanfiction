Dumbledore asked, staring at Petunia in dumb shock.</p><p>"Exactly what I said. The... creature put up wards that it promised would be as effective as your blood wards at keeping the freaks who killed my sister away from my family."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"And it said it could keep the little freakling safer than he would have been here anyway, so that should make <em>your lot</em> happy."</p><hr/><p>Harry was happy in his new home.</p><p>The skull-headed half-fae creature who'd bought him and the silent but affectionate banshee maid were already more of a family to him than his aunt, uncle, and cousin had ever been.</p><p>And! Elias was teaching him magic! That was the best part, besides not having to do all the chores, and being allowed to make noise if he felt like it, and having the freedom to wander around the house and even outside (although he wasn't supposed to go past the front yard without his guardian, which seemed fair)... okay, he had to admit, literally everything about this arrangement was better than living with the Dursleys had been.</p><hr/><p>Dumbledore was not particularly surprised when, on the day after Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, he received a letter from Elias Ainsworth explaining that Harry is already receiving private tutoring in the magical arts and will therefore have to respectfully decline the offer of a Hogwarts education.</p><hr/><p>When the final showdown against the Dark Lord came, not even a single scrap of Voldemort's soul survived.</p><p>~end~</p></div>
