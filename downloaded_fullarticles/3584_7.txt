    <p>It was cold for spring on that dark New York night. </p>
<p>Newt, clutching his suitcase in his hands, crossed the empty street until he reached the building. Behind him, Tina and Queenie followed him, wands hidden between the folds of their coats. </p>
<p>“We have to be quick once we are inside,” Tina said. “Do you all remember what you are meant to do?”</p>
<p>Newt and Queenie nodded, and they opened the door. Quietly, they slipped through the entrance of MACUSA's prison, tucked away within their main building. </p>
<p>They walked in silence, keeping their wands pointed upwards, until they reached the elevators and went down to the lowest level. </p>
<p>The prison ward, usually filled with people and aurors, was utterly empty when they came in. Tina, feeling guilty, stayed by the door to watch out for anyone who might see them. Not only were they breaking into the building, they would also be releasing a prisoner.</p>
<p>“She isn't dangerous,” Queenie said, trying to calm Newt. “But she's resourceful.”</p>
<p>“What was her crime?”</p>
<p>Queenie made a face.</p>
<p>“You'll find out as soon as she sees Tina. I think she's probably still angry.”</p>
<p>There were boxes stacked at the furthest end of the room, arranged horizontally in a very organized matter in long vertical lines. Some of them seemed covered, and some were empty. Most of them, however, were occupied and shone bleakly from the inside, as if a small nightlight was lit in them.</p>
<p>“This is inhumane,” Queenie said, approaching. “It's like they're trapped inside a fish tank.”</p>
<p>She was right, Newt realized. He could see people moving inside the glass containers, rolling over in their sleep. He couldn't imagine how uncomfortable it must have been.</p>
<p>“According to the file, she must be in the third row from the bottom, in column M.”</p>
<p>“Do they let them out, at least sometimes?”</p>
<p>“I don't know,” she responded. “When we find her, you can ask her.”</p>
<p>They lit up their wands, and began looking for the correct row and column.</p>
<p>“Here,” Queenie said. “Mathilda Burke.”</p>
<p>The figure inside was motionless, but the light was on, so they were sure that the confinement cell was in use.</p>
<p>Queenie tapped her fingernails against the glass, and the sudden movement inside of the box was all they needed to proceed.</p>
<p>Tina had also taken the combination that unlocked her cell, when she stole her file - and when she made sure that no one would be around when they broke in.</p>
<p>“Hi Tilda. It's me, Queenie. I'll get you out of there, alright, dear?”</p>
<p>The incantation needed was long, but soon rewarded. There was a sudden sound, similar to a ‘poof,’ and the cell opened. </p>
<p>When the glass disappeared completely, Queenie removed the navy fabric that still obscured the mysterious Mathilda from view.</p>
<p>Newt's first impression was that the girl seemed older than he had imagined. She was small, almost bone-thin, and had sunken dark eyes that almost disappeared behind her thick brownish-black hair. </p>
<p>Desperately, she showed them her wrists, bound and tied by some kind of magical rope. They were easy enough to remove. She then pointed to her ankles and mouth, looking a bit better as each binding was removed.</p>
<p>While Newt worked on her tied limbs, Queenie emptied the small compartment under her cell, per Tina’s instructions. It contained just a few things – a ring, a magic wand, and a small bag of money.</p>
<p>“Oh, dearest,” Mathilda said, softly. “Thank you, Queenie.”</p>
<p>“Have you been tied up since your trial?” Queenie asked, looking worried.</p>
<p>“Pretty much, yes –”</p>
<p>It seemed like she was going to add something else, but her eyes had traveled to Newt, and were watching him intently.</p>
<p>“You seem familiar,” she said. “Who –?”</p>
<p>But, as she spoke, Queenie had been helping her down from the cell – and she had fallen, unable to be supported by her barely used legs.</p>
<p>“I can't walk,” she said. “And I don't know why you want me out of here. I killed –”</p>
<p>“Someone's coming!” Tina yelled from the door. “Hurry!”</p>
<p>“I'm sorry, miss,” Newt said, stunning her to unconsciousness with a spell.</p>
<p>Queenie let out a strangled cry, but immediately saw how Newt popped his suitcase open, carried Mathilda in his arms, and asked her to close it and escape with Tina. </p>
<p>They would meet later.</p>
