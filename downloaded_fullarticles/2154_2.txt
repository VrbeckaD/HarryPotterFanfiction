    <p>“This is the worst idea you have ever had.  And that’s saying a lot,” Hermione looked at George and Fred, completely exasperated.  “I can’t believe <em>this</em> is what you came up with for Halloween costumes,” she gestured vaguely at them both, hand moving in a circular motion, taking in their disguises, and the item Fred held in his hand.</p><p>“What?  These costumes are bloody brilliant!” Fred said with a cheeky grin, which looked out of place on the face he currently sported.</p><p>“Haven’t you ever heard of the saying ‘Too much too soon’?” the petite witch asked the duo.</p><p>“No such thing, love,” George told her confidently, the smirk on his face eerily perfect for the person he was imitating.</p><p>“Plus, you said you didn’t want to dress up, and now you don’t have to in order to fit in with us,” Fred tried to assure her.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes at him.</p><p>The cheeky grin remained on Fred’s face when she put her hands on her hips and stared at him with a nearly blank face, waiting for him to crack.  He didn’t.  George did instead, pleading with her to play along.</p><p>“Please, Hermione?” George asked.  “Just for when we walk into The Leaky Cauldron and the gang sees us.  We’ll take them off right after.  Although if you want them on again later…” he trailed off suggestively.  She arched an eyebrow at him, but didn’t say no to either the now bit <em>or</em> the later bit.  The twins’ faces broke out in wide grins, although with their transfigured faces, bodies, and attire they were not at all identical this evening.</p><p>Hermione knew which twin was which by their little mannerisms, but she had a feeling they wouldn’t be telling anyone else who was whom while out at the bar tonight.  With a good-natured groan of defeat, she held out her wrists to Fred, and he snapped the handcuffs into place.</p><p>This was the first Halloween after the end of war, and from up in the twins’ flat above their shop, it was evident that it was going to be a wild night, based upon the noise level in the street below.  The jokesters had barely managed to get their store back open two weeks before the new school term began at a rebuilt Hogwarts.  When September 1<sup>st</sup> came, they’d breathed a sigh of relief, before going straight back to work to replenish their bare shelves – stripped by the students who came through as they shopped Diagon Alley for school supplies.  With less traffic, the twins could build back up a comfortable amount of stock while still filling owl orders.  It wasn’t until just a week or two ago when they’d achieved a comfortable level of inventory, and deemed it time to start working on inventing again.  The two redheads felt a serious need to let loose tonight.</p><p>Hermione had been sorely tempted to take up Minerva’s offer to return to Hogwarts to finish her schooling and sit for her N.E.W.T.s.  Until the two wizards she’d been secretly seeing made her a deal.  Go public with their relationship, move in with them, become a business partner, and the three of them would study for N.E.W.T.s together, outside of school.  Come next June, all three of them would sit the tests together.  Molly’s chagrin over the situation of Hermione <em>living</em> <em>in sin</em> with her sons was quickly overshadowed by her elated reaction upon hearing that the two hooligans would be getting some N.E.W.T.s after all.  Not that it stopped the matronly witch from constantly dropping hints about a wedding.</p><p>“I would like to go on official record.  This is an awful idea, and I will be saying ‘told you so’ at least once tonight,” Hermione said with her nose in the air, as she turned to walk down the stairs to head out to the bar.  Actually, there was one good part, but she wouldn’t admit it out loud.  She was totally getting away with going out in a pair of comfy jeans and a jumper.  After all, being someone’s captive didn’t entail dressing up.  “Do you want to place wagers on how many times you get hexed tonight, walking around looking like that?”</p><p>“A Galleon that Harry’s first spell fired at us is an <em>Expelliarmus</em>,” Fred said, as he followed behind her, a skip in his step.</p><p>“Two on Ron trying to hit us with a <em>Levicorpus</em>, but missing,” George added, flicking off the lights as he brought up the rear.</p><p>Hermione laughed, realizing that it was going to be a very <em>interesting</em> night hanging out with the twins dressed as Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle, alongside her as their captive.</p><p>
