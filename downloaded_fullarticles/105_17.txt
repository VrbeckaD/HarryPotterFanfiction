    <p>It was the evening of the Yule Ball. Hermione was in Gryffindor Tower with all the other girls finishing up their hair and makeup when a knock at the door interrupted their nervous chattering - the first of their escorts for the evening had arrived. Well, everyone else had been talking. Hermoine was trying not to worry her bottom lip to shreds with her teeth. This was her first formal dance and she was to be accompanied by the Durmstang Triwizard Champion, Viktor Krum. Her! The Insufferable Know-It-All, the Gryffindor Princess, the bossy bushy-haired bookworm, or her favorite (not), the Library with Legs was going to be the center of attention for the Champion's Dance along with the other three champions and their dates. The very thought of it made her stomach lurch uncomfortably. </p><p>Why had she agreed to this? Of course, she knew how to dance. That wasn't the problem. Hermione's concern was one clueless ginger by the name of Ronald Weasley. As with anything else, he had waited until the very last moment to ask her to the Ball and when she had politely told him she already had a date, he had lost his temper and called her a liar. Well, he would soon be eating his words. What an absolute arse! And to think, she had wasted so many nights dreaming that they could become better friends and, maybe, even go on a date this year. But, no more. She would show him and all those other chowderheaded boys that she was definitely a witch not to be taken for granted.</p><p>                 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>

When Hermione and Viktor arrived and were announced, you could have heard a pin drop around the elaborately decorated Great Hall ballroom. Eventually, the shock wore off and the not so subtle comments began. 'That can't be Hermione, she never looked that good', 'How did she manage to get a date with Krum?' Obviously, she used a love potion or a spell on him'. 'Naw, she probably found a better use for her mouth than talking.'

Viktor felt Hermione tense with each passing remark and turned her to face him. Unshed tears glistened in her eyes. Taking her hand in his and placing a tender kiss to her palm, he whispered, "Ignore dem, my Hermi-own-minny. Dey aren't vorth your tears. Come. Let's show dem vhat has been under deir noses all dis time." After a formal bow and curtsy, they strolled onto the dance floor. </p><p>                 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ </p><p>After her initial upset from the crude opinions that greeted them on their arrival, Viktor had made sure her night had been a dream come true. He had been at her side the majority of the evening, leading her through most of the dances and making her laugh with tales of his own missteps in flying and potions classes. The only time he had agreed to step aside was when a select few people had wanted to waltz with her. Harry had smiled at her while they slowly twirled about, telling her that she was lovely, and hoped she was having a wonderful time. And, sweet natured Neville was genuinely pleased that his friend was being treated with respect by the Quidditch star like she so deserved.</p><p>The real shocker of the night had been during the teacher-student dance. After Headmaster Dumbledore had taken his obligatory turn about the room with Hermione, he had placed her hand onto the arm of the unsuspecting Professor Snape. At first, both of them looked like they had been hit with stunners but, as the music started, Dumbledore gave them a gentle nudge towards the center of the ballroom, his blue eyes twinkling with mischief. After their initial surprise had worn off, Snape bowed to Hermione and lead her in a graceful foxtrot - much to the surprise of everyone watching the pair but, especially, Hermoine. Who knew that the snarky potions master could dance like that! It had left her breathless and more than a little confused at the feelings it stirred in her chest. As to how it affected the professor, his face was a cool blank mask but, as soon as the dance was done, he returned Hermione to Viktor and fled from the room like his feet were on fire. In passing, he shot death glares at the now chuckling Headmaster and Professor McGonagall.</p><p>But, now, Hermione was livid. Her anger causing her magic to spark from her fingertips and her nigh-sentient hair to writhe about her head like a nest of pissed off snakes. The red-headed menace that was Ronald Weasley just had to step in and threaten to ruin everything with his tirade about flirting with the enemy when she should be with him as a proper girlfriend. The nerve of that sodding git! For months he had ignored her, only bothering to acknowledge her existence when he needed help with his homework. Hermione quickly stalked off in a huff before she hexed him. The clueless twit actually believed he had finally gotten her to see sense and that she would soon return to where she belonged - beside the other Gryffindors but, in particular, to him.</p><p>                        _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>
After leaving the witless weasel, Hermione strode up to the lead singer of the Weird Sisters, Myron Wagtail, and asked for a favor. After listening to her proposal, he broke into a conspiratorial grin and thought 'This should be fun'.</p><p>As the band took up their positions, Myron called everyone's attention to the stage saying that they had a guest singer for a specially requested number. With a dramatic wave of his hand, Hermoine appeared next to him and stepped up to the magically charmed mic. "This is just for you, Ron," she purred.</p><p>
The twit in question sat back on his chair with a smug look on his face. 'Finally,' he thought, mistaking her words for acceptance of his plans for the two of them. 'You'd think The-Brightest-Witch-of-her-Age would have figured it out before now that I'm the best she could hope for being a muggleborn and all.'  Lost in his own self-important musings, he missed the evil gleam in Hermione's eyes.</p><p>The lights dimmed, a soft blue spotlight focused on Hermione, and the music began.....</p><p>**"You don't own me....I'm not just one of your many toys....you don't own me...don't say I can't go with other boys..."</p><p>Suddenly, everyone's eyes were on the ginger-haired wizard at the center of Hermione's attention. As they watched, Ron's face had gone deathly pale before shifting into an alarming shade of red. At this point, Harry grabbed Ron's arm trying to keep him in his seat and prevent him from making a scene. "It's just a song, mate."</p><p>"Just a song!" snarled Ron. "Aren't you listening? Mione's telling the world that she's gonna date other people. She can't do that. She's my girlfriend, for Merlin's sake!"</p><p>" 'Cause you don't own me....don't try to change me in any way....you don't own me....don't tie me down 'cause I'd never stay..."</p><p>Pulling his arm from his friend's grasp, Ron growled, "Let me go, Harry. She has to be stopped. She has to be taught what it means to be a proper witch."</p><p>" 'She', is our friend," glared Harry, trying to pull Ron back by his robes. "And, Hermione's perfectly fine the way she is."</p><p>"I vould listen to Harry if I vere you," said Viktor. He had just returned from a brief meeting with Headmaster Karkaroff about the upcoming TriWizard task and was now standing next to the younger pair of wizards but, his eyes were focused on Hermoine.</p><p>"Sod off, Krum. This is a private conversation and it doesn't concern you," snapped Ron.</p><p>"You vere speaking of Hermi-own-ninny. She's my guest. This talk concerns me," smirked Viktor as he held Ron in place with a firm grip to the hot-tempered boy's shoulder.</p><p>"I'm free and I love to be free...to live my life the way that I want....to say and do whatever I please...."</p><p>As Hermione finished her song, she felt a sense of relief. If Ron wasn't clear about how she felt by now, then he truly was a complete numpty. But, that was not her problem anymore. She genuinely hoped that they could still be friends for Harry's sake but, she wasn't going to hold her breath. Only time would tell and, right now, she had better things to do.</p>
