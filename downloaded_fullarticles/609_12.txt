  <span>1st September 1972 – 12.00 o’ clock in the afternoon</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Severus and Lily had managed to secure a compartment for themselves. To avoid the Marauders, they decided to grab a compartment near the prefects, as not even the Marauders would be so idiotic as to attack them in front of so many powerful witnesses. They had darkened the compartment because Severus was, once more, fighting a strong headache. Lily had been so worried about those episodes last year, that she’d dragged him to Madame Pomfrey to have him checked over, but even the mediwitch had been unable to find the cause. She had advised them to darken the rooms they were in when he could feel the start of one of the headaches. Madame Pomfrey also suggested that Severus should start meditation or perhaps just keep his eyes closed, until it wore off.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>A soft knock on the door made Lily jump up and cautiously open the door, before letting Narcissa and her younger companion in. She relocked the door, and settled back on her seat, her charms book opened on the bookmarked chapter.</span>
</p><hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>Hello, Sev. I want you to meet my younger cousin Regulus Black. This is his first year, and I would appreciate it if you would show him around a bit”, Narcissa began, laying a cold hand on Severus’ forehead, hoping to soothe the headache that she knew was plaguing him.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>Sure, I can do that”, Severus replied softly. He turned to the new boy and said, “Hello, I’m Severus Snape </span><span>— </span><span>2nd year Slytherin House, nice to meet you.”</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>Regulus Arcturus Black, younger son of Orion and Walburga Black. My brother hates you</span><span>— </span><span>you know. But to be honest, that only speaks in your favour”, smirked Regulus.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Both looked shocked as an electrical jolt hit them when their eyes met, and their minds connected </span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span> welcome back, brother!” whispered a voice in both minds.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><span>Narcissa looked up and couldn’t believe her eyes. The same was true for Lily </span><span>—</span><span> as above the heads of both appeared a smoky figure </span><span>—</span><span> a giant wolf for Severus </span><span>—</span><span> and the name </span><span><em><b>Fenrir Lokison</b></em></span> <span>—</span><span> while for Regulus it was a giant snake and the name </span><span><em><b>Jörmungandr Lokison</b></em></span><span>.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Without even realising it, both started to use an old Norse Dialect and hugged the other boy closer, while tears of joy and sadness dropped from their eyes. “We died </span>
  <span>— </span>
  <span>how? What happened to father, Hela and our younger siblings?”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Regulus shivered, before switching back to English his eyes wide and fearful, “They drowned me. I was chained and unable to free myself </span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span> and you were chained, before this Asgardian prick rammed a sword through your mouth and into your brain, Fen.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>How could we have forgotten this? We need to find our Father. He is probably devastated. We had always known that the Allfather was a threat to us, but this? Father was loyal to him, anything that was asked of him, he did without hesitation. And this is how he thanked him? Imprisoning us, killing us because of a weird prophecy? No, I won’t accept it. We will find our father and our siblings, and then they will pay for all they have done to our family, brother mine”, Severus growled angrily.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>We need to go to Gringotts </span><span>— </span><span>only they can help us, Fen”, murmured Regulus, still not willing to let go of his older brother.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>You are correct. But nobody can know about us. I do not want to think about what that old coot would do if he should he learn about it. He is already biased against Slytherins. He would only exploit us”, Severus replied.</span></p><hr/>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Narcissa spoke up, not really knowing or understanding what she had seen, but because Severus is her friend and Regulus is her favourite cousin, she pledged “I, Narcissa Druella Black, swear on my magic and my life, that I will not tell anyone in any way or form, what has happened in this compartment without the explicit permission of Severus Snape and Regulus Arcturus Black. So mote it be.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Lily feeling the seriousness of the situation added her own vow. “I, Lily Rose Evans, pledge on my life and my magic, that I will not speak with anyone about what happened in this compartment, without the explicit permission of Severus Snape and Regulus Arcturus Black. So mote it be!”</span>
</p><hr/>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Loki visited his daughter in Helheim as both got hit by the backlash when Severus and Regulus shook hands. Hela looked at her father questioningly, before seeing a rare smile on her parent.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>It is Fenrir and Jörmungandr, they are on Midgard, Hela. I will travel there, seek out the Goblins and request their help. If the Norns and Fate are on our side, we will soon be reunited. Then we will ensure that those Asgardians pay for their crimes against our family”, Loki replied.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>Indeed Father, it is time to show them why we are feared. And what should we do about the mad titan </span><span>— </span><span>the titan who thinks he can court Death?”, Hela asked.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>Do not worry, my dear child. We will find a way to defeat him </span><span>—</span><span> after our family is reunited once again. As soon as I have found all four of my murdered children, and we are able to rescue Sleipnir from his forced servitude, I will be taking them to the US. I want you to stay with us, as well </span><span>— </span><span>we have already lost too many years without each other and we need to remain close”, Loki commented.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>I would like that, and I know exactly </span><span>who </span><span>should be a replacement for me, as sovereign of this peaceful realm. She is currently one of the female ghosts at Hogwarts, but I am sure that I can convince her to take my place after I have taught her the basics. I believe that Helena Ravenclaw will do a good job father”, Hela smirked.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“<span>That is a good idea, Hela. You have been a great help to me. Without you I would not have been able to hide our family from Heimdall’s spying eyes. I will send you a message, should I learn more about your brothers. Be careful, we really do not know how much sanity the Allfather has lost during the last millennia”, Loki warned worriedly.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Hela nodded, and hugged her father once more before returning to her royal duties. Tomorrow she would summon Helena and offer her the chance of becoming her successor to the throne of Helheim.</span>
