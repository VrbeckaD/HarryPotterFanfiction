    <p>Alphard walked besides him on their way to the platform.</p>
<p>Around him, Sirius could feel the eyes, the whispers, even as their owners tried to hide their shock, and -Sirius realized wryly as a young girl was almost cruelly yanked out of his path by her mother- their fear. He swallowed the annoyance and urge to lash out at someone and continued walking, reminding himself that if he were in their position he would probably be doing the same, though probably not openly gawking the way some of those bastards saw it fit to do.</p>
<p>The London air was still stuffy and bitter, the sky still covered in grey with no sign of the sun; it was exactly the way he had remembered it, perhaps now made even worse by his reluctance to be there. As yet another flustering woman gaped wide eyed and slack jawed in his direction, Sirius’s jaw tightened and he wondered if exiling himself to 3 years of this was actually worth it.</p>
<p><em>Maybe Beauxbatons would have me,</em> he thought. Or he could escape his families legacy all together and go to America. For a brief second, he entertained the fantasy.</p>
<p>“Sirius.”<br/> Alphard. Sirius glanced to his side, where his uncle was standing, and realized he had stopped walking. When he looked at where they were, sure enough, right outside the entrance to platform 9 ¾.<br/> Great.</p>
<p>“Are you sure-”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Sirius cut him off, because if he continued Sirius might just take him up on his offer to turn around and run back home like the scared little boy everyone thought he was, “I’m sure.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t, and he was sure it showed, but he didn’t give Alphard time to question him again. He squared his shoulders and walked through the wall, all his tension and frustration and anxiety coming back to him at twice the strength.</p>
<p>“Sirius.” Alphard pressed on as he appeared behind him, “You don’t have to do this.”</p>
<p>“I want to.” Sirius insisted, “I-”</p>
<p>He couldn’t explain it, but he felt almost as if he had to.</p>
<p>“Write if you need anything. Anything at all, even someone to vent to.” Alphard said, “I’ll be here.”</p>
<p>Sirius was thankful, and told him as much. Before he quite realized what he was doing, he had pulled his uncle in for a hug, one that once it started, he didn’t want to let go of. But eventually, it was almost time for the train to take off, and he had to pull away. Alphard, and all the patience and understanding that Sirius had come to appreciate so much the past few months of living with him, wasn’t going to be right there anymore, and Sirius had to admit he would miss it. Miss him.</p>
<p>He ignored the looks and the whispers and the questions -</p>
<p>
  <em>“Is that…”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“No, it can’t be-”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Sirius Black!”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Oh haven’t you heard?”</em>
</p>
<p>He ignored them all, because fuck them. What did they know? Besides who his family was and their stupid rumors and that fucking journalist and her fucking article about him in Witch Weekly: <em>The Disgraced Black Heir.</em></p>
<p>Sirius sneered. He was more than his family name. He had to be.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>The train ride was made longer by Sirius’ loneliness. No one wanted to sit next to the Black Heir so Sirius had a cabin all to himself. His restlessness got the better of him at one point and he got up to walk around the train, but he didn’t make it very far before the staring got to him again and he rushed back to the privacy of his own cabin.<br/> Unsurprisingly, when he got back, someone had scrawled across his trunk the words <em>Death Eater</em>. They had barely made it halfway to the castle and Sirius already felt exhausted. He quickly spelled the words away and slouched back into his seat, closing his eyes and hoping for some rest.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>He had been operating on auto-pilot for the rest of the evening, a skill he had perfected growing up around his family, and he wasn’t truly pulled out of it until he heard his name being called- “<em>Sirius Black will be joining the first years in their sorting tonight.”</em></p>
<p>He had known about this, and he was sure that the professor who had announced it, McGonagall, he vaguely remembered, hadn’t meant any harm by announcing it, but nonetheless, the sudden silence that immediately filled the hall coupled with the eyes that shifted in his direction didn’t help quell his anxiousness.</p>
<p>Besides him, Sirius heard a voice pipe up, “I’m <em>sure</em> he’s going to be in Slytherin. <em>Voldemort</em> was a Slytherin.”</p>
<p>“Well then I’m sure you’ll fit right in then you judgmental little-” Sirius’ insult died on his tongue as he turned to realize he was responding to a fucking first year.</p>
<p>He inhaled sharply and turned away from her, but she had gotten the message anyway. She didn’t speak again.</p>
<p>Sirius counted his blessings: at least McGonagall hadn’t announced that Sirius had been going to school at Durmstrang before now, although he was everyone already knew that anyway.</p>
<p>As the sorting commenced and Sirius realized he didn’t have much time to prepare himself as his name started with B, he began to feel nauseous. Trust the Black name to bring nothing but misfortune, he thought bitterly.</p>
<p>“Black, Sirius!” McGonagall called out, and at once the silence fell upon the hall again. It was so quiet you could almost hear a pin drop as Sirius walked up towards the front and took a seat on the bench provided.</p>
<p>McGonagall wordlessly placed the Sorting hat on his head, and Sirius didn’t really know what he had been expecting, but it certainly wasn’t:</p>
<p>
  <em>“Ah! A Black!”</em>
</p>
<p>He almost jumped out of his seat, and the hat giggled. Fucking <em>giggled</em>.</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” He said under his breath. McGonagall peered down at him but said nothing.</p>
<p>“Hmm… ah yes. I see a lot of potential- A lot of… ambition… determination… You’d do well in Slytherin- <em>Oh!</em> That was a strong reaction. <em>Not</em> Slytherin, then?”</p>
<p><em>They hate me enough as it is</em>. Sirius thought, <em>Put me in the house of the Dark Lord and they’ll hate me even more.</em></p>
<p>“Mhmm, I see. Well you’ve certainly got a lot of nerve… and you’re… desperate to prove yourself. There’s a lot of good, even if you aren’t aware of it… Very difficult, difficult indeed. Not Slytherin, you say? Well then, Sirius Black… I look forward to seeing what you do in… <em>GRYFFINDOR!</em>”</p>
<p>The hat bellowed the last word to the rest of the hall, and Sirius looked down just in time to see his tie turning red and gold, the colors of the Gryffindor house. He felt relieved at not being put in Slytherin, and definitely a bit elated at where he <em>had</em> been placed, but the Gryffindor house looked skeptical at this proclamation at best. Nonetheless most of them clapped, albeit halfheartedly, as he walked over to them.</p>
<p>He was beginning to lose that little bit of hope as he struggled to find a seat, struggled to not show his disappointment as one girl scooted around to pick up more space on the bench so Sirius wouldn’t sit next to her. And then a gangly looking boy with thick framed glasses poked his hand into the air and waved him over, “Oy! Black!”</p>
<p>Sirius was immediately aware of the boy’s friend circle as each of them was now staring at him as though he had lost his mind. Sirius briefly debated if it would be more awkward for him to politely decline or go sit with them. His feet didn’t give him much room for deliberation, however, and he soon found himself next to them, hovering uncertainly.</p>
<p>“You gonna sit, mate?” Glasses-boy asked.</p>
<p>“Um… right. Yeah.” Sirius sat in the space glasses-boy had made for him. The Friend Group was now directing their attention to pointedly avoiding meeting Sirius’ eyes, talking in high pitched voices about things that were of clearly no other purpose than to avoid the silence that would inevitably settle in if someone wasn’t talking.</p>
<p>Glasses-boy didn’t get that memo.</p>
<p>“So.” He said to Sirius, “A Black, huh?”</p>
<p>Any warmth Sirius had felt towards Glasses-boy instantly evaporated as he nodded stiffly.</p>
<p>“I prefer just Sirius, actually.”</p>
<p>Glasses boy nodded, “Alright, Just Sirius. I’m James.”</p>
<p>He stuck out a hand which Sirius stared at a moment too long before shaking.</p>
<p>“These are my friends. Peter, Remus, Dorcas, Marlene and my ever lovely wife to-be Lily.”</p>
<p>The girl he called Lily rolled her eyes, but she was smiling as she replied, “Only in your dreams, Potter.”</p>
<p>Almost instinctively, Sirius turned, “Potter?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, yeah. James Potter.” James said absentmindedly, “Why?”</p>
<p>“Well it’s just… my family sort of hates yours.” Sirius admitted sheepishly.</p>
<p>James frowned, “To be fair, from what I’ve heard, your family hates everyone.”</p>
<p>The silence Sirius had been dreading earlier came.</p>
<p>Sirius bit his lip, “Not true,” He said quietly, “They don’t hate themselves. Their egos are actually something to be admired.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>And then, “Good thing our families don’t always determine who we are, then.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Sirius said, looking around the small circle who all regarded him peculiarly, “Good thing.”</p>
<p>A loud applause broke out around them as the sorting came to an end, and the Headmaster announced the beginning of the feast.</p>
