    <p align="center">Ultimate Guide To The Multiverse<br/>Written By Jake Silver</p><p align="center">The Multiverse is a big place, one that's always changing, so I have decided to write a guide book for it. In this book, I will catalogue every universe I, and my helpers, know about.</p><p align="center">This page will tell you the basics:<br/>-How to traverse the Multiverse<br/>-What classifies as a 'Dimension'<br/>-What classifies as a 'Sub-Dimension'<br/>-What a 'Dimensional Collective' or 'False Multiverse' is<br/>-What classifies as a Dimensional Society</p><p align="center">How To Traverse The Multiverse<br/>The Multiverse is a big place, with a lot of different locations. However, not many of these locations have easy connections, so you will often need to use magic or technology to move from universe to universe. One common way of doing this is using a portal gun, such as the one used by most versions of Rick Sanchez. Another way is 'Breaching', a power used by people known as 'Breachers' to open 'Breaches' to other dimensions (that sentence is horrifying, I will never forgive DC Comics). However, in an emergency, you can hail a cab. There will be a chance, if you're in great need of it, that it will be 'The Cosmic Cab', a cab driven by an ancient Djinn that will give you a ride to anywhere in the Multiverse in exchange for a treasured item of yours, unless you need the ride for a love-based reason, in which case, he normally gives it to you for free.</p><p align="center">What Classifies As A Dimension<br/>You are in a Dimension. A Dimension is an almost infinite space, and can't be accessed from another Dimension without a portal or magic or technology.</p><p align="center">What Classifies As A Sub-Dimension<br/>A Sub-Dimension is a Dimension inside another Dimension. Bags Of Holding are often Sub-Dimensions, Final Space is a Sub-Dimension, Heaven, Hell, The Underworld.. all Sub-Dimensions.</p><p align="center">What Is A Dimensional Collective<br/>A Dimensional Collective is a set of Dimensions that have built-in connectors. Often, Dimensional Collectives will be mistaken for the entire Multiverse. Famous examples of Dimensional Collectives include The Arrowverse and The 16 Realms.</p><p align="center">What Is A Dimensional Society<br/>A Dimensional Society is one nation that spans several dimensions or is built of people from several dimensions. They are normally started in one of two ways. Either, people in a Dimensional Collective start working together and eventually end up as one nation, or an Inter-Dimensional Traveler leaves a piece of tech or magical artefact behind by accident.</p><p align="center">The rest of this book will be used to teach you about different Dimensions, Sub-Dimensions, Dimensional Collectives, and Dimensional Societies, and how to survive while exploring them.</p>
