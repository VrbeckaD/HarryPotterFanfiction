  <span>Harry did not like being the center of attention, nor did he much enjoy dancing, so having his every dance move analyzed and critiqued as he spun Parvati carefully across the floor. Harry was, however, a Gryffindor through and through, so he kept dancing longer than was strictly required, trying to present a bravery and elegance he did not feel. When a Durmstrang boy probably two years older than him asked if he could cut in, Harry let out a sigh of relief and nodded, retreating to the refreshment table. He stood there for a few moments, drinking punch and watching the couples around him twirl and stomp in perfect rhythm. Harry wondered, as he watched, how it was that he could fly a broom to distract a dragon, but couldn’t muster up the nerve to ask a girl to dance with him.</span>
</p><p>“Hi, Harry,” Cedric said from behind Harry. Harry started so violently he almost spilled punch down himself.</p><p>“Hey, Cedric,” Harry said, turning around <span>and looking up at the other Hogwarts champion</span>, “Are you having fun?”</p><p>“Loads,” Cedric said, “Cho’s an amazing dancer.” <span>He looked out across the hall, where Cho was talking to some girls in her year, and waved. She smiled and waved back. </span></p><p>
  <span>Harry grimaced as Cho saw him and smiled slightly. Cho had probably told Cedric that Harry had asked her, and Harry tried his best to tamp down the jealousy rising in his stomach. It wouldn’t look good for him to start a fight with his fellow Hogwarts champion, not when his status in the tournament was so scrutinized as it was. “I bet she is.”</span>
</p><p>“Are you alright, Harry?” Cedric asked<span>, tilting his head and looking at Harry with his eyes wide and his eyebrows knit.</span></p><p><span>Harry shrugged, Cedric’s concern, though apparently genuine, making him uncomfortable. </span>“I don’t know,” Harry said, “I guess I just don’t like big parties, especially when everyone’s watching me.” Harry laughed awkwardly. “And I’m not a great dancer.”</p><p>Cedric smiled. “I remember being fourteen. It feels like the whole world is watching, waiting for you to mess up. I guess it must be even worse for you, huh?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry laughed, “I mean, part of the reason I like playing Seeker is people are only watching you for a few seconds instead of the whole game.” Harry scratched the back of his neck. “But I’m probably sucking all the fun out of your evening, huh?” He laughed hollowly.</p><p>“No, you’re fun, Harry,” Cedric laughed, and Harry felt his skin warm. <span>“I know the tournament’s hard, especially for you, but don’t let that get in the way of living. Fourth year can be so great. After all, it’s your last year before OWLs.” Harry nodded slowly. </span>“Well, I should probably get back to Cho.” Cedric clapped Harry on the shoulder. “I’ll see you later, Harry.” Harry felt warmth where Cedric’s hand had met his back and watched him go.</p><p>“Uh, Harry, do you want to dance with me?” Harry looked around to see Susan Bones. “Just one dance?”</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, of course,” Harry said. He let Susan pull him onto the dance floor. Once the music started, he led her over to where Cho was dancing with Cedric. Harry didn’t take his eyes off them all evening.</span>
