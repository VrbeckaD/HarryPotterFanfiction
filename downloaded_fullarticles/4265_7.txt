  <p><em>"It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be."</em><br/> -Albus Dumbledore</p>
  <p align="left">Once, long ago, there had been a time when I did not know who Walburga Black was. I knew the name like I knew the names chronicled onto the flyleaf of my mother's journal, stained in ink and swirled in her beautiful calligraphy—"Your forefathers and foremothers, sweet," she said when I asked her of the long column of names. "Many will tell you that greatness runs through your veins, pure and strong, but remember that true greatness is not found within, it is earned. Heed this, love, an entire garden can be outshone by the merest rose,"—I knew the name Walburga Black, but I did not know who she was.</p>
  <p align="left">How quickly that changed.</p>
  <p align="left">I remember very little of the life I had been born into. Growing up in Grimmauld Place, there were moments when my mother's voice echoed into my thoughts, triggered by the smallest stimulus: a silk shawl, the faint and heady scent of a leather-bound book, the mother-of-pearl dryad etching on the backside of Narcissa's hand-mirror. My father was never far from these vestiges either, because I saw glimpses of his warm eyes in the brushstrokes of the painting outside Sirius's bedroom, and sometimes the statuette in the garden, nearly besieged and overgrown by ivy, bore the same curvature of his face if I stared long enough.</p>
  <p align="left">More than anything, I remember the night I had first met Walburga Black. There were, however, fragments of my parent's speaking her name long before that; once, when my mother added Walburga as a guest to a dinner party, and another, far more vague, when I thought I had seen my father speaking to a imperious-looking woman's head in his study's fireplace.</p>
  <p align="left">That night from long ago, when I was little over six years old, when I had first truly met Walburga in the flesh, I had been more than terrified, but harrowed. Outside, a blizzard was raging and I remember the snow descending from my bedroom's fireplace, the stone masonry steadily becoming blanketed with white, and wondering when my father was coming to wave his wand and rekindle the firewood, warming the floor, warming me—why my mother hadn't come to kiss me goodnight.</p>
  <p align="left">Inside, down below, something much more horrible than my childish impatience was occurring.</p>
  <p align="left">I remember the darkness first, the shroud that immediately eclipsed the beam of moonlight outside my window and snuffed each crystallized breath I took. The blackness had settled far too quickly, permeating every inch of my bedroom, but even more abrupt was the ear-splitting <em>crackle</em> that erupted through the floorboards from below. It lasted for all of a moment, the width of time between a heartbeat, but it had jarred straight into my bones, making me breathless and wide-eyed with terror.</p>
  <p align="left">The silence that followed lasted an eternity.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, there were voices. Loud, vicious snarls and shouts sounded from below my bedroom, so close, too close, but the voice sounded almost serpentine to my frightened child's ears; immediately I had imagined the basilisk pictured in one of my mother's books, coiling and springing its taut scales up the stairs for me, hissing louder and louder and <em>louder</em> until–</p>
  <p align="left">The door opened. The voice had stopped, and I had felt as though a specter had paralyzed me into its hold. A woman, tall and very statuesque, came rushing inside, her carmine robes billowing out from behind. Her eyes were hard and glinting like a moonbeam catching a rip in the sea. Before I could move or gasp or cry out, her arms were around me and constricting my spine to her chest and chaffing the frilly lace of my nightgown against my skin when I tried to squirm away.</p>
  <p align="left">She immediately clasped a hand to my mouth, the other clutching with white, bloodless knuckles.</p>
  <p align="left">"Do not speak, little girl, in the case the he hears you and changes his mind," she said, breathing sharply. "As is your right, you will be watched from here on out. <em>No questions</em>."</p>
  <p align="left">No questions.</p>
  <p align="left">I quickly learned that she was not referring to my strange right to be watched, but that I did not have the right to question the strange happenings from that night. No questions, no right; it was a hard lesson to be taught. Yet from the moment she Apparated my terrified six-year-old body from my family's moorland manor to a London townhouse, one that was smaller but far less welcoming, to when I was introduced to two curious, stormy-eyed boys, to the expanse of time I essentially became a part of the Black family, and, eventually, a Slytherin—I chronicled my own list of questions, all imprinted into the flyleaf of my mind, not unlike my mother's journal.</p>
  <p align="left">There were so many questions, and, <em>oh</em>, how I wanted to ask, wanted them answered.</p>
  <p align="left">How, more than anything, I wanted my parents.</p>
  <p align="left">But I remembered. I remembered every unasked question, every unanswered question. I remembered everything of the night that my parent's were inexplicably killed. I remembered everything of the night that Walburga Black had saved my life.</p>
  <p align="left">It took me another six years to understand that it was Walburga Black who had saved my life from Lord Voldemort—a discovery that wouldn't have been uprooted if not for Walburga's youngest son, who was self-possessed and intelligent and inscrutable, who only showed his true feelings to those who had earned his trust, and more to the rare few he loved.</p>
  <p align="left">It would take me another four years to understand why she had saved me, and if only I had known that such a consequential revelation would be unearthed with Walburg's eldest son—the outcast, the Gryffindor, who was undauntable and passionate and headstrong, who would have made a great Slytherin with his trickster ways, a proud Death Eater with his resoluteness, who knew more right from wrong because he had sacrificed everything to be <em>who</em> he was rather than <em>what</em> he was.</p>
  <p align="left">If only that had mattered in the end.</p>
