    <p>After the war, Harry was lost. Or rather, he didn't know what to do with himself. </p><p>He and Ginny ended up not working out. Harry found the attraction he had for her was just something he fell into when he thought he was going to die and would never have the pleasure of having a girlfriend or a romantic interest in his life. It didn't help he couldn't stop staring at Charlie Weasley's biceps rather than his girlfriend's curvy features. </p><p>They broke it off when Harry was 100% sure he was gay and didn't want to string her along any further. She ended going back out with Dean Thomas again less than a month later. She obviously wasn't too hurt by the breakup, and thankfully there wasn't any bad blood between them after the fact.</p><p>Then there was Auror training. Ron and Harry both lasted maybe two years before they both go tired of chasing the bad guys. Ron went to work for George at the shop, and Harry had enough money to take his time to think about what direction he really wanted to do. </p><p>He thought about obtaining a DADA Mastery under Kingsley but ultimately decided against it. He thought about becoming a teacher, maybe open up a daycare for younger kids, but felt that he wouldn't be the right person for the job. Another billion ideas flittered through his head as the days went on. </p><p>He even briefly considered becoming a muggle pole dancer just for the hell of it. It was worth mentioning to Ron and Hermione just to see the looks on their faces. They were rather prude when it came to those things. </p><p>So he filled his days with volunteering at Hogwarts, at various orphanages that were filled to the brim because of the war, as well as St. Mungo's. He often visited Teddy and Andromeda every other day to play with Teddy and to chat with Andy. She always had wise words for when Harry was feeling down and unmotivated. </p><p>He cherished them both. </p><p>Harry also spent a lot of time at Gringotts sorting through the Potter and Black Vaults, as well as taking classes on the responsibilities and expectations of a Lord. Due of all the time spent at the bank, the goblins tended to be a little softer towards Harry than they were before because he put in extra effort to learn the ways of the goblins and gave them the respect they deserved. </p><p>It was also at Gringotts where Harry was offered a new way life by an old... friend. </p><p>--</p><p>"Good morning Ragnark," Harry greeted the goblin as he sat down in his office, "Your letter was very vague when you summoned me. Is there something I should worry about?" </p><p>The goblin gave Harry a hard look before sighing and placing a few documents down on his desk for Harry to see, "I believe you should be a bit worried, Lord Potter. I was looking through your family history as you had requested during our last meeting and found some interesting information." He slid the documents towards Harry to give him a closer look. </p><p>The sheets of parchment had lists of names. Names of his older ancestors and relatives, they were mainly the first Potters and Blacks to his parents and him. Even though he was not blood-related to the Black family, (he was but too distantly to have any real claim without Sirius making him his heir), their family tree was as much his as the Potter tree was. But there was also another document that had a lot of red ink sprawled across the parchment. </p><p>"What is this supposed to say?" Harry asked in a confused tone. </p><p>"This is an inheritance tree, more specifically, your tree. As well as a document we found to be hidden between the sheets of your family tree. This document really should have been filed in The Ministry, which prompts the question of why it is here in the first place." The goblin sighed and looked quite angry as he prepared his next works. </p><p>"This document, Lord Potter, proves the prophecy you have lived your life by has been falsified." </p><p>Harry shot up in an instant, "No. No, that can't be true," He protested, his entire world felt as if it was falling apart from a single sentence. All he could think of was all the lives lost because of the prophecy that wasn't even <em>real</em>.</p><p>"I am sorry to inform you of this, I know this is a lot to take in," Ragnark said full of genuine sympathy. </p><p>"But," Harry trailed off, slowly sitting back down and running a hand through his hair, "How can this be?" </p><p>"I don't believe I would be the best one to explain this," The goblin started, "Upon the discovery of this evidence, someone arrived this morning specifically because of this." </p><p>"Who?" Harry demanded.</p><p>The Goblin ignored Harry's demand, "It would be better for me to bring them in." He said simply and didn't wait for Harry's nod before he left the office to retrieve whoever this someone was. </p><p>Not even a minute later, Ragnark walked back into his office with a tall man behind him. </p><p>The man was tall, much taller than Harry's five-foot-six. His skin was a deep caramel color that made his amber eyes even more profound against his skin. He wore grey wizarding robes that seemed a few years out of date. He did not look familiar at all. </p><p>"Hello Harry," The man said, "It's good to see you again, but I assume the circumstances are not in your favor." </p><p>"Who are you?" Harry asked, not wasting time with being polite. Fear was racing through his veins. </p><p>The man smiled, "I'm hurt that you don't remember me," He gently brushed his fingers against Harry's cheek, "My, have you grown, and quite nicely might I add." He dropped his hand and grinned at the flush on Harry's cheeks, "I suppose it would be easier for you to remember me if I took a different form?" He said with a quirk of an eyebrow. </p><p>"What?" </p><p>Harry watched with nervous anticipation and fascination as the man's face morphed from the handsome face he walked in with to the face of his old mentor, Dumbledore. More fear coursed through him. This was no man, no <em>human</em>.</p><p>"Hello, Harry. Do you remember me from Kings Cross? I am the one you spoke with when you died." </p><p>"But..." Harry was at a loss for words.</p><p>"I am Death, Harry. I take the form of what the passed person is most comfortable with. In your case, it was good ol' Dumbledore." He smiled and morphed back into his original form, "Now back to why I am here. I have been waiting for this document to be found, waiting for you to mature to understand the offer I am willing to make, for you Harry." </p><p>"But how can you be here? How can <em>Death</em> be here? It doesn't make sense." Harry exasperated. </p><p>"That is what I am getting at. Be patient," He grinned, "You are very special, Harry Potter, so special that you have me wrapped around your little finger. The prophecy that was made that mapped out this little war you had in your world was falsified by none other than the man you admired most. Albus Dumbledore. I will give you the short version as to what he would say 'it was for the greater good' but really he just wanted a weapon.</p><p>"I know I am damaging the perfect image you have for him in your mind, but I don't care. He's not some sweet grandpa he liked people to believe. He was just as corrupted as Voldemort was. Back to why I am here. I am here to offer you a deal Harry because I have a soft spot for you and all that you have gone through." </p><p>"What kind of deal are you talking about?" </p><p>"The type of deal that will change everything. In all honesty, the war should not have ended the way it did, it should have been over before it even started. I wish to send you back in time to where you would have the most influence to prevent the war from even occurring." Death explained. </p><p>Harry was at a loss for words. He didn't know what to say to such a proposition, nor what he was supposed to say in response or acknowledgment. </p><p>What would this mean for all of his friends? What would happen to him if he changed something that affected his birth? Would he then cease to exist? Would Teddy be born if he changed the war? </p><p>"Ask your questions," Death said suddenly, taking Harry away from his thoughts, "I'm sure I have the answers you're looking for, I am older than time itself after all." </p><p>"How could I exist before my own timeline?" Harry asked slowly, his head still swimming with thoughts.</p><p>"Simple. I will create new documents with the help of the Goblins, they have already said they would cooperate, give you a new name, and no one will question a thing." </p><p>"What if I change something that prevents me from being born?" </p><p>"Now that is an easy answer," He said with a wide smile, "As I said, you are a very special boy, Harry. Your existence is a fixed point in time that even I can't change. Well, I could, but I don't wish to. No matter what you do in the past, you will more than likely prevent yourself from being born in 1980. There can be only one Harry Potter, after all, this meaning if Lily and James still end up together, their child will not be you, but a completely different Harry Potter, or maybe they will name him differently, or they might have a girl. Everything and anything can happen. I will also create a new family for you, new parents to legitimize your existence." </p><p>Harry bit his lip and furrowed his brows in deep thought. He could go back and change everything. He could make everything right for the ones he loved. But, he would be going back in time without knowing anyone or anything. </p><p>He decided it was a risk he was willing to make. </p><p>"Ok, what do I do if I go back?" He asked simply, taking death by surprise with how easily he accepted everything. </p><p>Harry knew however sometime in the future he would have a breakdown, but he didn't want to think about that yet. </p><p>With a mere wave of his hand, Death created a stack of documents and handed a few sheets to Ragnark and the rest towards Harry. </p><p>"Your new name will be Harrison Peverell, last male descendant of the three brothers. You are a pureblood wizard born to Diana Max, a Dutch pure-blood witch, and Rigel Peverell, a direct descendent from Ignotus. You are an only child born in 1920 Holland," Harry nodded along to the rundown of his new life, "I will be sending you back to 1941, you will be the same age of 21 in this time. I want you to work at Hogwarts, but I thought I would give you a choice of what you would like to do. I could make you the new Flight Instructor, which by default make you the Quidditch referee, or I could make you an apprentice under one of the current professors 1941." </p><p>"I think I'd rather be an apprentice, therefore I actually learn something if this is to be my new life," Harry drawled, slowly shutting down as he realized he was actually doing this, "Where did I go to school?" </p><p>"Durmstrang Institute. Now, under what subject would you like to apprentice in? I would assume Divination is out of the question because you did quite poorly," Death mused making Harry flush in embarrassment. </p><p>Harry nodded, "Can I think about it? I don't really know what I would wish to apprentice in so soon... But what am I supposed to do to prevent the war?" He whispered. </p><p>"That's simple, just be yourself. I know that by simply being there, you will change the course of history." Seeing that Harry was becoming nervous without any sense of direction, Death added, "Anything you do once you get there will not be a wrong thing. Just do what comes naturally, and everything will fall into place. And do please take your time in choosing." Harry could tell that he knew something he wasn't telling Harry, but there wasn't much he could do about it. </p><p>"Can I say goodbye to everyone? Or do I simply need to disappear? When do I have to go?" </p><p>"The sooner the better," He stated, "But I will give you a week to prepare yourself. You may say goodbye to your friends, but only give them the minimal amount of information, or make them take a vow." </p><p>"Won't I erase their current existence by going to the past?" Harry wrung his hands in a very un-Lord like manner.</p><p>"You are asking very intelligent questions, Harry," Death praised, "Yes and no, depending on the significance of what you change when you go back. If it is minimal, such as just preventing Voldemort from creating his Horcruxes, but he is still a mad psychopath, you will create a fork in the timeline where you land in 1941. Thus this timeline will be intact along with the new one you make. However, if you manage to change something that is so profoundly impactful, the new timeline will eventually replace this one." </p><p>"Is that all?" Harry eventually asked. He really needed to go home and think about this all. </p><p>He was going to do it, he knew that, but he really needed to digest all the information. </p><p>"Yes. The Goblins will transfer your accounts into one that will be locked in the past that will not tamper too much with the Potter's accounts. I will be by in one week to give you the rest of the information that you will need." </p><p>Harry bid Ragnark a goodbye, as well as Death and left quickly. </p><p>He went immediately home and flooded directly to Hermione and Ron's home.</p>
