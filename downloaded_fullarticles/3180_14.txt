          <div class="userstuff"><p>I remember each Halloween they came to call.</p><p>The first time was after the war. As I laid a wreath on Harry’s grave, I sensed eyes upon me, watching me. I turned and caught only a glimpse of a swirling black cloak and then nothing.</p><p>It was not enough.</p><p>The second time, while I stood in the cemetery, they came so close to me that I could smell Severus’ intoxicating scent and the innocence that had been Harry drifting from them on the autumn breeze. They were shadowed together, and I could barely discern my best friend from the taller being. They seemed content with studying me. </p><p>But again, it was not enough.</p><p>By the third time, I longed to go with them into that dark night, tired of my life as it was. No words were spoken; when they beckoned, I willingly embraced the only men that had ever held my heart.</p><p>Even as their fangs slid into my flesh—Severus at my neck, Harry positioned just inside my thigh—I knew I had chosen wisely. I would not be seeing the next Halloween in a cemetery, but with my lovers, safe and forever whole.</p><p>Finally, it was enough.</p></div>
