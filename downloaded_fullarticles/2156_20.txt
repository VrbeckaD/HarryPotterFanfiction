  <em>Sambi,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hiya. Sorry, I haven't written very much this summer, things have been extremely busy around here with the Ministry, Percy, and Harry's hearing, which he did walk out with all the charges dropped by the way. Guess I'll start with the lighter news, I somehow was made a prefect along with Draco. Shut up, I know your thinking something. I bet you've already heard but Val's going to be going to Hogwarts this year. What house do you think she's going to be in? My money's on Ravenclaw.</em>

  <em>Fred, George, and I have created a lot more Wizard Wheezes, for example, Extendable Ears, Puking Pastels, Skiving Snackboxes, even a Portable Swamp. That last one was all them, not really sure how they even came up with the idea. Ended up meeting a really big handful of new people. Nymphadora Tonks is one of them, she's also a cousin of Sirius. Oh, just so you know I would refrain from calling Tonks, Nymphadora. For some reason she hates it. She's also a Metamorphmagus, which are a witch or wizard with the ability to change their physical appearance at will rather than requiring a Polyjuice Potion or spell.</em>

  <em>It's really rare and somewhat similar to an Animagus. Okay, the other people I met. My Aunt Natalie, who I haven't seen since I was a baby, along with my cousins Harmony, Darian, and Julius. There's also Rohan and Brianna, who are Harmony and Darian's Fiancees. Anyway, remember how I told you I was gonna try to become an Animagus, well I did it. As of last week, I became a fully registered three foot tall, six-foot-long black panther or Cougar with sapphire blue eyes. Not going to lie it's really strange being on four legs.</em>

  <em>Thankfully, Sirius has been giving me tips here and there when I need them. Oh, you should keep this in mind but Harry's been getting agitated more frequently. It seems as if you say one wrong thing to him and he'll just explode. I still know that the others are hiding something from me but I really haven't had the time or really want the knowledge of it. Anyway, I'm not sure how this year's gonna go and to be honest that frightens me a little bit. The only thing that we can do at the moment is hope that Fudge opens his eyes to the truth and prepare ourselves for the war that's on our doorstep. See you in a few weeks.</em>
