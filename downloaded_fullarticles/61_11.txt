  <b>PROLOGUE </b>
</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I sing creation songs until my throat grows hoarse then slip for six long months beneath the earth where you with your troubled eyes reside in wait with six red, juicy pearls upon a proffered plate.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will to my lord be faithful, says the first- and count the body's little deaths in strict reverse; yet the second will take none but chaste embrace to supplement the nearness of our resting place.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still the third aspires lingering descent, and will take sturdy, branching root if I relent, while the fourth works magic thick upon the skin: a pelt so hardy, groomed, the hearse cannot get in.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So the fifth sits between us, a chaperoning third that looks upon halved hardships,saying not one word. Yet the sixth, gut thread, binds us closer all the same: wound for open wound, in marriage by its pagan name.</p>
