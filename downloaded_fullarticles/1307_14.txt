    <p>He felt a shudder go down his spine when those emerald green eyes met his. It was a high society function, one of the many Otori Kyoya had attended in his short life. If you have seen one, you have seen them all.</p><p>Still, Kyoya kept up his polite face and impeccable manners on. He ignored the looks and the whispers and the gossip surrounding him, mentioning his name and position as the third son, the one not likely to get anything from the impressive family inheritance. What the majority of them did not know was that his father had confronted him two days into summer break. Apparently he had find out about how he had bout out the Otori group and given it back just like that. He had been impressed by his son. Kyoya had nothing to say to him. He could still feel the humiliation of being slapped in public even though the sting had long since faded.</p><p>This party was held by the Otori's to celebrate the birthday of his sister. Everyone who was anyone in the business world had been invited. Kyoya had seen other Host Club members there but he had been unable to greet them up until now. Seeing as Tamaki was his usual self that was not a particularly bad thing.</p><p>Yet all that was forgotten when his father introduced him to two of his European business partners. The Longbottoms, who had vast greenhouses and fields cultivating rare plants and herbs with medicinal value, and the Potters, who provided the Ootori clinics with the majority of the medicines used.</p><p>Still, never would have Kyoya expected the Potter head of business to be so young. Both he and Longbottom were in their teens, both eighteen in fact, barely adults by European laws. Longbottom was not very impressive appearance wise. He was tall and his face had many scars. The Ootoya third son recalled reading in the papers that terrorists had taken an elite boarding school in Scotland hostages. It had been the reason Ouran had updated their security.</p><p>Potter seemed to have escaped unscathed, though his eyes held a dark look that Kyoya did not even remember seeing in his father's eyes. It was chilling and dangerous and such a turn on that Kyoya was turned on just at the mere sight of those green orbs. They seemed to read him so deeply and so accurately. It was eery. It was also enticing to believe that someone, anyone, could look behind his aloofness, behind his masks and see him.</p><p>A blessing and a curse since what Kyoya truly was deep down, besides a hurt boy, was a dark heart with a retched soul. He knew how to use people, set the strings and manipulate and make them like it even. The title the Hitachiin Twins had bestowed him, and later Haruhi, the title of 'Shadow King' was not far off. He thrived in the shadows and he had for so long that he had forgotten what light was supposed to be. And those green eyes could see them, or at least that's what it looked like to Kyoya.</p><p>His father sauntered away and Longbottom stopped being a limpet that clang to Potter and this way it was just him and Potter.</p><p>For the first time in his life Kyoya was at a loss as to what he should say to this man? It was not an heiress or brainless girl at the Host Club that he could impress. And he wanted to impress, he wanted this man's attention, craved it even.</p><p>"You are the third son," was the first line the green eyed business man delivered to Kyoya. He was also smirking. "My best friend is the sixth son," he added then and the ire in Kyoya abated.</p><p>"Six kids?" Kyoya was horrified. They were four siblings and he was practically the black sheep of the family.</p><p>"Hm, yes, but I think we can find better subjects to talk about," Potter said.</p><p>Kyoya arched an eyebrow questioningly.</p><p>"For example, how would you like us to spend the night together. You see," here Potter inched closer to Kyoya, "I'd love to have you naked and sweaty under me, see those eyes of yours dark and wide with lust. How about it?"</p><p>Kyoya swallowed hard. The mental image of that alone was enough to tempt a saint and he was no saint, never had been. His grey eyes met green. "Why?" And hated himself because the question should have been 'what' or even better a 'how dare you'. Yet 'why' had escaped his lips first, betraying that he too was interested enough to at least consider. And the other man knew that if the way his eyes darkened and his lips curled upwards was an indication.</p><p>"My, you're a suspicious young fellow," the older man teased. "You are handsome; surely you know that?"</p><p>Kyoya did know that. He was told daily by a number of girls and boys. Even the other hosts often remarked on his aloofness and cool looks and classical beauty. But it was still not a reason enough. he was too into the political games to believe that someone wanted something so simple from him and he told Potter exactly that.</p><p>"Who said sex is simple?" was the man's reply.</p><p>"What other benefit do you get by accomplishing this?" Kyoya demanded.</p><p>"In many ways you are still a child, Kyoya," the European man commented. "All I currently want is you in my bed. That is merit enough for me. If you don't like my answer I can't do much because this is all I can give you. So, yes or no?"</p><p>"Where?" the grey eyed teen asked.</p><p>The smirk he got in reply was pure sin.</p>
