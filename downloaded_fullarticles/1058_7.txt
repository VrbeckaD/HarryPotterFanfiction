    <p>The darkness of the night shrouded any living souls’ presence as an icy thick fog surrounded the middle of the road. A row of houses mostly dark from the late hour held little motion of occupants save for two. Even the cats and dogs out on the street were absent as the witching hour approached. The stillness of the air belied the flow of the mist upon the hard-cracked concrete. A night like no other, the events would alter the course of history for every magical being in the world. </p>
<p>Three figures stood regally outside a small but comfy house in Godric’s Hollow. Proud and taller than the others stood a pale-skinned man with soft features, black hair and billowing but elegant black robes etched in purple lining. A three-headed dog sat obediently next to him watching the new mother and father in the little home. The woman next to him had long wavy golden hair over a silver robe with a green tunic. Her skin glowed in the night, but the colour changed every few seconds. No distinguishing race was apparent. </p>
<p>The last stood almost as tall as the first in blue and white robes. His head was bald and golden.<br/>
Manannán looked to his companions Chronus and Bedise. As his invisible mist hid them from view, Bedise turned to him. “We must be cautious, my friend. Omris is always trying to kill any and everything we plan. The child may be gifted, but she will turn his life to death if she can.”</p>
<p>“My dear lady, our Champion must know us. My mist will hide us until we are done. Chronus, do your eyes see any problem in the next hour?” Manannán asked his other friend.</p>
<p>Chronus’ deep beautiful but timeless eyes went a glowing white as he searched through the hour of time requested. As his eyes refocused on his friends, he spoke. “The murderess Omris will try for the parents once the vile creature steals into the home. If we speak to the little one first, they may yet live.”</p>
<p>“My friends, we must move now then. I fear something has spooked the rat into saying goodbye to his friends. That disgusting excuse of a wizard will be here momentarily.” Bedise cautioned her friends.</p>
<p>As one, their gracefully clad feet slid upon the ground and passed through the walls of the house. James was wearing a groove into the ground in the living room in worry. As the three floated up the stairs, they beheld Lily packing a bag with emergency supplies: An extra wand, potions, baby supplies and a strange looking map. When the three entered the nursery, baby Harry looked at them, smiled and cooed. He started reaching for Manannán for him to hold him in his arms.</p>
<p>With a quick look at Chronus, Manannán picked up baby Harry and held him close. Time slowed around them to a crawl, and they spoke to him ominously but with the gravest of concern.</p>
<p>“Little one, the next ten years will not be kind to you. But, if you want your parents to live, you must use the gifts you already possess. Our full gifts, you will receive when you’ve broken the two bindings that will occur soon. However, I bestow upon you a limited power over death.” Manannán handed the baby over to Bedise delicately after he finished. His face lit with a dazzling smile when the baby cooed at him.</p>
<p>“Oh, my lovely. We can’t visit you until the bindings are gone, that is true. However, you will never be alone, even when living with those foul humans. You will find your first companion when you get lost. She will help guide you, and she will lead you to your second companion. Always be true to yourself, my lovely.” Then, after Harry placed his hand on her cheek, Bedise handed him over to Chronus.</p>
<p>“My little warrior, we will meet again when the moon turns full and purple. You will have all your gifts muted, but shortly before we are reunited, your full power will fill your soul. Know that we will be thinking of you and love you dearly. You are our Champion for all time. The only gift I can give you for now is that of remembrance. May time always heal you and help you.”</p>
<p>When Chronus finished, he handed the baby back to Manannán. As the loving being of Death placed the baby back in his crib, a knock resounded through the little home. “We must take our leave now Champion, but never forget us. We are always around if you only but look. And remember, Life is the killer.” As James slowly went to get the door, Death, Fate and Time disappeared from the house. Baby Harry started bawling his shining emerald eyes out missing them already.</p>
