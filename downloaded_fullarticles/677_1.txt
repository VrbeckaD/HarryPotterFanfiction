    <p>
  <span>Dark times continue to persist, no matter what. When someone feels like they’re at the peak point of their life, there is someone, perhaps even someone nearby, who’s going through their lowest. But then there are times of widespread despair, of war and famine. Some embrace their pain, while some try to distance themselves from it. But no matter what, light comes after darkness. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>It has been nearly seven years since the end of the war since one of the greatest dark wizards of all time was defeated by a seventeen-year-old. There was a cost to power, oh, for sure. And He Who Must Not Be Named had been forced to pay. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She remembered all the parties and all the celebrations that summer. The pomp and fanfare. She remembered all the delicately worded invitations and the venom laced grievances. But she’d skipped all of it. She simply wasn’t in the mood for all that joy and cheer back then. The war had passed but it had taken its toll on her family. How else was she supposed to react but by turning into a recluse and eliminating contact with all her loved ones? It made sense in her mind, at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had taken time, but she had gotten over her loss. She had learned how to keep all those feelings under lock and key. It was all over and she didn’t need to think about it anymore. She’d moved on, really. The nightmares had lapsed and she could imagine a future for herself again. And now, she was a hundred per cent sure about what she wanted to do: protect others and fight those who could cause harm. She could never, ever let what had happened repeat itself. She knew better than not to learn from her mistakes. And that was why, after she finally gave her NEWTs in 2000, she applied for Auror training. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’d be lying if she said it was simple. She’d thought her seventh year at Hogwarts had been hard, but oh dear Merlin were the three years she was forced to face right after it much, much more difficult. She spent much of her time practising and reading up on the texts and techniques they were prescribed to learn. The few friends she managed to make were those she practised duelling with in the little spare time she had. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thanks to her commitment, she managed to make it through those testing years. She donned her red Auror’s robes with as much pride as she possibly could. She knew, honest to Merlin, that this was the best career option it could possibly have been. She was partnered up with a more experienced Auror, who was at times a bit patronizing, but generally agreeable. She spent most of her days helping muggles out of situations they shouldn’t ever have landed themselves into and casting memory charms to wipe their brains of entire incidents. But hey, Y/N knew any kind of job would eventually get boring. Also, she assumed it was better if they didn’t have as much </span>
  <em>
    <span>interesting</span>
  </em>
  <span> work for her to do, it meant her world was that much safer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that didn’t last much too long. She knew happiness wasn’t something that generally sustained itself in her life. She didn’t know it yet, but the paperwork was on the way. She was only a few months into her second year of service and was soon to be offered a promotion. Not exactly, actually. She was to be assigned a different partner. (One she had never, ever wanted to work with. One whose face still sometimes made her relive one of her darkest moments.) And not for a reason she was going to enjoy.</span>
