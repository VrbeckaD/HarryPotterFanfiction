          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Potter,” Draco spits the name out, and gives the other boy a dirty look when they meet in the hallways.<br/>
“Potter,” he whispers to himself, as a dirty little secret when he’s alone.<br/>
“Potter,” he moans quietly at night, stiff prick in his hand, his mind filled with dirty desires.<br/>
“Potter,” Draco whimpers, afraid for his life, hiding for the dirty deeds that are done in his house.</p><p>Potter, he thinks, but he tells his aunt that he can not be sure, her dirty breath filling his nostrils.</p><p>“Potter,” he gasps, when he sees the lifeless body with the dirty face, his heart painfully aching in despair.<br/>
“Potter,” he says stiffly when the man shows up to his house, bringing back the wand he stole from him with his dirty hands.<br/>
“Potter,” he sighs, and forgiveness was always a dirty word until now. Now it is offered to him.<br/>
“Potter?” Draco asks in disbelief when an embrace washes everything that once was dirty away.<br/>
“Harry,” He smiles, and the sun is warm and bright when he takes his hand.</p></div>
