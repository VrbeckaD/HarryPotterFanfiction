  <strong>Chapter 1: A Scattered Dream, But a Far Off Memory</strong>
</p><p>Harry woke up with a start, throat hoarse from the screaming he had done. As he panted, trying to regain his breath, Harry looked around the room and ensured that Ron was still snoring away. Sighing in relief that he hadn't woken the red head or anyone else in the house (Remus and Sirius in particular, considering their sharp hearing) with his screams, he muttered out, "They're getting worse..."</p><p>They, referred to his dreams. Dreams about <em>cedricmothergreenlightdementorsdeath</em>. But those were more recent. Even before his fourth year, he would often wake up to his own screams that were result of his strange nightmarish dreams, 'Or were they memories?' as Harry often wondered, of darkness, keys, a graveyard (Voldemort's resurrection didn't help with that), maddened orange eyes, light fading, and a sky. A sky that sat on a white throne, sleeping so soundly and about to be filled with darkness. Harry never did understand why he screamed the loudest for the last so often, screams that were often laden with fear and desperation.</p><p>But with those nightmares came good dreams. Dreams of a sunny island, a star shaped fruit, of wooden swords, play fighting, jealousy, and sitting on a beach staring at the wide open sky as stars fell. Dreams of a person he spent the most time with, one with sky blue eyes shining with light, laughter and love, bringing warmth and joy to his heart. Dreams of those same blue eyes shedding happy tears while hugging him like his life depended on it.</p><p>The dreams had been oddly active during his most recent stay with the Dursleys, leading to his 'uncle' (Harry used the term loosely. He never did consider the man family.) banging on the door to his room whenever his screams forced them awake. But the Dementor attack on him just made it worse, since the memories brought forth weren't those of his mother's death or those of the graveyard, but those of his dreams, in particular the one about the white throne. The feelings of helplessness, and the feelings of rage. Some how, he was able to push back the Dementor using a Patronus, but for some reason, the happy memory that brought it forth were those of the blue eyed sky.</p><p>Before Harry could comprehend what had occurred, Mrs Figg had appeared and taken him back to the Dursleys, he almost gets expelled, and days later, was retrieved and brought to Sirius' home. Rather upset about the information blackout and still sleep deprived, Harry had lost his temper with both Ron and Hermione, scaring them both. It was only thanks to the twins that he managed to calm down, knowing that he could depend on the two. And that was before he attempted to ask for some information on the on goings of the Order of the Phoenix. He fully relaxed when both Sirius and Remus gave <em>some</em> of the news he had been trying to find during the time at the Dursleys. It wasn't much, but he understood that with Voldemort laying low, he wouldn't have attempted to broadcast that he was alive.</p><p>With that, his first few days in Grimmauld Place passed by relatively fast…</p><p>At least before this recent bout of nightmares.</p><hr/><p>Fed up with his dreams messing up with sleep cycle, Harry quietly made his way to Buckbeak's room, knowing the hippogriff's presence would keep most of the Order members outside of Moody, Sirius and Remus out of the room. He hoped that he would be comforted in the presence of Buckbeak, that his dreams would not disturb him once he closed his eyes. However, Harry had not expected Sirius to be sleeping in the room, let alone wake up when he heard the soft closing of the door.</p><p>"Hn… Harry? What are you… *yawn* still doing up?" Sirius mumbled sleepily as he stretched from where he had been sleeping, which was underneath one of Buckbeak's wings.</p><p>Blushing over the fact that he had been caught, Harry just looked to the side and mumbled that he had been having nightmares. His godfather gave him an understanding look and helped Harry settle himself under Buckbeak's other wing, the hippogriff opening one eye before returning to sleep once they stopped moving his wings, curling his wings around the two.</p><p>Harry, knowing that Sirius would end up asking him about his dreams in the morning, closed his eyes as he heard the dog animagus fall back to sleep, resolving himself to telling the man about the dreams when they both awoke.</p><hr/><p>The next morning led to the whole house scrambling in search of Harry, with only Remus having some idea as to where he was, but he was not telling them any time soon. The ruckus woke the two in Buckbeak's room, and a rather irate Harry yelled at them all for making so much noise in the morning. In the end, only Sirius, Remus and the twins were able to approach him after his outburst, never asking where he had been the entire night.</p><p>Of course, the conversation with Fred and George consisted of going through prank ideas and wondering about who the Marauders were (Harry tried to hide his snickers at the rather pale look Remus and Sirius had when they overheard that topic). But when they made their way into Buckbeak's room, Harry was rather startled when their normally cheerful faces turned serious.</p><p>"Sorry about herding you here, Harry – "</p><p>"But we needed to get you some where that we could have a private chat."</p><p>"Hope you don't mind."</p><p>Harry just looked on in confusion as Fred ensured that no one else was following them before locking the door and George cast a privacy spell. Harry sighed, "Okay, why is it that you need to talk to me? It's not about the shop right?"</p><p>"Nope, not really," said Fred.</p><p>"But it does concern you," continued George, pointing at him. Harry just gestured the two to explain.</p><p>"It wasn't something we were fully aware of until third year…"</p><p>"But… please be wary of Ron and Ginny."</p><p>"Their intentions to be exact!"</p><p>"Those two have been obsessed with fame and fortune since they were kids – "</p><p>"And we know for a fact that having been told stories about you didn't help. Ginny's obsessed with marrying you."</p><p>"Your fourth year was a good example of how Ron normally is when fame comes into play – "</p><p>"A jealous, bullying, prat."</p><p>"We care for you like a brother,"</p><p>"So we just wanted to warn you to be careful what you do around them, 'kay?"</p><p>Harry stared at the two, wondering if it was yet another joke. But he had been friends with them for the past few years, plus, unlike their brother, stayed supportive of him despite whatever was said about him. He knew Fred and George would not lie to him about something like this. Nodding at the two, Harry thanked them, "While I'm a little confused as to what brought this about, I'll take your warning into consideration. I'll be careful."</p><p>Grinning at each other, Fred and George turned to Harry replied as one, "Just ask as if you need any help!"</p><p>The two then made their way out of the room, ending the privacy spell, the foxy grins plastered on their face causing the Order member that were in the house to become wary.</p><p>Harry sighed, filing the way the warning the twins just gave him and made a mental note to check if Ron had been acting oddly during the past few years. He then left the room and headed to the Black family library, knowing that Sirius would be there hiding away from the rest of the Order (Again. He barely interacted with anyone outside Remus, the twins, Hermione, and Harry himself!).</p><p>Apparently it was a good thing they were in the library at the time. Harry told Sirius about his memory like dreams and surprisingly enough, Sirius actually recognised the pattern somewhat. Remus, who had walked in on their conversation earlier, seemed to recognize it as well, only to keep his mouth shut when Sirius mentioned a book explaining the entire situation within the library itself, rather surprised by Sirius' knowledge of the topic as well.</p><hr/><p><em><strong>Past Dreams, How to deal with Reincarnation</strong></em>. Reincarnation. Was his godfather crazy? Reincarnation didn't exist! Or did it? Harry decided to indulge the man, only to find that the book that Sirius gave him clearly listed the signs of having been reincarnated, particularly reoccurring dreams that felt more like memories.</p><p>Further reading indicated that there was a way for his past self to merge with him, giving him the abilities and form of his past self. The book itself mentioned that Gringotts was one of the places that still knew how to perform the ritual that merged past and present selves. Knowing he still needed more information on what would happen to him after the ritual (It wasn't written in the book, oddly enough.), he managed to sneak out of Grimmauld Place with Sirius and Remus' help, with Fred and George providing cover with a storm of pranks that triggered every few minutes.</p><p>The goblins were informative. They were quite surprised (And suspicious, they never liked to trust wizards with such information) that he was inquiring about reincarnation, but once he mentioned that he had been having a large number of odd dreams unrelated to his current self even before he began Hogwarts, they took the matter more seriously. Reincarnation was rare, and ever regaining memories of their past life in the form of dreams was even rarer. They did mention that they found it odd that cases of reincarnation had been happening quite often recently, hence their distrust at first. Harry then asked what happened to those people after the ritual and the goblins assured Harry that fully regaining those memories did not push the memories of their current life to the back of his mind.</p><p>He returned to Grimmauld Place just as the chaos settled, allowing him to sneak back in unnoticed. Harry went over the information with Sirius, Remus and the twins, hoping for some of their opinions on the topic. Harry would have been disadvantaged if the nightmares continued to cause him to loose sleep, and Fred and George pointed out that if he did merge with his past self, he would gain the entire repertoire of spells his past self had in his arsenal. Both Sirius and Remus warned him that his appearance would change (Both looked at each other confused at how the other even knew that but kept quiet.), but Harry felt that would have been a relief. He hated being identified so easily in the Wizarding World.</p><p>A few days later, two days before his trail, Harry made his way back to Gringotts (This time relying on a Polyjuiced Sirius to hide his disappearance.) and requested that his memories be fully unlocked. The process itself would take three long hours, but in the end, Harry felt that it would be worth it. Harry then slipped into a deep sleep, signalling the beginning of the ritual that would merge his past and present selves.</p>
