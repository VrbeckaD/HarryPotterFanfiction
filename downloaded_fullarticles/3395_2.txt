<p>Trying Trial</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Severus had never seen Kingsley move so fast. In the blink of an eye, a shield surrounded them, Bellatrix’s attack hexes rebounding against it. Pandemonium erupted, people were screaming, running. The Wizengamot members Disapparated.</p>
<p>Riddle’s guards were clearly tensed for action, but he appeared calm.</p>
<p>After shrieking more expletives, Bellatrix turned and ran. </p>
<p>“You all right?” asked Kingsley as Aurors chased Bellatrix. </p>
<p>“I‘m fine.” Severus sighed. “I was clearly optimistic to hope Death Eaters wouldn’t disrupt the trial.” </p>
<p>“I shared your optimism.” Kingsley smiled tightly at him. “But she won’t escape. We have her now.”</p>
<p>Severus hummed. “We’ll see.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“She got away?” Kingsley groaned. “How?”</p>
<p>The Auror facing him shrugged. “One minute she was ahead of us, the next she wasn’t.”</p>
<p>Severus coughed. “We were always under the impression there were unMarked Death Eaters in the Ministry.” </p>
<p>“Damn.” Kingsley waved off the Aurors, walking over to where Lucius was sitting, fanning himself. “Are you all right, Malfoy?” </p>
<p>“Yes.” Lucius huffed. “Although, if Death Eaters show up and try to assassinate me every time I take the stand, I’m not sure I’ll be able to testify.” </p>
<p>“Don’t worry. The next hearing will be closed. You’ll get your day in court.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“The trial has been rescheduled to start again tomorrow,” said Kingsley.</p>
<p>Severus, who was holding Draco and chatting with Narcissa, looked up. “So soon? Are they sure they’ll be able to secure the place against Death Eater attacks this time?” </p>
<p>Kingsley smirked at him. “I think we’ll manage.” </p>
<p>Narcissa sighed. “My sister won’t give up so easily.” She cleared her throat. “I probably shouldn’t say this, but she and Vol—<i>he</i> have got quite close the last few months. More than once I’ve caught her emerging from is room late at night.” </p>
<p>Severus blinked. “You think they’re…involved?” </p>
<p>“I do.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“I don’t know why I’m shocked,” Severus said later as he and Kingsley left Hogwarts. “Bellatrix breaks the rules in every other aspect of her life, why not marriage?” </p>
<p>Kingsley hummed. “I understand. They spout that pure-blood nonsense to fool people into thinking they’re traditionalists, but really, I see Death Eaters as bigots using blood purity as an excuse.” </p>
<p>Severus blinked. “I feel I should tell you I never—”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean you when I say that.” Kingsley clasped Severus’ arm, pulling him to a stop. “You I place in a different category.” </p>
<p>“Oh? What category’s that?” </p>
<p>“Young and naive.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“One thing’s bothering me,” said Severus as they got ready for bed at Kingsley’s. </p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“Where was Pettigrew?”</p>
<p>“I was wondering the same thing.” Kingsley smiled. “Are you sure you wouldn’t like to be an Auror? You’ve a keen, analytical mind.” </p>
<p>Severus snorted, pulling up his left sleeve. “I’m a Death Eater, remember? I’m pretty sure I’m excluded from your club.” </p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know.” Walking over to him, Kingsley drew him into his arms, kissing him. Then, drawing back, he covered Severus’ Dark Mark with his hand. “One mistake shouldn’t define your entire life.” </p>
<p>“Maybe not, but it does.” </p>
