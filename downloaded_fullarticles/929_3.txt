</p><p>Soft sunlight was streaming through the windows when Petunia woke. It was warm today. Slowly, she opened her eyes and yawned, placing her palm on her mouth. The other side of the bed was empty. It surprised her because it was Saturday and so Vernon should be sleeping right now. He slept in on Saturdays and anyways he woke Petunia up for breakfast. She sat up and rubbed her eyes.</p><p>She didn't know why it felt that she had woken up after weeks of sleeping when she had slept late yesterday night. That useless boy had ruined everything. Why Lily and that bastard of a husband of hers had to go into a magical coma and why Dumbledore had to leave their freak of a son on her doorstep was beyond her. She hated their world. She hated Lily and she had told her that she did not want to have any kind of contact with her.</p><p>Vernon's friends came over on Friday nights and so Petunia had cooked several things and she had entrusted one small task to that boy. He had to make chocolate pudding. But, he couldn't do it and he didn't tell her until much later that he hadn't done it. The five-year-old freak was a waste of space and she had - she had just been so angry that she had lost her calm and commanded him to go and sit inside his cupboard and stay there for the rest of his days and die, if possible. She had been so angry that she had slammed the door shut and then they had ordered the dessert.</p><p>A knock on the door brought her back from her musings and for the first time, she realised that she wasn't in her bedroom. She looked around. There was a wardrobe but it was black instead of brown and slightly larger too. There was a mirror and it did not have the crack that her mirror had. Even the windows were larger than her windows.</p><p>"Enter," she muttered and the door opened and what she saw left her speechless. There, on her doorstep was Dudley - a much slimmer, grown-up version of Dudley. His cheeks were sunken and there were dark circles under his eyes. How could her son have aged ten years in one night?</p><p>She stared at him and kept on staring. His face was quite blank which was strange in itself. He was so still. Her five-year-old son was quite expressive and playful. Who was this boy? Where was she?</p><p>"Dad wants breakfast," Dudley said. His voice was deep and his tone was bland. It was impossible to judge what he was thinking. Slowly, other things started registering her mind. There was a smell in the room - not very strong but there. She looked around and searched for the calendar and then gasped when she saw that it was 24th August 2029. It had been 23rd August 2019 when she had slept. What was happening?</p><p>Her heart started racing. How could she have time travelled. What was this?</p><p>"Dad wants breakfast," Dudley repeated blankly.</p><p>Petunia turned her head towards him, "And you? Have you eaten?"</p><p>He didn't reply for a few moments - only looked silently at her before saying, "I'm not much hungry. I'll have a glass of milk."</p><p>Petunia nodded. <em>This smell - what is this smell?</em> She wondered. Maybe, Maria hadn't come yet.</p><p>She got up and then remembered that Dudley should be in school. He should be fifteen and in high school.</p><p>"Aren't you going to school?" she asked.</p><p>He fell quiet again.</p><p>"What's wrong with you?" he said. He hadn't called her 'mom' yet and that didn't escape her notice. She breathed slowly. Something was wrong. She had such a strong feeling.</p><p>"What's this smell, Dudley?" she asked curiously, "Didn't Maria come to clean the house yesterday?"</p><p>This wasn't her room. Had they relocated? Why had they relocated? Why had that boy not made breakfast yet?</p><p>Dudley didn't stay anything. His eyes became hard. Petunia swallowed.</p><p>"Why haven't you woken that boy yet? Harry knows what Vernon eats in the morning," she asked quietly, grimacing. <em>The smell - it was so pungent. Why was it smelling so much?</em></p><p>Something changed on Dudley's face then. His nostrils flared and his eyes widened and he breathed deeply. A bead of sweat trickled down his cheeks and he clenched his hands in tight fists.</p><p>She wondered why Vernon hadn't called her yet. Usually, by now, he would shout for breakfast. That man had no patience.</p><p>"If you're done, can you, please, come downstairs and provide breakfast to dad?" he asked. She stared. Who was this boy? This couldn't be her Dudley. This well-mannered, controlled boy couldn't be her son.</p><p>"Listen," she started, swallowing, "You will think that I'm mad but when I slept yesterday, it was 23rd August 2019 and you were five. It should be 24th August <em>2019</em> today."</p><p>He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, opened his eyes. He thought she had gone mad. Even she, herself thought that she was mad. Of course, he would think so.</p><p>"If I didn't love dad and you so much, I would have left this house when I was five. I would have run away and lived Mr Dumbledore or hell, Mr Snape. Please do not remind me of that day," Dudley said and his voice was just so pained that Petunia fell silent.</p><p>"What is this smell?" She asked finally. He gaped at her and at first, he was just surprised but then anger replaced the surprise and he said in a voice that barely concealed his rage, "I just asked you not to remind me. Will you, kindly, refrain from talking about him?" and then he stalked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Petunia's head was starting to ache and the smell was not going. Ten years had passed in one night and Dudley didn't want to talk about that boy. Vernon hadn't shouted for her yet - not once. Everything was strange and unusual. She didn't move for a full ten minutes, testing, wondering when Vernon would finally lose his patience and shout for her or for Harry. She waited for things to become normal and for Dudley to come running inside her room, complaining about that boy, lying about how that boy had been stealing food.</p><p>Nothing of that sort happened. She got up and took a quick shower and opened her wardrobe. It was - everything seemed so old - as if she hadn't bought anything new for the past some years. She took out a green skirt and a light yellow shirt and got dressed. Then, she walked out of the room. The house - it was also different. She was on the ground floor of course and there were no stairs that went to the first floor. There was a dining room and a kitchen and a door that led to a sitting room and another door on the left side of the sitting room that led to another room - probably Dudley's. Her home had had the first floor too.</p><p>She stood at her doorway and looked around. There was another door. It was closed and it was between the door of the sitting room and the kitchen. She frowned. Was it another sitting room?</p><p>She turned to look at Vernon who was reading the newspaper quietly. He was wearing his pyjamas and a shirt and he looked old. His hair was white and his eyes were fixed on the newspaper as if he hadn't even noticed her yet. She knew better, though. His fingers were clutching the newspaper tightly. He knew about her presence. Dudley was sitting across him with a small glass of milk and a plate that had a very small piece of pancake. Petunia stared - it was close to what she gave to Harry for breakfast. Why would Dudley have so little? A plate of pancakes was kept on the table but no-one was having them.</p><p>Where was that boy, anyway? Why hadn't he woken up yet? Who made these pancakes?</p><p>Vernon was still not looking at her. In fact, he was trying hard not to look at her. Dudley was just frowning at his plate. He was lost in his own thoughts. The smell was so strong over here. It was so - so - it was of rotting flesh or maybe, rotten eggs. Her heart was not calming down and her head had started pounding now.</p><p><em>Where the hell was that boy?</em> She couldn't breathe properly. It was like everything stank - the carpet, curtains, furniture and even her clothes.</p><p>She forced her legs to move and headed towards the small rectangular table and sat adjacent to Vernon so that she could look at bot Vernon and Dudley.</p><p>"Why are you not eating anything?" She asked because Vernon's plate was empty. Even his cup was empty. She picked up the kettle. It had tea.</p><p>"They just got ready. I just brought them over," Vernon said, finally looking at her. His eyes were bloodshot. She stared speechlessly at him. Vernon did not know how to cook.</p><p>"Dudley doesn't eat anyways. So, I was waiting for you," Vernon's tone was so blank that Petunia couldn't think of anything except that for the next few seconds. Something was not right. Something was very wrong.</p><p>She covered her nose. The smell - it was so strong here.</p><p>"Where is that boy?" She asked cautiously, "Why isn't he here? Why did you cook?"</p><p>Vernon gaped at her. A loud and sudden CLANG startled her and she turned her head to find Dudley glaring at her.</p><p>"Do you have any shame?" the boy asked, his brows furrowed and his eyes utterly, utterly disgusted.</p><p>"Where. Is. Harry?" she asked slowly, looking deep into her son's eyes.</p><p>But, it was Vernon who answered. Dudley looked much too furious and tired to say anything.</p><p>"Petunia," he said and she turned her face back towards him.</p><p>He continued, his voice and eyes disgusted, "He's dead. Today is his tenth death anniversary or have you forgotten, Petunia. I don't understand how you can when his dead body is still trapped inside that damned cupboard under the stairs. After all, you were the one who trapped him there."</p><p>TBC</p>
