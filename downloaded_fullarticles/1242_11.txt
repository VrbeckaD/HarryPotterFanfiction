</p><p>"Are you sure it will work?"</p><p>This question was asked by none other than James Fleamont Potter, son of Fleamont Henry Potter and Euphemia Selena Potter born Lestrange . Pureblood of many generations, he was the worthy heir of the Oldest and Noblest House of Potter, one of the most important noble families of the British Wizarding World, not to mention the rumours mentioning the Potters as the last descendants of the Majesticest and Revered House of Gryffindor...</p><p>"Of course, boy, everything will go as planned, fear not."</p><p>This other voice, much older, was that of none other than Albus Perceval Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Warlock, Chairman of the Wizengamot, Chief Enchanter and Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, not to mention his position of Headmaster of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p>"And You-Know-Who will fall in the trap?" Asked a more feminine voice.</p><p>It was that of Lily Janice Potter née Evans, a muggleborn with a distant wizardry ascendance (discovered by asking the creation of a genealogical tree to the goblins of the Gringotts Bank) with the family Rosier.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore looked at Lily with twinkling eyes.</p><p>"Tom will fall into this" trap ", as you say so well my dear, and he will not understand until the last moment what will happen to him," smirked the old man, proud of his plan.</p><p>"And the child?" Asked James Potter with a hint of disgust.</p><p>He turned his gaze to a young child in a cradle. Looking like him, this child with ebony hair and emerald eyes was not his nor Lily's.</p><p>Harry Potter, whose real name was Hadrian Charlus Potter, was the son of Charlus Henry Potter and Dorea Violetta Potter née Black. Born on the thirty-first of July one thousand nine hundred and eighty at St. Mungo's Hospital, the child was raised at Potter Manor in Wales before becoming an orphan on October 5, nineteen- one hundred and eighty-one when his parents died during a Death Eater raid on the village of Pottershire, a village entirely owned by the Potter family being incorporated into the old Potter's Magic County stretching from Swansea to Newport ( Cardiff included) and being considered the second largest Magic County of the United Kingdom after the Black (in England, from Brighton to Canterbury, belonging to Count Arcturus Black III), closely followed by the Counties of Longbottom (In Wales, from Llanelli to Tenby, belonging to Count Frank Helios Longbottom) and Malfoys (in England, from Nottingham to Leicester, belonging to Count Lucius Abraxas Malfoy).</p><p>Hadrian, then nicknamed Harry, was entrusted to James Potter as the last relative of Charlus Potter, Fleamont and Euphemia having been murdered by Voldemort and his Death Eaters a few months earlier. And that was the reason for James Potter's hatred. The child was the heir to the Potter family, leaving nothing to James Potter. Oh, he prayed that this child would die with his parents, making him the heir to the County , but alas ...</p><p>That's when Albus Dumbledore had a wonderful idea. Thanks to a false prophecy by the drunkard Sybil Trelawney, who was "by chance" heard by a Death Eater, the old man managed to focus the attention of his former student on two families, the Potter and Longbottom. He discussed it with James Potter, and together they decided to pass the young Hadrian Potter for Henry James Potter, the current son of James Potter and Lily Evans, also born on 31/07/1980, hiding to all the true identity of Hadrian.</p><p>And after several shots, twisted moves and other delicacies, they managed to make a traitor (Albus knew perfectly well that Peter was a traitor, like James and Lily) going to inform Voldemort of the Potter's location.</p><p>"The child will survive. The spell I placed on the child will return the spell to the caster thanks to the muggle sacrifice ," Albus informed him with a small smile. " Then we will move to phase two of the plan. "</p><p>" Phase two ? That which is to hide and wait until he dies at the hand of You-Know-Who because he used Horcrux?" Lily asked, intrigued.</p><p>Albus just nodded.</p><p>"Yes. Fortunately for you I have managed to secure you a very comfortable home in Patagonia. There, you will be free to do what you want until everything goes. Meanwhile, Harry will be placed in your sister's care, Petunia living at 4 Privet Drive in Surrey for him to be abused as he should . "replied the old man.</p><p>"And who's going to replace us ? And what about Sirius and Remus?" Asked James, worried about his friends.</p><p>Albus smiles at him once more.</p><p>"Sirius and Remus are fully aware of the plan and will join you in Patagonia, and as for the replacement, I have hired two dying muggle actors to whom we are going to administer a high dose of Polyjuice prepared by my old friend Nicolas Flamel. Potion will last twelve hours, far enough to "discover" their bodies and bury them before the effects cease. ", answered the old man with a big smile.</p><p>Lily Potter just smiled, holding her son Henry in her arms as James nodded before smirking at the toddler who was never going to inherit the Potter family fortune. Whether it's a day or seventeen, anyway, he would eventually become Count Potter.</p><p>He never noticed Hadrian's gaze turning orange briefly before turning green again.</p><p>

  <strong>Godric's Hollow, 11:12 pm</strong>
</p><p>"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! I'll hold him off!"</p><p>These were the last words of comedian Daniel Jones as James Potter before dying from the hands of Voldemort.</p><p>On her side, actress Janice Felton watched the child in the cradle. The old man had promised them that he would survive, but had he told the truth? Was it a good idea to pretend to be this "witch"? She did not have much time to think that the door of the nursery exploded, revealing a man with a serpentine appearance and ruby eyes. She shivered before playing her role.</p><p>"Have mercy, do not kill Harry!" She cried.</p><p>"Step away woman, and you'll be spared! I want only your child!" Voldemort said in a tone that was both magnanimous and threatening.</p><p>"Please, I berg of you, not my son!" Repeated the woman in supplication.</p><p>"I order you to stand on the side, stupid mudblood!" Repeated Voldemort, grinding his teeth, threatening her with his wand.</p><p>He still found it odd that she had not reached her magic wand, like James for that matter.</p><p>" No, not Harry, I beg you, kill me if you want, kill me in his place ... ! " Cried <em>Lily Potter again </em>.</p><p>"This is my last warning!" He ordered one last time.</p><p>" Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy... Not Harry! Not Harry! Please — I'll do anything!", implored once moreover the actress.</p><p>"No one refuses to obey Lord Voldemort three times! <strong>Avada Kedavra </strong>!" Cried the evil wizard.</p><p>A green ray came out of his wand to reach the actress, killing her instantly. The wizard raised an eyebrow before shaking his head. He had promised his servant, Severus, to try to save the mudblood. Alas, she was too stubborn. But let no one say that Voldemort does not keep his promises.</p><p>He turned his gaze to the child in the cradle. The latter was looking at him calmly, even a little too calm.</p><p>"So, are you the child destined to defeat me?" Voldemort asked rhetorically.</p><p>Voldemort blinked a few times. Did he imagine it? Did he come to see the child smile? And not a cheerful toddler smile without a brain, but that of a sadist worse than him? Voldemort frowned and narrowed his eyes, analyzing the situation and especially the child.</p><p>He opened his eyes wide, feeling the immense power that surrounded the child. It was simply impossible. The toddler before him had a magical aura far superior to his own, he who was considered the greatest dark lord of all time! How was that possible?</p><p>"So much power ... So much wasted potential ... If you were not predestined to defeat me, I 'll have you adopted ... I wonder if ...", wondered Voldemort watching the child.</p><p>He saw the child's eyes turn orange, and a memory was sent directly into Voldemort's mind. That of the afternoon. The Dark Lord cringed his teeth before getting upset.</p><p>"So this old fool had planned everything. I'll show him who's the strongest of us, it seems like I do not need to kill you ... Yes, I have a much better idea. I will have an heir, but what to do? ... Ah, I know! "Voldemort smiled demonically, not wondering for a single second how the child had done to convey this memory.</p><p>He put it on the account of accidental magic.</p><p>Observing the body on the ground, Voldemort smiles sadistically before levitating it before him. He looked at the child again.</p><p>"I will come and get you, my future heir. <strong>Avada Kedavra </strong>!" Cried the Dark Lord.</p><p>The green beam went to Harry before touching his forehead. Surprisingly, the ray was countered by a kind of purple shield (which had nothing to do with Dumbledore's protection) before returning the spell to Voldemort. Fortunately, the body of the actress suffers the blow in its place. However, the blast was so important that the nursery imploded, Voldemort protecting himself with a simple shield just like Harry with his weird purple shield.</p><p>On Harry's side, the spell left a vague scar on his forehead before fading in a surprising way, leaving a thin scar.</p><p>Voldemort then left his robe on the ground, throwing an <strong>Incendio </strong>on it before smothering the fire. Then he left the place at full speed to return to the Malfoys and warn them of the continuation of his plan.</p><p>After all, now that the Wizarding World was going to believe him dead, he had to prepare his Death Eaters so that they could avoid prison.</p><p>Voldemort was probably the only one to notice Harry's orange gaze, but he did not know the meaning.</p><p>He did not know that this look belonged to Tenebrae, a former Dark Lord of the Sith, an Ancient Galactic Emperor, and most importantly, the most powerful being ever to exist.</p><p>He did not know that Hadrian Charlus Potter was actually the Immortal Emperor: Valkorion.</p><p>And above all, he did not know that one of his horcrux had clung to the child before being absorbed by the Immortal Emperor, giving him the gift of Parseltongue and especially, making him the heir of the Dark Lord .</p><p>As for the continuation? It did not differ from Dumbledore's plans. Peter Pettigrew fled before being catch back by Sirius Black , killing Muggles before transforming into a rat . Sirius was <em>sent </em>to Azkaban for the murder of several muggles before being sent to Patagonia by Albus , replacing him with a muggle who died a few hours later in the squalid prison before being buried under the name of Sirius Black on the hostile land around Azkaban.</p><p>For his part, Harry was laid in front of the door of the Dursleys, under the worried look of McGonagall (the latter not being aware of the plan and having a deep affection for the child). Dumbledore left him there, thinking that his plan was going to unfold as he hoped.</p><p>He did not take into account that a few minutes later, the child was recovered by an ecstatic Lord Voldemort before being taken to the Slytherin Manor located in the Fenlands near Lincoln in the East of England , the Fenlands being also known as the Duchy of Slytherin, one of only five duchies of the United Kingdom (with that of Peverell, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff).</p><p> </p>
