    <p>How does one know the difference between a dream and reality?</p><p>In a dream that can easily turn into a nightmare, he was but a butterfly caught in the sticky web of a spider who merely wanted to play with him.</p><p>He dreams endlessly of Hogwarts. His second year, before the tragedy… before Ginny Weasley died, and before he fell to the ground unmoving from the bite of a blind basilisk.</p><p>He dreams of nothingness. He dreams of nightmares.</p><p>Harry’s real body was elsewhere. Safe and zealously protected.</p><p>Harry dreamed of wonderful things, and suffered terrible nightmares for years.</p><p>Not that he would remember.</p>
<hr/><p>It was a dark room where the only source of light was moonlight.</p><p>“<em>Evigilare faciatis. Excitare sacrificium nostrum. Surgit. Surgere. Surgere..."</em></p><p>The chant continued.</p><p>Lashes fluttered. Emerald green eyes turned to look at the strange place he found himself in.</p><p>He could hardly move, and he could hardly speak. Everything was numb. The child wracked his mind of memories that just seemed so far away and out of reach.</p><p>Torches lit all around him and he was blinded.</p><p>Masked women and men surrounded him. They wore white. Harry did not have a voice. He was terrified.</p><p>They cast a myriad of spells on him, one after another, and then, he was put to sleep.</p>
<hr/><p>There was a gathering of a thousand men and women, dressed lavishly and wearing masks.</p><p>It was a masquerade. The chandeliers hung from the ceiling, burning green fire. Hung across the walls were symbols of a snake and a skull, one that Harry never saw before but instinctively feared.</p><p>A lady was singing, her voice high and cold, as if weeping in melancholy. Around her winged beings were dancing. In her highest aria, violins began strumming, as if to herald the beginning of war.</p><p>The drum beat began.</p><p>His attention was riveted with the performance until he heard the sound of metal rubbing against metal.</p><p>Harry tried to look for the source of that garrish sound and soon saw a man sitting on a throne. His countenance was divine, and majestic. Looking at him, Harry could not breathe, as if he was just an ant waiting to be crushed.</p><p>...Like he was looking at the face of God<span class="ILfuVd">—</span></p><p>or the Devil.</p><p>Molten red eyes with a ring of gold. He sang of power. He wore a crown. His robes were the darkest of ebony. Laced upon his shoulders was a large snake.</p><p>Beneath the throne were chains... The snake began slithering, hissing.</p><p>
  <em> “He’s awake, master.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “I know, Nagini.” </em>
</p><p>Harry soon came to know those chains connected to the shackle on his neck, and wrist. And that he was wearing a white robe that did little to hide his body, and that he was lying down at the foot of the said throne.</p><p>Nagini, the snake seemed delighted and left the man’s throne, crawling over him, and began opening her wide mouth. Her tongue peaked out, scenting him.</p><p>Harry could hardly breathe.</p><p>“<em>You smell of fear, little one.” </em></p><p>Harry gulped, and Nagini's mouth flexed, stretching out her fangs.</p><p>Then, there was an applause, the music ended.</p><p>The man on the throne stood up, and at this point to Harry, he did not know who he was, but there was a sudden chorus of, “LONG LIVE LORD VOLDEMORT!”</p><p>Harry began screaming inside his head, but he was frozen, fangs were gliding across his shoulder. Not a drop of blood spilled.</p><p>Lord Voldemort raised a hand, and a hush began as the entire room fell into stillness.</p><p>Their lord’s voice echoed the large halls, “Four long years has it been, since we’ve taken over the corrupt ministry and rebuilt the Society of Magic. We started a revolution,” the man said with relish, and he raised his hand, bringing forth the dark mark in the middle of the room, it was glowing in sickly green, and the crowd was in awe. “We are left with an empire that stands strong, stronger than all those before them. Stand proud, for we have conquered all those in our way. We now rule the wizarding society of not just Britain, but the world.”</p><p>He let the words sink in.</p><p>Silence where not even a pin drop could be heard pervaded the hall.</p><p>They waited, hearts aflutter and stilted breathing just to hear Voldemort’s voice.</p><p>“Your children will live as rulers and together, we made this happen. Rejoice.”</p><p>The crowd went wild cheering loudly, thunderously with wild raucous voices, a cacophony against the din of clapping and stomping.</p><p>It died down as a hand motioned for them to stop.</p><p>“...and yet, there are those of you who still believe <em> we </em> can be <em> defeated… </em> That I, <b>Lord Voldemort </b>can be felled. The scum of our empire, who still fight to this day and use children as soldiers... Who think there exists a boy who can one day destroy everything that we have worked so hard to build. I bring them before you.”</p><p>Then, the crowd parted as men, women and children were brought before the gathering. Their clothes were ragged and barely there. They walked with their bare feet, wearing black sacks over their faces.</p><p>They were brought inches away from the throne.</p><p>Each prisoner had two guards pointing wands behind their backs, ready to strike at a moment’s notice.</p><p>Voldemort gave a signal, and one by one, they removed the sacks that covered the prisoner’s heads. Matted hair, bruised and bleeding, covered in pus, necrosis, some badly disfigured from abuse and torture. They wore the face of suffering and yet Harry could still recognize some of them.</p><p>As if seeing familiar faces jolted his memory, he remembered Ginny's death. Tom Riddle, gloating, and telling him he was Lord Voldemort... The basilisk. The Sword. Hogwarts, on fire and then nothing. He then realized that this was the direct result of his failure to contain the monster when he had the chance.</p><p>Those before him were not just mere strangers but were professors and classmates. Neville, Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys…</p><p>It was all happening too fast. He struggled to move, to say something, to prevent what was to come. And yet the only thing he could do was blink his eyes and open his mouth, croaking. His hands began reaching out, through sheer force of will.</p><p>“Traitors, I give you one last act of mercy.”</p><p>Harry suddenly found a hand pulling his hair, until the tips of his toes were dangling on the ground. It hurt, and it immediately brought tears to his eyes, for he could hardly move, he could not speak, or protest to the way his body was being handled but he wanted to scream, plead. Anything.</p><p>“I give you The Boy Who Lived.”</p><p>The cacophony was back. Gasps of surprise, marvel from one end. It was chaos.</p><p>The prisoners began struggling, shouting, terror filled with accusations, calling out for Harry’s name. And there were those shouting “Kill them. Kill them! Blood traitors! Mudbloods!”</p><p>Harry was in shock and in so much pain. He was suspended in mid air. When Voldemort began caressing his face, the pain grew tenfold. His scar was aching in waves and it spread around his head, like needles, white hot pressing repeatedly.</p><p>“Here is your precious Harry Potter… your missing saviour. I hid him for seven years, in a place none of you could ever find. See what has become of him… He will not save you! He was never a savior. He is simply just <em> my </em> prisoner. A sweet little child."</p><p>"MONSTER!" Came a harsh cry.</p><p>"I want you to know, that I will hunt your children down until they suffer like you suffer now. You have all betrayed me even when I gave you the chance to live. It is a pity that now, you must all… die.”</p><p>Spells were fired to slit all the prisoner’s throats.</p><p>Blood sprayed everywhere. They struggled to stop the bleeding but eventually collapsed to the floor, convulsing.</p><p>Everyone else was cheering. Clapping.</p><p>Harry found his voice then, screaming himself hoarse. White hot pain melded with his pounding headache.</p><p>“No… no… You killed them... You killed...”</p><p>He was boneless when the Dark Lord let go of him. He could feel tears come down and utter horror. He was trembling, unable to process what just happened.</p><p>Everyone was praising Voldemort and wizards and witches with silver masks came forward, chanting until the blood on the floor converged into a chalice that formed in the center of the ballroom. The bodies shrivelled up into husks of bone and skin.</p><p>“We drink from the blood of our enemies! May their magic grant us power.”</p><p>Harry trembled as he tried to push himself up… tried to crawl away. The world was spinning. He could not stomach what was happening. The chorus of mad laughter.</p><p>Then everything went black.</p>
<hr/><p>They broke his wand in front of him.</p><p>They told him his familiar was dead.</p><p>His family was dead. His friends were dead. All those he knew have either pledged loyalty to the Dark Lord, worshipping him as their God or they were dead...</p><p>There was no escape.</p><p>Harry felt cold. He cried so hard he didn't know when it'd stop...</p><p>He was a prisoner</p><p>A Death Eater explained to him he was asleep for seven years. His body has not aged and will never age and if he behaves, he might never have to sleep again.</p><p>Now that the war was over and the rebellion has been squashed, the Dark Lord intended to use him as a political tool to further demoralize his enemies and eliminate any opposition to the dark.</p><p>Harry just felt helpless inside.</p>
<hr/><p>Harry was left alone. He had a room with one window that let light in. He had a large white bed situated in the middle of the room. Around it were circular runes etched on the floor. His floor was opal, and the curtains around his bed were made with real gold. He had a bath filled with glittering diamond.</p><p>He was dressed with white silk, the softest he’s ever had… A ring adorned his finger, a locket around his neck, and curiously enough, there was a diadem upon his head. He was told never to remove it.</p><p>He drank from a cup, overflowing with red, every morning. He was fed like a king.</p><p>On the walls hung items of unimaginable value. He was the central piece to a trove of treasures.</p><p>Isolation drove him crazy.</p><p>He was trapped inside a room whose master’s presence was etched in its every corner, from the things he could touch to the air with which he breathed.</p><p>Sometimes, he heard voices. Pleased voices telling him to do things, things he would never ever consider.</p><p>And perhaps it was a matter of days, weeks, or months… he could not tell, but Harry was starved for company. The child in him could not handle the emptiness, and that was perhaps the start of his descent…</p><p>To Madness.</p>
