    <p>The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Harry had been returned to the Dursley’s like every previous summer between school terms, head still reeling from the events that wrapped up the TriWizard Tournament: Cedric Diggory’s near death experience, Barty Crouch Jr.’s reveal from under his shroud as Mad-Eye Moody, and the panicked battle in the graveyard with a newly returned Voldemort were things he had yet been able to process. Add to that half a month of unreturned letters from his friends and godfather, and Harry was leaping head first into a new stage of madness. </p><p>Pushing himself up from where he had been kneeling in Aunt Petunia’s garden - the weeding kept him out from under her sharp eye and tongue as well as gave him something to do - he toes the back door open and steps into the kitchen to wash his hands before he spreads dirt in the house and gives his aunt another reason to fuss. He can hear the TV in the living room, and can vaguely make out Uncle Vernon’s disapproving comments about the state of the world, but all of that is pushed to the back when a knock sounds at the door. </p><p>It’s a Saturday, and too late for dinner guests, and Dudley has his own key to the house, so Harry can’t imagine who would be knocking on the front door. Uncle Vernon doesn’t have a clue either if the continued disgruntled muttering is any clue, and Harry manages to peek an eye through the kitchen door right as his uncle takes a moment to adjust his sweater and dust off his slacks. Vernon opens the door, and around his large frame, Harry is treated to the faces of two of his favorite people.</p><p>“Remus!” he says, stepping out of the kitchen. “Professor McGonagall!”</p><p>Vernon blusters.</p><p>“Are you some of <em> them </em>?” he asks. “I won’t have your kind showing up at my house!"</p><p>“I’m afraid this is an urgent matter, Mr. Dursley,” McGonagall says. “And one best discussed inside.” When he hesitates, she continues, “Of course I’m more than happy to speak of the magical community right here on your doorstep.”</p><p>Uncle Vernon turns red in the face, and quickly ushers the two visitors inside. Remus looks better than the last time he’d seen him; he’s put weight on his skinny frame, and his robes are of a more updated style, nearly muggle in their appearance. McGonagall is wearing a green set of robes more casual than what she teaches in, but no less than what he’s sure is her best. </p><p>“What do you want? What are you doing here?” Vernon demands. </p><p>“Vernon?” Petunia calls. “What’s going on? Who is it?”</p><p>Before he can answer Petunia sticks her horse-like face out of the living room, sees the two visitors, and physically recoils. </p><p>“Well?” Vernon says. “Who are you and what do you want?”</p><p>“Mr. Dursley, I am Professor Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This is my college, Remus Lupin.”</p><p>Vernon’s face turns a rather lovely shade of plum.</p><p>“We’re her to speak to you, your wife, and Mr. Potter about his living arrangements for the summer.”</p><p>Harry feels hope bloom in his chest. They’re here to take me back, he thinks, I don’t have to stay. Quickly, he schools his face into neutrality; if the Dursleys know he wants to leave they might not let him.</p><p>“The boy just got back and now you want to take him again?” Vernon asks suspiciously. “Are you going to keep him?”</p><p>“Perhaps the sitting room would be more appropriate for this conversation. Remus, please help Harry pack his things. We can’t stay long.”</p><p>“Now, see here!” Vernon protests. “I haven’t said he can leave, and I won’t have you marching into my home whisking him away all willy-nilly! The boy has chores!”</p><p>Harry looks to Remus, who nods to the stairs. While the Dursleys are focused on yelling at Professor McGonagall, he and the older man creep around to the back stairs and up to his room. He lingers on the bottom step just long enough to hear the witch downstairs say,</p><p>“Mr. Dursley, understand me now. We can have a civil conversation, but there is no doubt that Mr. Potter is leaving here with us this evening.”</p><p>As soon as the door to his bedroom is closed, Harry doesn’t hesitate in throwing himself at Remus, who hugs him tightly for a long moment. </p><p>“What’s going on?” Harry asks. “Why are you here? Why am I leaving?”</p><p>“I’m afraid we don’t have time for an explanation right this minute,” he says. “Let’s gather your things. The sooner we can leave the better.”</p><p>“How is everyone?” he asks instead. “I haven’t been getting any letters.”</p><p>“Yes, I’m afraid that’s mine and Sirius’s fault,” Remus admits. “There are things going on that cannot be discussed in letters, things that could put yourself and the Dursleys in danger. I’m sorry for it, but we felt it was necessary. Now, hurry, where’s your trunk?”</p><p>Between the two of them, they make short work of packing his clothes and school books; Harry releases Hedwig and sends her to the Burrow upon Remus’s request. With a wave of his wand, Remus shrinks Harry’s trunk and hands it to the boy, who stashes it in his pocket. </p><p>“We really must get you clothing that fits,” the man comments as he and Harry exit his bedroom. </p><p>Professor McGonagall is standing at the bottom of the stairs, waiting for them; the Dursleys seem to have retreated to the living room. </p><p>“All settled?” Remus asks.</p><p>“We came to an agreement,” she says, tone suggesting it hadn’t been a harmonious one. </p><p>“Too bad your muggles aren’t more agreeable,” Remus says. “Nothing we can do. Are we ready?”</p><p>McGonagall nods, and leads their party out the front door. Harry follows closely, keeping an eye out for any neighbors that might be peeking through their windows. Half a block down the street they come to the neighborhood park, eerily empty as the sun had set close to an hour ago.</p><p>“This should do,” McGonagall says.</p><p>Both adults go to pull something from their pockets; Remus a slip of paper, and the professor a pocket watch and chain.</p><p>“Here you are, Harry,” Remus says, handing him the paper.</p><p>Bold slashing letters proclaim: <em> The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. </em></p><p>“What’s the Ord - ” </p><p>“Not here, if you please, Mr. Potter,” McGongall says. “If we’re ready.”</p><p>Remus takes hold of the watch chain, and holds the end of it out for Harry.</p><p>“Is this a portkey?” he asks suspiciously.</p><p>“Very good, Mr. Potter.”</p><p>“I hate portkeys,” he grumbles, but takes the end of the chain.</p><p>Professor McGonagall speaks a word Harry doesn’t know, and he feels the unpleasant tugging behind his navel as the three of them leave Surrey behind.</p><p>***</p><p>When Harry can stand straight without thinking he might puke, he finds the three of them on a dark unfamiliar street corner. Townhouses line the lane, most alight with light and sound. Remus leads them down the sidewalk until they stand in between the doors of numbers eleven and thirteen. Harry’s brow wrinkles.</p><p>“There isn’t a twelve,” he says.</p><p>“Think about the paper I gave you,” Remus says. “Hold what it said in your mind.”</p><p>Harry does, calling the address and bold handwriting to the front of his mind. As if on cue, a battered door appears between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. He gapes. It was as if an extra house had simply pushed its way between the muggle residences on either side.</p><p>“Quickly,” McGonagall says, ushering Harry and Remus to the door. </p><p>The black paint is chipped and scarred, though the silver door knocker shines bright. Remus takes out his wand and taps the door, and several loud clicks and thuds followed by what might have been a chain sliding away can be heard behind it.</p><p>“Inside, Harry,” Remus says, “but don’t touch anything.”</p><p>He steps into the near complete darkness of the hall, and his two traveling companions join him. The door shuts behind them with a solid thud, and the locks click back into place. One by one, sconces lining the hall come to life. It smells of dampness and a sweet, rotting scent that could be mold or something more sinister. The wallpaper is peeling, and the carpet is threadbare. </p><p>Before Harry’s eyes can adjust to the low light, a dark silhouette appears at the end of the hall.</p><p>“You made it!” a quiet voice says.</p><p>Harry lights up. “Sirius!”</p><p>Several voices shush him, but he pays them no mind, sprinting down the hall to throw himself at his godfather. Sirius stoops down to hug him, arms circling his ribs until their ache. His godfather has also put weight on, his frame less skeletal that before, though by no means have his features rounded. </p><p>“Can’t be too loud in the hall,” Sirius says. “Let’s move to the kitchen.”</p><p>Harry nods, and follows the older man down the hall and through a closed door. It’s a little like stepping into a different house; the kitchen is bright, suspended lumos charms hovering around the ceiling, with large clean windows and a sparkling porcelain sink. And it isn’t empty. Around the table sits Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Fred, George, Ginny, Percy, and Hermione.</p><p>“Harry!” Ron says when he appears in the door. His best friend throws himself from the table, shortly followed by Herminone, then everyone else. </p><p>Ron, who seems to have grown at least another two inches just from the time they left Hogwarts, lets him go quickly so the others can hug him as well.</p><p>“Harry, it’s so lovely to see you, dear,” Mrs. Weasly says, laying a kiss on the top of his head. </p><p>“Harry, my boy,” Mr. Weasley greets, offering his hand. </p><p>After everyone has said hello and returned to their seats, Harry joining them in a seat next to Ron, Sirius asks,</p><p>“Are you hungry?”</p><p>“Starving,” Harry admits, and it isn’t a full minute later that a bowl of thick stew is being set in front of him.</p><p>Remus and McGonagall move to join the company at the table, and Sirius offers them each a cup of tea.</p><p>“How were the muggles?” Ron asks.</p><p>“Terrible, like always,” he admits. </p><p>“It’s a shame you have to keep going back,” Fred says, and George nods in agreement.</p><p>“So what’s going on? Why did Remus and Professor McGonagall come get me? I was supposed to stay until the end of August.”</p><p>The faces at the table grow somber. They glance at each other and at the table, but none of them can seem to look him in the eye for a moment. </p><p>“Something has happened,” Sirius says, sitting down on Harry’s vacant side with a cup of tea in his hand. “Remus, hand me the paper, please.”</p><p>Remus hands Harry’s godfather a copy of the Daily Prophet dated three days previous. The headline reads MALFOY HEIR MISSING, PRESUMED DEAD. Under the bold title is a recent picture of Draco Malfoy, hair slicked back from his pointed face. He stares out from the paper, occasionally looking away. Even through the black and white of the photo, Harry can make out the deep bags under his eyes, and the tightness of his jaw. The article still further down describes that Malfoy went missing three weeks previous, and that almost all efforts to find him have been exhausted. </p><p>“With the return of You-Know-Who, we don’t think this is random,” Sirius says. “The Malfoys were staunch supporters in the last war, and if something really has happened to the boy, then no one is safe. Least of all you, with only muggles as a buffer between you and anyone who means you harm.”</p><p>“But how could Malfoy go missing?” Harry asks. “What happened?”</p><p>“His mother said he’d gone to Diagon Alley, and then never returned home,” Hermione says. “They’ve used every tracking charm they can think of, and hired a private investigator when that didn’t work.”</p><p>“They even hired a diviner,” Percy says, and from the shocked looks around the table it seems to be news to everyone else as well. He sighs. “You hear things, working for the Ministry.”</p><p>“Diviners aren’t cheap,” Mr. Weasley says, “not that the Malfoys would have trouble coming up with the gold.”</p><p>“What’s a diviner?” Harry asks.</p><p>“It’s a witch or wizard that specializes in finding things,” Herminone says. “It’s a very specialized school of magic, and because it’s so difficult to master, there just aren’t many people who bother with it.They focus on finding magical signatures.”</p><p>“Bill works with one,” George says.</p><p>Fred nods. “She says if a diviner can’t find something, it can’t be found at all.”</p><p>“Our worry,” Sirius says, “is that Draco Malfoy might be the first casualty in a new war.”</p><p>
