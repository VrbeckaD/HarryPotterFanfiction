    <p>“Ogden’s Old or Blishen’s?”</p>
<p>You settled yourself into the velvet, cushioned seat. “Pardon?” You looked up at the older woman pouring herself a very recognizable amber liquid into an empty glass cup.</p>
<p>“Firewhiskey, dear. Which do you prefer?” Minerva smiled sweetly.</p>
<p>“Oh, no wine today?” Minerva usually offered wine, but it became apparent that she needed something a bit stronger. To be honest, you did too. </p>
<p>It seemed like the school year was particularly stressful for the professors at Hogwarts. It seemed like the students were even more troublesome than usual. There seemed to be an increase of students sneaking out their dorms past curfew. Many have been caught trying to smuggle alcohol into the school premises. Students trying to find sneaky ways to cheat on their exams. Not to mention the endless stack of student work that was to be graded. It was just entirely exhausting trying to keep up with <i>everything<i>. </i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the school year, Minerva has been inviting you to her chambers after hours to drink and relax. These little meetings consisted of you both buzzed and gossiping about… well, anything. Your gossiping and venting had no restrictions; students, other professors, work in general, etc. There wasn’t a malicious intention or anything like that… it was just a way to unwind for the both of you.</p>
<p>Now, the year was ending and this would be your last session with Minerva until the next school year. </p>
<p>“Ogden’s Old, please,” you said softly, looking around the room. You were always a fan of Minerva’s chambers. The colour scheme of red and gold was an obvious tribute to the Gryffindor House. You always admired how prideful she was about her house. Despite your own sorting of Slytherin, you always got along with Minerva. She was like a mother you never had… sort of. </p>
<p>Minerva soon walked over with two glasses of firewhiskey, handing you a glass before settling herself into her own seat. “So, how was your week, Iris?” She brought the glass to her lips and sipped, as if tasting it. When deemed acceptable, she took a long swig. </p>
<p>You almost seemed to sink into the cushioned chair, taking your own much needed drink from your glass. The firewhiskey burned your throat, but in a strangely pleasant way. “Oh, dreadful. It seems like the students are more rowdy at the end of the year,” you sighed softly.</p>
<p>The older woman smiled knowingly. “Oh, most definitely. It happens every single year,” she replied with a tone of understanding. After all, she’s been working at Hogwarts for a very long time. </p>
<p>“Ya know, I found these Slytherin boys sneaking around the halls last night. When I asked what they were doing out their dorms, they had the audacity to say, ‘They were trying to <i>Slytherin<i> to my pants!’ I sent them straight to Professor Snape. That oughta show ‘em,” you vented to the other woman, an irritated frown etching your lips.</i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>Minerva had her own repulsed expression on her face, shaking her head. “Merlin, I had my fair share of hormonal boys when I was younger,” she smiled ever so slightly. “Thankfully, I don’t have to deal with it as much anymore.”</p>
<p>You huffed, crossing your leg over the other. “Even worse, it’s usually the Slytherin boys. Can you believe that? My own house! It’s degrading!” You waved your hand a bit drastically, nearly spilling the contents in your glass. “They stare at me as if I’m a slab of meat they’re ready to devour,” you mumbled, taking a much needed drink of your firewhiskey.</p>
<p>“Well, have you spoken to Severus about it?”</p>
<p>Your eyes darted up to meet hers when she said this. “Speak to Professor Snape? Why?” You questioned, the simple thought of the man made you squirm in your seat.</p>
<p>“Iris, he’s the Slytherin Head Of House. I think you should bring this to his attention.” She gave you a gentle look. “You’re on good terms with him, right? I’ve seen you two speaking to each other at dinner for quite some time.”</p>
<p>The edges of your lips quirked up a bit, reminiscing about the first time you actually met him. It was your first day of being Pomona’s apprentice. Truth be told, you had actually applied for the position of the Herbology professor. Though, Dumbledore unfortunately informed you that the position was taken already and the current professor wasn’t planning to leave anytime soon. But to your relief, he said the Herbology professor wouldn’t mind an extra pair of hands helping her out. Hence you being an apprentice for Pomona Sprout herself.</p>
<p>When dinner came around, you planted yourself in the only open seat… right in between Minerva and Severus. Before dinner had started, you were informed by Pomona that Severus Snape was not a talkative man. So, it was quite surprising when he actually <i>spoke<i> to you. And <i>he<i> was the one who initiated the conversation.</i></i></i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i></i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i></i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>“I assume you are Pomona’s new apprentice?” The deep, rich baritone voice sent shivers down your spine.</p>
<p>
  <i>Dear Lord, how could somebody have such a heavenly voice?<i></i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>You looked at him, your expression distinctly matching a deer caught in the headlights. “Oh- uhm, yes, I am,” you stumbled over your words, clearly not expecting for him to say <i>anything<i> to you throughout dinner. </i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>Snape stared at you with a raised eyebrow. His dark eyes seemed to pierce right through you. With an uneasy silence, you realized that he was awaiting your name.</p>
<p>“Oh! I am, uh, Iris Hellstrand. I’ll be assisting Pomona for now on.” You extended your hand to him.</p>
<p>He seemed to stare at your offered hand with an unidentifiable expression before firmly grasping it, shaking it rather stiffly. Your much smaller hand almost seemed to be enveloped his own large ones. It was nearly impossible to notice how <i>beautiful<i> his hands were. How neatly trimmed his nails were, how slender and delicate his fingers were, how surprisingly <i>soft<i> his hands-</i></i></i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i></i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i></i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>“Severus Snape,” he interrupted your thoughts. “I teach… Potions.” He spoke with a dramatic drawl. It left you clinging onto every word. You would have <i>loved<i> to hear him talk more… his voice was just so… <i>intoxicating<i>. </i></i></i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i></i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>
      <i></i>
    </i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>He pulled his hand away slowly and set them back to his side. </p>
<p>A smile grew on your lips. “Oh, so I’ll be working quite a bit with you! I was told that a lot of the plants in the garden were to be used in your potions,” you said with much enthusiasm to Severus’ surprise.</p>
<p>The expression that Severus gave you was a questioning one, as if it was strange that you seemed almost <i>too<i> excited to work with him. “… yes…” was his only response, low and dramatic. </i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>Both parties staring at each other with rather neutral expressions, a calm silence overtaking them before both turned to their plates in understanding that the conversation was over.</p>
<p> Well… Pomona did say he wasn’t a talkative man… but it wasn’t exactly an unpleasant interaction.</p>
<p>Pomona was quite the gossiper and she told you much about all the staff. She had told you that the children disliked Severus very much. Like if they had a poll on who was the most disliked professor at Hogwarts, he would win automatically. He didn’t seem <i>that<i> bad when you spoke to him-</i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>“<i>Iris!<i>” Minerva’s fingers snapping in front of your face seemed to snap you out of your memories.</i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>A pink tint covered your cheeks, blinking at the witch in front of you. “Oh, uh, sorry. I guess I got lost in my thoughts,” you mumbled sheepishly. You reached over to grab the bottle of Ogden’s on the coffee table in front of you, refilling your glass.</p>
<p>“Thinking about Severus?”</p>
<p>The bottle nearly slipped from your hands, but you were quick to grasp it firmly to your chest. You looked up at the woman with bewilderment. “What makes you think that?” You managed to sputter out, setting the bottle down. </p>
<p>Minerva gave a knowing smile. “Iris, you two have been dancing around each other ever since you met.” She set her empty glass down, done drinking for the night. Unlike you, who decided to indulge in a second glass.</p>
<p>Was it that obvious? </p>
<p>“What gave it away?” You looked at Minerva with soft eyes, lifting the glass to your lips and taking in the firewhiskey. The burn slowly subsided and now a satisfying warmth spread throughout your body. You found yourself melting into the comfortable, velvet chair. </p>
<p>“It’s common knowledge around the castle. You two aren’t exactly subtle about your interest in each other,” she laughed wholeheartedly, her hands entwined on her lap.</p>
<p>She wasn’t wrong. Severus had definitely intrigued you ever since you both met. It was almost like a magnetic pull. Despite what everyone said about him, he wasn’t that bad. To you, that is. </p>
<p>It started off with small interactions. You always find yourself gravitating towards him in the Dining Hall, using lame excuses to the other Professors just to sit next to him. During those short times, you both would have interesting conversations regarding the most random subjects. You enjoyed it immensely, looking forward to his dry humour and fascinating discussions. </p>
<p>If it was a particularly slow day, you even found yourself sitting in his classroom when he was teaching. Watching the Potions Master teach was quite entertaining- it seemed like Severus had a knack for theatrics and dramatic effect and it never failed to make you laugh when the students rolled their eyes or imitated him when his back was turned. You usually sat by his desk quietly, observing and only pitching in occasionally to add to Severus’ dialogue. That was a very rare occasion though, as most of the time you were too entranced by his deep, velvety voice that seemed to just wrap right around you every time he spoke. </p>
<p>Due to your position as Pomona’s assistant, you had to work with Severus quite a lot. It seemed that Pomona required you to go see Severus for the simplest of things; delivering potions ingredients, sending notes- one time she had sent you to him for <i>no reason<i>! When you arrived to his classroom, you both were quite confused to why Pomona sent you. At that point, it became clear to you that the older witch was trying to play matchmaker.</i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>“I think you should talk to him.”</p>
<p>The words snapped you out of your thoughts. “W-What?” Severus seemed to plague your thoughts more often, making you more receptive to getting lost in your thoughts. </p>
<p>A subtle smirk grew on Minerva’s lips. “I said, I think you should talk to him,” she repeated. “About the harassment from the Slytherin boys.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, uhh, I’ll do it eventually,” the words tumbled out of your mouth rather quickly. You had expected her to say something along the lines of talking to Severus about your little schoolgirl crush. </p>
<p>She looked at the clock resting on top of the fireplace. “As much as I’d love to continue our conversation, it’s getting rather late.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right, yes,” you set your now empty glass on the table and stood up, wringing your hands nervously. “Thank you for this, Minerva. These late night talks really help.” They really did. When things got too stressful, Minerva always had her door open to talk or vent. </p>
<p>The older witch smiled sweetly. “Of course, dear. They have been absolutely delightful… I hope to continue next year,” she said, a little twinkle in her eyes as she rummaged through a shelf as if to find something. “Iris, dear, can you do me a favour before you retire for the night?”</p>
<p>“Of course. What is it?” You watched as she attempted to reach something off a high shelf, fail, and then resort to using magic to levitate it down. A wine bottle with a ribbon wrapped around the top. </p>
<p>“Can you deliver this to Severus for me?”</p>
<p>
  <i>Oh.<i> </i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>Before you could say anything, a calm smile graced her lips and she said, “I suppose you can call it an end of the year gift. I would deliver it myself, but I’m rather <i>exhausted<i> and would like to get right into bed.” The calm smile slowly turned into a sly smile.</i></i></p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i></i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Cheeky woman. She knew what she was doing.<i></i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>And you really couldn’t just reject her after all she’s done for you. </i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>A soft, defeated sigh escaped your lips before accepting the bottle. “Course, I can. My chambers are on the way to his anyways. Goodnight, Minerva,” you went to the door, bottle tucked under your arm.</i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>“And goodnight to you, Miss Hellstrand.”</i>
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>
    <i>And with that, she shut the door, leaving you with a gift needed to be delivered to a certain Potions Master.</i>
  </i>
