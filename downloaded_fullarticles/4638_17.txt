</blockquote><p>Orion Black stared at the spectacle before him, choosing instead to focus on the tiles of the black wall beyond what was actually happening. He…he couldn't bear to watch.</p>
<p>He'd done it. Truly. Walburga, his wife, sat beside him, smiling as they watched their younger son take the Dark Mark on his left arm… <em>They'd</em> done it. Regulus was the wizard they'd molded into the perfect, obedient son. He wasn't even their younger son anymore, but their <em>only</em> child. Yes…Sirius who?</p>
<p>Yet Orion couldn't watch. He couldn't face the consequences that he'd succeeded in raising one of his sons to be just like him, just like his wife, just like <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>Regulus didn't look prepared or pleased. If it wasn't fear Orion thought he saw on his son's young face, then it was the expression of a doll—a lifeless, soulless figure to be controlled by others.</p>
<p><em>Toujours pur</em>, Orion thought with a grimace as his eyes finally settled on Regulus for the first time that night.</p>
