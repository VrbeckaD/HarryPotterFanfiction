    <p>Chapter One: The Boy with the Scar</p><p>Why in the world had he agreed to go along with this anyway?</p><p>This whole going along to socialize was never go to work any of them truly even knew one another after his outburst in the kitchen cemented the gap between them all, M’gann’s intrusion into their minds was nothing short of an accident. Something normal for the people of Mars but for those of earth, an invasion of privacy, Superboy developed a strong loathing of another person invading his mind without consent or knowledge. His rash attitude shouting and being short with her was on him. No one shared the details of his life prior not that he was in any hurrying in opening up seeing the rest of the so-called team kept to themselves.</p><p>Minus Wally. Overeager to overshare and flirt with M’gann at every chance that Superboy saw no need for speaking up or about anything, the half-Kryptonian did not understand the speedster’s persistence noticing how she disinterested her words came across, in a friendly way but disinterested.</p><p>Superboy struggled understanding social cues, approaching his fellow teammates trying to avoid the awkward small talk while knowing how different his existence when compared – a clone. Robin, Aqualad and Kid Flash argued on his behalf at being treated like a normal being welcoming him with open arms without zero hesitation, the Justice League held no qualms having him around and residing within the Mount Justice even willing to accept him becoming apart of the team. Unfortunately, unable to shake off the downright, dismissive attitude that Superman showed. Not that he could blame the man discovering he had been cloned unknowingly and raised to possibly either replace or kill the man did nothing for Superman’s nerves despite his best efforts Superboy hoped that one day the two would talk on an equal level, an unrealistic dream given how far the lengths Superman went to avoid the place while sending Batman or the other heroes.</p><p>It went out saying that Superboy had a lot to work on, learn properly hearing the whispers of encouragement from Robin and Wally towards M’gann. His anger brought trouble lashing out on her though not without good reason there was a tingle of embarrassment trying to find the proper way in approaching and apologizing.</p><p>Aqualad’s assuring murmuring did nothing to resolve his nerves.</p><p>The notion had been appreciated. Another thing Superboy needed to learn on his own volition. </p><p>M’gann showed off her shapeshifting skills taking on the appearances of Robin’s and Wally’s uniform than switching back the boarder-line flirting from Wally almost caused Superboy to gag. How could the guy be so blatant and open? His eyes rolled resuming staring outside tuning out the background noise from the three. It was rude and childish even. What did he care? The conversation had nothing to do with Superboy. Sort of. It was nice knowing that M’gann felt awkward and uncertain as himself trying to build that bridge of communication after this morning little fight. It was stupid dwelling on the matter. He knew she meant no harm and she knew that he meant no harm so why was it so far for them to talk? Saying ‘sorry’ sounded so simple. Too simple for his mind to wrap around. After his outburst, he sincerely doubted that M’gann wanted anything to do with him or even believe his apology. This needed to be something thought of carefu–</p><p>His line of thought vanished suddenly bursting from the seat and bolted straight towards the door earning the instant alarm from the others without a warning rushing outside of the door towards the hanger ignoring the cries from his team, Superboy’s head snapped around preparing to raise his fist to punch through the door just for the hatch to open. Without hesitation rushed towards the edge making a gigantic leap forwards outside of the plane descending through the air and felt the sharp kisses of the wind against his exposed skin, the force of the winds proved strong raising his arm to cover his faces and squinting his eyes searched rapidly spotting the blur seen moments ago the fall accelerated immensely. Teeth clenched together reaching out with is freehand attempting to grab hold of the other swiping several times in an vain attempt at grabbing hold, the anger started to bubble deep inside becoming frustrated with the lack of progress before letting out a tremendous roar, utilizing his length grabbed onto the hem of the shirt pulling the person towards by circling his arm around and held them closely. Their descent quickened greatly holding onto the unconscious person, Superboy gritted his teeth inwardly wandering where the rest of his team was.</p><p>Think of the devil and then they appeared M’gann’s bioship flew beside him and spun around opening the hatch allowing Superboy to bring them inside. He carefully shifted his body enough to land without causing damage or bringing down the ship cocking his head to hear the hanger door closing behind them, sighing quietly with relief.</p><p>“Dude what were you thinking?!” Wally snapped and then paused pointing. “And who’s that?”</p><p>“Dunno,” Superboy answers instantly and shrugged. “Noticed him falling. You were all distracted with M’gann figured I had to do something.”</p><p>Robin frowned. “Where did he even come from?”</p><p>“For now, I believe we should inspect him first to ensure that he is well,” Aqualad interrupted patiently. “Robin?”</p><p>“I’m searching,” He murmured, the device held up records typing away rapidly lips curved thinly to a frown.</p><p>“Shouldn’t we have a name first?” Superboy quipped, flatly receiving a withering glare from Robin. It barely registered shifting his attention around noticing something off. “Where’s M’gann?”</p><p>Wally pointed. “She’s still controlling the bio-ship. We got an emergency call from Mister Twister just as you jumped out of the ship figured instead of letting you fall to a pancake-y death that saving and relaying the mission details to you would have been better. I thought you’d be able to handle crashing onto the ground but hey, what do I know?”</p><p>“Focus.” Aqualad gazed sternly with Wally shoved his hands into pockets and snorted childishly. “You acted recklessly, however, you did so to save an innocent life. It is commendable,” He added, sincerely.</p><p>Superboy averted his gaze. “… We’re heroes, right? We should help people in need,” He mumbled. “Couldn’t leave him to die.”</p><p>“Doesn’t answer where he came from,” Robin interjected. “We can look into that later after we check out the coordinates that Red Tornado sent us.”</p><p>“Wait! So, we’re just gonna leave an unknown on the bio-ship?” Wally spoke defensively. “I mean, no offence none of us know anything about this guy –“</p><p>Superboy moved his hands against the boy’s bangs noticing the odd scar upon his forehead and flinched away once encountering skin. “He’s freezing!”</p><p>“Weird scar,” Robin quipped.</p><p>Wally shot him a look. “That’s the first thing you notice? Really?” He signed dramatically. “Now we have an unknown that’s freezing cold on the ship on a mission.”</p><p>Aqualad stroked his chin thoughtfully. “We could… bring him with us.”</p><p>“You’re joking. Please tell me you’re joking,” Wally snapped his head to Robin. “He’s joking. Right?”</p><p>Superboy glared angrily. “You’ve got a better idea?!”</p><p>“N-No,” Wally crossed his arms. “You’re responsible for him!”</p><p>“Fine,” Superboy grunted.</p><p>“Wait we’re bringing him with us?” Robin interrupted. “How do we know it isn’t hyperthermia?”</p><p>Aqua kneeled down and placed his hand on the forehead. “It is cold, yes. I do not believe that our guest is in danger from hyperthermia or any symptoms now, nevertheless we must be careful.”</p><p>Before anything could be said the bio-ship rocked abruptly rocking them around barely keeping balance. Wally tripped over, Robin slammed up against the wall and Aqualad managed to hold onto the nearest wall slipped slightly Superboy kept the unconscious guy steadily in his arms not wanting to give an accidental shock.</p><p>“M’gann!” Aqualad yelled.</p><p>Her voice rang clearly. “I-I’m sorry but there are giant tornados knocking against the ship. I’ve gone into camouflage mood to avoid being seen!”</p><p>“Tornados?” Robin repeated quietly.</p><p>Superboy shook his head. “Doesn’t matter. We find the guy and take him out.”</p><p>“Ah ah ah!” Wally waggled his finger. “You’re on babysitting duty. Remember?”</p><p>Aqualad strolled forward throwing a gaze back. “That’s enough. We have a mission to complete, Miss Martian can you lower us down?”</p><p>“On it!”</p><p>The three moved towards the hatch once lowered to the ground Superboy shifted the guy placing him over his back proceeding to follow after his teammates, unable to shake off the lightness of the guy’s weight. Was this normal for humans? If this guy even proved to be human, his glance lingered for a moment before running out of the hanger.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wally was NOT having a good day!</p><p>First, Red Tornado immediately forced them to have a little socializing than M’gann invaded their minds by using her telepathy, of course, she was unaware of the custom of humans so there was no problem with forgiving such a cute girl like her. Than Superboy out of completely nowhere nearly gave them heart attacks jumping out of the bio-ship recusing a falling kid than now Robin had to go off on his own to fight the attacker without warning. Honestly, he hated when the younger decided to go do the whole ninja disappearing act. From what Uncle Barry told him that was a running similarity between Robin and Batman; appearing and disappearing within seconds. The building ruptured with windows shattering and the earth rumbled beneath their feet forcing them to dash inside passed the frightened populace thankfully none of which paid any attention to them trespassing onto the scene being met with what appeared to be a Red Tornado look alike!</p><p>Today was getting better and better, he thought sarcastically slipping on his goggles. “Who’s your new friend?” Wally questioned standing beside Robin.</p><p>The younger’s shot a look. “Didn’t catch it. Plays rough!”</p><p>Superboy twitched appearing ready to rush their opponent since he was busy carrying their little guest apparently that fell onto Wally, unfortunately, the redhead knew better than to rushing in. Clearly, their opponent knew exactly what he was doing while outnumbering him five to one none of them knew how strong he was.</p><p>He felt the apprehension from Aqualad and hesitation from M’gann.</p><p>“My apologies,” the mechanic voice remark soaked with sarcasm. “You may call me MisterTwister!” </p><p>“Wow. Mister Twister great name choice, by the way, pick out yourself? And I mean that colour scheme?” Wally snarked deadpanned. “Screams total rip-off!”</p><p>Mister Twister cocked his head for a moment remaining silent than blasting him with an array of wind tunnels static illuminated around the armour adding quite the jolt to the attack barely having any time to properly brace himself Wally found himself being hurtled around like nothing and quickly disregard towards a wall. The sound of bones cracking echoed letting out a painful cry, Robin rushed forwards branding what appeared as a small mini-shuriken and threw, afterwards bolted to his side gathering him up than dodging away narrowly missing another blast of wind from Mister Tornado. All in all? He should have realized his mouth should have been kept shut, his blood began to pump with apprehension. The last time the team was given a mission was a week ago and now here they were right in the middle of a proper rumble! How could Wally not be psyched? Horrid imitation of Red Tornado's gimmick and colour scheme but alas pickers were not choosers. Grunting sharply Wally pushed himself back together standing shakily before rebalancing his centre as a cocky smirk emerged upon his features. Now knowing exactly what the enemy was capable of he’d be able to run circles around the guy no problem! The advantage was in their favour!</p><p>M’gann held back with Aqualad keeping a good distance between Robin, himself and Mister Twister with Superboy still carrying the guy around but looked itchy to join in the fight.</p><p>“What are you just going to stand there and watch us take the credit?” Wally joked, side-eyeing tossing a lopsided grin. “We’re so gonna kick your ass!”</p><p>With that M’gann, Aqualad and Robin rushed Mister Twister preparing to attack with Wally regaining his own momentum curving around the enemy kicking himself off the ground than round side kicking the man upside the head, the sound of metal echoed throughout the room. He never got the chance to react when the feeling of wind blew around him, raising him away from the ground and spun him around as though weightless sending him flying outside the building. Toppling over a few trees breaking his fall. Wally groaned painfully shaking his head his vision blurring slightly taking a quick breath and searching around before Mister Twister entered his line of sight.</p><p>Anger sparked inside overriding any rational thought standing with complete anger and dashed doing his best to knock or in the least prevent movement, circling off the ground and circled around.</p><p>“What did you to do my team?!” Wally demanded.</p><p>Mister Twister cocked his head gazing apathetically. “I embarrassed them, mostly.”</p><p>“Why you –!”</p><p>Another blast of wind took Wally by surprise shooting him upwards to the sky or at least so he believed.</p><p>“I got you, Wally!”</p><p>M’gann’s voice echoed assumingly removing his arms from his face and noticed the levitation slightly off of the ground seeing the others enter in his peripheral view.</p><p>“Nice!” Wally grinned relaxing.</p><p>“My, my,” Their attention diverted back to Mister Twister glaring in unison. “Here I would have thought you children have learned of your limits!”</p><p>Aqualad stepped forward, anger clear as day. “What do you want?!”</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious?” The condescending mocking of Mister Twister made Wally’s blood boil. He hated being looked down on, underestimate and being treated less than he truly was worth, watching their opponent hover above them adding to the superiority complex that the man had. “I’m waiting for a real hero!”</p><p>That did it.</p><p>“Read his mind!” Aqualad said head snapped towards M’gann. “Find his weakness!”</p><p>She hesitated to shift back nervously. “B-But you said –!”</p><p>“Just for the bad guys,” Robin added, hurriedly.</p><p>Thankfully, she wasted no time concentrating her psychic powers lowering her head. “Nothing. I’m getting nothing?” Confusion rippled on his features before brightening and slapped the side of her head. “Hello, Megan! Why didn’t I think of this earlier! Red Tornado said that we were going to be tested, remember? I can’t read Mister Twister because he’s inorganic. He’s Red Tornado in disguise. After all, how many people do you know use wind powers?” M’gann questioned, the smile glowed obvious proud of herself for figuring that out.</p><p>Wally deflated. “A test? Really?”</p><p>Red Tornado had mentioned that. If that was the case somehow the speedster knew that none of them was going to be graded gracefully.</p><p>“Red Tornado sent us here!” Aqualad looked scandalous with anger flashing his eyes.</p><p>“He did say that! This was probably what he meant, just to keep us busy!” Robin declared.</p><p>“I called it,” Wally spoke, bitterly. “We’re a joke.”</p><p>Nothing more than a bunch of kids to the League. A group that needed to be babysat and looked after instead of treated like real adults, his stomach knotted with disgust at the betrayal. After everything that they had done so far, this was how they were repaid? Being treated like a nuisance. No. Not anymore.</p><p>Aqualad wasted no time approaching Mister Tornado with Superboy and the rest following.</p><p>“This game…” Wally murmured under his breath anger slipping through. “Is over.”</p><p>Mister Twister remained to hover eyeing them from above while the group strolled towards him. None of them particularly in the mood for games or playing around.</p><p>“We know who you are and what you want,” Robin said, coldly.</p><p>Aqualad tossed a frigid stare. “It’s time to end this!”</p><p><em>Silence</em>.</p><p>Wally remained steadfast preparing for whatever Red Tornado decided to throw at them after learning that this had been some kind of test, nothing could be done to pacify them, they were in this to pass the test and prove themselves as heroes instead of kids. This so-call mission was bogus and an insult. His mind continued to reel with seething, despite that his hair stood on end. Something did not feel completely right and unable to put a finger on why. Watching warily waiting for something or anything to happen until the tickling sensation of the wind picked up around them, that had not been the only thing stirring around them noticing the electricity beginning to jolt from above connecting with the tornados which were forming. His nerves started screaming. This was not right!</p><p>“H-Hey… but erm…” His eyes glanced sparingly. “Red Tornado can’t do that. Right?”</p><p>Aqualad’s stared wide-eyed. “No. No, he cannot!”</p><p>“You think I’m Red Tornado?” Mister Twister sounded bemused. A blast of energy descended around them forming a minor explosion a sharp cry echoed from each of them crashing hard to the ground creating miniature craters, Wally winced and breathed sharply trying in vain at pushing himself off the ground noticing Superboy letting out a ferocious roar leaping into the air and pulled his arm back, preparing to punch. Two bolts resembling spears shot from Mister Twister’s hands impaling right through Superboy’s chest as the sharp cry was ceased immediately followed by a powerful thud on landing and slide backwards.</p><p>Everyone was down. Wally could barely get back up. None of them could the blast had been far too close.</p><p>The hand was raised with the crackle of electricity from the air none of them could muster the strength to move out of the way. His eyes shut tightly preparing for the inevitable attack being sent their way that way the pain would be minimal, Wally felt foolish. Like a child he went rushing towards battle without truly thinking, believing he was the smartest on the team. He was just as eager and bullheaded as they were.</p><p><em>‘Flash… Uncle Barry, Aunt Iris…’</em> He thoughts. <em>‘I’m sorry.’ </em></p><p>He heard the echoing of the blast.</p><p>“<em>Protego</em>!”</p><p>A burst of light exploded around them curving from both ends taking the form of a gigantic shield, Wally felt the energy around them pulsing barely registering the fact that an unknown, the guy that Superboy had been carrying earlier now stood before. His eyes squinted unable to see what exactly was being held covered by the bright light. The fact that the kid had a defensive power turned the battle to their favour! Mister Twister grew aggravated watching his wind tunnels and electricity bounce off the barrier shooting back at him attacking consecutively revealing the intense anger. A tiny grin twitched. Now their opponent knew exactly how they felt! The rest of his team remained stunned watching the guy stood remaining vigilant in protecting them pushing back with all his might and heard noise of teeth clenching together tightly. Wally had to give the guy props standing up and protecting a group of strangers rather than hightailing to safety.</p><p>“You are persistent,” Mister Twister remarked, annoyed. “And clearly beginning to get on my nerves!”</p><p>Wally could practically hear the smirk on the guy as his tone laced amused. “So, I’ve been told, I tend to irritate pricks like you,” The guy answered, accent slipping through.</p><p> “How modesty, but my patience has begun to wear rather thin. I’ll have to teach you your proper place!” Mister Twister snorted lowering his arms. “But this is where your life and the life of your so-called friends shall end!” The dark turned dark crackling with the threat of lightning and thunder swirling in motion zooming towards them colliding with a direct hit with the shield. A sharp hiss escaped from the scarred guy but did not deter him from fighting on. “Why do you seek to protect those you do not know?”</p><p>“Do you need a reason to help someone?” The scarred guy retorted, fiercely cracking a small smirk before his demeanour became serious. “Besides couldn’t leave them fending themselves off from an arse like you.”</p><p>Mister Twister was not even remotely moved. “Admirable and unfortunately. So sad for you to perish!”</p><p>Another bombardment of the winds came crashing down on the shield. Cracks started to form within the barrier watching the scarred guy buckling beneath the pressure struggling to withstand the attacks, Wally kicked off his feet preparing to slide into action Robin and the rest preparing to jump into the fry when ready, M’gann seemed to hesitate despite her eyes widened with fascination and wonder. The scarred guy continued to withhold the barrier for now with Mister Twister determined to shatter their protection. It was an impressive feat that the barrier lasted this long, but now was the time to switch from defensive to offensive!</p><p>“Lay down and accept your fate!”</p><p>The scarred guy refused to go down easily keeping his arm steady. “No. Not here, not today… “</p><p>Something snapped inside of the guy. Wally did not know exactly what other than everything around him started to tense and the sensation of energy brightened at an immense level, converging together at once witnessing the arm being pulled back slightly then moved in tandem with Mister Twister’s attack. No one dared to look away.</p><p>“ENOUGH OF THIS!”</p><p>“Protego…” The sharp hiss whispered softly. “<em>MAXIMA</em>!”</p><p>The burst of energy enlarged immediately going beyond that of a simple barrier. No, a gigantic shield had been far more appropriate than a barrier growing in immense size shooting forwards in a collision with Mister Twister’s attacks dissolving the winds into nothingness allowing no room to move or even react other than the horrific cries with the silhouette of Mister Twister knocking into the distance.</p><p>As the light died down and the barrier, the shield fading out of existence Wally tried to make sense of what exactly happened. Life proved to be rather annoying as bad luck decided to kick in watching in horror as the scarred guy fell back dropping something to the ground Superboy dashed towards him nearly leaving Wally in the dust catching him. An air of relief passed from the speedsters’ lips, any doubt that he might have had officially vanished. As he looked over to give thanks words feel from his lips swallow thickly, the scarred guy’s skin paled immediately. Wasting no time Superboy removed his jacket draping around to keep him warm.</p><p>“I… I’m sorry that’s all I could do,” The guy murmured quietly. “He was… stronger than I thought.”</p><p>Aqualad’s head shook. “Do not apologize. Without your aid, I fear that we might have met with our end, thank you.”</p><p>“Take a good rest,” Robin held thumbs up. “We’ll handle things from here.”</p><p>“That was amazing,” M’gann whispered. “How did you…?”</p><p>Superboy glared. “He wouldn’t have had to jump in if you hadn’t tricked us into thinking he was Red Tornado!”</p><p>“It was a rookie mistake.” Robin defended. “It made sense at the time!”</p><p>Wally scratched his head, hating to side against her. M’gann’s comment had placed the group into peril unintentionally while believing she’d make a great addition to the team taking time to regroup and rethink strategy was important. “Go and hit the showers, and take our mysterious new friend with you okay?”</p><p>“How do we know she won’t hurt him?” Superboy demanded.</p><p>M’gann winced visibly with a flare of anger burned. “I’d never hurt an innocent. Especially not someone that just helped us!”</p><p>“We’ll leave him to you,” Aqualad nodded curtly ending the discussion. “For now, we shall pursue Mister Twister. Stay safe M’gann!”</p><p>“Be safe guys,” She whispered.</p><p>“No problem!” Wally grinned. “Just wait. We’ll all be back before dinner time, make sure that you don’t end up missing me too much!”</p><p>For that moment a glimmer of appreciation and thankfulness appeared within her eyes. His heart tightened knowing how determined she had been to prove herself to the team, showing that was deserved a spot among them. It was a drive that all of them shared, even Superboy. It was something that he had no doubt M’gann would pull through.</p><p>Now, Wally had a robot to find!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What… <em>happened</em>?</p><p>A loud, painful nudge lodged deep inside etched into the front of his skull swelling over time refusing to simply go away, vision blurry compromised due to the darkness of the room accompanied by the wobbliness of his body unable to complete trust himself without stumbling latching onto the nearest wall to help balance. The unfamiliar room left him at a loss not recognizing his surroundings, carefully moving along keeping an eye and ear out for anyone that might be around. Shaking head roughly trying to piece together his memories bit by bit to understand what exactly happened, everything felt jumbled all over unable to shake off the feeling that something went wrong, pushing back against the wall taking a moment to breathe re-gathering himself together.</p><p>Noises echoed from the other room, the voice of a girl. Not sounding much older than himself.</p><p><em>‘Wait…’</em> He paused, searching through his memories. <em>‘She sounds familiar…?’</em></p><p>The last thing recalled clearly had been the battle inside the Department of Mysteries, fighting off with everything his friends and himself had but overwhelmed and left confused. That memory ended abruptly leaving a giant gap afterwards, nothing substantial or provided any insight into his current condition. Nevertheless, at the corner of his mind, a stir nudged. Voices echoing through the pitch-black darkness taking form slightly enough recalling the feeling of arms and someone carrying him, someone had been protecting him. Pieces formed with each second the cries of pain and anger, fighting and the clashing of metal, the strong biceps holding him close to the chest and shielding him from attacks; murmurs of assurance, protection and guarded. His heart tightened the realization that he had been forced to depend on himself during his time of unconsciousness placing that person into danger, self-disgust formed curling his hand into a fist before slamming against the wall in anger.</p><p>How could he have let that happen? Guilty grew, knowing that whoever had been protecting him placed themselves in danger on his behalf. That would not be something which would occur again pulling out of his thoughts hearing the murmur of the girl’s voice echoed along with another mechanical voice, approaching from the door not bothering to hide.  The image of the guy in red armour flashed from his mind. The group that had been with him, the one with the giant S on his shirt who guard him against the attack. And that’s when almost everything fell right into place, waking up and fighting against the armoured guy with his magic before collapsing from the strain of his magic.</p><p>“That’s what I can do to help!” The girl exclaimed placing hands on the strange handles.</p><p>His throat cleared. “What can I do to help?”</p><p>Her body jumped shocked. “Wait how are you…. When did you wake up? You should be asleep!”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” He responded sharply. “Tell me. What do you need?”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Damn him and his anger.</p><p>The battle with Mister Twister proved how unprepared they were for battle, taking advice from someone with no experience nearly got them killed. M’gann meant no harm and truly believed Red Tornado had been in disguise testing the team after mentioning earlier. Their enemy put that theory down instantly. Unfortunately, her naivety placed the mission into jeopardy, the scar kid from before managed to save their lives without hesitating, winning his respect and from the rest of the team, bringing him along had been the right choice. If he’d been a second later somehow Superboy doubted they would be walking. Still acknowledging that lashing out at M’gann was not great. He did not know what to say – this morning's quarrel aside.</p><p>After that blunder, his anger took over and channelled straight to the fight.</p><p>Locating Mister Twister was easy following the trail of destruction and the screams of civilians lead them straight to the target.</p><p>Aqualad leads the attack Robin provided backup support and Wally distracted via running around giving Mister Twister someone to focus on occasionally landing a few attacks every now and again aggravating their opponent, spreading out enough to get caught by his twisters. Even his brute strength capable of landing blows did nothing to stop the attack, frustration built up the longer the fight persisted, jaw tightening unleashing a fierce roar and charged in connecting his fists together while making a leap upwards slamming them down. A vain attempt. Mister Twister shoot him away straight at a house crumbling burying him beneath the bricks, thankfully his super strength allowed him to endure the attack shrugging off with easy. It did not suppress the growing anger threatening to spill gaining a glance from Robin tossing his grenade shuriken’s setting them off in a small explosion with Aqualad lifting then tossing a large metal bell.</p><p>Mister Twister easily deflected the attack re-focusing his attention back Aqualad while Wally and Robin managed to re-group together.</p><p>
  <em>‘Listen to me. All of you!’ </em>
</p><p>The ringing tone of M’gann’s voice echoed clearly. The throbbing sensation had him instantly clap a hand to the side of his brain suppressing the images of the G-Gnomes and their mind control from surfacing, his teeth gritted angrily unable to keep himself from snapping. “What did we tell you?!” Superboy snapped, angrily.</p><p><em>‘I know!</em>’ She snapped back. <em>‘I know I messed but know I’m clear on what we need to do!’ </em></p><p>After her last attempt? Inwardly, the idea of getting caught off guard did not sit well for him. On the other hand, this had been his chance to make up to her and hearing M’gann’s plan out may even turn the battle around.</p><p>‘You can trust her,’ the familiar sounded voice echoed assumingly.</p><p>Robin’s voice broke through. ‘Wait for you?’</p><p><em>‘Dude!’</em> Wally’s voice emerged urgently. <em>‘Shouldn’t you be resting?’</em></p><p><em>‘I want to pull my weight,’</em> The scarred boy’s voice whispered. <em>‘I want to help. So please hear her out okay?’ </em></p><p>Superboy paused. <em>‘You think it will work?’</em></p><p><em>‘Mostly,’</em> He confirmed.</p><p>A moment before his headed nodded curtly. <em>‘Fine. Let’s hear it.’</em></p><p>Debris scattered aside hearing the turbulence of wing piercing in the air, head cocked towards the source before anything more could be said, red filled his vision and noticed that the rest of the team gathered solemnly. Mister Tornado ceased the attack looking on with curiosity his head held tightly choosing to observe, Red Tornado landed gracefully as they gathered around the so-called ‘Den Mother’ of the Cave. Apprehension filled with the air exchanging subtle glances between one another waiting for the inevitable.</p><p>“Hit the showers boys,” Red Tornado drawled. “I was hoping you could handle this clearly you cannot.”</p><p>Robin protested immediately. “But we have a plan!”</p><p>“The subject is not up for debate!” Red Tornado responded sharply, disapproval dripped in his tone.</p><p>Superboy curled his hands into fists prepare to lash out when the rest hung their heads resigning to their instruction. The desire to give of a piece of his mind bubbled until noticing the tension that seemed to tighten around Red Tornado and Mister Twist, oozing with almost sadistic glee and satisfaction. He knew that this battle had nothing to do with him or the team. The battle had been between the two.</p><p>“I was beginning to believe you were never going to show up!” Mister Twister remarked, glee clear as day.</p><p>Red Tornado would have none of that. “I’m here now.”</p><p>The two wasted no time jumping into the brawl sending out twisters and tornados back and forth dodging or reflecting their attacks back at each other, Mister Twister manoeuvring around the tornados taking control of them than sending them back while Red Tornado disburses them with no effort and re-countering with his own. Their little squabble went back and forth for a short time. The debris from earlier had been cleared creating the move to room despite neither of them moving anywhere even when dodging the remained planted within the same vicinity. Neither managed to overpower the other appearing largely at a stalemate.</p><p>Mister Twister, however, revealed his arrogance once Red Tornado declared their mutual standstill anger ruptured. “No Tornado!” He roared slamming his fists to the ground. “We are NOT equal!” Electricity jolted from his shoulder pads generation through the arms firing at Red Tornado mercilessly trailing the android all over, shattering the stature exploding everywhere bludgeoning to the side of Red Tornado’s head nearly stumbling off knocking him off direction crash landing onto the ground. The looming shadow of Mister Twister could be heard even from a distance the malicious intent obvious by the lack of victory and the tilt of the miniature head, almost as though Mister Twister was waiting for something. A moment or so passed approaching Red Tornado raising his hand slightly with red wires darting towards the back of Red Tornado’s neck preparing to re-program to suit his own needs, almost gloatingly so.</p><p>Red Tornado’s head turned shifted into M’gann’s face.</p><p>“The re-program will take longer than you think!” She smiled and grabbed the wires tightly. Using her telepathy M’gann effortlessly tossed Mister Twister inside a tunnel of wind created none other than by Wally spinning around before coming straight to a halt. That’s when his moment came Superboy darted grabbing hold during the state of bewilderment and confusion punching through the machine-like armour, tripping him off balance to get in another punch. Once the armour appeared to be malfunctioning with the wires popping out from beneath the sheets of metal, the jolts of electricity bouncing back and forth. His arm pulled back waiting for the right second before thrusting his fist forward jamming right through sending the man soaring upwards before plummeting deep underwater with a giant splash. Not even a second passed when Mister Twister was hurtled straight into the sky from the water, Superboy knelt with his hands cupped together outward when the scarred-boy ran towards him jumping on his hands with a mighty yell threw him upwards.</p><p>Whatever the guy did next was amazing waving his arm sharply dismantling the arms and legs collapsing onto the ground while descending downwards landing with a roll cocking his head sharply. Robin jumped in immediately afterwards throwing several of the bat shurikens exploding moments after connecting.</p><p>Mister Twister finally fell. The chest opened rolling out a rather pathetic looking man garbed in green.</p><p>At least that should have been it.</p><p>“M’gann!” Aqualad cried in horror. She raised a giant boulder over the man. “Don’t!”</p><p>The boulder crushed the man immediately. Stunned silence filled with air before Robin marched over angrily.</p><p>“I don’t know how you do things on Mars but on earth we don’t execute our captives!” He snapped coldly.</p><p>M’gann had been undeterred. “You said you trusted me,” with a wave the boulder raised revealing crumbled machinery all over the place. “That’s why I couldn’t read his mind. He was actually a machine.”</p><p>“Yoink!” Wally grinned picking the eyeball. “Souvenir!”</p><p>The scarred-boy glanced. “… Shouldn’t we destroy the rest of it? You know, just to make sure it isn’t listening in or spying on us?”</p><p>“That’s…” Aqualad blinked brows furrowed together thoughtfully. “A rather good idea.”</p><p>Robin tossed another bat shuriken. “I’ll take care of it.”</p><p><strong>Boom</strong>!</p><p>“Thank you, M’gann.” Aqualad smiled. “We should have trusted you more.”</p><p>M’gann shook her head. “No. I deserved that, I jumped to conclusions and nearly placed us all in danger. I’m sorry for my naivety, I’ll try to be more careful in the future.”</p><p>“And we should always thank you too,” Robin added. “For earlier with that shield.”</p><p>The scarred guy blinked. “I didn’t really do much.”</p><p>“C’mon man!” Wally draped an arm. “You totally saved our bacon before!”</p><p>“If not for you Mister Twister might have killed us,” Aqualad spoke softly, his smile warm. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Wally grinned. “You both rocked this mission. You know? Get it? Rocked?”</p><p>Robin groaned. “Just… ignore him.”</p><p>“I should be the ones thanking all of you.” The scarred guy smiled faintly. Emerald hues glanced to him. “I mean, you’re the one that was looking after my body when I was unconscious. Right?”</p><p>Superboy shifted rubbing his neck. “Don’t look too much into it.”</p><p>“He jumped out of the bio-ship and catch ya!” Wally said, the grin widened. “Didn’t even tell us or hesitate!”</p><p>“Shut up!” He snapped, his cheeks glowed red. “I couldn’t leave him to die!”</p><p>“Awww so you do have a heart!” Robin chimed joining in.</p><p>His eyes narrowed slamming his fist into his palm.</p><p>“Anyway,” Aqualad intervened stepping between them. “We thank you for your help and aid. But I do not believe we formally introduced ourselves to you nor have we received your name.”</p><p>The scarred guy gazed momentarily a wistful gleam shinned beautifully beneath the setting sun.</p><p>“Harry,” He answers after a pause. “Just Harry.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The remains of Mister Twister were brought back to the cave courtesy of M’gann levitating the remains after Robin exploded the rest and the armour which the robot piloted, examining the details about their attacker whether any information might be obtained from extracting data. So far Red Tornado seemed nonchalant about the attack, curious thought slightly indifferent altogether. Outright admitting not to have jumped into the battle due to the responsibility falling onto their shoulders, Superboy did not know what to think; be thankful that Red Tornado had some level of faith or offended that the android would not jump in to help when needed. The mission was a chance for them to prove their worth as time since his breakout of Cadmus. Obstacles were thrown at them from M’gann accidentally invading their minds, to his anger and lashing out, the contempt held towards the League blinding them to the enemy and lastly their newest addition; Harry.</p><p>Frankly, Superboy saw no problem with him joining them after shielding and fighting alongside them during the battle against Mister Twister. The unknown aspect of him remained but in a sense being a clone and M’gann being an alien was just as strange, in a way, Harry fit in with the motely little crew they built.</p><p>Wally despite originally vehemently against bringing Harry aboard the bio-ship managed to warm up considerably. He gazed from the corner of his eyes noticing the faintest trail of a smile while the murmurs of chatter echoed through his hair and the laughter from the two and Robin.</p><p>“You are glad,” Aqualad said gaining his attention.</p><p>His brow cocked slightly silently questioning.</p><p>“That he’s with us,” He added with a smile.</p><p>Superboy shrugged slightly. “Not like he has anywhere else to go. Fell out of the sky,” He countered awkwardly in a quiet murmur, ignoring the amused stare.</p><p>“Yes. That is true,” Aqualad agreed. “However, I doubt that the league will be as understanding as we are.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Superboy questioned anger seeped slightly.</p><p>The Atlantean pressed lips together thinly tearing his gaze from him looking at Harry. “We have brought an unknown to our location. Hiding in plain sight or not, bringing a someone that the League does not know about will not sit well with them and with Red Tornado we can assume he’s reported the general report to Batman and the others.”</p><p>“So, what?” Confusion rippled uncertain what the other was getting out. “They’d go and lock him up?”</p><p>“No.” Aqualad’s voice stern. “They would not do such a thing.”</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak before footsteps echoed from the teleporter ceasing all noise hearing the monitor announce the arrival of Batman, Black Canary and Martian Manhunter. Without any words, Superboy followed Aqualad down where the others dwelled knowing what might be happening with a bright light flashing wildly.</p><p>Their stoic expressions said enough.</p><p>“This is the boy?” Batman questioned.</p><p>Red Tornado nodded. “This is correct. He fought alongside the team and protected them from Mister Twister’s assault, judging from the details seen and told I do not believe he is harmful towards us.”</p><p>“He’s still a person of interest,” Black Canary interrupted coolly.</p><p>Martian Manhunter cleared his throat. “We wish to bring you no harm. We have many questions that we desire to ask you.”</p><p>“He didn’t do anything wrong!” Robin defended.</p><p>Wally nodded sharply. “Yeah! He saved us!”</p><p>“And?” Batman questioned. “We don’t know anything about him and neither do you. That makes him a possible leak.”</p><p>Black Canary held her hands up. “We just want to talk with him. The League and him.”</p><p>“The League? As in the entire League?” Aqualad probed surprised.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“We want to ensure that he isn’t a threat,” Batman added.</p><p>Harry strode forwards resigned to his fate. “… Okay. Let’s get this over with.”</p><p>“We’re going with him,” Superboy declared. “You don’t have the right to do that to him without us.”</p><p>M’gann floated over. “That’s right. He’s apart of our team!”</p><p>The three leaguers said nothing before coming to a silent decision with a sharp nod. “Fine. But he will be interrogated alone. Understood?” </p><p> “Fine.”</p><p>None of them was happy about Harry being singled out knowing that nothing they say would deter the League from taking him and thoroughly interrogating them. At least this way the team would be together for moral support. One by one the team gathered around their newest member forming into an almost protective wall.</p><p>The interrogation awaited.</p><p> </p>
