    <p>The fair haired woman looked out into the spring morning as the heavy tension dissipated from the room but the smell of blood remained, filling the room and burning her nostrils all too familiarly. The sun was setting off in the distance, it seemed almost fitting; a lot of things were ending these days, as though the sun were setting forever. The age of darkness was upon them indeed but she knew the sun would rise all the same tomorrow but the dead would remain dead, the powerful would remain powerful and their secret would remain a secret, of that she was positive.</p><p>The Fidelius Charm would ensure that the treachery they committed today would never be known to the world; that she would ensure. She looked into stone grey eyes across the room, then into wild shifty eyes and nodded.</p><p>Her sister’s heavy brow was beaded with sweat as she extended a desperate hand for her own, she took it willingly, “Say you’ll never speak of this moment ever again,” she begged with desperation in her breathy deep voice, “Sister make me this solemn vow.”</p><p>“I shall make you the unbreakable vow,” the fair haired woman spoke in a higher more delicate voice, “No one outside the four of us shall ever know of the travesty of this day; we shall never speak of this to anyone outside this room.”</p><p>They all held hands in elbows as they said the dark words together; she looked from the wild dark eyes of her sister, to the manic eyes of their close friend, to the pale vacant eyes of her sister’s husband, finally they stopped on their secret.</p><p>***</p><p>
  <em>Twelve Years and three months later…</em>
</p><p>The same fair haired woman was reading a book in a crowded bookstore; the day forgotten, the people of that room dissipated but the secret remained their burden to this day- a reality that would always be laced within the confines their souls. She lifted her eyes across the bookstore and the sight that met her left her flabbergasted and breathless; a sight she never thought she would see ever again, for the existence of the secret was based on this particular sight never being in this world.</p><p>For a moment she doubted her vision, praying that her eyesight was failing her, but it was too real to be anything short of her worst nightmare come to life. Cautiously, she moved closer for a second more detailed look, this only served to validate her suspicions.</p><p>“Hello child,” she spoke softly, looking into familiar grey eyes but they were not lifeless, they danced with life like molten silver.</p><p>“Good morning madam,” the child was polite and courteous unlike her own child but that was through no fault of his own. The fair-haired woman looked into the set of familiar pale eyes and this scared her but she would not let it show, “I’m sorry but I can’t say we’ve met.”</p><p>“No, we have not child,” she gave a nervous controlled smile; the words rang like bells in her ears as she saw her sister’s beauty in the child, “Are you a student at Hogwarts?”</p><p>The child smiled and spoke with the same politeness but it might as well have been curses as it only served to punish her, “Yes, I’m a second year.”</p><p>The woman was certain of her fears were true, the secret stood before her; the seer had been wrong, their fears and charities were with no need. Their treasons had been without need, but they now carried the burden without a means to relieve it without destroying that which they were protecting at time and paying the ultimate price. It took all she had to hold back the gaspthat had settled in her throat but could not find it her to hold her smile.</p><p>The secret was now hers alone; gone to the grave were the manic eyes of that old friend, the wild of dark eyes and vacancy of pale eyes were never seen these days; the secret, the child they thought long gone was smiling politely at her but she couldn’t say a word.</p><p>~0~</p><p>Kurt smiled devilishly at his close friends Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom; the anticipation was evident in their faces, each flashing him a bright crocked smile, Hermione’s glitteredwith the prowess of modern orthodontics. They had begged him to begin his story once before but he’d rebuffed them and insisted on only telling the story once, so they sat waiting for Harry Potter and Ron Weasley to join them.</p><p>“We’ll catch them up,” Neville insisted as her stirred in anticipation.</p><p>“No,” Kurt stuck his head out of the compartment as the clock struck twelve, the scarlet engine of the Hogwarts express roared to life but Ron and Harry were yet to materialise, “They’ll be here soon enough.” He struggled to believe his own words though, Kurt kept himself well composed but he feared for the wellbeing of his friends. Ten minutes into the journey he’d resigned to the reality that the two boys wouldn’t be joining them, “maybe they’re too good to know us now.”</p><p>“Don’t over think it,” Hermione scolded and he knew that was exactly what he was doing, he figured that like Finn they had abandoned him to sit with the quidditch jocks.</p><p>“Tell us,” Neville begged.</p><p>“So, I flew from London to Moscow and then to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky; when I got there, they took most of my stuff and I had to hike halfway up the side of the volcano to the base camp,” the pair had leaned in to soak up every detail with their intrigue evident, “On the first night Grand Master Iroh took my wand from me to signal the beginning of my training, from then it was meditation for a week; I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t practice magic, I couldn’t do anything but sit and clear my mind. I sat on the black volcanic rock with the sun beating down on my back by day and the moon illuminating my nights until I managed to get an ember to form between my fingers, I wasn’t allowed to move on till I’d succeeded and it took me six days to get my first ember.”</p><p>“That doesn’t sound like fun,” Neville scowled but Hermione shooed him.</p><p>“It was amazingly invigorating. So, then the following three weeks we did strength training, martial arts and more meditation,” Kurt can see them losing interest, “in the fifth week they taught us wandless magic, we combined the martial arts we’d learned with our ability to conjure an ember started manipulating fire wandlessly.”</p><p>“Shut up!” Hermione exclaimed with wide eyes and a hand clasped over her mouth, “Do you realise how amazing that is, only really advanced witches can master that skill.”</p><p>“I’m far from mastering it,” Kurt giggled modestly trying to stifle a blush, “I know like… two spells and it is a hell of a lot of work.”</p><p>“Do something,” Neville demanded; Kurt was surprised by the force in his voice till he added a soft ‘please’.</p><p>He parted his lips, concentrated on his inner flame and slowly exhaled a small burst of flames. Kurt wasn’t one to underplay his skills, three spells were all they had needed, “We learned to manipulate and create fire and lightning completely wandlessly, we spent the next four weeks perfecting those skills.”</p><p>“In theory, you should be able to do normal spells,” Hermione was telling him, not quite asking him.</p><p>“through out the entire eight weeks, I didn’t have a spare moment to try,” Kurt admitted, “I was too busy writing you guys. By the way, Harry didn’t reply to any of my letters so I gave up half way through the holiday.”</p><p>“I had the same problem,” Hermione added irritably, “his letters were being intercepted by a house elf, and during the second half of the break he was at Ron’s and started replying to my letters.” Kurt raised a questioning brow, “He told me when I saw him in Diagon Alley, he also said he’d be here.”</p><p>Kurt nodded his acknowledgement, “other than Pavarotti’s tragic death, the only other thing I did during the vacation was become an older brother.” Congratulations were shared from all around the compartment, “Harley Drew is an adorable monster, I can’t compete.”</p><p>“I don’t think that’s how siblinghood works,” Hermione chuckled playfully.</p><p>“Breath fire again,” Neville cheered.</p><p>Hermione smile, “No, do something different.”</p><p>Kurt took a deep breath and blue sparks glittered between his fingers as he wiggled them, “What did you do over the vacation?”</p><p>“My gran and I spent a large portion of our vacation with my Great-Uncle Algie,” Neville didn’t sound particularly excited, “He isn’t as much fun now that I’m a wizard, we used to have so much more fun when he was trying to kill me.”</p><p>“Isn’t that what family is about?”</p><p>“I read Vampire Diaries,” Hermione squealed.</p><p>Kurt squealed a reply of “Oh my god!”</p><p>“The Salvator brothers seem so dreamy,” Hermione’s voice was high and melodic as she swayed from side to side with a merry smile, “totally team Stefan.”</p><p>Kurt scrunched his face in distaste, “he is such a pussy, I’m team Damon; the bad boy vibe is slaying me.”</p><p>“I’m not having this fight with you!” Hermione rolled her eyes and moved to change the subject, “I got braces, my dad thought it was time and I now have to go home every eight weeks.”</p><p>“That’s twice during school,” Kurt warned.</p><p>“What are braces?” Neville looked very confused, “Is that the thing on your teeth, I didn’t wanna be rude so I didn’t ask.”</p><p>“Yes Neville,” Hermione giggled, “it is on my teeth to straighten them.”</p><p>“Straighten them?” Neville was perplexed by the idea of sticking something on your teeth to straighten them, “is it charmed?”</p><p>“No, it isn’t magical at all,” Kurt smiled, “it’s a system that uses pressure to realign the teeth.”</p><p>Neville didn’t seem any less confused but shrugged it off, “I also saw Beauty and the Beast.”</p><p>Kurt’s eyes grew wide at Hermione's statement, “Don’t you just love that Céline Dion song?”</p><p>“I die a little bit every time I hear it!” Hermione squealed with stars in her eyes, “that movie gives girls like me hope.”</p><p>“What exactly does that mean?”</p><p>“Well Belle was a very smart girl,” Hermione began, she nervously tucked her hair behind her ear, “she was ostracized because of her intelligence, that’s something I can relate to.”</p><p>“Yeah but in real world equivalents she didn’t do that well,” Kurt argued, “she fell in love with Disney’s equivalent of Crabbe but luckily she kissed him and he turn into a stud muffin. Also Belle was based around her beauty, her intelligence was an afterthought.”</p><p>“which ones Crabbe?” Neville asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, they’re the same thing.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Hermione smiled devilishly, “Belle kind of reminds me of you.”</p><p>“Aww, thank you.”</p><p>“What is wrong with you two?” Neville finally exploded, “Do you agree on anything? How are you friends? And what are you on about?”</p><p>“Vampire Diaries is a book series,” Kurt was patronising as he explained simple preteen culture to a preteen, “Beauty and the Beast is a movie and we’ve covered braces.”</p><p>“Kurt and I may have conflicting opinions but we’re into the same things,” Hermione reassured him, “That aside, aren’t you guys so excited about having Gilderoy Lockhart as our Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher?”</p><p>“Really?” Neville looked quite excited by this news.</p><p>“That explains why we had to buy all his books,” Kurt scrunched up his nose in distaste, “I read a bit of the set works, I have to say I was quite disappointed, and I didn’t learn anything.”</p><p>Hermione looked shocked and scoffed at him, “you obviously weren’t reading them thoroughly and failed to extract the knowledge between the lines.”</p><p>Kurt gave his friend a death stare, “their set work, I’m not supposed to struggle to learn something from them.”</p><p>“You're doing it again,” Neville muttered to himself.</p><p>“Why are you so team touched by my dislike of Lockhart’s written work?” Kurt smirked at his best friend, “The style of writing isn’t even good.”</p><p>Hermione was nervously fiddling with her hair, “I’m not team touched, what does that even mean?”</p><p>“It means you're being overly sensitive,” Kurt teased, “but you're deflecting.”</p><p>“I’m not deflecting,” she tucked large tufts of bushy brown hair behind her ears before she looked out of the window and got to her feet, “I have to go change; I think we’ll be arriving soon. I suggest you do the same.”</p><p>“That’s called deflecting,” Kurt smirked.</p><p>“I’ll go change,” Neville announced stalking out of the compartment leaving Kurt quite confused. Kurt quickly got to work taking off his ordinary clothes; he quickly put on his grey slacks, white oxford, grey knee-highs, black dress shoes, and put on a striped silver and emerald green tie- finally, he threw a black cloak with an emerald green trim and the crest of Salazar Slytherin on the breast. Before his friends returned to join him in the compartment, he took a moment to adjust his perfectly sweeping chocolate brown hair; he was pleased with his appearance.</p><p>Hermione had been correct about the imminence of their arrival, no sooner had they finished changing into their school uniforms had the train slowed to a stop. They had dismounted and loitered on the platform for a moment trying to see if they could spot Ron and Harry in the sea of unfamiliar face as the first years were called over to the boats that would take them totake them up to the school by a large figure that could only be Hagrid.</p><p>Kurt had his Burkin in hand as he, Hermione and Neville climbed into the carriages that took the rest of the students from the train station to the Hogwarts castle, they joined Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan. Kurt had never quite taken to the boys, not since over hearing their opinions of him and Hermione; he was also sure they weren’t fond of him either which served to alleviate any awkwardness he personally felt.</p><p>“Hi guys,” the mocha skinned boy spoke with a cheerydisposition, that was definitely not what Kurt had expected.</p><p>“Kurt,” the second boy spoke his name with a thick Irish accent and Kurt knew that the tension he’d anticipated had been eased, he saw Hermione slump her shoulders, “rumour has it you got to do magic during the summer.”</p><p>His tone seemed accusing, Dean nodded along rigorously, yet they still seemed friendly enough. Kurt wasn’t sure if he was interested in sharing with the near strangers but knew that where there were rumours, there were lies, “it’s true,” he was curt in his reply, he had no desire to reveal the details of his summer to every Tom, Dick and Harry who asked.</p><p>“Is it true you saved the Minister of Magic’s life?” Seamus asked in a loud whisper.</p><p>“No,” Hermione answered for him with pursed lips.</p><p>“Why then?” the boys asked in unison.</p><p>“It’s not important now,” Kurt lifted a perfectly sculpted brow triumphantly as he spoke.</p><p>“Where are Harry and Ron?” Hermione asked as the boys exchanged looks of frustration, “We thought they might have been with you because we haven’t seen them.”</p><p>“We haven’t seen them,” Dean reassured them defensively.</p><p>“Maybe they’re with Fred and George,” Seamus suggested.</p><p>Harry pursed his lips, “that so rude of them,” they had told Hermione they couldn’t wait to hear about his summer but clearly they rather spend more of their time with Fred and George.</p><p>“Rude?” Dean looked confused.</p><p>Hermione answered for him, “we had an appointment that they didn’t honour.”</p><p>“An appointment they set,” Kurt added distastefully. He watched the boys exchanging knowing looks, “I’m sorry, do you have something you wish to share?”</p><p>“No,” Dean’s eyes went wide and he lifted his hands in surrender, “nothing.”</p><p>“You’re a bit of a bitch,” Seamus added when an awkward silence washed over the group, “nobody likes you.”</p><p>Kurt let out a gasp, “People think I’m only ‘a bit’ of a bitch.”</p><p>“How dare they!” Hermione looked equally horrified.</p><p>“Everybody knows I’m the king of bitch,” Kurt ran his fingertips through his bangs. He turned to Seamus, “it’s like everyone thinks you're an asshole but they don’t diminish that by adding ‘a bit’.”</p><p>Seamus’s ears turned beet red as he scowled at a smirking Kurt, “I can understand why Ron and Harry are avoiding you.”</p><p>“Looking at your face I can understand why girls are avoiding you,” Kurt sneered, everyone in the carriage laughed at the boy’s expense as they dismounted.</p><p>The carriage had come to a stop in front of the great stone steps that led into the castle and up to the great hall. Kurt and the rest of the group of second years walked into the castle with his bag at hand. Kurt had broken off from the group to join his own house, Slytherin; though he had singlehandedly sabotaged Slytherin’s win of the House Cup last year, he was still prideful of the silver and emerald green colours. Kurt took his seat amongst the most unpleasant of all the second years, Draco Malfoy and Millicent Bulstrode. He sat quietly, not paying much attention as Professor Dumbledore offered them a few words of wisdom for the beginning of term. He didn’t know any of the first years so paid little mind to the sorting ceremony, his thoughts were elsewhere; people thought he was a bitch, he wasn’t surprise but he was upset that they said it behind his back.</p><p>Kurt was swimming in his anger when he realised someone was talking to him, “What?” he spoke generally, unable to identify the voice that had been humming in the background.</p><p>“I asked how your summer was,” Goyle smiled at him from across the table, Kurt leaned back trying not physically shudder at the look.</p><p>“Uneventful,” Kurt spoke dismissively. The boy leaned forward and looked searchingly into Kurt, “I did normal everyday things, muggle things.”</p><p>“I saw a muggle film in London,” the boy seemed excited to find a common interest, “reminded me of you.”</p><p>Kurt raised a defeated brow, “you also saw Beauty and the Beast?” the boy nodded excitedly, “it seems everybody on the planet has seen that movie.”</p><p>Kurt longed for anyway to get away from the mundane conversation but couldn’t think of a reasonable excuse, the feast seemed to be dragging on forever. He finally grew tired of the hum of a conversation he wasn’t remotely interested in, “I’m over this.” Kurt got up and switched tables to the Hufflepuff long table; “move up.”</p><p>“Kurt,” Finn looked surprised to see him but smiled at him none the less, “I don’t have your extra books here.”</p><p>“I know,” Kurt smiled, before turning to Finn’s friends with a polite smile, “Hi.” They mumbled feeble replies, “What are you up to?”</p><p>Finn’s nose turned a violent crimson, “He’s been telling us about his new little sister,” Cedric spoke with a velvety smooth tenor, “says you named her.”</p><p>“Am not!” Finn exclaimed defensively, shaking his head vigorously.</p><p>Kurt ignored his brother and smiled broadly at the taller boy, though the difference in their heights had been reduced by Kurt’s minor growth spurt, “Cedric,” Kurt could feel the blood rushing up his neck, showing as a pink tinge creeping above his collar, “How are you?”</p><p>“I’m well and yourself,” Cedric leaned forward and Kurt felt a wave of heat coming over him as the handsome fourth year grinned at him, “did you have a good summer?”</p><p>“My summer was nothing worth mentioning,” Kurt said modestly, playing coy with a flutter of his long luscious lashes.</p><p>“I heard your nightingale died,” Cedric looked empathetic.</p><p>“Yeah, that kind of dampened the mood…” Kurt’s voice trailed off, not really wanting to talk about death, “but there was enough positive to offset the bad; Harley Drew was born, I spent some educational time in east Russia and I had a blast with my brother. Tell me Cedric, what did you do?”</p><p>“I practiced my quidditch,” Kurt was listening intently to the boy’s every word thinking only of how handsome he was, “I’m hoping to be promoted to seeker when Joel graduates end of this year.”</p><p>“Seeker?” Kurt asked in a low breathy voice, he hoped he was flirting as well as he thought he was, “I think you’ll be great at it.”</p><p>The older boy blushed lightly and smiled broadly at Kurt, “You're too kind.”</p><p>“All students are to follow their house prefects to their house dormitories,” Professor Dumbledore announced from his podium interrupting their conversation, Kurt cringed internally but didn’t allow his smile to falter.</p><p>“Till we meet again,” Cedric wagged his left brow, all Kurt could do not to embarrass himself was smile coyly.</p><p> He got up and followed his peers through the maze of familiar hallways and staircases down to the dungeons with a happy glow about him, paying no mind to his peers as they gossiped and murmured under their breath; Kurt suspected they were speculating about the rumours of Kurt’s summer and discussing their dislike of him but he couldn’t bring himself to care from his high.</p><p>He filed into the common room and sat down in one of the quilted black leather couches that were scattered around the green lit Slytherin common room, it seemed that the commotion had attracted the giant squid to the windows that separated the Black lake from the Hogwarts dungeons. The older students had moved on to their rooms but the second years and the first years remained for further instruction. He relaxed as the head of house, Severus Snape, divided the first years into their dorm rooms before turning to the second years.</p><p>“As for you,” he looked at the group of about twenty students indifferently, “you will return to your rooms from the previous years.”</p><p>It was only when they were being assigned their rooms that the glow of summer was washed away, he was still rooming with Dumb, Dumber and Obnoxious.</p><p>~0~</p><p>“Look at those mindless imbeciles,” Kurt scowled in contempt as he and Hermione satbeside a large group of preteen boys while trying to eat their breakfast, “worshipping them as though they’ve done something commendable.”</p><p>“I can’t believe they only got detention,” Hermione complained as she adjusted the Alice band Kurt had placed on her head, “I swear they always get preferential treatment without having done anything to deserve it.”</p><p>They scowled at the boys over the breakfast spread, “And the arrogance with which they’re strutting about is what’s grating my tits.”</p><p>“Being bitchy teenagers is the best,” Hermione smiled at him and he knew her words were true, “guess who I see looking over here.”</p><p>Kurt’s eyes grew wide, “I can’t do this right now, it’s my first day of school and I can’t be thinking about boys.”</p><p>Neville dropped into the seat beside him gasping for air, “Did I miss the mail? My gran’s sending the stuff I forgot.”</p><p>“I think it’s about to arrive,” Hermione said sweetly before turning to stare Kurt down, “You’ve never been nervous about school, why are you deflecting.”</p><p>Kurt leaned in closer to his friend and lowered his voice, “Cedric is now officially a senior student, according to everything we know about teenagers, that makes him too cool for second years.” Kurt shrank deeper into his seat, “he probably thinks of me as his very good looking and intelligent younger brother.”</p><p>“psshht, people don’t stare across the great hall at their brothers.”</p><p>“Percy is staring at Ron,” Kurt retorted.</p><p>“Percy is a creep,” Hermione countered, they were interrupted from their conversation by the loud crashing of a grey owl into the pitcher of milk in front of them. Hermione and Kurt had snatched up their books and got to his feet as the milk spilled to the floor.</p><p>“Who is responsible for the owl that has ruined my robes,” Kurt screeched looking about the great hall, he noticed Ron turning as red as his hair. Kurt scoffed, rolled his eyes, waved his wand and cleaned the mess.</p><p>Ron grabbed the scarlet envelope casually, doubting he could possibly be more embarrassed but he was so wrong; as soon as he broke the wax seal on the envelope there was a loud echoing shout filling the room and shook the furniture, “Ronald Billius Weasley!”</p><p>Kurt was shocked by the firm booming voice, it went on, “How dare you take that flying car? You had absolutely no right to do so! Do you understand the consequences of your irresponsible behaviour are? Do you understand what kind of danger you put yourself and Harry? Your father is now facing an enquiry at work! If you put so much as a toe out of line I will bring you straight home, do you understand?”</p><p>Ron nodded nervously, the voice turned sweet and nurturing, “Oh Ginny, your father and I are so proud you made Gryffindor.”</p><p>For the first time Kurt noticed the embarrassed flame haired little girl sitting meekly on her own beside the other first years. Kurt felt like justice had been served when he saw how truly embarrassed both Ron and Harry looked, they had turned simultaneously white and red.</p>
