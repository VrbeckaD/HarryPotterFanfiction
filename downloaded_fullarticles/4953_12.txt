    <p>The Letter</p><p>There was a knock at the door as a small Jackson Overland jumped down the stairs two at a time. He reached the bottom step and landed with a giant thud, laughing as he did so. He looked up at the front door to see whoever had knocked on the door’s silhouette framed through the frosted glass panel. Now it was safe to say that Jack didn’t usually open the door to strangers but for some reason seeing the strange silhouette made him curious and so he did the thing that his mother had always told him not to do and he opened the door to a stranger. </p><p>“Hello Jackson.” The stranger said with a wide smile. Jack gazed up at the stranger with wide eyes. This stranger was the most strangest man he had ever seen.  He was wearing a large robe that spilled out along the floor and it was covered with small shadows of moons and stars. The boy looked up at the man’s to face to see he couldn’t tell if he was young or old but had a fine head of white hair that still confused Jack about the man’s true age. There were a few wrinkles around the stranger’s eyes that only creased up even more as he smiled at Jack, they twinkled as Jack noticed they were a piercing shade of green.</p><p>“May I come in?” The man asked, his voice quiet but it was almost like there was an area of authority in it that Jack obeyed as he nodded his head. He moved away from the door to let the stranger in.</p><p>“Thank you.” The man said with a smile, his eyes glittering as he walked straight into Jack’s small home.</p><p>Just at the moment, Jack’s mother came out of the kitchen carrying his six year old sister on her hip. Jack turned around to look at her. His mother looked tired, she was wearing a cooking apron and her messy brown hair that Jack had inherited was thrown up in a makeshift bun that was falling to one side. His sister, Emma, had cake mix all over her face and in her hair. She was currently in the middle of licking it off her fingers. </p><p>“I’ve told you a million times Jackson! You’re not supposed to answer the door to strangers! Let me get to the door first.” His mother shouted approaching her son and letting Emma go. The six year old ran straight back into the kitchen and a few seconds later there was a large bang. </p><p>“I’m sorry Mom.” Jack muttered, hiding his face from view. He wasn’t sorry at all. </p><p>His mother sighed and then winced as she heard the banging. All through this, the strange man had been watching silently.</p><p>“Will you just go and deal with your sister, while I talk to this man?” She asked.</p><p>Jack nodded and was about to run into the kitchen when the strange man spoke.</p><p>“I’m afraid Mrs Overland that I need Jack here. For I have something for him,” The man went into his pocket and brought out a brown envelope. “Once he has read, I’m sure there will be lots of questions, even from you Mrs Overland.”</p><p>Mrs Overland was too shocked to even say anything. Instead she just stared with wide brown eyes as the man handed the envelope to Jack. </p><p>Jack took it off him and it held it in his hands. On the envelope it read. Mr J Overland with his home address written in a very looping and swirly calligraphy. </p><p>“Is this for me?” He asked a little bewildered, the 11 year old wasn’t sure what was going on.</p><p>“Yes, why don’t you go ahead and open it?” The man returned.</p><p>Jack ripped the envelope open and two large pieces of parchment fell onto the ground. He quickly picked them up and studied it. On top of the first piece of parchment, there was an logo with four creatures in it. Jack could just make out a snake, a lion, a badge and eagle. He then realised that it wasn’t really a label, no it was a coat of arms. Looking further down the letter, he noticed that the letter was sent in the same handwriting. He continued to read.</p><p>Hogwarts School<br/>
Of Witchcraft and Wizardry </p><p>Headmaster: Tsar Lunar ( Professor Moon)</p><p>Dear Mr Overland,</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on the 1st September. We await your owl no later than 31st July.</p><p>Yours Sincerely </p><p>Katherine Goose<br/>
Deputy Headmistress</p><p>Jack read the letter again. He had to be imagining it. He had been accepted to a school of magic? He was sure he was dreaming. Just to make sure he was, he looked at the second piece of parchment that contained a list of books that he needed for this so called school. Then he noticed at the very bottom that along with these books, he needed a wand and a uniform.</p><p>“I’m confused.” Jack said looking up at the man.</p><p>The man chuckled. “I thought you might as well be, my name is Tsar Lunar although I’m mostly known as Professor Moon. The reason that I came out to you today Jackson is tell you that you’re a wizard.” </p><p>“I’m a what?” Jack said baffled.</p><p>“A wizard.”</p><p>Jack tried to hide in his shock. He was a wizard? But how could that be? He had never done anything strange, he wasn’t magical. </p><p>Before Jack could ask how he was, his mother interrupted. “Can someone please just explain to me what is going on?” She said hysterical looking to her son and then the man. </p><p>“Yes I do believe that I can.” Professor Moon said with a smile. “Shall we go into the living room?” </p><p>Jack and his mother followed and the man sat down on the couch. He pulled out a knobbly brown wand, said a few words that Jack didn’t understand and all of a sudden there were two cups of tea. </p><p>“Magic.” Jack whispered, not believing his eyes. He was able to do this. He was going to learn how he was going to do magic!</p><p>“How am I a wizard?” Jack asked, a little surprised.</p><p>“Have you ever noticed strange things happen when you’re around?” Professor Moon replied and Jack nodded. How his clothes always seemed to change colours or when he knew what the weather forecast was going to be without watching it on the tv. The more Jack thought about it, the more it made sense. He was magic!</p><p>“How is he a wizard? What absurdity is this!” His mother commented, looking like she was about to faint at any given moment. She was eyeing the tea cups as if they were going to explode at any moment.</p><p>“Ah of course Jackson is from a muggle family but every year, in the ministry of magic, there is a list written of year’s students and there are always muggleborn witches and wizards who have inherited rare traits to allow them to channel magic.” </p><p>“What’s a muggle?” Jack asked, looking up at the Professor in excitement. He was magic! He was a wizard! Jack couldn’t believe.</p><p>“A non magic person, much like your family.” Professor Moon said with a smile.</p><p>For the next half an hour, Jack started to bomb Professor Moon with question after question about Hogwarts and the magical community. His mother meanwhile seemed to have gone white. Emma had seemed to have been forgotten and Jack knew that the kitchen was going to be a right state when his mother finally got over her shock. Once he had finished probing the Professor. Professor Moon turned to his mother.</p><p>“Mrs Overland, are you okay? I know this this will be quite a shock to the system but Jack will be well looked after at Hogwarts. He will be with young witches and wizards just like him who were born from muggle families.”</p><p>It took some time but finally Mrs Overland nodded. “I-I just don’t believe it, magic’s real. My son’s a wizard. Somehow this just feels like I’m in a bizarre dream.”</p><p>“Oh don’t worry Mrs Overland, it can seem like a dream but this is in very fact real. I think I will take my leave, I think I have explained more than enough.” Professor Moon stood and Jack stared at them.</p><p>“Sir but how will I get my wands and robes. How will I get to the school? I don’t know where it is.” He said, his voice raised in panic.</p><p>“I will explain that all next year, Jackson. I will be coming myself on the 31st July to take you to Diagon Alley, all you need to do is wait.” He replied.</p><p>Jack couldn’t wait 10 months! It was true he had only just turned 11 a couple of days ago as his birthday fell on the Winter Solstice but 10 whole months? He couldn’t wait that long. Before Jack could protest there was a large crackling sound and and the Professor had disappeared. </p><p>He looked over at his mother who seemed to be getting over shock, a little step at a time.</p><p>“It’s going to take some getting used to….I just can’t believe it.” His mother muttered looking over at her son. He was so special to him and for some reason she felt quite proud. There was a wizard in the family.</p><p>“I feel proud of you Jackson, I’d better go and check on Emma.” She stood up and walked into the kitchen. </p><p>Jack meanwhile was beaming from ear to ear, he just couldn’t quite believe it! This time next year, he would be learning magic and going to school at Hogwarts!</p>
