    <p>“Come <em>on</em>, Romy! Do you want to be the last ones on the train?” The older girl’s voice rang out impatiently, piercing through the foggy air as she emerged onto the busy platform.<br/>
“I’m coming, I’m coming, this is heavy, you know! If you’d stop hogging Beastie and push your own things I’d be a bit faster, you’re bigger than me anyway, you don’t <em>need </em>an elf to carry it all!” her sister protested, panting, from a few feet behind her; her tone excited despite the effort of lugging a heavy trunk and a caged barn owl along on a rattling trolley.<br/>
“If you don’t hurry everyone will already have found seats and we won’t get to choose where to go! You don’t want to sit with just <em>anyone </em>you know!” replied the first, rolling her heavy-lidded eyes in exasperation.</p>
<p>Bellatrix and Andromeda Black were almost identical in appearance. From the glittering darkness of their deep-set eyes to their sharp cheekbones and full, heart-shaped lips; the two oldest Black sisters bore an unmistakeable resemblance to one another. Their only visible differences were the warmer brown of Andromeda’s corkscrew curls next to the tumble of shining black ringlets adorning her older sister’s head, and perhaps three inches of height that Bellatrix had put on since starting at Hogwarts, being just over a year the elder. Their youngest sister, Narcissa, was quite different – thinner and paler, her white-blonde hair hung straight down her back. Eight years old and looking thoroughly miserable, she sat atop Bellatrix’s luggage on its trolley, sucking her thumb and sniffling as the pile of bags seemed to trundle along of its own accord.</p>
<p>“If you please, Miss Bella and Miss Romy’s parents isn’t seeing them for some months now!” came a squeaky voice from behind the mountain of luggage preceding the girls along the platform. “You isn’t wanting your mother to hear that her girls is fighting just when they is off to Hogwarts, young Mistresses!” The creature the voice was coming from drew stares from the other students boarding the train. Despite its neglected appearance – dressed in a scrap of old blanket, with a homely face and a squashed, snout-like nose that appeared to have been broken more than once – those who recognised it as a house-elf knew it represented seriously old money. The girls it was accompanying, however, seemed relatively unimpressed by their own good fortune, as Bellatrix scowled at the elf pushing her trunk, broom and cat-carrier and Andromeda hauled her own bags behind her.<br/>
“Beastie, you know Mama would be horrified if we ended up sitting with any old scum on the train, I want to find Euphemia and the Lestranges before all the seats are gone!” spat Bellatrix, while glaring at Andromeda. “If <em>somebody </em>doesn’t get a move on, we’re going to end up making nice with the Prewetts, or worse, explaining to some ignorant mudblood the difference between a galleon and a knut.” She laughed derisively, before glancing ahead to see Narcissa still weeping as the elf pushed her along. Bellatrix pursed her lips before apparently relenting somewhat. “Hush, Cissy, we’ll be back before you know it. I’ll write every week this year, Romy will let me borrow Damocles, won’t you, Romy?” She looked pointedly at the middle sister, who was pushing her trunk and owl to a stop in front of the train door. Having caught her breath, Andromeda, too, realised the sorry state of her youngest sister and abandoned her trolley to lift her down from Bellatrix’s.<br/>
“There there, Ciss, I’m sorry I have to go away but it won’t be long until you start at Hogwarts, too! And yes, Bella, I suppose you can borrow him to write to Cissy. I probably won’t be sending that many letters anyway. I’ll write home as soon as I’m sorted, though!”<br/>
Bellatrix rolled her eyes again, as their industrious elf began hauling the girls’ bags onto the train for them. She planted her hands on her hips and raised an eyebrow at Andromeda.<br/>
“You’ll be in Slytherin. The whole family is, it’s tradition, you know. Anyway, Mama and Papa would throw a fit if you weren’t.”</p>
<p>Andromeda blushed as she looked up at her eldest sibling, who had stepped up into the carriage doorway, adding to their difference in height.<br/>
“They wouldn’t really, would they? I mean, of course I want to be in Slytherin, Bella, but what if I get put somewhere else? You don’t get much say, do you? And you <em>still </em>won’t tell me what the test is to decide!” Receiving no satisfactory answer as Bellatrix scoffed and turned to make her way further down the carriage, Andromeda turned back to Narcissa, still sniffling on the platform, now holding the hand of the harried-looking Beastie. “Cheer up, Ciss, maybe Mama can take you over to Uncle Orion’s house if you’re lonely? Cousin Sirius is only three, he needs a big grown-up girl like you to set him an example! And say hello to him from me, will you? I don’t think he’s that happy about me going away, either.”<br/>
“I don’t wanna play with cousin Sirius, last time I went he got Drooble’s in my hair!” whined Narcissa, as the whistle blew on the platform and her sister drew her close and kissed the top of her golden head.<br/>
“Well, I’m sure he didn’t mean to, dear” Andromeda replied, smiling, but inwardly reflecting that he probably had. “And baby Reggie should be harmless enough if you don’t want to play with Sirius. Bye-bye, now – take care of her, Beastie, and tell Mama and Papa we’ll write!” She jumped into the carriage as a guard came along to shut the door.<br/>
“<em>ROMYYY!” </em>Came Bellatrix’s voice from the next carriage.<br/>
“Coming!” Andromeda called as the train started to move. She waved to Narcissa and the elf on the platform, as Beastie called after her:<br/>
“Farewell Miss Romy! Good luck at Sorting, Miss Romy must follow her sister’s lead and honour the noble house of Black!”</p>
<p>And just like that, the figures on the platform disappeared in the train’s smoky wake. Andromeda turned, and hurried to follow her sister through the carriage.</p>
