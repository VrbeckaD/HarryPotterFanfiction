    <p>The underground was hot and stuffy, as per usual. Hermione sighed. If only her job didn’t require her to use this mode of transportation. It couldn’t be helped though. She would just have to deal with it. </p><p>A hand rubbed her ass.</p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes. That didn’t take very long. </p><p>She counted for 10 seconds. She had to wait those 10 seconds to be sure. During those 10 seconds, the hand continued to feel her up. Rubbing and squeezing her ass and thighs. </p><p>8...9...10. Time’s up. </p><p>Hermione whirled around and cuffed the man’s hands behind his back. </p><p>“Gah!” the man cried, startled. </p><p>“Come along quietly,” Hermione smirked. “You’re under arrest.”</p><p>Once the train stopped, she led the man through the crowd and onto the platform. The man grumbled the whole time as she brought him to the station office. </p><p>He sure did pick the wrong target. Hermione Granger wasn’t just an attractive woman riding the underground, she was an undercover officer whose sole purpose was to catch molesters. </p><p>She was perfect for the job. As she grew up, her body matured into a beautiful shapely form that attracted men’s gazes the minute they caught a glance of her. Her large breasts and her soft, firm behind seemed almost bewitching to any man. She always wore tight, short clothing that accentuated her assets. Anything that would draw men to her. She was also extremely intelligent, knowing the ideal spots for perverts to lurk and the best ways to lure them out. With her cool judgment and skill in self-defense, she excelled at her position. </p><p>Her friends and family often asked her what made her choose such a profession. They all expected her to become a doctor, or scientist, or anything that would put her mind to use. Hermione just replied by saying she wanted to help as many women as possible to avoid what had happened to her years ago. </p><p>It seemed to satisfy their curiosity for the time being, but Hermione knew they would confront her about it again soon enough. Only her parents and the police were fully aware as to what the extent of her torment was. Her friends and extended family didn’t know, and she wasn’t ever going to tell them. All they knew was that she had been attacked on the underground as a child. </p><p>But Hermione never mentioned her main motivation for doing what she did. Yes, she wanted to help other women, but her real desire was much more selfish. </p><p>She wanted to find the man who defiled her. The man who corrupted her childhood and gave her scars that would never heal. The man whose dark eyes she saw in her nightmares. She wanted to personally lock him up and make him pay for what he did. She wanted to see that smug grin finally leave his face. </p><p>It was because of him that she gained her secret weapon. The thing that allowed her to do her job better than anyone else ever could. </p><p>She was completely frigid. </p><p>No matter where they touched her or how they rubbed her, she felt nothing from any of the molesters she arrested. That’s what made it possible for her to have her 10-second rule. If Hermione wanted anything, she wanted justice. She would be completely torn up if she caused an innocent person to get arrested, and with how crowded and bumpy the underground was, accidents were very easy to happen. So, when she felt someone touching her she waited 10 seconds to see if they were a molester, or if it was just an accident. If they turned out to be a molester, she would have them arrested by the 11th second. </p><p>And with her superpower, she didn’t feel a thing. </p><p>It was still early in the afternoon when she dropped the man off at the station. Hermione checked her watch. If she got on the next train, she could hang around for a few more stops before having to head home and get ready for Ron and Luna’s anniversary dinner. She couldn’t help but smile to herself as she got on the train. It had been a while since she and her friends had all gotten together. It would be nice to see them all. Also, Ron was an excellent chef and was definitely going to go all out. Dinner was sure to be a magnificent affair. </p><p>A hand rubbed against her, but before she could even begin counting, it moved away. Hermione didn’t think anything of it. Hands brushed against her constantly. A few minutes later, a hand rubbed her ass again and moved away after 3 seconds. A little while more had passed when she felt a hand against her yet again. This time it stayed for 5 seconds before leaving. Hermione was on guard now. She wasn’t sure if all of this belonged to the same person, but she wasn’t going to be caught unawares. </p><p>Hermione was felt up 4 more times. Each one under her 10-second limit, but the time between each one grew closer and closer together. She was sure that this was all the work of a single individual, even if she couldn’t turn around to check due to the bodies all around her. Hermione kept her fingers close to her cuffs, ready to whip them out at a moment’s notice. </p><p>The next time he touched her, his hands stayed on her for 10 seconds. </p><p>Gotcha, Hermione thought with a smirk. She reached for her cuffs, but they weren’t there. </p><p>Click. </p><p>Hermione’s heart sunk. She found her cuffs alright. Somehow the person behind her had managed to get them away from her and lock them around her wrists. </p><p>Of all the things to go wrong. </p><p>“You sure do got some interesting stuff on ya,” a silky male voice came from behind her. “You into S&amp;M or something?”</p><p>As he spoke, he brought his hands back to her body. One held her in place at her waist while the other rubbed her ass over her tiny miniskirt. </p><p>The only positive that Hermione could see in this situation was that he hadn’t seemed to have realized that she was an undercover officer. With that, she could wait for him to let his guard down and arrest him at the next stop. She pulled out a small pin hidden in her bracelet and began picking at the lock on the handcuffs. She wasn’t the best at this, but she had time. The next stop was in 20 minutes. After that, it was all over for this guy. </p><p>The man moved his hand from her ass to her pussy. </p><p>“How strange,” he murmured in her ear. “You’re not wet at all.” Hermione couldn’t help but smirk. How she loved her superpower. “I thought you were too calm but does this not feel good at all? That’s too bad.”</p><p>He started stroking and rubbing at her pussy, teasing her clit. His other hand moved to her breasts, squeezing them and pinching her nipples. As usual, Hermione was unmoved by it all. She continued to try and unlock herself, almost ignoring his ministrations entirely. </p><p>“You are quite the girl,” the stranger said, sounding almost amused. “If I were to tease any other woman this way, I’d have her cumming in an instant. But you, you’re different.”</p><p>‘Yes I am,’ Hermione thought smugly. She was almost there, almost free. </p><p>“Perhaps you’re frigid,” he hissed. </p><p>Hermione froze. Sure, it didn’t change anything now that he knew her secret, and he would have been an idiot if he hadn’t figured it out after all of this, but she still didn’t like that he was aware of her superpower. It made her feel more exposed. </p><p>“Hm,” the man hummed. “I understand now. You are frigid, and that’s why you’re unresponsive to me, but I can tell that it’s not a physical thing.” Hermione stayed frozen by his voice, unable to keep picking her lock. “It’s just something in your mind forcibly pushing down any pleasure you feel.”</p><p>Hermione shivered. The man chuckled. </p><p>“In that case,” he whipped her around and pushed her back against the wall behind her. “I’m just going to have to release it for you.”</p><p>Hermione’s breath caught in her throat as she looked at the man before her. </p><p>It was him. The guy who molested, raped, and kidnapped her all those years ago. He was older now, but he was definitely the same guy. He had the same dark hair, same smoldering eyes, same infuriating grin. </p><p>He cupped her cheek in his hand. “It’s so nice to see you again, Hermione.”</p><p>He pulled her against him and pressed his lips against hers. </p><p>“Eeh!” Hermione squealed. Her eyes bulged. She tried to push him away but found that her body wouldn’t do as it was told. The man wrapped one arm around her waist, holding her close to him, his hand squeezing at her supple flesh. He forced her lips open and plundered her mouth with his tongue. He entwined it with hers, making her almost gag. </p><p>“Aah!” she suddenly gasped, dropping her pin to the floor. Something strange coursed through her body. Something she hadn’t felt in so many years. What was it? </p><p>The man turned her back around and started licking her ear. His hands moved to her breasts, kneading them and pinching at her nipples. Hermione squirmed against him, her body feeling hot. </p><p>“I knew it,” she could feel the man grinning against her ear. “You’re not frigid at all. Your mind was just suppressing any and all pleasure you could possibly feel.”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t help the moan that escaped her lips when he tugged at her nipples. As part of her uniform to attract men, she only wore a tight tank top with no bra. This offered her little to no protection against his assault, which she could now feel in its entirety. </p><p>“The mind is a wonderful and curious thing, isn’t it Hermione? You’ve managed to keep your pleasure locked away for 10 years, all through sheer force of will, and with one look at me, it’s completely open again. Your body can feel pleasure correctly now, and maybe since you were frigid for so long, you might even be more sensitive than a normal woman now.”</p><p>Hermione’s entire body was shaking. She couldn’t think straight. His touch was driving her insane. </p><p>“How does it feel after so long?” He pressed his hand against her pussy. </p><p>Hermione gasped, her entire body lurching forward. She tried to squeeze her legs together, but he managed to keep his hand between them, rubbing her. </p><p>“Looks like it feels so good you can’t stop yourself,” the man chuckled. </p><p>‘This can’t be real,’ Hermione thought. ‘This can’t be happening.’</p><p>“Does it feel good?” he asked as he continued to stroke her most sensitive of places. ‘You’re about to cum, I can tell. The instant you do, you’ll have lost.”</p><p>Hermione tried to fight against him, she really did. She couldn’t give in. She couldn’t let him win. But she could feel all control slipping away from her rapidly. She couldn’t endure this. </p><p>The man pressed his hand to her mouth and pinched her clit. </p><p>“Hmfgng!” Hermione screamed against him as her body exploded and she came for the first time in 10 years. </p><p>She lay her forehead against the wall. Her legs felt like jelly, and she could feel some liquid trickling down her legs. But even so, the man did not give up his assault.”</p><p>“Would you look at that,” he said, continuing to rub her pussy even after she just came. “You’re soaked. I knew you’d enjoy this.”</p><p>He pulled her against him so she was standing upright again. His other hand tapped at her belly. She moaned and twitched against him. </p><p>“Such nice reactions,” he chuckled. “I’ve never met anyone who is as fun to tease as you, Hermione.” </p><p>He lifted her tank top, exposing her breasts on the train. He rubbed her bare breasts and pinched her nipples. </p><p>“How does it feel to have your nipples touched for the first time in so long?” He leaned around and licked one of the little buds, pulling it into his mouth and sucking it. </p><p>Hermione threw her head back, biting her lip to keep from crying out obscenely. She couldn’t do anything. She couldn’t stop him. It felt too good. Why was it happening to her? What did she do to deserve such humiliation? It was too much.</p><p>Why oh why was it feeling so good?</p><p>The man brought his hand back to her panties, and this time dipped it inside. Hermione trembled and moaned as he rubbed against her bare pussy. </p><p>“Do you like that?” he asked, releasing her nipple. “You’re fighting a lot less, so I guess you do.”</p><p>Two of his fingers entered her. His other hand slapped over her mouth just as she let out a loud moan. Her body bucked against his as he thrust his fingers in and out of her. </p><p>“Is it too much for you to handle?” he chuckled. </p><p>As soon as he said that, Hermione came again. She could barely register him pulling her panties down. </p><p>Just as she had recovered from that second orgasm, he plunged his cock into her without any warning. </p><p>“HNNNNG!” Hermione screamed against his hand. </p><p>“It’s no use,” he said as he pounded into her. “No matter how much your mind denies the pleasure, your body will still feel it.”</p><p>The hand not covering her face returned to her chest, squeezing and rubbing the fleshy orbs. His pace increased. </p><p>“All that pleasure from the past 10 years has been building up inside your body. All of which I’m going to release here and now.”</p><p>‘No.’ Hermione thought. ‘That can’t happen.’ But a part of her knew it was no use to resist. She could feel another orgasm coming fast. </p><p>“Now then,” the man said. Hermione could just barely see the brilliant white light about to consume her. “How will you handle it?”</p><p>All of the pleasure Hermione had been accumulating within her exploded out of her exactly as he had said it would. The force of it was so much that she couldn’t even scream. She could only writhe against him. She couldn’t control her body. She couldn't do anything at all. </p><p>“Well? How does it feel?” the man asked, still plunging in and out of her like a jackhammer. Even if he wasn’t covering her mouth, Hermione still wouldn’t have been able to answer him. The orgasm was still quaking throughout her body, not seeming to be leaving her anytime soon. She couldn’t move. She couldn’t even think straight. </p><p>She couldn’t do anything at all.</p>
