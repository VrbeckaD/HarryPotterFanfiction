          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale begins in Rodolphus and Walden Lestrange's house. They're just coming home for the first time with their new born son Raphael.</p><p>Walden sat down with a sigh.</p><p>Rodolphus set Raphael who was fast asleep in his car seat down beside them and muttered, "Who knew fatherhood was this hard?"</p><p>Walden smirked ever so slightly. "They all warned us, Rod. Come to think of it even Voldemort did!"</p><p>Rodolphus asked, "You don't believe that nonsense about him and Bella do you?"</p><p>Walden admitted, "I'm sceptical, but the child does have characteristics of them both in her."</p><p>Rodolphus glanced first at baby Raphael fast asleep, then at Walden and looked upwards sighing. "This feels just right, all three of us together I mean."</p><p>Walden was silent.</p><p>Rodolphus turned back towards Walden who was sound asleep where he sat. He smiled. "I think we all need a rest, Waldo."</p><p>He cuddled into him and soon he too was sleeping peacefully.</p></div>
