          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Here, I’ve got something we can use,” Harry offered, digging in his sack.</p><p>“What the ever-loving fuck are these?” Malfoy demanded, holding the offered objects away from him with two fingers outstretched as if they were somehow contaminated.</p><p>“Extendable Ears? You know, for <i>listening in on secret conversations</i> like the one our suspects are having <i>right this minute</i>?”</p><p>Malfoy looked dubious, but eventually conceded to placing one end in his ear and the other under the door. “This had better work.”</p><p>“It will.” That they were currently outside of Borgin and Burkes was an irony not lost on Harry. This was almost exactly what he’d been doing when he overheard Draco asking about the Vanishing Cabinets in sixth year. He twisted his lips at the memory.</p><p>Unfortunately, his reaction was enough to tip Malfoy off. He slanted a piercing look over to Harry before once more focusing on the task at hand and threatening, “This conversation isn’t over.”</p><p>---</p><p>“You <i>spied</i> on me?!”</p><p>“Of course I spied on you, you great prat! You were obviously up to something!”</p><p>“I didn’t have a choice!”</p><p>“I <i>know</i>.” Harry said placatingly. “I didn’t understand it then, but I do now.”</p><p>Malfoy’s anger seemed to deflate at that. “Why didn’t you tell Dumbledore? Why didn’t you <i>stop</i> me?”</p><p>“I wanted to, but I didn’t know exactly <i>what</i> you were trying to do,” Harry admitted. “I never could catch you at it, and I tried all year.” Maybe he was revealing too much, but Harry couldn’t stop himself. In for a knut, in for a galleon, he supposed. “Bloody obsessed, I was.”</p><p>Malfoy seemed pleased by that admission, if the small smile on his face was any indication. “Obsessed?”</p><p>“Don’t get too full of yourself.” Harry rolled his eyes.  “Back then, it was a pretty unhealthy obsession.”</p><p>“<i>Back then?</i>”</p><p>“Erm...” Harry floundered.</p><p>Malfoy’s smile was rather predatory. “This conversation isn’t over.”</p></div>
