    <p>Harry Potter sat in his bed, his only company being the soft snores of the Dursley's as they slept. The storm outside raged on, as did the one in his head; he fingered the razor, all thoughts of common sense leaving his mind. </p><p>He laughed and cut once, twice, three times, until the steady flow of blood was threatening to increase. It wasn't enough, though. He needed more. More pain, more blood. he wanted to feel something. Anything. The war had left him broken; an empty shell of what he once was. </p><p>He couldn't see the blood, but he could feel the life force draining out of him. He had to stop. He wasn't ready for death; not yet. It was becoming a routine. Wake up, skip breakfast, skip lunch, skip dinner, go to bed, cut until he's on the verge of death, go to sleep, and wake up again. </p><p>He knew that what he was doing was wrong; but he couldn't seem to stop. He didn't want to stop. it was a self inflicted punishment, he was the judge, jury, and executioner. </p><p>He passed out, dried blood coating his arm as a painful reminder of what he really is. </p><p>Miles away, a certain blond-haired boy was doing the same thing.</p>
