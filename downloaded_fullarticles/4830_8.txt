    <p><em>Mister Remus J Lupin,</em><br/>
<em> With great excitement, I’d like to offer you the summer research fellow position at the Fiesole Archaeological Site under my guidance. I look forward to working with you and helping you move forward on your research into Etruscan life and architecture. You will have full access to the site, as well as full access to our databases and everything the city of Florence has to offer. My goal for you this summer is to compile and accurate reconstruction of the Etruscan temple on the site.</em></p><p>
  <em>Room and board will be provided, the only expenses you must provide are any excursions you are interested in during your downtime. You will have plenty of guides at your fingertips to show you around the city, or wherever you are interested. I hope you are as excited as I am for you to join us here in Fiesole.</em>
</p><p><em>Enjoy the rest of your semester,</em><br/>
<em>Monty Potter</em></p><p align="center">***</p><p>Remus made his way through the Amerigo Vespucci Airport in Florence. It wasn’t a large bustling airport like Charle De Gaulle, where he had made his connection, but it was still a busy little place. When he stepped out into the sun-soaked early afternoon, a grin fell upon his face. He had finally made it.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he found a sign with his last name on it and approached the person. Monty had made arrangements for him to be picked up from the airport by someone from his villa.</p><p>“‘Ello, Mister Lupin!” A kid, no more than 16 greeted him, waving the sign from where he stood in front of an old black Cadillac. This wasn't exactly what he was expecting with someone like Fleamont Potter. He thought he’d be greeted by some proper chauffeur, not a teen who probably just received his permit. The small knot of anxiety in his chest grew a bit bigger.</p><p>“Hi,” Remus smiled politely as the black haired teen dropped the sign into an open window of the car and made his way for the boot.</p><p>“I’m Regulus. I’m here to drive you up to the Potter Villa. I know, I look like I’m 14. I’m 16, and the best driver on the Potter land. You don’t want my brother to get you. James, Effie, and Monty are both busy with something or another at the moment.” Regulus grabbed Remus’ large luggage, and with a little grunting and struggling, got it into the boot of the car.</p><p>“Right, when am I going to meet Monty?” Remus asked, furrowing his brow as Regulus regarded his work with a little smile.</p><p>“Not till dinner, I’d say. He didn’t want you to jump right in the first day. You have to settle in and all that rot.” Regulus said as he stuffed Remus’s carry-on in the boot. “Fleur can make so lunch for us if we're interested. That's always a treat. You can also get a lay of the land of the villa before you have to do any work. I promised to clean up the garden, but I bet Sirius could give you a tour.”</p><p>“Sirius…” Remus asked as he followed Regulus’ lead and got into the car.</p><p>“My brother. He’s best mates with James — Monty’s son. I got lucky enough to tag along with them the last two summers. You’ll like Sirius, everyone always does.” Regulus sounded a bit exasperated at that. Remus wasn’t ready to dig into the brother’s relationship, he had just met them. He also wasn’t there to study them. He was there for the Etruscans.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Regulus drove them through the city of Florence, then up the winding Tuscan hills towards the Potter villa. He prattled on about what was great about the area. Remus was only half listening as he took in the gorgeous greenery around him and the growing distant views of the city of Florence with its terracotta roofs tops and sun-washed creamy colors.</p><p>Remus had little expectations about his fellowship with Monty Potter. He had applied on a whim when he saw the advert in some pamphlet at Cambridge, where he was studying for his Masters in Ancient and Classical Architecture with a focus on the Etruscans. He only cared that he’d get to work around so much of the history he only really knew of in theory or photographs. To be able to be up close and examine the world was going to be amazing. Living in some villa not far from the site and the city of Florence was only a plus.</p><p>He was starting to get a little bit worried about sharing space with so many people. So far there was Effie and Fleamont, both of whom he expected. Then there was their son James, which was no big deal. But Regulus and Sirius were a surprise and apparently James’ girlfriend Lily would be making an appearance at some point for a large chunk of the summer. On top of that was Fleur, who was apparently the live-in chef. Plus there were also Dorcas and Marlene, who were studying at Florence University of the Arts for the summer — their parents were friends with the Potters and a year ahead of James and Sirius at the boarding school they had attended. That was a lot of bloody people in one place.</p><p>But Remus’ fears of claustrophobia were quelled quickly when Regulus pulled into the long private drive of the Potter’s villa. In front of him stretched rows of lemon and orange trees on both sides of the drive. When they reached the end of the drive, they were in front of the villa, likely the size of his dormitory back in England but laid out in the typical Tuscan villa. It was a burnt orange villa with brown shudders lining the open windows, varying in size. There was a veranda off to the right side, and on the left, there were roses climbing up the side of the house.</p><p>Regulus led him on a basic tour of the interior of the house. Remus could spend his time just looking at the architecture of the villa itself. As they rounded the corner to take the stairs, Remus collided with another body. “Bloody hell, I’m so sorry,” Remus said, catching himself on the wall behind him.</p><p>The man he collided with laughed before he stood up straight. This was obviously Regulus’ brother. He was a foot taller, and his black hair wasn’t cut short like his brothers. It was piled in a bun on top of his head. His eyes were a piercing blue, where Regulus’ was a murky brown. He was so attractive that it was a bit ridiculous. “It’s fine, mate.” Sirius stuck his hand out. “I’m Sirius Black, welcome to the Potter’s.”</p><p>“Ah, thanks.” Remus shook his hand. “I’m Remus Lupin, the summer research fellow.”</p><p>“You’re going to love it here. No one ever wants to leave it at the end. I’m fairly certain that someone stayed in Florence, he probably busks for money now in the Piazza. That bloke was completely insufferable, though.”</p><p>“Just looking I can see why someone might want to stay,” Remus said with a grin, not sure how to answer Sirius’ little story. “I can’t wait to see everything.”</p><p>“If you ever need a guide, I can help you. I’ve been coming here since I was 12.”</p><p>“He’s only just 18, don’t let them impress you.” Regulus played with the handle of Remus’ suitcase.</p><p>“That’s still six years,” Remus reasoned but at the same time mentally kicking himself for finding Sirius so attractive. He wasn’t even in Uni yet. There was a five year age difference between the two of them, Remus felt rather gross for a moment.</p><p>“See, Reg, he agrees. It’s only your second summer.”</p><p>“Well, if he drives you, good luck. You might not survive to see the end of the summer.” Regulus shrugged. “Now, Brother, if you’re done interrupting, I need to get Remus to his room.”</p><p>Sirius gave a little tilt of his head and a grin before taking off passed Regulus and Remus.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>
  <em>Hi Mum &amp; Dad,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Just wanted to let you know I made it to Florence. You’d love it here. I’ll take lots of pictures and pick up some post cards. I think this is going to be a very good summer. I can’t wait to see the site and get started on my work, though. I’ll update you later.</em>
</p><p><em>Love,</em><br/>
<em>Remus</em></p><p align="center">***</p><p><em>Gid,</em><br/>
<em> So, Florence is bloody brilliant. Not that I’ve seen much, but I could just sit and look at my surroundings all day. The villa I’m at is fucking awesome and huge. Also, there’s a bloke here who is bloody gorgeous, but he’s only 18. Kill me, why don’t you? I’m a horrible person.</em></p><p><em>Fuck me,</em><br/>
<em>Remus</em></p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p>Remus unpacked then took a nap. When he woke up, it was about dinner time, so he wandered down to the main level of the house. As he crossed into the living room, a streak of pink hair flashed by him then followed Regulus, “Nym! Careful!”</p><p>“Nym?”</p><p>“She’s my cousin’s kid. They’re visiting. They have a place in the city though, so they’re not staying here. But yeah, more people.” Regulus laughed. “The Potters love people. They seem to collect them, or something.” Regulus said. “Sirius, James, and Dorcas are out back in the garden chatting and having a drink if you want to join them. Effie, Monty, and Nym’s parents are in the sitting room.”</p><p>Remus hesitated a moment about where to go, but before he could decide, his mind was made up for him when Monty came out from one of the many doorways wearing a large smile. He was tall, with dark tanned skin. His hair was black and a bit messy as if he had been working hard all day. When Remus shook his hand, he could feel calluses from years of work.</p><p>“It’s so nice to meet you in person, Remus. We’re glad to have you here finally. How was the flight?”</p><p>“Fine,” Remus said after taking a deep breath. Meeting so many new people was making him horribly anxious. It was okay when it was just Regulus at first. Then meeting Sirius was an accident. But now the house was full of people Remus didn’t know and had to meet. What did he get himself in to? He should have taken something that let him hide away from so many people.</p><p>“Wonderful, let me introduce you to everyone we have milling about. I'm so sorry if it’s overwhelming. I hear you met Sirius already, so he and Regulus take two people off the list.”</p><p>Monty brought Remus around the house to meet Effie (short, sweet, and rather funny), Andi (Nym’s mum, tall, blonde, a bit scary), Ted (warm, Andi’s husband, a bit of an every man), Fleur (Part French, Part Italian, a whole lot of fire), Dorcas (kind, a bit of a hipster), Marlene (she was bloody beautiful, flirtatious especially with Sirius, and smart), James (nearly the carbon of his father but just a tad less charismatic). Remus ended up in the back garden with Dorcas, Sirius, and James for a drink after the whirlwind of introductions.</p><p>“I’ve only been here for a week, and I love it. I have to start classes on this coming Monday, but I’m not sad about it.” Dorcas smiled softly. “I’m sure I’m going to soak up so much knowledge from this place. I feel like I already have.”</p><p>“You can’t gain knowledge through osmosis, Dori.” Sirius rolled his eyes.</p><p>“She’s gaining some sort of wisdom from being in such an old city, even if it’s not the qualitative knowledge you’re used to. Sirius wants to be a doctor. It’s scary, him saving lives. You’d think that too if you knew him.”</p><p>“It’s not scary…”</p><p>Sirius, Dorcas, and James continued to talk to Remus but Remus never actually joined in the conversation. He was feeling tired, worn out, and anxious. None of those lead to him being a great conversationalist. It carried on that way into dinner, which was the best food he had ever had in his life. Everyone was so nice but he barely said a word. They were all filling in the sentences for him. The Potters &amp; Co. were so nice that it was hard for him to feel annoyed that all they were doing was talking at him and around him. They were clearly trying to make him feel at home.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>That night Remus found himself out in the garden under the moonlight. He was restless when he tried to sleep so he thought some fresh air might do him well to settle. Remus always had a hard time sleeping in brand new places, even when he was as exhausted as he felt. The cat nap he took early didn’t do much to completely recharge him.</p><p>“Thinking about running away? We are an overwhelming bunch of people.”</p><p>Remus jumped at Sirius’ voice behind him as he was examining the orange tree. “Bloody hell.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Sirius chuckled, coming to stand next to him, brushing his shoulder against Remus. “So, are you all ready to run away?”</p><p>“I wasn’t planning on it,” Remus said flatly.</p><p>“You hardly said ‘boo’ tonight.”</p><p>“I hardly had a chance.”</p><p>“True.” Sirius looked up to the night sky. “You should talk more.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I think you probably have a lot to say.”</p><p>“You do? You’ve just met me.”</p><p>“You’re smart, right? Monty wouldn’t have brought you here otherwise. Most smart people have a lot to say, even if they don’t want to. I mean, we’ve met people who came out here who wouldn’t bloody shut up about what they knew. I think you could find a balance of saying too much and saying too little.”</p><p>“Maybe you all just have more to say than me.”</p><p>“That’s doubtful,” Sirius said. There was a long pause before Sirius spoke again, “Tell me, Remus, Remus Lupin, do you like your name?”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“It’s an odd name. So isn’t Sirius, so I’m not judging. I’m just curious.”</p><p>“I like my name.”</p><p>“Good. I like mine too. I’m sure you have the piss taken all the time because you’re studying Romans and your name is Remus.”</p><p>“I’m studying the Etruscans, and it still happens, yeah.”</p><p>“Sorry. At least I don’t have to be a dog breeder or something. My name would be too on point for that.” Sirius sat down in the lush, green grass. “You don’t seem to mind though.”</p><p>“It’s annoying but, I’m over it since it happens all the time.”</p><p>Sirius just nodded. “You can sit next to me.”</p><p>“I think I’m going to go to sleep. It’s been a long day.”</p><p>“Okay.” Sirius said with a little frown on his pouty lips. “Goodnight.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>That night Remus dreamed of orange groves, green grass, and Sirius’ lips. He was in trouble.</p>
