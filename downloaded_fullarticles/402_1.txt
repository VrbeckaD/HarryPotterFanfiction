    <p>          When I opened  my eyes all I saw was white..and lots of mist . Not mentioning being as naked as a baby. </p><p>      As soon as that thought  finished  I was dressed in a tshirt and jeans. </p><p>And as I started to walk  the white walls formed into the king's cross station. </p><p>And as I walked  forward I heard a weak raspy wailing.  I walked over to a baby looking thing covered in blood and dirt in a fetal position.</p><p>Making it look disfigured and inhuman. </p><p> My mothering instincts kicked in and I picked it up and brought it to my chest  soothingly as I rubbed its back and rocked back and forth.</p><p>Then a basin full of water along with a onesie and a cloth appeared in front of me. I carefully placed the baby in the basin and washed him gently with the cloth.</p><p> Soon enough I rinsed him off with a towel that was provided. I then put the onesie that said 'I'm a mommas boy' on him and buttoned  it at the bottom. </p><p>The little  baby opened  his eyes and they were just like mine with a hint of grey. When he closed  the. and sucked on his hand that he was using as a pacifier. </p><p>His face however  was all Riddle's , as I mused on what to do a ring appeared a on my right hand. </p><p>It was the resurrection stone! But that was impossible I thought  Dumbledore destroyed it.</p><p>My invisibility cloak flew through the air and landed on my shoulders like a cloak. And following it was the wand I have seen in Voldemort and Dumbledore's  hands.</p><p>It was floating in the air Vibrating,  calling and waiting for me to take it.</p><p>When I cautiously  wrapped  my fingers around it I was thrown into darkness. </p><p>With millions and millions of stars that were never ending, with different shades or brightness. </p><p>When I realised that I was looking at my soul and all the others that were connected to mine. Some were brothers or sisters while most were my mates.</p><p>I was snapped  out of my meditative state by Tommy pulling on my hair  with a gummy smile. </p><p>I looked up and saw two doors standing in front of me and I knew I had to make a choice. </p><p>I could  choose the one on the right and return to the end of the war and the devastation it wrought. </p><p>As well as the expectations and limelight of the people that has been slowly suffocating me my whole life.</p><p>Or go somewhere  new where I could simply  be myself! Never having to worry about the daily  prophet or people judging me thinking they have a right to know my business. </p><p>So to me it wasn't really a choice  , I reached out to the door on the left marked with the deadly Hallows. </p><p>As soon as my hand touched the door I was sucked into darkness. </p><p>###</p><p>Voldemort pov</p><p>
  <em>Finally </em>
</p><p>I thought  as I announced  the death  of Harry Potter. </p><p>Wringing wails of sorrow and cheering/jeering from my followers. </p><p>No longer  would the boy thwart me at every turn!</p><p>My burning  for him will finally subside,  and as I opened  my mouth to gloat over my victory I felt the absolute burning agony of my soul merging with another.  I fell to my knees screaming and holding my chest.</p><p>And I realized it was one of my horcruxes!</p><p>My followers  panicked, some fled while others rushed to my side  asking for orders or trying to figure out what spell I was hit with.</p><p>As I was awash in memories that were bringing back my sanity and emotions. </p><p>It happened  again and again the pain of my souls merging,  when I heard screaming from the background. </p><p>My followers  were being  set upon by the light wizards. Especially  the boys friends and allies the Longbottem boy, the weasley, the muggle born , and his adoptive sister Khalida were showing no mercy.</p><p>And as I looked out the corner of my eye I saw Harry's prone form ..and felt such <em>Agony </em> that I wailed in sorrow and rage ..at myself and my own actions. </p><p>I crawled to him ignoring my agony as I put my forehead  to my mates. Screams being  ripped from my throat as if I was being  cursed by the <b>Cruciatus.</b></p><p>The last thing I saw was the life less face of Harry Potter  my<em> Omega . </em></p><p>
  <em>####</em>
</p><p>Harry pov</p><p>I awoke to a shining sun and singing birds ,blinking and squinting as I adjusted to the sunlight. I saw we were laying on a grassy patch of a garden.</p><p>It was wild and overgrown showing it has not been tended to in a while. Tommy snuffed in his sleep bringing  my attention to him lying on my chest.</p><p>When I looked  down  I saw not one child on my chest but two!</p><p>I lifted  the ratty blanket of the second child off of its face and saw my Godson  teddy sleeping peacefully next to Tommy.</p><p>Gently not to wake them I slipped out from underneath them. And they automatically  latched onto each other for warmth.</p><p>Smiling  I stood and looked at our surroundings.  And I realised that I was ...shorter . I shrugged  it off and continued on.</p><p>Seeing  a pond a few inches away i headed  over to explore  the garden we arrived in.</p><p>I looked  into the pool of cool water in passing  and gasped in shock.</p><p>I saw a round pale face that looked as if it had never seen sunlight. Which was Bull shit because  Petunia had me out caring for her garden since I was 4! I had a silver Diadem with a emerald in the middle and a silky dress  that showed my stomach that flowed at the sleeves. </p><p>With long silky yet wavy black hair  that framed  large green doe eyes that were a lot brighter than they were and surrounded by long lashes.</p><p> </p><p>They were glowing! And I look like I'm eleven years old!!</p><p>Not to mention my poty pink lips that made me look like a girl. </p><p>I started releasing distressed pheromones which made my lips whine in discomfort. </p><p>I forced  myself to relax and headed  back to my pups who went back to sleep after I released calming pheromones and hummed an old lullaby. </p><p>I then tried  to lift Tommy in one hand and teddy in the other  I quickly  put them both down as it was impossible. </p><p>I was to weak to lift them both frustrated I looked around  to see if there was anything  else I could use to carry them and saw a silk blanket that looked strong. </p><p>I beat it to get out the gathering dust it was covered in making  me sneeze.  And tied it around  me to make a carrier that they would  fit in.</p><p>I tightened it  and went to my pups  and put each in the sling. They wiggled for a second before settling down.</p><p>And I went to a bush close by that had blueberry that were ripe I picked  all that I could carry in a small blanket that was wrapped  around Teddy. I also found some strawberries. </p><p>Then I walked  to the end of the garden  that had an arch way that was very extravagant but has faded  with time.</p><p>I unlocked it and pushed  it open  and was met with a hallway  with lots of stairs.  I huffed  "great this is just great."</p><p>And started  walking I prayed  to mother magic  that it wasn't  to long to the bottom  because it would  be to dangerous to apparate and I didn't  want to risk flying. </p><p>I was only walking  for about  ten minutes  when I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. </p><p>I quickened  my pace and exited  the hallway but was now In a grand bedroom  that belongs to a king.</p><p>But it was dusty and unused so I continued  to walk out of the room and into the hallway.  And I heard  bells and chanting  as well as smelling candles .</p><p>I stopped  for a second  wondering  if I was in a temple but I didn't  remember seeing  any statue or paintings. </p><p>I grabbed  my courage  and stepped out, In to the light next to a golden  statue that the people in front of me were praying to. </p><p>Everyone  froze for a second  and stared at me In awe ,and in shock. Until  the man who was probably the head priest bowed down to me.</p><p>And shouted</p><p>" All hail her majesty Helena the new queen of The dark continent!" And everyone  else  in the courtyard  bowed down as well as I stood there mouth gaping. </p><p>I then stared at the statue  that looked  <em>exactly like me</em> down to the diadem  and two pups I was carrying. </p><p>Welp there is the statue  I was looking  for...might as well run with it . I thought  and shrugged  as it felt like that's what I should do. </p><p>I then commanded  the Priest  closest to me to rise as well as the others and told them to continue with their duties. </p><p>I then turned  to the head priest and smiled " it is good to be home but may I speak to the current leaders of my kingdom so I may be updated on my kingdom as well as some essentials for my pups?"</p><p>  He nodded and brought  me to a room that looked  like a cross of a office and lounge. </p><p>He turned to leave when I stopped him " may I have your name to remember  your kindness?"</p><p>He stuttered before straightening  " I am called  Goda your majesty."</p><p> </p><p>I nodded gave him permission to leave and then turned  to Teddy who was waking  up.</p><p>I took them both out of the sling and laid them on the couch.  Teddy opened  his golden  eyes lazily and called out " Ma ma?" </p><p>"I'm here teddy." I cooed  as I lifted  him to my arms he cuddled  into my neck before saying "hungry har."</p><p>I smiled and took some of the blueberries  from my pouch and popped  it in his mouth  he gummed on them humming  happily and bouncing.</p><p>  I placed him on the soft rug and moved to sit next to him so I could  continue to feed him when the door opened. </p><p>Five men came in two with red eyes and wild red hair and the other two men were dark skinned with white hair . And lastly the head priest. </p><p>All were alphas, and their scents made my Omega  purr in happiness. </p><p>I shook myself out of it when Goda introduced me .</p><p>" your majesty this is Muu Alexius chief of the Fanalis and this is his Second  Lo'Lo , The King of the Heliohapts is Armakan and his younger brother  prince Sharrkan, my lords this is the new queen. Helena." </p><p>And we immediately  bonded  with each other after making  eye contact. </p><p>I fed teddy  another  blueberry  before  standing  to greet them .</p><p>" It is nice to meet you all, though  I ask you to pardon  my bluntness but I am not here  to dethrone any of you or steal your positions,  but I would like you to cut the pleasantries and have you tell me everything I need to know about  this land and its people and its country . Also i would like to walk among  the people  myself  and speak to them yours included  if you find that agreeable? And we can deal with the mateship issues along the way."</p><p>I finished  with a raised  eyebrow.</p><p>Lo'lo bust out laughing  " and here we thought  we would have to deal with a spoilt brat ! I like you girl you got spirit!"</p><p>Muu looked  at Lo'lo in warning  while Armakan  and his brother  watched in amusement  on the couch  across  from the one Tommy was on.</p><p>When Teddy crawled  over to Sharrkan and tugged on his robes to stand and demanded " bueberwy!" </p><p>I giggled  while Sharrkan  quickly  reached  for one and gave it to Teddy quickly  like he was a wild animal clearly  not used to dealing  with children. </p><p>After Teddy got his blueberry  he turned into a Copy of Sharrkan  while smiling  happily. </p><p>Everyone  stared  at Teddt in shock  when Muu aske me in a curious  voice  " does your pup already  have a devil fruit power?" </p><p>I shook my head " no it's a gift that's passed down on his family  line. What is a devil fruit ?"  I asked </p><p>Armakan sighed " this Is going  to take a while ".</p><p>#####</p><p>I found out this world is full of pirates, and revolutionaries that were in an internal battle with the government and celestial  dragons.  </p><p>As well as the government  trying  to force my kingdom into joining  them , and that they have been struggling with keeping our  Neutrality .</p><p>I told them straight  faced that we would never support  a government  that supports slavery  which made Muu and Lo'lo look at me in a new light.</p><p>I also ended  up telling  them of my magic,  which amazed them especially Armakan who had question after question.</p><p>Tommy woke up not long after teddy and Goda offered  to give them to nurse maids  which made me growl at him at the thought of giving  up my babies. </p><p>So they were crawling  over everyone's  laps  as we continued  to talk about  country  issues. </p><p>Not mentioning  me laying  in Muu's as I breathed in his scent of lightning and water.</p><p>The first thing I brought  up was offering to put up wards to add to our defenses. I also mentioned that we would start accepting refugees and slaves to help boost the population.</p><p>I also learned  that an allied island  of ours was plagued  by a mysterious disease.  And were quarantined  to the island. And immigrants were shot out of fear of passing on the disease. </p><p>When I asked some questions  I figured  out exactly  what they had . And told them that it was curable  and that the Government  probably  knew of the white Lead being  poisonous but ignored it.</p><p>As we were making plans to go and rescue  the people on the island  a priestess  burst in heaving.</p><p>" Apolgies for bursting  in your majesty  but some men and women  have appeared in your garden claiming to be your mates or siblings!"</p><p>I grabbed  Teddy and Tommy  and put them in their  sling and snapped " take me to them now!"</p><p>And I was led back to the courtyard  with my new mates following  behind  me in confusion. </p><p>The first faces I saw when we arrived  in the courtyard  were Hermione ,Ron,George, Luna,Khalida, and Neville. </p><p>They all called out my name when they say me and ran to hug me when they were stopped  by the guards.</p><p>" let them through they are family!" I called  out and was immediately  wrapped  up in a sobbing  Hermione and luna .</p><p>" W-we thought you were dead Harry! When we were  suddenly in the garden..harry where are we?"</p><p>Hermione asked tearfully  letting  me go to breathe  once she heard the pups squeak at being hugged by so strongly by aunt Hermione. </p><p>" Let's go inside and I'll explain  everything  ." I explained  looking at everyone in the group  when I met yellow eyes that i haven't  seen since I was a kid.</p><p>I took Teddy and Tommy and handed  them to Khalida  who physically looks the oldest out of us.</p><p>And I went up to the red haired  man  and Said " Hisoka  is that you?"</p><p>And reached  out to him he grabbed  my hand and put it against  his cheek  while pulling  me in close  and licking  his lips.</p><p>"  It Has been so long hasn't  it little  lamb, you still smell exactly the same".  And he breathed  in my scent before  he pulled  away  and said harshly "what is it Illumi ?" </p><p>" Stop hogging  our mate people  are staring, especially  those with the red eyes". We turned </p><p>And saw Muu and Lo'lo glaring  at Hisoka as well as a 25 year old Tom riddle  doing  the same next to them.</p><p>My eyes dilated  and I bonded  with him as well.</p><p>When I looked away I saw a flash of silver and made eye contact  with silver eyes and a stern pale face.</p><p>And bonded  again, I took hisoka's hand and had everyone  follow me back into the lounge  ..because  this was going  to be a long talk.</p><p>#####</p><p>Turns out all of the people my soul touched in the world before followed me to this one. As well as my mates from other worlds.</p><p>Such as Levi ,Erwin,Hisoka, Illumi ,Fred,Marvolo, and Zuko.</p><p>And all of us were younger than we were in our original  worlds . And all of them felt it when I died.</p><p>Hisoka,Khalida, And Levi looked crazed at simply  remembering  the feeling  while my other mated simply  looked  devastated recalling it.</p><p>And by the time everyone  was updated  to the new world and what was going  on it was time for lunch.</p><p>The two pups were put in high chairs with luna and Neville  volunteering to feed them . While  everyone  else found a seat and started  to eat .</p><p>Erwin spoke up " I think it would benefit  everyone if they were assigned  to a post or given a issue to take care of so we aren't  unorganized. "</p><p>Most of us nodded  in agreement  and I thought  for a moment  before speaking.  " Erwin ,Levi you have experience dealing  with military  matters  so I believe  you should  focus on building up our military and fixing  current  soldiers training  to better  our attacking  force Sharrkan and Lo'lo will assist you."</p><p>" Fred , Ron you will deal with our resources,trade dealings, agriculture, and treasury and will be assisted by Amarkan if needed. "</p><p>" Khalida  I need you to deal with the white lead issue and handle the refugee situation  And if you need any assistance Hisoka will assist".</p><p>"Luna, Neville I would like you to draw up a list of Pirates that could be potential allies  as well as care for my pups when I am not able ".</p><p>"Marvolo, and Hermione  I would like you to handle  the government officials  on my behalf  , while I am looking over this kingdoms current  policies, cultures and laws."</p><p>"Illumi I would like you to meet with any revolutionaries or Government officials who could  be our allies  but know that I will wish to know their dealings and agendas before I make any decisions like with everyone else."</p><p>" does anyone  object  on their given jobs?"</p><p>Everyone  shook their heads  and we went back to eating  and regular  conversation.</p><p>  I learned  that the Fanalis were always  targeted  by slavers and I spoke with Illumi and Hisoka  about  them dealing  with any slavers that posed a threat.</p><p>Before Marvolo  got my attention  and I realized  that he was staring  at Tommy.  " Helena...is that pup mine ?" </p><p>I nodded  after  hesitating and  he paled swallowed and whispered "how is that possible?" </p><p>By now all of my mates were listening  in and I told them the truth.  That when I died I chose  to have the horcrux  reborn as my pup than killing  it.</p><p>Most of my mates looked relieved that he hadn't  gotten  me pregnant  at 10 while others were curious  as to what a Horcrux was.</p><p>I told them what it was and some were horrified  while others were curious or indifferent to it in general. </p><p>That night we were led to a new repaired castle  that I was in that morning. </p><p>I sat on a bench while everyone  prepared  for bed and made Zuko sit while I uncorked  some Dittany and other potions.</p><p>" I'm not sure if this will work but it should..do you still want me to try?" I asked and he took a deep breath before  nodding.</p><p>I got a warm rag and wiped at his scar while I put Dittany with another  healing potion on it.</p><p>Slowly very slowly  it started  to hear his skin. I smiled  and continued to re apply  and wipe when needed  until his scar was gone. </p><p>I led him to the bathroom  mirror  and said "open your eyes!"  Zuko gasped and stared at his now perfect skin where the scar used to be.</p><p>He poked and prodded like it was going to change  before  scooping  me up in his arms and laughing and thanking  me over and over.</p><p>"That's some good stuff  kid , make sure to Remind your friend to supply us with those."</p><p>I nodded  before  asking  him " Lo'lo do you want to see if it will work on your scar?" I asked. </p><p>He shook his head with a laugh " nah , I like it where it is makes it easier to scare people!" </p><p>I giggled and put the vial in a trash can before  heading  back to out bedroom. </p><p>The bedroom  that I had seen that  was once dusty  shined and gleamed with polish. And has new furniture  and sheets that gleamed with silk and gold.</p><p>There was a nursery  right next to our room that held two bassinets.  I put my pups  in one and kissed them goodnight  before  joining  my mates in my bedroom. </p><p>Hisoka  and Voldemort  were glaring  daggers at each other when i entered  probably  fighting  over who would mark me first.</p><p>I sighed " Children , no fighting  ok ? It doesn't  matter who Mark's me first so knock it off!"</p><p>Marvolo  frowned  while hisoka  smiled his dangerous  smile.</p><p>I sat on in the middle  of the bed as my mates circled  around  to pick a spot for their  marks.</p><p>Illumi  surprisingly bit me first on my ankle biting so deep I was afraid he would tear through my tendons.</p><p>It made me jerk in surprise  before the hormones he injected into my bloodstream made me relax . And I tasted  Nightshade on my tongue.</p><p>Then Hisoka bit me on my upper thigh ,making  me moan as the bond snapped  into place filling  me with warmth as I breathed in his scent of blood and sweets.</p><p>Levi bit me on one side of my collar bone and Erwin took the other .The rush of hormones almost making me pass out.</p><p>Fred bit me on my wrist while Amarkan bit me on the other . And I was on overload once again  with the hormones I'm pretty sure I was shivering  by then.</p><p>Sharrkan flipped  me over and bit me on my lower  back right above my arse. And I glared  at him for picking  such a spot but he simply  winked at me.</p><p>At this point  I was fighting  to stay awake after getting  so many mating marks.</p><p>Lo'lo growled and pulled  me to his chest and bit me on my neck very close to my scent  glands which  made me groan ,due to the sensitivity. </p><p>Muu bit me on the other side of my neck matching Lo'Lo's mark. And I rubbed  my face into their necks to get more of the woodsy scent they shared. </p><p>Zuko hesitated  before  biting  me on my left shoulder and licking  the blood from the bite like the others did his  warm breath making me shiver. As fire ran through my veins. </p><p>The last thing I remember is Marvolo biting me on my shoulder before falling asleep  in his arms.</p><p>I hope tomorrow  will be less exciting. </p><p> </p>
