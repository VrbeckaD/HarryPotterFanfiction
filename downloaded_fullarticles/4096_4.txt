    <p>Hermione is on her way to the library, arms crowded with several thick books. She is on her own - it is only the start of the year, and Ron and Harry have no intention of starting studying so early.</p><p>Just as she is about to round the corner, she hears a startled shriek from up ahead, followed a second later by raucous laughter. Curious, she peers around the corner, just in time to see a hufflepuff girl grabbing at her skirt, which is lifting up to show her panties. A group of slytherin boys are lounging against the wall, laughing and jeering as the girl runs down the corridor, still trying desperately to hold down her skirt. One of the boys follows her progress with his wand and it is obvious what is going on. Hermione has heard the other girls whispering about this new craze amongst the boys to magically lift up girls skirts to see their underwear.</p><p>She draws quickly out of sight and presses her back against the wall, flushing slightly in secondhand embarrassment for the girl. She is about to leave in the opposite direction, meaning to find the nearest teacher and tell them what's going on. But then, she has a thought.</p><p>She glances back at the corner, thinking of the group of them around there. They've cleared staked out this corridor because it's quiet, so that no teachers will see them. She doesn't recognise any of them, which means they probably wouldn't recognise her... She closes her eyes and imagines what it would feel like, to have all those boys seeing her underwear, the embarrassment... just the thought makes her tingle down there.</p><p>Her teenage hormones took over, overcoming her hesitations. She was about to walk around the corner, when another idea occurred to her. This new thought was so bold and daring that it almost caused her to lose her nerve completely. But at the same time, the thought causes an undeniable wetness between her legs...</p><p>A quick glance around reassures her that there is no one in sight. Feeling naughty and adult, she crouches down to set her books on the floor, and then quickly pulls down her panties and steps out of them. Holding the white cotton panties in her hand, she cannot believe that she is really doing this. She tries to imagine what her friends would think, and say, if they knew what she was doing, but somehow the thought of their shock and judgement only turns her on more.</p><p>She screws the panties up into a ball so that they're hidden within her first and picks up her books again, holding them tight to her chest. The knee length skirt doesn't let anything show of course, but still just the knowledge that she is naked beneath it makes her hornier than she has ever been. She takes a deep breath, trying to control her racing heart, and then walks around the corridor. She does not notice Snape, who had rounded the corner behind her just in time to see her pulling down her panties.</p><p>The boys fall silent as she comes into sight, but at first don't make any move to molest her. She bites her lip, the anticipation beginning to mingle with fear: what if she's not pretty enough for them to want her? </p><p>Then one of them, a handsome black haired boy with a cruel smirk on his face, twitches his wand slightly, lips quietly mouthing something. There is a slight breeze and a tantalising coolness brushes against her most sensitive places and she feels the edges of her skirt flutter up towards her chest. The shock of it actually happening causes her to gasp and freeze. There is a moment of stunned silence before the boys erupt with delighted shouts, realising that she is not wearing any underwear. </p><p>Hermione's heart feels ready to burst in her chest and her cheeks are burning. Suddenly the humiliation is too much and she turns on her heel to run, providing them with a clear view of her plump, cream-coloured ass, which jiggles slightly as she runs. </p><p>Her eyes are lowered, and blurred with tears of humiliation, and so she doesn't notice Snape until she all but runs into him. She comes to a stop, feeling her stomach drop sickeningly as she realises that the greasy haired professor has undoubtedly seen her pussy. The boys behind her fall silent, and without turning to look she knows they have run away. She can hardly bring herself to raise her eyes, but when she does she sees Snape is watching her with a blank, emotionless face. </p><p>No longer held aloft by the slytherin boys magic, her skirt drops back down to hide her shame, though this does little to make her feel better. A slight sneer tugs at Snape's thin lips as he looks down on her. "Come with me, Granger." He commands.</p><p>He turns and stalks away, and Hermione has little choice but to follow, crumpled underwear still clutched in her fist and cheeks still burning.</p>
