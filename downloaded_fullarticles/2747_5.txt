<p align="justify">Will put his foot down on the breaks at finding a boy walking around in the streets completely and utterly alone.</p>
<p align="justify">“Hello.” Will put the four signal lights on and left the car. “Are you hurt? Lost?”</p>
<p align="justify">“I... I was with my cousin playing catch and a second later I’m here...”</p>
<p align="justify">Will frowned and looked at the boy’s eyes. <em>Catch?</em></p>
<p align="justify">“Where does your relatives live?”</p>
<p align="justify">“4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.”</p>
<p align="justify">Will picked his phone and quickly looked up <em>Surrey</em>, only for him to frown.</p>
<p align="justify">“England?” The blind boy before him nodded. “You are in the United States.”</p>
<p align="justify">The boy’s mouth fell open.</p>
<p align="justify">“I’m definitely way over the usual block from my aunt’s house.”</p>
<p align="justify">“What’s your name?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Harry.”</p>
<p align="justify">Will hummed and guided the boy to his car.</p>
<p align="justify">Will gaped as he looked up the history of 4 Privet Drive to find that a Harry Potter existed in the ‘80s but had disappeared mysteriously. In the early ‘90s Harry Potter’s relatives had all died unexpectedly of heart attack at the exact same time three different people in the same house.</p>
<p align="justify">“Aunt’s name?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and Cousin Dudley Dursley.”</p>
<p align="justify">“And your name is...?” Will asked the boy at his side as he looked at the computer screens at the police station he worked at.</p>
<p align="justify">“Harry James Potter. Born 31 July 1980.”</p>
<p align="justify">Will massaged his temples. He didn’t need to have the boy do tests and exams to know that he was telling the truth. Harry was The Harry Potter.</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>Still... how would Will tell the boy that his family had been dead for a decade and that he had jumped two decades into the future? Not to mention: paperwork!</em>

</p>
<p align="justify">Will dropped out of the homicide’s division. <em>He couldn’t handle it any longer.</em> He drove to Wolf Trap to find Harry by the front door waving back.</p>
<p align="justify">Officializing Harry’s paperwork had been a pain but he had done it.</p>
<p align="justify">“How was your day?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Darkness learnt how to ask for bathroom break.” The boy put in proudly.</p>
<p align="justify">Will frowned. <em>Darkness?</em> They entered inside and Will found a dog at the corner who had obviously been a stray.</p>
<p align="justify">“You called the dog ‘Darkness’?”</p>
<p align="justify">Harry nodded proudly. Will snorted amused. The dog after a good bath would’ve be white.</p>
<p align="justify">“How was your day?” Harry asked back as Will approached the afraid dog in the corner where Harry had put two couch pillows and called it the dog’s corner.</p>
<p align="justify">“I finally left Homicide. I’ll have to go job hunting in the morning but besides that...”</p>
<p align="justify">“What about social services?” Harry wondered.</p>
<p align="justify">“Don’t worry.”</p>
<p align="justify">Harry frowned but nodded. Will wondered if he should tell Harry that his paperwork said that Harry was the biological son of William Graham. One of his former one-night-stands having died in an accident and Will had been contacted.</p>
<p align="justify">“We’ll find something.” He promised. “Now, first: bathing Darkness. Where did you found it?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Found ‘her’.” Harry argued at once, making Will chuckle and concede the point. “She was at the corner of the road that leads to school. When I returned, she was still there so I waited until she’d trust me to bring her home.”</p>
<p align="justify">Will picked up the oversized pup and took her outside. He left Harry with Darkness as he set up a wooden tub outside and then washed off the dog.</p>
<p align="justify">“I’ll pass tomorrow at the store and get some proper things for her to lay in. Toys and others.”</p>
<p align="justify">Will frowned at realizing Harry was mute. He looked up at the boy to find him biting his bottom lip.</p>
<p align="justify">“Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would’ve had my head if I had done this.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Your relatives were not right in the head. Next time send me a text so I can come prepared for another.”</p>
<p align="justify">If said thing was possible with the massive sideways-lightning scar that went from one temple down one eye diagonally, up the nose in a somewhat straight line and down the other eye diagonally until a little more than the corner of the eye: Harry opened his eyes ‘wide’ and gaped.</p>
<p align="justify">“Where were you all my life?”</p>
<p align="justify">Will laughed.</p>
<p align="justify">“I believe that around the time you played <em>catch</em> I was building boat motors with my Pops back in Louisiana. If you had stayed in the 80s we’d be roughly the same age, I’d be a couple years older.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Not me fault.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Not saying that it is. Even if it was, I’m glad you left them. It’s a wonder you survived this long without any help with the treatment they gave you.”</p>
<p align="justify">Harry blushed as he always did. Will didn’t comment it out. Harry was obviously neglected and treated like he was under a stray dog found in the streets. Which was ironic because that’s how Will had located him.</p>
