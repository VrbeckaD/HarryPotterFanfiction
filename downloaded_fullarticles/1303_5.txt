    <p>Sirius paced nervously along the platform, chewing his fingertips. He was the first of his friends to arrive, and he was relieved. In fact, he had been the first student to arrive altogether, following his father’s sneering dismissal that he couldn’t stand the sight of Sirius for another moment. Orion Black had apparated with him to the station, clutching Sirius’ arm so tightly he knew it would leave bruises. More bruises. His father had then taken advantage of the emptiness of the platform to give him a proper Orion Black goodbye, boxing his eldest son over the head while barking instructions.</p><p>“You <u>will </u>fall in line, you <u>will</u> stay away from Mudbloods and traitors. You will excel in class and you will <u>not</u> shame this family. If I hear anything back that displeases me, you know what will happen Boy, don’t you?”</p><p>Sirius stayed silent. Orion gave him such a punch in the face that he flew sideways, crinkled to the floor. “Answer me, Boy!”</p><p>“I will be punished,” said Sirius nasally, trying to stem the blood flowing from his nose.</p><p>“Good.” Orion scowled down at his son, who didn’t dare meet his eye. One final kick for good measure, and Orion disapparated.</p><p>Sirius sighed, then immediately coughed on a mouthful of blood. He was embarrassed, ashamed and angry, desperate for his friends not to see him like this. Even if he knew how to fix his nose, he couldn’t do magic outside of Hogwarts. </p><p>He opened his trunk, grabbed a robe and held it to his nose, which flared with pain when he touched it. He stood, shaking, trying to work out what to do, when he heard footsteps behind him.</p><p>“Sirius?” He cursed to himself. It was Lily, his classmate. Lily who hated him and James for the pranks they played on Snape, Lily who James had had a crush on since forever, Lily who might have just seen what his parents had done to him. Sirius turned slowly to face her, clutching the sodden robe to his face.</p><p>“Oh my god Sirius, are you alright? What happened?”</p><p>“Just a nosebleed,” he told her quickly, shrugging her off.</p><p>“Okay, it’s okay, my sister gets nosebleeds all the time. You have to lean forward – not backwards, that’s a myth - and pinch the bridge of your nose, preferably over a sink. Wait! Hold on.”</p><p>Lily rummaged in her trunk and extracted her small cauldron.</p><p>“Lean over this,” she offered. Sirius stared at her. Why was she being so nice to him?</p><p>“Why would you help me? I thought you hated us!” He asked before he could stop himself. Lily looked surprised.</p><p>“I don’t hate you, Sirius. I don’t exactly like Potter, he’s an arrogant git, and I don’t like what either of you do to Severus. But I don’t <u>hate</u> you. Hate’s such a strong word.” She looked intently at Sirius.</p><p>Sirius, embarrassed, suddenly noticed he was dripping blood onto the concourse and lurched forward over the cauldron. He thought his nose might be broken, but prayed Lily wouldn’t notice, as that could not be explained away so easily.</p><p>Behind them, the Hogwarts Express hooted loudly as it drew into the station. A few more students had arrived on the platform, regarding them curiously. Lily realised how odd they looked. Sirius was knelt down over the cauldron, hidden by his characteristic sheet of black hair and the bloody robe he still clutched in his hand, as though trying to hide behind it.</p><p>He kept his head down, burning with shame, and slight panic. It was a hard punch, what if the blood didn’t stop by itself?</p><p>Suddenly the train conductor appeared at their side in his gleaming red uniform, looking concerned.</p><p>“Hey, are you okay?” He asked.</p><p>“Nosebleed,” Lily told him, as Sirius only managed a grunt. “It’s been a long one, there’s lots of blood. I’d usually be able to fix it, but we can’t use magic outside of school.”</p><p>“Come on board,” said the conductor, “I can fix it and we’ll clean you up a bit.”</p><p>Slowly rising, Sirius clutched the robe more firmly to his nose, despite the blood trickling out between his fingers. He was thankful to be taken away from the eyes of his fellow students, who were used to seeing him so calm and collected, before his friends arrived.</p><p>On the train they stopped in the first compartment. Sirius sat quickly and Lily pushed the cauldron back towards him.</p><p>“Let me see,” said the conductor. Nervously, Sirius removed the cloak, trying to turn away from Lily as he did so.</p><p>The conductor whistled. “I think it’s broken. Badly, that’s why there’s so much blood. Hold on, I’ll take care of it. <em>Episkey.</em>”</p><p>Sirius yelped in pain as his nose snapped back into place. Another few spells from the conductor stopped the bleeding, and cleaned up the blood which covered Sirius’ face and hands. After cleaning the cauldron and cloak he pointed his wand out the window to remove the trail of blood from the concourse.</p><p>“What happened, Son?” He asked Sirius kindly. Sirius winced. How could this stranger be so much more paternal than his own father? Sirius caught Lily’s eyes. She looked surprised and concerned, which he hated desperately. He thought quickly.</p><p>“I fell... Outside the muggle station, in London. Hit my nose on the steps. It started to bleed as soon as I got through the barrier."</p><p>He realised as soon as he said it that it was a terrible excuse. His cheek was red and inflamed where it had been punched. Lily and the conductor looked disbelieving.</p><p>“Did your parents not come with you?” Asked Lily.</p><p>Sirius tried not to wince, remembering.</p><p>“No… they were busy. I took a muggle… taxi from their house.”</p><p>More lies, less believable. The infamous Black family would never dream of allowing their son to take Muggle transport rather than use magic. Lily looked downright concerned now, and Sirius berated himself internally. However, the conductor seemed content with this story, perhaps because he hadn’t recognised Sirius and made the connection, perhaps because he had noticed some students messing around on the platform out of the window.</p><p>“Excuse me, I’ve just got to deal with something. You stay here and rest.” He exited.</p><p>Lily looked at Sirius. “That was a lie wasn’t it?” Sirius stayed silent.</p><p>“Are you okay, Sirius? How did you get such a badly broken nose?” She asked him softly.</p><p>Sirius wanted to cry, feeling his eyes pricking. He blinked them away angrily. <em>No</em>, he would not let this be ruined, uncovered by Lily. What if his friends found out? He dug deep and found the words, expelling them with complete conviction, “actually Lily, I was mugged. My parents dropped me at the station early, but I went outside to… smoke a cigarette. I didn’t want to stay here on the platform in case anyone saw me. My friends don’t know I smoke. Four muggles started messing with me, wanting a cigarette, and then my wallet. When I refused, one of them punched me, but someone else saw and shouted and I managed to get away while they were distracted.”</p><p>Lily looked shocked. Sirius congratulated himself on the success of his lie – all the better because there were slight truths in it. He had begun smoking during the summer and he didn’t want his friends to know. Remus would lecture him, James would be angry with him. And his parents <em>had</em> dropped him off.</p><p>“Sirius, that’s so horrible! Are you okay?” Before he could reassure her, she wrapped him in a warm hug. He resisted his instinct to pull away from the touch and hugged her back, grateful that there was no chance of James seeing them.</p><p>“I’m alright, Lily, I was just a little shaken. My nose feels better now. Thank you, for looking after me. Please don’t tell the others what happened? I don’t want them to know I smoke.” He smiled his winning Sirius smile, despite his face still aching.</p><p>“Alright…” Lily agreed reluctantly. “Incidentally, I’m not impressed by your smoking, Sirius. My grandad smoked all his life and he has a horrible rough cough which hurts him a lot.”</p><p>Sirius let her lecture him, relieved, losing himself in her calm voice. Maybe it would be okay, this term. His friends weren’t going to find out anything. His lies were foolproof. They never need know about his family and he would just be normal Sirius, charming, funny Sirius.</p><p>His stomach suddenly rumbled loudly, jolting him back to reality. He hadn’t eaten much for the last week or so, since he had discovered that avoiding meals meant less opportunity for his parents to be angry with him, or hit him. He was hungry a lot at first, but had since discovered he liked the feeling of emptiness. It made him feel physically quicker and mentally sharper - and this gave him power, as though he could avoid their blows if he tried, dodging each fist and diving under the cutting words, escaping.</p><p>“Oh – er, are you hungry?” Lily asked, stopping her rant.</p><p>“No,” said Sirius firmly. <em>Yes</em>, his stomach said, roaring loudly.</p><p>“I’ve got a sandwich you can have,” Lily offered. “I ate before I came but my parents always send me off with spare food, they like to fuss.” She looked embarrassed, but pulled out a distinctly Muggle-looking sandwich.</p><p>“I’m fine but thanks, Lily.” Sirius gave her a warm smile. Glancing out of the window, he noticed the huge throng of students. There were greetings and farewells as they waited for the train doors to open.</p><p>“Maybe we should go out there, I want to see if my friends have arrived.” He suggested.</p><p>“Oh! Yes, sure,” said Lily. Sirius paused awkwardly.</p><p>“Actually, I might just get changed first,” he said, gesturing to his red top which the conductor had forgotten to clean and was spattered with unpleasant dark blood stains. He had realised that it was the perfect opportunity to change into his robes without his friends seeing him.</p><p>“Sure,” said Lily, “I’ll see you in a bit. Glad you’re okay.” She smiled warmly at him, stepping out of the compartment.</p><p>Sirius leant back, taking a moment to breathe and collect his thoughts. <em>You’re okay</em>, he repeated to himself. He changed quickly into his robes, screwing up the bloody top and leaving it in his trunk in the corner of the compartment where the conductor had put it, and took another deep breath. Then he stepped out of the train to find his friends.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>Sirius stepped out of the carriage, his robes swishing at his feet, to face a swarm of students. Had it always been this overwhelming, to be faced with a crowd of people? He took deep breaths, composing himself as he made his way slowly through the mob.</p><p>“Sirius!” He turned to see James and Peter pushing their way through the crowd towards him. James was tall, and found this easy, while Peter kept close behind him. James’ face was illuminated with a smile of relief and genuine joy to see his friend, while Peter’s smile was mixed with anxiety at the pressing throng of students either side of him. Sirius waved madly and they moved towards each other. When James reached him, he enveloped Sirius in an enormous hug. Sirius managed not to wince.</p><p>“How have you been mate? We’ve barely heard from you all summer!” James exclaimed.</p><p>Sirius shrugged, trying his best not to remember.</p><p>“It was okay, yeah. Sorry I didn’t write much, I was pretty busy… family engagements, you know.” He tried to sound casual, breezy, while neglecting to mention the punishments his parents had felt were necessary to ensure he behaved at the various engagements they had dragged him to.</p><p>James grimaced. “Sounds horrendous, having to deal with multiple Blacks.”</p><p>Sirius tried to shrug and laugh at the same time, resulting in a slightly strained look.</p><p>“Where’s Remus?” He asked quickly.</p><p>“We don’t think he’s here yet,” piped up Peter. “We’ve not seen him anyway.”</p><p>“Ah right,” mumbled Sirius. “Hey, how was your holiday Pete?”</p><p>Peter looked grateful to be asked, and James looked slightly guilty. “Good thanks! Just went to France with my mum and grandparents, it was really sunny though. We camped and went to the beach every day.” Sirius nodded, scanning the crowd for Remus. Last year their friendship had felt a little strange, especially during the final few months of term - as though something in the balance of their relationship had shifted slightly, indeterminably. Sirius had got the impression Remus didn’t want to spend time on his own with Sirius, and Sirius had been much more hurt by this than he would have thought. It had made him realise just how much he enjoyed spending time with Remus and he had hoped all summer that whatever distance had come between them could now be overcome and lost time made up for.  </p><p>When Sirius finally spotted Remus making his way towards them, he almost didn’t recognise him.</p><p>“I…think that’s him?” He questioned, aloud.</p><p>“What the hell,” said James loudly, following his eyeline.</p><p>Remus had always been tall and skinny, gangly even, but finally he seemed to have filled out for his height, and was even…muscly? Sirius’ head reeled. It was only the glasses, the way he was clutching his books as though they were the greatest treasures he had ever possessed, and the white scars littering his face and arms, that made him certain it even was Remus.</p><p>Remus approached them slowly, smiling when he reached them. There was a pause then James demanded to know “when - <em>how</em> on earth you got so fit, Moony?!”</p><p>Remus looked embarrassed. “I know you’re going to laugh, okay, but over the summer I started working out and lifting weights…” He dropped his voice, glancing around. “I read somewhere that improved physical fitness can slightly improve the pain of the transformation.”</p><p>James looked ready to ask a million more questions when Remus quickly turned to Sirius, who found himself still utterly speechless. “How are you, Padfoot? How was your summer?” The urgency of his questions made Sirius horribly aware that Remus might suspect more than he had previously let on about the state of Sirius’ home life.</p><p>“Er… fine,” he managed to stutter out. “Yours?”</p><p>“Mine was good, thank you. Why are you wearing your school robes?” Remus inquired.</p><p>All eyes turned to Sirius, who tried not to fidget under their gaze. “What on earth is going on?” demanded James. “Have my friends been abducted? Moony now <em>works out and lifts weights</em>, and Padfoot’s so keen to start studying he’s already changed for school.”</p><p>“I had a nosebleed,” Sirius admitted reluctantly, as he had hoped he wouldn’t have to lie again. Remus looked at him curiously, which made him feel oddly embarrassed. “I had to change out of my t-shirt, it had blood on.”</p><p>James looked surprised. “Couldn’t you just fix it? We are wizards, after all!”</p><p>“We still can’t do magic here, you berk. The train conductor helped me…” Sirius admitted, leaving out Lily Evans’ part in it, for reasons he wasn’t quite sure of.</p><p>Before the others could respond, the train whistle blew and they rushed onboard, Sirius leading them to the compartment he realised he’d left his trunk in. As they all piled in, he noticed Lily’s trunk on the floor next to his own.</p><p>“Fancy a game of Exploding Snap, Pads?” James asked his friend. Remus watched his friend, again curious, as Sirius didn’t seem to hear, worrying his lip with his teeth.</p><p>A knock came at the door a few moments later. Lily Evans entered without waiting for an answer, quickly picking up her trunk from the floor. She asked Sirius quietly if he was feeling better. Sirius nodded hastily. James’ eyebrows shot up to his hairline and he looked at Sirius for an explanation.</p><p>“Lily helped me with the nosebleed,” he said simply. James looked like he might die of shock. Lily smiled at Sirius and with a “See you later, Sirius”, left the compartment.</p><p>There was a pause. Then James threw himself dramatically onto the seat, pretending to swoon.</p><p>“Why am I so unlucky? Why couldn’t I have got a nosebleed and had Lily Evans rescue me?” He moaned. “Oh Lily! Dear sweet Lily.”</p><p>Sirius kicked him in the shin in a friendly way. “Shut up, James.”</p><p>The rest of the journey passed in the usual way. They all chatted about their holidays, Sirius asking so many questions that no one could get in a word to ask about his. Then Remus and Peter began a raucous game of Exploding Snap, while James intoned loudly about Lily’s many virtues. Sirius alternated between pretending to listen, trying not to stare at how different Remus looked, and catching himself gazing out of the window and thinking about his father. When the latter happened, he mentally shook himself and forced himself back into the present. Why couldn’t he shake it off? Usually his relief to be with his friends would draw him right out of his past, but this time he felt he was stuck in his head too much, and even a little anxious around them. He sighed, looking forward to going to bed already, even though it was only early afternoon.</p><p>The trolley came down the corridor and James bought a few items, Remus bought some chocolate and Peter bought an enormous armful of sweets. Sirius declined, but regretted it as soon as all three boys turned to look at him in surprise, for he had broken an undeclared Marauders tradition.</p><p>“You’re missing out, Sirius,” Peter informed him solemnly. Remus just glanced over at him, and Sirius couldn’t read his expression. James looked at him as though trying to work out if something was wrong. Sirius shifted awkwardly under their gaze, muttered “just don’t fancy sweets right now” and managed to change the subject by asking James whether he still intended to ask Lily Evans out continually this year.</p><p>A few other times during the journey he caught Remus looking at him intently. Sirius felt the heat creep to his cheeks and willed himself not to blush. When he smiled back Remus looked away, as though relieved.</p><p>While the other boys changed as the train neared Hogwarts, Sirius sat in his robes and congratulated himself on the fact he had avoided any awkward questions. Unfortunately, it gave him plenty of time to look at Remus’ changed body. His back, in particular, which had once been scrawny - with ribs poking out beneath its web of old and new scars - was now sinewy and strong, muscles twisting as he stretched his arms to put on his robes. His waist and hips were still quite narrow, but toned, and his shoulders and arms, though not extremely muscly, were obviously bigger than before. Sirius had to turn away quickly and look out of the window, keeping his thoughts on the magnificent castle appearing ahead and trying his hardest to quell his anxiety.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>When they finally reached the castle, the Feast began, as glorious as ever. Sirius’ anxiety seemed to reach its peak as the mountains of food around him appeared. He had barely eaten all summer and had grown very used to the empty, sharp feeling it gave him. Not leaving his room for lunch or dinner had also meant having to spend less time with his parents. He had found it gradually easier to eat less and less, which he largely put down to the cigarettes he had been smoking, which had increased proportionally. As the others piled their plates around him, Sirius’ hands fidgeted under the table, tapping his knee anxiously. When he looked up he met Remus’ questioning gaze.</p><p>“You okay, Sirius?” Asked Remus quietly. James looked at Sirius now too.</p><p>This was the moment. He could say he wasn’t hungry, refuse to eat, even leave the hall. He could tell them he hated the feeling of fullness, that it made him feel weak and slow, sluggish and vulnerable. He could tell them what his father had done to him that summer, what he had done every summer, but the little details which had made this summer stick with him, which made Sirius feel his father’s presence even now, in the safe space of Hogwarts.</p><p> But he couldn’t. He couldn’t break the spell, tell them he wasn’t feeling himself, because that wasn’t what Sirius Black, infamous Marauder, would do. He smiled confidently at Remus.</p><p>“I’m great, Moony,” he responded, helping himself to the nearest plate of vegetables, followed by some chicken and potatoes. He started to talk about pranks, so that the others wouldn’t notice how much food he was cutting up and pushing around his plate rather than eating. However he still ended up eating most of it, and felt uncomfortably full by the end of the meal when the food finally vanished. His skin crawled slightly, but he kept ignoring it, playing the confident, funny Sirius until he felt confident his friends would never suspect.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>That night in bed, Sirius couldn’t sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he was aware of how much he hurt. He had changed quickly in the bathroom, trying not to look at the bruises across his ribs and back, where Orion had beaten him yesterday. There were still red scars across his shoulder blades from the belt his mother had used on him a few weeks ago, after he had spoken out of turn at dinner and defended Gryffindor. <em>Stupid</em>, Sirius had realised since. They were never going to change just because he spoke out, it would only make things worse for him and make them more convinced that he needed his ideas and friends and House beaten out of him. The quieter he was, the less they had noticed him, and the less they had bothered to beat and curse him. His eyes focused on a burn on his upper arm. Perhaps the most disturbing injury of all, somehow. Orion had caught Sirius with a packet of Muggle cigarettes, and had silently taken one from the packet and lit the end with his wand, staring at Sirius as he pushed the cigarette into his flesh. Sirius had wept with pain, and felt horrified and humiliated afterwards. He had been extremely careful after that not to let his parents catch him smoking.</p><p>After a long time spent tossing and turning, Sirius moved quietly to sit by the window, grabbing his cigarettes from the front of his trunk. With his wand he lit one and breathed it in, relaxing as it calmed him, making sure to exhale out of the window. He gazed out over the dark Hogwarts grounds. <em>He was safe. Things were fine. His parents couldn’t hurt him here. He was okay.</em></p><p>He wasn’t sure how long he sat, eyes closed, repeating this mantra to himself. He had almost fallen asleep when he felt heat near his fingertips and, realising his cigarette had burnt all the way down, hastily extinguished it and threw it out of the open window. Casting a quick spell to blow the smoke out, he shut the window and crept back towards his bed.</p><p>“Padfoot?” In the moonlight Sirius saw that Remus was lying on his side on his own bed, looking towards Sirius.</p><p>“Hey Moony,” Sirius smiled, climbing back under his covers. “Couldn’t sleep?”</p><p>“I was asleep till just now, something woke me up,” said Remus sleepily. “Were you sitting at the window?”</p><p>“Yeah,” said Sirius.</p><p>“My favourite reading spot,” Remus revealed, yawning slowly. Sirius smiled to think of Moony curled up with a book on the window ledge.</p><p>“Sirius,” Remus opened his eyes more firmly now. “Are you okay? You’ve been kind of… quiet today. Just a little off.”</p><p>“I’m absolutely fine,” said Sirius, a fraction too quickly.</p><p>“Honestly?” Remus didn’t sound fully convinced. “Your holiday, was it really ok? I know your parents can be a bit… shit sometimes.”</p><p>Sirius physically winced at this, feeling his wounds. He hoped Remus hadn’t noticed in the dark.</p><p>“It was fine, Moony. I mean, I hate them, but it really wasn’t too bad. I’m just glad to be here now.” Sirius spoke with all the conviction he could muster, determined to get his friend off his back. Remus nodded, and met his eyes with a warm look.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re here too, Padfoot,” he smiled as his eyes drifted closed. Sirius smiled genuinely at Remus before he gradually fell asleep.</p>
