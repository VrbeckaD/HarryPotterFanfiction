          <div class="userstuff"><p>Sitting next to Harry on the stairs, Luna smiled dreamily into the companionable if angsty silence. “It’s a wonderful thing to belong, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Harry startled and stared at her.</p>
<p>“I always belonged to my parents, of course, but never to anyone else. I wanted to thank you for letting me be part of your club. Families are hard to find. We should treasure them.”</p>
<p>Getting up, she patted his shoulder. “We can belong to each other, too. All of us.”</p>
<p>Harry watched her as she turned a corner, bemused, his hand sliding to his shoulder where she’d touched him.</p></div>
