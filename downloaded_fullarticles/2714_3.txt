    <p>Severus Snape dreamed very small.</p><p>For eighteen long years, it was the promise of his time being his own to read or research or experiment, and to have enough money to purchase a bottle of wine, a frozen meal from Tescos, and to never have to discreetly count his coins when buying supplies in Slug and Jiggers again.</p><p>He dreamed of solitude when his duties surrounded him with the trappings of children. When he was trapped in endless staff meetings. When he was forced to socialize with Death Eaters at macabre soirees. He would escape into the night air and imagine just walking away, free as anyone to just go home.</p><p>After finding himself alive in the Hogwarts infirmary when he expected to be dead, he was finally free to do exactly that.</p><p>But he waited, because it had been the habit of a lifetime to be pressed into service by his betters and those to whom he owed debts. But Albus was not there to demand an accounting of his time and actions. The ministry appeared supremely unconcerned with his continued existence. Horace and Minerva seemed to have made him quite redundant at Hogwarts. </p><p>There was nothing and no one for him to give account to, and so, when Poppy demanded to know what on earth he was still doing there, he drew himself up with all the courage he could pretend, and walked away.</p><p>He walked past the gates of Hogwarts, down the streets of Hogsmeade, and farther still, long past the standard apparition points. He walked the narrow country road for miles until his feet burned and sweat ran down his back but he couldn’t stop. He couldn’t stop walking, afraid that somehow, somewhere, a mistake had been made and someone would be sent to fetch him back.</p><p>No one came.</p><p>Night fell, and in the cool dark of a Scottish meadow, he allowed himself to breathe.</p><p>He apparated home.</p><p> </p><p>Severus relished his first trip to Tescos. He delighted in selecting equipment from the potioneers catalogs. He took pleasure in finally making a series of small improvements to his home. On cool sunlit mornings he researched and wrote and brewed. On rainy, dark afternoons, he sipped tea or wine and read books by the fire. On warm, windy afternoons he walked into town and did his shopping with no fear he’d be unable to afford the things he wanted.</p><p>It was everything he wanted. It was peace and freedom and security at long last.</p><p>At night, after he’d had a long day in the lab, he would smile to himself. Albus would have been pleased for him, he thought, though Severus quite missed sharing a cup of tea and his discoveries with the old man, if only for a soul to bear witness to his life’s creative endeavors. To feel, only briefly, that he was more than the sum of his many failings.</p><p>As the days passed he thought of others. Lily, of course, but missing her was almost reflexive anymore. It was the odd thought as he trimmed the verge that he would have liked to have seen how Pomona was getting on with the crossbreeds they’d discussed developing. He thought of Minerva as he turned on the wireless, recollecting her insistence on keeping the staffroom tuned to whatever quidditch match was playing.</p><p>He didn’t give a toss about quidditch but he found himself turning the dial to the matches to hear the familiar and comforting voices of the announcers when the house seemed too quiet.</p><p>He thought of the Malfoys. He thought of evenings down the pub with Lucius as they ranted and complained about the state of education at Hogwarts. No blood prejudice, no officious snobbery, just honest indignation and drink-fueled attempts to set the world to rights. However much he’d loved Albus, as a headmaster he’d made a great general. </p><p>He thought of his children. Many had done very well for themselves, a few had covered themselves in glory and a few were now dead or in prison or lucky to be alive and free. He was thankful the number was not more.</p><p>He thought of Potter.</p><p>It was inevitable, he supposed. The young man had been the lynchpin of his existence for so long he was bound to pop up in his thoughts from time to time. And if he was being honest, he supposed he thought Potter might have sought him out before now. Either to make amends or settle scores or perhaps some amalgamation of the two. He had no desire for either, personally, but he would have expected it of him, fraught as their relationship had always been.</p><p>Finally, Severus resolved that while solitude was still his preferred state, it might behoove him to seek out company from time to time. With this end in mind, he owled Lucius to see if he’d be free for drinks in the coming week.</p><p>He was not. “Sorry, chap, as you probably read in the papers,” he didn’t, “I’m rather busy with our old passion project at the moment. I must admit I never thought to find an ally in Potter, but he’s a surprisingly pragmatic individual. All down to your good influence, I’m sure.  Rather preoccupied with Gryffindor notions of fair play, I’ll admit, but one can’t have everything. Cissy sends her love. Lucius.”</p><p>The sinking feeling in his stomach was entirely the result of not having eaten yet that day.</p><p>There was a pile of unopened Prophets near the kitchen window that he couldn’t be arsed to open while he’d been researching. He tore through them now, looking for some portent of this unholy bargain.</p><p>Potter and Lucius shaking hands outside the ministry. Potter and Lucius touring Hogwarts. Potter and Lucius apparently sharing a chummy laugh over a pint in the Leaky Cauldron. Of course the Prophet credited it to Potter’s forgiving nature and a mutual interest in education reform. A new curriculum for muggleborn and muggle-raised students to introduce them to the wizarding world. A revised muggle studies curriculum. Funds for students in need. New equipment for all house quidditch teams. </p><p>Severus snorted at that. But that wasn’t all. The young man apparently fancied himself Daddy bloody Warbucks. He was petitioning the ministry to reform their child welfare laws as well. And Lucius was involved there too, matching Potter’s donations, because it wasn’t enough to steal the dramatic reconciliation he’d bloody well <i>earned</i> after keeping that little bastard alive for the seven longest years of his life, oh no! He had to show him up financially too, the son-of-a-bitch.</p><p>Cissy was probably beside herself with joy, though he had to wonder how Draco was taking all of this.</p><p>He’d only just turned on the lamps in the house when a knock came at the door. Wand discretely out, he unlatched the chain.</p><p>He was only slightly disappointed to see it was Minerva. </p><p>He invited her in, poured her a drink and made an attempt at inscrutability.</p><p>“How are you, Severus?”</p><p>“Quite well, Minerva. And yourself?”</p><p>She took a sip of her glass and smiled sadly. “It’ll be a difficult year, and no mistake. You’ve heard what Potter has been up to, I’m sure?”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow in acknowledgement.</p><p>“I suppose he was rather at loose ends after the war. First helping to rebuild the castle. Now this. I can’t help wondering how he’ll cope once he returns in September. Without a war on, he might give Miss Granger a run for her money.”</p><p>Severus disguised his shock. “Is he returning to finish his schooling? I thought I understood he was planning to train as an Auror.”</p><p>Minerva smirked. “Not just yet. I think when all is said and done, he might find he’s had his fill of chasing dark wizards.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“As it happens, I’m in need of a defense master. Albus seems to think the curse on the position is quite broken now. I don’t suppose you’ve any interest?”</p><p>Severus quelled under that knowing look. She knew him far better than was comforting.</p><p>“I’ve been quite busy with research, you know.”</p><p>She hummed noncommittally into her glass. “I’m not Albus, you realize. I’ve some notion of the value of a galleon and I hardly expect my staff to work for the reward of shaping young minds.”</p><p>Severus couldn’t quite hold back a laugh. “Am I to resume duties as Head of House?”</p><p>“Would you like to?”</p><p>“If the alternative is Horace, I should think so. Without the necessity of preparing ingredients for classes or my duties for the Order I expect it would be a doddle.”</p><p>Minerva raised her glass to that.</p><p>A while later, after he’d shown her out, he considered how briefly he’d attained his heart’s desire. He glanced between the full icebox, the tidy home, the cauldron simmering softly away with hundreds of galleons worth of top-of-the-line weeds and entrails. And in barely two weeks he’d be returning to a castle full of cheeky adolescents, breaking up duels in the common room, preventing hormonal children from making more people in empty classrooms and broom cupboards, and reversing the spell damage of overconfident idiots.</p><p>“Thank god,” he sighed, putting out the lights, and going to bed.</p>
