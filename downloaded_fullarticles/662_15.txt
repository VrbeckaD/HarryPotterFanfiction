    <p>Regulus Arcturus Black turned his nose up at the sight of his older brother, disgrace to their family name, pushing over a row of trunks sitting on Platform 9¾. Potter was with him, laughing riotously as the luggage toppled and knocked over a stack of animal carriers and owl cages, releasing their occupants.</p><p>Chaos ensued.</p><p>Reg was glad their parents weren’t there to witness it.</p><p>Yelling filled the air as students scrambled to catch their pets. A loud scream was issued from a first-year as a long snake slithered past. The conductor huffed and puffed his way down the platform to assess the situation, and the two boys fled onto the train, howling with laughter. Reg thoroughly rolled his eyes, moving to help with the mess.</p><p>Sirius hadn’t noticed his younger brother on the platform, and Reg hadn’t been inclined to go over and say hello. Not after this Summer. Not ever again, if he could help it.</p><p>Reg righted the last trunk and boarded The Hogwarts Express. It was filling up with students clambering to find compartments. He vaguely recognized most of them, though he couldn’t have stated their names if he wanted to. Five years at Hogwarts, and Reg only really associated with his Slytherin housemates. Everyone else was just Ravenclaw boy, Hufflepuff do-gooder, Gryffindor girl to beat in Potions…</p><p>The carriage at the end of the train was full of Slytherins, and Reg took a seat beside Wilkes, placing his briefcase on the overhead luggage rack. Snape and Avery were sitting opposite them, their faces etched in their usual frowns.</p><p>Reg didn’t consider the Gang of Slytherins to be particularly pleasant individuals, but they held the same core ideals as the Black family, so they were as good acquaintances as any. They were now going into their seventh year at Hogwarts, making Reg the youngest, heading into his sixth.</p><p>They exchanged brief greetings and Snape was as cold towards him as ever. It was common knowledge that Snape and Sirius were sworn enemies, and Reg had always felt like some of Snape’s contempt was reserved for him.</p><p>“Is it true, then?” Avery asked him. “Did your traitor brother run away?”</p><p>“Not far enough,” Reg replied tonelessly.</p><p>The boys smirked.</p><p>“He looked like a fucking Mudblood in those clothes,” Wilkes said viciously.</p><p>Sirius had been wearing strange clothes on the platform. Things their parents would have burned if they had discovered them in their home. Tattered jeans, faded hoodie, beat-up sneakers. Potter’s donations, most likely, for despite his Pure-blood heritage, James Potter had a certain penchant for Muggle things.</p><p>Still, in the weeks following Sirius’ leaving, it had infuriated Reg that his brother had traded one Pure-blood family for another.</p><p>“Bit emotional, are we Black?” Snape caught on to his thoughts, his voice as slimy as congealed Polyjuice Potion.</p><p>Reg didn’t reply. He wasn’t. At least, not anymore. But he would be lying to himself if he said he hadn’t been angry, and, perhaps, hurt, after Sirius had left.</p><p>The shrill whistle signalling their departure sounded and the train rattled away from King’s Cross Station. Reg stared blankly out the window for a time – the scenery a blur of greens and golds – thinking back to the day Sirius had left. It had been raining in London, the sky swathed in heavy, dark clouds. Reg had descended the staircase from his bedroom after hearing another fight heating up below.</p><p>Their mother, Walburga, screaming, <em>“First Gryffindor, now these Half-bloods you consort with…disgrace to the House of Black…”</em></p><p>Sirius shouting back at her, <em>“Your Pure-blood mania…I’m done with it…”</em></p><p>Reg had stopped at the bottom of the stairs, flinching as something shattered inside the parlour. The door banged open and Sirius strode out with a vengeance, not acknowledging his brother as he furiously climbed the stairs to his room.</p><p>Reg barely had time to process the wild fury in his brother’s eyes, or move to the parlour to check on their now-silent mother, when Sirius thundered back down the stairs – trunk and wand in hand – and flung open the front door. But he halted, briefly glancing back at Reg, his long hair falling across his face.</p><p>“Are you coming?” Sirius had asked him, already knowing the answer.</p><p>Reg had stared at him, stunned, unable to say it.</p><p>Their mother appeared in the parlour doorway, her usually perfectly coiled hair lopsided, arms crossed, glaring expectantly at Sirius. But that had been the last time, apparently.           </p><p>Sirius drew to his full height and spat out, “I’m leaving this hellhole, and I’m not coming back.”</p><p>Their mother’s dark eyes alighted with fresh fury, and she screamed, “You are hereby disowned, disinherited, banished from this house! You are a blood traitor!”</p><p>Sirius left without another word, slamming the door shut behind him.</p><p>Reg had stood there for some time, staring at that door. Perhaps he had been waiting to see if his brother would come back, holding onto some hollow hope that Sirius had always been loyal to House Black, despite his place in Gryffindor, despite his reluctance to accept any of their family’s beliefs or traditions.</p><p>No.</p><p>Reg had eventually gone back up to his room and shut the door.</p><p>Now, Rosier and Mulciber joined them and the Gang began a quiet conversation about the war.</p><p>“The Death Eaters are recruiting,” Mulciber murmured. “And I’m joining them.”</p><p>Reg’s attention was regained. He sat up straight. “The Dark Lord’s recruiting children?”</p><p>Mulciber shot him a glare, not appreciating being inadvertently called a child. “If he knows they’re loyal, which I am. My whole family are Death Eaters.”</p><p>The other boys congratulated him. Avery looked positively green with envy, and Reg could relate. It was his greatest ambition to join the Death Eaters and rid the wizarding world of Muggle-borns.  He held them in great disdain, like his mother and father. He found Half-bloods were tolerable, but couldn’t deny he considered their blood tainted.</p><p>Not like his blood.</p><p>And it was only logical that pure wizarding families like his should dominate the wizarding world again. But for now, for Hogwarts, Reg kept his opinions at bay. Not like Wilkes, who actively went out of his way to torment the Muggle-born students. Or Rosier, who refused to speak to them. Or Avery, who quietly jinxed them in the corridors.</p><p>But Snape…Reg occasionally saw Snape’s animosity towards Muggle-borns falter. This happened in the presence of his late best friend, Lily Evans. Reg continued to wonder why. What made Muggle-born Lily Evans give Severus Snape pause?</p><p>Speaking of Evans, the new Head Girl now appeared in the doorway of their carriage to a chorus of taunts and hisses. She rolled her green eyes at them all and said, “I want a trouble-free journey to school, so stuff a pumpkin pasty in your mouths and sit quietly.”</p><p>Snape didn’t appear to be breathing.</p><p>Evans turned and left, her long red hair the colour of autumn leaves. Reg had to admit, she was a force of nature.</p><p>Snape was quiet after that. He appeared to be listening to the others talk, but Reg didn’t think he was actually processing anything. His eyes seemed too glazed over, too distracted. That girl had him wrapped around her finger. Or at least, he had wrapped himself there. After their falling out last year, Reg doubted Evans would ever speak to Snape again.</p><p>Occasionally the face of a Prefect would appear in the window of the carriage door and assess the Slytherin’s within – as though just being a Slytherin was grounds for suspicion. Once, Potter’s own arrogant features appeared, twisted into his signature mocking smirk, and the reaction it received from most of the students in the carriage made the earlier jeering of the Head Girl seem like a heartfelt serenade.</p><p>Reg remained unamusedly blank throughout it all, unable to stop thinking about the past Summer, and Sirius. The memory of the afternoon played on repeat, with newly remembered details or bits of colour added each time, the unanswered questions growing in number.</p><p>
  <em>What if he’d gone downstairs earlier? What if he’d tried to stop Sirius leaving? What if he’d followed?</em>
</p><p>But somehow he didn’t think anything he could have done would have made a difference. Once Sirius set his mind to something, there was no changing it. Besides, Reg hadn’t had what you would call a “good relationship” with his brother since Sirius had been sorted into Gryffindor six years ago. Not that Reg had particularly cared about this, back then. Afterall, he’d only been ten years old.</p><p>It was their parents, Reg had come to realise. With that one development, Reg had taken Sirius’ place as the prized son, and Walburga had done everything she could do to foster the traits of a Slytherin in him. Though for a short time, and perhaps as some kind of rebellion – at least until their mother had found out – Sirius had adamantly tried to convince a very impressionable Reg that he too possessed bravery and chivalry and honesty, and was therefore meant to be sorted into Gryffindor. But a year later Reg had been placed in Slytherin, and Sirius gave up his attempts.</p><p>During his first year at Hogwarts, growing further apart from Sirius and closer to his Slytherin housemates, Reg had wondered whether his brother had lied to him. Had said he had the true makings of a Gryffindor just to manoeuvre against their parents. But those suspicions eventually faded away, and Reg had felt torn to admit that he found himself thinking he could have done well in Gryffindor too.</p><p>But then the war began to seep inside Hogwarts’ walls. More Muggle and Muggle-born killings in the nearby villages, less autonomy for students. Reg had met the Gang during those long, stuffy evenings in the Slytherin common-room, sat and studied with them, listened to their opinions on Muggle-borns and Pure-blood status, as well as their ambitions to become Death Eaters. And he realised that there <em>were</em> others who held the same beliefs as the ones his parents had been forcing upon him (and Reg knew they had been forcing them upon him, he wasn’t an idiot). But these were people he could finally relate too, people who could fill the space Sirius had once occupied. So, Reg had just…succumbed.</p><p>Still, he hadn’t ever forgotten his brother’s efforts. Some part of him was even grateful. It told him that Sirius had cared, once. Had wanted to be a good brother (though he did reassess this on the occasion Sirius had found out that Reg wanted to become a Death Eater, maybe…a year ago. <em>That</em> conversation had not been reassuring of brotherly concern. But at that point, Reg had placed Sirius, and all the history associated with him, to the side.).</p><p>A scuffle towards the front of the carriage caught his attention. The Gang stopped talking and glanced over their shoulders.</p><p>A second-year with white-blonde curls grasped at his own throat, eyes blown wide in panic. Loud, choking gasps escaped his parted lips. The freckly boy across from him, half-risen out of his seat, appeared to be in a state of shock. The tip of the wand in his hand was still glowing from the jinx.</p><p>As more students noticed, some pulled out their own wands to try and assist, while others just rolled around in laughter. At this point, the boy’s pale face had turned a striking shade of purple.</p><p>“Shame,” Avery commented idly.</p><p>Reg rolled his eyes. An unfortunately limited number of young students at Hogwarts were perceptive enough to realise that petty magic could have dire consequences, and that if you didn’t have a good understanding of what you were doing in the first place, it was almost impossible to reverse it.</p><p>He made to go and do this, but before he had even rise from his seat, the carriage door slid open and a girl entered, the Prefect badge on the lapel of her Gryffindor robes shining so brightly Reg thought it must be charmed.</p><p>For a moment, she looked startled. Then she surveyed the situation with quick efficiency and actually <em>shoved</em> a fourth-year out of her way so she could continue down the aisle. The boy was clawing at his neck now, and even the roots of his silvery hair seemed tinged with purple.</p><p>“I –” stammered the freckly culprit, when the Prefect demanded an explanation.</p><p>She looked familiar, come to think of it, and Reg eventually placed her as the girl who had beaten him in Potions last year. And the year before that. Clarke? O’Connor?</p><p>“Collins!” Wilkes shouted over the din.</p><p>Ah. Collins.</p><p>She whipped her head towards them, but didn’t respond when she saw who it was.</p><p>“Fancy a haircut?” Wilkes asked loudly. He viciously mimed a slicing motion with his wand, which did have an unusually sharp tip.</p><p>Collins’ shoulders stiffened just perceptibly. With her hair pulled back, Reg hadn’t remembered how long she kept it. Now, he could spy the end of her braid hanging past her hip.</p><p>Turning back to the boy, Collins pulled her wand from the sleeve of her robe and muttered a spell. He immediately slumped back against his seat, dragging in great lungful’s of air as the colour slowly drained from his face.</p><p>In the following quiet, Collins managed to glare at every single Slytherin in the carriage, including Reg, before she turned around with a shake of her head and left. Chatter resumed as the door clicked shut.</p><p>Reg barely contained a vocal representation of his incredulity when the pale-haired boy shrugged off the whole situation and grinned, going for his own wand.</p><p>Perhaps the other houses had a point: Slytherins were extraordinarily skilled at misbehaving.</p>
