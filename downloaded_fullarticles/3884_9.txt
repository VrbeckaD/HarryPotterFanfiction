    <p>I can't believe it.<br/>
I can't.<br/>
But I have the proof of his deceit in my hand, I can't believe he's fucking my best friend! I knew Draco was cheating on me, I had hoped he wasn't even prayed, but why did it have to be Harry?</p><p>“Hey love what are you doing out here?” I didn't see him come up behind me, his blonde hair glistening in the sun light. “Hermione, are you listening?”<br/>
“Hi Dray,” my tone clipped.<br/>
His brow furrowed in confusion, “What's the matter Mia? Aren't you supposed to be in Charms? I thought the Head Girl was above skiving classes.”<br/>
“I just got some difficult news that I'm trying to process is all.”<br/>
“Is everything okay? Are your parents okay, I though the healer at Mungo's-”<br/>
“Draco, it's not my parents,” I turn to face him and look into his sparkling eyes, all the memories of us together, the smiles laughter, the fighting and making up, I can't do this right now, I need to clear my head. “I need a little space to think, I'm going up to my room, I'll talk to you later.”<br/>
“But, Mia-”<br/>
“Please Dray, later.” He's leaning forward to kiss me, and I turn my head, his lips touch my cheek, “later.”</p><p>I think I'm going to pace a whole in the floor. When I hired Colin to spy on Draco I never thought he would be with Harry. I knew that coming back for 7th year was going to be different from the beginning. I didn't expect to become friends with the Slytherins or that Harry and Ron would as well. I didn't expect that late night studying sessions would turn into late night snogging sessions but they did. I fell for Draco Malfoy, the boy that tormented me, called me foul names, but when we came back he was different. He apologized and I could tell he meant it. Our tentative friendship just blossomed into a relationship, so why? Why would he do this to me?</p><p>“Mione!!”<br/>
Shit, it's Harry.<br/>
“Mione, open up you missed classes are you okay?!” He's going to bang through the door if I don't open it up but I don't know if I can see his face at the moment.<br/>
“Mione, please I'm worried about you.” Like hell you are “I brought you my notes, and the homework assignment, I made sure that they are legible, please open up.”<br/>
I walked to the door and opened it a crack, “Hey Harry, I'm really not up to visitors right now, thank you for the notes, I'm just... not feeling great right now.”<br/>
He honestly looks concerned, but I just don't have it in me to care at the moment.<br/>
“Okay, well here is your notes. I guess I'll just go find Draco, we were going to meet at the pitch later but I guess if you don't want any visitors I'll see if he wants to go now. We're going to play a seekers game if you feel like joining us.”<br/>
My heart sinks, and I can feel bile rising up my throat, “I think I'll pass, I really need to lay down I think I'm going to be sick.” As he leaves I run to the bathroom and I throw up what little I had to eat this morning. I pull out the picture Collin gave me, the image is clear and perfect, Draco and Harry, my boyfriend and my best friend, in the Gryffindor locker room, skin glistening from the steam of the showers. They are both topless, tongues down each others throats. Draco is holding onto Harry's shoulders digging his nails into his skin as Harry fumbles for Draco's zipper. Draco throws his head back in ecstasy as Harry bites him in the crook of his neck. The scene ends there and replays itself over and over, all I can do is watch. With each passing second my anger gets more intense until I feels as though I will explode. I know that I need to confront them, and I need to do it now. If I don't I wont have the courage to do it.</p><p>Walking down to the pitch I'm not sure what to expect I just hope that they aren't too involved, I don't think I'd be able to handle it. I watch them from under the stands, they are really playing a seekers game at the moment. I sit and watch them, they both are truly beautiful. Draco with his blonde hair and pale skin, Harry with his black hair and sun kissed skin, opposites, but perfectly matched. As they touch down I can here my pulse speed up, I walk up closer in the shadows so that I'm still covered, but I can hear what they are saying.</p><p>“Do you think Mia is okay? She seemed to be really off this morning, she never skips class.”<br/>
“I'm not sure Dray, she didn't look too hot when I went to give her the notes.”<br/>
They continued to walk to the lockers and I followed as best I could. As they got to the doors, Harry grabbed Draco's arm and spun him around pinning him to the door.<br/>
“Harry, I don't think this is a good idea, this is a mistake.”<br/>
“A mistake? Really? Is that why I can feel your cock hard against me right now” Harry leaned into kiss Draco and Dray turned his head, almost in the exact way I did this morning.<br/>
“Harry, I love Hermione, I shouldn't have let this go so far, I'm sorry but I can't, and I need to tell her.” Harry pushed himself off of Draco and just stared at him. “She's your best friend, don't you feel bad? My stomach has been in knots ever since, every time I see Mia I just want to burst out and tell her the truth, it's killing me. I've got to tell her.”<br/>
“I know,” Harry hung his head, “You know how I feel about you, and how I feel about her. I love you both, and I just wish...”<br/>
I stepped out from the under the stands. They haven't notice me yet.<br/>
“...I just wish...”<br/>
“You wish what Harry?” Both their heads snap in my direction. I can see the look of horror in their eyes saying 'All this time she was standing there'. They look like deer caught in headlights, I see the defeat in their eyes. “You know, you've been acting off lately as well Draco. I know I probably should have just spoke to you, but I didn't know what to say. So I had Collin follow you.” I took the photo out of my pocket. By now it was wrinkled from looking at it so much. “You are truly beautiful together you know?”<br/>
“Mia.. I-”<br/>
“You what Malfoy?” he flinched like I just slapped him, I haven't called him that since he apologized to me early in the year. “You're sorry? Sorry that you fucked my best friend?” Now it was Harry's time to flinch. “I just don't understand, was it good? Was it what you always dreamed of? What I want to know is why you stayed with me when you so obviously love him. I would have been fine you know if you came to me and said you wanted to be with him, hurt yes, but happy in the end if it made you both happy.” They were both staring at the grass, heads hung low and shoulders slumped in defeat.<br/>
“Hermione, please,” I can hear the desperation in Draco's voice, “I wanted to tell you, I thought that maybe… things could… I'm not sure. All I know is that I love you, and I love Harry. I know that he loves us both, and I know that you love us as well.”<br/>
“What are you getting at Draco?”<br/>
“I was thinking, and I know that this probably isn't the greatest time to throw this out there, but if, I don't know, the three of us? I just… yeah, and I mean, I haven't even spoken to Harry about it, but...”<br/>
I just stare at him. I'm not sure whether to slap him or laugh. They just sit and stare and wait for me to say something, anything. But I can't because now that Draco threw that suggestion in the air it just keeps playing in my mind.  Draco with his blonde hair and pale skin, Harry with his black hair and sun kissed skin, and then myself, Brown hair and caramel skin, a perfect blend of the two. I can picture the three of us, sweat slicked skin, hands roaming, mouths tasting, the three of us tangled in the sheets, and the utter bliss it would create. I look at the photo in my hand. Their deceit and lies, I'm not sure if I can do it, at least not yet.<br/>
“I just-” I try and find the words, “I just need some time to think. I do love you both as well, but you lied and went behind my back, and I just, I need time to think. I'm not dismissing anything, nor am I making promises, I just need… some time.”<br/>
They agree to give me some space and they go their separate ways, this time into their respective locker rooms. I saw the way that they both looked, remorseful yet hopeful. I don't know if I can agree to this, but I love them, so maybe… maybe it could work.</p>
