  <b>IT WAS A RAINY DAY WHEN MRS. COLE OPENED THE DOOR TO ALLOW THREE CLOAKED FIGURES ENTER THE ORPHANAGE. </b>
  <span>Two of them were male while the other, much younger looking, was female.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl scrunched up her nose daintily at the state of the orphanage, surely this wasn't safe for children to live in. Was it?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Merlin," she swore under her breath, low enough so that the only people that could hear it was her two companions. "they don't pay us enough for this."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She swore she had seen not one or two, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>three</span>
  </em>
  <span> rats lurking around. She felt sick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s get the kid and get out of here, damn muggles.” the male to her right murmured softly, narrowing his eyes at the matron. “Her especially.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did she touch him?” the male to her left murmured, ire rising.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She believes he is touched by the devil.” the male on her right murmured back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll kill her,” the female volunteered, raising her hand a fraction. Neither male denied her. Her fingers twitched and she felt satisfaction pour all over her when she felt the cell organisms inside the matron shift without her noticing. “oh boo, only three days left.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And over here, the children!” the matron raised her voice, she had been talking while guiding them. Not that either of the three paid any attention to her. “We have the youngest in this area and then, the older children are in the other room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The female wixen hummed accordingly as she allowed her two companions to overlook the children. She noticed that her designed ward wasn’t there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me,” she said airily, “you do not have any young boys?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that moment, another matron came in. She was holding a young, scrawny boy by his ear. He was crying and trying to escape her grip, the three wixen narrowed their eyes when they saw blood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this how you treat the children?” one of her companions exclaimed, outraged. “Why, I should call the authorities right this instant!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both matrons paled considerably, the boy finally escaping the bloody grip of the matron and hiding behind the female wixen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We will be taking this one over here,” she sniffed, her magic instantly recognizing her ward. Brown eyes with unshed tears peered up at her, “what shall I call you, young one?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom,” he spoke hesitant, shyly, “Tom Riddle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well Tom,” she smiled gently, raising her hand for him to take if he wanted to, “may I adopt you and take you home?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the children began protesting and one even dared to touch Tom when the female raised her voice, “Enough!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom stared at her, awed. The room had gone completely silent with just one word. He allowed her to tug him gently away from prying thin hands and safely by her side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” he murmured, able to hear himself due to the silence in the room. “if you may, please adopt me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled, “It would be my honor, Tom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>A week later the orphanage forgot who was Tom Riddle, as if he wasn't born under the same roof he had been living for the first three years of his life. Mrs. Cole passed away a day later.</span>
