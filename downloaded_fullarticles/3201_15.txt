          <div class="userstuff"><p>Order willing, there will be a sizeable party later this evening to celebrate Harry's birthday.</p><p>There will be cake and merriment and genuinely happy smiles shared amongst so many people who have lost too much already.</p><p>For one night they will put aside the necessity of delegating shifts to watch, to gather information, to guard to celebrate one bright spot in the world.</p><p>The firewhiskey and the elderflower wine will flow until old songs are hoarsely sung and older memories are dredged up.</p><p>There may be tears. This is, after all, a war.</p><p>Just last week they lost two more members of the Order.</p><p>They will raise a toast for the lives lost in order to fight back against the darkness threatening to stamp out the remaining light.</p><p>Tonight Lily will smile and actually mean it even though her nerves jangle at every creak in the floorboards and her heart is still in absolute tatters for the Prewetts.</p><p>Now though, Lily is in the nursery as the sun begins to peak over the horizon.</p><p>Harry is awake, the little night owl, but peaceful in her arms as she rocks him.</p><p>If he feels any alarm for the way she is silently sobbing he doesn't show it, his vibrant green eyes taking in everything.</p><p>It’s been difficult for Lily to adjust. She has always had a sense of freedom, but failing that, at least a sense of community when surrounded by friends.</p><p>Every now and then she needs a reminder that though the war is still waging outside their doors that she is allowed to enjoy little moments and bask in the small blessed happiness of her child having a birthday.</p><p>She kisses his messy ebony crown and laughs as he gurgles hungrily.</p><p>“Happy Birthday, Harry.”</p></div>
