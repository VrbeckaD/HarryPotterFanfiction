    <p>Bad enough that the battle had been a disaster, bad enough that she’s been put in charge of a bunch of young students to ensure they were safe but the final straw, was that she’d be assigned to the last place she’d ever wanted to be. Prince House, the family home of Snape’s mother which was now his. Why did Hogwarts have to have been so damaged during the battle? Why couldn’t they stay there while the repairs were made? And why in Merlin’s name did she have to be the one to stay in the prickly ex-headmasters house? He’d be less than thrilled to see her and was bound to make life difficult for her and her charges.</p><p>	She pushed a hand through her thick curly hair and sighed, better to get a thing done than live in fear of doing it. It was a true sentiment and as Hermione looked up into the mirror on her dresser, she reassured herself that it was only a temporary thing. Until the last of the Death Eaters had been caught and brought to justice. It had been eight months since the battle at Hogwarts so why it had suddenly been deemed unsafe was beyond her. She picked up her trunk and left the room that had been hers for seven years. She didn’t know when she would see it again, or if she even would. Shutting the door behind her, she made her way to the foyer and spotted her group of seven students. All of them first years, all of them looked scared.</p><p>	Minerva stood waiting with them. All the students looked so young, how could she be responsible for all of them? After finishing her final year she hoped to stay on and teach some classes so she’d accepted the assignment willingly, what else could she do? That was before she knew where she would be sent. “Are you ready?” Minerva asked.</p><p>	“Not really,” Hermione replied.</p><p>	“I doubt you’ll see much of Severus,” Minerva said, “He’s not been the same since…” her words trailed off but Hermione knew what she was referring to. Since Nagini’s bite, the ex-Potion’s master had retreated into himself, rarely venturing out into the world. His offer to help when they’d called had come as a surprise to them all but it was one Dumbledore had jumped at. </p><p>	“I’ll do my best to avoid him.” Hermione knew she should feel more than she did towards him. He’d risked everything for their side and nearly lost it but seven years of antagonism wasn’t washed away so easily. Minerva nodded.</p><p>	“We’ll be in touch, if you need anything, send an Owl.”</p><p>	“Thank you.” Hermione said. She clapped her hands and the first years stopped talking instantly. “Now then you lot, it’s time to leave.” Minerva handed her an ornate plank of wood. “Everyone, grab hold of this.” The first years clamoured around, grasping for the wood. “Is that everyone? Come on Jack, grab hold here. Right. We’re ready Professor.” Minerva raised her wand, uttered the incantation and they were transported through the ether.</p><p>	When the world had stopped spinning, Hermione realised they were stood in the middle of a carefully manicured lawn. The bright, chill January sunshine shone brightly in the clear sky. She looked up at the huge Elizabethan house and her jaw fell. It was beautiful. The sandy yellow brick was immaculate, the windows were immense, it was calling out to be explored. “Is that where we’re staying?” Corby asked. All the first years were gawping, much like she was.</p><p>	“Yes. It would appear so.”</p><p>	“Did you know it looked like this?” Harrison asked.</p><p>	“No.” Hermione said. “Gather your gear guys, time we made our way there eh!” They did as she asked and slowly, they shuffled their way along the lawn. She stopped them just before they reached the door, “Remember what I said about the owner of this house?” she said. </p><p>	“He was a professor at Hogwarts before the war.” Sasha said.</p><p>	“That’s right,” she refrained from saying anything else, she’d let the kids make up their own minds. “Let’s go and make ourselves known shall we?” Taking a deep breath, she climbed the stairs and approached the large door. There was a huge brass knocker on the wooden door, which she raised and tapped three times. The door remained shut for a long while, she was about to lift the knocker a second time when the door opened a crack. At first there appeared to be no one there. She glanced down and spotted a House-Elf waiting expectantly, “Oh, hello.” Hermione said. It was the last thing she’d been expecting.<br/>
“You are to come in and wait in the Great Hall,” he said. His voice was high pitched and not altogether unfriendly.</p><p>	“Thank you.” Hermione turned to the kids and motioned for them to come up the stairs. They joined her and together, they followed the House-Elf into the house. The interior was just as impressive as the exterior. Perfectly kept and wonderfully ornate, the antechamber that led into the corridor was bigger than her room at Hogwarts had been. Unfortunately, they were quickly ushered into the Hall so Hermione didn’t get much chance to look around. She hoped there would be time over the next few days. </p><p>	The Hall took her breath away. The walls were cream in colour but they were adorned with portraits of the male members of the Prince family. The resemblance to her old professor was striking in some cases. A large mirror hung over the gigantic fireplace and dotted around the room were comfortable looking sofas that cried out to be sat upon. An awed hush fell over the first years as they too looked around the room. It was the bookcases that drew Hermione’s attention. She wanted to rush over and examine the titles on the shelves but she managed to restrain herself. She had to see to the first years before indulging herself. At least they’d be able to keep studying while they were here.</p><p>	Forceful footsteps echoed on the flagstones. Hermione turned around and looked directly at Professor Snape. It was weird to even consider calling him anything else. His appearance hadn’t changed much since she’d seen him eight months ago. OK, he wasn’t pale from blood loss and he wore a green scarf around his throat but other than that he was more or less the same. Same lank hair, same sardonic smile, same hard eyes, he glared down his nose at them.</p><p>	“I’m here to lay down a few ground rules before you run riot in my home,” he said. “The west side of the house has been remodelled to accommodate you all. There you will find everything you need. I only ask that noise is kept to a minimum after ten and that you do not enter the sitting room on the east ground floor and the east side of the second and third floor.</p><p>	“The kitchen is down the hall to the right. This is not Hogwarts, you will have to fend for yourselves here,” he said. Hermione knew what that meant. She would have to ensure they were all fed and watered enough during their stay. Damned if she was doing all the dishes though, these kids would learn some aspects of domestic life while they were here. </p><p>	“Feel free to roam the grounds as you wish,” he added.</p><p>“Thank you Professor,” Hermione said. She may not think much of him but there was no need to be rude about it.</p><p>“It’s Mr Snape now, Miss Granger,” he said with barely concealed disdain. “I shall leave you to organise these children.” With that, he turned on his heel and strode out the room. Hermione let out a breath she didn’t realise she’d been holding and turned back to her students.</p><p>“Grab your trunks guys, time to get you allocated in your rooms.” The first years did as she asked and followed her. She found the stairs and followed the directions Mr Snape had given her. They turned left to the west side of the house and found the doors already open for them. Inside, each room had five beds. There was a room for the boys and one for the girls. “I’m going to give you all half hour to get yourself unpacked and sorted, then come down to the hall and we’ll discuss how this is going to work.” Hermione said. The youngsters nodded and she left them, going in search of her own room. There was an open door next to the children’s room. She stepped in and her jaw dropped.</p><p>It was the most sumptuously decorated room she had ever set foot in. A thick rug covered the polished wooden floor, green and silver in colour, it depicted a serpent writhing in a deep silvery sea. The bed was the largest four poster affair she’d ever seen, with thick covers and curtains. Keeping warm in the deep January nights would not be a problem. There was a chest at the foot of the bed and an ancient armoire along the wall. The huge window looked over the gardens; it was perfect. She didn’t have the time to contemplate it however; she abandoned her trunk in the room and returned to the hall.</p><p>Hermione was running her eyes over the bookcase when the first of the students arrived. “All sorted Jack?”</p><p>The black haired young lad flopped into one of the sofas and nodded. He was shortly joined by Corby and Ryan. The three of them began chattering to themselves and Hermione looked over the bookshelf once more.</p><p>In ten minutes, all the first years were there. Hermione straightened and settled herself into an empty wingchair. “Hope you’ve all decided where you’re going to sleep and such.” Hermione said. There were nods. Good start. “I’m going to draw up some rotas this afternoon. We won’t be cooked for while here so we’re going to have to take turns in the kitchen.” There were a few groans about this but she was determined. “I’m not cooking for all of you and cleaning as well.</p><p>“There is also the matter of your studies as well. You’re not here on holiday. Prof- Mr Snape has seen it fit to provide you all with enough reading material to last a lifetime so I think you’ll have enough here to keep you occupied.” Hermione said.</p><p>“Do we have to?” Sasha asked.</p><p>“Not tonight, it’s Sunday but tomorrow, I want you to, yes. It’s your choice, however I know how hard the end of term exams are and it’s a good opportunity to get some cramming in.” Hermione said.<br/>
“How long are we going to be here?” Lara asked.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she replied. It was the truth too. She hoped it wasn’t going to be too long. Still, if Snape kept out of their way it wouldn’t be so bad would it? The house was certainly beautiful enough. “Any more questions?”</p><p>“You’re staying too aren’t you?” Clarice said.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Can we go outside now?” The eyes of the students widened and a couple of them sat forward in their seats. Hermione looked out the window, there was still at least three hours of daylight, she smiled. </p><p>“Come on then,” she said getting to her feet. The kids followed her as she led them back to the front door. She pushed the heavy wooden door open and walked into the pale sunlight. The kids charged out, down the stairs and onto the grass. They began playing games with one another as she watched them. Her gaze turned to the rest of the grounds; it would be lovely to take a turn around them in the summer. Examining the formal gardens and viewing the beautiful blooms that were sleeping beneath the ground at this moment would be exquisite. </p><p>As she watched the children playing, she realised what it was they were missing; rackets, balls, brooms and all other manner of lawn game, how long had it been since she’d played bowls? It reminded her sharply of her grandfather. She’d have to see about acquiring a set, as well as other activities for them to play with. She was sure Snape wouldn’t mind them using the lawn for what it was originally intended for. For the moment, it was enough to watch them scamper about. Some of them had wandered off to the side, intent on exploring the grounds a bit more. Three of the girls were stood gossiping about nothing, chattering behind their hands and glancing at the boys, who were chasing each other.</p><p>She shook her head and smiled. It reminded her of her own school days. Hermione got up from the bench she’d claimed and rubbed her arms, it was cold despite the sun. She could use a cup of tea and now would be a good time to check out the kitchen. “Girls!” she shouted. They looked up, “I’m going to see the kitchen.” </p><p>“OK.” Sasha shouted back. With that, she returned to the house. She navigated her way through the grand corridors, taking the time to admire the place as she went. The décor was rich, opulent but not garish. Finding the kitchen wasn’t the easiest task but it was well worth the search. Her mouth dropped when she saw it. The cooker was the largest she’d ever seen. Hanging from the walls were large copper pots. There were implements and instruments, pots and pans, cups, mugs and above all, a kettle.</p><p>It didn’t take long to get it on; she found the teabags and quickly made herself a brew. She wrapped her hands around the mug to get some warmth back into them and began a more thorough examination on the room. She sighed. She was going to get very good at cooking for more than one person while she was here. She’d bent down to pull out a pie dish when heeled footsteps brought her upright once more.</p><p>“Mr. Snape,” she said with a nod. He didn’t reply, instead stood frozen to the spot, a sneer on his face. She ignored it, instead manoeuvring around the kitchen to the fridge. “The kettle has just boiled and I’m about to start cooking something for dinner,” she said as she opened the fridge, “Did you want me to prepare you something as well?”</p><p>“I do not require a house keeper, Miss Granger,” he replied. He crossed the room however and poured himself a cup of tea. She swallowed and did her best to ignore the dark presence on the other side of the room. It was like being in class all over again. She drew in a breath and pulled out a large pack of mince. The crisp day warranted chilli. It would be perfect for warming those children up after they’d been in the cold. As she turned back to the counter and dumped the mince on it she remembered what she had to ask him.</p><p>“Would you mind if we used the front lawn for games?” she said. </p><p>His brow puckered for a moment before he shook his head, “No. Just don’t damage it.”</p><p>“Of course.” With that, he withdrew and Hermione returned to the task of cooking wondering how on earth she was going to manage living with the presence of that man and maintain her sanity as well as keep the children under her care safe.</p>
