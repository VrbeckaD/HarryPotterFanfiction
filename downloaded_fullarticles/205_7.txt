    <p>
  <span>The tawny owl tapping at the kitchen window was the second thing that got Remus’s attention from where he stood at the stove cooking breakfast. The first was a wide-eyed little boy sporting bubblegum pink hair pointing at it and shrieking with a level of excitement that could only be expressed by a five year old.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tada! Tada! There’s an owl! Look!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus looked over as it began to tap at the glass. “Daddy will wake up if you keep yelling, Teddy,” he told his son as he walked over to let the bird inside. It held out a dignified leg with an envelope attached and waited patiently for him to remove it. The letter was sealed with purple wax stamped in the Hogwarts crest and Remus eyed it carefully as he absently offered the owl a treat from a tin kept by the window. It took one and then fluttered off again, its duty done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A curious little body was suddenly at his side, peering up from his hip to get a look at the letter and grinning with a missing front tooth. His father shooed him back to his seat where he’d been coloring at the table. “It’s not for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it for you and Daddy?” the boy asked even as he settled back into his chair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” Remus pocketed the envelope in his dressing gown pocket to look at later and then shot a smile across the room at his son as he went back to the stove. He glanced over his shoulder again after a few minutes. “Bring me your plate. The eggs are done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yay!” Teddy hopped back out of his chair and pushed his paper and colored pencils aside, some falling on the floor in his eagerness. He practically skipped across the room to Remus to get his scrambled eggs with cheese and crumbled sausage on toast. “Diolch!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Croeso,” Remus answered, rolling his eyes at the mess the boy had made. “You realize that you have to pick all of that up when you are done eating, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy looked at the things he’d knocked onto the floor with a crestfallen expression on his face. He stared for a moment and then he shrugged and climbed back into his chair. The pencils floated up onto the table as he started to eat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus stared. He’d known since Teddy was born that he had magic; his hair had been changing since birth. He’d never used magic to affect the world around him, though. And by the looks of it, he didn’t even realize that he had. When Teddy looked up and saw him staring, he cocked his head curiously and smiled. Remus smiled back and then came to sit at the table with him, mentioning nothing of it. Sirius surely would have said something considering how excited he’d been when the little boy had started walking and talking. This sort of first was something he’d have shared if he knew about it. Remus wondered if he could get Teddy to do it again and pondered ways to set up situations without making it obvious. A Marauder smirk graced his lips as he realized that Sirius would be very willing to help in such an endeavor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy ate quietly, having learned that habit from Remus. His father rarely spoke while eating even though Sirius sometimes tried to initiate conversation and got short answers as replies. Instead, both Lupins tended to just listen to him talk. Teddy was far more excited to answer if his adopted dad asked anything of him, though, so long as he didn’t talk with his mouth full.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the morning was spent drawing with his son and waiting for Sirius to get up. Teddy seemed insistent on drawing pictures of his family lately, including three big people-esque figures and a little one to indicate his parents and himself. Remus helped him label them. One with brown hair and green dots for eyes was “Tada” while a black haired one with grey eyes was “Daddy.” The little one, currently pink haired with green eyes, was “me” and the last one, also with pink hair but with grey eyes, was “Mami.” This had become a fairly typical subject of artwork since he’d started primary school and it always warmed Remus’s heart to see Teddy include his mother when talking about his family even though he couldn’t remember her. There were pictures of her all over the cottage and Teddy kept one by his bed, in which she and Remus were holding him as a baby, next to one of Remus and Sirius playing with him as a toddler. Other family photos around the included Andi and Lyall while newer pictures included Harry and Ginny as well. Sometimes his grandparents and aunt and uncle made it into Teddy’s drawings as well but Dora was always there alongside Remus and Sirius.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Drawing without me, Teddy?” Sirius asked as he crept up behind the little boy. Remus had known he was coming but hadn’t mentioned it for sake of allowing Sirius to greet his son in what had become a customary routine of trying to make the little boy jump. Having been engrossed in the picture he was working on with Remus, this morning it worked. The pencils by his arm got knocked onto the floor when he whirled around to look at Sirius and Sirius just grinned at him. “Got ya.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Daddy!” Teddy complained then he turned to Remus. “You didn’t tell me he was coming, Tada!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus put his hands up to feign innocence. “He didn’t say hello to me either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You always know he’s coming!” Teddy argued.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus gave him a Marauder grin and shrugged. Teddy responded by pouting dramatically and folding his arms, clearly something he’d picked up from Sirius. He squeaked when Sirius scooped him up with an arm around his waist and put him over his shoulder. The pout dissolved into giggles and the boy’s hair shifted to his customary teal while he struggled to be put down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are eggs and toast for you in the oven to reheat if you want them,” Remus commented as he sat back and watched the scene unfold. Sirius was laughing now as he swung Teddy to hold with both arms and spun him around. Then they flopped into the chair Teddy had been sitting in and Sirius started to tickle him. Some quick magic from Remus kept the table from tipping over when Teddy kicked it but didn’t save the papers or pencils from landing on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let him go, Pads, before something gets broken,” Remus interrupted, shaking his head and smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Saved by your tada,” Sirius told Teddy as he stopped tickling his son and settled him in his lap instead. The little boy grinned and hugged him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He almost upended the table,” Remus answered. “Speaking of which, he now has to pick up the things he knocked off of it.” He couldn’t have set up a better way to see if Teddy would use magic again if he’d tried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy looked at Remus and then at the things all over the floor, his green eyes going wide. He wriggled to get off of Sirius and hopped down to start picking them up. Some of the pencils floated up to set themselves on the table while Teddy was gathering up his papers that had flung about the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Re, are you seeing this?” Sirius spoke in little more than a whisper, his expression a mirror of Teddy’s when he’d seen the mess he had made. That confirmed it. Sirius hadn’t noticed Teddy using magic before either.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He did it earlier, too,” Remus answered softly, a proud smile on his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy looked at them both, confusion etched onto his young face. “What did I do?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Magic, Mini-Moony,” Sirius answered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not big enough to do magic, Daddy. You and Tada said I can’t play with your wands.” Teddy pouted again at that statement. He had often expressed awe at seeing his parents perform magic around him and he was excited to one day get his own wand even though six years was forever according to the five year old.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did the pencils get on the table then?” Sirius asked him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy looked at the pencils and then at Sirius, his expression indicating he thought his dad had gone mad. “I put them there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“With your hands?” Sirius pressed on. This seemed to stump the little boy and he stared at the pencils again. When he looked back at Sirius, his eyes had gone wide. Sirius grinned at him and ruffled his hair. “You did magic, pup.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A wide grin spread across Teddy’s face as his hair shifted to black in response to the praise he’d been given by Sirius. “I did magic!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus saw the next question coming a mile away. Teddy turned to him, still beaming, and his hair went dark blonde. “Can I have my own wand now, Tada?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This was followed by a dramatic pout which Remus leveled with a stern look. The expression dropped from his son’s face immediately and he calmly climbed back up to the table in the third chair. He sat quietly with his hands in his lap until Remus pushed his drawings back towards him. Teddy smiled cautiously, receiving one in return, and then went back to coloring.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you do that, Re?” Sirius asked, watching the exchange before getting up to get his breakfast from the oven. A quick reheating charm brought it back to a good temperature.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do what?” Remus asked, raising an eyebrow at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius nodded towards Teddy who was smiling again and happily drawing a picture of himself with objects floating around him. Remus glanced at what the boy was drawing and took note of the way his hair had gone teal again then smiled at Sirius. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t argue with him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius appeared to consider the response as he took a bite of his toast but said nothing more. He didn’t speak again until Remus pulled the letter from his pocket to finally read. “What’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A letter from Hogwarts. I presume Minerva sent it. It arrived while I was cooking,” Remus explained as he looked at the envelope addressed to both himself and Sirius. Carefully, he cracked the seal and opened it, pulling out the short letter inside.</span>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Dear Remus and Sirius,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>With the Autumn 2003 Term soon to begin, I would like to meet with you both to discuss what the coming school year will bring. This is a delicate matter that ought not be discussed via owl. Please meet me at Hogwarts no later than 19 July. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Be safe with the full moon tomorrow and I hope to see you both soon.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Sincerely,</span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Minerva McGonagall</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>So they had up to a week to recover and possibly find a babysitter for Teddy. The boy still had school during that week so meeting during the day might be possible if Remus felt up to it. They had a charmed mobile phone that functioned within the castle in case the school had to get in touch with one of them. Otherwise, one of Teddy’s grandparents or Harry and Ginny could surely watch over him for the day. Remus wondered what was so pressing that it had to be dealt with now instead of upon their return to castle in late August. Before Sirius could ask more about it, he handed the letter across the table to him. He held it in one hand while eating with the other, eyebrows arching as the same questions apparently occurred to him as they had to Remus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tuesday or Wednesday, maybe?” Sirius suggested after a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus nodded. “If I’m well enough, yes.” The full moon was Sunday night. That ought to be enough time.</span>
