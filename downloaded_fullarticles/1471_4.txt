Said he could recommend him onto a Potions Mastery, as he had done for Severus, or an Apprenticeship in Runes or even something in History. He was on excellent terms with Bathilda Bagshot, after all. Perhaps Quidditch?</p><p class="p1">Regulus had almost laughed in his face. As if a Black could ever play professional Quidditch.</p><p class="p1">Father had actually deigned to write; the first time Regulus had ever received a letter from him. Asking — no, <em>demanding </em>— that Regulus put the maximum amount of effort into his NEWT studies because he would not accept anything less than perfect O grades.</p><p class="p1">Mother, on the other hand, was badgering him about witches. Told him he had to bring a nice, appropriate girl home for Yule or she would find someone for him.</p><p class="p1">Merlin, he’d rather stab his own eyes out than marry someone his <em>Mother </em>deemed appropriate.</p><p class="p1">How could he possibly make plans for his future when it was taking all his strength not to cry out from the pain of the burning in his left arm, the summons from the Master he had not chosen but had gone to willingly all the same? <em>How?</em></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p></div>
