  <em>Thought we built a dynasty that heaven couldn't shake</em><br/>
<em> Thought we built a dynasty like nothing ever made</em><br/>
<em> Thought we built a dynasty forever couldn't break up</em>
</p><p> <em>__ Dynasty | MIIA __</em> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Dumbledore asked in a voice laced with false caring, “Harry, you and Voldemort, what exactly had happened between you two?”</p><p>The raven haired boy in front of him took a deep breath before looking straight into his supervisor’s eyes, “I slept with him.”</p><p>For a long moment, Dumbledore just scrutinized the other boy in silence, finally the old man gravely said, “Abort the mission, Harry. You are <em>compromised</em>.”</p><p>“Bullshit,” Harry cursed before his brain had time to catch up with his mouth. Living among a bunch of criminals for so long hadn’t provided any help for his self-restraint, instead his bad impulses learnt a numerous amount of bad words. “You guys gave me permission to fake indentities, sell highly sensitive information, torture, kill, and even destroy evidence and cover it up as long as I could keep my cover. But when I slept with the Dark Lord, suddenly I’m compromised?”</p><p>"Harry," Dumbledore heaved a long sigh. “Never allow your feelings to interfere in your mission. This is the first and most crucial rule for a spy.” The old man stopped for a bit, “This is all my fault, I shouldn’t have used you in the first place. You’re too trusting, and with all the things Voldemort had done for you, I knew sooner or later, this would happen.”</p><p>“The only way out is <em>death</em>,” Harry tried to reason with the man.</p><p>“We will arrange everything for you,” Dumbledore gave a soothing smile.</p><p>“He won’t believe I’m dead without a <em>body</em>,” Harry still hoped he could prolong the inevitable end, even if it was only for a little while. He didn’t realize he had sunked that deep.</p><p>Dumbledore still appeared as calm as ever, “You will get caught, and be killed in prison, by Grindelwald’s men. Your body will get disfigured beyond recognition.”</p><p>“You…” Harry choked, immediately realized the police’s real intention, “You want to bait the two biggest gangs of England into a full on war?”</p><p>Dumbledore smile softly, blue eyes twinkling, “Only a hypothesis unless you’re saying Tom really would initiate a war in revenge for your death.”</p><p>“I can’t do that,” Harry shook his head, “I can’t make him to see my body. I promised,” His voice nearly turned into begging.</p><p>Dumbledore furrowed his brows, “Either you accept our terms, or risk blowning your cover. You think we want to force you?” The old man’s gentle voice filled with sympathy, Harry really wanted to punch him. “But have you ever thought of the consequences if He find out who you really are, a spy for the police? Do you really think He would still be as loving and cherishing you as he’d been now? His Death Eaters would still be kind and respectful toward you? You know Tom despises traitors most, Harry.”</p><p>Harry didn’t answer, his eyes burnt with unshed tears.</p><p>“Even if you don’t worry for yourself, think about your godfather. Have you thought of what Tom would do to your <em>dear</em> Sirius?” Dumbledore casually reminded him.</p><p><em>Threats. This was blantantly threatening!</em> Harry felt he was suffocating under too much despairs.</p><p>If only… If only he could go back and undo everything, Harry truly wished he had walked into the Gaunts without any hidden purpose.</p><p>If only he could, he would refuse to make that deal with the police, packed up his belongings and run as far away as he could the moment Dumbledore knew of his existence.</p><p>If only he could, he would…</p><p>If only, but <em>if only</em> didn’t exist in life.</p><p>Feelings grown from lying seeds were fated to die prematurely.</p><p>He and Tom couldn’t have a fairytale ending, because Tom lived in the real world, and Harry was born in a tragical fantasy. He was always unable to keep anything that he held dear.</p><p>Resigned, Harry nodded, hearing the sound of hope shattered, and his quivering heart cried out.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry had walked into Tom’s life with his breathtaking beauty, so young and innocent, and had stolen the heart of the most dangerous man in England with his brilliant mind and bravery soul.</p><p>His little lover had walked out of his life in handcuffs and with a tainted record. Multiple crime accusations guaranteed Harry a life sentence in a maximum security prison. The Dark Lord was beyond <em>furious</em>.</p><p>No matter how many bribes or threats the Dark side attempted; even with the most renowned and competent lawyer in the country, Lucius Malfoy, on this case, they still couldn’t strike against the Order’s determination in bringing down Voldemort’s most precious asset, his right-hand man, his lover.</p><p>It was a (<em>figuratively</em>) bloody battle in court. Drawn-out and exhausting.</p><p>In the end, there could only be one winner.</p><p>And it wasn’t Voldemort.</p><p>Harry kissed Tom goodbye like it was their last kiss, desperate and filled with love. <em>It was.</em></p><p>“I will get you out. I promise.” Tom whispered in his ears, frustrated and angry. He didn’t want to let go. <em>He had to.</em></p><p>“I believe you,” Harry breathed, with tearful eyes but still smiling, so sweet and oh so trusting. <em>He actually didn’t.</em></p><p>In only one week, the so-called Light side triumphal sent Harry Evans-Black’s death notification back to the Dark Lord.</p><p>And all hell broke loose.</p><p>
