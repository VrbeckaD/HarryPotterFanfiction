    <p>.o.</p><p>Sirius had been laughing as he fought his insane cousin in the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>The next thing he knew, Bellatrix Lestrange had sent a curse at him that flung him straight into the veil.</p><p>He only caught a glimpse of Harry's and Remus' shocked expressions before darkness swallowed him whole.</p><p>He thought that was the end of his story, but he was wrong.</p><p>Instead he woke up in the Hospital Wing with Lily Evans sitting vigil by his side.</p><p>His <em>Girlfriend</em> in an alternate reality.</p><p>.o.</p><p>He didn't know how long he had been out, but when he came to consciousness, he heard someone calling his name.</p><p>"Sirius, wake up! Sirius!"</p><p>It sounded like a woman was calling for himi.</p><p>So he slowly peeled his eyes open and saw a familiar red-head sitting next to his bed.</p><p>"Oh thank Merlin!" Lily exclaimed, hugging him tightly when he carefully sat up.</p><p>"Wha – what? Whoa, whoa, Lily?" He said to her, sounding uncertain. "Is that really you?"</p><p>"Yes, it's me! You had me worried there for a moment." She told him, looking teary-eyed as she finally let go of him.</p><p>"What happened to me?" He asked, dimly recalling the events that happened in the Department of Mysteries and how he fell into the Veil.</p><p>"You were hit by a bludger during the Quidditch match against the Slytherin."</p><p>Sirius heard Lily say, and his mind instantly come to a screeching halt at her statement.</p><p>"But I'm dead." He said to her, staring into those familiar emerald orbs.</p><p>"No, silly." Lilly said, brushing a lock of his hair in an intimate way.</p><p>Sirius stared at her, finally noticing that Lily Potter appeared to be no more than sixteen years of age.</p><p>"You're alive and the bludger hit your head. You probably have an concussion." She informed him.</p><p>"But – but-" Sirius began, more confused than ever.</p><p>"Oh come here, and let me give you a kiss before you go crazy on me. I've been wanting to kiss you since we won the Quidditch match."</p><p>And before Sirius could utter a protest, Lily Potter suddenly cupped the back of his neck and began kissing him straight in the mouth.</p><p>Instantly, Sirius Black felt faint at the feeling of her lips on him.</p><p>And he silently had to admit that he liked it.</p><p>He was just confused why Lily was kissing him though.</p><p>.</p>
