    <p>She was beautiful, from the moment I saw her I knew she was my one true love. Violet Dursley, my daughter. Her mother died shortly after she was born, so their i was, "single dad Dudley Dursley!" My parents would not approve. When she was about two or three i noticed strange things happening around the house, things would go missing and be knocked over, the wind was always so persistent in my home, even when the windows were closed. On Violet's seventh birthday I woke up to pounding in my daughter's bedroom, i walked in to see my seven year old kid floating on her dresser. With that my days of denial were over. I accepted her for who she was, of course I didn't tell her, i didn't want to scare her, hell I was scared! when I told my parents their reaction wasn't really a shock, the vein in Vernon's non existent neck finally popped and he died almost instantly, i believe his last words were "POTTER THAT DAMN FREAK OF NATURE CORRUPTIN'-" almost immediately my mother took his sock, tore off her clothes and ran down privet drive screaming "PETUNIA IS FREE! FREE AT LAST!" Than something about free elf's... i'm not sure. After that i knew their was only one person i could turn to.</p><p>"Dear Harry,</p><p>I would like to inform you of some unforeseen events which have accrued in the family recently. You may not know this but my father, Vernon Dursley recently passed away. I also have recently lost my mother, Petunia Dursley, She's been missing for three months now. Although the real reason I am writing is to say, I recently found out that my daughter is a witch, She is the love of my life and i will except her no matter what. I wanted to say i'm sorry for all those years i tortured you and I would like you to please look after my daughter because i decided, when the time comes, I am going to let her go to the same school you did... Pig-boils?</p><p>Sincerely, Dudley.</p><p>Ps. I'm sorry, i didn't know how to get this to you so i just duck taped it to a seagull i found in the park."</p><p>AN, it took Dudley three days to correct all of the spelling mistakes and to make his letter sound professional.</p>
