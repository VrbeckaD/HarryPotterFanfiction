    <p>“I know you like her.”</p><p>Draco jumped suddenly, startled by the whisper in his ear. He turned around and rolled his eyes at Theo who was grinning.</p><p>“Did you have to sneak up like that?” Draco snapped, running a hand through his hair that was not out of place, but he could never be too careful.</p><p>“Don’t change the subject,” said Theo as he stepped in next to Draco, their arms brushing. They were both holding flutes of champagne, but Draco’s had gone flat since he stopped drinking an hour ago. “What do you want to do about it?”</p><p>Draco felt his cheeks getting hot. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t want to do anything with her.”</p><p>Theo laughed and Draco had to bite his tongue not to snap at him again. He meant what he said, even despite the fact that his eyes were betraying him and he couldn’t stop watching Hermione Granger dancing gracelessly with some old ministry oaf. Theo was watching her as well, and Draco could easily accuse him the same way he had, but he knew Theo well enough to know that it wouldn’t affect him.</p><p>Theo reached an arm around Draco, his hand landing on Draco’s hip and pulling him just a little bit closer. “I know the only reason you think you hate her is because she and I work together and you’re jealous.”</p><p>Draco scoffed indignantly and looked at Theo with a frown. Theo’s brown eyes were bright with amusement and Draco hated how beautiful he looked.</p><p>“Not of her, of course,” Theo added. “You’ve already got me, and you trust me enough to know I won’t do anything to jeopardize that. However, you’re jealous of me because I get to spend so much time with her and you don’t.”</p><p>Draco tightened his grip on the fragile champagne flute and looked down. He couldn’t bear to look at Theo while his mouth felt sealed shut. He didn’t know what to answer and Theo knew it, but that wasn’t the part that seemed strange to Draco. He was basically admitting to his boyfriend that he liked somebody else, and he didn’t seem upset or like he minded at all. He even looked sort of happy about it.</p><p>Draco looked up again, slowly. Theo was looking at him with a questioning expression, as if seeking Draco’s approval. Draco’s heart was pounding almost painfully.</p><p>“Theo!”</p><p>They were both startled this time, and despite the intensity of the previous moment, Draco wanted to laugh at Theo, but his intentions died out when he realized who had said Theo’s name.</p><p>Hermione Granger stood in front of them, a cheerful smile on her face. “Sorry for interrupting,” she said, looking at Draco briefly and then back at Theo. “I just hadn’t had a chance to say hi. The men from the Senior Wizards Committee have tried to hog me the entire time. You’d think they would have another way of thanking me for saving their monthly parties.”</p><p>Draco wasn’t sure if his head was swimming because of how fast she talked or because Theo’s hand on his hip was almost starting to hurt.</p><p>“Can you blame them? You look lovely,” Theo told her with a charming smile. Draco loved that smile.</p><p>Hermione blushed and rolled her eyes. “Please, if someone looks nice tonight is you two!”  She waved a hand in their direction. Theo had stopped gripping Draco’s hip and he was now rubbing circles on Draco’s lower back and Draco felt like he couldn’t breathe. Hermione took a step closer and leaned in conspiratorially. “Don’t tell Harry and Pansy, but you’re definitely the best-looking couple here.”</p><p>Theo glanced at Draco for a second before his eyes returned to Hermione. “I will tell them if you don’t dance with me.” The hand that was on Draco’s back was now extended in front of Hermione in invitation.</p><p>She placed a small hand over Theo’s palm. “You’ll have to teach me, I’m terrible at this.”</p><p>“Of course, Draco taught me and he’s the best.”</p><p>They both looked at him, but Draco’s mouth was completely dry.</p><p>“I bet,” Hermione said with a warm smile.</p><p>Theo shoved his champagne flute into Draco’s other hand before pulling him in for a kiss, his hand on the back of Draco’s head. It was brief and chaste, but all Draco could think about was how Theo was kissing him while holding Hermione’s hand.</p><p>When Theo pulled away he had a knowing smile and Hermione’s face was completely red.</p><p>“Shall we?” Theo said to Hermione, who nodded and gave one last look at Draco before turning away, leading Theo to the dance floor.</p><p>Draco stood rooted in place, holding two champagne flutes and staring transfixed at them. Hermione looked much more beautiful dancing with Theo, perhaps because he was teaching her how to dance properly, or perhaps because Theo himself was beautiful. Whatever the reason, Draco felt his previous anger fade away and instead his heart was thumping with fear and excitement. He wasn’t jealous of either of them now that he understood his own feelings, but he wished he could be joining them right then.</p><p>He didn’t know how to handle the situation, but watching them move and spin to the music (and Hermione occasionally stepping over Theo’s foot) was enough for now.</p>
