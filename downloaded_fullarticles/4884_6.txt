    <p>''It's not like that.'' He circled around her in a flurry and pulled at his hair, making it look even more disheveled. She reached out a hand but froze once she heard excited voices. Draco seized Amira's arm and pushed her towards the stairs.<br/><br/>''<strong>Go</strong>!'' He hissed, He kept pushing and pushing, and when she tried to speak, he clapped a hand over her mouth so hard she bit her tongue. ''<strong>Get below! Go!</strong>'' she trembled, but out of anger she did what he said. His lip quivered as he watched her leave.<br/><br/>''But why?''<br/><br/>She whispered weakly to him.  She descended on her own time and listened to nothing but silence and approaching footsteps. But he finally looked at her with red, swollen eyes and whispered. ''<strong>I have to protect you.''</strong><br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/><strong>~~~~~~~~~</strong><br/><br/>Draco remembered the first time he laid eyes on Her. Small, Honey colored eyes and a mass of curls that made her resember some kind of baby beast. She was cute, but she looked back at him with much disinterest. <br/><br/>~~~~~~~<br/><br/>Ch.1 <br/><br/> <br/><br/>It seemed like we could on like this forever. remember? We were sort of friends when this all started out, we drifted apart. We were both at fault. Then the red thread of fate tightened itself and brought us back together.<br/><br/>It's a little repulsive, and even more so dangerous but, It's alright. Because as I remembered , you liked danger. in fact, you lived for it.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>~Draco's Point Of View~<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Narcissa Inspected her son before he got on the train. He could imagine his eyes were just as cloudy as hers. He didn't want to leave her. But then again he reminded himself that everything he was doing was for her. ''Everything is going to be alright. Just to think of other things. Would you?'' There she went with that bullshit again. <em>Thinking positive. </em>She wasn't the one doing the shit.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Draco offered his mother a weak smile. He actually didn't have a problem there. But she was always really, (annoyingly) good at seeing the brighter side of things, He wished He could be more like that. But how could He? How could He in times like these. <em>He</em> looked around for an example. Ah, Chosen one Prat Potter was getting on the train with his pathetic party. Weasel-by and that Mudblood Granger.<br/><br/>Behind them was someone He'd know since he first stepped foot in Diagon alley; Amira Grey. The curly headed tosser looked his way, her honey eyes focused and her mouth set in a subtle line. And something happened in Draco's chest that frightened him. <strong>That can't be her...It can't.</strong> But he knew that it was, He couldn't forget her face if he wanted to. He'd grown so acustomed to seeing it since he was only ten years old.<br/><br/>She looked so graceful as she lifted a cat carrier onto train. A little girl trailed excitedly behind her whom Draco recognized as her younger sister, mini tosser followed her. Her mother blew them a kiss and reminded them to write. Draco kissed his own mother and pulled her close. ''It'' all be over soon.'' He whispered to her and looked at one of the standbys. ''Well, these trunks aren't going to lift themselves are they?''<br/><br/>He swerved his way around them hopped onto the train. He expected that his mates Blaise and Pansy would have saved him a spot. He barely brushed pass Grey as she made her way to the cart with that Mudblood and their pack. But he did catch her gaze. Just as bored and uninterested as the first day they met. The sweet scent of something artifically strawberry flavored ambushed his nose causing him to wrinkle it.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>''Draco, Mate, we've been waiting on you.'' He barely Heard or paid attention to them whilst putting his carry-on above him. He looked over his shoulder again before the door closed, and caught a glimpse of dark curls descending. ''Oh... I get it, think she'll do you in again eh?'' Draco snapped out of his odd trance and looked towards Blaise. Pansy's eyes followed theirs and they looked away once Amira disappeared into her own compartment with her friends.<br/><br/>''She's filled out quite a bit since last year, I hadn't noticed...'' She mumbled worriedly. She glanced at Blaise and then at Draco. ''Friendly little tosser.'' Blaise commented. ''Who knew she actually had quite the bosom under those robes.'' He commented Maliciously. Pansy glowered. ''She's just another Gryffindor girl.'' She said turning away to sit down. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Draco pressed and got ready to take his seat, but not before thick cloud of dark smoke washed over us like a wave. After his coughing, sputtering and questioning. He sat down in an irritable manner and took a deep breath. It would be a long,Tormenting ride back to Hogwarts.</p>
