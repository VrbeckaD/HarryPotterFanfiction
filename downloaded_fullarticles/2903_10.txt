          <div class="userstuff"><p>I had a son once.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nearly the entire world knows him, by now.</p>
<p>I wonder how he'll deal with the fame when he gets there. Will he be arrogant and conceited? I hope not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I remember when he was born, James fainted. I nearly broke his hand. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He looked so much like James, even as a baby. What, with the same messy black hair. He had my eyes. 'Greener than grass, Lily Flower!' </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He won't remember me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had a son once.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To be fair, I had six of them, but he's different.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can't see him again, not until it's my time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wish I hadn't yelled at him so much. If only he could see his joke shop now. Hundreds of customers every day. He would be so proud!</p>
<p>I can almost see the look on his face; His brown eyes squinting as he throws his head back in a laugh, he'd hug George, maybe prank one of us...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was such a mischievous boy, up until he died.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wish I could hug him again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had a son once.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was born into wartime, I hope he never knows what it was like, I hope he never lives it. If he does, my death will have gone to waste, right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I remember those first few days. He went from brown eyes to green to blue. Blue hair to red to brown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus was terrified. I wonder if he liked steak as much as his father did.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know Harry was the right choice, but I can't help but envy him.</p></div>
