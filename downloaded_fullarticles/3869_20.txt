    <p>Your name is HERMIONE GRANGER, and, for the record, you never signed up for any of this insanity. All that you ever really did, now that you think about it, was read. You reading led to you being smart, and you being smart led up to the greatest detective in the world, also known as L, taking you under his wing as his apprentice, along with three boys known as Near, Mello, and Matt. That led to you earning an alias; PANDORA. Somewhat fitting, you supposed, as you had always been curious and dangerous at the same time (you prefer to think that the original Pandora unleashed the horrors of the Box onto humanity on purpose, being the only female in existence at the time).</p><p>Anyway, reading was what got you into this mess. Well, you suppose that even if you had the chance to do it over again, you would still read, as you quite enjoy doing so. This mess just happens to be named The Legislation, which is what the club that is composed of you, your "brothers," Sollux Captor, Aradia Megido, Nepeta Leijon, Equius Zahhak, Connor Murphy, Alana Beck, Aranea Serket, Veronica Sawyer, Terezi Pyrope, Wybie Lovat, Clarke "Mouth" Devereaux, Jane Crocker, Rose Lalonde, Dipper Pines, and Coraline Jones. The leaders of The Legislation a.k.a. the mess are L, Izaya Orihara, Neophyte Redglare, and Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>It all started when you first met L, about a few months ago. You had recently been orphaned in a fire, and you had been moved from orphanage to orphanage for several months, until you reached a special one with kids similar to you. Not exactly like you, however. They couldn't do the same things you could, but they accepted you nonetheless, and helped you keep your secret from the adults. However, it couldn't stay that way forever, not when you were surrounded by adults that were just as perceptive as you are.</p><p>You were reading in the library alongside Mello, who was studying for a test that was still a month away, Near, who was solving a puzzle for the fifth time, and Matt, who was playing Mario Kart on his Nintendo when a man walked up to the four of you and sat down with his knees up to his chest.</p><p>He was pale, tall, and spindly, reminding you of a willow tree. You only glanced up from your book to observe him for a moment, but you really should have given him more than a moment's gaze. He watched the four of you for a while with dark eyes, eventually making you suspicious of him.</p><p>&gt;Pandora: Question him.</p><p>PANDORA: Who are you? Why is it that you're staring at us like that?</p><p>Matt startled out of his video game, interrupted by your interjection.</p><p>MATT: g0daMM1t, p! y0u Mad3 M3 l0s3 th3 gaM3!<br/>
PANDORA: Oh, grow uP. You've won it a thousand times already!<br/>
NEAR: she's right.<br/>
MATT: st1ll! i was just ab0ut t0 w1n f0r th3 f1ft13th t1m3!<br/>
PANDORA: Does that idiotic game really mean that much to you?<br/>
MATT: h3y, My aut1sM tak3s 0ff3nc3 T0 ThAT! gaM1ng 1s My th1ng!</p><p>You sighed.</p><p>PANDORA: Look, I'm sorry, but that's not the Point!<br/>
MELLO: NO, P, DON'T YOU GET IT?<br/>
MELLO: mATT'S FEELINGS?<br/>
MELLO: THEY'RE ALWAYS THE POINT.<br/>
MELLO: ALWAYS.<br/>
PANDORA: Honestly, do you two have the caPacity for maturity of a teasPoon?</p><p>You pinched the space between your eyebrows with your forefingers, feeling a migraine coming on from the boys' emotional immaturity. You honestly didn't know why you hung out with them all of the time.</p><p>The man that had been the topic of discussion at the start of the conversation snickered as he smirked at the boys' antics. You felt a twinge of annoyance. He was the adult here, why didn't he act like it? He had just been silently sitting there after you first asked him the question, why couldn't he intervene and stop them from being so fucking immature?</p><p>You glared at the man.</p><p>PANDORA: You haven't answered my question, anyways. Who are you?</p><p>The man's smirk stayed present.</p><p>STRANGER: If I toLd you, Pandora, you wouLdn't beLieve me. MeLLo, as much as you appreciate messing around, do cease your teasing. If you don't, I'LL be forced to report it to Mr. Roger.</p><p>This sent Mello off of the edge.</p><p>MELLO: NO WAY! ANSWER HER QUESTION! WHO ARE YOU? mORE SPECIFICALLY, WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?<br/>
STRANGER: Hm. ALright, I'LL teLL you, but in a more secLuded area. We wouLdn't want anyone to Listen in to our conversation now, wouLd we?</p><p>The man got up and started walking out of the library. When none of the children followed, he turned his head back to them.</p><p>STRANGER: WeLL? Are you coming?</p><p>Matt was the first one to follow. He shrugged, then picked up Near, who had difficulty walking, and followed the strange man. Mello followed, seething. You bit your lip nervously, then ran to catch up, knowing that this was a very bad idea.</p><p>PANDORA: You know that this is a bad idea, don't you? He could kidnaP us, or we could get in trouble, or even worse, thrown out to the streets!<br/>
NEAR: he woN't. doN't worry, paNdora. he would Not be here if he were daNgerous. he must kNow mr. roger, how else would he kNow our Names?<br/>
MATT: n3ar's r1ght. th3 s3cur1Ty h3r3 1s h3lla h1gh t3ch. 1 sh0uld kn0w, 1'v3 hack3d 1nt0 1t.<br/>
MELLO: BESIDES, WE CAN FIGHT OUR WAY OUT IF WE NEED TO. IT'S FOUR AGAINST ONE, AND WE CAN ALL FIGHT HERE.</p><p>Mello looked at you pointedly, referring to your abilities.</p><p>MELLO: ESPECIALLY YOU, P.</p><p>The stranger looked over his shoulder slightly at this. You didn't pay much mind to it back then, but you know now that it was then that he realized that there was something different about you, compared to the other children there.</p><p>After a few minutes of silently following the man, he opens the door to a small office that you Wammy orphans aren't allowed to go into.</p><p>STRANGER: Go on, I won't teLL on you. I have speciaL priviLeges.</p><p>You reluctantly followed the others in, pinching the seam of your shirt between your fingers in hopes of soothing your nerves.</p><p>The willowy man jumped onto a swivel chair, crouching the same way that he was before. There was a couch across from him.</p><p>STRANGER: PLease, make yourseLves comfortabLe. WouLd you Like some tea? Coffee? I can request that Watari bring some.<br/>
MELLO: WATARI WOULDN'T DO THAT, HE'S PROBABLY BUSY WITH- OH mY GOD.</p><p>Watari only occasionally visited the orphanage, as he was the caretaker of L himself. The orphans were always told to stay out of his way, and to never ask him for anything. He was a rather daunting figure, even without the warnings of Mr. Roger surrounding him.</p><p>You suddenly realized who this man was.</p><p>NEAR: you're l.</p><p>L nodded.</p><p>L: I am. HeLLo, Near, Matt, MeLLo, Pandora. Like I said, make yourseLves comfortabLe. I've asked Watari to bring in refreshments.<br/>
MELLO: Um, NO. YOU CAN'T BE L.<br/>
L: Oh? Why is that, Mello?<br/>
MELLO: L'S TOO ImPORTANT TO BE TALKING TO SOmE ORPHANS.<br/>
MATT: M3ll0's r1ght. why w0uld y0u tak3 t1Me 0ut 0f solv1ng cas3s just to talk t0 us?<br/>
L: You are correct in thinking that I usually don't take the time to speak to the orphans here that are trained to succeed me. However, now I am. Why don't you sit down?</p><p>You were the first one to make a move. You slowly walked across the well-lit room and sat down on your legs on the couch. L smiled at you encouragingly.</p><p>Matt set Near down on the couch before sitting down himself, with Mello following.</p><p>MATT: if y0u'r3 r3ally l, t3ll us soM3th1ng 0nly h3 w0uld kn0w.<br/>
L: Very weLL. What do you want to know?</p><p>You looked down at your hands folded on your lap, thinking. Then, you remember something that you had wanted to hear for the longest time, but were denied ever since you first came to Wammy's House.</p><p>PANDORA: Tell us our real names.<br/>
MELLO: PANDORA! NO!</p><p>The boys looked at you in amazement, mostly because speaking your real name was strictly forbidden in Wammy's House, and the consequence was immediate expulsion from the orphanange.</p><p>L: Don't worry, I won't teLL.<br/>
L: Is your name reaLLy what you want to hear, Pandora?</p><p>You swallowed a knot in your throat.</p><p>PANDORA: ... Yes. It is.</p><p>L smiled again.</p><p>L: Pandora, your name is Hermione Jean Granger.<br/>
L: MeLLo, you're MihaeL KeehL.<br/>
L: Matt is MaiL Jeevas, and Near is Nate River.</p><p>You felt a sense of comfort upon hearing the familiar name fall from another person's lips as you relaxed into the back of the couch. <em>"Finally,"</em> you thought, <em>"something familiar among the rabbles of the unknown."</em></p><p>After everything, it's still you.</p><p>You all looked at each other, confirming the fact with each individual. This man was indeed L. Only he would know their real names, as only he would have access to that information.</p><p>Watari opens the door with a platter of cups at hand. He hands each of them a cup of what smelled like coffee with an excess of cream and sugar.</p><p>Mello eyed his drink suspiciously before sipping it and finding it to his satisfaction. Matt just began chugging as soon as he was handed the teacup (You rolled your eyes at his obscene behavior). Near handled the cup delicately, only to start gulping it down the moment Watari left. You simply sipped at your coffee thoughtfully, observing L all the while.</p><p>L: Do you have any questions?<br/>
MELLO: WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO US?<br/>
L: To you particuLarLy?<br/>
MELLO: YES.<br/>
L: Because you four are the greatest candidates to be my successors when the time comes, and Watari has instructed me to be a mentor to you four, since you will one day be taking over my position as L.</p><p>You frowned. <em>"Why would L need more than one successor,"</em> you thought, <em>"and isn't the whole point of this place to find the top orphan, not the top orphans?"</em></p><p>L frowned in return.</p><p>L: Why do you aLL Look so confused? Do you not understand?</p><p>Matt shook his head.</p><p>MATT: n0, 1t's just that... w3 w3r3 always t0ld that 0nly 0ne 0f us w0uld b3c0M3 l.<br/>
L: ... Is that so?<br/>
MATT: y3s.<br/>
L: I... I see. I was not aware of that.</p><p>Mello growled.</p><p>MELLO: mAYBE IF YOU WERE EVER ACTUALLY HERE, YOU mIGHT HAVE NOTICED THAT.<br/>
PANDORA: Mello!<br/>
MELLO: NO! I'm SICK AND TIRED OF TRYING TO LIVE UP TO THIS GUY! NOT ONLY THAT, BUT NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE IN FIRST PLACE!<br/>
MELLO: THIS IS BULLSHIT!</p><p>You glared down at your hands, balled into fists as your nails dug into your palms painfully. You knew Mello was right, and you were angry about it too.</p><p>You looked up at L's unblinking eyes, still glaring. The lights in the room started to flicker.</p><p>Angry that L had never even thought to take the time to get to know the children that were forced to try to become him. Angry that you were forced to take those stupid tests just for this child of a man. Angry that the only reason this orphanage kept you around was because you were smart. Angry that your friends were pressured to beat the highest scores, not just themselves. Angry that they let that happen to themselves. Angry that it took a child killing himself for them to realize that they were being to hard on orphans. Angry that you were so fucking <em>different</em> from all of the other children you'd ever met. Angry that there wasn't anything you could do about it. Angry that your parents were <em>dead.</em></p><p>The lights that lit the room popped, and you found yourself screaming in all of your rage, feeling it escape along with the air from your lungs. You weren't in control of your own body anymore, you were only an observer as you screamed and screamed and screamed. You faintly felt tears streaming down your cheeks, sobs strangling your screams, Matt and Mello and Near grabbing at you, holding you, trying to calm you down, could faintly hear their voices over your own screams.</p><p>Finally, when the rage was done with you, it let you go, causing you to collapse into your friends' arms. Sobs wracked your form as you cried until you fell asleep, too exhausted by all of the emotions to even stay awake.</p><p>When you woke up, you were on a flight to the U.S., along with your now official brothers. They told you all that they knew; that you and them, along with L and Watari, were going to a camp where you could learn to control your magic, among other things.</p><p>That was how you came to be in the Camp for Atypical Children.</p>
