    <p>Since Remus started this thing he carefully watched out that nobody will see it. No one should see his scars and cuts. His friends probably thought he was always cold and didn't over thought when he was wearing his usual sweaters, even when it was a bit warmer outside.<br/>It wasn't easy to live in a boarding school and hide the fact that you harm yourself but he managed it. Until a special someone with black, long hair became sceptical. Sirius.<br/>For a while now Remus had feelings for his next-door neighbour and also best friend.<br/>Because of his feelings he became a bit more careless around Sirius.<br/>While the both of them were studying together the taller one didn't notice that his sleeves slid a bit up. <br/>The black haired instantly saw the scars on his wrist and pointed at them while asking "What did you do there?"<br/>In a second Lupin blushed and looked away. "This... Uhm... A few years ago I cut myself on a broken glass..." His voice was only a mumble along with him adjusting his sleeves.<br/>The shorter one of them didn't believe him. A quick side glance and Remus was almost sure that Sirius was worried about him.<br/>The usually so loud one only whispered this time. "Moony..."<br/>Moony, Padfoot, Prongs and Wormtail. These were their nicknames within their little group. Sirius was Padfoot, James was Prongs, Peter Wormtail and like he was called a moment ago, Remus was Moony.<br/>Although Pads called him,  the bookworm didn't answer.<br/>"Remus."<br/>Remus' heart stopped for a second before beating way faster than normal. It was odd to hear his real name from Sirius. He wasn't accustomed to that.<br/>"Do you cut yourself?"</p>
