          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione was kneeling in a hallway, trying desperately to heal the wounds of one of the DA members that had come to their aid tonight, Hannah Abbott. She wasn’t the best at healing — she had only managed to teach herself the very basics so far — but it was the best they currently had, so she had to so as much as she could.</p><p>“Let me help,” a small, soft voice came from behind her.</p><p>Hermione turned slightly, still keeping an eye on her patient. “Greengrass. What are <em> you </em>doing here?”</p><p>“I’m trying to help,” the Slytherin replied softly, motioning towards Hannah and then to Justin and the other couple of unconscious students around them. “If you will let me.”</p><p>It’s not an accusing tone, Daphnane clearly understands why Hermione is hesitant.</p><p>“Why should I trust you?”</p><p>“You have no reason to,” Greengrass acknowledged. “But I was wrong, before. I know that now.”</p><p>Hermione scans her face for any dishonesty — a waste of time, considering the Slytherin’s mask — and then the hallway. She sighed.</p><p>“Alright,” she said before she fully knew what she was doing. “Help, then. I’ll keep an eye on you.”</p><p>“I’d expect nothing less,” Daphne responded, rolling up her sleeves and kneeling down in front of Hannah.</p><p>Hermione did not now how long they worked like this, but she knew that she would no have been able to achieve the results they had on her own.</p><p>“Thank you,” Hermione addressed Daphne once they were done. “But what made you change your mind?”</p><p>Daphne looked conflicted for a moment before she sighed. “You did. You’re smart and beautiful and ambitious and all the things I was told Muggles and Muggleborns could never be.”</p><p>Was she blushing? She couldn’t be, right? What reason could she possibly have to blush when she never had when she had made a mistake before.</p><p>“I’m not the only one,” Hermione pointed out.</p><p>“I know. But you’re the one who caught my attention.”</p></div>
