  <strong> <em> A WAIST </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em> Chapter I: the ghost </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lord Voldemort let out a merry laugh as the faces in the crowd of his enemies sullen</span>
  <span>, </span>
  <span>and a murmur arose slowly. It was so simple. They were going to yield now. He had won the war. He was immortal. Invincible. Nobody would ever challenge him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had conquered faith. He didn’t care that he was actually walking in a pool of blood, he didn’t care that he was going to rule over the ashes. He had won and nothing could spoil his victory.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Who would dare defy him now? Who would dare stand in front of him? He was alone, all mighty and all powerful, he was- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That I am.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>All the people still alive startled, whichever their side. Voldemort turned around, peering</span> <span>down at Harry Potter's corpse. He was stoic, unbreathing, cold in the tight embrace of the half-giant. Dead, undoubtedly, definitely dead. Slowly, he let his eyes move to the source of the voice, a little farther, between the terrified students and his men.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The world</span> <span>seemed to stop. It wasn’t possible, it just wasn’t. All of them were silent.  Nothing moved except the dawn breeze blowing gently, without affecting the boy. He was nonchalantly resting against one of the broken pillars of what had been the Hall of Hogwarts a few hours earlier.</span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry James Potter looked at him, recessed amusement in his brilliant emerald eyes. The first rays of the sun shone on his skin, tanned by days of flight, months outdoors and years of Quidditch, passing lightly through him, giving him the appearance of a translucent cloud. He was no longer dirty, nor covered with mud or blood. His black untamed hair swayed slightly under the warmth of the day ahead. The wrinkles of pain, the black markings under his eyes, the fear and harshness that marked his face had disappeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked peaceful. He was beautiful. He was dead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He cracked a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Hi Tom! Did you miss me?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It took a few moments for everyone to regain their senses. Well, the ones who weren’t still blocked, stupefied and open-mouthed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"But ... but you're dead!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Thank you for pointing out the obvious, Malfoy. He's dead; he would not be a ghost otherwise." Voldemort's voice could have frozen a volcano. Lucius blushed with shame and bowed his head as if apologizing for his own stupidity, whispering a ‘Sorry, my Lord’. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yup, I was in the purgatory and I met Albus, he suggested I come and bother you a bit." Said the boy as if everything was normal. "So, tell me, Tom, what's going on now?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A few seconds passed before someone burst out laughing. Harry turned to the person in question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione had tears in her eyes and her hands clasped over her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Harry ..." She said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No one could tell if she was happy or sad. Their eyes met, and she understood. There was no reason to be sad. He smiled at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"My god, 'Mione, did a horse walk on you? You look terrible!'</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His voice was sweeter than it had been. It was alluring, pure, a dance of silk on his tongue. Unnatural. Perfect. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That's no way to talk to a lady!" She exclaimed grandly, strangely imitating the tone of Narcissa.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now he was laughing too, a echoing laugh, true and dead. No one had heard him laughing so heartily  during his lifetime. Nothing seems to trouble him now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A shudder passed through more than one spine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was utterly terrifying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked at each face, of his friends and professors. More than one was crying. They couldn’t understand that it was meant to be. But it was so ironic… He looked… he looked more alive than what he was during the short seventeen years he had lived. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny was sobbing. He gave her an apologetic smile. It was not for her that he had come back. She tried to reach for him, but her brother stopped her. She whimpered and wailed like never before, her cries tearing through the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled to her softly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He turned to face Hagrid, who was still carrying his corpse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Oh, Hagrid, do not be sad, I was condemned long before I was born, you know. I've been accepting this for a long time… But do me a favor, will you? Bury me next to my parents, at Godric’s hollow. I never truly had another home than Hogwarts, but I guess it would be unfair of me to ask to be buried here."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He cast a last glance at his corpse, and his eyes seemed to lose their joy for a moment, his mouth twitched in an expression of emptiness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was terrifying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then his smile returned to his half-transparent face as he advanced towards Voldemort.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You did not think you'd get rid of me so easily, did you? Death is not an option, Tom."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t even a threat, merely a statement. His voice was soft and inviting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A person who knew Voldemort as well as Harry Potter did, Albus Dumbledore or maybe even Severus Snape would have guessed the fear that lingered on the face of the most powerful wizard in the world for less than a second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But none of these people were still alive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stared at him, his innocent smile not weakening for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Days. It had been days since the ghost of Harry Potter was following him everywhere. He had hoped that the boy would be stuck at Hogwarts, well, at what was left of Hogwarts, but no. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, he had to follow him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For Salazar’s sake!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A familiar chuckle sounded behind him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My my, if Albus knew that I made you swear on your ancestors!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And he was there, lying on the sofa as if he were at home with the  grace and relaxation that he had never had in his lifetime.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Voldemort before he shut (away) all the students who had not surrendered, as well as some professors. He was waiting to decide what to do with all these people. His mind had been preoccupied with other things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter had to be exorcised. It was only a few days since he started following him and Harry was already pushing him into a state of fury. And it was not good as a true general must be able to keep his head cool, and even if Voldemort had just won the United Kingdom, he still had the rest of the world against him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy had his feet on the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And he didn’t want to bloody die. Well, he was dead, but even in death he had managed to be insufferable. It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>worse</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Dark Lord hadn’t slept, hadn’t ate, hadn’t even taken a shower since. It was like his very body felt threatened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It may have something to do with the ghost following him in the </span>
  <em>
    <span>bathroom. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Obviously the fact that his enemy, the boy that had murdered six parts of his soul was in the same room every hour of every day. It didn’t help with his concentration </span>
  <em>
    <span>and the boy still had his damn feet on the couch. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid you will not be able to tell anything to your dear headmaster, boy.” He spat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You never know, Tom, you never know.” Answered the boy with a frustrating sweetness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone knocked on the door. Voldemort allowed a few seconds to pass, regaining his composure before allowing his servants to enter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A cruel smile spread over his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter, even in death , was Harry Potter. If the boy had decided to make him suffer, well he had many, many ways to get even. Each of them being his friends who he had left in the world of the living.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Neville Longbottom. The boy who could have been in Harry's place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Voldemort knew Harry better than anyone, ironically. He knew that this boy had more value in his heart than all his other friends combined. Neville was an innocent. He had been bound to him by the same prophecy. He was the Gryffindor Harry could never have been because of the horcrux.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oh yes, Voldemort knew of the horcrux. Unfortunately, he had understood it only too late, when he felt the anchor tear his soul at the boy's death. The pain had been instantaneous, unbearable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Only a horcrux could provoke this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Oh, he would love to make the boy suffer. If could not die then he was going to make him feel pain and despair for eternity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Delicious.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy entered the room in the expert hands of the Lestrange brothers. He was still covered with mud, the sweat and blood of the battle and the beatings that had been inflicted upon him since he arrived in Lord Voldemort's personal dungeons. Tears ran down his face and under the debris of his clothes. His jaw was clenched in a determined expression and his eyes still defied the Dark Lord.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>A true Gryffindor</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Well, all of them were going to die, that’s for sure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stood up quietly, his expression taking on a serious air. Cold and dead. A thrill ran across Voldemort's back, but he was the Dark Lord. It took more than a glare from a ghost to discourage him. He was going to get revenge on this impudent child, at last!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy moved gracefully across the room, floating above the floor. It was strange that even in death he was wearing his oversized clothes. It was even more strange that they looked like they were fitting him. He looked…regal. All of his movement seemed to have a purpose for the years to come. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Voldemort could </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel </span>
  </em>
  <span>the infinite void behind his body, following him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I'm sure you're thrilled to see your friend, Mr. Longbottom, Harry...Do not worry, I'm sure the Lestranges treated him very well, after all, they have experience with this family, don’t they?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Neville struggled, but the two brothers' hold was firm on his shoulders. The two of them seemed to enjoy this situation very much, in view of the wretched smile that twisted their faces.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Lestranges brothers were perfectionists, and this work had been left unfinished for nearly sixteen years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was inadmissible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But now, their master had returned. And now that Voldemort had won, nothing could stand in their way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They deliberately ignored the heavy look from the ghost standing a few paces from their master. It would not bode well to get scared now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Neville was tired. Dark bruises circled his eyes. He looked old. Not older, just old. He was a man, a warrior, and more. Just like every survivor in the war. And now, he was a prisoner. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> He looked desperately at Harry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now, what are we going to do to you…” whispered Voldemort, his red eyes glimmering maliciously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p>So,  this is a little fanfic I'm writing aside the others. It will probably be quite short. This first chapter is a test, to see if you are interested by the idea! Sort of a prelude, kind of.</p><p>UPDATE: this chapter was edited and corrected! </p><p>Lot of Love</p><p>~LadyBraken</p>
