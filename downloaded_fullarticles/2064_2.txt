    <p align="center">One Dark Lord may have fallen and yet another is just starting to make waves as Harry Potter enters the Auror program. Blake is forced to cross over into dangerous territories alone as more of his past is revealed and they face the revelation that the Dark Lord has a more personal connection than they first believed as Blake battles with his own demons while trying to stop the man from tearing down everything he has built.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Part Five.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">xXx</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Harry leaned back against the wall behind him at the back of the large room as Minister Rufus Scrimgeour voice rolled over the people gathered at the press conference. This was the third meeting that Harry had been to this week and Severus had just given him a look as he'd left him at the front gates of the school. The vampire had gone back to his Coven for a while and Harry was planning on heading that way soon but he still had to be seen.</p><p>“Hey Blake,” Kingsley greeted softly as he moved to stand beside him.</p><p>“Hey,” Harry replied as he looked around. “Any problems here?”</p><p>“Lots of anger,” Kingsley said softly. “And relief. People are still not sure if that is the end or not. They are scared and unsure, Blake. They were here before when the you-know-who fell the first time."</p><p>Harry sighed and looked down at his hands.</p><p>“Dark Lord Voldemort is dead,” Harry said with conviction. “You have his body, he is not coming back.”</p><p>Kingsley looked at him as the Minister’s voice rolled over them.</p><p>“But is it over?” Kingsley asked quietly.</p><p>Harry looked up at the man next to him.</p><p>“It’s never over, Kingsley.” Harry said softly. “There's always seems to be someone that wants to take what isn’t theirs.”</p><p>Kingsley smirked at Harry with a glint in his dark eyes.</p><p>“And there are always people that want to stop them,” Kinsley remarked with just as much conviction. “How is Mr Potter?”</p><p>“He’s doing well,” Harry said as he thought about his son. “The Minister has already contacted us a few times about an interview, which Severus has taken great delight in stirring the boy up with.”</p><p>Kingsley huffed a laugh.</p><p>“I knew Snape when he was arrested during the first war.” Kingsley said suddenly. "Was part of the team that arrested him, in fact. He knew we were coming and just stood out the front of his house, waiting for us."</p><p>“What?” Harry said in surprise as he looked at the other man and brought up a silencing charm around them.</p><p>“You know his history?” Kingsley questioned.</p><p>“Some of it,” Harry admitted. “I had his file pulled years ago but haven’t look at it. He has told me some as well.”</p><p>“I was very surprised the day that Albus Dumbledore spoke for him at his trial,” Kingsley told him. “I thought for sure he would hang with the other death eaters.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes hardened as he looked at Kingsley.</p><p>“Not now,” Kingsley said quickly. “He may have a dark history but he is a good man.”</p><p>“He is,” Harry agreed. “But even I wouldn’t cross him.”</p><p>Kingsley huffed a laugh</p><p>“Doesn’t help he has the vampire on his side,” Harry grumbled.</p><p>Kingsley barked a laugh, glad for the silencing charm around them, as the press conference broke up. More than a few glances were thrown their way as the reporters and others started to leave the room. Harry had already made it clear that he was not going to be making another statement but it never stopped them from annoying him.</p><p>“How are things going in Germany?” Kingsley asked.</p><p>“Quiet so far,” Harry replied. “I’ll keep you updated. I’m off to France for a couple of weeks…or until I’m told to leave.”</p><p>“Thanks, Blake.” Kingsley said with a smile as he clapped him on the shoulder before moving off.</p><p>Harry watched the man move through the crowd before he sighed and made his way out of the room. Ignoring any calls from the press.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry held the bundle of flowers close as he apparated and looked up at the burnt-out building before him. The charred beams still exposed and the stones burnt and crumbling in some sections. Small patches of grass and weeds had started to grow between the shell of the house and he looked at them in interest. It had been over fifteen years since he stood on this spot and he could feel the memories pushing to the forefront of his mind as he looked at the building.</p><p>He should have done something with the house, as he looked over the wreckage, but he just couldn’t bring himself to do it. It wasn’t his to touch. He stepped forward and walked along the path until the debris stopped him from going any further and he laid a single flower, from the bundle he held, on the front step then stood back.</p><p>So much had happened since the day that he'd stepped through the time gap to see the dark mark lighting up the sky, bathing the house and street in green light. He'd been just been one of many people that night that had stood there as Hagrid ran into the house as he stood frozen to the spot. His mind unable to process what was happening around him as he'd stepped from one hell to another.</p><p>He turned around but there was no goblin standing there, holding papers out. He shook those memories from his mind and stepped back onto the street and away from the house. He still had no idea what had compelled him to come here, of all places, it just felt right.  He moved down the silent street, no one out at this time of night, as he moved into the small grave yard.</p><p>He knew where to go as his feet lead him to the two graves and he stopped. He crouched down and halved the flowers and placed one pile on James Potter’s gravestone and the other half on the grave of Lily Potter.</p><p>“Well,” Harry said softly as he looked at the two graves. “Dark Lord Voldemort is dead. Your son is still alive…”</p><p>Harry choked on his words as his knees touched the ground and he held his cane before him in a vice like grip.</p><p>“He’s a smart boy,” Harry said softly. “Full of life and laughter…turned out better than I ever could.”</p><p>Harry fell silent as a bird called out somewhere in the night.</p><p>“He’s following in your footsteps James,” Harry said as he looked at the man's grave. “And he has your compassion, Lily.  Severus still looks out for him, like you would have always wanted. Much to Severus’s reluctance, but I know he cares for the boy. We both do.”</p><p>Harry looked down at the earth below him as he clenched the cane in both his hands.</p><p>“Remus has a little boy,” Harry whispered, as the tears started to fall silently. “Sirius…well he will probably never grow up. They are all doing well. They are all alive. Remus and Tonks will see their son grow up. Little Teddy, such a whirlwind of a child."</p><p>Harry looked up at the graves as the moonlight broke through the clouds, shinning down on him as he read the words before him.</p><p>“You would be proud of the man your son has grown into, I am.” Harry said softly. “I followed your wishes in your will. Harry finished his schooling at Hogwarts and was in Gryffindor. I know you would have wanted that James.”</p><p>Harry wiped his tears away from his face as he tilted his head back and looked up at the almost full moon above him.</p><p>“He did it,” Harry said softly. “He stood up to Dark Lord Voldemort and looked him right in the eye. He showed courage that you would have been proud of.”</p><p>Harry laid his cane next to him and ran his hands through his hair and grabbed his head as he bowed it.</p><p>“I think I would have been a letdown for you,” Harry said softly. “Too much dark magic and blood on my hands. The Potters have always been a light family and soon it will be again.”</p><p>Harry looked down at the grass under him for a few long minutes before he slowly got to his feet with the help of his cane and looked down at the graves at his feet. The names and dates clear to see as the moonlight shone down, the day they had died had been the day he had stepped into his time and he looked away. With that in his mind he turned and walked away from the graveyard without a backwards glance.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry looked down at the closed file in front of him, as he sat at his dining table, sipping on his coffee.  He had his bag ready to go beside him as he waited for Severus. They were still at the school but Harry had already given Severus the key to his house in Leeds while he was heading to Dracka’s Coven alone.</p><p>Severus wasn’t happy with being left behind but Harry had to do this himself and Severus didn’t know how to deal with Vampires the way Harry did, not that he thought that Dracka's Coven would give the man trouble, he just needed some time. He tapped his pen against the table, his eyes were drawn back to the file. Severus may have a dark history when he was young and yet Harry had his own. A history seeped in blood and dark magic. Harry sighed and grabbed his head as he thought on that.</p><p>“You just can’t talk to that man when he's had too many Lemon drops!” Severus exclaimed as he banged into the room. “He just told me that Lucius Malfoy would not be charged!”</p><p>“Not enough evidence,” Harry replied as he sat back in his seat.</p><p>“You knew!” Severus snapped, not in a good mood.</p><p>“They told me when I got to the Ministry today,” Harry replied.</p><p>Severus smirked and sat down at the table, Harry slid the file across the table and Severus picked it up and flipped it open then paled. His eyes flew up to Harry in surprise before looking back down at the file in his hand.</p><p>“I haven’t read it,” Harry said softly. “I had it pulled years ago with a few other files and forgot about it. Kingsley mentioned your arrest today which reminded me.”</p><p>Severus placed the file back on the table and pushed it until it lay halfway between them.</p><p>“Hey, Dad!”</p><p>Ry banged into the room with his bag over one shoulder.</p><p>“How come I have to go to the Burrow while you are in France?” Ry asked as he threw himself into a chair at the table, his bag thumping to the floor as he let it drop.</p><p>“It’s either that or staying with Severus in Leeds,” Harry replied, focusing on his son.</p><p>“But I’m an adult now!” Ry whined in a tone that grated on Harry's nerves. “Can’t I stay at one of the Potter houses?”</p><p>“Fine,” Harry snapped, with more heat than he meant to.</p><p>Ry reeled back with wide eyes and Harry sighed and pinched his nose.</p><p>“Sorry, Ry.” Harry said. “Let me get the list of properties under your name, you can stay in one of them if you want.”</p><p>Harry got up from his seat and moved to the bedroom as Ry turned to Severus.</p><p>“Is he okay?” Ry asked softly.</p><p>Harry shut the door before he could hear Severus’s reply and went to his cupboard and picked up the small wooden box with Ry’s Gringotts keys and the papers of his properties and other stuff from the Potter in side of it. He looked down at the box in his hand and ran his thumb over the Potter crest on the top of the box. He was still a Potter by blood but now Ry was the head of the family and he felt a little sad that he would be giving that up to the boy, but he had done it before. He had already lived his life as Harry Potter and he hadn't much liked it the first time.</p><p>Harry should have given Ry the box and passed the title to him when he turned seventeen but he had wanted to wait until the boy had finished school or at least the mess with Voldemort was sorted.</p><p>He stepped out of the room and placed the box on the table and slid it over towards the boy. Severus sucked in a breath and placed his hand on the top of the box before Ry could grab it. Ry’s eyes flicked between them as Harry’s eyes locked with Severus.</p><p>“Blake,” Severus hissed, his dark eyes intense.</p><p>“Let him have it,” Harry said softly, resigned.</p><p>“Dad?” Ry questioned, when the silence stretched.</p><p>Severus pulled his hand back with a huff and Ry picked the box up and looked at the crest on it in interest, before opening it up.</p><p>“These are now yours, Harry Potter.” Harry said softly, completing his part of the ritual.</p><p>Harry could see Ry shiver as the magic settled around them and Ry looked at him with large eyes.</p><p>“The papers have each of the properties that you own and what is in the Potter vaults.” Harry said softly. “When I came here the goblins divided the vaults between us. I moved my half to the Sun vaults and left all the properties, except for one, in your name. Anything to do with the Potters or Lily Evans I left for you.”</p><p>“But,” Ry said softly. “They are your parents as well.”</p><p>“As you have said before,” Harry said softly, side stepping what the boy said. “You are an adult and that is the Potter family vault under your name. I should have given that to you when you turned seventeen, since that’s when you became an adult in the wizarding world, but I wanted to wait until after you finished school.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Ry said as he looked over the papers and placed them on the table.</p><p>Severus reached over and picked up one of the papers and looked it over as Ry emptied the box on to the table. Harry's eyes caught on the Potter crest of the paperwork and the gold keys.</p><p>“I’ll leave you with it,” Harry announced and left his rooms.</p><p>Harry closed the door behind him before striding off down the hallway, he wasn't sure where he was going, he just had to move.</p><p>“Blake!”</p><p>Harry paused as Severus grabbed his arm and Harry turned.</p><p>“You do realise that you have left your file on the table with Ry,” Harry remarked and the other man cursed and looked torn. “Go on.”</p><p>“Stay here,” Severus snapped and disappeared back into the room.</p><p>Harry leaned up against the wall and waited. Severus reappeared with a file in his hand.</p><p>“Can’t leave anything around that boy!” Severus snapped.</p><p>“Just put the gory file on the top of the pile,” Harry said with a smirk. “He won’t look at the ones under that.”</p><p>Severus held the file out to Harry but he didn’t take it.</p><p>“That is yours,” Harry told him. “If you want to share anything in it with me, that is up to you, Severus. We both have times in our lives that we are not proud of or want to share."</p><p>Severus crossed his arms and looked down at Harry.</p><p>“You passed the Potter name to Ry,” Severus said softly.</p><p>“He is Harry Potter,” Harry said with a smirk.</p><p>“So are you,” Severus stated calmly, his eyes shining.</p><p>“I am Blake Sun,” Harry said. “I haven’t been Harry Potter for a very long time. The Potter name was always going to go to Ry, for that is who he is.”</p><p>“Blake-”</p><p>“No,” Harry snapped and turned away. “I am not that person anymore. I’ve walked away from that name once before.”</p><p>“Dad?”</p><p>Harry tensed and looked back at his son.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Ry asked softly as he moved towards them.</p><p>“Sure, all good.” Harry replied.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Ry asked as he stopped in front of him.</p><p>Harry frowned at the boy as Severus watched them carefully.</p><p>“I'm just tired, Ry.” Harry said softly and ran a hand over head. “I leave tomorrow for France, if you don’t want to go to the Burrow just owl Mrs Weasley to tell her you are not going, otherwise you have a room at my house in Leeds. I need some time alone.”</p><p>Harry turned and walked away feeling Severus and Ry’s eyes on his back.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Severus watched Blake walk off down the hallway with a frown.</p><p>“He’s not okay, is he?” Ry said softly, as he turned to Severus.</p><p>“No,” Severus agreed.</p><p>“What did the box really mean?” Ry asked.</p><p>“That you are the Head of the Potter family now,” Severus replied. “He has recognised you as Harry Potter which means that he will need your permission to enter any of the Potter vaults or properties.”</p><p>“But he's still a Potter?” Ry asked softly.</p><p>“Yes,” Severus confirmed. “Did he not explain the way blood and names work in the wizarding world?”</p><p>“Not really,” Ry answered. “But I’m not sure he really knows. Ron has told me more about it than Dad has. He likes to evade those questions.”</p><p>“Perhaps, another thing to slip his mind,” Severus muttered, more to himself than the boy. “He knew what he was doing when he gave you that box, Ry.”</p><p>"He never gave me a straight answer about why, when he took over my guardianship, that my name stayed as Potter," Ry said softly. "He didn't change it to Sun."</p><p>Severus looked the boy over as those green eyes locked on him.</p><p>"The name Harry Potter holds more power in the wizarding world," Severus said softly. "The Potters are a very old family and the Sun name is an unknown family, Blake Sun even more so."</p><p>"Dad mentioned that they were pure bloods," Ry remarked and Severus looked him over as he filed that away.</p><p>"Blake Sun is a name he took Ry," Severus said softly. "He is Harry Potter by birth the same as you. That is who he is regardless of what name he took after and no matter what he says, he is a Potter. That blood was strong enough for him to be the Head of the family until he passed that to you, that is also why no one could challenge him for your guardianship and I am sure there would have been people considering it…You are his son Ry, regardless of your last name."</p><p>Severus and Ry shared a look as he gave the boy a small smile and clapped a hand on his shoulder. Severus's lips twisted up in a smirk and a glint came to his eyes.</p><p>“Now, you have to act like an adult.” Severus sneered. “Do you think you can manage that?”</p><p>Ry drew himself up and glared at the other man with a stubborn tilt to his head.</p><p>“Sure,” Ry snapped. “I’ve already defeated a Dark Lord-"</p><p>“-With Blake’s help,” Severus cut in.</p><p>“And I start Auror training soon,” Ry continued.</p><p>Severus smirked and tapped Ry on the head with the file in his hand and the boy ducked.</p><p>“God help the person that will be teaching you potions,” Severus muttered.</p><p>Ry grinned up at him and Severus looked down at the boy fondly.</p><p>“Maybe I should read more of that file for tips,” Ry said with a smirk. “You know, to prepare myself for what I’m up against.”</p><p>“How about some first-hand experience instead,” Severus growled and pulled his wand.</p><p>Ry yelped and dashed off down the hallway with a laugh as Severus looked after him with a smirk of amusement on his lips.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry eyed off the Hellhounds at the front gates of Dracka’s mansion as they snarled at him with their red eyes flashing in the darkness as they paced up and down the fence line.</p><p>“Blake,” Dracka greeted with a grin as he came closer. “No Severus?”</p><p>“No,” Harry said shortly as a beast snarled at him.</p><p>“Back, back.” Dracka called as he opened his gate for Harry to enter. “Come in.”</p><p>Harry stepped through the gate as the beasts milled around. The animals had never liked him and he had no idea why as he followed Dracka up to the mansion. The hellhounds following behind them, putting Harry on edge even more.</p><p>“So,” Dracka said, moving towards the front door. “Severus called me.”</p><p>Harry groaned and rubbed a hand over his head and swore as Dracka leered.</p><p>“I’m regretting giving you both phones,” Harry grumbled as they walked into the mansion. "And connecting the bloody things."</p><p>Dracka huffed a laugh and clapped a hand to Harry’s shoulder briefly.</p><p>“He’s concerned about you,” Dracka said.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Harry insisted.</p><p>“I can see that,” Dracka replied and gave him a look over.</p><p>Harry tensed under the man’s glaze but knew he couldn’t do anything while in his Coven. Dracka ruled him and he knew where he stood in that pecking order, after the battle with Voldemort.</p><p>“Dracka,” Harry growled and lowered his eyes slightly.</p><p>Dracka stepped back with a frown as his dark eyes watched him.</p><p>“The arrangements are tomorrow,” Dracka said carefully. “Thank you for coming, I know you have been busy at the Ministry and the school.”</p><p>“No problems,” Harry replied and briefly tilted his head before stepping away from Dracka. “Do you have a room I can stay in or am I out the back in the kennels with the hellhounds because I get the feeling they don’t want to share.”</p><p>Dracka barked a laugh and fell into step with Harry as they walked into the main hall. The long tables had been pushed to the side of the room with a few vampires scattered around, they looked up when Harry and Dracka entered. Harry carefully stepped back slightly to let Dracka move one step in front of him and the vampires turned away.</p><p>“Anna will show you your room,” Dracka said as he stopped and turned to the wizard. “You know my second Bradon?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry replied and shook the hand that the short vampire held out. “We have spoken a few times on the phone.”</p><p>“We finally meet,” Bradon said softly, he was about Harry’s height with dark brown hair and brown eyes.</p><p>The woman next to him was a head taller with long straight brown hair and eyes and she gave Harry a smile, showing her fangs slightly. Harry would guess that they were related in some way as he gave her a nod as she stepped forward.</p><p>“Anna,” She introduced.</p><p>“Blake Sun,” Harry replied with a grin before kissing the back of her hand. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>“I’ll show you up to your room,” Anna said with a nod to Dracka.</p><p>“I’ll see you later, Dracka.” Harry said casually but made sure to take one step back before nodding and turning to the woman beside him. “Lead on, my dear.”</p><p>xXx</p><p>Dracka watched Blake leave the room with a frown on his face. Something wasn’t right with the man but he couldn’t put his finger on it.</p><p>“Is everything ready for tomorrow?” Dracka asked his second.</p><p>Bradon was looking after Blake with a frown as well.</p><p>“He's a wizard, right?” The man asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Dracka replied with a grin. “Don’t let the dark magic fool you.”</p><p>“Then why is he acting like a low ranking vampire?” Bradon asked and Dracka stilled.</p><p>That’s what he’d been missing he had been around vampires so much that he hadn’t noticed. From the moment Blake had stepped over the wards he had been giving the same slight messages that a low ranking vampire would have given and he hadn’t even noticed. Blake had never given those signals before, he had always stood with him as an equal. Something had changed to make the man think he was below him in standing, then Dracka frowned, Blake was not a vampire. He shouldn't be thinking in ranking or where he stood in a Coven that he was not a part of.</p><p>“I'm not sure,” Dracka replied. “I didn’t notice.”</p><p>Bradon grinned showing fangs slightly and the two men moved onto the arrangements for tomorrow but Dracka’s mind kept coming back to Blake’s odd behaviour and his phone call with Severus. The wizard had sounded concerned about the other man, which also concerned the vampire. Not to mention the fact that Blake had come alone which threw up more red flags. He'd been expecting Severus to come with him.</p><p>Yes, the man had killed his brother, who had been the Coven leader at the time, but it had been a clean kill. No one in his Coven could dispute that and the fact that they had a treaty with Blake put him on the same standing as Dracka and yet his body language was putting him below that. He knew Blake well and he was aware of what he was doing but he had never shown these signs before.</p><p>Blake had come back to the Coven over the years after he killed Dracka’s brother to reinforce the wards to keep them and the village safe and Dracka did wonder at the time why. He had always watched the man from a far and Blake had never crossed onto the Coven’s grounds without permission and had spoken with some of his Coven over the years. The fluid way that he'd worked with the other vampires had always intrigued him.</p><p>It was a good two hours later when Dracka could pull himself away from the arrangements and made his way up to Blake’s room on the second floor. He had placed the man’s room away from most of the other vampires to give him space.</p><p>He knocked gently on the door but didn’t get an answer and with a frown he pushed the door open to see Blake under the covers and curled up away from him asleep. From what Severus had told him the man had been working long hours since the final battle and it was late in the night but he had expected the man to still be awake at this time.</p><p>He moved over to the bed and looked down at him. He placed his hand on the man’s shoulder and could faintly feel the other man’s magic. He could feel that the man was still recovering as his demon started to take notice. He wasn’t sure if he should wake him or wait until the next day. He could still see the slight mark his fangs had made on the man's throat and his frown deepened. He was missing something here.</p><p>“What do you want, Dracka?” Blake asked softly and opened his eyes.</p><p>Dracka snatched his hand back as if he'd been burnt.</p><p>“Everything is organised for tomorrow,” Dracka said as he took a seat on the bed next to Blake. “We'll lay the bodies out tonight and the cremation will be just after sunset tomorrow. The Aurors cast a status charm for us so that we had time to put everything into place and had the families claim the bodies.”</p><p>“Okay,” Blake replied as he rubbed his face, the blanket slipping off his shoulder and Dracka’s eyes were drawn to the scars there. “Are there going to be other Covens here?”</p><p>“No,” Dracka replied as he pushed his demon down. “Just mine. The other Covens have organised their own.”</p><p>“Alright,” Blake replied. “Do I stand with you or the others?”</p><p>“With me,” Dracka said calmly as he placed a hand on Blake’s bare shoulder.</p><p>Blake started and looked up at him, their eyes locked briefly before Blake turned his head away.</p><p>“Blake?” Dracka questioned lightly. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Why does everyone keep asking me that?” Blake asked as he looked back at Dracka but wouldn’t meet his eye.</p><p>“Because you scared the shit out of us,” Dracka replied with a smirk, that got a reaction and Blake met his eyes. “You almost died, Blake.”</p><p>“So, this is about the treaty?” Blake questioned. “Holding up my end of the deal?”</p><p>Dracka reeled back like he'd been hit as his demon pushed forward roughly. Blake flinched back and looked away, which was unlike him and Dracka's stomach clenched. Something had happened for the man to react like that and he had a feeling he had something to do with it.</p><p>“This is about you,” Dracka snapped. “You idiot.”</p><p>Dracka grew concerned when the other man wouldn’t look at him as he kept his eyes away and his neck slightly exposed. It made the demon in Dracka angry and he had to push down on the feeling and his instincts</p><p>“Would you look at me?” Dracka asked quietly.</p><p>Blake turned his eyes to look at Dracka but wouldn’t make eye contact, which just angered him even more. Blake stood the same as him, he should be able to meet his eyes. He flashed with fangs at him without thinking and Blake tilted his head to the side. The demon in him surged forward and before he could think it through he bit down on Blake’s neck.</p><p>The man didn’t make a noise just tilted his head to the side and went limp under him. Dracka pulled himself back so quickly he fell on his ass on the floor as he looked up at the other man in shock. He swore when he saw and smelt the blood on the air and quickly jumped forward and clapped a hand over the wound.</p><p>“Fuck,” Dracka swore as blood dribbled around his fingers. “Blake I’m sorry. I didn’t. Fuck…”</p><p>Blake just kept his head tilted to the side and his eyes on the floor without moving. Then it clicked in Dracka’s head, he had fed off the man. Had taken his magic and his blood and had not followed it through. In that one act he had placed Blake at the lowest ranking for a vampire and he hadn't even realised. At the time, he hadn't been thinking of Blake as a vampire but a wizard and yet the man had shown time and again that he knew the rules. His demon had known that and had acted instinctively without Dracka's consent.</p><p>Dracka looked down at the blood on his hand and did what he would have done if he were dealing with another vampire of the same standing as him. He pulled Blake up and bit down on the same spot and let the blood fill his month. Blake dug his nails into his shoulder with a gasp. Dracka pulled back after a few seconds and licked the wound, seeing two sets of marks as well as the old mark and Blake stilled. What happened next would prove where Blake stood with him and his Coven.</p><p>Dracka covered the mark with his hand and reached into his magic, dark power coming to him easily and Blake started as he healed the bite marks which he would have done for a vampire of the same rank as him. He pulled back and looked into Blake’s wide green eyes.</p><p>“This is why you didn’t bring Severus?” Dracka asked softly.</p><p>Dracka could tell the man wanted to look away as his eyes become more guarded and closed off.</p><p>“Yes,” Blake confirmed softly.</p><p>Dracka sighed and turned away, exposing his own neck to the other man. If Blake had been a vampire he would have done the same that Dracka had done to him but he didn’t and Dracka ran a hand over his head, as he looked down at the blood on his slightly shaking hand.</p><p>Dracka started when Blake placed his hand on his neck and Dracka looked back at him. Blake just let his hand rest there while Dracka could feel the man’s blood in his stomach, there was none of the man’s magic there and the demon was a bit chaffed at that.</p><p>“You didn’t finish it,” Blake said softly.</p><p>Dracka laughed hollowly.</p><p>“I came bloody close,” Dracka muttered. “That dark magic of yours in intoxicating.”</p><p>Blake gave him a small smile and moved his hand down to Dracka’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze. Just like that the tension eased from both of them, a tension that Dracka wasn’t even aware was there.</p><p>“Maybe when I said you are just as much one of us. I was too right,” Dracka said with a lopsided grin. “You didn’t have the prove it to me though.”</p><p>Blake barked a laugh, his green eyes shining for the first time since before the battle. Dracka felt a little lighter at the sight of that smile, the man still didn't seem himself and he could see the shadows in the man's eyes but the smile proved he was on the right track and he hoped that Severus could help Blake the rest of the way.</p><p>“Jesus,” Dracka swore. “Severus would have killed me if he'd been here.”</p><p>Blake pushed his shoulder.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Blake replied with a grin. “You have been conspiring with Severus behind my back.”</p><p>“That’s called paranoia, Blake.” Dracka pointed out with a laugh.</p><p>Blake flashed him a grin and the tightness in Dracka’s stomach eased at the sight. He rested a hand over where the bite mark would have been, the blood still on his hand, and Blake met his eye easily. They stood on the same standing now, two leaders in what may come.</p><p>“I’ll leave you to your sleep, old man.” Dracka said with a grin. “Don’t want you to be cranky in the morning.”</p><p>Blake laughter eased the rest of the tension in him and he gave him a grin before he made his way out of the man’s room.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry stood calmly next to Dracka as fire licked up the pyre consuming the wood and bodies and turning them to dust. Vampires and other people stood all around him and he ignored the few looks thrown in his direction. He stood equal to Dracka as the fire grew higher and the heat rolled over them. Dracka’s men had fought well and they had died so that Voldemort could be killed and he would honour them the same as he would anyone else that had lost their lives.</p><p>Dracka clapped a hand to his shoulder and gave it a squeeze as the fire crackled and sparks flew as he recognised Harry to the rest of the vampires around. This may not have been what the man had planned when he'd invited Harry along but they both felt better for it. They would stand together for whatever may come and Harry was sure he was going to need him.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry’s eyes watched Bradon as the man slipped out of his shirt and stood in just his long pants as Dracka passed a mug of coffee to him. Harry gave the man a grin in thanks as he sat back in his seat and watched Bradon warm up. The man was of a similar build to him but was all power as he picked up his steel sword and moved into the middle of the room.</p><p>“We're in for a show,” Dracka muttered in his ear.</p><p>Harry couldn’t agree more as a woman stepped forward with her own sword in her hand and with a wide grin on her face.</p><p>“Lee Colden,” Dracka said softly. “Turned vampire.”</p><p>Harry nodded he could see the faintness of the vampire curse around the woman, she had been a muggle before being turned but the curse had had time to soak into her skin over the years. She wouldn't have magic but the dark curse was there.</p><p>“Over a hundred,” Harry muttered back and Dracka started next to him.</p><p>Harry grinned back at him before focusing back on the two as they circled each other. They sized each other up before Bradon lunged forward making Lee dance to the side and they stepped back again to the yells and cheers around them.</p><p>Harry could see the control as the two vampires danced around each other looking for a weakness. Bradon was very good but Lee had better skills and was lighter on her feet. The swords rang out in the room as the two clashed. Lee flicked her sword forward and Bradon jumped back as the woman pushed forward her advantage. Bradon flashed his fangs and smashed his sword into the woman’s in a two handed grip.</p><p>Lee rolled with it and Bradon stumbled slightly off balance and she pushed forward and Bradon was rolling as he dropped his sword. Lee kept pushing forward as Bradon tried to get to his feet but Lee was on him quickly and had her sword pointed at his throat. Bradon tapped the ground and Lee stepped back with a grin and held her hand out to the other vampire.</p><p>“Does it make you want to join in?” Dracka whispered in amusement.</p><p>Harry gave him a grin.</p><p>“Every time,” Harry replied a little wishfully. “I just get reminded every time, that I’m not young anymore and it’s normally when I’m getting smashed to the ground.”</p><p>Dracka barked a laugh as the next two vampires stepped up for a bout.</p><p>“Severus tells me that you have been working with that sword of yours,” Dracka remarked quietly.</p><p>Harry looked away from the vampires to look at Dracka and the man raised an eyebrow in question.</p><p>“I’m sure a fledgling would be happy to take you on,” Dracka said with a smirk.</p><p>“Normally, I would take that challenge.” Harry said softly. “But I’m not up to it at the moment, Dracka.”</p><p>Harry looked away from the vampire, he knew what the other man was trying to do but he was still recovering and he wasn’t up to his normal standard. Dracka laid a hand on his arm and let it slide. They had all the time in the world and there was always another day.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry was starting to feel more like himself as he dissapparated outside his house in Leeds. Being around Dracka and the vampires had really helped, their dark power brushing against him as he walked through the hallways of the mansion or sat with them for meals had helped ease the tension he'd been feeling. Dracka had kept a close eye on him for the first couple of days but Harry was quick to mix in with the vampires. He understood them and the dark power from the hallows had calmed and settled after the whole mess with Ry.</p><p>“Are you coming in?”</p><p>Harry looked up to see Severus standing on his front porch with a beer in his hand as he leaned on the porch railing. Harry soaked up the image of his lover, feeling his heart beat that little faster as he took in the sight. He gave the man a grin as he stepped closer, happy to back home.</p><p>“Do you have one of those for me?” Harry asked as his wards brushed over his skin and he stopped at the railing and looked up at Severus.</p><p>Severus held the beer out to Harry with a smile, his dark eyes looking him over. Harry took it in his hand and took a sip as he moved up the steps to stand in front of the other man.</p><p>“How is Dracka and the vampires?” Severus asked.</p><p>Harry leaned his forearms on the porch railing and looked out at the quiet street, watching as the odd car pass by on the road.</p><p>“They are hurting,” Harry said softly. “They know that it isn’t over and the few Aurors coming and going are also putting them on edge.”</p><p>“From our Ministry?” Severus asked as he leaned next to him.</p><p>He palmed the beer Harry held out and took a sip before passing it back.</p><p>“Yes,” Harry replied. “They have been helping them with moving the bodies back. It could have been worse though. They didn’t attack the Ministry. There's a lot anger at the Ministry.”</p><p>“Against the vampires?” Severus asked in surprise.</p><p>“What?” Harry said, turning to the other man. “No, more for Dark Lord Voldemort’s followers. Dracka has done a lot to put people's minds at ease since he has been working at the school.”</p><p>Harry looked down at the beer in his hand as he leaned on the porch railing. Harry passed the beer to Severus as he rubbed his face, thinking about the mess that Voldemort had made. It was a different mess than before. The death toll may not have been as high but the Ministry was still scrambling to weed out Death Eaters.</p><p>Gentle hands wrapped around his wrists and pulled his hands away and Harry looked up into Severus’s dark eyes. Severus pulled his hands until he stood in front of him and he placed Harry’s hands on his hips as he fell into Severus’s embrace. Taking in the comfort that the man was offering as Severus ran his hands up and down his back.</p><p>Harry started slightly when he felt Severus’s magic run down his back and Severus huffed a laugh in his ear. Harry reached out gently with his magic and grabbed a hold of the magic, feeling the man close to him.  He could feel the connection between them as Severus ran a hand down his back.</p><p>Harry moved his hands under the man’s shirt feeling his soft skin. He had missed the man while he'd been away and he reached across the connection and strengthened it, making Severus gasp.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Severus whispered in his ear.</p><p>Harry shivered at the sound of the man’s voice and pulled back slightly to look up at him.</p><p>“Just strengthened the connection,” Harry said softly.</p><p>“The ring?” Severus asked with a frown.</p><p>“Our connection, Severus.” Harry said with a smirk. “The ring just makes it easier, since your magic is on it.”</p><p>Harry stepped back and slipped the ring off his finger and felt the connection fade slightly, he held the ring up for Severus to see. He then flared the connection between them, he did have to concentrate more to do it, but it was still there.</p><p>Severus’s eye darkened and he grabbed him tightly as he kissed him. Harry lost his grip on the connection as he deepened the kiss. He slipped the ring back onto his finger when they pulled back. Severus grabbed his hand and pulled him towards the front door of the house. Harry grinned as he followed the man into the house and Severus pushed him down onto the lounge. Severus looked down at him with dark eyes before slipping out of his robes and letting them fall to the floor.</p><p>Severus kneeled down between Harry’s legs and slipped his hands under his shirt and pulled his shirt up and over his head. Severus’s hands moved up his sides as Harry settled back on the lounge and watched him.</p><p>Severus ran his fingers along the faint scars on his chest and stomach and Harry shivered at the feeling.</p><p>“I would hate to know how many I would have if it weren’t for magic,” Harry said softly. “Doesn’t help for cuts that have already healed or silver.”</p><p>“Like the ones on your back?” Severus said softly.</p><p>“Yes,” Harry agreed. “The ones that were still fresh, when they found me, could be healed but the rest…”</p><p>Severus moved until he knelt between his legs and kissed one of the faint scars and Harry let his head fall back against the lounge as Severus placed his hands on his thighs. He'd missed this as well as the feel of the man before him, that slight brush of his magic on his skin as his hands touched him.</p><p>“Do you remember each one?” Severus asked as he kissed another one.</p><p>Harry chuckled and looked down at him.</p><p>“Maybe one or two,” Harry said in amusement. “The more recent ones. I think a few of them are from Charmling."</p><p>Harry held out his right arm and looked at the faint scar in the crook of his elbow. Severus took his arm in his and looked up at Harry in question.</p><p>“When Dark Lord Voldemort came to power in my time,” Harry said softly as he remembered green light and staring eyes. “Such a long time ago, one memory is still very clear to me.”</p><p>“When you defeated him?” Severus asked.</p><p>“Ah no,” Harry said. “Everything from that time just kind of moulded together. I had to sit down and try to work through those memories as you know.”</p><p>Severus rubbed his thumb across the scar on Harry’s wrist.</p><p>“Dark Lord Voldemort used my blood in his ritual to gain his body,” Harry said softly and Severus’s thumb paused.</p><p>“Why?” Severus whispered.</p><p>“Ah, that’s a complex answer.” Harry said staring at the scar in the crook of his arm. “I know better now, how blood works in spells and rituals, than I did then. I’m still not sure what he was hoping to archive beyond the ritual but it tied us closer together.”</p><p>“He didn’t use Ry’s blood,” Severus said softly.</p><p>Harry’s eyes hardened.</p><p>“No,” Harry said sharply. “The ritual he used was different. It made him weaker and yet stronger in other ways. His link with Ry was weaker than the connection that I had with him.”</p><p>Severus paled at his words.</p><p>“That was weaker?” Severus whispered.</p><p>“Yes,” Harry confirmed. “I was lucky, I suppose, since he didn’t just kill me in the ritual. That would have boosted his power and cancelled out the prophecy.”</p><p>Severus’s hand clenched around his thigh as he paled even more.</p><p>“For a man that had lived as long as he had,” Harry said softly. “He didn’t know how blood and sacrifice worked…Simpson is a different story.”</p><p>“You know,” Severus said slowly. “I had something different in mind for tonight.”</p><p>Harry snorted as he leaned forward and cupped his hands around the other man’s face and pulled him forward. He gave him a grin before closing the gap in a kiss. Harry looped his legs around Severus and pulled him close as Severus’s hands slipped around his back and under his belt.</p><p>Harry ran his hands through Severus’s hair as the man flicked his belt open and slipped his hands around Harry’s ass. Harry lightly ran his hands down the man’s sides and Severus quickly slipped out of his shirt. Harry’s eyes darkened as he took in the sight, pushing all his other thoughts to the side as the focused on the man in front of him.</p><p>Harry slipped out of his shoes and pants as Severus watched his own eyes darkening before he took Harry’s half hard cock in his hand. Harry sucked in a breath as his head fell back against the lounge as Severus worked on him. It had been a while for them as Harry peered down at the man between his legs.</p><p>Severus got to his feet and unbuckled his pants and let them fall to the floor his dark eyes never leaving Harry’s. He slipped back onto the lounge and settled on Harry’s lap as the other man laid his hands on his hips and pulled him close.</p><p>Severus reached between them and grasped both of their cocks and Harry’s hands tightened around the other man’s hips. Severus leaned forward and kissed his neck and Harry tilted his head to the side as the man licked and nibbled up the side of his neck.</p><p>Harry could feel the pleasure building as he rocked his hips slightly and wrapped his own hand around Severus’s as the man panted in his ear and then he was tipping over the edge with Severus following shortly after. Harry quickly cast a cleaning charm as Severus rested on him as they caught their breaths.</p><p>“Was that more, what you had in mind?” Harry whispered and Severus huffed a laugh.</p>
