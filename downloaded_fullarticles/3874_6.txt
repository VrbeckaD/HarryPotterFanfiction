    <p>)()(</p>
<p>The first thing I truly remember before Hogwarts was Luna and dad working on his magazine. My mother was fuzzy, I had been told that I was the closest to her when the spell backfired. In part I felt that I had caused her death, if I hadn't been so close, she would have been able to move. Luna and I were identical twins, from our hair to our eyebrows pulled back giving us what seemed to be a forever surprised look on our faces. I had been born approximately two minutes after her. That was where the similarities ended. She was forgiving and patient while I could be cruel and often quick to anger. Somehow deep within me I felt it was partly my duty to protect Luna's ability to trust and love nearly anyone, this was especially true when Ravenclaw began to take advantage of Luna's trusting nature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, something kept telling me it was my fault mother died that I could have done something since it had happened, however I also remembered another person there that everyone claims wasn't. I'd lay in bed at night and think about it then run to Luna if a nightmare occurred. Luna never blamed me and had made peace with mum's passing, I could tell dad still missed her. When we were 10, we could hear dad still crying over her. It was heart breaking but after that, it became less and less of a thing.</p>
<p>However the Quibbler became more and more apparent, I kept telling Luna that he'd just replaced the time with something else. I was a skeptic, I knew I had been for ages. He wasn't better, I could tell. They'd often discuss the mystical and often fictional creatures he'd tell the world about in the Quibbler. She always held a resolute belief in the magazine and everything it said. She'd just smile and tell me the same thing she had for years when things were going wrong,</p>
<p>"Ara, even a Heliopath must take time off" I frowned at her as she started to hum and turn back to what she'd been doing. I sat down on the floor next to her. The floor was rockhard and cold but the fire gave off a warm tone to the dark living room.</p>
<p>'Even a Heliopath must take time off'? I pulled my knees up to my chest and tried to remember what that was. Dad kept mentioning it every once in a while to Luna, something about suffering. I laid down on the floor entirely, sprawled out. I laid there for a second and realized that the smell of...radishes and a sweet orange smell was drifting down off the table. I popped back up and looked at the table Luna was leaned over. A row of red radishes and Dirigible plums were lined out according to size, as well as a row of shining silver earring hooks.</p>
<p>"What are those for?" I asked curiously as I leaned closer to watch her skewer one and set it off to the side.</p>
<p>"I'm testing to see if the plums or the radishes keep the pixies away any better. You do know how they love to play with my hair." She said softly as she skewered another.</p>
<p>"Then why so many?" I asked as I took in the entire row.</p>
<p>"Because I enjoy the taste of these so much I find myself continuing to eat them." She replied with a giggle as she held up the plums and radishes, I grinned at her.</p>
<p>I didn't believe as much as she did in our father's publishing but it gave them time to bond together. My father and I grew rather distant after Luna and I were sent to Hogwarts for our educations. He would write in Luna's letters to tell me minor things such as the Wrackspurts had stopped chewing at my mattress and that our room still smelled of rose-hips.</p>
<p>It was only until our fifth year, this year, after the tournament's big blow out. The death of Cedric had still been a rather sore spot for myself. I had fallen only a little in love with the boy. Only a little bit...enough to make my heart hurt to see his lifeless body on the grass. It caused something to break within my chest, like a knife cutting from my heart to hip. Luna knew to avoid the subject well enough though. I often ran to her when my dreams turned ugly like they had every once in a while.</p>
<p>I sat at the Ravenclaw table as per usual, staring at the food surrounding my empty plate. The latest started out like they all do, we're laying next to the lake. I'm curled up into his side as he hums and plays with my hair, stroking it. He was always good at calming me down. He'd keep telling me everything was going to be fine. I was worrying for nothing. Its always right as I believe him that the water starts to bubble furiously until a large black cape comes up to the shore and drags him out of my arms, swallowing him whole with a loud malicious laugh as hes completely gone. Forever. After several minutes Luna leaned over and whispered in my ear.</p>
<p>"Garderplacks in your stomach again?" She asked, I shrugged. She and dad always came up with the oddest creatures to explain things like a lack of hunger or bedbugs. Sometimes even just bullys, in Luna's case. She kept calling the disappearances Nargles when we both knew other Ravenclaws were hiding her things. She patted me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Piece of fruit and some lavender cake will get those right out for you." She placed a handful of grapes on the plate and a slice of the pale lavender coloured cake. I gave her a tired smile as I poked at the cake. She took care of me a lot of times, this happened to be one of those times. I tuned out the noises of forks hitting plates and conversation as I focused on the food. I felt someone sitting next to me, their thigh touching my own and glanced over to see a black curled hair sticking out to the side. Harry.</p>
<p>"Eating something great?" He asked quietly as Luna turned back to her newest issue of the Quibbler, she'd gotten a letter from dad as well but was choosing to read a little first, ever the loyal reader. I shrugged at him too.</p>
<p>"Wow, I can tell you're really interested in conversation today." He stated sarcastically and poked my shoulder. I rolled my eyes and tried to find something to discuss with him.</p>
<p>"Wheres your shadows?" I asked, sounding just as sarcastic. He shrugged this time.</p>
<p>"Dunno. Hermione will find her way here sometime and I think Ron is still asleep. I was about to sic Herm on him but I was merciful." I raised a brow as he nodded to himself. He thought himself a merciful god indeed. I rolled my eyes as he winked and began to fill his plate up with food. Harry and I had a mutual understanding that came with people you love dying. The silence ensued again at the table.</p>
<p>"I wanted to ask how you were dealing with...everything today. Its the first day back anyways and we never got to spend the birthdays together." He said quietly. I sighed and looked around. Other Ravenclaws rarely sat near us, it was simply due to the fact that they'd hidden some of Luna's things again and I'd caught them. The explosive anger came out and the magical side got a little...heated. Many had gone to the hospital wing for minor burns. I felt a weight touch my thigh softly and looked down at the calloused and pale hand. Riding brooms hadn't done him any good cosmetically.</p>
<p>"Hey..." I looked up at him dully, he looked concerned with his bushy eyebrows drawn together so tightly. I raised a brow and tilted as I waited for him to say something.</p>
<p>"You know you can tell me anything, right?" He asked quietly. I had said the same thing when Harry was hit with the trial, he'd owled me about the situation and I ended up visiting with Luna's help. I wasn't the best flyer but it was truly in that moment that I decided he wasn't all that bad. In the years past I had found him to be a little annoying, he always seemed to be at the heart of all the trouble but clueless as to why. It had been the ignorance that bothered me the most and after talking, I found the reason why he was so ignorant.</p>
<p>"Last night was just rough. Thats all." I nodded and gave a sleepy smile. He nodded back in understanding and turned back to his food. I used to think Harry had a crush on me but as time went on til now, I think thats just how he displays familial affections.</p>
<p>"Any interesting classes for you this semester, Ara?" I looked up from destroying the pale purple cake to see Hermione sit down across from us. I guess the Gryffindor trio were just hanging out here for a while. Ron was following her here, he looked as tired as I felt. It took me a second to respond, trying to find words, she raised a brow, waiting.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to Potions quite a bit this year." I stated looking her in the eye with a slight smile as she narrowed hers. I knew it bugged her just a little that I seemed to have a talent for potions and that Snape didn't call me out nearly as much as she did. To be honest, I think it was partly that I just had a bit of talent and that I wasn't in the Gryffindor house...which he seemed to hate with a passion. I just got a kick out of her cheeks turning bright red as she gets angry, my face was pale as snow and rarely showed much expression since Ced died.</p>
<p>"Well! I hap-Bloody hell!" She had begun to speak but was cut off by Ron pointing at the teacher's table and cussing. We all looked up, including Luna who'd been quietly reading. There was a short women with the face of a snarled bulldog she was dressed in all pink...she hadn't aged gracefully to say the least. We all went silent for a bit as Dumbledore stood up for his speech and to introduce the woman. He had begun with a greeting as always and then motioned to her right as she leaned over to talk. All our eyes widened as we looked at one another in shock.</p>
<p>"The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for with out progress there will be stagnation and decay. There again, progress for progress's sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness, and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited." She finished with her name and rank there, like a bunch of students would care. I didn't like her. At all.</p>
<p>Luna distributed an open letter on my lap. I looked over at her and raised a brow. She looked back with a face that looked almost stressed, it worried me.</p>
<p>"Its to do with our upcoming sweet sixteens and the bloodline." She was stated quietly as she looked back at Umbridge. I nodded until I processed "sweet sixteens", what the hell?</p>
<p>"What the hell is a sweet sixteen?" I whispered and she gave me a smile.</p>
<p>"Muggle term for a 16th birthday." She explained patiently to me. I just nodded and looked down at the letter.</p>
<p>Dearest Luna and Ara,</p>
<p>As your 16th birthdays will soon be approaching, I found it necessary to tell you darlings that your blood is in fact all Wizard but also a quarter Veela. This in itself can be a tricky situation and might explain the differences in your wands...or its just the Ragle Nuts messing about again. You do know how they love to distribute one's personal possessions to their friends, Luna.</p>
<p>As I was saying, there is infact only one quarter Veela in the two of you (your late mother was a half Veela). This means that you may or you may not come into some form of revelation on your 16th. If anything it does explain why we're all so pale!</p>
<p>Much love,</p>
<p>Daddy</p>
<p>"What does that even mean?" I whispered to myself as Harry turned his attention, drawing Hermione's as well. He took the letter and began to read. I just sort of continued to play around with my food, thinking to perhaps ask professor Snape if he ever asks for any help in his inventory.</p>
