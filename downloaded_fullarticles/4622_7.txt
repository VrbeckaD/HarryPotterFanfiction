    <p>It had been a normal day for Katrina Malfoy. She took her usual place at the Slytherin table without any trouble. Slytherin was a house she’d had to beg the sorting hat to put her in as the hat seemed very inclined to place her into either Hufflepuff or more so; Gryffindor. She'd only begged the bloody thing so hard in order to stop her parents from disowning her there and then. Either way she'd spent a long few years getting each house to accept her and see that she was in fact a fun-loving and alright human being despite the label of her last name and house.</p><p>Katrina was the non-identical twin to Draco Malfoy and perhaps the nicest and most well-liked Slytherin, although it was fair to say she could be rather nasty when provoked, a side-effect of having Lucius Malfoy as a father. She had the long dark hair of the Black family and the pointed features of the Malfoy’s. She was pretty but had too many off-putting features such as a remotely hooked nose and a dimpled chin to make her anything above just pretty.</p><p>As the over-looked and not nasty enough Malfoy she was free to do as she pleased when she wasn’t under the watchful eye of her parents and the rather dark people they associated with. She was conversing with Daphne Greengrass and filling her plate with pancakes when the doors to the great hall burst open. Filch was standing rather flustered at the doors, his cat screeching in bewilderment at his feet.</p><p>“Children! Children in the halls!” He cried and the Slytherins collectively rolled their eyes. Crazy old man.</p><p>“Why yes,” Dumbledore stood, “I would hope there are children in the halls of Hogwarts. We are a school for children after all?” He was saying this in good nature, but Katrina narrowed her eyes at him. He seemed unsure behind his calm and confident demeanour.</p><p>“No, Professor, babies! There are little children in the halls, asking for their mother and fathers!”</p><p>Whispers broke out in the halls and Draco raised an eyebrow at her over the table. She shrugged at him, looking around the room. She ended up catching the eye of Hermione Granger, one of the last Gryffindor’s to accept her but probably the one Katrina trusted the most, for that reason specifically. They shared an ‘I have no idea what he's talking about' look and turned back to there plates.</p><p>The professors rose from there seat at the head table and one by one followed Filch and Dumbledore out of the Great Hall, leaving the Head teacher of each house to man the children at the breakfast tables.</p><p>The whispering continued. </p><p>"How did babies get in Hogwarts? Who’s babies anyway?” Pansy Parkinson asked.</p><p>“Who knows, but bloody useless parents for letting their infants get into bloody Hogwarts,” Katrina snorted, shaking her head at the prospect.</p><p>The hall quietened as the teachers and Dumbledore returned. With them came four children. The first was a boy of about four or five with a shock of red hair, a girl who looked rather similar stood behind him shyly and seemed to be about four as well, then a boy with dark hair calmly walked in, bright blue eyes searching the hall in a way that made him look older than just five or six. Another taller boy of about six wondered in nervously, glancing at Dumbledore like he might scold them. Quietly Katrina noted he looked remarkably like Harry Potter.</p><p>Everyone tried to peer over each other to get a good look at them. Harry gaped, obviously seeing himself in the last boy too.</p><p>Dumbledore stopped near the entrance of the hall and cleared his throat. He held up a golden pocket watch in his hand for the hall to see.</p><p>“This,” He gestured to the shining object, “is a time turner. A time turner allows the user to go back to a certain time. It appears that these children have gotten their hands on this turner and taken themselves to a time before their own.”</p><p>Everyone in the hall gaped and Katrina found her eyes widening in amazement. She stared at the children along with the rest of the hall.</p><p>“How’d they get into Hogwarts?” An unknown voice called from the Gryffindor table. Dumbledore nodded respectfully as the children grasped each other’s hands, seeming frightened by the eyes on them.</p><p>“From what young James has informed me, a house elf took them as close to Hogwarts as possible where Professor Hagrid happened to be passing by and addressed the problem.” Dumbledore’s eyes landed on Harry Potter and wandered over the red-heads at the Gryffindor table as the children shuffled, the little girl sucking her thumb.</p><p>“Now the direct question is who in this room will conceive these children in the next fifteen years or so.” This would be interesting, Katrina thought to herself.</p><p>Her eyes scanned the children as each peered into the crowd to find the youthful version of their parents. Many students in the crowd and pretty much all of Slytherin, inched away. Half wanted to know what their future children would look like, while others were fearful of the prospect of having to raise a child when they hadn’t even had the fun of making one.</p><p>That’s when the red-haired boy of four latched eyes with her. She knew what was about to happen before the boy even spoke up.</p><p>“Shit.” The word fell out of her mouth and her friends whipped around to face her. Draco stared at her in panic as the red-head tugged on Dumbledore’s long sleeve.</p><p>“Mama?” He cried loudly. His lip was wobbling but he seemed to be attempting to be brave. Dumbledore followed the boys pointed finger and found her shocked face.</p><p>A child. She had a child. And this boy, her boy, had to have a father who was no doubt a red-head? She ran through the list of all of the red-haired men she'd ever met in her head. Most were Weasleys and she prayed silently that at least Ron or Percy Weasley weren’t the father. Maybe she’d meet a gorgeous red-haired Quidditch player and not disappoint her family to the point of disownment? No, that would be too easy.</p><p>Before she knew what was happening she was being called forward, face flushing red. Her legs moved on their own accord and those around her whispered as she shakily stepped away from the table. The boy was toddling towards her, crying as he launched himself at her knees. She barely felt it as she stared down at the boy with mixed emotions and glanced back at her gobsmacked twin. </p><p>"Mama,” The boy sobbed into her robes and her hand absentmindedly landed on his head, running a hand over it softly.</p><p>“Dad!” The Potter lookalike called towards Harry, then glancing at Ginny Weasley, “Mum!”</p><p>The two new parents looked at each other and blushed a deep red, making their way forward to claim their child.</p><p>Katrina's boy climbed his way up her and settled in her arms, face pressed into her neck. She supported him and allowed him to do so. Eyes burned into her and she felt terribly alone, standing with a row of Professors who gave no help. She stood holding the crying boy and felt that deep lonely helplessness that was ever present when she was younger. She hadn't felt it in a long while. 
She swallowed the lump in her throat. Slowly she detached the boy from around her neck and placed him on the ground. Katrina carefully laid her hands on the boys shoulders as Dumbledore fretted over the other children, letting the dark-haired boy tug his beard. She slowly lowered into a crouch, daring herself to talk like her mother would have to her.

<p>“Darling, could you please be brave for me and point out all of the mummies and daddies of your friends for me? Can you do that?” Her voice was hoarse at first, especially as she looked into his eyes. Her eyes. Grey and quick, the Malfoy eyes.</p><p>The boy looked incredibly confused and turned to the scary hall of gaping students. Some were sympathetic and intrigued, some were shocked and judgmental.</p><p>“Mama, wheres did your tummy go? Daddy said the baby’s still ages 'way?” The red-haired boy sniffled, hooking a hand into her robes. The already open mouths of the students and some professors in the hall dropped to an unbelievable stretch. In hearing this the other two unoccupied children latched onto Ginny Weasley who was standing next to a bewildered and amazed Harry.</p><p>“Trina?” Draco asked slowly, eyes opening and closing as if it were an illusion. He had stood and moved halfway across the hall to her.</p><p>“Uncle Draco! Wheres’d my baby brother go from my mummies tummy?” Her chubby child made his way towards Draco, tugging on his robes hopefully.</p><p>Draco looked as though the boy had just set his robes on fire.</p><p>“Uh, um, I-I don’t know?” Draco looked a lot like a fish in that moment. The attention was taken from them as the red-haired little girl unhooked herself from who she had called “Aunt Gin Gin” and took off towards Ron.</p><p>“Papa!” She cried, clambering onto his lap. Ron looked like he was going to faint.</p><p>“Mama!” The girl called to Hermione who gaped and slowly reached out to the girl after a moments hesitation. Thank Goodness she had because as Hermione's hands met the sides of the girls dress, Ron blacked out. He slid off of the bench and hit his head on the ground. Hermione quickly took the girl under the arms and onto her lap before Ron brought the child down with him.</p><p>“Hello Uncles!” The girl cried cheerfully to the shocked Weasley twins, not seeming too bothered by the horrified look on her mother’s face or by her unconscious father who had collapsed under her at hearing he’d had a child with Hermione, seconds ago.</p><p>The twins mouths slowly morphed into grins and they glanced at each other then back at the pretty girl in the pink dress, exclaiming simultaneously, “Hello, Niece!”</p><p>Draco made his way over to Katrina with an accusing look on his face, awkwardly taking her babbling son over with him. Her son’s eyes brightened as they fell on the back of the Weasley’s red heads. Draco and Katrina stared at the now content look on his face. Draco in absolute horror and Katrina with uncertainty.</p><p>Her quick mind came to the conclusion quickly though. She’d had a child with one of the Weasley twins and had another on the way at some point in her future.</p><p>“Daddy!” Her boy squealed taking off towards the twin she recognised as Fred. The laugh fell off his lips and was replaced by something close to fear. He let the boy jump into his slack arms and didn’t retaliate when George laughed at him but also worriedly fanned his brothers face with his hands.</p><p>Ron was slowly righting himself with the help of Dean Thomas, eyeing his daughter wearily, while Hermione’s eyes traced the outline of her red and bushy haired kid. All of the students who had just been exposed as parents were either a sickly pale or a burning embarrassed red.</p><p>Fred’s eyes met Katrina’s and they stared at each other. The hall let out a gasp as if it were the building itself that had made the sound and not the people occupying it. Fred Weasley, the funniest boy in Gryffindor and a known blood-equality supporter and Katrina Malfoy, the light of Slytherin and the daughter of one of the most well-known and notorious death eaters, together? Sure, they seemed civilised with each other, even laughing at each others jokes but <em>lovers</em>? That was unheard of. </p><p>The first question that came into Draco’s mind was<em>; </em>how had his father allowed his sister to run off with that idiot <em>Weasley </em>of all people? The simple answer was: he hadn’t.  It became increasingly clear to him that his sister had obviously betrayed them in the future. This made his confused blood boil.</p><p>The second question that made his blood pressure devastatingly higher was how the hell had such different specimens come together to make a child? The answer was also clear but he did not want to think of <em>that</em>. </p><p>Katrina was in such a daze that she hadn’t even realised that the calm dark-haired boy had claimed Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom as his own parents. A sweet family, she thought absentmindedly when she did actually notice the trio. She knew no one would be thinking that of her own little pairing. She swallowed her fear as Fred Weasley bravely but still obviously unsure, made his way over to her.</p><p>Fred had slipped his son onto his back so that he could piggyback him over to the door and the pair looked undeniably cute. Like a real father and son. She supposed, they were father and son. And she was the woman who had made it so. It suddenly dawned on her that at some point she would have to birth this boy and have sex with Fred bloody Weasley. Outrageous.</p><p>Her face reached a beetroot colour as she looked over at Fred as he stood in front of Dumbledore. Fred in turn looked rather pale and kept looking at her then back at the Gryffindor table. She came to the realisation that he was actually quite solid and attractive, and she could suddenly see how she’d decided to have her way with him. Absently she wondered why she hadn't thought of this before, he was hilarious and brave after all. Probably because she'd been too busy looking at Oliver Wood's ass with Daphne to notice him, she thought. That made one corner of her frowning mouth twitch upward.</p><p>The future parents gathered at the entrance of the hall, the couples glancing at each other awkwardly.</p><p>Slytherin collectively seemed to hiss as one of their own, a significant one at that, was shown to be a blood traitor. Sure, she was technically set to produce two children with a pure-blood, but a Weasley's blood was hardly seen to be pure in there minds.</p><p>Dumbledore slowly led the unfortunate group away with a wave of his hand, leaving behind an equally confused George and Draco, who glanced at each other then back at the silent and shocked hall and back again.</p><p>To break the silence Professor Snape barked at everyone to continue eating in his usual drawl. Slowly but surely the students around the room lifted there dropped cutlery and began eating again, unsure of what they had just witnessed.</p>
