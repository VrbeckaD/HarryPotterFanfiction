    <p>Harry had hoped moving to the States would make this dating thing easier. Sure, she was still famous, and still rich, and still a war hero, but it was a whole different type of famous. It was little witches asking for an autograph and a photo, young adults asking if it was truly safe to return to England, and the elderly trading stories with her of love ones long gone. It was fanmail filtered through security and newspapers held accountable for what they publish.</p><p>It was being invited to no-magi social events because when she moved across the pond, the MCUSA intergraded her life story into the no-magi world. Records that didn't exist before now do, paperwork that proved the no-magi equivalent had happened. It was all so nice and tidy. Until Tony Stark decided to invite the forigen social recluse to one of his parties.</p><p>Harry sighed, dropping her head into her arms as she thought through this newest problem. She didn't really want to go to the party. Stark was notorious for not showing up to these parties of his. Why go if her host won't be there?</p><p>Green eyes glanced to the small monitor on the dining table. If she went she'd have to find a babysitter for Teddy. He was still so small though. What if he got scared? What if he got hurt? What if he needed her and she wasn't there? Harry tried to burry the memories of tiny coffins and hysterical parents. She couldn't leave Teddy alone, it was too dangerous. </p><p>Decision made Harry tossed her invitation into the trash and proceeded to make herself some lunch.</p><p>But it's been months since you've left the penthouse, Harry thought. Eyeing the calendar she rubbed her eyes. She hasn't left the house since Patrick decided to just be friends. He had been a sweet guy, Harry remembered. He was funny, and kind, and worked at the animal shelter. But the one day Ginny couldn't babysit...</p><p>Guys were all the same. A few good dates, but once they meet the baby they disappear. Harry couldn't even begin to count to number of nearly successful relationships that ended when they met Teddy. </p><p>Harry slowly ate her pasta salad as she went through the rest of her mail. Fanmail, newspapers, magazines, Gringotts notice, a letter from IIveromey, Harry tossed the stack across the table. She couldn't distract herself with paperwork, she finished what she had yesterday. She couldn't play with Teddy, he was napping. She couldn't clean, any noise would wake Teddy. She also couldn't listen to music or watch video due to the same. If she used her headphones she might not hear when Teddy woke up. </p><p>Harry wondered if Stark's party would be entertaining.</p>
