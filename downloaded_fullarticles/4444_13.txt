  <u>Detour</u>
</p><p>Five years. Five years since the end of the war. Of course there was an annual ceremony. And of course <strong>he</strong> had to attend this dreaded event. Thank goodness he had convinced the Minister that he felt not capable of presenting a speech. Maybe he hadn´t used the nicest way to worm out of the Ministry´s wishes, but either they wanted him to attend or not and so no speech from him it was.</p><p>Groaning, Harry turned around and peered wearily at the other side of his bed. No, not his bed actually. Their bed. But more often than not he slept alone in the king-size four poster bed. Not that he really minded though. The illusion of a happy relationship had faded anyway with every year passing. To the outerworld they were still the happy couple but inside their own home they barely spoke a word. To be honest Harry had lost track when had been actually the last time they´d <strong>spoken</strong> at all. Most of the time they yelled at each other as soon as they were in view of the other one. Both were frustrated with how their lives had changed and how few of their grand dreams had come true.</p><p>He and Ginny had married one week after her seventeens birthday, only three months after the war and just before Ginny returned to Hogwarts for her final year.</p><p>Molly had been so proud to finally have Harry officially in her family and Hermione too, as she and Ron followed suit and the, back then, excited young couples had celebrated a double wedding.</p><p>But nowadays neither of them was excited anymore and not even remotely happy.</p><p>Shaking his head, Harry dragged himself out of bed and under the shower. This day promised to become bad enough even without the burden his marriage had become.</p><p>Celebrating the dead and his so high praised heroism. The thought alone made him sick.</p><p>After the shower and getting dressed he walked down in the kitchen, scowling darkly.</p><p>“Master Harry,” Kreacher greeted him with a deep bow.</p><p>Harry glanced down and just nodded. The damned elf knew exactly what he wanted, no need to voice it. With a huff he plunged down on a chair as he heard the faint jarring of a key in the lock. Ginny came back after she had stayed the whole night away again.</p><p>Resignation took over. Why was he delaying the inevitable? There was no way they could work this out. Not even with a therapist.</p><p>Harry waited for Ginny to peer around the corner.  </p><p>“Good morning,” he said neutrally and watched her face fall. Surely she hadn´t expected to get caught, not that early.</p><p>“Harry…” she gasped and, descending her gaze to the floor, started to mumble something inaudible.</p><p>“Ginny, there´s no need to find excuses. Really. I have just one question.” Harry waited until Ginny found the courage to look up and meet his eyes. “Do you love him?” That was it. He had said it out loud. She only needed to confirm that there was another man. But he saw her hesitating. So Harry spoke again, “Ginny, we´re married for five years now, but we´re both unhappy. I love you, but if someone would ask me what this love is I had to say that it´s not romantic. You are like a sister and it feels simply wrong to continue this farce, more so because it´s mainly for your mother´s sake.”</p><p>Harry saw the tiniest smile on Ginny´s lips and how she exhaled in something that could only be relief.</p><p>“I was so afraid you´d be angry and we´d just fight again,” Ginny whispered and finally sat down beside him.</p><p>“How could I? You mean too much to me as that I could keep you from being happy. And I take, Dean makes you happy.”</p><p>“God, how do you know?” she breathed, looking warily up at him.</p><p>“I shared a dormitory with him over years. I know this scent that clings on you every time you come home.”</p><p>Ginny´s eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Harry smiled sadly as he pulled her closer and embraced her gently. He stroked her back until she stopped sobbing and sat back to look at him again.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“Yes, I love him.”</p><p>“That´s good. Than you will probably not mind to sign these.” Harry slid a stack of papers over to Ginny. “Divorce-papers. You just need to sign here, here and here.” He pointed with every here on a line. It was oddly satisfying to see Ginny affix her signature.</p><p>“Mom´s going to kill us.” Ginny breathed a shaky chuckle as she put the quill aside.</p><p>“Oh I´m afraid not only us.”</p><p>Because that was the sad truth. Ron and Hermione had made the same step after acknowledging that they liked each other more when they were just friends.</p><p>“They did it too then?”</p><p>“Last week. Yes.”</p><p>After that the two spoke not much anymore. Ginny fire-called Dean and packed a few things before she kissed Harry on the cheek.</p><p>“Are you sure I should not come with you?”</p><p>“Yes, Ron and Hermione will be there. You go and enjoy your union with Dean.” He smiled honestly and shoved her towards the fireplace. With a last shooing motion he made her step into the green flames and she was gone.</p><p>Harry turned one time around himself. Finally he could leave this house, which had never felt like home. With a last glance he disapparated to Ron and Hermione.</p><p align="center">&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; </p><p>
  <em>
    <u>Three months later</u>
  </em>
</p><p>Harry looked confused around. Heavens where was he? He´d thought he knew Diagon Alley but somehow he´d found a place he´d never been before and just to make it worse he was not entirely sober and didn´t dare to apparate in fear to splinch himself.</p><p>The world swayed and twisted slightly around him and he took hold on a wall to not fall head first down the two steps that suddenly appeared right before him.</p><p>“Hmpf…” Harry huffed as someone behind him grabbed his shoulder and steadied him against the wall he had intended to get hold on a second earlier.</p><p>“Careful,” a smooth voice said.</p><p>Smooth and rich, like a good old scotch. Harry chuckled at this thought. But somewhere in his foggy mind the voice retrieved memories. It sounded awful familiar but he had no idea why. Blearily he looked up. He sobered immediately as he gazed in the sarcastic glare of Severus Snape. He hadn´t seen the man since the day Madam Pomfrey had granted Harry five minutes to speak with the Professor. It had been a week after the battle at Hogwarts and the first time Snape had woken up at all. It had been five very short minutes then with Harry stumbling over the words he so desperately wanted to say. But in the end he had managed to thank Snape for everything and to apologise for having been this troublesome git during his school time.</p><p>Snape hadn´t said much, what was anyway difficult with his throat still perforated by this damned snake´s bite, but he´d managed to assure Harry they were even now and there was nothing Harry had to apologise for.  </p><p>“P-P-Professor,” Harry gasped and was sure to see for a brief moment equal surprise flicker through those dark eyes before him.</p><p>“Potter,” Snape snarled. “What a joy to find the saviour of our world drunk in a place like this.” He waved his hand around in a circle. “You should be glad no journalist ever dares to come down here. Otherwise they´d have a field day.”</p><p>Harry swallowed and was not sure what to make of this comment.</p><p>“Er…”</p><p>“I see, eloquent as ever,” Snape said and added with an arched eyebrow, “Care to explain what you´re doing here? Besides the obvious attempt to break your neck.”</p><p>“To be honest, I was on my way home and…ah…eh…I have no idea where I am,” Harry muttered sheepishly.</p><p>Black eyes bored into him and just as Harry thought Snape would make another snappy comment the other man broke out in deep, hoarsely laughter.</p><p>“Getting lost and landing in places they had not planned to be, that is so typical Gryffindor,” Snape said as he stopped laughing. “Come on then, let me save our great Saviour.”</p><p>Snape put a surprisingly warm hand on Harry´s back and guided him away.</p><p>After leaving the dim alley Harry cleare his throat. “Eh, sir? Where exactly are we?” He looked around, utterly confused that he couldn´t recognise anything.</p><p>“You´re really unaware, aren´t you?” Snape chuckled lowly.</p><p>To say that Harry was startled was an understatement, really. Snape laughing and chuckling? He must be in bigger trouble than assumed.</p><p>“Please, Professor, just tell me.”</p><p>“Drop that. I´m not your Professor anymore. And you are in the “man´s district” of Diagon Alley.”</p><p>“Man´s district,” Harry parroted without knowing what that meant.</p><p>“Oh for Salazar´s sake, Potter! You stood right in front of a gay pub. A really cheap one, if you allow my opinion.”</p><p>Harry stopped rooted to the spot and gawped open mouthed at Snape.</p><p>“I…Er…Oh…”</p><p>Snape´s arched eyebrow was back and all of a sudden Harry felt like the fifteen year old again who had said something stupid in Potions class. What, to be fair, was most of the time.</p><p>“So, you…?” Harry trailed off, eyes scurrying over the surrounding buildings. Well, it were indeed pubs with such colourful names as “The Cock Tavern” or “The Big Blow”.</p><p>“So, I what?” Snape inquired calmy.</p><p>“You are gay…sir?” The sir came more as an afterthought and it sounded definitively wrong in this context.</p><p>“Potter, your unbelievable keen perception never ceases to disappoint me,” Snape drawled but an amused expression settled around his lips.</p><p>Harry bit his bottom lip while he tried to wrap his mind around this new information. And interestingly enough something like wriggling nervousness settled into his stomach. He felt himself blushing and quickly lowered his gaze to the ground.</p><p>“Oh my, Potter, does this information make you uncomfortable?” Snape mocked him lightly and Harry couldn´t help thinking if the man was similar infused with alcohol as him. What would explain his, in Harry´s eyes, strange and so out of character behaviour.</p><p>“I hear there´s need to congratulate,” the older wizard changed suddenly the topic.</p><p>Confused Harry looked up.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Misses Potter, née Weasley is expecting, isn´t she?”</p><p>“What?...Oh…no, no, it´s…eh, well.” Frustrated Harry shook his head harshly and hissed to himself. After he cleared his throat he started all over again. “It´s Mrs Thomas now and it´s Dean´s child.”</p><p>“Indeed?” Snape peered with a strange look down his crooked nose.</p><p>“Yes. We´re divorced for three months now. We weren´t happy. To be honest it was a big mistake to marry so soon after everything that happened. We should´ve waited and maybe we´d seen back then that it wouldn´t work,” Harry babbled and raked one hand through his shaggy hair.</p><p>“Some things become clearer only over the course of time,” Snape stated mystically and regarded Harry still with this strange look.</p><p>Harry frowned and noticed that they´d entered a brighter illuminated area which was however still unfamiliar to him.</p><p>“Are you trying to say anything in particular, sir?”</p><p>“It´s Severus. School is long behind you and I feel you know enough about me to call me by my first name, Potter.” </p><p>“I guess I know a few things.” Harry smiled shyly as he remembered the memories Snape had given him after he had found him severely wounded. “But then it´s Harry for you too,” he insisted.</p><p>“Fine, Harry,” Snape said slowly as if to get used to saying this name. He regarded Harry for a moment with a pensive look then glanced at a small, silver pocket watch and frowned. “Will you find your way home from here? I have another…appointment.”</p><p>“Appointment?” Harry asked pointedly and didn´t care to hide what he thought this appointment would be.</p><p>“Not what you think, but yes.”</p><p>“Hmmm.” Harry lifted sceptically an eyebrow. “And no, I have still no idea where I am.”</p><p>“Would the Leaky Cauldron help your defective memory?” Snape appeared to be quite in a hurry now after he´d checked the time.</p><p>“Yes, it would. You can just point me the direction. I will find it then.”</p><p>“Oh no, I won´t be to blame for you getting lost again and remembering your talent to get into trouble I think it´s saver to escort you.” Snape indicated with a nod of is head for Harry to get hold on his arm and as soon as Harry did he apparated them into the wizards pub in Diagon Alley.</p><p>Stumbling a bit, Harry let go of Snape´s arm and looked up.</p><p>“You could´ve done so as you found me.”</p><p>“And missing our amusing conversation?” Without waiting for a reply, Snape disapparated and left Harry behind, wondering about this odd encounter.</p><p align="center">&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; </p><p>One week later a knock on the front door interrupted the lunch of Ron, Hermione and Harry. They looked at each other. No one expected a visitor.</p><p>“Professor!” Harry opened the door wide and stepped aside to let Professor McGonagall in.</p><p>“Good to see you three.” She smiled warmly and took readily the offered chair and cup of tea.</p><p>After exchanging the usual pleasantries and chatting a bit about what they were doing currently Professor McGonagall came finally around why she came here.</p><p>“You´re wondering why I´m here, I guess.”</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>“Well, it´s simple. The new term starts in three weeks and there are still two open positions. And yes, I´m aware that this is a bit short-dated.”</p><p>“Which positions, Professor?” Harry asked surprisingly eager.</p><p>“Well, the first time in three years Defence against the Dark Arts again and I will finally give up my efforts in managing to be headmistress and teacher at the same time, so the second position will be Transfigurations.”</p><p>“Hey, that would be great. You´re at Hogwarts and I´ll work in the second Weasley shop in Hogsmeade and with Charlie, Oliver and Neville in Hogwarts too…Blimey, that´s bloody brilliant!” Ron cheered but stopped immediately as he looked at Professor McGonagall.</p><p>Harry´s thoughts ran wild. Ron had definitely a point. With Charlie teaching Care for magical Creatures and his husband Oliver teaching Charms it would be quite like a family meeting. And of course Neville was family too.</p><p>And Harry would see Snape again. The strange but by now familiar squirming feeling settled in his stomach.</p><p>Some of his thoughts had had to be visible on his face because Professor McGonagall took the word again.</p><p>“So, Harry, you look like you´ve already made a decision in my favour.” She smiled lightly.</p><p>“To be true, I´d love to come back home.”</p><p>“Yeah. Me too.” Hermione smiled with tears in her eyes. “It was never really home somewhere away from Hogwarts, was it?”</p><p>Harry took gently her hand in his and nodded.</p><p>“I´m glad to hear this and I´m sure Professor Snape as well.”</p><p>“Professor Snape?” Harry spluttered, blushing against his will.</p><p>“Yes, of course. He was the one who suggested asking you.”</p><p>His friends glanced secretly over to Harry. Of course he had told them about this strange meeting with their former Professor and they´d talked a lot of the fact that Snape had revealed himself as gay. A thought that wouldn´t stop rummaging through Harry´s mind and stirred something up in him he was not quite sure what to make of.</p><p>“And how will we proceed now?” Hermione asked as she noticed how Harry´s thoughts went somewhere else again, like so often the last week.</p><p>“I´ll leave your work contracts. Read them and send them back signed. If you, for whatever reason, not agree with something write a note and what you want to change and I´ll see what I can do.” She handed them two identical sets of stacked paper and rose. “During the last two weeks of the holidays staff returns to Hogwarts and we have meetings about administrative things. As you will be new to teaching this year I think it would be good to come as well, also you need to settle into your quarters.”</p><p>After Professor McGonagall had left the three friends sat a moment in absolute silence. Each of them absorbed in their own thoughts.</p><p align="center">&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; </p><p>“Harry!”</p><p>Harry turned around and nearly stumbled over his own feet as he saw Snape in his full glory, black robes billowing furiously behind him as he rushed over to him.</p><p>“Pro…Eh, Severus.” Harry noticed the smirk as he corrected the address.</p><p>“You will get used to it now that we´re colleagues.” Snape smirked now openly.</p><p>“Yeah…I guess, I will. And, thank you. I hear without you Minerva wouldn´t have offered the job.”</p><p>“At least now it´s for sure that someone qualified teaches these learning resistant little twits.” Severus shook his head in a way that said clearly “You will see what I mean”.</p><p>“Uhm, thank you?”</p><p>“Oh no, don´t. You have no idea what I brought over you.”</p><p>Harry chuckled and glanced sideways.</p><p>“So, I guess you found your way home in the end?” Severus smirked yet again and Harry adopted a rather abashed expression.</p><p>“I did…But there is one thing I think about the whole time,” he said and halted.</p><p>“And what would that be?”</p><p>“You said that some things become clearer only over the course of time. What did you mean?”</p><p>To Harry´s surprise Snape sighed and buried his hands in the pockets of his jacket.</p><p>“You don´t have to answer if you don´t want to.”</p><p>“Very considerate from you.” Snape sneered but his expression changed quickly again to serious. “It´s not that I don´t want to answer you, it´s just that it might take a bit of time to explain it.”</p><p>“Ah…” Harry tried to say it as if he had at least the slightest idea what Snape talked about, but he could say that he failed miserably as Snape laughed again.</p><p>“Let´s for the moment just say that I was not unhappy to meet you after all those years.”</p><p>“Really? I always thought you hate me. Even after our last conversation in the infirmary I was sure that that hadn´t changed.”</p><p>“Harry, I never hated you. You caused more trouble in my life than I cared for and I would lie if I´d say I liked you back then but rest assured I never hated you.”</p><p>“And now?” He was not entirely sure why he asked that but it was too late to take it back anyway.</p><p>“I still don´t hate you.”</p><p>“Very funny,” Harry scoffed but chuckled as Snape winked.</p><p>“I think we will have enough time to find out if we like each other in the end after all. But, shall we? Minerva is not overly fond of tardiness.”</p><p>“I remember that.” Harry giggled lowly and more relaxed than he´d ever thought he would be in Snape´s presence they walked together to the staffroom.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>At the end of the day Harry had an entirely new appreciation for his former Professors and the knowing look Snape gave him let even the last bit of joy over his new job disappear.</p><p>“Good gracious!” He sighed exasperated as they sat down in the Great Hall for dinner, what was somewhat strange not only because he sat at the Head Table but also because there were no students to fill the hall with chatter and laughter. “Is that always that exhausting?”</p><p>“Wait until the students are back.” Charlie grinned at his right side.</p><p>“I don´t know what you want, Harry, it was fascinating to see what all happens behind the actual teaching, wasn´t it?” Hermione beamed. A few heads turned towards her and some pitying looks wavered in Hermione´s direction.</p><p>“You will see soon enough that it loses its appeal over the years, Miss Granger,” Snape said smoothly and with twitching lips.</p><p>Harry knew he stared bluntly but as Snape – no Severus he corrected his mind – had started speaking he couldn´t help but watch him. Had he always smiled that much? Or was it just now? His lips were quite thin but looked unbelievable soft. If they were soft? Would they taste sweet? Probably not. Most likely spicy or like herbs. Or cinnamon. Harry thought he had noticed a light cinnamon scent around Snape.</p><p>Harry started about his thoughts. Blimey what was he thinking? Severus preferred man, ok. But Harry didn´t. He´d been married to a woman for Merlin´s sake. But it was confusing as hell especially when he thought about their conversation earlier this day. Severus didn´t hate him and he was willing to find out if they liked each other. Was he implying something in particular or…</p><p>“Harry!” Charlie nudged him not particularly soft in the side.</p><p>Suddenly aware that he was still staring, Harry snapped out of his thoughts and felt all eyes on him.</p><p>“Sorry, my thoughts were somewhere else. And I´m really exhausted. Good night everyone.” Hastily he stood up and hurried out of sight. In the safety of his own quarters, he locked the door and slid down, leaning against it. Blimey what was wrong with his thoughts?</p><p>A sharp knock startled him once again out of his reverie. Scrambling into a standing position he opened and looked in Hermione´s worried face.</p><p>“You´re all right?”</p><p>Harry inhaled to answer but had no idea what to say so he blew the air out and turned to flop down on his couch.</p><p>“You were staring at him.” Hermione joined him. Her gaze nearly as penetrating as Dumbledore´s had been.</p><p>“I know…But I don´t know why. Really. I have a strange feeling every time I see him.”</p><p>“Don´t get me wrong but have you ever considered that you and Ginny weren´t happy not because you actually didn´t love her romantically but because you don´t like woman in general?”</p><p>“Are you implying that I´m gay?” Harry couldn´t help but feel offended.</p><p>“Well…What about Cho? You said kissing her was strange…What if it wasn´t because it was your first kiss but because she was a girl? And you and Ginny, you haven´t kissed often and let´s not start with sex. Oh don´t look like that, you said it yourself. Remember?”</p><p>Oh yes, he remembered this conversation quite vividly and especially how embarrassing it had been. But Hermione had a point. He had been in the past not really fond of kissing and the few times he couldn´t find an excuse (sad as it was) for sleeping with Ginny the sex wasn´t something world changing. Actually he had thought often why people did it anyway except for children.</p><p>Hermione must´ve sensed his train of thoughts as her smile became smug.</p><p>“Maybe you should explore the male population more thoroughly or one male in particular. I think he wouldn´t mind.”</p><p>“What do you mean with that?”</p><p>“Oh, I just noticed how he gazed at to you during the whole day, repeatedly…Like every few minutes or so. Though of course he tried to do it subtly.” Hermione shrugged. “Good night, Harry.”</p><p align="center">&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; </p><p>During the following days Harry had not enough time for further investigations of his sexuality as the meetings ate away most of the days and in the evenings he felt so exhausted that he just collapsed on his bed and slept till the next morning. But the weekend was free and Charlie had asked him for a game of Quidditch, two against two with him, Neville and Oliver.</p><p>After the match he walked up to Charlie, having thought about it the whole time.</p><p>“Hey, can I talk with you later?”</p><p>Charlie looked surprised but nodded. They arranged to meet in Harry´s quarters after showering and a snack.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“So, what is it? You looked quite troubled earlier,” Charlie started as soon as Harry had closed the door behind him.</p><p>Harry peered reluctant at the other man before he sat down with a sigh.</p><p>“How did you know you prefer man?” he blurted and watched how Charlie´s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>“Why do you want to know?”</p><p>“I…” Harry waved helplessly his hands.</p><p>Charlie frowned briefly then said, “Well. I never thought girls attractive. To be honest boys neither. Mom was worried I would never find someone besides the dragons.” Charlie chuckled lowly. “But then I met this guy. About 15 years older than me and gay as hell. He kissed me and after that I just knew I would never kiss a girl and feel the same. I mean I tried just to be really sure but I was right. And yeah, so I found out.”</p><p>“Hmmm…I don´t think I can just walk over and kiss him to find out,” Harry thought out loud and noticed his mistake too late.</p><p>“Go to whom?” Charlie asked eagerly.</p><p>Harry blushed furiously and just to distract him from the topic he asked, “Would you kiss me?”</p><p>“Would I…? Harry, I´m married!”</p><p>“Yeah, sorry.” Harry shrugged and slid down in his armchair. How the hell should he find out if he liked kissing men?</p><p>“So you like someone here in Hogwarts.” It was definitely no question and Charlie had a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. “Oli and I are out. Neville too, as he´s with Hannah. Or do you like someone you can´t have?”</p><p>“No…I don´t even know if I like him at all,” Harry muttered and made just the next mistake.</p><p>“So how many single men do we have?” Charlie asked thoughtfully. Suddenly his grin dropped. “Severus?”</p><p>Harry said nothing but with the growing pink tint to his cheeks he hadn´t to say anything.</p><p>Speechless Charlie´s expression changed between amusement, pity and disbelief.</p><p>“Charlie…I don´t even know if I like men but I know that my experiences with women were not particular grand.” Harry didn´t look at the other man and was completely caught off guard when Charlie sat suddenly on his armrest. In one smooth movement he cupped Harry´s face and dipped down. Their lips met. Harry´s eyes closed on their own will. Whatever had missed with Cho and Ginny it was something Charlie was able to offer. Far too soon for Harry´s liking Charlie pulled away and looked expectantly down.</p><p>“I…” Harry swallowed and licked over his lips. “Wow.”</p><p>“I swear, if you ever tell Oliver I will hex you,” Charlie muttered but then he grinned. “I take your stammering as approval tough.”</p><p>“God, yes…Actually I have to thank Hermione for pointing out that I might prefer men and just haven´t realised yet.”</p><p>“Hm, and so now that you know that, will you go and try your luck with our dearest Potions Master?”</p><p>Deflated Harry fell back into his armchair.</p><p>“I have no idea.”</p><p align="center">&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; </p><p>The “no idea” transformed under the careful watch of Hermione and occasional additions from Charlie, Oliver and Neville, all of whom knew about the problem after the weekend, into a specific plan. </p><p>But first of all the new school year started and it was surprisingly hard work to teach hormonal adolescents. Even Hermione had to admit that teaching sounded great but doing it differed significantly.</p><p>The first weeks were hectically but at the end of September Harry thought he´d found a way that worked for him. He organised his correcting and marking, with a little help from Hermione-organising-talent-Granger, so that he had even a bit time for himself every evening, except patrol nights of course. Although even patrol nights were not that hard with the marauders map still in his possession.</p><p>Except for meals Harry hadn´t seen much from Severus and there it happened only a few times they sat next to each other and had the chance to talk. That was why Harry felt extraordinary nervous as he walked on Friday after his last class down to the dungeons and waited until Severus´ students had left. He knocked timidly on the doorframe and poked his head in the room.</p><p>“Harry…” Severus said surprised.</p><p>“Hi.” Harry tried hard not to fidget with his robes while he walked up to the teacher´s desk. Loads of memories, all of them not quite pleasant ones, bubbled up in his mind and briefly distracted him from his actual task.</p><p>“What can I do for you?” Severus bent down and picked some stray pieces of parchment up before he straightened and gazed at Harry.</p><p>Harry rubbed the nape of his neck, feeling more insecure than he thought appropriate for his age. A tiny voice inside his head laughed at him but a louder voice that had a disturbing resemblance to Hermione´s told him to get his shit together and say something.</p><p>“I…Eh…Iwanttoaskifyou´dliketogotoHogsmeadewithmetomorrow,” Harry sputtered and hated his traitorous body for blushing again.</p><p>“I beg your pardon?” Severus furrowed his brows in an amused expression.</p><p>Harry rubbed over his face and groaned. Why was that so difficult? He breathed once deeply in and out.</p><p>“I want to ask if you´d like to go to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow,” Harry repeated himself and added this time, “We could have a drink in the Three Broomsticks or something like that.”</p><p>“Are you asking me for a date?”</p><p>Harry´s slowly normalising pulse sped up again and the colour returned to his cheeks as words seemed to simply disappear from his mind. With slightly opened mouth he nodded and shrugged at the same time.</p><p>Severus stepped closer and laid his hand softly against Harry´s hot cheek.</p><p>“I´d like that.”</p><p align="center">&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; </p><p>Their date was rather successful. Harry had never thought to feel so comfortable in Severus´ presence but now he did. It was easy to talk to him at least after the first relaxing drink. It seemed as if Severus had thought a lot about Harry over the years after the war. Anyway he confirmed that he indeed never hated Harry and was by now rather intrigued by the man he had become.</p><p>As they returned for dinner to Hogwarts they both showed a smile that inspired more than anything else the gossip to blossom. But Harry and Severus simply shrugged it off and continued to get to know each other with follow-up dates, agreeing to take it slowly.</p><p>However, when even the New Year already had begun without that anything more than the briefest of touches had happened between them, Harry grew frustrated with their situation.</p><p>“What is it, mate?” Charlie asked worried as he noticed Harry´s morose expression while everyone else laughed. It was Severus´ birthday and though he liked it usually more private his colleagues, with more than a little help from Harry, had coaxed him into a small party in the staffroom.</p><p>“We had about ten dates over the last months and never ever happens anything more than a friendly handshake. I feel pranked.” Harry pouted. “I go to bed.”</p><p>“Harry, don´t be silly. Have you even talked with Severus about it?”</p><p>Gruntingly Harry shook his head.</p><p>Charlie´s brow raised in disbelief. “And how should anything change when you don´t tell him that you want more?”</p><p>Harry huffed, glancing across the room at Severus.</p><p>“Honestly, mate, it´s obvious that Severus is waiting for you to make the first step. So either you talk to him or you seize the initiative.”</p><p>Harry pursed his lips. Maybe that was why Severus was so awkwardly reserved? Was he waiting for him?</p><p>Harry gazed again through the room to were Severus stood, now chatting with Professor Vectra.</p><p>Fine, then he should quickly pluck up his famous Gryffindor courage.</p><p>Harry turned towards the buffet and replaced his butterbeer with a Firewhiskey. Swallowing the burning drink, he nodded to himself.</p><p>Still his legs were a little wobbly when he stalked through the room and without further warning grabbed Severus by the damned high-necked collar and pulled him down. Their lips crashed together. Severus opened surprised his mouth and Harry took at once advantage of it. His tongue slipped easily into wet heat. Severus tasted like the wine he´d sipped the whole evening.</p><p>Harry felt dizzy and positively aroused as he finally drew away but just far enough to look into Severus´ face. He saw him swallow and then softened his expression and a tender smile spread over his features. Two strong but delicate and so surprisingly soft hands came up to cup his face.</p><p>“Finally. I feared you would never come out of your safety zone,” Severus whispered and breathed another kiss on Harry´s lips.</p><p>Soft giggles sounded all around them and Harry got suddenly aware that they were nowhere near alone. Blushing he cleared his throat and stepped away.</p><p>“Oi! Stop smirking like that!” He glared at Severus. And then he took his hand and started walking. “You´re done with partying!”</p><p>The whole way to Harry´s quarters Severus let Harry drag him through the castle and said no word at all. But just in the room he used the advantage of their height difference and spun Harry around to pin him against the closed door.</p><p>“I know you wanted to kiss me already after our first date. And I would´ve never said no but I wanted you to make the first step. I wanted you to be sure about what you want,” Severus said hoarsely into Harry´s ear and made the younger man shudder.</p><p>“I´m more than sure what I want.”</p><p>“Indeed?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry growled and started unbuttoning his own shirt. He was already split-naked as Severus had only managed to get rid of his robes and jacket.</p><p>“Damn those buttons,” Harry muttered. More than impatient he grabbed Severus´ collar and yanked the shirt open, buttons spilling over the floor. Immediately his hands descended to the tight, black slacks when a thought struck him. Grinning, he opened his hand, eyes flashing satisfied when his wand slapped into his palm. With a quick flick of his wrist he banished Severus´ clothes completely.</p><p>Severus smirked. “Very good idea, Potter.”</p><p>“Harry,” Harry growled.</p><p>Severus bent forward, his lips brushing against Harry´s ear when he whispered, “Harry.”</p><p>Harry quivered delicately.</p><p>“Your voice will drive me crazy one day.”</p><p>Harry moaned softly when Severus nibbled along his jaw-line then down his throat and further down until he had to kneel in front of Harry to kiss a path down over his stomach.</p><p>Harry buried both hands in Severus´ hair, trying desperately to find hold against the whirling emotions and swoon that threatened to overwhelm him, drown him completely when Severus liced hotly along his jerking erection.</p><p>“Harry. Should I stop?” Severus sounded worried.</p><p>“No,” Harry breathed and willed his eyes open. The sight was breath-taking on its own: Severus on his knees, gazing up at him, hair messy and eyes full of concern but mingled with unveiled lust.</p><p>Harry swallowed heavily and joined Severus on the floor, wrapping his arms around the thin body of the other man and held on tight.</p><p>Severus captured Harry´s mouth in a sweet reassuring kiss that, however, quickly turned into a wild battle of lips, tongues and teeth.</p><p>“Harry…” Severus groaned, his hands flexing on Harry´s hips, and Harry knew exactly what he meant.  </p><p>“Yes, yes. I want you.”</p><p>They stumbled into the bedroom and fell on the bed, only breaking their kiss when Harry turned to his nightstand. From the upmost drawer he procured a small jar with lubricant.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Severus asked. He stroked gently over Harry´s thighs.</p><p>Though it was embarrassing to lay naked in front of someone and being scrutinized the way Severus did it, Harry nodded anyway. He´d had enough time to think about it and he was sure, this here was what he wanted, what he had wanted, maybe all along his whole life.</p><p>“I could look at you for hours,” Severus whispered and bent forward to kiss him. Many little fluttery kisses until Harry smiled against his lips.</p><p>Suddenly a cool finger pressed at Harry´s puckering hole. He swallowed involuntarily and tried to relax at the foreign touch.</p><p>“Tell when I have to stop,” Severus said seriously, circling his finger around the entrance, smearing lubricant at it.</p><p>Harry shook his head. “Don’t stop. I want you.” His heart raced in a speed he was sure he´d die from a heart attack if it wouldn´t slow down.</p><p>And then the slender finger that had teased him slowly pressed into him and his breath hitched. Reflexively he clenched round the intruder but Severus quickly kissed him again.</p><p> “Relax,” he said against Harry´s lips and slowly moved his finger.</p><p>Severus was ever so gently and after the first moments of unease Harry relaxed. As the second finger joined the first he tensed again but then Severus brushed over a spot in him that made him gasp. His eyes flew open and he saw the satisfied smirk on Severus´ face. He pushed his fingers in again and stroked over the same spot. Harry moaned and with every stroke and push fell more into bliss.</p><p>His cock throbbed and he didn´t care if he was prepared enough or not.</p><p>“Severus, now, please.”</p><p>“God, you have no idea for how long I already want this,” Severus rasped and massaged more lubricant over his own cock before he aligned himself with Harry´s ready entrance.</p><p>“Come on. Don´t wait. Do it.” Harry babbled and moaned loudly as Severus complied. It was different than the fingers. So much more fuller. But also so much better.</p><p>Harry wrapped his legs around Severus and pulled him as close as possible. Feeling his hard cock deep in him made his own cock, trapped between their bodies, throb more forcefully.</p><p>Severus groaned and started to rock slowly in and out. But Harry encouraged him to go faster and soon the room was filled with their moans and skin slapping against skin. Severus leant back and gripped Harry´s hip in a bruising grip while the other hand took his cock and pumped it in fast, feverish strokes.</p><p>Harry felt how fast his orgasm built up and he had just time to pant Severus´ name before it crashed over him and his release spurted over his chest and Severus´ hand. He felt himself clench around Severus.</p><p>Severus groaned and his grip on Harry´s hip got even firmer as he buried himself as deep as possible into the tight heat and emptied his load with a cry of pleasure into it. Exhausted he sagged against his young lover and relished in the slow and almost languid kiss they shared as the last spikes of their arousal subdued.</p><p>“Thank you,” Harry whispered as he rubbed soothingly over Severus´ back.</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“For saving me from getting permanently lost. It seems it´s your destiny to keep me save.” A low chuckle escaped the young man.</p><p>Severus pushed himself up a bit to look in Harry´s eyes.</p><p>“Thank you for letting me,” he said seriously.</p><p>Harry smiled as he pulled Severus close again. He knew he had finally found his way to happiness even though it had taken him many years of wrong tracks and detours.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
