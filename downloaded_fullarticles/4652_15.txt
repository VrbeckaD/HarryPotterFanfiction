</p><p> </p><p>“Perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Churr</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry stirred out of his unconscious state, woken up by the sound of a camera and a smooth silky deep voice. He let out a groan of pain. His head throbbing from being drugged. His limbs were numb and filled with prickling needles. His neck sore from being in an awkward position for too long. The teenage boy slowly opened his bright emerald green eyes, his mind blank, unable to think, and numb like his limbs. Harry tried to figure out where he was, but he could only see his hands. He tried to move them, but his wrists pressed together by silver duck tape. Everything else was out of focus, meaning his glasses were off of his face.</p><p> </p><p>“This angle right here highlights your purity…” The voice from earlier spoke again, another clicking sound of the camera could be heard. Harry shuddered and lolled his head to try and look up, only to close his eyes again and turn his head away from the sudden white bright light coming from a nearby softbox.</p><p> </p><p>“The slightly unconscious model is often the most open and honest.” Harry shuddered to hear the insane glee coming from such an attractive voice. He then saw a tall figure come into his vision, and bend down, holding a camera with black gloves on both hands. Another picture is taken from the large black camera he can blearily see.</p><p><br/>
“No vanity or posing, just… Pure expression.” Harry tensed when one of those black gloved hands reached out and went into his hair. The teenager let out a whimper as the hand suddenly curled into the scalp and pulled him up by his hair. His breathing quickening and his eyes now wide and alert. The only thing his poor-near sighted emerald hues can focus in on where the icy blue eyes that belonged to his Photography teacher.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweet Merlin… Look at that perfect face.” His teacher spoke with a breathless and lustful tone. Harry felt his cheeks heat up despite the situation he was in, he should not be feeling flustered from the complement the man had given him. Especially in a situation like this. Harry was then carelessly dropped back down onto the white backdrop he was placed on.</p><p> </p><p>“Now Harry, I need you to hold that position for me…” Mr. Riddle spoke in a whisper, preparing his camera. Disoriented and confused, Harry moved around, trying to lift his throbbing head from the awkward position it was in. Suddenly Harry felt a painful slap on the top of his head, slamming him back down on the white cloth.</p><p> </p><p>“I said hold that position!” Mr. Riddle hissed threateningly, Harry tensed, his shoulders shaking. “Stay. Still. Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry let out a shaky breath, his eyes filling with tears.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>Oh, why had he not listened to Principal Dumbledore?</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The man had given him warnings about Mr. Riddle countless of times. Even the subtle red alerts around his photography teacher were not noticeable until it was too late…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>But how could he not be drawn to the man?</strong>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Riddle seemed so<strong> kind</strong>, so <strong>caring</strong>, so <strong>compassionate</strong>, so <strong>charming</strong>…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>That was all probably an act.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>A trap to lure him in.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <u>Like a hunter waiting for an unsuspecting kill.</u>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <strong>And Harry got to close to the trap…</strong>
  </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Shh… Shh, don’t worry Harry, I'm sorry.” Mr. Riddle whispered in a sweet soothing voice. The voice that he only used around Harry. Harry let out a cry and tried to get away from the man, his mind finally clearing up from the drugs the teacher had used on him.</p><p> </p><p>“Le-Let me go you crazy bastard!” Harry shouted, finally coming to his senses. His feet scrambling around on the ground as he tried to get away from the man.</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Riddle clicked his tongue in annoyance, standing up from his crouched position. And he went over to a nearby cart. The man set down the camera he was using, reaching over to a silver tray and pulling a needle out. Harry tried to roll away, but his left shoulder throbbed in pain from where the needle Mr. Riddle had used on him earlier stopped him from going any further. Harry let out a cry when Mr. Riddle’s hand grabbed onto his tender shoulder, preparing the next needle to go into his arm.</p><p> </p><p>“Please don’t fight me, Harry.” Harry had tears start to trail down his face as he stared wide-eyed in horror at his handsome teacher. Once again, the only thing he could see were those cold blue eyes that always seemed to draw him in. Harry let out a sob when he felt another needle go into the sensitive flesh of his left shoulder. The man smirked down at Harry as his eyes grew heavy from the posthaste drug Mr. Riddle had used on him.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>“Sweet dreams… My beautiful Doe.”</em>

</p><p> </p><p>The only thing Harry could think of before going into his unconscious state was…</p><p> </p><p align="center">

  <em>“Say Cheese!”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Ka-Chick</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry closed his eyes from the sudden flash of his 1990’s Polaroid camera. Which he would be using for the next the next year at Hogwarts Academy. Harry heard his father chuckle and the shirring sound of an instant photo coming out. The teen had playfully glared at his father and snatched away his favorite camera from his father’s hands. Harry then put the photo on his bed so the ink could set in. Harry, at the moment, was packing up all of his personal things in his bedroom. His father was supposed to be helping him, but instead, the man was goofing around with Harry’s things and reminiscing in memories. The reason why Harry was packing up was that he had just been recently accepted into an Academy both his parents had gone to during their senior year of high school.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Hogwarts Academy.</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Hogwarts Academy was a Private senior boarding High school located in Hogsmeade bay. A small seaside town in the evergreen lands of Scotland, and despite its location, Hogwarts Academy was a very rich and diverse school that majors in Science and Arts. In this case, Harry was accepted because of his natural talent on taking pictures. He considered himself, what most people call them today, a retro photographer. The 18-year-old enjoyed taking pictures using old-fashioned types of camera’s, for example, the Polaroid camera he has now.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Gifted to him from his Godfather Sirius Black…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>At the thought of his Godfather, Harry’s heart churned around painfully within his chest.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius Black had died 3 years ago during one of his late night work shifts. Both Harry’s father and Sirius Black were elite cops and they were on the job. Not suspecting a drug dealer teen to have a quick hand and a loaded gun. His family or he were not the same after that incident. He truly missed his godfather, the man was always the life and love of the party.</p><p> </p><p>His father especially took the most damage.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius Black was like a brother to James Potter. Childhood friends and related by blood. For 2 years, Harry’s father at the late of night, James would go in his private shed in the backyard and get himself drunk. His father was finally getting better with his drinking problem, but at certain dates, James would go back to his negative coping mechanism.</p><p> </p><p>Another one who took is as much as the damage that as his father, was his Uncle Remus Lupin.</p><p> </p><p>Who was in a relationship with Sirius Black.</p><p> </p><p>Speaking of his Uncle, Lupin was a professor at Hogwarts Academy. The man taught the Philosophy course. That man and his mind-fuck questions as well as his conspiracy theories…</p><p> </p><p>One time eating at one of his Uncle’s favorite diners. They had all ordered Mac and cheese with pie as a dessert. But Remus had taken away both the two forks and spoons from Sirius and Harry. Asking them if it would be easier to eat Mac and Cheese with a spoon or a fork, or a pie with one of the other utensil. Sirius literally went on a rampage how it would be easier to eat the cheesy noodles with a fork and the pie with a spoon. Which Harry argued with his godfather, saying it would have been better to eat a spoon with the Mac and cheese, and the fork with the pie. And Remus had sat back, sipping on his tea as he watched the chaos he had started; flare between the teen and childlike man. As they fought over which silverware was better to eat what with.</p><p> </p><p>That memory brought a small smile to Harry’s lips, it was one of the small things in life that brought him happiness…</p><p> </p><p>But that smile faded away when another, more recent memory came to mind.</p><p> </p><p>A few months ago, Harry had gone to that same cafe with Remus, it was pleasant and calm at first. Until the two of them had ordered the same meal of Mac and Cheese with Pie for dessert. Harry had brought up those past events when Sirius Black was alive, which was a mistake on Harry’s part. Because his uncle had gone silent for the rest of the day, refusing to make eye contact with him, and didn’t even say goodbye to Harry after he had dropped the teen off in the next town over. Where his parents had moved into after Sirius’s death.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Harry still had yet to apologize.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry had missed those days when his Uncle would ask those mind-numbing questions. Those ridiculous random fights he would have with his godfather.</p><p> </p><p>The raven-haired teen pulled himself out of his thoughts as soon as he felt his eyes start to burn with tears. He promised himself he would move on. But he knew, deep down, he missed the lovable Prankster he had lost at the ripe age of 15.</p><p> </p><p>Letting out a shuddering breath, Harry occupied his mind with things he still needed to pack up. Filling his suitcase with his wardrobe. His father then took this as an opportunity and wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder. Head locking the 18-year-old into a noogie.</p><p> </p><p>“D-Dad!” Harry shouted as he struggled to get out of his father’s grip. The man only laughed and continued to torture the poor boy.</p><p> </p><p>“My boy is going to Hogwarts Academy and I can’t play around with him before he leaves for months on end?” James, Harry’s father, asked, with a mock hurt tone to his voice.</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t mean you can torture the poor boy.” A new voice said coming into Harry’s room. Both males looked over at the doorway in Harry’s bedroom to see a red-headed woman, which her long ginger hair was tied back in a tight ponytail. Wearing a burgundy red tank top and navy blue jeans. The usual outfit that the woman would wear when there was work to be done around the house. Her intense emerald green eyes stared at the two males in the room. The same eyes Harry had gained through genetics. Lily Potter rolled her eyes and let out a short laugh, walking into her son’s room. Her emerald hues looking around at the walls of Harry’s bedroom, which the once bare baby blue walls were covered with posters of bands and pictures Harry had taken over the years. James had let Harry go, which the teen had to fix both his glasses which had moved off of place on his face and his untamable black hair was even more of a mess.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you not going to pack up these photos?” Lily asked as she brought up a hand to one of the pictures Harry took. It was in a group on the wall with a string of lights just over the bundle. Which was unplugged since Harry will be gone for a whole school year. This particular photograph Lily had reached out to, showed the family’s camping trip they had gone on 4 years ago. All family members accounted for, especially Sirius, who stood out the most in the picture. The man with long wavy black hair had his arm wrapped around Harry’s shoulder, both of his arms covered in punk related bracelets, smiling brightly into the camera, his other free hand wrapped around Remus’s waist. Which the man was smiling his soft genuine smiles. Something the man could no longer do this present day. She and James were on the other side of Harry, smiling merrily as well. Much like Harry, she wished to go back to those days when the family was whole and happy.</p><p> </p><p>“I will be taking a few with me,” Harry answered going over to his mother a bright smile on his face. Lily looked over at her son, seeing that smile drop from his lips when he saw the picture his mother was looking at. The woman then wrapped her arms around her son, pulling him close.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, why do you have such a gloomy look to your face huh? You should be celebrating.” Lily spoke, one hand going into Harry’s messy inky black hair. Harry only hummed in response.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, if you are planning to pack them up, you better do it now,” James said as he picked up one of Harry’s boxes of belongings. Harry pulled away from his mother’s embrace, nodding in agreement at his father’s words. Lily smiled down at her son, who pouted up at her. Harry was short for his age, which he honestly hated, most of his friends were taller than him. But despite his short height, he can put up a big fight. As James left; Lily went over to the half-packed suitcase Harry had spread out on his bed.</p><p> </p><p>“How about you go on ahead and start taking down photo’s you want to bring with you, I will help you finish packing up your wardrobe.” His mother said as she began folding one of his t-shirts which had the Queen’s band logo on it. Harry thanked his mother before turning back to the multiple photos on his wall. Taking the photo he and his mother were looking at before. Despite the sadness and the painful tightening of his chest that he would get whenever he had looked at this photo.</p><p> </p><p>It still was one of his favorites.</p><p> </p><p>Another memory came to mind, during the camping trip, Where it was at night by the campfire both he and his father collected wood for. Roasting marshmallows like some type of cliche family camping trips you would see on movies. Sirius had brought his Amazonia classical country guitar, strumming the six metal strings. Which his father sang along with the tune, and Sirius joined into. Both making up lyrics up that did not make any sense, which had made both Lily and Remus roll their eyes at the childish men. But Harry loved every moment of that song, and it was the time he had heard Sirius sing…</p><p> </p><p>Realizing it now, Harry always wondered why Remus had removed most of the radio stations that played country music. As well as Sirius’s favorite CD albums from the car both he and Sirius used to get around the seaside town they lived in. It was because they were all reminders of Sirius, all reminders that the man was no longer alive to enjoy the pleasures of life. That he was gone.</p><p> </p><p>The teen continued to pull photo’s off of his wall, avoiding the other pictures that had Sirius in them. Harry grabbed another one of his favorites. One he prided himself on taking.</p><p> </p><p>It was a young fawn.</p><p> </p><p>The baby dear in the picture was curled up underneath a white rose bush. It’s muzzle buried in the crook of its hind leg. The little fawn had looked so peaceful and calm, Harry couldn’t resist an opportunity of taking a picture of a fawn sleeping underneath a rose bush. Where the roses were all perfectly bloomed and had no bruises on any of the petals.</p><p><br/>
Harry finished gathering his photos and carefully putting them all away in a safe place. Going over to his bed where his mother was finishing up the last of his wardrobe. James would come back into Harry’s room and carried down one of the boxes he had packed up and filled with belongings.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, Harry was all packed up, the eighteen-year-old now carrying his suitcase down the stairs. His mother following behind him. James was waiting by the front doorway, wearing his worn out brown leather jacket he would always wear whenever he left the house.</p><p> </p><p>“All ready to go?” James asked smiling at the two that just came down the stairs. Harry smiled back up at his father, nodding his head as an answer. James then took the suitcase from Harry’s hands and carried it out to the family’s Volkswagen car. Which the very back of the car was filled with Harry’s boxes and other belongings he was bringing with him to Hogwarts Academy. After James had put Harry’s suitcase in, the teen had climbed into the back of the old car, sitting back into the light brown leather seats and putting on the buckle for safety. While his mother and father went into both the passenger and driver seats. His father on the right side, putting the keys into the ignition as his mother had buckled up. Harry took this moment to reach into his pocket and pull out his green Mp3 player, wanting to listen to his own music while they drove to the next town over. Hitting the shuffle button, he let the two singing voices of Agnus and Julia Stone fill his mind, his eyes looking out the window as he watched the scenery as the car drove by.</p><p><br/>
____________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p><br/>
“OOf!- Is that the last of it?” James asked as he set the last box into Harry’s dorm room, which was large and on the third floor of the dormitory building. Giving Harry the view of the front garden at the entrance of the students building. Harry’s room was set up where the bed was at one corner, resting against the wall by one of the two windows on the back brick wall where a desk and bookshelf. Which Harry was already filling with his books and smaller belongings excitedly. Harry looked over his shoulder at the box his father had just set down.</p><p> </p><p>“Yep! That's the last of it.” Harry answered recognizing it as the last box. Harry then turned more to see his mother already unpacking his clothes and hinging them up in the small space beside the door which was his closet and built-in clothing drawer. She was right now putting an outfit for him tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>“How about this? Hm? This would be nice to wear on your first day of school.” Lily said showing off the red and black plaid patterned shirt and a light grey t-shirt underneath with a stag on the front.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom, I can dress myself you know?” Harry asked sounding amused as his father went over to one side of the room to help set up lamps Harry had brought with him. Lily looked over at Harry with a raised eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yes, like the time you wore pajama’s to school when it was picture day.” Harry turned a bright red at that.</p><p> </p><p>“I was ten years old mom!” Harry shouted back embarrassed making his mother laugh out loud before turning back to his wardrobe. The Potters finished setting up Harry’s room, the teenager now hanging up the photo’s on the walls of his room.</p><p> </p><p>“And… Done!” Harry said, hanging up the last photo. Lily went over to Harry, handing him his Polaroid camera.</p><p> </p><p>“How about one last picture of us together? Until we see each other during the holidays.” Lily asked Harry’s smile grew bigger nodding his head eagerly as he took his camera in his hands. James rolled his eyes but he went over and wrapped an arm around Lily’s shoulder, pulling her close. Harry then prepared his camera, looking through the viewfinder of the polaroid. Once the camera was focused on both his parents Harry pressed down on the shutter button. His camera flashing briefly and the churring sound of film being inked and sliding out of the film door. Harry took the film and waved it around briefly to let the ink set in. Before setting it down to let it dry. Harry was then enveloped in an embrace by his mother.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to miss you.” She whispered. Harry tensed at first from the suddenness of the embrace, but he soon returned it, a longing feeling now growing inside of his chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to miss you too.” Once his mother pulled away, James had taken a turn hugging his son. Once he pulled away the man smiled down at his son.</p><p> </p><p>“Good luck, because we won't be here to help you with your school work,” James said jokingly.</p><p> </p><p>“That was you James, not Harry,” Lily said in a deadpan voice. James put a hand on his chest, giving her a mock hurt look on his face.</p><p> </p><p>“You wound me, my own wife!” James gasped out dramatically. Harry let out a small laugh at his father’s ridiculous antics.</p><p> </p><p>“We better get going, you better keep up with your school work Harry. Or I will drive here again and-“ Lily began to warn her son. Harry put his hands up defensively.</p><p> </p><p>“I promise I promise!”</p><p> </p><p>After a few more pestering questions from Lily, James finally got the overprotective mother to calm down and leave. Harry sighed in relief when both of his parents had left, turning around to look around his new room for the next 10 months. His emerald hues then looked over at the picture covered wall.</p><p> </p><p>
