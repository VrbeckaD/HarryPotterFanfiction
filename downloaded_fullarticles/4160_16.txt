    <p>Tina's guilt at having to hide something undoes them all. The problem is mostly that she's so law-abiding and morally just. It would have been better to smuggle Credence out without having told her anything, but to be angry at her was useless, and the thought of leaving her behind to think she had been in any way responsible for his death had been unthinkable.</p>
<p>Newt had pressed a copy of every bit of study he'd done on the Obscurus into Credence's hands before they deported him, and that had been over a week ago. (Or multiple weeks ago, it was hard to tell at this point.)

</p>
<p>They'd taken the notes away the first day, but  Credence could still recall diagrams, words he didn't understand, and some he did. He knew he should be dead, knew he was abhorrent, knew he was ultimately in trouble.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Credence, it will be okay." Miss Tina tells him, and he doesn't believe her, but he likes her, so he nods and follows the Aurors –  which is another word he knows and doesn't know the meaning of –  out and through corridors. And then there are so, so many people, and he wishes he could fade away and be no more. </p>
<p>The ward he's being told he's standing in  prevents magic from being cast. It is glowing very bright white, and it doesn't stop the entire time he’s standing in it.</p>
<p>For an hour they argue over his head, so many people, and the visions of his crimes float over that, in the enchanted space above him, and he stays with head down till all the voices blur into one. Tina is at his side, equally silent. Eventually the blend of voices quiets to a hum, and Credence knows it's an hour because he'd gotten good at telling time without a watch when a whipping was punishment for being late.</p>
<p>Silence, and the sound of metal tipped shoes clicking smartly on the marble flooring. He sees fancy brogues come up next to his thin boots and his breath holds fast in the cage of his chest.</p>
<p>"Director Graves," a voice greets.</p>
<p>"I apologize for my lateness; it took some time for my paperwork to be cleared by Healer Monroe."</p>
<p>A murmur through the room. Credence closes his eyes and tries to breathe through it.</p>
<p>The most important person in the room, Credence had picked out quickly enough, is the woman sitting at the forefront of it. There is a space beside her to her right that he notes is empty, and he glances at the shoes to his own right again and makes guesses. He's often right. "We have convened to judge the fate of the Obscurial." she says, "What is your input on the manner?"</p>
<p>"The Barebone child came to my attention after Auror Goldstein's attack on his mother. In a cursory follow up after this, I discovered that the obliviation on Credence Barebone had not worked. He retained memories of us. I began to suspect he had magical lineage at this point. It was from this that his presence came to be noticed by my impostor. I believe we are, and to avoid casting blame about that, I am, solely responsible for the actions Mr. Barebone was forced to take." A murmuring crest. "We owe it to him to right this injustice and place him into wizarding society as best we are able, where he has belonged all along." An explosion of sound arises in rebuttal.</p>
<p>Tina reaches out and takes his hand gently.</p>
<p>They break to have lunch, and he isn't brought back to his cell but instead to a nicely fitted room with beautiful things all around, and little paper mice fighting each other over an empty ink well. There is a collection of chairs around a table and Tina comes in with a tray, followed by a very pretty woman with golden hair, and then finally by Mister Graves.</p>
<p>He averts his eyes to the table, watches the tray slide onto it.</p>
<p>"It'll be fine Credence," Tina lies again, "Have some lunch okay?"</p>
<p>He picks up the hot drink from the tray but just holds it in his hands, letting the warmth seep through.</p>
<p>"Goldstein-" Both women look at Mister Graves and he frowns. Not that Credence can see, no, but it’s in his tone when he speaks again, "Auror Goldstein," he starts over, "I need you to run down to Wizarding Registration and look for the Ilvermorny letters on file from nine to ten years ago."</p>
<p>When Tina has rushed off, Credence can't hear what the man murmurs to who must be her sister, but she moves to sit down next to him and then they're alone, and he takes a steadying breath.</p>
<p>"Awful loud aren't they? Just like a bunch of parrots. You never met me but I'm Queenie." He manages to meet her eyes, "There now, make sure you eat up okay? I made that sandwich just for you!"</p>
<p>Now he has to eat it, it would be rude otherwise. His  stomach ties into knots, but he has to.</p>
<p>"Just take it slow sweetheart, you're okay. Two of the best and the brightest are on the case!"</p>
<p>He's a case now, or he's always been one, but to what ends are they fighting? He wants to trust Tina, she's only ever been kind to him, but he knows how very little power a person can have first-hand.</p>
<p>Tina isn't with Mister Graves when he returns and instead it's Queenie who comes in and stands at his side, and she takes his hand when another discussion begins.</p>
<p>"If you believe he should be placed in wizarding society, where do you intend he should be placed, Director Graves?" Another person asks, sharp, and Credence can feel hatred, fear, distaste all around him. Queenie squeezes his hand gently. <i>Have strength,</i> it whispers, and gives him clarity.</p>
<p>"Certainly we cannot send him to school at his age." A laugh sounds to accompany this claim, and then a murmur of voices in agreement.</p>
<p>"Who do you expect to have the skill and time to devote to habituating him to our ways?"</p>
<p>Mister Graves stands in the same exacting fashion to his right as he had when he'd first come in, and Credence has memorized the intricate curved designs on his shoes already. "Myself, which is why I am submitting now a request that I be put on seven months light duty followed by a three month period of shadowing my temporary replacement before I be reinstated as Director."</p>
<p>It is that very important voice which speaks up next, "Percival, you need not prove your loyalty to Congress. Healer Monroe found you fit. If that is not good enough for the assembled, they would do well to bring it to me." She pauses; Credence can almost make out her careful nod, "But in this no one assembled has the right to judge your loyalty, and I myself greatly respect your counsel. We will break for the day and tomorrow we will decide. I release the Obscurus into your custody in the meantime, Director Graves." There is a murmur of voices, but they do not dare to grow too loud in their unhappiness.</p>
<p>They lead him back to the small room. There is only one paper mouse left and it is sleeping in the empty inkwell. They don’t stay long, just enough for Tina and Mister Graves to speak to one another in quiet voices before gathering their things to leave. Credence is dizzy with the sudden breath of fresh air, the freedom after being so long imprisoned.</p>
<p>Credence learns three things on the way to Mister Graves' apartment. The first is what an Auror is: it is what Mister Graves and Tina are, a sort of police officer for magical persons. This answer he gets from Mister Graves, who leans in, not touching, just close enough to almost touch, and whispers it to him from beside him.</p>
<p>The second is that the sick twisting transference, where he started in one place and was pulled to another by Him, is called apparition, and it feels much better when he has Queenie and Tina bracketing him in. This is explained as Mister Graves walks backwards, Credence watching his shoes on the sidewalk as they come out on the mostly empty street, and he's not even nauseated  like he'd been before. Mister Graves is an attentive teacher.</p>
<p>The third thing is that Mister Graves lives in a place far too nice for Credence to be in, far too nice. There is a doorman, and an elevator, and even Tina and Queenie walk like they're afraid of making something dirty.</p>
<p>"It is a little messy, as to be expected. The Investigative staff turned it over looking for evidence but it doesn't appear he lived here." Mister Graves says, no longer walking backwards. "Tina, I'd like your assistance relaying wards, if you would?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir!" She sounds glad to have something to do, and Credence can sympathize.</p>
<p>"Queenie, be a doll and go buy him clothes that will let him fit in; I want Congress to be unable to pick him out as no-maj tomorrow. Overdo it if you need to." Mister Graves puts money in her hand and she's gone in a swirl before Credence can protest. Have they not already done enough for him? His clothing is perfectly wearable still; the patches in his sleeves don't even need freshening up yet.</p>
<p>Mister Graves pauses, Credence can feel his eyes on him, and it makes his stomach turn over . He has nothing to do now; he wishes he had something to do. "Can you read?" Mister Graves pitches his voice to a whisper as he had when he'd been explaining what an Auror was.</p>
<p>"Yes sir, I worked in the press setting the letters for the pamphlets and never spelled a single word wrong." Or he'd have been beaten for that too, so he remembered well. And what’s more besides , those who couldn't read couldn't read from the Good Book, and that was slothful. It did ultimately help that Puritans had a wide variety of ways to spell a word so there was a smaller margin of error.</p>
<p>"Good, good." And Mister Graves moves fast out of his sight, so he has to look up to follow his feet and looks up too far to the lines of energy and purpose in the fall of his coat, and there is a life there he can't believe he never noticed before, a vibrancy. Except, pausing, feeling the sick turning of the sandwich in his stomach, the ash taste in his mouth, of course he'd missed it. Or forgotten it maybe, when everything had been layered over so desperately with Him.</p>
<p>He wants to ask Mister Graves how many meetings had been him, wants to know when it began. He accidentally meets dark brown eyes when the man turns back, a book in his hand. Mister Graves is careful not to touch skin, to brush their hands together in any way, to press too close when he puts the book into Credence's hands. Credence notices that now too.</p>
<p>"Start in on this." Mister Graves says, and Credence looks down, <em>American Magical History</em>. Credence has to remember how to breathe.</p>
<p>He registers the others  moving around outside the sitting room  , noises, sometimes a crash or two, Tina laughing out loudly once. He's two chapters in, past the first Native school and into the journey of the Pilgrims and Isolt Sayre, the  one European witch among them, when Queenie returns. He puts the book down carefully as she takes measurements with a floating tape-measure, and he watches it wide eyed as it curves around him snake-like. She takes in the clothing herself, enchanting hems in place.</p>
<p>Tina and Mister Graves stop their mysterious work long enough to come and watch, and Queenie has bought him enough clothing for a change each day of the week.  And it's too much and Credence doesn't deserve this, he doesn't, but it would be rude to turn away this kindness in front of Mister Graves’ friends.</p>
<p>"Let’s take a break," Mister Graves says and Credence glances over to see the coat gone, his shirt sleeves rolled up. He breaks his gaze back to the ground, feeling like he's been dropped several feet to hit hard. "It's dinner time anyway, I'll order us something and then we can get into those papers for the Ilvermorny eagles. The second floor can wait ‘til tomorrow; I'll just bunk in the study tonight."</p>
<p>Credence barely touches his roast chicken; it's so rich and there is even gravy, and he only knows gravy as a concept. The vegetables settle better in his stomach but even then there is butter, which he only knows from a vague memory of getting into the bins behind Lionelli's Bistro before getting caned for it, so even that is enough to make him a little queasy. Someone puts another slice of plain bread on his plate when he isn't looking. It is easier to stomach by far in comparison.</p>
<p>"Leonard Quirm?" Tina reads off the list, three names down. One of them had been a girl they'd almost been sure, but she'd marked it with a maybe just in case.</p>
<p>Mister Graves flips through his own list, "No, we've got a wand, December fifth."</p>
<p>"I can't believe Abernathy just handed all of those files over." Tina complains, for the second time.</p>
<p>"He's terrified of me; it's not that hard to get what you want from him if he thinks you're going to hex him into Saturday after next. Maybe if you didn't hide under your desk?"</p>
<p>"His voice is so, so grating. I'm not hiding from him, I just didn't like to hear him any more than I had to."</p>
<p>"I don't think you look like a Leonard either, honey." Queenie smiles at him; he's sure it's her slice of bread.</p>
<p>"James Lionheart?" But Tina shakes her head right away, "Okay I know, stupid yes, he works in that shop on Dragonscale."</p>
<p>Mister Graves snorts a sound of amusement and Credence manages to look past his plate to the careful recline of the man, one hand holding his list, the other splayed open-palmed on his stomach. Oh, oh heavens. The waistcoat stretched taut, fine embroidery glinting in the light, and there isn't even recognition of his own attraction before he's already jumped tracks into panic. She'll know, she'll know, she always knows, followed swiftly by a sickening stifling guilt that has him breathing shallow, vision spinning, because she won't know.</p>
<p>She's dead, Ma is dead, and it's his fault, he killed her, and how could he do such a thing, what a wicked boy, what sin, murder. He doesn't know anything but noise like radio static from the shop next to the church, doesn't know anything but pain in his chest like his heart trying to collapse on itself, worse still, doesn't know anything until it's Queenie petting his hair and he's not in the kitchen, he's on the sofa he'd been reading on, and his face is wet, like he's been crying.</p>
<p>He's been crying. "There now sweetheart, there now, just breathe with me." Queenie says, and Tina is holding his hand and Mister Graves is in the doorway, as if he's afraid to come in any further. "Some cold water?" Queenie asks, and then Mister Graves is gone from the doorway too.</p>
<p>He drinks the glass and then it's refilled by magic, and the wonder of it draws him from the spell.  He is exhausted, and Queenie bustles around,  "No, of course we won't leave." It's like she can read his thoughts. She smiles at him and nods very slowly, and he opens his eyes very wide.</p>
<p>A pillow is fetched and the light in the sitting room dimmed, and he can hear them still in the kitchen, voices just loud enough to make out.</p>
<p>"Harold Lovelock?"</p>
<p>"Wand."</p>
<p>"Pepper Pince, oh wait, no, we busted him for illegal Felix Felicis sales two years back didn't we?"</p>
<p>"You were a rookie on that case, took a hex right to the face and kept going." Mister Graves sounds amused, and Credence just feels worry thread through him for Tina.</p>
<p>"Sir, I saw you take a support pillar to the leg one time and walk off bone regrowth potion, let’s not make this a contest."</p>
<p>Credence is drifting in the dim light with the hum of slowly familiar and warm voices pacifying him, the pain in his chest a dull memory.</p>
<p>"Tenebris Nyx." Tina reads off the list.</p>
<p>"Artemisia Nyx had a son?" Is what Mister Graves asks, a flutter of pages. "No wand here, let me see that list."</p>
<p>Credence falls asleep to the sound of quickly turning pages.</p>
