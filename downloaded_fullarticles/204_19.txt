    <p align="justify">Seungwan should've known better than to wager against Sooyoung.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Considering the Slytherin girl's penchant for mischief and deception, it should've been enough incentive for Seungwan to know that something fishy was going on. But even her long history of pure bad luck and gullible tendencies didn't prevent her from taking the bait. Now she had to sneak around the halls of Hogwarts in the middle of the night concealed under the invisibility cloak to search of the fabled Room of Requirement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She could've been lounging in the Ravenclaw common room right now writing her essay in Transfiguration and or sneaking into the kitchens to teach the art of Muggle baking to the house elves she befriended but no, she just had to lose a stupid bet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And now, she had to pay for the price.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She descended from the winding steps of the Grand Staircase and followed the directions leading to the castle grounds. The rational part of her brain screamed at her to <em>Turn back! You're breaking school rules! Retreat before you get expelled! </em>But the other side of her, the small, miniscule and barely-there prideful side of her refused to be cowed. She will not back down from this. Seungwan didn't want to give Sooyoung the satisfaction of knowing that she was a coward all along.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">By the end of the corridor, the young Ravenclaw stopped dead in her tracks when the Gray Lady fluttered pass the solid walls. Their gazes met and those lifeless eyes seemed to see past the magic veil of her invisibility cloak. Seungwan briefly wandered if ghosts were immune to its enchantments. Thankfully, the Gray Lady ignored her existence and continued haunting the halls of Hogwarts. Once the coast was clear, Seungwan resumed her task.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Any normal person could pretend and claim about finding the Room of Requirement but Seungwan was such a bad liar so there was no way she could've successfully pulled a deception of this magnitude from Sooyoung. The girl was an experienced bullshit detector and any attempts of manipulation from Seungwan would be for nought.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Besides, Kim Yerim, a young Gryffindor and Sooyoung's evil partner in crime, threatened to jinx Seungwan's flying broom and burn all the books she owned if she ever chickened out. In the end, the Ravenclaw decided that she couldn't risk it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lurking behind the statue of a grotesque gargoyle, Seungwan blew off whisps of her blonde hair that obscured her vision as she studied the intricate patterns carved on the walls in the hopes of revealing a concealed passageway. Hogwarts was full of hidden rooms and other enchantments. Many of its secrets remained undiscovered and it would take her centuries to uncover all of them.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was an unmistakable sound of footsteps echoing along the halls and she hastened her pace. "Nox!" After extinguishing the light from her wand and ensuring that her entire body was hidden underneath the cloak, Seungwan waited with bated breath when she saw the hunched figure of Filch emerge from the Great Hall. His beady eyes scanned the empty corridor, searching for anything suspiciously out of the ordinary. He entirely missed the young Ravenclaw's silhouette standing beside a knight statue and decided to make a quick stop to his office. He found it pointless to patrol the school and catch rule-breaking students without the aid of his precious shackles.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan released a sign of relief. She was <em>not</em> getting caught today. No sir!</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She poked her head out from the cloak, checking to see if he really left the vicinity and cheering internally when he did. Seungwan was really pushing it now. The number of school rules she was breaking must be horrendous and her best friend Joohyun would be so disappointed, especially when she finds out that the invisibility cloak she lent to Seungwan had been used for illegal purposes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan knew that she was a bad friend, taking advantage of Joohyun's kindness and lying just to achieve her ends, but a lot was at stake here and she couldn't let the devil duo win. She couldn't let them taint Ravenclaw's immaculate reputation by allowing the spread of rumors regarding her cowardice. Seungwan would rather die than bring shame to her house.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The young Ravenclaw sucked in a deep breath and steadied her resolve. She needed to find this Room of Requirement as soon as possible so she could return to her common room and be done with it. She still needed to read Gilderoy Lockhart's <em>Voyages with Vampires </em>goddamnit!</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"The light drives away the void that has long blinded my eyes upon your arrival." Seungwan nearly jumped in surprise when the portrait of a dark-haired woman, wearing a white Grecian dress and resting casually on a rustic bench then holding a cluster of grapes within the palm of her hands, called her attention. The title <em>Embodiment of Love and Beauty: Aphrodite</em> was carved on the base of the portrait's golden frame and it sparked a recent memory of the Greek Mythology book Seungwan was reading a few days ago. "Come yonder and whisper the melody into my ears-" Aphrodite leaned closer to get a better look at the blonde girl. "-the reason why a darling <em>rose</em> like you lurks in the darkness of the night."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Wow</em>. The Ravenclaw was amazed. Who knew that Aphrodite could be so <em>poetic</em>? All the books she read never mentioned how the goddess had a way with words. She could give Apollo a run for his money.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Uhmm.." Seungwan was bewildered because she thought she was doing a great job of hiding. Apparently not, because she was clearly caught by someone, even if it was just a mere painting. "I was hoping to find the Room of Requirement." The greek goddess ruefully shook her head, tendrils of raven black locks swaying with every movement, and made such a simple act look so elegant.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Aphrodite seemed refined and ethereal and for some reason, Seungwan noted an akin likeness between the goddess and Joohyun.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>Huh</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"My <em>lovely</em> rose. Forget such trivialities and allow me to <em>bask</em> in your sweet presence." Aphrodite purred as she batted her eyelashes coquettishly at the innocent girl. The goddess seemed to have taken a liking towards the young Ravenclaw. "You wield the brilliance of the sun within you. Are you, perchance, an offspring of Apollo?" And when Seungwan shook her head <em>no</em>, the deity continued singing her praises. "No matter. I will not let such things hinder us. For I will pluck all stars in the sky and weave them into garments only befitting of your radiance."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The blonde girl didn't know what to do with the sudden attention. She was flattered, really, that the <em>Goddess of Love and Beauty</em> found her worthy of her affections but Aphrodite was a <em>portrait</em> and Seungwan was just <em>not</em> into her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan thought of ways on how to gently turn the goddess' advances down without offending her. Sure, Aphrodite was a <em>portrait</em> and held no real power over her but all deities, even ones immortalized in <em>paintings</em>, had enormous pride and easily get injured at the smallest of things.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I wish to fulfill your wishes O lovely Aphrodite! But my heart is torn and I simply cannot." Seungwan decided to lay it thick and flatter the goddess. The sooner she escapes this predicament, the sooner she can continue her task of finding the elusive room. "For I am a mere mortal unworthy of your affections. Our becoming is never destined and the Sisters of Fate would drive us apart." At times like these, her greasiness was put to good use. All those instances of playfully flirting at Joohyun was paying off.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"We simply cannot be." She whispered brokenly to elicit a dramatic effect and successfully rendered Aphrodite into tears. Who knew that Seungwan had a knack for theatrics?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A part of her was guilty for pulling this cunning move and manipulating someone, even if that someone was just a <em>portrait</em>, but she couldn't deny the rush of excitement it gave her. She was starting to know what it felt like being a Slytherin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Alas! You speak of the truth, my <em>darling</em> rose, and my heart has come to accept this. Forgive me for forcing my unwanted affections upon you." The goddess wiped away the last of her tears and gathered her resolve. "Allow me to amend my offenses and aid you in your endeavors." Aphrodite bestowed her godly blessings upon the blonde, which was completely unnecessary because the deity was a <em>painting</em> and she wielded no real power, and Seungwan just obeyed because she wasn't raised to be rude. "You seek of a place which is hard to find. A room that comes and goes."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That piqued the young Ravenclaw's interest and she leaned closer, eager to learn what the deity has to say. Aphrodite smiled fondly at Seungwan before stating a cryptic message. "It only ever appears in times of great need."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their little chat was interrupted when familiar voices sounded down the corridor. "I think someone's down here!" One of them said and their footsteps quickened. The young Ravenclaw panicked and spurred into action by hiding behind a marble pillar and covering herself with the invisibility cloak. She waited with bated breath and clutched her wand tightly as she prepared herself for an unwanted confrontation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan thought she heard the distinct sound of a cat purring and upon glancing down, she was caught paralyzed by the sight of Mrs. Norris glaring at her nastily. The feline's beady yellow eyes sent tendrils of fear to her spine. For a moment, she wondered how the animal could see her through the veil of the enchanted cloak. Did felines have a heightened sense of sight that they acquired the ability to detect invisible objects? "Shoo! Please go away." Seungwan tried her best to treat the cat with as much courtesy as possible because even though Mrs. Norris wasn't the most well-liked among the students, considering she was Filch's pet, but she was still a cat and Seungwan respected all animals, no matter how evil.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Mrs. Norris had other intentions because her hackles rised and lunged to attack the young Ravenclaw. Those razor-sharp claws sank deep into her leg, slightly drew some blood, and effectively tore her trousers. The blonde was unable to stop the groan that escaped from her lips when she felt the stinging sensation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Crap!</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The voices became louder and the young Ravenclaw barely had time to control her agonized breathing when two figures emerged from the dark hall. Upon getting a clearer look on their features, Seungwan stifled a groan and cursed the universe for playing a sick game on her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was her friends. Seulgi and Joohyun.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Both of which were <em>Prefects</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Prefects who were patrolling the halls of Hogwarts late at night.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Prefects who, if they somehow caught wind of Seungwan's rule-breaking, had the authority to take away house points and report the said girl to the Head of the Ravenclaw House.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Just her luck.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"There's nothing down here Joohyun." Seulgi directed the tip of her wand to cast a beam of light upon the dark corridor. Joohyun told her earlier that she heard some noises in the vicinity and accompanied her friend to investigate. "It's just Mrs. Norris hissing at nothing in particular." Seulgi nodded at the said feline, who was busy glaring at an empty spot behind a marbled pillar, then turned to regard her friend skeptically.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"That's odd." A minute ago, she thought she heard someone whimpering as if they were in pain. Thinking that a person was injured, she hurried over to check it out, only to find nothing. <em>Did I miss something?</em> Joohyun thought as she squinted her eyes to thoroughly examine the dark hall. She found the cat's actions quite unusual, hissing at the wall and clawing at the empty space as if provoked by the air, but she chalked it up to weird animal behavior. She shook her head and acquiesced. "It must have been my imagination."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Do you want to rest? I could finish patrolling if you want. We've already checked most of the castle anyway." Seulgi asked her friend in concern. Being a kind person that she was, it's quite expected of her to ensure her friend's well-being, even if it meant sacrificing her own. Maybe her good-nature just comes with being a Hufflepuff.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"No, I'm fine." Joohyun declined her offer and adjusted the green scarf wrapped around her neck. The cold air felt like freezing shards that bit her skin but she shrugged her uneasiness off and remained impassive because she didn't want to inconvenience Seulgi. "Let's finish this."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She gritted her teeth when another blast of the chilly night air hit her face. Joohyun longed for a personal heater, probably in the form of a blonde Ravenclaw Muggleborn whose bright smile put the sun to shame.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Last stop, the Dungeons." Seulgi shivered anxiously when she uttered the word. She aimed the light down the spiralling staircase that led to their intended destination and huddled close to Joohyun partly for warmth and mostly for reassurance. The taller girl felt uncomfortable with dark and creepy places. She had gotten used to the warm and comfy atmosphere of the Hufflepuff common room and stifling areas like the Dungeons made her quite nervous. It was a good thing she had her Slytherin friend to accompany her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Joohyun furrowed her brows, took one last look at the dark halls, before reluctantly following Seulgi to continue with their patrol.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As soon as the Prefects were out of sight, the blonde released the breath she'd been holding and quickly shrugged off her cloak to check the damage that evil cat had inflicted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sure enough, her trousers were torn and there was a trail of blood that stained the rainbow-colored socks she borrowed from Seulgi. <em>Crap</em>! The socks were ruined and no amount of <em>Scourgify</em> could remove those bloodstains. Seungwan used to stock her luggage with numerous bottles of bleach for cleaning purposes but her supplies dwindled after that one particular incident which involved diving under the black lake for some experimental research in Care of Magical Creatures and trying to befriend a Giant Squid for extra credit.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">How was the blonde supposed to know that the Giant Squid’s way of showing its trust and getting its stamp of approval was to squirt stinky black ink all over her body?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">How was she supposed to know that, by that simple and disgusting gesture alone, she was already adopted into the squid community?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Squid ink was difficult to remove, mind you, and it left Seungwan smelling like seafood the whole week.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And that was the story of how she used up all her bleach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">If only there was some magical equivalent of the <em>7/11</em> convenient store in the wizarding world so she could restock her supplies.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Oh well, can’t have everything, can we?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Mrs. Norris poised for another attack and that was enough incentive for Seungwan to run for her life. It was quite ridiculous that she was being terrorized by a cat but in her defense, Mrs. Norris was a demon incarnate. No amount of reasoning would work around that feline so with the influence of her self-preservation, the young Ravenclaw took off. If she were to die, she didn’t want it to be caused by something stupid like being <em>clawed to death by a cat.</em> That’s just ridiculous. She’d be rolling over her grave if that were to happen.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan dashed along the winding halls of Hogwarts and ignored the burning sensation on her wound. Adrenaline was the only thing keeping her sane now and she tried to remain composed while a murderous cat followed her wake. She took a series of twist and turns and ran until she could no longer hear the sound of screeching and purring.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The Ravenclaw stopped short to catch her breath and shrugged off her cloak to wipe the sweat off her face. She had never been more exhausted in her entire life and that was a great indicator that Seungwan needed to do more cardio. It made her wonder if this dare was worth risking her life for. She contemplated of backing out but the mocking laugh of Sooyoung and the sinister grin of Yeri, along with the images of broken brooms and burning books, flashed into her mind and her resolve was back full force.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She’d come this far. Might as well get this over with.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She will not live like a coward. Not today Satan!</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But as soon as Seungwan regained some courage, it quickly dwindled when she realized that she was lost, like, <em>really </em>lost. It seemed like she stumbled upon an old abandoned classroom by chance.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Scrolls of spare parchment and splinters littered the floors, unused desks and chairs were stacked haphazardly behind the dust-covered blackboard and marbled statues were blasted into pieces. The windows were smashed and the walls were scorched. It’s as if someone lit the whole room on fire and left it burning for centuries. A few Dementor dummies were broken beyond repair and some of its parts fell to ashes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then <em>something</em> caught her attention.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Standing far back into the room and partially covered by a worn red tapestry, there was an ornate and fairly ancient-looking mirror. The base had a clawed foot that served as a support and the gold borders that framed its edges were inscribed with a foreign and probably dead language.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Due to the fact that she was a Ravenclaw and she had a natural tendency to be curious, Seungwan walked close to inspect the object. She tried to decipher the hidden meaning behind the carvings and moved until her silhouette was reflected in the mirror.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She looked like a hobo.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Due to all the running she had to do, her short blonde locks clung to her neck in sticky waves and sweat dampened her skin. Her robes were askew and trousers were torn. She looked like she took a jolly night stroll at the Forbidden Forest but got attacked by an Acromantula.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her disheveled appearance reminded her of the time Ravenclaw had a Quidditch match against Gryffindor. It was a pitch-black stormy day and she strayed off the pitch trying to catch the Golden Snitch. She was struck by lightning and landed on the Whomping Willow really badly. Ravenclaw won the match but her broom was pretty wrecked and she was out of commission for nearly three months.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan tried to smooth out the unruly bangs that covered her eyes when the image shimmered and her appearance changed. Suddenly, she wasn't the only person reflected in the mirror anymore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Standing before her were her friends and all sported cheery expressions on their faces. They looked older and more refined. Gone was the childlike naivety in their eyes and it was replaced with such wisdom that only comes after long years of being exposed to the world and meeting different people.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Each of them portrayed their dream job. Sooyoung was now a fierce Auror. There was a certain fire in her eyes as she casually draped an arm over a Yerim, who appeared to be the youngest Head of the Ministry of Magic. The Gryffindor girl sported the same mischievous smile and it seemed like she still retained her penchant for troublemaking. Seulgi clutched her latest edition Comet 2500 and posed elegantly like the famous Quidditch player that she is. Joohyun was staring at all of them fondly. A small contented smile graced her lips as she stood as the new Headmistress of Hogwarts. Meanwhile, Seungwan had the professional badge of a Mediwitch and cradled in her arms an award from St. Mungo's hospital for her tireless efforts in curing magical maladies.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There she was together with the people she held dearly to her heart, looking happy and contented, serving as pillars of support for each other and carrying with them an unbreakable bond formed by long years of friendship.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Everything she desired and all she had been dreaming about were right before her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"What are you doing here?"</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan jumped in surprise when she heard the familiar bone-chilling voice that could only belong to one person.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>Joohyun.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Judging from the stern expression she was sporting, the Slytherin Prefect was in her <em>no-nonsense</em> mode and she didn't look quite happy catching Seungwan red handed. "Sneaking around the castle at night is forbidden." Her tone sounded accusatory and the Ravenclaw fought hard not to squirm under her intense gaze. If glares could kill, the blonde would be dead right now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>So much for not getting caught.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Sorry." She offered a lame apology, suddenly finding her shoes very interesting. <em>Oh look!</em> There’s a drop of blood staining the laces! She really needed to get some bleach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Joohyun's left eye twitched in annoyance, it didn't take long for Seungwan to break like a dam and quickly spun a tale of how she got into this predicament. "I lost a bet to Sooyoung! I really didn't want to break the rules but Yerim threatened to jinx my broom and burn my books if I chickened out!"</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Joohyun remained indifferent the whole time the blonde Ravenclaw pleaded her defense. Her gaze landed on the invisibility cloak that was discarded to the ground. The one she lent to Seungwan. “Is this why you borrowed my cloak? To use it for illicit purposes?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“No! I mean- Yes!” Seungwan slapped her forehead. She was running out of excuses to tell. It seems like she can’t bullshit her way out of this situation. “I just wanted to find the Room of Requirement and Sooyoung said it can only be found at night.” The blonde sighed in defeat. Even she sounded crazy to herself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Didn’t anyone warn you not to play Sooyoung’s games? Anyone in their right minds wouldn’t fall for her tricks.” Joohyun furrowed her brows. How could anyone be <em>that</em> gullible?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I know! I can be pretty stupid at times!” The Ravenclaw was ready to rip out her hair and throw herself out the window. There would be fewer stupid people in the world and she would  be doing the universe a favor. She groaned and stared helplessly at her amused friend. It’s good to know that the Slytherin found entertainment in her misery. “Why do I always make bad life decisions?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Honestly? I also ask myself that question.” Then Joohyun noticed the blood gushing on Seungwan’s feet and rushed to her aid immediately. “What happened? Who did this to you?” She forced the blonde to sit down on the floor while she inspected the wounds. Thankfully, it wasn’t that deep and didn’t require a complicated healing spell for it to mend.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s nothing really, just a scratch.” Seungwan tried to shrug it off but Joohyun remained persistent and vigilantly scanned her from head to toe to check if she’d been hurt anywhere else. Once the Prefect was certain that the blonde was relatively unharmed, except for her bloody feet, she proceeded to softly blow air upon the wound in an attempt to soothe the pain. Seungwan blinked twice. Her heart hammering against the cages of her ribs and she had difficulty swallowing the lump in her throat.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There was something about the way Joohyun tenderly cradled her injured leg and traced featherlight strokes on her skin. Her hands were gentle, reverent… cautious. It’s as if she was taking great care not to break Seungwan with her touch. Their gazes met and Seungwan somehow stopped breathing. Something shimmered in Joohyun’s eyes, a message held secret deep within her soul, and the young Ravenclaw couldn’t quite decipher it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Without taking her stare off the injured girl, the Slytherin Prefect took out her wand and cast a healing spell. “Episkey.” Joohyun whispered under her breath, eyes transfixed on those soft lips, itching to get close…<em>closer.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan could barely feel the wound closing nor the pain waning. Joohyun was looking at her intensely and she didn’t know how to handle it so she asked a rather dumb query. “Is there something on my face?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That effectively broke Joohyun out of whatever trance she was in. The Slytherin girl cleared her throat and stood up. She helped the blonde girl to her feet but refused to meet her eyes so she looked everywhere until she gazed upon the ancient looking mirror. Her curiosity was piqued. "What's this?" Noticing the foreign language carved on its golden frame, Joohyun moved closer to examine it. She wondered aloud.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Erised?"</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Okay, this might sound crazy but I have a theory. Hogwarts is a magical school whose mysteries are still left unsolved. This might be one of those mysteries. You do know that the school never runs out questionable objects." Seungwan voiced out her ideas and it didn't take long for her to start pacing. Her hands making wild gestures in the air as she tried to put into words the thousands of possibilities her brain concocted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I think this mirror shows the future." The Ravenclaw declared with such certainty and paused, eyes narrowing as millions of other thoughts swam into her head. "But how far into the future does it show? Maybe not too far." She shook her head and continued pacing.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The Slytherin Prefect stood back and watched the blonde mutter a thousand things per minute. It's like her mouth couldn't keep up with her brain so she compensates by rambling about nothing and everything at once. It was only during times like this that Joohyun would get a glimpse inside Seungwan's mind. The younger girl was usually insecure about being a chatterbox, always carefully watching her words and actions around people. If it were up to her, she'd listen to Seungwan all day. Her thoughts were like lyrics Joohyun would gladly spend her life composing into a song.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"What do you see?" Her internal musing was interrupted when the Ravenclaw stopped pacing and regarded her with an inquiry. Solving mysteries had always been Seungwan's obsession and the Prefect could tell that she was in her element. Joohyun could see it. The way the flames of curiosity burned in those brown orbs and the eagerness to discover the unknown transformed her, giving her an aura of confidence that rarely showed itself.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan was glowing and it took her breath away.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It took Joohyun a few moments to gather her thoughts. The effort to calm her pounding heart was futile for the blonde proved to be quite distracting so she focused all her attention to both their reflection in the mirror instead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I don't see anything." Joohyun furrowed her brows and regarded the blonde in confusion. What was so special about this mirror? It certainly didn’t look so magical to her. Maybe Seungwan was mistaken?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Are you sure?" Seungwan was bewildered. If her theory was correct and this mirror showed the future then why couldn't Joohyun see anything? She gestured for Joohyun to try again since she was desperate to prove her point. “Can you please look again?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Joohyun was unamused. It was pointless really. It was just a regular mirror. There was nothing magical about it. Why can’t the blonde Ravenclaw see that? She crossed her arms and glared hard at the reflections on the mirror, particularly at herself for always giving into Seungwan’s wishes. “Have you forgotten how mirrors work?” A minute has passed and she still found nothing in particular.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I only see us."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dejected look on Seungwan's features tugged at Joohyun’s heartstrings and the Slytherin Prefect volunteered to stare back into the useless mirror for an hour. Yes, Joohyun was a mess. She was a HUGE mess. She could barely make rational decisions when it came to Seungwan.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The blonde shook her head and declined the Prefect’s offer. "Maybe it's just my imagination."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan grabbed the abandoned invisibility cloak on the floor and dusted off the dirt before wrapping it snugly around Joohyun to keep her warm. Then she grabbed the raven-haired girl’s hand and guided her out of the room. Her mind running a thousand miles per minute, still trying to make sense of the mystery she witnessed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Slytherin girl kept glancing at their intertwined hands, wondering why their fingers fit so perfectly with each other and thinking about how she didn't want to let go.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Not now, not <em>ever</em>.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And deep down Joohyun knew, that she wouldn't mind being cold if it meant that Seungwan would always keep her warm.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">***</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Seungwan never did find the Room of Requirement and the following day, she had to face the music in the form of Sooyoung's offhanded <em>Honestly? I'm even not surprised. I've heard rumors that the Room of Requirement only ever shows itself to people of worth and, no offense, you are not such person.
