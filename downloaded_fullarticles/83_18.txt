    <p>He was walking when he felt it. A small hand reaching into his coat pocket, aiming for the money he had stowed there. He grabbed the wrist and turned.</p><p> </p><p>It was a child.</p><p> </p><p>The boy was filthy, covered in grime, although his dark skin made it hard to tell just how bad it was. His hair, which looked like it had once been curly, lay flat and greasy against his head, covering his ears and forehead. The worst was his face, gaunt and pinched, evidence that he hadn’t eaten a good meal in a very long time. He had a scar stretching from above his right eye down to his jaw.</p><p> </p><p>What stopped Lupin in his tracks was the boy’s eyes—big and green.</p><p> </p><p>His grip tightened reflexively on the boy’s wrist.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, sir. Please-“ the child cut himself off, ducking his head and looking for all the world as if he were preparing to be struck.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you hungry?” Lupin found himself asking.</p><p> </p><p>“I- no, I’m fine, sir. Please—I can - I’ll get out of your way, Sir, just please don’t tell the police about me!” The boy was begging.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin didn’t care what the boy said, because even his wrist was skeletal. The boy had to be starving.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay, child. I’m not going to report you,” Lupin began. The boy’s shoulders relaxed slightly. “I do want to get you something to eat, and make sure you’ll be safe once I leave you,” Lupin continued.</p><p> </p><p>The boy bit his lip. “I can’t- I can’t pay you, sir. Not with money. I could- do you want to take me somewhere private, or?” His face was guarded, not allowing Lupin to feel the very fear that had the boy’s pulse racing under Lupin’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“No! No, I don’t need payment, child. I just want to get you a solid meal. Please let me buy you a sandwich, or something?”</p><p> </p><p>The boy thought for a long moment, before nodding slightly. This was a testament to how hungry the child must be, for him to be willing to allow a complete stranger to buy him lunch. He clearly was not used to such charity.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin very carefully did <u>not</u> think about the offer the kid had made, and especially did not think about how many people had accepted that offer in the past.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin let go of the boy’s wrist slowly, half expecting him to bolt as soon as he had his arm back. But the child did not.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I ask your name?” Lupin says softly, as he starts leading the boy toward a nearby sandwich shop.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve only ever been called Boy,” the child begins. Lupin nearly trips over his own feet. The child continues as if that declaration wasn’t absolutely tragic. “But I’m pretty sure my name is Harry? That’s what the nice lady calls me in my dreams.”</p><p> </p><p>This time Lupin does trip, but thankfully he catches himself before he actually tumbles.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” he says, not quite a question.</p><p> </p><p>The boy nods. “Can I—will you tell me your name?”</p><p> </p><p>“Remus. Remus Lupin.”</p><p> </p><p>Lupin directs them into the shop, changing the subject briefly to ask what kind of sandwich Harry likes. Harry shrugs, and says that he hasn’t had a proper sandwich in months. Lupin takes this in stride, and orders him a simple ham sandwich. He orders himself a turkey sandwich, and tells Harry he can eat whichever one he likes better.</p><p> </p><p>They sit, waiting for the server to call their number.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you live with people?” Lupin asks.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shrugs. “I used to live with my aunt and uncle, but they—they weren’t nice. When I started school, the teachers asked a lot of questions. A pretty lady came to the house and took me away. Then I was with an even meaner family. So now I live with a couple other kids at a shelter.”</p><p> </p><p>Lupin feels sick.</p><p> </p><p>“What was your aunt’s name?” he asks, aiming for casual and missing by several astronomic units.</p><p> </p><p>“Petunia. And I think- I think maybe my mom’s name was Lily? One time Aunt Petunia was yelling about how ‘Lily’ shoulda never had me.” He shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin goes white. The server calls their number, and Lupin robotically retrieves the food.</p><p> </p><p>Harry falls on his sandwich like a feral animal.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t go so fast, Harry. You’ll make yourself sick,” Lupin cautions him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry very reluctantly slows down enough to actually taste the food.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d like you to stay with me tonight. I want-I want you to be safe, and I want you to meet someone.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry instantly bristles.</p><p> </p><p>“You said you didn’t want any payment!” He protests. “You can’t make me do you <em>and </em>your friend now! That’s no fair!”</p><p> </p><p>Lupin rushes to reassure him. “I don’t want payment. You just- you remind me of my godson. He died eight years ago.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s face softens. “Oh. I’m sorry- I didn’t mean to be rude.”</p><p> </p><p>Lupin brushes this off. “You aren’t being rude. You have the right to defend yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry gives him a look like Lupin is an alien.</p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t I— I don’t want to get your house all dirty. Aunt Petunia always got so mad if I got the house dirty.”</p><p> </p><p>Lupin sighs softly. “I’m not going to get mad at you, Harry. If it makes you feel better, you can take a shower at my place.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry perks up considerably at this. The two finish their sandwiches and head out. Lupin takes a quick moment to shoot Sirius a text.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Bringing home a friend. Do not freak out when you see him. If you scare him, he might bolt. </em>

</p><p>Lupin rolls his eyes at Sirius’s dramatics. He wishes he could give him a better heads up, but there’s no good way to say “your godson that died eight years ago isn’t actually dead and instead he looks like a skeleton and tried to sell me his body” over text. Well, he could say it that way, but he doesn’t think it would go over well.</p><p> </p><p>“My husband will be home,” he tells Harry. “He might act a bit strange, but please don’t feel afraid. He just—“</p><p> </p><p>“If I remind you of your godson, I assume I’ll remind him of the same thing?” Harry suggests. “People are always weird to me. One time this guy dressed entirely in purple came to the shelter and spent about half an hour just staring at me.”</p><p> </p><p>Lupin files that away for later.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin is glad that he only lives a few blocks from where he found Harry. The boy is obviously exhausted.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin is also incredibly guilty that he only lives a few blocks from where he found Harry. How many times had he walked past him without even realizing?</p><p> </p><p>Sirius is waiting on the front step. Lupin gives him a firm look, hoping that his face conveys how much he really doesn’t want Sirius to freak out.</p><p> </p><p>“This is my house, Harry,” he says. The boy looks moderately confused by the concept. Lupin ignores Sirius’s gasp.</p><p> </p><p>“Your house... is rainbow?”</p><p> </p><p>Lupin whirls around and points at Sirius. “I told you that was a bad idea!” He directs his gaze to Harry. “I told him it was strange, that mug- people don’t do that kind of thing!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry snorts.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius is still staring at Harry, his mouth slightly open. “I— this is your friend? I—“</p><p> </p><p>Harry shrugs. “He caught me stealing from him, but I dunno what’s going on because most people would have just hit me or called the cops.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius gapes at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin sighs. “Can we take this inside, Si, I promised Harry a shower and a place to rest.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry does his best not to look too eager for the shower. Experience has taught him that looking happy leads to punishment.</p><p> </p><p>The three of them head inside. Harry tries his best not to touch a single thing, not wanting to get anything dirty.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin and Sirius seem to be having a conversation with facial expressions and hand gestures, so Harry gives himself a minute to evaluate the exits of the house.</p><p> </p><p>There’s the front door behind him, and he doesn’t think either man locked it, so that’s a solid exit. Down the hall he sees what must be the backdoor, but his crappy eyes can’t tell him if it’s locked or not. Windows are almost definitely locked.</p><p> </p><p>He solidifies his escape plan. If things start going south, front door is plan A, back door is plan B, and the windows are plan C. Good.</p><p> </p><p>Having figured that out, Harry relaxes a bit. He looks over to the men and sees them both just watching him. He flushes, not used to people staring without wanting something from him.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin snaps out of it, ushering Harry towards a small but clean bathroom, which has a shower stall in the corner. Lupin grabs a towel from a nearby closet.</p><p> </p><p>“I have some old clothes that just might be small enough to fit you,” Lupin says.</p><p> </p><p>Harry says thank you, and Lupin shows him how to work the faucets, warning Harry that the water might be too hot at first.</p><p> </p><p>Then Remus leaves the room, closing the door softly behind him.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that—is that really him?” Sirius asks as soon as Lupin is in the room.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin nods. Sirius’s knees give out, and Remus quickly grabs him, and deposits him on the couch.</p><p> </p><p>“He says his aunt’s name is Petunia. He thinks his mom’s name is Lily. And—and that she calls him Harry in his dreams,” Lupin says all of this quietly, not wanting Harry to hear, but not willing to actively cast a privacy spell.</p><p> </p><p>“He—what have you told him?” Sirius asks.</p><p> </p><p>“I told him that he reminds me of my late godson, and that that’s why I want to take care of him for a bit. That’s all I can tell him until—until we’re sure.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to have Dumbledore confirm, or...?” Sirius trails off, not sure what else they could do.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin’s face darkens.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry said a man dressed entirely in purple came and just watched him one day,” Remus explains. “Si, I don’t want to think that Dumbledore was hiding him from us, but...”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we don’t need him to confirm, I suppose. I mean, we know the spell, and Merlin knows we have enough of James left in the house,” Sirius says.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think we’d need the spell,” Remus says. “Look at him, he looks just like James.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, Re, but-“ Sirius cuts off when they hear the shower stop. Sirius grabs the nearest book—which happened to be his sketchbook—and Remus goes to gather (and shrink) some clothes. Once they are small enough, he heads over to the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry?” He calls, “I have clothes for you. Can I open the door?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry says yes, so Remus slowly opens the door. Harry’s got himself wrapped in a towel, and he watches Remus’s movements carefully as Remus sets the clothes on the counter.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” Harry says softly as Remus backs out of the room. Remus smiles at Harry and shuts the door.</p><p> </p><p>Harry feels amazing. It has been almost a year since he had a proper shower, since he didn’t really count jumping into the lake as a real bath. His hair feels normal again, and he doesn’t itch from the grime anymore.</p><p> </p><p>He pulls on the clothes Lupin gave him, marveling at the soft fabric. The shirt drowns him, but the pants manage to stay on his hips, so he feels decent.</p><p> </p><p>He walks out into the living room. Sirius is absently doodling in a sketch book, and Remus is in the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, do you like tea?” Remus asks from behind a cupboard door.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know?” Harry says uncertainly.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve never had tea?” Sirius asks, sounding upset.</p><p> </p><p>Harry cringes at the tone, but answers. “I’ve made it plenty of times, but I’ve never actually been allowed to drink it,” he explains.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius’s frown grows stronger, and Harry fidgets.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, Harry,” Remus says. “You can try some, and you can see if you like it or not.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry accepts this and then turns to Remus’s husband.</p><p> </p><p>“I—um—sorry but, what’s your name?” He says. “I don’t think Remus actually told me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius,” the man replies.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m, yeah, I’m serious, Remus didn’t tell me.” Harry is confused as to why this man thinks he’d be asking for his name if he didn’t actually need to.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius bursts into laughter, startling Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“No, my name is Sirius. S-i-r-i-u-s. Like the star.” Sirius chuckles again. “Don’t worry, everyone makes that mistake. I just think it’s funny so I never try to explain ahead of time. Sirius Black, at your service,” he says and gives a mock bow.</p><p> </p><p>Harry nods, but it’s clear that he has no idea why Sirius enjoyed that so much.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Harry, then. Harry Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>Lupin drops a teacup, and it shatters on impact with the floor.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you alright?” Harry asks.</p><p> </p><p>“I—I’m fine. I—I just dropped a cup,” Lupin’s voice is strained.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve done that loads of times,” Harry volunteers. “I did it so many times my uncle stopped hitting me for it and bought cheaper cups instead.”</p><p> </p><p>“Merlin,” Sirius swears. His heart hurts. Did Harry’s family treat him like Sirius’s had treated him? Was it worse than that?</p><p> </p><p>Remus comes in with the tea, handing a cup each to Harry and Sirius.</p><p> </p><p>“...I. I’m starting to think that I might have misunderstood something,” Harry says. “I thought... you sure you’re doing this for free? This is a lot. I don’t want you to turn around and say I owe you later on.”</p><p> </p><p>“How old are you, Harry?” Remus asks in lieu of answering.</p><p> </p><p>“Nine. Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a minor, Harry. A child. There’s no need for payment from a child.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not what my uncle said. He said I always needed to earn everything he ever gave me.” Harry is standing by the door at this point, tense and ready to run at the slightest indication that he’s about to be attacked.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin sighs heavily. “Harry, I think we should start over. My name is Remus Lupin. I work as a social worker for people who have rough lives. My house doubles as a safe space for people when they need a place to stay. It just so happens that you remind me of my godson, but I would have offered you help even if you didn’t. Please stay.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry thinks this over for a few minutes. “If you’re a social worker, doesn’t that mean you have to report me to the cops?”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius interjects at that point. “Actually, no. Remus works for a… private organization. We don’t ever call the cops on people unless we think they are a danger to themselves or others.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry takes a few more minutes to gather up his reply. “That makes sense, I guess. I just don’t want to get sent to another shitty home.”</p><p> </p><p>“Language,” Lupin says automatically, before catching himself. “Sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughs, and it’s the best sound either man has ever heard. “So you really won’t report me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Promise,” Lupin says.</p><p> </p><p>Harry thinks for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re a social worker, does that mean you help people get adopted?”</p><p> </p><p>Lupin shoots a glance at Sirius before answering. “Sometimes, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you help people find their real parents?” Harry continues, trying his best not to look too hopeful.</p><p> </p><p>“It depends on who’s looking and why,” Lupin says cautiously.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Harry says, and leaves it at that. He doesn’t want to ask too many questions, in case Lupin stops wanting to answer them.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>The evening is awkward, to say the least, but Harry is happy to be somewhere warm. Part of him knows that it’s stupid to trust these strangers so easily, but… something in him insists that these people are <em>safe. </em>These people feel oddly familiar, and the child in Harry wants nothing more than to stay in this house forever.</p><p> </p><p>Lupin tells Harry no less than seven times that he is welcome to stay as long as he wants. Harry catches him mumbling some strange words every so often, but as he grows more and more tired, the less he cares.</p><p> </p><p>He just wants to sleep, and to feel safe while doing so. He wants to sleep with both eyes shut, for once in his life.</p><p> </p><p>So he ignores the fear and allows himself to trust. And he has the best night’s sleep he’s had in years.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
