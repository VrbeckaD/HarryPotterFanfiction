    <p>In the small garden of a mundane and ordinary house in Surrey, a young boy was bent over on his knees in the blistering summer sun. He had been weeding for the last four or five hours making up for the time he had been away at school. Sighing as he knew asking for anything after just having returned was not likely to be pleasant. He stood to ask his aunt for a garbage bag, for all the weeds and dead plants he had pulled, his back popped and cracked and he could feel a budding sunburn tighten across his skin.</p><p>“Aunt Petunia may I have a garbage bag for the weeds, please?” He hated how subservient he was to his own family, but as Dumbledore refused to let him live anywhere else he had no choice.</p><p>The only response Petunia deigned to give him was an annoyed grunt as she watched one of her favorite soaps. “Thank you Aunt Petunia.” No response so with relief he grabbed what he needed and returned outside to finish his work. After he’s done with the clean up, he waters the plants and adds a note to his shopping list to buy more seeds to both plant and for the bird feeder which was getting low.</p><p>“Is there anything else you need me to do before I go to the store, Aunt Petunia?”</p><p>“You finished with the yard and the fence?” Sweet Merlin, her voice was shrill, he wondered if it was natural or if she did it on purpose.</p><p>“Yes.” He replied. “I have to pick up new flower seeds and fertilizer, though. Do you want any specific kind?”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes trying to figure out if he was being smart with her, but she found no attitude. “Orchids.” She loved picking the hardest plants to care for, so that if he failed she could follow suit with punishments for wasting her money.</p><p>“Does color matter?”</p><p>“No, and quit dawdling, you have to be back in time to make dinner!”</p><p>“Yes, Ma’am.” He replied softly. He knew she was beginning to think they had finally broken his will, and he let them think that because it meant fewer beatings and a possibility of more food in his stomach. As long as he obeyed he could scheme a way out of their house, out of the life of the "Boy-Who-Lived", and into a life he actually might want to live. He knew there was little chance of him ever escaping this life, but he refused to give up dreaming of the possibility.</p><p>As he left the house with his list in his pocket, he looked up. There wasn’t a cloud in sight and the sun continue to glare uninterrupted. He sighed, it was going to be a long walk with this June heat.</p><p>.o0o.<br/> Two grocery bags, a bag of orchid seeds, and a bag of fertilizer later Harry was trudging home. He had also got a bottle of sunscreen for his budding sunburn. He entered through the backyard gate so he could set the garden stuff down and his sunscreen in the back pocket of his trousers before going inside. Petunia having decided on chicken and potatoes with peach cobbler for dessert, he quickly got started.</p><p>After the family finished their meal Harry asked if it was satisfactory, Vernon’s only reply was a grunt that he took as a yes which meant he was allowed to eat the leftovers. With his meager diner on a plate for later he started washing the dishes carefully as he didn’t want a repeat of the day he got back. He had dropped a plate and his back still had the welts from the belt.</p><p>Once he was done cleaning the dining room and kitchen he took his plate upstairs to his room, and locked the door. Immediately going to Hedwig’s cage and opened it so that she could have her pick of the scraps. She hopped out and sat on his leg starring at their meal in reproach. “Sorry girl, it’s all we have for the moment until Mrs. Weasley sends some rations. Though it shouldn’t be too long, and then we’ll have mince pie, treacle tart, and enough food to last us till school!” While Harry had already lost weight since leaving Hogwarts, he made sure Hedwig always had enough. She was his first real friend and he refused to let her suffer because of him.</p><p>They finished eating she went back to her cage while he got ready for bed. “Goodnight Hedwig.” His head had barely touched the pillow before he was out like a light.</p><p>.o0o.</p><p>He asleep one second and awake the next. Unsure what it was exactly that startled him from the first dreamless sleep he’d had in a long while he lay their listening to the early morning. He shifted slightly and realized what had woken him. His skin itched like mad. It felt like it had ants crawling all over.</p><p>Leaping from bed, he ran to the hall bathroom as quietly as possible locking the door behind him and immediately ran the shower on lukewarm. Harry climbed in with a soft sigh of appreciation as the water soothed his irritated skin. Gently he used a soaped washcloth over his upper back. He felt his skin move and peel away from his body, but the feeling of the cloth against his new skin was odd. Kind of slippery, actually.</p><p>After he set the cloth down he carefully touched the area that felt different. Scales. Scales! Scales?! He scrambled out of the shower and turned his back to the mirror. His skin was bubbling and hanging from his back in ragged strips while dark blue and gold scales lined his spine. Climbing on the edge of the tub so that he could see lower when he realized it wasn’t just his back, it was everything below his belly button. As he continued to pull away dead skin more and more scales showed, and he realized they weren’t just blue and gold, they were green scattered amongst the rest. He wondered if he was somehow changing into a snake, a colorful one. How can one just turn into a snake?</p><p>Very suddenly he became aware the others in the house were moving around and tried not to panic. Throwing on his clothes he rushed to clean up his mess and make it back to his room before the others came knocking. Once in his room he searched his meager closet for something that would cover everything, finally settling on a baggy long-sleeve and sweats. After rushing down stairs, Harry started on breakfast all the while panicking despite his best efforts- not that the others noticed. He could have been on fire and the wouldn’t have noticed or at least not cared.</p><p>He wasn’t allowed breakfast, because he burnt some of the pancakes in the midst of his inner turmoil. Back upstairs he dug out some writing supplies, then doled out a quick request for books on creature transformations, creature inheritances, and magical diseases as soon as possible.</p><p>Once he had sent Hedwig off with a promise to sneak her some scraps, he hurried down to receive his chore list for the day.</p>
