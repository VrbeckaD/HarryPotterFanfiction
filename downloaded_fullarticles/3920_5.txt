          <div class="userstuff"><p>We’d only just received our Hogwarts letter when Mom called us downstairs. We’d only just told her the good news when she loaded us in the family car and climbed into the driver’s seat. We played games while she drove, laughing and talking. She didn’t join us but we kept ourselves company and London’s city streets flew past the windows as we counted light posts and funny hats. The lady who checked us in was nice but she looked at us funny before assigning us a room.</p><p>I’ve only just left the hospital two months ago. Just me.</p></div>
