          <div class="userstuff"><p>The first bisexual Prime Minister was not elected, so much as he was brought to power by a series of backdoor channels at the hands of his most trusted advisors. The fixer, Draco Malfoy, his Undersecretary, Pansy Parkinson, his wife, Ginevra, and a former Member of Parliament Minerva McGonagall.  </p>
<p>Not that Harry <em>knew </em>any of this of course. The four had sworn themselves to secrecy, to keep quiet their betrayal. There were many secrets the four had kept over the course of Harry’s tenure as PM. Sometimes from one another, sometimes from Harry, sometimes from even themselves. But there were some secrets, that were just accepted among the four. Like the love-affair between Harry and Draco.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Ginevra had been furious, but her frustrations and feelings of betrayal had died rather quickly. After all, she had never <em>wanted </em>to be the wife of a PM. She wanted to be PM herself. A fact which was well known in Parliament. </p>
<p>Harry was sat, alone in his office, a rarity these days, drinking a whiskey and thinking about the conversation he had had with Draco earlier that day. After their latest tryst.</p>
<p>“We need to stop this,” Draco had said.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Harry asked, pulling on his t-shirt.</p>
<p>“You have a wife,” Draco growled, pulling on his trousers, and looking for his shoes.</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“And kids.”</p>
<p>“I had all of those things when we started this whole thing. And it’s not as if Ginny doesn’t know.”</p>
<p>Draco had sighed, shaking his head, “You’re losing support in the Commons,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?” Harry had asked, blinking. He hadn’t heard anything about it from Pansy.</p>
<p>“The Chancellor of the Exchequer is planning a coup,” Draco added.</p>
<p>Harry had laughed at that, “Nott? I hardly think I have to worry about that.”</p>
<p>“He’s gaining support,” Draco had said, looking gravely serious.</p>
<p>“When were you planning on telling me this?” Harry demanded.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think it would become this serious,” Draco admitted. “But he has <em>implied </em>he knows things. Things that could bring you down, and the party with it.”</p>
<p>Harry had glared, “So? You’re the fixer, fix it!”</p>
<p>Draco had snorted at that, “I am!” he said through clenched teeth, and with that, he had stormed out of the Minister’s office in Number 10.</p>
<p>Harry still wasn’t over it, Draco had really left, and this time, for good. It wasn’t the first time they had had a row like this, but this one felt different somehow. It felt, permanent.  Harry was worried. Giving up all pretense of trying to get any work done despite the late hour, Harry picked up his phone and dialed Draco’s number. It was one of the few he knew by heart.</p>
<p>The phone rang, once, twice, by the fourth ring, Harry half wondered if Draco might not answer.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Draco answered, his voice was ragged, and raw, as though he might have been crying.</p>
<p>“I miss you,” Harry replied.</p>
<p>Draco snorted, “It’s been less than ten hours.”</p>
<p>“I love you,” Harry replied.</p>
<p>“Goodnight, Prime Minister,” Draco said by way of reply.</p>
<p>“Wait,” Harry said, pausing to wait and see if Draco would actually hang up on him. He didn’t, and Harry smiled weakly. “I don’t have to stay you know.”</p>
<p>“What?” Draco asked.</p>
<p>“I can leave… Parliament. Downing Street, I don’t <em>have </em>to be Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>Draco snorted, “Are you aware, the work that went into getting you elected Prime Minister? The countless, <em>hours, </em>everyone put into your campaign. And you wanna step down now? Why, because you can’t see your little boy toy anymore?”</p>
<p>“You know that’s not what this is,” Harry growled.</p>
<p>Draco huffed, “You told me to handle it. That is, <em>after all,</em> my job. That’s what I do. I serve at the pleasure of the Prime Minister and clean up your messes like I’m your mother. Well guess what Harry, it’s handled!” this time, the line did go dead, and Harry stared at his phone, angrily.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>Across London, several miles away from 10 Downing Street, Draco Malfoy was sat in his flat, laying in bed trying to push all thoughts of the Prime Minister out of his mind. He hadn’t fought this hard to get Harry elected for him to bloody give up now. <em>It hadn’t even been a full bloody term yet!</em> He thought furiously.</p>
<p>Draco climbed into bed, with a glass of wine and tried to go to sleep, when his phone rang for the second time that night. Draco groaned, staring at his phone. It was the Chancellor. <em>Bugger, </em>Draco picked it up.</p>
<p>“Have you considered my offer yet?” Nott asked.</p>
<p>Draco snorted, “Theodore,” he said.</p>
<p>“You’re going to make him step down Malfoy,” Nott spat. “Or I’ll take down the whole damn Parliament. You know I can do it. I know things, things your precious Prime Minister wouldn’t want to get out.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that deal is no longer on the table Mr. Nott. You see, there is nothing going on between me and the Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>At this, Nott laughed, “Oh baby. I’ve got more info than just that. You think I would lead with my best work? No no, see you have a little leak in your house. A leak that says Potter’s Ministry isn’t even legitimate. It seems some Members of Parliament were offered things in exchange for their cooperation.”</p>
<p>Draco growled, half wanting to throw his phone against the wall, “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he lied.</p>
<p>Nott laughed again, “I’m sure you don’t. But someone seems to think there’s enough evidence that it could topple Harry’s little administration like a house of cards.”</p>
<p>“And you think somehow, <em>I </em>could possibly convince Harry to leave his position? Two years in?”</p>
<p>“No one has the Minister’s ear like you do,” Nott replied. “I suggest you get together with him in the next twenty-four hours, or I’ll take this to the press,” the line went dead and Draco screamed. This time he <em>did </em>throw his phone against the wall, in a fit of rage. Everything was falling apart.</p>
<p>He needed bigger firepower, he knew. The biggest firepower in the government. Draco groaned, picking up his house phone, and dialed.</p>
<p>“Draco,” Lucius said, he could hear his father’s usual smirk on the other end of the line. “How are you?”</p>
<p>“I need a favor,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Naturally,” Lucius replied. “God forbid you call your father just to chat. See how I’m doing. See how my tenure at the British Museum is going.”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“It’s going great by the way. We just got in some new rare artifacts.”</p>
<p>Draco sighed, “Father,” he cut in.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Lucius asked.</p>
<p>“We should have dinner together sometime,” he said. “Catch up, properly.”</p>
<p>“I’d like that,” Lucius replied. “I’ll get us reservations. How’s the PM?” Draco barely resisted the urge to snort. Of course, his father would bring it to that. </p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>
<p>At this, Lucius snorted, “Of course not. Well, I will see you tomorrow. Eight sharp. Don’t be late,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes father,” Draco hung up the phone and sighed, scrubbing his face with his hands. <em>Dinner with his father, what a bloody disaster.</em></p>
<p>Draco didn’t go into work the next day. Malfoy and Associates would just have to last a day without him, he thought. He needed time to mentally prepare himself for dinner with his father. A week would have been better preparation, but he would take what he could get, and at present, a few hours would have to suffice.</p>
<p>Draco barely ate breakfast or lunch, so by the time dinner had rolled around he was considerably more hungry than he had realized, not that he wanted to <em>eat </em>with his father. Dinner was never about food, it was always about business. Still, Draco could play the part.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Draco got into his car and headed towards the restaurant his father had texted him the address for earlier that day.</p>
<p>Sitting down at the table, Draco was pleased to find there was already wine awaiting his arrival.</p>
<p>“Good to see you again Draco,” his father said.</p>
<p>“Good to see you as well,” Draco replied. It was not altogether untrue. His relationship with his father was complicated at best, still, Lucius was an important ally at present, and Draco <em>needed </em>his expertise. Officially, Lucius Malfoy was the lead curator for the British Museum, unofficially he was one of the top bosses for Z13, the unheard of, unspeakable of, hand behind the crown. Lucius knew where all the bodies were buried and more importantly where to bury new ones, when necessary.</p>
<p>“I trust you’re doing well,” Lucius said.</p>
<p>Draco took a sip of wine and nodded. “How’s the museum?”</p>
<p>“Oh you know, old,” he replied with a smile. “So, why are you really here?”</p>
<p>“Theodore Nott,” Draco replied.</p>
<p>“I’m familiar.”</p>
<p>“He’s trying to lead a coup. I’m worried that would destabilize things.”</p>
<p>Lucius raised an eyebrow at that, “What things?”</p>
<p>Draco gave his father a look.</p>
<p>“Draco don’t tell me you’ve gone so soft that you’re calling your old man to do your dirty work because of your boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Draco said. “I’m not…” he lowered his voice. “Harry and I aren’t together.”</p>
<p>Lucius snorted, “Right.”</p>
<p>“Believe me or don’t, can you do something about Nott?”</p>
<p>Lucius smiled, “You know I can.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Draco said. The server came by a few moments later to deliver their food.</p>
<p>“I took the liberty of ordering for you,” Lucius said taking a sip of wine. “You really don’t eat enough,” he added.</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes, tucking into his salad first. “Now, you’re concerned,” he snorted.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been concerned for you Draco. The day you came out to me, I told you, I love you, and you will always be my son, but you will have an uphill battle for respect from others. Especially in politics.” Draco nodded. “If you wanted to be anything in the world, I would support you. But this… the Prime Minister’s whore… that I will not accept. So I <em>hope </em>for your sake that your little tryst with him <em>is </em>done,” and with that Lucius got up from the table and left.</p>
<p>Draco sighed, finishing off his meal, that had gone better than he’d hoped, he thought. </p>
<p>Making his way back to his flat, Draco crawled into bed with a bottle of wine and fell asleep almost instantly. </p>
<p>The world awoke the next morning to the news that Theodore Nott was dead of an alleged overdose, Draco read the headline, while he sipped his morning coffee. Whatever else could be said about his father, he was damn efficient.</p>
