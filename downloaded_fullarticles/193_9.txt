    <p>The first time Mycroft Holmes had met Lady Potter-Black, she was being awarded the Victoria Cross- the UK's highest honor.</p><p>Mycroft was one of the <em>very</em> few Muggles 'in the know' about the Wizarding World. The Queen, the Prime Minister, and himself were the only ones informed of it's existence (unless they had a Muggleborn in the family).</p><p>He had to say, he was <em>not</em> impressed.</p><p>The majority of the Magicals that he had met were <em>worse </em>than goldfish! They were the veriest <em>sheep, </em>cowering behind a young girl, and living in the Dark Ages.</p><p>The girl herself, however, fascinated him.</p><p>Lorelai Potter-Black, Countess of Blackmoor, was born Lorelai Carina Potter on July 31st, 1980. Her Father, Lord James Potter, was a minor Baron of the small Village of Godric's Hollow in Wales. Her Mother was a commoner named Lily Potter, nee Evans.</p><p>James was from an Ancient And Noble House in the Wizarding World. Mycroft had since learned that some Titles held over into the Muggle World. James Potter's was one of them.</p><p>After her birth, Lorelai was Blood Adopted by her Godfather, Sirius Black. For all intents and purposes, Lorelai had three parents. She became Sirius' Heiress Apparent, as he had been kicked out and disowned by his Mother, but <em>not </em>his Grandfather Lord Black, Earl of Blackmoor. Black's Title was higher than the Potters', and also carried over into the normal world. After the adoption, Lorelai became a Potter-Black.</p><p>Unfortunately, War was upon the Wizarding World. A terrorist in the same mold as Hitler, called Lord Voldemort, was killing everyone who opposed his views on Pureblood Superiority.</p><p>The Potters would have already been a target. Due to their views on equality, and James' marriage to a Muggleborn, they were already in Voldemort's sights.</p><p>A Prophesy, however, sealed their Fate.</p><p>A so-called 'Death Eater' had overheard a Prophesy that stated a child born at the end of July would have the power to defeat the Dark Lord.</p><p>Voldemort was made aware of two children who met that criteria. Neville Longbottom, who was born on July 30, and Lorelai.</p><p>Voldemort immediately focused on Potter. Was it because she was a Half-Blood like him? Because she was born late in the evening on the 31st? No one knew the reason, except for Voldemort.</p><p>The Potters went into hiding, using a spell to hide their location. Mycroft felt that this was a very flawed plan, considering the entire thing was based on <em>trust, </em>with no back-up plan.</p><p>It was assumed for many years that Sirius Black wss the Secret Keeper for the Potters. On October 31st, 1981, Lord Voldemort received the Potter's location from a traitor.</p><p>He moved immediately to attack. His goal? To kill the entire Potter Family.</p><p>Voldemort made quick work of Lord Potter, who was not holding his wand as The Dark Lord entered. He then killed Lily Potter, who begged him to spare her daughter.</p><p>Voldemort then turned his wand onto Lorelai Potter-Black, his prophesied, future nemesis. He uttered a spell that had <em>never </em>failed to kill, aimed directly at the baby girl.</p><p>No one was sure what happened next. All anyone was sure of, was that Lorelai survived, and Voldemort disappeared.</p><p>Lorelai Potter-Black was hailed a Savior. She was given the Title of The Girl- Who- Lived. As the Wizarding World celebrated, Lorelai was being left on a doorstep.</p><p>Her story could have gone differently, but the Queen intervened.</p><p>No matter <em>what </em>she was to wizards, she was still a member of the Nobility. She had Estates, and employees. She would have to be raised to fulfill her obligations, and that would not happen in her commoner Aunt's home.</p><p>After a legal battle, the young Heiress was placed with the Spencer family. Lord Spencer's daughter Diana had just married Prince Charles. What was not widely known, was that the Spencers descended from a squib line of the Peverell Family, who the Potters were related to. The relationship was so distant as to be almost non-existent, but it was enough for the Queen.</p>
<hr/><p>Growing up, Lorelai was raised by Diana's brother Charles, and was a frequent guest of Prince Charles and Diana. She was a cherished member of the family.</p><p>When William was born in 1982, Lorelai became somewhat of a big Sister to him, and to Harry when he arrived.</p><p>In 1991, everything seemed to start falling apart. Charles and Diana's marriage had been rocky for years, and the fights were becoming more frequent.</p><p>This was also the year that Lorelai started Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The Queen had made sure she was prepared for the Wizarding World, and she had been taught the Culture and Etiquette of both worlds.</p><p>The school years of Potter-Black were mainly Classified. Yes, even for him! The only thing he knew for sure, was that Voldemort had never died. When he came back, everyone looked to The Girl- Who- Lived to save them. </p><p>She was only 14.</p><p>Four years, and many deaths later, Lorelai Potter-Black ended Voldemort's cursed existence for good. Ending the War, and countless attacks on the Muggles of Britain.</p><p>She had lost her innocent Godfather, a Godfather figure, friends, and almost all of her family to Voldemort and the Death Eaters.</p><p>Diana, one of the only Mother figures she had ever known, had died less than a year before the death of Voldemort.</p><p>Even though Lady Potter-Black was not a member of the Military, the Queen had inducted her into Her Majesty's Secret Service before she left for her Sixth Year. This was why she was receiving the Victoria Cross instead of the George Cross.</p><p>Lorelai was only <em>just </em>19.</p>
<hr/><p>When Mycroft thought of Lorelai Potter-Black, he had expected her to look like a child. In the time between the pictures of her at Diana's funeral and now, she had surely blossomed into a beautiful woman. </p><p>At the funeral, Lorelai was stick thin, almost emaciated. She had had to be physically supported by Diana's brother, Charles.</p><p>Now she was petite, but curvy. Her body was every inch a woman's. Her long, curly black hair was in a sophisticated updo, and she was dressed modestly, yet flatteringly. Her posture was perfect, and she wore her Nobility like armour, carrying a dignity about her that was ingrained into her psyche.</p><p>She had always been close to Prince Charles, and Lord Spencer. Charles had always wanted a little girl, and Lorelai was as close as he had. Both men looked suitably proud, and she seemed uniquely able to keep the Peace between the two men, who had no love lost between them.</p><p>After the Queen gave her the Award, a reception followed. Mycroft was introduced to Lady Potter-Black by the Queen, Herself.</p><p>"Mr. Holmes, We would like to introduce you to our 'Niece'. Mycroft Holmes, may We present Lady Lorelai Potter-Black, Countess of Blackmoor, Barroness of Godric's Hollow." The Queen introduced her protege to her Right Hand.</p><p>"It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Potter-Black. Thank you for your service to our fair Commonwealth." Mycroft said, bowing over her extended hand, and kissing the air above it.</p><p>In the Wizarding World, it was considered an insult to let your lips touch the hand of a Lady to whom you are not engaged. Her beautiful green eyes widened slightly, correctly reading his knowledge through his actions.</p><p>"Likewise, Mr. Holmes. Your reputation precedes you." Lorelai said, nodding her head to him.</p><p>"You have both provided exemplary service to the United Kingdom, and have the love of Country in common. We believe you may find other common ground." The Queen said, and Lorelai almost groaned.</p><p>Aunt Lilibet was almost certainly matchmaking! Rory looked Mycroft over, subtly. He was tall, with a slightly stocky build. His light gray eyes were sharp, and penetrating. His black, wavy hair was short, and slicked back. Yes, she found Mycroft attractive, but he was obviously much older than her. He probably thought her nothing more than a child.</p><p>Mycroft was sure he was reading the situation correctly, but it seemed absurd. His Monarch was trying to set him up with someone almost half his age! He <em>knew </em>he was correct (he always was). What he wasn't sure of was <em>why?</em></p><p>Mycroft was a powerful man, but only in the shadows. Though wealthy, the Holmes family was also not Nobility. He was honest with himself enough to admit that she was out of his league, completely.</p><p>Lorelai was very young, and unspeakably lovely. She also had her own wealth, and Title. He had nothing to offer her.</p><p>He was tall, yes. But he was also thicker around the middle than he would like. His wavy, black hair was starting to thin, and he had a very stern countenance. He was by no means a prize to any pretty, young thing.</p><p>Mycroft also knew his desires, needs, and weaknesses.</p><p>He was attracted to power, intelligence, and beauty. Lorelai Potter-Black had all three in spades. She also obviously believed in service to Queen and Country, and had seen and experienced more than any delicate Lady should. That had to make her older than her years would suggest.</p><p>She would make a perfect wife. Beautiful, cultured, and refined. He had often thought lately that some things would be much easier with a suitable wife. Social obligations, household matters, and <em>physical comfort </em>to name a few. </p><p>Not to mention, getting Mummy off his back.</p><p>Mycroft decided to tread carefully, yet pursue the possibility. He even had the Queen's approval, it seemed.</p><p>He would have to do some research on Courting Customs in the Wizarding World, but that was a small price to pay. The question was, was Potter-Black interested?</p><p>There was only one way to find out.</p>
