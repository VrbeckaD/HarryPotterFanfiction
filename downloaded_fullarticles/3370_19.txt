    <p>            “You will write to me, won’t you?” Lily asked in a quiet voice. She was standing at the train station in one of her finest Sunday dresses. It was green, complimenting her eyes perfectly.</p><p>            “Of course.” James replied softly. “How could I not, I know you stuffed a whole bunch of parchment in my bag.” He teased.</p><p>            “Just in case.” Lily blushed a bit. She swallowed and reached up to straighten the tie of his uniform. “I hate to say how nice you look.” She said.</p><p>            James noticed his fiancée’s hand shaking. “Hey, I’ll be back and we’ll get married.” He promised. “As long as you’re still going to wait for me.” He smirked. He just wanted to see her smile, not see her as upset as she was.</p><p>            Lily laughed nervously and shook her head. “Never, Captain Potter. I’ll be waiting for you for years if I have to.” She promised.</p><p>            “Well, I’m going to win this war in a few days so it won’t be long.” He replied with a wink.  </p><p>            Lily wanted to smile but her heartache was too painful. She reached up to place a hand on his cheek. “Stay safe please.” She whispered.</p><p>            “I’ll think ‘what would Lily say’ before I do anything.” James promised. “I love you lots.” He bent down a bit to kiss her.</p><p>            Lily wrapped her arms around his neck as if it could make him stay. Tears ran down her cheeks and pressed against his as they kissed deeply for what could have been the last time. They didn’t know and that’s what was so scary.</p><p>            The train whistle blew and the crowd started to mobilize. James parted from Lily with one more kiss. “I love you.” He said again before turning and disappearing into the crowd.</p><p>            Lily watched to see if she could catch another glimpse of him. She clutched her handkerchief tightly. There was no sign of her messy haired fiancée though. Eventually the train chugged down the rails and people started to file out of the station. Lily stayed for another hour though, just standing at the edge of the platform. Maybe they would return…maybe the war was over and they just didn’t know it…maybe they’d return James…maybe they’d send him home.</p><p>           </p><p>            It was December of 1939 and Britain was at war. Men were being called to service and leaving their families behind. James Potter left his school sweetheart, Lily Evans, whom he vowed to marry. He didn’t know it at the time but she was three months pregnant. She wanted to wait to tell him and then war struck their country.</p><p> </p><p>            <em>Dear Lily, </em></p><p>
  <em>            Everything’s all right here. It’s a bit chaotic but I haven’t seen much action. There are a lot of my mates from university here, believe it or not. You probably wouldn’t recognize them in their uniforms. You remember Remus and Sirius right? They were shocked when I told them we were getting married. Thought you’d have found some rich Oxford professor to marry. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>            Anyways, how’re things in London? Are you getting along fine? I miss home even though it’s only been a week. I guess it’s really you I miss. I’d be fine anywhere else in the world if you were there with me. D’you mind sending a picture? I want to keep you near me. You’re my angel, after all. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>            Stay safe, I’ll be home soon, love, I promise, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>            James. </em>
</p><p>           </p><p>            <em>Dearest James, </em></p><p>
  <em>            You can tell Sirius and Remus that I much prefer James Potter to a stuffy Oxford professor. Honestly, do they even know my personality? I believe I’d get into far too many arguments with someone like that. I’m quite happy with marrying you. So that means you must come home to do so. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>            Things are okay here. Too many of my friends are losing their husbands to the draft as well. I suppose it’s for the best, the more men there the faster we can end this. People are starting to panic. They’re rationing food and some mothers are sending their children into the countryside. They’re afraid of bombing. I’ll admit I’m terrified too. They run drills like the false alarm back in September, remember that? They’re far more real now and I wake up fearing death. It’s not pleasant. I attached a picture so you have to return the favor. I want to frame a picture of you in your uniform. My mum suggested it; she has one of dad from the first war. Bless his soul; you better not end up like him. I have some news for you, so write back and guess what it is.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>            Love, </em>
  <em>Lily</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>            </em>“She’s probably leaving you, that’s the only news I can think of.” Sirius said after James had read the last part of Lily’s most recent letter.</p><p>            “Shut it, she’s not leaving me.” James shoved his best friend.</p><p>            “It’s probably something that’s not important.” Arthur replied. “She got a new dress or something, that’s all Molly’s talked about since she started writing to me.”</p><p>            “Lils isn’t like that.” James shook his head. “It has to be something important…”</p><p>            “Mate, she’s probably pregnant.” Remus said, the smartest of the bunch he was observant of what James told him about Lily.</p><p>            “Pregnant?” James looked alarmed. “No, no she’s not pregnant.” He shook his head. “That’s not possible.”</p><p>            “You’ve only been gone for like what, two months?” Sirius nodded in agreement. “It could be possible.”</p><p>            James felt sick to his stomach. If they were right then he was halfway across the world while she was pregnant with his child. He had no means of taking care of them and no way to make sure they were okay at all times. He wrote back that night and tried to get the letter sent out as soon as he could. </p>
