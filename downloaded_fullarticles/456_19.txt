    <p>It was the same things day in and day out, slowly things were dying, a once beautiful world becoming a shadow of it's former self. Harry Potter really felt hallow inside, by this point in his life he was the only one left with a magical core strong enough to weather the problems. Helping who he could with it, in the hopes some species would survive the onslaught of prejudices. He once had this silly idea that once Tom Riddle was gone, things would look up. But, he was wrong, it started with small things, having all werewolves come forward if they once were apart of the dark lords plot. He never saw what happened to them, his only guess was a silver sword to the neck. </p><p>Next came the imprisonment and death of Death Eaters, whether they were apart of it or no. Harry tried to save who he could, but found out even his words fell on death ears. Slowly, they killed out the older families, and the Minister took the money from their vaults. 'War Contributions' as they claimed. Harry felt disgusted with it all, especially the fact his own friends agreed to it.</p><p>One argument with Ginny showed him just how sick her mind was. She thought many creatures were filthy, and because they sided with a Dark Lord, even though he possibly would have killed them had they nod, that made them 'Evil'. Harry called off their engagement, Ginny threatening he'd be the next Dark Lord, she could make it so. Then he'd be dead, and the money all hers </p><p>That was how Harry came to isolate himself, Luna still came over, lovely Luna, who never once expected anything of him other than friendship. And Her husband Nevile, loyal as ever to him and their friendship as well. He knew... he knew in this new 'World Order' they'd never survive. He tried to tell them, gods he tried to tell them, but it fell on deaf ears. Perhaps they knew also their time was nearing, for the last weeks with them were filled with love and happiness. Then it ended when they were killed for being near 'Dark Lord Potter'. </p><p>Harry didn't know how long he cried for them, how long he sat motionless staring at the paper's headlines. This was the final straw, so he took to books, he searched, and listened to how each creature was snuffed out, and few were sold as 'pets' to the elite. Only serving to hallow out his heart more.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he sighed softly and sadly. This world was once beautiful to him, new and exciting, magic was real. Now, with their war path, and Ron, shockingly he made Minister and remarried, at the head the world was dying. Some say his wife died of dragon pox, Harry knew better, oh Hermione he was so sorry for not seeing the signs. His hands ran over the pages, his only chance. </p><p>With the news now peddling the 'Dark Lord Potter' shit, any place wouldn't have him. Afraid he would just use them to gather followers. He shook his head at that, and got to work. In the days that followed that, he was getting people trying to break his ward system. He laugh humorlessly at that, by the time they did, he'd be long gone. </p><p>Standing in the circle of black and white paint, he sat down cross legged, pushing his magic into the ruin. He closed his eyes, either death would come, or he'd wake up in another room. There was a loud bang, thundering footsteps, the door opened. Then nothing, sweet nothingness.</p><p>-0-0-0-0-</p><p>To anyone who was there, they would have saw a circle of black sludge in the place Harry Potter once sat and from it crawled a creature that only sought one thing. Food.</p><p>It's horrid skull face, red eyes, and black fur was all these wizard saw. Tearing of teeth and claws was the last thing they felt. And from that pool came more and more. Muggles had long found out about magic, they had been plotting to bomb their places, because some dipshit leader saw them as 'threats'. </p><p>The world was dying...</p><p>Harry Potter? No one saw him since that day these demons showed up.</p><p>-0-0-0-0-</p><p>It wasn't painful, it wasn't warm, it wasn't bright. It was dark, just dark, like water as Harry opened his eyes to the blackness. He felt hard sand and rocks, the sky was a dark purplish pink, no grass, no trees, just jagged rocks. He sat up slowly, the wind now howled in a creepy, yet calm tone.</p><p>"So you've awaken." a deep voice said as Harry turned his head to the sound. He just saw what should be a man, no face features, a top his head was curved horns, his entire body was a deep purple, and he was much much taller than Harry. Then again, years of abuse still hadn't been fixed, and Harry was very small for anyone in their late twenties. </p><p>The man waved his hand, "Come, sit, and speak traveler. It's been so long since one of your kind has come willing to my realm." he said, Harry climbed to his feet, finding he was in a black shirt and pants, guess it's better than being naked before some stranger. </p><p>Hesitantly, and a little cautious he walked over. The man gave a chuckle, "My brother certainly did give you some of my personality in your making. If I had wanted to hurt you, Harry Potter, I would have done so by now." he waved his hand casually.</p><p>Harry blinked as he sat on the now conjured black chair, "You know my name?" he asked slowly.</p><p>The beings eyeless areas seemed to look at him, "I know everything about you, I did have a hand in making you." he mused, raising an 'eyebrow' at him. "I know of your past, what you've endured, and I've waited a long time for the moment you decided your world wasn't worth it anymore."</p><p>For his part, Harry was confused, the god being, which he guessed this guy was as he talked of creating him, sighed at that a little annoyed. "I suppose I'll have to explain myself to you, if your expression is anything to go by."</p><p>Sitting in the throne chair across form hair, that to the left over saw a pool of darkness. "You like?" he chuckled, "I can see the fascination of my land in your eyes. I made this plane of existence my home after leaving my last. They don't look as alike as I wanted, but it does well." he mused looking at the pool in thought. </p><p>"Sir," Harry said, "are you a god?" he asked him.</p><p>A humorous, deep laugh came form him, "Yes, observant you are, yes Harry, I am the God of Darkness and Destruction." he tilted his head at that, "You show no fear in me, a good sign as any."</p><p>Harry scoffed, "I've faced death too many times to count, no offence sir." he looked at the Dark God, who was leaning on his hand eyeing Harry.</p><p>"Yes, Fate does so love to make our chosen suffer, a right bitch it is." he scowled it seemed, then he shook his head, "I'm getting ahead of myself, to start Harry, what do you know of magic?" he asked him curiously, placing both elbows on the table and leaning on them.</p><p>The other blinked at this, then looked thoughtful, "I know it's something only few people in my world are born with. Through inbreeding it be snuffed out entirely, and can reemerge later in life in what they call 'Muggle-Borns'." he told the god, who hummed at that.</p><p>"What else?" he pressed.</p><p>Harry bit his lip for a moment, "I know it's stronger in some people than in others, and some people are gifted more than others. And that is can defy logic easily, and make things that reality can't." he looked at him.</p><p>The Dark God nodded to this leaning back again, "You seem to know your basics and then some." he said honestly, "What you don't know is that I was the one who gifted magic to your people." </p><p>At his expression, the other chuckled, "Yes, after leaving one world, my brother and I moved around alot to other realms. Deciding to do more projects, some succeeded, and some, like yours, failed. We have no been back to our original world in a long time."</p><p>Harry tilted is head, "Mine failed?" he asked curiously.</p><p>The god nodded to this, "We had hoped by making you directly, that things would look up. We made you like us, my brother gave you compassion and forgiveness. I gave you your cautious nature and temper." he smirked a bit, "Then we gave you our gifts, I gave you powerful magic, more than any human at the time, and he gave you incredible luck. It was our hope that you should be able to help this world from it's plung." there was a sigh that escaped him, "Yet, outside forces that we didn't foresee lead you astray, and now here we are."</p><p>"Outside.... Dumbledore." he looked away bitterly.</p><p>He heard the popping of knuckles as the God of Darkness made a fist, "Yes that old bastard." he said coldly, his tone one of hate. "He came to me a long time before you, giving me a plead for power. In my hast to finally have someone to prayed to me, I gave it to him. Not knowing that it would lead to him becoming something even worse than the power hungry man I saw. My brother gave me heat for that, and I knew it was my mistake." shaking his head, "So I sought to make up for it, with you. But, we failed this time to see just how far the old mans reach went."</p><p>Tilting his head again at Harry, "So I waited, I knew in time the world would be destroyed, but I waited for you're choice. I gave you the power this time, should you have chosen to leave, my brother and I knew the world was beyond saving. In truth, Harry, you were the only reason we hadn't already. I suppose, we did become attached to you." he said in a dismissive tone, yet Harry could tell it was the truth. </p><p>"Why is that?" Harry asked, now a bit curious.</p><p>He hummed at that, eyes and 'cheeks' moving as if thoughtful, "I believe my brother said, 'He will be everything we hoped humanity would have been'." he shrugged at that. "I'd have to agree with him, you are caring to those who deserve it, never once have you judged others unless they gave you reason to feel such, and despite differences, you strove for the betterment of all. You're by no means perfect, but you aimed to make the world as perfect as possible."</p><p>Emerald eyes looked at the god at that, then at the pool of darkness in thought. "May I ask a question?" he asked him.</p><p>"You already have, but go on." he said in some humor. </p><p>Harry gazed back at him, "The Deathly Hallows, what are they?" he asked.</p><p>A sigh came from the being, "I thought you'd might ask about them." he waved his hands as the three items floated in front of them, "Creations of my own, where my brother make the relics, I made the Hallows. Another impulse thing I guess you could say, the test the first three humans we made on their planet. So you can guess, it didn't end will for all but one." he shook his head. "Master of Death is just a title, in truth, the one who holds all of these and can use them properly became one of mine. I don't have many followers, most humans fear me."</p><p>Harry gave a look at him, as he chuckled, "I suppose you're right with that look, I don't exactly scream approchment." he agreed to him. "But, with the gathering of the Hallows, you became under my protection. Which is how you even came here in the first place."</p><p>Tilting his head, Harry seemed to understand what he was saying. Since after becoming 'Master of Death', he has leaned more to darker things and creatures. Not in the way Riddle did, but in a sense they saw him as their own chance. And boy did he try for their sake, but it wasn't enough. Hurt was in his eyes as a soft hand touched his cheek, "It's not your fault for the short comings of others, we knew after Dumbledore died the world would go with. His influence ran too deep, though you saw through them after his death, many did not."</p><p>Harry fingered his ring at that, the Potter/Black head ring. His eyes gazed up at the god of Darkness. "So the world will die." he stated as he felt the other nod, "And it was my doing?" he asked calmly.</p><p>"It was. Like I said, my brother and I got attached to you. We saw that so long as you were alive on the world, you felt it was worth fighting. But now that you have willingly let yourself die just to leave, we knew you had also given up hope. Unlike most of our creations, you were one we took great care in, you became ours in a sense, though you never knew it." he seemed to smile, "Ever felt like you were never alone, like someone was always there?" he asked as Harry looked at him he seemed to 'see' the humor on his face.</p><p>His shoulders sagged though, "So I did die?" he asked softly.</p><p>"Sadly yes," the younger brother's voice said in a mourning tone, "so your soul came to my domain, my home, for Fate felt this is were you belonged."</p><p>Emerald eyes met purple ones as Harry asked quietly, "What happens now?"</p><p>Waving his hand lightly, "Now? I send your soul to it's next life." his mouth area curved up into a smile, "My brother feels it's not your time to rest with the many here who do come to me. That I can still use you."</p><p>Harry stared at that as the younger motioned for him to follow, over to the pool of darkness. He placed his hand on it, showing a map, "This is the realm we left behind, we still keep tabs on it from time to time, despite what Ozma thinks. It is this place we will send you."</p><p>Before Harry could ask, he raised his hand, "Ozma has done much, be alone he can't even hope to get close to understanding. We shall send you as the opposite to him, we want you to help him, to help humans. In this world, we feel you have a chance to save it. Truthfully Harry Potter, you are our last hope for this world. I was convinced they'd never change, but seeing as our creation still has a pure enough soul, perhaps you can help them change."</p><p>"Why me? I failed once before." Harry said.</p><p>"Because you didn't fail on your own terms, but on the ones of others." The Dark God looked at him, "If you agree, you need to mean it."</p><p>Harry gazed at the map of the World of Remnet, his eyes in thought. The god was giving him a choice, he could rest now in the world of Darkness, possibly becoming something else. Or he could go into a new life, away from it all. He gazed at the map, before taking off his ring and tossing it to the God of Darkness. "I'll accept your task." he said.</p><p>In his hands, the ring turned dark black gold with an obsidian gem, he laughed at that. "It's been a while since humans have given me things, very well." he said placing the ring on the table. "On this world, you will be given gifts also."</p><p>He hand up his hand with one finger, "One, Destruction, you will keep your magic, trust me you shall need it, and it will stay as strong as I willed it to be before your 'Headmasters' manipulations." he held up another finger, "Two, knowledge, you shall be given knowledge of the world, my brother insisted that be a factor. Three, creation, you shall have the power to use silver eyes, a trait my brother put into humans before he left, this will make your green eyes have silver streaks in them. And Four, Choice, my creature will not attack you alone, but should you be with another, they will attack you also, whether you kill them or not is up to you."</p><p>Harry bowed his head at that, "T-Thank you sir." he said softly, "But," he gazed up at the god, "how will I know what to do?" he asked.</p><p>"Trust me Harry, you'll know." he said, Harry wanted to ask more but the god shushed him placing a hand on his cheek, "Harry Potter, We are naming you as our eyes and ears in a world already struggling to right their wrongs. It'll be now up to you to decide if they are worthy or not." a cold lips placed themselves on his forehead. "Rest now, and know we are always watching you."</p><p>And as these words spoke, Harry's vision faded out as slowly the purple glow of the god faded into blackness. </p>
