    <p>Dumbledore frowned, he looked at the notice in his hand, again. He wasn't sure how this was possible but knew he that Voldemort and Malfoy had to have something to do with it. He already sent a note to Harry and Severus asking them to meet him in his office. Harry arrived almost at the exact same time as Severus. Neither took his lemon drops which didn't surprise him. "Harry is now 17 and I just received a notice that Lord Malfoy has put in a claim for Harry to be his husband."</p><p>"What? How? I'm of age." Harry wasn't about to marry Lucius Malfoy. He didn't want anything to do with any Malfoy. He also didn't care for Dumbledore either if he was honest with himself. Actually, he wasn't very impressed with muggles or wizards, in general.</p><p>"He is using an old outdated law. Under the law, any pure-blood could demand the hand of anyone of marriageable age if they weren't already engaged or married. It's a law that was designed to be used for enemies during a time of conflict. It has never been removed off of the books. Lucius has put in for Harry. Harry would be listed as a slave, I am assuming. After all, what else would he want Harry for?"</p><p>"Are you kidding me?" Harry looked at Dumbledore shocked. He honestly wondered about what kind of society allowed this type of stuff to keep happening. </p><p>"I wish I was. However, he can't demand you to marry him if you are already married which is why I invited Professor Snape to this meeting." Dumbledore had his eyes twinkling as he ran his hands down his beard.</p><p>"I don't want to be married to him." They said in unison. Finally, something they agreed upon. </p><p>"It is either you marry each other or Lucius comes tomorrow night to remove Harry." Dumbledore ran his hands down his beard as if petting a cat. "So, the wedding between the two of you needs to happen tomorrow. I was going to try for tonight but I need to get some paperwork from the Ministry."</p><p>"I'm not marrying him." They spoke in unison. Harry glanced at Severus. He was wondering if perhaps they could poison Dumbledore.</p><p>"If you don't Harry becomes the property of Lucius and we know what Lucius will do to him." Dumbledore gave them the "I'm disappointed in you" look. "It's for the greater good." </p><p>Harry and Severus glared at Dumbledore. "Fine." Severus finally agreed. Harry wanted to kill someone, namely, Dumbledore.</p><p>"Good, good. I'll see you both here tomorrow night after dinner." Dumbledore smiled at them. </p><p>Harry resisted the urge to punch the man in the face. There was no way he was getting married to anyone. He was sick of Dumbledore controlling his life. </p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>Harry stormed his way back to Gryffindor tower. He was done with everything to do with Dumbledore and the Order. He ignored everyone in the common room and headed straight for his bed. He put the wards on his bed and waited. He had one lousy year left and Dumbledore just couldn't stop meddling in his life. It was bad enough with Granger, Weasley, and Weaselette always following him around but to get married wasn't going to happen. He had put up with Dumbledore's meddling because he had no choice. He had it with both worlds. </p><p>As soon as it was late enough he removed the wards, He checked to make sure no one added any proximity wards or anything else around the dorm. He gathered up his items, filled his trunk, shrunk it down, and opened the window next to his bed. He jumped onto his broom and flew out the window. Dumbledore could do without him. He certainly could do without the Dumbledore, the Order, his muggle relatives, and everyone else who tried to lay some claim onto him. He had hoped to he could have been finished with Hogwarts before disappearing but it wasn't meant to be.</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>Harry made his way to Gringotts. He knew he had to have some type of protection. He wasn't sure if he would be able to speak to his account manager but after waiting for almost an hour before Ironclaw was ready to see him. Harry explained what had happened tonight at Hogwarts.</p><p>"I see. Let me go and review a few things. Depending on what I find we can make some choices." Ironclaw wasn't happy to hear what happened. The goblins and other creatures didn't care for Dumbledore. </p><p>"Thank you, Ironclaw." Harry was tired but he wasn't going to head back to Hogwarts and marry Severus Snape or Lucius Malfoy. While he did like Severus, he wasn't about to enter into any marriage with someone who hated him. He was almost asleep when Ironclaw returned. Harry woke up as Ironclaw put some folders down.</p><p>"I pulled the law that Lord Malfoy would be using. There are a few loopholes. One is that you have to be already being married. Now, there is another interesting small print one I was able to find in an older version of the law. If you can stay hidden until you are twenty-one, Lord Malfoy can not force you to marry him. Since the law wasn't repelled you are protected by it. Even if Lord Malfoy demands your appearance or the law revamped it won't matter. You are protected by your titles, the lack of formal notice, and he won't be able to have you grandfathered under the law to force compliance since he failed to provide the formal notice. Especially since he didn't inform you, personally or formally, nor did he present it in the formal custom in front of witnesses. A written letter to the Headmaster does not meet those requirements of any type of notification."</p><p>"So I just have to stay hidden?" Harry smirked. He knew that no one would look for him if he left the country. It was time to say goodbye to England after he bid farewell to Hogwarts. "So if I use my Animagi transformation, I can remain hidden unless they use a spell with my name."</p><p>"Well, another thing I looked up while I was pulling some folders was what your magical name might be. A magical name is different than your name or even a proper name. Your magical name has never been released, so therefore, no one would be able to locate you using magic. Parents usually have a formal magically naming ceremony when a child reaches two, you never had one. So, therefore, you are protected in that way. The only place your magical name appears is on your magical birth certificate which is only filed here at Gringotts. I would be concerned about someone removing your form."</p><p>"That is true, especially after Pettigrew. Dumbledore and the others would check that since they know about Pettigrew." Harry looked at the folder Ironclaw put in front of him. He glanced at his magical birth certificate. "You can keep my real name hidden?" He knew Dumbledore was going to use the Ministry, the Order, and anything else the man could think of to locate him.</p><p>"Yes, and I do believe I have an idea on how to prevent anyone from being able to reveal your human form. It will require you to stay here for about a month or two to create a runic tattoo that will allow only you to reveal your human form."</p><p>2 Months Later:</p><p>Harry sat staring at Severus as he was harvesting potion ingredients from the Forbidden Forest. The man had been coming each night for the last few days. He had been watching Severus for a few hours and it was almost dawn. The sun was beginning to rise. He yawned but kept watching. Harry had been hiding in the Forbidden Forest for a few days. He came out at night as he liked to get some exercise. He also borrowed some books from the library as Dobby was still at Hogwarts. No one had even noticed when the crazy elf was missing. He wasn't sure where he was going to head to next. He sneezed causing Severus to jump a bit. The man had his wand out and looking for who sneezed. Harry tilted his head at Severus as he sneezed again. 'Damn pollen.' Harry looked at the wand that was now pointed at him. He let out a low warbling sound. </p><p>Severus lowered his wand. "Aren't you beautiful?" Harry stood up, walked slowly toward Severus. He rubbed his face against Severus' legs and started purring. Severus started petting Harry. "Now, what are you doing out here?" Harry kept rubbing his face against Severus. "I have seen you out here. I have been wondering if you were friendly." Harry kept purring. "I need to head back to Hogwarts." Severus started walking and Harry followed. Severus stopped, Harry stopped. "I see." Harry warbled again. No one would expect Harry Potter to willingly spend time with Professor Severus Snape. While Harry didn't want to marry the man he did know the man did a lot to protect him over the years. They each had their own roles to play and they played them well. Now it was time to change the game. While it wasn't part of the plan, plans could change.</p><p>_________________________________________</p><p>Severus watched the Ravenclaws, who were up early, run away from him and his new friend. His new friend gave a small low roar. "I believe you and I will get along just fine." Severus headed to his quarters to put away the potion ingredients he collected. Harry sat in the doorway as much as he could given his size. "I know you won't be able to get in here."</p><p>Harry was a bit surprised at how human Severus was sounding as he took up Severus' challenge and squeezed himself into the smaller room. He was a tiger and like all felines, he could fit into a lot of places. He wished he had whiskers all his life. They certainly came in handy. "I take that back. Get out before you destroy everything." Severus didn't want fur to get into his ingredients or into his cauldrons. Harry tilted his head. He was watching Severus closely. This wasn't the same man that Harry knew. He liked this Severus Snape. "Back up, go on. You got in here, get out the same way." Severus waved his hands back. "If you are good, I'll open a can of tuna for you tonight."</p><p>Harry let out a bit of a growl but backed up. He turned and headed for the couch. It looked comfortable. He jumped onto the couch and heard a bit of a groan from the furniture. He laid down, closed his eyes, and started to go to sleep. Severus came out of his lab. "Get off of my couch." Severus walked toward the tiger who just opened his eyes. "No, no, bad tiger. Get off." He wanted to laugh at himself as he was rebuking a tiger.</p><p>Harry watched Severus waving his finger at him while telling him he was a bad tiger. Where was the feared Potion Master? Where was the unyielding Severus Snape? He was going to like this new plan. He knew Severus had protected him as Harry Potter and knew the man protected his snakes. He was a bit surprised to discover that Severus Snape was a softie when it came to animals. </p><p>"I know you can hear me, so get off." Severus tried to sound stern but for some reason, he wasn't able to do it. No one knew it but he had a real soft spot for animals. If anyone ever saw his stables they would be surprised. The only people to know that aspect of his life was Draco and Dumbledore. Severus wasn't naive about animals like Hagrid but he had rescued a lot of animals over the years. </p><p>Harry got down, giving Severus a bit of sad face. "Come, I will give you some bacon at breakfast." Harry perked up. He loved bacon. "Eggs and some sausage too." Severus started to head to the Great Hall with his new friend who followed behind him. Since he was earlier than normal he was able to set up a spot at the end of the table for his new friend. He took his usual spot. Tea appeared in front of him as did a large bowl of raw meat. Severus put it down on the floor.</p><p>Severus was drinking his tea when Dumbledore arrived. Severus had ignored the students and his fellow staff members as they arrived. Dumbledore signaled for the start of breakfast and took a sip of his tea before he asked questions about Severus' guest. "Interesting familiar, Severus."</p><p>"Yes, he has been following me for the last week in the Forbidden Forest." Severus put some bacon into the bowl of his new friend. "The Centaurs didn't have any problems with him."</p><p>"He is certainly interesting. What type of tiger is he or she?" Minerva looked down at the huge tiger sitting at the end of the table eating from a bowl. She had never seen the likes of the one sitting next to Severus.</p><p>"He is a Maltese tiger or blue tiger. The Muggles believe they are an unproven coloration morph of a tiger, reported mostly in the Fujian Province of China. As you can see they are real. They are magical tigers which is why the Muggles haven't been able to confirm their existence. The term Maltese comes from domestic cat terminology for blue fur and refers to the slate grey coloration." Severus explained. Harry was impressed. He didn't think Severus would recognize what he was. He nudged Severus' arm. When Severus looked at him, Harry looked at his empty bowl. "Eggs and sausages?" Severus started to load up the plate for his new pet. Many never realized knowing animals was just as important as knowing plants when it came to making potions.</p><p>Harry nodded his agreement. Dumbledore pulled out his wand. "Animalis homo revelare." Nothing happened except Harry growled as the spell hit him. "Well, he isn't an Animagus." Harry was still growling. He really was starting to hate Dumbledore. Yes, he knew someone would try the spell but didn't mean he liked it.</p><p>Severus put more bacon into the bowl. Severus sent Dumbledore his death glare. Severus knew how to make sure someone wasn't pulling a Pettigrew on him. Harry went back to his breakfast but also watched Dumbledore.</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>Harry slept through most of Severus' class. He curled up on a low bed that Severus conjured for him to sleep on in the back corner of the classroom. He knew Severus put up a shield to keep his fur from flying around the room.  Harry did wake up when the seventh year Gryffindor-Slytherin class entered. He didn't move but he watched. He watched every move and heard every word spoken by the Gryffindors. He especially watched the two people who claimed to be his friends. </p><p>Severus noticed that his new familiar was watching Gryffindors very closely. This was the first class he had today with Gryffindors in it. He was able to give Weasley and Granger detention and remove some points. </p><p>________________________________________________________</p><p>Severus was sitting in front of the fireplace reading his Potions Monthly magazine. He could hear the snoring of his bluish tiger who was sleeping in front of the fireplace on a blanket. He had his tea and biscuits on the table. He heard a knock on the door. The feline was awake and staring at the door. Severus wanted to groan as the name Dumbledore appeared on his ward indicator.</p><p>Severus got up. Dumbledore had been a major pain in his life since the Brat-Who-Lived disappeared.  "Don't eat his robes they might make you sick." He sent his tea and biscuits to his kitchenette. He didn't want to encourage Dumbledore to remain longer than necessary. Severus walked to the door. He opened it. "Albus?" </p><p>"Severus, a few minutes of your time." Dumbledore was wearing one of his more colorful dressing gowns over an equally ugly nightshirt. They were bright yellow and orange stripes with dancing unicorns. </p><p>"I was about to start a potion." Severus never changed into his night clothes until he was actually going to go to bed. As he knew more often than not that Dumbledore or Poppy would summon him. Poppy only when she needed a potion. Dumbledore usually when he had a hair-brained scheme or now his obsession with trying to locate Harry Potter. </p><p>"I do apologize. I was reading some books and noticed none of the locations spells worked. I was hoping you might be able to provide me with some information that perhaps Lily might have shared with you. Perhaps you could tell me if Harry is a shortened form of a name or even a nickname like for Henry? Lucius is still insisting that I'm hiding Harry."</p><p>Harry was alert. Severus sighed. "I never spoke to Lily after our fifth-year so I have no idea. How are you able to pay the fines? Lucius hasn't asked me if I had seen Harry." Severus still didn't invite Dumbledore into his quarters. </p><p>"I've managed so far but I need to find him. Perhaps it's time I visit the goblins and see if I can gain access to the Potter vaults and check for any information." Dumbledore glanced at Harry, dismissed him. "Could you can invent a potion?" </p><p>Harry wasn't about Dumbledore entering his vaults. Ironclaw had helped him to upgrade his vaults protections including adding parselmagic to prevent anyone but him from entering his vaults. </p><p>"No, any potion I would require to know his full name and some blood. Since the location spells have failed so would any potion." Severus wasn't about to let Harry Potter be found. He certainly didn't want to get married and didn't care how much money Dumbledore had to pay to Lucius for the missing Harry Potter.</p><p>"Very good, my boy. I'll let you get back to what you were doing. Have a pleasant night." Dumbledore turned and left. </p><p>Severus closed the door. He summoned his tea as he sat back down. "Now, we can have some peace before bedtime."</p>
