    <p>Harry managed to find his way onto Platform 9 ¾ by sheer luck.  After searching to no avail for what seemed like forever as the clock ticked closer and closer to departure time, he’d gone to lean against a column to wallow in his misery.</p><p>...and he’d gone right through the column and tumbled onto his aching bum on the other side.  After tentatively sneaking back to get his trunk, he’d ducked nervously through the crowds of students and parents onto the train.  He’d found a compartment that was still empty and engaged the lock on the door before settling in to read.</p><p>He was so relieved that he’d made it onto the train.  He’d been very afraid that he wouldn’t.  Vernon had threatened on and off ever since he’d got home from Diagon Alley, to not let him go.  And then that morning he’d begged his uncle to take him to the train station.  Instead, he’d gotten a sneer and exact change for the train into London followed by the tube to King’s Cross.  Dragging his trunk to the train station in Surrey had taken so long he’d thought for sure he wouldn’t make it at all, but he’d gotten to King’s Cross with close to an hour to spare.</p><p>Then, of course, he’d spent more than half that time panicking about not knowing how to reach the magical platform.</p><p>But he’d made it.  He was here.  He was going to Hogwarts.  He was away from the Dursleys.  He was safe.</p><p>He fought down tears of relief, curled his legs up on the bench with him, and focused on his book.  Mostly, when Hagrid had taken him to Diagon Alley to get his things, he’d only bought what was on his list.  The exception to that was at the bookshop.  Harry had always liked books, but he’d come to like them a lot more in the last few years. </p><p>He’d been eight when it started.  He’d get sleepy really early sometimes, for no reason, and he’d wake up a long time later.  He’d wake up hurting in places that didn’t make any sense, and covered in bruises that he didn’t remember getting.</p><p>He’d started searching the library for an explanation since he knew asking the Dursleys would only get him smacked and sent to his cupboard.  Asking any other adult would be many times worse if it ever got back to the Dursleys.  They’d always smacked him about a bit when he got out of line, but the only true beatings he’d ever gotten was when someone starting asking questions about what his life at home was like.  The first time was when he first started school and the nice teacher had asked about a bruise on his arm.  He hadn’t realized there was anything wrong with admitting that his uncle had gotten mad at him when he burned his toast and he’d grabbed his arm when he took him to his cupboard.</p><p>Vernon had beat him until he passed out that night and it had been two and a half weeks before he was healed enough to go back to school.</p><p>So, he knew not to ask adults.  Books, though, seemed safe.  For a while, he’d thought maybe he had hemorrhoids with the unexpected pains he kept getting in his bum.  Lots of reading and some careful exploration with his fingers and a mirror had convinced him that that wasn’t right.  He’d spent months looking before finally giving up with the elementary library and venturing out to the public library one Saturday when he was kicked out of the house for the day.</p><p>After hours of searching, he’d discovered a book about gay sex that had put him on the right path.</p><p>From there, it had been a lot of conjecture until he’d finally figured out what he thought was going on.  Nothing since then had led him to believe otherwise.</p><p>Two or three days a week, Petunia would give him a cup of tea.  It was the only time in his whole life he could remember drinking anything but water, so it was already suspicious.  And every single time after drinking this tea, he would get sleepy no matter what time of day it was or how he’d slept the night before.  He never woke up until many hours later, and every single time he did, he woke up hurting in places that he shouldn’t be hurting.  Covered in new bruises and sometimes even bite marks.  His bum aching and burning at the same time.  His throat usually hurt pretty bad, too, like he was sick but without a cough or stuffy head.</p><p>He’d spent as much time as possible at the public library since then, and he’d read a lot about how gay sex worked.  From the books he’d read, he knew that it wasn’t supposed to be something bad.  It was supposed to happen between two adults who liked each other and both wanted it.</p><p>He’d also read books about rape and he knew that that’s what had happened to him.  He knew he wasn’t a slag or a whore or a slut – what the Dursleys had started calling him in addition to Freak and Boy after this all had started.  He’d looked those words up in the dictionary at the library so he knew what they meant for real.  The only word he could use to describe what he was had been was “victim” and he didn’t much care for that, so he mostly just tried to ignore it.</p><p>Once he’d figured out for sure what was happening to him, thinking about it had been the last thing he’d wanted to do.  It wasn’t like there was anything he could do about it, and sometimes, when he was drinking his tea, he felt like letting it happen was almost like giving his permission and maybe he really was a slag...</p><p>So, he tried not to think about it.  Reading books helped to take his mind away from his thoughts.  He had to be careful with his library books so Dudley didn’t get hold of them and destroy them just to spite him.  It had only happened once and it had taken him a month to collect enough change in the laundry to pay for it so he could take out more books.  He only took out one at a time so he could hide it easier and he usually only got to the library once a week, which meant he usually read each book several times over before returning them.</p><p>He’d bought thirteen extra books at Flourish &amp; Blotts.  Of course, he hadn’t gotten to read any of them yet.  They’d been locked in the cupboard under the stairs the moment he’d returned to Number 4 on his birthday and he’d not gotten them back until his uncle had shoved a handful of notes at him and all but threw him out the door.  He intended to read as much as possible before reaching Hogwarts, which is why he was so relieved the compartment door had a lock.  He didn’t want to have to deal with anyone on the ride.</p><p>He spent the entire ride that way, ignoring any knocking on the door and making only one quick trip to the loo, which he’d managed without speaking to or even really looking at anyone, much to his relief.</p><p>It wasn’t that he was afraid of people – really it wasn’t – he was just happier when he could avoid them.  Kids were just so stupid, and he was including those quite a bit older than him.  They talked about stupid stuff and fought about stupid stuff and played stupid games and cared about stupid things.  Even when he’d first started school and properly met other kids for the first time, he’d found them difficult to understand.  Many years of reading later, he had an intellectual grasp on the fact that it was their innocence and naivety that he found so difficult to tolerate.  Most of them had never experienced anything really bad, and those that had, had mostly had parents around to cuddle them and ease their fears.</p><p>Harry had grown up despised and he’d been made to understand the harsh realities of the world from an early age.  Then three years ago, they’d started...</p><p>No.  He wasn’t going to think about that.</p><p>The point was that he didn’t like kids because they were stupid and petty and ridiculous.  And he definitely didn’t like adults because they all treated him exactly like all the stupid children they were used to seeing.</p><p>There was a time when he’d have done anything for a parent or for a friend.  He understood now that no adult would ever understand him enough to respect that he wasn’t a stupid little kid and so living with one would never be like he’d used to dream of.  Oh, it would probably be a lot better than the Dursleys, but not the perfect dream he’d once imagined.  As to friends, well, a friend would have to understand him, so that made it pretty much impossible.</p><p>He’d gotten over that realization years ago and learned to content himself with books for companionship.</p><p>When they arrived at the school, Harry followed Hagrid and the other first years down to the lake and boarded a boat with three other students that he honestly could not have identified later if his life depended on it.  He kept his head down, hunched in on himself, and it worked.  The others talked quietly amongst themselves but seemed content to ignore Harry as he was ignoring them.</p><p>They could see the school properly for the first time as they crossed the lake and Harry tilted his head to the side enough to see it without actually raising his head.  It was huge and looked like nothing less than a grand castle straight out of a fairy tale. </p><p>It would have given him more hope if Harry had believed in fairy tales.  As it stood, he mostly just figured it would be huge and drafty and easy to get lost in.  Still, that did have the upside of meaning there would be lots of room for him to avoid other people.</p><p>At the school, Hagrid transferred them to a severe-looking woman identified as Professor McGonagall, who led them to an area that must have been right outside where the other students were gathering, going by the noise through the closed door.</p><p>The arrival of a small group of ghosts had made his blood run cold for a few seconds but he had enough experience containing flinches and noises of distress that he did not outwardly react, and he soon realized that the ghosts were not a danger to the students but apparently a regular part of life here.</p><p>The Great Hall, when they were finally led inside, was huge, with a ceiling that looked like the night sky and about a million floating candles that didn’t seem to be dripping wax on anyone, oddly enough, though none had a dish to catch it.  There were a truly intimidating number of students crammed onto the four big tables running the length of the room, and a perpendicular table at the end of the room filled with intimidating-looking adults.</p><p>Harry quickly decided that he hated this room, but not nearly so much as he hated how everyone was staring at him and the other first years as they made their way to the raised floor at the front of the room where the teacher table was.  He did his best to disappear within the crowd of first years, which wasn’t too difficult since he was the shortest of them and much more inclined to be still and quiet than the rest.</p><p>The hat sang a song about the four Houses and then McGonagall started calling out names.  Harry’s heart sank further when he realized he was going to have to go in front of everyone to sit on that stool and be stared at until he was sorted.</p><p>And how did it decide who went where?  Did everyone get a House for sure or was there a chance that if someone didn’t fit in any House they’d get sent away?  Would he fit anywhere?  Would the hat know what he’d allowed to happen to him with the Dursleys?  Would it turn him away because of that?</p><p>By the time his name was called, he was trembling head to toe with nerves and his stomach was twisting in a most ominous manner.  He silently prayed that he wouldn’t be sick in front of everyone as he scurried to the chair and sat down, keeping his eyes down so he could try to pretend there weren’t hundreds of people staring at him.  He was breathing too hard and he tried to slow it down while he waited the relative eternity it took the teacher to put the stupid hat on his head.</p><p>“Hm...  Difficult.  Very difficult,” he heard the hat say very quietly and he cringed, hoping it would hurry already.</p><p>“Plenty of courage,” it observed and Harry barely held back a hysterical laugh.  He was feeling a very long way from brave at the moment.  The hat, if it noticed this, did not comment.  “An impressive mind, too, and a desire to learn.  Cunning, but not ambitious.  Hard-working, but not loyal.  Where to put you?”</p><p>“Please, just put me somewhere I can disappear,” Harry whispered fervently.  He’d never wanted to disappear so badly in his life.  Not even when Aunt Petunia called him for tea.</p><p>“Disappear, huh?  Well, there’s only one choice for you then.  Better be, RAVENCLAW!”</p><p>Weak with relief that he wasn’t going to be sent away and that he was almost done being the center of attention, Harry returned the hat to the sour-looking teacher and stumbled slightly on his way down to join the table that was clapping.  The first years seemed to be gathered all together at the end of the table, so Harry went there, though he moved to the very end, putting a little distance between him and everyone else.  He folded his arms in front of him on the table, then buried his face in them and tried hard not to cry in sheer relief.  He hoped that no one would try to talk to him.  He didn’t think he could handle it right now.</p><p>Thankfully, the other Ravenclaws seemed to be able to read his “please leave me alone” body language just fine and no one tried to talk to him, though a lot of people were staring.</p><p>When they were finally shown up to Ravenclaw Tower and then to their dorms, Harry crawled immediately into his bed, pulled the curtains shut, and silently cried himself to sleep.  He was far too overwhelmed by the stress of everything leading up to his being here to even try to hold back the tears.  He was just so grateful for the curtains that gave him the privacy to do so without all his dormmates thinking he was a huge baby.</p><p align="center"><strong>*   *   *   *   *</strong> </p><p>Harry’s first week at Hogwarts was both better and worse than he’d imagined.  It was better because the library had turned out to be huge and full of so many books he was sure he wouldn’t be able to read half of the ones he wanted before he graduated.  It was worse because everyone seemed really obsessed with that Boy-Who-Lived nonsense.  They pointed and stared and whispered as he passed in the corridors and even in the Ravenclaw common room.  Meals were almost physically painful and he had to struggle to eat until his stomach was full when his nerves had ruined his appetite before he even entered the Hall.  He only ate as much as he did because he’d been deprived of food often enough in his life to have learned better than to miss a chance to eat when it was offered.</p><p>Classes were kind of surprisingly boring.  It baffled him a bit that these teachers had found a way to make <em>learning magic </em>boring, but they’d done it.  Droning lectures about tiny pieces of magical theory that didn’t seem to make sense without some broader context and practical lessons learning spells that seemed to have almost no practical purpose at all made the entire process feel nearly as mundane as learning math or social studies in muggle school.  Really, what possible need would they ever have to turn a matchstick into a needle?  Perhaps if he regularly carried a pocketful of matchsticks then it would be handy to be able to turn them into things he needed.  Considering, however, that their Charms book had a spell to light a small fire, it seemed stupid to be carrying around matchsticks.  Now, if they were taught to turn summer clothes into winter clothes, that would be useful.  Or to make food from other things. </p><p>History was completely horrible, taught by a ghost who didn’t even seem to really know they were there.  It made Harry wonder how accurate his lessons even were.  Once he realized that the ghost teacher didn’t notice if anyone was paying attention or doing other things, he started bringing to class books that he wanted to read and just ignoring Binns completely.</p><p>Herbology was a little interesting because at least Harry could understand how knowing about plants would be a good thing to know.  Plants could be food or ingredients for potions and therefore were something he figured he’d want to have in the future when he got his own home.  Its usefulness was so far in the future though, that it was sometimes hard to get himself to focus on that class when there were so many more interesting things he wanted to learn first.</p><p>Astronomy, in his opinion, was a waste of time he could be sleeping, so he made a deal with himself to do just enough to make sure he passed the class, but not worry beyond that.  He wasn’t about to risk failing classes and maybe getting kicked out of school.  Or having them contact the Dursleys with their concerns.  The very idea was terrifying.  He couldn’t imagine what they’d do to him if the “freaks” sent an owl to them to complain about how stupid Harry was.</p><p>DADA was maybe the worst class because something between the teacher’s stuttering and the overwhelming garlic smell meant Harry got a headache in every single class.  The things they were learning there <em>were </em>interesting, though.  Harry just preferred to learn them from his book in his dorm room at night rather than trying to follow the teacher’s stuttering lectures while his head was pounding.</p><p>Potions was easily Harry’s favorite class because potions were something that Harry could see being very immediately useful and most of the specific potions they learned in class were actually useful ones.  They weren’t all things he needed right away, but they were things that he might need.  Like a cure for boils.  If he ever got boils, he’d like to be able to cure them without going to the school nurse, who frankly terrified him.  He was so afraid she’d notice something that painted the Dursleys in a bad light and then she’d contact them or like Child Services would contact them and then they’d beat him so bad the next time he saw them.</p><p>Potions, like Snape had said their first day of class, could do almost anything, and Harry spent a large amount of his extra reading on potions books.  He’d learned a lot about potions because of that.  Not just about how to make them, but about the things that could be made with them.  Potions to regrow bones, or heal wounds without scarring, or wash away bruises in a matter of hours.  Potions to heal sickness, replace a night of sleep, or even fill an empty stomach with everything a full meal could provide.  If he could find a way to brew some of these potions and hide them on him when he went back to the Dursleys, he could make it through the whole summer without starving or hurting very much at all.  He could have the energy to get his chores done on time.</p><p>The downside of potions was Snape.  The man seemed to think Harry smelled bad or something with how he was always sneering at him and keeping a healthy distance.  He was always harsh with Harry’s potions, but since Harry usually knew what he was doing in that class and rarely made mistakes on his potions, the man didn’t have too much to complain about.  After a lifetime with the Dursleys, Harry was hardly going to be frightened of the man for being a little harsh when he never hit Harry or even seemed like he wanted to. </p><p>It might have helped that Harry always kept his head down and was never less than polite to the meanest professor at Hogwarts.  He knew better than to antagonize people predisposed to dislike him.  It never ended well.</p><p>When he wasn’t in class or meals, Harry spent all of his time in the quietest corner of the library he could find or tucked into his bed with the curtains drawn.  He avoided the common room as much as possible due to the staring, but the library was only open until eight in the evening and sometimes he got stared at there, too.</p><p>His classmates mostly seemed to think he was weird.  He heard them whispering about him being afraid of his own shadow sometimes, or arrogant other times.  They seemed to think he was either afraid of everyone or that he felt he was too good to be around them.  It couldn’t just be that he didn’t like people, apparently.</p><p>Harry didn’t honestly care if they were whispering about him being a coward or if they were whispering about his supposed defeat of the Dark Lord (he categorically refused to call him by those stupid monikers, but calling him Voldemort was way too controversial for him to want anything to do with that).  He suspected they would be gossiping about him whether he was acting “normal” or not, because they were stupid kids that cared about stupid things.</p><p>He was slowly learning to ignore them.</p><p>At meals, Harry couldn’t bring himself to try any of the drinks besides the water until he’d learned a charm to check for purity in food and drink and make sure nothing had been added to it.  The spell actually supplied him a detailed list of ingredients and was meant to protect people with allergies, but it served his purpose. It wasn’t a first-year spell, but after a couple weeks of diligent practice, he managed to master it.  He considered it the most important spell he’d learn all year if not his whole time at Hogwarts.  Then he was able to try milk for the first time and chocolate milk.  He liked both very much.  He wasn’t as crazy about the pumpkin juice because it was really sweet – like drinking the pumpkin pie dessert they served.  He liked the orange juice and apple juice a lot, though.  He also really liked the coffee that was only offered with breakfast and lunch.  It was hot, but other than that, nothing like tea.  It was bitter by itself, but with a bunch of cream and sugar, it was delicious.  Tea, he probably wouldn’t ever be able to think about without feeling ill, much less voluntarily drink.</p><p>He tried not to think about going back for the summer and all the tea he’d probably be made to drink.</p><p>Flying, he thought, was something that he could really love.  Unfortunately, in class, he was too nervous and too busy avoiding everyone else to really enjoy it.  He just felt so natural when he was up on a broom.  Like it was where he was meant to be.</p><p>First years weren’t allowed their own brooms, though, and they weren’t allowed to fly except in class, so he’d have to wait until next year to figure out if it was as great as he thought it could be.  He’d have to look into seeing if he could afford his own broom for next year, so he’d always have one when he wanted to fly.</p><p>On Halloween, Professor Quirrell came barreling into the Great Hall during dinner, screaming about a troll being in the dungeons, then promptly fainted straight away.  Dumbledore sent them all back to their dormitories, which seemed insane, since Slytherins and Hufflepuffs both had their common rooms in the dungeons, but Harry thought that maybe there was like a back way in that would be safer.  At least, he hoped so.</p><p>Other than that thought, he tried to focus on making his own way up to Ravenclaw Tower without getting killed and feeling glad he’d not been sorted into Hufflepuff or Slytherin.  He remembered what the hat had said.  Cunning but not ambitious.  Hard-working but not loyal.  Honestly, both seemed pretty accurate.  His only real ambition had ever been surviving.  Any goal beyond that had seemed a pipe dream not worth entertaining since he’d been really little.  As to loyalty...  Well, when one disliked people in general, loyalty was kind of a non-issue.  It’s not like he’d betray people for kicks but...  Well, he wouldn’t shout a warning if one of the Dursleys was about to walk in front of a lorry.  And he felt no connection to the wizarding world, Hogwarts, or Ravenclaw that would make him favor them over anyone outside those groups.  None of them had ever done anything for him.  Oh, the wizarding world and Hogwarts, in particular, had gotten him away from the Dursleys, but it wasn’t like they were doing it out of the kindness of their hearts.  From what Hagrid had said, he’d been automatically enlisted for the school upon birth and his parents had paid his tuition in advance.  The only people that earned any loyalty in that scenario were his parents, and they were too dead to care what he did now.</p><p>At breakfast the morning after Halloween, they learned that Hermione Granger, that uppity Gryffindor know-it-all that was always glaring at him when he did better than her in Herbology and DADA, had been caught by the troll.  They didn’t get any details on what happened, but they did learn that she would be spending a whole week at St. Mungo’s, so whatever it was, it had been pretty serious.  There had also been fifty points deducted from Gryffindor and there was a rumor that Ron Weasley had been teasing Granger and had been the reason she wasn’t safe in Gryffindor Tower.  The redhead was being systematically shunned by his House, though whether it was for getting injured a girl no one seemed to like or for losing fifty points was anyone’s guess.</p><p>That sort of willingness to shun him was exactly the reason Harry was so much happier facing the world alone.</p><p>After Halloween, things calmed down again – thank goodness – and Harry fell back into a routine of classes, meals, and books and began to feel rather comfortable.  Hagrid had tried to get Harry to meet up with him at his hut a few times, but Harry had always sent back a polite refusal.  The man was just so big and loud and... okay, as stupid as anyone else.  Harry had no desire to be in his company.  And what would they even talk about?  He was sure it would be terribly awkward.  He’d noticed the man giving him sad looks across the Great Hall sometimes, but he just tried not to look at him and it was okay.</p><p>His grades, as term progressed, became fairly predictable.  He got mostly Es in Herbology and DADA, and As in everything else except for Potions.  In Potions, he got Os almost all the time, which was really saying something considering how harsh Professor Snape always was with him.</p><p>Honestly, Harry really didn’t care about his grades.  He didn’t have much for plans for after graduation.  It was just too far away.  He had to worry about surviving that long first.  He had no plans to get a regular job in the wizarding world.  Not with how stupid everyone was about Harry sodding Potter.  No, he’d either find some hermit profession he could do from home like brewing potions or writing books, or else he’d just go live full time in the muggle world.  If he decided to do the latter, he could always get a job that didn’t require an education while he went about learning a trade.  Maybe he wouldn’t even stay in the U.K.  He didn’t know yet.  It depended on how willing everyone was to leave him alone in the future, he supposed.</p><p>So, no.  He didn’t care if his grades were impressive, though he did care about learning as much as he could to help him survive.  It was just that survival skills weren’t really what the school was focused on teaching.  He made sure to get good enough grades to avoid failing any classes.  That was his only real concern.</p><p>At Christmastime, he got two gifts.  A wooden flute from Hagrid, which was surprising and nice and made him feel the smallest bit guilty for not visiting the man or thinking to send him a gift.  Only a tiny bit, though.  He was hardly obligated to spend time with the man just because he’d known two people Harry couldn’t even remember. </p><p>The other gift was, what turned out to be an invisibility cloak, which had supposedly belonged to his dad, though whoever had had it hadn’t felt the need to sign the note, so he might never know for sure.</p><p>He used the cloak to stay later in the library and to traverse busy corridors when he was feeling particularly unwilling to deal with the whispering and pointing and staring.  One night, after staying quite late in the library, Mrs. Norris caught him on his way out.  He really needed to find a charm to hide his scent, because she was the only creature in the whole school who ever bothered him when he was wearing the cloak.</p><p>He quickly darted down the corridor and into a room, closing the door swiftly behind him.  He looked around for something to prop against the door since it had a keyhole but no lock he could turn without the key.  He swiftly became distracted when he realized that he was in a large room that was entirely empty except for one large thing in the center of the room.  It was covered in a dust cloth, which seemed a little strange as nothing in the room was remotely dusty, but he was getting used to wizards being weird.</p><p>Harry looked around the room carefully once more, but he was quite alone.  He was curious about the thing that had been put in this room all by itself for storage.  He briefly considered the wisdom in snooping, but it was probably for the best that he stayed in the room for a few minutes to let Mrs. Norris give up and wander off.</p><p>Pursing his lips contemplatively, he cautiously approached the dust cloth.  He gripped the bottom, then had second thoughts.  He’d need to put the cloth back on afterwards.  He didn’t want to make it obvious that someone was snooping here.  He read a lot, but he was sure there were ways of tracking someone that he had yet to find, so maybe if they knew someone was here, they could figure out that it had been him!</p><p>He almost changed his mind about investigating, but then he remembered that he could just levitate it back into place with the Wingardium Leviosa spell.</p><p>Content with that decision, he carefully tugged the cloth away, stepping back a bit to examine what turned out to be a large stand mirror.</p><p>Before he could get too involved in examining the frame, he became aware of the fact that the surface of the mirror was not reflecting him and his surroundings, but showing a different scene entirely.</p><p>Harry gripped his wand cautiously as he watched, uncertain as to whether this thing was going to be dangerous.  He’d almost think that that was impossible since no one would keep something so dangerous in an unlocked room in a school, but this was Hogwarts, after all.  A school that apparently kept something deadly down a third floor corridor with nothing but a dire warning to keep students away.  A school that somehow had a troll get into it and failed to prevent a first year girl from being gravely injured by it.  He wasn’t about to start making assumptions about his safety just because he was in a school.</p><p>But then the image settled on a comfortably large cottage on a hill surrounded by nothing but wilderness.  Slowly, he could see inside the cottage.  He started when he recognized himself, seated on a large, overstuffed sofa in front of a cozy fire, the entire room covered in books of all shapes and sizes and colors.  He had a book open in his lap and a content smile on his face.</p><p>His wand slowly lowered and he felt the tension go out of his muscles.  If he was able to choose between every cottage in the whole world, that is the one he would choose to live in.  He could kind of picture it in his head.  Winding staircases and big open rooms with lots of windows and books absolutely everywhere.  There would be an overlarge balcony from his bedroom on the second floor, with one of those outdoor lounge chairs where he could lie back and watch the stars.  There would be a greenhouse out back where he would grow his own vegetables and potion ingredients.</p><p>And he knew – he <em>knew – </em>that he was entirely alone in that house.  There were no people anywhere in the area and no one even knew where to find him.  He was completely alone and completely safe and completely free.</p><p>He had no idea how long he spent standing there, staring at that image, before he realized what he was doing.  He was supposed to be getting to bed before he got caught.  With one last, lingering look at the mirror, Harry carefully levitated the cloth back into place and put his cloak over himself before sneaking back to Ravenclaw Tower.</p><p>The second term of the year was, thankfully, much less exciting.  No trolls, for starters.  And he and the rest of the school were getting used to each other.  So, they did less whispering and staring and he was getting better at dealing with the crowds in the Great Hall, so eating wasn’t such a challenge anymore, but actually something he could enjoy.  He wouldn’t say he was ever comfortable in the Great Hall full of people, but it was becoming more tolerable.</p><p>In the middle of May, Hagrid’s hut burned down, which reminded Harry of what Draco Malfoy had told him the first day they met – that he’d heard that sometimes Hagrid got drunk and burned down his hut.  No one seemed to know how it had happened, but Hagrid and his dog were both fine and Dumbledore rebuilt the hut in no time.</p><p>At the end of June, just after the end of exams, Quirrell vanished without a trace.  Rumors abounded about the vampires having caught up with him, or the coward having fled for fear they were getting close.  All Harry knew for sure was that all of the teachers seemed very quiet and grim over the final days of the term, and none of them would comment when students asked, stating only that Professor Quirrell would not be returning the following year.</p><p>Harry didn’t pay that much attention to it.  To him, it seemed like every day after Christmas was just a countdown to having to go back to the Dursleys and as the time came closer, he grew increasingly tense and grumpy.  He lost what little patience he’d ever had for dealing with stupid people – children <em>and </em>adults – and people started avoiding him and giving him irritated looks, like his temper was a personal insult to them.  Like it wasn’t their own fault for bothering him when they had no good reason to be anywhere near him.</p><p>He did manage to secretly brew a few simple healing potions in one of the many empty classrooms scattered around the school.  He also managed, by the light of a candle while curled up in his bed behind the heavy curtains, to make a small expanded space inside the buckle of the belt he had to wear constantly at the Dursleys because none of his pants would stay up without it.  Unfortunately, the meal substitute potions turned out to be too far above his level to manage, but a simple nutrient potion had been doable.  He’d also been squirreling away some of the least perishable foods from the Great Hall for the last month.  It was mostly apples and nuts, which was why he knew he’d need the nutrient potions.  Those potions wouldn’t fill him up, but they would help to keep him healthier despite the small bit he had to eat.  He knew the Dursleys would feed him some, too.  They seemed to have perfected over the years, exactly how much to feed him to keep him alive and perpetually starving at the same time.</p><p>What he dreaded most, of course, was the tea.</p>
