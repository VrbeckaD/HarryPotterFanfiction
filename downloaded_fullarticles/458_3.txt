    <p>A young scrawny boy listened to his relatives talk from the cupboard under the stairs that he was forced to call his bedroom, his unruly black hair pushed to the side as he pressed his ear against the cupboard door. He was careful to not put too much pressure on the cupboard door lest it open, exposing him. The boy was Harry Potter, his 'family' was his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and his cousin Dudley.</p><p>His Uncle Vernon was a large man, in both height and weight, while his Aunt Petunia was a long-necked woman whose ears were constantly scanning for gossip. Dudley was arguably the worst, he was as round as he was tall, and took a sick and sadistic delight in torturing Harry anyway he could think of.</p><p>Harry pressed his ear further against the cupboard door, straining his senses to hear his Uncle's voice, a spider loitering close to his ear which he ignored with a practised ease. "I'm telling you Tunie, it's a great opportunity," Uncle Vernon said convincingly. "Not only for Grunnings, but for us as well."</p><p><em>So, it's about Grunnings,</em> Harry thought to himself. Grunnings was the company that his Uncle Vernon worked for, which made and sold drills.</p><p>"But why us?" Aunt Petunia asked, her voice one of exasperated annoyance. "And why all of us?"</p><p>"Nobody else in the company wants to do it. And we all have to go because the investor is a family man and we need to make a good impression by having him meet another family man," Vernon responded.</p><p>"But what about <em>him</em>?" Petunia replied, and Harry instantly knew that he was the 'him' in question.</p><p>"I'm sure the cat lady can look after him for the week." Vernon's voice was smooth, likely having rehearsed and planned a reply for any of his wife's complaints.</p><p>"She's in hospital, one of her cats tripped her up," Petunia's voice was frustrated. "What about Marge?"</p><p>"At the vets, Ripper ate something he shouldn't've."</p><p>The two adults were silent for a minute, both considering their options. Eventually Vernon sighed with frustration. "I suppose we'll just have to take him with us," he said in an irritated and reluctant tone.</p><p>Vernon's heavy footsteps approached the door, and Harry scurried into the corner to hide the fact he was listening to their conversation. "Boy!" Vernon yelled as he roughly pulled the door open. "The family is going to America for my business, and you're coming with us." Harry nodded as his Uncle paused and narrowed his gaze at him. "But, if you mess this up for me, you will regret it." With that said, Vernon slammed the door shut and walked away.</p><p>The days leading up to the trip passed quickly, with Vernon and Petunia buying Dudley a variety of new clothes and toys and Harry a single formal suit. Harry stood facing the bathroom mirror a grin plastered on his face, the form-fitting suit being the first outfit that truly fit him, the black blazer and trousers matching his hair while his deep crimson tie complemented his bright green eyes.</p><p>Their suitcases were overflowing, with all manner of items, while Harry's only luggage was one of Dudley's old backpacks that had been found in the attic.</p><p>Getting in the car to drive to the airport, Vernon turned to look at Harry. "Remember what I said boy, if you mess this opportunity up for me, you will regret it."</p><p>Harry nodded weakly, as Dudley laughed and Petunia steeled her glare. Harry sat in silence as the family drove to the airport and eventually boarded their plane. Dudley was sat by the window, likely to give his simple brain a view to distract itself, Petunia sat in the middle, and Vernon sat in the aisle for the extra leg room his large body desperately needed. Harry, however, was on the aisle seat next to his Uncle, where his Uncle could observe and yell at Harry if needed. There was no need, Harry sat quietly as the plane flew as opposed to Dudley who threw a tantrum halfway through the flight as the window view failed to amuse him anymore. Instead he began to scream at how he was missing the new episode of his favourite cartoon. Harry simply ignored them, deciding to relax in the few minutes his family couldn't hurt him.</p><p>Eventually, the plane landed with a shake and slowed down until it came to a complete stop. The pilot's voice sounded from the intercom, "The local time is 11am. We hope you enjoy your stay in Gotham City."</p><p>The family checked into the grand and expensive hotel and went to their room. Vernon and Petunia took the queen-sized bed, Dudley took the double bed against the corner wall and Harry simply had a spare blanket thrown to him and toldm to sleep on the floor. "But there's room on Dudley's bed," Harry protested, looking at the free space on the bed that even Dudley’s girth didn’t cover.</p><p>Petunia glared at him, and reassured Dudley that he wouldn't have to share a bed with Harry. Vernon was less vocal and slapped Harry across the face, sending him to the floor before standing over him and yelling, "Enough of your backtalk. Any of that at the meeting and you will not be coming back home with us. Understood?"</p><p>Harry felt his face burn where he was hit, but refused to let the tears in his eyes fall. Harry nodded and Vernon sneered but backed away.</p><p>Harry got to his feet, went to the bathroom in attempt to look presentable, and then sat on his blanket in total silence.</p><p>Hours passed and eventually Harry was ordered to get ready. He got dressed in his fitting-suit, as Aunt Petunia covered his face in make-up to conceal the red hand mark, and waited for Dudley to finish his tantrum.</p><p>Dudley was stomping his feet in frustration. "I don't want to go!" he shouted, snot seeping from his nose. "It's going to be boring!"</p><p>"I know Duddykins," Aunt Petunia said in a sickly-sweet voice as she abandoned Harry to dab at Dudley’s nose. "But it's at a restaurant and we'll let you eat whatever you want, won't we Vernon?"</p><p>Vernon nodded swiftly. "Anything for my growing boy," he said, patting Dudley on the back, who had instantly calmed at the mention of food.</p><p>As Petunia cleaned Dudley's face and got him dressed in his suit (Harry was reminded of a bowling ball, black and round), Harry waited by the door and quickly the four walked to the nearby restaurant where the business meeting was taking place. Vernon made sure that they got to the meeting place early, so he could prep his family and what and what not to say.</p><p>Entering the building, Vernon strolled grandly in an attempt to look far more important than he was until he reached the staff podium. "We have a reservation for a table for eight at five o'clock," he declared grandiosely. Harry looked around at the restaurant, it was a posh looking building, with royal blue tablecloths draped over the tables and the smell of sizzling meat filled the air.</p><p>The staff worker looked nonplussed by Vernon's high-and-mighty attitude but asked professionally, "And the reservation name?"</p><p>Vernon stuck out his chest, as though this would increase his influence. "Wayne," he said pompously. "Bruce Wayne."</p><p>The server's eyes widened. "Right this way." The server directed the family to a table at the back of the room. "I'm sure Mr Wayne will be along shorty." Vernon nodded, and directed his family at where to sit. Vernon sat at the end of the table, opposite where Mr Wayne would sit. Petunia sat next to Vernon so she could contribute to the conversation between Vernon and Mr Wayne while still being able to quieten Dudley if needed. Dudley was next to Petunia in attempt to keep him out of the adult conversation. Harry was next to Dudley, to keep him out of the way, where he could be seen but not have a say in anything.</p><p>When the server was out of earshot, Vernon looked at the family. He turned to Petunia first, "Alright love, if Mr Wayne asks about the family, we are a typical nuclear family who adopted <em>him</em>," he glared at Harry who sank into his seat, "after the death of his parents. The Wayne man adopted his kid, so he'll eat that up." Petunia nodded politely to show her understanding.</p><p>Vernon looked at Dudley next. "Alright Dudders, unless Mr Wayne talks to you, you do not say anything to him. This is an adult conversation, so to keep you busy we'll buy you whatever you want to eat." Dudley grinned at the bribe of food and immediately lunged for a menu.</p><p>Glaring, Vernon turned his attention to Harry. "You do not say anything to Mr Wayne. You can talk to the kid he brings, but you do not say or do anything that can ruin this for me. Understood?" Harry nodded and sat quietly until Mr Wayne and his adopted-son approached, both dressed in formal suits and ties. Mr Wayne appeared to be in his thirties and was lean and well-muscled as opposed to Vernon's blubber. The son looked to be in around twelve, and was tall and toned, compared to Dudley's fat and Harry's scrawniness.</p><p>Vernon stuck his hand out for a handshake. "Mr Wayne," he said professionally, trying to show superiority by tightly holding the handshake, only to wince as Mr Wayne returned the firm handshake.</p><p>"Call me Bruce," he replied with a sparking smile. "This is my ward, Dick." He indicated the boy standing with him, who gave a formal inclination of the head as Dudley tried to hide his giggles at the name.</p><p>"In that case, call me Vernon. This is my wife Petunia." He waved his hand to Petunia, who smiled in response. "Our son, Dudley." He pointed to Dudley, who was too busy to react as he was still trying to decide what he wanted from the menu. Finally, he pointed at Harry. "And this is our adopted son, who we kindly took in after the tragic deaths of his parents," Vernon said with false pride, already trying to manipulate Bruce's view of him.</p><p>Bruce Wayne nodded and assessed Harry, before offering out his hand for a handshake. Harry hesitated before shaking the hand, noticing the callous skin on his knuckles. "Pleased to meet you Harry. Sorry to hear about your parents," he said sincerely. Harry looked at Vernon, who was subtlety shaking his head at Harry, reminding him not to talk, so he resorted to nodding.</p><p>Bruce sat at the seat opposite Vernon while Dick looked between Dudley and Harry, deciding to sit opposite Harry. "Let's order and start our business talk, shall we?" Bruce said to the agreement of everyone.</p><p>Vernon stuck his hand out grandly and clicked his fingers loudly, attracting the attention of their server who walked over. Bruce was the first to order, "Steak, well done, with a diet coke please."</p><p>Dick was next, "Burger and fries, diet coke please."</p><p>Vernon leisurely conversed with Petunia and Dudley before ordering. "Two large mixed grills, one salad. One of your finest beers, a glass of your best wine, and one orange juice."</p><p>The server nodded and looked at Harry. "And for you?" he asked.</p><p>Harry was reluctant, he knew his Uncle would punish him for ordering anything expensive but would also punish him for looking suspicious and ordering cheaply. "Burger and fries," he settled on, mirroring Dick’s order. "With a glass of water please."</p><p>The server nodded, wrote down their order before taking their leave. Bruce and Vernon began their arduous conversation about work, while Petunia began to talk to Dudley to keep him from interrupting.</p><p>Harry and Dick both sat in silence, before Dick asked Harry where he was from.</p><p>"Surrey, in England," Harry whispered quietly, trying to be unheard by Vernon, an act that did not go unnoticed by Bruce, Dick, and Vernon, all of their eyes narrowing at him with various emotions.</p><p>Dick nodded. "And you came to Gotham for this." He gestured to the conversation between Vernon and Bruce.</p><p>"Yeah," Harry replied. "We're here for a week and then we go back home."</p><p>Dick was about to reply, when a loud scream sounded accompanied by most of the restaurant running out. Bruce held his hand up to stop Vernon talking as they looked at the building's entrance.</p><p>Standing there was a man with mossy green hair, bleach-white skin, and an eccentrically bright purple suit. The man was waving around a knife in his left hand and holding a gun in his other hand, a maniacal grin stretched across his face. Next to him was a slender woman, her blonde hair in pigtails dyed red and black, wearing a matching red and black leather outfit. In her hands was a large mallet that she was swinging round with ease despite its great size.</p><p>"Who are they?" Vernon asked Bruce, only to look and see that Bruce and Dick had both vanished while they were all distracted. "We should leave," Vernon decided. The four of them quickly rose and attempted to leave only for the green haired man to stop them, aiming his gun directly at them, the knife lazily held by his side.</p><p>The man cackled insanely at the sight of them. "Somebody call the paparazzi, there's a beached-whale in here," he yelled mockingly.</p><p>Vernon was instantly offended and advanced on the man, his face turning an angry purple. "Listen here, I am a respectable business man, unlike you," he shouted only to silenced as the knife was thrown through the air and embedded itself into Vernon's leg, much to the man and woman's amusement.</p><p>"Now, I'm in the mood for a game," the green haired man said, as he walked over to Vernon and ripped the knife from Vernon's leg, causing him to give out an agonising scream as blood leaked from the wound. The man continued to talk, not deterred by the screams or aura of fear in the air. "I want one of you," he waved his hand in the general vicinity of the Dursleys and Harry, "to die." He grinned, showing yellowing teeth. "But I don't want to pick. That would be too easy, too boring. You get to decide instead."</p><p>Harry's heart sunk, he knew they'd pick him in heartbeat and his worries were confirmed when his Uncle quickly shouted, "The boy. Kill the boy." He pointed at Harry.</p><p>The man sauntered over to Harry and looked him up and down, studying him. The man turned to look at the Dursley family. "Why kill him?" he asked, grinning broadly, his knife slowly dripping blood onto Harry’s suit.</p><p>His Aunt Petunia was the one to respond. "He's a freak, just like his parents were."</p><p>"Hmm," the man considered this answer, before shaking his head. "Wrong choice." The man raised his gun, aiming at Vernon's head before firing. The bullet pierced Vernon's head, exiting the back of it and sending a spray of blood at the floor behind him.</p><p>The room was filled by the Petunia's scream and the scent of urine as Dudley's body gave way to the fear. The man smirked at the reaction before looking at his accomplice. "Take care of her," he ordered, looking at Petunia.</p><p>The woman laughed, picking up her mallet and bringing it down with a sickening crunch as it impacted Petunia’s skull. Petunia's body crumpled instantly and fell to the floor, her head reduced to little more than pulp.</p><p>A new voice was heard behind them, this voice was deep and grizzly. "Joker," the voice yelled. "What have you done"?</p><p>The green-haired man, Joker, spun round excitedly. "Batman. I was wondering when you'd show up."</p><p>Batman stepped into view. He was wearing a dark grey costume with a black bat emblazoned on the chest. A cowl concealed the top half of his head, and gloves and boots covered his hands and feet. Behind was another boy, this one wearing a red chest cover and green boots and gloves.</p><p>"Enough talk," Batman declared. "Robin, get them."</p><p>Batman leapt over the podium separating him and Joker, dropping pellets which released smoke as he soared through the air. Using the distraction, Harry and Dudley both hid under tables, but both kept watching the scene unfold, almost entranced by the horror.</p><p>The Joker sprang through the air with his knife, which was swiftly deflected by Batman's reflexes as he blocked the attack with his arm. Batman grabbed Joker's arm and held it, pushing down on it before throwing Joker to the floor.</p><p>Batman did not wait until Joker was able to get back up, before charging delivering a flying knee to the man's head, which he did not get back up from.</p><p>Harry cheered silently as the Joker fell and turned to look at Robin fighting the woman. The woman was swinging her mallet wildly, but Robin was faster as he ducked and weaved to avoid it.</p><p>"You want do this the hard way, Harley?” Robin pulled out a metal stick from his sleeves which he connected and extended in his grasp. He attacked, swinging it at the woman's legs, tripping her up. Next, he threw what looked like bird-shaped boomerangs which pinned the woman to floor where she could not escape.</p><p>Dudley and Harry both sat in silence until police cars approached and took Joker and Harley Quinn away, both laughing as though they were sharing an inside joke. Bruce appeared in between the tables that Harry and Dudley were under. "You boys can come out now."</p><p>Dudley and Harry both scurried out from their hiding places, where Dudley immediately began to cry hysterically at the sight of his parents' bloody corpses. Bruce placed a hand on Dudley's shoulder. "I'm sorry about what has happened," he said truthfully. "Do you two have any family you could live with?"</p><p>Dudley gave a great sniff but nodded, thinking of his Aunt Marge. Harry also thought of his Aunt Marge and shook his head.</p><p>Bruce comforted Harry and placed a hand on his shoulder. <em>First his parents die, now this.</em> "Well then Harry, I guess you’ll just have to stay with me."</p><p>
