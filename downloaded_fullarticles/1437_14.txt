    <p>With everyone down in the Great Hall for dinner, Gryffindor tower was eerily quiet. There was a stillness in the air, as if the entire Castle were empty.  </p><p>Harry hadn’t gone down with his classmates—he wasn’t hungry--just the thought of food would turn his stomach, if he were to think of it.  </p><p>But he wasn’t thinking. Not at all. </p><p>Instead he stood alone, in the center of his dorm room, staring off into space in a numb sort-of-trance. He didn’t remember walking there, didn’t know why he was standing. Didn’t care. </p><p>A blank stretch of wall was in his line of sight, but his unfocussed eyes didn’t register it.  </p><p>Shivering, his mind tried to inform him—nudging at him—saying that he was cold. Blinking slowly, he looked down to realise he was still dressed in his school uniform, soaked through with water and blood.  </p><p><i>Malfoy’s blood</i>, he thought with a jolt to the chest. </p><p>A cold, spider-like sensation crawled up his spine. </p><p>He blinked rapidly, coming out of his daze. </p><p>Malfoy--<i>What have I done?</i> </p><p>‘<i>Fuck,</i>’ Harry uttered out loud. </p><p>He shook his head in an attempt to clear it.  </p><p>Peeling off his clothes in a rush, with stiff, shaky fingers as if the clothes burned him, he left them there in a pile at his feet. And, naked, clammy and cold, he hurried over to the bathroom and into a shower stall.  </p><p>Panting, Harry fumbled with the knob to set the water to near-scalding, and let it wash over him from head to toe. Let it soak in his hair, and run over his eyes, nose, mouth.  </p><p>His body shook … perhaps from having stood so long in cold, wet clothes. Or perhaps from the swirling emotions within himself, that he was trying very hard to ignore. <i>Just concentrate on the water. Focus on the heat</i>, he told himself. </p><p>Snatching a bar of soap from the rack, he scrubbed hard against his skin, fingernails and soap together. The hot steam and the smell of soap overpowered his senses. He made the mistake of looking down, seeing ribbons of red circling the drain. Blood. Malfoy’s blood. His head buzzed with white noise.  </p><p>Harry clenched his jaw, fixed his eyes on the white-tiled wall in front of him, and scrubbed harder.  </p><p>When he was done, with pruned fingertips and skin that felt raw from the abuse, Harry stepped out and toweled off. Walking back into the room, he sidestepped the pile of wet, bloody clothes and rummaged around in his trunk for a soft, clean cotton t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He changed quickly and climbed into bed, shutting the curtains around himself--shutting out the bloody clothes, shutting out the outside world. His breath came out in erratic bursts.  </p><p>He wanted sleep. He needed to put this day to rest and start new tomorrow. </p><p>But his body wouldn’t obey. <i>Malfoy</i>, his traitorous mind was reminding him. Screaming at him. </p><p><i>He’s going to be fine</i>, his thoughts countered, trying to relax through sheer will. <i>He’s fine</i>, his thoughts repeated. Snape had seen to that. Harry had watched Malfoy’s wounds being stitched back together.  </p><p><i>If Snape hadn’t been there—but he</i> had been <i>there.</i> </p><p>Harry’s mind whirled and his thoughts clashed, as he stared wide-eyed up at the canopy above him. If Snape hadn’t come--and Malfoy had bled out in front of him, with Harry’s body frozen from terror, from guilt … Malfoy would’ve <i>died</i>. In cold blood, right there in a Hogwarts bathroom. Harry would’ve murdered him. Harry would have become a murderer. </p><p>And for what? All he had meant to do was defend himself. </p><p>A heaviness settled low in Harry’s abdomen. He should never have cast that spell.  </p><p>The other, gentler, voice in his head told him it wasn’t his fault. The Half-blood Prince had written that note in the textbook, aside the words ‘<i>for enemies</i>’. How was Harry supposed to have known of its brutality? The Half-blood Prince had just been a student, hadn’t he? A 6th year, a 16-year-old, just like Harry. <i>Who—who would write something like that—something that tears someone’s chest apart?</i> </p><p>And Harry shouldn’t feel guilty--it was just Malfoy. Malfoy who was definitely up to something nefarious. And was almost certainly a Death Eater.  </p><p>He deserved it. He was going to cast <i>Crucio</i>-- </p><p><i>It wouldn’t have worked,</i> that chastising voice in his head, which sounded annoyingly like Hermione, said. Malfoy had looked like a cornered animal, he was frightened, vulnerable.  </p><p>The cold words, ‘You have to mean it,’ echoed in his mind.  </p><p>Harry groaned, flipping over onto his stomach and burying his head deep into the pillow.  </p><p>He could see Malfoy’s tear-stained face behind his closed eyelids. This was the same person who called Hermione a Mudblood, who’d made ‘Potter Stinks’ badges, who’d stomped on his nose. But pangs of something like sympathy were clawing away in his chest. Malfoy had been sobbing. He’d looked … broken. Helpless. </p><p>It was far too much to process right then. Harry eventually fell into a fitful sleep.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~</p>
</center>He woke up much later, screaming, with tears streaming down his face.<p>There was a gasp. Then, ‘Harry?’ </p><p>Harry was gulping for air, shaking, his heart pounding and threatening to break through his chest. </p><p>‘Harry?’ came Ron’s voice again, louder now, concerned and groggy.  </p><p>Harry tried to right himself, his eyes began to adjust to the darkness. He could see the soft cotton curtains. A mahogany bedpost. He’s in his bed. ‘I’m okay, Ron, just a nightmare,’ he managed to utter. ‘Go back to sleep.’ </p><p>Ron hesitated, but decided not to press it. ‘Alright, mate. G’night.’  </p><p>He heard Ron’s head hit the pillow again, heard the creak of his bed as he turned on his side, and listened for his breath slowing, signaling a return to sleep. </p><p>But Harry wasn’t going to get back to sleep so easily. He’d dreamt of Malfoy, sat in bed in the hospital wing … and Snape’s healing spell hadn’t stuck--the wounds were opening up again. He’d been pleading with Harry to make it stop; he’d been crying again. Malfoy had begged Harry, said <i>please</i> ... his grey eyes huge and red-rimmed and wet, and his long pale fingers outstretched towards him. </p><p>His wounds had opened, wider and wider. There’d been so much redness. Flesh and blood and then bone exposed. Blood pouring out and soaking the bed. The white of Malfoy's ribcage. Harry had been unable to move, unable to speak. Frozen in place. <i>Again</i>. The worst part was when Malfoy had died, slumping back with a soft gasp, and the life gone from his eyes. That’d been when Harry woke up. </p><p>He trembled in bed, his mind screaming at him that it might be true. Malfoy’s wounds could be reopening. He could be dying, alone, at that very moment. Harry could still be <i>killing him</i>. </p><p>Harry couldn’t stand it.  </p><p>He got up, threw on his Invisibility cloak, and set out for the hospital wing.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~</p>
</center>Harry’s heart pounded as he approached the hospital wing doors. He knew Malfoy was probably fine. But what if he wasn’t? He had to know. He had to see for himself. He would just slip in quietly and have a look, appease his fears, and then be out of there without anyone knowing.<p>He pushed open the heavy wooden door. It creaked. Harry froze and winced. </p><p>‘Who’s there?’ asked a tiny voice. </p><p>Harry couldn’t answer, couldn’t find his voice. He didn’t want Malfoy to <i>know</i>.  </p><p>His feet moved him forward, deeper into the dark hospital wing. </p><p>‘Who’s there?’ The voice was a little louder this time, but the way it wavered betrayed nervousness. ‘Lumos.’ </p><p>Harry was still under the Invisibility cloak, so all Malfoy had managed to do was illuminate himself, sitting up in bed, and the space around him. Harry stepped closer to the foot of Malfoy’s bed, while scanning his body. Looking for signs of wounds. Looking for blood. </p><p>Malfoy was even paler than usual, something Harry wouldn’t have thought possible. He’d lost the colour in his lips, and he had dark rings around his eyes. He looked frail—too skinny. But he was alive. And intact. Harry breathed out a shaky sigh, it almost felt like relief. But the images from his dream were still haunting him enough that the relief wasn’t quite complete. Something was still there, some <i>feeling</i>, knocking on his ribs. </p><p>He could go now, he <i>should</i> go now. Malfoy was fine, and he’d have no idea Harry had checked on him in the night. But Harry’s feet seemed glued to the floor. </p><p>Malfoy slumped back against the headboard, letting his wand fall to the side. ‘Potter,’ he uttered, sounding defeated. Then, casually adding, ‘Come to finish me off?’ </p><p>That shocked Harry, pulling him out of his thoughts. He tore off the cloak.  </p><p>Malfoy just regarded him with a look of weary acceptance. ‘Go on, then.’ </p><p>‘No!’ Harry blurted out. He wouldn’t--he wasn’t like that-- </p><p>Malfoy raised an eyebrow. ‘No? I suppose it wouldn’t be very Gryffindor of you to off me in a hospital bed. Wouldn’t be very <i>chivalrous</i>,’ he practically spat the word, ‘eh, Potter?’ </p><p>Harry didn't have a witty retort, he just pressed his lips together, staring at Malfoy’s face. It was carefully arranged in a haughty mask of indifference, but there were cracks in it. He could see it in the way Malfoy blinked.  </p><p>‘So why the late-night visit, hmm? Come to gloat?’ Malfoy asked. </p><p>Harry shook his head, frowning. He knew he should say something. Saying ‘I’m sorry’ would be the right thing to do. But how could he? How could he say those words to <i>Malfoy</i>? </p><p>‘Well?’ Malfoy demanded, getting visibly frustrated.  </p><p>‘I needed to see if you’re okay,’ Harry found himself saying, and immediately wished he hadn’t, because those words were too honest. </p><p>It was Malfoy’s turn to be shocked, though he tried to hide it. His face contorted into what looked like surprise, then doubt, then something more complicated. His eyes were blinking slowly at Harry, Harry didn’t know what it meant. And then, just like that, the face was blank again, an impenetrable wall.  </p><p>‘I’m fine. No thanks to you. Now if that’s all, I’d like to be left alone--’ </p><p>‘Are you sure you’re okay? Your lips are so pale.’ Harry blurted out, and then immediately wished he hadn’t said that either. He knew he should really go back to bed. If it were day--if he hadn’t had that nightmare, he wouldn’t be talking like this. He wouldn’t say anything out loud about his nemesis’ lips. Especially not … <i>to him</i>. Even if there’s something wrong and they aren’t their usual pink--</p><p>
Malfoy licked his lips, seemingly involuntarily. Harry watched the movement. ‘Yes, well, I lost a lot of blood. I wonder why?’ 
</p><p>
Harry’s jaw muscle twitched. ‘I didn’t know what the spell did.’ 
</p><p>
Malfoy didn’t appear to care. He should be mad, he should be shouting at Harry, asking how he could be so <i>stupid</i>. Instead, he seemed … weary. ‘Okay. Are you done?’ 
</p><p>
Harry was still rooted to the spot. He should leave. Malfoy was fine. There was nothing left to say. Except … But, no, it was too hard to say ‘I’m sorry’. This was Malfoy. He’d certainly never apologised for stomping on his face. But, on the other hand, his conscience was nagging at him, telling him that he <i>had</i> to say it. 
</p><p>
He regarded Malfoy, weakened and sitting up in his hospital bed, wearing the generic hospital-issued striped pajamas. Looking like a normal sick boy, not at all like the looming threat Harry had been seeing him as this year. Just a regular person. (Albeit too pale and too blond and kind of elegant still--in a poncy way.) Almost a regular person you could say ‘I’m sorry’ to. 
</p><p>
‘No,’ he finally said, in answer to Malfoy’s question--he wasn’t done. Stalling, he asked again, ‘Are you really alright?’ 
</p><p>
Malfoy sighed. ‘Come here.’
</p><p>
Harry hesitated. ‘Um …' 
</p><p>
Malfoy shot him a look. ‘Eloquent. Come on.’ He waved to a spot beside his bed. 
</p><p>
Harry obeyed, tentatively. That’s when something happened that Harry’s mind couldn’t quite process: Malfoy was unbuttoning his pajama top. 
</p><p>
‘What are you--” Harry started, unsure. 
</p><p>
Malfoy shot him another look. ‘You keep asking if I’m fine. I suppose if you won’t believe me, I’ll have to show you. Then perhaps you will finally leave me alone,’ he said, heavily enunciating the words <i>leave me alone</i>. 
</p><p>
Harry nodded, watching with widening eyes. Inch after inch of pale skin was exposed as Malfoy’s slender, nimble fingers undid each button. When he was done, he threw open the shirt with a quick flourish, neutrally watching for Harry’s reaction.
</p><p>
And Harry’s reaction was not what Harry would have expected from himself. Thin pink lines of raised flesh remained from the curse, but his body seemed solid, put-together. Mostly healed. Malfoy’s torso was as pale as the rest of him, and his body lean but muscular, from years of Quidditch. His nipples were almost obscene, pink and pebbled right there on his chest. Malfoy’s nipples. He’d never thought of Malfoy having nipples, though obviously he would have them ... Not to mention the trail of white-blond hairs that started at that little innie-bellybutton and travelled downwards underneath the blanket …  
</p><p>
Harry’s face felt hot. Suddenly the intimacy of this strange meeting struck him. He was alone, in the hospital wing, at night, with a nearly-shirtless Draco Malfoy, who, inexplicably, might be, could be--an attractive person. It was enough to flip one’s world upside down. 
</p><p>
‘Okay,’ Harry said, but his mouth had become dry at some point, so it came out a little croaky. 
</p><p>
Malfoy eyed him strangely, and closed his pajama top without buttoning it up. ‘Alright?’ 
</p><p>
‘Yeah,’ Harry said. He should go. This was weird. He’s going to go. As an afterthought, he said, ‘Yeah. But, will it scar?’ 
</p><p>
Malfoy pursed his lips, but shrugged. ‘Maybe.’ 
</p><p>
 Harry ran fingers through his hair, inadvertently ruffling it up worse. Malfoy seemed to notice, but didn’t comment. 
</p><p>
‘I’m sorry,’ Harry said, at last. It felt like he was the one exposed. 
</p><p>
 Malfoy eyed him, his expression betraying nothing. He finally let out a weary sigh and, rolling his eyes, said, ‘Fine. I accept your apology. Now that your conscience is appeased, you can run along back to your dorm room, and everything can go back to the way it was.’ 
</p><p>
Harry silently agreed, he wanted everything to go back to normal. Wanted to be the good guy, with Malfoy as the bad guy he had to keep his eye on. The way it’d been for over 5 years. The past 24 hours had been too confusing. Harry was supposed to be good, not a near-murderer. And Draco Malfoy was supposed to be bad. Not a crying, vulnerable boy whose only confidant was a ghost. 
</p><p>
 He nodded, turned, and walked right out of the hospital wing. His heart was still pounding as he threw the Invisibility cloak back on, and set off towards Gryffindor Tower. 
</p><p>
  <i></i>
</p><p>
  <i></i>
</p><p>
He tried to keep his mind carefully blank. He’d said, ‘I’m sorry,’ and done what he’d set out to do. That … was that. Back to normal, now. Conscience: appeased. 
</p><p>
But as the staircase he stood on began to move, Malfoy’s words came back to Harry in a flash. The ones from the bathroom, that he’d overheard spoken to Myrtle. <i>‘No one can help me … I can’t do it … I can’t … It won’t work … and unless I do it soon … he says he’ll kill me …' </i> 
</p><p>
Harry gripped the banister tight.  
</p><p>
He hesitated for a beat.
</p><p>
Then, he made himself turn back.
</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~</p>
</center><p>He found Malfoy, curled in on himself, clinging to a pillow on his hospital bed, silently crying.</p><p>‘Malfoy--’ Harry blurted out, taken aback. </p><p>‘<i>Go away.</i>’ he barked out, before a sniffle, making his words lose some of their bite. </p><p>‘What happened?’ </p><p>Malfoy choked out a bitter, ‘Nothing. Nothing at all.’ </p><p>‘But when I left, you were fine--’ </p><p>‘I was trying to hold it together, alright? Is that what you wanted to hear?’  </p><p>‘I--No! But …'  </p><p>‘Leave me alone, Potter.’ </p><p>‘No. I-- I don’t want to leave you like this,’ Harry said, uneasily but earnestly, shifting his weight to his other leg. </p><p>‘Why not? You hate me. We hate each other.’ </p><p>‘I don’t … hate you …' he said slowly, realising that it was the truth as he spoke. His heart pounded with the admission. When had he stopped hating Malfoy? </p><p>Malfoy stayed silent. He had a hand covering his eyes and his shoulders shook gently. Harry took a few tentative steps forward, eyeing the bed, thinking he might sit on it ...  </p><p>The bed dipped as he sat, and he heard Malfoy suck in a shaky breath. Harry faced the blank wall behind Malfoy’s headboard, unsure of what to do, but knowing that he couldn’t just leave.  </p><p>‘Is it … my fault?’ Harry asked after a moment, omitting the words <i>that you’re crying</i>. </p><p>‘Fuck off, Potter. The world doesn’t revolve around you.’ </p><p>That stung a bit. ‘Right. I know. I only ask because I mauled you a few hours ago …’ </p><p>Malfoy snorted a laugh, and then, Malfoy sighed. His quivering shoulders slowed down, eventually stopping their movements altogether. He sniffed and wiped the back of his hand over his nose, then turned to look at Harry, which gave Harry a good look at Malfoy’s red-rimmed eyes and blotchy wet face. Harry felt a mad urge to reach over and wipe at Malfoy’s tears with his fingers. </p><p>‘It’s not you, it’s the Dark Lord. Who else would it be?’ Malfoy said, looking up at him, expression guarded. </p><p>Nodding slowly, Harry tentatively asked, ‘Do you ... want to talk about it?’ </p><p>‘Ha! With the Chosen One? Don't be stupid.’ </p><p>Harry deflated, but decided to persist. ‘You could though … And I could …’ <i>No one can help me</i>. He sucked in a breath. ‘I can help you.’ </p><p>‘Don’t make me laugh,’ Malfoy said darkly. ‘You can’t help me.’ </p><p>‘Maybe I can’t, by myself, but …’ Harry looked away at the wall, struggling to <i>think</i>. ‘Dumbledore can … and the Order of the Phoenix. Your family can go to a safe house, you can all be protected.’ </p><p>‘They wouldn’t. They would never help me and my family.’ </p><p>Harry looked back at Malfoy’s face, and chewed on the side of his bottom lip. ‘Why not?’ </p><p>Malfoy pulled up the pajama sleeve on his left arm and thrust it in Harry’s direction, avoiding Harry’s eyes. The Dark Mark was there, black and twisty and horrible. Harry had been right. But he found no joy in that now. Now he just felt … was it sadness? </p><p>Harry made a choice then. It was risky, and probably foolish.  </p><p>‘The Mark doesn’t make a difference in whether or not you get helped … For the record ... I don’t believe you accepted it willingly.’ </p><p>Malfoy made a disbelieving noise. </p><p>‘Well, that’s what I think. And I’d swear on my life that your family would be protected,’ he said, hoping that he truly could follow through with that promise.  </p><p>Malfoy’s silvery eyes stared up at him. ‘You’d make an Unbreakable Vow?’ </p><p>Harry swallowed, but found himself nodding. ‘Yes. I would.’ </p><p>Malfoy blinked in surprise. Then, the edge of Malfoy’s mouth quirked up, but it wasn’t quite a smile. ‘I wouldn’t ask you to ...’  </p><p>And, maybe because it was the middle of the night (because in the middle of the night it’s easier to be honest), Malfoy looked off to his right, and speaking softly, said, ‘The Dark Lord has given me a task. If I don’t do it, he’ll kill me and my family. I’m supposed to …' He groaned suddenly, and rubbed his eyes.  </p><p>Harry waited. </p><p>‘I’ve been given an impossible task.’ </p><p>‘What is it?’ Harry asked breathily. </p><p>Malfoy was silent for a few moments. Thinking.  </p><p>Harry knew there was absolutely no reason for Malfoy to trust him, to tell him anything. But he hoped-- </p><p>Finally, Malfoy seemed to come to a decision. In a neutral tone, he said, ‘I’m supposed to kill Dumbledore. And find a way to let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.’ </p><p>Harry slumped, burying his face in his hands. It was worse than he could’ve imagined. ‘How far have you gotten?’ </p><p>‘Not far at all.’ Malfoy looked miserable.  </p><p>Harry sat back up. ‘Okay,’ he said with some determination. ‘And you’ll let me help you?’ </p><p>Eyeing him warily, he said, ‘Truthfully ... I’m terrified of all my options.’ </p><p>Harry smiled a little. ‘This is where dumb Gryffindor courage comes in handy.’ </p><p>Malfoy rolled his eyes, exhaled, then smiled. It wasn’t very big, and it was clouded in hesitancy and fear, but Harry decided he liked it. It was so much better than a sneer.  </p><p>It faded as quickly as it’d come. ‘Why would you help me?’ </p><p>Harry wasn’t really sure himself, but he did know one reason: ‘I want to give you a choice. I … think you deserve one. I’m not sure anyone has ever given you a real choice before.’ </p><p>Malfoy looked away, seeming lost in thought. ‘Perhaps ...’ </p><p>‘So will you? Let me help you?’ </p><p>‘You can try.’ He shook his head, frowning. Then, wincing as if it were painful to say, he said, ‘Yes.’ </p><p>Malfoy’s answer simultaneously sparked joy, terror, and raw determination in Harry. He hoped to all the gods that he could pull it off. </p><p>‘I’m going to Dumbledore. Tonight. Okay? You won’t be able to take it back.’ Harry said, all of a sudden worrying that Malfoy would take it back. Undo everything they’d talked about. </p><p>‘Okay, Potter,’ Malfoy answered, looking very tired. He closed his eyes and arranged himself more comfortably in the bed.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~</p>
</center>Professor Dumbledore had already been awake, sitting at his desk as if already anticipating Harry’s visit.<p>Harry told him everything, blabbering on, while Dumbledore watched Harry’s face from behind his half-moon spectacles, wearing a funny little smile. He waited until Harry was done and nearly panting, before he spoke. </p><p>And before long, a plan was set in motion. </p><p>They were going to get Malfoy’s family to a safe house. They were going to protect them, protect <i>him</i>. </p><p>Afterwards, Harry caught glimpses of a blossoming purple and orange sunrise through the windows as he rushed by. He could’ve gone back to his dorm room, but he thought Malfoy should know about the meeting straight away. So, he headed back to the hospital wing. </p><p>‘Hey.’ Harry shook Malfoy’s shoulder. ‘I talked to Dumbledore. We’ve got a plan--’ </p><p>Malfoy groaned into his pillow, mumbling, ‘Shut up. ‘M sleeping.’ </p><p>‘But I thought you’d want to know--’ </p><p>‘Tell me in twelve hours, Scarhead.’ </p><p>‘<i>Twelve</i> hours?’ That would be, like, <i>6pm</i>. </p><p>Malfoy groaned, cracking open one eyelid to glare at Harry. ‘Lie down. Tell me about it when I wake up. You bastard.’ </p><p>Harry blinked in disbelief, while Malfoy rolled onto his side and soon started breathing softly, like a sleeping person. So, Harry placed his glasses on the nightstand beside Malfoy’s bed, and climbed in under the blankets. If Malfoy chastised him for it later, he could always say Malfoy had told him to.  </p><p>It didn’t occur to him, at all, that the whole room was full of empty beds. That maybe Malfoy hadn’t meant for them to share. </p><p>The bed felt warm and inviting from Malfoy’s body heat, the small bed barely accommodated them both, leaving about 5 centimetres between them. He drifted off easily, into a deep sleep.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~</p>
</center>While lying on his back comfortably, Harry woke up slowly to sunlight blaring through the hospital wing windows. It had to be at least noon. He could feel soft pressure against his leg, and it quickly dawned on him that it was a knee and a foot. Yesterday’s events came flooding back, a confusing hodge-podge of situations and feelings, that left a nervous sort-of weight on Harry’s chest. Draco Malfoy. He’d offered to help him. And, he was currently lying in bed with said person. Currently feeling parts of that person’s leg pressed against his own leg. There were soft sounds of sleeping breaths, coming from Harry’s side. He turned to look, and his breath hitched. Malfoy’s body was facing him, curled up with arms held tight to his chest, and clenched hands tucked under chin, looking rather sleep-ruffled with blond hair in disarray.<p>Without his glasses on, only Malfoy’s face was in focus, everything else blurry. Harry noticed the arch of Malfoy’s eyebrows, his many eyelashes, the paper-thin eyelids with veins visible under the skin, the tip of his nose, the soft dip of skin between the nose and mouth that you could press a fingertip into. Malfoy’s features were softened, lips slightly parted, and by the looks of it, they had regained their colour. Something in Harry’s chest felt sharp, and, in that moment, he felt he might do anything to keep Malfoy this peaceful. </p><p>What had gotten in to him? </p><p>He didn’t know how long he’d been looking, before Madam Pomfrey came in with heels clacking. He fumbled around for his glasses on the nightstand, and put them on. </p><p>She regarded him, in bed with Malfoy, with pursed lips. ‘Mr Potter.’ </p><p>He smiled sheepishly at the same time as Malfoy began to stretch like a cat, his foot pressing harder into Harry’s leg. </p><p>‘Mm, five more minutes,’ Malfoy mumbled. </p><p>Madam Pomfrey put her hands on her hips. ‘Now, Mr Malfoy, I know you’ve been through quite an ordeal, and I’m quite glad that you and Mr Potter have <i>reconciled</i>, but it’s well-past noon and you are due for your next round of potions.’ </p><p>Malfoy’s eyes snapped open, and immediately looked at Harry’s face. His eyes travelled down the bed, registering the fact that Harry’s body was, in fact, underneath the blankets with him on the single bed. He pulled his leg away. </p><p>Harry was beginning to feel rather foolish, expecting to get chewed out at any moment. Possibly shoved. Or worse. </p><p>Instead, Malfoy <i>blushed</i>. Red blotchy smudges on his cheeks. </p><p>Then he cleared his throat and sat up in bed, nodding curtly to Madam Pomfrey. He’d buttoned up his pajama top at some point, Harry noted. </p><p>Madam Pomfrey busied herself with getting the potions ready, lining them up on a silver tray, as Harry slid, awkwardly, out from underneath the blankets.  </p><p>‘I’ll just--’ he began, making to leave. </p><p>‘I thought you had something to tell me, Potter,’ Malfoy said, not looking at him. </p><p>‘Oh. Right. Yeah. Then I’ll just--’ He sat back down on the bed, over the blanket now. Was the morning after sleeping beside someone always so awkward? <i>Maybe just with arch-enemies</i>, he mused, folding his hands in his lap to keep from fidgeting. </p><p>Madam Pomfrey was soon ready with the potions, and Harry watched as Malfoy knocked each of them back with a wrinkled nose. Harry looked away quickly. It was rude to stare. </p><p>‘Very good,’ said Madam Pomfrey. ‘I’ve called the house elves to bring you <i>both</i>--’ She shot Harry a look. ‘--some lunch. Mr Malfoy, you can go back to your dorms after you eat. I advise you not to over-exert yourself, and see me again in 24 hours for your next dose, or earlier, if you experience any skin irritation.’ </p><p>Malfoy nodded. ‘Thank you.’ </p><p>A house elf appeared with a pop, carrying a huge tray of roast beef sandwiches and glasses of pumpkin juice. Harry’s stomach growled in anticipation. The elf left with a bow, and, just like that, it was just the two of them alone in the hospital wing again. </p><p>Harry attacked the sandwiches with gusto, Malfoy nibbled away at one, shooting Harry side-eyed glances of mild disgust. </p><p>When Harry’s hunger was satisfied (he’d forgot that he hadn’t eaten for 24 hours), and Malfoy was still nibbling away, Harry filled him in on the meeting with Dumbledore.  </p><p>Malfoy nodded along, then was silent for a while afterwards. He flicked breadcrumbs off the blanket with his fingers. </p><p>Harry couldn’t wait any longer. His eyes flitted from Malfoy’s fingers on the blanket, to the soft, thoughtful expression on Malfoy’s face, to his <i>hair</i>--nearly white in the midday light and sticking up in all directions. ‘Does your hair always look like that when you wake up?’ </p><p>Malfoy’s eyes snapped to stare at Harry, looked vaguely horrified. ‘Look like <i>what</i>?’ He lifted his hands, intending to smooth his hair. </p><p>‘No!’ Harry called, grabbing Malfoy’s wrists before he could. ‘It’s so <i>messy</i>.’ </p><p>‘Unhand me, you barbarian!’ </p><p>‘Leave it! It’s messier than <i>mine</i>.’ </p><p>Malfoy was scandalized, struggling against Harry’s vice-like grip. ‘Potter, I swear--’ </p><p>And then Harry found himself lying breathlessly on his back, with Malfoy pinning Harry’s wrists to the bed. Malfoy was breathing heavily, with dark eyes glaring down at Harry.  </p><p>‘Draco?’ interrupted a female voice. </p><p>Malfoy’s glare on Harry intensified, and he, somewhat reluctantly, released Harry with a final push against his wrists, and leaned back onto his knees to face his visitor. The sheet and blanket were all twisted up around them. </p><p>‘Pansy.’ He ran one hand casually through his hair, leaving it smoothed, but still a little tousled.  </p><p>Harry, from his vantage point lying on his back, looked from Malfoy to Parkinson, and back. Parkinson looked like she tasted something sour.  </p><p>‘Are you coming back to the dorms today?’ she asked, blatantly ignoring Harry, but Harry suspected she’d hear about his visit later. He wondered what Malfoy would say-- </p><p>‘Yes, in fact, Madam Pomfrey has informed me that I’m free to go.’ </p><p>Parkinson’s eyes darted to Harry, eyeing him sharply. ‘Wonderful news.’  </p><p>There was a long pause, as she glared daggers at Harry. </p><p>‘Was there anything else?’ Malfoy asked. </p><p>Parkinson’s gaze flashed back to Malfoy, and, for a moment, they seemed to be communicating non-verbally.  </p><p>‘No, I’m sure I’ll see you <i>shortly</i>.’ </p><p>Malfoy nodded, and Parkinson spun around, gliding away. </p><p>‘Your girlfriend is intense,’ Harry mused, picking himself up into a sitting position. </p><p>Malfoy looked at him oddly. ‘She isn’t.’ </p><p>‘Isn’t intense?’ </p><p>‘She isn’t my girlfriend.’ </p><p>That was … interesting. To note. ‘Oh.’ </p><p>‘Yes, “oh”.’ Malfoy cleared his throat, looking away. ‘And you, with the Weaslette?’ Malfoy asked casually. Harry noticed his ears looked pink. That was good, probably. Meant he had enough blood now, Harry figured. </p><p>Oh, right, Malfoy had asked a question. <i>The Weaslette, Weaslette … </i>Harry blinked at Malfoy a few times. ‘Ginny? Um, no, we’re not …' </p><p>‘Right. Anyway, Potter, I think it’s time I got back.’ Malfoy said, hurriedly, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes. </p><p>‘Right, me too. Hermione and Ron must be wondering where I am …' Malfoy frowned at the mention of their names. </p><p>‘Yes, well, I’m going to get dressed. I’ll see you around, Potter.’ </p><p>Harry hesitated. ‘You will though, right? See me around? We’re sort-of friends now, aren’t we?’ </p><p>‘Sort-of friends,’ Malfoy echoed. ‘Maybe, I don’t know. Whatever. Regardless, you should go.’ </p><p>‘Right, okay, um … see ya.’ </p><p>Malfoy didn’t say anything in response.  </p><p>Harry wore his cloak back to Gryffindor tower; he didn’t want the attention that wearing pajamas midday might attract. He mentally tried to recap everything, to get it all straight. But Malfoy felt like an enigma.  </p><p>It didn’t matter, he told himself. What mattered was that he had earned a semblance of trust, enough for Malfoy to confide in him, to let Harry help him. It made him feel sort-of warm inside, in his chest.</p>

</center>Harry came back to an empty common room. He realised, belatedly, that everyone was at class. He hadn’t meant to skip classes, he hadn’t even thought about them. It was surprising that no one had come to fetch him, though it was possible Professor Dumbledore dismissed him for the day.<p>Later on, Hermione and Ron woke him from a light nap he was enjoying, in his favourite armchair by the fireplace. They looked worried. </p><p>‘Harry! Where have you <i>been</i>?’ said Hermione. </p><p>‘Yeah, mate, what’s been going on? I remembered you had that nightmare last night, then you weren’t in your bed in the morning,’ Ron said, scratching a spot on his temple. ‘We thought you might’ve gone down for breakfast early … but it was like you’d disappeared.’ </p><p>Harry looked at both of his worried friends. He said, carefully, ‘I was in the hospital wing--’ </p><p>‘Oh Harry! Are you alright, were you hurt?’ Hermione said. </p><p>‘No! No, that’s not it at all … I was … You see …' He just <i>knew</i> they weren’t going to understand. And it felt like a private thing—something he wanted to keep all for himself. But … if he was going to be friends with Malfoy, his best friends were going to have to find out sometime. He bit his lip, then said, ‘I was with Malfoy.’ </p><p>That struck the two of them dumb.  </p><p>‘Malfoy,’ Hermione echoed. ‘Why?’ </p><p>‘We talked … I apologised for … well, you know. I ended up sleeping there.’ </p><p>Hermione narrowed her eyes, gears were turning. ‘You spent all night with Draco Malfoy?’ </p><p>Ron’s mouth was open, he was looking from Hermione to Harry and back. </p><p>‘Yeah.’ Harry shrugged.  </p><p>‘Malfoy.’ The name sounded bitter coming out of Ron’s mouth. ‘<i>The</i> Malfoy who has been nothing but shit to us, who called Hermione the m-word?’ </p><p>‘Well … yes,’ Harry answered weakly.  </p><p>Hermione pursed her lips. </p><p>‘He’s joining our side … I don’t think he wants to be a Death Eater. I offered to … help him,’ Harry added. </p><p>‘What?! Harry, <i>you’re</i> the one who has been insisting all year that Malfoy is up to something!’ she poked a finger at Harry’s chest. ‘You can’t trust him! Don’t you think that whatever this is—with him—could be a trap? I really feel like—like you’re making a terrible mistake!’  </p><p>Something in Harry’s stomach swirled.  </p><p>‘I have to agree with Hermione,’ Ron said, shaking his head in disbelief. ‘This is <i>mental</i>.’ </p><p>‘It’s fine, okay?’ Harry tried to protest. ‘I’ve spoken to Dumbledore, I’ve told him everything. There’s a plan.’ </p><p>That shut them up a little, to Harry’s relief. Hermione finally relented, ‘Okay Harry, I’m just glad that Dumbledore is aware.’ She sighed. ‘But people don’t <i>change</i>, not really, and certainly not overnight.’ </p><p>Harry nodded miserably, not knowing whether or not she was right. </p><p>‘I hope you know what you’re doing, but, well—we always have your back, you know that?’ </p><p>Ron nodded agreement with his girlfriend, but Harry could tell he was very opposed to the idea of Harry being friendly with Malfoy. And Harry couldn’t really fault him for it. </p><p>Maybe his friends had a point, maybe he was making a terrible mistake.</p>

  <p>~~</p>
</center>Saturday’s detention with Snape came and went, as his thoughts had been full of Malfoy. Wondering if he could really trust Malfoy, wondering if he had done the right thing, wondering when he was going to talk to Malfoy again … He hadn’t really even reacted to Snape’s choice of detention. He didn’t care that the Marauders got into trouble in school—they were just kids.<p>He returned to the common room afterwards to learn Gryffindor had won Quidditch. Everyone was cheering and celebrating and Harry was just getting his bearings--a bit overwhelmed by the sudden crowd and noise--when Ginny had run at him with a look of determination on her face. Determined about what, he didn’t know. He was surprised, as he watched her approach, and something adjusted in his mind to remind him that he <i>liked</i> Ginny. She was coming at him, big brown eyes sparkling, and pink lips smiling. Ginny was familiar, he told himself. She was undeniably <i>good</i> and trustworthy. She was like family. </p><p>As she approached, a thought passed through his mind for a moment--that he could kiss her, it had been what he’d wanted for a long time, hadn’t it? She was single now, and so was he. So, he did. She’d leapt into his arms … and he brought their lips together, and … it wasn’t bad. </p><p>The following days passed by quickly; Harry didn’t get a chance to speak to Malfoy.  </p><p>In Potions class, Malfoy had been alone at a workstation. It was the perfect opportunity—they could partner up. They could talk. He started off towards him, when Hermione grabbed his arm. </p><p>‘Partner with me, Harry?’  </p><p>‘Um …’ he said, his eyes flashing over to the back of Malfoy’s blond head. He got ready to protest—but at that moment, Blaise Zabini parked himself down beside Malfoy. ‘Yeah, okay,’ he finished, disappointed. </p><p>Other times, Harry tried to seek him out, but every time the opportunity seemed to strike, Hermione found something to distract him with. Things like: an essay due in a week, a personal favour (‘Please, Harry, will you bring this box of cookies over to Hagrid? I would, but I’m just so swamped with schoolwork.’), or an appeal to spend more time with Ron (‘He’s feeling a bit neglected, Harry.’) </p><p>Harry was beginning to suspect Hermione had an ulterior motive to all these interruptions. </p><p>Although there was one time that Harry and Malfoy made eye contact across the Great Hall, and Malfoy had nodded at him. It made Harry feel warm inside. He’d smiled, and Malfoy had blinked back at him, his face softening. The edge of his mouth quirked up a little bit.  It had left Harry feeling breathless. Hermione had noticed the whole thing. </p><p>She liked to remind him with little hints from time to time that he couldn’t trust Malfoy (‘Remember when Malfoy dressed as a Dementor to frighten you?’), and Harry could admit to himself that there was a chance, a small chance that she was right, that Malfoy was still dangerous. But all he had to do was remember that nod, that little smile, or Malfoy crying on the bed, or his foot against Harry’s leg, and those doubts got blurry.  </p><p>Ron, on the other hand, was avoiding the subject of Malfoy at all costs. </p><p>Weeks passed by: full of classes, and detentions, and Ginny. And it was fine, it all felt very <i>normal</i>. </p><p>Until Professor Dumbledore called Harry into his office.</p>

</center>‘I’ve forgot my Charms assignment,’ Harry lied.<p>Hermione nodded, distracted by looking in her bag for a stick of lip balm as they walked to class. </p><p>‘I’ll meet you guys there,’ Harry added. </p><p>‘Okay mate,’ said Ron. </p><p>Harry made to go back to the Tower, then ducked into an alcove to throw on his Invisibility cloak. Mental that he had to go through all this, just to talk to Malfoy. </p><p>He raced through the halls, carefully rushing past Hermione and Ron, so as not to brush up against them. He wound through the hallways, eyes searching. Then, he saw it: the flash of white-blond hair. </p><p>He tore off his cloak and stuffed it in his bag. </p><p>‘Malfoy!’ Harry called after Malfoy’s retreating back, proud of himself for having successfully given Hermione and Ron the slip. He felt a little thrill high in his chest. ‘Malfoy, wait up!’ </p><p>Malfoy whirled, his silver eyes flashing with mirth. ‘What do you want?’ </p><p>Taken aback, Harry stopped in his tracks; he’d thought everything was good between them. ‘I need to speak to you …’ He licked his lips. ‘I have news.’ </p><p>Malfoy sized him up. ‘Deigning to speak with me today, hmm? Must be important.’ </p><p>Harry didn’t get it. ‘What? We could speak any day--’ Well, if Hermione and Ron would just <i>let him</i>. </p><p>‘Too busy snogging the Weaslette, I’d wager.’ </p><p>Harry felt a blush heat his cheeks. ‘It isn’t ...’ </p><p>‘It isn’t what?’ </p><p><i>Like that</i>, he’d almost said. Though that would be an outright lie. He didn’t know why he felt so defensive. And, fuck, there was something more important to talk about than his relationship with Ginny. </p><p>Harry took a breath. ‘Can’t we just, y’know, go somewhere private?’ </p><p>Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. ‘Fine.’ He <i>Alohamora</i>-ed an empty classroom nearby, and held the door open with a bitter, ‘After you.’ </p><p>Malfoy sat on top of a desk, his long legs dangling. Harry noticed his heartrate had increased somewhere along the line. Why was he so uncomfortable? Oh right, because he thought they were friends, and now Malfoy was treating him like he used to, and Harry <i>hated</i> it. </p><p>He sat in a chair a few spaces away from Malfoy, and decided to ignore whatever he was feeling and get down to business. </p><p>‘Your parents have been extracted.’ He winced immediately, hating how impersonal that sounded as soon as he said it. </p><p>It got Malfoy’s attention though. His gaze snapped to Harry. ‘What do you know?’ </p><p>Harry bit at his bottom lip. ‘They were <i>Portkey</i>-ed out ... They’ve been taken to a safe house in southern France.’ </p><p>Malfoy turned his face away from Harry and breathed a sigh of relief. </p><p>‘The thing is …' Harry continued, hesitantly. ‘They’d refused to go.’ </p><p>Malfoy looked at him intensely, all grey eyes boring into him, but said nothing. </p><p>‘They refused to leave you, so they had to be taken … forcefully. And now they’re being guarded by French Aurors … in France …' </p><p>Miserably, Harry braced himself for Malfoy to be angry, to say he should never have trusted Harry. It’d been stupid of him to get excited about having a real, proper excuse to talk to Malfoy. Of course it wouldn’t go well. He looked down at his hands, gripping his own thighs. He’d fucked this all up. Malfoy had depended on him … and now Malfoy was just going to go back to hating him.  </p><p>‘I see,’ was what he said, instead. </p><p>Harry looked at him in surprise. ‘Are you … upset?’ </p><p>Malfoy sucked in his bottom lip, and when he released it, it shined a little with saliva. ‘No. All I want is for them to survive, to live through this.’ </p><p>Harry watched Malfoy, with legs swinging up on that desk, and a thoughtful expression on his face. If only Ron and Hermione could see him like this, then they’d know what Harry knew, that Malfoy was not <i>bad</i>. </p><p>‘Is there anything else?’ Malfoy asked, his tone had lost its edge. </p><p>Harry shook his head. ‘That’s all I know.’ His mind searched for something else to say, something to let Malfoy know that he really did want to be friends …  </p><p>Malfoy nodded. ‘Thank you, for telling me. I hadn’t heard from my mother in days, I was beginning to worry. This is … a relief.’ </p><p>Harry nodded, sucking in a breath. ‘I’m glad …' </p><p>Malfoy hopped off the desk and made for the door. ‘See you around, Potter.’ </p><p>Before Harry could answer, could say <i>something</i>, he was gone. </p><p>He was fifteen minutes late to Charms. Hermione shot him a questioning look, he returned it with a shrug of his shoulders and slipped into the empty seat beside Neville.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~</p>
</center>A few days later, Dumbledore summoned Harry on a mission to find a Horcrux. On the way, he told Harry that he was dying, that he’d been dying for a while now. It was from the ring on his hand.<p>Harry didn’t want to hear it, couldn’t believe it, and tried to insist that surely something could be done. Dumbledore calmly told him about the Unbreakable Vow between Professor Snape and Narcissa Malfoy. </p><p>When they returned, with the locket, and Dumbledore weakened and sick, Dumbledore inexplicably commanded Harry to cast <i>Expelliarmus</i> on him. </p><p>Moments later, Snape was there to kill Dumbledore. </p><p>The next coming days were full of profound grief, indescribable loss, and the foreboding idea that if Dumbledore could die, couldn’t any of them? Who else would Harry have to lose in this fight against Voldemort? Ron? Hermione? Malfoy? Ginny? It was enough to paralyse someone. He was going to have to do this alone, to protect everyone important to him—to keep them safe. </p><p>It was the morning of the funeral. The four houses were marched in columns down to the grounds. His mentor—his friend—was dead. Just thinking anything about Dumbledore made tears well up in his eyes.  </p><p>Draco Malfoy had been commanded to kill Dumbledore. By knowing this, by telling Dumbledore, it was supposed to have prevented it. It wasn’t right. It wasn’t fair. </p><p>They sat out in chairs by the lake; Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron together. It was a beautiful summer’s day: the sun was shining bright amidst fluffy clouds and blue sky, it shone over the vibrant green grass, and sparkling, still lake. The merpeople sang. Someone Harry didn’t know spoke a eulogy. Dumbledore’s body was entombed, and arrows were fired into the air.  </p><p>Then, Harry broke up with Ginny, told her there were things he was going to have to do alone now. </p><p>‘I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn’t be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that’s why I like you so much,’ said Ginny. </p><p>He didn’t think that was fair. He didn’t derive any happiness out of hunting Voldemort. It just felt like … duty. Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore’s tomb, and the lot of them. He set off to walk around the lake. To clear his head. </p><p>After a few long moments, when the chatter from the funeral became a distant buzz, replaced by the soothing sounds of the lake lapping against the shore, and Harry felt he could <i>breathe</i> again, he heard a voice, out of breath, calling, ‘Harry!’ </p><p>He whirled, and to his shock, was faced with a jogging Draco Malfoy. ‘Did you just call me--’ </p><p>‘Never mind that,’ Malfoy said, waving a hand dismissively. He walked the last few paces so that they were standing close, eye to eye. ‘I want you to know that I didn’t kill him.’ </p><p>Harry looked at him now, really looked. There was a desperation there, an anxiety in Malfoy’s demeanor. All rigid posture and wide, wild eyes. The white-blond strands of his hair fluttered in the soft breeze. ‘I know you didn’t kill Dumbledore. I was there. When it happened.’ He blinked at Malfoy. ‘You thought I would think you killed him?’ </p><p>Malfoy sucked in a breath. ‘I--Well, since I was the one that was supposed to do it--I wanted you to be sure. That it wasn’t me. Though … me just telling you, might not have been much to go on anyway. Though you say you were there, so, I guess I don’t have to prove it …' </p><p>Malfoy was babbling. Harry could hardly believe it. Was he really so nervous?  </p><p>‘It’s fine, I know,’ Harry said. </p><p>‘I’m … I’m sorry. I know he was important to you.’ </p><p>Harry smiled a little, despite himself, despite the circumstances. ‘Thank you,’ he said softly. </p><p>‘I suppose you’ll be off on some death-defying hero’s mission shortly.’ Malfoy said, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth.  </p><p>Harry tried not to look at Malfoy’s mouth. ‘Ah … yes, I suppose you could say that.’ It struck him suddenly that he didn’t know what Malfoy would do. ‘Um, where will you be?’ </p><p>Malfoy’s gaze dropped down to his own feet, as he shrugged. ‘Well, I’ve made myself an enemy of the Dark Lord. I’m told I can either go be with my parents in France, or, I can stay here. I decided to stay here. At Hogwarts.’ </p><p>Harry felt a rush of … pride? ‘That’s really quite brave of you, Malfoy ... are you sure you shouldn’t be in Gryffindor?’ he teased. </p><p>Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. ‘Certainly not.’ </p><p>Then he smiled, slowly, so that it lit up his face. And that just made Harry smile too. Then they were just goofily smiling at each other, albeit shyly, tentatively. </p><p>Malfoy broke the silence first, his expression sobering. ‘Since I won’t be going back on the train, I’d like to … to say goodbye now.’ </p><p>Harry’s heart started to pick up speed. ‘Okay.’ </p><p>Malfoy took a step closer. Harry sucked in a breath. </p><p>‘Harry!’ came Hermione’s voice from the distance.  </p><p>Malfoy looked over his shoulder at Harry’s approaching friends, then back at Harry. ‘I just wanted to remind you,’ he said hurriedly, ‘not to die.’ </p><p>Harry smiled. ‘I’ll try not to.’  </p><p>‘I mean it. Don’t die,’ he said with a stern look, staring straight into Harry’s eyes. Then Malfoy leaned forward, and placed a quick kiss on Harry’s cheek. The kiss made a soft smacking noise, and felt tingly, so much so that it lingered afterwards on his cheek. And Harry felt goosebumps and confusion and excitement all at once. </p><p>‘For luck,’ Draco murmured, blushing furiously, before swinging around and hurrying back to the funeral, passing Harry’s bewildered friends, with hands stuffed deep in his pockets and head tilted down.</p>
