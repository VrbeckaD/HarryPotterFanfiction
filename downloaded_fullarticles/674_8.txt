    <p>He can feel it now, like he hadn't before. Like a churning, dark mass of all the anger and pain he had ever felt forced into one place.</p><p>The thought occurred to him, once he found himself able to stand on human legs again, to let it take over for good. Let it wipe him away in the black power of it. Credence could take the whole city down before the witches came for him. Burn it down around him and let it all end. </p><p>But it seems so pointless now.</p><p>It simmers though, somewhere in him. A hissing burn like the singe of a brand on his palm. But the rest of Credence is numb as he steps into the only home he ever knew. </p><p>It's spotless. The rafters unbroken. The bodies...gone. Chastity gone. His ma’....gone.</p><p>He thinks briefly about Modesty, about finding her. Running with her to get away from the world. But he saw her face before she ran crying from the wrecked house, when all he knew was waking up to death and crying and shattered wood around him. He now knows the look of horror on her face wasn't at her own power, but at his. At him.</p><p>He won't go find her. Little girls need to be protected from monsters.</p><p>They're all gone. Even the hope he had with the wizards. The promise of belonging torn away cruelly by Graves, and then snuffed for good by all the wizards and their burning wands. </p><p>The darkness roils at the memory, but Credence can’t blame them for it, not really. Though part of him still wants to. It wants to make them suffer as much as he did, wants them to feel the pain they carved into him.</p><p>He wants them to look at him like he isn’t a terror from their nightmares.</p><p>He doesn't feel the tears coming until the cracked sound of his own voice breaks the silence. Credence sinks to the floor, crawls to the corner where he can feel the walls pushing against his human flesh.</p><p>His monster flesh. Perhaps ma’ had been right all along. And she tried and failed to cast the thing from him. He knows she never loved him, and while he still feels the sharp anger and resentment, it’s tempered now with an understanding.</p><p>A hesitant step creaks on the wood floor, and Credence curls tighter in on himself, letting the sobs that wrack his body remind him that he at least looks human. He can have that, at least. The dark twists in answer to his fear, but does no more than that as soft footsteps slowly approach him.</p><p>"Hello, Credence."</p><p>It is a gentle voice, and Credence looks up, vision blurred by tears. It’s the british wizard from the subway, the one who had been with the good witch at the end. The one Graves had attacked over and over  while Credence could only run and cry in terror at what was happening until he let the dark take him over. </p><p>The man is crouched a small distance away, blue coat buttoned up against the chill, arms resting on his bent knees and head tilted as he watches Credence closely.</p><p>"Are you here to kill me?" Credence asks, voice a rough croak. "You probably should, before it gets out again."</p><p>“No,” the man’s head ducks down as he shakes it, as if he’s trying to shake the very idea off of him, “Of course not. I'm no good with violence anyway.” He looks back up, still again. “Do you remember me, Credence? My name is Newt. Newt Scamander."</p><p>"From the subway." </p><p>"That's right." Mr. Scamander’s lips twitch into an odd smile that's gone as soon as it's there, turning into a grimace. "Credence...I didn't...I am sorry. I didn't know the Auror's followed me. I never wanted you hurt. As far as anyone else knows, you're dead. I had a hunch otherwise, but I do think it's best if they keep thinking that."</p><p>His hands are more animated, moving in twitches and twists together, and he keeps his distance. Credence doesn't know if Mr. Scamander is lying or not, and at this point he doesn't care.</p><p>"You're frightened of me." Credence says firmly. He doesn't think he's ever heard such conviction in his own voice. Mr. Scamander only pauses, head tilting again as he eyes Credence.</p><p>"I'm not frightened of you." He says quietly. "But I am worried for you."</p><p>"You can't stand to come near me."</p><p>Mr. Scamander huffs, not quite a laugh or a sigh. "I've dealt with quite a few cornered, scared things in my life. I'm not going to just charge up on you and into your space. I'm not frightened, but I'm also not stupid."</p><p>"But you think I'm an animal." He doesn't know why he keeps talking, why he keeps pushing. He's exhausted and hurting and wants to curl up and let the cold take him, but he wants to prove some intangible point. Mr. Scamander only shrugs, mouth twisting in an odd smile like he's about to let Credence in on a private joke.</p><p>"All humans are animals, really. Very complicated, vicious beasts. But beasts all the same."</p><p>Ma’ used to say things like that, trembling in her holy rage and lip curled in disgust at it all. Mr. Scamander says it in his quiet voice like it isn't bad or good, but just is.</p><p>"What do you want?" Credence mutters, watching Mr. Scamander carefully while the dark rolls in him.</p><p>"I'm not just a wizard, you know." Mr. Scamander answers. "I just finished the manuscript for a book, you see. A guide on magical creatures from all over the world. Creatures that people are generally afraid of, but they're really just misunderstood because no one bothered to get to know them. And while I look forward to settling down a bit, I still find that there are some things I could use some assistance with as I continue my work.”</p><p>Mr. Scamander pauses then and watches Credence, who only stares back with wide eyes and trembling hands.</p><p>“I have a ship heading off in a few days.” Mr. Scamander goes on, softer and quieter now, blue eyes holding Credence's. “It’ll take me far away from here. You can come with me and I can help you, if you like. And I have a space where you can go if you feel it might get out again, so you won't hurt anyone. I meant what I said before, down in the tunnel. I knew a girl, just like you. She was frightened, alone, and her own magic was eating her away.”</p><p>The sincere worry in his eyes is searing, unwavering. Credence has to tears his own eyes away to stare at his hands clenching each other until the bones of his knuckles look as if they’ll break through his flesh.</p><p>“I couldn’t help her.” Mr. Scamander says, and not seeing the face is worse, because Credence hears the pain so clearly. “But I think I can help you.” </p><p>Credence swallows, his heart pounds, and a voice inside screams LIAR to his core. But Credence is weak, and he still can't care if Mr. Scamander is another liar witch. His voice is gentle and kind, and Credence is starving for it, though he hates himself for that hunger. He doesn’t think he can be saved, but Christ in heaven does he want someone to try.</p><p>“What do I need to do in exchange?” He whispers, and Mr. Scamander frowns.</p><p>“Nothing. Just help out. Taking notes, caring for my collection. I’ll be doing anything dangerous. You may have to deal with me though. People aren’t used to dealing with me, and I often find the feeling mutual. But I’m sure I can manage.”</p><p>Mr. Scamander hesitates, rises from his crouch to close the distance with two long steps, and leans down with his hand extended to Credence. “Do you want to come?”</p><p>Away from here. Away from this city where there is nothing but pain and rejection. Freedom was already offered to him, held over his head like a carrot on a stick, and he is sure Mr. Scamander is lying to him too. But it doesn't matter, not when the lie looks like a dream. Not when Mr. Scamander only offers and watches him with his light, warm eyes.</p><p>With a shaking hand, Credence slowly reaches up to take Scamander’s.</p>
