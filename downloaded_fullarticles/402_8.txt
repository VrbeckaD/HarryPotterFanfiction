She continued looking through her History of Magic book on his bed. She idly noticed that the Chudley Cannons orange walls clashing with the Gryffindor Blanket on the bed. 'Oh great all the wedding planning has corrupted even my mind' Hermione thought.</p><p>"You know he's somewhat right, Hermione. I mean really why do your parents have a marriage arranged? Let alone a marriage arranged with Blaise Zabini of all people. How do your families even know each other?" commented Harry from his position on the floor where he sat cleaning his broom.</p><p>"Mother says that Father and Mr. Zabini grew up next to each other. Apparently, Blaise and I played together as toddlers when we both lived in Whitby. And as for having an arranged marriage, you know that my parents are old school. And arranged marriages are common for Ancient and Noble Houses like the Zabini's. And both of us could say no, neither of our parents would force us to do this if we really didn't want to. And it's a good political move. Not only would the Zabini line be continued," Ron sputtered and gaped, "OR at least it would have the chance to. But it also protects me, as a muggle-born. Meaning that if something happened, the ministry cannot eject me from the wizarding world." At Harry's and Ron's looks, she huffed and continued, "I just mean, that Voldemort may have been defeated but his unmarked supporters are still out there trying to make life difficult. And this way they can't touch me without essentially attacking the Zabini's."</p><p>"But he's a slimy snake!" Ron interjected.</p><p>Hermione heaved a sigh and put down her book as she finished. "I'm marrying Blaise, I came to tell you guys because you are my best friends. But, if you cannot support my decision then I am sorry. But I'm still going through with it. My wedding will be in two weeks if you are coming then fine. But I hope that you will." She stood up and made her way to the door, "I hope to see you there, but I have to go, Mother and I are going for a dress fitting. Bye, you two."</p><p>Hermione left and made her way down the staircase of the Burrow. She poked her head into the living room and said goodbye to Molly. "Goodbye, dear. Have fun shopping with your mother. Will we see you at Diagon Alley in two weeks for school shopping?" Molly quizzed.</p><p>"No, I've already gotten my things and will actually be on a family vacation in two weeks." Hermione murmured.</p><p>"Oh well, that's too bad. Then you have a good last few weeks and we will see you on September First at King's Cross. You be careful on your vacation dear, there are still supporters of You-Know-Who out there looking for revenge." Molly said as she got up to give Hermione a hug.</p><p>"Thank you, Mrs. Weasley, I will keep that in mind. Give my best to Mr. Weasley. I will see you at King's Cross." Hermione returned the hug and heading to the kitchen and the floo. She was meeting her mother on the muggle side of The Leaky Cauldron. "The Leaky Cauldron!"</p>
