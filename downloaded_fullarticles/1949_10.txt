  <strong>Part I</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>So,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>he shall be</em>
</p><p>
  <em>condemned to death </em>
</p><p>
  <em>for providing assistance to the enemy.</em>
</p><p>A murmur ripples through the crowd, shocked that such a young boy</p><p>not even yet a man,</p><p>would be placed under such a heavy fate.</p><p>But some part of them,</p><p>all of them,</p><p>no matter how they want to think,</p><p>hates him</p><p>for killing their family,</p><p>friends,</p><p>world,</p><p>even though they all know</p><p>none of it</p><p>was his fault.</p><p><em>Wait.</em> The hero rises.</p><p>Firm,</p><p>and a fire blazing in his eyes.</p><p>
  <em>He did nothing wrong. He made mistakes, yes, but this is not what he deserves.</em>
</p><p>The young boy,</p><p>handcuffed,</p><p>gapes openly.</p><p>When the hero glances his way, seven years come rushing back.</p><p>Seven years of being forced,</p><p>tortured,</p><p>tormented.</p><p>Now the tables are turned.</p><p>And for some reason, all the hero’s eyes can grasp are the same boy,</p><p>who seemingly stands unchanged.</p><p>The first hatred in his eyes.sparks to life.</p><p><em> It’s not for you,</em> he spits-</p><p>it’s because what they’re doing is wrong, and no one, not even you, Malfoy, deserves that.</p><p>And the hero turns abruptly and strides away, images of emaciated bodies and sunken eyes</p><p>dancing in his head.</p><p>
  <strong>Part II</strong>
</p><p>And there stands the boy at the funeral,</p><p>the memory of one of the greatest.</p><p>
  <em>It’s my fault.</em>
</p><p>Silent tears soak his cheeks,</p><p>rain turns the ground to a sopping sea</p><p>the marble coffin swings shut with a decisive creak.</p><p>His mother once told him,</p><p>
  <em>Get used to death and you will be all the stronger for it.</em>
</p><p>But the whole world is weaker now for their loss.</p><p>Again and again the hero notices the intruder,</p><p>staring and staring like he shouldn’t be here.</p><p>He shouldn’t.</p><p>
  <em>It’s his fault.</em>
</p><p>The ground closes over the coffin, and their leader is gone,</p><p>unreachable,</p><p>untouchable forever.</p><p>The shadowy tattoo that taints his arm </p><p>seems to grin at the thought.</p><p>
  <em>I will have victory.</em>
