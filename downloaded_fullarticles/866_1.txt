    <p>It was one of those days. A day where Harry felt like he should have had a ton of work to do but for some reason, it was a slow day. He would have welcomed one of the bi-weekly alien invasions to break up the monotony and the insanity of it all. He kicked back on his desk and went through the paperwork that he had for the ten millionth time.</p><p>"Is it just me or is the key to madness constant and never ending repetition?"</p><p>Harry looked up and saw her standing in the office door. The blonde had a black head band clipped over the top of her head. She wore a nice female business suit that stretched over every single inch of her body. She was a complete stunner wearing her sheer stockings even though her skirt covered them fairly modestly.</p><p>"Yes, never ending repetition," Harry agreed. He finally put his paperwork away and smiled. She sauntered over towards him to give him a kiss. "How are you doing Gwen?"</p><p>"Pretty good," the blonde said in an excited voice. She thought about taking the chair next to him. She had a better idea which situated herself so she was pretty much sitting pretty off by the side of his desk. "And for the record, business is booming this month. So you're stuck in a rut because of it, aren't you?"</p><p>"Not necessarily stuck in a rut," Harry commented. Gwen raised her eyebrow in surprise and Harry amended. "I guess a better description would be that I'm a hamster running on a wheel."</p><p>"Well, welcome to the world of mundane business," Gwen said. She took a lollipop that was on a tin on his desk and slowly undid the wrapper. The blonde gave him one of those grins, popping the lollipop into her mouth. She slowly sucked on it. "But am I making things a little less mundane?"</p><p>Harry smiled. He wasn't going to say a word but he was pretty sure that Gwen was making things a little less mundane with her actions.</p><p>"I might have an idea," Gwen said. She amended herself quickly. Gwen Stacy was always one to give credit where credit was mostly due. "Actually, I don't have an idea. But Kara and Barbara on the other hand, they might have topped themselves with this brilliant scheme of theirs."</p><p>There was a moment where Harry looked at Gwen. She calmly removed the lollipop from her mouth and offered him a taste. While he took it, his eyes kept locked onto hers. His eyebrow raised when he continued to look at her.</p><p>"Should I be concerned about what those two collaborated on with each other?" Harry asked.</p><p>"I'm sure that it will be amazing," Gwen said. "They've been making all sorts of phone calls all day, you know. They wanted to surprise you. Consider it a bit of an early Christmas present. Even though it's a week off…we could really get something out for the holiday season."</p><p>"Hmmm," Harry muttered. "You know, where are those two anyway?"</p><p>"They're working on something downstairs," Gwen admitted. She figured that Harry's curiosity would be grabbed heavily.</p><p>"Oh, are they?" Harry asked.</p><p>"I'm sure that they'd like to see you," Gwen commented. She could see Harry rise to his feet. His height was deceptive.</p><p>"You know, you might be the smartest girl of your age," Harry told her. Gwen nodded, beaming at the praise. "But you are an absolutely terrible liar."</p><p>Gwen snorted. She was guilty as charged with that one.</p><p>"You were just as much involved in that as those two were…..or three if we count Donna?" Harry asked. "I know those two wouldn't have left her out of their masterful scheme."</p><p>"Yeah, and there might have been a few others who contributed to it," Gwen admitted. She figured that there was no use in lying to Harry. He always seemed to know when someone was lying to him. It made dealing with him a challenge and a half. "But, I suppose that all of us should discuss it with you. I think that you'll be very interested in the idea they've cooked up."</p><hr/><p>"I know, but I'm pretty sure that you'll be a good fit," Kara said. The blonde's hair clipped back and she wore a pair of eyeglasses. She wore a loose fitting red blouse and a black skirt that flowed down her legs. Her nice stockings and high heel shoes added to the assemble fairly nicely. "Yeah, I know…..I'm sure Harry will find out about it soon enough anyway."</p><p>"He just did."</p><p>Kara nearly jumped ten feet off of the ground. Barbara chuckled in amusement. The fact was she was just as startled by Harry arriving. She just did a better job of not showing it.</p><p>"When did you get here?" Kara asked him. Harry smiled at her. "Actually, you were standing there the entire time, weren't you?"</p><p>"Gwen tells me that you're up to something," Harry said. He grabbed Kara firmly by the waist and pulled her in.</p><p>Barbara gave her a "someone just got busted" look. Kara scowled at her and was about ready to say something. Harry beat her to the punch though.</p><p>"Both of you have been up to something."</p><p>Kara pumped her fist into the air. Harry backed her off towards the desk. He motioned for her to sit. He motioned for Barbara to sit.</p><p>"Hi, Harry," Donna said, popping her head around the corner. There were seconds where she got the look as well. "Oh, he knows, doesn't he?"</p><p>"Yes he does," Kara confirmed. She motioned for Donna to take a seat.</p><p>"Gwen's inability to lie, I swear," Barbara said. She dipped her head down and shook it.</p><p>"The three of you have been down here for three days working on something," Harry confirmed.</p><p>"I thought that you'd be busy…." Kara said. She trailed off. "What did you find out?"</p><p>"That you've been making a lot of calls," Harry continued. There was no use in denying that so all three girls nodded. Gwen popped out from behind the door.</p><p>"Well, we were going to give you this nice presentation when we figured out all of the odds and ends," Kara suggested. "Seriously we were, you've got to believe us."</p><p>Harry smiled at her. It was obvious that he was curious.</p><p>"It's something that will be a huge money maker for this company," Kara said. "And yes I know we shattered pretty much every record this company ever made last quarter and are in the process of doing so next time."</p><p>"The RAO Corporation has matched all of its goals and exceeded them," Gwen said. Given she was Harry's Chief Operating Officer, she should know. "But there's always a lot of room for growth."</p><p>"Always," Harry agreed. He was pretty much surprised that his hard to reach goals actually were reached. That proved something although he wasn't sure what it was. "We've got a really impressive money maker on our hands. This company can only rise from here. But what do you have that is going to break all records? Is there some new piece of technology that we can scrap together?"</p><p>"No, nothing that high tech," Barbara said. She smiled and wondered what his reaction would be. There was only one way to find out. "It's actually something relatively low tech. It's pretty cheap to produce and this might be the biggest return on investment that the RAO Corporation has ever seen. It will lead an entirely new life of its own."</p><p>Harry let Barbara babble herself into a stupor. That was just the best way to handle things with her. The redhead's cheeks grew flushed when she spoke.</p><p>Once she was done, Harry smirked at her. "Explain this to me."</p><p>Donna decided to be the one to jump on in. Being an Amazon warrior, she could be pretty hot tempered and rather blunt. "We're going to make a calendar."</p><p>Harry raised his eyebrow.</p><p>"You see, you have forged relationships with several women inside the super heroine community," Kara continued.</p><p>Gwen couldn't help but mutter underneath her breath. "That's putting things really mildly."</p><p>Barbara and Donna laughed. Kara didn't break her stride to her credit. Shaking her head after giving those two one more look.</p><p>"And there are a lot of people who owe you favors, and I figured that this would be good for everyone," Kara commented. "Super powered people have had a rough year, and yes, Gwen, I know that's putting it mildly, there's no need to say anything."</p><p>Gwen lifted her hands slowly up as if to tell Kara to chill things out. Kara didn't seem like the type to chill.</p><p>"But, our public image isn't the best if you're a cape and even if you're a cape that's not really a cape," Kara said. "And I think that this calendar will be a good thing because…..well I'll be perfectly honest, if people see your name and face on it, it will sell like hot cakes."</p><p>Harry prided himself with being rather quick on the draw.</p><p>"You know, this calendar….is it going to be suitable for all ages?" Harry asked her.</p><p>"Actually, I think that we can have our cake and eat it too," Barbara chimed in. Harry turned towards her. "We market ourselves through Justice Communications and we can get a safer calendar out there for the all ages. But the all ages ones, while it might do well, won't be anything compared to the real calendar."</p><p>"The perverted is a market that is vast and should be exploited at any time," Gwen recited.</p><p>Harry couldn't help but make a comment. "Is that what all that market research is telling us?"</p><p>"Yes," Gwen agreed with him. "So, how about it? Are you in all the way or are you…."</p><p>"Gwen, you know that I'm in all of the way," Harry told her. Gwen blinked and nodded. She folded her arms over her chest and smiled.</p><p>"Good, if you're in, than I'm in," Gwen said.</p><p>"And I take it that you've been working on this project for a long time."</p><p>Kara nodded eagerly. "Getting all of our ducks in a row is a hard one. Because we have to work around the schedules of a lot of people. You know how busy the various superhero teams get. And even when we work together, that's against threats that put the world in peril. Things have slowed down a lot recently. There might never be another chance to get something like this in order."</p><p>Kara placed her hands on the side of Harry's neck.</p><p>"But we can't do this project without you," Kara said. "This is going to be a chance to see the infamous…..what's your codename this week anyway?"</p><p>"It really doesn't matter since I pulled a Tony Stark and am not even bothering with a secret identity," Harry said. Kara nodded in agreement. "But I think that the name Harry Potter holds a lot of clout, doesn't it?"</p><p>"Oh yes, it holds a lot of backing, in fact it might be more valuable than anyone in a mask is," Kara agreed. "And let's face it, with all of these girls, people will be drooling for a lot of skin. And if you're there…..well that could fuel many fantasies."</p><p>Harry had to agree. He knew Kara since he was twelve. She flew literally through his bedroom window. Scared the shit out of his relatives she did. His wife did have a way of making something like this sound extremely appealing.</p><p>Not that this scenario didn't sound appealing on its own. It did sound extremely appealing. It made Harry sit up and smile in interest.</p><p>"And I take it that you have some of the girls in mind," Harry said.</p><p>"Donna, Barbara, and I have been down here working on the list," Kara said. "We want to go with certain themes depending on the month and well….everything is in that folder. I'm sure that you can read it at your leisure."</p><p>Kara slapped the file folder down on the desk for Harry to read. He took a moment to read through it. The girls watched for Harry's reaction. He chuckled at a couple of notes and muttered "interesting." They were not sure whether that was a good type of interesting or a bad type of interesting.</p><p>"So?" Kara asked.</p><p>"I don't really see any problems with this, really," Harry said. The girls looked relieved because they thought for a brief moment that Harry was going to be mad. "It would put some people in some scenarios that you didn't think that they would be in."</p><p>"Well that's the idea, got to think outside the box," Kara said. She laughed in amusement. "But you can't deny that the expected is not bad either."</p><p>"Hey, if it's cliché, it just means that it's been perfected," Gwen commented wisely. There was no one who was going to deny that. "So, when do we start?"</p><p>Harry looked thoughtful and nodded.</p><p>"No time like the present, I think. As soon as everyone is ready."</p><p>"Great, the girls for January are on their way here and should be here within the hour," Kara said. Harry looked at her.</p><p>"And what prey tell would you have done if I had said this wasn't a good idea?"</p><p>Kara gave him a sheepish grin. "Well, I would have found a way to convince you."</p><p>"Then I regret agreeing off hand," Harry said. That caused everyone to laugh.</p><hr/><p>
