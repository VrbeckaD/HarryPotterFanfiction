    <p>He'll learn the truth later, but his grandmother took him to Muggle doctors, growing up. She had no more idea than her grandson that his condition was no neurological malfunction. Most kids manifest magic by blowing something up or summoning a toy, but Mike has never been average.</p>
<p>So he sees a pediatrician, and he sees a psychiatrist, and he sees a neurologist, and sooner or later he walks away with a diagnosis, a label slapped on his brain. Synesthete, it says, and nobody ever talks about the fact that he only sees the colors some places, with some people.</p>

</center>Mike jumps up when the doorbell rings. "I'll get it, Gram!" he calls even as he's halfway out of the kitchen. He pulls the door open as far as the chain allows and smiles politely to the stranger on the other side. "Good afternoon."<p>The woman smiles at him. "Good afternoon. Are you Michael Ross?"</p>
<p>He nods. "Can I help you?"</p>
<p>The woman's smile widens. "My name is Minerva McGonagall, Mr Ross. I'm the headmistress of a special school. Are your parents home? I'd like to talk to them about the school."</p>
<p>Mike frowns. "I don't have parents anymore, but Gram's here. Let me go get her." He waits for the woman's nod before shutting the door carefully and running back into the kitchen to explain the situation his grandmother. She asks him to get tea together while she lets the professor in.</p>
<p>Their quiet conversation stops when he brings in the tea tray, so he leans in close to his grandmother. "I can see her colors, too," Mike says quietly, but the professor's head turns towards them, and he looks back down at the tea service.</p>
<p>"He has synesthesia," she explains to their visitor, and the women share a long glance before Gram continues. "It means he sometimes sees tracks of color as someone talks or moves."</p>
<p>The professor nods slowly. "Hogwarts is well equipped to accommodate any unusual needs our students have. I will need to discuss specifics with you."</p>
<p>Gram looks relieved when the oven timer goes off. "Let me just get that. Why don't you show him the letter?" The paper is thick, and he unfolds it carefully.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
<p></p><center><p><b>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry<br/>Headmistress: Minerva McGonagall</b><br/>(Order of Merlin, First Class)</p></center>Dear Mr Ross,<p>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.</p>
<p>Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>Filius Flitwick<br/>Deputy Headmaster</p></blockquote>"Witchcraft and wizardry?" Mike repeats, incredulous, and the headmistress nods with a small smile playing on her lips.<p>"Magic, Mr Ross. You're a wizard, and this school can help you learn how to control your magic."</p>
<p>"Michael," Gram calls from the kitchen, and Mike excuses himself to find his grandmother wrapping a warm chocolate cake, a small frown evident on her face. "Would you deliver this while I speak with the professor, please?"</p>
<p>Mike takes the cake next door to Mrs Evans and stays just for a few minutes to play with Trevor, and when he returns, his grandmother looks just a little bit happier.</p>
<p>"Mr. Ross," the professor says, then hesitates. "There's a strong chance that part of your synesthesia is actually a form of magic. It's possible you have the rare ability to see magic. I'd like to demonstrate a few spells to find out for sure."</p>
<p>"But I can see Gram's colors, and sometimes I see Mr. Vente's colors." Mike looks down at the professor's curious glance. "He works at the library."</p>
<p>The professor hesitates. "That is unusual, but most Muggles have a small amount of magic, even if they can't use it. You go to the library quite a bit, your grandmother says?" She smiles when Mike nods. "You would be more sensitized to the trace magic in those Muggles you spend the most time with, if my theory is correct."</p>
<p>"Okay," he agrees. "So you do your spells, and if I can see them, I'm not a synesthete?"</p>
<p>She smiles at him and pulls out a thin stick. "That's the general idea. Wingardium Leviosa!"</p>
<p>Mike gasps loudly. "It's pink!" At the encouraging look from the professor, he elaborates. "It's a bright pink, um, smoky line. From the table up to the bottom of the vase, like it's holding it there."</p>
<p>The vase settles gently back on the mantle. "In time, you'll learn how to identify spells by their colors. It's a rare gift, Mr. Ross, but I do know one other mage who might be willing to help you learn. I'll give you time to settle in at school and think about it before we owl her. However, thinking about the school, I think it's best if you visit it for a while in the summer, before classes start. There's a lot of latent magic; you'll need the time to get used to seeing it before we ask you to concentrate on classes."</p>

</center>"Wow wow wow wow WOW!"<p>Professor McGonagall smiles indulgently down at Mike as he picks up the Frisbee and turns it over, studying it from every angle. "That's called a Portkey."</p>
<p>"Wow," he repeats, shifting his grip before glancing up at her. "Since the spell's gone, can I throw it?"</p>
<p>The smile widens. "You may keep it, if you'd like, but don't leave it outside. Unicorns will eat anything."</p>
<p>He laughs and tosses the Frisbee, chasing after it down the path and waiting for the professor to catch up to him. "What's this?"</p>
<p>She glances down at the object in his hand. "A rock?"</p>
<p>"It has a spell on it. Why is there a spell on a rock?"</p>
<p>McGonagall frowns and takes the rock from him, studying it. "It could be a shrinking charm or a transfiguration. We can find out in the castle, if you'd like."</p>
<p>"Castle!" Mike tosses his Frisbee again and chases it further down the path, crouching down to study the plants as he waits for the professor again. "I don't recognize some of these plants."</p>
<p>"Many magical plants only grow in the presence of magic; the school has several successful greenhouses because of the amount of magic present on the grounds."</p>
<p>"Are we on the grounds then?" Mike gasps as they round a bend in the path. "Okay, never mind, I think we must be."</p>
<p>"Afternoon, Headmistress."</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, Hagrid."</p>
<p>Mike stares up at the huge man. "Are you a giant? Are giants real? Are you a real giant?"</p>
<p>"Half-giant," Hagrid replies, smiling down at him. "Are you a new student?"</p>
<p>"Yep! I'm Mike. I'm not a giant. I guess you know that, though."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall laughs and rests a hands on his shoulder. "It is rather obvious, Michael. This is Professor Hagrid. He teaches Care of Magical Creatures and looks after the grounds for us."</p>
<p>"Cool!" Mike briefly considers offering his hand for a high five, but then he notices the half-giant's hands are easily the size of his head. "I guess I'll see you in class, Professor Hagrid!"</p>
<p>"Not for a couple of years," McGonagall corrects. "His class is only open to third-years and above."</p>
<p>"Then I'll see you in two years!" He grins up at the huge man, who returns the expression.</p>
<p>"That's my hut," he says, pointing down the hill. "Feel free to visit before then. Now, I'd best be off; Rosmerta's asked me to see to a patch of bundimuns outside the Three Broomsticks."</p>
<p>"What are bundimuns?" Mike asks, and Hagrid laughs and pats him thunderously on the head before leaving them. "What are they?" he directs to the headmistress instead.</p>
<p>"I'll let you find that out on your own," she answers, handing him a small piece of parchment that reads Summer Library Pass: Michael Ross.</p>
<p>He takes off down the path again as she starts walking. "Are there other students here in the summer? Do you ever have classes in the summer? How many students come to Hogwarts? Why is it named that, anyway? Has anyone ever suggested changing the name?" The barrage of questions continues, met only with the same indulgent smile until he suddenly cuts himself off in the middle of Why is the school in a castle?</p>
<p>"Wow wow wow wow WOW!"</p>
<p>"Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Mr Ross," the headmistress says mildly as she pushes the castle door shut behind them.</p>
<p>He thinks she keeps talking, but he's caught up in the wonderful colors of it all and can't spare any of his attention for her. There are pink streams from ceilings to floating chandeliers, fluffy turqouise layers wrapped around banisters, blue lines sliding over paintings one by one, and threads of green woven over every wall. Mike turns in a slow circle to take everything in, fully aware that his mouth is hanging open. He heads to the nearest wall and stares at the pattern of green, surprised to find that even these woven threads are moving. Different shades of green writhe around each other, trace the spaces between stones, and pass under the numerous picture frames.</p>
<p>Mike spins back towards the headmistress when he realizes he's been staring at what must be a blank spot on a stone wall for several minutes. "Um. Wow."</p>
<p>McGonagall smiles at him. "While that is a usual reaction, most students aren't gazing at the walls when they say it."</p>
<p>"There are so many spells on the walls, though!" he explains. "They're all different, but they're all related. What do they do?"</p>
<p>"Most of our wards are protective. They prevent damage to the castle as well as to its inhabitants. Professor Flitwick knows quite a bit about the wards; I'm sure he'd be happy to explain them to you."</p>
<p>"Who's Professor Flitwick?"</p>
<p>A small sigh to his left surprises Mike, and he turns to see a very small man standing in the room.</p>
<p>"Oh! Hello! I guess you're Professor Flitwick?"</p>
<p>The man nods sharply. "I teach Charms. My niece is also a mage, so I'm to be your guide and tutor this summer. Depending on the results of our work together, she may join us later in the year."</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you!" Mike bites back his impulse to say that he'd love see Flitwick standing next to Hagrid and instead just flashes a grin at the short man. "Is the mage-sight common?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. She's the only other true mage we're aware of, besides a man older than I am who lives in China. I do know some wizards with talents similar to magery, but it's not the same."</p>
<p>"The castle is so colorful," Mike says, cringing internally at the abrupt subject change. "Or, um, I guess the castle itself isn't, but the magic in it is. There's so much magic! How can you get anything done around here with all the magic?"</p>
<p>Flitwick smiles. "Teaching you to do exactly that is the purpose of this visit, is it not?"</p>

  </p>
</center>Diagon Alley is a hotbed of magical activity, even worse than Hogwarts. Mike's headache is already making itself known when Professor Flitwick pushes open the door to a small, dingy looking shop. <i>Ollivander's Wand Shop</i> is scrawled on the sign over the door, and Mike tries to brace himself as he steps through the heavy green wards and into the shop.<p>None of the wands are putting out colors, though, and Mike sighs in relief when the only spells he sees are what must be an alarm, trailing from the door to a point somewhere in the back of the store, and a puff of silver smoke rising from the opposite corner of the store.</p>
<p>"Filius," an old man says, sliding into view onto a ladder. Mike's a little bit surprised not to see any traces of magic propelling the ladder across its tracks, but he's distracted from that thought as the man dismounts and stares down at the professor. "I told you last year: I won't deal without their parents present."</p>
<p>Flitwick nods once. "This is Mike Ross. He lives with his grandmother, who is unable to accompany him to Diagon Alley. I have a letter of permission, if--"</p>
<p>The man snatches the stationary out of Flitwick's hand and flicks his eyes over it rapidly. "Michael James Ross," he says slowly, lifting his gaze to Mike's. "Very well. Try this one."</p>
<p>Mike takes the offered wand, but it immediately feels wrong, somehow. He sets it gently on the counter in front of him.</p>
<p>"Give it a wave, Mr Ross."</p>
<p>He shakes his head. "It's not right. I can't use that."</p>
<p>A slow smile spreads across the man's face. "A mere child, telling the most famous wandmaker in all of Britain that he's wrong about a wand."</p>
<p>Mike shrugs. "Are you Mr Ollivander? And I didn't say you're wrong. I just said that wand won't work with me." He eyes the old man, who nods. "What's in the wand?"</p>
<p>Ollivander taps a finger on the side of his nose. "Phoenix feather core. Never works for mages. Keep that in mind if you're ever in the market for an ostentatious familiar; phoenixes won't like you. Perhaps unicorn hair is more your style." He pulls a box from behind him without looking and thrusts it at Mike.</p>
<p>The wand doesn't feel immediately wrong, and Mike waves it cautiously. An ugly brown stream floods from the tip, exploding two vases. Flitwick squeaks and waves his own wand, repairing the vases immediately. "Garrick!"</p>
<p>Ollivander waves a dismissing hand at the professor. "Interesting. Very interesting. No mind, perhaps a different unicorn."</p>
<p>"Does that make a difference?"</p>
<p>The wandmaker frowns down at Mike. "Quite a large difference. Even the same unicorn's hair, plucked at a different time in his life, can perform very differently. This unicorn is known for donating hairs destined for those with rare talents, but that doesn't mean everyone with those talents is matched with one of his wands. Perhaps a new donor?"</p>
<p>Mike waves the wand, and the same two vases explode. Flitwick squeaks and repairs them again, and Mike ducks his head as he replaces the wand in its box. Ollivander hands wand after wand to Mike, Mike explodes the same vases over and over, and Flitwick eventually stops squeaking with his hasty repairs.</p>
<p>Ollivander stops eventually, staring down at Mike. "It seems you are not intended for the hair of any unicorn."</p>
<p>"Sorry?" Mike offers hesitantly.</p>
<p>"No matter." The old man holds a hand up, and Mike is shocked to see a wand zoom into it without any sign of magic. The wand waves, sending the towering pile of rejected wands back onto their shelves, and Mike frowns when that spell is a light blue color. "Perhaps dragon heartstring won't be a complete disaster."</p>
<p>"Disaster?" Mike's frown deepens. "Um...."</p>
<p>Ollivander's dismissive wave does not reassure him in the slightest. "We'll start with--" The man glares at a wand on the counter. "No." The wand disappears with a faint popping sound, and Ollivander summons a small pile of new wands. "Try these first."</p>
<p>None of the new wands explode anything, but they are all extremely sluggish. Mike can only force magic out of them with great effort. Ollivander frowns as he reshelves their boxes, and the earlier wand pops back onto the desk.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Mike stares as the wand pops away again, leaving behind only a faint puff of silver smoke. "Mr Ollivander?"</p>
<p>"There's a stream deep under the ground, back there." A gnarled finger points vaguely over his shoulder, and Mike glances back to see the same smoke he'd noticed when they first came in. "Most of the hazels don't react to it until they've chosen their wizard, but that wand has always been excitable. Never mind it. Perhaps an older dragon core."</p>
<p>"Is it normal for wands to move around on their own, without magic?"</p>
<p>Ollivander stares at him silently for a long moment before repeating, "That wand has always been excitable."</p>
<p>"But earlier, yours--"</p>
<p>"Hornbeam. That wood mates strongly with its wizard, and I have had my wand for a very long time. It is not unheard of for it to return to my hand without a spell. It's a different kind of magic." The man studies Mike's face again. "I should like very much to discuss this with you after you complete your Hogwarts education. Until then, could we return to the business of finding you a wand?"</p>
<p>Mike ducks his head again. "Yes, sir. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Another pile of reluctant dragon heartstring wands grows steadily, and the excitable wand continues to pop onto the counter, only to disappear again at Ollivander's quick refusal of it. At the next pause in wand waving, Mike brings it up again.</p>
<p>"That wand, sir, the excitable one? Why do you keep sending it away?"</p>
<p>The old man huffs loudly. "It has a substandard core. I only make and sell wands of the highest quality; the older wands are not for sale until every other wand in the shop has rejected the wizard."</p>
<p>"Seems like we're well on our way to that goal," Mike mutters, glancing towards Flitwick, napping in a chair by the door.</p>
<p>"We have not yet reached it."</p>
<p>The wand pops back onto the counter, and Mike's hand darts out before Ollivander can send it away again. His fingers wrap around the wood, and he smiles at the feeling of comfort that spreads through him. "It likes me."</p>
<p>"Obviously." Ollivander huffs again. "Since you've picked it up, you'd better give it a wave, or it'll just follow you out the door once you find a proper wand."</p>
<p>Mike grins and waves it towards the sleeping professor. Blue and silver sparks shoot towards the diminutive man, exploding loudly near his head. Flitwick startles awake, drawing his own wand with surprising speed and looking around in a panic before his eyes settle on Mike.</p>
<p>"It likes me," Mike explains hastily. "And, um, I guess it thought you shouldn't be asleep."</p>
<p>Flitwick seems torn between an amused smile and a disapproving frown. "You've found your wand, then?"</p>
<p>Ollivander glares at both of them before sending the pile of dragon heartstring wands back onto the shelves. "So it would seem, reluctant though I am to sell it."</p>
<p>"One of your father's, then?" Flitwick's expression is definitely one of amusement now.</p>
<p>"Hazel and diricawl feather, ten inches, rather springier than you might expect. Stay in that wand's good graces, boy; I don't want it appearing back in my shop because you've upset it."</p>
<p>Mike suppresses his giggle and nods as solemnly as he can manage.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Gram said I could get an owl if I want one. I saw one bringing you a letter last week; can I train my owl to do that if I get one?"</p>
<p>Flitwick smiles at him. "All the owls at Eeylops are already trained to carry mail. The school has several owls, but many students still prefer to have their own."</p>
<p>"Can we get my owl now?"</p>
<p>The professor shifts his bag to his other shoulder and nods. "We've gotten everything else. You'll have to get a small owl, though."</p>
<p>"But what if I need to send a big package to Gram?"</p>
<p>"Small mail owls can carry more than you think, but you can still use one of the school owls."</p>
<p>Mike looks unconvinced. "I wouldn't want my owl to think that I didn't like it if I used a bigger owl. Can they work together to carry something? Or I guess I could send my owl with a letter and a school owl with a package."</p>
<p>"I'm sure that would work." Flitwick pats him on the shoulder and points down the street. "Eeylops Owl Emporium."</p>
<p>"Why a small owl?" Mike asks as he trots towards the indicated store.</p>
<p>Flitwick coughs, or maybe it's a stifled laugh. "Well, owls fly. They don't particularly enjoy their cages being levitated down the street. And, well, we're both too short for a very large cage, especially with all these other bags."</p>
<p>Mike definitely laughs as he pushes open the shop door, but it's cut short when a small owl swoops down and lands on his outstretched forearm. "Um, hi," he says to the bird, freezing in place with the door still held open. "Can I, I mean, are you going to poop on me if I move?"</p>
<p>The owl stares at Mike and hops sideways along his arm, closer to his elbow.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll take that as a no. And I guess if you do, Professor Flitwick might be nice enough to clean up the mess." He uses his other hand to hold the door open for the professor as he slowly pulls his arm back towards his side, carefully keeping the owl level. "Do you belong to somebody?"</p>
<p>The owl tucks its head under a wing and doesn't answer. Flitwick replies for it, clearly suppressing amusement in his voice. "The tag on his foot means that he's for sale. And in your price range."</p>
<p>Mike examines the tag. "How do you know it's a boy?"</p>
<p>The owl's head pops back out with an indignant hoot.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry!" Mike exclaims quickly. "I don't know how to check owl sex! It's not something that's ever come up in my reading! Now, if you were a lizard..." He trails off at the hard stare the bird is giving him. "Not that I want a lizard. I am much happier with an owl. You are way cooler than a lizard."</p>
<p>The owl shakes his feathers, looking satisfied.</p>
<p>"Did you just choose me? Professor, did he just choose me? Is this my owl? Is he going to follow me home and poop on my head if I don't buy him?"</p>
<p>Flitwick lets out an obvious snort of laughter. "I don't believe he would do that, but he does seem rather attached to you."</p>
<p>"Okay. Owl ... what's your name?" The owl hoots, and Mike frowns. "I don't actually speak owl, but that kinda sounded like Ook to me. Is your name Ook?" The owl hops closer to Mike's elbow once more, and he smiles. "Hi, Ook. Listen, if I had to send Gram a big package that you couldn't carry, would you get mad if I let a school owl take it for me?"</p>
<p>Ook pecks his arm, hard.</p>
<p>"What if a school owl took the package, but you carried a letter? Because letters are more important. Without letters, you don't know anything about the package, and Gram doesn't open mail if she doesn't know who it's from. The school owl and its package would be useless without you and your letter."</p>
<p>The owl stares at him for a long moment before tucking his head back under his wing.</p>
<p>"I think I have an owl, Professor."</p>

  </p>
</center>"I'd like to bring the rest of the staff in," Flitwick says unexpectedly when Mike's down to only two more visits to the castle before terms starts. "You've gotten much better at focusing on your own magic instead of the wards, but when your classmates are here, they'll each be casting spells at the same time as you. If the staff can simulate that environment...."<p>Mike frowns. "I thought we were trying to keep this a secret."</p>
<p>"Your professors are all very intelligent. They will learn quickly that something is different about your talents. Introducing it early at least gives them time to adjust to the knowledge before--"</p>
<p>"Filius."</p>
<p>They both turn towards the door, where Professor McGonagall stands, frowning.</p>
<p>"Yes, Minerva?"</p>
<p>"The rest of staff is unaware of Michael's repeated visits; we will not be telling them any of his secrets. However, I will be glad to cast several spells to give Mr Ross a taste of what classes will be like."</p>

  </p>
</center>Mike sits on the desk beside Professor Flitwick and smiles at the man. "Thank you for working with me all summer," he says quietly.<p>"Believe me, it was not a hardship. You have quite a bit of skill and the determination to back it up. I look forward to having you in my classes next week."</p>
<p>He grins. "Me too, Professor. Are we going to pretend we don't know each other?"</p>
<p>Flitwick frowns for a moment. "It might be easier to say that I went on your home visit. We won't mention that you were here, but I do a few Muggleborn visits each year."</p>
<p>"Okay." Mike's grin broadens. "I can't wait to see Hogwarts at night. That's going to be so cool. And the Sorting!"</p>
<p>"A part of me hopes you'll be in Ravenclaw - I'm Head of that House - but I hope you know I'll be available for any questions or additional tutoring you might need regardless of your Sorting."</p>
<p>"Yep!" Mike hesitates, then reaches out and hugs the short man gently. "Thank you, Professor."</p>
<p>Flitwick startles, but he returns the hug quickly. "You're quite welcome, Mike."</p>
