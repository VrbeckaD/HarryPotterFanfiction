    <p align="justify">This just wasn't fair. Life wasn't fair. This Quarter Quell was supposed to consist of previous Victors. There wasn't supposed to be a Reaping. But District 12 didn't have a female Victor. It barely had a male one. There was just Haymitch. A useless drunk. Who was also tasked with mentoring the unlucky tributes that were chosen to enter this year's Games.</p>
<p align="justify">District 12 - one of the poorest in the country - was always at a disadvantage anyways. There was neither money nor time to train and prepare for potentially joining the Hunger Games. While District 1 and 2 almost always had Careers volunteering. Vicious and deadly.</p>
<p align="justify">But this year there would be no volunteers. Not even District 1 and 2 winners wanted to join the Games <em> again </em>. Beating the odds once was more than enough, even for them.</p>
<p align="justify">But then there was District 12. Just one male winner. So there had to be a Reaping for the general population. Someone had to be chosen at random. Someone who was going to face absolutely certain death. In their kindness the Capitol had decided to reap the male tribute from the usual crowd as well, so Haymitch could be available as a mentor. Not that that was going to help anyone much.</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione suspected it had more to do with the fact that the Capitol thought it might rile up the residents of District 12 if their one and only champion got killed off. No matter how fucked up with PTSD and alcohol Haymitch was these days, he was still proof that someone from District 12 could win the Games. And as horrible as it sounded, the people of District 12 were used to losing two kids from the community every year. It always happened. So this reaping was just like any other for them. Their tributes would be doomed just like every other year. And their priced Victor would remain alive. </p>
<p align="justify">Hermione stood grouped with the other female teenagers in the town square of Hall of Justice. Dressed up in her Sunday outfit which was saved for special occasions. Which almost always was the Reaping. This was her last year. She was 18 now and next year she would be too old to be a tribute. She would have made it. But now her name was in the pot seven times. Plus the times they had needed food rations so badly that she had added it extra. She didn’t dare to add up the full amount. </p>
<p align="justify">The atmosphere in the town square was thick. Parents afraid for their children. Children afraid to be chosen for slaughter. Their lives all in the hands of the Capitol escort Effie Trinket. She was the one who was going to draw their names from the glass bowls. Dressed in pink and with a big hair wig she looked as out of place as anyone could in District 12. </p>
<p align="justify">“Lady’s first,” the escort announced as if this was an honor. As if anyone here was going to <em> want </em> this. Effie reached into the bowl and pushed her fingers past several name cards and grabbed one from the bottom. It simply took a second but time stretched for Hermione as if it had taken Effie hours to read the name out loud. </p>
<p align="justify">“Hermione Granger.”</p>
<p align="justify">The relief that flooded the square was palpable. There were a few gasps, sure. But mostly parents were glad that their kids would live to see another Reaping. And the girls felt relieved that it wasn’t their name being called. </p>
<p align="justify">Various heads spun around to look at Hermione who just stood frozen amongst them. Shocked. Scared. <em> Furious.  </em></p>
<p align="justify">“Hermione Granger,” Effie repeated her name. “There you are, dear! Come on up!” </p>
<p align="justify">How cheerful that woman sounded should have been a crime in itself. And it only infuriated Hermione that much more. Someone behind her gently gave her a push which was enough to send her into motion towards the stage. She knew where her parents were standing. She could hear her mother cry in the silence that followed the announcement. But she couldn’t bring herself to look at them. She didn’t want to cry. She didn’t want to make a satisfying scene for the Capitol. </p>
<p align="justify">Effie was shaking her hand in congratulations but Hermione just felt numb now. Her ears were ringing. There was another tribute chosen. She didn’t even hear the name of the boy that would join her. Not that it mattered. Their chances would barely improve when teaming up. And even then they would have to kill each other in order to win the Games. Making friends wasn’t exactly high on Hermione’s priority list right now. So she just glanced at him when he joined her on stage. She had seen him before. But Hermione couldn’t even remember his name. But he was tall and looked pretty strong. His chances were already better than hers.</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione’s gaze wandered back to Effie Trinket. Who sounded so cheerful that one could assume that they had just won the lottery. But from up close it all looked fake. Just like her big hair on top of her head. </p>
<p align="justify">The train head towards the Capitol would be leaving soon and there wasn’t much time for Hermione to say goodbye to her family. And it was probably better that way too. Her mother was absolutely devastated. A sobbing mess. And even her father was close to tears when he was always so composed and reserved. </p>
<p align="justify">It was hard for Hermione to see them that way. It made leaving that much harder. Her mother kept mumbling that this wasn’t fair and that she wasn’t going to let her daughter go. And Hermione kept trying to tell them that she would come back. That she would win and she would come back home. None of them believed her promises but in that moment they helped anyways. </p>
<p align="justify">Her best friend Luna was there too. Quiet and quirky but steadfast and loyal. They had grown up together, were the same age. At least Hermione left District 12 knowing that at least one of them had made it. Luna would be 19 next year. And her name would be removed from the glass bowl. Luna was save. And Luna promised to look after Hermione’s parents. After their few exchanged words the friends just hugged. Hermione clinging to her until the Peacekeepers pretty much dragged her off, forcing her towards the train station. </p>
<p align="justify">Apparently it was time to leave.</p>
<p align="justify">After anger, grief and a complete turmoil of emotions Hermione felt composed again. Numb. It was as if her brain had shut down. It was probably self preservation, but Hermione didn’t have the energy to really dwell on the how or why. She was just relieved that she had stopped crying for now. </p>
<p align="justify">When they boarded the train Hermione wanted nothing more than to flee to her private quarters, but apparently she would have no such luck. Effie insisted on proper introductions. </p>
<p align="justify">“So, I’m sure we will be having a grand time,” Effie began and Haymitch just snorted. Hermione had never liked him much but she couldn’t help but agree. This was absolutely ridiculous. But the escort just ignored him. “I’m Effie. And I’ll help you find your way around the Capitol. Things there will be very much different from the world you know. You’ll be so impressed!” </p>
<p align="justify">“Right…” Hermione mumbled and rolled her eyes. “I just want to sleep.” And possibly curl up in a corner and cry. </p>
<p align="justify">“But there is going to be food!” Effie protested. “And we all have to get to know each other better.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Food sounds good,” the male tribute spoke for the first time. Hermione still didn’t know his name. She had blacked out to her surroundings after being chosen. But the redhead was already annoying. </p>
<p align="justify">“I’m going,” Hermione announced and stood up. This was pointless.</p>
<p align="justify">“But the food!” Effie protested again. “And Ronald here is staying for some dinner too.”</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione just shook her head and stormed off. She wasn’t going to get stuffed like a turkey about to be slaughtered. </p>
<p align="justify">---  --- ---  --- ---</p>
<p align="justify">District 1 wasn’t used to having a normal Reaping ceremony. There were always Careers volunteering. They were always eager to get the fame and prestige a win would mean. The mood was one of excitement instead of paralyzing fear. </p>
<p align="justify">But this year was different. A Quarter Quell just consisting of Victors. The audacity! It was the most ridiculous thing! They had been promised a life of riches and fame. What no one had even told the Careers though was what came after winning. Yes, there were riches. And there was fame. But there was also the PTSD, the lack of friends. The being paraded around the Capitol part where even richer people wanted to buy your body.</p>
<p align="justify">Bellatrix was ripped from her thoughts when her name was called and the crowd erupted into cheers. But not because they were cheering her on, oh no. Bellatrix knew better than that. They were happy that their other beloved female Victors weren’t send back into the arena. They were happy that the one winner who everyone hated would be sent back. Bellatrix knew how to provide a show. Blood thirsty assholes, all of them. She could give them that. Yes. But if she died then they wouldn’t care either. She had never agreed to their games and rules. She hadn’t sold her body to a rich Capitol asshole to gain even more money and favors for her District. She had even attacked Rodolphus Lestrange who had tried to force her into his bed. She had almost bitten off his ear and ever since then had been shunned from most events in the Capitol. </p>
<p align="justify">Bellatrix had done it before. And she would do it again. She would win these god forsaken Games again. Just out of spite. With her head held high and a manic smirk on her features Bellatrix walked up the stage. She found her sisters in the crowd. They were the only people who looked horrified. They were also the only people who mattered in Bellatrix’ eyes. After all, she had become a Career so her two baby sisters wouldn’t have to. They had been able to lead a sheltered life. Without a worry in the world. They had both gotten married. Either had a child. Bellatrix had sacrificed it all for them. It had been worth it. But she hadn’t been prepared to have to do it all <em> again. </em></p>
<p align="justify">“You’re all going to fucking regret this!” she yelled from her spot on the stage and was immediately grabbed by five peacekeepers. It was excessive but they knew that when it came to Bellatrix Black that they couldn’t be careful enough. She had just enough crazy inside her to make anything possible. After all she had killed someone with a pebble during her Games. </p>
<p align="justify">Making her go back into an arena to kill others. It was nothing she had planned to ever do again. People had always thought she had enjoyed the killing. After all she had been a Career. She knew what she had been preparing for all her life, right? And the killing had been easy. During the Games she had just functioned. She needed to survive. There were no friends. And the whip they had provided for her at the cornucopia had done the rest. The whip had always been her most favorite weapon. </p>
<p align="justify">But after killing so many young lives? Returning to a normal life was difficult. And Bella had been so angry. With everyone and everything. Much like she was right now. Capitol had called her unhinged and unpredictable. And she was. She would show them. </p>
<p align="justify">Thanks to her little outburst she wasn’t allowed to say goodbye to her sisters. It wouldn’t have done anyone any good anyways. They had said what needed to be said the day before, preparing for the worst. </p>
<p align="justify">Now Bellatrix was on the train to the Capitol. A second time in her life. And she was ready to kill.</p>
