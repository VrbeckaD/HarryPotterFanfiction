    <em>Harry hurried up alongside them--for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them--and then his mouth fell open.</em>
  </p>
  <p>Dragons.</p>
  <p>
    <em>Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing on their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting...</em>

</blockquote><p>Harry stepped out of the fireplace into his parents' Hogsmeade cottage. "I know what the first task is."</p><p>Newt swallowed half a sandwich he'd been eating. "What?"  </p><p>"Have you been cheating?" Tina asked.</p><p>"Oh, let him be," Newt mumbled. "Sides, it's not he's the only one. You can bet the others will be sneaking around. Schools are the worst place to keep secrets, everybody's got to stick their nose in."</p><p>"I didn't mean to--Hagrid just said I should come out around midnight--so I followed him and Madame Maxine--and--" Harry grinned. "You'll never guess."</p><p>"They're making you translate ancient runes?" Tina joked. </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. "What kind of a tournament would that be? Seriously, who would watch it--well, maybe Hermoine," he admitted. "But no, not runes. Dragons!"</p><p>"Dragons? What kind?"</p><p>"Hagrid didn't ask. But Charlie was there, so they're probably all from the Romanian reserve."</p><p>"And he didn't tell us he was coming? Just for that, I'll take his name off the Christmas card list." Newt grinned.  "And you're fighting them?"</p><p>"No, just getting past them."</p><p>"Getting past them? Getting past them?" Newt burst out laughing.  "Three Headmasters, two Ministry officials, and the best test they can come up with is <em>getting past </em>a few dragons? Why not feed some mooncalves while you're at it?"</p><p>"Newt," Tina warned. "Professional pride is all well and good, but Harry is still going up against several tonnes of fire-breathing beast.  I'd like to hear how he plans to get through it."</p><p>"You sure you wouldn't rather wait and be surprised?" Newt leaned back in his seat. "But I suppose you have a point." </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>

    <em> ...and there was the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground.</em>

</blockquote><p>Harry paused for a moment to roll up the sleeves of his borrowed robe. Charlie was a good bit taller and broader than any third-year, but Harry didn't want to make too many alterations.  </p><p>The Horntail sniffed the air, tongue flickering in and out. </p><p>"Hey there, girl, hey, hey," Harry pitched his voice higher. "Hey, Scorch,that's what they call you, isn't it? Must have been a nasty trip here, all the way from Romania, hey?" He whispered a spell; fizzing sparks shot from his wand. </p><p>Scorch lowered her head but kept staring at him. </p><p>Harry clicked his tongue and whispered another spell. He took one step forward, then another. Each step seemed to take hours. The whole time, he kept talking in the same high-pitched, scratchy tone. </p><p>The golden egg was heavier than expected.  Harry could barely keep hold of it as  he backed away from the Horntail. </p><p>"And our fourth champion, with a time of seven minutes fifty-four seconds, Mr. Harry Potter Scamander."</p><hr/><p> </p><p>"But--but--I don't get it," Ron exclaimed later that night, as he and Harry were getting ready for bed. "I mean, why were you wearing Charlie's old robes? And the clicking thing? And those little spells--what was the point of them?"</p><p>"When I was eight, I wanted to be a dragon," Harry climbed into the four-poster bed. </p><p>"A dragon tamer, right?"</p><p>"No, a dragon. Animangi, right? So I read every book about dragons I could get my hands on. Even struggled through Dad's notes on his work with Ukranian Ironbelllies. They're better at movement than details--cause when you're twenty metres up, it doesn't matter if you can tell a hedgehog from a fox, so long as you can see movement. And scent, of course, they're better than bloodhounds."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"That's why I wore Charlie's robes.  She knew Charlie,  what to expect from him."</p><p>"Fine, but the spells? Surely you weren't trying to hurt it?"</p><p>"Hurt it? Nah, Dad would have my hide. There's signals that dragonkeepers use,  training systems.  Those were the signs for  'allow approach.' Might have mixed up my left and right, though. " </p><p>"Harry, you're bloody brilliant."</p><p>"Now, if only the rest of the tasks could be this easy." Harry thumped his pillow. "Goodnight, Ron."</p><p>"Nite, Harry."</p><p> </p>
