  <em>Dear Draco,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I miss you already. I know our families hate each other, and you're used to the comfort of Malfoy Manor,  but I can't help but wish you were here with me at the Burrow. I think it'd do you good to play four-on-four Quidditch, chase garden Gnomes, and eat food prepared by Mrs. Weasley and not a servant. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And of course, I think us being together for the holidays would be lovely as well. I keep imagining us holding hands under the dinner table, stealing kisses in the halls, finding our way purposefully under the mistletoe, laughing and joking together over a picnic lunch, and taking walks through the garden at sunset. We could even get a jar of fire from Hermione! That way it's more romantic and we won't freeze to death. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I know we'll see each other back at Hogwarts, but Christmas is a special time of year and I hope in the future we can spend our Christmases together. I know I can persuade the Weasley's to let you over. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I wish you were here, and I'm thinking of you</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love, Harry</em>
