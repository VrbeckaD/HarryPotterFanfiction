    <p>James shushed Sirius as they crept down the hallway. It was inconvenient of course, that they needed to search the Forbidden Section for the book on animagi, but they would make do. They always did. They never ended up bring Peter on their adventures due to how <em> loud </em>their friend was. James worried however, that McGonagall would hear them. She definitely would if Sirius kept making all that ruckus.</p><p>“Sirius. She <em> will </em>hear us. We just have to make sure she doesn’t think it’s us… Instead, a mouse or something. Not a lanky-ass third year Sirius Black whose slippers make way too much noise!”</p><p>“Don’t be a bitch,” he hissed back. “These are my only slippers that <em> aren’t </em>hexed. Regulus really went to town on accidental magic this summer.”</p><p>James stifled a laugh. He turned back to say something to Sirius, but saw his face as white as a sheet. He turned again to be eye-to-eye with McGonagall.</p><p>“Uh-uh-er- Hello. Professor. Lovely… night,” James grinned sheepishly.</p><p>Sirius made a face at James. “Fancy meeting you here, Minnie. Can you <em> believe </em>I sleep-walked all the way here?”</p><p>McGonagall looked them over, unamused. “You boys understand I ought to give you detention for a week.”</p><p>James swallowed thickly. “Well, I’m sure we could reach a compro-”</p><p>The old woman cut him off. “However, I have something of an ideas as to the, well, the nature of your… excursion. Of course, it would be completely against the rules for me to tell you that the window second from the left into the Forbidden Section has a broken lock, or that the books on self-transformation are roughly fourteen rows in.”</p><p>The boys stared at her in stunned silence. She sighed and placed her hand on James’s shoulder. “As I will tell you none of this information, I don’t need to worry about you being careful and responsible in this search. That the trustworthy book is under Carecort’s name, not Fluoripian. And that Remus cares more about your well-being than his lonely nights.”</p><p>With that, she stepped back into the dark hall from where she came.</p><p>“Holy shit, did that just happen?” Sirius whispered.</p><p>James blinked hard. “Pinch me.”</p><p>Without skipping a beat, Sirius pinched him. When James yelped, he nodded. “Well, I guess we’re not dreaming. I… Did she just give us permission to break the law?”</p><p>James sighed. “Remus must be doing worse than we thought. C’mon, we don’t have much time.”</p><p>The two of them ran through the halls, only quieting their footfalls when they reached the wall that separated the two libraries.</p><p>James stood on his tiptoes and slammed the heel on his hand on the wood panel of the specified window. It swung open with a crack. “This is so Bad-Ass,” he whispered reverently.</p><p>“Do you know what’s more badass?” Sirius responded, already climbing through the window. He stood a little taller than James, making it a <em> lot </em>easier for him to get through. “Becoming a dragon animagus.”</p><p>James snorted. “Like hell.” He followed Sirius through. They stood in the center of a room they had never entered. “Uhm… Oh! <em> Accio Carecort!” </em></p><p>Roughly eight books pummeled the two of them at once.</p><p>Sirius glanced at all of them. “We’re taking all of these. I’m sure they’ll be useful.”</p><p>James nodded solemnly and began stuffing one under his pajama shirt. “In case we get caught.”</p><p>“I’m sure it’ll be obvious later… I can’t believe your invisibility cloak is too busy covering our work to be used. We need, like, <em> two </em>invisibility cloaks,” Sirius muttered as he enchanted several to grow smaller and shoved them into his pockets.</p><p>James grinned. “An invisibility set of big pajamas.” As soon as they had all the books packed away, they slipped back out into the night.</p><p>-</p><p>James sighed, tired after poring over the volumes of animagi magic. “I think we’ve read enough. Remus will be back in a few hours, we really should just get started Peter.”</p><p>“Lily and him are studying today! We can start then!” protested Peter. He idly flipped another page in the book, squinting at the words as he shoved another piece of chocolate in his mouth. “Besides, you and Sirius look like you’re about to fall asleep. I don’t want to screw up this magic.”</p><p>James kicked at the table leg. “I feel like they’re hanging out a lot now.”</p><p>“Wasn’t that the plan?” Sirius mumbled into his book where he was laying face-down.</p><p>James rolled his eyes. “Yeah… but like, without us encouraging them. Do you… do you really think he likes her, Sirius?”</p><p>“Geez, it’s Evans.” Sirius perked up then, rubbing a hand over his eyes and trying to fully wake up. “Who could even really like her?”</p><p>“I think she’s sweet,” chimed in Peter.</p><p>Sirius glared at him. “See, point proven. Peter is, like, a fake human being. Peter, if you throw that book at me, I’ll hex you.”</p><p>“Can’t hex a fake person,” Peter replied, sticking out his tongue.</p><p>James sprawled his upper half over the table and the books. “I bet she likes him back. That sucks. He’s too nice. No, that’s not true. Remus can be crazy funny-mean sometimes. But… he’s not her type!”</p><p>“I don’t think she has a type. Has Lily dated anyone?” Peter glanced over at Sirius for confirmation, and he shrugged.</p><p>James groaned. “This is so dumb! Whatever. At least he’s better than Snivellus.”</p><p>“Amen to that. What do we have to get done tonight?” Sirius changed the subject maybe a little <em> too </em>eagerly, but both of them looked at James for instructions. He became the leader of the project, of sorts.</p><p>“We’ve got all the ingredients. We have to brew the mix and let it sit as a full body-mask overnight. It’s gonna be… Weird. But good, I think. Because then we should wake up as our animals.”</p><p>Sirius groaned. “I hate potions. And won’t Remus figure it out in the morning when he comes back?”</p><p>“I’m not waiting another month,” Peter muttered.</p><p>“We can all sleep in the bathroom,” James shrugged. “If any of us can’t transform back, the others keep him in there until we figure it out. Easy.”</p><p>“We need a cover story if it doesn’t work. If I’m stuck as a <em> dragon,” </em>Sirius winked, “tell Remus I ended up spending the night with Marlene.”</p><p>“Gross. Believable. I like it.” James sighed and stood up. “Alright lads, let get to brewing.”</p><p>“And if this goes horribly, I call your beds.” Peter cast aside the rest of the books, stacking them neatly beneath the invisibility cloak to make sure they wouldn’t be spotted by Remus.</p><p>-</p><p>The feeling was strange. James knew he was still <em> James, </em>but he was also… Someone else. Something else? He took a moment to evaluate. He had hooves- oh Merlin, if he was a unicorn- but wait, he had two horns. So… a bull? Or… He stood and looked himself in the mirror. A stag.</p><p>With that thought, he saw himself transform into a human.</p><p>“That shit is so tight!” He exclaimed. He saw the forms of two sleeping animals beneath him when he stopped to look. A brown rat and a black dog! James wondered which was which.</p><p>Quickly, he poked his head out the door to make sure Remus wasn’t yet back. Then he started stomping and yelling for his friends to wake up.</p><p>The rat startled immediately while the dog lazily lifted his head. After a few seconds, the rat let out a terrifyingly high-pitched squeak and transformed back into Peter. “We actually <em> did </em>it?”</p><p>“Hell yeah, mate! Merlin’s beard, we actually did it! Now wake up Sirius, we gotta get out before Remus comes back.”</p><p>Sirius stumbled to his feet, shaking out his long fur, and waited. Then, he barked as panicked as a dog can get.</p><p>James blanched. “Sirius. Turn back right now.”</p><p>“It’s easy,” Peter quickly said. “Just think about changing back, and it <em> works. </em>Like, I don’t know how else to explain it.”</p><p>Sirius closed his eyes and waited a moment. Then, he snapped at Peter and looked offended.</p><p>“No bite!” James chastised. He heard something though, and saw Sirius’s tail start to wag. “Remus is- okay, Peter, out now! Sirius, stay. Down boy.”</p><p>Peter stifled a laugh as he ducked out of the bathroom. Then, loudly, he greeted their friend. “Hey, Remus! How was last night?”</p><p>James left the bathroom and slammed the door behind him. He saw Remus grin. “Great! We worked with some people from Ravenclaw to get the Charms theories down. Say, where’s Sirius?”</p><p>James grinned weakly. “He spent the night with Marlene…?”<br/>
Remus shook his head. “No, Marlene was there. He’s not in any trouble, is he?”</p><p>Nobody replied.</p><p>“Guys. Is he?”</p><p>Peter’s cheeks went bright red. “Holy shit, he has to be cheating on Marlene! He told us he was going on a date, and he conjured up flowers and <em> everything. </em>Who did he go on a date with?”</p><p>Remus gasped. “Not really!”</p><p>Peter nodded sincerely. “Yeah! I can’t believe it! You think you know a guy.”</p><p>Remus sighed. “I hope there’s a better explanation. Maybe he just spent all night throwing together a real big surprise for her?” Remus didn’t seem to like that thought.</p><p>James put his hand on Remus’s shoulder. “We’ll talk to him about it when <em> he gets back.” </em>He hoped that last part reached Sirius in the bathroom.</p><p>“Until then, we might as well give up and get breakfast?” Peter offered weakly. When James and Remus stared at him, he laughed awkwardly. “Y’know, I wanna go see Marlene and see if anything gets cleared up. And nothing can be solved here in the dorm when we’re <em> all </em>here.”</p><p>Remus nodded and left the room. James gestured for Peter to follow so it wouldn’t look strange.</p><p>He opened the bathroom door. “You need to fix this now.”</p><p>Sirius whined helplessly and resumed his pacing in the bathroom.</p><p>James knelt on the ground. “Alright, here’s what we’re gonna do. Close your eyes, I’m just gonna talk and you’re gonna pay real good attention to what I say. Hopefully, that’ll work.”</p><p>He waited for Sirius to do so before speaking. “You’re a dog right now. Picture yourself. Not-quite ratty, family dog looking mutt. Now picture yourself as a human. Your lanky limbs, ever growing hair, your love of candy, and some members of your family, and most importantly, your friends. Peter, me, Remus-”</p><p>And then he was back.</p><p>Sirius grinned, a little dazed. “That was really hard for me, Bambi.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t you dare, you dumb dog. What’re you, some lap mutt? Ratty-ass… Padf-Padfeet?”</p><p>“Please, dogs are the most <em> loyal </em>pets… Wait, what color was I? I think it was black, but dogs are kinda color-blind so?” Sirius shrugged.</p><p>“Yeah, black. Or dark brown? No, definitely black. Like your hair. Ready to go tell Remus the “real reason” you were out all night?” James asked.</p><p>Sirius paused before shaking his head. “No way. We gotta get better control of it first.”</p><p>“No. I mean make up a reason.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s easy. I’ll go chat with Marlene for a bit, and then I’ll come up and say I chickened out or some shit.” He grinned crookedly. “He’ll be used to that with how often <em> both </em>of you back out of asking Lily out.”</p><p>James blushed. “Oh, shut up you. C’mon, let’s eat.”</p>
