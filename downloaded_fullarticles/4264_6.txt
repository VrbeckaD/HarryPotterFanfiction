    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>In retrospect, the only truly surprising thing about the whole affair was that it was Peter’s idea.</p>
<p>Peter,
in James’s experience, was not typically an ideas man. When you wanted
ideas, creativity, rebellion, and general off-the-wall shenanigans, you
went directly to the source of all such notions, which was, of course,
Sirius Black. There was no point in asking Peter Pettigrew what he
thought, because he generally didn’t.</p>
<p>James
supposed that if most people had to guess, they’d say that Remus Lupin
was the voice of reason. Those people would be correct—but you’d be a
fool to go to him and expect him to talk you out of doing anything.</p>
<p>Sirius
had mistaken Remus’s thoughtful frown for disapproval once. He’d
rounded on him, about to scathingly deride him for being a wet blanket,
when Remus stopped him by saying what he’d been thinking about, which
was not all the reasons not to do the thing Sirius had proposed, but
rather an incredibly thorough plan on how to actually make “let’s turn
all the Slytherin’s scarves pink” actually happen without getting
caught. <em>And</em> he’d come up with a way to make sure the smell of roses stayed in their hair for a week.</p>
<p>This
was in first year, which was why the plan was…well, it had been a good
start, but it would never make it into the Hogwarts Pranks Hall of
Fame. Especially not after the things they pulled in their third year.
James still got little tingles of joy thinking about Lucius Malfoy’s
hat collection that year.</p>
<p>The point was, Sirius never underestimated Remus again.</p>
<p>No, wait. That wasn’t the point.</p>
<p>The
point was, Peter had been the one to do all the sneaking around. Yes.
That was it. Sirius had ideas, Remus had strategies, Peter had stealth.
And James was the incredibly necessary glue that held them all
together. The mastermind! The leader!</p>
<p>Also, he had an Invisibility Cloak.</p>
<p>But
Peter didn’t sneak into places without being told to first. Oh, he
would enthusiastically pounce on an idea—if James or Sirius had it
first and everyone was on board with it—and steal as many potions
ingredients as they could ever possibly need, or turn into a rat and
chew through all the shoelaces in the Slytherin dormitory, or <em>whatever,</em> but he needed direction, and lots of support.</p>
<p>So
on January 2, 1977, when Peter Pettigrew rolled reluctantly out of bed
and flopped onto the floor and groaned about not wanting to go to
class, and his pyjamas rode up a bit and the Marauders all got a good
glimpse of the tattoo on his ankle that was an outline of a rat—</p>
<p>Suffice to say that James’s ears were still ringing a week later from Sirius’s shout of indignation and horror and <em>how
dare you get a tattoo without me and also before me, I am ruined, my
life is over, what is the world coming to, I am betrayed</em> and honestly at that point James had put on his glasses and hit him with a <em>Silencio</em>, if only to stop Remus from beating him over the head with a book (Remus was <em>not</em> a morning person) and the whole affair had ended with a violent-yet-blessedly-silent scuffle.</p>
<p>And
then they had gone to breakfast, and to class, and it wasn’t that
school was exactly the most interesting of distractions, but Lily had
sat down at a desk near him without glaring at him and honestly that
drove everything out of James’s head for the rest of the day and he
completely forgot to ask Peter what had brought this on, mostly from
the amount of effort and focus it took not to start doodling “Lily
Potter” all over his notes. Again.</p>
<p>Sirius was not so easily dissuaded. He was just unusually patient.</p>
<p>Which
meant, of course, that he waited until everyone was getting ready for
bed to tackle Peter to the ground and demand an explanation.</p>
<p>Peter
turned into a rat purely on instinct and out of self-defense,
naturally, but Sirius was used to this song and dance and grabbed him
before he could disappear under the beds for the whole night. Again.</p>
<p>“Not today, Pettigrew,” he growled at the rat he was now holding. “I want answers. <em>Now</em>.”</p>
<p>“God
dammit,” said Remus, and James had to fight not to snap his eyes to
Sirius. He always had interesting reactions to Moony’s sailor mouth,
though James would be damned if he knew why. You’d think after six
years he’d be used to the contradiction in terms that was Remus Lupin.
“Can we not go <em>one night</em> without doing this.”</p>
<p>There
was a squeak, and Peter transformed, now bright red with embarrassment.
“No,” said Sirius, pointing a finger that was shaking with anger. “<em>I must know</em>.”</p>
<p>“I just…wanted one?” Peter tried.</p>
<p>“<em>A likely story</em>,” Sirius snarled. Remus rolled his eyes, and swatted him with a rolled up <em>Daily Prophet</em>.
A year ago this would have prompted yet another scuffle—this year, all
that happened was that Sirius grabbed it, chucked it at him, and Remus
batted it away, laughing. Then Sirius turned back to Peter.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Interesting.</p>
<p>Peter groaned. “Does it matter? Really? I got a tattoo, it’s not a big deal, can we move on?”</p>
<p>“That
means it’s an embarrassing story,” said James, now fully engaged and
sure that there would be no sleep until the mystery was solved.</p>
<p>Sirius grinned, a bit wolfishly. “You’re <em>right</em>,” he said. “C’mon, Wormtail, let’s hear it.”</p>
<p>“It
is a Muggle tattoo,” said Remus thoughtfully. When everyone turned to
look at him, he shrugged. “It’s easy to tell. Wizards can’t resist
putting some kind of magic in their tattoos—to make them move, or
change color, or fade under certain circumstances, or all sorts of
things. They infuse the spells in the ink ahead of time and it mixes
with the magic in the wizard’s own body to create certain effects.”</p>
<p>“Is this another werewolf thing?” said James. “Can you smell magic? What does it smell like?”</p>
<p>“He
can sense it sometimes,” said Sirius, flapping his hand dismissively.
“Mostly when a place or an object is spelled or infused with it, he can
just kind of tell. Some animals can do it too, especially magical ones,
and the wolf is definitely a magical animal if nothing else, this is
not important, why are we wasting time talking about this, <em>we need to talk about Peter’s tattoo</em>.”</p>
<p>James looked at Remus, who shrugged, then back at Peter. “Okay…so what were you doing in a Muggle tattoo parlor on Boxing Day?”</p>
<p>Now they were all staring at him<em>.</em>
“What?” he said. “It’s obvious! It’s the only day he would have been
able to get out without his mum noticing. She always has too much
brandy with Christmas dinner, and sleeps all day the next day, and…okay
why are you still staring at me, how do you not know this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember ever telling you any of that,” Peter said.</p>
<p>“Well, you did.”</p>
<p>“You
are terrifying,” said Remus. “Is this why you always pass exams? People
tell you something once and your mind clings to it like a vice?”</p>
<p>“I
was just really cooped up,” said Peter quickly, before James could
respond and descend into bickering. “And, you know, I’ve been crawling
around the walls in Hogwarts for the Map, and I kind of missed it, so…”</p>
<p>“You complained every day of those six months you had to climb around in the walls,” said James.</p>
<p>“So
you turned into a rat and snuck out. And went straight to a tattoo
parlor,” Sirius said over him, waving away the unimportant details.</p>
<p>Peter’s
face was bright red again, and he shifted uncomfortably. “Er…not
exactly. I mean. Um. Just, you know, hypothetically, if she left the
brandy out while she was still sleeping off the hangover…”</p>
<p>It took a minute, but when the light dawned on Sirius’s face, it burst out in a sunrise of glee. “Peter! You <em>didn’t</em>!”</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>“You got drunk and transformed into a rat and snuck out of your house and <em>got a tattoo</em>.”</p>
<p>“Um.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe this!! Why didn’t you tell me!! Would it kill you to send an owl, or take the Knight Bus, or—”</p>
<p>“Why
a tattoo, though?” Remus interrupted when he showed no sign of
stopping. Because of course he would ask the stupidest question
possible—smart bloke, that Remus Lupin, but not very savvy in some ways.</p>
<p>“What else do you do when you’re drunk and sneaking out of the house?” said James.</p>
<p>“Is there any other way to get a tattoo?” said Sirius, at the same time.</p>
<p>Peter just shrugged. “It seemed like the most likely thing to piss her off, if she knew about it.”</p>
<p>He
didn’t have the best relationship with his mum, and didn’t need to
explain what Christmas had been like to make him want to sneak out of
the house and do something likely to infuriate her. They had heard
stories about Mrs. Pettigrew before, and could guess.</p>
<p>But there was someone in the room who had it worse.</p>
<p>“Peter,” Sirius said solemnly, “you are an inspiration to us all.”</p>
<p>“Oh no,” said Remus.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>The first debate was over whether they should go to a Muggle place, or get a wizard to do it.</p>
<p>Well,
technically, and if you asked Remus, the debate was whether to do it at
all, but Sirius and James both knew it was a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>(Actually
what Sirius said was, “Let’s just work out the plan and he’ll either
get involved just to make sure we don’t fuck it up beyond repair, or
he’ll get very invested in it and talk himself into it. Also don’t
worry about the other part of it, I have an idea that will talk him
round. Once he’s ready to listen.”</p>
<p>“Other part?” James had said.</p>
<p>Sirius
had raised both eyebrows at him, apparently surprised he hadn’t already
thought about it. “Um? Hello? Furry little problem? We’re getting our
Animagus forms, obviously, but in what universe would Moony want a
reminder of <em>that</em> on his skin? Not to mention he’d basically be <em>advertising</em>—”</p>
<p>“Especially if it was in a visible place,” said James, realizing. “Damn. I forgot.”</p>
<p>“I’ll
handle it,” Sirius had said, and so James had shrugged and not asked
questions. Sometimes it was better to let Remus and Sirius work out
certain things between them—there were things they understood about
each other on a bone-deep level that James would only start to grasp
after lengthy explanations. He thought it might be a dog thing.</p>
<p>The thing was, Wizarding tattoos had a whole host of benefits. James could get a deer that <em>pranced around</em> <em>at will</em>.
It was so cool he could barely handle the possibility. Remus pointed
out, because of course he would think about this, that they could be
spelled to be resistant to Polyjuice, so anyone pretending to be you
would have a big distinctive marker missing. Or you could will them
invisible when you didn’t want anyone to see them, and by the way he
wasn’t a huge fan of having identifying marks, <em>friends</em>, remember that he’d prefer to retain a certain amount of anonymity—</p>
<p>Sirius patted him on the back. “It’s just ink,” he said. “You could add all that stuff later.”</p>
<p>“Much harder to spell ink that’s already infused in your skin than to do it ahead of time,” Remus said grimly.</p>
<p>Sirius raised an eyebrow at him, the one that meant <em>oh. A challenge</em>.
Remus responded with a press of his thumb to his forehead, which Remus
probably thought meant whatever was said was too stupid to even respond
to, but actually meant he was thinking it over.</p>
<p>James
grinned. “We’re going to have a much harder time convincing a Wizarding
place to take us,” he said. “Me and Remus aren’t seventeen until March,
and they’ll want proof of age even if we disguise ourselves.”</p>
<p>“We
couldn’t even wait until summer break to do this?” Remus said, to the
parchment he was now looking at. He had gone back to pretending to be
above this discussion and also writing an essay, but he still had ears,
and, apparently, opinions.</p>
<p>“Of
course not!” Sirius said, slamming a hand on the table, making everyone
but James jump a foot in the air. “This is vital! This is the most
important moment of our lives! We must do it at once! <em>Peter got a tattoo before me!</em> This cannot stand!”</p>
<p>“Of course, what was I thinking.”</p>
<p>“What <em>were</em> you thinking, Moony, this betrayal—”</p>
<p>“Muggles
want you to be eighteen to get a tattoo,” Peter said, with the kind of
let’s-stop-this-argument-now timing that all of the Marauders had
perfected, when they weren’t one of the ones arguing.</p>
<p>“<em>You</em> weren’t eighteen,” Sirius said.</p>
<p>“I’m seventeen, though,” he pointed out. “No Trace. I just Confunded him.”</p>
<p>“While drunk?” said Remus. “Have you ever even managed that spell sober?”</p>
<p>Peter shrugged. “No. But it’s easier on Muggles. They don’t expect it.”</p>
<p>“That’s…slightly
worrying, actually,” said Remus. When Peter shrugged, he blinked, then
shook his head and looked back down at his parchment.</p>
<p>“I’m
seventeen,” said Sirius in the tones of someone determined to barrel
through this conversation if it killed him. “I’ll do the spell for you
children.”</p>
<p>“Or you could get fake IDs,” said Peter.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Remus, without looking up. “Someone get us a real one to model them on.”</p>
<p>There was a thoughtful silence.</p>
<p>“Crap,” said Sirius. “He’s right. Who do we know that would have a Muggle ID?”</p>
<p>“Lily
Evans,” said James promptly, and ignored his worthless rubbish friends
when they all groaned and made comments of “oh god, here we go” and
“must you bring her up at every opportunity?” and “for a minute there,
I thought he was thinking of something else for once, silly me.” He did
not even glare at them. Really. He just said, “What? She probably does.”</p>
<p>“And she’ll definitely loan it to you without getting suspicious,” said Remus. How on earth did he manage to do homework <em>and</em> throw out sarcastic comments? James never could work out his secret. Stupid crafty werewolves.</p>
<p>On second thought, that was probably a skill he’d honed from Six
Years Of Living With Sirius Black. Even now, Sirius was carrying on
this conversation while diligently and patiently dropping bits of
parchment into Remus’s hair
and waiting for him to notice. Somehow, without saying a single word,
he’d roped Peter into ripping up pieces into confetti under the table
and passing them to him.</p>
<p>James
didn’t say anything, of course. He was looking forward to seeing what
Remus would do when he noticed. He’d never quite worked out when or why
Annoying Moony had become Sirius’s favorite pastime, but he did enjoy
Remus’s reactions, which were sometimes anti-climactic, but not always.</p>
<p>Sirius probably did too, come to think of it. Maybe that was why.</p>
<p>Back to the topic at hand. “I could steal it,” he said.</p>
<p>“<em>No,</em>”
said Remus—and Sirius, to James’s surprise—emphatically. They exchanged
a look that was full of long-suffering despair, which James thought was
distinctly unfair coming from one man with parchment confetti in his
hair and another who would set you on fire if you so much as touched
his hair.</p>
<p>“James, you want her to <em>like</em> you,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“Stealing her stuff is not a good beginning,” said Remus. “Even if you could get away with it without her noticing.”</p>
<p>“She would set you on fire,” said Peter, helpfully.</p>
<p>James
slumped down in his chair. “I don’t know why I’m friends with any of
you,” he said. “You are useless, traitorous, conniving—”</p>
<p>“I’ll just Confund whoever we go to,” Sirius said. “Now, more importantly—”</p>
<p>“Wizarding
tattoos probably hurt less,” Peter said, then blinked when they all
stared at him. “What? I just thought I’d mention it.”</p>
<p>Remus sighed and shook his head, <em>hard</em>,
showering all of them and especially Sirius with tiny bits of
parchment, and coincidentally confirming James’s suspicion that he had
known all along what Sirius was doing.</p>
<p>Sirius
laughed, surprised and delighted, the laugh that was a bit too close to
a bark and always had been. Remus casually brushed bits of parchment
off his essay and returned to work, but he was smiling—faintly, but
smiling.</p>
<p>James
grinned, and would have started flinging handfuls of the confetti at
Sirius, if Sirius hadn’t been so impressively persistent today.
“Doesn’t it depend on the method? There’s enchanted needles and ink,
but there are also ways of just doing it with a spell…”</p>
<p>“I’ve
heard that burns like hell,” said Sirius, then shrugged when they
looked at him. “Noble And Most Ancient House Of Pure-Blood Pricks? You
hear things. Of course, there are numbing spells.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t Muggles give you anything for the pain?” he said.</p>
<p>“Dunno,” said Peter. “Didn’t ask. I think I might have blacked out for part of it, if I’m honest.”</p>
<p>“Muggles,”
said James dismissively. “They just aren’t as advanced as we are.
Anyway, we can probably find our own pain relief spe—”</p>
<p>“You
need an actual medical professional to administer anesthesia,” said a
new voice, and they all turned to see Lily Evans, looming over them and
looking disapproving. “Which would drive up the price and leave tattoo
parlors open to lawsuits. Also, said medical professionals are pretty
averse to knocking you out except for surgeries and the like, when they
absolutely have to, for very good health reasons. Topical anesthesia,
on the other hand, isn’t a viable option <em>yet</em>,
but it could be soon—if they wouldn’t lessen the tattoo quality, which
they might, and next time you have something to say about those
backwards Muggles, I strongly suggest reading a book before you speak.”</p>
<p>“How long have you been standing there?” said James, when he could get a word in edgewise.</p>
<p>“How do you know that?” Sirius said at the same time.</p>
<p>“You two have got to stop doing that,” Remus murmured, but no one paid attention to him.</p>
<p>“I
came in right around the time the Common Room started snowing
parchment,” Lily said. Her voice was dry enough to cure an entire
flood-damaged region, though of course her hair and eyes were as lovely
as ever, and James stamped down on <em>that</em> thought before it could leave his mouth and get him killed. “And I know that because I started doing some ‘less advanced’<em> </em>Muggle medical training over the summer.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to be a Healer?” James said, honestly interested.</p>
<p>Lily
shot him a suspicious look, and relaxed only a bit when he looked back
with his most bewildered and innocent expression. “Or a doctor,” she
said. “I haven’t decided.”</p>
<p>“You’d go into a Muggle profession?” said Remus. She didn’t look at <em>him</em>
suspiciously, James noted, though he tried not to dwell on that train
of thought. He was getting better at this self-control thing.</p>
<p>She
shrugged. “Maybe. My parents would like it, but maybe I’m also just
tired of wizards who think they’re the end all and be all of knowledge
in the universe, and would like to learn what the scientific method has
to say about the human body.”</p>
<p>Sirius
opened his mouth, most likely to say something about scientifically
exploring human bodies that would have had him sprouting boils all over
his own body for the next three weeks, and even McGonagall would
probably say it was deserved. Remus kicked him under the table. He shut
his mouth, and tried to hide the fact that his eyes were watering in
pain.</p>
<p>James let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, and nodded slightly at Remus to acknowledge his “you’re <em>welcome</em>”
expression. “What have you learned so far?” He said politely, and then
a thought struck him. “And how did you know that stuff about tattoos
specifically?”</p>
<p>At
this—and James never would have believed it if he hadn’t seen and heard
it with his own two eyes and ears—Lily smirked, and her (stunning,
green, glorious pools of emerald beauty) eyes glinted mischievously. “I
asked my tattoo artist,” she said. “Good luck, gentlemen.”</p>
<p>And then she was gone.</p>
<p>A hush, appropriately, fell over the table. Sirius was the one finally to break it.</p>
<p>“Please convince her to date you,” he said. “I want her in our group.”</p>
<p>“You
could try just being her friend,” said Remus. “Talking to girls isn’t
contingent on your best friend dating them.” He paused. “Or you dating
them, for that matter.” He was smiling faintly again, for some reason.</p>
<p>James didn’t fully understand why <em>that</em>
got a snort out of Sirius, or an absurdly fond look aimed at Remus.
“Somehow I think James will have more luck convincing Lily Evans to
like him than I would,” he said. “And you know I’ll never date a woman
again, Moony, I’ve given that up.”</p>
<p>Remus’s expression was unreadable, at least to James. “Oh? And why’s that, Pads?”</p>
<p>Sirius
sighed his best dramatically burdened sigh. “I just break their
hearts,” he said. “They can’t take being with someone whose hair is so
much better than theirs.”</p>
<p>Now Remus was <em>really</em>
smiling, and not the faint “I’m pretending I don’t know what a little
shit I’m being” one, or the “I am enjoying your pain and you deserve
this” one. It looked similar, but you could tell by the crinkling
around eyes that he was really laughing. That, and Sirius was beaming.
“That does explain a lot,” he said, and picked one final piece of
parchment out of his hair, to flick at Sirius. It landed right on
target in his hair. Sirius did not shake it out. He didn’t throw a “how
dare you touch my hair” tantrum, or <em>anything</em>. What. “I’m sorry your life will be so lonely.”</p>
<p>James
looked at Peter, to see if he could also tell that there were two
conversations going on here, and one was a secret that they were not a
part of. Peter looked back at him, blankly.</p>
<p>Hmmm. He would have to figure this one out on his own, then.</p>
<p>“So it’s agreed,” he said, and everyone seemed to snap out of it, whatever “it” was.</p>
<p>“What is?” said Peter.</p>
<p>“Muggle
tattoos,” James said, with finality. “We can handle pain, gentlemen.
We’ve all had worse before. We can handle Muggle bureaucracy. Sirius
and Peter are both real adults who can use magic to trick people
without consequences! What we cannot handle is Lily Evans being tougher
than me, or not telling me where her tattoo is or what it is, or—”</p>
<p>“James,” said Sirius, Peter, and Remus, together.</p>
<p>“What? What was I talking about?”</p>
<p>“Why
going to a Muggle place is somehow a good idea,” said Remus. He and
Lily probably practiced sounding dry and unamused in the mirror. Maybe
one of them would teach him someday.</p>
<p>“Right. Well, it would send Padfoot’s mum into a raging fit. If she knew.”</p>
<p>“That’s <em>true</em>,” said Sirius immediately. “You’re right as always, Prongs. Muggle parlor it is.”</p>
<p>“I’m sold,” said Peter. “If I had to suffer through it, so do you lot.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were—never mind,” said James. You had to pick your battles, with this group.</p>
<p>“Has anyone noticed that I still haven’t agreed to this?” said Remus, apparently to empty air, because they all ignored him.</p>
<p>Well,
not entirely. Sirius grinned at him, wolfishly, which made Remus sigh,
roll his eyes, and go back to pretending to do homework again.</p>
<p>His ears were a bit red, though.</p>
<p>And James had seen red ears like that before.</p>
<p>He
smiled to himself, just a little. So Sirius and Remus were keeping
things from him, and thought they were being stealthy about it?</p>
<p>This was going to be <em>so interesting</em>.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>The plan was simple: blackmail one of Lily’s friends, and get her to tell James where her tattoo was.</p>
<p>Wait, no. <em>No</em>,
he told himself sternly. All of Lily’s friends were terrifying and
could easily take him down even if he did have dirt on them, which he
didn’t. Also, blackmail was wrong. Also, he wasn’t going to stalk Lily
Evans anymore. Really. No, <em>really</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>real</em> plan, the actual plan that James was actually going to use to get a tattoo and not stalk Lily Evans—no, <em>really</em>—was
simple. They would sneak into Hogsmeade, disguise themselves with one
of the multitude of appearance-changing spells that they’d all gotten
good at after six years of mischief at Hogwarts, take the Knight Bus,
and boom, illegal tattoos, easy.</p>
<p>Remus
had sighed the sigh of a thousand disappointed professors when he heard
this, and pointed out the blindingly obvious flaws: where were they
going to go, and what designs were they going to get?</p>
<p>So
they were stalled a little bit, in what Remus called the “research and
development” phase, and what Sirius referred to as “fucking kill me
just kill me let’s set something on fire why do we have to do this I am
literally dying, Moony, do you see these gray hairs you’re giving me, <em>do you</em>.”</p>
<p>James
got him to be quiet by promising to find out who Lily’s tattoo artist
was. Which was the real reason he was considering blackmail, because
there was no way she would ever talk to him. Sirius had pointed that
out, too, so really they had agreed to make Remus ask her, and for
that, they had to convince him to go along with the plan.</p>
<p>Which was Sirius’s problem, and <em>that</em> was what actually got Sirius to shut up and focus.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Designs
were easy. Peter had to draw them. He had drawn the design for his own
tattoo, after all, and it looked fine. James had been heavily impressed
that he’d drawn it after having too much of his mum’s brandy, but it
turned out it was a drawing he’d had for a while, and he had just
brought it with him.</p>
<p>It
occurred to James, dimly, that most people probably didn’t doodle rats
in their spare time. With a few extremely talented exceptions, most
impulsive doodlers stuck to flowers or the occasional stick figure.</p>
<p>(Talented
exceptions, of course, included the likes of Lily’s friend Mary, who
had once doodled an impressive caricature of Professor Binns that got
passed around the whole school until she started getting requests. She
charged a Sickle to do ones of people and their friends. James still
had the one of him somewhere.)</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the point. The point was, most people were incredibly boring.</p>
<p>Most
people also probably didn’t sneak around after-hours trying to catch
their best friends alone, to find out if and how much they were
snogging. And yet, here he was. He had been following these two idiots
for a week and had no results to speak of, other than the discovery
that Remus and Sirius were <em>really really weird</em>. </p>
<p>For
example, the second day of following them he found out that they had a
secret spot on the roof—which, first of all, how dare they, why didn’t
he know about this sooner—and they didn’t even use it to light things
on fire in private. No, they just went up there with a flame in a jar
for warmth, bundled up in coats, and laid on the roof looking at the
stars. Sometimes Sirius’s head was on Remus’s shoulders, but that was
as close as they got.</p>
<p>Also, they always went at an hour when the moon wasn’t visible from that part of the roof.</p>
<p>They
rarely talked, too, except very quietly, and usually things like “Is
that my sweater?” “…yes.” “(heavy sigh) Do you have to do that?” “Well,
your sweaters are warm.” “You’re a prick.” and then…more silence.</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>James
had never known Sirius to sit still for more than five minutes at a
time, and even then he was a fidgety fucker. In what universe did he
and Remus just hang out <em>being quiet</em> together?!</p>
<p>And
it got worse. He had hunkered down in a corner of the Common Room under
the Invisibility Cloak one evening when Sirius and Remus were there,
and they had talked that time, but it had been an extremely animated
and detailed discussion about a book they had both read.</p>
<p>A <em>book</em>.</p>
<p>All
while playing Exploding Snap, to be sure, but they just ducked out of
the way of random explosions and carried on like nothing had happened.</p>
<p>And then it had derailed into politics, and the current state of affairs in the Wizarding world, and <em>Lily</em>
of all people had walked past and got pulled into the discussion, and
Remus dealt her into the game without even asking. Then it turned out
she had read the book too, and they all discussed this together, and
Sirius didn’t even seem to mind when she called him a close-minded
Pureblood twat and explained what a “movie” was. Then he asked if she
had any more ballpoint pens he could borrow, whatever <em>that</em>
was. Since when did Lily loan Sirius Muggle things?! Was this how
Sirius had gotten his hands on that book about Muggle motorbikes that
he wouldn’t shut up about??</p>
<p>James
did want to see one of these moving picture things now, based on her
description. Something called a “Western” sounded especially promising.
Lily rambling about something else with a doctor and a phone…box? Did
he hear that right? in it was less exciting, but she had seemed
insistent that it was brilliant.</p>
<p>Also,
they didn’t even talk about him. At all. What was the point of spying
on your best friends hanging out with the girl you had a crush on if
they didn’t gossip about you?!</p>
<p>He
ran through that sentence in his head again, to see if there was
anything creepy about it, and decided there was not. All good.</p>
<p>Anyway. Tonight Remus and Sirius had disappeared together, again, but this time it was to an empty classroom. <em>Much</em> more promising.</p>
<p>And this was how James Potter found himself lurking in the shadows outside of the Arithmancy classroom
at 9:00 at night on a Thursday, when most people were in their Common
Rooms or the Library or anywhere else in the castle that wasn’t dark
and shadowed and lonely . </p>
<p>He did <em>not</em>
question his life choices. They were working out brilliantly, as a
matter of fact. He could hear almost every word and see almost
everything (though they were half-hidden in flickering
shadows—flickering because the only light was Sirius’s wand, and he was
twirling it absentmindedly between his fingers) they were doing.</p>
<p>Sirius
was sitting on the teacher’s desk, legs propped up on a chair in front
of him, bending forward or leaning back as the mood took him. Remus was
standing, leaning on the desk, smiling his faint “I can’t believe I’m
even listening to this but it’s entertaining so I’ll stick around”
smile. James knew it well, even in this half-light that danced around
more erratically than a candle flame in the wind. He wore it around
them a lot, but especially around Sirius.</p>
<p>“I’m
just saying that if you got it somewhere discreet, no one would ever
even see it. Well…mostly no one.” James couldn’t be sure, but Sirius
was probably smirking. Damn! Why didn’t they light a lamp or something?
How was he supposed to analyze their every move like this? He shuffled
a bit closer, peering into the darkness.</p>
<p>“And
if I had to go to hospital? Or see a Healer at all? Which, I’ll remind
you, are things I have to do often enough, even with you lot helping
me.”</p>
<p>“We’ll
enchant it to fade under certain circumstances,” Sirius said. “It could
even be a proximity thing, for when you’re not around us—I heard
someone talking about tattoos that do that recently.” His face
darkened, if that was possible, even further. “I don’t know why. It was
at Grimmauld Place—you know, before I—well.” He stopped, but Remus
nodded—he didn’t need to say it. “And anyway, Regulus shut up the
minute he saw me so—nothing good. But still.”</p>
<p>Remus
huffed a breath out through his nose and leaned back on his elbows a
bit, brushing Sirius’s side just barely. “You don’t think we’re
attached at the hip enough already? We need marks on our bodies that
fade when we’re away from each other?”</p>
<p>Sirius
snorted, dark mood banished instantly. “Well, whatever. Maybe just
Healers, or anyone you don’t want seeing it. Consent is something we
can work into the spell, right? And hey, your hip’s a good place, by
the way.” He grinned sidelong at Remus. “<em>I’d</em> like it, anyway.”</p>
<p>“Would
you really.” Remus sounded unimpressed, but he was smiling. Not a faint
smile, or the secret-laugh smile, but a fond smile.</p>
<p>James had never seen that one.</p>
<p>Which meant it was a smile just for Sirius.</p>
<p>He was suddenly deeply uncomfortable, and wished he was <em>literally anywhere else</em> right now. Why did he think this was a good idea?</p>
<p>Sirius
turned to face Remus now, and he didn’t say anything, but something in
his face must have spoken volumes. Remus dropped his eyes away. “I’m
still not keen on the idea of—well, basically advertising.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about that,” said Sirius. “I know you didn’t like the idea of a paw, even if it’s a dog print—” </p>
<p>Remus
rolled his eyes. “Like I said, advertising. It’s not like most people
would know the difference, and I want to steer them far far away from
canines and moons and such.”</p>
<p>“Right.
No moons, no dogs. But look at the design I had Peter do for me.” He
pulled a piece of folded parchment out of his robes and handed it over.</p>
<p>Whatever was on it, Remus wasn’t immediately on board with it. “A dog howling? You do realize any sort of howling is <em>really</em> out, Padfoot, we’re going for <em>more</em> subtle, not less—”</p>
<p>Sirius took Remus’s hand, and Remus shut up immediately. Oh god, Sirius had <em>taken Remus’s</em> <em>hand</em>, what the hell, this was too much—</p>
<p>“What’s it howling <em>at, </em>though?”
He said, voice very low now. He was tracing something on the back of
Remus’s hand, oh god, what was James’s life, he needed to leave, <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>“I
told you, I’m not putting a full moon anywhere on my body.” This should
have been said much more angrily than the way Remus said it, and he <em>wasn’t moving his hand</em>.</p>
<p>“No
one would have to know it was a moon, if it was just a circle. And we
could even cut it in half—so it’s waning. Flip it sideways, so the
line’s on the bottom and there’s no reason to think it’s anything but a
half circle, whatever you want. You and I would be the only ones that
knew, and if anyone else found out they’d never know what it meant.”</p>
<p>Remus
flipped his hand over, and laced their fingers together. “So you want
the other half of your tattoo on my hip,” he said. “And you want it to
be a moon that Padfoot and Moony will never run under together.”</p>
<p>There was a loaded silence.</p>
<p>“Well,
when you put it like that, it sounds incredibly sappy and a little
sad,” said Sirius after a minute. He should have sounded sarcastic and
flippant.</p>
<p>He didn’t.</p>
<p>He didn’t break eye contact with Remus.</p>
<p>Remus looked like he was going to roll his eyes. He didn’t. He tugged Sirius forward, closing the distance between them.</p>
<p>James didn’t know what happened after that. Nope, he had no idea
whatsoever, he was shutting his eyes and not looking and definitely not
listening to any <em>noises</em> that might have ensued.</p>
<p>It
was only when he opened his eyes and saw Lily Evans, of all people,
standing right there and staring at him, that he realized that
somewhere in the process of flinging his hand over his eyes and
pressing himself against the wall next to the classroom door, the
Invisibility Cloak had fallen off. </p>
<p>Thank god Sirius and Remus were too occupied to notice, and their eyes were probably closed, seriously, thank <em>god</em>. He grabbed the cloak and bundled it up before Lily could see it—luckily it folded up small.</p>
<p>
“Oh hello Lily,” he said as he did this, quietly, and as nonchalantly as he could manage.
</p>
<p>
  “James,”
she said, still staring at him. “Do I even want to know what you’re
during lurking in the hallway outside the Arithmancy classroom right
before curfew, in the dark?”
</p>
<p>
  “Keep
your voice down,” he hissed. When her glare didn’t let up, he rolled
his eyes, grabbed her arm, and pulled her closer to the wall, ignoring
her noise of protest. “I’m spying on Remus and Sirius, okay? And if
they hear us they will kill us so take it from someone who’s been sneaking around Hogwarts for six years, stay here and be quiet.”
</p>
<p>
  “You’re what?” she said, but at least she said it softly. “Why are you—what?!”
</p>
<p>
  “They’re
keeping things from me. And I wanted to see how big of a thing it is,
or whether it’s just a casual small thing that will go away after a
while and never become a big serious lifelong thing.”
</p>
<p>
  There
was a long pause. Lily was squinting at him. “What?” she said again,
finally, like she still wasn’t sure whether to take points away or hear
him out.
</p>
<p>
  “Er…”
James mentally backtracked through everything he had said, and came to
a very hasty conclusion. “I’m actually…I don’t know if I should tell
you. Now that I think about it.”
</p>
<p>
  Now
she was looking at him thoughtfully. “Well, if it’s that kind of
thing,” she said, slowly, as though she was choosing her words very
carefully, “I think maybe you should…well. You should let them keep it
from you. Maybe the thing they’re keeping from you won’t be a big deal
forever but it is a big deal to them right now, and is very personal,
and you should let them tell you in their own time.”
</p>
<p>
  James
didn’t know what affect she thought her words would have on him, but
what actually happened was that waves of relief washed over him like a
freaking rainbow after a storm. Or something. He wasn’t good at poetry,
that was Remus’s thing. “You know about it too? Praise Merlin, they’ve
been driving me mental and I can’t talk to anyone about it, Peter is
about as observant as a stale potato. Who do they think they’re
fooling, anyway?”
</p>
<p>
  “Potatoes don’t go stale,” said Lily, as though that was the point.
</p>
<p>
  “Okay, but seriously, Lily, look at them.” He pulled her into a deep, deep
shadow across from the classroom, so she could see without being seen.
They were done snogging, thank god and Merlin and Dumbledore and
everyone in between, James wasn’t good at religion, but they were still
talking quietly (he caught the words “you’re a fucking idiot,” said
way, way too fondly), and looking at each other. And touching. Remus was standing between Sirius’s legs with his arms on Sirius’s shoulders and he was smiling and Sirius was holding his waist and oh god why.
</p>
<p>
  James
couldn’t read Lily’s face. He hadn’t been allowed to get very close to
her for long enough to learn her expressions, or honestly, paid enough
attention other than to figure out what she looked like when she was
about to hex him so he could run. But when she turned to him, grabbed
him, and pulled him away from the classroom, back into the shadows, he
had a pretty good idea what she was thinking.
</p>
<p>
  “Right?” he said.
</p>
<p>
  She sighed. “I don’t suppose I can convince you this is none of our business?”
</p>
<p>
  He stared. What? They were his best friends, of course it was—what?
</p>
<p>
  “James,”
she said, sighing. “My Prefect rounds are about to start, and you’ll be
out after curfew. I should take points away, but I won’t if you come
back to the Common Room with me, okay? You probably don’t want to see
whatever they’re going to do next anyway.”
</p>
<p>That took a minute to sink in, but when it did he shuddered. “Good lord, you’re right. Okay, I’m coming, let’s get out of here.”</p>
<p>They
didn’t talk on the way back. James was deep in thought, and whatever
Lily was thinking, she didn’t say. He said “good night” to her
distractedly, and went back up to the dormitory, and managed to spend
an entire five minutes there without panicking about the fact that he’d
just had a serious conversation with Lily Evans without her sneering at
him even once, had walked with her back to the Common Room, and she’d <em>let him off without taking points</em>.</p>
<p>When
the panic did hit, he had to lay down on the floor for several minutes,
telling himself to breathe. Peter found him like that, and didn’t
ask—just handed him a scone he’d nicked from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Peter,”
James said, “You are my only true friend. You are a life saver, a
savior of life. Have you been knighted yet? Why haven’t you been
knighted?”</p>
<p>“Dunno,” said Peter, who never quite knew how to respond to James’s dramatics. “You feeling okay?”</p>
<p>“I am in <em>deep distress</em>,” James said. “But you have made it better, my friend.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome? Where are Sirius and Remus?”</p>
<p>James
kicked his traitorous brain before it could provide him with any images
that would have him rocking in the corner for a week. “No idea. None at
all. No…no clue. How are you, Peter? How are things? School going okay?”</p>
<p>Peter
gave him a weird look and then, evidently deciding it wasn’t worth his
time, shrugged. “Actually I need help on my Potions essay? I was going
to ask Remus, but…”</p>
<p>“Capital!”
James cried, seeing salvation and grabbing it with both hands. “Let’s
look at it together! Homework! Just what I need right now!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re okay?”</p>
<p>“I am not, Peter, I really am not. Lily Evans <em>said good night to me</em>.” Yes, focus on that. Focus on that and not the rest of the weirdness of this entire weird evening.</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Peter, light dawning. “Well. I’ll get my notes.”</p>
<p>James very much <em>did not notice</em>
that Sirius and Remus got back to the dorm an hour and a half later,
did not wonder whether they’d stayed in the classroom or gone somewhere
else, and <em>definitely</em> didn’t think about whether they’d continued the tattoo conversation.</p>
<p>He
did feign ignorance when Sirius told him it was done and Remus was
convinced—on the one condition that they never ask him where the tattoo
was, or what it was, for the sake of plausible deniability. James would
just have to pretend not to know, ha ha, what tattoo, Moony doesn’t
have any tattoos, no sir.</p>
<p>So
now he just had to wait for Remus to talk to Lily. Who had actually had
an entire conversation with him. Without trying to flay him alive.</p>
<p>And he had to not freak out in the meantime.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>
<em>Yeah.</em><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>James did <em>not</em>
pass out in shock when Lily Evans came in to breakfast the next morning
and sat down right across from him as though nothing at all unusual was
happening.</p>
<p>He <em>didn’t</em>.</p>
<p>He
did stare at her with his mouth hanging open until she raised an
eyebrow and asked him if he was trying to catch flies that way, at
which point he scrambled to look nonchalant and suave and accidentally
put his elbow in the butter dish.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, he was the epitome of suave. Oh, god.</p>
<p>“I
just—uh. Um.” He rallied, rather impressively, he thought. “I just,
hello, Miss Evans, I wasn’t expecting to see you at this early hour.
Come here often?”</p>
<p>Lily
didn’t even bother to roll her eyes, just picked up a piece of toast,
rescued the butter from his elbow, and started to butter it from the
side that was un-elbowed. “I liked it better when you looked like a
broken frog.”</p>
<p>James
sighed. It was too early for this, anyway. His brain was all scrambled
and he couldn’t manage suave right now. Maybe she would forgive him for
not being his usual excellent self, in time. “Flies are disgusting. I
prefer to fill my mouth with eggs,” he said, and did so. Then winced,
because Sirius would have made a truly horrific joke at that, and he
would have deserved it.</p>
<p>Lily
just raised an eyebrow. “If you say so,” she said, taking a bite of
toast. God, she could even eat toast at arse o’clock in the morning and
look beautiful doing it. It was so, so, <em>so </em>unfair. Everything about Lily Evan’s existence was oppression.</p>
<p>Luckily,
before he could say that out loud and end up hexed for his trouble, she
spoke first. “Where is your usual herd this morning? And come to think
of it, what are you even doing up this early?”</p>
<p>“Went
to bed early,” James admitted. “They were acting like nothing had
happened, I couldn’t look them in the face. And if I had to help Peter
with Potions for any longer my brain was going to turn to goo and leak
out all over the floor and McGonagall would give me detention for the
rest of my life for getting brain goo all over the dormitory.”</p>
<p>“Send
him to me, I’ll help him,” Lily said, as though it was nothing, which
it was, because she was some kind of Potions genius and she and
Snivellus had been in friendly competition that made his skin crawl for
five years, except now it was unfriendly because they weren’t speaking
for reasons he wasn’t quite sure of, not that he was stalking her and
her relationships, because he wasn’t. Anyway.</p>
<p>“He’s
terrified of you,” James informed her, helping himself to some toast
now, and trying very hard not to bring up Snape. “But if I give you his
essay and we don’t tell him who looked over it until afterwards, he
might get over the shock.”</p>
<p>“A
good plan,” she said, almost—he couldn’t believe it—actually smiling.
Oh god, he was lightheaded. Getting an appropriate amount of sleep and
waking up early had made him lightheaded and he was hallucinating, he
was never doing this again.</p>
<p>“I
am good at those,” he said, for lack of anything better to say. They
were still mostly alone in the Great Hall, and the emptiness was a
sincere blessing, because no one else could witness this disaster of a
conversation, but he also deeply wished there was something to distract
him from it. A food fight, or a massive firebomb. Or <em>something</em>.
A dance party! Why hadn’t they had a dance party in the Great Hall yet?
Why did dance parties never break out when you desperately needed them?</p>
<p>“Mm,” she said. “What was that about not being able to look at your friends?”</p>
<p>“You mean the extremely awkward giant elephant in the room that they don’t know I can see?”</p>
<p>Lily just looked at him.</p>
<p>“Uh…it’s
very weird? I don’t know what you’re asking? Please tell me what you’re
asking, there’s a reason Peter is terrified of you, oh god, what did I
do—”</p>
<p>“Dear
lord,” she said, except she said it like she was fighting back a laugh,
so maybe it wasn’t that bad? “Calm down, Potter, I’m just wondering
what’s wrong. Is it really that strange?”</p>
<p>Something
in her voice made him look at her a little more closely, and when he
thought he understood he almost recoiled in horror. “What, because—?
Because they’re both blokes? What?! No! No, they’re my <em>friends, </em>what
do I care who they—I mean, Sirius’ family is the sort to throw a fit
over that, at least give me credit for being better than <em>that</em>.”</p>
<p>“Oh
well, at the very least,” said Lily. She sounded like she was laughing
at him again, which was an improvement at least over her vague
disapproval.</p>
<p>In
order to avoid dwelling on this, James plowed on ahead. “It’s
just—shit, I think, I think it might be serious? And Sirius is never
serious, don’t say he’s only ever serious about being Sirius, see, I do
it better.” He was babbling, but that was preferable to facing Lily’s
disapproving eyebrow in silence, so he forged on ahead. </p>
<p>“He’s always Sirius about things but he’s never <em>serious</em>
about anything, and Remus—Remus! What is Remus doing? I’ll have to flay
Sirius alive if he hurts him, seriously, which is weird because he’s my
best friend, but <em>if he does anything to Remus</em>—and holy crap this is is a big serious deal and they haven’t even told me yet! Lily! What am I supposed to do!!”</p>
<p>Lily squinted at him. “Are you capable of not making that joke? I’m just curious.”</p>
<p>“In all seriousness, I very seriously am not,” said James.</p>
<p>She
actually snickered. She was trying not to, but she did. James felt like
his chest was filling up with sunshine, and he was going to float off
into the atmosphere—okay, maybe metaphors weren’t a good idea this
early in the morning. But somewhere in this diatribe he had forgotten
that he was talking to <em>Lily freaking Evans</em>,
and when he remembered again he had to think over everything he’d just
said, and. And. Oh god. What had he been rambling about? Had he really
made the serious Sirius joke that many times? What was he thinking, of
course he had, but still. He was on the verge of disappearing into a
puff of shame, but she didn’t seem to notice his mortification? She was
still smiling? This whole morning was definitely a fever dream, what
the hell.</p>
<p>“Sirius
takes his family very seriously,” Lily said, somehow with a straight
face. “At least in that he’s also very serious about not being like
them. And he likes motorbikes. And Muggle music.”</p>
<p>“That’s <em>true</em>,
he got his hands on a Lead Blimp record and—why are you laughing. Lily,
what did I say. You have to tell me, I’ll never learn otherwise, come <em>on</em>.”</p>
<p>“Led
Zeppelin,” she said through her wheezing. “Spelled L-E-D—oh god, give
me a minute.” When she was finished wiping her eyes, she said “Well,
I’m glad to know he liked it anyway.”</p>
<p>People
were filtering into the Great Hall now, which was a fact James was
trying very hard to ignore, because one of the people coming in was
Lucius Malfoy, and he was sneering at both of them. Apparently having
fun wasn’t allowed around Slytherins—but luckily he didn’t say
anything, and Lily didn’t notice, so James subtly shifted his wand into
his hand under the table, smiled at Lily, and tried to stay casual.</p>
<p>“Oh
yeah, he’s been singing ‘Black Dog’ nonstop for months now,” he said.
“We can’t get a record player to work at Hogwarts so we have to put up
with his godawful voice and it’s driving me mental and he’s <em>not funny</em> and I—wait.” Lily’s words had caught up with his brain. “You gave him that record?”</p>
<p>“Why is him singing Black Dog not funny?”</p>
<p>“Dog
star, last name Black? Least clever joke ever? And they tell me you’re
smart,” said James quickly, before he blurted out an answer that began
with “so, we became illegal Animaguses a year ago” and end with a term
in Azkaban. “Anyway, I asked first.” </p>
<p>It was the best timing ever or the worst—because yes, another person came in the room, of <em>course</em> he did. Nothing could ever be perfect, could it?</p>
<p>Snape was walking right past them, and he wasn’t just sneering. There was a dark look on his face, and <em>god</em>,
how dare he look at Lily like that. James’s fingers itched to hex him,
and he would’ve done it, right then, except Lily got there first.</p>
<p>She didn’t hex him. She didn’t even say anything. She just <em>looked</em> at Snivellus, with a look James knew all too well, the one that could shrivel a man’s balls if he dared to get too close.</p>
<p>James relaxed his grip on his wand. He didn’t want to be caught with it.</p>
<p>Snape
turned his glare on James, briefly, but he looked down quickly at his
food, and shoved way too much in his mouth, and started coughing.</p>
<p>This
was extremely awkward, but far less awkward than the glaring had been.
Snape broke his gaze with a sneer and swept away, while Lily, with
alarm, drew her wand and said, “<em>Anapneo</em>,” effectively dislodging the food and the unpleasant aura of Slytherin.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said James, when he was done wiping his eyes. “Er—”</p>
<p>“Don’t,” said Lily. Her face was stormy now, which was a pity. He’d liked making her laugh, even if it had been at his expense.</p>
<p>“He’s filth,” James said, for lack of anything better to say.</p>
<p>“He <em>isn’t</em>,”
Lily snapped, and at the look on his face, rolled her eyes, sighing.
“Don’t, James. You can’t—you won’t get anywhere if you assume anyone
who doesn’t like you is trash.”</p>
<p>“He <em>is</em>
a prick, though,” James argued. “It’s not just about me—no, don’t say
it. Who is he to say the way you were born makes you better than other
people? That kind of person <em>is</em> trash, no matter who they like or don’t like.”</p>
<p>Lily just looked at him. “Don’t you think the same thing about Muggles versus wizards?”</p>
<p>It
was his turn to stare. But he couldn’t deny it, she’d caught him saying
almost exactly that just yesterday. “I—didn’t mean it like that,” he
said, finally, without much heat.</p>
<p>“No,” said Lily. “I know. But you still think it. You have a lot to unlearn, you Purebloods.”</p>
<p>“There are still things I would never do,” he said, and swallowed, hard. “Words—words I would never say.”</p>
<p>“Congratulations,” she said drily. “You’ve mastered basic human decency. Would you like a medal for it?” She sighed again.
“Look, you mean well, and that means a lot, but—tell me you wouldn’t do
magic in front of a Muggle and then Obliviate them just because they
were nearby. You’d take away their memory, just like that, because you
can and they would never know.”</p>
<p>“Well—yes, Muggles can’t know about wizards, we have to protect ourselves—”</p>
<p>“We can do <em>magic</em>!
Protect ourselves from what? And even if you did have something to fear
from them, what about helping them? Would you ever use your magic to
heal Muggle wounds, save Muggle lives? Or is it only for wizards and no
one else?”</p>
<p>“It would violate the Statute of Secrecy…”</p>
<p>“Oh, <em>laws</em>,” said Lily. “Yes, you’ve always cared about following rules, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>Something
about her voice, maybe there was an edge to it—made James stop. He sat
back, looking at her, but also thinking. “I don’t think they’re
lesser,” he said after a minute.</p>
<p>“No, you just act like they are.”</p>
<p>“How do I stop?” said James, genuinely curious.</p>
<p>She blinked, as though shocked. “You’re not taking the piss, are you? Trying to placate me?”</p>
<p>“No,” said James. “I mean it. How do I stop?”</p>
<p>“Um,” said Lily, who apparently was not prepared for this turn in the conversation.</p>
<p>Strange.</p>
<p>“Did I put you on the spot?” said James. “Has no one asked you this before?”</p>
<p>“Usually they’re telling me they <em>know</em>, and to stop harping on about it already,” Lily admitted.</p>
<p>“Hmmm,”
said James, thinking about the startled look on her face and her tight,
well-rehearsed words. “So…listening. Listening is good?"</p>
<p>She
actually smiled. “Shockingly,” she said. “Also maybe start thinking
about Muggles like they’re real people. And how to treat them that way.
The way you’d treat wizards.”</p>
<p>“Wizards that aren’t Snape, you mean,” said James.</p>
<p>“Right,”
she said. “And, uh—I’m not saying you shouldn’t be upset about—words.
Things that they do. It makes me angry too, you know.”</p>
<p>“Is <em>that</em> why you quit talking to each other? Thank god, because—”</p>
<p>“It’s
none of your business,” Lily snapped. “But quit acting like you have
the moral high ground when some things you do are bad in their own way.”</p>
<p>“But Lily,” he said, because this conversation was getting too serious and he had his dignity, dammit, “my sh—farts <em>do</em> smell like roses, and everything I do <em>is</em> perfect.”</p>
<p>She threw a roll at him, which he ducked, and she actually <em>laughed</em>. “I thought you were supposed to be a good Chaser,” she said.</p>
<p>“I don’t catch <em>Bludgers</em>,” said James, with dignity.</p>
<p>“The House Elves would be hurt,” said Lily. “Talking about their cooking that way.”</p>
<p>“Don’t
tell them,” James retorted, then changed the subject quickly, before he
could say something stupid about her eye-crinkles when she laughed.
“But, listen, this is important, so you’d best be honest with me,
Evans.”</p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow, so he rushed on before she could say something scathing.</p>
<p>“How did you conspire to give Sirius Muggle music behind my back?”</p>
<p>Lily
rolled her eyes, but the mood had lightened considerably. “Yes, I
talked to your friend when you weren’t there, try to recover.”</p>
<p>“No, I—what? I know that part, what are you talking about?” He did <em>not</em>
choose to disclose that he had found it out by spying on them in the
Common Room. “I just meant, do you know where we could go to get more?
Do you maybe have any ideas on how to get a record player to work at
Hogwarts? Do you like music? What kind of music do you like? Do you—”</p>
<p>“James!”
Lily said, but she was laughing again. “All right, I give in, but one
at a time. Yes, I know a few good record stores in London, I can tell
you the names. If you’re anything like Sirius you won’t like my music,
he’s all KISS and Led Zeppelin and I’m more of a Simon and Garfunkel
kind of—what am I saying, you don’t know what these words mean.”</p>
<p>“I’m taking notes,” James said, then thought about it. “…D’you have a quill so I can take notes?”</p>
<p>“I have a pen,” Lily said, producing a stick that was definitely not feathered, and he saw no sign of an ink bottle.</p>
<p>“Er…”</p>
<p>She sighed. Heavily. “It’s like a quill, but for Muggles, and it’s better. Never mind, I’ll write it down for you.”</p>
<p>“What?
No, I want to learn, after all there are so many things Muggles have
that we don’t. Teach me the ways of this pen technology.”</p>
<p>“Later,”
said Lily. “Breakfast is almost over, and you lot always come in at the
last minute. Your friends will drag you away before you can properly
master the technique.”</p>
<p>James brain froze to a screeching halt, <em>again</em>,
unable to decide what to panic about first: the fact that she’d
observed him and his eating habits, or the fact that there was a
mischievous twinkle in her eye, like she was teasing him. <em>Teasing him</em>.</p>
<p>“Oh god,” he said out loud, before he could stop it.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Er—nothing. Write for me the ways of your music with your mystic pen,” James managed.</p>
<p>“Yes.
And record shops. Actually the best one is right by the tattoo parlor I
go to,” she said, casually. James wasn’t sure how much more of this he
could take. His heart was going to give out.</p>
<p>“That’s
right,” he said, trying not to sound strangled, “you mentioned
something about that yesterday. Uh—I didn’t—I didn’t know you had a
tattoo? Or an artist for it?”</p>
<p>“Two,”
she said, absentmindedly, scribbling away on a piece of spare
parchment. “I have two tattoos. My artist is good—his name is Keith,
tell him I sent you and he <em>might</em>
give you a deal—you have to be careful about where you go but I can
vouch for him.” She looked up at his astonished face. “What? You’re
thinking about getting a tattoo, right? And trying to decide between a
Muggle and wizarding one, but you can get the Muggle one sooner without
having to prove your age. Because magic against helpless Muggles is so
easy. Am I right?”</p>
<p>James stared. He couldn’t help it. </p>
<p>He did, however, have a reputation to protect. And it was…a <em>good</em>
reputation? He wasn’t quite sure how to do that, but he had to try.
“What, no, we weren’t going to Confund anyone, I was going to make an
ID, actually.”</p>
<p>“Is that so,” she said, entirely unconvinced. </p>
<p>“Well, isn’t that what you did?”</p>
<p>She raised both eyebrows at him. “I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re seventeen too, and you have to be eighteen. You changed the year on your ID, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>She
looked down at her parchment again, but there was a smile pulling at
her lips. “That’s for me to know and you to wonder about,” she said,
with a great deal of dignity for someone who was a stone cold <em>liar</em>. “I am literally just trying to keep you from getting hepatitis. That would be awkward to explain to a Healer.”</p>
<p>“Please tell me where your tattoos are,” he said.</p>
<p>“Nope,” she said. “I will loan you my ID so you can copy it, though. If you ask nicely.”</p>
<p>James was going to have heart failure. “Yes, please.”</p>
<p>“Also, to your last question, you know as well as I do that modifying Muggle devices with magic is illegal,” Lily said.</p>
<p>James
looked at her. Something about the way she said that sounded exactly
like Remus when he was telling Sirius something wasn’t allowed at
Hogwarts.</p>
<p>She grinned. He grinned back; he’d guessed right. “I won’t tell anyone,” he promised.</p>
<p>“I’ll
show you, then,” she said, writing something else down. “I’m writing
down the brand you should get, I don’t know for a fact that the spell
will work on any others.”</p>
<p>“Oh,
good,” James said. “I have an idea, and I need Muggle music for it.” He
stopped. “You know what, pretend I didn’t say that. I just want it to
get Sirius to shut up. Yes. That’s it.”</p>
<p>Lily’s
face was unimpressed now, which was a real shame because he’d liked her
smug smile. “Is the idea you didn’t have going to hurt or humiliate
someone?”</p>
<p>“What?
No!” He thought for a minute. It wasn’t fully formed yet, just an
inkling, but he didn’t think he was lying. “No. Definitely not. And if
it was, I will change it. I will have Remus evaluate it and not let
Sirius change anything.”</p>
<p>She
looked at him for a long moment, assessing. “All right,” she said, and
handed him the paper. “Also, I’m going to assume you’re going to do
this during Easter break and not do something idiotic like sneak out of
Hogwarts and get a tattoo.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said James. “Yes, we’re definitely going to wait that long.”</p>
<p>Lily
sighed. “Are you really this bad of a liar? I’m a little disappointed,
considering how much you seem to escape detentions. I wouldn’t think
the professors would fall for it.”</p>
<p>“It’s
literally just you,” he said, and winced, because yet again he’d spoken
before thinking. Oh, well—in for a Knut, as they said. “I blurt out
things without meaning to. You’re terrifying. And smart. And funny and
talented and I want to do everything better because you make me realize
that’s a thing that is possible. It’s amazing. We’re all in awe of you,
Sirius begged me to go out with you, Lily, please stop me from saying
these things, I can’t stop and you’re going to hex me and hate me even
more than you already do.”</p>
<p>She
laughed, then actually patted him on the hand. “I only hate you a
little,” she said. “And honestly I’d let you keep going, but you’re in
luck.” She nodded towards the doors, where people were finally entering
in large groups, including his friends—and a couple of hers.</p>
<p>“Right,” James said. “Well, er—thanks.”</p>
<p>“Any
time,” Lily said. She smiled, then got up. She was about to join her
friends when she turned to look at him one more time “Oh, and James?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be drunk when you do it,” she said.</p>
<p>“Uh—”</p>
<p>“Promise,” she said, and her gaze was so fierce that James found himself nodding.</p>
<p>She nodded back, once. And then was gone.</p>
<p>James put his head on the table, and pretended not to notice when Sirius sat down next to him, jostling far too much.</p>
<p>“I see you’re not covered in boils,” said Remus, sitting down across from them.</p>
<p>“No,” said James to the tablecloth. “Someone please pinch me, I think I am hallucinating.”</p>
<p>“That’s for dreams, not hallucinations,” said Peter.</p>
<p>Sirius didn’t say anything, just grabbed a hunk of James’s arm and squeezed. With his nails.</p>
<p>“Ow! Jesus! Okay, I’m awake—good lord, Padfoot, do you sharpen those!”</p>
<p>Sirius shrugged. “You looked happy, at least. If a bit delirious.”</p>
<p>James
bit his lip, trying desperately to aim for calm and collected, before
giving up. “I have made progress,” he said, as grandly as he could
manage. “And Moony, <em>you’re welcome.</em>”</p>
<p>Remus looked up from his plate nervously. “…What?”</p>
<p>“I saved you some work. And got us an address,” he said, laying out the parchment in front of him, “to Lily’s tattoo parlor.”</p>
<p>There was an appropriate hushed silence at these words, before Sirius, of course, ruined it.</p>
<p>“Did you get the pen she used to write that? I’m out of them again, and I need more, it makes Snivellus’s face do the <em>best</em> disgusted gymnastics when I use them in class.”</p>
<p>“I have some,” said Remus, “I’ll loan you a couple. Also you should try out the notebooks, they’re much better than parchment.”</p>
<p>“Hell
yes,” said Sirius. “I want to see if I can get Narcissa to have a
coronary.” He paused. “Oh and nice job, Prongs, very neatly done. This
weekend, do you think?”</p>
<p>James sighed. His friends were all terrible.</p>
<p>“Next,” he said. “I have Quidditch.” </p>
<p>At least it was settled.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>Muggle tattoos, it turned out, <em>hurt like a motherfucker</em>. And James couldn’t even find it in him to complain, because the bloke doing the work was tattoo’d within an inch of his life, <em>probably literally</em>, because oh right, no anastasia, or whatever Lily had called it.</p>
<p>
  Jesus Merlin Dumbledore.
</p>
<p>Also there was a speculative gleam in Sirius’s eyes that…well, it didn’t really worry <em>him</em>. But Remus was pretending to be annoyed. James had a feeling this would not be Sirius’s last time doing this, although he <em>very much was not thinking</em> about any kind of matching tattoo scenarios.</p>
<p>Nope.
Not thinking about it. After all, it was already happening, and they
didn’t need his help thinking of sappier things they could do.</p>
<p>The
worst part was that Remus had been pretty unaffected by the whole
experience. His had been the quickest tattoo, and James had to pretend
he didn’t know where it was, but wasn’t the hip supposed to be pretty
painful? And yet he walked out like nothing was wrong, and shrugged at
James’s slightly incredulous look.</p>
<p>“High pain tolerance,” he said.</p>
<p>“Jesus fuck,” said James, with feeling, which made Remus actually quirk a smile.</p>
<p>“I
keep telling him he’s wasted on sweater vests and tea,” said Sirius
from where he was sitting backwards in a chair so as not to put any
pressure on his presumably very sore shoulder. “He can drink us all
under the table, <em>and</em> walks off pain. He’s more hardcore than any of us.” </p>
<p>James
tried very hard not to hear the proud and slightly possessive note in
Sirius’s voice when he said that. Admittedly, was made easier by the
needle drilling into his forearm. It was a ready-made distraction.</p>
<p>“Did he at least yell,” he said to the tattoo artist, who smirked. “Or grit his teeth, or <em>something</em>.”</p>
<p>“Not a sound,” he said. “Quietest of all you lot, really.”</p>
<p>“Dammit,” said James.</p>
<p>Sirius was smirking. “Prongs, yours is the most painless one. Even Wormtail’s was worse than yours.”</p>
<p>“Right on the bone,” said Peter proudly. “<em>I</em> definitely yelled. At least, I probably did.”</p>
<p>“Right,”
said Sirius. To most people it would have sounded neutral, but James
could hear the caustic edge he got when Peter was being…well, Peter.
“You don’t really remember.”</p>
<p>They
had debated over whether to bring Peter along, Peter arguing heavily in
favor of staying at Hogwarts, but had finally agreed when they decided
that it would be easiest for him to sneak into Diagon Alley, change
money, and then sneak out, without being noticed.</p>
<p>They could have Confunded the tattoo artist—<em>Keith</em>,
James thought, because he’d been thinking over the whole “be a better
person that isn’t prejudiced and shitty” initiative, and thought that
remembering people’s names was a good beginning—to avoid paying, but
every time James thought about it, he pictured Lily’s face if she found
out, and a chill ran down his spine that was hard to ignore. He’d
finally talked Sirius around by convincing him it was the more
dangerous and risky option.</p>
<p>And <em>then</em> he’d talked Peter around by telling him this was Marauders bonding and they couldn’t just leave him out, and they <em>needed</em> him.</p>
<p>Sometimes,
James thought, with a needle drilling into his arm, Sirius and Remus
making unsubtle-yet-discreet heart eyes at each other, and Peter
looking nervously at the window every time someone walked past outside,
it was hard being him.</p>
<p>“I haven’t yelled,” he said, trying very hard not to cringe, and to hide the fact that he was trying not to.</p>
<p>“We’re all very proud of you,” said Remus. He was kind enough not to comment on the faces James was making.</p>
<p>“I
thought you didn’t think you could convince Lily to like you,” James
said, to Sirius. Now seemed like the appropriate time to bring this up.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You said I’d have more luck than you,” James reminded him patiently. “But you exchanged music, and pens. You <em>are</em> friends.”</p>
<p>“Is exchanging pens what the kids are calling it these days?” murmured Keith, without lifting his eyes from his work.</p>
<p>Sirius
snorted. “Only if it’s what the kids call forgetting your quuuuuuuuu—”
he winced, probably because Remus kicked him, “—pen. Forgetting your <em>pen</em>, and begging the nearest redhead for a new one because your <em>worthless friends</em> only brought one to class—”</p>
<p>“I am not your personal supplies distributor,” said Remus on cue.</p>
<p>“—and she takes pity on you and teaches you the ways of the ballpoint.”</p>
<p>“Really?”
said Keith, now actually looking up for the first time. “You’ve never
used a ballpoint pen before? Did you live under a rock before that,
mate?”</p>
<p>James
glared, but Remus—thank heaven for Remus—didn’t bat an eyelash. “A
mansion, actually,” he said. “His family’s old-fashioned. Only ever
used fountain pens and drank Earl Gray and wiped his bum with silk
before he met us, the poor bastard.”</p>
<p>“You <em>love</em> Earl Gray,” said Sirius, though he didn’t sound offended.</p>
<p>Remus
grinned at him, the grin that had teeth in it and reminded them all of
the wolf a bit too strongly, though no one would ever tell him that. “I
didn’t say any of that was <em>bad</em>,” he said, innocent tone in utter juxtaposition with his expression.</p>
<p>Oh,
god. James ground his teeth harder and hoped to all the stars in the
sky that Keith the tattoo artist was open-minded, because Sirius had
the most smitten expression he’d ever seen in his life, and he’d seen
his own face when thinking about Lily Evans.</p>
<p>“Huh,” said Keith. “Never heard that one before. Guess it takes all sorts.”</p>
<p>“They’re a bit close-minded,” said James meaningfully.</p>
<p>“Religious?”</p>
<p>“Very,” said James before Sirius could say anything to ruin it.</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Keith, a bit too understandingly. “Funny how those are the ones that never take a vow of poverty, innit?”</p>
<p>“My family would like <em>other</em> people to take vows of poverty,” said Sirius, a shade bitterly. “Forcibly, if necessary.”</p>
<p>“He was disowned,” Peter told Keith. “Banged the door closed and ran away, heeeeeexe—er. <em>Hit</em> his hoooouse—keeper on the way out, the whole thing.”</p>
<p>“The house <em>keeper</em> deserved it,” James said hastily. “Used to spy on him for his parents.”</p>
<p>“Also
he’s a drama queen,” said Remus, and his grin only got wider when
Sirius kicked him and then winced because kicking required more
shoulder muscles than he’d previously realized.</p>
<p>“Had
a couple of blokes in here the other day, got kicked out for the same
reason,” said Keith. “Well, it may take all sorts, but there are a few
we could do without, if you take my meaning.”</p>
<p>Sirius
looked confused, and opened his mouth to say something, before James
glared at him, the “don’t you dare say a word you’ll blow our cover
also <em>you’re not fooling anyone</em>” glare that he hoped would will him and Remus into silence. “Couldn’t agree more,” he said out loud, and <em>loudly</em>, so that Sirius would get the point.</p>
<p>“Well, Lily Evans may hate you, but you’re welcome here,” said Keith, with a faint grin.</p>
<p>“Which
brings me back to my point, thank you Keith,” said James. He really
liked Keith, even though Keith was still digging into his arm with a
needle. “Since when are you two mates?” </p>
<p>Remus
and Sirius exchanged a glance they probably thought he didn’t
understand. “She likes Remus,” Sirius said. “I tag along sometimes.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s really only you she hates now, Prongs,” said Peter thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Thanks
ever so for that, Pete,” said James, gritting his teeth and trying to
keep holding still even though he desperately wanted to give a
two-fingered salute.</p>
<p>“No, I mean she used to hate Sirius. But she’s warmed up to him.”</p>
<p>“For some reason,” said James.</p>
<p>Sirius gave him a wounded look. “I would never! Anyway, I told you I’ve sworn off women, mate.”</p>
<p>Keith snorted, a snort that James <em>knew</em>
meant “I bet you have,” and Remus looked faintly alarmed. “Yes, yes,
they can’t handle you and your perfection, we all know, no one cares,”
James said.</p>
<p>“None of them will put up with him anymore,” Remus told Keith.</p>
<p>“I’m
an acquired taste,” Sirius said, his haughtiest voice. “And I’ll grow
on you. Like a fungus.” He nudged Remus’s foot. “Grew on you, anyway.”</p>
<p>James
squinted at them, wondering whether they were playing it up on purpose
for Keith’s benefit, or if they still thought they were being subtle.</p>
<p>“You got your metaphors confused,” Remus said.</p>
<p>“Did I?” said Sirius. “Or did I <em>mean to do that</em>?”</p>
<p>“You’re blowing my mind,” Remus said dryly.</p>
<p>Holy
hell, this was how they flirted, James realized, in a flood of dawning
horror. This was how they flirted, and they’d been flirting ever since
they met each other. <em>Holy hell</em>.
He looked at their faces again—Remus’s was perfectly blank. Sirius was
smiling faintly, but was otherwise the picture of innocence.</p>
<p>Well, shit.</p>
<p>James understood what was going on now, at least.</p>
<p>And they were not going to get away with it.</p>
<p>Before
he could open his mouth to say something he’d probably regret later, he
realized abruptly that the pain in his arm had changed, and it still
hurt like a motherfucker but at least there was no needle in it
anymore—and Keith announced that he was done. James submitted to
bandaging his arm and got up in relief.</p>
<p>Keith
grinned cheerfully at Sirius as they wrapped up and paid, and gave
Remus a big wink when telling him to look after his friends and make
sure they took care of themselves. James found himself tipping more
than he meant to, and shook his head when Keith tried to protest. “You
put up with us, mate, you could’ve charged us double and I’d pay it.”</p>
<p>“How do you know I didn’t?” Keith had said, and “Come back when you’re ready for your next one.”</p>
<p>James
had walked out grinning, thinking that this “making friends with
Muggles” thing wasn’t so bad, and resisted the urge to smack Sirius on
the back. Instead he shoved him on the non-tattooed shoulder, in the
direction of the record store.</p>
<p>The only real disappointing part of the whole thing was that he had to be bandaged up for a while. James had <em>plans</em> for this tattoo, and covering it up even for a day or so seemed criminal.</p>
<p>Also, Keith had just grinned and said “I never ink and tell, mate” when he’d asked where Lily’s tattoos were.</p>
<p>Also, his arm hurt.</p>
<p>Okay, so there were a few downsides to this.</p>
<p>But
on the other hand. On the brilliant, shining other hand—the record shop
had been an incredible success, though he and Remus had to tear Sirius
out of it, and they now had something called a Beatles White Album, as
well as an Abbey Road, a Let it Be, and a stack of something called
“singles,” which the shopkeeper had pushed on them when they’d
expressed interest. And Sirius had more of his Lead Blimps—James was
never going to let on that he knew their real name, the look on
Sirius’s face when he mucked it up was too good—and they’d picked up
something called A Night at the Opera, after more advice from Phil, the
record man.</p>
<p>Plus
some things from Lily’s list. It had been a lot of money, but James
thought that when he could prove to her that he knew what a Garfunkel
was, it would be worth it.</p>
<p>On
Lily’s advice, they’d also picked out a turntable, though James was
making Peter carry that bag—he was the only one who wouldn’t be in
extreme pain just from having to lift it. Except Remus, but he’d been
in a deep, quiet conversation with Sirius when the question came up,
and was smiling faintly—just around the eyes—and James had just…handed
it to Peter.</p>
<p>He was going to <em>have</em>
to tell the two of them that he knew about them. He was fairly sure
they were betting on how long it would take him to figure out, after
their little display in the tattoo parlor.</p>
<p>The <em>real</em> question was how to make sure Remus won.</p>
<p>That
one kept him occupied all the way back to Hogwarts. Later he was just
glad that Sirius and Remus didn’t notice his silence, and if Peter did,
he didn’t say anything.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>Lily Evans was in his room.</p>
<p>Lily Evans was <em>in his room</em>.</p>
<p>
  Lily Evans was in his room and it wasn’t anything he’d ever imagined.
</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” James said, “I just need to go in the loo and hyperventilate.”</p>
<p>He
stood up, actually stood up without his legs going out, but Remus
pulled him back down without looking away from the record player that
was gutted and laying out all over the floor.</p>
<p>“Ow! Fuck, Moony, that hurt!” he said, landing awkwardly on the rug.</p>
<p>“Shut up,” said Sirius. “We need you. Hyperventilate later.”</p>
<p>“Hold
this,” said Lily, passing him an unidentifiable part, then took her
wand, which was lit up at the tip, out of her hair, and shined the
light into the body of the turntable. “I think that’s the last one. You
understand what you need to do?”</p>
<p>James nodded, mouth completely dry. There was grease all over her hands and a smudge across her cheek. He was lightheaded.</p>
<p>“Focus,” Sirius said, nudging him. “You bollocks this up and it’s over, no second chances.”</p>
<p>“Remus, can you do the light?” said Lily. “I’ll get to work on the Charms part.”</p>
<p>James
swallowed once, twice, then set the piece down on the ground. Lily had
explained to him how they needed to modify the machine to draw from a
magical power source instead of electricity—apparently this involved
taking the entire thing apart and enchanting certain parts of it, and
she didn’t trust them to do it without her supervision. </p>
<p>She’d agreed to do it even after she’d seen his bandaged arm, realized they’d <em>definitely</em> snuck out of Hogwarts illegally to get tattooed, and shaken her head in disapproval at him. </p>
<p>She hadn’t really yelled though. Just said “you’d better not forget to put the ointment on that,” and walked away.</p>
<p>James would never understand her.</p>
<p>He could follow her instructions, though. This was <em>important</em>. So he pushed up his sleeves. And focused.</p>
<p>Lily,
because she had sense, waited until he was done to make comments. And
she was putting the turntable back together when she did, not even
looking at him.</p>
<p>“A deer?” she said, screwing pieces back together that she’d pronounced acceptable.</p>
<p>“What?” said James, then looked at his arm. “Oh. Uh. I’ll have you know it’s a <em>stag</em>,” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh god,” said Remus. “You got him started.”</p>
<p>“Do you know why?” he said, ignoring Remus, as well as Sirius, who already had his hands over his face and was groaning.</p>
<p>Lily
glanced at him, then back at the record player. There was something odd
about the look her face, though he couldn’t pin down what it was. “I’m
going to regret this, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>“<em>Yes</em>,” said Remus, Sirius, and Peter together. But she still asked.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because every time you turn me down for a date, I have to <em>go stag</em>,” said James, grinning widely.</p>
<p>Lily pressed her thumb to her temple. “Yep, I regret it.”</p>
<p>“You don’t like forest creatures?” said James. “That’s a shame, Lily, because they’re so <em>deer</em> to me.”</p>
<p>“Please let me make him stop,” said Sirius to Lily. “I can do it, I’ve been practicing my <em>Silencio’s</em> ever since he started doing this.”</p>
<p>“But Sirius,” said James with a straight face. “I’m so <em>fawn’d</em> of this tattoo! Why won’t you let me express myself?”</p>
<p>“I can even kill him and you’ll never find the body,” said Sirius. “My family has connections, it’s true.”</p>
<p>“Your family disowned you,” said James. “You just weren’t very <em>deer</em> to them.”</p>
<p>“You used that one already,” said Peter, but James ignored him.</p>
<p>“What do you call a deer with no eyes?” he said instead.</p>
<p>“<em>Don’t</em> ask,” said Remus.</p>
<p>Lily was on his side, though. He <em>knew</em> she was, even though she still wasn’t looking at him. She was smirking. “What?” she said, without batting an eyelash.</p>
<p>“Remus is right, you shouldn’t ask. Because I have <em>no-i-deer</em>.” </p>
<p>She burst out laughing. She actually burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Everyone stared.</p>
<p>“Dear god, you’re made for each other,” said Sirius in disgust.</p>
<p>“You mean <em>deer</em> god,” said Peter, unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Lily just grinned. Without looking up from the record player, she pulled up the leg of her jeans to expose her calf.</p>
<p>Where there was a tattoo of a deer. A female deer.</p>
<p>“It’s funny, doe,” she said.</p>
<p>Four jaws dropped. </p>
<p>James,
to his own shock, recovered first. “Lily!” he exclaimed, before he
could think twice about what he was going to say. “Don’t you see! This
completely <em>bucks</em> the notion that we’re not meant to be!”</p>
<p>“One
day they’ll tell tails of this, I know,” said Lily dryly. She was
screwing something together, and it looked like she was almost done.</p>
<p>“I hate you both,” said Sirius. “I really do. Please someone stop them. Moony, let me stop them.”</p>
<p>“Prongs,” Lily said, ignoring them. “Like the antlers. Does this have something to do with that?”</p>
<p>The
Marauders all fell silent, and tried not to look at each other or make
any sign that they were deeply uncomfortable, which was probably a huge
indicator that they were, in fact, uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Er,”
said James. “Yes. But I can’t tell you what, it’s secret Marauder
business, very hush-hush, need to know, confidential. You understand.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” she said. “I actually don’t want to know, come to think of it.”</p>
<p>“What about you?” he said, unable to help himself. “Why a deer?”</p>
<p>She
looked at him this time, and smiled. “Can’t tell you. Very secret Lily
Evans business. You understand. Here, someone pick out a record and
let’s see if this thing works.”</p>
<p>It
did work. James thought that Lily laughing at Sirius’s enthusiastic
headbanging to something called a “Bohemian Rhapsody” was one of the
best things that had ever happened to him, except for the fact that he
and Lily Evans completely coincidentally had <em>corresponding tattoos</em>.</p>
<p>Also, the song was perfect for what he had in mind. They had work to do.</p>
<p>But first, he really did have to hyperventilate in the bathroom for a while.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>Okay, so it turned out suits of armor were more difficult to steal from the Hogwarts hallways than one might think.</p>
<p>Typically,
moving them into the Great Hall for James’s plan had not been his
idea—that had been all Sirius. And Remus, of course, had been the one
to work out how to do it, after a lot of patience and perseverance,
because it turned out the suits had some <em>serious</em>
wards on them. They still weren’t sure what they were for. Remus said,
and James agreed, that they were definitely defensive, but defense
against what—well, all they’d been able to determine was that it was
very old magic, and not something they wanted to tamper with.</p>
<p>Remus
had worked out the spells with Sirius who, when he put his mind to
something, was a force to be reckoned with. James and Sirius had tried
them out one night in an empty corridor, and James was still extremely
proud of himself for not interrogating his friend about Remus.</p>
<p>This
might have had something to do with the fact that they ended up chasing
a suit of armor halfway across Hogwarts without getting caught by
Filch, a feat that really should go down in Hogwarts history but
tragically never would. He and Sirius were still laughing about it.
Peter was all awe, and Remus even quirked a smile when he heard.</p>
<p>They
had needed a spell to change records without having to do it by hand,
and shockingly enough, that had come from Lily Evans. It turned out
that her speeches about Muggle ingenuity aside, it hadn’t been <em>quite</em>
enough for her, and she’d gotten sick of having to change records and
move needles and generally fidget with the machine just to listen to a
different song or a different artist. </p>
<p>So
she’d just invented her own spells. As though that was an easy and
completely normal thing to do! As though plenty of grown wizards hadn’t
died blowing themselves up trying to do the same thing!</p>
<p>That
hadn’t stopped him and Sirius from trying it, of course, but it had
been incredibly difficult and after a lot of trial and mostly error and
explosions, they’d decided to stick to modifying existing spells
instead of inventing new ones completely.</p>
<p>James
wondered if it had to do with being Muggleborn and not knowing it was
supposed to be hard. He also wondered what else Lily could do that
would never occur to a Pureblood to even attempt. He wondered how much
worse wizarding culture would be without Muggles and Muggleborns.</p>
<p>He
thought about this almost as much as he thought about the prank itself,
and even more about how to tell Lily he thought she was amazing without
managing to infuriate her. He was considering writing a song.</p>
<p>However,
before he could work on an action item on his “Ways To Convice Lily
Evans You’re Not A Rubbish Fire Of A Human Being” list, he had another
objective, and for that he needed to talk to Remus alone, and for <em>that</em>, he had to convince Remus that he absolutely needed James’s help to set up the record player.</p>
<p>“Put it this way,” he said, finally, “who do you want choosing the music? Me or Sirius?”</p>
<p>“Hey!” said Sirius. “My taste is incredible!”</p>
<p>“You listen to the same two songs on a loop daily,” said Peter.</p>
<p>“I
can’t pick it out myself?” said Remus, ignoring them both. “You two
should focus on enchanting all the armor, I’m still not sure the timer
spells are going to work…”</p>
<p>James
was about to wave that away, when he thought about leaving Sirius and
Peter to it and realized that Remus actually had a point. “Well….I’ll
just have to do double duty, then, it’ll go faster with two of us and
then we can both go help. C’mon, Moony! Don’t you want to spend time
with me?”</p>
<p>“Your
puppy-dog eyes are not nearly as effective as Padfoot’s,” Remus said,
but he didn’t actually argue, so James figured it was settled.</p>
<p>Now he just had to ignore Peter.</p>
<p>“Are you sure dinner is the best time for this?” he said.</p>
<p>“For the last time, <em>yes</em>,”
said James. “First thing in the morning is no good, the school filters
in so slowly and I’m not convinced McGonagall wouldn’t murder all of us
if we did this before she’s fully woken up—”</p>
<p>“She sleeps?” said Peter.</p>
<p>“A full eight hours a night, very sensibly,” said Sirius approvingly. “She’s too classy a lady for anything less.” </p>
<p>“How do you kno—you know what, never mind,” said Remus.</p>
<p>“—Lunch is no good,” James continued, determined to finish now that he’d started. “In the middle of classes? Evans <em>and </em>McGonagall
would kill me, and I’d hate to see her go to jail before she even
graduates Hogwarts with more N.E.W.T’s than any of us—”</p>
<p>“You’re back to calling her Evans? What, did you two get in a fight?” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“Would McGonagall not go to jail?” said Peter.</p>
<p>“Never,” Sirius told him. “She’d make it look like an accident and get away scot-free, don’t be an idiot.”</p>
<p>“—<em>which leaves dinner</em>,”
said James loudly. “Everyone will be there, and there will be no excuse
for murder, if they could even prove it was us, which they won’t be
able to, since we have afternoon classes on Friday and will have been
in class all day like good little sixth years. Okay? Okay. No more
arguing. Moony, come with me.”</p>
<p>“Where
are we going?” said Remus, because he was, secretly, a little shit.
Sirius actually beamed at him. James was going to vomit.</p>
<p>“You’re
all dead to me,” he said, grabbing Remus’s wrist and physically
dragging him along. “Come on, I’m going to murder you before Lily or
McGonagall can even get to you.”</p>
<p>“Tell my story, Pads!” Remus yelled. A bark of laughter followed them out of the dormitory and down to the Common Room.</p>
<p>They’d
decided on a very secret location near the Great Hall for the record
player setup, a little nook hidden by a tapestry that was perfect for
their purposes. They would need amplification spells, spells to throw
the sound so no one could tell where it was coming from, and spells
that Lily called “mixing spells,” which sounded odd, but “mixing” just
turned out to be a Muggle term for “picking what order to play songs
in.” And really, having two people to do this—two people who were good
at magic and unlikely to get distracted in tight quarters all alone,
that is—was not a bad idea. James was a strategical genius.</p>
<p>“So,” he said. “What’s the current bet on when I’ll figure out about you and Sirius?”</p>
<p>Right. Strategy. Strategy was the most important thing in a time like this.</p>
<p>Remus was staring at him. </p>
<p>“Fuck,”
he said finally. James wondered distantly if Sirius got a little thrill
of accomplishment every time Remus swore, then stamped down heavily on
that thought. Remus was still talking, after all. Yes. Listen to the
friend, Potter. “I owe him,” he said. “He’s got you figuring it out
ages ago and being too awkward to tell us.” He bent over the record
player, refusing to meet James’s eyes, as though there was anything
that could make this conversation less weird.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been <em>ages</em>,”
James said. “And I wasn’t too awkward. Lily said I should wait to let
you tell me. I only figured out at the tattoo place that you weren’t
actually trying to hide it.”</p>
<p>Remus’s hand slipped, and James had to grab it before he scratched the record he was positioning. “Careful!”</p>
<p>“You talked about it with <em>Lily</em>?” Remus said.</p>
<p>James shrugged, trying to look nonchalant. “I didn’t tell her anything, she already knew. It just came up.” </p>
<p>“Came up how?” said Remus, who knew what James sounded like when he was withholding information.</p>
<p>He
had more practice at not blurting things out around Remus, though. “She
talks to me sometimes,” he said vaguely. “Anyway, you knew she knew,
you weren’t hiding it! You just weren’t saying anything, you let people
draw their own conclusions, and Lily’s your friend and not an idiot.”</p>
<p>Remus’s lips quirked into a half-smirk that James <em>knew</em> Sirius worked way too hard to get out of him. Christ, he’d been so blind. “Unlike some people?”</p>
<p>James
sighed. “You’re not wrong, Moony,” he said, as heavily as he could
without laughing. He picked a record, put it on the turntable, and
positioned the arm right over the groove for “Bohemian Rhapsody.”</p>
<p>“Sure?” said Remus.</p>
<p>“Yes,”
said James firmly. “We can go to Led Zeppelin after that, and finish
off with the Garfunkel.” He marked the track with his wand, leaving a
glowing silver light in the groove to mark its place and draw the
needle down to it when they activated the spell.</p>
<p>Remus was grinning.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I knew you knew the right name for Led Zeppelin,” he said. “You were only saying Lead Blimp to piss him off.”</p>
<p>“Er—Lily corrected me,” he admitted.</p>
<p>“Hm,” said Remus. “How much have you been talking to her, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Uh—twice in the last three weeks? Which now that you mention it is more than usual, Remus, d’you think she’s warming up to me?”</p>
<p>“Well, <em>I</em>
didn’t get the name of her tattoo artist, a copy of her ID, and her
complicit assistance with a schoolwide prank,” said Remus. “You sure
you want to close out with Simon and Garfunkel? They’re a little more
mellow than the other two, less dance-y.”</p>
<p>“Lily likes them,” James said.</p>
<p>Remus sighed. “James,” he said.</p>
<p>“What? Don’t tell me you’re not agreeing to Zeppelin just because Sirius likes them.”</p>
<p>“I am not nearly as whipped as you,” Remus informed him.</p>
<p>“Right,
that’s got to be the other way around,” James said before he could
think about it, then turned a furious shade of red when Remus stared at
him. “Um. Please let’s forget I said that.”</p>
<p>“Done,” said Remus. “Why not the Beatles?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right,” said James. “Shit. We’d better start with them. What song do you think?”</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me, I’m not an expert on Muggle dance music.”</p>
<p>“Hard
Day’s Night it is, then,” said James, pulling out the single in
question. “Queen can close. Also, you know we don’t have to <em>tell</em> Sirius that he was right.”</p>
<p>Remus
sighed heavily, but took the Queen record out of the turntable and
started to erase the markings James had put on it, and didn’t comment.
“We don’t?” he said. He closed the spell off and started over, putting
“Hard Day’s Night” in the turntable and marking it as the first song
instead.</p>
<p>“We
don’t,” James said. “We make him think I just now figured it out, and
then you don’t have to pay out, and you can give me part of your cut.”</p>
<p>Remus
actually dropped his wand. “Uh—James,” he said, picking it up without
looking at him. His ears were very red. “I, uh. I don’t think you
actually want that.”</p>
<p>“What? Why not?” James got to work on the amplification spells, since Remus was indisposed for whatever reason.</p>
<p>“Uh,” Remus said again. He leaned back and covered his eyes, sighing. “The bet wasn’t for money,” he said.</p>
<p>James suddenly understood why Remus didn’t want to look at him.</p>
<p>“Merlin’s
balls,” he said, when he realized it had been way too long since he’d
said words. He was mid spell and could almost feel a coil of magic
hanging loose, but—but.</p>
<p>“You want to pretend this conversation never happened? I’m all for pretending this never happened,” said Remus.</p>
<p>James
shook himself, and hurriedly finished off his spell before it could
spiral out of control and explode and give away their whereabouts. “No,
no,” he said. “I need to be better about taking responsibility for my
actions, I did this to myself, I should accept the consequences.”</p>
<p>“You sure you’ve only talked to Lily twice recently?” said Remus. He sounded suspicious.</p>
<p>“Very sure,” said James. “Uh—well. Fuck. How long have you two been—you know.”</p>
<p>Remus, mercifully, didn’t ask him to clarify. “Last semester,” he said. “October.”</p>
<p>“Wait,”
said James. “Please tell me it wasn’t the Hogsmeade weekend when you
two disappeared for two hours and Pete and I didn’t notice you were
gone until it was time to go back to Hogwarts and you two showed up
like nothing had happened—oh god. Oh <em>god</em>.”</p>
<p>“No,”
said Remus, and thank god his ears were bright pink, it meant James
wasn’t the only one deeply embarrassed by this conversation. “Before
that.”</p>
<p>“Wait,
really?” James was now curious in spite of himself, never a good sign,
but he couldn’t stop it. “Oh my god, Remus, you’re his longest
relationship ever. Who kissed who first? Wait, no, let me guess—if I
guess right you can tell Sirius you win the bet after all.”</p>
<p>“That’s not how it—”</p>
<p>“Shhh,
Moony, I’m thinking.” He squinted at his friend for a minute. “I bet it
was you,” he said finally. “Sirius talks a load of bollocks but he’d
never own up to having <em>feelings</em>. Also you probably laid one on him just to get him to shut the hell up.”</p>
<p>Remus was still pink, but in a way that meant he was hiding a grin. “That’s—not far off, actually.”</p>
<p>“Yes!! I knew it. You know, Remus,” he said, pushing up his sleeve, “it may take me some time to figure things out sometimes—”</p>
<p>“Oh god,” said Remus.</p>
<p>“—But eventually I get the i-<em>deer</em>. Get it? Get it?” James held up his arm for effect, and didn’t care that Remus was burying his head in his hands. <em>Both</em> hands. That meant it was <em>extra funny.</em> “Oh my god, I’m the best. Hey, since I didn’t figure it out until like last week, you can tell Sirius he was wrong, I <em>didn’t</em> know this whole time. So technically you were both right.”</p>
<p>“I
did say that if you knew there’s no way you wouldn’t be wildly
obnoxious about it,” said Remus thoughtfully. “And I was right about
that.”</p>
<p>“See? Winners all around! Wait, what? I’m obnoxious? How dare you!”</p>
<p>“I think Sirius will say we both <em>lost</em>,”
said Remus, grinning, because he knew it would make James squirm. And
it did. “Which means we’d both have to pay up,” he added, just to twist
the knife further.</p>
<p>“Great,” said James. “<em>Never tell me what the bet is.</em> I think we should go help out him and Wormtail, huh?”</p>
<p>“I
can’t believe you deliberately separated us so you could corner me for
this conversation,” said Remus, following him out into the hallway.</p>
<p>“Shhhh,
Moony, stealth, haven’t you learned anything after six years with us
delinquents?” he said in an undertone. “Come on, and be quiet. And it
had to be you, there’s no way I could cut a deal with Sirius.”</p>
<p>“So I’m easier to manipulate?” Remus said, but at least he said it quietly.</p>
<p>“To <em>reason with</em>,
keep up, Moony. Also just for the record, if you break Padfoot’s heart,
I’ll punch you, and if he breaks yours I’ll punch him. Tell him I said
that.”</p>
<p>“Tell him yourself,” said Remus. “Come on, we’d better find them before Peter blows up the school.”</p>
<p>“<em>True</em>,” said James, with feeling, and followed his friend down the hall.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>In
retrospect, James really shouldn’t have left Sirius to his own devices
for even thirty seconds, let alone all the time it had taken for him
and Remus to set up the records.</p>
<p>He had <em>added things</em>.</p>
<p>McGonagall was going to <em>set them on fire</em>.</p>
<p>It
started well enough. Dinner was going on as usual, the dull roar of
conversation serving well to hide the fact that Sirius was jiggling his
leg uncontrollably, and Peter kept laughing nervously.</p>
<p>It
wasn’t exactly a high-stakes prank, but it had required difficult
magic, so their nervous energy was mostly excitement to see how it
worked. Even Remus kept glancing at the doorways, with the faint smile
that meant he was looking forward to something and didn’t want to admit
it.</p>
<p>James
was just starting to worry that the entrance wouldn’t be nearly
dramatic enough when a horrible sound, staticky at first and then a
weird, tinny howl, echoed over the hall. He immediately looked at
Sirius, who was the picture of innocence, which meant that he had <em>definitely</em>
done something. Probably with Remus’s help—yes, Remus’s face was
completely blank. Maybe they hadn’t taken so long to come back from the
loo earlier that day because they were snogging. Maybe they had been
fiddling with the record player. <em>Maybe both.</em></p>
<p>The
Great Hall had gone dead quiet. A few people were looking around,
trying to determine the source of the noise, and others were looking
trepidatious and even a little scared. James glanced at one or two
people that he knew to be Muggleborns. They looked <em>very</em> confused. That sound must have been a Muggle thing that Sirius had dug up, though Merlin knew where he’d found it.</p>
<p>The
vague fear and confusion did not go away when the suits of armor came
marching in and took up their places among the students.</p>
<p>James
saw McGonagall start to rise from her seat, wand out, and then stop,
confused, when the dissonant chord of “Hard Day’s Night” rang out.</p>
<p>The
time between that chord and the lyrics felt like an eternity, but as
soon as they started and the suits of armor began their choreographed
dance, and the mood in the room went veered straight to laughter. A few
Muggleborn students, once they understood what was happening, jumped up
to dance and even sing along, and several of their friends joined them,
reluctant at first but encouraged by the enthusiastic routine of the
suits of armor.</p>
<p><em>Yes,</em> thought James. <em>Random dance party accomplished.</em></p>
<p>Lily was staring at him. He caught her eye and grinned.</p>
<p>She
kept staring. James was on the verge of fidgeting uncomfortably when a
suit of armor offered her its hand, and then all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>How had Sirius even known how to get it to do that.</p>
<p>Oh god, people were dancing with the suits of armor. Lily’s was twirling her. She was <em>laughing</em>. McGonagall was <em>looking</em> at him, he could <em>feel it</em>.</p>
<p>James
looked at Sirius in a panic, but Sirius had actually jumped to his feet
and was laughing, the wild laughter that meant he had forgotten all
consequences, and he had somehow pulled Remus into this nonsense and
was spinning him around. Peter was not dancing, but he was grinning and
clapping along.</p>
<p>He looked over at the Slytherin table. Most of them were looking at each other darkly. And muttering.</p>
<p>Snape was glaring at Lily.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>James
twitched his wand ever so slightly, turning up the volume a little
more, loud enough that no one would be able to plot evilly together.
When the song faded out, no one had even a split second to groan in
disappointment, because Led Zeppelin was playing, the suits of armor
were headbanging, and everyone was laughing and throwing their hands up
in the air, even the ones who didn’t know the song.</p>
<p>He chanced a look at Dumbledore.</p>
<p>The Headmaster was eating calmly, as though nothing was happening.</p>
<p>Slytherins
were trying to get up and leave the Hall, but it was extremely
difficult to get to the door, and they kept ending up in the middle of
dancing students.</p>
<p>James
grinned. Some of the First and Second Years, the ones who hadn’t been
there long enough to be fully Slytherin’d, were slipping into the crowd
so they could dance too, taking off their badges so no one would notice
them.</p>
<p>He
looked around, and saw that Peter had seen them too. He raised his
eyebrows, and Peter nodded, a little too obviously, but no one was
looking. They both took their wands out again, casting Obfuscation
charms that targeted the older Slytherins. It wouldn’t do for the kids
to get in trouble with their shitty peers.</p>
<p>Peter
wasn’t a great hand at most magic, but he could always make things
unnoticeable. And on James’s part, a few well-placed Charms pushed the
Slytherins who were sneering the hardest towards the doors. It was
worth it, to keep them from cooking up trouble that would ruin the fun.
And neither Snape nor Lucius Malfoy would be able to get back inside
until it was over. He knew his business.</p>
<p>“Black Dog” faded out, and for another second, the entire Great Hall held its breath.</p>
<p>There were actual cheers when “Bohemian Rhapsody” started.</p>
<p>Sirius
hadn’t messed with this choreography. The suits of armor started off
slow, just the way they had planned it, and this time everyone was
watching them—even the non-Muggleborns could tell from the music that
something was building up.</p>
<p>The
Muggleborns, on the other hand, were singing along at the top of their
lungs. James could see a couple of them dramatically miming to their
friends.</p>
<p>A
few suits of armor struck epic air guitar poses for the first guitar
solo. His chest filled with the satisfaction of a job well done, but
that wasn’t nearly as incredible as the anticipation of knowing what
was coming next.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the looks of confusion when the song picked up were priceless and completely worth the wait.</p>
<p>The
best part of all were the people who knew the song. James realized,
suddenly, that this was probably the first time at Hogwarts when they
knew exactly what was going on when all the wizarding-born students
didn’t.</p>
<p>A
bunch of them had jumped up on the tables. Sirius was among them. They
were putting the suit-of-armor choreography to shame. They had taken up
parts in the singing. Sirius, who always wore Muggle clothes to dinner
just to annoy Slytherins, was ripping off his shirt. There was a great
deal of laughter and cheering, not to mention a few wolf-whistles.
Sirius winked into the crowd, seemingly at random, but James saw him
glance briefly at Remus before he did it.</p>
<p>Idiots.</p>
<p>James
looked at Lily briefly, at how hard she was laughing, and didn’t even
have to think about it. He jumped up with Sirius, just in time to
headbang furiously to the third section of the song.</p>
<p>The
rest was a blur. He thought he might have slid down the table on his
knees to sing dramatically at Lily Evans. He was pretty sure Sirius had
tangled his hair into permanent knots. Somehow his tie ended up wrapped
around his head, and he had no memory of doing that. He had pushed up
his sleeves so that his stag tattoo was visible—extra amazing because
it was freshly enchanted to move in accordance with his mood, so it was
jumping and leaping all over his arm, and everyone could see it. He
vaguely remembered Remus lighting up the tip of his wand, waving it,
starting a trend all across the Great Hall as the song ended.</p>
<p>The
suits of armor struck one more epic pose, one arm in the air, heads
bowed—and then abruptly stood up straight and marched back out of the
Hall, back to their appropriate places.</p>
<p>There
was a brief moment of confusion, when everyone wasn’t sure whether it
was really over, but when it became clear that it was, a collective
groan went up. James and Sirius glanced at each other, assessing—<em>we could play another song, should we play another song?</em> They looked at Remus, who flicked his eyes briefly towards the head table—<em>see what Dumbledore does.</em></p>
<p>He chanced a look at Peter, whose face was blank—<em>are we in trouble??? Do they know it was us???</em></p>
<p>No help there.</p>
<p>Just
before everyone gave up and sat down in disappointment, the sound of
someone clearing their throat politely came from the front of the room.
They all looked anxiously at the Headmaster, who said nothing at first,
just sighed and looked at the ceiling.</p>
<p>“I have just gone temporarily deaf and blind,” said Dumbledore. “So
if anything interesting just happened, I have no idea what it was.”</p>
<p>There was a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“However,” he said.</p>
<p>Everyone tensed.</p>
<p>“I rather enjoyed the quiet, to be honest. It would probably return if whatever was so interesting were not over so quickly.”</p>
<p>James and Sirius grinned at each other—<em>encore</em>. Sirius smirked faintly and glanced at Remus, then back at James: <em>don’t worry, we have songs ready.</em></p>
<p>Remus bit his lip, hiding a grin. He twitched his wand, so subtly that it was almost unnoticeable.</p>
<p>They
weren’t all Muggle songs. There were a few wizarding ones mixed in,
because, as Sirius yelled to him over the music, they’d made their
point and now just wanted everyone to dance. Also, the songs were good.</p>
<p>“You could have told me,” James said, right in his ear, because he didn’t feel like screaming.</p>
<p>Sirius gave him an odd look. “That we made a few changes to the mix? I didn’t think it was that important, mate.”</p>
<p>“That too,” said James.</p>
<p>Sirius looked at Remus, then back at James. “That wouldn’t have been as fun though, would it?”</p>
<p>James rolled his eyes. “You’re a moron, Pads.”</p>
<p>“Did he tell you it was his idea?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Sirius grinned. “The bet was his idea. I came up with the rules.”</p>
<p>He looked at Remus, who was watching them. When he saw the look on James’s face, he winked. Actually winked.</p>
<p>Remus Lupin: ideas man. Sirius Black: strategist.</p>
<p>The world was not ready.</p>
<p>“Jesus
Merlin Dumbledore,” said James, but he was grinning so widely he
thought his face would split in half. “You two are going to eat each
other alive.”</p>
<p>“Well—” Sirius began.</p>
<p>“No,”
said James, resisting the urge to clamp his hand over Sirius’s mouth,
because Sirius would just lick it and that would go badly for everyone.
“No breaking my brain. It’s fragile.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Sirius. “Well, if you want advice from an expert—”</p>
<p>“Oh god.”</p>
<p>“—You should <em>definitely</em> quit talking to me right now.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Sirius tilted his chin in Lily’s direction, and when James looked at her she looked back and <em>grinned at him.</em> His mouth went dry.</p>
<p>“Right,”
he said, summoning every ounce of Gryffindor courage he had, and went
over to see if she would dance with him, or at least spin around in
circles wildly until they both fell over.</p>
<p>She did.</p>
<p>She
even told him, later, that it was a good prank, as pranks went, and it
was a good morale-booster for the Muggleborns. She was proud of him for
coming up with something that was fun for everyone, that even opened up
everyone’s horizons a little bit.</p>
<p>James
managed not to propose marriage on the spot, or even agree that he was
a genius, which, while true, would have spoiled it. He stuck to “thank
you” and “Lily, you are the <em>deerest</em> person in the world to me, your approval is like the sun, my <em>fawn</em>dness for you grows daily, grace me with your <em>stag-</em>gering light” and “okay, okay, I’m going now, <em>doe</em> it kills me to leave your <em>deer</em> presence.”</p>
