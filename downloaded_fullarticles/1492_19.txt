The first spatter of rain against the window: warm rain, he knew, because this was a summer storm after all.</p><p class="p1">The first storm Sirius wasn’t here for because Sirius had snuck out — somewhere <em>muggle </em>no doubt — and left Regulus all alone.</p><p class="p1">The world grew dark. Regulus darted under his bed as the rumble of thunder grew into a roar as loud as if those two Olympian brothers, Poseidon the Earth-Shaker and Zeus the Thunder God, were warring on the rooftops.</p><p class="p1">Regulus took in a shuddering breath, hands clutching at his heart as if that might stop its frenzied beating.</p><p class="p1">The rain lashed against the leaded window. The first <em>CRACK </em>of lightning illuminated his bedroom and found Regulus curling himself into a ball and squeezing his eyes shut and wishing it were over.</p><p class="p1">When the stink of smoke filled his nostrils he thought the worst had happened. But there was a warm hand on his shoulder, and a familiar voice murmuring his name.</p><p class="p1">“You came back,” Regulus whispered, disbelieving.</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, ‘course I did. There’s a storm,” shrugged Sirius.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p></div>
