    <p> Looking around, all she can see are bare, cold walls, ceiling filled with damp and creaking, tarnished floorboards. It’s one largish room with another off to one side, the door to that room hanging off of two of for hinges and propped up by two old, ratty text books. Damn near permanently open unless the crack in the bathroom window gets too drafty.</p><p> The kitchen, or what can be classed as one anyway, is separated by a small wall to the living room and holds a sink and three double cupboards. Two of the cupboards have at least one door hanging off their hinges and the last double cupboard has both doors missing. Near to the broken kitchen is a crate topped with cardboard from a cereal box.</p><p> As she takes another look around, she finally notices the lumpy blanket in one of the corners.</p><p> It’s worn, bobbled and has lots of little holes dotted over it. At the top of the blanket, directly beneath the window, which she notes is covered by plywood, hair is spread out on the tarnished floor, a chilled autumn draft blows over her.</p><p> The relatively short, middle-aged ravenette allows herself to travel closer to the blanket and mass of hair poking out of the end.</p><p> She crouches down, resting her elbow on the leather of her trousers and tentatively brushes hair out of the way.</p><p> A girl, no more than nineteen at least lies before her. The girl, clearly malnourished and exhausted doesn’t react to the movement around her.</p><p> The ravenette sighs and strokes a finger down one of the girl’s pale, bony cheeks, her collar bone and jaw prominent.</p><p> “Hey.” She says softly, trying to wake the girl up. She carries on stroking her finger along the girl’s cheek.</p><p> She then gently prods the brunette’s shoulder and the girl shivers in reply. She retracts her legs and curls further into herself.</p><p> “Hey, kitten.” She again nudges the girl’s shoulder and the girl finally wakes up.</p><p> With a start she sits up and hurriedly shuffles away from the woman crouching over her. “Wh-who are y-you.”</p><p> The woman smiles down at her and lets her hand fall to her knee. “I’m Bella and I’m going to sort this out.” She gestures to the girl’s tiny two roomed flat.</p><p> “What? B-but it’s…I…Please, don’t. I can b-barely afford this p-place as it i-is.” She tugs her knees to her chest and covers herself with the moth-eaten blanket.</p><p> The woman chuckles and shakes her head. “No, it’s not going to cost anything.”</p><p> “Wh-…How d-did you even get in?” The brunette looks around her flat, trying to find where the woman could possibly have come from. Only her eyes move, she’s clearly too terrified to turn away from the ravenette.</p><p> The woman gracefully sits back, letting her legs fall crossed in-front of her. “I actually came in to rob you, maybe a tv or two, a phone perhaps, even a microwave. But, seeing as you don’t even have any food in the cupboard…” The woman hums and taps her lips with her fingers in thought. “I’ll be right back.”</p><p> The brunette can only nod as the woman stands back up and whips her phone out of her leather jacket pocket.</p><p> She looks at it for a moment scrolling through her contacts before letting it ring and walking back out of the door she’d come in.</p><p> And just like that the woman was gone, the door was left ajar and the brunette was left to shiver in the darkness. She huddles further into herself, too scared to move and watching the door like a hawk.</p><p> Not a moment later, the woman comes back in, Bella if she remembers correctly, with a wide grin on her face.</p><p> “Right I’ve made some arrangements, you’re coming home with me.” She crouches back down where she’d knelt then sat earlier and offers a slim hand.</p><p> “B-but…But. Stranger danger.” She whispers, hiding the lower half of her face beneath the blanket.</p><p> The woman laughs again and jiggles her hand around, trying to get the girl to hold her hand. “B-but nothing. You’re gonna catch hypothermia at this rate. Now, either stay here and from a cold or come to mine and be nice and toastie.”</p><p> The brunette looks up at the woman through her lashes, untrusting of this sudden change in her life. “How do I know you’re not going to kill me? Or <em>worse</em>.”</p><p> “Oh, come now, what could possibly be worse than dying from a cold, on your own in a place like this?”</p><p> The brunette huffs, looks away and then her hand shoots out and grabs the older woman’s, who grins at her answer.</p><p> “Right, come on then kitten.” She helps tug the girl up, who clearly, is trying to disguise her discomfort from lying on a cold, hard floor for so long. “Steady on, wouldn’t want you falling over before we’ve even taken a step now do we?”</p><p> The brunette rolls her eyes and holds onto the offered arm and sighs. Limping as they take the first few steps.</p><p> However, just before they reach the door she stops. “W-what about…erm…what about my home?” The ravenette tuts and tugs on the girl’s arm, she’s too weak to not follow.</p><p> “This place can burn in hell as far as I’m concerned. Now, shall we?” She looks over at the girl, who’s gaze is trained to the ground and her feet slowly shuffling away next to the clear click of the woman’s heels.</p><p> “Hermione.”</p><p> “What’s that kitten?”</p><p> “My name, it’s Hermione.” The woman grins again.</p>
