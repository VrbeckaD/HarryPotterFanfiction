  <em>I see a bad moon rising,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I see trouble on the way,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I see earthquakes and lightnin’,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I see bad times today.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>1980</p><p> </p><p>Remus Lupin fiddled with the strings of his battered old Gibson guitar. Lazily his fingers ran up and down the strings, playing random notes with little order or plan to the way he played. He closed his eyes and let his head fall back to rest on the backrest of his half-broken sofa, which had copious amounts of unpleasant spills and stains of who the fuck knew what on it, and he had long considered throwing it out. If only he had the money for a replacement.</p><p> </p><p>Money was something he had little of recently he mused as his hand continued strumming the guitar, no doubt irritating the neighbours through the thin walls of his flat. Fuck it, if he had to listen to their loud arguments at three o’clock in the morning and their even louder sex, they can bloody well listen to his guitar. For some reason, he suddenly struck up the ‘Layla’ riff, a favourite of his (as it should be to all guitar players, he reasoned) and returned to worrying over his financial woes.</p><p> </p><p>It had been a while since he had toured with any pre-established bands as a fill in or anything else that brought in any decent income and it was starting to get desperate. Busking and open mics brought in hardly anything (it didn’t help that he can’t sing to save his life) and his search for prospective band members to form a group weren’t going anywhere. If worse came to worse he might have to take his dad’s offer to help get him work at the factory he worked in in the east end. That was a fucking depressing thought, Christ.</p><p> </p><p>Warily, he put his guitar down and picked up the half-smoked joint resting in an astray on his coffee table and took a long, much needed drag. No matter what else was fucked in his life, he could always trust good old marijuana to take the edge off. He smiled, despite himself. How fucked was he, smoking weed alone in his tiny, shitty flat in Camden with no money, partner or real achievement to his name? Not what he’d envisioned his life would be like at age twenty-two. But life always does seem to manage to kick you in the balls consistently and without remorse.</p><p> </p><p>The <em>Thin Lizzy</em> record that had been playing in the background ended and he, with no small amount of effort, pushed himself up and ambled over to the record player. He put <em>Bad Reputation </em>back into one of the boxes full of over maybe a hundred vinyl records, though he had far more at his parent’s house. After a short deliberation, he cracked open <em>Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd </em>and popped it into the record player, smiling slightly as the uneven drum pattern of <em>I Ain’t The One</em> exploded in his ears, after he placed the needle on the spinning record.</p><p> </p><p>He was mouthing the words of <em>Simple Man</em> along with Ronnie Van Zant when the phone very suddenly and very unexpectedly began to ring. He frowned. It was not a Sunday afternoon and therefore couldn’t be his mother’s weekly call. His friends who he went to concerts, dive bars and other such places with never rang him. They’d just turn up at his house at midnight and ask him if he wanted to come out.</p><p> </p><p>Shaking away his confusion, he turned the record player’s volume down and walked over to his phone, picking it up on it’s fourth ring.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello?”</p><p> </p><p>“Am I speaking to Mr Remus John Lupin?” A very curt, serious female voice asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Er… yeah.” How an earth did this women know him? He didn’t recognise the voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Mr Lupin. My name is Minerva McGonagall and I am the manager for the Marauders.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus blinked. The Marauders were a relatively new punky, hard rock band similar to <em>The Clash</em> but heavier and not as good. They’d released their debut album, Black Stag, a couple of months a go to decent reviews and slightly worse than decent sales at least in the UK, Remus wasn’t sure how it had done in America or anywhere else for that matter. As of yet they weren’t huge and only those in the industry or huge fans of that genre really knew them but they were definitely up and coming.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, he’d gone to see them just last month in their small UK tour. He’d been mildly impressed, they had been good live. Although some definitely had more of a stage presence than others in the band.</p><p> </p><p> “Mr Lupin?” Remus started, realising he had been silent for probably about twenty seconds.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh-yes… um… er-”</p><p> </p><p>“Minerva McGonagall.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, yes Ms McGonagall. What can I help you with?” It was a fair question. The Marauders seemed to have their shit together and their tour had just finished so even if they had lost a member, there seemed no need for a fill in.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you aware of the band I represent?” She asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I’ve listened to Black Stag. It’s… good.” Surely he could come up with a better complement than that.</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>“Unfortunately, we have come across some issues with our lead guitarist.” She paused, seemingly searching for her next few words. “And because of that we are looking for someone to fill the void.”</p><p> </p><p>“Correct me if I’m wrong,” Remus said, “but hasn’t the tour finished? Why do you have need of a fill in now?”</p><p> </p><p>“You misunderstand me, Mr Lupin. We don’t want a temporary substitute. We want a replacement on lead guitar.”</p><p> </p><p>He felt his heart beat faster, a lot faster. He’d played with bands, a lot of bands, some of which he’d put together, others he’d joined. He played in dive bars and coffee houses, slumming his way through the cut throat London music scene. He’d even filled in as a rhythm guitarist for singer songwriter Frank Longbottom, who’d recent record had gone platinum. But this was by far the best shot he’d ever had. Sure, the Marauders weren’t international stars yet but they had the makings of a great band. With his help.</p><p> </p><p>“I must warn you, Mr Lupin, you are just one of many guitarists we are calling. At this point all I can promise you is an audition in front of the band.”</p><p> </p><p>Ah, so it wasn’t that easy. It never was, this is life after all (see the ball kicking comment above) but that didn’t matter. He could beat at a few posers, he was sure because Remus Lupin was a very good player and he knew it.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fine, Ms McGonagall. I’m prepared to fight for a place.”</p><p> </p><p>“Excellent.” Remus was surprised a word so positive could come out of this severe woman’s mouth, even if it was said with no enthusiasm. “Two’ o’clock, Friday afternoon at Bludger recording studios.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus knows of the place, it’s only a ten minute walk away from his flat. It’s owned by Order of the Phoenix Records, who The Marauders are signed to.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be there.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>“Make sure your not late. Even two minutes tardiness will cost you the opportunity. Clear?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, Ms McGonagall.”</p><p> </p><p>“Very well, if that’s a-”</p><p> </p><p>“Actually, I’m wondering. How did you know to call me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Bane of The Star Gazers recommended you.” He’d filled in for The Star Gazers for a few shows when their guitarist, Firenze, had broken his arm about six months back. His last real money intake.</p><p> </p><p>“The Star Gazers?” He asked her, surprised they’d been asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Our company recently signed them and so when we put some feelers out for a new guitarist, you were one of the names put forward.” He’d have to thank Bane later.</p><p> </p><p>“I see.”</p><p> </p><p>“Now,” she said in a no-nonsense business tone, “I have other guitarists to call.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course. Thank you for the opportunity.” With that she was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Remus put down the phone in a slight state of shock. In a rather short phone call his prospects had drastically improved. Sure there were probably going to be a lot guitarists asked to audition, probably some really good ones because a band on the rise like the Marauders couldn’t take any chances but Remus was confident in his abilities.</p><p> </p><p>He’d been playing since he was seven when his mother got him his first guitar, a cheap, acoustic that came with a small book containing a few chords. After picking up the basics fast he had played the guitar, improving and honing his skill until his fingers were cracked and raw. He’d made the switch to electric at age thirteen, copying George Harrison and Keith Richard’s every sound on pretty much every <em>Stones</em> and <em>Beatles</em> record before branching out to <em>The Who</em>, <em>Bowie</em>, <em>Chuck Berry</em> and so many more. It had taken him two solid weeks to master <em>Free Bird</em> (he’d taken weeks off school and had barely been able to eat, drink or sleep in that time).</p><p> </p><p>All in all Remus Lupin was confident in his own abilities. Now he just had to make the Marauders as confident in those abilities.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What sort of name was the Marauders? Remus asked himself as he made his way through the bustling London streets, guitar case strapped to his back, to Bludger recording studios that Friday. It sounded as though they were a group of wannabe pirates, named by a ten year old. It didn’t really matter though, the music did; he liked their music, he reasoned. That didn’t mean he wouldn’t try to make a few changes should he get the job, however.</p><p> </p><p>Mentally, he chastised himself. Get the gig first. Knock them on their arses and force them to pick you. He nodded to himself and was distracted enough he couldn’t see the blonde woman, who looked at about thirty five, coming his way and he accidently barged into her. She stumbled and scowled at him, then muttered something under her breath which sounded very much like, “cunt.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” he murmured and carried on walking, increasing his pace. After that incident, he was sure to keep his head up and watch where he was going.</p><p> </p><p>He got to the small, red brick building that was his destination with five minutes to spare. It was narrow but three storeys high with faded red lettering above the door spelling out Bludger Studios. He could the hear the faint sound of music coming from one of the top windows. There were posters littering the outside of the building for different bands. He decided that while this place wasn’t clean and could do with some better sound insulation, he quite liked it. It oozed music.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, before the door he felt nervous. Up until now the audition hadn’t seemed that real and he’d been happy that his guitar abilities would be enough. But what if there some undiscovered Hendrix auditioning with this band? Or maybe he just wouldn’t be a good fit. He was about to walk in front of three accomplished musicians and presumably their stern manager and he’d have to be at his best. Fuck it, this is what he’d been training for years for. He could do it. He took a deep breath and pushed open the door, stepping inside.</p><p> </p><p>He found himself in a sort of dingy reception with a few chairs leaned up against one wall, he guessed for waiting, and a desk with a young woman with glasses and long, flowing blonde hair was sat behind. She was currently writing furiously on a of piece paper in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Remus walked up to her, passing a few gold records on the wall. “Hello?” He asked. The woman looked up.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes?” She asked, sounding irritated.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m here to, um, audition for The Marauders.” He said, feeling slightly put off by her rudeness.</p><p> </p><p>“Name?” She said with a sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Remus Lupin.” The woman consulted several sheets of paper on her desk for a few, painful moments. Finally, she found what she was looking for.</p><p> </p><p>“Just in time, Mr Lupin. Please take a seat, they’re just finishing up with the last guitarist now.”</p><p> </p><p>He nodded and turned to sit down. The chair was rickety and extremely uncomfortable and he grimaced, wishing this place could invest in some high-quality cushions. He wondered how exactly prepared in equipment terms he was for this. Maybe he should have asked whether he needed his own lead or how long they would be but his shyness stopped him. He’d always been nervous and quiet, unless he was performing with a guitar in his hand. That was one of the reasons his parents had supported his guitar playing. It turned their cautious son into a more confident, talented version of himself for the time he was playing. </p><p> </p><p>As the minutes passed, his nerves built. To take his mind off the impending challenge his thoughts turned to the band he was about to try and join.</p><p> </p><p>One of the problems he’d immersed in his two days study time of the Marauders music was how distinctly middle class they were. On the front of their album, they wore clean white shirts, tight jeans and sneakers, as oppose to the black leather jacket and combat boots he was wearing. There lyrics too, oozed privilege and any real understanding of the common man, a complete culture reverse from the <em>The Ramones</em> and <em>The Clash</em>. Their lyrics were trying to be poetic, which wasn’t too bad, but it just didn’t work, it seemed to him. They needed to be more straight forward, they needed to say what they really felt, not tip toeing around it. It was perhaps why their debut had sold poorly, despite being alright music. The largely working-class punks and hard rock fans simply didn’t relate to them. Remus, as a poor south London boy, could perhaps offer this but it could also mean the band would not take him on as he did not fit with their image.</p><p> </p><p>Another problem, a good problem for Remus, was their guitar playing on the album, and also live when he went to see them last month, left a lot to be desired. It wasn’t awful but it wasn’t good. The main problem was that it didn’t fit with the rest of the instruments, as if the lead guitarist had been on a different page from everyone else in the band. In fact, the lead guitarist leaving had done them a favour he thought, though Remus might have to show the vocalist and rhythm guitarist a thing or two about guitar playing, as well.</p><p> </p><p>The bassist and drummer, on the other hand, were clearly excellent musicians and that was what kept the music going. The singer too, while his rhythm guitar could use some work, had a good voice and had been an enthralling frontman on stage.</p><p> </p><p>The door behind the desk suddenly opened to reveal an unusually huge man, with hair black as a night and a big bushy beard. His face was hard and lined with age, probably early forties, yet it also seemed to happy and cheerful. Indeed, by the large smile and the way he walked, Remus imagined he was generally a warm presence to be around. Even if he was a fucking giant.</p><p> </p><p>He was followed out by an average looking man in his early thirties and a tall, though not as tall as the black-haired giant before, thin woman. The man in his thirties was jumping excitedly from foot to foot and Remus noted he was rather small; a dwarf compared to the first man. A guitar case was clutched in his grasping fingers. The woman had her raven black hair pulled up into a tight bun and her thin, red lips were pulled into a straight line. Remus doubted she smiled a lot. Her dark brown eyes regarded him for a short, emotionless second before she pushed her way past the giant and lead the excitable man to the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, it was such an honour! It went well, wouldn’t you say?” The man was saying with a wide grin. “You’ll let me know, yeah? It was just fantastic. I thi-”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, you should get a call from our office within the next few days. Thank you for coming down, Mr Diggle.” The woman said in the same crisp voice from the phone call a few days earlier and Remus’ suspicions were confirmed. This was Minerva McGonagall.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, of course! It was such a-” But at that moment the door was slammed behind him by McGonagall, shutting the poor man out. The Marauders’ manager sighed in exasperation, then turned sharply on heel to face Remus. Her eyes narrowed slightly and Remus gulped under her fierce gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Lupin?” She asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Y-yes that’s, um, that’s me. Remus Lupin. Guitarist. Here to audition.” Remus became increasingly aware of the fact he was rambling. Not a good first impression.</p><p> </p><p>“Follow me.” McGonagall said promptly and walked past him into the door she had come out of thirty seconds before. The big man gave Remus a small wink and a large grin and then hurried to follow McGonagall, his big feet pounding on the solid wood floor.</p><p> </p><p>Shakily Remus stood up and followed the unlikely pair, making sure to ignore the bitchy look the receptionist gave him. He followed them down a long corridor and into a room on the right.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing Remus noticed when he entered the dingy room was how messy it was. Guitars and their cases were strewn across the room haphazardly. The old drum kit in the corner seemed to be made up of several different kits; red, blue and green drums mixed together, some Mapex, some Pearl. Wires criss-crossed all over the floor leading from instruments and the one solitary mike to the large amps lined along the walls. There were a few metal chairs, as uncomfortable looking as the ones in the reception, some of which were occupied.</p><p> </p><p>As Remus entered the room, McGonagall sat down on one of the chairs and crossed her legs, looking serious and stern. The large giant crossed the room to stand by the far wall next to a tall ginger man, who was leaned against the wall with his arms crossed. Behind the drums sat another ginger man who looked like he was the other guy’s twin and probably was, Remus realised. He wore his hair very long and was fiddling with drum sticks, looking tired but managed a small smile at Remus when he first saw him. Remus nodded back and turned his attention to the last two men in the room.</p><p> </p><p>The man closest to him wore a clean black shirt, that matched the colour of his dark hair. Hair which, Remus noticed, was unruly and all over the place. Whether it was intentional he didn’t know but it looked as though the man had just gotten off a roller coaster at the local fair Remus used to go to as a kid with his parents. Large round spectacles covered his hazel eyes and Remus recognised his grinning face as the frontman of The Marauders from when he’d went to see them.</p><p> </p><p>The last man in the room had long, deep brown hair, slightly covering a handsome, aristocratic face. He had a straight nose and bright white teeth. He stood tall and was well built, with strong muscles protruding from a white <em>Judas Priest</em> t-shirt. When Remus considered his eyes, he was met with striking, stormy grey eyes. The way he held himself portrayed a casual, haughty elegance. Everything about him screamed upper class, private schooled education. Unlike his bandmates, he did not acknowledge Remus in any way and kept his eyes fixed on the bass strapped to his chest, looking bored and uninterested.</p><p> </p><p>The black-haired, bespectacled man stepped towards Remus a large smile on his face and began to talk in a pronounced middle-class accent. “Hey, man what’s up? Remus, right?” Before waiting for answer he went on talking quickly, the charismatic grin still firmly etched on his face. “I’m James Potter, lead singer and rhythm guitar. This ruggedly handsome specimen behind the drums is Fabian Prewett, that’s his brother Gideon there trying to look cool. The man next to him is our own friendly giant, Rubeus Hagrid but call just call him Hagrid. They both work as our security guards and roadie crew. You’ve already met Minnie, o’ course, oh, and that’s Sirius Black, bassist extraordinaire, and expert sulker.”</p><p> </p><p>James finished off his confident introduction and looked expectantly at Remus. Fabian and Gideon rolled their eyes (yep, twins for sure), Hagrid continued grinning toothily, McGonagall frowned but looked at James with something akin to fondness in her usually cold eyes and Sirius was the only one who had no change in his demeanour and continued to glare lazily at his bass. James was still staring at Remus as if expecting him to say something.</p><p> </p><p>“Um… I’m Remus.” He mumbled simply. Fabian snorted at his short reply and Hagrid grinned even more at him. James did not seem put off, however.</p><p> </p><p>“How you have the energy for that introduction every person we audition, I have no idea.” Gideon said to James.</p><p> </p><p>“Lovely to meet you, Remus!” James called excitedly, ignoring him.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice to meet all of you too.”</p><p> </p><p>“Bane’s told me only good things, I hope you won’t prove him wrong Mr Lupin.” McGonagall said.</p><p> </p><p>“Er- I’ll try n-not to.” He really had to stop stuttering. “Bane’s great.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, if a bit odd.” McGonagall murmured.</p><p> </p><p>“The Star Gazers are certainly different but they’ve got some good numbers.” James reasoned. He had certainly showed himself to be the most sociable of the band in the two minutes since Remus had meet them.   </p><p> </p><p>“Can we just get this over with?” Sirius spoke for the first time, his posh voice layered with irritation. “I’d rather not spend my time talking about some wannabe glam rockers, who are about five years late.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus frowned deeply at the patronising bassist. While Glam may not be what it once was at this point, the Star Gazers weren’t specifically Glam Rock. Sure they had influences from <em>David</em> <em>Bowie</em> or <em>Lou Reed</em> but they were also heavy like<em> Mott the Hoople</em> crossed with <em>Black Sabbath</em>. If that was a thing. Remus concluded it almost definitely wasn’t. Rest assured, The  Star Gazers were an oddity.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a little ignorant, mate.” Fabian told Sirius casually, who only shrugged in return.</p><p> </p><p>“Er- right,” James began, his confident manner slipping for the first time and he turned to give Sirius a look Remus couldn’t quite see, “let’s began then shall we?”</p><p> </p><p>Remus nodded and lowered his guitar case carefully to the ground. He zipped it open and lifted up his 1974 Gibson Les Paul. It was a deep mahogany colour, perfectly maintained and it seemed, to Remus, to gleam in the relative darkness of the room but maybe that was a bit dramatic.</p><p> </p><p>James gave a low whistle when he saw it.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s a beauty. Must of cost a shit ton.” McGonagall tutted at his language and he shot her an apologetic look, although Remus doubted he was being sincere. He also reckoned McGonagall knew that from the hard scowl she was currently giving him.</p><p> </p><p>“Yep, saved up over a few years.” He told him.</p><p> </p><p>“Years?” James asked incredulously. He seemed disbelieving, another sign that he’d come from money.</p><p> </p><p>“Years.” Remus confirmed, nodding.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit.” James turned his attention to his own guitar, as if embarrassed, while Sirius did some last-minute tuning and Fabian sat back, waiting. Hagrid approached and offered Remus a thick guitar lead which Remus plugged in, after thanking the big roadie. He got a hearty thumbs up in response and he couldn’t help but grin to himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Just do your best.” James told Remus and without another word Fabian counted them in.</p><p> </p><p>They struck up the first song on Black Stag, Mischief Managed, one of their better songs. Remus studied the album in the days preceding the audition and he joined in on the next line, showing the band, he’d prepared for this, he knows this. He hit all the right notes (even if they were overly simple), bouncing off James and pushing him slightly. Remus played it slightly different from the album, making it more jagged but also more complicated, adding notes and small short solos here and there, making it clear to the band the calibre of guitar player he is. He had to improvise quickly at times, he only had a few days to prepare after all, but still managed to keep it going as James sings the last lyrics of the song and it’s time for the guitar solo.</p><p> </p><p>On the album the solo is simple, clean and quick. Remus decided against this. Instead he ripped into a solo of his own creation, which he feels is both more musically competent as well as fitting the song better. Sure it’s a bit rougher and edgier but that’s what Remus feels the band needs. His hands glided up and down the guitar, his fingers working effortlessly on the tough strings. During the solo he couldn’t resist showing them he also has a bit of a presence too, tapping his foot, twisting the guitar this way and that and nodding his head to the beat.</p><p> </p><p>When the song ended and the heavy reverb still filled their ears, Remus looked up to gauge the reception. James beamed manically, McGonagall watched him closely, Fabian smirked, Gideon nodded and Hagrid stared at him in what seemed to be awe. Sirius looked the same way he had done for the last ten minutes: unimpressed and indifferent.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit, that was great!” James gushed excitedly. “You know the notes but your playing it different, yeah? Almost better… you know?” Remus nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“I just added my own style, I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a very good guitarist.” Gideon remarked.</p><p> </p><p>“Thankyou.” There’s no point in denying it, although he did blush. James piped up to agree.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I mean, the way you-”</p><p> </p><p>“Lets just do a few more before we go singing any praises.” Sirius interrupted. James turned to give Sirius another look and Remus looked at the ground, the confidence he’d had while playing quickly vanishing.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine.” James said after a few moments. “Do you know Cloak of Invisibility?” He asked Remus, referencing another Marauders song. He just nodded.</p><p> </p><p>A few songs in and he began to fucking enjoy playing with these guys. Fabian is a great drummer, all manic and crazy with fantastic fills. You wouldn’t think he was keeping time but in his own way he was and he reminded Remus a little of Keith Moon, in that respect. Sirius was brilliant as well, playing everything perfectly, his pounding bass gave the music it’s heart and soul. He barely moved or changed his expression during the time they played but he seemed to radiate a powerful stage presence anyway. Together they made up a brilliantly powerful rhythm section.</p><p> </p><p>While James was a middling guitar player at best, he made up for it with his high vocal ability and sheer enthusiasm. His happy expression never faltered and he seemed to be able to pull the audience along with him for the ride and Remus found himself staring at James for much of their jam and couldn’t help laughing along with him.</p><p> </p><p>Time dragged on and when they ran out of The Marauders songs to play they turned to playing some well-known rock songs any decent musician should be able to play, <em>You Really Got Me</em> and <em>Wild Thing</em> among them. During the solo for <em>You Really Got Me</em> James came up to him and began to dance in front of him, probably trying put him off. Remus laughed, joined in dancing and still managed to hit the solo correctly.</p><p> </p><p>As they finished up a slightly weird, somehow metal, version of <em>(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction</em>, Remus saw James and Fabian share a look and McGonagall turned to Remus.</p><p> </p><p>“Thankyou for coming, Mr Lupin. We’ll be in touch soon. ” It was a bit sudden and his heart sank but he nodded and shook hands with everyone in there, even Sirius.</p><p> </p><p>“Seriously, mate, that was fucking ace. You’ll definitely hear from us.” James said as Remus exited the room quietly, guitar case strapped to his back.</p><p> </p><p>James’ words lifted his spirits slightly and he knew he’d performed well. They’d all seemed impressed anyway, except Sirius whatever the hell that guy’s problem was. But surely if the rest of the band wanted him, than that would overrule their surly bassist? If there rest of the band did really want him, of course.</p><p> </p><p>Remus pushed the complicated thoughts about his future Marauders career out his head as he passed the bitchy receptionist and exited the studios. He’d done all he could, now it was up to the Marauders.</p><p> </p>
