    <p>Chapter 1 – Prologue</p><p>	           “Good luck, Freya Potter”</p><p>Petunia Durlsey opened the front door and found a tiny baby girl on her doorstep, she put the bundle down on the couch and went back to making breakfast. The girl was so quiet petunia forgot about her until Vernon came down and shouted </p><p>	          “What the devil is this?”</p><p>	           “It’s a baby, she was on the doorstep, I couldn’t leave her out there to freeze to death, I think she’s lily’s” petunia replied </p><p>	            “So, is she a freak like them? If she is I don’t want her in this house!!” </p><p>	            “I won’t knowingly throw a kid out onto the street!!” she met his voice levels and soon woke up Dudley.</p><p>Petunia went to pick up Dudley and came back with the clingy baby but couldn’t put him down so held him as they argued.</p><p>	            “I will not have one of them in this house! I thought we were finished with them?”</p><p>	            “Fine, we keep her until she starts to do anything?, okay?” </p><p>	            “Fine, did she come with anything?”</p><p>	            “No, just a letter but if we aren’t keeping her should we open it?”</p><p>	             “Good thinking maybe not”</p><p>They dispersed, Vernon and Dudley went for breakfast and Petunia went to find some small clothes of Dudley’s and a belt to make sure it stayed up on the small child. The girl stayed silent as Petunia re dressed her and wrapped the blanket back around her. Petunia left her on the couch, she stayed there the whole day and didn’t make a noise once.</p><p> </p><p>	                 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ </p><p> </p><p>A year past and nothing happened. On Freya’s birthday she woke up in her cupboard and made herself some candles to blow out. They appeared in front of her face and she blew them out wishing herself a happy birthday. Petunia opened the door to change her and saw the candles before they disappeared. She screamed for Vernon.</p><p>	               “What’s the matter?” he shouted</p><p>	               “It’s happened, she did something!!”</p><p>	               “Get her out of this house, you know what to do, just write her name and birthday on a piece of paper like we discussed!”</p><p>Petunia got to work, she grabbed the two year old and bundled her up tight in her blanket (the same one she came in), and she grabbed a notepad and wrote ‘Freya Potter, 31st July’. She taped the note to the blanket and grabbed the car keys. </p><p>	                “I’m going now Vernon, look after Dudley”</p><p>	                “See you later”</p><p>Petunia left and locked the door behind her, put the bundle in the backseat and got the seatbelt so that It didn’t move around too much. The drive took a few hours but soon Petunia was in London and driving up to a bland orphanage building in the Centre of London. Mrs. Burbages home for boys and girls was where petunia left the bundle of blankets and drove home without a backwards glance.</p><p>The door to the orphanage opened and the matron brought the small child in. Little did Petunia know but she just let the savior of the wizarding world move away from the blood protections that would protect Freya Potter if she lived with the Dursleys.</p>
