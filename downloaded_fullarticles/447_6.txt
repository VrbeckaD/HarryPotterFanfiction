  <em>"Harry!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"SIRIUS!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As he fell through the veil, arms outstretched to grab onto his godson's, he couldn't help but think about all he'd missed out on in the boy's life.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His first steps. First words. First bout of accidental magic. First time on a broom. First act of mischief. A lot of firsts. He'd promised to take care of Lily and James's child and he failed. It taken him thirteen years to get back to him and yet he couldn't stay with him. Thirteen years of anguish. Of torture and insanity. Thirteen years of barely hanging on only to lose it all when it was just in reach. Was this punishment for his Maruader days or his family's sins? Or had he'd pissed off some god in a past life?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Finally, he was completely through the veil. It felt strange. His chest and limbs felt as if they'd been hit full on by a bludger, but at the same time he had this sense of weightlessness. His vision grew darker and darker as his life seemed to pass before his eyes. This was it. This was the end.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>" Lilly. James. I'm coming."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With that his eyes closed shut.</em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Yawn.</em>
</p><p>Silky black ears twitched at the noise before settling again. They twitched again when a soft thump followed by the padding of feet across hardwood moved towards him. Feeling a soft stroking motion on his head, a red eye cracked open lazily watching the owner of the hand. A pale face with large green eyes and beautiful red hair greeted him.</p><p>" Good morning Ruth. Did you sleep well?"</p><p>With a long stretch and content sigh, a cloud of black smoke briefly surrounded the girl before settling on the ground next to in the shape of a handsome male with ruby eyes and wavy black hair. He tilted his head and allowed the female to continue her ministrations.</p><p>" I slept well Chise. What about you? Last night you were tossing about. <em>Ah!</em> That's the spot."</p><p>Leaning into the touch, Ruth waited patiently for Chise's response.</p><p>"It wasn't anything. I just had a nightmare. I thought… I think… I would think I saw your dad, but I know you were originally a dog. It's just that he'd looked so much like you but older and a part of me just couldn't help but fear it was you. I mean, he fell through this thing and this boy was calling out to him and I saw everything through his eyes and it was just… The important thing is that you're alright."</p><p>Ruth looked up at her and wondered if she'd had the same dream as him. It sounded a lot like she was remembering his death. Or at least Sirius's death. But he didn't see how. Remained silent as she continued to pat his silky locks, ruby staring at emeralds that looked elsewhere. As he studied her features, he noticed a strong resemblance to someone he knew in his past. Not Isabel. No, someone further back.</p><p>Lily Potter.</p><p>With her brilliant green eyes and red hair, he looked a lot like the fiery witch. But there were differences that made it obvious it wasn't her. Her hair was thicker and textured like Harry's had been. And her face had the same roundness as Harry's. But she wasn't Harry. She was Chise.</p><p>And that was all he needed.</p><p>The petting stopped. Chise has fallen back asleep, her nightmare having taken more out of her han he thought. With a gentle smile, he picked her up and tucked her back in before turning back into his dog form and sleeping at her feet.</p><p>This was his mistress and he was her familiar. They would be together till the end of her days. Nothing would stop him from watching his charge.</p><p>Not even Death…</p><p> </p>
