    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry hated Draco Malfoy or that is what he thought. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It all started on their 6th year of Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. It was December and it was almost time for everyone to go home for Christmas with their families. Harry not having a family he gets invited to go with the Weasley’s. But Draco Malfoy on the other hand has a family to go home to but doesn’t feel safe there at least not right now. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When the day comes when everyone is leaving to go back to their homes, Draco is left all alone. Blaise and Pansy were is good friends and they had decided that they were going to be with their family for Christmas. Harry feeling some sort of pity for the blonde decides to stay with him and try to make friends with him. Draco and Harry were the only two that are staying home there plus some of the teachers in the castle. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oi, Malfoy, what are you doing here?” Harry asked kinda interested about the answer. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“None of your business Potter. Why are you here?” Draco scoffed. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">“Just wondering Malfoy because we are going to spend Christmas together her in the castle all by ourselves” it’s true they are the only students there.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well why did it have to be you of all the people I’m stuck with?” Draco clearly didn’t want to deal with Potter right now. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Malfoy you don’t have to be so rude.” Harry said as he walked away from Malfoy. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oi Potter get back here I’m not through with you.” Harry heated Draco scream this and other death threats to him. Harry heads up the stairs to go to the Gryffindor commons to do his homework. He gets dressed in his pajamas and then lays in his bed for a while. <em>It’s going to be a long Christmas </em>he thought as he drifted into a sleep.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p1"> Draco was left stunned of what just happened besides yelling death threats at Harry. When Harry was gone he sat down properly to think. <em>Did Potter just try and make a conversation with me? </em>That made Draco turn into a lovely light shade of pink. He was thought he was lucky that no one else saw him blush at that thought. The truth was that Draco didn’t hate Potter not at all but he has to act like that because he is consumed by trying to be perfect in his parents eyes. As the years he tried being perfect to his parents he hating Potter, rude to the weasels, and most importantly being a racist piece of shit. That still didn’t help with the love that he wanted to feel that love that he craved more than anything. He wanted someone to give it all to him and never let him go. He wanted someone to love him for who he was and not the shit that his parents created. Getting up from his seat that he was sitting in and he left the room that he was in just to walk around the castle. He didn’t know where he was walking he just knew that he will know when he gets there.  </p>
