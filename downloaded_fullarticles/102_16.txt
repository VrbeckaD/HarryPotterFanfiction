    <p>“Tilt the broom up –UP – you little snot – child – Dammit PADFOOT.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius ignored the rebuke, continuing to charm the broom in front of him so that the small rider atop it couldn’t steer it upward.  “You shouldn’t swear in front of the little ones, James. Whatever would Lily think?”</p><p> </p><p>James whipped back, his head moving from left to right so quickly Sirius could hear his neck <em>crick. </em>“Lily? Is she here?”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius snorted. “No, you dolt. I do think the toddlers are getting away from you though.”</p><p> </p><p>Sure enough, two of the children had dismounted their brooms and were using them to whack the remaining riders off; the rest of them had drifted far away enough that James could no longer shout instruction at them; one had found a way to make his broomstick dance to the tune of every Celestina Warbeck song. James shuddered, momentarily distracted at the thought of the horrors that had befallen the small child. The rider Sirius’ charm had been blocking, however, was focused solely on Sirius, glaring at his from atop his uncooperative broomstick.</p><p> </p><p>“Three-foot-and-unders, assemble!”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius barked with laughter as the children proceeded to ignore James, despite his commanding Captain-of-the-Quidditch-team voice. A dark haired girl who had just been whacked off her broom actually blew a raspberry at him, which the other children thought was the height of comedy. Peals of laughter could be heard along the pitch.</p><p> </p><p>James looked crestfallen. Sirius almost felt bad for the bloke – it couldn’t be good for his self-esteem to be so resolutely ignored. You’d think that he’d be used to it by now, with five and a half solid years of Lily turning her nose up at him. Children loved Sirius, though, he’d bet that he could have had the whole lot of them eating out of his hand in minutes. He bit his tongue before the remark about Lily slipped through; things had just started to get back to normal. The last thing he wanted was to upset James, and mentioning Lily was a surefire way to do so.</p><p> </p><p>Unbidden, his eyes sought out the stands in which Remus was nestled with his books. Remus had so far been watching James attempt to manage the young wizards and witches with great amusement, shouting advice from the stands. So far, the advice had been directed at the kids on how best to rile James up and had been catastrophically effective. The barely suppressed glee on Remus’ face was delightful after months of strained conversation. Strain Sirius had put there.</p><p> </p><p>His thoughts must have shown on his face because James momentarily gave up shouting orders and clasped his shoulder instead, saying as he did so, “Reckon I can summon the lot and stuff them in bags for their parents to collect?”</p><p> </p><p>Eternally grateful, Sirius rolled his eyes, “Only if you want the love of your life to chase you down the hall and call you a ‘toerag’, again.”</p><p> </p><p>So much for biting his tongue. James simply roared with laughter though, mussing up his hair and smacking Sirius on the head.</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t have that,” said James cheerfully, even as he charmed enormous neon stop signs to appear next to each kid. “Can’t have them riding brooms for any longer either. They’re defiling the Noble Sport and by Godric, I’m a second away from strangling that one.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius looked at the small, black haired boy gleefully zooming behind one of the children who had previously been thwacking the other kids off their brooms. They had all ignored the charmed signs, which were rapidly losing their flashy colour.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, but Prongs, my stag,” said Sirius sagely, “that’s because you didn’t have half his talent at twice his age.”</p><p> </p><p>James gave him a wounded look, but Sirius could see the relief and happiness simmering. This was almost <em>normal, </em>could things really be back to the way they used to be? His eyes sought Remus for confirmation, but Remus was pointedly looked away, pretending he hadn’t been watching them. Sirius felt the air rush out of his lungs, the heaviness in the pit of his stomach all he was aware of.</p><p> </p><p>By the time he had steeled himself, James’ glasses had been stolen by the black haired prodigy; James seemed to have forgotten he was a wizard, opting to chase the kid instead of summoning the glasses. Sirius couldn’t help but risk a glance at Remus, whom he’d normally trade an exasperated look with at this point. He nearly yelped – Remus was standing barely half a foot away from him.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius shuffled his feet. “All right there, Moo-Remus?”</p><p> </p><p>Remus nodded his head, quickly and awkwardly. His eyes flickered at Sirius’ hair and the ghost of a smile appeared in his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>By Salazar. No, Gryffindor. No, Godric. Bollocks, why couldn’t he just say the right thing. Or at least think it. And then say it.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Remus! Oi, REMUS! Get these devils off me.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus didn’t seem perturbed by James’ yells. He was scribbling something in that notebook of his, not speaking to Sirius or responding to James. Sirius sighed in his head. He knew he was going to have to be patient, but it was taking all he had to not drop to his knees and beg and yell until Moony either hit him or yelled at him. Remus now, not Moony.</p><p> </p><p><em>I’m never going to be Moony. Never again. </em>That was all he had said about what had happened with Snivellus. Snape now, not Snivellus. <em> And you can’t call him Snivellus. I owe him everything. I couldn’t bear it. </em>Sirius had wished he could rip his soul from his body and present it to Moony, show him that the core of his very being repented. Not about <em>Snivellus, </em>the voice in his head sneered. About Moony, about hurting him, making him feel like he owed anyone anything, about taking something away from him. <em>You’ll be Moony again if it’s the last thing I manage</em>, Sirius vowed silently, <em>but I will manage it.</em></p><p> </p><p>“Remus, Pads, I’m begging.” The children were playing catch with his glasses now.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius wished he could beg.</p><p> </p><p>“Lily will never talk to me again.” James appeared to be wrestling with a kid hovering in mid-air.</p><p> </p><p>Moony would never talk to him again as Moony.</p><p> </p><p>“Argh-”</p><p> </p><p>He should be the one who suffered, now and forever. Not Moony. Never Moony.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius’ tortured gaze was reflected in Remus’ eyes. Dark black eyes stared into light brown ones and for a moment, both were frozen, unwilling and unable to look away. Remus drew his wand, almost casually. Sirius felt the thrill of anticipation sweep over his body; he closed his eyes and hoped it would hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“Last one to the Great Hall doesn’t get any Frogs!” Remus’ wand was pointed at his throat; his voice resounded across the pitch. Grim understanding shadowed his face.</p><p> </p><p>Squeals of excitement greeted this announcement. Barely a moment later, the pitch was deserted. Abandoned broomsticks were littered all over the field along with a James with uncharacteristically hunched shoulders, twigs in his hair, and dirt-smeared glasses. Shaking his head, he made his way to the two of them, muttering to himself the whole while.</p><p> </p><p>“Good practice?” Remus’ lips twitched.</p><p> </p><p>“I hope that’s put you off kids permanently,” Sirius interjected, his voice louder and more cheerful than he’d intended.</p><p> </p><p>“Nah, mate. Mine will know how to play a real match and follow instructions. Not like these amateurs,” scoffed James. “They’ll have my hair and dashing looks and Lily’s wit and her eyes and her Potions skills.”</p><p> </p><p>James spirits had returned astoundingly fast.</p><p> </p><p>“Potions skills?” snorted Sirius.</p><p> </p><p>“They have to get in the Slug Club and carry on their parents’ tradition of exposing Slug for the fraud he is.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think Lily gets along with Professor Slughorn well enough,” said Lupin mildly.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, but she’s sly, that one. Always does it so only the best of us can see.” And with those insightful but meaningless words, he slung an arm over both their shoulders and together, the three walked off the field and to the Great Hall, Sirius’ rainbow-coloured hair glinting in sun.</p>
