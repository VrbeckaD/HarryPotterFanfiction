    <p>It began with a storm. Not just any kind, either. A storm in the middle of a country wide drought. A storm in a place where no plants grow, and even weeds can’t flourish. A storm caused by, of all things, a bird. </p><p>The locals couldn’t explain it, and when things go well, people don’t question the good fortune. All they knew was that one day, a group of four strangely attired men showed up and observed the small village. They took in the well constructed homes, the dirty well, and the root vegetables that grew slowly, but strongly. They took in the people, who despite the misfortune of the ground they stood on, wore exquisite clothes made of fine fabrics, adorned with fine shined jewels. </p><p>The men left, and when they came back, they came with a miracle of miracles.</p><p>It’s best to start with how we got here.</p><p>This group of men, adorned in odd clothing of their own, took notice that of all things purchasable in this place, clean water was not one. All the money in the world couldn’t help with that kind of no-maj struggle. Even if they knew who to speak to, there was always human bureaucrats who advised against that sort of thing, who would make it more difficult for these people than needed. But these four men (who were also, unbeknownst to the villagers, four wizards) had a solution. </p><p>Outcasted by wizarding society, the group of four were squibs. Unable to produce magic of their own, they learned non-magic ways to adapt. Where there wasn’t <i>Lumos</i>, there was torches. Where there wasn’t <i>Stupefy</i>, there was tranquilizer. Where there wasn’t <i>Incarcerous</i>, there were cages. And so, these men, native to a small American state known as Arizona, had devised a way for them to make a little bit of no-maj money. America itself had gone through a recession after all, who were they to ignore an opportunity?</p><p>Now, the four squib wizards knew of something called a Thunderbird, and knew of its magical properties. They knew, that in the ‘right’ hands, this creature could be very profitable. And not only that, it’s a creature that could be taken away, were they to not receive sufficient gratitude (read: payment) for bringing it around. </p><p>They arrived in Arizona a few weeks after their visit to the village. The plan was to scour the land in search of this mighty beast and to bring the group together when they found it using their given owls. They brought rations and tranquilizer rifles, and were only able to bring one cage due to its size. They each went their separate ways- Thurzenby to the North, Jayre to the East, Fettel to the West (with the cage), and Matthew to the South.</p><p>Thurzenby considered himself the leader of the group, having coordinated the travel to and from the countries. In his eyes this bird was his salvation. Of all the time he spent being ostracized by his family for not having any usable magic, he was sent off to a lesser-known non-magic wizard school, though some would say it was more like an asylum for families to hide their so-called ‘dirty’ secrets.</p><p>It was at this so-called school that Thurzenby met the other three. Jayre, Fettel, and Matthew. Jayre considered himself the leader, having come up with the plan to capture the Thunderbird. The others didn’t know, but he gave himself to the asylum after running from home. He was determined to find more non-magic wizards like himself. His parents always used the place as a threat, but never actually sent him away, so he figured it’d be best if he did it himself.</p><p>Now Fettel, who, of course, considered himself the leader due to his brutality, was desperate to make money from this work. In a night of regretted vulnerability, he told Thurzenby that he needed the money so he could buy a house far from any civilized society, to protect not just himself, but the others around him.</p><p>Finally, there was Matthew who, of course, considered Thurzenby as the leader because he figured himself a better follower, rather than a leader. He just wanted the money to try to live well among the muggles, and to forget the wizarding world as a whole.</p><p>It ended up being Matthew who caught the first sighting, after an old man on a decrepit farm told him a magic bird was raining on his sheep. He owled the others, but by the time it got sent out, Thurzenby caught sight of the Thunderbird in the North. He trailed alongside it riding a stolen horse, watching the sky until the Thunderbird came down.</p><p>Keeping his distance from it, making subtle attempts at stealth. He trailed it to a river where he saw it lower itself. A drink? Some food? Regardless this would be his chance. He took the rifle down from his shoulder. Slowly, surely, he gave himself the proper distance to get a shot off. Aiming, tightening his grip to the rifle, aiming over the rock landscapes and dry brush, the scope revealing to him that it was, in fact, the right prey.</p><p>Squeeze. Bang!</p><p>Thurzenby sent out his owl, informing them all that the creature had been put to sleep, and for Fettel to bring the cage. It only took a day before they arrived. Thurzenby having to re-tranquilize the bird when it would stir. He hid under a cliff face by a river, and each night, as he heard the birds’ noises in his sleep, he thought about how much they’d be able to make from this whole scheme.</p><p>The other three arrived in the same day, and Fettel carted the cage behind him. The bird was unfortunately bigger than anticipated, so they really had to squeeze him into it, making sure its wings were tight on its side.</p><p>It was at this point that they’d allowed it to wake. They looked at it’s open eyes as it looked back. It began to shake, and stir, and try to move, but with the lack of space in the cage it could only quiver before them.</p><p>They told each other that it was just an animal, that the money would make it worth it. And though they didn’t obviously think the bird could hear them, the more they spoke, the more the skies greyed and stormed with fury. They wrapped the cage in canvas, hoping it would dull the tempest, but it did no good. It didn’t matter what the bird saw, just that it was backed into a corner and needed to react. The sun was long gone and the thunder shook the whole state. Rain, lightning, even hail. They did their best to ignore this, just to make it to the boat waiting for them on the coast.</p><p>It didn’t take a whole lot of money to bribe themselves and their cargo on to a boat originally. The sailing was supposed to be smooth, but that’s for good weather that’s planned, not bad weather that’s a reaction. The first few nights were awful, the waves rocked the boat, and the crew became frightened as they noticed the storm clouds only following their boat. The captain had to approach them and ask if they understood what was going on. All the “I’m not saying that it’s you” and “You understand the cost of risk” meant a little further greasing of the palms.</p><p>Matthew, one quiet night, snuck up alongside the cage. Lifting the canvas to see the still shaken Thunderbird. He reached out to try and calm it, like the dogs he had when he was a boy, but the bird only got angrier; making attempts claw and bite at him. Matthew explained to him that all this fury and storming would only mean the Thunderbirds death, that it would only harm him. The storm stayed, but in the days that followed it lessened, and just became heavy, grey skies that only drizzled.</p>
