    <hr/><p>     Harry slowly regained consciousness, groaning as he felt himself laying on a cold and hard floor. He shifted slightly in discomfort and slowly opened his eyes, wincing at the brightness that filled the room he was in; both the walls and the floor were pure white. He looked down at himself, not wanting to force his weak body to stand up just yet, and proceeded to flush slightly as he realised he was completely naked. Well, at least he was alone.</p><p>     "I'm glad to see that you're finally awake, Master."</p><p>     ... Or maybe not.</p><p>     Harry quickly reached down to cover himself, awkwardly glancing up at the black, shadowy figure that had suddenly materialized in front of him. For a second, Harry thought he was staring at a dementor, but he quickly shook that thought away; dementors didn't talk.</p><p>     "Um... Who are you? And where am I?" Harry remembered what he did before he had blacked out, "Am I dead?"</p><p>     "Well, to answer your first question, I am Death. Also known as the Grim Reaper, or whatever the mortals have taken to calling me these days. You are currently in the place between life and death. So no, technically you are not dead just yet, Master."</p><p>     Harry's eyebrows scrunched up in confusion, "Why do you keep calling me 'Master'?"</p><p>     Death appeared to tilt it's head to the side, it was hard to tell with the hood that the tall being was wearing. Harry couldn't even see Death's face, as the hood was casting dark shadows over it.</p><p>     "You became the master of all three of my Hallows during your lifetime, that makes you Master of Death. It is only proper that I call you by your title."</p><p>     Harry frowned, finally sitting up now that he was sure he would be able to hold up his own weight without collapsing, "But I dropped the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest, and I've never even held the Elder Wand, so how could I have become their master?"</p><p>     "You became their master because even though you dropped the Stone, you were still the last person to use it, thus it's allegiance was with you at the moment of your mortal body's death. And you became the master of the Elder Wand when you disarmed Draco Malfoy at Malfoy Manor, as the boy himself had become it's master when he had disarmed Albus Dumbledore in the Astronomy Tower the night he was killed."</p><p>     Harry nodded thoughtfully, but then a look of confusion came over his face,  "I thought you said I wasn't dead?"</p><p>     Death sighed, "See, this is where it gets complicated Master." Death looked around the empty room, then waved a skeletal hand and conjured two comfy looking chairs for itself and Harry, "Here — have a seat; I doubt the ground is a very comfortable place to sit."</p><p>     Harry glanced down at his naked body and flushed again, "Um... Death, could I have some clothes or something...?"</p><p>     "Oh, right." Death said, sounding like it had just remembered that Harry was naked. It snapped it's bony fingers and a dark red robe appeared on Harry.</p><p>     Harry muttered his thanks and slowly stood up and moved to settle himself into one of the chairs as Death sat in the one opposite. Harry sighed in relief as he settled down, enjoying the change from the floor.</p><p>     "Okay. Now," Death started; Harry looked up to pay attention, "As I have already informed you, you are currently in between life and death, or more accurately, your soul is. Your... <em>actions</em> however, proved fatal for your mortal body. So while you are <em>technically</em> deceased, I am holding your soul back from entering the afterlife." </p><p>     "But why aren't you letting me go?" Harry asked, a bit upset, "The whole reason why I committed was so that I could join my friends and family; why are you stopping me from joining them?"</p><p>     "Because Master, I wanted to explain to you what options you currently have. Being my master is more than just a fancy title — you do have benefits because of it."</p><p>     "Okay... So what are my... <em>options</em> then?" Harry asked reluctantly, sure that he would still choose to join his loved ones in the afterlife.</p><p>     "Well, Option One is that you go on to the 'Next Great Adventure'." Death quoted Albus Dumbledore fondly, "Option Two is that I restore your mortal body and you return to the moment of your death and continue on your life from that point — and yes I realise that you ended your life for a reason, but it's still an option." Death stopped Harry before he could interrupt. "Option Three is that I restore your mortal body, but instead of going back to the moment of your death, I'll send you back in time to the height of the First Wizarding War against the Dark Lord Voldemort. I would personally recommend that you take Option Three Master — I truly believe that you could change the future for the better, and save the lives of your loved ones while you're at it." Death finished sincerely.</p><p>     Harry gaped at the dark figure sitting before him.</p><p>     "... Are you serious?"</p><p>     "No Master, I'm Death"</p><p>     Harry snorted in amusement despite himself, shaking his head in disbelief.</p><p>     "But... Isn't time traveling really dangerous? What if I accidentally prevent my own birth or something?"</p><p>     "Master, I can ensure you a successful trip into the past, and once you time travel, the timeline will split into two from the moment you land in the past, making it impossible for you to return to the present. You'll have to make a new life for yourself in the new timeline. And even if you prevent your birth, <em>you</em> will not cease to exist since you will be from a different timeline. I hope that that isn't a problem for you...?"</p><p>     Harry gave Death a deadpan look. "I <em>killed myself </em>Death. My old life is over, and I don't want it back. A new start would be... <em>Amazing."</em></p><p>     Death inclined it's head, "Of course, Master."</p><p>     "What will happen to my timeline if I travel to the past?" Harry asked curiously after a moment of silence.</p><p>     "I was thinking about just putting an end to that timeline; with the way things are going, the muggles will end up destroying all life on Earth anyway with their atomic weapons. I can transfer all the souls from that timeline into the new one, so you can be reassured that the people you will meet in the new timeline are still the same people that you know, they'll just have different life experiences once you start changing things." </p><p>     Harry nodded in acceptance. "Okay, I've decided." He smiled at Death, "I'll go to the past. It's too good of an opportunity to pass up."</p><p>     Death clapped it's hands together happily, "Excellent! You won't regret this Master."</p><p>     "Do you absolutely have to call me Master?"</p><p>     "Yes Master."</p><p>     "... Alright then. Let's do this!"</p>
