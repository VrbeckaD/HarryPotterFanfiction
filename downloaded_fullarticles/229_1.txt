    <p>It had been a normal night. He had gone out for a walk in the woods around the manor, and had been aimlessly strolling for almost an hour when he heard a bush rustling. This in and of itself was abnormal. No animals lived in these woods. He had, when he first started taking walks, developed a habit of chasing down and killing bucks, just because he got bored. Not long after they all left. (Huh, might be some cause-and-effect there.) He slowly stalked towards the bush the rustling had come from, drawing his gun. He crouched and shoved aside a branch with the barrel, and took in a sharp breath. Curled up in the dirt, with her leg stuck in a bear trap, was a small girl, no more than four. She had passed out, and was incredibly pale, likely due to the amount of odd-smelling blood pooled around her. The blood smelled…familiar, like clove and nutmeg and vanilla, with a pinch of lavender on top of the usual coppery scent. She was whimpering, and blood continued to sluggishly trickle out of the wound. Just as he was about to take a closer look, his phone buzzed. He yanked it out and answered, sounding grim.</p><p>“Sir Integra, what is it?”</p><p>“Where the bloody hell are you? You’ve been out far longer than usual.”</p><p>“We have a slight issue.”</p><p>“What. Did. You. Do?” She asked.</p><p>“This time, it wasn’t me. There’s a kid in the woods. She got her leg caught in one of the security-bear-traps.”</p><p>“The <em>what</em>?”</p><p>“Walter and I set up bear traps in the woods for…security purposes. And a small human has gotten caught in one. I’m going to break the chain and carry her and the trap back. She’ll need a doctor; she’s lost a lot of blood. Smells weird, too. Aaaanyway, I’m gonna run her back to the house. Bye!” He hung up and stuffed his phone in his pocket, before grabbing the chain and lifting it up to his mouth. He positioned it on his molars and chomped down, spitting out the links that got caught in his fangs. He scooped the small girl into his arms and stepped back, before jogging to the manor. Alucard stopped at the front door right as Walter pulled it open.</p><p>“Alucard, the doctor is waiting in the medical bay.” The butler stepped aside, letting the vampire run past, and sighing at the blood that splashed onto the carpet. That would be a bitch to clean.</p><p>X0X0X</p><p>She awoke in a room that reminded her of when she would tag along to Dudley’s doctor appointments. The ceiling was plain white, and the cot she was lying on was stiff. There was a blanket pulled up to her neck, and a soft beeping from next to her. She tried to carefully roll her ankles and yelped at the sudden pain in her left calf and thigh. She slowly reached one arm up and flipped the blanket down, gasping when she saw the bandages wrapped around her leg. Her leg was under at least five layers of wrappings, and her head was fuzzy. The last thing she remembered was running from Dudley and his gang. She had tripped and smacked her head, and when she woke up it was dark. She had wandered for a bit, only to find herself lost in the woods. She remembered a sharp pain in her leg, and then nothingness. She whipped her head about, only to freeze when she saw the needle sticking out of her arm. She followed the tubing with her eyes, and frowned when she failed to read the label on the bag of fluids. Whoever put her here must have taken off her glasses. The door opened, admitting a man with graying hair and smile lines.</p><p>“Good to see you awake, kid!” He said, striding towards the foot of the bed. “My name is Doctor James Osborn, I’m the one who wrapped that leg of yours. Can you tell me how old you are and what your name is?”</p><p>X0X0X</p><p>James Osborn’s family had been working for the Hellsing Organization for three hundred years. He was ready for anything, in his mind. His mind, however, rather froze at the small child’s words.</p><p>“I believe I’m seven, sir. My family says my name is ‘Freak’, but Mrs. Fig, my babysitter, says my name is Holly. The bats and snakes call me ‘Lady Dracul’. I like that one best. Do you know where my glasses are?” The girl discussed what was likely a case of abuse, a neighbor who wanted to help, and talking to animals, as if she was merely stating that the sky was blue.</p><p>“Well then,” He decided after a moment. “’Lady Dracul’ is a bit of a mouthful, so I’ll call you Holly for now. I’m afraid that when you were found in the woods, you didn’t have on any glasses, nor where there any around you. We can get you a new pair made, but in the meantime, don’t be afraid to ask for help.”</p><p>“Okay.” The girl nodded. “May I have a glass of water? My throat is horribly dry.”</p><p>“Of course, Holly! Now,” He handed her a small paper cup that looked almost normal sized in her small hands. “do you know someone we can call to come get you?” she sipped slowly at the water and shook her head. Ho</p><p>“No, sir. I don’t know my relatives phone number, Aunt sent me out of the room when she taught Cousin.”</p><p>“Hmmm.” That…<em>might</em> pose a problem. “Do you know any of their names?”</p><p>“No, sir. Just Uncle, Aunt, and Cousin. Mrs. Fig is just Mrs. Fig, I’m afraid, she never told me her first name. Does this mean I can’t be sent back?” There was a touch too much hope in that statement to be normal.</p><p>“Well, it means we may face a challenge. For now, you’ll be staying here.” The girl smiled a little. At least the poor dear was happy.</p><p>X0X0X</p><p>In his room in the basement, Alucard thought. The child’s blood had reeked of magic and something…<em>other</em>. The magic meant she was probably born to a mundane. No pureblood would ever let a child roam so far from home without a tracking charm on them, not with how rare pureblooded children had become in the last century. That was one issue Sir Integra was keeping a rather close eye on. Now, if only he could remember why that <em>other</em> smelled so damn <strong>familiar…</strong></p>
