          <div class="userstuff"><p> </p><p>The wind screamed past me as I rose higher and higher into the air, carried by a massive bearer of grief and destruction that had held doom for so many before me. I knew I was a goner.</p><p>Hullo. My name is Gray 3-2521. However, you may call me Carl. I am a flobberworm, among the last of my kind. I live in a glass prison where, everyday, many of my kind are buried…whether dead or alive. And now, I was facing my own doom. My jailkeeper stared me in the eye. I was going to die.</p><p>"What a bore," said my captor, and dropped me back into my prison. I lay on the soft soil, devastated. My fellow flobberworms, even my wife Blue 6-3054, would not come near me. Even though I had escaped death for now, there was still the chance that I had been infected by a very contagious disease called…Humanitosis.</p><p>My friend, Red 7-1439(I called him Bob), was the first to catch it. He was infected with humanitosis when he was handled by the evil pink-skinned demons. Bob, too, was thrown down as I had been, but he did not survive. He slowly began to turn a sickly shade of peach and then, one day, he stopped moving. He had died, leaving two hundred children without a daddy! Excuse me one moment as I cry.</p><p>I slowly inched my way back to my lettuce home. I nibbled on the green wall, a plan forming in my mind of how to gain revenge on the evil pink skinned demons.</p><hr/><p>Today, I would exact my revenge. I had the perfect plan. Sort of. When my captor came to snatch me unwillingly from my home, and raised me again to his, I would insult him from afar. Actually, it wasn't that far for him, but it was far for me!</p><p>"You human!" I cried from my position on the great plain of the demon's claws. "You horrible, unflobberworm-like creature!" My captor, however, seemed totally unfazed by this attack on his person. Not knowing what else to do, I bit him, and hard! Never mind that I don't have teeth! I would cause him pain for tormenting my friends and family so. No more would have we have to suffer at his hand. Hands. Hand? Never mind.</p><p>"Is it trying to bite me?" I heard my captor say.</p><p>"Yes!" I wanted to scream. "Feel the pain and sorrow of an entire race!"</p><p>"Can't be," a second pink-skinned demon said. "It doesn't have teeth." It was then that I knew that they had me surrounded.</p><p>Suddenly, I was flung carelessly aside. Every particle of air seemed like many particles of air as I fell back into my prison. Finally, my crippled body hit the ground, dust flying into the air. But I would not let this get me down. For I am a flobberworm, and I <em>will </em>prevail.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>"I think this one's dead," one of the pink-skinned demons said, pointing at me.</p><p>"I'm not dead!" I roared. It was hopeless. They did not care for me.</p><p>"Nah, its tail is still twitching," a demon said.</p><p>I painfully got up and made my way to my humble abode, where my wife(I call her Mary) waited, cooking dinner for our three hundred sons and one daughter.</p><p>"Oh, you're hurt," she said in a long-suffering voice.</p><p>"I think I have humanitosis," I sobbed.</p><p>Her eyes welled up with tears as she pointed me in the direction of my room. There I stayed, so I would not infect the remaining members of my species. Especially my three hundred sons. And one daughter, Violet 0-5000, who I call Sue.</p><p>I suffered greatly. I could see my skin taking on a sickly shade of pink. My body shuddered with pain as the humanitosis took over my body. It hurt. Oh, how it hurt!</p><p>Then, one day, the pain stopped. Suddenly stopped, just like that. It was a miracle! I was saved! I had defeated humanitosis, which no flobberworm has ever done before! I would be written down in the pages of flobberworm history. I am so happy.</p><hr/><p> </p><p></p><div>

    <p>Today we celebrate! We celebrate my victory. My wife baked a wonderful cake of lettuce, and my daughter helped. My sons built for me a lettuce storage shelter. It was a wonderful celebration! This is our greatest triumph over the evil pink-skinned demons. For the first time in my life, I was truly happy.</p>
    <p>However, the evil that troubles us still lives on. We will not stop until they are all dead.</p>

    <p>My jailers still live. They will not for long, for today, we are prepared. I have formed a legion of elite flobberworm warriors, consisting mostly of my three hundred children. I would not let Sue go because she is my only daughter, and I love her.</p>
    <p>"Charge!" I shrieked, the vengeance of Bob on my mind. I let loose a battle cry that bore seething hatred and malice. I bore the weight of my entire race on my non-existent shoulders. We flooded over the walls of our prison, swarming over the pink-skinned demons.</p>
    <p>Ages later, I lay on the cold hard ground, taking my last breaths. Not on the soft soils of my prison, but the stone of the demons' home. I lay dying, surrounded by the broken bodies of my family and friends. My final thought as I died was sorrow. I'm sorry, Mary. I'm sorry, Sue. Forgive me…</p>

    <p>"That lesson was as dull as ever," said Ron. "Though it was pretty cool to see all those flobberworms spilling over the tank."</p>
    <p>"Maybe now we can have a real lesson," said Hermione hopefully.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," Harry agreed. "Flobberworms sure are boring."</p>
    <p>I bet you didn't know flobberworms were such depressed creatures! See, you learn something new everyday. Review and tell us what you think!</p>
