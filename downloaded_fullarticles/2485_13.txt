    <p>“I don’t know, Prongs. Are we sure our Moony is ready for his first real shebang?” Sirius grinned at James as they got ready for their night of mischief and getting completely sloshed. Saturday nights were never quiet for the Marauders, especially not now that they’d all officially graduated and gotten their first flat together.</p>
<p>“Don’t call it a shebang, Pads,” James said, rolling his eyes and clapping Remus on the back as the taller boy looked at himself awkwardly in the mirror. “And of course he’s ready. The man is 20 years old for crying out loud! I can’t believe we’ve gone this long without taking him to a real party. What kind of friends are we anyway? We owe it to him to make tonight the best night ever. Isn’t that right, Moony?” James finished, stepping into the cluttered bathroom to brush his teeth and continue talking to them through the open door.</p>
<p>Remus shifted his feet, tugging at the neatly pressed collar of his button-down shirt and adjusting the mustard-colored cable knit sweater he was wearing over it. “Mmm...I really think you lot are making too big of a deal out of this,” Remus mumbled quietly, still not sure about going out tonight and going through with his friends’ unpredictable plan. He’d much rather stay inside and have a marauders movie marathon like they had done every night on his birthday for the last ten years. Those were always his favorite. But for some reason, his friends had decided that just wouldn’t do this year, not when he’d just hit his second decade of life and hadn’t even gone to second base with a girl yet, according to James.</p>
<p>“Too much?!” Sirius exclaimed in disbelief, popping up behind Remus to clasp a hand on either of his shoulders and make adoring faces at himself in the mirror. “Remus, you’re celebrating the big 20 today. That’s two — look at me — two decades, mate! You think we’d just let that slip by? We’re going to give you the best night of your life, Moons” Sirius smiled, ruffling a hand through the taller boy’s auburn hair.</p>
<p>“Besides, <em>dooozens</em> of girls are going to be there and you might just get lucky tonight,” Peter chuckled, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. He also showed up behind Remus in the mirror, having considerable trouble seeing over Remus’ shoulder to comb his tousled hair.</p>
<p>“Oh, how would you even know, Wormtail?” Sirius huffed, jabbing him in the ribs with his elbow. “It’s not like a girl’s ever talked to you anyway,” he snickered. Sirius, despite his enthusiasm about taking Remus out to celebrate his birthday tonight, wasn’t the biggest fan of James’ plan to help Remus pull for the first time. Sure, they were all friends, and he thought Remus deserved to be happy. But he knew his friend better than any of the others—and that was saying something, since he’d practically grown up with James as his brother. He just didn’t think that forcing Remus to go out and hook up with a girl was the way to do it—if he wanted to that is. Still, he wanted him to have as good of a time as possible, and he was all in for making Remus’ 20th birthday a night to remember.</p>
<p>“Hey! I resent that. Plenty of girls want to talk to me,” Peter said, pouting and rubbing at this side with a frown.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, mate,” Remus said. “Pads has a point. Every since you struck out with Mary at the fall formal two years ago, you’ve kind of had trouble picking up any girls,” Remus had to agree, making Sirius smile cheekily and stick his tongue out at Peter over Remus’ shoulder in victory.</p>
<p>Peter rolled his eyes and tried to swat at Sirius, who quickly ducked behind his tallest friend to protect himself before attempting to thwack Peter on the back. Remus shook his head. Tonight was already going smashing, as usual.</p>
<p>“Oi! You lot quit beating the piss out of each other,” James said, walking out of the bathroom and pointing a toothbrush at them all in warning. “Tonight is about Moony, not Pete’s sad excuse for a love life,” James added, going back to spit into the sink.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Peter whined again. “Ah, fuck all of you lot. I should just go to the party myself,” he grumbled, going to get his jacket and wait by the door.</p>
<p>“Hah! That’s a laugh,” Sirius smirked, walking over to Peter and crossing his arms in front of him over his leather jacket. “You couldn’t go to the party by yourself even if you wanted to because I…” Sirius said, dangling his car keys in front of a frowning Peter, “…am your only way of getting there,” Sirius finished proudly.</p>
<p>“Awe, come on. Leave the poor bloke alone,” Remus said, walking up to them once he’d finally decided he’d had enough of fussing over himself in the mirror. Remus looked down at his light brown pants, rolled up to show his argyle socks and chestnut-colored oxford shoes. This was as good as it was going to get, he thought to himself with a sigh. “It’s <em>my</em> birthday and I officially want us <em>all</em> to have a good time," he said decidedly. "That means no fighting, and at least one of us has to stay sober enough to be the designated driver, which I gladly volunteer to do for the 500th time,” Remus reminded them as James came to join them.</p>
<p>“Eh, eh, eh, birthday boy can’t be the designated driver,” James tutted, pressing the keys even deeper into Sirius’ palm. “That’s just a no go. No, old Pads here will be our driver, won’t ya?” James grinned evilly at Sirius. They’d decided days ago that Sirius would be the driver, and by decided that meant they’d flipped a coin and Sirius had lost. Sirius had tried to fight it, but James had pinned Sirius to the ground and made him shout “uncle” until he’d agreed to accept that he’d lost, which hadn’t been easy. In fact, James still had a bruise on his knee to prove it.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” Sirius grumbled, opening up the front door and leading them into the hall. “I’ll still have a better time than the whole lot of you because I’ll have Moony by my side, and we’re going to have the time of our lives. Ain’t that right, mate?” Sirius grinned, throwing an arm around Remus’ shoulders as James locked up the front door.</p>
<p>“Sure, whatever you say, Pads,” Remus shook his head with a smile. He really hoped Sirius was right this time.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>By the time their little group had made it to the address James had managed to coax out of a college-aged girl in their building, the party seemed to be in full swing.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday, mate!” James grinned widely, clapping Remus on the back again and pushing him towards the front door. “Just beyond this door awaits your very first glimpse into adulthood. Am I right, mates?” James grinned over his shoulder at Sirius and Peter. While Peter nodded eagerly in agreement, Sirius shrugged noncommittally and pretended to be distracted by something under his fingernails, which no one really seemed to notice other than Remus.</p>
<p>“Guys, really, I love movie nights,” Remus insisted, tugging at the end of his sleeve nervously as he made one last ditch effort to talk himself out of this. He really wasn’t ready for this at all. “Honestly, we can just go back to the flat and pop a movie in just like old times. You really don’t have to go out of your way just for me,” he chuckled awkwardly, not wanting to outright admit he didn’t do parties, or girls much for that matter.</p>
<p>“Nonsense, mate! We’re already here,” James grinned, pushing open the unlocked door to reveal a crowd of college students bouncing around the room in what Remus assumed was dancing. The music shook the inside of the house alarmingly, and a multicolored lamp in the corner of the room shot rays of light across the floor in rainbow colors that made Remus’ head dizzy. A brunette girl in a top that showed her belly button ring wandered by with a drink in her hand. James was quick to try to follow after her, only to be pulled back by Sirius, who reminded him tonight was about Remus. James nodded in slightly disgruntled understanding and sidled up to the tallest marauder.</p>
<p>When Remus looked up from the spectacle before him, the others were all looking at him expectantly, and he managed to force a smile. His best bet would be to stick by their side all night and hope they didn’t try to get him alone with some poor girl who was only talking to him because she felt bad for the lanky nerd in the sweater. Remus knew how people perceived him, and he didn’t particularly want to be subjected to that on his birthday. He wished he could just go home and hang out with his friends like they normally did.</p>
<p>“Come on, I’ll get us some drinks and then you can tell us who catches your fancy,” James winked, leading them all to the table in the back, covered in red solo cups and cans of cheap beer. “This’ll have to do lads. Drink up,” he grinned, pressing a cold can into each of their hands and cracking his own open to knock it back with a long chug. “Alright, so who is it, Moony? Which girl do you want us to help you talk to?” James asked with a smirk, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.</p>
<p>Remus held on tightly to his beer can as if he could use it to teleport away from here. The loud music and huge crowd were already overwhelming for him. But now James wanted him to name some random girl so he could sleep with her? No thank you, Remus thought to himself with a shiver. It wasn’t that he didn’t like women. He liked them very much. Heck, he’d even kissed a few before and liked it quite a lot — not that he’d ever really told any of the others about that. He preferred to keep his love life private, much like other parts of his life.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t deny that he found a number of the girls at the party to be attractive, but he also found a number of the guys at the party attractive as well. And he wasn’t about to tell any of the other marauders he thought that, not after they’d been hounding him for weeks about how they were going to find him the perfect girl for his first shag. None of this was Remus’ style. But, also, none of the people in front of him really caught his eye in a way that made him want to—as James would so eloquently put it — jump their bones. No, Remus rarely felt that way about anyone.</p>
<p>“I, erm...I can’t choose,” Remus said quietly, looking down at the unopened beer can in his hands and worrying his bottom lip between his teeth, as he often did. Sirius always chided him for doing that because it made his lips chapped and red, but he couldn’t help it. It was just one of his many nervous habits.</p>
<p>“Ah, alright, alright, Moony, we get it — still shy. We’ll help you out, though, right boys?” James said, turning to Sirius and Peter for some encouragement.</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, Moony. Just go for the first bird that catches your eye,” Peter suggested. “We can help you from there. Me personally, I like ‘em blonde with really nice smiles and <em>really</em> big—ouch! What the hell, Sirius?”</p>
<p>“Oh shut up, Worms. You’re an embarrassment to us all sometimes, you know that?” Sirius narrowed his eyes after having elbowed Peter in the ribs again. “What he means to say, my dear Moony, is that you can have your pick of anyone in this joint. You’re a top notch bloke and you shouldn’t worry about getting rejected because no girl in her right mind would say no to a bloke like you,” Sirius smiled, walking around James to place a hand on Remus’ shoulder.</p>
<p>If Sirius was honest with himself, he didn’t want Remus to pick anyone at the party to go home with — except him. He’d been crushing on his best friend probably since secondary school, maybe even longer. And that crush had become increasingly more undeniable since senior year of high school when Remus had hit his growth spurt and they’d all finished going through puberty. Suddenly, the shrimpy boy in his class who fell ill far too often and had trouble talking to anyone but the three of them had grown into a long-limbed male model — though Remus was more likely to liken himself to a spaghetti noodle.</p>
<p>With all the time the marauders had spent together in close proximity growing up and going to pool parties or playing in the lake or just changing in front of each other for one reason or another, Sirius had definitely noticed a change in Remus over the years. He was bloody hot.</p>
<p>And Sirius had never been one to limit himself much in his choice of partners, snogging whoever he saw fit, no matter who they were—as long as it was consensual, of course. But he’d mostly stuck to girls his entire life — as far as his friends knew. And what little the marauders did know about his attraction to men was heavily edited in his retelling of stories to make it seem like the whole thing had been the product of too much whiskey. Still, he’d done a lot more than he let on, and he was more than willing to tell Remus, or even show him a few of those things he’d learned. But that would also involve telling Remus how he felt about him, and the thought alone made Sirius want to vomit all over the tacky tile floors they were currently standing on.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Pads. Means a lot,” Remus said with a forced smile, tapping his long fingers nervously along the side of the beer can now.</p>
<p>“Look, Prongs. If Remy doesn’t want to pull tonight, he doesn’t have to. We shouldn’t force him,” Sirius insisted, his words coming both from a good place in his heart and a selfish place.</p>
<p>Remus knew his friends loved him and wouldn’t dare point out a single one of his insecurities because they thought he was the most fragile one out of all of them. But he wasn’t really sure how they could think that when he regularly wrestled them off of one another. He was also the only one who could actually lift any of the boxes earlier without wanting to cry, but they did. And it frustrated him that the people he loved most in the world saw him in such a light — as so high-strung and weak. He wanted to prove them wrong, and show that he was brave and he wasn’t just this meek, studious nerd they made him out to be.</p>
<p>“I—uh, she looks nice, I guess,” Remus mumbled, nodding half-heartedly to a girl dressed in all black with long, dark hair.</p>
<p>“The goth chick? Dang, Moony, wouldn’t have taken her as your type. But I guess opposites attract, right?” James chuckled, finishing off his beer and tossing the can back onto the table. “Alright, so here’s what you’re gonna do,” James began with a smirk.</p>
<p>Sirius’ heart had sunk a little and his mind began to wander when Remus actually pointed out a girl he liked. While she was cute and looked like someone he’d get along with pretty well, that girl was not him. And that made Sirius want to drag Moony home as soon as possible. But he had to keep up appearances — it being boys’ night out and Remus’ birthday, after all. So he nodded along to James’ plan to chat the girl up and did his best not to grimace at the idea of his lifelong crush flirting with someone else.</p>
<p>One thing that had made it particularly easy to maintain his crush on his best friend for so long without rampaging fits of jealousy over the years was the fact that Remus mostly kept to himself, which virtually meant no competition. And, in this way, Sirius had been able to show Remus affection in the smallest of ways — from baking him a birthday cake when they were 12, albeit poorly, to collecting notes for him all through school whenever he’d been out sick, even though Sirius never even took notes for himself.</p>
<p>But somehow, James had found out that their boy still had his “all-important v-card," as James put it, and of course it had to be a big deal. If Remus was going to lose his virginity to anyone, Sirius wanted it to be with someone who cared about his friend, maybe even loved him...someone like him.</p>
<p>Sirius was snapped out of his thoughts when he noticed Remus drifting off from their little group and approaching the girl wearing all black. His heart quickly picked up speed and he turned to look at James, who was cracking open a second beer and nodding at Remus whenever he looked back doubtfully.</p>
<p>“James, where the hell is he going?” Sirius hissed and tugged at James’ arm a little too aggressively.</p>
<p>“Ouch, Pads,” James pushed him off and nodded with a smile in Remus’ direction as he started talking to the girl. “Our little Moony is taking his first step towards becoming a man,” James sighed like a proud parent before tossing back the entire beer in one go.</p>
<p>“Well what the hell did you tell him, you bloody idiot??” Sirius pressed, positive James had given him some ridiculous advice that was sure to get the poor man a slap across the face.</p>
<p>“Ah, quit acting so damn barmy. He’s fine. I just told him — oh, well it looks like I didn’t have to tell him anything at all,” James nodded in Remus’ direction with a smirk. Sirius turned to see his friend disappearing even deeper into the crowd with this mysterious girl close by his side, smiles on each of their faces. Sirius could feel his throat clenching uncomfortably and he bit the inside of his cheek as he followed after them without hesitation. He’d be damned if he was going to stand by and let Remus slip away from him that quickly.</p>
<p>“Moony’s got game, am I right?” James chuckled, turning to give Sirius a nudge. But he was met only with the sight of Peter stuffing his face with chips from the table behind him. So much for an exciting boys’ night out, James sighed. “Honestly, Pete,” James shook his head and made his way towards the dance floor in search of a little more excitement.</p>
