  <span>“Alright, everyone! That’s it for tonight. Good job today. As long as we continue to work on communication among our defense, we’ll be solid for the next match!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny pulled to a hault, along with the other chasers, and they all followed Harry’s lead by slowly lowering themselves to the ground and forming a loose huddle. Her eyes lingered over Harry’s windswept hair, which was messy enough on a good day. She felt Dean at her side, and tried to lean into him, though her eyes followed their captain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Cootes, Peakes, I have a flying drill I want you to try out next week to help improve your balance,” they nodded in unison, “Ron, I reckon it couldn’t hurt if you joined them, but good job today,” finally, he turned to the three chasers, “Demelza, really excellent form today,” she smiled and nodded, “Dean,” Harry coughed slightly, “also good, but er focus a bit more on your passing technique,” Ginny sense rather than saw Dean frown a hair, before Harry went on, “Ginny, er, good job also.” Ginny couldn’t help but notice the way in which Harry’s eyes quickly flitted away from hers, he brushed over her feedback, and his cheeks seemed a bit pink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She tried not to read too much into it; afterall, he probably just wanted to grab dinner, and of course all of their cheeks were a bit flushed from the wind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At that, they all started to head to the locker rooms to change. Dean gave Ginny a quick kiss on the cheek before peeling off with some of the others to go take a quick shower before dinner. Eventually, only she and Harry were left alone. Probably because he’d been moving unnaturally slowly to peel his gear off, but again, Ginny needn’t linger on such insignificant details.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Afterall, she thought with only a twinge of guilt, her attractive, doting boyfriend was only a few yards away in a steamy shower, her mind should’ve started fantasizing about that. not tracing Harry’s profile as he took his glasses off and rubbed the top of his nose with an ungloved hand. There was a red little indent there, and he scrunched his nose up as he rubbed. It was horribly endearing to her. She slammed her locker door, gear thrown hastily inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the sudden noise, Harry glanced up, seemingly remembering she was there. For a moment, they just looked at each other and listened to the distant sound of water running. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sighing, Ginny broke the moment with small talk, “I’m starving, you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I could eat a hippogriff.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She gestured at the showers, “I think these blokes might be in there a while - you know Ron has to rinse and repeat.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry chuckled slightly at that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So,” she leaned against the locker, suddenly nervous, “Wanna ditch them to get some supper?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry glanced over at the hallway leading to the showers, probably deciding whether or not Ron would be pissed, before turning back with a soft smile, “Yeah, sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They walked beside each other across the darkening grounds. It was a peaceful night, Ginny could hear the crickets in the background. Harry complained about the long parchment he still had to write for Snape (“You know, I didn’t think anyone could beat Umbridge for worst teacher, but Snape gives it a right go, doesn’t he?”) and they started giggling over increasingly ridiculous insulting nicknames they came up with for him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Too soon, they reached the entrance hall. As they approached the Gryffindor table, some of Ginny’s peers hailed her, calling her to sit by them. There wasn’t any extra space up at the head of the table with them. For a second, Ginny was struck with indecision. She wanted to eat with Harry, just the two of them. But she also didn’t want to risk adding fuel to the fire of school gossip and put strain on her and Dean’s slightly tenuous relationship. But why should it be weird for her to sit alone with him? He was Ron’s best mate, so surely-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She cut off her own thoughts. She knew why it’d feel like more than that. Making up her mind, she turned to Harry trying to feign casual indifference, “Do you mind?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry, equally casually, said, “No of course not, go on.” Though, for a split second, Ginny could’ve sworn she saw his face fall, before his features smoothed over. Ginny felt a pang of guilt and regret, she had asked him to ditch the team and eat with her after all. And it wasn’t like grabbing a post-practice meal in the Great Hall was the same as asking someone to Madame Puddifoot’s tea shop, but when it came to Harry, everything always felt more loaded than it really was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Every shared laugh, look, high five, inside joke: it all felt like uncharted territory, always thrilling and exciting in a way that her other friendships would never be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sighed as she settled herself down amongst her roommates and tried to ease into the conversation, but her eyes kept going back to Harry at the other end of the table, who’d joined Seamus and Neville. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eventually, the rest of the Gryffindor team meandered in, and both Ron and Dean himself also sat by Harry. She caught his eye and tried to smile, but her heart wasn’t in it. Suddenly, Ginny felt overwhelmingly sad and not hungry in the least bit. She picked at the roast on her plate, while her friends started gossiping about the next “Slug Club” party. Ginny supposed she’d have to take Dean. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pulled her head back up to see Harry, now accompanied by both Ron and Hermione start heading back toward the common room. She supposed she should go spend a moment or two with Dean, before she turned in for the night, but she remained firmly planted in her chair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As if sensing her eyes on him from all the way across the great hall, Harry suddenly glanced back, and their eyes met for a moment. The words around her became a buzz, and when Harry finally turned back around and left, she was sure that the blush on his cheeks hadn’t been from flying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She knew that her blush certainly wasn’t.</span>
