    <p align="right">Winter is come and gone, <br/>But grief returns with the revolving year.<br/>-Percy Bysshe Shelley, <em>Adonais </em></p>
<p align="right">Death is an ache whose remedy rests in Timeheart. <br/>-<em>The Book of Night with Moon</em>, xv/24</p>
<p align="left">Unlike most prospective wizards, Luna Lovegood knew about the Art from a fairly young age.</p>
<p align="left">Or, failing that, she at least had a pretty good idea, because from the first years of her life, Luna and her mother were inseparable.  Pandora Lovegood never outright explained to her daughter what exactly she was doing, but she never made an effort to hide it either.</p>
<p align="left">“There’ll be a snowstorm in two days,” she might say, after slipping back from between thin air where she’d been negotiating property disputes with the Fair Folk, and sure enough there would be.  Her weather predictions were always spot-on, her flowers always grew even through surprising bouts of early frost, and her vegetables were never bothered by deer.</p>
<p align="left">These were small things, but they were still entirely unlike the flashy, deliberate magics Luna’s father or the teachers at her informal primary school practiced.  Luna almost never saw her mother wave a wand (indeed half of the time she would venture outside without it for an afternoon, come back, and forget where she had left it), nor say any of those funny half-Latin words that she knew adult witches and wizards used.  Whenever she saw her mother perform spells, they were always contemplative affairs, spoken carefully in what sounded to Luna like ordinary English, albeit with technical jargon she’d never heard before.  Luna had seen her write them out sometimes, long fluid lines in graceful characters she couldn’t begin to read.</p>
<p align="left">Her father had indulged all of this, though he didn’t try to understand it, preoccupied as he was with his own research and his weekly magazine.  Only occasionally, such as when at the dinner table Xeno expounded on a theory of a conspiracy of thieving three-legged gnomes, would Pandora get a funny faraway look and say, “Of course, darling,” her voice suddenly, unnervingly serious.<br/>It was an odd, somewhat distractible childhood, but Luna adored it.  She sat at her mother’s side and watched silently as her mother wove spells with only words, or sometimes with the aid of a length of string, a handful of oak leaves, a circle drawn in chalk.</p>
<p align="left">Though Pandora left her wand anywhere and everywhere without a thought, Luna never saw her without the book: an unassuming blue-bound volume with <em>“Recipes”</em> written across it in fading golden letters.  She carried that book everywhere, sometimes writing in it with an absent-minded frown, mostly just flipping through it, revealing pages and pages of that graceful script Luna couldn’t parse.</p>
<p align="left">At first, Luna would ask her mother where she was going on those mornings when she tucked the recipe book into her handbag and strode off toward the hills.  Pandora always answered her, and Luna never got the impression that she was lying, as some adults did to fob off childish curiosity, but the answers she got never made a jot of sense to her.</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>“I’m negotiating with the wind; there’s a wildfire to the northeast.”</em>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>“I’m writing a glamor for the convention in town next month.”</em>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>“I’m just keeping the Universe running, that’s all.”</em>
</p>
<p align="left">That one was the most common response, and Luna felt it was the truest one she would ever receive.  She continued to ask anyway, delighting in the answers; continued to follow her, trying to decipher her mother’s strange rituals, on those days when Pandora didn’t insist on leaving Luna at home with her father for her own good.</p>
<p align="left">Then came the day, when Luna had turned nine only a few weeks before, when Pandora didn’t come home, when Xeno went after her and finally returned staggering with the weight of her in his arms.</p>
<p align="left">Then the hurt spilled from Luna, flowing like the black script in her mother’s books.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p align="left">The Aurors came and went, eventually ruling Pandora’s death a spell accident, meticulously frowning over her mostly indecipherable notes and running test spells over samples of her tea and food, while they sat Xeno down with a fresh pot of Earl Grey, patting his shoulder and speaking softly with him.  Luna perched on a dining room chair nearby, eyes wide, unable to say anything in response to their awkward questions.</p>
<p align="left">It took Luna’s father a while to sort everything out, afterward.  Neither he nor his wife had ever been particularly organized people, and at first most of Xeno’s attempts at dealing with her possessions involved putting all of them in boxes left in the corner of the sitting room, so he wouldn’t constantly have to look at Pandora’s cotton dresses and overstuffed notebooks and tea-stained mugs.</p>
<p align="left">Luna barely noticed.  Truthfully, these days, Luna and her father barely noticed each other at all.</p>
<p align="left">One evening at dinner, her father broke the oppressive silence.  “I have something for you,” he said, his speech halting and hoarse.  He rose jerkily from the table, to a messy pile that had accumulated in the sitting room as he’d finally begun to pick apart the boxes.</p>
<p align="left">As she’d expected—dreaded—he came back with the blue recipe book tucked under one arm and set it next to her plate.  Luna swallowed.</p>
<p align="left">“I know—” he said.  “You always loved—”  He shook his head.  “I think—she would have wanted you.  To have this.”</p>
<p align="left">Luna stared at the book until her eyes burned.  She darted a glance at her father.  Did he know what this meant?  Did he see, even now, the way the golden letters of the title shimmered to become that strange cursive that had filled her mother’s notebooks?</p>
<p align="left">His eyes were rigidly fixed on his plate.   Luna looked away and decided not to ask.</p>
<p align="left">It hurt more, she discovered, the more she thought about it.  The grief was like a wound lodged in her chest that failed to heal.  When she was unprepared, when she lowered her guard, her mind would idly turn toward it and she would feel it open anew.  It was the only part of her that still felt, because she’d sealed all her joy into it with all the pain.  Without it, everything was weary and dull.</p>
<p align="left">But dullness was better than pain.</p>
<p align="left">So Luna left her mother’s book on the highest remotest corner of her bookshelf and refused to look at it.  She and her father got up every morning, ate, Luna went off to school and Xeno to his books, and the two of them mostly failed to meet each other’s eyes.<br/>A year passed that way, and Luna hardly felt it.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>“She should have told him!”  Luna felt her own voice ring in a way she could hardly remember it doing before, staring at the creature before her, willing it to understand.</em>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>The creature only looked at her, sadly.  “And that’s your decision to make, is it?” it said, a soft rumble building in its dark furred chest.  “You know better, Luna.  Life has called you both, but Life calls us to make our own choices, and to respect those of others.”  Its deep liquid eyes bored into her.  “I think you should ask, what choice will you make?  Isn’t it time for you to decide?”</em>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>Its sleek black shape blurred past her sudden tears.  “Why, though?” she said, salt stinging her eyes.  “It said I could have her back.  Why can’t I just have her back?”</em>
</p>
<p align="left">Luna opened her eyes, breathing out slowly as the dream began to seep away, eyes straying to the cloudy sky outside her bedroom window.  This particular April day looked to begin like most others.</p>
<p align="left">She thought so, anyway—it was getting difficult to tell the difference between one day and the next, and going by the silence that still permeated the house like a fog these days, she was sure her father felt the same way. </p>
<p align="left">The dreams were one thing, though.  They’d been getting steadily more vivid in the last week or so, almost as if there was something she was meant to know from them, but on waking, she could never remember enough to figure out the meaning.  There were details that changed—words or phrases that changed order or form—but the rhythm of the conversation always ended the same way, between her and the mysterious companion whose appearance she could never pin down. She sighed, staring at the painted stars on her ceiling. </p>
<p align="left">She got up.</p>
<p align="left">The morning was the usual shuffle of putting on something that didn’t smell too much, methodically chewing on some toast, and kissing her father goodbye (he grunted, not looking up from his printing press) as she took the Floo to Madam Wharton’s Primary School for Young Witches and Wizards.  When Madam Wharton let them outside for lunch, Luna reached into her bag for her sandwich and a copy of the Quibbler, frowning when she encountered a hard object she didn’t remember having put there.</p>
<p align="left">“Luna?”</p>
<p align="left">She looked up, distracted.</p>
<p align="left">Ginny Weasley smiled, tentatively, beginning a ritual that had been going on for months.  “I was just wondering if you wanted to play Gobstones with me?”</p>
<p align="left">“Leave Loony be, Weasley!” came a shout from across the yard, where some other children were making a valiant effort at Quidditch on toy broomsticks.  “She’d rather read that Quibble rubbish anyway.”</p>
<p align="left">Ginny glared back at them, then turned back to Luna.  “Don’t listen to them,” she said.</p>
<p align="left">Luna forced her mouth into the same rictus of a smile she’d become practiced at.  This too, was part of the ritual.  “I’m fine,” she said.  “I’ve got my book.”  She pulled it out of her bag to prove it, swallowing the start on seeing her mother’s recipe book.  How had that gotten there?</p>
<p align="left">Ginny bit her lip.  “If you’re sure,” she said.  “You know where to find me.”</p>
<p align="left">Luna nodded, her fingers tightening on the book’s binding.  Then as Ginny walked away, because at that point she had to, she did the thing she’d avoided all this time.  She opened the book and began to read.</p>
<p align="left">To her surprise, the text was not that illegible cipher she remembered spying over her mother’s shoulder, but perfectly comprehensible English.  <em>“A wizard sees the changing of the surrounding world, for good and ill,”</em> she read, near the top of a page somewhere in the middle, <em>“but does not seek to undo it.  A wizard protects what grows and lives, though she knows she cannot undo what has already passed.”</em> </p>
<p align="left">She frowned and flipped ahead several pages.</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>“When spelling in regions with particularly dense magical ‘pollution’ for lack of a more appropriate term, it is important to carefully anchor spells within the proper temporalspatial framework.  Repeated workings in the same geographic area over time can lead to unpredictable results, but one of the most common for the unprepared wizard is a thinning of dimensional walls, leading to a so-called slipping into other potentialities or histories, which can divert the effect of the intended wizardry.  Most wizards in such magically dense areas are familiar with the phenomenon, using the slang term ‘going sideways’ to refer to—”</em>
</p>
<p align="left">What?  Luna decided to page to the beginning of the book in hopes of it making more sense.</p>
<p align="left"><em>“Welcome, supplicant,”</em> read the first page.  <em>“If you read this, you possess the necessary aptitude to help slow the death of the Universe.  The Art of Wizardry, though dangerous, allows the wizard to—”</em></p>
<p align="left">Luna shut the book, breathing hard.  <em>“I’m just keeping the Universe running, that’s all,”</em> echoed in her head, sing-song.  <em>“I’m just keeping the Universe running.  I’m just—”</em></p>
<p align="left">“Hey!  Loony!”</p>
<p align="left">Luna looked up sharply. </p>
<p align="left">Zach Smith hovered in front of her, wobbling inexpertly on his toy broomstick.  “Give us that Quaffle already,” he said, pointing at a red ball that had landed in the bramble patch beside her, while she had been silently collapsing, oblivious.  “Well?” he said at her confused blinking.  “Come on, I can’t.  My fingers are all numb, that idiot Harper jammed them, thought he was a Bludger or something.  Well, Loony?  Are you going to sit there all day with that book?  What’s this one about?  Two-headed Cats of the British Isles?”  He sniggered.</p>
<p align="left">Her eyes stung.  <em>“Don’t hold resentment in your heart, Luna,”</em> her mother had always told her.  <em>“That’s the surest way for evil to get in if you do.”</em>  It was good advice, she supposed, but Merlin, it was so hard.  She reached her hand into the bramble, heedless of the white stinging scratches the thorns produced on her dry skin.  Her hand found the Quaffle and she thrust it at Smith, not trusting her voice to speak.</p>
<p align="left">He grinned toothily at Luna, and it occurred to her that she’d be wasting her time being resentful toward him anyway.  It would be like getting angry at a dog for biting her; he was just too stupid to know better.  “Thanks, Loony!” </p>
<p align="left">As he swerved away on his broomstick, ball tucked under one arm, Luna stared at the damp ground a while longer, unwilling to open the book again, unwilling to see the words again, see <em>“the Universe, the Art,”</em> all the words with their implied capital letters she’d ever heard her mother say and dismissed as nothing, or as peculiarities belonging only to her.  <em>“The Art, though dangerous . . . I’m just keeping the Universe running, that’s all.  That’s all.  Keeping the Universe running.”</em>  The sounds were building in her head again.</p>
<p align="left">Was that what had happened, that awful day?  Keeping the Universe running?  Was that—</p>
<p align="left">“Luna!”  It was Ginny Weasley.  “Are you all right?” she said.  “Only it’s time to come inside.”</p>
<p align="left">“Yes.”  She breathed in and out a few times again, trying to readjust herself to the sensation, to existing in general.  The pebbled ground was hard beneath her bitten-down fingernails.  The sky was still stubbornly cloudy, a day like all the others she’d seen lately, that refused to acknowledge spring.  Next to her, Ginny smelled faintly of lavender soap.  “I’m coming.”  She shoved the book inside her bag and got up, feeling inexplicably angry at herself.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p align="left">Whenever Luna was particularly upset—or more than she usually was, these days—she went outside, and usually remembered to find her way back before dark.</p>
<p align="left">Her father, she knew, probably wouldn’t see the sun at all if not for basic necessities of doing the shopping and whatever else he needed to keep the barest semblance of house.  Luna seemed to remember him and her mother having people over sometimes, when she was very young, or going out to visit adult friends they knew, but that had been so long ago she could scarcely remember it.  She herself had practically grown up feral, rather distant from other children her own age—save the Weasleys, who were nice enough generally, but tended to keep to themselves.  She hadn’t felt lonely.  She’d had her mother, who understood her as well as any best friend could, or better.  They’d had the strange creatures her mother told her about, the ones she’d insisted were river spirits, or fairies <em>(“They don’t like that name though Luna, you mustn’t call them that to their faces, it isn’t polite”)</em>, or whatever else that Pandora always seemed to understand perfectly, and Luna could sometimes, when she was half-paying attention and not concentrating on their actual words like her brain wanted to.</p>
<p align="left">They’d gone into the tangle of woods by the house, where the oaks grew twisted and covered with lichen and bracken, to the stony hills that overlooked the distant village, to the great enveloping moorland where the heather grew wild and purple and the sky seemed to swallow the earth.  She’d loved that place the most, feeling like she could almost just leap off one of the craggy hills and feel her feet leave the earth, feel the singing wind catch and carry her away.</p>
<p align="left">She couldn’t go to the moors now of course, that was miles away and she was too young to Apparate as her mother must have done with her (she thought, anyway; that part of her memories was less vivid).</p>
<p align="left">So today she picked her way through the wood, stepping carefully over tree roots and granite boulders.  The snowdrops were late this year, she noticed, in that absent, distant way she’d grown used to noticing anything.  The overbearing gloom was doing little for her mood.  Normally by summer the wood was a riot of mossy green; even now, by spring, there ought to be the pale green points of early flowers.  But the only things she saw now were a few stubborn lichens amid the black wet trunks of trees, the remains of dirty snow still patchy on the ground.</p>
<p align="left">Her mother would know.  Her mother always knew when anything was amiss in the wild places.  Without her, Luna felt moorless, as one does in a foreign country, not knowing the language.  Without her, who was Luna to say there was anything wrong at all?<br/>But something was.  She could feel it, an eerie stillness that hung in the air, strikingly like the one she’d grown used to feeling at home, alone with her father and nothing but the gulf between them for company.</p>
<p align="left">It was absence, she realized.  This forest was missing something, though she couldn’t say what it was.  She knew her mother would have known.  She remembered the words in her mother’s book.  “Supplicant,” it had said.  Chosen to slow the death of the Universe.  The anger began to surface again.</p>
<p align="left">This was what the Universe did for its chosen ones?  And now it wanted her to be one too?</p>
<p align="left">With shaking fingers, she drew the book roughly from her bag.</p>
<p align="left">She tossed it to the ground, the blue cover stark against the bare mud and snow.</p>
<p align="left">As she started walking, her eye caught a large black shape moving through the trees, but she turned her face firmly away, and headed for home.</p>
