    <p>Hermione could still feel the lingering disappointment from her phone call with her parents as she unpacked her suitcase in her new home. Home was a rather loose term, in her opinion, for the tiny apartment she was renting out near the University. Stanford had been a great decision for a series of reasons, the top one being that she was now over 3,000 miles away from her parents. It helped that it had an amazing comparative literature graduate program, but that wasn’t even the most important point to Hermione anymore.</p>
<p>She was just happy to be as far away from <em> him </em>as possible. It took her moving across the entire country to feel some shred of safety once again.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Hermione took the last article of clothing out of her suitcase and put it in her beat up dresser. The old thing was a decent thrift store find, as was all the furniture in her small studio apartment. Stanford was an expensive area to live in; all of her scholarship money was going to go to keeping her afloat. Worst case scenario, she knew she could call her parents, but this was supposed to be proof she could live on her own, without them, without him. She could handle this.</p>
<p>After a sad meal of Cup of Noodle, Hermione spent her evening reading the assigned pages that would be covered tomorrow in her Gothic Lit class. It was easier to enjoy horror when you weren’t living in a thriller movie anymore.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The walk from Hermione’s studio to campus took less than half an hour; she found it pleasant. She could’ve taken the campus shuttle and gotten there in a quarter of the time, but California weather was so different from Rhode Island. The September air was warm, a breeze carrying the chatter of university students through the streets. Hermione found it refreshing to be able to enjoy walking by herself again. There was no need to constantly look over her shoulder (not that she could shake that habit yet) and she knew that the sound of snapping twigs in bushes were squirrels, not a man waiting to leap. She knew it would take ages to convince her subconscious of that, but it still felt freeing to know that--even though she did startle and jump--she would be safe.</p>
<p>Hermione made her way to the lecture hall where her only class for the day would be held. Gothic Literature was a graduate class taught by Severus Snape. Hermione had heard he was a hard ass, took amusement in humiliating students, and had never once been happy in his life. All of that didn’t change the fact that he was the sole best researcher on said genre. Sitting in a lecture of Professor Snape was an honor and Hermione knew it. Even if he did humiliate students, no one ever filed a complaint. It was better to be humiliated and shamed by a genius than coddled by someone who wasn’t world famous for his understanding of Gothic Literature.</p>
<p>It was easy to say Hermione was both excited and terrified to attend her first lecture at Stanford.</p>
<p>She found herself a seated in the second row; she had learned in undergrad that being overly eager drew unwanted attention to oneself. Hermione was going to do her year in this program right. She wasn’t going to be mocked by her peers and ignored by her professors; this wasn’t going to be like it was at Brown. Hermione was determined to change her destiny in a slew of ways and Stanford was the key.</p>
<p>At the stroke of ten am--when class was due to begin--the classroom door was thrown open and a tall man with long, black hair entered. He obviously had a taste for subtle drama as his loose black coat flew behind him, almost like a robe. With a <em> thud </em> , he set his bag on the table at the front of class and pulled a black Expo marker out. On the board, he wrote out ‘ <em> Professor Snape </em>’ before turning and speaking to the class.</p>
<p>“I am your professor for Gothic Literature. I will only be address as Professor Snape or you can expect to have an appointment with me after class. If I hear any of that Dracula nonsense this year, I will automatically drop your grade an entire letter. Are we understood?” His voice carried through the class, loud and monotone.</p>
<p>A murmur flew through the class, heads nodding in agreement. No one wanted to lose a letter grade for something as ridiculous as an accurate, but unwelcome comparison.</p>
<p>“Perfect.” Hermione suddenly understood why this was his speciality. The man looked like he popped out of a Gothic novel and right into their classroom. With his hook nose and long, sleek black hair, he looked like he was one of Poe’s villains. Professor Snape had a suiting career. “Now to begin today’s lecture. I assume you all read the assigned reading.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco wasn’t thrilled that his godfather worked at Stanford, but it was the only school on the west coast he was allowed to go to, so he took it. He also wasn’t too pleased that Severus taught the only lecture in one of the fields Draco was interested in, but life never really was on his side. His father was getting exactly what he wanted--someone to keep an eye on him. Lovely.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but fight sleep as Severus’s monotone voice droned on for the better part of half an hour without a pause. He had never enjoyed how his godfather spoke. Severus had an awful habit of dragging out the vowels in words he found important for emphasis. It drove Draco mad. </p>
<p>The lecture changed direction and finally peaked Draco’s interest. He sat up straighter in his seat--back row, obviously. He wasn’t a tryhard.</p>
<p>“Can anyone tell me what the first Gothic novel was?” Snape asked the class with unamused eyes. A hand towards the front raised as well as two others. Most of the students in class should’ve known the information, but they were all terrified of being the first victim of Professor Snape’s infamous humiliation.</p>
<p>“You, in the front.” He pointed to some woman with wild hair.</p>
<p>“The first official Gothic novel is considered to be <em> The Castle of Otranto </em> by Horace Walpole back in 1764.” The woman paused. She spoke calmly; she was confident. Draco couldn’t help but find what she was saying as basic. Everyone knew Walpole was the first Gothic author in the literal sense. He leaned back in his chair, interest lost.</p>
<p>That is, until he heard the woman continue talking.</p>
<p>“It is only considered the first Gothic novel because Walpole used the word ‘Gothic’ to describe it, but he meant the word to describe the story as something more barbaric.” Whoever she was, she was putting the class at awe. Even if other students knew the information, they were all so terrified of Professor Snape’s reputation that they wouldn’t risk their pride in offering an answer that wasn’t exactly what he had requested. “The story itself doesn’t mark all the boxes of the Gothic genre as someone like Stoker does.”</p>
<p>Draco watched his godfather raise an eyebrow in interest. He knew the slight twitch of the corner of Severus’s mouth was as close to a smile as any student could get from the older man. A hush fell over the room as the other students waited for a scene to erupt.</p>
<p>“That’s correct. What’s your name, Miss?” Draco watched the other students in class all release a collect sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Hermione Granger, sir,” the woman replied politely. “You wrote about the controversy in your first book. I found it intriguing.”</p>
<p>Draco didn’t know how she managed it, but the Hermione woman managed to offer her godfather a compliment without sounding like a kissass and he found himself impressed. His interest truly was piqued.</p>
<p>“I’d like to speak to you after class about who your thesis advisor is, Miss Granger. Now, continuing on…”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The rest of class passed much quicker than the first half. Draco found himself waiting for Hermione to answer more of Severus’s questions, but she never did. If he leaned over to his right far enough, he could see down to her seat. She seemed to be absorbed in taking avid notes. He wanted to hear what else she had to say. Draco had never heard of a student offering an opinion to Severus as an answer and living to tell the tale.</p>
<p>He knew he shouldn’t let her grab too much of his attention. She was some woman who had gotten lucky on the first day of class and survive Professor Snape’s class. She’d be famous in class, but that didn’t mean she necessarily had brains of any sort. That one moment was no guarantee that she was brilliant. Most would accept her existence at Stanford as proof enough of that, but Draco knew all too well that with enough money, an idiot could go wherever they pleased.</p>
<p>With the end of class, Draco purposely took his time packing up to catch a glimpse at the interaction between his godfather and the Hermione person. It was easy to linger behind when the other students all but flew out of the room in a desperate need to get as far away from their professor as quickly as possible. It was amusing to watch how skittish his peers were.</p>
<p>Unlike the students that had fled, Hermione packed up her bag in a neat fashion and made her way to the front of class. Draco watched as she held her head high, refusing to cower like other students had. He smirked to himself. At worst, she would be at least entertaining to watch this semester.</p>
<p>“You wanted to speak with me, Professor?” Hermione asked, tone even and kind. Her voice was deeper than a lot of the women he had spent time with. Draco found it pleasant. Pansy and Daphne both had high pitched voices; when they got upset, they were positively shrill. Her voice felt warm. New York didn’t raise socialites like her.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Severus begun. “Every professor in the literature program is required to take on at least three students to supervisor their theses. It’s not something I take pleasure in, but last year I let the university choose whom I worked with and I ended up with a handful of idiots. I won’t be making that mistake again.” His tone was still even, but as someone who had known Severus since birth, Draco could head the slight edge in his voice that meant he was uncomfortable. His godfather hated asking for things.</p>
<p>“I was wondering if you had a supervisor yet for your thesis and, if not, would you like me to supervise your work?” Severus pushed his hair behind his shoulders. “It won’t be easy; I’m hard on my students. I expect only the best. As a reflection of my work, I refuse to allow any thesis under my supervision to be turned in if it’s shit.”</p>
<p>Without a moment of hesitation, Hermione responded. “I would be honored to have you as my supervisor,” she said quickly. She took a pause, as if to collect herself. “I wouldn’t expect any less of you. I put my all into my work and will not be turning in a disappointing thesis. I can promise you to work harder than any student you’ve had before.”</p>
<p>The control in her voice was obvious. She was trying her best to not be a kissass. Draco was a little impressed. He knew he got chances like hers all the time, but for someone who might not have the same luck as him, it would be instinct to kiss ass at such a moment. He finished packing his page as she spoke and buckled his authentic leather messenger bag shut.</p>
<p>“Try not to set your standards so high, Miss Granger,” Severus replied as he dragged out the vowels in her name. “I will be meeting with you twice a month. I expect plenty of progress at each meeting. I will email you about possible appointments and an opening I have for a research assistant. If you cannot handle the workload, I expect to be told.” With that, Draco watched his godfather pick up his bag and make an equally dramatic exit out.</p>
<p>Draco made his way to the stairs when he realized that Hermione must’ve been unaware of his presence in the room. Once the door had closed behind Severus, she let out an excited shout and jumped up and down, congratulating herself. Smirking, Draco waited until he reached the bottom of the stairs to interrupt her happiness.</p>
<p>“Congrats on finding yourself a thesis advisor on day one,” Draco drawled with a crooked smile. He had expected to startled her a little, as anyone would be. He hadn’t expected her to scream and whip around, slapping a hand over her mouth to silence her explicit fear. His smile instantly dropped off his lips. What was wrong with this woman?</p>
<p>“Oh shit, I didn’t mean to scary you,” he replied quickly. He held his hands out to show he was safe. Pansy had explained to him before that women get really freaked out when they are alone with a strange man (he really didn’t understand privilege; it was a work in progress). “I’m uhh not going to hurt you? This is weird. I’m in Professor Snape’s class, but I was hanging back hoping to catch him before he vanished.” Draco didn’t walk any closer. He watched her rapid breathing decrease slowly and even out. </p>
<p>With one last deep breath, she let out a heavy sigh. “Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me.” She dropped her hands from her mouth and her shoulders relaxed. Then, she laughed. “Oh god, I’m sorry, I took up his time and now you didn’t get to talk to him. Are you going to ask him to be your advisor too?”</p>
<p>Draco wasn’t used to people being as kind as they were in California. People in New York were assholes. This Hermione woman was instantly kind to him and didn’t even know his name. He could get used to California.</p>
<p>“It would be a conflict of interest, actually,” he replied smoothly. “It’s no big deal that he left; I’m glad you got an advisor. He’s one hell of a Professor. It can be career changing to work with him on your thesis.”</p>
<p>“‘A conflict of interest’?” she repeated with curiosity. “Why would that be?” She tilted her head to the side slightly and he watched her mane of hair shift with it. She had so much hair. He wondered how she maintained the mass.</p>
<p>Draco shifted slightly. This place was going to be like New York all over again. She would tell everyone he was only successful in class because the professor was a family friend. It would be assumed nepotism got him an A in class, that he bought his way in, that he didn’t have to work hard to get where he was.</p>
<p>“It’s a secret,” Draco drawled with a wink. It was best not to get himself a bad reputation on day one.</p>
<p>At his wink, Hermione’s cheeks turned pink. “Oh, I didn’t mean to pry,” she replied kindly. “I hope you find an advisor that you mesh well with. Do you have any in mind?”</p>
<p>Draco shifted his bag on his shoulder, adjusting the weight. “I was hoping to get through my first class of each course before making up my mind. I didn’t want to make my judgments based upon online research.” He shrugged, dismissing how casual his plan was.</p>
<p>“I wish I could be that relaxed about this process,” she sighed and smiled at him. “When you find your advisor, if you want to discuss thesis proposals or ideas, I’m always open to working with peers.”</p>
<p>He took a moment to consider her offer. Typically, Draco hated peer work. It meant someone was assessing your talent, eyeing your work, trying to find a weakness. His father taught him that working alone was the safest bet. Yet, here was this smart woman that had earned his godfather’s respect, offering to work with him with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’d like that,” he replied with a return of his crooked smile. “Thank you for the offer.” He glanced at his watch. “I have a Latin seminar in ten minutes I have to hurry off to. It was a pleasure talking to you.” With a mood of his head, Draco made his way out of the lecture hall and across campus, mind focused on an intriguing woman with a lion’s mane.</p>
