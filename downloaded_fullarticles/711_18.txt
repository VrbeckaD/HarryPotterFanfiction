    <p>Order Meeting 21:00 August 10th</p><p>Severus landed on the steps of Number 12 gracefully. He stalked in, already irritated by being pulled away from his experimental potion he was working on for the summer. His mood was not unnoticed, but was left alone as Albus Dumbledore started the meeting. </p><p>"Well. We have finally done it! We have found Harry Potter!" He exclaimed happily. </p><p>"Potter? I thought he was dead?" Tonks called out. A few order members nodded along. The Order has stopped looking for him a couple years ago, when he was finally declared dead. </p><p>"I have been searching for him for years. I never truly believed he was dead, only missing." Albus explained. </p><p>"Well? Where is my godson?" Sirius growled. </p><p>"He's upstairs." Sirius stood. "I'll go get him." Albus murmured. </p><p>As Albus climbed the stairs to grab the young man, Remus, Sirius, and Severus exchanged a glance. They knew where Harry Potter was the whole time, and now they knew what had happened in the last few days. </p><p>Harry came down the stairs just a step behind Albus, dragged by chains attached to magic suppressing cuffs on his wrists. Immediately, Sirius, Remus, and Severus stood and dropped to one knee, bowing their heads. </p><p>"What? Stand up my boys." Albus said, confused. </p><p>They didn't move. </p><p>"Rise." Everyone gasped as the trio stood as one at the young mans command. </p><p>"My King." Sirius nodded at his King and 'godson'.  Remus repeated the gesture. </p><p>Severus walked up to Harry, wrapping an arm around his lovers waist and placing a kiss on his cheek. Harry smiled at his consort, happy to se him again </p><p>Albus and the Order were stunned. What had just happened? </p><p>Albus recovered first. "Severus? What is going on here?" He demanded. </p><p>Harry stepped forward. "You kidnapped the King of the Underworld, you fool." His chains and cuffs clink as the hit the ground. </p><p>The Aurors and Ministry workers pale. The Underworld is what the network of creatures that are spread across the world. Their King, only know as King Raio, was famous as the most vicious, yet fair King in written history. He was ruthless with people who harmed people under his protection, and protected his territory fiercely, but was rather fair in accidents, and treated his people with kindness and respect. People followed him because he was passionate about the cause, bout out of fear. He was the most powerful Vampire, and maybe even being, in the world. </p><p>Albus was shocked by the news, but decided to pose his second most important question. "And what of Severus? What is this?" He gestured to Severus arm, still around the young King's waist. </p><p>Harry smiled. "This is my mate. He is my equal in my Kingdom." He squeezed Severus's hand. </p><p>"He's too old for you!" Molly Weasley snapped. </p><p>Harry simply wiggled his fingers at Severus, taking off the ancient glamour and revealing Severus as he was at 20, minus the broken nose. "He's much older than he looks. When were you born again? 1702, was it?" Severus nodded. </p><p>"But..... you grew up at Hogwarts with Lily?" </p><p>"The glamour changes everything. He grew and changed exactly as he should have, except he has been way older for a long time. My Father needed a young man to spy on both you and Voldemort. He did the same for Grindewald. You could undo it, it's ancient vampire magic." </p><p>—————————-•—————————-</p><p>Let me know if you would like to see this in a full book! This scene is roughly 4-8 chapters from the beginning, and may end up a little different, depending on what plot I go with, but this scene has been begging to be written down. All mistakes are mine. I literally wrote this in like 10 minutes.</p>
