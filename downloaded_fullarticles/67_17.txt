    <p>The Burton family of Centerport, New York were an unusual bunch. Daisy and Fred Burton were lovers of peace and freedom and did not support the wars, magical or non-magical, that is. Fred had narrowly missed being drafted to Vietnam, but rumors of a third world war for the purity of magical blood was on the rise. As a squib, he felt altogether useless and had fallen into a depression as he watched his friends and brothers enlist, some losing their lives.   </p><p>Daisy Burton, who was once a socialite from a wealthy family known to No-Maj and Magical folk alike in America, had left her share of her family fortune for love.  Their small family still prospered, as they had two beautiful daughters.    Even though he was a squib and penniless, Daisy Burton-VonAugbert would forever be helplessly in love with Fred. Her Fred. After all, their love had been one for the ages. They married in secret on a trip to India, costing her an inheritance. After an era of experimenting with spiritual magic known only to the countries in the East, they returned to America. If you had asked her, she would have told you that she couldn't have cared less about the money, because her daughters and her husband were her world.  </p><p>Fred took a job at the American Ministry and worked to provide for them. Their young daughters were doted on by their mother, but felt in a way, that they hardly knew their father, as he was always working, or disappearing for weeks at a time.  When he was home, he often withdrew into himself, lost in his own world.</p><p>While the VonAugbert family had cut Daisy out of their will for her choices, they still kept in touch- for they could never deny the happiness of their two beloved granddaughters: Summer and Samsara.  The Burtons came to the agreement with the VonAugberts: they would provide a trust fund for each of their granddaughters when they came of adult age. Their only wish, in return, was that when (not if) Summer and Samsara were of magical age, they would attend Hogwarts, rather than Ilvermorny, as the VonAugberts had done for centuries.   After graduation, they could gain access to their entrusted funds. </p><p>This was all to uphold the prestigious name of the VonAugbert pureblood family.  When the VonAugberts moved to the United States in the 1920s after the infamous prophecy of WW2 by Elise VonAugbert, they had been shocked at the strict magical laws and wayward magical education in America.  No, the esteemed magical bloodline of the VonAugbert family, whose lineage connected to Merlin himself, would not mix with the riffraff of Ilvermorny.   No, it was decided by their grandparents that the girls would resume the long line of VonAugbert studies at Hogwarts. They would simply need to be escorted to London each fall to attend the best wizarding school in the world. Only the best for their girls, and under the newly appointed headmaster Albus Dumbledore, no less.</p><p>Summer and Samsara Burton had been thick as thieves their entire childhood. While Summer was four years older, she had always included her sister in everything she did. She shared her dolls, her clothes, and waited patiently for her younger sister to catch up when she ran around the yard. When she received her letter from Hogwarts, however, she was sad to realize that her new adventure to the UK was something she couldn't share with her little sister.  When Summer headed to Hogwarts, everything had changed.</p><p>When efforts to pack herself in her older sister's trunk failed and her grandparents had taken her sister before she could properly say goodbye, Samsara cried into her pillow for days. What was worse- when her sister came back, all she would talk of were her new friends and the magic she got to do.   She never told Samsara much about Hogwarts or anything at all.  She was simply not the Summer that Samsara had idolized her whole life. She would shut herself in her room to read her new school books and send owls to her friends, ignoring her sister except to make rude comments on her lack of magical abilities.  </p><p>Samsara had been worried, and now she was devastated. Four had years passed, it was late August, and the future looked bleak.  She hadn't done magic at all.  She believed her life was a proper tragedy, for she feared she might be a truly be squib: never be able to relate to her sister anymore. Worse still, she felt she had lost her best friend. Homeschooled, she threw herself into books, reading everything she could get her hands on to ignore her loneliness. Then, she could ignore her show-off sister in return whenever she was especially insufferable.</p><p>Summer loved being doted on by her grandparents and showed off plenty to them over every Christmas and summer vacation. See, in America, magical laws allowed underage practice of school-learned spells in the privacy of one's home with parental permission. It was the second amendment of the magical constitution, after all. Only when she went back to the UK did she have to pocket her wand and wait until school started to use spells again.</p><p>Samsara couldn't really make up her mind about how she would feel about being a squib. While she was gutted that she might never see Hogwarts, she had grown to understand her father better.  She thought about what it was like to know the magical world but not get to participate in it.   She supposed she saw a side of her dad occasionally that her sister had never seen before.  A joyful, funny side of him at times when he had enough rest and wasn't withdrawn in his depression.  He taught her a great deal about No-Maj inventions, and she had no shortage of curiosity for everything he showed her from non-magical cars to microwaves.</p><p>On one sinfully warm Long Island summer day, Chelsea and Robert VonAugbert were visiting their granddaughters. Fred, who had come home from a recent treatment at St. Jouge's, was at the grill, cooking for everyone. While he had returned from his mental health care very quiet and sleepy, he had begun feeling a bit more comfortable around his family again. He had tried to find ways to bond with Summer, whose life he had already missed a great deal of, but she shunned him the same way she shunned Samsara when she was home.  He chalked it up to her being a teenager.   At least with Samsara, he could do no wrong.  She didn't hold it against him when he was having an episode and cherished the happy moments that were few and far between. They bonded over books, and he had shared a few of his childhood favorites with her.  Samsara was reading one of the books he gave her under a shaded tree when her sister approached.</p><p>"Aww Samsara, what's this? Reading another No-Maj book?" Summer taunted her sister, laughing.</p><p>Samsara glanced up from her Box Car Children book to raise an eyebrow at her sister.   For a newly turned eleven-year-old, Samsara showed an aloofness beyond her age. She considered herself to be above petty meanness, believing as her grandmother had always said, "You catch more flies with honey than vinegar."</p><p>"Of course a squib like yourself would read something like that." Summer continued, in a voice low enough that her mother and grandparents wouldn't hear.</p><p>Samsara frowned, not wanting to give her sister the satisfaction of a reaction. It felt like a punch in the gut, though. Her birthday, August 17th, had come and gone and she hadn't done any magic or received her Hogwarts letter. Biting her lip, she started reading over the paragraph that she had left off, forgetting what it had said. The words still didn't register in her mind the second time around, and a pit formed in her stomach.</p><p>"Helloooo," A hand with green fingernail polish waved in front of Samsara's face. "Listen, Squibby Sammy, when I'm talking to you."</p><p>Samsara ground her teeth but maintained a neutral expression when suddenly her book was ripped from her hands and levitating in the air.</p><p>Samsara mustered as much of a glare as the sweet-looking 11-year old could manage at her sister who waved her dark, riveted wand in the air.</p><p>"Summer, Give. It. Back" The young girl stood from where she sat.</p><p>"Make me, Squibby Sammy," Summer smirked down at her. "Oh, wait... You can't."</p><p>Samsara closed her eyes, reaching a hand out to the book, willing it to come to her hand.  She willed herself to feel energy humming, warmth, or anything really.  Any sign of magic she would have welcomed.</p><p>Summer laughed loudly, breaking her sister's concentration.</p><p>"Oh, Sammy. Magic doesn't work like that," She said between fits of fake laughs, "Wow, you really are a Squib, aren't you."</p><p>"Am not!" Samsara was fuming.</p><p>"Are too!" Summer spat, "You're just like daddy."</p><p>"Well, dad's wonderful," Samsara stepped forward, "You would know that if you gave him a chance. So, stuff it! you... you... Communist!"</p><p>Samsara winced at her words. She had already failed her experiment in "killing with kindness." Communist was a bad word, she had guessed. Her father had said it once or twice while yelling at the television as he watched the news. She didn't really know what it really meant, but in context, she decided it was an insult.</p><p>Summer sent a withering glare at her little sister who stood her ground.</p><p>"What... did you just call me?" Summer stepped closer so they were toe to toe. "Don't speak to your superiors that way, Squib."</p><p>Samsara had never felt hatred before, but it was definitely an ugly feeling. It was a burning feeling in her chest. A feeling she had never expected to feel towards her sister, who she had always looked up to.</p><p>She wished she could just sock her sister right in her smug face for saying bad things about their Dad. Samsara wondered if Hogwarts was what had made her like this, just so... mean. If it were true, she didn't want to go there.  A place full of prissy show-offs? No thank you.</p><p>Although, the only thing that would have been nice about going would be finally getting a pet to take with her. She had dreamed of getting an owl and was surprised when Summer had picked a cat over a more useful familiar.</p><p>Snapping back to the present, Samsara decided she had enough of her sister's taunting. She wound her fist back to make a punch when suddenly the book dropped to the ground with a thud. Samsara and Summer paused, looking at it.  It twitched a couple of times before going still.  Summer's wand was lowered, and she looked as if she had seen a ghost.</p><p>After a beat, Samsara reached a hand out tentatively to pick it up, when it jolted suddenly off the ground into the air again, flapping its pages like a bird's wings.    Aggressively, it flapped its hardbound cover at Summer's head who shrieked, running away.   A page folded into a sharp beak and began pecking at her.   Samsara stood shocked still, watching with her jaw hanging open. Her sister screamed again, and Samsara craned her neck around the side of the tree to see who had cast the spell, her mother or her grandparents- but they were blissfully unaware of it all. They were chatting away happily, completely unaware of their daughters' spat. That is until Summer went running to them, crying to her grandparents, and pointing at Samsara.</p><p>Chelsea VonAugbert flicked her wand and the book stilled, lowering to the table and folding neatly. She looked to Samsara who was still partially hidden behind the tree with a sly smile and raised a hand to wave her over.</p><p>"Samsara, dear, come here." She commanded softly.</p><p>Samsara cringed, walking over to her grandmother quickly. Chelsea was a fearsome person whenever she was angry or displeased, which was often.</p><p>"Samsara, is this your book, darling?" She asked, her face not giving any signs of emotion.</p><p>Samsara didn't see the point in lying. She nodded. Her grandmother raised an eyebrow. Samsara knew that look. Oh no.</p><p>"I-, I don't know what happened." She looked to her sister who was pouting in the arms of their grandfather. Robert was doing his best not to look thoroughly amused by the situation as he patted her back affectionately. Samsara fought the urge to roll her eyes at her sister soaking up the attention.</p><p>"Darling, this is... a wonderful thing," Her grandmother extended an elegant, manicured hand to place it on the girl's shoulder. "You did it... magic!"</p><p>Samsara looked on in awe as her grandmother's eyes began to tear up. She had never seen her cry, well, not in happiness at least. Rage, certainly, but never joy.</p><p>Daisy clapped excitedly from the side, standing to hug her daughter. It was her father, however, that Samsara looked to, who reassured her with a tentative smile.</p><p>"I... I did?" Samsara wasn't entirely convinced.</p><p>"This is a cause for celebration, our granddaughter is a witch!" Chelsea VonAugbert clapped her hands together, before reaching into her enchanted handbag and retrieving a handkerchief which she used to delicately dab at her eyes.</p><p>Summer glowered at her sister, and then stormed inside. Her grandfather shrugged, sipping his cocktail in his seat again. Samsara didn't know how to feel, just then. Did this mean she could go to Hogwarts after all? The term started in less than two weeks. She went to bed that night clutching her stuffed-animal owl, Bert. Her father's mother had sewn it magically for her, along with a matching one for her sister. It had two large, flat beads for eyes, and it was a bit worn from use. It was stout, fluffy, and the only thing that could comfort the young girl at a time like this. Samsara hoped everything would work out alright as she fell into a fitful sleep</p>
