    <p class="p1">Hermione Granger was livid. Not a single one of her superiors had bothered to tell her the truth, probably because they knew she’d be furious at having absolutely no say in who boarded her beloved ship, the Fortuna Major.</p>
<p class="p1">She’d been expecting a delegation of scientists, possibly with a team of xenology-trained security specialists, and certainly a scholar or two added in for accurate documentation.</p>
<p class="p1">Admiral Kingsley had told her that their identities had to remain confidential until the very moment they boarded her ship, and she was happy to oblige, knowing it was an honor to be chosen for this mission in the first place. But remembering the concern in his eye, she wondered now whether the reason it had to remain confidential wasn’t to safeguard the mission from the public, but to keep her from refusing the mission entirely.</p>
<p class="p1">At any rate, seeing a half-dozen <em>Slytherins</em> swaggering their slimy way up the corridor to the entrance of her ship had her seething. He <em>knew</em>. That insufferable, egotistical Admiral <em>knew</em> and he’d deliberately not told her.</p>
<p class="p1">Outwardly, she tried to keep her calm, as she stood there in her full dress uniform with her entire crew, ready to welcome the delegation onboard.</p>
<p class="p1">But Ron and Harry were already shooting her concerned looks.</p>
<p class="p1">They could see what she saw. Standing just a step below her, as befit her Executive Officer—and with her lead Pilot a step below that—put them all on roughly the same plane. And the glint of unapologetically platinum blond hair at the front of those green uniforms was unmistakable.</p>
<p class="p1">She shook her head, almost imperceptibly. There was no choice now.</p>
<p class="p1">As the delegation drew closer, the black-robed honor guards—nicknamed Death Eaters because of their lethal abilities and their insatiable desire to deal death—escorted them with pomp and circumstance, and Hermione was able to make out a few more familiar faces.</p>
<p class="p1">The tall, dark man was undoubtedly Blaise Zabini, and the pug-faced woman at his side with her nose turned up in disdain could only be Pansy Parkinson. The two women with the same features but different colored hair was most likely the Greengrass sisters, though Hermione had no idea which was which.</p>
<p class="p1">Pulling up the rear and looking just as unhappy on the outside as Hermione was feeling on the inside, was Theodore Nott. She recognized that constant pinched look on his face as if he’d just stepped in something foul.</p>
<p class="p1">Pureblood Slytherin royalty, all of them.</p>
<p class="p1">And none more so than the man at their head.</p>
<p class="p1">His expensive, green uniform shone with an abundance of silver accents, marking him out as their highest-ranking officer. The others bunched up behind him while he led the way.</p>
<p class="p1">But he didn’t need those little tricks to make it clear that he was in charge. It was in the way he walked, as if he owned every inch of this stretch of corridor. It was in the angle of his head, proud and imperious. It was in the subtle smirk—the exact one that had always made Hermione grit her teeth—when he realized that she was watching him approach.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco Malfoy, the last scion of the House of Malfoy—the closest thing the Slytherins had to a Prince since the Federation had formed and done away with those hereditary titles.</p>
<p class="p1">Draco Malfoy, the most infuriating git she’d ever laid eyes on, who had done nothing but make her Space Academy days complete hell.</p>
<p class="p1">When he wasn’t insulting her hair and her background or sabotaging her projects, he was using his influence and charm to unfairly advance his own interests and those of his pet followers.</p>
<p class="p1">It looked like he had continued with those unsavory habits through into his adulthood, as Hermione could see no other way all those same specters from her childhood could end up together on her literal doorstep.</p>
<p class="p1">As if he knew exactly what she thinking, Malfoy’s grin only grew wider as everyone came to a stop and the Death Eaters parted to allow him to come forward.</p>
<p class="p1">“Greetings, Captain Granger!” he called out, far too jovially for Hermione’s taste.</p>
<p class="p1">She couldn’t bring herself to answer him with a smile, or even with words. A short acknowledging nod was the best she could do as she raged over spending the next two to three months locked onto one ship with him.</p>
<p class="p1">Fortunately for her, her XO took over.</p>
<p class="p1">“<em>Commander</em> Malfoy,” Harry said, emphasizing his title in a way that made it seem like he thought the title was an honorary one, “how unexpected to see you here today. I’d like to say it’s a pleasant surprise.” The conspicuous pause afterwards made it clear that the surprise was anything other than pleasant.</p>
<p class="p1">“Were you not informed that we’d be coming, Potter?” Draco raised one perfectly manicured eyebrow. “Perhaps you’d better check your messages to find ones that you might have overlooked. I know that reading was never one of your strongest subjects.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, we can read all right,” Ron chimed in. “We just thought we’d be getting qualified professionals, not a bunch of coddled purebloods out for a lark. Did your daddy get you this mission?”</p>
<p class="p1">As one, all the Slytherins eyes narrowed on Ron. Hermione was surprised he didn’t expire on the spot from the amount of animosity suddenly directed at him. He’d clearly struck a nerve.</p>
<p class="p1">“Enough,” she said, quietly. With a hand on Ron’s arm, and a glance at Harry, she stopped them both from continuing further.</p>
<p class="p1">It looked like it was once again up to her to keep diplomatic relations.</p>
<p class="p1">She drew herself up to her full height. “Commander Malfoy,” she said, drawing attention back to herself. “As the captain of the Fortuna Major, I apologize for the—” she paused, trying to figure out how best to apologize without lying, “—I would like to welcome you—” She paused again, cringing at her words. It wasn’t like her to not have exactly the thing she wanted to say right at her fingertips.</p>
<p class="p1">Inwardly, she cursed Kingsley again.</p>
<p class="p1">Malfoy’s ire seemed to fade into amusement as he watched her collect herself. He obviously knew they weren’t at all welcome and was enjoying watching her squirm in discomfort.</p>
<p class="p1">“Permission to come aboard, Captain?” he asked, after a moment. “Perhaps we can discuss both apologies and welcomes in more hospitable surroundings. I’d like to get my crew settled as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="p1">She waited a beat longer than was polite to grant permission, but she noted with pride that when she did, the rest of her crew—even Ron and Harry—parted with military precision to let them pass.</p>
<p class="p1">Fred and George had a particularly sly look in their eyes, but she sent them a glare that would hold them off for at least a couple of hours. Hopefully.</p>
<p class="p1">Sighing, and sharing an eye roll with Harry behind the backs of the Slytherins, she led the way into the ship.</p>
