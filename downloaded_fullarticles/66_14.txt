</p><p>The first time Neville sees her, it’s been barely a week since the battle of Hogwarts, and between the reconstruction and helping Madam Pomfrey to heal the wounded, he’s so tired that he thinks, in the thirty seconds that it takes him to close his eyes, that that girl must have been a hallucination conjured by his mind.</p><p>The second time is twelve hours later, when he opens his eyes, and she is still there staring at him.</p><p>"Can I help you?" he asks, because he is used to the strange behavior of ghosts and thinks that it’s probably normal for her to be still there - he has never seen this particular ghost before, but he imagines that all ghosts act in the same way.</p><p>The girl continues to stare at him, but doesn't answer.</p><p>"Um, ok," Neville continues, becoming more and more awake by the second. "Well, you're not from here, so you must be new... I'm Neville," he adds, noticing the strange clothes the girl wears - a long richly embroidered tunic that covers her whole body and that, Neville imagines, must have had very bright colors. <em>Was this girl at the battle?</em>  </p><p>"I know who you are," she says, speaking for the first time, a particular accent that Neville can't identify.</p><p>"Well," he replies, trying to force himself to remember what the Friar had told him in fourth year about what it meant to be a new ghost. What did he say? That in the first few days you feel disoriented, that you go looking for the thing that is most familiar to you -</p><p>"You killed me a week ago."</p><p>Neville, who was lost in thought, with those words feels the blood in his veins froze. "No!" he replies, perhaps more vehemently than necessary. "Look, it couldn't have been me."</p><p>The girl keeps looking at him, and Neville doesn't know if that's a good sign. <em> Could she have been a death eater? But even if she were, it couldn't have been me anyway . </em>"It was a difficult war," he says slowly, "many people died. But I didn't kill anyone. The only thing I killed was - "</p><p>"A snake," replies the girl. There is almost a hint of a smile on her face. "Nagini."</p><p>"Exactly!" Neville replies. "So I can't-"</p><p>"You beheaded me," continues the girl as if she hadn't heard him. "Right here," she says, pulling down the high neck of her strange dress, where a big mark, exactly like the one on Sir Nicholas’, is present all over her neck.</p><p>Neville looks at her, petrified, until she pulls up her dress and leans on the bed next to him.</p><p>After that, she throws himself at him.</p><p>She does that with such an impact and violence that Neville doesn’t even notice it before it’s too late.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>When he recovers - and someone must have entered the dormitory and must have found him badly beaten up, because he wakes up in the infirmary - she is gone.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey tells him to be more careful next time to avoid banging his head, and Neville, still shaken, just nods and leaves the infirmary (luckily emptier than it was in the past few days, given the fact that many people have recovered or ended up at San Mungo for more in-depth care) escorted by Ginny and Luna to the Great Hall for lunch.</p><p>He does not see the ghost for the whole day, nor the following one, and he could even dismiss the incident as a strange dream, but in his heart he knows that it really happened.</p><p>That Nagini, Voldemort's snake, is really a ghost, and apparently a woman. And that she’s here, in Hogwarts.</p><p>He would like to talk about the incident with his two best friends, Ginny and Luna, but he doesn't want to trouble them; Ginny is still in mourning for her brother and Luna for her father, and moreover all of them are occupied with the reconstruction, so it does not seem appropriate to fill their heads with worries, especially for a story that has only occurred once.</p><p>He could talk to someone else (like Hermione, or Harry, or an adult) but he’s always had a hard time talking to people who don't belong to his close circle of friends, especially of things like this; a part of him is afraid to talk to them because he fears that they may judge him as his parents are judged  - the magical world is very afraid of mental illness, and although Neville is sure that he has not hallucinated anything, the risk that someone else could think that is too high to risk.</p><p>The ghosts can't help him, because none of them has seen the ghost of an oriental girl around, nor do they know where she might have gone. He even asks the Bloody Baron, who has always frightened him, and the Gray Lady, who has always made him uneasy, but they are not useful either.</p><p>In the end, his choice falls on Harry, thanks to a thought that comes to him when he tries to reflect about the ways in which Voldemort could have imprisoned a woman in the body of a snake: Harry is the person who knew Voldemort best, and moreover he is the person who had asked him to kill the snake, who better than him can know if Voldemort's snake was a woman or not?</p><p>So, a week after seeing Nagini for the first time, he goes to ask Harry Potter.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The perfect time to ask Harry about it is that afternoon, when he and Harry find themselves having to repair a small side of the castle that has collapsed after the countless <em>stupeficiums</em> that have been thrown at it.</p><p>Flitwick taught them a basic spell to reposition each castle stone in its place, a simple thing within the ability of all Hogwarts students - except only the early years, who anyway had returned home after the funeral, and after having experienced that war with their own eyes.</p><p><em>No child should have witness such horrors</em>, Neville thinks, <em>and neither should have we</em>.</p><p>He thinks about the last year he had spent at Hogwarts, at the Carrow, at Snape (he knows now that nothing that he thought about the man was true, he heard Harry's speech on the loyalty that Snape had for his mother and for Dumbledore, but this doesn't make the memories of that year any less terrible), and then thinks about what Harry, Ron and Hermione must have experienced, alone against the whole country in search of ways to defeat Voldemort. Children of just 18 years old.</p><p>And so, partly to divert his attention from those thoughts, partly to take advantage of the fact that he and Harry are alone, Neville takes courage and asks him if he knows, by chance, some information about Nagini: more precisely, if he knows if that snake was ever a human once.</p><p>But Harry doesn't react as Neville would have expected, that is perplexity or fear. He just looks at him, in a completely apathetic way, which reminds Neville again how many ugly things Harry must have seen – they all have seen those in that past year, but Harry is the worst of them - and he asks: " How do you know?"</p><p>"So is that true?" Neville asks. "Was Nagini really a woman?"</p><p>"She had a curse, it’s called maledictus. It makes you forget you were a human, slowly making you become a snake," Harry replies, rubbing his eyes, and Neville notices that pieces of ground and concrete cover his hands and now his brow. "By the time Voldemort found her, she was almost completely turned."</p><p>Neville has absolutely no idea about any of this, but he trusts Harry on that. "Did Dumbledore tell you?"</p><p>"Yes... it was in fifth year, when I saw her attack on Arthur Weasley. Remember?" Neville nods. "He told me she couldn't control it, that her human mind was lost forever. He spoke of it with much sadness... I think he knew her well."</p><p><em> So I didn't dream it </em> , Neville thinks, <em> it was really her ghost </em>. Neville, who was sure of it, feels nonetheless a weight slip off his shoulders: a part of him feared that he had lost his mind - the fear of his life, after having always had to deal with his parents since he was a baby.</p><p>"But you didn't tell me how you know it," Harry continues, moving a stone and gently lifting it back into place. Neville, who is helping him for that wall, does the same with a stone next to his one.</p><p>"I..." he begins, but then he notices Ron and George coming in their direction. "We'll talk about it later," he concludes, and although Harry looks at him strangely, he doesn't comment.</p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>At dinner, that night, Neville takes Harry aside and quietly confesses that he has seen Nagini as a ghost.</p><p>Harry, predictably, takes it very badly: Neville spends a good half hour consoling him that he hasn't done anything wrong, that killing Nagini was the key to destroying Voldemort - Hermione told him that, after the battle, even if Neville still doesn't quite know why this is so - and that, at best, Neville is the one to blame for that kill, not Harry.</p><p>"I think she has it in for me," he continues. "The only time I saw here she threw herself at me and... it made me pass out somehow, I think."</p><p>Harry becomes even paler with this statement. "Where is she now?" he asks, his tone nervous and worried. “We need to talk to her. She mustn't hurt you because of me. "</p><p>"Harry, relax," Neville replies, trying to calm him down. "I don't know where she is. I searched for her all week without success. "</p><p>But Harry almost seems not to have heard him. "Did you ask anyone if they saw her?"</p><p>"I asked the ghosts," Neville replies softly, “but they didn't saw her. And I haven't talked to anyone else but you. "</p><p>Neville almost expects Harry to ask him why - and he doesn't know, at that point, if he would feel like giving a sincere answer - but he notes that Harry isn't even listening to him. He's visibly nervous, he seems almost about to start move forward and back to release the tension Neville sees in his body language.</p><p>"I didn't know..." he begins, the voice barely a breath. "Dumbledore had told me that... that she was no longer aware of herself... "</p><p>Neville, who is now really worried, is almost about to touch him and ask him if he wants to take a calming draught, but before he can do it Harry stops, and his gaze suddenly becomes hard and cruel. Neville thinks that he has never seen his friend so out of control, even in great moments of anger.</p><p>"We'll look for her tonight," Harry replies in a mean tone. Neville, surprised by that tone and by how Harry is behaving, does not know what to say: then, immediately afterward, Harry deflates, as if suddenly the force had vanished from his body. His expression becomes deeply sad. "Too many people have died because of me," he whispers, "too many ..."</p><p>"Don't say that," Neville replies, hugging him, trying in that hug to communicate how much love and admiration he feels for him, a boy on which the world has put too much weight on his shoulders. "It is not true. And Nagini will understand it."</p>
