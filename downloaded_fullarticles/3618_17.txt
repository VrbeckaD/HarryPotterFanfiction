  <strong>Killian's POV</strong>
</p><p>"Come on, Liam!" "Slow down, Little Brother!" "It's Younger Brother!" Killian shouted over his shoulder in order to be heard over the voices of the new and returning Hogwarts students. Killian pulled to an abrupt stop. He didn't hear Liam stop behind him and follow his gaze to the blonde staring up at the Hogwart's Express. He was finally pulled out of his reverie by Liam's voice saying, "Well, what are you waiting for? Go talk to her!"<strike></strike></p>
<hr/><p>Killian paused before tentatively reaching his hand out and tapping the blonde's shoulder. She jumped at his touch and turned around. Killian was suddenly greeted with vibrant, green eyes. He momentarily lost his voice before he stuck out his hand a bit awkwardly and said, "Hi, I'm Killian Jones. Is this your first year too?" "Emma, and yes." she responded. Liam chose that moment to appear at Killian's side.</p>
<hr/><p>"Liam Jones at your service. This is my Little Brother, Killian." "It's Younger Brother" Emma let out a quiet chuckle only to be responded with a glare from Killian. Behind Emma, the Hogwart's Express blew its warning whistle. "Well you two, it seems that we must get on to the train. I'll see you later Killian, aye?" "Aye" He gave a quick hug to Liam before they boarded the train and parted ways.</p>
