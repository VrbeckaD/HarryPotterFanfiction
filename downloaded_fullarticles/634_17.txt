    <p>Even the most ordinary of people could tell, something extraordinary had taken place. The colorful, robed figures gathered around? The showers of shooting stars? The mysteriously active owls? That wasn't normal. Although the muggle world had no idea what had come to be, they found themselves watching news reports about the strange occurences all over the country. Although some people were so caught up in their normal routines to notice, that didn't make the day any less of an event for the people of the wizarding world. All because Harry Potter was The Boy Who Lived.</p><p>Harry was nothing more than a tiny bundle of warmth in his gigantic uncle's arms, swaddled in slightly charred blankets from the remains of his former home. Hagrid, to be quite, honest, had no idea what he was doing. He mumbled to himself on the whole ride to Hogwarts, sitting on the back of young Sirius Black's motorcycle as he cradled his little nephew in his hands. Lily and James, Harry's parents, had wanted Sirius to be Harry's guardian if they were to pass. But there was a change of plans. While Sirius wanted to honor their wishes, he had something important to do, and didn't want to be endangering his godson. So there they were on a flying motorcycle, on their way to Hogwarts, where little Harry would be staying.</p><p>Sirius believed he could trust in Hagrid, but the half-giant wasn't so sure. Although his quiet mumbling wasn't at all audible over the sound of the wind and the motorcycle, he couldn't drown out his own thoughts. "Poor Lily and James, gone so quickly... Poor Harry, orphaned so young that he won't even remember his own parents... How will I take care of him? Young Sirius puts too much faith in me. I'm just a silly old man." </p><p> They arrived. Hagrid fell silent. When he was the only one who could hear, it was all well and good, but he felt uncomfortable about the idea of being heard. His voice was rough and his eyes were puffy from all of the crying he had done, and if somebody asked him about it he wasn't sure if he would be able to stop himself from breaking down into tears again. He waved goodbye to Sirius and went into his cottage, setting Harry down in a large woven basket full of blankets. It was time to wait for Dumbledore. </p>
