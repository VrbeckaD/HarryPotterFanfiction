    <p>He thought he saw her flinch – though only for a split second – but when he looked again, there she was… standing straight, almost an inch shorter than all the rest of the kids in line. She looked so young and frail to him in the moment. Draco wanted to snort. Did his little sister really think that putting up a brave facade was enough to fool him?<br/>
He looked from her back to McGonagall holding up the parchment. In a moment, his little sister would be called forward and Draco was certain whatever anxieties she was holding back would come crashing into her like a violent wave.<br/>
She was brave, yes – maybe too much for his own taste, a constant, unpleasant reminder that she was not his sister by blood – but she was also intelligent, cunning, always finding ways around every problem, she had ambition, once even confiding in him that she wanted to be Minister for Magic when she grew up, make Father proud of her.<br/>
Draco forced a smile on his face. She’d be placed in Slytherin, he knew it. She had to be. Every child born to the Malfoy family had been placed in Slytherin since they first came to England, and Clare, despite not bearing the name like him, was a Malfoy.<br/>
“Black, Clarisse!” called McGonagall.<br/>
Draco stiffened as he watched his sister step forward, what little colour she had completely drained from her face, but that stubborn look still firmly plastered all across.<br/>
Pansy placed a hand atop his, “Are you all right, Draco?” she asked with a worried look.<br/>
Draco just huffed, “Of course I am,” he said, “I just want it all to be over so she can come join us at the table and we can enjoy the feast.”<br/>
The others at the table looked anything but convinced.<br/>
Draco turned to look at Clare again. She was still sitting in the stool, her hands gripping the edges for dear life.<br/>
He almost felt like holding his breath, thinking she was taking long – too long.<br/>
She was going to be placed in Slytherin. She had to be. Father wouldn’t have it any other way, he’d warned her about it, Draco knew – he’d been eavesdropping.<br/>
What was taking her so long?<br/>
Draco felt his heart beating against his chest as he watched her sit there, unmoving. He couldn’t see her face – he could only imagine what was going through her head. He hoped it wasn’t fear.<br/>
The rip near the brim of the hat opened.<br/>
Draco held his breath.<br/>
“SLYTHERIN!” the Sorting Hat shouted to the hall.<br/>
All the air came rushing out of him in a wave of relief as the table erupted in applause and cheers.<br/>
McGonagall took off the Sorting Hat from her head and Draco could see her face at last, the same look of relief as his also plastered across hers.<br/>
“Welcome to Slytherin,” Blaise stood up from his seat to shake her hand when she got to the table.<br/>
Draco scoffed, “Don’t think I’ll let you near my sister, Zabini,” he told the other boy.<br/>
The others laughed.<br/>
Clare turned a pale pink and chuckled as well, “Hello, brother,” she said, sitting down next to him on the seat Theodore had been kind enough to offer her.<br/>
“Sister,” Draco nodded.<br/>
That was all the introduction they needed, then they both turned back around and looked up at the line of students still waiting to be sorted into their houses.<br/>
He felt joy, truly, not only because Clare was out of any danger now, but because he got to share the next six years of his Hogwarts career with her. It would be just like when they were kids, he thought, almost mindlessly placing his arm around her tiny shoulders.<br/>
He didn’t see it, but he knew she was smiling to herself, probably thinking the same thing.</p>
