    <p>Grace Potter frantically thought over just how to escape the graveyard, foggy headed from the stunning spell and the sheer exhaustion she felt.<br/>
<br/>
She had gotten lucky a time or two, or had help the other times, now she was alone completely and it was up to her to save her... Then again, that’s how it was always at the end.<br/>
<br/>
She doubted she’d be able to get lucky this time tied to an angel statue as she was, her wand taken and feeling like she’d gone head to head with a hippogriff.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about it, she decided if there was an opportunity she’d use it.   She had one power she’d kept hidden, it wasn’t all that useful anyway and people would surely freak out over it worse than second year when they discovered her ability to speak to snakes.  As far as she could tell was the wandless equivalent to a confundus charm, one that came to existence as she’d wished desperately for her relatives to leave her alone when she finally realized that no, they wouldn’t come to see how useful she was being and start to love her.<br/>
<br/>
It was far weaker and getting someone to do something they were against, and getting the Dursleys to treat her like a decent human being was beyond it’s power.  Fortunately it could enhance what was already there, their desire not have to deal with her freakishness saw them leave her mostly alone.  It’d backfired in the Summer before second year a bit as they’d locked her up after the cake incident which even her magic couldn’t push them to ignore, but worked just fine once she was locked away in ‘her’ room.<br/>
<br/>
Still, despite it’s draw backs she wondered if there would be a chance to use it here, somehow, someway.<br/>
<br/>
She saw the rat bastard Wormtail gently lower the, excuse her Dursley-ism, freak of a dark lord in it’s baby like body into the bubbling cauldron and couldn’t help but wish it’d drown.<br/>
<br/>
Summoning something into his hand, Peter shouted  “Bone of the Father unknowingly taken, you shall revive your Son!” He shouted and tossed in a handful of powdered bone, the potion turning an acidic green.  Revive?  No!  She had to do something to screw it up.<br/>
<br/>
Paying close attention she saw to her shock Peter drawing a knife nearly as long as his forearm out of seemingly no where setting it against his wrist and the edge of the cauldron, and as he talk figured it out casting her single wandless spell in a bout of vindictiveness.<br/>
<br/>
“F-Flesh of the Servant, you will revive your Master!”  At the last moment Peter wondered why he was cutting off his hand, he needed that.  Shaking it off he pulled out from his robes things he used far less often, things that had never been appreciated by another and with a wimper and not daring to look cut through them with his knife.  <br/>
<br/>
Unnaturally strong the knife cut through them like butter and Peter was left desperately clutching his crotch with a hand whimpering.  Why had he done that?  Sure, his thoughts had all been true but, why!<br/>
<br/>
“Couldn’t you just have used a pinky finger?  It would have been bigger and more impressive!”  Grace couldn’t help taunting the man even through her revulsion of what she’d done justified though it may be, and felt satisfied as he glared.<br/>
<br/>
Less so when he began stalking towards her with the knife.<br/>
<br/>
Crap!  What to do?  Having used it once before on him with success she was tempted to try again but she hardly knew what he was planning and how much he wanted to do it, though she had a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Peter stumbled a bit, wincing as he’d thought of hurting the daughter of his friend worse for taunting him.  In the end he restrained himself to a small nick on her already marred forehead.<br/>
<br/>
Hand still clutched to his bleeding crotch he yelled “Blood of the enemy forcefully taken, you shall revive your foe!” and flicked his knife, drops of the girl’s blood flying into the cauldron which began bubbling immensely the concoction evaporating as a man slowly stood.<br/>
<br/>
Grace’s scar felt like it was about to explode, and her stomach dropped, it hadn’t worked, none of it had worked.  He was back.<br/>
<br/>
She blinked as the smoke cleared revealing the Dark Lord who looked like a twenty year old Tom Riddle, long dark hair and a hint of boyish charm and a fit if thin physique. She couldn’t help the blush that bloomed on her face as he was just as nude as the day he’d been born.<br/>
<br/>
“My wand and robe.”  He said curtly, a look of fury on his face even as he got dressed himself rather than risk the Worm touching him with blood from there.<br/>
<br/>
“Your arm Worm.”<br/>
<br/>
He whimpered as he realized the arm the Dark Lord wanted,and quickly switched hands grasping himself touching the dark mark upon his arm with the barest of wand tips.   Peter screamed in agony.<br/>
<br/>
“I suppose you did revive me....  Incendio!” Wormtail yelped as his hand was burned forcing him to move it away from himself in pain- then screamed in utter agony as his wound was cauterized.<br/>
<br/>
“T-t-thank you, M-Master.”<br/>
<br/>
“Think nothing of it, ever again.  Don’t bring it up, don’t discuss it, or you will suffer.”<br/>
“Y-Yes Master!”  <br/>
<br/>
He drifted off into thought pondering aloud how many would come, then the pops started.  Soon he was surrounded by his faithful... Or was he?<br/>
<br/>
“Over a decade... Over a decade and not one of you made the barest attempt to find me... I am displeased.”<br/>
<br/>
Grace snorted.<br/>
<br/>
“Ah, and speaking of suffering, may I introduce you all to Grace Potter, my supposed downfall?  I wonder...”  He walked over even as the pain in her scar growing worse and worse.  Then he reached down and pressed a finger on it and it felt like she was the one on fire screaming and struggling to get away from it.<br/>
<br/>
He withdrew with a smirk.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, as I thought, any protection from your Mudblood Mother is long gone...”<br/>
<br/>
“D-don’t talk about my Mother, bastard!”<br/>
<br/>
He laughed at her, “Defiant even at your darkest hour.  I think I like that, and will enjoy utterly destroying that defiance, breaking you and reshaping you to my whims...”  He paused, briefly confused before shrugging it off as unimportant.<br/>
<br/>
Grace swallowed, she... she made a mistake didn’t she?  A swift death was looking mighty nice right now.<br/>
<br/>
“Forgive us my Lord!  But you’ve returned!  That’s all that matters right? .” a Death Eater said finally, even as Voldemort looked off into the distance as if pondering some great mystery even as he crucioed the man who dared think all was forgiven.<br/>
<br/>
“Ah, yes, that would be due to our ally Wormtail here.  He’s not the strongest, or the brightest, or even the most loyal...”  The Dark Lord said with a glare at the creature before allowing his features to blanken..<br/>
<br/>
“It is of no matter, after all, unlike the rest of you he found me, revived me... The loyalty he’s shown me is more than can be said about the rest of you.  Some have the excuse of Azkaban, you have none.”<br/>
<br/>
“Please forgive us master!”  A death eater yelled throwing himself on the ground before him.<br/>
<br/>
“Crucio!”  The man withered and screamed having held off a bare couple seconds, the spell suddenly broken as the Dark Lord looked down in confusion, having again felt something different in this body... Something not unpleasant, something he had regretted ritually sacrificing...<br/>
<br/>
His retrospection was brought to an end as he heard the pathetic mewing from his servant.<br/>
<br/>
“The plan, gentleman, and I use that term loosely in the case of some-”  A glance at the still whimpering figures laying before him and he carried on, ”-is simple.  You are, if you wish to even begin to make up for the years you spent not searching me out is to do nothing.  Dumbledore will know, but that does not mean the Ministry will.  No attacks, not even politically.  Breathe not a word of my revival, drop not a hint of my continued existence.  You are to  train up to your former and even greater strengths to serve me better as if this is what the cause has to work with it is better off without you. Additionally, The-Girl-Who-Lived is mine, none shall so much as look at her without my permit and if asked you know nothing about her, understood?”<br/>
<br/>
Grace Potter looked oddly satisfied with that, and he looked within and felt the magic at work, helping with it that the idea wasn’t abhorrent.  More... there as something familiar about her magic...<br/>
<br/>
“But the filthy blood-traitor- Ahhh!"’  The crucio hit the man sending him immediately screaming.<br/>
<br/>
“I did not give you permission to question my orders, I asked if it was understood, it is I trust?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes Master!  Please, I’m sorry!”<br/>
<br/>
He ignored the apology, not feeling all too forgiving.<br/>
<br/>
“Wormtail, go with another for healing, I shall make due on my own for a time.  You will be all be called when I am ready to act.  Her wand first, hm, a good match... It shall be a satisfactory spare....  Until next time, you are dismissed.”<br/>
<br/>
The one’s crucioed were the first gone, unsurprisingly.  They made good examples of just how furious he was with the lot of them.<br/>
<br/>
“Nagini, come.”  He said in parseltongue, and with a point the snake was climbing up the wizard ending draped across his shoulders, a pleasant reassuring weight letting him no he was no longer a spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Banishing the Tri-Wizard Cup at the spare champion’s corpse they vanished in a swirl, even as he turned his attention on the girl that had cost him time and time again.  <br/>
<br/>
A wave of his wand and the binds were vanished.  The girl took her chance running as fast as she could and he suddenly had an unnatural feeling to let her go, to allow her the chance to grow stronger so he could show his prowess at her defeat...<br/>
<br/>
“Crucio.”   She stumbled and fell, taking a good few seconds before the pain grew too much and she screamed in agony.  He held it only a few seconds longer as he stalked towards the girl, finally flicking his wand up releasing the connection.<br/>
<br/>
“A fairly good attempt, but not good enough to work on any occlumencer of any decent skill.”  He admitted, “I assume I have you to... thank for Wormtail’s improvisation? I shall have to do my utmost to repay you for that, oh yes...”  He absolutely reveled in the look of terror on Grace Potter’s face, and as ‘his’ snake awakened for the first time in half a century.  He knew then that though he had been revived the accursed girl had won a minor victory even in defeat.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow though, he found himself not caring as he finished stalking towards the girl who struggled desperately to crawl away, grabbing the back of her robes, and twisting in place apparating away.  </p>
<hr/><p>Snape appeared in the graveyard whirling about but found no one and nothing. His stomach sunk.  Damn Dumbledore.  Yes, we should make the Dark Lord <em>wait</em>, it’ll be fine!  Damn him!  Both Dumbledore and Voldemort and himself!   Grace Potter is assuredly dead and his cover just as likely is broken beyond repair!  The last bit of Lily in this world gone... It was just too much, he fell to his knees in despair.<br/>
<br/>
He considered his wand grimly before tossing it away, he was a potioneer first and foremost.  Breaking one of his molars the liquid was released from it and he died painlessly in seconds.</p>
