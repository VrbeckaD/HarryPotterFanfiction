<p> </p>
<p>1: The Transfer Student</p>

<p></p><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini fidgets nervously and glances at her mother who is just as nervous. Of course she's nervous. She is a non-mag after all. Her parents knew nothing of magic before they started receiving letters from this place for Angel Grove Academy. Her dad was so terrified he packed up and ran. Trini scoffs just thinking about him. Good riddance. He was a shit father anyways. Most wizards finished their schooling in one school but they had to move to London at the end of Trini's 4th year because of June's job. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I read about your new school," June says. "There was a big war here. A bunch of people died."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini nods. "Yes Hogwarts. I read every single thing about the school, I have access to the magic articles."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It's crazy that they move," June says with a shudder. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It takes getting used to," Trini says. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So what happened here? Will you be safe?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini smiles at her. "It's the best Wizarding and Witchcraft school in the entire world mom. Angel Grove was a good school but so...American. They didn't even teach us Defense Against The Dark Arts." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"That's not what I asked."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini sighs. "It's a long story, but basically this really dark wizard took over everything and he and his followers attacked the school and it turned into a war. The dark wizard was killed by a 7th year student named Harry Potter." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>June blinks in shock. "That doesn't sound safe."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini snorts. "It's fine mom, he's gone and Hogwarts has even more protection than before." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Are you sure you'll be okay here Trini?" June says. "I can find a job some way somehow so you can finish your studies at Angel Grove."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It'll be fine mom," Trini says. "The only thing I actually am worried about is this House business."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"House?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Angel Grove didn't do this, but Hogwarts divides up the school between four houses based on personality and character," Trini says. "Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. All students are sorted in their first year, so it's a bit nerve wracking to get sorted in the fifth year."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hm," June says. "Are you afraid you won't fit in?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini laughs. "When have I ever fit in mom?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The giant oak doors open and they are greeted by a old woman with a hard face but with a kind smile. "Ah, you must be Trini Gomez, a fifth year transfer from Angel Grove Academy. A rare treat for Hogwarts."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hello professor," Trini says with a respectful bow. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"And you must be Trini's mother," she says extending a hand to her. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>June smiles and shakes it saying, "June Gomez."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I am Professor Minerva McGonagall, professor of Transfiguration, former head of the Gryffindor house, now, the Headmaster of Hogwarts." She hands Trini a set of plain black robes with the school logo and says, "You have a wand and all your textbooks yes?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes professor," Trini says taking the robes. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You'll be in some remedial classes for Defense Against The Dark Arts with some of our top 5th year students but you are advanced in many other areas that Angel Grove teaches and we don't, like wandless and wordless magic," McGonagall says. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"And which house will I be in?" Trini says. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>McGonagall smiles. "Put on your robes so I can take you with the first years to the hall. Once the sorting hat sorts you, your robes will change according to whatever house it places you. Mrs. Gomez do come with me to finalize the last of the paperwork and then I will have our Groundskeeper Hagrid take you back to the homeland."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>McGonagall leads them into her office where she leads Trini into a private bathroom to change. The robes are so different than the uniforms at Angel Grove Academy. There she had to wear a short skirt and a way to tight blouse that did nothing to hide her large breasts. Her mother called them a gift but Trini called them a curse. Over the uncomfortable uniform they wore bright silver robes that had to remain open and were too thin to shield from the snow and cold. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The Hogwarts uniform is better. Comfortable black trousers, white button-up shirt that was actually made to accommodate her...gifts, a thin black tie, and a thick black robe that closes up over most of it and had plenty of room to carry books and her wand. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Once dressed Trini feels comfortable and at ease, though still nervous about where she might be placed. She exits the bathroom and finds McGonagall and June waiting for her. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Everything is done here," McGonagall says. "Hagrid is waiting outside but your mother wanted to say goodbye first."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Bye mom," Trini says hugging her mother tightly. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Bye sweetie," she responds giving Trini's temple a gentle kiss. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>June leaves with a tearful wave with a giant man with crazy hair that Trini can only assume is Hagrid. McGonagall guides her to the dining hall after that and the moment they enter everyone's eyes are on them. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini blushes. God how she hates being the center of attention. The first years are all lined up in front of a chair with a talking witch hat on it. All the teachers are sitting behind the hat in a long table, dressed in their robes. There are four long tables that go across the entire room each representing one of the houses with banners with their logos hanging above each table. Along the walls there are live pictures of several people with their names and dates engraved under them. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini notices that all their death dates are the same. They must have all been killed in the battle. The largest picture is of a slender old man with a long white beard that extends all the way down to his feet. She reads the name, Albus Dumbledore. Former Headmaster. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She heard of him before. One of the greatest wizards of all time. She doesn't even realize McGonagall left her side until she hears the woman speaking to the entire room. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Everyone's eyes are off of her and to the headmaster who stands straight and elegant before them. "Welcome students to a new year here at Hogwarts," she says. "I have made a big goal for us here at the school in order to recover all that we have lost. We owe it to all the students and teachers and others who lost their lives here last year to build Hogwarts back up to what it used to be under our headmaster Albus Dumbledore: The greatest school of Wizardry and Witchcraft in the entire world. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"The repairs have all been made, the teachers restaffed, and the student body reunited again to welcome new first years into our ranks," she pauses and looks at Trini. "But this year we have someone new. This hasn't been done in several decades since no really transfers between schools mid studies." She motions to Trini to walk to her and Trini gulps and walks to her nervously. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Everyone's eyes are on her and she feels her cheeks burn. She keeps her eyes straight forward not wanting to make eye contact with anyone. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"This is Trini Gomez," McGonagall says. "She is transferring as a 5th year from the school of Wizardry and Witchcraft in America called Angel Grove Academy. Though she is not a first year she must get placed as such because though she is not new to Witchcraft she is new to Hogwarts."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>McGonagall takes the sorting hat from the chair and motions for Trini to sit. Trini gulps and sits down facing the student body. It's a blur of red, blue, yellow, and green but a few people stick out. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>There's a girl sitting at the Gryffindor table not even paying attention. She has pale skin and freckles and long bright red hair. She sits facing away from the front staring at a portrait of a laughing cheerful man with red hair just like hers. Below his picture reads the name, "Fred Weasley." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Another boy sits at the Gryffindor table watching her so intensely it makes her feel uncomfortable. His blue eyes are piercing and he is staring practically into her soul. She tears her gaze away from him and her eyes land on a black boy sitting at the blue Ravenclaw table. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He is fidgeting with several magical trinkets on his table not paying attention to anything. She moves her gaze to the yellow Hufflepuff table. They all chatter excitedly but none of them stick out to her. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The Slytherin one is the most empty table of them all. Several seats are empty, but the ones that are there look serious and a bit...dark. At the front of the table an Asian boy sits fidgeting with his nails looking careless and annoyed and beside him...</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini gasps. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>In her life she has never seen someone so beautiful. The girl has short wavy hair that reaches her shoulders, perfect tan skin, and dark eyes that can melt even the strongest men to a weak puddle. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She feels the hat placed on her head and she holds her breath focusing back on her task at hand. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hmm," the sorting hat mutters. "A bit older than usual eh? No matter, I have the perfect house for you...HUFFLEPUFF!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The yellow table stands in a loud chorus of cheers and hollers. Trini flinches when her robe erupts with a flash of yellow linen that lines the border of her robes and her tie. She stands when the hat is removed and walks to the table where a brunette girl with her hair in a ponytail pulls out a chair for her excitedly. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>She sits beside the girl and the girl extends a hand with a broad smile. "Welcome Trini to Hufflepuff! I'm Tommi Oliver, 5th year, and one of the prefects."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Prefect?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tommi nods. "We monitor the halls in shifts and report to the teachers if something is off."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh so a hall monitor," Trini says grimacing remembering how unpleasant the hall monitors were at Angel Grove.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tommi nods cheerfully oblivious to Trini's thoughts. "And now all the prefects are the top in Defense class, ready to fight if necessary."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini raises a brow. "Is that danger still there?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tommi shrugs. "Doubt it, but you-know-who still has followers out there and we have to be cautious. Though with Harry Potter and his friends helping to hunt them down I think we're pretty safe."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini looks down the table at all the people talking animatedly and cheering loudly at every first year placed in their house. She looks back at Tommi who is also smiling and suddenly she doesn't really feel like she belongs here. She doesn't smile and laugh like the rest of the Hufflepuffs. Why did the sorting hat think she belonged here? </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Is everyone in Hufflepuff so...cheerful?" Trini says. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tommi laughs. "Just on sorting day. I mean the common room is a blast but in classes we do work hard and do well."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini nods. "What house was Harry Potter in?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Gryffindor," Tommi says. "But he worked with us all the time. He was friends with Cedric Diggory. He was one of the best Hufflepuffs we ever had."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini notices her sadness and glances around the room for pictures of him. "Did he die in the war?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No," Tommi says solemnly. "He was killed by the Dark Lord during the Triwizard Tournament."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini glances back at the beautiful girl at the Slytherin table. She is still looking at her with that dark look so...intensely that Trini gulps and has to look away. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"W-why is there less people at the Slytherin table?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tommi's cheerfulness fades and she glances at them over her shoulder before leaning over towards Trini. "They were not on the right side of the war," Tommi whispers. "Most of their parents were death eaters so they either joined the Dark Lord in the battle and perished or they ran away like the cowards they are. A few of them actually stayed and fought against their own house but I can count them on my hands."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini glances back at the beautiful girl who has torn her gaze away and is now chatting with the careless Asian boy. "What about those two?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tommi looks at them then snorts. "Zack Taylor is a coward. His dad was a death eater and he was killed in the battle but Zack ran away at the first sign of trouble. And her, well that's Kimberly Hart, one of the few that actually turned against her house and fought with us, but only for a little while. No one knows where she went."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini sighs and sits back trying to take in all the information. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Still, it made them pariahs even in their own house," Tommi says. "Zack is the coward and Kimberly is the traitor. I recommend you steer clear of them if you wanna avoid issues."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini nods and then jumps when a tall boy sits beside her smiling widely. He also has the yellow robes and his smile is almost cheesy. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini wants to roll her eyes. She is definitely not a Hufflepuff. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hiya Trini! Welcome to Hufflepuff," he says. "I am Matt, Hufflepuff Head Boy, 7th year. Do you play Quidditch?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Now they're talking! Trini perks up with a huge grin. Quidditch is her favorite thing in the world. She was the best Keeper in Angel Grove and it was probably the only thing anyone even liked about her. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I was the best Keeper at my old school, do you guys have a team here?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Matt beams. "Four teams, one for each house, and we so happen to need a Keeper. Tommi here is our Seeker."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini didn't think the brunette could get more cheerful. She was wrong.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh my God! Trini you have to come to try outs tomorrow!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hufflepuff hasn't won a single season since Gryffindor got Harry Potter," Matt says. "I would definitely like the best Keeper of Angel Grove Academy on our side."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini grins confidently. "We can beat Gryffindor."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"They still have Ginny Weasley who is very good," Matt says.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"And their new Seeker is almost as good as Harry Potter himself," Tommi says. "Jason Scott. I'm itching to beat him though."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini turns to who she pointed at and sees that it's the boy who had been staring intensely at her before when she was getting sorted. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What about Slytherin and Ravenclaw?" Trini says turning back to Matt. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Matt shrugs. "Ravenclaw was a threat when they had Cho, I think we can beat them. And I don't even know if Slytherin will even have a team with that many people gone or dead."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"But when they did have a team they were always the most aggressive and dirty," Tommi says. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So what do you say Trini?" Matt says. "Help Hufflepuff win the championship this year?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini grins widely and shakes his hand firmly. "What time are tryouts?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>...</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The man is tall and has a face that is so serious. He is bald and wears thick red robes. He has been standing there for a good five minutes watching the 5th year students trickle in and take their seats. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini sits beside Tommi because she's the only person she knows. There a few other Hufflepuffs in the classroom but the class is pretty mixed with people from all the houses. She notices Gryffindor's seeker Jason sitting with that black boy Ravenclaw who isn't playing with trinkets anymore but talking animatedly with Jason. In the corner, almost secluded the beautiful Slytherin Kimberly sits beside Zack who looks like he's half asleep. Even the other Slytherins in the room seemed to completely ignore and isolate the pair. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Finally the professor speaks in a loud, booming voice that makes everyone jump. "Hello..." The Ravenclaw black kid knocks down his cauldron in the process. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The professor stares at him blankly. "What is your name?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The poor boy stammers nervously but finally says, "Billy...Billy Cranston."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Get it together Billy Cranston, wizards are not supposed to live on edge," he says. "10 points from Ravenclaw."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>There's a collective groan from all the Ravenclaws in the room and Trini looks at Tommi questioningly. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tommi takes out her wand and flicks it gently. A small note appears in front of Trini that says, "<em>The houses compete against one another for academics. They get and lose points from different professors throughout the day. Whoever has the most points at the end of the year wins."</em></p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"My name is Professor Zordon," his booming voice makes everyone jump again but this time Jason catches Billy's things before he knocks them all down again. "I am the new head of the Slytherin house and your potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Both of them?" Jason says in surprise. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"The school determined one teacher for both was sufficient for the time being until the school has recovered," Zordon says. "And talk out of turn again and we will have problems! 10 points from Gryffindor."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Jason looks stunned and the other Gryffindors sigh in exasperation. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Now today we will learn to make a healing salve," Zordon says. "Your former potions instructor Professor Snape was creative in his teachings but he neglected to teach you several basics that would be helpful in battle situations. This salve will be able to heal the most vicious muggle inflicted  wounds you can think of." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He pulls out a bottle with a bright blue potion inside and points to Trini. "You, American girl, Angel Grove is highly advanced in potions, do you know how to make this salve?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini gulps and nods. "Yes sir." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Good, come here," he says. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini stands nervously and walks to the front. Zordon lifts the salve and says, "First I want to show you a demonstration of how this salve works."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini gulps. She knows what's coming. She's done this demonstration before. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Zordon takes out his wand and flicks it turning it into a long sword. Trini backs away in fear. Zordon slashes the sword at Trini's abdomen. She cries out and feels instant pain before falling to the floor in agony. Blood is spilling everywhere and the class erupts in chaos. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Sit down, it's just a superficial cut," Zordon says flicking his wand back to normal. "<em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>!" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini feels her body lift off the ground and land in a seated position on the table gently. Trini grits her teeth in pain and sees Kimberly from the corner of her eye looking at her with a worried expression her wand out and ready.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Was she gonna fight Professor Zordon to protect her?</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"American girl, show us the wound please," Zordon says.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It's Trini," she says groaning gently as she opens her robe. Her white shirt is soaked through with blood and her fingers are trembling too much to undo the buttons. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Professor," Kimberly says her British accent almost makes Trini melt. "May I help her please?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Zordon smirks and nods slowly. "Please do Ms. Hart, 10 points to Slytherin." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini sees high fives and small smirks from the other Slytherins as Kimberly walks to the desk and gently undoes the buttons at the bottom of Trini shirt and lifts it to only expose the long gash across Trini's stomach and nothing more. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The girl is being careful not to touch her but the proximity is making Trini's head spin. </p>
</div><div>

  <p>"Now observe the wound," Zordon says opening the potion and pouring the blue liquid onto Trini's stomach. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini cries out at the burning pain and Kimberly grabs her hand. She feels a tingling sensation on her belly and looks down at the wound puckering up and disappearing completely. The pain is gone instantly. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The class erupts in impressed murmurs as Trini buttons up her bloody shirt and gives a thank you nod to Kimberly who smiles and returns to her seat. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Thank you for your help Trini," Zordon says flicking his wand at her. Her shirt and robes immediately clear of the blood and the slash from the sword as if nothing happened. "20 points to Hufflepuff."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The Hufflepuffs clap as she returns to her seat and Tommi gives her a high five. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Now," Zordon flicks his wrist and several rats appear on everyone's tables. "The spell is <em>Laceratus</em>, it will cause a laceration on your rats and you will have exactly 5 minutes to complete your potion and administer it so it won't bleed out. We will practice the potion alone first then try it with the time limits for the rats. Please turn your books to page 340."</p>

  <p>"Trini Gomez," Jason Scott says as they exit the class together hand extended. "Jason Scott, Gryffindor, 5th year. I'm a Quidditch freak and I've heard all about you, badass Keeper from Angel Grove Academy. I was hoping you would be placed Gryffindor so I would get to play with you, but I guess we'll be facing off huh? Will you be at try outs today?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini shakes his hand and offers him a smile. He's intense and a bit too passionate for her taste, but she likes him. "You bet. Can't wait to kick your ass on the field, Scott."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Jason smirks in challenge. "We'll see about that Gomez."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hi," Trini says to Billy who is standing beside Jason nervously. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"This is Billy, also 5th year, Ravenclaw," Jason says. "He's a bit shy, he has to warm up to you to talk to you." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini nods in understanding. "Nice to meet you Billy." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Billy smiles and nods. As they leave Trini spots Kimberly and Zack leaning against a wall talking. "Let's go to the dorms to change for tryouts?" Tommi says beside her. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Uh, I'll meet you there," Trini says. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tommi smiles and waves goodbye before walking away. By the time she reaches Kimberly and Zack most of the students have dispersed. She clears her throat nervously and says, "Hi. I'm Trini."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yeah we know," Zack says. "You've made quite an impression. Volunteered to get slashed by Professor Edward Scissorhands. You got spunk Crazy Girl. I'm Zack." </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini shakes his hand with a smile.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'm Kim," Kimberly says shaking her hand. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The jolt of electricity that runs through her at their touch is as strong as a Cruciatus Curse. Trini releases her hand with a gasp and clears her throat to try to calm herself. "Um, thank you, for helping me back there. It...really hurt."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Kim smiles and Trini tries not to swoon. If she thought the girl was beautiful already, smiling she was like a wrecking ball. "It looked like it. Glad I could help."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Trini smiles nervously and says, "Well I gotta go get ready for Quidditch tryouts, see you around."</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Zack gives her a small nod and Kimberly smiles as Trini waves nervously and walks away.</p>
