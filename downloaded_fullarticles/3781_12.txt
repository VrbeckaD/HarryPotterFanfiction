    <p>In the last days of our torment, I thought the War would never end.</p><p>My exhaustion came from the constant motion I sought to keep up with. Battles, healing the injured, reports to be given all whirled around me. I was weary just watching the chaos.</p><p>But I had to be involved. I knew that as the 'Not Chosen One', I had to keep busy, and support the one born mere hours after I was. Harry didn't rest, so neither did I.</p><p>I rotated between fighting Death Eaters next to my classmates and working in the emergency medi-ward. The whole ordeal was tiring and soul crushing, even without staying up for three days straight. But added to it were the losses that tore at my soul. Dumbledore, Snape, Harry's beloved owl, house elves who were protecting students, and one of the elder Weasleys all fell in the name of all that was good about magic.</p><p>I mourned them all. Even Snape, my tormentor since I was a small first year. How could I not? They gave all they could so the rest of us could live, instead of just survive.</p><p>The worst of it all came as I was treating one of the sixth year students for a burning hex. The news made my heart fall to my feet.</p><p>My favorite teacher was no longer with us. Professor Lupin and his wife had both fallen. They had met their fates in separate places and at separate times. But when the bodies were retrieved, they were brought in on joined stretchers, hand in hand.</p><p>I was in the Great Hall (which now doubled as the medi-ward) when they were reverently laid with the rest of those the Death Eaters had stopped. Although I had heard of their deaths hours before, seeing them there had me so crestfallen that I had to go over to them to pay my respects.</p><p>Tears filled my eyes as I gazed on the serene face of the man who had helped push me down the path to confidence and resolve. His first lesson to us as third years had showed me that the strengths I had dreamed about were not just in my imagination. I wasn't the clumsy, laughable bane of Gryffindor House. I had skills that could serve me and my friends. They simply needed a reason, and sometimes a guiding hand, to come out.</p><p>Professor Lupin had helped me while still riddled with his own weaknesses. According to the reports from the rumor mill, he had given me my self esteem boost while fighting his own demons of depression and prejudice.</p><p>I silently vowed that because the professor had joined Merlin's domain, his demons would be laid to rest. I would personally make sure he was remembered for his strengths. As I bent down to adjust his jacket in that secluded corner of the Great Hall, an open window at the corner streamed a ray of moonlight onto the floor nearby. It beckoned to me.</p><p>I looked out the window to see that the moon was full that night. As I stared at that silver orb, I gave thanks that my teacher would no longer suffer from the werewolf curse. Death would at least award him the cessation of that pain.</p><p>It was when I was thinking this when I heard the cracks and snaps coming from the floor in front of me. Ironically, my preoccupation with the moon kept me from looking down at whatever was making the noise.</p><p>When my eyes finally shifted, I gasped in surprise. For next to the still body of Nymphadora Tonks was a large wolf. It was staring at me with sad amber eyes. That could mean only one thing. Amazingly, Professor Lupin had somehow survived without anyone knowing.</p><p>Although the news made me ecstatic, the sight of the wolf made me recoil a little. I suddenly remembered that the professor had tried to attack Harry after his transformation on the night that Sirius Black came back to Hogwarts.</p><p>But the wolf did not attack me. Instead, he let out a small whimper as his head rested on his massive paws. As I stared at him in shock, his eyes appeared to beg for my help.</p>
