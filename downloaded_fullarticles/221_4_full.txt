      <p>This isn't my typical story. Omegaverse isn't something I particularly love, but this fic was requested, so here it is, and I must say I found myself so invested in writing this I just couldn't stop. </p><p>Snarry is my OTP, I've read countless of fic, but this is the first Snarry I write (finished and posted, I mean), mostly because I've always been scared of the characterization (I hate OOC and I would hate if my characters went too much that way) but also because English is not my first language and I wasn't sure I could grasp Snape's linguistic characterization. I still feel this way, but I just thought, whatever I'm gonna do it nonetheless, you only live once.<br/>So, know I'm the first to be filled with doubt about this.</p><p>Another thing before you start: I have this headcanon that Snape is someone who swears, but since he's surrounded by children and he's not allowed, he convolutes his sentences to actually insult people in smart ways. Which means in private he could sometimes swear.</p>

    <p align="justify">
  <em>… But first of all, we should ask ourself what an Omega is. The rarity of such a phenomenon - statistics show no more than an Omega per century is presented - shrouds these figures in legend, so the answer is still not clear and heatedly debated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>The Omega Care Associations presume Omegas are undeveloped wizards, whose raw magic potential has affected the evolution of sexual characters still in the maternal uterus. They are considered to be dangerous, because of their great level of magical power and its being influenced by their hormonal variations. Of course whether Omegas aren’t really capable of controlling their vast power is speculation, because as soon as they present, they are taken under the responsibility of the Omega Care Association and assigned to an Alpha (according to the O. C. A.'s definition, wizards who had mastered a superior control over as much magical power as the Omegas, leading them to develop an advanced secondary sex whose characteristics makes them able to control Omegas and their bursts of powers). The criteria of such assignations aren’t disclosed to the public and any attempt to contact the Association to gather further information has been turned down. Which makes us wonder if we should believe the O. C. A. has no conflict of interest in considering Omegas subhumans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“No comment” has also been the Omega Care Association answer to our first inquiry about the health and safety of Harry Potter, taken into custody on August, 1st after the Ministry relieved him entering a Heat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Mr. Potter is safe and he’s been taken care of as best as only our Association can do. We are trained to handle these situations and we can assure you the public safety isn’t and won’t be in any danger,” has stated Arwen Warrant, the spokesman of the O. C. A., on August, 10th, refusing to answer any other question.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>The doubt still remains: is this really for the best or is it just a political move to remove Harry Potter from the scene?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>The famous Boy Who Lived had openly clashed with the Govern when, more than two months ago, had claimed You Know Who’s return after the end of the Triwizard Tournament. Minister Fudge has denied proof of such an event, cutting all of this as a publicity stunt…</em>
</p><p align="right">“O. C. A. claims Boy Who Lived - hazards control or political move?”</p><p align="right">Betledum Oarkhet for the “Daily Prophet” (<b>articled rejected</b>)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dumbledore was tired. Years had never been particularly lenient with him - grief and sorrows carving wrinkles on his face - but on that particular occasion, he looked aged about a century.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I understand why you did it, but do you think it was wise?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Wise?” snarled Snape. “Wise, you ask? No, of fucking course it was not wise. Do you even realize its implications?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the most idiotic thing I could have done! Are you really -”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“And yet it was the only thing you could do,” Dumbledore interrupted his tirade. Trust the old man to handle even the worst-case scenario with that calm attitude. “I assure you I perfectly understand every repercussion of this, both on Harry and on you. I was merely inquiring if you had exposed yourself to anyone.”</p><p align="justify">“Lucius was here, but he didn’t realize who I was,” he sneered. “I did it anonymously. I have an appropriate set of clothes for these situations.” And how ironic was it that his robes had been the same hiding ones he had been wearing ages ago at the Hog’s Head while listening to the prophecy that would ruin his life? “My cover isn’t blown, don’t worry. Besides this is so much in character with being a Death Eater that it wouldn’t even be a problem if they recognized me.”</p><p align="justify">“They will kill you if they find out you have the boy and didn’t hand him over to Voldemort. Of course, I’m worried about you.”</p><p align="justify">“I <em>have</em> the boy. Yes.” Snape spatted, relapsing into a self-hatred mumbling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I know it’s not optimal, but it was the lesser evil. Harry’s life is safe.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Yes, the lesser evil. But - Fuck! When I think I can’t sink any lower…”</p><p align="justify">“Severus, my boy, you shouldn’t be so harsh with yourself.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, please, spare me. I’ve <em>bought</em> the boy,” Snape hid his face between his hands. “I’ve bought him like I could have bought a house elf. The damn Boy Who Lived.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore wanted to say something to lessen and mitigate the loathe in his words, but there wasn’t some magic spell that could erase the facts as they were.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">And then, borderline to hysterics, Snape began to laugh, bitter and sarcastic and maniac. “I’ve bought him with the money I don’t have. Albus, I’ve used the money of the loan for the research on the Conscience Potion…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“No, no, now Severus, I’ll help you with that. It’s for Harry’s sake after all. We couldn’t let Malfoy win the auction, could we?”</p><p align="justify">No, they couldn’t. Even if that meant breaking the confidence the Congress of Potioners had put into him, even if that meant ruining his professional reputation of Potion Master, even if that meant that Alice and Frank Paciock and the like of them - tortured senseless by Death Eaters - would never likely regain a little of sanity. He’ll have to false his experiments to make them look like they failed,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he’ll lose it all if he got caught - lying to the Board of the Congress couldn’t be worse than lying to the Dark Lord, but Snape had believed in that project enough to present it to the Congress and it was something with the potential to work, or the Board would have never allocated that much funds to his draft.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">And now it was all gone and it was Potter’s fault.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">No.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">No, damn, not even Snape could blame Potter for this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">No one would have expected Harry Potter to present as an Omega. Maybe an Alpha, infrequent as it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>to actually present, but after all, he was powerful enough for it to not be so weird if he had a second sex - not as weird as it had been for Severus “I can’t believe Snivellus is an Alpha“ Snape at least.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">But Muggleborn and Halfblood were almost never affected by the phenomenon and the Potter hadn’t presented a second sex in… what, almost three centuries? Regulus had loved to mock James Potter endlessly about it. (The last Black Alpha had been his homonymous great-uncle Regulus at the start of the 1910).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Well, now Potter had presented as an Omega, the first in almost a century. Oh, of course, it wasn’t enough for him to be the Boy Who Lived, the Savior of the Wizarding World and so on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">The Omega Care Association had the best day of their lives in taking him “under protection”. As if. More like stripping him of every human right and selling him out to the highest bidder. (They didn’t even have an Omega family with whom dividing the profits, they must have been happy as a clam.)</p><p align="justify">Yes, he could blame Potter for this, for all of this, for presenting, for driving him to enter in a damn auction to win him to the Light Side, for forcing him to buy him with money that he was supposed to use for greater things, for making him save him from a life of childbearing or worse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">He <em>could</em> blame Potter, it would be <em>so</em> easy to blame Potter as he had always done, burying the pain and the guilt under his anger.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">But it wasn’t Potter’s fault Omegas were legalized slaves. It was <em>tradition</em>. Fuck, it was barbarian, selling a person… no, no longer a person, just an Omega, worth only for their womb and the magical power they could pass on to the child they could bear. Just an incubator. Just a <em>thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p align="justify">And the truth was, if Harry Potter was an Omega, even the ever-loyal Lucius Malfoy would have spared a second thought about handing him over to the Dark Lord if he had him. Oh, and Merlin only knew what ritual Voldemort would devise to absorb an Omega raw power. Severus didn’t want to think about it. Or the part he would have in projecting such an appropriated potion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">So, yes, it was the lesser evil that he had been able to enter the auction with so little notice - surely there was Lucius’ hand in an event so hasty held that hardly any Alpha could make it in time. It was just luck that the Pureblood had needed to leave the auction early because he wasn’t feeling well - luck, or a not so legal trick Snape had learned about materializing a potion directly in the victim’s stomach or blood - because otherwise Snape would have never been able to outbid him, stolen money or not.</p><p align="justify">“I suppose you have scented him?” Dumbledore interrupted his train of thoughts.</p><p align="justify">“I had no other option, it was mandatory to damp his pheromones. It’s gonna fade in a day or two, it’s nothing too permanent, even if I would have preferred not to do it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Are you registered at the Ministry?”</p><p align="justify">“No. I used a Confundus on the officer, he forgot to write down my name. If I know how things work at the Ministry by now Harry Potter is property of John Smith. His tracking charm has faded the moment I brought him inside Hogwarts wards.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Very well. It looks like you have everything that can be controlled under control. It goes without saying, he can’t attend his fifth year normally. Had they complied the procedure?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes. The Association snapped his wand. He doesn’t need it, they said. I think I can obtain another one in Knockturn Alley - there isn’t gonna be that shit about the wand choosing the wizard this time, but we can’t go to Ollivander’s for a new one.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“No, it won’t work as well as the other but I suppose it’s better than no wand at all. And he needs one. Dementors attacking him in the plain day could mean only a thing, Voldemort has more allies than we had initially thought.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Yes, and he made them quickly. I didn’t know anything about it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“You must teach Harry, of course. He still has to defeat Voldemort, Tom will never leave him alone, it’s just gonna be a meaningless slaughter if we leave him in the Omega condition approved by the Association. No one else can know Harry’s yours, so I’m sorry, but I can’t lend you some external help for -”</p><p align="justify">“Albus.” Snape interrupted him. “I think I should pass Harry’s ownership to you. I - I don’t think I have the… <em>restraint</em> and the capabilities to take care of him.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Dumbledore smiled sadly. “You know I have a mate. I couldn’t take Harry even if I wanted to. And it wouldn’t be fair to him… being stuck with an old man such as myself.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">It was an open secret who Dumbledore’s mate was. After all, Omegas were so rare that one could easily remember the one who had started a war for his condition. Dumbledore had marked him out of love before he could be taken as a slave, seeing him as an equal. To Albus, he was just a human, but to the rest of the world he was a lower being and for Grindelwald, it wasn’t enough, never enough. It broke Dumbledore’s heart to fight him and defeat him, but there’s only so much respect fear can buy and Gellert didn’t stop when he ran out of it. Changing a society takes more than murder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“I think it would be kinder if you were his mate,” Dumbledore told him.</p><p align="justify">“His -” Snape looked stunned. “His <em>mate</em>? Albus, I’m not planning on marking the damn boy! I just thought it would be temporary. When, and <em>if</em>, he defeats the Dark Lord, then he could decide an appropriate mate -”</p><p align="justify">“You know it doesn’t work like this. Even with Voldemort out of the picture, Harry is still an Omega. Besides, the marking could be crucial to winning this war. It could sever Harry’s connection to Voldemort.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“What are you even talking about?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I have a theory. Right now it’s just a hypothesis but should it be proven true it would mean Harry’s unavoidable death. Unavoidable, that is, only if Alphas mating secretions aren’t enough to sever the connection. I think Basilisk’s venom has proven adequate in the past, so maybe our <em>poison</em> could work too. It's worth a try.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Albus, I -” Snape was speechless. “I don’t think it would be that much kinder to force me upon the boy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Maybe. But you are the only one who can do it. And you feel inclined to do so, it’s in our nature. Of course, you could just let Lucius Malfoy mark him. With Bill Weasley being in Brazil for another year, Augusta Longbottom would be the next more Gryffindor choice but she is almost as old as I am, so maybe Althea Greengrass? I’ve heard she’ll be back in England by the end of the summer and she doesn’t have connections to Voldemort…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“No!” Snape growled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Dumbledore smiled knowingly. “And yet you were ready to give him to me. I wonder if you hadn’t done it exactly because you knew I would have refused.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“What are you insinuating?” Snape’s gaze darkened.</p><p align="justify">“That you two share already an involvement deeper than what a mere scenting could form. Maybe your hormones were already influencing each other before his presentation.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I’m not a child molester!”</p><p align="justify">“I wouldn’t dream of implying such a thing. I was merely saying that maybe you two are closer than you think.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“You are trying to manipulate me into marking him. I won’t do it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Not even to save his life?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“It’s a mere conjecture. Show me proof and I’ll think if raping and binding the boy to me for the rest of his life is a price worth paying.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Dumbledore shook his head. “Not even if Harry asked you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">* * *<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When he entered his quarters, Potter was sleeping in his armchair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape hesitated. What was he supposed to do with him?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">He knew what the Association thought he would and should do, he knew what Dumbledore wanted him to do, but… the boy. What was he supposed to do with Harry Potter the boy, not Harry Potter the Omega?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">He took a moment to look at him, taking in his pale figure slumped against the cushion, his unruly black hair, the quiver of his eyes under his eyelids, the red lips that had brushed against Snape’s wrist when he let him smell his odor to scent him. The blue collar locked around his neck, indicating - as if any Alpha couldn’t smell him from miles - his status of Omega. Snape couldn’t bring himself to look at him just as that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Potter!” He decided harsh was gonna do it. No need to change their relationship. It would be better for the boy to be in the care of someone he despised if he thought Snape still despised him and surely didn’t want any kind of relationship with him - this was no sadistic retorsion Snape would take advantage of, he would make clear this was forced on them both, and they would go on with their life as best as they could.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Potter, wake up!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">The boy opened his eyes slowly, the bright green of Lily’s eyes stabbing him in the chest as they focused on the room. Severus wasn’t psychologically ready to handle this. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“S - Snape?” Harry croaked, his voice still numbed by the sleep. “What’s happening? I -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are we at Hogwarts? Was this just one of professor Dumbledore’s plan? A way to protect me? I thought - I didn’t know what was happening and those people - they were behaving weird, gave me some pamphlets, but I understood half of what was written in them and I don’t even know who they were, thank goodness, you’re here!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape recoiled. That was the scenting talking, not Harry Potter. The boy would have never been so open to him - admitting his ignorance without worrying about Snape’s remarks, being thankful for his presence. No, for how much scared he could be, he would never behave like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape hated himself a little more than he thought it was possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“It wasn’t the Headmaster’s plan. You presented as an Omega, Potter.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Almost taken back from the stern answer, Harry seemed to remember who he was talking to. He had been stupid to expect a little sympathy from the man, even after all that happened to him. He could be a familiar face, but he wasn’t a friendly one, he should have known.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Yes, <em>Sir</em>, <em>they</em> said that to me. It’s just that those words don’t make sense to me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape knew this was the right moment for a snarky remark on how usual it was for him to not know something. “Of course, they wouldn’t. You are Muggle raised after all,” he relented. Maybe he could give the boy a little respite before landing the greater blow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“It is something that occurs predominantly in the Pureblood families. When a wizard or a witch extremely powerful is born, his or her magic affects the development and leads them to present a second sex. They are still primarily man or female, but they can also be Alpha or Omega. You presented as the latter.”</p><p align="justify">“And what does this have to do with what happened?”<br/> <br/> “The presentation of a secondary sex is monitored by the Ministry, they had known the moment you -.”</p><p align="justify">“Like the Trace?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Yes, Potter, like the trace. Now if you are done interrupting me -”</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry, <em>Sir</em>, I’ve just discovered I’m not just male, I didn’t know I wasn’t allowed to have questions.”</p><p align="justify">“Questions goes after I actually explained you something. You are lucky I cannot take points from Gryffindor.”</p><p align="justify">“You can’t?”</p><p align="justify">“No, silly brat, it’s summer, the school’s out.” Snape hadn’t thought till now he wouldn’t be able to take points because of Potter anymore since he was no longer attending the school. This was getting more difficult by the time. “Now, Omegas. We have not even started on the implication of this.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Potter nodded, keeping silent to obtain more information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“When the Ministry registers a Heat - or a Rut in Alpha’s wizards - they report it to the competent organs, the Omega Care Association in your case.”</p><p align="justify">“And Alphas?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape glared at him for the interruption but said nothing, continuing is explantion. “Alphas don’t need a support group. We can join one, but it’s not mandatory. Omegas are… less in control, so the O. C. A. takes care there won’t be any accidents. After the primary care, Omegas are… <em>assigned</em> to an Alpha.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“So this is why I’m at Hogwarts?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Yes, you’ve been put under my protection.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“You’re an Alpha.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Evidently, Potter, or you wouldn’t be here.”</p><p align="justify">Harry took a few minutes to reflect. It was a lot to take in and what if it wasn’t true. The Heat, yes, that he could believe. His body had felt weird, but he had thought that had been just a collateral effect of Dementors’ exposition, something about an adrenaline rush lasting more than usual or… he didn’t know, but something had been off. So ok, he had a Heat and was an Omega, technically not weirder than being told you were a wizard at eleven years old. He needed just a little time to get used to the idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Being under Snape’s control on the other hand was… more difficult to accept. The man hated him. Sure he had saved Harry’s life - or tried to - more than once and Harry by now was pretty sure he wouldn’t do anything that could hurt him, but…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“They took my wand!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Yes.” Snape looked uncomfortable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Why was Snape looking uncomfortable? It wasn’t like him. Harry was about to prompt him to go on, when would they give it back, why did they take it in the first place, but then he realized he had only Snape’s word on what was happening. What if he was lying, what if he wasn’t even the real Snape? What if he was a Death Eater polyjuiced to look like Snape? No, Snape was too clever to be taken out and replaced. But then again Moody was an Auror with decades of experience and yet… <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry forced himself not to panic. “I want to talk to Professor Dumbledore.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“The Headmaster is very busy. I do not think he will have time to spare for your whims.”</p><p align="justify">Harry felt his heart plummet in his stomach. “So basically, I can’t be sure you haven’t really kidnapped me. Or that you actually are professor Snape.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape looked surprised. He <em>was</em> surprised. That was… actually smart thinking. So the boy wasn’t just blind luck, he actually had a little brain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">He could let the boy smell him again, let his nose recognize him - even before the presentation his nose should have taken it in, Dumbledore was right and Snape should have paid more attention to the boy instead of trying to shut him away, he would have noticed the signal and they wouldn’t have been taken all by surprise -, that would put the boy at ease, at least about the use of Polyjuice. But that would mean enforcing his control over him and Snape could still feel Potter’s lips burning on his skin were they touched him unintentionally during their first scenting, so Snape ignored it</p><p align="justify">“Potter, I don’t think you have fully grasped the situation. It sure was my fault for trying to sugarcoat the situation, so let me be clear. I haven’t kidnapped you. I’ve bought you in an auction.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“You’re kidding me, right?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I wish I were. I assure you I had no more interest than you in this, but the alternative was Lucius Malfoy. So here we are.”</p><p align="justify">“You can’t have <em>bought</em> me. I’m not for sale!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“No, not now at least. Now you are <em>mine</em>” Snape growled and Potter looked subdued. Perfect, really perfect. What had it been, half an hour? And here Snape was already exerting his Alpha’s control over the boy. Regaining a little composure, Snape went on, “and you were for sale, before. The second you started your first Heat you were no longer a person in the eyes of the English law. You have been taken into the custody, your wand has been snapped, you have become an object.”</p><p align="justify">“I - I -”</p><p align="justify">Potter was opening and closing his mouth hopelessly. It was a concept too big to wrap his mind around it, something so unthinkable that his brain refused to, the words he heard had a sense separately, but as a sentence, they simply didn’t make sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I don’t intend to take you up to your role. Nor to take you, full stop,” thought the idea looked excellent to his Alpha’s hormones. Snape forced himself to keep it professional and detached.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“T - take me?” Harry’s eyes widened.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“This is all about sex, Potter, Alphas are supposed to control Omegas through intercourse. It becomes painful for Omegas to have Heats without… without an Alpha taking care of their needs. Too many Heats alone and an Omega could lose his sanity.” Fantastic, he was discussing sex - about having sex - with one of his underage students. He could see the look of horror on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“As I just said, I don’t intend to… take you. I can brew you Heat inhibitors and there are other ways to dampen the symptoms between the potions, temporary ways that require less contact.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Contact?”</p><p align="justify">“A minimum is… required.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Like what? A handjob?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry had the decency to blush, Snape looked at him shocked.</p><p align="justify">“No,” he answered, but the sudden picture of Harry Potter, sweating under him, their hands wrapped around each others cock, rutting in a bed… no, he couldn’t think about it right now, or his restraint would fall. He had still Potter's smell in his nose from before, that must be it. He licked his lips, his throat suddenly dry.</p><p align="justify">“No,” he repeated, his voice still a little wavering, “I was thinking about something more… chaste. Like a…” Merlin, he couldn’t believe he was gonna propose such a thing, but surely it wasn't worse that what Potter had just said. “Like a hug.” He hated hugs. “Smelling each other is mandatory I’m afraid, the more contact between us the more your symptoms will be taken at bay.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Relieve flooded through Harry, relive and… disappointment? Harry was stunned to find a part of him would have so much liked to… what, have sex with his most hated professor? Harry wasn’t even sure he liked girls after last year debacle with the Yule Ball and now he was getting horny for Snape of all people? His life sucked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Oh, ok. Hugs are… fine, I guess.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">They both looked uncomfortable and a strangled silence fell between them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I -” Snape started. “I’m gonna bring you a new wand. It will not be as efficient as the previous one,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but I guess we can’t be that picky. As soon as you’ll take confidence with it, we’ll resume your education and start a more focused training. The Headmaster thinks the Dementors attack in Little Whining was the Dark Lord bidding, so you’ll need to concentrate on Defense Against the Dark Arts more than ever.”</p><p align="justify">“School starts in two weeks. Will I be able to go back to the Gryffindor tower when school starts? Or - or should I keep close to you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“You can’t go back. You are no longer a student.” Snape didn’t allow himself to feel sorry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I - I - I’m no longer a student?!” And that was the straw that broke the camel’s back, more than being sold, more than his wand being snapped, more than been forced to stay with Snape. Hogwarts was no longer his home. Tears gathered in his eyes, slowly rolling down his cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’ll give you a minute. Your room is the one on the right, just in front of mine,” and with that Snape left him alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p> </p><p align="justify">That night Snape had been away more than a minute, but to be fair, he was finding more and more difficult to hold off his protective side. So he had walked the corridors, following the paths of his usual nocturnal patrols. What would he have given to find a student out of bed at this hours to vent his frustration on them! But the only student in the school was locked in his chambers. Not ideal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">When Snape had come back to his quarters, Harry was already in his room, he could smell him through the closed door. He fought the impulse to check on him, to see if he was feeling better, to make him feel better. Stupid Alpha’s needs.</p><p align="justify">The next morning though wasn’t any better. Potter looked subdued as he ate his porridge and Snape had to force himself to stay on the chair. He wondered how just one simple scenting - an act so little bonding -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>could have already triggered such protectiveness in him.</p><p align="justify">“I’m going to find you a new wand today,” Snape announced.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry’s eyes widened, full of hope. “Can I come?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape snorted. “Yes, Potter, of course. What next, do you want to put posters on the walls of the whole Diagon Alley? The only way I can keep both of us alive is if no one knows where you are and who you <em>belong to</em>.” Damn, it should not have sounded so possessive, he definitely had to work on that. “Which includes your little friends. You are not allowed to contact them.”</p><p align="justify">“My friends - You can’t stop me from writing them!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I can’t?” Snape snapped. “Potter, I hate to be the one to remind you that <em>legally</em> I can do what the fuck I want with you.”</p><p align="justify">It wasn't the best way to put it, but the whole situation was wearing him thin, he was being pulled in so many directions simultaneously… In addition to his role as a double agent - which was difficult and troubling enough even without adding another variable that could jeopardize his life and their probability of victory in the war - he now had to live with Harry Potter. And if that wasn’t bad enough, he still found the boy insufferable, too cocky and arrogant, but at the same time what was happening to Potter was <em>so</em> terrible no one deserved it and Severus wasn’t used to feeling sorry for Potter - he had suppressed and denied that feeling under a wall of anger and if he let himself feel sorry for <em>all</em> that happened to the boy  he would crumble under guilt. But now his smell was still in his nose even if it shouldn’t be possible, which meant Severus <em>needed</em> to feel for him, to protect him and touch him and fuck away  all the pain and make it better and… and remember himself the boy was just fifteen, and under his professional care. This was so much wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape had learned the hard way that self-pitying wasn’t going to help him in any way, but sometimes he still allowed himself five minutes of selfishly asking himself what would happen if he just runned away. They were just moments of weakness, this was his amend, fixing all his mistakes was a life-long task, something that would end only with his death and leaving wasn’t an option. Not when every single thing he did lead to another mistake to correct.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Exactly like he had just done, judging by Harry’s horrified face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry had realized it was true. It sunk in his brain that everything that had happened to him since his birthday wasn’t a very realistic nightmare. He had been kidnapped and locked up in a room for days, drugged with something that suppressed his Heat but also made him dizzy and sleepy. Days had passed in a haze, he didn’t even know how much time he had spent in that room, looking at the ceiling, and then he had been given away, he had been sold. To Snape. Snape who was his “master” - no, no, Harry decided he would never call him that -, Snape who owned him, Snape who could do everything he wanted with him and no one would lift a finger. Snape who hated him…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Potter?” Snape asked, worriedly, placing a hand on his shoulder. Harry hadn’t noticed he had started shaking. He would have thought the man’s touch would have made him jump, considering his train of thoughts, instead he just found himself calming down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I didn’t mean I would <em>actually</em> do something,” Snape added, trying to soothe him, sobered by Harry’s reaction. “But I think you should always remember that your status in this society has changed. What I’m gonna do - giving you a new wand - it’s illegal. You are considered a public menace that I should be guarding constantly. Instead, I’m arming you. Believe me when I tell you I don’t consider you any different from the person you were at the end of the last term just because of your revelation and I will not treat you any differently. You are not a slave.” Snape’s hand left his shoulder. “However for both your and my safety, I’m forced to forbid you to write to your friends, at least until September. By then they’ll be here at Hogwarts and the possibility of your owl being intercepted is less likely. But even then, you can’t write anything about where you are, with whom and what are you doing. Understood?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry didn’t trust his voice to speak, so he just nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">They hate their breakfast silently. The atmosphere was tense, Harry couldn’t wait to be alone again, he felt like he was gonna implode and he just couldn’t do it in front of Snape. To distract himself he started gathering the empty dishes, wondering where was the sink to wash them. Maybe if he kept his hands full…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">The clattering of the spoon falling on the table brought his attention back to Snape.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve told you, you are not a slave. You are not supposed to take care of the dishes.”</p><p align="justify">Harry was taken aback. The men looked angry as if doing a simple house chore as he had always done meant Harry succumbing to his condition.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I wasn’t - That’s just what I would do if I were still at the Dursley’s. It’s not a… <em>slavish</em> attitude, it’s courtesy. I live here now, don’t I?” That leads his thought on another trail. “How - how permanent is my living here? Do I have to back to the Dursley’s next summer?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“No. You are not allowed to not live with your Alpha. I’m afraid you’ll have to stay at Hogwarts.” Snape was almost ready to concede him they could arrange visits when - <em>if</em>, but maybe he wouldn’t add that a little hope was not so bad in this case - the Dark Lord was defeated, when Harry spoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Good. It almost makes up for being enslaved” he weakly joked, tugging at his collar for the umpteenth time. The damn thing was itchy and since they had locked it around his neck he couldn’t stop torturing the blue stripe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape, though, seemed to notice it for the first time. “Is your collar bothering you?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s tight.” Harry shrugged. “Do I really have to wear it?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I’m afraid yes. There’s only a way to remove it and you wouldn’t like it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry didn’t say anything but his interrogative face was enough to make Snape sigh before continuing. “The collar is not a concrete object. It is spelled on you and the only way to break it is if I Mark you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Mark me?”</p><p align="justify">The boy’s ignorance was abysmal, but no one could really blame him. He was an unlikely candidate to present in the first place and if he still had parents that could explain him the Omegas’ lore, he probably wouldn’t have presented at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“It’s a magical procedure,” Snape explained. “If an Alpha bites an Omega in this ritual they get bonded. For life. It’s unbreakable and it’s just another form of the collar you are wearing now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Oh, ok. I guess the collar stays.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Any other question?” Snape inquired.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“No.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Very well. Then come here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“What?” Harry was taken by surprise.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry, Potter, but this needs to be done. I don’t like it more than you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“W- why? What are you going to do?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Do you have to question every single thing I do, you insufferable brat? I’ve told you I’m not gonna -” Snape sighed. “I’m just gonna scent you, I need to feel connected to you as much as possible to chose a wand for you. Now come <em>here,</em>” he ordered while slowing getting to his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Oh,” Harry blushed. Snape’s voice was darker and deeper, almost a dangerous growl, sending shivers down his spine. He obeyed with shaking legs, placing himself in front of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">It was awkward, not knowing what was gonna happen, what he was supposed to do, but still, have some sort of expectation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“It would be easier if you close your eyes” Snape advised him and Harry did, only it was worse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Not being able to see what was happening was even more scaring and thrilling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">His heart fluttered and he almost jumped on the spot when he heard Snape sniffing his neck, the man’s shoulder touching his sternum as he got closer. Without thinking, Harry lowered his head and inhaled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape’s smell filled his nostrils, hitting him like a punch in the stomach, and Harry felt he needed more - more scent, more contact, more heat, more skin, more Snape. It almost freaked him out how much he actually wanted it. But his smell was <em>so</em> good he didn’t have in him to feel worried. A moan escaped trough his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">He heard Snape hold his breath, taken by surprise, before continuing on his neck with even greater zeal. Harry could feel the man’s nose brushing against his throat, his breath on his skin, his lips so close to his flesh it would take movement so imperceptible to make them touch, a movement Harry made without even realizing it.</p><p align="justify">That was all it took, then Snape growled in the slope of his neckline and pushed him against the wall behind them, his tongue darting up and down his neck, licking away sweat and scent, his teeth brushing his skin as he sucked his tender skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry’s hand gripped his nape, pushing him closer, wanting more and more, his hips jerking on their own free will, rubbing his throbbing erection against the other’s leg.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">It was Snape’s turn to moan and that suddenly seemed to throw him off. He pulled away, horrified by himself like he couldn’t believe he had actually taken advantage of his fifteen years old student.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry couldn’t care less about the moral compass of the man right now, so he drew closer and kissed him, full on the lips, tongue licking his mouth open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape responded to the kiss for just a second before pulling away. Harry could see the effort it took him on his face.</p><p align="justify">“This - this is inappropriate” he managed to say, putting some distance between them. “I need to go now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry watched him go, breathless and aching for more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">* * *<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p align="justify">Once he got a new wand Harry felt whole again. He hadn’t understood how much dependent on it he had become in the years. That stick of wood was what defined him as a wizard, being without it was like being thrown back to his ten, still a little boy sleeping in a cupboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">He was again Harry Potter, wizard, Gryffindor - if only in his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">And to be fair, Snape had been true to his word - the man had principles, figures - treating him as he always had, even if a little less harsh. He was almost the same as usual, and living with him wasn’t as weird as he would have expected after their first breakfast together, though it was weird nonetheless. Snape had decided to pretend nothing had happened, but Harry could see he was uncomfortable being near him, hyperaware of where Harry was all the time and particularly set into avoiding any physical contact with him. But his refusal to let physical closeness become something natural and ordinary made the necessary daily scenting even more meaningful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">During the day Harry kept wondering what was happening to him - that was Snape, for fuck’s sake - but as soon as the time of the day came, he could feel the anticipation building up in his whole body. It wasn’t just a momentary effect, something that happened only while he was sniffing him, he was looking forward to those amazing and awkward moments when he actually needed to fill his nostrils with Snape’s perfect smell and Harry just couldn’t get enough and just wanted more - to have more, to touch more, to feel more. He could see Snape wanted more too, but the man had made a point of keeping it chaste after their first exploit, getting away as soon as he deemed the scenting done. It turned out it took too little time - for Harry’s taste - for Snape’s smell to stimulate his glands to excrete a particular type of pheromones that told his brain he was taken and stimulated the Alpha’s glands to do the same when inhaled, in a vicious circle of positive feedback that was meant to lessen his burst of magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Not that such burst of involuntary magic had been that frequent. Actually, except for an exploded window, while he was still at the O. C. A. base, he hadn’t had them. But then again, he had been scented almost immediately after that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Maybe he wasn’t just powerful enough to perform wandless magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Which made him very grateful to have a new wand, even it wasn’t as good as his previous one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">He had regained the use of the simplest spells in the first day - every movement he learned on his holly wand were just a little off-balance on this oak one - and by the end of the week, he was ready to start learning new ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Since he couldn’t attend Hogwarts anymore, his classes had been taken by Snape. The man had refused to even allow him near a Divination Book and Harry had never been happier, though he would have thought Snape would have appreciated his effort of inventing a new deadly incident every week - “I’ve spent too many years of my life trying to save yours to find this amusing,” had been Snape’s reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">The rest of his classes had remained more or less unchanged - except for Herbology since he couldn’t visit the greenhouses anymore, and Astronomy for the same reason, that would remain only as theoretical.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">The news was a particular branch of Defense Against the Dark Arts he was now bound to follow almost as frequently as the same Defense: Occlumency.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry kind of understand why he needed that - he still remembered Voldemort from his vision and that was something he didn’t want to see anymore -, he just didn’t understand what was so urgent or important about him mastering that art.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Tomorrow is September, 1st,” Snape told him, “I won’t be here, my presence is requested at the Feast. I need to be sure you won’t roam the corridors in hope to see your friends. Some of the students are Alphas, they would smell you from milesn away and know who has scented you. I need to know you will stay here, not even thinking about them. So now clear your mind, we’ll start the practice.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">As Harry tried to follow the instruction, meditating to empty his brain from every thought, Snape removed silver threads from his head with the point of his wand and deposited them in a basin, before turning to face him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry raised his wand, ready to counteract Snape’s spell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“<em>Legilimens</em>!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">* * * </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">“A lemon sherbert?” Dumbledore offered to Snape as soon as the man sat on the chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“No, thank you. I’ve come to discuss an important matter.”</p><p align="justify">“Did something happened with Harry?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“No,” Snape waved. Their daily talk about the boy could wait - after all, everything was just the same, his continuous request to see the Headmaster that regularly got denied, his studying, his nonexisting progress in Occlumency, the scenting, the lust. He wasn’t there to discuss all this, again. “I’ve been invited to Malfoy’s Manor for a party.”</p><p align="justify">That caught the old man attention. “Voldemort?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I think it’s another kind of trap. I floo-ed some acquaintances. He invited every Alpha. He wants to smell who has Potter. Whether it is for the Dark Lord or himself, I don’t know. The Dark Lord has been oddly quiet lately, I had expected a summon after the announcement of Potter’s status. I doubt he has given up the idea of killing him just because he’s an Omega.”</p><p align="justify">“The Prophecy says as much. Lucius Malfoy could be a vanguard. Severus, you can’t go.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I can’t not go. I have no suitable excuse not to go, I’m not in another country, not too old to attend. Unless I’ve got Potter. Not going would equal to admit it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“But going will make them know. They can wonder, but if they smell the boy on you…”</p><p align="justify">If anyone smelled the boy on him he was dead. And it would take little for Harry to follow. Then the whole war was lost. But if he didn’t go…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Not if I take a smell altering potion.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Dumbledore didn’t look convinced. “Are you sure it will work? Your life depends on it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I was able to deceit the Dark Lord for half my life, I’m sure I can handle Lucius. He will know my smell is different but he won’t be sure why. I’ll blame it on having intercourse with someone else. He doesn’t have any reason to suspect me. He knows I’m loyal to the Dark Lord and I would have handed him Potter, if I had him.” It was a gamble, but he had to make it, they both knew it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Just be careful, my boy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Yes, as if he could. Sometimes Snape felt like a juggler with too many balls in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">* * *<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p align="justify">Lucius Malfoy’s party were always the most pompous and lavish, so this one was no exception.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Alphas weren’t the only ones invited, and the Manor was overfilled with people.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">He saw Narcissa entertaining the American Ambassador from Macusa, while Lucius was deep in conversation with none other than Cornelius Fudge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Taking a flute of wine from a tray magically floating through the room, Snape prepared himself to meet the host and be subjected to a scrupulous examination. He hoped he still knew Lucius well enough to fool him. Talking in detail about whatever brunette he would pretend he had fucked to alter so much his smell should distract him enough to actually wonder why Snape was the only Alpha there with a different scent - or, if that fail, to make him think Snape wasn’t stupid enough to enter the lion’s den, so of course he would have had sex with someone else.</p><p align="justify">It was a good enough plan. After all, Lucius was smart, but not so smart, or he wouldn’t have given the Dark Lord’s diary to Ginevra Weasley so easily. It had cost him a whole session of Cruciatus Curse when the Dark Lord had been back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Ah, I wouldn’t drink that if I were you, the white wine is horrible tonight,” a feminine voice said behind you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I wouldn’t let Lucius hear me if I were you. It’s very probable he has spent a lot on this,” he replied, putting the half drank glass back on the tray and turning to face Althea Greengrass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“It’s not probable, it’s sure,” she laughed. “It’s good to see you again, Severus. Would you be so kind as to dance with me?”</p><p align="justify">Snape was not here for small talk, he had to talk to Malfoy soon or that would be suspicious, but he was also supposed to be here to enjoy himself and it would be discourteous to refuse, so he just lend his arm to the woman and escorted her to the dance floor as the singer started singing a new song.</p><p align="justify">Bowing politely at his partner as the etiquette required, Severus took Althea’s hand to commence the dance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“It seems to me that the singer had at least retained magic in his voice, even if he’s a Squib.” He started. Casual conversation was expected - after all dancing was just an excuse to socialize.</p><p align="justify">Althea ignored him, her cheerfulness altogether replaced by seriousness. “Severus, you need to go.”</p><p align="justify">“I did not think courtesy had evolved in such a path in the years I’ve locked myself in the Slytherin Dungeons” Snape tried to bought time to think about a believable excuse to tell her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“You <em>reek</em> of him.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Him?”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t play dumb with me, Severus. The Omega.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I most certainly do not… <em>reek of him</em>, as you put it. I don’t have him”</p><p align="justify">“I know you well enough to know this isn’t your smell, even if I can’t tell if its the boy’s or not. Lucius will understand as soon as he gets close to you. You need to go. I’ll excuse you, saying you weren’t feeling well - the wine was absolutely horrible after all -, and I’ll tell him your smell was perfectly normal.”</p><p align="justify">Damn her! She had always been smart, but age had sharpened her wits. Severus had counted on other Alphas not being interested in his smell. Lucius wouldn’t be so perceptive, but if she talked to him…</p><p align="justify">“I assure you it’s not necessary, but I assume it’s not a favor you would grant me out of kindness, Althea. Why would you do such a thing?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">The woman put some distance between them, following the dance steps, just to whisper in his ear as she got close again. “Because I need a favor. A big one.”</p><p align="justify">Snape looked at her wearily. “A favor?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“My daughter is showing the signs. She will present.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Congratulation. Another powerful wizard in your family, and without skipping a generation. This must be a new Alpha record. Daphne or Astoria?” He let her pirouette, before taking her back in his arms.</p><p align="justify">“Astoria. She’s not presenting as an Alpha.”</p><p align="justify">“Of course, and you want me to prepare the Locking Potion.” Ah, the reason for so little Omegas presenting. It wasn’t just intrinsic in the race - as many thought - no, Omegas weren’t less because they were aberrations. Omegas were less because… Well, parents who loved their children usually tended to not look at the idea of them being enslaved and sold with fondness. It was much better to magically castrate them before they could present, confining them to be just Betas - as were called the wizard without a second sex - with a particularly developed nose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I’ll keep your secret if you keep mine” whispered Althea. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“I will owl you when I have the potion. But make sure you are particularly convincing when you tell Lucius I don’t have the boy,” he consented, confirming what she already knew without compromising himself too much, it was a risk, but not worse than trying to fool Lucius after alienating Althea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“After all, it’s the truth.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Althea smiled, knowingly, but said nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">As the music faded, they separated and bowed to each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Then we have a deal.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">* * *<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="left"> </p><p align="justify">Like Eve in the Garden of Eden, the temptation was hard to resist. The Pensive was there, closed behind the glass doors of the cabinet, the silver glimmer catching his eyes every now and then.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry had forbidden himself to think about it, but he was lonely and after hearing the chattering of Slytherin students coming and going from the dungeons through the door all day, the thought of finding out what the silver sparkle hid was the only thing that had kept him from taking his father cloak and going to find his friends. He knew they were there, he could picture them in the Gryffindor Tower, wondering where Harry was and how he was doing, worrying themselves sick over him. Or maybe not. Maybe they were just thinking about what good riddance this whole situation was. After all, it wasn’t like they had written him lots of letter during the summer even when they could. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">It was an exaggeration, of course, Harry could admit he was feeling a little depressed - no friends, no class, no normality, only Snape. And Snape had resumed his job as Potion Teacher, so Harry was just there, trying to study, alone and bored and a little blue. A lot blue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">The Pensive was just there, enough to trigger his Gryffindor impulse, and he knew Snape was gone to a party, so he would be away for more than the two hours that his lessons took, too busy socializing with other Slytherin or Death Eaters or Alphas. Whatever. Harry didn’t give a shit with whom Snape preferred spending his time - and if he did it sure was his hormones’ fault.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">So what if he was curious? The man didn’t care about invading Harry’s privacy during Occlumency, after all. And besides Harry was sure Snape was just trying to avoid embarrassment. There couldn’t be anything else, right?</p><p align="justify"><em>Voldemort</em>, a tiny voice in his mind reminded him, but Harry had gotten very good at ignoring it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">It took a lot of effort to open the cabinet and sheer luck. At the end it was just a very helpful burst of involuntary magic, sparked by the building frustration of not being able to open the damn thing - Snape was really good with wards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Well, this was the last chance for second thoughts. Harry could still back off, pretend that opening the cabinet had just been an accident and forget about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">But Harry wanted to know what the hell was so important that Snape wanted to keep it away from him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">So he dived in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">… A boy, six or seven years old and a woman, crying, hiding her face in her hands. “Mommy, mommy, are you all right?” the little boy was screaming, tugging at her sleeve, then she removed her hands, revealing a bruise on her cheek. ”I’m fine, Severus, you know how your father gets when he’s angry, but it’s gonna be all right” …</p><p align="justify">… The same boy, ten years old, and a girl, same age, red hair, “It <em>is</em> real, isn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts. It <em>is</em> real, isn’t it?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s real for us. Not for her.”…</p><p align="justify">…Snape at fourteen, writhing on the floor, moaning, a man standing over him, “Congratulation, Mr. Snape, you are an Alpha, it’s extremely rare for a wizard that doesn’t come from Pureblood families”...</p><p align="justify">…Harry’s father, Harry’s father being a bully, Snape floating in the air, “I don’t need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!’…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">… “I’m sorry, Lily, I didn’t mean it!” “Oh, I think you meant it, go away Severus, you have new friends now, you don’t need a filthy Mudblood like me!”…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">… A Death Eater meeting, Snape exposing his forearm, a wand pressed against his skin and the Dark Mark getting impressed in his flesh…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">… Dumbledore sitting in a tavern with Professor Trelawney, a prophecy - Harry felt his blood froze in his veins - a prophecy about him and Voldemort, and a man dressed in black, his face in the dark, completely anonymous, but… the clothes, the same damn black tunics of the man that bought him. The man hearing the prophecy was Snape…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">...Pain, Snape wriggling mid air, Voldemort mocking him angrily, "<em>Crucio</em>!"...</p><p align="justify">… Snape and Dumbledore<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?”</p><p align="justify">“Everything - everything I heard! That is why - it is for that reason - he thinks it means Lily Evans!”</p><p align="justify">“The prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July —”</p><p align="justify">“You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down - kill them all -”</p><p align="justify">“If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?”</p><p align="justify">“I have - I have asked him -”</p><p align="justify">“You disgust me.”…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">…Snape torturing,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Snape spying, Snape killing, Snape crying, Snape, Snape, Snape…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Harry felt headlight, his vision dizzy from tears, he was angry, he didn’t want to see anything else, but the memories kept flowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">… Snape hiding his face in his hands “Fuck! When I think I can’t sink any lower…” and Dumbledore “Severus, my boy, you shouldn’t be so harsh with yourself.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, please, spare me. I’ve <em>bought</em> the boy, I’ve bought him like I could have bought a house elf. The damn Boy Who Lived.” Then Snape laughing, hysterically “I’ve bought him with money I don’t have. Albus, I’ve used the money of the loan for the research on the Conscience Potion…”…</p><p align="justify">…Dumbledore again “But, Severus, the bond between an Alpha and an Omega is much more than that twisted power play the Association wants you to believe. The mark is a symbol of love, of trust, of codependency. An Alpha doesn’t mark to dominate, he marks to protect and gets marked in turn - even if it’s not as showy or advertised. It’s mutual. It’s like a wedding band, not shackles.”</p><p align="justify">“Albus, for the last time, I’m not gonna mark the boy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“You hate him that much? Even after all this time?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Never. You know I’ve never <em>hated</em> him. Resent him, yes, but hate, never. He’s Lily’s child.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Only that?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“Albus…” his voice pleading…</p><p align="justify">Harry kept shifting through memories, pain and grief and sorrows - was it is or Snape’s?</p><p align="justify">… “So?” Why was Dumbledore always there, why Dumbledore knew and didn’t say anything, why he let Snape buy him, why why why?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“He doesn’t progress and if he’s linked to the Dark Lord…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">“He could implant new thought in him.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, he could become the Dark Lord’s puppet, doing his bidding with his incredible magic. I have not saved him for this.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s almost like you care for the boy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Snape stern face “What if I do?”…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify">Yes, what if he did? Who gave a fuck if he cared!</p><p align="justify">And as he thought so, Harry was thrown out of the Pensive, landing on the cool floor of Snape’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- theirs - chambers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>
