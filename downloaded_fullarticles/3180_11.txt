          <div class="userstuff"><p>He couldn't quite see what exactly it was that she was holding in his hands, but he was certain that he had spotted her coming out of the Slytherin Common Room. What he was struggling to wrap his mind around was how exactly she had gotten into the room in the first place. It was password protected for Merlin's sake and there was no way a Gryffindor would have been able to figure it out.</p><p>Draco watched her for a few more moments before deciding he needed to say something to her. He needed to know what she had found and why she had been lurking around in the Slytherin Common Room. Although, if he was being honest with himself, all he really cared about was who or what let her in and how long she had been there.</p><p>"Look what we have here," he hummed as he approached her. "The Weaselette alone in the dungeons. Where's your big, brave brother or the Chosen One to protect you?"</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over her chest, carefully tucking her prize into the crook of her arm. "I don't need protection, Malfoy. No one's going to hurt me down here. In fact, none of you even realized I was here until I was on my way out."</p><p>Draco looked at her for a moment, stunned at the amount of attitude he was getting from her. He had barely spoken to Ginny before now, and any time he even utter a syllable in her general direction Potter or the Weasel would jump in and cut off whatever it was he was about to say.</p><p>"How did you get into the common room? Even if you knew the password, the spell still shouldn't have worked," he asked, carding a hand through his hair as he leaned back against the wall.</p><p>"It called to me," she replied, pushing past him as she made her way to the door shaking her head as she went.</p><p>"What did?" Draco asked, furrowing his brow as he turned to follow her, but remained frozen in place.</p><p>"The diary," she replied, shrugging her shoulders as she lifted the book above her head before leaving the dungeons.</p><p>Draco watched as she walked away. He had heard rumors of a diary, but he had no idea it actually existed. Now it was in the hands of a Gryffindorâ€¦</p><p>All he could do for now was wait and see what happened. Maybe she was meant to find the diary and there was more to the youngest Weasley than what met the eye. Whatever the case may be, Draco planned to watch it all play out.</p></div>
