    <p>
  <span>It had been nearly two years since we had gotten Sirius away from the school because we weren’t able to get him free and well I really wasn’t doing too well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I had realized that I had fallen in love with my god-father and it was something that always made me feel ill because nobody knew about this, mostly because I was worried about what people would think about me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I knew that he would never see me the way that I wanted because well I was everything that he should have been when he was in school and well I was only 16 now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I knew that I should tell him the truth because it wasn’t going to do me any good to hide it, but I haven’t because I did not want to be disowned or for him to think any less of me because my brother was one person that I needed to think about. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>You see when we started Hogwarts my brother and I came from an abusive family, our aunt and uncle did not like us at all because we were the two that was forced on them, they were always telling me and my brother that we were freaks and that we weren’t anything special to anyone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So when we finally were able to come to Hogwarts, my brother got into Gryffindor and well I was put into Slytherin because as much as people didn’t want to mention it I was the crueller and mean of the two of us.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I knew that Snape who was our head of the house was not happy about as I was the daughter of the person that made his life hell and well he did show his hatred for us really easier, my brother more than I being that I was a part of his house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I walked into the great hall and noticed nearly everyone was already sat down ready for dinner, I went to walk over to my table and stopped as I knew that I would just have Draco and Daphne asking me what was wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that my brother walked over to me and smiled as he put his hand on my shoulder, “do you want to sit with us today as you seem worried and lost about something” he said to me and I smiled as I looked to him, “sure little brother, I would love to come and sit with you” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry and I walked over to the Gryffindor table and smiled as I saw Ron and Hermione who was once again bickering about something which always did make me laugh. I coughed as Ron turned to me, “hey Pandora, nice to see you again” Ron said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Ron all okay with you?” I asked and noticed that he was still looking at Hermione to answer me, I laughed as I noticed that she looked like she didn’t have a clue that Ron liked her at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sat down on the bench and smirked as I poked his shoulder with the fork I had in my hand, “have you told her yet” I asked and he laughed, “no I haven’t told her” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to get the courage to ask her,” he said making me roll my eyes, “Men always finding something to stop them from doing what is needed!” I said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked as Ginny and Hermione both laughed as they looked to me and nodded, “of course they do” Hermione said and smirked, “I mean you are aware that men don’t do anything easy right” Hermione said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed as Ginny nodded turning her attention over to me, “plus you know that it takes a woman to get them to do the right thing anyway so at the moment they are stuck in that circle” Ginny said making me smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I thought to the woman that Sirius would be with now and in the future and couldn’t help the sigh, I looked down not really wanting to eat anything as I felt sick thinking about someone else having the happiness that I wanted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that I was being looked at and turned my attention to Harry and smiled as he was looking at me with worry in his eyes and I knew that he really was worried I was becoming who I used to be. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as he took my hand making me look at him, “Pandora please tell me what is wrong with you because I know that something has been eating at you the past few weeks” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“don’t worry about me Harry, I am fine and I promise that it isn’t anything bad,” I said and he laughed as he looked to me, “Pandora you have been upset and quiet for weeks and to be honest you are starting to worry me because this isn't like the person you are now,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I looked to him, “don’t worry so much about me, I am going to speak to Remus over the break and I am sure that he can help me with the little problem that I have” I said and I noticed that he now did look worried about me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed as he looked over to me with some cake on his fork, “you’re not going to do anything stupid are you Pandora” he said and I smirked as he looked to me, “I don’t think that I could lose you” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“is this over a guy Pandora, has someone made you feel bad because you know I will make them hurt” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I grinned as this was the side of harry that most people thought was weird, I shook my head as I looked to him, “no brother, this is nothing to do about a guy” I lied and looked to him, “plus I believe that stupid is your job brother as I am not like that anymore” I said to him making the others laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked back down to my plate and sighed as I would admit that I was worried as Harry wasn’t far off finding out about my little issue that I had and well I was worried as to what he would think as well, being that Sirius is our godfather as well as Remus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as Hermione looked to me and smirked as she knew what my problem was, I looked to her and frowned as there was no way she would be aware of my problems as well we wasn’t really the best of friends.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione smiled as he grabbed my hand, “Pandora please can you come with me” Hermione said and I looked to her, “no sorry but I won’t be coming with you Hermione because I don’t want to listen to another lecture on listening in class” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is nothing to do with that Pandora as I know that you are doing well being that you have been in the library the past few nights,” she said making me look to her, “haha,” I said and smirked as Harry looked to me, “you have been in the library” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“yeah well I do need to pass these owls you know so we can get out of that horrible house” I said to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione grabbed my attention again as she was waving her hand in front of my face, “yes Hermione” I said to her and she smirked, “I would like to speak to you about something that I think you can help you with” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mione I really am not in the mood to speak to anyone” I said to her and she smiled, “humour me, Potter” she said and sighed, “I believe that you need to speak to someone as you’re going to blow up on someone and well I don’t think that it would be good to do that on your aunt and uncle” she explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I looked to her, “fine I will come with you but that doesn’t mean that I am going to speak to you and I wouldn’t blow on my aunt and uncle, I know what happens if I do” I said and got up walking out of the great hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione followed me out of the great hall and I smiled as I noticed that Draco walked around the corner and smiled, “Hey Dora, I was wondering where you were” Dray said to me and I smiled as he looked to me, “you okay?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as this was a side to Draco that Hermione and the other Gryffindor’s didn’t get to see as it was something that was hidden due to us being in Slytherin and them believing we were mean all the time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him and nodded, “yeah I’m alright Dray” I said as I looked to Hermione and smirked, “I am just going for a walk with Hermione as you know what she is like when she wants to speak to me about something” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“and being the good sister that I am to my brother, I said that I would be nice to my brother’s friends” I explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco laughed as he looked to me, “well don’t be too long because we have potions next and well Snape seems to be in a worse mood than normal for some reason” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I looked to him, “when isn't he in a bad mood Dray, I swear he just hates everyone now” I said and smirked, “he used to be nice to the first years but now he is just mean all the time” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“plus don’t worry so much about me Dray, I won’t be late for potions because I know what will happen if I am late for class” I said to him and he smiled as he walked past us both and went towards the great hall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>We walked outside and I noticed that Hermione turned to me and smiled, “it is nice to see that Draco can be a nice human being to someone other than himself” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked as I looked to her, “do remember that us snakes have to stick together and well people don’t think that Draco can be nice being that his parents were on the dark side for the war last time” I explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I watched as she nodded and looked to me, “so this person that you are pouting over and pretending doesn’t exist” she said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed as I looked to her, “I don’t like anyone” I said to quickly and she laughed as she crossed her arms, “come on, who is he” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“how in the hell did you know it was a guy I was worried over Hermione” I asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I wanted to know because I needed to know if this was noticeable for other people more so my brother as I didn’t need him worrying about me more than normal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione laughed as she looked to me, “I know because you are still a girl Pandora and I know when someone is pining over someone that they think they shouldn’t have or think that they cant” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am not pining over anyone Hermione” I said to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione sighed as she looked to me, “come on you know that you are and you know that you want to speak to someone about it” she said, I sighed as I looked to her, “I haven’t said anything to anyone over this Hermione because of my feelings” I explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know what you are going through Pandora” she said and I looked to her, “how, you don’t seem to be having this problem with anyone” I said to her and she smiled, “because I am also a girl and can see your really worried over this” she said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as she smiled, “which means that you really must love this person for you to be panicking like you are” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her and she smiled, “you think that your family won’t accept this person either, otherwise you would have gone for it with that Potter charm you and your brother seem to have when it comes to getting what you want” she said making me laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I frowned as I knew that this was something I didn’t want to admit but I knew I needed to, so i looked to her and nodded, “okay your right there is someone” I said and watched as she smirked at me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am worried about what people will think because this is someone that I shouldn’t have fell for being that we are the completely different side to each other” I explained as I looked up, “if I tell you who this is please don’t think any different of me because I am already having issues over this as it is” I asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would never think any different of you Pandora, I do think that we are friends” she said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her, “of course we are friends Hermione, you and Ron are the only gyffindorks that I want to get along with willingly, the others are just asking to be hexed” I said to her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to me and shook her head, “well you know I don’t agree with that” she said to me and smirked, “so is it Draco who you have fallen for” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that she looked to me with lust in her eyes and I couldn’t help the smirk to come to my face, “because Dora I will admit that he is hot!” she said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed as I shook my head, “no it isn't Draco, Hermione” I said and smirked, “but I will let him know that you think he is hot” I said grinning as she turned red as she looked to me, “please don’t I don’t think I would be able to be in the same room as him otherwise” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed as I looked to her, “I think that he wishes I liked him like that, but no it isn't him that has got me like this” I said to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I watched as Hermione smirked as she was looking to me, “someone older?” she asked and I nodded as I put my hands over my face trying to hide the red that was now covering me which would have made her laugh being that I am normally one to hide it well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“yeah and he wouldn’t want me because I am in Slytherin and destined to be a dark or horrible witch” I growled and she sighed, “just because you have been put into Slytherin doesn’t mean that you are going to be a dark witch Pandora and whoever said that to you, needs to be hit and told they are wrong” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think that a Gryffindor is going to see it that way” I said to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Knowing that I had just given it away Hermione looked to me and smirked, “so he is someone who was in our house then” she said and grinned, “which leaves it to be either Remus or Sirius” she said and I moaned as I was giving this away too much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione grinned and looked to me, “is it Sirius that you have fallen for” she asked and I looked to her as I wiped my eyes, “I am the worse person in the world Hermione” I said and looked to her, “I fell in love with my god-father and there is nothing I can do about it” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her and shook my hands at her, “I mean that I can’t even look at him without feeling horrible about it because I know that I shouldn’t be feeling this for him” I said to her and had to admit that I was nice to finally speak to someone about this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to me and smiled, “Pandora have you tried speaking to him about it, he might surprise you with his answers” she said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her and couldn’t help the snort to come from me, “you are joking right” I asked and she smiled, “no Pandora I’m not” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her and sighed, “no Hermione I haven’t spoken to him about this and I am not going to either” I said and noticed that she looked confused, “but why, he is your family and I am sure that he wouldn’t do anything horrible when you explain these things to him” she said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I looked to her, “Hermione I don’t want to be disowned by them because of this, Harry and I don’t have a lot of family and I don’t want to be the reason we aren’t thrown to the ground again” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked to me and sighed, “Dora” she started and I looked to her, “no I am going to speak to Remus in the Christmas break to see if there is any spell that can remove this from me” I said to her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to me with shock on her face, “Pandora I don’t think that is a good idea” she said and I smirked as I looked to her, “why would that be mione” I asked and she sighed as she looked to me, “because this is a bad idea Pandora, this could rip bits of your sole from you” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I shrugged and looked to her, “well then I will become the bitch that everyone things I am” I snapped as I looked to her, “its what I am going to do because then I will finally be able to live a happy life with Sirius knowing that he is my parental figure and not my other half which is something that I want” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione wrapped her arms around me as she pulled me into her arms for a hug and looked to me, “Pandora I am asking that you please speak to him before you do anything drastic” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her, “well I can’t Hermione, what am I going to tell him ‘Sirius I love you and want you to do naughty things to me” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pandora what happens if you do this and it is something that you regret” she said and I sighed as I looked to her, “I don’t want to be hurt watching him move on with someone else Hermione, so I am going to make sure that Sirius doesn’t find out” I said to her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to me and sighed, “that is a horrible way to live pretending that nothing was there Pandora, you will be ripping half of your soul out of you and god know what will happen to you” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her and smiled, “I won’t be speaking about it to him Hermione because I won’t do that to him, I won’t have him leaving my brother and I alone” I snarled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I knew that I was going to have to explain my reasoning to her as she looked confused, so she would understand my reasoning for not telling Sirius about my feelings for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her and sighed, “look I am sorry if it isn't the best thing for me mione and I am sorry if you don’t think this is the best idea” I explained, “but I will not ruin the only family that Harry and I have been able to get since we were left parentless” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked to me and laughed, “so you’re going to pretend nothing is there to make sure that your brother doesn’t have to go back to that horrible place” she said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her and laughed, “Harry is my world Hermione” I explained and sighed, “if I tell him the truth, I might make it worse for the both of us” I explained. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand that Pandora but I think that your brother would want you to be happy because he does care for you more than you realise” Hermione said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I nodded as I was aware of this and smiled, “you have to understand that Harry and I have been in a horrible family because of what happened to us and I won’t do that to my brother if all goes wrong. He deserves to have a family that cares and loves him” I said to her and watched as she sighed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I knew that she wasn’t convinced with the idea that I wanted to do but I knew that I couldn’t do this to Harry if all went wrong and she knew that one herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I looked to her realising that we were going to be late if we stayed outside any longer, “come on we have potions and we don’t want to be late” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodded and I knew she was still worried about what I wanted to do, “Hermione I am sorry, but when we get to go home tomorrow I am going through with my plans and I am sorry if that means that you don’t want to speak to me or even look at me anymore” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please think on what I said to you Pandora” she asked and I sighed as I looked to her, “sorry, but by the time that we get back to school, I won’t be feeling like this and we can all move on” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is a bad idea because you will lose who you are and I for one like this version of you” she said and looked to me, “please think on what I have said Dora, I don’t think that you want to do something that you are going to regret” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“fine, but I won’t change my mind Hermione, this is something that I will be doing when I get on break” I said to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>We both walked back into the castle where I noticed that Draco was waiting for me and smiled as he grabbed my hand and wrapped his arm around my shoulders, I smiled as I looked to him, “nice for you to wait for me Dray” I said as I kissed his cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dray smiled as he looked to me, “come on we don’t want him in a worse mood than normal and you walking in with Hermione might just give him a reason to take more points from both houses for a change” he said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I grinned as I turned back to Hermione and grinned, “thanks and I promise that I will think about it okay” I said and she nodded, “please do, I worry” she said and I smiled as she decided to walk behind us to potions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>We got to the dungeons and I smiled as I looked to her, “I’ll see you later mione, thanks for speaking to me” I said to her and waved as we walked into potions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sat down next to Draco as we took our seats and sighed as Snape walked in with his robes billowing like normal and I had to admit that he looked even more pissed than normal, Snape looked to us all and snarled, “steps are on the board and don’t mess this up, this is something that you should be able to do in your sleep” he snapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>We all watched as he walked into his office and I turned to Draco, “wonder what got him in a bad mood this time” I asked and frowned, “I don’t think that he has seen any other students for a while today” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco sighed as he looked to me, “I have no idea why he is like this, I remember when I was younger he was always nice to be around but recently he hasn’t been around a lot as he and dad have fallen out over something” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I frowned as something wasn’t right there, I looked to him and smiled, “you know that he doesn’t like to speak to anyone or look at anyone as they seem to put him in a worse mood” he said to me and I sighed as I looked to him, “wonder if it is someone he is upset over” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looked to me and laughed, “I don’t think so, I haven’t ever seen my godfather date” he said to me and I looked to him, “well he is a human being and I think that he is capable of dating” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I thought about my love life and sighed, maybe I should think about dating to try and take my mind of Sirius. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>We went to making the potion that was on the board for Snape as we knew that if we didn’t make it correctly he would end up taking points from us, we knew that we couldn’t need to mess up either as that would be another reason for him to take more points from us all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the moment Severus was known for taking points from his own house which was the one thing that made us realise that he was no longer the happy potions professor he used to be, Draco and I finished our potion and quickly poured it into vials and smiled as we walked up to the desk Severus was sat at and placed it on his desk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter, Draco” he said not looking up from what he was doing, I smiled trying to hide the hurt from him not liking me because it was something that I just couldn’t understand as he was just so cruel to me and my brother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I knew he hated my brother because he was the image of my father but I didn’t know why he hated me so much, I sighed as I looked to him, “there you go sir, should be to how you want it” I said as I looked to him, “do you mind if I am excused for the last 10 minutes of class please sir” I asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus looked to me and snarled, “why Potter, is there somewhere else that you need to be than my classroom” he asked and I sighed, “these are monthly reasons professor and well I don’t think you want it all over your classroom” was all I said to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“of course you can be excused but next time make sure that you have it sorted before you come to my class Potter” he said to me and I nodded, “of course sir, thank you” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus looked to me and sighed, “I am sure that the hospital wing will be able to help you potter” he said to me and I nodded, “thank you professor” I said as I walked over to my table and grabbed my bag walking out of the class not looking at Draco or my brother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I got out of the dungeons and made my way up to the room of requirement where I sat down on the floor and sobbed as I was not feeling happy about the idea I was getting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I felt a hand on my shoulder which made me jump as I didn’t think that I would be disturbed in here and looked up to see Hermione stood there and she smiled as she slid down next to me, I figured that she must have had followed me from the potions class.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told Harry and Draco that I would come to the hospital wing with you as I didn’t think you would want them here” she said and I looked to her, “why would you come when I was horrible to you” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“well I thought that you could use a friend Dora” she said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her wiping my eyes as I broke down again, “I am sorry that I snapped at you, I am just so confused about things is all” I said to her and she smiled as she wrapped her arm around me and smiled, “don’t worry so much about snapping at me, I am used to your brother and his little temper tantrums when he doesn’t get his own way with Ron and I” she said making me laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to wipe my memory and heart of him Hermione, I cannot live through my life and wonder what if all the time because I will never move on with my life and I believe that I need to” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happens if he feels the same way for you that you do him” she asked me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed as I looked to her, “Hermione I am nearly 16 years old and I don’t think that he is going to go for a teenager” I said and smirked, “plus I don’t think that he will want to date me let alone the daughter of one of his best friends who he has lost” I said to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione laughed as she looked to me, “please do remember that the laws in our world are different to the ones in the muggle world Pandora and well you have been living in that horrible place” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“what laws would these be” I asked as I knew that she would be aware of everything in this world, I frowned as she rolled her eyes at me, “you and your brother really don’t read our books in the library do you” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am not a book worm Hermione, I don’t like to always read as you do, and well you know that I always have better things to do” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione smiled as she looked to me, “haha” she said and smiled, “ the laws in our world say that you can date and older witch or wizard because we don’t age the same as the muggles do” Hermione explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I nodded and she smirked, “so we are encouraged to date older because we can make the pureblood family’s better as they won’t have the same blood in them any longer, stopping the inbreeding” she explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I had to admit that this was new to me and I couldn’t help but look confused which was still making her laugh, “Pandora, what I mean is that Sirius will look like he does for the next 100 to 120 years because we don’t age like muggles” she said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her and smirked thinking about Sirius in that way, “don’t daydream, I am speaking to you Pandora and I don’t need you doing that” Hermione snapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just thinking of some nice things is all” I said as I raised my hands, she laughed as she looked to me, “it is there to say that we can date younger or older depending on who we are liking if we want to” she explained and I nodded, “because we aren’t like the muggles” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pandora I am asking that you please trust me and speak to him first if he doesn’t like you the way you do there are other things we can do than ripping your soul to pieces” she said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her with worry on my face, “Hermione what happens if I speak to him and say that I love him” I said, “what happens when I say please can we date because that is the one thing that I want most in this world and he looks at me with disgust on his face” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happens when he says no and doesn’t want me around him anymore, I don’t think that I can deal with that heartbreak” I said to her and she smirked, “well that one is easy, I will wipe the memory from the both of you so it was like you never asked the question and I will get rid of the feelings that you are feeling” she said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her, “can’t you do that to me now so I don’t have to feel this” I asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to me and she shook her head, “no Pandora because that is the easy way out” she said and smirked, “you are going to speak to him about this Pandora” she said to me and growled, “I need to make you and your brother see that you are allowed to be happy in this world and that the world doesn’t need you to give everything up for it” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I swear you should have been in Slytherin when you say things like that Mione” I muttered to her and she laughed, “I think that we need to come up with a plan to make you see that you are worth everything to Sirius” she said making me look confused again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well I believe that to begin with, we need to see if there is an attraction there for him as well,” she said as she looked me up and down, I frowned as I looked to her, “what do you want me to do, walk over to him and kiss him, see if he kisses me back” I asked as I crossed my arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“no there is an easier way to do this then you going up and doing that” she said. I looked to her and smirked, “always take the fun away from me don’t you mione” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“bring me the clothes that you have with you Pandora and then we will go from there” she said and I sighed as I looked to her, “I don’t have any clothes that fit me Mione” I said and she looked to me, “you know that Harry and I weren’t allowed clothes. We always got Dudley’s things which would fit both harry and I in together if we tried” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to me and growled, “I hate those muggles for what they did to the both of you” she said and I smiled as she was one of the people that knew all the things that happened to us both; being that Harry was the one to confide in her and Ron and Draco being the one that I would confide in as well his parents as they were always nice to me when they saw me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to me and smiled which I had to admit did look scary because that was normally the look to come from me, “come on we can go to London and get some clothes, I will get a note from madam promfoy saying that you need to get some woman things due to not having any and we can leave now” she said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to her and smiled as this was a nice side to Hermione, not a lot of people really got to know Hermione as they always through that she was a know it all and that was not worth speaking to, I found that once you got past that part of her she was a really nice down to earth girl. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked over to her and noticed that she was muttering to herself about everything needed for this trip and I knew that it was coming up to class and I knew that we would be late which would not be good so I smiled, “well how about we go tomorrow because it is nearly dinner and I don’t think that we would be good to miss our classes being that it is our last class” I said to her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to me as she nodded, “plus that way you know that I won’t speak to Remus straight away and you can try out your idea because I think that you are enjoying this a little bit too much” I said to her which made her smile as she nodded, “alright then, we have a plan then don’t we” she said to me and I laughed as she wrapped her arm around me as we got up off the floor and walked out of the room of requirement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione and I walked down to class that we would have next and noticed that we were going to be a little late, Hermione turned to me and smiled, “come on we have McGonagall and you know that she doesn’t like it when we are late for her lessons” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I moaned as I looked to her, “she really doesn’t like me for some reason” I said making Hermione laugh, “she is just bitter that she didn’t get the potter twins is all Dora, she thought that she would get the both of you as she does have the Weasley twins as well” Hermione said making me grin at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked as I looked to her, “they are more trouble than me, but she just seems to always yell and pick on me when we are in class” I said to her as I crossed my arms as I pouted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to me and smirked, “are you whining Pandora” she asked and I smirked, “I spend too long around you people” I said as she laughed, “she will come around to you in time” she said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I grinned as we walked into our last class of the day where McGonagall looked to us and sighed, “Miss Potter, Miss Granger, why are you late?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as I looked to her, “monthly reasons for me and well Hermione was already in the bathroom when I came out” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I watched as she softened and nodded, “okay then, please don’t be late again Miss Potter” she asked and I nodded, “of course Professor, Sorry again” I said as I waved bye to Hermione. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I took my seat and Draco looked to me with worry in his eyes, I smiled as he took my hand, “what’s going on because I know it isn't that Dora, you came on a week ago because you were more bitchy and mean than normal” he said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked as I looked to him, “Hermione likes someone in her house and well she is finding it hard to tell them so she wanted to come to someone that is able to help her” I lied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I felt bad about lying to him as I knew that he would yell at me when the truth came out as I was sure it would over time and well being that he was my best friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco smirked as he looked to me and laughed, “the little mud blood can’t get someone she wants, shame” he said and I smacked him over the head and looked to him, “her name is Hermione Draconis” I snarled “I would remember to use that in my presence, you are not your father” I snarled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I watched as he looked to me with shock on his face, “you have never called me that before” he said and I looked to him, “I am not worried about kicking your ass in front of people Draco, I do not like that word and you know that I don’t” I snapped and turned back to the front deciding that I would ignore Draco until he realised that he wasn’t his father. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked around for my brother as I knew that he would be in this class as we did have most of our classes with the Gryffindors due to Albus thinking that we needed to be in all our classes together, it was then when I noticed that Hermione was once again telling Ron and Harry how to do what we were learning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I couldn’t help but shake my head wondering how my brother and his best friend made it through our school classes because they were always getting Hermione’s help when it came to it and I knew that if they didn’t have Hermione to help them that they wouldn’t have passed half their classes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deciding to put that to the back of my mind for the moment as I knew over the break I would have to be having some words with my brother about his schoolwork.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed as McGonagall went to showing the class how to change a rock into a glass and back again telling us that we needed to make sure we were paying attention, “now for this to work for you, all you have to do is to see the glass in your mind for it to turn into the glass from the rock” she explained to us all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked down to the rock that was in front of me and smirked as I knew that everyone apart from our friends always thought my brother was the one with all the magic, I smirked as  I pictured a glass and tapped the tip of my wand to the rock and watched as the rock became what I pictured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I grinned as I knew that I was being watched and tapped the rock again watching as it turned back into the rock it was previously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that McGonagall was smiling at me and nodded, “well done Miss Potter, first in the class to get it correct” she said and looked to me, “50 points to Slytherin for transforming the rock into a cup and back again” she said to me and I smiled as Draco looked proud that someone else had given us points other than Snape. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the class had now finished McGonagall smiled as she looked over to us all, “I hope you all have a good break and enjoy your Christmas’s, we will see you back here in 3 weeks” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I got up and turned to Draco and noticed that he looked scared of me, “I want you to say you’re sorry to Hermione Draco, there was no need for that otherwise you and I are going to fall out and you know that you and I are good friends” I snapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dora” he started and I shook my head, “no, I mean it Draco. You don’t need to be a prick all the time, I have told you this many times but we like nice Draco” I said to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looked to me and nodded, “of course” he said to me, I laughed as I noticed that my brother was waiting for me outside the classroom and I looked back to Draco and smiled as he really was thinking about what I said to him, “I will meet you in the great hall, I need to speak to my idiot brother before he gets himself into trouble” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I walked outside with Draco next to me and I sighed as I noticed that Harry was looking at Draco, “Don’t start” I asked and watched as he nodded. I had to admit that it did make me frown as normally he would try anything to be at each other’s necks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked to me and then to him and sighed, “fine, ill play nice” he said and I smiled as we walked down the hall, “so you going to tell me what is wrong with you because I know that the monthly reasons were a lie” he said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him and smiled, “nothing is wrong Harry, I just needed to get out of the class as Snape is being an ass more and more” I explained. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as I looked to him, “I just didn’t want to deal with it is all” I said and he nodded, “sure there isn't anything wrong because being your twin brother doesn’t mean anything but fine, don’t speak to me” he said and sniffed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed as I looked to him, “and they call me a drama queen” I said making him smack me as he looked to Draco, “you agree she is more of the drama queen than I am” Harry said making me look to Dray, “I am not” I said putting my hand to my chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>We walked into the great hall and smirked as we were both laughing about different things, I turned to my brother as I grinned, “I will see you later little brother, this woman needs food” I said and he nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I went to leave but Harry quickly grabbed me and smiled, “please remember that we are taking the train back home, so we cannot be late” Harry muttered, “as he will only be pissed at us about it and you know what that means when we get back to the house” Harry explained. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I nodded as I looked to him, “yeah Remus is going to meet us before we have to see the idiots to make sure that we are alright and of course he is going to see if he can get Padfoot there as well” I said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and I noticed that he was looking at me strangely and I had to leave as I couldn’t help the red to come to me as I thought about Sirius and the things that I wanted him to do to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to my brother and smiled, “I will see you later little brother” I said making him growl at me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I walked over to my table chuckling as I was thinking back to the annoyed face of my brother as I knew he didn’t like it when I called him little brother, I noticed that Draco was sat there and he was still pouting from earlier which made me laugh even more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sat down next to him and he sighed as he turned to me, “fine I will say I am sorry later okay” he said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I nodded as I looked to him, “you better Draco Malfoy because I don’t like this side to you and you know that I don’t” I growled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco nodded and looked to me, “sorry I upset you,  you know that I don’t like it when your upset or mad with me” he said to me making me smile, “your forgiven Dray, just don’t use that word around me or at all if you can help it” I asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as he went to eating something that was on his plate making me laugh as this was Draco all over, I looked over and noticed that we were being stared at by Pansy which was making me laugh as she was still sour about me being around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I grabbed hold of the cupcake that was in front of me and moaned as this was going to be the first lot of chocolate that I was going to get and couldn’t help the smirk to come to my face as Draco, Theo and Baise looked to me, “you have a chocolate problem” Theo said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“of course I do” I said and grinned as Daphne walked into the hall and laughed as she walked over to me, “more chocolate” she asked me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I went to speak to her when I noticed that Dumbledore had got up and was making his way over to me, I frowned as I looked over to my friends, “wonder what I have done now, he only ever speaks to me when I have done something really wrong to him or his precious golden boy” I said and Draco nodded, “he doesn’t like that you’re a snake, Dora you know that he doesn’t” he said and I smirked as he got closer to us.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore stopped in front of me and smiled, “Miss Potter, how are we today” Dumbledore said and I sighed as I looked to him, “fine, what have I done now” I said as I tried to hide the hatred I had for the man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus smiled as he looked to me, “please can you come with me Pandora, I need to speak to you about something that I think you will find nice and make you happy for the future” he said not answering my question. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to the man and couldn’t help the frown to come to my face as I didn’t think that I had done anything wrong in the last couple of weeks, I looked to the headmaster and smiled pretending that I was the sweetest person in the world, “I haven’t done anything have I, I believe that Draco and I have been well behaved this last term” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked as the headmaster looked to me, “of course not my child, this isn't anything bad otherwise I am sure you and Mr Malfoy here would have both been called to my office” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I wanted to tell him to piss off as there was nothing in the world that would make me happy being around this man but I couldn’t so I smiled as he went to speak again, “I just need you to come with me and your brother as I have a surprise for the both of you” he said to me and I nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I turned to Draco and smiled, “please make sure that you do say you’re sorry to Hermione Dray” I said to him and smiled as he nodded, “I will see you later as I am sure that I am really in trouble” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked over to my brother and frowned as normally it was only me that was the one being told off by the headmaster, I knew that this must as been something else as well harry was his little golden boy and couldn’t do anything wrong in his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I wrapped my arm around his shoulder and smirked as he looked to me, “wonder what we have done, he says that it is a surprise but I am not sure on that as a surprise and me in the sentence isn't normal for him” I explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked to me and frowned, “well I haven’t fought with Malfoy a lot this year and I haven’t been in any bad places either so I don’t think that we have done anything bad together either to make us both be in trouble with him this year” Harry said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked as I looked to him, “I am sure that this school cannot withstand two sets of twins that like to prank people as Professor McGonagall will have a meltdown” I said to him. Harry looked to me and smirked as he nodded, “she would probably yell and give out detentions to us all” he said making me laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that we were coming up to the headmaster’s office and I couldn’t help but wonder what it was that we were walking into as I was normally right not to trust people since being abused. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry and I walked into the headmaster’s office and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing; here was Sirius and Remus who we were told that wouldn’t be able to look after us because of the wards at the house we would normally have to stay in as Dumbledore was always saying that the blood wards would always protect my brother and I.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I knew that this was too good to be true, I knew that us living with the both of them wouldn’t happen as I knew that Albus wouldn’t be able to control my brother and I, well more my brother as he doesn’t really like me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I felt as my heart was beating faster than normal as Sirius was giving me that dopy smile that made me want to run into his arms and confess everything to him but I knew that I needed to vent my frustration on to someone else otherwise it all was going to come to light which would not be a good idea. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>My main worry was Sirius because he shouldn’t have been here with him escaping Azkaban and all that,  and I knew that with him being here he was going to be thrown back into Azkaban and this was something that I wouldn’t deal with because of this idiot headmaster. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I turned my attention to Albus and growled, “Sirius cannot be here Albus, he is still wanted for the murder of my parents which you will not help with for some stupid reason” I snarled and Harry frowned, “Dora” Harry said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to the headmaster, “I will not lose my family because you’re being pig-headed to do anything about it” I snapped at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that Albus went to get up but Remus put his hand up looking to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I watched as Remus got up and looked to me, I knew that he was wanting to tell me that I shouldn’t be rude but I noticed that Albus ignored my god-father and walked over to me and smiled, I kept my footing as I knew that me pushing away would only cause trouble and kept the sick look off my face when he placed his hands on my shoulders, “you don’t need to panic Pandora” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have spoken to the ministry in regards to Sirius problem, and well Pandora your god-father is now a free man and free from all the warrants that were out there for him to be arrested” Albus explained and smiled, “he will not be given the kiss” he said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I laughed as I looked to him, “they wouldn’t even get close to him” I snapped and looked over to Sirius to see he was nodding to say that Albus was telling the truth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For some reason there was something screaming at me to tell me that he was lying to my family about this, I nodded as I looked to Albus and put it to the back of my mind to find out later if this was in fact correct. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I forced a smile on my face as Albus turned to me and passed me something which made me frown as he was normally always passing things to my brother, being that he was the boy and boys do better than girls in his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked down and noticed that it was a document from the ministry which made me frown as I didn’t know what was going to happen as this looked like something Albus has made with his magic. I knew that Lucius’s letters were always sent on ministry paper and this was nothing like this which I had a admit made me even more curious to why the headmaster was lying to my god-parents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I noticed that Albus was still looking at me and smiled, “is something wrong child” he asked me and I smiled as I looked to him, “of course not” I said and looked down to the letter, “just this doesn’t look like it is from the ministry is all” I said making him frown at me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus smiled and waved his hand, “of course it is my child, you just haven’t seen anything from them” he said to me. I could admit that I was worried about what this letter could say, I mean it could be that Albus was trying to spilt my brother and I up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that Harry walked over to me and smiled, “are you going to open it or stand there staring at it like it is going to bite you” he said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I grinned as I looked to him, “wouldn’t be the first thing in this school to bite and it wouldn’t be the first book that would bite either” I said to him and frowned as I turned to Albus and held the letter up, “what is this” I asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus walked over to me and smiled, “it is telling you that we have made it so that Remus and Sirius are now the guardians for you and your brother” he said and noticed that he tried not to slip at the part when he said my brother and I.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I nodded and he smiled but I could see that his eyes were not sparkling, “so you don’t have to return to your relatives” he said to me and I turned to them and smiled, “you mean that we don’t have to go back to our aunt and uncle” I asked wanting to make sure they knew we were theirs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus smiled as he looked to us and nodded, “yep you are now stuck with us as your parental guardians” Remus said to us.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled trying to hide the hurt look on my face as my heart was breaking because I realised that Sirius didn’t want me in that way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I knew that I was right to try and get rid of these feelings, I noticed that Harry was looking at me again and I smiled as I looked up to see that they were looking at Harry and I, “Cub, pup” they said to us and I couldn’t help the smile to come to my face as it was finally nice to have someone to call family other than Harry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I ran over to Remus and wrapped my arms around him as I buried myself in his stomach and chest trying not to let the tears fall from the pain I was now in as I knew that I would have to watch as Sirius would be with someone else having something I wanted with the man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I forced a smile on my face as he tightened his hold on me and pulled me out so he was looking at me, “good to see you to cub, I have missed you and your brother so much” he said to me and I smiled as he kissed my head making me feel a little bit better as I knew that I would always have Remus if needed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that I was being looked at and turned around to see that it was Sirius and looked up to him to see that he was smiling at me, “so where is my hug pup because I have missed you as well you know” Sirius said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked as I stayed cuddled into Remus, I knew that he was hurt but I was trying to hide the pain as I looked to him, “sorry Siri” I said to him and stayed where I knew it was safe for me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus sighed as he looked to me which I could tell he was worried as he was giving me the father look which I couldn’t help but frown at as this shouldn’t be working on me, I knew that he wanted to speak to me about something which was probably the reason to why I was pulling away from everyone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that he smiled as he bent down and pushed me onto the chair so he could look to me to make sure that I was looking at him, “want to tell me what is going on Pandora because you starting to worry us” Remus asked me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I shook my head and smiled hiding the pain, “nothing is wrong Remy, it’s just been a long day is all” I said and Remus sighed, “Pandora I know something is wrong because your brother wrote to us a few times saying that something is going on with you” Remus said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked over to my brother and growled, “I said it was fine” I said and Remus smiled, “he is worried as are we” he said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I knew that my brother was worried about me but I couldn’t say anything for the reason of not wanting to have to go back to the Dursley’s, even now that they have guardianship over the both of us.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to Remus and smiled as I shook my head, “Nope, nothing to worry about Remy I am fine, I promise you” I said and he sighed, “I am going to go with Dora and get her stuff Siri, why don’t you get Harry’s stuff and we will meet back here in an hour as I am sure that these two don’t tidy up after themselves” Remus said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus turned to me as we walked out of the office and smiled as he bent down and put his hands on my waist making me look at him, “now that we are alone, please can you speak to me Dora” Remus asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t” I said and he smiled, “please sweetheart, I am worried about you” Remy said and I knew there I had done wrong. “It isn’t like you to hide your feelings about things” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I looked to him, “if I tell you what is wrong with me, promise me that you won’t think I am a horrible person or that you or Siri won’t disown me because I don’t think that I would be able to deal with that at all” I explained to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus smiled as he took my hand and looked to me, “cub I promise that you and your brother are everything to me and Siri, and we would never think anything different of you” he said and smiled, “or even disown you for anything that might happen to you and your brother in the future” Remus said and I sighed as I did feel a little better about it now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that Remus was still looking at me and smiled, “please can you tell me what it is that is eating at you” he asked me. I sighed as I looked to him, “I am going to hold you to not thinking any different of me” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright then cub, please tell me what is wrong so we can figure this one out or at least help you in some way” he said. I sighed as I looked to him, “I fell in love with someone that I shouldn’t have” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus looked to me and smiled, “who is the lucky boy or is it a lucky girl” he asked and I smirked as I looked to him, I knew that Siri and Remy didn’t mind who we dated as they had already told us that we were to be happy with whoever we chose but I was still worried about what they would think of me being in love with Sirius of all people. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him as I wrung my hands together getting ready to give him the big news, “well it is someone older than me and no it isn't a girl Remy” I said and smirked, “I know you always say that Harry and I are happy to explore but I like guys and only guys” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“so come on what’s his name so I can give him the speech about not breaking your heart” he asked me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him and frowned as I once again had to wipe my eyes as the tears were coming down my face again, “someone that I shouldn’t be attracted to Remy and I feel horrible about it because my heart hurts with all the pain I know is coming” I explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just thinking about the pain I will go through if I tell him how I feel is killing me Remy” I said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus looked to me and took my hands, “let me guess, this man you have fallen in love with is Sirius” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him with a pout on my face, “is it really that easy to see Remy” I asked as I looked to him, “to be honest I thought that I had it under lock and key” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No it isn't the easiest to see sweetie, only to the right people Pandora” Remy said and smiled, “and well I know what it is like to like someone that you shouldn’t,” he said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him and smirked, “ who is it you like” I asked and he smirked, “this is about you dear god-daughter of mine, not me” he said making me frown as I wanted to know who it was that he liked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him and smiled, “what do I do Remy, I need to know what I can do about this because I am worried over this and what he would say to me” I asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“tell him Dora” he said and I sighed as I looked to him, “Remus he is my god-father, I shouldn’t be feeling this for him and I shouldn’t be wanting to sleep with him either” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as I looked to him and he took my hands, “I promise you that it is not as bad as you think, trust me when I say ‘speak to him’” Remy said to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I moaned as I looked to him, “why are you and Hermione telling me to speak to him” I growled and turned around, “I don’t want to be disowned Remy and I don’t know if you have noticed but I am not the normal type of girl he goes for” I snapped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dora I promise that he isn't going to disown you or anything else, I promise you that he will surprise you” Remy explained to me and smirked, “plus you didn’t know him in school, you are right up his street for looks and well your redheaded which is a big thing for him” he said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I couldn’t help but laugh, “well I'm sorry but his parents disowned him because he was put into Gryffindor and well I am everything that he should have been” I said and looked to him, “he isn't going to want to be with a Slytherin witch that is supposed to go dark because she is in the dark house and not to mention that I am his best friends daughter” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remy looked to me and smiled, “first thing Pandora, you are not and never will be a dark witch, whoever told you that you were going to be dark can answer to me because I will yell at them all” Remus said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as this was the parental side to him that I loved as it reminded me that I would always have a father to go to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I didn’t tell you this Pandora” he said and I looked to him, “tell me what Remy” I asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sirius would end up trying to kill me if he found out I told you this, but I need to tell you because I have a feeling that you want to do something stupid and I cannot lose you” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him with confusion on my face, “what are you trying to tell me Remy” I asked and he sighed, “Pandora the feeling you have for Sirius isn't just one way, he feels the same way about you that you do him” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“wait what” I asked and he sighed, “Sirius hasn’t been sleeping too well at night” Remy admitted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I would admit that I felt for him as I knew about that pain he was feeling as it was the same for me, you see when I would think about him it would give me a hard time sleeping which wasn’t good and I knew that he would be having a hard time about it as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I was pulled out of my head when I felt Remus put his hand on my shoulder, “he dreams of you and he is worried that it is the reason why you’re not speaking to him” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him as I wiped my eyes, “I am the reason that he is having nightmares” I asked and he smiled, “no Pandora, you are not the reason he is having nightmares” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“he is having nightmares because he thinks that you will laugh and just walk away from him” he said and smiled as he took my hand, “he thinks that you are disgusted with him Pandora, he thinks that you will walk out of his life if he tells you the truth” Remy said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him and frowned, “I would never do that to him” I said and he smiled, “ he doesn’t want that to happen, he thinks that he is hiding it well but well I know my best friend when it comes to his love life” he said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as I looked to him, “he thinks that I am disgusted with him, Remy he is everything that I want in life. I could never be disgusted in him” I explained and Remy smiled at me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“you have to remember that Sirius hasn’t had a relationship in a long time because of the past and well even in school he was a flirt but he was always looking for his one girl” he explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to know about the past girls that he has slept with Remy, I don’t think that I would be happy knowing that someone else has had him” I explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“he was never happy with them because he was always looking for his mate, his one true mate” he explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“and that would be” I asked hoping that he would say me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus smirked as he looked to me, “I know that this girl is you Pandora” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as my heart was beating so fast that I wanted to run back to him and tell him that I loved him so much but instead, I looked to Remus and smiled, “let me think on this please because this is a lot to be told in a small amount of time” I asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t take too long and I promise that I won’t say anything to him” Remy said to me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“thanks Moony it means the world to me that you told me the truth” I said and he laughed, “come on then cub, we don’t want them to come looking for us” he said making me laugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>We walked down to the dungeons and I quickly put my hand on the side and smiled as the door appeared laughing as Remy looked amazing that this was how we got into our dorm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him, “it is a mixture of handprints and passwords over the months because we snakes don’t trust certain people in the castle” I explained and walked further into the common room with Remus behind me gapping at everything, “wow it is beautiful in here” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I believe that we are under the black lake” I said to him and he smiled as he nodded, “it is beautiful in here and I thought that it would be dark and dingy” he said and I laughed, “well we all don’t have the luck of staying in a tower for our common rooms” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I watched as Draco walked over to me and smiled, “I said sorry to Hermione and well I think that she was shocked that I said sorry to her” he said and I smirked as he was looking to Remus, “also what’s going on because you know we don’t like Gyffindorks down here” he said making me laugh as Remy smirked at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as I looked to him, “Well I have some news for you” I said and he smirked, “oh tell” he said taking my hand and pulling me down to the sofa with Remy behind me. “Harry and I get to live with Sirius and Remus instead of having to return to our aunt and uncle” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as he wrapped his arms around me, “thank god, I don’t like it when you go to your aunt and uncles, they are always mean to you” he said making me smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him and grinned feeling happy for the first time in a long time, I turned back to Draco and smiled; “well I need to grab my stuff as we are leaving today” I said and smiled, “so I will see you soon as I am sure that Remy and Siri will let me have you over for the holidays” I said and hugged him quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remy followed me into my dorm room and he smirked as he pointed to the other bed, “I thought it was at least 3 to a room” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to him and smirked, “well Pansy is still bitching that I am in Slytherin and doesn’t like to share with me so Severus decided that he would swap me with Daphne so now I am sharing with Daphne and she is with someone else” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remy frowned and I just laughed as I grabbed the case and quickly went to put all my clothes inside making Remy laugh, “I think that we need to teach you to fold your clothes cub” Remy said making me grin at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I closed the lid to the trunk and Remy walked over waving his wand and making it smaller so he would be able to put it in his pocket and smiled as he turned to me, “come on then, I believe we need to go otherwise they are going to come looking for us” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Remy and I got back to the headmaster’s office I noticed that Sirius was sat down on the chair and looked broken over me not want to speak to him or hug him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sighed as Remy walked behind me and put his hand on my shoulder, “speak to him, he needs to know that you are okay with him” he whispered to me. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I went to speak when I noticed that my brother had his hand on his shoulder, “she is just having a horrible time is all Padfoot and she will come around” Harry said and I frowned as maybe I was making this more difficult than I needed to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked over to them and smiled as it was always Harry that was trying to make everything better for the both of us, “Plus you know Pandora, she is all heart and fight when it comes to admitting that she has some feelings for someone” I heard Harry say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I looked to Remus wanting to know if I had time to speak to him now, “how long have we got till we have to leave” I asked and Dumbledore walked through the door and looked to me, “we must being going now so you can have a look around your new home” he said to us.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I nodded and turned my attention to Sirius and smiled, “sorry if I made you think that I am not happy Siri, I am okay just having some issues at the moment that I need to work through is all” I said to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as he looked to me and smiled but it wasn’t one that would cover his face and I felt horrible as I knew that this was because of me, “is it me that is making you uncomfortable” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I walked over to him, “no paddy, of course, it isn't you and it could never be you” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked to me and smirked, “paddy” he said and I smirked, “I like it, I think that it is a great nickname for you” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I grinned as he smiled as he got up and walked over to me, “come on I have a surprise for the both of you which I think you’re going to like” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled as he looked to me and opened his arms seeing if I would come to him and smiled as I ran over and pushed myself into his arms to have a hug. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled into the hug and kept the moan from me as he pulled away and looked to me, “well I think you need some meat on your bones little one” he said and Remus laughed, “come on then you two” Remus said and I smiled, “alright then” I said to them both.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>We walked over to the fireplace and he quickly threw powder in and smiled as he turned to us, “come on” he said and Dumbledore smiled as he turned to Paddy, “once again Sirius I am sorry for the part I played in your time in Azkaban and thank you for taking the twins” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked as I watched as Sirius turned to Albus, “of course they are family and they belong with me and only me” he said to Albus and I smirked as he pushed us through the floo. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>We got to a manor and I couldn’t help but look around as we walked through the main room as this place was huge, there was a large staircase in the middle of the hall that I had to admit did look beautiful and then there was a large ballroom to the left that looked like it was newly done. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I turned to Harry and noticed that he too was looking around in awe, “reminds me of the Malfoy’s place, but less dark” I said and he smirked as we heard as the fire went again and we turned around to see that Paddy had come through and turned around to grab the cases from Remy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius and Remy turned to us and smiled, “welcome home you two, we hope it is everything that you would love in a home” he said and I turned to Harry and grinned, “you mean that we get to live with you all the time and not just on odd days” Harry asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked to us both, “only if you want to, I don’t want to make you both do something that you don’t want to” he explained and I smiled, “of course we want to live with you Paddy, we didn’t like it with our aunt and uncle and you know that we didn’t” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I took a deep breath and turned to Paddy, “come take a walk with me, Paddy I am sure that Remus can keep my idiot brother out of trouble for an hour” I said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I noticed that Remus looked to me, “deep breath Pandora and please remember that nothing bad will happen when you tell him the truth” he said and Sirius looked confused about what Remy was saying to me.</span>
