    <p>The Crowley family arrived at Platform 9 3/4 as a party of vibrant green amongst the sea of black cloaks.</p><p>Beez had made Hogwarts history as being the first student head of house whose title claimed them neither “Head Boy” or “Head Girl”.</p><p>They sneered at the masses of first years scrambling through the crowd, managing to exude an air of intimidation despite being shorter than most 12 year olds.</p><p>There had been much conjecture at the Crowley’s dinner table the past few weeks, as to whether Beez had a cis gender counterpart, or whether they were saddled with twice the responsibility.</p><p>“It’z far easier not having to consult with an idiot.” They’d replied hopefully.</p><p>Regardless of gender, Beez did not believe they had a house mate up to the task.</p><p>“<em>Shit</em>,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A head of silvery hair had popped out of the crowd.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ligur was waving at them, whilst gesturing wildly at the shiny head girl badge pinned to her robe.</p><p> </p><p>The two Crowley boys were left behind as Beez muscled their way through the crowd. Hastur, built like a bean stalk, white hair scruffy and matted, was already looking around for his forth year friends.</p><p>“Wait, where are you going?” The younger boy reached out and tugged at Hastur’s arm as he made to disappear in to the crowd. “Mum said you had to stay with me.”</p><p>Hastur shook the arm off and glared at his brother.</p><p>“You’ll be fine, just blend in.” He poked at the red head’s Slytherin robes. “Find your people.” And then disappeared. Leaving Anthony Crowley alone with his sleek black trunk, cage, and potted orchid* to be buffeted around in the crowd.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>*Breeding orchids was a muggle hobby that Anthony had taken to, much to his parent's dismay. This was the first in a litany of disappointments, but they weren't to know that.</em>
</p><p>“Find your people,”</p><p>The boy ran a hand through his shoulder length hair and squared his shoulders, unsure of where to start.</p><p> </p><p>Though people, it seemed, would come to him.</p><p>“Oof—“ he felt a trolley hit the small of his back, sending him stumbling forward.</p><p>“I’m very sorry!” A worried voice rung out and Anthony turned to see a boy his age, wearing plain black robes driving the cart.</p><p>He had a halo of soft white hair that almost glowed. Nothing like what Hastur sported. His eyes were forget-me-not blue and his luggage, it seemed, was mostly books. In fact, undoubtably the reason he’d lost control of the trolley in the first place was due to him guiding it with one hand whilst the other gripped a ridiculously old book to his chest.</p><p>“My mum left me at the barrier.” The boy had a pained expression. “And I just, have a rather lot to carry,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Anthony stepped forward and pried the book from the boy’s grasp, noting how reluctantly he gave it up.</p><p>“I’ll carry it for you.” He stacked it on top of Sally’s cage and, with a complicated manoeuvre, succeeded in hauling all of the items on the the nearest carriage.</p><p>“Oh, okay,” the boy lifted up his own trunks and followed. They quickly found an unoccupied carriage. Anthony made himself busy putting his orchid in a safe spot near the window and securing his bags. The other boy was just standing in the entranceway, staring.</p><p>At Crowley’s robes.</p><p>“So, you’re in Slytherin?” The boy sidled in meekly.</p><p>“Wha— oh not yet.” Anthony waved a hand distractedly. “First year, so I haven’t been sorted but… runs in the family.”</p><p>He could see the boy eyeing Sally as he sat gingerly opposite him.</p><p>“This is Sally, short for Salazar, she’s my snake!” Anthony hoisted up the cage proudly and the boy visibly cowered.</p><p>“She’s not scary or anything.” Sally was, if Hastur was to be consulted, rather underwhelming for a snake. When the family had gone to get their youngest one, he’d fallen in love with the smallest in the shop. Sally was jet black and could coiled around the boy’s forearm but “wasn’t intimidating,” and maybe his parents had looked slightly disappointed at his choice, but they allowed it all the same.</p><p>“I’ll take your word for it, dear.”</p><p>Anthony shot the boy a quizzical look. Who talked like that these days?</p><p>“My name’s Anthony Crowley.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Aziraphale,” the boy reached out to shake his hand.</p><p>Anthony spluttered.</p><p>“What kind of name is that?” The boy shrugged.</p><p>“Nah, I can’t call you that, it’s too complicated. What’s your last name?”</p><p>Aziraphale didn’t quite make eye contact.</p><p>“Angel.” He huffed. Anthony snickered.</p><p>“My god, Angel it is.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">⁂</p><p> </p><p>They settled down in to an awkward silence as the last stragglers boarded the train. Surprisingly, nobody else sought to invade their compartment. Perhaps it was the work of Sally, staring down all potential intruders. Hastur didn’t find her very intimidating, but if one were to survey the entire student body, they would provide a different assessment.</p><p>“So,” Aziraphale cleared his throat slightly. “You think you’ll be in Slytherin?”</p><p>“I know I’ll be in Slytherin.” Anthony said confidently. It was a given. If anyone was looking to start a fraudulent career in fortune telling they might as well predict the outcome of this sorting to claim as their first successful prophecy. Besides, the actual prophets, Anthony thought smugly, wouldn’t want to waste prophecies on the obvious.</p><p>There was a pained expression on the other boy’s face.</p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me you’re one of those people.” Anthony scoffed.</p><p>The boy shook his head, but his expression betrayed him.</p><p>“Jesus Christ.” Anthony slammed his hand down on the top of Sally’s cage, causing Aziraphale to jump. “We’re in the god dammed 21<sup>st</sup> century and you still think that we’re evil or something?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He glowered.</p><p>“No, it’s not— it’s just—“ Aziraphale scrambled to put appropriate words together, failing completely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“My brother said not to trust Slytherins.” He said defensively.</p><p>“And who’s your brother? Obviously not Mr. Head of House relations.”</p><p>Aziraphale’s face creased in a small smile.</p><p>“Well, no. My brother is Gabriel. He’s a prefect, for, for Gryffindor.”</p><p>Anthony snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh, right, so that’s how it’s going to be. Mr. Holier than Thou, okay.”</p><p>He reclined back as the train began to pull away from the platform, propping his boots on the seat beside Aziraphale.</p><p>“I hardly think that I’m <em>holier</em>—“ squeaked Aziraphale. Anthony couldn't help but chuckle watching the boy get so flustered.</p><p>“S’a joke, angel.”</p><p>“Oh,” he visibly relaxed. “Oh, my book!” He sprung up and searched around wildly. Anthony made the poor choice to casually toss the heavy tome across to him.</p><p>“Oops, sorry.” Aziraphale doubled over in pain as the book hit in him the stomach.</p><p>“No worries, just wanted to make sure it was safe.” He sat down again and patted the cover gently, almost like…</p><p>“Speaking of safe.” Crowley sat up slightly. “Don’t you think you’ve maybe left your owl behind?”</p><p>The boy looked back at him blankly.</p><p>“Cat?” He tried again.</p><p>“Toad? Oh, please angel don’t tell me you bought a toad?” He groaned. Aziraphale waved away his concern.</p><p>“No, no. No pet for me. Well…” he trailed off, eyeing the book on his lap. “I had an owl but…”</p><p align="center"> ⁂</p><p> </p><p>Anthony hadn’t stopped laughing for the last 10 minutes. Aziraphale, all the while, trying to defend his decision to swap his barn owl of a first edition of “Hogwarts, A History” with a sixth year on the platform earlier.</p><p>“You gave it away?” He cackled.</p><p>The other boy huffed.</p><p>“No, Anthony. I traded it. It was a fair trade.”</p><p>Anthony eyed the stained book in his lap and bit back a plethora of sarcastic comments that came to mind.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” he held his arms up in surrender, and the compartment lapsed in to silence once more. This time, it was almost comfortable.</p><p>Whilst Aziraphale certainly had his house preferences, and Slytherin was not one of them, he did have to admit that he was slightly jealous of the boy now napping opposite him. He had one thing that Aziraphale craved, that was certainty. It had been all up in the air for the boy since he’d received his letter. Of course, it would be ideal if he ended up in Gryffindor with his brother. He fidgeted with the book on his lap. He wasn’t particularly brave, Gabriel was quick to remind him of that fact. Perhaps it wouldn’t be the end of the world if he ended up in Ravenclaw, he heard they had a lovely private library. In amongst all the uncertainty, these were the only two options that his brain allowed him to entertain.</p><p align="center"> ⁂</p><p>They exited the carriage in to the chilling night, Anthony once again insisting on carrying Aziraphale’s extra book. A bellow of “First Years” guided them through the darkness and their first view of the castle came as the fleet of boats rounded the corner of the Great Lake.</p><p>Aziraphale gave an excited little squeal, which made Anthony snigger. Little was his new friend to know that there’d been talk in the Angel family about whether Aziraphale would be invited to attend. There was something unremarkable about him, his father had often said. Of course, he’d meant squib-like.</p><p>“This is like a dream come true!”</p><p>Anthony looked over at the pure excitement on the boy’s face and softened a little. From their talk he knew that Aziraphale came from a half-blood family, magic was allowed, this was no great revelation like the mutterings of the muggle borns on board. But something about the expression of the boy as he talked of home, felt cold and detached and suddenly made Anthony a little glad that every once in a while Beez bothered with him. It also made him a bit sad.</p><p align="center">⁂ </p><p> </p><p>They filed in to the Great Hall, Aziraphale and Anthony the first waiting to be sorted. The other students muttered and peeked out at the new offerings. From across the room Anthony heard an obnoxious “Wahoo!” and turned to see Hastur and his cronies waving at him. He shrunk down behind Aziraphale slightly. He squeezed his friend’s hand as McGonagall called out</p><p>“Aziraphale Angel,”</p><p>There was a polite smattering of applause from the Gryffindor table, perhaps the closest Gabriel had ever gotten to showing his younger brother affection.</p><p>The boy stumbled forward and placed the hat on his head.</p><p>He looks like an angel, Anthony thought to himself. Despite the grotty hat perched atop his halo of curls, Aziraphale just sort of glowed. With goodness, or something, Anthony wasn’t good at identifying these things, being a…</p><p>“Slytherin!”</p><p><em>Yes, that was it.</em> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>No, no, no, he was pulled from his thoughts as a thunderous applause swept from the Slytherin table. Aziraphale, hat in hand, looked like he was about to cry. Shaking his head in disbelief, he met Anthony’s eyes, pleading for something.</p><p>Shocked, but ready to make the best of the situation, Anthony gave him an encouraging smile. <em>Hey, we’ll be together after all.</em> He tried to project the thoughts directly in to the boy’s brain. <em>This is great.</em></p><p>Aziraphale was shaking as he made his way over to his new house.</p><p>It’s fine. Anthony felt a small spark of hope. His stomach turned at having to be friends with a Gryffindor. “<em>Having to be</em>” because he wasn’t giving up on the angel that easily. But now, it was going to be better. They were going to be together.</p><p>He marched up to the stool and jammed the hat on his head.</p><p><u>Hmmm quite confident aren’t we?</u> It muttered slyly.</p><p><em>Yes, Slytherin, of course.</em> Anthony could even make his thoughts come off as sarcastic.</p><p><u>Did you just roll your eyes young man?</u> The hat huffed.</p><p>
  <em>Maybe.</em>
</p><p>
  <u>Hmmm, right.</u>
</p><p>Anthony started to get antsy, it felt like he’d been sitting there forever already.</p><p>
  <u>All things considered, looking in to this head of yours, it best be—“</u>
</p><p>Anthony’s senses must have short-circuited because, next thing, there’s an uproar and McGonagall is taking the hat from him and guiding him towards his house table and a sea of yellow is cheering him on. <em>Wait.</em> Cheering because they were glad he wasn’t in their house? <em>Obviously</em>. He tried to steer himself towards the Slytherin table, but they were all glaring at him. Down the back he swore Hastur was giving him the finger. At the head of the table, Aziraphale sat wide eyed, shaking his head at his friend.</p><p>Anthony’s head dropped through the solid oak floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>No.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then his brain caught up, and he could hear the hat’s cry of “Hufflepuff” echoing off the walls. His stomach twisted and he shuffled over to his new house mates. As he dropped in to a seat, students in yellow ties began clapping him on the back enthusiastically.</p><p>“Hey, mate.” A boy sitting across from him, brown hair sticking up at awkward angles and glasses askew leaned forward. “You alright?”</p><p>Anthony grappled with the speech centre of his brain for a few seconds before choking out the best he could manage</p><p>“Yeah, it’s tickity-boo.”</p><p align="center">⁂ </p><p> </p><p>In their spare time, the Sorting Hat spent many hours composing a song for the start of the next school year. This meant a lot of time spent trawling through dictionaries, lamenting the lack of words rhyming with “chivalry” and the like. They’d taken a fancy to some words over the centuries. Their sorting decisions were, of course, the topic of much contention amongst students and teachers alike. They felt it was below them to explain their methodology, so anytime a student came to ask about their decision making, the hat would reply with this:</p><p>“My sorting process is ineffable.”</p>
