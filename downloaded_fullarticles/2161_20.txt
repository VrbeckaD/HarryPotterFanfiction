    <p>Chapter 1</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy was sitting in silence on his porch, looking out over the ocean. The sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of brilliant red, soft pink, and light violet, and a cool breeze swept around him from the sea. He listened with closed eyes as the waves lapped onto the pebbled beach, making quiet trickling noises as the water flowed back to the ocean. It was tranquil, and any onlooker would think the elderly Draco at peace, but they would be wrong. There was a war raging in his mind.</p><p>Draco had lived the perfect life. At least, he did by <em> someone’s </em> standards. Certainly not his own. After his trial, he’d trained under McGonagall with Harry and Hermione to become a transfigurations professor (and in the process changed his relationship to them). He’d worked at Beauxbatons for sixty years, and then retired. He’d met his wife while teaching, and they had a boy and two girls. After he retired, he moved with his wife to Lopez Island, and small island off of the coast of Washington State in the US. A perfect life.</p><p>Draco’s eldest daughter walked on to the porch and placed a hand on her father’s shoulder.</p><p>“Is it time?” she asked. He nodded, so she hugged him one last time. Draco’s life ended warm and tranquil.</p><p>~~~~</p><p>Draco awoke in a vast plane of darkness. He blinked, unsure if his eyes were closed or if the darkness was around him. “Hello?” he called, and the sound echoed inside his head. “Is anyone here?” A bright light appeared in the distance and he looked toward it. For a moment it was stagnant, but then it grew, quickly. Draco shielded his eyes.</p><p>He felt a hand pull down his arm and the light dissipated a bit. A woman was in front of him. She was tall, and her skin glowed bluish. Draco sat still in silence and confusion.</p><p>“Hello, young one. I am Mother Magic,” she said. Her voice was melodic, soothing. Draco could listen to it forever. “It is not often that one of you comes to see me. You must have made a terrible mistake, many, many years ago. Let’s see..”</p><p>She waved her hand through the void, and it appeared to ripple like water. A blue light spread from the center of the ripples, growing and fading over and over until suddenly, Draco found himself and Mother Magic in a room. The room was painted light blue, and sunlight streamed through the curtains.</p><p>“My first memory,” whispered Draco. He turned around and spotted himself, aged 5, laying facedown on his bed. He’d contracted dragon pox, the milder kind. His younger self sneezed, spewing sparks onto the curtain, and it caught on fire.</p><p>“This isn’t it,” Mother Magic said, resting a glowing hand on Draco’s shoulder. He could almost feel the heat as a  flame flared up, hear his younger self’s screams… and the memory faded.</p><p>The darkness rippled again and a new scene arose. This time, Draco was ten. He was standing stock still as a house elf buttoned up his dress shirt for the Annual Malfoy Winter Solstice Ball. He could remember this exactly, and mouthed his words along with his younger self.</p><p>“I wonder if Harry will be here this time. Mother always says that Harry will come, someday. I really want to meet him, Dobby,” he’d said. Potter had never ended up at one of the extravaganzas, even after he and Draco had become friends.</p><p>“We’re closer, but this still isn’t it,” said Mother Magic, and the memory dissolved into darkness.</p><p>A few minutes seemed to pass, not that Draco could understand how time worked in the void, before a new memory appeared around them. Mother Magic nodded while Draco examined the scene.</p><p>“This is the one. Pay attention,” she called into his ear. Draco shivered and watched himself standing in Madam Malkin’s.</p><p>“Hullo,” he’d said to Harry, “Hogwarts too?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Harry.</p><p>“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street looking at wands,” Draco said. “Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first-years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow. Have you got your own broom?”</p><p>“No,” said Harry.</p><p>“Play Quidditch at all?”</p><p>“No,” Harry said again.</p><p>“I do – Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?”</p><p>“No,” said Harry.</p><p>“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been – imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“Mmm,” said Harry.</p><p>“I say, look at that man!” said younger Draco, nodding towards the front window.</p><p>“That’s Hagrid. He works at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Oh,” younger Draco replied, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?”</p><p>Draco turned to Mother Magic. “I’ve seen enough. What do you want me to do?” he asked. She smiled at him and gestured to the scene.</p><p>“You get one chance to fix this. You’ll retain your memory if you make the fix. If you don’t do it in time, you’ll be stuck on the same path, lose your memories, and have no way out. Otherwise, as soon as you fix it, you’ll live the life that you were supposed to. Or, you can move onto the afterlife now. It’s your choice, Draco,” she explained, soothing voice softening the difficulty of the decision. Draco took a deep breath and pressed a hand to his cheek.</p><p>“Alright,” he whispered after a moment, “I’ll do it, on one condition.” Mother Magic gestured for him to continue.</p><p>“Will this cause Harry to lose the war?” he asked. She just smiled at him. Draco closed his eyes as the void collapsed around him.</p><p>“Befriend him,” he heard.</p>
