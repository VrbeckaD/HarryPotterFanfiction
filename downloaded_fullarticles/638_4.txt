    <p>It's late.</p><p>Draxo Malfoy is tired, and therefore a little bit off guard during Astronomy class tonight. Being a little bit off guard tonight means that he can't take his eyes off Essa.</p><p>“-Malfoy? <em>Malfoy</em>!”</p><p>Draco rips his gaze away from the back of Essa’s head bitterly, drawn out of his daze by Goyle’s insistent pestering. She’d been absentmindedly making the most intriguing faces at her Star Chart, and he’d gotten lost in her expressions -- again. He snaps to attention just in time for the class to end. </p><p>As the Slytherin students begin to file out the Astronomy Tower, Draco rubs his eyes. It's only October, and he's more than ready for summer.</p><p>This year so far has undoubtedly been the worst yet; he'd taken one glance at Essa's timetable in the beginning of the year and felt faint.</p><p>Much to his displeasure, Essa’s two electives consist of Muggle Studies and Magical Theory, neither of which he has ever dreamed of taking in his entire life. He sits through Care of Magical Creatures and Arithmancy along with all his core classes with new disinterest, wishing that he had convinced her to take them with him over the summer or that Hufflepuff and Slytherin aren’t so separated.</p><p>The only time he gets to see Essa in class is Wednesday night, when Professor Sinistra combines classes with all four houses to teach an extra lesson.</p><p>Astronomy has never been difficult for him in years past, but with the OWLs fast approaching it seems as if Professor Sinistra is purposely overloading them with information. Granger answers every question that Sinistra poses with ease, thereby allowing Draco to feverishly take notes.</p><p>Daphne Greengrass, a good acquaintance, is rather talented at Astronomy, but she sits nexts to Theodore Nott instead of Draco; Theodore has been helpless at Astronomy since First Year. Essa seems to do fine, although she occasionally asks Granger for help when the Mudblood isn’t too busy lecturing Potter and Weasley for copying down her answers.</p><p>On Tuesday and Thursday nights, when it is just Slytherin and Ravenclaw, it is harder for Draco to catch up.</p><p>Say what you will about Granger, but that witch knows her Astronomy and can explain all her answers in great detail. The Ravenclaws just say the right things at the right time.</p><p>His exhaustion isn't just from the overwhelming workload either; earlier tonight before dinner, Professors Black and Lupin had held yet another meeting.</p><p>Draco has managed to make every meeting of the Duelling Club, despite his assignments. This may partially be because a <em>certain</em> Hufflepuff by the name of Essa Sterling is rather dedicated to the club, and this dedication somehow extends to him. This may also be because it's the only chance he has to watch her fight -- she fights, he often thinks, like she's dancing.</p><p>Thanks to Essa training him over the summer, he's been able to obtain several badges as well as the title of Slytherin Duelling Club Captain. Essa, on the other hand, easily becomes the Hufflepuff Duelling Club Captain. She wins the favor of Professors Black and Potter, and, much to Draco’s unhappiness, becomes friends with Harry Potter and his Gryffindor friends.</p><p>It seems as if everyone likes Essa, even most of the Slytherins. She sits with Draco, Theodore, and Daphne during lunch two times a week, and soon the entire school is buzzing about how <em>Draco Malfoy</em>, of all wizards, is friends with a blood traitor. It had been a grueling decision not to denounce their friendship.</p><p>They'd argued once, only a few weeks ago, not about their stances on blood purity, but rather after she challenged him to a duel. He instantly predicted the outcome, like everyone else in the room, but cannot help but bristle at how easily she disarmed him before he even had time to blink twice.</p><p>"You disarmed me too fast," he said petulantly that night, trying not to sound too much like he's whining.</p><p>“You wanted me to drag it out?” Essa demanded, eyes narrowed.</p><p>Draco was exasperated, and more than a little bit afraid of her. “No,” he said, “I just wish that you didn’t have to make it so easy.”</p><p>“I’m not going to lose to you on purpose so you can keep your dignity,” she pointed out, less annoyed. “There’s nothing wrong with losing a duel. It’s how you know what to work on.”</p><p>He nodded silently, staring at the portrait behind her and feeling the corners of his lips dip downwards. He might've agreed then, but the memory of his loss never left.</p><p>On nights that he patrols, she sneaks out and sits next to him by the windows, moonlight lighting up half her face and leaving the other side dark. Her nightclothes are not like a typical Pureblood’s (his are silk and engraved with his surname while hers is just an oversized cotton shirt and tiny shorts) but they suit her.</p><p>“I know,” he'd told her that night, “but now Potter won’t stop challenging you until you lose to him.”</p><p>She laughed, and he stared.</p><p>“Harry’s nice, but once he’s got his mind on something, he won’t let go. Don’t worry, Draco, I won’t let him win either.”</p><p>The fact that she is on first name basis with Potter always makes his insides cringe.</p><p>Essa takes fruit from the kitchen, and the elves there always pat her hands and smile. They have learned to accept Draco as well, although he isn't fond of that idea.</p><p>They eat peaches and grapes until his shifts are over, and his mouth is sticky sweet. At night he feels calm and relaxed despite the endless stress of the approaching OWLs, but when the sun is up again he feels the tension in every muscle of his body.</p><p>And then there's the matter of Quidditch.</p><p>Snaps has made Graham Montague the captain of the Slytherin Quidditch Team this year, and appoints Crabbe and Goyle as new Beaters early on.</p><p>Montague is relentless, working the team hard in the mornings and cramming them with Quidditch plays in the evenings. Before breakfast three times a week, Slytherin occupies the pitch, and Draco’s only saving grace is that he is a Seeker, and therefore does not have to drill the plays.</p><p>However, Montague releases a Snitch during those mornings, forcing him to focus on both dodging Bludgers and finding that damned golden ball in his drowsy state.</p><p>Occasionally he sees the new Hufflepuff Quidditch Team jogging around the school grounds in the early light, Essa at the lead and running backwards so she can urge on her teammates. Smith had made her the captain a few weeks after she’d auditioned for Seeker.</p><p>Draco, regrettably, had been studying during the Hufflepuff tryouts, but he still hears stories from Daphne and Theodore, who had been there, along with all the other shocked spectators of the Hufflepuff Quidditch Tryouts.</p><p>At the end, Essa had left her broom to flip over Summerby, her opponent for the Seeker position, sending him in such a tizzy that she’d caught the Snitch from right under his nose. Creevy had published a picture of her in the school newspaper, clutching the Snitch and giving the camera a dazzling smile.</p><p>If a copy of that picture has its own place in Draco's nightstand, who can blame him?</p><p>It is all of this combined that leads to Essa’s new reputation as the most popular witch in their year; she seems to be friends with almost everyone, and it is not just the professors that love her.</p><p>Draco is thinking about this as he changes into his night robes. Astronomy class is vile, but even worse is the fact that he has his Prefect patrols right afterwards. The nights that Essa spends with him are pleasurable, but the times that she goes to sleep instead are exhausting and long.</p><p>Draco is pleased to see that tonight is not one of those nights, but his glee doesn't last long.</p><p>“Roger Davies asked me out,” Essa tells him.</p><p>It's a fortnight before Halloween, and Draco almost spits out his grape. Together, they are perched on one of the large windows, the crescent moon outside hiding half of her expression. He shouldn’t be surprised; in fact, he’s confused that it took almost two months for someone to do something.</p><p>“The Ravenclaw Quidditch captain?” His voice cracks.</p><p>Essa nods, looking nonchalant, as if she has not just shifted his entire world on its axis. “He’s in Year Seven.”</p><p>“He is,” Draco remarks, scrutinizing her face for any emotion that might resemble joy.</p><p>Over the summer, when they'd become friends, Draco had desperately hoped for a marriage between the two of them. Unbeknownst to Essa, their parents had convened several times just to discuss the matter. </p><p>However, as soon as Father had learned of Essa’s house placement, he’d tried to call off talks of the union. Mother had interfered -- after several panicked letters from Draco himself. The union talks are temporarily, as Mother had reassuringly written to him, on hold.</p><p>However, despite the fact that Draco is no longer hesitantly betrothed, he's not a fan of Essa dating anyone else, much less Davies, who slightly resembles an ape and does not come anywhere close to deserving Essa.</p><p>“I said no to him. He wanted to eat at Madam Puddifoot's,” Essa says demurely, picking off another purple grape from the bunch. Draco’s heart starts again. “How long is there until your match against Gryffindor?”</p><p>“Almost a month,” he manages, trying to put away his curiosity.</p><p>She makes a humming sound as she leans against her side of the stone opening. Her hair might smell like apples, or it’s just his imagination; he’s not sure. It is very late.</p><p>“Slytherin is working hard?”</p><p>“Of course,” Draco says, straightening slightly. The corners of her mouth twitch up, even though she’s trying for a straight face. It’s adorable, really, the way that she never can hide a thought.</p><p>“I think you’re working hard on the plays, aren’t you?”</p><p>Draco plays along. “Of course I am. Would you like my entire playbook? I could even explain all the symbols Montague’s been using.”</p><p>He chuckles underneath his breath as she sighs, her smile disappearing.</p><p>“You thought I’d help Hufflepuff destroy my team?”</p><p>“Friends help out friends,” Essa quips, but she sounds defeated.</p><p>Draco watches her out of the corner of his eye. She is picking at her lip. “As if I would give the Hufflepuff Quidditch captain our plays.”</p><p>“It was worth a try,” Essa says, shoulders slumping slightly. “I’m worried, about the condition of our team. We’re all new! Literally every single Hufflepuff player in past seasons was in Seventh Year.”</p><p>“I remember. Diggory almost led you to victory two years ago -- last year was the Triwizard Tournament. Diggory got second in that, did you know?”</p><p>“How could I not?” Her voice lightens. “He’s our house celebrity! I heard he’s planning on attending our first match against Ravenclaw in November. I just don’t want to let him down.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Draco says, oddly uncomfortable with all the emotions she’s leaking out.</p><p>There’s nervousness, but also a strange addition of excitement that he doesn’t know how to handle, as if the mere prospect of failure in front of the entire school motivates her for some odd reason.</p><p>“Under your lead, the Hufflepuffs have never trained so hard.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“I saw you out on the pitch a few days ago, teaching your Chasers the Porskoff Ploy. Even Montague doesn’t dare attempt it.”</p><p>“Are you nervous for when we play you guys?”</p><p>“As if I would bother,” Draco scoffs, pretending that he doesn’t have nightmares of circling the pitch, eyes peeled for a Snitch that will undoubtedly be drawn to Essa as everyone and everything else is. “Besides, that is not until May.”</p><p>“Half a year is plenty of time to pick up all of the Slytherin plays.”</p><p>“That is,” he says smoothly, sliding a grape into his mouth, “if I don’t find your playbook first. What an irresponsible, unsuspecting Hufflepuff.” He smirks. “Careful, or the big bad Slytherin might come out for dinner.”</p><p>By the end of his sentence she is grinning. “I’m no Red Riding Hood.” At his blank look, she keels over, laughing wildly. “You don’t know?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Draco admits.</p><p>By this point he’s used to all the little American/muggle references she likes to make, and finds himself even starting to pick up on them.</p><p>He has only just figured out the <em>Bond, James Bond</em> reference she made the first time they had a real conversation, and even that was through reading her Muggle Studies textbook during a particular patrol when she insisted on completing her essay without his help.</p><p>He has to admit that her textbook is most interesting. At first he limits himself to only reading the sections on literature, and he finds William Shakespeare and William Wordsworth quite unusually complex for muggles.</p><p>“Why is everyone named William?” He’d asked after reading in depth about William Blake.</p><p>Essa shrugged. “Not everyone has such a distinct name as Draco. Come to think of it, your entire family has distinct names.”</p><p>He’d explained to her, then, about the tradition from Mother’s side of being named after constellations, something Essa still finds absolutely, endlessly fascinating.</p><p>“I was just named Vanessa after a family friend on my dad’s side,” Essa had told him, and he’d made a foolish mistake.</p><p>“And your father’s name?”</p><p>She hadn’t spoken for a long while afterwards, sitting in silence long enough to make him uncomfortable. There had been a look on her face, of an emotion so strong that he almost felt the depth of her pain just by watching.</p><p>“The big bad Slytherin’s going to eat your grandmother,” Essa sings, jolting him. Her expression of pure humor is at odds with his memory.</p><p>He smiles and opens his mouth to respond, but hears a noise that sounds suspiciously like a shoe scuffing on the stone floor.</p><p>Immediately his head whips to the sound; if they are caught, his Prefect status may very well be endangered. They’d chosen a hidden spot with a purpose.</p><p>“Did you hear-”</p><p>Draco nods jerkily, putting a finger up to his lips in a shushing motion. He draws his wand. “<em>Lumos</em>.”</p><p>“Relax,” Essa says. “Nobody comes here anyways.” She chews, and swallows. “The hall’s empty.”</p><p>He wants to agree and go back to their conversation, but over the past month and a half he’s been back at Hogwarts, there have been more and more instances like this occurring: he hears a noise or someone following him, but he turns around and nobody is there.</p><p>He is beginning to suspect Potter is up to something; after all, he has managed to avoid him entirely for the entire school year so far. Potter is not one to shy away from conflict.</p><p>“I know you’re there, Potter,” Draco hisses, angry. He’d listened to Essa and tried to put their truly idiotic school rivalry to rest by ignoring the Gryffindor’s existence entirely, but he will not be made a fool of again.</p><p>It is one thing to follow him during class, but to bother him in the dead of night, interrupting his measly hours with Essa, is another.</p><p>“Draco-”</p><p>He hears it then, the slight rustling of someone breathing against cloth, and immediately points his wand at the sound.</p><p>“<em>Petrificus Totalus</em>,” he mutters.</p><p>Something hits the ground hard, and Draco steps up, vaguely satisfied. He’d assumed that Potter and his friends had access to some sort of Invisibility Cloak, and is granted with the knowledge that he had been correct when the stone floor comes up in his fingers to reveal a dazed Potter.</p><p>“I thought so,” Draco says, pointing his wand down, but a cool hand clutches his wrist.</p><p>Essa frowns down at Potter. “Come on, Harry. Why are you here? You don't have patrol tonight.”</p><p>“He can’t answer-”</p><p>“It was rhetorical,” she replies, looking at him. “What are you going to do to Harry?”</p><p>“Maybe I’ll jinx him,” Draco says, scowling. He hates Potter with a fiery vengeance -- he'd been followed for absolutely no reason at all. “Although I do feel like hexing him tonight-”</p><p>“Or you could report him to McGonagall for breaking curfew. You’re a Prefect, aren’t you?”</p><p>“You’d get in trouble too,” Draco points out.</p><p>Essa shrugs. “I don’t care. I broke curfew just the same.”</p><p>“Potter,” Draco spits, viciously nudging the Gryffindor’s leg with his foot, “has been following me for quite a while. I haven’t said even a word to him and he’s been picking fights as usual.”</p><p>“Just report him-”</p><p>“As if McGonagall will do anything to him, with the Quidditch match so close.”</p><p>She frowns, and much to his disappointment, draws out her wand. It gleams white in the moonlight.</p><p>“<em>Finite Incantatem</em>,” she says softly, and Potter jerks up, grabbing at the cloth in Draco’s hand and adjusting his glasses in one swift movement.</p><p>He lifts it above his head, finding bitter delight in his height -- it's the one thing Potter will never take from him.</p><p>“What’s the matter, Potter?” he taunts. “Standing on your tiptoes won’t get you what you want?”</p><p>“Fuck you, Malfoy,” Potter spits, drawing his wand. “You know what you’ve been doing.”</p><p>“Oh, do enlighten me,” Draco replies, pointing his wand at the Gryffindor.</p><p>“Your family’s been hunting down the families of muggleborns here at Hogwarts,” Potter spits, eyes darting to Essa. “You haven’t told her, have you?”</p><p>For a moment Draco pauses in shock. “You’re lying,” he says. He hasn’t heard a thing about muggle families in danger, and Father would never waste the Malfoy fortune on something so trivial.</p><p>Potter studies him, and steps back. The ugly look in his eyes is gone, and although he does not lower his wand, Draco knows that he has won his trust at least on this matter.</p><p>“You really don’t know?”</p><p>“My family does not approve of muggles, but we do not waste our time with them,” Draco admits, allowing himself to look at Essa. She is staring back at him, face pale and wand dangling limply in her fingers. At his words, she startles.</p><p>He has never felt shame in his beliefs, but under the disapproving look in her eyes, he turns back to Potter, uncomfortable.</p><p>“That’s why you’ve been following me, then? Over some half-baked thoughts?” Potter nods, wordless, and looks slightly uneasy. Draco scoffs, taking advantage of it. “Gryffindor pride, once again demonstrated. I ought to hex you into our Quidditch match.”</p><p>He opens his mouth, his mind focusing on a most lovely hex, but Essa speaks for the first time since Potter’s accusation.</p><p>“What are you saying about the muggleborn families?”</p><p>“Chances are, he's bluffing,” Draco says, studying Potter closely.</p><p>Potter keeps his face blank, but the tenseness in his body is prominent. “Don't worry about it, Essa.”</p><p>“They're just rumors, aren't they? Heard from your Mudblood excuse of a mother?”</p><p>Potter’s face goes murderous, but Essa steps forward.</p><p>“There is nothing wrong with being muggleborn.”</p><p>“I know where you stand on the matter,” Draco says tersely, ignoring the way Potter’s eyes dart between Essa and him. “And you can say the same of me.”</p><p>“Draco, can’t you just let Harry go?”</p><p>He pauses, slightly furious. “So he can follow me for weeks and you let me won’t do anything to him?”</p><p>“He’s wasted his own time and energy based on a factless assumption, and you used a slur at his mother,” Essa points out. “Besides, Harry won’t do it again, right?”</p><p>She and Potter share a look, and Draco suddenly remembers that they are friends as well. He wants to hex something badly.</p><p>“I won’t follow you unless you give me another reason to,” Potter says, looking defiantly at Draco, who looks back with the sensation that someone is burning his organs. He wants to strangle something.</p><p>“Fine,” Draco replies, lowering his wand. He knows when he cannot win a battle. “But I’m giving the cloak to Professor Snape.”</p><p>Potter’s eyes widen. “It’s not yours to give.”</p><p>“I wasn't yours to follow.”</p><p>“I wasn't aware that you needed one’s permission to follow him. You'd think that it would defeat the purpose.”</p><p>Draco snarls, tightening the grip on his wand, but Essa steps forward.</p><p>“Give the cloak back,” Essa says softly, and her eyes are large and a little bit afraid -- maybe of him. The thought makes him less inclined to Potter. “He won't do it again.”</p><p>Draco hates himself for giving in to her, especially in front of Potter. He wants to protest, but either way he will lose something -- it's his pride, or her friendship.</p><p>Potter catches the cloak, eyebrows shooting up as he looks back and forth between Draco and Essa again.</p><p>“We’re done here,” Draco sneers. “One more time, and I won't bother with hexes. I’ll kill you, Potter.”</p><p>The threat feels good, like it's been burning up his throat the entire argument, and spitting it up relieves him.</p><p>Essa’s gasp feels less good, but the look on Potter’s face makes up for it. He can tell, like Essa, that Draco means every word.</p><p>He stalks away, brimming with fury and determination, trying to ignore the way Essa’s gaze bores into his back like fire.</p>
