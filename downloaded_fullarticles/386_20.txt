    <p>Pansy swallowed as she read the results of the paternity charm, hidden in the lavatory of a high-end restaurant just off Diagon Alley where she'd gone with Daphne. It was just an excuse to get away from Parkinson Place, really, but Daph knew that and had her back. Pansy had made the mistake of confirming that she was pregnant at home and the dratted elves had immediately reported it to her mother.</p><p>Mother had insisted that she go to Great Aunt Violet's to hide the shame of her unwed pregnancy. They'd spoken with Pansy's great aunt over the floo to arrange the trip, and she'd promised to set up some sort of magic that would somehow make the trip less suspicious. </p><p>"It's sex magic," Great Aunt Violet had told her mother. "The girl will have to bring along the father."</p><p>Pansy's mother's face had soured. "Clearly the girl has no qualms about intercourse. We'll arrive in two weeks."</p><p>Pansy had shrunken back, mortified to have her mistake discussed in front of her as though she wasn't there. <em>The girl.</em> Her mother had treated her indulgently, before.</p><p>That was what led Pansy here, two days later, to the restroom of The Platinum Sphinx. While she could easily pinpoint <em>when</em> she'd become pregnant, identifying the father was harder. There had been a party, and copious alcohol. Certainly, a contraceptive charm could have gone awry, but Pansy had slept with a few different people that night. At least they were all pureblood.</p><p>Blaise. Pansy was alright with that. Blaise was attractive and charming, even when they were completely sober. She just hoped that he wouldn't make too much fuss. Pansy snorted at that thought. Blaise was charming, yes, because it got him laid. She would be asking him to go somewhere secluded with her and perform sex magic, which naturally included <em>sex.</em> Getting him on board would not be a problem. </p><p> </p><p>"You'll have use of the guest cottage," Violet Brown told the young couple. "I'll not disturb you. Merlin knows I know plenty about your <em>activities </em>knowing you managed to get pregnant. Totty will handle anything you need. My personal healer is on call and Totty can reach her." Violet cast a look towards Pansy's mother. "Her privacy oaths are extremely stringent. She'll not breathe a word of this."</p><p>They went into the cottage. It was small, but well-appointed. It wouldn't do, after all, to have insufficient guest accommodations. "The bed is in a ritual circle," Violet continued explaining. "One orgasm within the circle will progress the pregnancy by one week."</p><p>Without a word further, before Pansy could even process what she'd said, Violet left Pansy, her mother, and Blaise alone. Her mother turned the same sour look on Pansy that she'd been getting for weeks. "I'll return for you and the spawn in thirty days. Handle it prior to that date."</p><p>They said a perfunctory goodbye, and Pansy's mother apparated away.</p><p>Blaise snorted. "Thirty days? I pity your mother her marriage bed if she thinks it'll take that long. We're nineteen, and I'm <em>Italian.</em>"</p><p>"That's exactly one orgasm per day," Pansy said ruefully. "The party was already ten weeks ago. Having sex every day probably seems quite decadent to her - and Merlin knows a <em>witch</em> can't expect to come."</p><p>Blaise snorted again.</p><p> </p><p>It had been three days since they'd arrived at the guest cottage, and Pansy was thirty-one weeks gone. She was laid out on her back with Blaise's head between her legs, and they were working on the fifth orgasm of the day. Pansy's belly stood up proudly, larger than a quaffle. She could no longer see her lover in this position, but she could feel him as he worked his fingers in and out of her cunt, which he'd already filled with his come twice today, and circled her clit with his tongue. Pansy shrieked, and Blaise sat back on his heels with a smug grin.</p><p>The aftershocks of Pansy's orgasm were suddenly replaced by a growing discomfort, and she keened as they both watched her belly noticeably inflate.  The difference was significant, packed onto her petite frame so quickly. It was like she'd been hit with some obscene engorgement charm.</p><p>"Thirty-two weeks," Blaise said, his voice thick with lust. Pansy had realized very quickly that Blaise found the sudden swell of her body incredibly erotic. She had to admit that the experience was doing something for her too, at this point. She'd always liked a little pain with her pleasure - biting, scratching, yanking on hair, even being smacked around a bit if her partner did it right. This new experience had taken some getting used to, but it had grown on her as her belly did.</p><p>"Mercy," Pansy begged. It was only two o'clock. The day was far from over and she was exhausted. </p><p>"But Pansy," Blaise mock-whined. His arm dropped below the crest of her belly and he shifted into her view to show that his sizable cock was hard again.</p><p>Normally she wouldn't let him get away with it. It wasn't her problem he was hard, for Merlin's sake. She was enjoying herself, though, despite her exhaustion, and Blaise was an excellent lover. "Fine, but then we're done for the rest of the day."</p><p>Blaise smirked, and slid his cock into her in a single glide. Pansy moaned, then tried to think of something un-sexy. For once, she didn't want to come while he fucked her.</p><p>His strokes were smooth and powerful, each one hitting all the right spots as Pansy tried desperately not to fall over the edge. With a gentle pressure, he massaged the overly tight skin of her abdomen. It was littered with stretch marks - it was unsightly, but Blaise traced each one like a treasure map. More evidence of the obscenely rapid growth she'd undergone in just seventy-two hours. He repeatedly reached for her clit, habitually looking to pleasure his partner, but she batted his hand away each time.</p><p>"If I let you have your way," she growled the third time, "I'd be giving birth tonight. I am <em>not </em>progressing through this entire pregnancy in <em>three days</em>, Blaise."</p><p>Blaise smirked at her, thrusting faster. "No, four days is plenty fast enough."</p><p>An involuntary moan cut off any reply Pansy might have made, but she knew he was right. They'd certainly come seven times between them tomorrow. All there was to do in this cottage was fuck, after all.</p><p>Blaise's pace picked up again briefly before stuttering, and Pansy braced herself as his hot semen flooded her for the third time that day. His cock was still hard inside her when she swelled larger again. Her belly grew by at least an inch in seconds, accompanied this time by a larger-than-anticipated amount of growth in her breasts. Her chest had been expanding gradually, but not to such a degree. They began leaking, and Pansy realized suddenly that she'd just gained a week's worth of milk.</p><p>"Fuck," Pansy groaned. It wasn't day-ruining, but it was definitely uncomfortable.</p><p>"Fuck," Blaise murmured, eyes transfixed, his pupils blown wide.</p><p>She rubbed at her swollen tits. "Blaise. Please, it hurts."</p><p>He blinked. "What should I do about it?"</p><p>"<em>Anything</em>," she moaned.</p><p>Blaise blinked again, shrugged, and pulled his softening cock from her body. He started to move, and Pansy almost thought he was going to leave here like this.</p><p>Instead, he moved to the side of her body and helped her to sit up. (The change in her body mass was so extreme that Pansy needed help for every simple task. She'd been walking with a book balanced on her head since the age of four, but now if she tried to stand up on her own she risked falling on her face. It was embarrassing, but also stoked the flames of her arousal. She was massive, and clumsy, and almost entirely dependent on the wizard who had made her that way.) Without another word, Blaise latched his mouth onto her swollen nipple and began to suck.</p><p>It took him a bit to get it right, and to actually draw out any milk. Once he did, though, the relief was dramatic and Pansy moaned gratefully. Before long she was urging him to switch sides and reduce the other in the same way, and it was once he did that Pansy realized she had another problem.</p><p>The orgasm she'd managed to only just stave off was still building. Typically, her nipples alone would never get her off. Combined with the relief, however, and the barely thwarted orgasm while he'd had his cock in her,  and she was fucked. Pansy cried out as she came, and for the third time in under an hour her belly began to swell. Blaise moaned as it pressed firmly against him.</p><p>"Thirty-four," Pansy mumbled as she urged Blaise to continue sucking. The additional week had ballooned her breasts again, and she'd be damned if she ended this <em>situation </em>still uncomfortable. "If you get hard again, you're sitting in a corner outside of the damn ritual circle while you toss off."</p><p> </p><p>Pansy waddled across the cottage, holding the wall for balance with one hand while the other attempted to support her massive belly. It was eleven in the morning, their fourth day in the cottage, and Pansy was thirty-nine weeks pregnant. Her magic would ensure a timely birth, which meant the next time one of them came within the circle, she'd go into labour. There were a few things she wanted to do first, Pansy had insisted, and <em>no they couldn't wait until after</em>. Blaise had offered to help, but in reality Pansy was just putting it off.</p><p>It wasn't that she was nervous. There were a full complement of spells to ease the process and she knew to expect to be fully healed hours after beginning labour with almost no pain. Her tits, swollen with milk that she'd not had Blaise drain for fear of coming, probably hurt more.</p><p>In reality, she was enjoying being pregnant. Quite a lot. She had found the ritual as erotic as Blaise had in the end. More than once in the last few days she'd had an orgasm that was triggered by the previous one's results. The dramatic changes in her body were exciting. Once more orgasm, and it would be over. She would no longer be pregnant.</p><p>Plus, Pansy knew that Blaise was hard as a rock watching her struggle with her sudden girth. The fact that he'd first knocked her up, then been the driving force behind the twenty-nine orgasms that had left her huge and stumbling, had the wizard incredibly smug. She could indulge him with a show. Getting him worked up could only make the sex they were about to have even more intense.</p><p> </p><p>"We could do it again," Blaise said as Pansy ran a hand along her flattened abdomen.</p><p>She looked up guiltily. "What?"</p><p>"It's only been a few hours and you miss it," he said baldly, not even bothering to dissemble like a proper Slytherin. "I miss it, too. It only took us four days, and we're here for another <em>twenty-six. </em>What's stopping us doing it again?"</p><p>Pansy was horribly tempted. "What if we don't manage to get me pregnant again fast enough, and I'm still knocked up when my mother comes back?"</p><p>"There are spells," Blaise said with a dismissive wave. "To assist. They aren't as effective as potions, but since we're both clearly fertile on our own they'd be plenty to ensure a quick conception."</p><p>Pansy thought of the tight burn of suddenly stretching skin, of the heady relief when Blaise drained a week's milk from her engorged tits. Of the lust in his eyes as she grew and <em>grew</em>, and the extra sensitivity she'd experienced.  "Do you know the spells?"</p><p>Blaise immediately cast spells to enhance both their fertility, as well as a lust charm on himself to help him stay hard. Pansy wasn't even going to ask why he'd learned them. Just twelve hours later, when Pansy felt the rush of magic following an orgasm that meant she was now one full week pregnant, it was ecstasy. There was no noticeable swell or pain - it would take a few weeks for that to start - but there was a promise. Soon she could be huge again.</p><p>Pansy grinned at Blaise, eyes dark with excitement. "How quickly do you think we can manage it?"</p><p>"You say that like you don't think I could get you to have this baby tonight."</p><p>She looked at him and saw lust and pride in his eyes, and raised her chin in a challenge. "Try."</p><p>Blaise cast a pleasure enhancing charm on her, and the first brush of his fingers against her clit had her coming. She'd used these before, and she knew that further orgasms wouldn't come quite that quickly, but that any pleasurable sensation would be magnified threefold until the spell was cancelled. Distantly, she thought this might be cheating, but it felt far too good for her to care. Next time, she might make him do without.</p><p>Blaise's grin was like a shark's as he ground his cock against her sex. "That's two."</p>
