    <p>There he was, standing in front of his house in anticipation. He knew she would apparate at any second now and he wanted nothing more than to be the first to welcome her. They've been back home from Hogwarts for two weeks now, summer had barely started and he longed for this moment; she would come early, way earlier than Harry, and he couldn't stop himself from smiling at the possibility of spending more time with her.</p><p>After everything that happened that last year, he just couldn't deny anymore... Hermione was anything but <em>just </em>a friend to him. It was tough, but it's become much easier to admit - even if just to himself, for now - that whatever the Lavender fiasco was, it was just a response out of jealousy to Hermione kissing Viktor years ago. Yes, he was very much aware of how pathetic of an excuse that was.</p><p>As difficult as that coming year would be - with he, Hermione and Harry leaving for the horcrux hunt -, he was determined to play his part well. Above anything, Harry needed this. Harry needed them. And he knew how much love he felt for his friends. Harry was a brother to him, and he'd do just about anything to help him on that mission. He also knew that having Hermione with them would be like a jolt of energy. Beyond that obviously brilliant mind of hers, she was necessary. Her presence was necessary to keep him... Alive. He just knew that.</p><p>So, there he was, waiting to have her at his house and take all the time he could have with her. That had to be it. That had to be special, because he knew they were going towards the unknown of a battle, and if that didn't give a guy a sense of urgency, nothing would.</p><p>And as if she was sharing that thought with him, he heard the familiar <em>crack</em> that meant that someone had just arrived magically. He turned his head to his right side and there she was. She had to be feeling something very familiar to what he was conjecturing about, because he didn't even had the chance to say anything when she runned to him and pulled her arms around his neck. That hug was like no other. She was showing something to him, and he kinda knew exactly what it was. Holding her firmly against him, he tried to show her that whatever that was, he felt it too.</p><p>- I'm so glad you're finally here. You have no idea how anxious I got just about two minutes ago. You're safe. - he said still holding her.</p><p>- I know exactly what you mean. I couldn't stop thinking about you... About everyone here at the Burrow. I kinda thought I couldn't wait until the time we negotiated with The Order for my arrival. - she said, arms still around his neck, on an embrace so intimate that a part of her brain was screaming at her, embarrassed on the neediness she was letting him see, but she really couldn't care less; he was there, alive, well and responding just as enthusiastically as her.</p><p>- How are you? All things considered... - he asked, slowly letting her go, but keeping his arms at her shoulders.</p><p>- I'm ok. I really did it. For a moment, I didn't think I would. But I didn't have much of a choice, did I? - she asked, sadness right there in her voice.</p><p>- No, you didn't. And I'm proud of you. I know that couldn't possibly have been any easier. But you know you did the right thing, yeah? They'll be safe now. - he delicately took her face in his hands - You did the exact right thing, Hermione. -</p><p>Her eyes watered, and he knew that it wasn't for the first time that day. After all, she did sent her parents away, not even remembering they've had a daughter all this time. But he knew, and thankfully she did too, that it was the best for the moment. She did that to keep them safe and, in the end, it would all be worth it.</p><p>He wiped her tears away and pulled her for another hug, which made her feel comforted and... <em>Loved</em>? Was that the feeling? She really felt like nothing could hit her right then and there, protected in his arms, but she couldn't stop the warmth growing on her cheeks as she let that word sink in her mind. Loved. She felt loved.</p><p>When he let her go for the second time since she got there, he looked for her baggage and found nothing. She didn't bring anything but a beaded bag crossed around her shoulders. That couldn't be right.</p><p>- You couldn't have forgotten your baggage, could you? - he asked, mildly joking.</p><p>- You know I could never! I brought everything I need. - she said, smiling softly and patting the beaded bag she carried around her. At the moment, he thought she might be a little delusional, but let her explain nevertheless - Undetectable extension charm. All my clothes, money, books and personal belongings are right here. Impressive, huh? -</p><p>He couldn't believe what he was seeing, but again, that <em>was </em>Hermione Granger, the girl who got every enchantment right from her very first try.</p><p>- That's bloody wicked! You really have a way with that. - he said, cheering her up, saying nothing but the truth.</p><p>- Thanks, Ron. - she said, genuinely smiling this time - So... How are you? You said you were anxious?</p><p>- I'm fine. Considering You-Know-Who haven't tried to bloody kill me yet, it's safe to say I could be worse. But, yeah, I felt a little uneven just before you got here. Don't know, I guess my mind wandered on everything bad that could happen before you got here safely. - he confessed - I wish I was there with you. Even tried to convince Mad-Eye to let me go, but he was unbearably emphatic on saying no. </p><p>- And he has a point, you know. Of course I'd be much more relieved if you were there with me, but we couldn't take that risk. I don't have the tracker anymore, but you still have yours for a couple of weeks. - she said, with that tone of seriousness she always had when scolding him or Harry.</p><p>- I know he does. But the question is: would I have stayed here if he said I could go to yours? We all know the answer. - he said, smirking a little - Besides, there's nothing for me to do here other than help with the wedding preparations, and you and I both know that I'm not taking any pleasure on that. Would very much trade that for putting my life at a little risk to get to scort you back here. </p><p>She smiled widely, even though she shrieked a little at the mention of him risking his life.</p><p>- I don't even doubt that. But really, I'm ok. And now that I'm here, let's go find your mum. Bet she'll put me on loads of tasks to stop us from planning our scape. - she said, laughing humourlessly.</p><p>- Oh, yeah, that's good of you to know that. Brace yourself, she's really barking about this bloody wedding. Fleur's parents are about to come early, too, so she's making us all slave ourselves around the house. Pretty revolting, I'm telling you. </p><p>She laughed and followed him to the house. </p><p>A few hours passed by and he was not kidding about his mum fixation on getting the house ready for the Delacours. He didn't think he could get another gnome out of that yard, that just couldn't be possible; he felt like he'd been doing that for ages now.</p><p>On that thought, he saw Hermione coming out of the front door, looking for something. When her eyes met him, she waved for him to get there.</p><p>- Mrs. Weasley said the supper's ready. Let's go. - she said, taking his hand and leading him inside. He felt embarrassed on how bloody happy that made him feel. She was just taking his hand, for fuck's sake.</p><p>Dinner went on surprisingly calm. Everyone was happy that Hermione got there safely. With that, they had one less dear person to worry about, and that was saying a lot these days. When people started to leave the table, he heard his mum telling Hermione she wouldn't have to share Ginny's room anymore. Once Fred and George were gone, living on the little flat above the shop, she could take their room. </p><p>- Ron, can you help her get settled, dear? - asked Mrs. Weasley. He gladly got up and waited for her at the stairs.</p><p>- You're not the only guest owning a whole room for yourself, you know? Harry's getting Percy's old room too. - he said.</p><p>- So your mum's finally accepting that he's not coming back, huh? That had to be tough. - she said, smiling sadly.</p><p>- Yeah. It took her a while, but she's not stupid. She knows he's a goner, that fucking jerk. </p><p>- Language, Ron. - she said, hitting him playfully on his arm.</p><p>- You know what, we're about to spend a lot of time together during our hunt. You won't be able to reprimand me every single time I swear, you know? So get<em> fucking</em> used to it. - he said, with the unnecessary emphasis on the cursing, making her smirk a bit.</p><p>- I'm afraid you're right. The crazy thing is I don't really care about the swearing. I only do it to annoy you. - she showed him her tongue.</p><p>- Do you, now? You little minx! That's good information, though. I'll keep that in mind next time I feel guilty for pushing your buttons. </p><p>With that, they got to Fred and George's old room. He opened the door for her and put her little bag on the nightstand next to the bed. He still was amazed at how many things was inside that bloody bag. What an amazing witch she was!</p><p>She sat on the bed and he, by the window. They stared at each other for a brief second, until he decided to speak.</p><p>- Hey, I need to tell you something. - he started, suddenly feeling very aware that they were alone, in a room many, <em>many </em>floors above the others - I kinda built the courage the last few days and I don't think I can wait. - she was really surprised at that sudden need for expression coming from him, but nevertheless excited. He was looking different, wasn't he? So comfortable touching her, eager to be around, being incredibly thoughtful, so nice to her... Did he really grew up that much, emotionally? She was trembling a little.</p><p>- What is it, Ron? </p><p>- I just need to tell you that... I'm glad you're here. I'm glad to be back in your life. You have no idea how much I've missed you last year. And I'm <em>so </em>sorry for last year. I really had no need to be with Lavender that way, and even though I know you and I had always be just friends, that's only because it took me so many years to realize that that wasn't <em>exactly </em>what we should be... - he poured all that, hardly breathing, but it was like he couldn't control his words anymore. He needed to tell her everything. It was now or never - I know I haven't really prepared you for this speech, but I don't think I can control this any longer. - with that, he stood up and sat on the floor, in front of her - The way I feel about you, Hermione, I have never felt for anyone. Ever. I don't care about me, my safety, my bloody life... When I think about danger, my mind only goes to you. All I care about is you. </p><p>She was speechless. There he was, the boy she had always fancied, telling her he fancied her back! She couldn't believe it. That just could not be true.</p><p>"Ever since fourth year, when you showed up to the Yule Ball with fucking Viktor Krum, I knew it just wasn't normal how I felt. No one feels that angry because a friend gets a bloody date to a party, yeah? But I did. Merlin knows how bad I wanted to smash his fucking face for having the guts to do what I didn't. - he laughed nervously, which she found ever so endearing. She was biting her bottom lip to stop her from smiling widely like a lunatic - What I'm saying is that I'm in love with you, Hermione. And I'm sorry for being such a pain in the ass all these years. I've been in love with you for so long. I don't think I've ever wanted to be just your friend. Ever. - he laughed again.</p><p>She then got up the bed, took his hands on hers and pulled him up. Took his face on her hands and tried to stop herself from crying tears of happiness.</p><p>- I can't believe you're doing this... - she laughed - You know I've been in love with you since forever, don't you? I can't believe how long we've fought this. How could we be so stupid for so long? - she was now laughing out loud. He laughed with her, his arms wrapped around her waist - You're all I ever think about, Ron. You've always been my favorite guy in the whole world, even when we were being insufferable with each other. - she couldn't stop her lips from smiling - I'm in love with you too, Ron. Always have.</p><p>With that, he closed the space between them, lowering his head towards hers, while she got on her tiptoes. And then, they were kissing. His arms were on her waist, trying to keep her as close as he could, and her hands were wrapped firmily around his neck. His lips were firm, but gentle, and when she parted her lips, his tongue happily found hers, battling for dominance in a dance he knew it too well. Only this time, it was with <em>her. </em>Everything was just perfect.</p><p>Again, he became really, <em>really</em> aware that they were alone in a bedroom, with no interferences. His body seemed to know that too, once his pants became to feel a little too tight. Hermione was completely conscious about his <em>situation</em>, but if she felt offended by it, she did not show at all. She was pressing herself against him, feeling the same urgency to be close to him.</p><p>When they parted their lips, both panting, out of their breaths, she was the one to speak first.</p><p>-I'm really glad I decided to come early. - she smirked - I'm so crazy about you, Ron. You drive me crazy.</p><p>- That has to be on your top three of best ideas indeed. - he smirked back at her - You can't even imagine the effect you have on me, Hermione. You're too fucking beautiful. - She blushed with that.</p><p>And they were kissing again, just as frantic as before, but his hands explored her neck and back a little more, tenderness and need mixed up together, while she held one hand on his face and the other on his hair, giving him full access on her body.</p><p>But then they heard footsteps and parted, feeling a little startled, but pretending to be engaged on a simple conversation about potions when Ginny opened the door to say Mr. Weasley needed Ron's help to open the tent on the yard.</p><p>With that, he said goodnight to Hermione and winked at her, making her blush and smirk in a way she had never done before, to anyone. Ginny saw that and looked really surprised, but decided not to approach that immediately. Let them feel that rush for now. She'd torment Hermione later for answers. Ginny said her goodnight, throwing her a knowing look, and closed the door, going to her room.</p><p>Hermione stood there just processing everything that's happened that night. She was not able to stop herself from giggling like a schoolgirl. She and Ron. She and Ron! They had finally admitted their feelings. They had just <em>kissed </em>in that very room. She was thinking about his lips and how she loved the height difference between them while she changed into her pyjamas. She didn't think she'd get any sleep that night. Ron Weasley was all she was able to think about, she thought smiling to herself.</p>
