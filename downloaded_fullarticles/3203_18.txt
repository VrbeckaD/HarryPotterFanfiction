    <p align="justify">At the southern part of Ottery St Catchpole two elegant figures was standing in the middle of a vacant lot. Of course in the Muggle eyes it was just a vacant lot, stretching far wide with nothing but grass and the occasional trees but in the two figures eyes there were a house standing at the front of them, a cottage to be exact , a cottage famously called the <em>Granger-Malfoy Cottage. </em></p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify"><em>“This house is small”</em> said the man with long pale blonde hair as he examines the cottage and its surrounding.</p><p align="justify"><em>“I think its cosy”</em> said the woman positively, excitement written all over her old yet beautiful face.</p><p align="justify">The man scoffs at his wife’s enthusiasm<em> “It’s barely the size of our left wing Cissy” </em></p><p align="justify"><em>“Lucius! You promise me you will behave!” </em>retorted Narcissa Malfoy</p><p align="justify"><em>“Cissy, I’m just stating the fact, how did they even fit their five children in this cottage makes me wonder” </em>Lucius countered</p><p align="justify"><em>“Well I don’t care how small their house is; I just wanted to meet my grandchildren” </em>said Narcissa as she pulled his husband of many years towards the front door of the house.</p><p align="justify">It’s been fifteen years since they last saw him, their son, <em>Draco. </em>One year after the war, Draco came up to them at Christmas Eve and tried to introduce his girlfriend at that time, <em>Hermione Granger. </em>Of course being who they were, Lucius and Narcissa were opposed to the idea of their only son being with a muggleborn. Even if they already realized that all of You-Know-Who’s ideologies were complete and utter bullocks, years of believing in Pureblood supremacy from their parents and family is still rooted within them. Lucius and Draco fought that night, one step away from hexing each other.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“How dare you taint our blood with someone like her?”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Someone like her? And what exactly is wrong with her father? She’s everything that a wizard can ask for a witch!”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“She’s Mud..Muggleborn! Draco!” </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Have you not learnt anything from the war father? All of this Pureblood crap the you’ve been telling me since I was a child were bullshit!”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“How dare you say that  in front of me! Is that what have you been learning from your new friends? Is the Black and Malfoy Pureblood line doesn’t mean anything to you now? The Noble House of Black and Malfoy hold their ranks within the Sacred Twenty Eight from hundreds of years and you are willing to throw that a way for just a girl?”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“You don’t understand father, she’s not just a girl, she’s Hermione Granger and she’s the one I love”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Well then if you’re so sure of her perhaps you need to forget that you ever have a family”</em>
</p><p align="justify"> That was the last time Draco had ever set foot in the Malfoy Manor. A year later, Draco send an invitation to his and Hermione’s wedding but Lucius just set the invite on fire and muttered <em>“I don’t have a son”. </em>Six months after their wedding, the Daily Prophet issued front page news about them</p><p align="justify">“<strong><em>War Heroine Hermione Granger-Malfoy and Reformed Death Eater Draco Malfoy to welcome their first child”</em></strong></p><p align="justify">Narcissa was ecstatic to hear the news; <em>her only son is going to be a father </em>but then as soon as the happiness come it quickly disappears as reality hit her.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>It means her grandchild will be a Half-blood, what will Lucius thinks when he hears the news?</em>
</p><p align="justify">Lucius reaction was exactly what she was expecting. He was furious and he released all of his anger with their poor house elves. He gave direct orders that any news about Draco Malfoy or Hermione Granger must be immediately burn and must not pass up to his breakfast table.  That was the last time Narcissa had read any news about her son. She didn’t even know that they already have five children now if it wasn’t for an unexpected encounter with Blaise Zabini, his son’s best friend.</p><p align="justify">She remembers clearly, that Sunday afternoon, she and Lucius went at Madam Malkin’s for a set of new robes when they stumble upon Blaise with three kids in tow. The little boy with olive skin and dark hair they knew, as Blaise’s son, Alexander Zabini but the other two boys who seemingly are twins based on their clothes were unfamiliar to them. When Blaise and the children went to approached them and they had a good look at them, they already knew who exactly those two are, with those pale blond hairs and stunningly grey eyes they surely inherited from their father.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>They were their grandchildren.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Leo and Asterion Granger-Malfoy were their names said Blaise. They were born five years after Casssiopea Narcissa Granger-Malfoy, Draco and Hermione’s second child and only daughter. The news that they had a daughter was more of a shock to them because it had been years since a daughter was born in the Malfoy line and secretly Narcissa was delighted that they name their daughter after her.</p><p align="justify">Their first born was name Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy who was now fourteen and was sorted into Syltherin much to Draco’s pleasure and secretly to their pleasure as well. Cassie as what they called their daughter was born 2 years after Scorpius and was also sorted into Syltherin.  Leo and Asterion just turn five and was the spitting image of their father at their age. They inherited their father pale blond hair and grey eyes. Even the paleness of their skin and their pointed faces was copied from their father. The youngest of their children, Altair Lucius Granger-Malfoy was just one year and half according to Blaise. By the time they went back to the Manor they were both silent and went into two separate directions. Lucius went directly to his study and Narcissa to Draco’s old room.</p><p align="justify"> The first five years of Draco’s leaving Lucius was full of anger and resentment towards his son and her wife Hermione Granger. He was angry at Draco for following his so called <em>“love”</em> for Hermione and abandoning all of his teachings for that girl and he was angry at Hermione Granger for taking away his only son. As the years went by Lucius got tired of being angry and was slowly getting used to spending his holidays with his wife, Narcissa and the house elves in the manor.</p><p align="justify">Occasionally he would meet the children of Draco’s old classmates from Hogwarts like Blaise Zabini’s two sons Pierre thirteen years old and Alexander five years old. He also had the chance to meet Theodore Nott and Pansy Nott nee’ Parkinsons only son Louis Anton who was ten and will be attending Durmstrang next year but Draco’s children , he haven’t met any of them, well except for the twins he met earlier, <em>Leo and Asterion</em>. Both were very inquisitive for their age just like Draco when he was five. He remembers fondly when Draco was their age, and they visit his friend Severus at Hogwarts, the moment Draco saw the castle he was instantly mesmerized by it and soon a barrage of questions was thrown in his way.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Father what is that?”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Hogwarts? What is that? </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Why is uncle Sev here?</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“What is Potions?</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Can I go here to?</em>
</p><p align="justify">Even Severus at that time ran out of answers to his unending questions.</p><p align="justify">Leo and Asterion, and then there is Scorpious and Cassiopea. Scorpious Hyperion , Blaise said that he was very smart and was almost sorted to Ravenclaw in his first year, Cassiopea their only daughter and the only daughter born in the Noble House of Malfoy for many years. According to Blaise, Cassiopea looks exactly like her mother but with long straight blonde hair and grey eyes. The youngest son, Altair Lucius,<em> Lucius,</em> he was name after him, was a combination of his parents curious and talkative and what Blaise said their little explorer.</p><p align="justify"><em>Five grandchildren, Merlin had it been that long?</em> <em>Was he missing the most important part of his and Narcissa’s life? But they’re Half Bloods, Does it matter anymore?</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="justify">He was pulled out from his reverie by his wife Narcissa as she came into the study crying.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><em>“I can’t take it anymore Lucius! I cannot spend another Christmas or a Holiday without our son or letting another opportunity to pass without meeting our grand children!” </em>Narcissa said as she paced in front of Lucius. Lucius sighs his wife is right, before he was content on spending their holidays with just Narcissa in the Manor but now when they had met two of their grandchildren he would be hypocrite to say that he wasn’t affected. Seeing those mini Draco’s and interacting with them even for a short period of time makes him realize one thing <em>He misses Draco. </em>How can he forget the most important thing in the world, it was not Pureblood but <em>Blood , your own blood, Family. </em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And so here they were standing at the front of the Granger-Malfoy Cottage with the help of Blaise Zabini, days before Christmas. With little hesitation Narcissa pointed her wand at the door and said the incantation.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“I promised no harm will come or bare any ill will against the family that live here nor the generations that will come next”</em>
</p><p align="justify">The tip of Narcissa’s wand started to light a little and spreads little by little throughout the door. After a moment Lucius watch as the light that quickly came out of her wife’s wand came back again at the tip of the wand as if nothing happened.</p><p align="justify"><em>“Do you think it work?” </em>Narcissa ask sceptically but before Lucius could react they both heard a rustling of feet inside and then the door opens slowly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“<em>Hello!” </em></p>
