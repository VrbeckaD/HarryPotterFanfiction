    <p>“Must I <em>seriously </em>go through with this?” Harry complained not for the first time. His father merely gave him a look.</p>
<p>“Need I remind you, my darling son, that we are in desperate need of this union. The Malfoy’s have more money than God, so… yes, you <em>must </em>go through with this.”</p>
<p>“But they’re practically royalty. Surely they could have <em>anyone </em>they wanted.”</p>
<p>“Our family has significant land holdings, it’s a mutually beneficial arrangement for all parties.”</p>
<p>“Save me, since he’s probably some spoiled ponce with three brain cells to his name.”</p>
<p>“I’m told he speaks three languages. And regardless you’re going to be a gentleman at dinner,” James informed him, fixing his tie. Harry rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes father,” he said angrily, as he followed the man downstairs to greet their guests. Harry tried to look considerably less perturbed as he waited by the door. A few moments later, the doorman, Dobson, opened the door to reveal the single most beautiful blond Harry had ever seen.</p>
<p>“Mister Potter, we wish to present you our son, Draco Malfoy,” Lucius said, as he gestured to the long-haired blond before him. Harry’s eyes widened. <em>Holy shite was I wrong, </em>Harry thought as he bowed, taking the blond’s hand to kiss it. Draco looked terribly bored.</p>
<p>“A pleasure, I’m sure,” Draco replied, and fuck if his voice wasn’t melodically beautiful.</p>
<p>“The pleasure is all mine,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Steady on lad,” James whispered, escorting the Malfoy’s into the drawing room. Harry held out his arm for Draco who merely eyed him, before curling his arm into Harry’s. It was all Harry could do not to leap with joy, as the two followed their parents into the sitting room.</p>
<p>“So…erm,” Harry floundered trying to come up with some form of conversation. “Father said you speak three languages?”</p>
<p>“Six actually,” Draco replied.</p>
<p>“That’s impressive,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“I suppose,” Draco said with a shrug, his eyes following the Malfoy footman as he made his way past.</p>
<p>“Erm… what do you like to do for fun?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Get buggered by stable boys,” Draco said matter-of-factly, much to Harry’s immense surprise. Harry stared dumbstruck as Draco made his way into the parlor picking up a glass of wine from Dobson as he stood outside the door before he slipped inside without Harry.</p>
<p>“He seems like a handful,” Dobson said.</p>
<p>Harry sighed, taking a glass of wine for good measure, before he followed Draco inside, to find him chatting up the footman as he stood in the corner. Harry sighed, knocking back his wine before he snuck over to them.</p>
<p>“I understand you’re probably not thrilled about this,” Harry said trying to keep his voice low.</p>
<p>“Do <em>not </em>presume to know how I feel about any of this,” Draco hissed. “Gods, father went <em>on, and on, </em>about the noble House of Potter and just <em>how </em>important all of this,” he gestured wildly with his wine glass. “Is,” Draco glared stepping closer to Harry then. “I <em>hate </em>this fucking world. Do you know how fucking bored I am with all the trappings of this godforsaken bullshit? So no Mr. Potter. I’m not thrilled. I’d rather marry some commoner who could properly bugger me, than some nouveau riche prick like you,” he growled. Harry did his best not to laugh at Draco’s words.</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose we’ll have to wait for our wedding night to see about that won’t we?” Harry said.</p>
<p>Draco snorted. “And you wonder why I find you tedious already. Always following daddy’s rules, and doing what’s expected of you,” Draco grabbed another glass of wine as Dobson walked around with the tray once more.</p>
<p>Harry plucked the glass from his fingers, downing it himself. “Gods you’re a fucking brat,” Harry said. Draco glared, ready to throw a punch when Harry grabbed his arm and excused them from the room. Draco glared as Harry pulled him by the elbow out of the drawing room. Not that anyone seemed to have noticed their absence as Harry dragged Draco down the hall and into the loo. “Get in,” Harry growled, shoving the blond in before shutting the door behind him. “You’re insufferable you know that?”</p>
<p>“If you dragged me in here to insult me, you can go fu…” But his words were cut off the moment Harry pressed their lips together. Draco gasped.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna fuck you against this door,” Harry growled in his ear.</p>
<p>Draco eyed him challengingly. “If you think you can, I <em>implore </em>you to try.” </p>
<p>Harry growled, flipping the blond around, shoving him up against the door wrenching his trousers down, landing a hard smack to the blond’s perfect arse. Draco moaned.</p>
<p>“So fucking mouthy. Bet I could find a million better uses for that mouth,” Harry said, biting the back of Draco’s shoulder as he untied his own tie, wrenching it free from his collar to shove it into the blond’s mouth. Draco groaned around the tie as Harry dropped to his knees, pressing his face into the blond’s arse. “You like that, you pretentious little shit?” he growled, nipping at the globes of his arse. Draco whined again arching and Harry grinned, shoving two of his fingers roughly inside the blond’s arse. “Fucking, spoiled, brat,” he growled, twisting his fingers inside the blond, drawing out little gasps of pleasure as he curled his fingers to hit his prostate. Draco screamed around the tie, slamming into the door with a whine. “Gods you’re so fucking tight. You sure you’ve ever had a stable boy bugger you, or am I the first you liar.” Draco growled, “Stay still damn you,” Harry commanded, slapping his arse hard again. Draco moaned and Harry got to his feet, unzipping his own trousers enough to pull out his own hard cock, and spit into his hand. Draco gasped as Harry shoved his cock roughly into the blond, fucking him against the door. Draco moaned, and whined around the tie in his mouth as Harry bit and sucked on Draco’s shoulders and neck. “You beautiful pain in the arse,” Harry hissed, fucking him harder, his fingers digging into Draco’s hips with every thrust.</p>
<p>Draco groaned, letting his head fall back onto Harry’s shoulder. Harry grinned taking the opportunity to sink his teeth into his throat, sucking hard ensuring there would be plenty of evidence on the blond for some time to come.</p>
<p>“Gonna mark you and make sure <em>everybody </em>knows who you belong to, baby,” Harry growled. Draco nodded, meeting Harry thrust for thrust. “Come for me, baby, fuck gonna come so hard inside you,” Harry growled into his ear. Draco whined, coming completely untouched just from the feel of Harry’s cock inside him. Harry shuddered coming hard inside the blond, before he pulled up his pants and trousers, and pulled the tie from the blond’s mouth and hissed into his ear. “Keep that inside you for the rest of the night,” Harry growled. Draco groaned as he turned to stare at Harry.</p>
<p>“Y—yes sir,” he said. Harry smirked putting his tie back on as Draco merely stared at him, looking fully fucked out and impossibly hotter. A few moments later, Draco followed him out of the bathroom, looking like he’d been thoroughly mauled as they made their way, hand-in-hand to the dining room where Dobson had informed him the family was taking dinner.</p>
