          <div class="userstuff"><p>Sirius was on his bed. He was really bored, although it was Christmas eve. He didn't want to do the same, he wanted to start this year<br/>differently. Not with all the other children and teachers, but with the only person that made him feel truly better with himself, and that<br/>was Remus. Although he loved him, he had to admit that he would never take the risk and do anything else beyond the expected.<br/>Suddenly the door opened and Remus' head appeared.<br/>''Hi love! How are you?'' he asked with a big smile on his face.<br/>''I'm fine, why are you asking?'' Sirius said and smiled too. He loved it when Remus was happy.<br/>''Oh nothing. Just wanted to make sure that you're feeling good!'' he said ''uuum,okay,see you later,BYYYYE!'' he said and his head<br/>disappeared from the door.<br/>Sirius was surprised. What was that? He remained there, with his mouth opened, when the door opened again.<br/>''Hey, um, love I forgot to tell you... Wear the best outfit you have tonight okay?''<br/>''Why, it will just be another Christmas eve like all the others.''<br/>''Just please, do it for me... pleeeease?''<br/>Sirius sighed and smiled ''Anything for you''<br/>Remus smiled, walked to his bed and pressed a little kiss on his lips. ''Thank you love, you're going to have a great time, I promise<br/>you!'' he said and ran out of the room.<br/>When Remus closed the door behind him, he smiled and a sigh of relief came out. He had prepared everything: he had already made<br/>two hot chocolates with marshmallows, he had picked a book to read to Sirius to fall asleep more easily, and of course his present was<br/>there, in the middle of the room. When he thought about his present he automatically smiled. Sirius would be so happy, he thought. He<br/>opened the big box and saw his little puppy waiting impatiently and moving his tail up and down. It was so beautiful. His fur was all<br/>black with a white stamp on its right eye.<br/>''Remuuuuus?'' Sirius shouted from the bedroom.<br/>''Yes honey?'' he replied and quickly closed the box, but the puppy barked a bit.<br/>''Uum,what was that???'' he asked in confusion.<br/>''Nothing honey, nothing. What did you want to tell me?''<br/>''Forget it, I found what to wear''<br/>''Okay, get dressed and see you in a while, I love you''<br/>James entered the common room and blinked at Remus.<br/>''So, how's your plan going?''<br/>''It's going great. Only that he barked for a bit, but everything's okay!''<br/>''Great! Good luck Remus! So, I'm just gonna go downstairs, and I'll try not to interrupt you when I come back.''<br/>''James! Anyways, merry Christmas to Lily from us both.''<br/>''Okay. Good luck, see you tomorrow!'' said James and got out of the common room.<br/>Remus was very anxious. He knocked the door and he didn't have any answer.<br/>''Sirius? Honey,why aren't you answering?'' he said and entered the room. He then saw Sirius trying to ''unwrap'' himself out of a suit.<br/>''Come here'' said Remus while laughing and helped him undress. When Sirius (finally) dressed up, Remus took a deep breath.<br/>''So, are you ready?''<br/>''Um, yeah. Why are you making it so special?''<br/>Remus smiled, took his hand and opened the door.<br/>''Because it is special.''<br/>Sirius was surprised. The atmosphere was great, there were some candles lighting and the fire from the fireplace gave the whole room<br/>a sweet essence of home. But what was really making him feel so excited was the big box in front of the table.<br/>''Wow, Remus. This- this is awesome, thank you!'' he said and hugged him tight.<br/>They sat down on the carpet and started drinking their hot chocolates while holding hands and watching the fire.<br/>''So, although this isn't the new Year's eve, when I can officially talk about the new year, I want to say a few words.''<br/>''Of course'' said Sirius and smiled.<br/>''Well, you know that you are one of the most important people in my entire life, and that without you I wouldn't feel as loved and<br/>appreciated as I'm feeling now. So, i just want to thank you for all the memories we've made, and the memories we'll make in the future.<br/>Together.''<br/>''Together'' repeated Sirius and kissed him softly.<br/>After a few moments of silence, Remus was the one to break it.<br/>''So, will you open your present?''<br/>''Oh, sure!''said Sirius and started opening the package. ''Remus. It's moving'' he said and laughed. ''What is ittt?''<br/>When he finally opened it and saw what was inside, he was too happy to react. He always wanted to have a puppy but he had never<br/>seriously considered getting one, and now he felt he had all he ever wanted. His boyfriend and his puppy. A small, cute and happy<br/>family.<br/>''Oh God! Remus, thank you so much for that, i love you so much!'' he said and hugged him really tight.<br/>''I just love seeing you happy honey. You're adorable when you smile.''<br/>Sirius went back and looked into his eyes. He smiled again and kissed him. He let his head fall in Remus' shoulders.<br/>''So, how are we gonna name him?''<br/>''Sirius, this is something you will decide''<br/>''No, this is something we will both decide. Because we're a family now.''<br/>Remus smiled and put his hand on Sirius' shoulder.<br/>''Yeah. A family''</p></div>
