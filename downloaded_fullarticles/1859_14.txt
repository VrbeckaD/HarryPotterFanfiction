    <p>Walking down the stone corridor, heels clicking against the floor, he approached the wall again. Examining it. Trying to figure it out. Glaring as though its mere existence was an insult.</p><p>The trolls and Barnabus the Barmy watched him from their tapestry, wondering what he was doing.</p><p>Severus paced back and forth, like a beast wanting to prowl but only given the room in his little cage.</p><p>“C’mon,” he growled at the wall. “I know you’re there. Show me the room where the diadem is.”</p><p>As if mocking him, the wall remained a wall. With a tired sigh, Severus ran his hand through his hair.</p><p>He needed to take a step back. He needed a break. Yet they only had two days before students would head home and once they did, so would he and the rest of the staff.</p><p>He didn’t want to leave school without having destroyed <em>one</em> horcrux.</p><p>Otherwise, the diadem would be the last one left.He’d rather not leave something so dangerous around longer than it already had. Severus turned on his heel and made his way back to his and Remus’ room…</p><p>He stopped as an idea flickered in his head. He approached the wall again.</p><p><em>A place to hide it,</em> he thought. <em>A place to hide it.</em></p><p>The wall shimmered as a wood door appeared before him. He entered the room, shocked at the sight of the large room, filled with books, missing socks, clothes, shoes, furniture, broken glass and quills, dried ink, old parchments – years and years of lost things that must have congregated here in this room.</p><p>Thousands, perhaps millions, of items piled high to the ceiling.</p><p>Severus pulled his wand out.</p><p>“<em>Accio Diadem</em>,” he said.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>He didn’t think it’d work, but it was worth trying.</p><p>Severus exhaled and began to search, using his wand to clear and organize the space, burning and vanishing debris he’d come across.</p><p>As he worked to find the diadem horcrux, he slowly disrobed, teacher’s robes growing too heavy and hot. He laid them down on a table as he searched, rolling his sleeves up his forearms.</p><p>Every so often, he’d cast a tempus charm, checking the time.</p><p>Minutes had gone by into hours.</p><p>He debated sending Remus a patronus to let him know where he was, in case he lost track of time, but decided against it. He had the tempus charm. He’d be all right.</p><p>Besides, Remus had been dragged off to Hogsmeade by the kids in his school paper, <em>The Hogwarts Report</em>, before noon. He likely wasn’t back yet, being dragged here and there by the ten teenagers – the five reporters, two editors, and three photographers – that had come to view him as a mentor.</p><p>Remus could handle them better than Severus anyway.</p><p>Even so, he was sure he’d hear from Remus eventually, especially if he did lose track of time.</p><p>He opened a box and smirked. Silver, sapphire, and diamond gleamed back at him. The crown was shaped as an eagle with wings spread wide.  It was a pity he had to destroy it. It was beautiful.</p><p>A soft whisper came from it, like a distant call or summon. Severus exhaled again, pulling free his basilisk fang before picking up the diadem –</p><p>
  <em>His head snapped to the side. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The force of the slap sent him flying against the wall. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hyperventilating, Severus curled into a ball, trying to protect as much of himself as he could as the belt buckle smacked his back and arms and legs.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Stop!” his mother shouted, seizing Tobias’ wrist. “It was an accident! Please stop!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Severus jumped, racing away as his father turned his fury onto his mother. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He locked his door and scrambled to his bed, skidding his knees against the carpet as he pulled his kit out. He whispered the incantation as he cut his finger and placed a few drops at the base of the doorframe. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Already she was screaming, even as the shield glowed blue and drew upward over the door. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Once the spell was complete, Severus grabbed his walkman and headphones, turning the music on and drowning out his mother’s screams–</em>
</p><p>“Severus!”</p><p>He gasped and looked around, trying to figure out where he was.</p><p>Back in the Room.</p><p>Remus gripped his shoulders tight, eyes filled with worry and anger.</p><p>In the corner, the diadem laid broken, shattered in a hundred pieces.</p><p>Some of the shards were black as coal.</p><p>Charred.</p><p>Severus shook, lowering his hands from his ears.</p><p>“How long…” he croaked. Severus cleared his throat. “How long was I…um…”</p><p>“I don’t know, but I got here ten minutes ago.”</p><p>“You knew?”</p><p>“Merope helped me find you,” Remus said. Severus sighed, cursing himself for not being more careful. “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>“No,” Severus snapped. “I don’t.”</p><p>He stood, massaging his jaw. Remus stood as well. “Had to punch you to get you out of it,” he admitted. “If that hadn’t worked, I’d have sent for Poppy.” Severus hummed. “Why did you go after it alone?”</p><p>“I didn’t want to wait,” he said.</p><p>Remus sighed. Still angry, Severus guessed. He supposed he’d be angry, too, if their positions were reversed.</p><p>“I won’t do it again,” he vowed. “I think we’ll need some sturdy gear, too.”</p><p>“No shit,” Remus said, still frowning.</p><p>“I’ll make it up to you,” he promised. Even then, Remus still seemed angry. “Was it really that bad?”</p><p>“I never want to see you like that again, Severus,” he said. “You were just…you weren’t here. It was like you were trapped in some sort of hell or…”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s pretty close.” With as little detail as possible, he told Remus what it had done. The memory he was forced to relive.</p><p>Remus took Severus’ hands in his own. “I’m sorry you saw that,” he said. “But maybe now you’ll not dare to go after them alone again.”</p><p>Severus nodded, refusing to close his eyes. Even now, he felt the residual pain from the buckle hitting his skin. Could still hear the echoes of his mother’s screams and father’s yells…</p><p>“Good,” Remus said. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Severus didn’t sleep well the week after the Diadem was destroyed. The memories of what his father had been like left him feeling ill and nervous. He’d get bits of sleep, but once he started to dream, the memories took over.</p><p>Remus wished he could make dreamless sleep as well as any other potioneer, but he wasn’t nearly as good as Severus. Even so, Severus wouldn’t touch one that wasn’t made by him specifically. Given his state, Remus didn’t want Severus to make the potion himself.</p><p>So, they were stuck dealing with it.</p><p>Remus reassured Severus that he could talk to him about his past, but otherwise didn’t press. Nor did Severus dare say a thing about the memory he was forced to relive until the sixth sleepless day.</p><p>As he recounted the memory in full, Remus was torn. He was angry. Furious. He wanted to do something – anything – to ease Severus’ pain.</p><p>But what?</p><p>Both of Severus’ parents were dead. And even if they weren’t, Tobias Snape likely wouldn’t want to face the truth of his actions and the effect they had on his son. He likely wouldn’t have cared.</p><p>Remus’ parents weren’t perfect. He knew that, but given what he knew now…</p><p>Compared to Severus’ family, his were the epitome of stability. Still, after that, Severus slept far more peacefully as Remus held him close, running his hands through his hair.</p><p>The following morning, Remus woke before Severus. The heat was seeping into the room already and they’d abandoned the blankets in the middle of the night, which had fallen to the floor.</p><p>Remus stretched, drawing enough strength back into his limbs to get out of bed. His feet touched the carpet just as Severus took his wrist.</p><p>“G’morning,” Severus groaned.</p><p>Remus leaned over him and kissed his forehead.</p><p>“I was going to get breakfast started, Love. Any requests?”</p><p>Severus hummed and shook his head. He tucked a strand of ebony behind Severus’ ear and Severus’ grip slackened as he went back to sleep.</p><p>Remus headed down the stairs, pulling a bathrobe on as he headed to the kitchen.</p><p>There, he found eggs, milk, and sausages. It wasn’t much, but it would do.</p><p>As Remus cooked, his thoughts strayed back to his fury. It might not have excused the way Severus had treated his students in the past, but at least Remus could understand where it came from.</p><p>Severus might’ve thought he was fine without really realizing how damaging he had truly been. Remus sighed and made a conscious decision to help his lover stay accountable to his actions.</p><p>He was getting better, true. Some students actually were enjoying potions now.</p><p>And Severus himself?</p><p>Well, he was never going to be a picture of proper mental health, but he was getting better. That was all Remus could hope for.</p><p>He half expected to hear heavy footsteps rushing toward the kitchen, as they had the previous summer. Remus had known it’d take some readjusting, but as it was, he wished it wouldn’t be so…</p><p>Empty?</p><p>Silent?</p><p>Well, it wasn’t as though Harry was unwelcome. He’d visit with Sirius sooner or later. Though, he half thought he’d get teased relentlessly by his friend if he asked about it.</p><p>Harry was safer with Sirius anyway.</p><p>Sirius wasn’t a former death eater, nor was he a werewolf.</p><p>Even if they didn’t have any issues the previous summer with either fact, it was still safer. Harry could surpass the emotional abuse his aunt and uncle threw at him. That he was hardly affected at all made Remus wonder what it was about the lad that made him so strong…</p>
