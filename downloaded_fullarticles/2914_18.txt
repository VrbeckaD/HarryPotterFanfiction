    <p>I just had a dream where i went into a wall greens like store and i was in the make up store with Hermione and her mom (im assuming it was her mom) anyways i over hear this lady say to her daughter, "oh, make sure you get a good brush you dont want to get curly hair like hers" pointing to Hermiones mom, and i don't know why but i got super angry about this like beyond the normal level of annoyance i would have, anyway i go over and ask "whats wrong with curly hair?" and at this point the lady starts trying to defend herself going "oh you know", im like "no, i dont know". Clearly getting angrier and angrier, at this point the lady has realized it how much she has stuck her in her mouth, Hermiones mom left angry at the whole store though. I think she was mad cause i was the one who said something instead of letting her handle it.</p>
