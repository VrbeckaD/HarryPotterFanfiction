    <p>A pair of bright green eyes flash open, and suddenly, everyone is awake. As the perfectly normal inhabitants of number 4, Privet Drive, open the door to check the mail, on the step, they find a child. All he has with him is a blanket, and a note. As soon as the woman sees him, she remembers a box given to her by her sister. With that thought, she goes and quickly takes the baby into the car. She soon drives away, and will never see the boy again.</p>
