          <div class="userstuff"><p>Over time, Harry honestly grew to love his new morning routine. </p><p>Waking up was finally easier. <em>Much</em> better than being asleep. His new ideal time of day was morning. He could wake up and run for miles, blasting Hermione’s latest Muggle Music Workout Playlist, losing himself in the morning glow and crisp air. He’d even finally been able to shower again recently. It was wonderful feeling cleansed. He could scrub himself raw until he was burning, turning dark red, hissing from the scalding hot water. </p><p>Everything wasn’t perfect yet. Ron and ‘Mione could tell he still wasn’t eating right. As if their worried glances at each other and their insistence on bringing more and more groceries every visit wasn't enough to make Harry realise.</p><p>“Harry, we brought your favourite sandwiches from that corner shop in Diagon.” Hermione handed him a take-out bag and gave him a small hesitant smile. </p><p>And if Hermione wasn’t anything, it was hesitant. Anyone else would brush that look off. They would think she was just <em>awkward</em>. Just had a nervous smile. But Harry knew better. She was hesitating because she wasn’t sure if he would eat today. If he would violently refuse the food or if he would pretend but let it go untouched. If she would come over in a few days, see the unopened bag in his fridge and toss it out. She wasn’t sure if her gesture would be taken as kindness or insult. And that only made Harry feel even more like a <em>monster</em>. </p><p>“We know you can’t refuse one of those Mate, so don’t you lie to us.” Ron was close behind, hands full of <em>more</em> groceries, walking right into Harry’s flat and dropping everything on the bare countertop. He gave a cursory glance at Hermione, almost attempting an evaluation of the tension in the room, but tried to keep himself nonchalantly busy. </p><p>Harry paused for a moment but gave in to a small laugh that was more a broken up sigh than anything else. “You two know me so well.” And he <em>tried</em>. For them. He ate whatever he could when they were around, but as soon as they left, it was all forgotten. Appetite lost, the empty hollow feeling growing wide enough to fill him once more. </p><p>Though if Harry would take a moment and stop lying to himself, maybe attempt Occlumency or Meditation to examine his emotional state, he would readily admit the empty feeling never <em>really</em> left. Everything was just a <em>distraction</em>. Veiling the void like a particularly poorly cast Disillusionment Charm.</p><p>Though the days were getting a little better. Harry’s job felt normal again, it was easier to ignore the feeling of something missing, and his co-workers stopped asking questions. Training his Aurors became simple again, natural to lose track of time when he was working. Effortless to forget everything. Work was his new favourite distraction, but he was mindful not to overdo it. He didn’t want to spark any more rumours, didn’t want Ron hearing things and asking about them after hunting him down for missing yet another lunch in the Ministry cafe. </p><p>Which led to his evenings. </p><p>Harry still wasn’t comfortable with the evenings. He would come back to a large, empty home. He thought about moving many times because it was honestly too much <em>place</em> for just him. He didn’t know what to do with the sudden extra space. His breath laboured at the thought. </p><p>
  <em>Filling the space. With what? How? </em>
</p><p>He didn’t let himself think too long about it. Never sure if he’d make it through his next panic attack. </p><p>And so the flat stayed as it was. And Harry stayed as he was. </p><p>The Night was always the same routine. Different from Harry’s new morning routine. It was, sadly, still a part of his old routine. By now he’s showered again, the comfortable burn is always a welcome distraction at this time of day. He’d slip into shorts and an old Muggle band tee, not really caring about his damp hair or how he was tracking water all over the place. </p><p>There was no one there to stop him from doing that now.</p><p>And so Harry would sit on the couch, his head falling against the backing, eyes focusing on the swirling patterns of his ceiling. It was moist— the feeling of cushions absorbing water from his hair. It was gross— the feeling of warm dampness. The energy to cast a Drying Charm unavailable to him. His face wet from droplets falling down and around his features.</p><p>It didn’t take long to realise he was crying again.</p><p>The radio remained off. The empty static drone of the Wards was so <em>loud</em>. The clock hanging above the hallway to his bedroom ticked to 23:51, but he couldn’t move. Harry didn’t want to. Right around now they would be broadcasting hits from the late '90s, he could hear a song playing in his head, or maybe he was humming it aloud. Harry honestly wasn’t sure. He hadn’t heard it in months. He never wanted to hear it again.</p><p>By the time he stopped crying, it was 02:00.</p><p>Harry had learnt to hate sleep. There was nothing for him there, in that room. No matter what he did, it was still too cold. He didn’t like sleeping, but really he didn’t like <em>dreaming</em>. It was always the same, for months it was always the same dream. So as his eyes slid shut and his will to outlast his exhaustion slipped, he could already taste his fears.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Harry.”</em>
</p><p>Oh, Merlin. He loved that voice. Harry loved everything about it. He would give anything to hear that voice for the rest of his life. “<em>Yes</em>, Tom?” His words were drawn out, teasingly. </p><p>“What are you doing on the floor, idiot? Get up; it’s dirty.” Tom stood over him, arms crossed, bent over slightly so his head could tilt down comfortably. His hair fell, framing his face with soft curls. Tom would never admit it, but he was definitely smiling, and it was definitely fantastic. </p><p>Harry’s hands were thrown across his stomach, a grin stretching ear to ear, and a plan forming quickly in his brain. He sighed dramatically and batted his lashes, “Alright fine. Help me up?” Harry lazily reached up, waiting for Tom’s firm grip. Tom gave a silent huff, but his eyes had a knowing gleam. He grabbed Harry’s hand and didn’t get much farther when Harry suddenly latched on and yanked him downward. Harry fought the good fight and was still overtaken.</p><p>Both his wrists were held down by Tom’s hands. It didn’t help that Harry was significantly shorter than Tom and as much as he protested and shat on the height difference, he would be lying if he said it didn’t make his heart race. Their quick, uneven breaths mingled together. Harry was struck, staring at Tom’s face, admiring it and only snapping out of the trance after Tom gave in to a shared overwhelming urge to kiss his lover. His mouth deliberately pressing down onto Harry’s, licking and teeth tugging on his bottom lip until Harry was squirming. Protesting Tom’s unfair hold with useless yanks and muffled moaning complaints.</p><p>The kiss was long, drawn-out. Messy. Just the kind Tom says he hates but is always the one to start. They had relaxed into the embrace, and after a while, Harry’s lips escaped. He lightly dragged them across Tom’s cheek, stretching up to trace Tom’s jaw. Then down and down and down, stopping on Tom’s neck. He kissed and sucked carefully. Patiently. And if there was one thing Harry could never be for <em>long</em>, it was <em>patient</em>. Tom was quick to catch on.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Harry was surprised to hear Tom speak up so suddenly. His voice was wavering, Harry’s attention obviously having an effect. But the question was ignored as Harry continued, one hand finally eluding Tom’s hold to slip down Tom’s side and toy with the edge of his shirt.</p><p>Tom’s body was warm as Harry’s hand splayed out on his abdomen. Tom’s shirt followed Harry’s hand upward as his lips were continuing their attention to Tom’s neck. Harry’s unhurried touch stopped when he had reached the centre of Tom’s chest.</p><p>Harry couldn’t help but pause entirely. Tom’s heart, a steady, constant beat. He could feel it against his palm. Tom sighed, “Harry, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Harry hadn’t realised he was holding his breath until it all came expelling out of him, “Do you have to go on this trip?” Harry fell limp to the floor. His head turned to stare at the legs of their old flat couch. He could feel his mouth moving, saying the words but couldn’t hear them.</p><p>Tom stared at the side of Harry’s face for a long moment then gripped and moved Harry’s jaw to maintain eye contact, “I told you already, it’s important. I have to.”</p><p>“Are you sure you can’t send anyone else?” Harry could feel his face scrunch up, a grimace probably filling his features. He was never good at hiding his emotions. Not like Tom.</p><p>“No, Harry. We’ve been over this before. I have to be there. It can only be me.” Tom did an excellent job hiding his exasperation, but Harry could see it the moment Tom closed his mouth. The thin line there at the limits of its patience. </p><p>“Right,” Harry didn’t know what else to say. He didn’t like the idea of Tom leaving him. This business trip seemed unnecessary. They all did.</p><p>“Harry, this isn’t fair. You know I wouldn’t go if I had a choice.” Tom’s palm held Harry’s cheek, and it was such a shame that Harry could see in Tom’s eye that he meant it. He meant every word. It was so much harder to stay mad at him when he was so sincere like this. </p><p>“I don’t know, this isn’t right. Maybe I’m just crazy. Something feels off about this one.” Harry felt Tom adjust his weight and reach for Harry’s hand, holding it gently, thumb carefully tracing his knuckles.</p><p>“You worry too much.” Tom brought Harry’s hand up to his lips and gave Harry’s fingers a mollifying kiss. “I love you.”</p><p>Harry’s fears were pushed aside. Tom was here. In front of him. Loving him. “I love you too, Tom.”</p><p>They stood up, Harry genuinely accepting Tom’s help. He felt heavier. As if the weight of the conversation had suddenly gathered up and on to Harry’s shoulders. The trip wasn’t going to take itself, and their love session on the carpet wasn’t the smartest plan if they wanted Tom returning as fast as possible.</p><p>The exchange of goodbyes was solemn. Neither wanting to part ways, but Harry stayed strong. He saw Tom Apparate off and made a quiet dinner for one. Looking forward to attempting to sleep off the days until Tom returned home. </p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t realise how badly he would need this rest for weeks to come. </p><p> </p><p>He woke up; Tom wasn’t in bed. It took him a moment to remember that Tom was still away. In his defence, Harry was never really a morning person. In his defence, Tom <em>should</em> have been home yesterday. </p><p>But today he had woken up, still alone, and the Muggle alarm clock on Tom’s bedside table was a stable bright-red reading 07:12. Harry never woke up before 09:00, so this was <em>unusual</em>. He didn’t realise his Floo was going off <em>(probably what woke him to begin with)</em> until what was most likely the eighth: “HARRY JAMES POTTER. ANSWER THIS DAMN FLOO THIS INSTANT OR I AM GETTING A WARRANT FROM THE AURORS TO TEAR THE WARDS DOWN.”</p><p>Hermione’s voice promised the wrath of gods and Harry wasn’t one to deny her. </p><p>His Floo flared to life when he finally opened it, Hermione stepped out with all the grace of a newborn foal. Head to toe covered in soot, panic in her eyes and a frown on her face he hadn’t seen since N.E.W.T. year.</p><p>Any humour he’d felt quickly withered away at the sight. </p><p>“Harry, I’ve been trying to reach you all morning—<em> have you seen the news?</em>” Hermione took one full glance of him and shook her head, “No. I suppose you haven’t.” She flicked her wand, summoning <em>The Daily Prophet</em>, shoving it into his hands. He didn’t have his glasses on but didn’t need them to feel the <em>intensity</em> of this bad news. </p><p>“It’s finally happened, Harry. That rising Dark Lord in Russia has made his move. He had help from the Turkish President of Magic and their Magical Council of Ministers; they took everything over from their borders, to Austria, and to Greece. They’ve been planting Wizards and Witches for well over a year and working in tandem with localised Creature groups who support their cause.”</p><p>“Wait-<em>wait</em>! Hermione slow down, <em>slow down</em>. What does this mean for us? What’s happened that has you panicking?”</p><p>“Oh, Harry… don’t tell me you don’t know where Albania is.”</p><p>Harry went to speak but found his voice missing. He could hear <em>The Daily Prophet</em> rustle and tear from his grip. But his eyes were stuck on Hermione’s instant wince of regret, the conviction in her eyes keeping him grounded for all of three seconds. He could practically hear her mantras of <em>at least he heard it from me.</em></p><p>Abruptly his heart hurt. He felt like dry heaving. A pounding headache had started. His mouth was open in slight disbelief; Harry could feel his body going numb and the acidic burn of nausea creeping in him. His eyes were watering. The irritation of not blinking them and forcing himself to squint at Hermione for so long to keep her in focus had mixed at some point. </p><p>Harry didn’t even flinch when she wrapped her arms tight around him, it was almost like he knew it was coming, his arms immediately holding her close. An automatic response.</p><p>Hermione started again, slowly, carefully selecting her words, “They’ve erected wide-scale Anti-Apparition Wards. It’s an elaborate use of powerful runestones and a type of–well what I can only relate to <em>Muggle Batteries</em>. Something they’ve developed to hold incredibly copious amounts of Magic with little to no Core draining affects on any one individual. <em>Wizarding Batteries</em>. An ingenious piece of Magic and something to truly be admired if it wasn’t being used to imprison multiple countries currently.”</p><p>“You’re rambling…” Harry mumbled, not unkindly, shock settling in and paving the way for denial. “He can make it out of this. It’s Tom we’re talking about. There’s no way some stupid Dark Lord with a plan can stop him. You were both brightest of our age. He’s Undersecretary.”</p><p>He could feel Hermione shaking in his grasp, “H-harry… they’ve been killing off foreign dignitaries. They-um, they’re making a <em>terrifying</em> political statement. They’ve…” Her choked cries we’re breaking through, but he could fill in those blanks with his active imagination just fine.</p><p>He broke down.</p><p>Sobs wracked through his body, jostling Hermione in their sudden wake. He could do nothing but sink to his knees and hold tight around her smaller frame, terrified of the possibility that Tom—</p><p>
  <em>Tom wasn’t alive?</em>
</p><p>His voice was raw when he finally released Hermione to let her Floo Call the Ministry. </p><p>
  <em>The wait is excruciatingly painful.</em>
</p><p>Harry wasn’t sure if he said that or had thought it, but Hermione’s soft look of understanding made him believe it was something in between. He wasn’t sure of anything. But she still kneeled in front of the Floo and sat by his legs through all the unsure <em>everything</em>. He stared at her, and it felt like hours had gone by before he said,</p><p>“I knew something was wrong the day he left, you know?” She slowly started shaking her head, knowing her she was probably prepared to do whatever it takes to stop him from blaming himself.</p><p>
  <em>Too late.</em>
</p><p>“This was never right.” Harry’s hand gripped his hair, clutching the side of his head, his eyes still hurt from crying and shutting them closed so tightly. He could see spots. Everything wouldn’t stop pounding. “I knew something was wrong. He shouldn’t have gone on that trip. <em>This was never right</em>. I should have stopped him.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t take his eyes off the carpet he and Tom were on the day he left. He couldn’t stop all of the thoughts running rampant in his head. Telling him to grab his wand and Incendio the flat so he wouldn’t have to look at it, anything to stop the regret of not forcing Tom to stay. </p><p>It’s odd what thoughts would do to a person. Harry couldn’t think of anything but that carpet until mere seconds ago. And now he’s trying to rack his brain for an answer to a simple question. </p><p>
  <em>Did I tell him I love him before he Apparated?</em>
</p><p>Hermione’s voice was calm and quiet, soothing to listen to. Even when she was "<em>regretfully informed"</em> that yes, Tom Riddle, youngest Undersecretary to date was, in fact, one of the few foreign dignitaries that had “<em>unfortunately been accounted for.”</em> She was calm and quiet while insisting she gets sent half-hour updates and any emergency information as soon as possible. Calm and quiet while ending the Floo Call, getting off her knees to stand in front of Harry and grasp his shoulders. Holding him down with fear in her eyes like he would drift away and never come down at a moments notice. </p><p>“I— <em>Harry. I’m</em>…I am so <em>sorry.</em>”</p><p>Hermione, as choked up as she was, couldn’t say anything or do anything but watch him crumple once again. His body sinking to the floor, legs folding up to meet his chest as the lingering hope withered away; barely fulfilling its full bloom. His breathing was wrong. Harry could sense glass shattering and feel his Magic whipping wildly. His hands gripped the damned carpet so hard he could hear it tearing. <em>He was crying so hard; he was practically screaming.</em></p><p> </p><p>And Harry was screaming when he woke up. The nightmares had been consistent. Screaming awake was his new alarm clock. A persistent internal reminder. He was crying again. He was trying to catch his breath; his entire body was trembling in pain. But this was normal. This was better. Much better compared to a month ago. When Harry could breathe normally again, he got up. Changed into his running sweats, and walked out the door. </p><p>And over time, Harry honestly grew to love his new morning routine.</p></div>
