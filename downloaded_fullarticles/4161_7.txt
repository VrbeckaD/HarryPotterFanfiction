    <p>Ron Weasley knew it was war.</p>
<p>And just like the chess he was so skilled at, it required sacrifices. Between the three, he the always the one to come up with the best strategies. Hermione was brilliant but even she could not deny that her feminine emotions tend to obstruct her usually witty mind.</p>
<p>And Harry, oh Merlin Harry, his best mate. This type of plan, it would surely kill him. Harry was too kind, too soft to think up a plan that needs sacrifices. That’s the main reason why he was shite in chess.</p>
<p>So it was up to him. And Merlin was it painful. To deliberately plan the possible deaths of his friends and families. To desperately think up some other ways to make this plan a successful and fail <em>because sacrifices are needed in wars</em>. To feel sick as he explained the plan to his soldiers and see those steely resolve in their eyes showing they were fine with the plan, as long as they win the war. To sleep with nightmares in the faces of their dead soldiers and comrades, knowing he was the reason they were dead.</p>
<p>That he should have thought of something better. That he should thought a plan where no deaths should happen. That all those people shouldn’t have to die.</p>
<p>Ron loves Hermione Granger. And he knew that this bloody war was slowly killing her. He saw it in the way her eyes dulled everytime the soldiers were brought back with agony twisted faces as their mouths opened in a never ending scream. A scream that would haunt her at nights.</p>
<p>And he hates it!</p>
<p>That every day, he was slowly but surely losing his best mates. And sometimes, even he felt that he was losing himself. But he was selfish. Between the three of them, he would be the first to admit it. He was a selfish prat and if his plans and strategies would save the three of them, then he’ll bear it. He’ll bear all the guilt of those dead warriors.</p>
<p>And if he had to sacrifice a few soldiers just so that Harry and Hermione won’t be dead, well, he’ll admit of being selfish, no matter how many times he had to, as long as the three of them was <em>alive. </em> </p>
<p>But in the end, they were still children, and the crippling guilt was too suffocating. So at times during the night, when he felt the war was a little too overwhelming, he’ll go out and gaze at the stars. And if Harry and Hermione joined him later, can’t sleep with their own demons and nightmares, well, none of them said anything.</p>
