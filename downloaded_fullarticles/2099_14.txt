    <p>Harry’s first sign that something has gone very, very wrong comes as soon as he becomes aware of his surroundings again: it is cold. There’s a faint dripping sound that sends a tingling sensation dancing across his scalp until he wakes up a little bit further and notices the second sign that not everything is as it should be, which is, of course, the voice that murmurs somewhere behind him, sibilant and smooth. As he’s contemplating it, the third sign becomes apparent when his scar begins to ache. It doesn’t hurt much compared to what he’s had before, and is only worth mentioning because of the thrill that surges through him as he notices it, like... like intricately laid plans have just come to fruition and yielded unexpected benefits. The dark lord is fucking delighted. Idly, Harry wonders if his colleague and fellow Assistant Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts will have anything to say about the ache; Tom always says Harry is adorably transparent when he’s in pain. Well, whatever. Anyone would have trouble keeping their composure with Voldemort’s emotions popping up constantly in their head. Tom just jumps at any chance to be an ass, is what it is.</p><p>Harry rolls his eyes at the thought of Tom, and notices the fourth and last sign as he sits up.</p><p>There is a sharp pain in his left arm, like he’s pulled every single muscle connected to his wrist. Harry squints down and sees a dark, bruise-like shape on his forearm, indistinct in the dim light.</p><p>The voice behind him stops. Harry tenses, distracted from his arm by his vulnerability and lack of glasses or wand.</p><p>“Harry,” says Tom, and Harry relaxes automatically. Okay. Maybe things aren’t quite as bad as they seem, if Tom is here. After all, he’s in just the same boat as Harry; the dark lord orphaned both of them. That’s how Harry knows he can trust Tom: the war is personal for both of them, and he knows Tom would put his life on the line to stop Lord Voldemort. “How are you feeling? You’ve been through quite a lot, I’m afraid.”</p><p>“What’s--” Harry says, and then stops. Something is wrong about this. He can’t put his finger on it, but-- “Where are we?”</p><p>“That’ll require a bit of a complicated explanation,” Tom says. “You trust me, don’t you, Harry?”</p><p>Harry trusts Tom because Tom hates Voldemort, but that isn’t the only reason; he has seen Tom throw off the Imperius Curse like it was no greater hindrance than a bedsheet tossed over his body. He trusts Tom’s willpower, trusts that he will never allow his body to be used against Harry. However, in this unfamiliar setting, that still leaves many ways this person (who certainly sounds like Tom, but hasn’t shown his face) could be an enemy. Aware that he’s in a dangerous situation, Harry begins to think.</p><p>He does not much like what he comes up with.</p><p>Left.</p><p>There is an ache in Harry’s <em>left</em> forearm, which holds an indistinct splotch that he could not quite make out without his glasses. That cannot be coincidence. Harry does not look, because the only consistent impression people get from him is that he is naive and too trusting for his own good. He knows exactly how he appears now (drowsy and relieved to hear Tom’s voice), but he does not know how he will appear if he is noticed noticing the dark mark that he feels fairly certain now resides on his left forearm, pulsing thickly with magic that is simultaneously intoxicating and vomit-inducing.</p><p>“Tom?” Harry says, because he’s terrible at overt lies, but not quite as bad at lies of omission. If this is Tom, he’ll see through Harry in seconds anyway.</p><p>“Yes, it’s me,” is all Tom says, increasing Harry’s suspicion tenfold. “You never told me how you are feeling.”</p><p>“Fine,” Harry says, on edge, because something is very, very wrong, and he has no idea what it could be other than Tom, who still has not stepped into Harry’s line of sight. Frustrated, he begins to turn despite his stiff neck.</p><p>A cold hand on the bare skin of his shoulder, stopping him. Harry looks down at himself and sees an emerald green muggle tank top partly soaked through with sweat.</p><p>“Whose shirt is this?” he asks, using the fact that he truly is curious to change the subject without being too suspicious-- hopefully-- oh, whatever, Harry has no idea how to deceive anyone, he’s an open book and always has been. Not much point even trying, really.</p><p>“Mine,” Tom says, finally walking around Harry to lean over him protectively. “You were... not clothed, when I retrieved you.”</p><p>“What the fuck happened,” Harry says, at ease now, because Tom’s mannerisms are the same as always, so really, he must be safe. His gut feeling is just... leftovers, from whatever situation Tom rescued him from. Surely. “Where are my glasses?”</p><p>Harry still does not mention the dark mark on his arm.</p><p>“You were taken,” Tom says, and he is always emotionless, like a slab of stone, but his monotone is even less varied right now than usual. He reaches into his pocket and withdraws something that Harry realises is his glasses when Tom hands them to him.</p><p>“You worried,” Harry says softly, putting his glasses on, and Tom’s face closes off even more, which is how Harry knows he is correct in his guess.</p><p>“Of course I did,” Tom says, just as quiet as Harry. He takes Harry’s hand, and Harry’s jaw drops as Tom looks away, holding Harry’s right hand, his wand hand, in both of his, spreading out Harry’s fingers and feeling his skin as if to confirm that he truly is right here. “Harry...”</p><p>“Yes?” Harry says, tactful enough not to make a big deal of the fact that Tom is touching him.</p><p>“This is the least appropriate time for such a confession...” the corner of Tom’s mouth twists bitterly, and Harry frowns. Confession? “But imagining how bereft my existence would be, if any harm were to befall you... being faced with the reality of life without you, even with the significant chance you were still alive... I could not forgive myself if I allowed this... admission to remain unspoken and something happened to you, however shameful it may be...”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Harry says, and Riddle-- for some reason he’s not quite Tom in this moment-- squeezes Harry’s hand more tightly.</p><p>“It seems that somehow, you have deceived me into investing a good portion of my heart into your wellbeing,” Riddle says, and even as he speaks, Harry knows he is lying. But why? “It was really rather Slytherin of you, you know.”</p><p>“The hat wanted me for Slytherin,” Harry says, and then flushes, unsure why he’s still speaking with candor in the face of such a lie from Riddle. “Said I could be great.”</p><p>“And you argued,” Riddle says, eyes alight like the final piece of a very difficult puzzle has been slid into place for him. “Of course. That’s why you took so long to be sorted. You aren’t disgusted with me, then?”</p><p>“Of course not,” Harry says truthfully, because he isn’t disgusted, just confused. “Tom, please look at me.”</p><p>Harry forces the muscles in his face to relax as Riddle slowly turns, and he must not feel judged by whatever he sees, because a very small smile finds its way onto his lips. Maybe he thinks it looks shy. To Harry, it just looks awkward. Forced.</p><p>Riddle always knows when Harry lies, but Harry knows when Riddle lies a good portion of the time as well. So it’s a strange relationship they have. Harry tries to puzzle out why Riddle would make it even stranger with a lie of this magnitude, and can’t puzzle out any possible motive.</p><p>“Where are we?” Harry asks.</p><p>“Do you trust me?” Riddle asks.</p><p>“With everything I have,” Harry says, rather ungenerously, hoping Riddle doesn’t suspect the reason he only names his material possessions instead of his life.</p><p>It’s strange, but since waking up, Harry’s trust for Riddle has begun to ebb away.</p><p>“You are certain?” Riddle says, eyes earnest, and Harry looks away and scrambles inwardly to make it look bashful instead of untrustworthy.</p><p>“Just tell me if we are alone,” Harry murmurs, refusing to look back up at Riddle. “I don’t have to know where we are, if you can assure me we have privacy here.”</p><p>“It’s only the two of us, Harry,” Riddle says, and Harry has to struggle to keep his expression the same. <em>Liar</em>, he wants to call out, but he cannot-- it has been true, for many years, that Harry Potter trusts Tom Riddle with his life. To act outwardly as though this is no longer the case would be... inadvisable, Harry believes.</p><p>“Good,” Harry says, closing his fingers around Riddle’s and squeezing. Riddle lied, so they aren’t alone, so who else could be lurking in the shadows? “I’m... I couldn’t bear it, if anyone else...”</p><p>Riddle’s tongue darts out of his mouth in a flash of pink, then disappears again.</p><p>“...Touched you this way?” he asks, and Harry is hit by the certainty that Tom Riddle wants to touch him in even more ways. Tom Riddle wants to explore him and map him out like an ancient tomb.</p><p>“Saw me like this,” Harry murmurs, shutting his eyes. “I must be a mess...”</p><p>“You don’t look so bad,” Riddle says, and Harry opens his eyes to study him. It’s almost funny that out of everything he has said to Harry so far, this is the truth.</p><p>“Don’t lie to me, Tom,” Harry says, rolling his eyes, because he is fond of irony, and Riddle reaches out to touch Harry’s face, cupping his cheek and then leaving his hand there afterwards, which has never happened before.</p><p>“I’m not,” Riddle says. “Harry, in my eyes, you are never a mess.”</p><p>“You’re a sap,” Harry grumbles.</p><p>“You turned me into this,” Riddle says. “You’ve created a monster, Harry Potter.”</p><p>Harry shudders despite himself.</p><p>“Are you alright? Does anything hurt?”</p><p>“My scar,” Harry says. “But it’s just a slight ache, really.”</p><p>“Anything else?” Riddle asks, and Harry knows what he’s hinting at. The dark mark, pulsing on his forearm. Strange that Riddle hasn’t noticed; he’s even more adept at sensing magic than Harry is, and knows the feel of Harry’s magic better than Harry himself does. Once, he crossed the entire castle blind from a hex to get to Harry because he’s too goddamn stubborn to ask for directions to the hospital wing when he can simply track Harry down and make him guide him there. So surely Riddle <em>has</em> noticed the change in Harry’s magic, the leech which has latched onto him. Which begs the question: why hasn’t he said anything?</p><p>“I feel weird,” Harry says softly.</p><p>“Weird how?”</p><p>“Everything is different, now...”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Riddle asks, probing, and because he’s feeling a tad petty, Harry only shrugs. “You don’t know?”</p><p>“Tom--”</p><p>“Harry,” Riddle says, reaching for Harry’s left arm. “Please, tell me what happened in there. What did they do to you?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Harry says, pulling both arms out of Riddle’s grip and hugging them to his stomach. “I don’t remember, Tom. How long was I...”</p><p>“Six weeks,” Riddle says, and Harry’s jaw drops, because that seems like an excessively long time to be missing. “Six weeks and one day.”</p><p>“Where?” Harry asks.</p><p>“You really don’t remember anything?” Riddle says, and Harry tries to remember, really thinks about it, but his most recent memory is of bidding him goodnight at the door to his quarters.</p><p>“Nothing,” he says. “Tom, <em>please</em>. What do you know?”</p><p>Riddle does not attempt to deflect the question. He just sits there, silent, allowing Harry to get more and more nervous.</p><p>“It is difficult to speak of,” he says finally, and Harry narrows his eyes, unable to hide the suspicious reaction this time. There is no way Riddle didn’t notice, because he catalogues every little change in a person’s facial expression when he speaks to anyone.</p><p>“Tom,” Harry says, because it would be even more suspicious to display suspicion without acting on it. “Did you kidnap me?”</p><p>Riddle’s eyes widen. He looks properly horrified.</p><p>“Of course not,” he says. “Harry--”</p><p>“The last thing I remember is saying goodnight to you as I retired to my quarters for the night,” Harry says. “Nothing else. You and I both know of your skill with memory charms. Tom, what does he have over you? I can help you, if you let me, I don’t have to tell anyone it was you.”</p><p>“It was not--”</p><p>“It was,” Harry says, certain now. “You have lied to me several times so far tonight, Tom, and I don’t understand why. Worse-- I know you must be able to feel <em>this</em>--” Harry thrusts his left forearm out to Riddle, and it is indeed the dark mark decorating his skin-- “yet you do not seem surprised. What did he give you to do it? Who did he threaten?”</p><p>Riddle blinks at Harry, so perfectly composed that his surprise is clear as day.</p><p>“You,” he says simply, and Harry frowns, opening his mouth to tell him just how little sense that makes. “My memory of you.”</p><p>Harry’s brow furrows even more.</p><p>“I don’t follow.”</p><p>“I am a selfish creature,” Riddle says. “I value my own mental stability more than almost anything... I say almost, because through this ordeal, I belatedly realised I do not value it more than I value your safety. I made a mistake, Harry.”</p><p>Riddle is looking ruefully at the dark mark on Harry’s arm, which draws Harry’s attention to it as well. The marked portion of Harry’s skin is raised, and reminds him of the allergic reaction he had to henna a very long time ago when his father dragged the three of them to India to attend a relative’s wedding. He remembers the breathtaking, sunrise-beauty of a rushed scale pattern as a cousin painted it onto his wrist, in a hurry because Harry had decided he wanted it at the last second. He remembers the itch in his skin that he tried to ignore at first, and the rough pain of scrubbing, scrubbing, scrubbing, at his wrist until the scales were almost gone.</p><p>He remembers looking at the faded orange-tan, barely visible except where it edged up onto the lighter skin of his palm, and he remembers wondering if it hurt him because he didn’t really belong. His cousins were born in India and they were all so comfortable hundreds of miles from Harry’s home, while Harry, five years old and already far too perceptive, felt like an outsider. Even his father fit perfectly into the group, the way the creepy leather legs of a wizarding cricket ball fold back into its body when the game finally ends. Harry much prefers the snitch.</p><p>Harry thinks about those relatives, about whether they could possibly still want him without his father alive to connect them together (Aunt Petunia doesn’t). And he thinks about the dark lord, and how angry it makes him to see the dark mark presented as though either component is frightening, as though either is evil.</p><p>“You betrayed me,” Harry says simply. “And you are not sorry. To be honest, you seem rather pleased.”</p><p>“Only to find you again, in one piece,” Riddle says, and Harry’s heart, his traitorous, cracked heart, whispers that maybe... maybe he means it.</p><p>Harry knows he is lying, but he wants to believe it, and he is exhausted from the conversation, barely able to keep his eyes open, so he reaches for Riddle and waits for him to lean in close enough for Harry to loop an arm around his waist and tug him closer.</p><p>“Thank you for saving me,” Harry mumbles, yawning. “You did the right thing in the end... We can talk more later. I’ll... I’ll protect you, Riddle, won’t let anyone hurt you again.”</p><p>As Harry’s eyes slip shut, he feels a finger tracing the raised, wound-like bump of the dark mark on his skin. </p><p>“Sleep, Harry,” Riddle murmurs, and Harry sleeps.</p>
