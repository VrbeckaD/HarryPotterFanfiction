    <p>            Hermione never paid much attention to others’ attractiveness. She had passing interest, but it was more appreciative than anything. While Ron screamed “Krum” at the top of his lungs and Ginny gushed over the seeker, Hermione only felt indifference. Of course he was easy on the eyes, but she didn’t feel the overwhelming need – as Ginny so elegantly put it – to snog him where he flew.</p><p>            In fact, she sort of resented Viktor Krum after the first two hours of the game. It was clear that he saw the snitch yet he did nothing to retrieve it. The Weasley twins said it was all about strategy. That he couldn’t because his team was too far down, and he needed to give them time. To Hermione, it was extending her torture. It was different when her friends played. Then she had a vested interest.</p><p>            When Viktor Krum finally caught the snitch, it was Hermione’s turn to go wild. She burst out of her seat and screamed Krum’s name. The Irish won, and she could care less. All she knew was that it was Krum who finally ended her suffering. Harry and Ron looked appalled at her sudden change in behavior. The twins took advantage of it. They hoisted Hermione up onto their shoulders and told her to give the Irish a few good chants. She happily did so, much to Ron’s chagrin.</p><p>            The twins impressed her when they carried her halfway down the stadium. She couldn’t blame them when they faltered on one of the brief landings. Hermione tripped just as her feet touched the ground, and she ran into someone from behind.</p><p>            A girl whipped her head around. Her face was a mixture of shock and anger. She started to chastise Hermione and the twins in a foreign language. French, Hermione realized. It was French. She could have been speaking the Queen’s English, and the words would have still been lost on Hermione.</p><p>            All she could do was stare. The girl’s face was mesmerizing. Her eyes were wide with anger, giving Hermione a clear view of how unnaturally blue they were. Her jaw was clenched, bringing attention to how perfectly angular it was. And her lips, oh her lips. Hermione would take French curses all day long if they were coming from those full lips.</p><p>            The girl stopped talking and stared at Hermione. Had she missed a question amidst the girl’s tirade? She gave a hard blink to snap herself out of whatever the hell just happened to her. Hermione used one of the only French words she knew.</p><p>            “Pardon,” Hermione muttered.</p><p>            The girl looked absolutely beside herself at that point. Somehow, Hermione had frustrated her more. The girl clamped the sides of her brown jacket and wrapped it tight around her, hiding the baby blue material of her sweater. As if closing in on herself would get her away from Hermione. She glared for what seemed like an eternity. Hermione was sure she was going to get slapped. What she wasn’t sure of was whether she’d particularly mind it.</p><p>            “It is fine,” the girl huffed with a thick French accent.</p><p>            Her concession was the last thing Hermione expected to hear. She couldn’t think of a reply before the girl turned her back to her to continue down the stairs, and she got a face full of the girl’s long blonde hair. Hermione would like to think it was an accident. After all, when someone is angry and they have hair reaching their bum, it is almost natural for...Hermione’s thoughts wandered again as the girl’s hips began to move. With eyes locked on the girl’s backside, Hermione was oblivious to the shouts of frustration behind her.</p><p>            “Move it!”</p><p>            “C’mon, Hermione, we have to keep going,” Harry urged.</p>
