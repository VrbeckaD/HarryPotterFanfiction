    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>9-year-old Harry Potter sat in the cupboard under the stairs of 4 Privet Drive and tried to be invisible. As the clock ticked towards 7pm, he prayed with every breath that the front door would not open, that he would not hear the loud tread of overly large feet in the hall, that the cupboard door would remain closed. It was not to be.</p>
<p>The gravel in the drive crunched and Harry heard Uncle Vernon's steps up the drive to where Aunt Petunia was waiting by the door. He heard them both move past the cupboard to the kitchen, a low hush of voices and the clink of china as the Dursleys ate the dinner Harry had prepared. Afterwards, he heard Dudley stomp away to watch television.</p>
<p>Then he heard the vacuum turn on.</p>
<p>He knew what that meant. Aunt Petunia never vacuumed herself. That was one of Harry's jobs. Aunt Petunia turning on the vacuum meant she wanted to cover up a noise she didn't want the neighbours to hear. Something that would ruin the image of a perfect family she tried so hard to project.</p>
<p>The cupboard door was wrenched open and a beefy hand wrapped around Harry's ankle and dragged him out.</p>
<p>"Please Uncle", Harry tried to say. "I didn't mean to, it was an accident", but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Vernon kept a tight hold of the child's ankle, squeezing hard enough that Harry felt his bones grinding against each other, but he kept quiet, knowing the pain would be worse if he made any complaint.</p>
<p>Vernon dragged the boy upstairs by his ankle, uncaring of his small head bouncing on the steps, the noise drowned out by the vacuum in the front room.</p>
<p>Harry's leg was dropped as soon as they entered the spare room and he hunched over his throbbing ankle, holding it close to his body. A sudden kick to his back caught Harry by surprise, though in hindsight he should have seen it coming. </p>
<p>"So, you think you can break my furniture, do you boy?" Vernon growled. "Think you can destroy my belongings with your freakish ways and go unpunished?" Harry hear the clink of Uncle Vernon's belt and cowered as far into the corner of the room as he could.</p>
<p>"No, Uncle Vernon, it was an accident, I'm sorry." There was no point in trying to explain that it really wasn't Harry's fault, that Dudley had stomped his food so hard yesterday that the supports holding the glass table up had come loose and that while he was trying to fix it today, Dudley had pushed him over onto it and caused the whole thing to smash. Any attempt to explain would only result in more pain for Harry, especially if Uncle Vernon thought he was trying to put the blame on his 'precious Didders'.</p>
<p>"You will be, boy." The first lash of the belt was excruciating, cutting into Harry's back across the bruises already black from Dudley's games. Every stroke thereafter just increased Harry's torment. Every few strikes, Uncle Vernon would lash out with a foot, his stiff-toed leather shoes causing further damage.</p>
<p>Eventually, the shoe connected with Harry's chest and he heard something crack, a sharp pain shooting through him as he tried to gasp for breath. The next blow to his back from the belt caused him to exhale sharply, and he flinched as a trickle of blood left his mouth. </p>
<p>With a final kick to his head causing Harry's vision to white out momentarily, Uncle Vernon spat onto the floor and walked away. "Filthy freak", he said as he left the room. "That'll teach you to break my things. Clean up this mess now. This room needs to be spotless for when my sister arrives next week."</p>
<p>Harry lay in the corner or the room shivering, feeling something very wrong in his chest. Every breath was agony and he could taste blood, more by the second. He tried to move in order to start wiping up his own blood before it started staining the wooden floor, but as he did so, his chest twinged again and a new bout of pain washed over him, causing him to collapse. The edges of his vision started to go dark and all Harry wished was that he might find a way to end his suffering.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore was reviewing his plans for the new school year. He had the school exactly where he wanted it and high hopes for the second Weasley boy, about to start his final year. Unfortunately, the Board of Governors had refused to endorse Albus' choice to make Charlie Head Boy this year, despite an excellent stint as prefect in the last two years. The Board felt that the Head Boy should be given to someone with a cleaner disciplinary record and Charlie had been somewhat of a menace  in his earlier years at Hogwarts. Plus there was that unfortunate dragon obsession.</p>
<p>Still, if that failed, the next Weasley was showing great promise as a responsible and rule-following child and might be his chance to bind the entire family tighter to him. Besides, Charlie still looked up to him and Albus was sure with a little persuasion, he could be persuaded to take a useful ministry job like his father.</p>
<p>Just then, one of the devices in his 'Harry Cabinet', designed to monitor the boy's health, began to whir. Unconcerned, as the device had activated several times over the years,  Albus started to turn away, when suddenly, the instrument began to emit a high pitched whine. It had never done that before. As Albus stood up in alarm, a second monitor started to glow, then a third began spinning in place.</p>
<p>Shooting off a patronus to Minerva McGonagall and one to Severus Snape, he took a few steps towards the floo when suddenly, every instrument went still. In the ominous silence, Albus turned fearfully to look at the now dark cabinet.</p>
<p>When his  door flew open to admit Minerva in her traditional dark robes with tartan trim, closely followed by Severus, as immaculately dressed as ever, it took Albus a few moments to compose himself.</p>
<p>"I fear something may have happened to Harry Potter", he let out. "I have yet to determine what, but  my monitoring charms have recently gone haywire and are now silent. I fear a Death Eater attack."</p>
<p>"Oh, Albus, how terrible." Minerva's hand went to cover her mouth as her eyes filled with tears. "How can this have happened?"</p>
<p>"I can only assume Harry was outside the protective wards of the house when the attack occurred. His family would never have let anything happen to him while he was in the house."</p>
<p>"I suggest," Snape drawled, "that we go and check on the boy rather than standing around here speculating. Doubtless he has got himself caught up in something foolish in a desperate bid for attention, but we should investigate nevertheless."</p>
<p>"Indeed we should," Albus concurred. And so, he threw a handful of powder into the fire and  called out "12 Wisteria Walk" before stepping into the green flames.</p>
<p>They emerged into chaos. It was now around 10pm. The sound of sirens was loud even in the neighbouring street and the houses were all lit up despite the late hour, curtains twitching as nosy neighbours tried to figure out what was happening.</p>
<p>As the three professors got closer to 4 Privet Drive clad in hastily conjured muggle clothes, it was clear that the excitement was centred around there. </p>
<p>The trio were just in time to see a red-faced Vernon Dursley being led out of the house loudly protesting his innocence, or at least  protesting his arrest. Behind him and the two muggle police officers restraining him, two paramedics carried a stretcher on which they could see a small form wrapped in cloth. </p>
<p>"By Merlin's beard," Minerva whispered, tears running down her cheeks. "Albus, what on earth happened here?"</p>
<p>"An excellent  question," Albus replied and walked over to where a middle aged woman in a nightgown and robe was standing at the end of her driveway watching the proceedings with an air of equal horror at the events and glee at the drama. "Madam, I wonder if you could tell me what has gone on here." </p>
<p>The woman was only too eager to relate the entire gory tale.</p>
<p>"Mrs Pringle at number six called the police earlier this evening after she heard some strange noises coming from next door. Apparently she's called the police and social services about that house several times, but her complaints never went anywhere. She said they were neglecting  the boy who lived there.<br/>
Not their son, the other one, the nephew. Dursley always called him criminally insane, but he always seemed a pleasant enough boy to me. Didn't get on with any of the other children in the neighbourhood for sure, but never caused any trouble."</p>
<p>Snape was beginning to look somewhat irritated at the length of the story by now and asked again what had happened that evening. The woman leaned closer as if to impart a secret.</p>
<p>"Dursley killed him," she whispered. "Beat him to death. Someone overheard one of the paramedics saying he was whipped so badly he had several broken bones and he died from a punctured lung."</p>
<p>At this point, Minerva turned away and was violently sick in the bushes by the side of the path. Severus looked no better, but retained the contents of his stomach. Albus was in shock. This was not supposed to happen. Harry was supposed to attend Hogwarts broken and unhappy and latch on to Dumbledore, who would play the part of the grandfatherly mentor leading him against Voldemort. Now all those carefully laid plans were ruined.</p>
<p>"I said they were the worst sort of muggles, Albus, I said." Minerva was crying into her handkerchief.</p>
<p>"I know Minerva, but he should have been safe here. Shared blood should have kept him safe."</p>
<p>"Had you seen fit to consult  me on the boy's placement, Headmaster, I could have informed you that Petunia Dursley, ne√© Evans was a vindictive woman made bitter by her lack of magic and would not have been an appropriate guardian for any orphaned magical child." Severus interrupted. "As you were so careful to avoid telling me where the boy was placed, I can only assume you anticipated my views and decided to ignore them anyway in order to suit your own needs." At this, Minerva began to shake her head, tears coming more freely the longer Severus spoke.</p>
<p>Albus did not even attempt to defend himself against Severus' words.</p>
<p>"As such, Albus, please consider this my resignation, effective immediately. I cannot work for somebody so willing to manipulate events to their own benefit that they ignore the well-being of a single child. You have done it before with my Slytherins and now you have done it to the child of the woman I loved, a child I had sworn to protect. I am ashamed of you and of myself for failing to confirm that the boy was as happy and spoiled as you claimed all these years. Minerva, I trust you will keep him from making the same mistake again, although I believe you will have your work cut out for you." And so saying, Severus Snape stalked into an alleyway and with a sound like a car backfiring disappeared into the night, leaving Albus Dumbledore and a weeping Minerva McGonagall behind.</p>
<p>None of them noticed a small figure watching them from a few houses down with curiosity.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes to white. He appeared to be in a place surrounded by fog. He walked around for some time trying to find any kind of defining feature before he came across what looked like a playground set. Actually, it looked exactly like the set in the  park at the end of Privet Drive, except that everything looked new and shiny, not decrepit and vandalised like the ones in Privet Drive. </p>
<p>Harry sat himself on a swing and set to swinging. After a while, he noted an older man sitting on one of the benches by the slide. He had salt-and pepper hair, an immaculate goatee and was wearing a three-piece suit. Cautious of speaking to a stranger, but aware this was the only other person he had seen in this strange white place, Harry left the swings and walked over. As he got closer, he thought that the man looked familiar, but he was also sure they had never met.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir," he began. "Do you know where we are?" The other man looked down at him.</p>
<p>"We are in the between place, Harry," he replied. "We are both everywhere and no-where". Harry did not think this was a helpful answer at all, but put it down to the confusing way adults sometimes had of explaining this that only made sense later.</p>
<p>"How do you know my name?" He asked instead. "Have we met before?"</p>
<p>"Not yet little one, but you are and will be someone very important to me. By blood and by conquest, you are destined to become my Master. It has not yet happened in this timeline, but it is universal and unchangeable. Your title is therefore yours from birth."</p>
<p>"What title?"</p>
<p>"Master of Death, little one." Harry  gasped. "I am Death, and you are my Master". Harry didn't want to be anyone's master. That sounded like the slavery he had learned about in school and too much like how the Dursleys had treated him. Death seemed to know what he was thinking.</p>
<p>"Worry not, Harry. You cannot control me in that sense. I am not forced to do your bidding, nor can you compel me to do so. Being Master of Death means that I deem you worthy to be my equal. Only a certain kind of person can unite my Hallows and not be driven mad. Indeed, most who have possessed only one Hallow cannot usually control its powers and are become consumed by them before long. You are the only one who will be able to possess each Hallow without harm; the Cloak of Invisibility, the Resurrection Stone and the  Elder Wand are yours now and forever."</p>
<p>"The Elder Wand?" Harry asked. "Is that like the wands the magicians in stories use?"</p>
<p>"It is, for you are a wizard, Harry."</p>
<p>"But Aunt Petunia said magic wasn't real,‚Äù Harry protested. After accidentally overhearing a program on the television once, Harry had thought that magic might explain lots of the things he could do that Aunt Petunia called freakish. But Uncle Vernon had quickly beat that idea out of him and Aunt Petunia had called him an idiot for thinking such things were real. Then again, Harry knew that his aunt and uncle had lied about some things. He knew it was not normal for a nine-year old boy to be doing all the household chores, that it wasn‚Äôt his duty like they said it was. He also knew he wasn‚Äôt a stupid idiot, as he understood everything that happened at school and knew all the answers to all the tests, even if he had to make sure he answered the questions wrong so he wouldn‚Äôt score better than Dudley. Maybe the Dursleys had lied about that too. ‚ÄúWas she wrong?‚Äù he asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, child.‚Äù Death told him. ‚ÄúYour Aunt lied to you about magic. You see, her sister, your mother, was a talented witch and your Aunt hated not being able to do magic herself that over time she grew to hate magic itself and anything that reminded her of it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúLike me‚Äù, Harry whispered. He understood how easy it was to hate all too well, but he tried to be good and not hate things. Harry allowed himself an exception for Uncle Vernon though. In his opinion, Uncle Vernon was not worth forgiveness or compassion.</p>
<p>Thinking that was enough information to be going on with for the time being, Harry asked again about where they were. ‚ÄúWhat is the in between place, sir?‚Äù He queried. ‚ÄúBetween what and what?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBetween life and death my Master, between night and day, forward and backward, left and right. We are in the place of all things and the place of no-thing. The waiting place if you will.‚Äù Harry thought about this and then tried to remember how he came to be in the foggy playground. He remembered waiting in his cupboard for Uncle Vernon to come home, then severe pain and bleeding on the living room floor, then nothing until he was already in the playground.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was nothing to remember. Harry looked at the man who claimed to be Death.</p>
<p>"Am I dead?" Harry asked softly. Death nodded.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to say that you are. But you need not remain so. That is why we are here, not in the beyond place. You must choose your fate."</p>
<p>"Why must I choose? Choose what? How can I be dead but it not be permanent?‚Äù Death smiled at him kindly and replied that as the Master of Death, nothing was permanent for Harry. That although he was not immortal in the sense that he could not be killed, every time he died, he would face a choice about how to deal with his death. He could either return to his own body and continue with his life, or be reborn in a new world or time or even in the same place as before if he chose.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat do you think I should do, Death?‚Äù Harry asked. Death considered all that he had known of Harry James Potter in his original life, the struggles he had faced and the lessons he had learned along the way.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI would not wish to place you back in your previous body, my Master‚Äù Death told him. ‚ÄúI would have to do so very quickly after you died and that would leave you in the care of the Dursleys for the foreseeable future. Your death in this world begins a sequence of events that will stretch for generations. I would not subject you to the Dursleys again if there was no other option. However, I could make you a new body and insert you into the world again for you to observe justice for your murder and what comes next. I believe that would be the best thing for you now.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen that is what I choose!‚Äù Harry confirmed and, as Death raised his hands of Harry‚Äôs head and he felt himself fading again, he continued. ‚ÄúThank you for speaking to me and for giving me the choice. Will I see you again?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are tied together now, my Master‚Äù, Death told him. ‚ÄúI will always be with you, even when you cannot see me, and will always come when you call me. I will see you again very soon, my child. Do not fear.‚Äù Harry nodded and closed his eyes. Death‚Äôs voice faded and Harry felt himself falling for a long time, until with a sudden jolt, his eyes opened and he stared up at a street lamp and saw flashing blue sirens not too far away. He looked around himself and saw that he was in Privet Drive again, standing outside number 12 and was just in time to see Uncle Vernon being led out of the hose in handcuffs. </p>
<p>A sound like a car backfiring drew his attention to one of the houses across the street and he saw a very old man and woman in strange clothes speaking to Mrs Grantham from number 15. A whisper in his ear from Death told him these were magical folk and that he should stay away from them for now.</p>
<p>Smiling softly as he listened to Uncle Vernon‚Äôs protests as he was forced into the back seat of a police car and taken away, the boy who used to be Harry James Potter turned away from the scene and slowly walked down the dark alleyway between two houses and disappeared into the night, ready to begin his new second life.</p>
