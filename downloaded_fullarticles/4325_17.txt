  <em>Since she whom I loved hath paid her last debt</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Severus Snape opened his eyes in the Hospital Wing. It must have been close to dusk, as pale pink light streamed in from the open windows. He did not remember anything from after the Shrieking Shack. He thought he’d seen Lily—the one person who’d never demanded anything of him—demanding that he <em>live</em>. There had been something angry in her lightning green eyes.</p><p>He had served Lily willingly; he had chosen her to be his real master. Voldemort and Dumbledore had his body and his life, but Lily had always had his soul. At this very last moment she had abandoned him—rejected him again. Had he not suffered enough? Did he not deserve rest? <em>Live</em> she said, when it was the last thing he wanted. He thought of the solution of belladonna—the recipe that he’d committed to memory. Unbidden, tears sprang to his eyes.</p><p>More time passed, during which he was only aware of the wetness against his cheek, his slow but undeniable breathing, and the setting sun. He could see the stars then, the shining spirals with their hidden meanings sprawled out against the sky. The skies above Hogwarts were as clear as they had always been. If only he could get up from the bed, and stick his head out of the Hospital Wing window, he knew he would see the black lake arrayed before him, alive with the reflection of stars.</p><p>There was pain certainly, but it faded to nothing beneath the presence of his tears. Snape felt that he wanted to see the lake. It was an easy thing, to sit up, to demand the body work, to ignore the ache of bones and muscle for the sake of a whim.</p><p>Someone must have undressed him, and put him in a white hospital gown. He felt an irrational stab of embarrassment and shame at the thought that they might have seen his clammy pale skin scattered with scars, and the network of bones all too visible underneath. It was a stupid thought, of course: whoever had undressed him would’ve been too preoccupied with the blood.</p><p>Snape drew the blankets back and found the flagstones with his feet. They were cold. Tentatively, gripping the edge of the mattress, he stood up. His body, unused to the action, shook. Madam Pomfrey, or whoever had dragged him out of the Shrieking Shack, had put him at the very far end of the Hospital Wing, a partition separating his bed from the rest of the ward. The curtains were not drawn on the large, diamond paned windows. They were only five steps away. He took each step slowly and deliberately, feeling each tremor in his limbs.</p><p>The Hogwarts grounds were a marvel. Was Harry Potter dead? Who else was dead? Had Voldemort been defeated? Snape found that the riot of thoughts in his head seemed to subside slightly when he leaned his face against the cool glass. He could see the velvety blackness of the grassy slopes leading down to the lake. He could see the beech trees, their thick trunks made ghostly in the moonlight. He could see the winding paths where students of many generations had carved out walkways in the grounds. He could see the white sheen on Dumbledore’s tomb, a small speck almost near the Forbidden Forest. He could see, beyond it all, the black surface of the lake, moving according to its own forces.</p><p>Somewhere, on these grounds, others had died. Somewhere, on these grounds, history had been carved out in tiny gestures and words too little thought-out and too quickly spoken. He had left no Last Will and Testament. He should’ve always been buried here—out there—swaddled in a winding sheet. If he were dead now, perhaps they would’ve buried him behind the Anglican church in Cokeworth, interred beside his mother and father. Snape wished he did not have to think of these things. He wished he did not have to think about anything at all.</p><p>Tobias had taken him to see Severus’s grandfather’s name once, carved into the side of a slab of stone. One name, amongst a list longer than he had been tall. The grey slab had been something more than a tomb.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>When he woke, he was again lying in a bed of the Hospital Wing, sheets pulled up to his chest. The sunlight was golden this time, though the clouds over the hills suggested rain.</p><p>“What <em>were</em> you thinking! You should’ve summoned me immediately...” Madam Pomfrey’s eyes flashed, and she pointed at the small communication orb on the bedside table, “Instead I find you out of bed and slumped against the wall. You’re in no fit state to be out of bed.”</p><p>Snape opened his mouth to speak, but found that he could not make his voice work.</p><p>“Healer Smethwyck said you might have suffered damage to your throat; it may take some time to heal. Although he predicts it <em>will </em>heal. I will have him speak to you directly as soon as possible. In the meantime…” The Hogwarts Matron reached into a pocket of her robes and pulled out a small notebook and stubby pencil. “If you need anything?”</p><p><em>What happened? </em>His writing was a scrawl, his hands still unsteady.</p><p>“Voldemort is dead. And… Harry has told us of your part. I wanted to say—that is, apologise—for the way we’ve distrusted you.”</p><p>Snape grimaced and shook his head, in a way that he hoped conveyed what he meant. Then he wrote quickly: <em>Harry Potter?</em></p><p>“Harry is alive and well. He will want to speak to you himself, I’m sure. I will tell him you have woken up at last.” Madam Pomfrey smiled and pressed his hand briefly, “I am very pleased to see you awake, Severus. Rest now.”</p><p>And to his surprise, Snape felt himself slip once again into a slumber.</p><p>Darkness swirled in his dreams. There were distorted visions of fields, and thunderstorms, and tall towers. He was spinning, or walking, or lying still. He was in a castle, or a house, or at the bottom of a river. He was lying in a bed, tiredness tying his body down.</p><p>Faces swam around him. He could not see one he recognised—but an eyebrow here, and a nose there.</p><p>Lily’s eyes were set into the face of a cat. And the cat had climbed up into his bed and was mewling at him most pathetically. He reached for its ears to scratch, but it turned away. He grasped it by its tail which it didn’t like at all. It began to speak…</p><p>“Professor! Professor Snape?”</p><p>But it was not a cat at all.</p><p>Harry Potter was meant to be a dead boy. He had a dead woman’s green eyes.</p><p>“You’re awake, Professor Snape! I’m glad you’re awake.”</p><p>Snape wondered with a strange anger whether he would be the only person who could not express gratitude at being still alive—and whether he’d be subject to this over-emotional charade every time he saw anyone he knew.</p><p>Harry waited until Snape opened his eyes fully, and sat up a little in his bed.</p><p>The boy’s eyes were earnest and clear. Perhaps there was no deception in them. In the privacy of his mind, Snape could let himself feel the stuttering wish that the boy was genuine in his hope and gratitude. Perhaps—if Lily was here—she would… But she was not here; and the most he had seen of her for the past twenty years had been the delirious conjuring of blood loss and snake venom.</p><p>The rest of Harry Potter’s face was solemn. He sat stiffly on the chair beside Snape’s bed, and kept tapping his foot, as though nervous.</p><p>“Oh good, Professor! You are awake. How are you feeling?” At Snape’s flat, still sleep-riddled stare, he stumbled on, “Silly question of course. You must be feeling like, uh—that is, you must still be in pain.”</p><p>Snape nodded slightly, the movement sending tiny spasms all throughout his body.</p><p>“Madam Pomfrey said you were awake, and wanted to speak to me?”</p><p>Snape wanted to shake the boy—take him by the shoulders and demand him how he was still alive, after all that—after Dumbledore’s well-laid plans. Snape wanted to ask why he had saved him—when he hated him—when he himself had so little intention to live, after all. But these thoughts lay in a confused and heavy lump in his mind; and at any rate, his voice did not work. Instead, he scrabbled for the small notebook that the Matron had given him, and pointed to the first scribbled question on the page. <em>What happened?</em></p><p>To his great relief, Potter was not sparing in any details. Though it evidently took Harry some effort, he related all that had happened during that year—the Horcruxes, the Elder Wand—and what had happened that final night. When Harry finally fell silent, the both of them were exhausted.</p><p><em>Thank you. </em>He wrote, unhesitatingly in his notebook, and Harry nodded.</p><p><em>And for saving me. </em>Snape wrote, after a longer pause.</p><p>“It’s not really me you have to thank. It’s uh—Sirius actually. He knew what to do. He gave you Blood-Replenishing Potion and something for the wound. He brought you here and uh—saw to it that you were treated. Demanded it, in fact—quite forcefully.”</p><p>Snape closed his eyes. Harry knew it was a dismissal, yet he lingered uncertainly, looking as though he wanted to speak.</p><p><em>Say what you want.</em> Snape scrawled over the notebook.</p><p>“It’s just that… No, it’s nothing, Professor Snape. Please rest. I will come again soon.” The Boy Who Lived Despite Everyone’s Worst Intentions smiled at him.</p><p>Snape drifted again into sleep.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>A week later, Harry was indeed back by Snape’s bedside, looking cheerful.</p><p>“Madam Pomfrey said that your throat is more or less recovered. You can speak?”</p><p>Snape nodded. “Yes,” he whispered.</p><p>It was almost as if Potter had been longing to hear what Snape had to say, now that he was not obliged to listen to and follow a single one of Snape’s instructions. If only Potter had been so eager to listen when he had been a student—then he might have actually learned something. Now Snape’s voice would never fully recover—the healers from St. Mungo’s had said that the trauma had been to some extent irreversible. He would always speak in a low rasp. He could use spells to amplify his voice when needed of course, or create a magical device for doing so. As far as permanent consequences went, he had escaped lightly. He did not whether to be grateful or infuriated.</p><p>Potter was still looking at him with his head tilted, as though reading the thoughts passing through Snape’s head. The boy had picked up something of Dumbledore’s twinkling stare.</p><p>“I have something to return.”</p><p>Harry held up the vial of memories which Snape had given him when he thought he was dying. Snape’s eyes were fixated by the swirling eddies of silver—not quite liquid, not quite gas. He made no movement to take the vial, so Harry set it carefully on the bedside table. If Harry thought anything of the bare table, empty of cards or flowers from well-wishers, he said nothing of it to Snape.</p><p>“Thank you,” Harry said, “for showing them to me. I know—well—I… You told me everything at last. Anyway, thanks. I mean… I already thanked you, but I don’t know that it could be enough…”</p><p>Potter had a damnable way of stumbling over his words that eradicated any sort of sense or semblance of intelligence. But the boy was determined to plough on after all.</p><p>“I mean—I know you wouldn’t have given this to me if you thought you’d live… Lily, and your life… Dumbledore said it was the best of you—and I do believe him…”</p><p><em>So, the boy comes to the point at last.</em> “You think it disgusting,” Snape whispered.</p><p>“No! No, that’s no it at all! Your Patronus. The doe—it was, I saw it—she was beautiful. How can it be disgusting?” Harry shook his head. “That’s not what I wanted to say at all. Only that—if you want to never speak of it to me, or anyone, I understand. You won’t have to show anyone… Tell anyone about my mum—and you. The Aurors have questioned me, and Kingsley, who is currently acting Minister, has agreed that there will be no prosecution. You’re free to—well, do whatever.”</p><p>“Happy ending—nice and tidy, then isn’t it,” Snape said, and sneered.</p><p>Snape watched as the boy frowned, and then said, quite abruptly and fiercely: “Yes! It is a happy ending, you know. As it should be! Remus, Tonks, and Fred, and Colin, and Dobby—they’re all dead. But I’m happy that I’m alive—and that Ron and Hermione are alive—and that Voldemort is gone forever. I’m not naïve. Things still need fixing. But I <em>am</em> happy. That’s not wrong.”</p><p>Harry looked down, as though abashed at the speech he had just given. He sat down heavily, and ran a hand through his messy hair. “Well, I’m still trying to be happy, properly. Ginny says… Well, I’m trying okay? And <em>you</em> shouldn’t sneer. It’s not weak.”</p><p>“No, it’s not weak, Potter. I know that.” Snape found to his surprise that he honestly believed the words he had just uttered. But he was tired of this conversation; something in him seethed that begged to be let out—but he knew he could not allow it to.</p><p>“You called me a fool who wears his heart proudly on his sleeves—do you remember? During those Occlumency lessons.” Potter winced as though remembering the full, excruciating experience of those brief weeks. “And you said I should master myself. I did, in the end, though not in the way you expected.”</p><p>“You did,” Snape said, in a voice that was more sanguine than he felt.</p><p>“You succeeded in saving me—in keeping me alive.”</p><p>How could the boy be so benevolent, Snape wondered idly. He offered forgiveness so easily, like a saint who demanded no tribute and no repentance. But Snape could not easily believe that forgiveness was his to give at all.</p><p>“Uh, look. I’m—I wasn’t the greatest student and even before you—before Dumbledore died—I thought you were… Well, maybe even worse than Voldemort. I was wrong about that, Professor. I hope you can accept my apology. I don’t know that we could be friends exactly…”</p><p>“There’s not need to call me Professor, anymore, Potter.” On an impulse, Snape held out his hand, which Harry did not hesitate to shake briefly.</p><p>After a few seconds of silence, Harry snorted. “That was rather rude of me, uh, last year,” he said, a little sheepishly.</p><p>Snape laughed, a harsh rasp, but there was a little genuine mirth behind it.</p><p>Silence stretched between them, before Snape said, hesitantly, “You’re… It’s good that you’re alive Potter. Don’t—don’t put yourself in more danger than necessary.”</p><p>Harry smiled as though he understood what Snape meant exactly.</p><p>“Snape,” Harry paused, as though unused to the name, “um, I’m glad we didn’t end up shouting at each other… And I’d like it if we could, you know, talk more. Only if you wanted to though. Uh, thank you. Get well, please.”</p><p>Snape did not point out that he could no longer shout at Potter even had he wanted to. He gave the young man a nod, which Harry contented himself with.</p><p>If he turned his face a fraction, he would again be able to see the vial of memories swirling by his bedside.</p><p> </p>
