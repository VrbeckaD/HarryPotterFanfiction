  <em>Dearest Mum,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sorry, I left unannounced, but my schedule is going to be hectic during my seventh and final year at Hogwarts, and I wanted to get a head start on things. I don't want you to worry if you don't hear from me with any regularity as I plan on having my head down, studying hard, and all that. I'm going to be surrounded by friends, and all the teachers here have been very nice.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I wanted to thank you for all the love and support you've given me all these years, and I want you to know that it'll never be forgotten.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I promise that I'll return as soon as I can. I'll be fine in the meantime.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours,</em>
</p><p>
  <em><br/>
Dean</em>
</p><p align="center">—oOo—</p><p>Dean Thomas replaced the quill in its well. He held the letter up, availing himself of the scant light that eked in via the window in his small dormitory room located on the third floor of the Mudblood Relocation Camp. After proof-reading it, he set the paper atop the book that was required reading for his current state-sponsored curriculum. He frowned at the ridiculously long title imprinted on the spine:</p><p align="center">
  <em>Mudbloods and the Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society</em>
</p><p>As he finished addressing the envelope, Dean heard the jingle of keys outside, and the door to his room unlocked.</p><p>The Enforcer, dressed in black robes, entered. "On your feet, boy. You have special visitors."</p><p>He rose from his chair and stood in the centre of the room, as was required by protocol. At The Enforcer's egress, two witches entered, one a blonde, the other a brunette—pure-bloods given their manner and state of dress. They regarded Dean briefly, seemingly unimpressed.</p><p>The Brunette approached and circled behind the youth; her perfume lingered.</p><p>The Blonde remained by the threshold. "I hope this is the last one. This is not how I wanted to spend my afternoon."</p><p>The Brunette sounded annoyed by her comment. "Did I not indulge <em>you</em> when you were beside yourself with worry over <em>Draco's</em> predicament?"</p><p>Dean's eyes involuntarily lifted upon hearing the name of his former schoolmate. He immediately recognized the family resemblance in the Blonde. "You're Draco's mother!"</p><p>"Eyes down, boy," the Brunette scolded.</p><p>The Blonde glared at her. "Should we speak so familiarly in front of <em>him?"</em></p><p>"It matters not what he hears."</p><p>"Oh? You've made up your mind, then?"</p><p>"Yes... he'll do." The Brunette had lifted Dean's letter from the desk, and she began to read it. "I'll be working late at the ministry again…."</p><p>"With Umbridge?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Dreadful woman."</p><p>"Now you know why I'm so stressed. Even The Dark Lord doesn't want to deal with her directly…. I'll have the warden deliver the boy to the manor this evening, if that's all right?"</p><p>"I suppose." The Blonde rested her hands on her hips. "You know that I don't approve of this, by the way?"</p><p>The Brunette rolled her eyes. "Now you sound like <em>Maman."</em></p><p>"I do not wish to speak in front of this Muggle-born any longer. Be sure to keep him out of sight." The Blonde then left, parting with, "I'll be waiting for you by the Floo." The door closed behind her.</p><p>The room was quiet. Dean turned his eyes toward the witch as far as he dared without turning his head.</p><p>The Brunette smirked, as she felt his gaze. "Alone at last." She folded the letter and placed it back inside its envelope. "You should know that they bin the post here, <em>Dean, </em>but I'll be happy to have it delivered for you, if you like?"</p><p>The youth returned his eyes to the fore. "I'd appreciate that, ma'am."</p><p>"Although, you really shouldn't make promises that you can't keep..." She approached close enough to smell the collar on his shirt, and she sniffed loudly. "You smell like this place."</p><p>He forgot himself again. "Can't help that, now, can I?"</p><p>Her brow furrowed. "Do you know who I am?" She set eyes in front of him in order to regard him directly. "Don't you recognize me?"</p><p>"No, ma'am."</p><p>She cackled with glee. With the envelope in hand, she left the room. The door locked behind her, but it did nothing to mask her loud footfalls that echoed in the otherwise quiet hallway.</p><p>Dean returned to his seat. He cracked open the book.</p><p align="center">~o~o~o~o~O~o~o~o~o~</p><p>
  <em>BAM!</em>
</p><p>At the appointed hour Dean Apparated in front of Malfoy Manor with the assistance of two enforcers. They were met at the main gate by Peter Pettigrew, who took custody of Dean and escorted him inside the mansion.</p><p>Dean crossed the threshold and took a moment to take in the splendour of the gilded atrium with its marbled flooring and columns accented with gold. A crystal chandelier floated above that reflected the many lights and set the walls ablaze with sparkles.</p><p>Pettigrew grew impatient—"Move"—and he pushed him up the staircase.</p><p>Dean was led to a large bedroom not far from the top of the stairs. He entered and flinched when the door magically closed behind him.</p><p>A house-elf stood in the centre of the room next to a small table—the contents set atop it hidden under a metal lid—and he beckoned the human.</p><p>Dean obeyed, and he was seated at the table. The elf removed the lid showcasing a hearty meal worthy of the palate of a pure-blood elite.</p><p>"Eat," the elf said. He smiled as the human greedily tore into the food as if he had not eaten in a week. The elf retrieved a bottle of Merlot and filled the wine glass. The youth took the proffered glass, but he hesitated; this made the elf frown. "Is there something wrong? I assure you it's a quality vintage."</p><p>"I'm sure, but I'm not old enough to drink wine. I'm only seventeen."</p><p>"Please, sir. If you don't partake, <em>Madam Lestrange</em> will be very upset."</p><p>"Lestrange?" Dean gasped upon hearing the infamous surname. "As in <em>Bellatrix</em> Lestrange?"</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>Dean swallowed the lump in his throat. "Merlin." And he drank, grimacing at the unfamiliar, acrid taste.</p><p>Relieved, the elf smiled. "I'll draw you a bath when you're finished."</p><p>"Not to sound ungrateful, but why?"</p><p>"My mistress has instructed me to have you bathed and fed." He started for the bathroom. "Will you require assistance with the razor?"</p><p>"I can manage on my own, thanks."</p><p>The sumptuous meal put Dean in good spirits, and he proceeded to bathe, indulging himself in a long hot bath. That, and a proper shave, made him feel like a new man. He left the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist, and he was stilled when he saw Bellatrix Lestrange seated at the small dinner table, waiting patiently while she sipped on a glass of wine. The elf remained by the exit, motionless like a statue.</p><p>When he naturally made a go for his clothes, Bellatrix spoke. "Stay where you are."</p><p>Dean obeyed, and she rose from the chair, glass in hand.</p><p>She approached slowly, regarding him as one would inspect a ripened piece of fruit, and she sniffed him. "Much improved… worthy of an audience with your betters." She completed the circuit and returned to her seat. "I sent your letter, by the way."</p><p>"Cheers."</p><p>"So, you know Draco… I take it that you used to attend Hogwarts?"</p><p>"Yes, ma'am."</p><p>"Do you know Harry Potter?"</p><p>"I know <em>of</em> him," he said, lying.</p><p>She grunted and continued to eye him up-and-down as she drummed her steepled fingers together. "Dignity is a privilege here."</p><p>"Sorry?"</p><p>"Remove your towel."</p><p>"And if I refuse?"</p><p>She shrugged. "Then I'll kill you."</p><p>He wisely discarded the towel, and she lowered her gaze, raising an eyebrow as the youth's hands were not big enough to completely cover his shame. She slowly waved her wand, and his hands magically clasped behind his back.</p><p>She smirked. "What's your name again, boy?"</p><p>"I'm not a boy."</p><p>"Gryffindor..." She snorted. "The arrogance embedded in your tone gives you away. You mistake it for courage, but it is a false courage, particularly with you males." She brought the glass to her nose, smelling the fruity contents therein before taking another sip. "You see, the only courage your lot understands is physical courage. True courage is putting your convictions into action in order to do what is right."</p><p>"To do what is right... or what is easy?"</p><p>Her smile was genuine. "You are <em>so</em> adorable: almost a man." She rose from her chair, tapping the tip of her wand in her open palm like a riding crop. "Tell me, did Dumbledore have you on your knees with his hands on the back of your head as he pumped his ideology down your throat?"</p><p>Dean did not respond.</p><p>"The strong silent type too." She levelled her wand. <em>"Avada Kedavra!"</em> Dean flinched when her killing curse whizzed by his head, missing him by mere inches, and finding its mark on a bat perched on the mantle behind him. The animal fell to the floor. "I hate bats. Azkaban was filled with them: rats with wings."</p><p>She gave a sideways nod toward her faithful house-elf, and he removed the dead rodent. "Did the boy drink his wine?"</p><p>"Yes, mistress."</p><p>"Good. Leave us."</p><p>She laid her wand on the table so as to remove her dress unencumbered, retaining her burgundy silk chemise suspended by spaghetti straps. Her back was turned to him as she rested her foot on the chair in order to adjust the strap on her stiletto boot. Her hands smoothed out the ripples in the sheer black stockings that hugged her legs.</p><p>It grew warm in Dean's core.</p><p>Her breasts swayed underneath the fabric as she ran her finders through her silky raven hair. "Fourteen years is such a long time, especially in Azkaban. But the experience has taught me not to take the finer pleasures of life for granted." She regarded him over her shoulder, then turned to face him. "Do you have a girlfriend, Gryffindor?" As she approached, she frowned at his continued reticence. "Answer me."</p><p>"No, ma'am."</p><p>She casually walked behind him, verifying that his hands were still magically bound. "Have you ever lain with a woman?"</p><p>He hesitated before answering, "N-no."</p><p>She came upon him obliquely, tracing her wand's tip across his shoulders. Her attentions moved lower down his torso and past his waist. He flinched when she reached her destination. The uniquely curved walnut shaft of her wand glowed a dull yellow, and it lightly graced his most sensitive skin as she invoked:</p><p>"<em>Prophylactuus..."</em></p><p>He swallowed.</p><p>"Do you find me attractive?" She diverted her eyes away from her busy wand-work to meet his nervous gaze. "I asked you a question, Gryffindor."</p><p>"No."</p><p>She brought her wand to her lips, and she tasted its now pungent tip. "Liar."</p><p>She walked over to the bed, stopping at the corner to lean against the bedpost. When she snapped her fingers, Dean sensed that the magic that bound his hands had dissipated, and they hung freely at his sides. However, his freedom was short-lived, as he felt a prickly sensation all over his body. Her voice boomed inside his head:</p><p>
  <em>Come… tend to me.</em>
</p><p>He winced but did not otherwise move.</p><p>"You impress me with your resistance to my Imperius Curse, Gryffindor, but even if Azkaban's Dementors could not break my will after fourteen years... what chance have <em>you?" </em>She reasserted herself:</p><p>
  <em>Tend to me.</em>
</p><p>Dean could feel her dark influence permeate his flesh. It was intoxicating. He found his feet moving his body toward the bed, though he did not recall commanding them to do so. He came upon her and was moved to brush her hair aside in order to behold her face, made gentle by her lack of outward expression, and he stared into her dark eyes intently.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip.</p><p>His blood surged.</p><p>His steady fingers glided from her face to the downward slope of her neck. The thin straps that held up her chemise snagged on his fingertips and were cast aside when his touch travelled across her slight shoulders.</p><p>The laced garment fell around her ankles.</p><p>He brought his lips to her neck, but was stilled when his nose detected an odd scent. His tongue found the special spot below her ear, and he kissed it.</p><p>Her hands reached behind his neck, and she held his head fast as his lips suckled at her salty, tangy skin, leaving behind a purple bruise.</p><p>The Imperius Curse, allied with his raging hormones, murdered his inhibition, and he pushed her onto the bed.</p><p>She landed on her bum, giggling like a schoolgirl.</p><p>Dean knelt and took hold of one of her boots. At his magical gaze, its laces were made unentwin'd, and he removed it along with its mate. He unclipped the stockings on her leg, bound to her garter belt, and slowly unrolled it, exposing the goosebumps on her flesh. He took her dainty foot in his hands, the bottom of which was callused from her time in Azkaban, and he massaged it expertly.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered, and her lips made an involuntary smile. "You require no instruction… you lied to me when you said you hadn't been with a woman."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am."</p><p>She leaned back, resting on her elbows. "There are no secrets from me, Dean Thomas of Dumbledore's Army. Who have you 'known' before me?"</p><p>"R-rita S-s-skeeter."</p><p>Bellatrix laughed out loud. <em>"Naughty…</em> I knew there was something different about you when we first locked eyes." She reclined, the back of her hand alit on her forehead, and she sighed in contentment.</p><p>By this time her other limb had been made bare in similar fashion. Her semi-willing lover's hands explored the pale skin of her smooth legs—the engorged lips at their apex grew damp. The fabric darkened at the crotch of her knickers.</p><p>"Mmmm… That busybody cow taught you well." She brandished her wand:</p><p>
  <em>Kiss me, Tom.</em>
</p><p>Unawares, Dean assumed that she had merely truncated his surname 'Thomas' and thus began his oral exploration at her painted toes. Bellatrix took her wand's curved shaft in her teeth and bit down hard as Dean's busy lips and hands journeyed methodically along her person.</p><p align="center">—oOo—</p><p>Outside, Peter Pettigrew stood guard in the hallway. His attention was roused by odd sounds originating from inside Bellatrix's quarters. He knelt, and with one eye squinting, peered through the keyhole. Though his vantage point could not afford him a direct view, he was able to make out a shadow cast adjacently of splayed feminine legs with toes pointed toward opposite facing walls.</p><p>The former marauder sneered.</p>
