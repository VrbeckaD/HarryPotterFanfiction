<p>It was mid-June and the weather was splendid, a gentle breeze coming through the open roll-top garage doors that lined one side of Remus' favorite coffee shop. Not enough to disturb the stack of papers he was furiously working through in order to submit end of term grades, but enough to keep the air from feeling stagnant and stifling, like it was wont to as the summer wore on.</p>
<p>Or rather, he should have still be furiously grading papers, but found himself distracted. Between the early morning birds chirping and the nice weather, he wished he was out enjoying a walk rather than being stuck working. At least, that's what he told himself was distracting him, even as he stared at the shop's baker who appeared to be slowly losing his mind.</p>
<p>"Of course I'll be there Mum... no, no one is coming with me." The man heaved a great sigh, running flour covered fingers through long, ink black hair, leaving behind white smudges.</p>
<p>"I'm not lonely, Mum, stop worrying about me so much."</p>
<p>Remus' lip twitched as he fought off a chuckle, thinking of all the times he'd had the same argument with his own mother. He wasn't lonely, thank you very much, and he didn't have time for anyone else, anyway. Most non-teachers didn't understand the strain and couldn't cope with the amount of work and baggage that he had to tote home everyday with him. It was exhausting explaining why he couldn't go out for drinks on a Tuesday night, and yes it would really take all night to grade 60 english lit essays, and no he wouldn't just assign random grades and call it good enough.</p>
<p>It didn't seem worth it to him to even bother trying anymore. Not to mention any of his other... <em>complications</em> in finding someone.</p>
<p>"Uh huh, yeah, I <em>am</em> dating someone. I just- I just don't feel like it's at that point in the relationship where I should bring them on a family outing, ya know?"</p>
<p>He could tell the man was grasping at straws, hands in the air gesturing wildly, although his mother on the phone had no way of seeing it. He guessed she probably knew though, considering he was animated in everything he did, from what Remus had seen of him.</p>
<p>"Oh. Nine months, yeah... I guess that sounds about right, huh." The man froze, arm falling limply at his side as he seemed to realize something. Remus barely caught the muttered "oh bugger," before watching as the poor guy banged his head repeatedly on the counter.</p>
<p>Still face down, with his other arm draped dramatically across the surface, Remus didn't bother hiding his grin at the poor man's distress. "No! Of course not, Effie, that's not it at all- how could I possibly be embarrassed of him meeting you?"</p>
<p>Righting himself, Remus wasn't quick enough to hide his smile or look away. Caught, the baker narrowed his eyes threateningly at him, refusing to let him off the hook. "Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm sure it'll be great." He finally broke eye contact to run his hand down his face in defeat. "Love you too."</p>
<p>As soon as he hung up his mobile, he zeroed back in on Remus, the only person in the shop this early. "Do you enjoy laughing at another man's pain?"</p>
<p>Although he should probably be worried by the threatening look directed his way, he couldn't help giving in to a sheepish smile. "Only when I've been in his shoes and am grateful it's not my mum having the conversation for once."</p>
<p>This seemed to be an adequate response, as the man's shoulders dropped in defeat. He hopped up on the counter, before swinging his legs to the other side, idly tapping them against the wood, his fingers drumming in thought.</p>
<p>He was quiet for long enough that Remus figured he should look away and maybe get back to these final exams that were not going to grade themselves by noon tomorrow. He only got through one though before interrupted again.</p>
<p>"How do you feel about gay guys?"</p>
<p>Startled by the question, Remus drew his eyebrows together in confusion, before remembering the earlier mention of introducing <em>him</em> to his mother. "Well, I'm bisexual, so they're pretty alright."</p>
<p>The baker nodded, running his fingers through his hair again, the roots now more grey than black from the amount of flour he'd managed to transfer into it. Remus couldn't help but think it's a shame he's taken, although he isn't at all surprised. His long black hair framed sharp, angular features, bright grey eyes and a full lower lip currently trapped between his teeth.</p>
<p>Realizing he'd probably been staring at the other man's lip for a moment or two longer than he should have, Remus looked away, pretending to return to grading but not really seeing the paper in front of him. He didn't look up when boots hit the ground as the other man jumped off the counter, sauntering over and dropping into the seat across from him at the small cafe table.</p>
<p>"You're a teacher."</p>
<p>It wasn't a question, but Remus hums an affirmative anyway.</p>
<p>"So you don't work over the summer, yeah?"</p>
<p>Eyes darted up, but quickly back down to the paper in front of him. "That's right. After I submit final grades tomorrow, I'm finished until the fall semester starts up."</p>
<p>The other man hummed and Remus thought he should <em>really</em> find a way to focus, because he'd been staring at this paper doing nothing for quite a while and was pretty sure the guy would realize he wasn't actually working and that would be rather embarrassing.</p>
<p>"Teachers are paid pretty shit."</p>
<p>"What, and bakers are better?" He can't help the defensive response from slipping out and feels his face heat up at the startled laugh elicited from the other.</p>
<p>Looking up, he saw those grey eyes studying him and blushed even more. He'd always hated that, how easily he flustered. Normally quick witted, intelligent even, and fluently sarcastic, but put him under a spotlight of attention from a pretty face and he couldn't seem to keep himself together.</p>
<p>"Was there something you needed?"</p>
<p>His eyes glanced down at the quirk of lips across from him before focusing back on his eyes and praying the other didn't notice.</p>
<p>"Yes, actually, there was." He leaned back and crossed his arms over his chest and Remus couldn't help but notice how fit his arms were and please for the love of god, brain, focus. Those grey eyes were still locked on his, never straying from his face. Remus wasn't sure if he should be glad he seemed oblivious to his flustered glances and too long stares, or put off that he didn't appear to have any effect on the other man. "I will pay you to be my boyfriend for a family trip."</p>
<p>Remus must have looked as startled and skeptical as he felt, because the other man continued before he could even voice his question of<em> what the fuck.</em></p>
<p>"As I'm sure you deduced from eavesdropping on my conversation, my lovely adoptive mother is under the impression I have a boyfriend. And apparently I've been lying and saying that for nine months now, which she insists is more than enough time to invite along for our annual summer trip, and honestly I don't have a defense for that, which doesn't involve 'I lied and don't have a boyfriend'. Which all started because she's convinced I'm horribly lonely and wouldn't stop volunteering me for dates with every bent bloke she could find in a forty km radius." He finished with a charming smile, sprinkled with only a hint of desperation, and that was honestly the impressive part to Remus.</p>
<p>"How did you not realize it had been nine months?"</p>
<p>Apparently this question wasn't appreciated, because he promptly slammed his head back down onto the table and Remus' papers, letting out a strangled groan.</p>
<p>"I mean, after like, three, you say 'oh right I broke up with that bloke and started seeing someone new' and keep doing that and it's never serious enough for her to want to meet him."</p>
<p>"Yes, thank you for that stellar advice, now can I borrow your time machine so I can go back and do that and not be in this situation?" Lifting his head, his face was far too close to Remus' for absolute comfort. Remus held his breath but was just met with a deadpanned, "oh, wait."</p>
<p>"Touché," he muttered. "Also, you don't seem like the type to not have a boyfriend for nine months."</p>
<p>There was a flash of something across his face, and his eyes grew steely and cold. Remus quickly threw his hands up in surrender, "not- not like that! I just meant. Well. I mean, you're very obviously attractive so this doesn't seem like a problem I would expect you to have?"</p>
<p>His face relaxed and Remus breathed a sigh of relief. Leaning back and crossing his arms in a pout, the man studied him. "Teachers have to budget like nuts because you only get paid nine months out of the year. I know you can use the extra cash. Well, I don't know but I figure it couldn't hurt. You aren't against being seen with a bloke, so that's not the problem. Give me one reason."</p>
<p>"Well I don't know your name, for starters."</p>
<p>He pulled a face, clearly displeased with the answer, "please, random people fuck all the time without knowing someone's name."</p>
<p>Remus smiled, "ah, but we're not just fucking, are we? We're madly in love after nine months of slow burning romance." It was disturbing how attractive this guy was when he pouted. Disturbing and unfair.</p>
<p>"Sirius."</p>
<p>"Pardon?"</p>
<p>"My name is Sirius." He looked away, fiddling with the sleeve of his shirt. "Like the star."</p>
<p>"Well, Sirius like the star, my name's Remus," he paused, wondering if he was really going to say yes to this obviously insane idea. "And you're not wrong that I could use the money."</p>
<p>Sirius sat up, his face bright as a puppy who was told they were going to the park. "Really?"</p>
<p>"Really, I could use the money, but I didn't say yes." Remus chewed his lip nervously. "Tell me about this trip and what all this would entail."</p>
<p>Sirius leaned forward excitedly, "my parents own a vacation house, 'bout 8 hour drive from here. On the beach, has a boat, private community, all that jazz. So for the most part it would be a two week paid vacation for you to lay on the sand and catch some rays." For the first time since sitting down, his eyes trailed over Remus' body, "which you could use."</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>"You would have to play the role, of course, of my lovely boyfriend. Casual touches, know facts about me, etcetera, etcetera. The only big thing is that this always coincides with a charity ball that my mum organizes, so we'll have to attend that one night. Besides that, smooth sailing."</p>
<p>He had the audacity to wink at his pun.</p>
<p>"You'd actually pay me to lay on a beach and do nothing for two weeks?" There clearly had to be some catch to this.</p>
<p>"Actually I'm paying you to pretend to date me. Let's say five thousand quid?"</p>
<p>"Five thousand?!" His mind swam, that was roughly <em>two months</em> his usual salary. Every year over the summer he had to pick up tutoring jobs just to pay his bills, with barely enough left over to live off more than the two for a quid zucchini he found at a farmer's market.</p>
<p>Seemingly unaware of Remus' internal whirlwind, Sirius continued, "what, is that not fair? Two weeks you have to put up with me and my nonsense. Not to mention you haven't even met James yet..."</p>
<p>"James?"</p>
<p>"Oh, my brother. He and his wife come as well. Oh, gods, you'll love Lily, this is going to be terrible." Resting his elbow on his other arm, he taped his chin in thought. "Well, that's a problem for me, not you. And five thousand can go a long way to cover your expenses for the summer, yeah?"</p>
<p>Remus nodded mutely. He couldn't afford not to, and there was no chance an offer like this would ever again cross his path. He resolutely ignored the whisper in the back of his mind that it would give him the chance to get to know the baker better than the wistful weekend stares had allowed him to over the past year or so. Chewing his lip in thought, he decided he should at least add one qualifier. "No sex," he stated, not leaving it open to a question.</p>
<p>An unreadable mask slipped over Sirius' face, but Remus met his eyes resolutely. "No sex. So, unless you have any objections?" He rose to his feet. "Oh, do you own a tux?"</p>
<p>Pinned under that silvery gaze, already framed by laugh lines despite his young age, Remus took a deep breath as if diving off the deep end. "Yeah. Yeah, I think I do. When do we leave?"</p>
<p>Bright white, even teeth flashed in a blinding smile. "Day after tomorrow. On the road by 8, we'll pick you up." Grabbing a napkin and Remus' pen, he jotted down a phone number and laid it on the stack of papers, before leaning down to place a kiss on his cheek. It was fleeting, the barest brush of lips and clearly platonic affection, but was enough to send chills through Remus' body. "Text me your address. You won't regret it, Remus."</p>
<p>Remus watched him disappear back into the kitchen, to do whatever it was he should have been doing all along, and leaving Remus with new motivation to finish his own work, and feelings to sift through at a much later, undetermined time.</p>
