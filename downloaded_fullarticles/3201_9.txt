    <p>Harry Potter and the Alchemists</p>
<p>Snarling in annoyance Harry threw up a belated shield charm “Protego!” while at the same time sidestepping the next two low powered Knockback jinx's that came zipping his way. Keeping the shield up Harry backed up several paces to make some distance between him and his opponent. Who uttered no sound as he flicked his long ivory wand again, sending three more jinx’s Harry’s way. </p>
<p>The third jinx shattered Harry’s shield but didn’t have enough power after to do more than tap him lightly like a house-elf trying to get his attention, since his wand was now free Harry went on the offense “Expelliarmus!— Impedimenta! —  Stupefy!” He shouted, hoping the combination would give him a moment's reprieve, it did.</p>
<p>Wile Harry’s opponent, Nicolas, dealt with the basic but effective attack he followed it up with a shouted “Fulmena!” and then another “Protego” as Nicolas dodged or blocked his spells and returned in kind. </p>
<p>A soft female voice, magically magnified to reach them from the cottage two hundred yards away, broke in and caused both man and boy alike to instantly freeze “That's enough now you two— it's time for breakfast.”</p>
<p>    Marching orders received and seeing that neither of them wanted to incur the wrath of the most accomplished Vexer in Wizarding History, Harry Potter and Nicolas Flamel turned and headed for the cottage. </p>
<p>It had been two weeks since Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel showed up at No. 4 Privet Drive two days into Harry's summer vacation. Originally they had intended to thank young Harry Potter for helping resolve the situation they had been responsible for causing by entrusting Dumbledore with the Sorcerer's Stone. What had been intended as a quick thank you 'nice cup of tea' sort of meeting had turned rather ugly in short order.</p>
<p>As soon as the pair of centuries-old mages entered Number Four they appeared to be one of those charming older couples one sees sitting on a sunny park bench in the fall. They had white hair, faces creased from decades of smiling, and both wore several layers of sweaters and shawls even though it was early summer.  In short, they were the picture of an aged and harmless couple.</p>
<p>Even as Petunia had opened the door they sensed something was very, very wrong behind it. The house bore the unmistakable stench of pain, fear, and hopelessness. As such, they prepared themselves for the worst and surreptitiously wrapped their 'frail' hands around their wand hilts. </p>
<p>Over the past centuries, the Flamels had born witness to countless tragedies, every sort of violence, and every flavor of evil imaginable. When they saw Harry halfway into his cupboard to hide, as he was supposed to whenever someone came calling, all it took was for their eyes to meet for them to make a decision that would forever alter Harry Potter's future.</p>
<p>A year at Hogwarts, a year which included encounters with enumerable deadly nasties had allowed Harry to see a lot of magic. Most of what he saw was beautiful and awe-inspiring,  aside from when dealing with Quirrell he'd had only one other opportunity to see any truly frightening magic. He had been on his way to lunch when just ahead of him in the hallway a Slytherin prefect began bullying a Hufflepuff first year. The prefect had just drawn out his wand when no less than a half dozen third-year Hufflepuffs appeared out of the crowd and surrounded him. By the time a teacher appeared the Hufflepuffs had all disappeared and it took Madam Pomfrey three weeks to set the Prefect right, and that was only after calling in a Gringotts curse breaker.</p>
<p>Even that magic had been beautiful to Harry in a simple way, the bolts of light impacting the Prefect had at least been brightly colored and full of wit. There was none of that when he saw the Flamels draw their wands and send identical curses at his aunt and uncle. The flashes of purple light were neither beautiful nor comforting to young Harry as Petunia and Vernon howled in agony. Instead, Harry felt his skin crawl and stomach flip as some of the spells' excess magic leaked out into the room. </p>
<p>With another flick of their wands, the Flamels dispelled their disguises and Harry gasped when the two were revealed to be about as far from weak and feeble as Fluffy.</p>
<p>Mr. Flamel was not a tall man but had a broad barrel chest and square shoulders. He was adorned in flowing white robes embroidered with rich gold and silver thread that flashed with power. The bright clothes were, perhaps purposefully, in sharp contrast to his deeply tanned olive skin and jet black ponytail and beard that was only lightly dusted with strands of silver. </p>
<p>Mrs. Flamel was a vision, even with the fires of hell burning behind her eyes as she glared down at the moaning Dursleys. In contrast to her husband she wore satin black robes, though they to were embroidered with silver thread that seemed to glow with power. Again like her husband the robes contrasted with her complexion, though unlike him she was fair with alabaster skin and honey blond hair cut fashionably short.</p>
<p>Harry recognized Nicolas Flamel from his chocolate frog card and from the research he, Ron, and Hermione had done on the Sorcerer's stone. So he was not caught off guard when Mr. Flamel introduced himself over the writhing Dursleys "Mister Potter I do apologize for our entrance but please let me introduce myself-- I am Nicolas Flamel and this is my wife Perenelle Flamel we are at your service."</p>
<p>"I hope we were right in assuming these" Perenelle motioned to the Dursleys "are the ones responsible for your current state?" here words though full of concern maintained a sharp undertone that made Harry very glad to not be the target of her ire. </p>
<p>"My current state?" Harry asked, very confused and feeling more nervous by the second. He had no sympathy for his aunt and uncle and was perfectly happy to let the writhe in pain. What had Harry concerned was that the Flamels radiated more magical power than anyone he'd ever seen, including Quirldemort and Dumbledore, and they both seemed seconds away from losing control.</p>
<p>"Yes," Perenelle affirmed "Malnourished, underpowered, injured, and severely traumatized." She meant to be gentle, but she had never really been able to escape her French ire like Nicolas had. She would always favor the rod to the word. </p>
<p>Blushing furiously Harry's eyes snapped to his feat for the shame of this Witch calling him weak [You really are useless Potter] he thought for the umpteenth time.</p>
<p>"Here now-- none of that" Perenelle snapped as she saw the talons of depression begin sinking into the boy "You're stronger than that Mister Potter-- now hold your head high and face this head on"</p>
<p>For a brief moment Harry was afraid Mrs. Flamel could read his mind, but then he looked up and saw the kind smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. [Not reading your mind-- just very clever] with this realization Harry steeled himself just as he had when facing Quirldemort. </p>
<p>“That's it, my boy!" Nicolas said heartily as the boy squared his shoulders and met their gaze, then his voice turned as dark as his scowl as he asked: "now please tell us-- was it your aunt and uncle who hurt you?" </p>
<p>Sucking in a deep breath for strength Harry nodded and replied: "Yes, both of them"</p>
<p>"Does Dumbledore know?" Nicolas asked, his frown somehow deepening. </p>
<p>Harry just shrugged at that "I don't know how he couldn't-- I mean if it was so obvious to you both I can't see how he could have missed it"</p>
<p>Perenelle surprised Harry by snorting at his words "I wouldn't be so sure of that-- young Albus always had a hard time seeing the trees for the forest and he always had very skewed ideas of what is appropriate for children"</p>
<p>These words Harry was willing to admit shocked him, it was a rare thing to find any witch, wizard, or any other being that would speak of Dumbledore in anything short of a reverent tone. Yet here were the Flamels, some of his oldest friends, talking as if he were as much a foolish schoolboy as Harry.  </p>
<p>"So what will it be Potter-- should we torment them some more? Take their heads? Wipe their memories and leave them drooling idiots?" Nicolas asked, a glint of malicious steel showing through behind his kind eyes. </p>
<p>To Harry's surprise (It was a day for being surprised) he seriously considered all three options [Well they did just about as bad to you over the years] it was a thin enough excuse Harry had to admit, so he bartered for time and asked: "What did you do to them before?"</p>
<p>Once again Perenelle showed just how cold she could be when a mirthless chuckle escape her lips as Nicolas explained: "Ah that-- Speculum Date Illi Tormentum-- a handy bit of old magic that makes you feel all the pain you have caused others"</p>
<p>"Must not be very strong?" Harry said as he looked down at the still whimpering Dursleys and recalled all the times he'd been beaten unconscious only to wake up days later in the cupboards, all the broken bones, and cigar burns.</p>
<p>"Oh they won't feel it all at once-- it is a true curse that will torment them until they die" Perenelle assured him "And unless they somehow convince a Goblin Curse Breaker to help them no one will be able to remove it"</p>
<p>Nicolas harrumphed at that "Considering how Goblins feel about protecting children of any species the odds of that happening are less than impossible"</p>
<p>By then Harry had made up his mind about what he wanted "Mr. Flamel, Mrs. Flamel can you just erase their memories of me?" He had no idea where he would go afterward, but anywhere was better than Privet drive, maybe there was a wizarding orphanage?</p>
<p>"Ha just like his father," Perenelle said, this time her burst of laughter had some mirth behind it, it was one of the most beautiful sounds Harry had ever heard.</p>
<p>"Too kind for his own good," Nicolas said, nodding his head in agreement "But if he was like Lily he'd already be on trial for hexing them into oblivion"</p>
<p>"You knew my mum and dad?" Harry asked, not shocked as he'd by then already realized how many wizards and witches had known them, but from the way the Flamels talking it sounded like they were more than passing acquaintances.</p>
<p>"More than knew them" Nicolas replied "I was James' godfather"</p>
<p>"And Lily was our apprentice before they went into hiding" Pitched in Perenelle "She really was the most gifted alchemist in centuries" she added sadly. </p>
<p>"But back to more pressing affairs" Nicolas suddenly broke in, bringing their attention back to the Dursleys, "I think a nice memory charm should do the trick-- Obliviate Maxima!" He finished, barking the spell in what was almost a roar and flicking his was at the Dursleys. </p>
<p>There was a flash of searing white light that left Harry unscathed, but his Aunt and Uncle lay unconscious and drooling on the floor.</p>
<p>"There we go," Perenelle said with a smile "Now I think a butterbeer and the Leaky Cauldron along with a nice long chat is in order" she added. </p>
<p>"Yes but before we go" Nicolas paused to grin at Harry before calling out politely "Oh Folly would you please join us"</p>
<p>A soft pop heralded the arrival of a very clean house elf, she wore a silver and gold uniform embroidered with the Flamel family crest on back and chest, but other than that look like any of the Hogwarts elves Harry had seen.  </p>
<p>"What can Folly do for Master and Mistress?" the little elf asked, her voice little more than a squeak.</p>
<p>"Please pack up Mr. Potter's things and put them in the spare room would you?" Perenelle asked the elf, she had already figured out her husband's plan and added to it some of her signature... efficiency.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Harry was letting his first Butterbeer calm his stomach after his first side along apparition, the former he enjoyed, the latter he would in future avoid. Harry was also answering a barrage of questions being asked first by the Flamels, who once again looked elderly and feeble, but soon a Gringotts Solicitor joined them and added to the mountain of questions. </p>
<p>By the time it was over evening was fast approaching and Harry's head was beginning to spin. Even so, the Flamels and the Gringotts goblin weren't done yet. After Nicolas gave him a Pepperup Potion, which Harry had to admit helped quite a lot, the group walked to Gringotts. Though the bank's walk-in business hours were over serious business such as theirs could be attended to twenty-four hours a day.</p>
<p>After being ushered into a small but quite well-appointed office Harry was greeted by a seemingly young Goblin who did his best to appear kind and non-threatening. He appreciated the as no one was allowed to witness what came next. The Goblin, who introduced himself as Ragnar, took out from his desk a small cube of steel which after being tapped three times split open to reveal a simple golden ring. </p>
<p>"Take the ring Mister Potter and place it on your left ring finger," instructed Ragnar. </p>
<p>Obediently Harry reached out and plucked the ring off Ragnar's desk, while he did so he missed the gleam of excitement in the Goblin's eyes as the ring allowed him to do so, and slipped it on the proper finger.  As he did so Harry grinned when he saw the gold band shrink to fit his frail finger, magic really was brilliant. </p>
<p>Ragnar seemed to wait for a beat before a true goblin smile spread across his face, not the most comforting expression to be sure but still a happy one and spoke in a formal tone: "Welcome back to the Wizarding World Lord Potter"</p>
<p>"Lord?" Harry asked, now thoroughly confused.</p>
<p>"Indeed sir-- you are head of House Potter-- and are thus one of the thirty ancient wizarding houses of Britain-- I am sure the library of Potter Keep or that of Hogwarts will hold the answers to your other questions" Answered Ragnar, a mischievous smile now playing across his face before he continued "Now for the blood test I will, of course, nee seven drops of blood"</p>
<p>Nodding, Harry had been warned of this beforehand, he held out his wand hand and let Ragnar prick his finger with the tip of a small knife. The blade was so sharp Harry didn't feel a thing at first and by the time it began to sting Ragnar had already cast a healing charm and closed the cut. </p>
<p>The seven drops of blood had fallen onto an iron dish and sizzled as if it were hot, though no steam rose up. Soon the blood was gone and in its place appeared a small scroll. This time Harry saw Ragnar's expression change, to one of confusion, as he picked it up and began to read. </p>
<p>"Well Lord Potter it seems you are the heir to two more estates--" Ragnar paused to reread the parchment then continued now obviously confused "One, the Black estate, I am quite familiar with but the other-- I have never read of or heard of it before which is most odd as ever Gringotts Goblin knows the owner of every named vault-- please wait while I call my chief"</p>
<p>Harry sat silently, turning the ring on his finger around and around while marveling at how well it fit. His father had worn this same ring, and his father before him.  Nicolas had mentioned the Potters could trace their family all the way back to the twelfth century and had noted that they were a well known and respected house even when he himself was a boy. It sparked Harry's imagination, thinking of all the Potters who, just like him, had worn that ring. If he ever had a son they too would wear it, and their son's after them. </p>
<p>For so long Harry had thought he was along, he'd thought that he did not matter, that no one would notice or care that he was gone if he died. Now, for the first time, he truly understood that to be untrue. Even if no one mourned Harry the muggle raised boy, they would mourn the loss of Harry Lord of Noble and most Ancient House Potter. Now he had hope, now he had pride.</p>
<p>Harry was so lost in thought he did not notice Ragnar's return until the heavy iron door clanged shut behind him and a second much older Goblin.  "Is all well Lord Potter?" Ragnar asked.</p>
<p>"No I'm fine thank you" Harry replied, the smile he graced the goblins with was perhaps the truest and most tainted he'd ever given anyone in his short life. </p>
<p>"Very good-- Lord Potter may I introduce Chief Ulluk keeper of Secrets for Gringotts," Ragnar said, bowing first to Harry then to the Chief. </p>
<p>"Nice to meet you Chief Ulluk," Harry said, immediately standing and giving the elderly goblin a short bow. </p>
<p>"The pleasure is truly mine Lord Potter" Ulluk replied as he returned the bow "Now let us see why young Ragnar has put all of Gringotts aflutter with gossip"</p>
<p>Without another word, Ulluk took the scroll from Ragnar's desk. After glancing it over only once he seemed to stiffen and took in a harsh gasp before seeming to catch himself and forcibly relax. </p>
<p>"Well the first of these is fairly simple," Ulluk said and snapped his finger once before reaching into Ragnar's desk and pulling out another cube. </p>
<p>Same as the first one Ulluk split the cube open to reveal a ring, this one was silver with a small obsidian skull mounted in a setting of tinny emeralds. Again Harry picked up the ring and this time slid it onto his right ring finger, as he did so the ring shrank to fit just as the Potter ring had. </p>
<p>"Welcome to Gringotts Lord Black," Ulluk said "As of now you are Lord and soul mail heir of the noble and most ancient house of Black"</p>
<p>Harry wanted to say something, really truly confused now, but Ulluk seemed to be a goblin on a mission. "Lord Potter-Black for the second matter of business we will leave Ragnar and travel down to the vaults-- with your permission, I will shift us to the lowest level as it would take us several hours to reach there by trolly"</p>
<p>"Very well you have my permission," Harry said, even after only a year in the world of magic Harry had learned the two most important rules to wizard survival. First, never poke a dragon, sleeping or otherwise. Second, goblins can be trusted with your life as well as your gold, just never cross them. </p>
<p>Without another word, Ulluk took Harry's hand and shifted them. Harry had been expecting the disturbing and painful process of apparition, he was happily disappointed, instead all that happened was the world seemed to blur and flow around them until it resolidified into a hallway deep underground. He could see that a door behind them lead out to the trolly track but that seemed to be the only door, he was about to say something when Ulluk knelt down and began tracing words in the thick layer of dust on the floor which when he finished read as follows: </p>
<p>"The Last Vault of Camelot is located on the wall before you"</p>
<p>As soon as Harry finished reading the dust was swept away by a gust of wind as a pair of huge doors appeared in the stone wall before him, seeming to shimmer into place.</p>
<p>"Place your hand on the door and speak the name that comes to mind" Ulluk instructed. </p>
<p>Harry stepped forward and slowly placed his shaking hand on the door, the moment he did a word jumped to mind and without thinking he called out, though to who he knew not "Ambrosius" in a clear voice that rang and echoed as no twelve year old's should.</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke Harry felt the door fade into smoke, allowing him to see through into the vault that lay beyond. What he saw withing made him gasp and turn to Ulluk who simply gave him a smile and shook his head "None but you may enter see the doors or speak of what lies within-- it is the greatest secret of the Goblin race and of the wizarding world"</p>
<p>"But what does it mean?" Harry asked as he needed some sort of answer.</p>
<p>"There used to be three lines with accessing the House Pendragon, the House le Fay, and the House Ambrosius-- some two centuries ago the House Pendragon died out so its access went to House le Fay as the two were related at the source-- after that House le Fay rejoined house Ambrosius rendering the access of three to access of one-- one Lord of it all" </p>
<p>Harry swallowed a lump in his throat, this he knew, was too much for a boy to shoulder "I'm not ready" he said mostly to himself. </p>
<p>"No" Ulluk replied "But you don't have to be-- once we leave you and you alone will remember this place-- so wait and return when you are-- believe me they will wait"</p>
<p>Nodding in agreement Harry stepped back and willed the doors to solidify and seal, they did, seconds late all that was left was the smooth stone wall.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was spent reviewing the Potter and Black family wills. As the Lord of a Noble house, let alone two, Harry was considered an adult by wizard law rendering much of the Wills useless as anything that included who should be his guardian was moot. When given the chance Harry contracted Gringotts to manage both estates while he was in school in exchange for five percent of all investment profits and an ironclad zero risk magical contract. Goblins were the best. </p>
<p>With business done just before midnight the Flamels took Harry back to their little cottage in the highlands. The last thing Harry remembered of that day was warm sheets and soft pillows. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first week with the Flamels had been awkward and uncomfortable for Harry. First, because he had to deal with some two dozen pressing issues for the houses Black and Potter. Second, because he was living with strangers, kind, caring, and amazing strangers but still strangers. And Third, because he had to do all of the above while nearly constantly drinking potions brewed by the alchemists that would replenish both his magic and body that had been damaged by the past decade of abuse. </p>
<p>By week two Harry had grown a foot, he'd had a dozen incidents of accidental magic as he got used to having more magic in his finger than he used to in his whole body, and received no less than fifty owls from various professors, friend, and ministry officials demanding to know his location. </p>
<p>Perhaps the best part about being a Lord was that things like The Trace no longer worked on Harry, just like any other tracking spells used to keep tabs on magical children. </p>
<p>That was how Lord Harry Potter Black came to live with Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel greatest alchemists and con artists in wizarding history... </p>

A.N.<br/>
Okay so there's chapter 1 of my first Harry Potter fanfic, now I don't have a beta reader so I prefer constructive notes to criticism.<br/>
Now to answer some of your questions that will doubtlessly be asked:<br/>
Q- Didn’t Nicolas Flamel agree to destroy the stone?<br/>
A- Yes but he didn’t tell Dumbledore about the other dozen stones and centuries of planning and protection laid upon them, you really think Voldemort is the first Dark Lord to come knocking on the Flamel’s door?</p>
<p>Q/A- this is an AU in which Harry was weakened a lot more by the Dursleys abuse but yes he will still be more powerful than Harry 1.0</p>
<p>Q- why is harry twelve at the beginning of the summer when his birthday is at the end of summer?<br/>
A- if you noticed this good for you, if you didn’t, shameful very shameful. It's basically because I wanted him to be more mature each year (do you remember how much you grew up between 11 and 12, if you don't the take it from me, HUGE FUCKING DIFFERENCE) so I moved his birthday to September 2nd, right after the Hogwarts cut off date.</p>
