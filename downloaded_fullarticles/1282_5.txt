    <p><strong>Remus's POV</strong><br/><br/>I sit in my chair with my arms crossed tightly before a roaring fire. Felt scared, sad and so many other emotions. How could this night have happened? Snow still coated the earth and people all around were still in high holiday spirits. But my home was empty, filled with crisp silence, where occasional could be heard. I was alone, I was broken. It felt like overnight my whole friend group was destroyed, leaving me alone for the first time in a long time.  <br/><br/>I hear a soft knock on my door. I nearly fell out of my chair. I was sure it was a mistake, a simple trick of the imagination, but the knock happened again, I was now certain it wasn't just my imagination. I gingerly approach my front door, I open it slightly with my wand held tight. I could see a long silver heard and crescent moon glasses, that I couldn't misidentify. <br/><br/>"Hello, Remus." Dumbledore said gently with a small child in his hands. I couldn't see which one it was with the blanket wrapped so snuggly around the child.<br/><br/>"W-what? Is that Harry?" I ask as my voice was shaky and raw with emotion. It had been a long time since I spoke. <br/><br/>"No, Charlotte. thankfully she was saved too, Lily put her to bed earlier tonight. She wasn't harmed- or even acknowledged." Dumbledore explained as he comes inside my humble home. <br/><br/>I took a step to the side and just stared at the being in his arms, she seemed like she was miles away. "Why are you bringing Charlotte here?" I asked frightfully, I glance around my shabby home. It wasn't fit for the sweet child.<br/><br/>"Remus, you need to take care of her." He told me firmly.<br/><br/>I looked up at the old man with wide eyes. "N-no, Dumbledore I cannot take care of her," I protested as my heart breaks into a million pieces.<br/><br/>"Just look at her," Dumbledore ordered putting her small body into my arms. She was fast asleep, her forehead bore a new scar. A lightning bolt, how strange. Her firey hair was in a disarray, her curls going in every which way. <br/><br/>"Harry has one too, we don't know what it is," Dumbledore says. "But I have an idea,"<br/><br/>I felt tears well up in my eyes, I didn't mean for it to happen, it just felt more real, looking at the orphan in my weak arms. She looked so much like Lily with her red hair and freckles. I always knew she resembled her mother, but with Lily gone, I just saw it more clearly. She had Jame's round nose, though. <br/><br/>"I-I'll take care of her." I finally croaked. I knew I wouldn't be like James, but I promised I would try my very best. I will raise her into a sweet girl, one I know Lily and James would be proud of. <br/><br/>He gave me a small bow of relief. "Thank you, Remus." He said gratefully. "I know you will raise her well. Goodnight, I'll see myself out." I watched the old man leave, shutting the paint chipped door after him. <br/><br/>I drew in a deep breath and sighed. I was left with Charlotte in her pink floral blanket. "Oh, Charlotte, look at you, my darling girl." I whispered to her. She was fast asleep, but it didn't matter. She would wake up tomorrow with a new life, but still a loving one. </p>
