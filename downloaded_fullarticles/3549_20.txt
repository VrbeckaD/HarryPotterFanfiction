    <p>(Petunia evans)<br/>
So you found a place where the grass is greener<br/>
And you jumped the fence to the other side<br/>
Is it good?<br/>
Are they giving you a world I could never provide?</p><p>Well I hope you're proud of your big decision<br/>
Yeah, I hope it's all that you want and more<br/>
Now you're free from the agonizing life you were living before</p><p>And you say what you need to say<br/>
So that you get to walk away<br/>
It would kill you to have to stay trapped<br/>
When you've got something new<br/>
Well I'm sorry you had it rough<br/>
And I'm sorry I'm not enough<br/>
Thank God they rescued you<br/>
(Lilly evans)<br/>
So you got what you always wanted<br/>
So you got your dream come true<br/>
Good for you<br/>
Good for you, you, you<br/>
Got a taste of a life so perfect<br/>
So you did what you had to do<br/>
Good for you<br/>
Good for you</p><p>Does it cross your mind to be slightly sorry?<br/>
Do you even care that you might be wrong?<br/>
Was it fun?<br/>
Well I hope you had a blast while you dragged me along<br/>
(James potter)<br/>
And you say what you need to say<br/>
And you play who you need to play<br/>
And if somebody's in your way<br/>
Crush them and leave them behind<br/>
(Petunia dursley)<br/>
Well I guess if I'm not of use<br/>
Go ahead, you can cut me loose<br/>
Go ahead now, I won't mind<br/>
(Lilly potter)<br/>
I'll shut my mouth and I'll let you go<br/>
Is that good for you?<br/>
Would that be good for you, you, you?<br/>
(Petunia dursley)<br/>
I'll just sit back while you run the show<br/>
Is that good for you?<br/>
Would that be good for you, you, you?</p><p>(Petunia dursley)<br/>
All I need is some time to think<br/>
But the boat is about to sink<br/>
Can't erase what I wrote in ink<br/>
Tell me how could you change the story?</p><p>All the words that I can't take back<br/>
Like a train coming off the track<br/>
'Cause the rails and my bones all crack<br/>
I've got to find a way to<br/>
Stop it, stop it! Just let me off!</p><p>So you got what you always wanted<br/>
So you got your dream come true<br/>
Good for you<br/>
Good for you, you, you<br/>
Got a taste of a life so perfect<br/>
Now you say that you're someone new<br/>
Good for you<br/>
Good for you<br/>
Good for you<br/>
Good for you</p><p>So you got what you always wanted</p>
