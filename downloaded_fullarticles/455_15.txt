  <em>BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.</em>

  <em>BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.</em>
</p><p>Remus groaned and fumbled for his cell phone under his pillow. He squinted through the stream of sunlight that was hitting him right in the eyes, trying to decipher how to turn his alarm off. But there was no alarm message on his phone, just a little Facebook notification in the corner of the screen. Mumbling to himself, he threw his sheets off and sat up, intending to go find the source of the incessant beeping.</p><p>After blearily looking around himself for a few seconds, Remus realised that the sound wasn’t coming from an attention-starved appliance or laptop, but was actually coming from outside his bedroom window. He stumbled out of bed, trying not to knock over one of his many piles of books as he did so, and peered through the curtains. There was a truck backing into the driveway, beeping loudly to bring attention the information that it was in fact moving backwards. Why the entire complex needed to know the truck was moving backwards, Remus had no idea. He squinted into the bright morning light in an attempt to understand the truck.</p><p>Along the side of the truck were the words “Pickford and Sons Moving Company”, accompanied by a smiling cartoon house. Remus could see the silhouette of someone at the rear of the truck, who was most likely giving instructions to the driver. The silhouette held out their hands and the truck rumbled to a halt, causing the beeping to stop.</p><p>“Thank fuck”, mumbled Remus. It was far too early on a Saturday morning to be moving house. Or at least far too early to be making so much noise about it. He grabbed a t-shirt off his floor, pulling over his head before he shuffled out of his room to the kitchen in search of coffee.</p><p>Remus flicked the switch on the kettle and turned to stare through the large living room window at the people moving in next door. He was startled by the sound of a cough behind him, and turned to see Frank searching through the massive selection of teabags in the cupboard.</p><p>“Got enough water for Alice and me in there?” Frank asked, jabbing his thumb towards the kettle, his attention caught by the boxes of tea.</p><p>“Yeah”, Remus replied. “Did you hear that beeping before?”</p><p>Frank turned around and shrugged. “What beeping?”</p><p>“The truck! How’d you miss it?” Remus said, staring at Frank in bewilderment, “we’ve got ourselves some new neighbours.”</p><p>Frank followed the line of Remus pointing, and examined the moving truck for a moment. “Huh. Hey, do you think Alice wants Vanilla Chai Tea or Green Tea with Jasmine?” He held up the two boxes for Remus to consider.</p><p>“Green.”, Remus replied without looking over at the boxes of tea. He was still engrossed in looking over at the neighbours, who had begun carrying mattresses into the flat. His attention was broken by the click of the kettle boiling, however.</p><p>He reached around Frank for his coffee grounds, then poured the water into the respective cups and coffee plunger.</p><p>“What do you think they’ll be like?” Remus asked Frank, jerking his head over at the neighbouring flat.</p><p>Frank ran his hand through his hair and beard, somehow to managing to muss them up even more. “Hmmm. Hopefully not creepy serial killers I guess.”</p><p>Remus barked a laugh in response, and Frank grinned. “Nah. It’d be nice to have some people our age. Seems everyone else here is over 60.”</p><p>“Well that’s what happens when the advertisement for a flat says ‘Apartment Complex featuring resident bridge club and community rose garden’”, Remus replied.</p><p>“And doesn’t Phyllis have such nice Persian roses this month?” Frank said with another grin, nodding towards the yellow roses lined against the fence across the garden. Chuckling, he picked up the two mugs of tea and headed back to his room.</p><p>As he waited for his coffee to brew, Remus pondered about the new next door neighbours. From what he could tell, they were moving themselves in, so they couldn’t be too elderly. He also noticed an overflowing box of pots that included a wok and a large steel steamer. Perhaps they were Asian? Or maybe they just enjoyed Asian food. It was still difficult to see any detail of their faces due to the awkward mid-morning light, so Remus resigned himself to remain in the dark until the inevitable jovial new neighbour welcome later that day. He busied himself making his coffee, ensuring that he added just the right amount of milk, before heading back to his room.</p><p>When he got back to his room, he found Picasso sitting on his armchair where he had been planning to sit to drink his coffee and check Facebook. Picasso meowed indignantly, and Remus sighed and put his coffee down on the bedside table.</p><p>“What?”, he said in that voice one reserves for pouty babies, sleepy dogs and angry cats, “Do you want breakfast? Did I leave it 5 minutes too long?”</p><p>Picasso meowed again, then jumped off the chair to rub against Remus’ legs and headbutt his ankles. He reached over to check his phone, and it was in fact 5 minutes past 10am.</p><p>“Mr. Picky”, Remus huffed at Picasso, before making coaxing noises as he headed back to the kitchen. Picasso trotted after Remus, maintaining his snooty attitude.</p><p>He grabbed the cat biscuits off the shelf and shook some into Picasso’s bowl. “There. Happy now?” he said huffily.</p><p>Picasso meowed snappily in response, then started nibbling at the biscuits. Remus rolled his eyes and headed back to his room again.</p><p>He sipped at his coffee whilst he browsed through his Facebook wall, his laptop perched on his knees. Adrian had tagged him in a few photos from his party last week for landing his position at The Guardian. Remus flicked through the photos, ‘liking’ the ones where he looked slightly less gormless. At least he’d chosen to forgo wearing that tweed jacket his parents had bought him. He looked alright as long as he avoided anything his they gave him. Why they thought he liked cardigans and tweed that much, he couldn’t understand. When they gave him the jacket, his mother had said, “For our future university lecturer!” Remus wasn’t sure tweed was actually part of university staff dress code, but it was the thought that counted.</p><p>Once he’d downed the last of his coffee, Remus closed the lid of his laptop, leaving the Facebook window open for later. He grabbed his towel hanging on the back of his door, quickly slipping his pyjama pants and t-shirt off. He haphazardly wrapped his towel around his waist, and ambled down the hallway to the bathroom.</p><p>He flicked the shower handle upwards, and waited for the water to heat up. Whilst he did so, Remus stared at himself in the bathroom mirror before it fogged over. Stubble? Not too bad, considering he shaved it last night. Hair? Needs to be washed? Chest hair? Still there. Looking more Middle Earth-esque every day. Teeth? Brushing required. He grabbed his toothbrush, coated it in toothpaste, then jumped into the shower. When he told Frank he brushed his teeth in the shower, Frank had been confused. He’d said that it would be weird smelling all minty from having to spit down the drain. But Remus liked the mint, he even used a mint body wash. The tingling was nicer than the numbness in his fingers, which was worse in the mornings. Plus, a little multitasking never hurt anyone.</p><p>As he brushed his teeth, he found himself rotating slowly to let the water cascade all over him. Morning showers were his favourite part of getting up. His coffee and indignant cat were just part of his routine, but showers were always just a bit more special. With his mint shower gel, the strange loofah thing left at his flat by his Body Shop employee ex-boyfriend, and the fancy face scrub given to him by his concerned grandmother, it was almost semi-luxurious. As luxurious as a 24 year old male student’s shower could be, that is.</p><p>After he leant out of the shower to put his toothbrush back in its holder above the basin, Remus moved on to washing his hair and body. Ever since watching Ferris Bueller’s Day Off when he was 13, he’d been unable to stop himself forming his hair into a soapy mohawk. He did the same thing today, moulding it into 2 spikes and snickering at himself in the obscured bathroom mirror reflection. He tried to replicate the look with the minty suds and chest hair, but couldn’t quite manage it. He rinsed the suds out, then quickly scrubbed his face.</p><p>Remus let himself stand for a few more moments under the hot water, then forced himself to flip the handle back and step out of the shower into the drafty bathroom. There was a faint knock on the door.</p><p>“Yeah?  Be two secs!”</p><p>A muffled Welsh accent came through the door, “It’s okay, Remus. Just got to start getting ready for work.”</p><p><em>Of course. Alice stayed over, she starts at the hospital at 12</em>, Remus thought. He quickly grabbed his towel and wrapped it around himself, then flung himself out of the bathroom.</p><p>“All yours”, he said with a smile. Alice smiled back, hugging an unbuttoned shirt of Frank’s to herself.</p><p>“Thanks. Nippy this morning!”, she remarked, shuffling past Remus.</p><p>He nodded in response, and watched the door close behind her. It wasn’t that cold, but Alice was a very small girl. He suspected that half the reason she’d started dating Frank was due to his large collection of fuzzy sweaters that she could steal.</p><p>Remus headed back to his room, trying not to drip too much on the hallway carpet. He dried himself off speedily once reaching his room, sifting through his underwear drawer to find a pair in which the elastic hadn’t given out. After he pulled a particularly obnoxious bright green pair on, he picked out his favourite jeans, which were blue and faded with small rips on the knees. He took a bit longer searching for a t-shirt, towelling off his hair as he did so. He finally decided on his new cream coloured t-shirt that had arrived in the mail yesterday. It featured a picture of a pipe and the words “Bitch I might be” underneath it. Frank hadn’t understood it when he’d showed it to him yesterday, but he knew that somebody in the art history postgraduate department would. They were all big fans of Magritte and other kinds of artists that disrupted realism and convention.</p><p>Still towelling off his hair, he opened his bedroom curtains, revealing a view of the driveway and the entrance of the neighbouring flat. One of the new neighbours was still carrying boxes and furniture into the flat, but the other had seemingly disappeared. Just as Remus was about to turn away to hang his towel up, he heard the rumble of a motorbike coming up the driveway.  </p><p>He stood and stared with his towel still half on his head as the motorbike parked outside the new flat. The rider dismounted, and handed a box that had been strapped to the back to the other neighbour. The flatmate took the box inside as the rider took off their helmet and locked it up with their bike.  They wandered over to the end of the truck, assumedly to grab another box. Just as they strode off the lawn and onto the gravelled driveway, the sunlight streamed across their face<em>. It was like a moment from a bloody teen movie</em>, Remus would think to himself later.</p><p>His hair was gorgeous. It curled haphazardly across his forehead and down to his chin, catching the light that highlighted the rich, deep brown colour. Remus stood in awe, his towel hanging off his head. He drank in the man’s beautiful hair and his full lips, letting his eyes wander down his brown leather jacket, impossibly tight jeans and Doc Martens.</p><p><em>God, he’s a fucking beautiful biker boy, </em>Remus practically moaned in his head, <em>what did I do to deserve this?</em></p><p>Remus’ staring daze was broken by the man meeting his gaze. Remus was suddenly painfully aware that only was he staring at his new neighbour, he was doing so with a wet towel dangling off his head. He scrambled to take it off, dropping it on the floor. His hands went to his head in an attempt to smooth his hair down.</p><p>The man smiled softly and waved. He looked like he was chuckling to himself. Remus felt his cheeks go red as he waved back weakly. The man bounced his eyebrows cheekily at Remus before clambering into the truck to grab another box.</p><p>Remus forced himself to avert his gaze for a moment and hang his towel up. When he let himself look back up, he only caught a glimpse of the man going in through his front door. Remus’ mind wandered back to the man’s beautiful hair and smile, and he found himself wondering what his eyes were like behind those sunglasses.</p><p>He let himself become lost in thought for a few moments before shaking himself to attention.</p><p>“There are things to do. Art history things”, Remus muttered to himself in an authoritative tone. He grabbed a thick textbook of the top of the nearest book pile and balanced his laptop, mug and a few highlighters on top of it.</p><p>Remus carefully carried his pile of stuff into the lounge, and set himself up beside the coffee table. He surveyed the choice of armchairs and couches, trying to decide which would best provide him with both warm sunlight and ample view of the gorgeous biker boy. Finally, he decided upon the squishy orange 70s chair which he’d inherited from his parent’s basement last year. He flicked on the kettle again to make himself another cup of coffee, and settled in for a few hours of university readings, cups of tea, and peering not-so-subtly over at the new neighbours.</p>
