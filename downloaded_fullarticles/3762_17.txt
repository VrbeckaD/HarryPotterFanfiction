    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>As the Ball concluded, the students made their way back to their respective common rooms, a lone figure continued in the Great Hall. He had been patiently waiting for a certain server boy to return to the scene. His violet eyes wandered the room, his gaze falling upon the many of the remaining decorations. Suddenly, movement caught his attention and it was exactly who he was waiting for. </p>
<p>Veo rushed out the kitchen combing his hair. He had spent the past few hour hand washing dishes as he didn't want to use his wand to do such a mundane task. He started jogging barely catching a glimpse of the one figure awaiting him. He didn't want to be told to sweep the floors. His hands were already pruned as it is.</p>
<p>Dawn chuckled at the disheveled state Veo was in. He started to walk towards Veo, making sure not the trip on anything on the floor. "Have fun with your detention?" Dawn asked with a hint of a laugh. It was getting partially late and a someone would most likely come yelling at them to get to their rooms.  </p>
<p>Veo did a double take and whirled around to see Mr. Rainbow cape. He raised an eyebrow, "Sure, if that's what you consider fun." He glanced around seeing that everyone had taken off. "Have you... been waiting for me?" he flopped his glove back and forth.</p>
<p>Dawn smiled before finally reaching a normal distance from Veo. "Well I thought you had a rough night, so I wanted to check up on you" Dawn stated rather awkwardly, fidgeting with his cape. "Sorry, did you want to be alone?" he asked, looking sheepishly.</p>
<p>Veo rubbed his nose where the students had kicked him, almost as if he was having a flashback of PTSD. He gave Dawn a curious look. "Well...Thanks." He looked around once more. "I was just going to head up to my dorm, but since you're here, I might as well walk you to yours." He approached Dawn putting his hands in his pocket. It was the least he could do. "Dawn...Right?" He had to check his memory. "What house?"</p>
<p>Dawn gave a small nod and held his arms behind his back, under his cape, feeling rather overdressed next to the shorter boy. “Dawn Breaker and Gryffindor,” he said. “What house are you in?” Dawn asked with a soft smile, walking beside Veo.</p>
<p>"Wow, that sounds like a video game character." Veo scoffed smiling for the first time in his second year of this hell hole. "That's the one with the...lion, right? I'm with the birds. Um... Raven something." He combed his hair back. He then looked at Dawn's cape and attire, eyeing it up and down. "I've never seen the rainbow attend a dance before."</p>
<p>"Should I thank you or be insulted, little Ravenclaw" Dawn questioned, narrowing his violet eyes at Veo. "And yes, the one with the lion" He laughed slightly at how Veo dismissed all the formalities of Hogwarts. Dawn straightened his posture and looked down at his cape, "Well now you have, now tell me, is that a good thing or a bad thing?"</p>
<p>Veo looked at him with a sly twinkle in his eye. "That depends on you. And how good you can make it look. Same with your name. " He answered. he opened the door out of the great hall and gestured Dawn to go through. "The lion, red and yellow. Do you have to solve riddles when you get to your dorm door?"</p>
<p>"Well I'll take both as a good thing," Dawn said walking through the door with a curt nod to Veo. "And no, we do not, we just have to say the password of the week," Dawn said, feeling proud of not having to be a Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>"Very well." Veo closed the door and sauntered beside Dawn in the hallway. The candle lights flickering as they passed by making their shadows dance. "Password of the week? How does that work? Do all Gryffindor’s have a telepathic connection every week so you all know what the password is?" </p>
<p>"Well no, the Fat Lady tells a prefect and then it's their responsibility to tell us when it changes," Dawn thought aloud. he looked up at the candles as they passed, enjoying the dim light.</p>
<p>Veo frowned at this tactic. "Well, that seems inefficient. There must be hundreds of you guys there. How are they supposed to tell all of you individually when the password changes, what if one of you forgets? No bed for the night till someone finds you sleeping on the floor?"</p>
<p>Dawn grinned. "That's because it is inefficient. True there are hundreds of us there, but they manage to somehow tell all of us when the password changes, and if one of us forgets? I can't tell you how many times I've been locked out of my own common room?" He laughed at the embarrassing memory of being found arguing with a portrait. "Well what about you guys, how do you manage to answer every riddle?" </p>
<p>"That's just child cruelty," Veo mumbled before Dawn asked him a question. They turned a corner. "Some of us are just really intelligent. They get the riddles just like that. Some of us are locked out and if enough of us are outside, it takes a group effort to solve the riddle. " Veo answered. "Although I have to say, I don't do groups. Practically the reason why I got detention...." Veo looked ahead recalling the event. "I couldn't answer the riddle at the time. So, I climbed the side of the tower and broke into the common room window."</p>
<p>"Holy shit," Dawn mumbled, imagining Veo scaling the Ravenclaw tower and busting a window. "Guess we're opposite then, I'm found of groups, to be honest, always have since..." He trailed off" His gaze found the floor before returning to the candles.</p>
<p>"And yeah, groups, people, good,"</p>
<p>Veo recalled the shattered window. And almost laughed at how the prefect was more concerned about the damaged property than him on a ledge. He then turned toward Dawn taking a hand from his pocket and placing it gently on Dawn's back. "You alright?"</p>
<p>Dawn quickly dismissed the situation. "Yeah, perfectly fine," Dawn said with a smile that was a bit off. He looked at the candles, recalling memories and ran a nervous hand through his hair, "never better."</p>
<p>Veo blinked for a moment. He stared at Dawn's violet eyes quizzically as the older boy faced the candles. "Right..." He squinted. "And I'm a bottle nosed elephant with a vitamin deficiency." He walked in front of Dawn and started walking backward.</p>
<p>Dawn laughed dryly at Veo's comment. He shook his head and look at Veo. "Well, we all have our demons." He walked carefully, trying not to step on Veo's feet. "Now let's get you back to your common room."</p>
<p>Veo raised a brow and gave a small smirk. "Well played." Whatever Dawn had in mind clearly wasn't for the public eye. And they had just met. Never the less it was none of Veo's business. He switched gears and started walking in front again and slowed down to Dawn's speed. "Wouldn't going to your common room be more on the way?" </p>
<p>Dawn nods a Veo's understanding. "Well, I came to get you, so I'll take you to your common room."</p>
<p>Veo turned to the side before looking back at Dawn. "This is why you're a lion." He put his hands behind his head. "Alright. Well, I've been asking the 20 questions. I suppose I owe you one." </p>
<p>Dawn Smiled down at Veo. "Well, I could ask you some questions." He ruffled his hair then placed his hands in his pockets. "How are you enjoying Hogwarts?" Dawn asked. "Make any new friends" he joked, remembering Veo's distaste in groups. </p>
<p>Veo looked at him with a great distance in his eyes. He then narrowed his gaze as he looked forward. He sighed. "To tell you the truth... I hate it. I try to skip class as much as possible." He shrugged as if this wasn't the first time he's confessed this. "I've bumped into people. They're more acquaintances than friends." </p>
<p>Dawn looked Veo in confusion. He placed a hand on his shoulder. "Well, what bad about the classes." He asked, tilting his head. "And If you want, you can consider me a friend."</p>
<p>Veo eyed him with serious intent. "Doing magic in general." He almost jumped when Dawn placed a hand on his shoulder. "Do you consider me as a friend?"</p>
<p> "Is there a reason for you not liking magic or should I not ask." He chuckled softly when Veo jumped. He sped up a bit, stopping in front of Veo and doing a small bow, "would you like me to be your friend?"</p>
<p>"I have nothing to hide," Veo uttered in his puberty starting voice. He frowned when Dawn stepped in front of him and bowed. Veo snickered a bit and did an elegant hand gesture. "If you're willing to put up with my shenanigans be my guest."</p>
<p>Instantly footsteps could be heard coming from the dark corridor to the left.</p>
<p> Dawn was about to respond before hearing footsteps. "Ah, shit" he mumbled. "We should probably hide"</p>
<p>Veo's hands started to sweat. "Where!? The walls are bloody stones!" He glanced around looking at the knight statues and the flickering lights all casting dancing corners of shadows.</p>
<p>The footsteps started getting closer and closer.</p>
<p> Dawn panicked for a second, he wasn't exactly the best of friends with some of the prefects. "Come on" he whispered, grabbing Veo by the wrist and dragging him to one of the many Knight statues. "You're smaller so come here," he said, pushing Veo as far behind the statue as he could and taking out his wand. "Colovaria" he whispered, pointing his wand at his rainbow cape. A red light came from his wand before the fabric matched the walls behind them. He wrapped the two of them in the cape, hoping it would be enough.</p>
<p>Veo hunched. Smushed between the walls and Dawn. He did not want to clean another bedpan. He wasn't sure what the spell he cast was but whatever it was, he hoped it worked. Veo held his breath.</p>
<p>The Footsteps came across the hallway they entered and stopped... for a moment before proceeding on away.</p>
<p> Dawn looked over his shoulder as the footsteps. He was about to call it all clear when the footsteps paused a bit away. Quickly ducking down, he was careful of the armor or the smaller boy. </p>
<p> Veo perked his head up. "Is it g- Oh jeez," Veo uttered as he was immediately pushed back against the stone knight again. This was like escaping a prison. He sighed. He really hated it here.</p>
<p> The footsteps stated back towards their end of the hall, probably hearing Veo's voice. He quickly covered Veo mouth and looked down, attempting to keep his head covered by the fabric.</p>
<p> Veo's eyes widened as his mouth was covered. He could feel his breath on the hand blow back into his nose. His eyes darted around from stone to fabric. He held his breath. Hands clamped shut. Knuckles white with pressure.</p>
<p> "Come on, come on, come on" Dawn whispered. Finally, after what felt like ages, the footsteps receded back down the hall. He looked over his shoulder once more and saw the figure disappear. "Alright, I think they're gone," Dawn said straightening up.</p>
<p> Veo peered from the bottom side of the wall as if it were a Scooby Doo party lurking at a door frame. "Are you sure?" He looked under the fabric.</p>
<p> Dawn looked down at Veo with a reassuring smile. "Yeah, I think we're good," he said backing up, realizing how close they were.</p>
<p> Veo looked up at Dawn as he backed away. He then patted his suit and stood up. "Well, that's a relief." He muttered. "Thanks... friend." Veo playfully punched his elbow.</p>
<p> Dawn laughed softly at Veo's action. "Now I feel like staying out longer" he joked.</p>
<p> Veo's eyebrows raised as he squinted coyly. "Wow, looks like you're a thrill seeker yourself." He uttered. "Then again, you are a lion. It's only natural."</p>
<p>"A lion has to has to have their raven" Dawn commented, using the same spell from earlier to change his cape from plain brick to a solid matt black.</p>
<p>Veo stared at him trying to compute what just came out of his mouth. " I have never heard that saying before." He squinted and watched in hesitation as the cape retraced to its original form.</p>
<p> "well, it's not an actual saying" Dawn laughed nervously "just a saying I made up right now". He started walking down the hall, opposite if the footsteps. "How about this," Dawn said looking over at Veo, spinning his wand in his hand "we could go on a little adventure?"</p>
<p> Veo slipped his hands into his pockets again. He nodded as Dawn stated he created the saying. He then followed the older student along the hall. Then looked at him as Dawn proposed an adventure. "What do you have in mind?" He raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p> Dawn thought for a second. "We could go flying" he suggested, placing a hand behind his neck, unsurely.</p>
<p> "On a broomstick?" Veo chuckled as he walked out of the hallway ahead towards the moving staircases. "I'd rather ride on a muggle car. At least those things have airbags and no mind of their own." He went step onto one staircase. Just as his weight pressed on it, the stair started shifting. "Jesus!" He yelped getting knocked to the side of the first rail.</p>
<p> "They're not that bad," Dawn said stepping onto the moving staircase with ease, holding onto the handrail with familiarity. He noticed Veo get knocked over and grabbed him by the arm lightly "you alright man?"</p>
<p> Veo held on to the rail for some extra support. He watched as the stairs moved from one position to another and signed out loud. "I can't wait to go back home..." He mumbled. He looked towards Dawn. "I'm guessing you embrace this kind of stuff wholeheartedly."</p>
<p> Dawn smiled a tad awkwardly. "Well it's not all easy for me," he said gesturing to his right hand by lifting it slightly. He watched the staircase move as well, "but I guess magic isn't for everyone."</p>
<p> "I'd get rid of it if I could." Veo scratched his head before Dawn gestured to his right hand. "What happened there?" Veo nodded to the older boy's hand.</p>
<p> Dawn rolled up his right sleeve revealing his prosthetic arm with a lion 'tattooed' on it. "An incident when I was little" was all he said "same here" he continued, tapping his left leg. "What's wrong with magic?"</p>
<p> Veo sat his elbow on the rail and rested his head on the hand. "That sounds like quite a story. Do tell if you're up for it...Well, as you've experienced. Magic has dire consequences. In my case, it took my entire lifestyle away from me."</p>
<p>"Well" Dawn started, looking down at his arm "I was pretty little, one of the years I was in boarding school. I was in a motorcycle and car accident, me being hit by a motorcycle, then a car that didn't stop in time. After being hit, I was airlifted to a hospital where I was told that I had two broken legs and a broken arm. My right leg was broken in several places and my left leg was even worse. My arm was broken in many places as well. In the end. My arm and leg were too damaged to be fixed and ended up being amputated." Dawn stopped, realizing that he was rambling. "Sorry about that" he muttered, rolling back down his sleeve.</p>
<p>Veo found himself having his mouth agape. "That's all kinds of messed up." He couldn't shake the thought of 2 vehicles colliding with a child Dawn. "Wait... so airlifted? " He tried to regain his constitution. "You came from a muggle family? Normal Nurses and doctors tried to fix you?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly, I'm pureblood but my family lived in the muggle world" Dawn stated. "I went to a muggle boarding school and everything."</p>
<p>Veo unintentionally looked at Dawn's prosthetic hand and opened and closed his own left, recollecting his encounter with the school healer snapping back his broken arm not too long ago. Looks like he wasn't the only pure blood whose family decided to live among muggles. "So you didn't have time to get to a wizard nurse, Err... Healer." He thought for a moment. "Can you ... cast spells with your...uh fake arm?" He hesitantly asked.</p>
<p>Dawn noticed Veo look at his arm. "You can touch it if you want," he said, holding his right arm out slightly. "And no, I didn't but I'm fine with it." He thought for a moment. "Well, I can move it like a normal arm but when it comes to magic, I can only do certain spells that don't require much."</p>
<p>Veo hesitantly moved to touch it. It was indeed unlike flesh. Hard and unnatural. He looked at Dawn in confusion and frustration. "Aren't you mad? When you needed magic the most, it didn't come to you. And now you have to spend all your life missing something and now your here. People trying to teach you how to control magic but all they really care to do with it is wash dishes and teleport places for their own convenience. Wizards are nothing more than just lazier people. It makes me sick to think I'm one of them." His eyes started welling up and went to march up the stairs.</p>
<p>Dawn smiled softly when Veo felt the prosthetic. Why would I be mad? When I was recovering at first, I was mad, sure, anyone would be. But when I was learning how to walk again I realized that I couldn't rely on magic for everything. Sure, it's useful for somethings but it's not the only thing I can do. Yeah, it can be a pain, remembering that I'm missing an arm and a leg. Yes, some wizards use magic because they're lazy, but just think, without magic, I wouldn't be here talking to you." He followed Veo up the stairs, slightly slower. He rested his left hand on his shoulder and squeezed it softly.</p>
<p>Veo turned around to look at him. A stray tear escaped his face, but he quickly wiped it away. "You've furthered my point. Magic's just there. It's not here for anyone. It causes a lot more problems more than it can solve them. And we could have met by a different path."</p>
<p>Dawn just looked at Veo unsure of what to say, He just looked down, away from Veo.</p>
<p>Veo looked to the side. His peripheral towards Dawn. The paintings on the wall are all covering their mouths. Some had left their portrait from all this commotion. Veo swallowed sensing he might have struck a nerve. As he suspected, it was a mistake to be here, to be enrolled here, to be... a wizard. "Thanks for the walk. I can find my way on my own from here. Good night." He started to march on.</p>
<p>Dawn pulled out his wand, and doing the proper motions, said "immobulus." The blue light erupted from the tip of his wand, hitting Veo and causing the smaller boy to freeze.</p>
<p>Instantly Veo felt all his muscles tensed. He could no longer command himself to go up. His eyes darted around in panic. His mind screaming.</p>
<p>Dawn made his way up the stairs 'this is never going to get easy' he thought before finally reaching Veo. "Don't worry you're fine," he said softly, seeing the boy's panic. "You keep running away" he mumbled, "Why do you hate magic so much?" He pointed his wand at Veo again.</p>
<p>Once Veo could move again. He felt himself resume the action he was doing only to be stopped by Dawn's presence. "What the heck is wrong with you!" He yelled before Dawn mumbled. He brushed his hand with his hair and looked to the side with anger and frustration and shook his head. "It made my friends forget me. " He looked at Dawn with saddened rage. "They couldn't even remember my name."</p>
<p>"Sorry about that" Dawn said stepping back. He reached out to comfort Veo but hesitated. "You" he started "You tried to show muggles magic, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Well of course! " Veo uttered matter of factly. "When I finally got it, I thought it was fantastic. Why wouldn't you show it to your friends? It was beautiful! But just like that, the next day, all gone. I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye." Veo's mouth quivered.</p>
<p>"No " Dawn muttered. "I-I'm sorry" Dawn pulled Veo in a hug. "Listen, I might not understand how your situation was like, but you don't have to let it ruin your life, sorry that might have been wrong, just. I'm sorry"</p>
<p>Veo's eyes widened as Dawn brought him into an embrace. 2 big tears rolled down his cheek. Not even his dad would hug him, this was new to him. Yet all too familiar. He got a flashback of a hug from his friend when he finally arrived at the arcade all those many moons ago. Veo burst out into a sob and covered his face. "I hate it, I hate it so much." To know, his friends were still out there. Knowing they would never remember of his existence. To Veo, this was worse than death.</p>
<p>Dawn could feel the smaller boy shake as he cried, and he hugged him tighter. He could remember doing this for his younger siblings when they found out parents weren't coming home. Dawn took in a shaky breath and rested his forehead on Veo's shoulder. "I know, I know."</p>
<p>Veo found this hug to be comforting. It wasn't one of friends or acquaintances. It seemed one an older sibling would do for their younger sibling. Being an only child, Veo found this rather interesting. And something he wished he had a long time ago. After his eyes ran out of water, and he had controlled his breath, he was silent for a moment. Then he started laughing.</p>
<p>Dawn turned his head into Veo’s and then straightened his posture. He loosened his grip before wiping away his tear-stained cheeks. “What’s so funny?” Dawn asked.</p>
<p>Veo shook his head as he was on the verge of cackling. "It's just so funny how I'm the one crying when you're the one who's had their appendages removed. I don't know what's worse." He snickered. "Magic man. Brings so much pain, it's just too funny now."</p>
<p>Dawn looked at Veo before laughing at the situation as well. "We should, we should probably be quiet. Someone might hear us” pretty much giggled.  “You’re damn right.”</p>
<p>Veo cleared his throat. "Right, right." Bursting out just a bit here and there.<br/>
<br/>
"I hope you get found out." One of the paintings muttered. "I'm trying to go to sleep here."</p>
<p>“Come on, the night is still young” Dawn laughed, pulling Veo up the stairs. He gave an apologetic way to the portraits who were giving the two of them death glares. </p>
<p>"You don't need sleep! You're just a bunch of colors on the wall!" Veo yelled back at them as he was getting dragged up the stairs.</p>
<p>"You want to fight young man!" The painting countered.</p>
<p>"I'll take you on any time!"</p>
<p>Dawn laughed and turned to grab Veo. He covered Veo’s mouth and practically carried him the rest of the way. “Let’s not wake up the whole castle” he whispered shouted.</p>
<p>"Mm..mmm ..mmm.mmm?" The little boy asked muffled, being carried up the stairs onto the second floor.</p>
<p>Dawn removed his hand when they got far enough from the upset portraits. "You are just a tiny ball of angry sometimes," Dawn laughed as he started to wander down the hall.</p>
<p>"I'll tear that painting in half if need be." Veo squinted ready to fight. "But anyway as I was asking, Where are we headed?"</p>
<p>Dawn shook his head at Veo’s comment. “Not sure yet, I’m kind of making this up as I go” Dawn shrugged, continuing down the hall.</p>
<p>Veo raised an eyebrow. "Is that so... Well, lead the way oh great Gandalf the wise. " He pointed to the long deep dark hallway with flickering candle lights. Although it was dark. He was feeling quite brave, till a ghost emerged and he turned pale.</p>
<p>Dawn continued down the hall that was littered with classrooms, sneaking glances at Veo to make sure he was alright. When the ghost emerged, he noticed Veo turn pale, and knowing that the ghosts would snitch on him from experience, he pulled the smaller boy into a classroom corridor. “Unlock the door, I’ll keep an eye on the ghost,” </p>
<p>"Alrighty." Veo pulled out his door hacking tools from his pocket. A paper clip and some form of a screwdriver. He started his muggle way of breaking and entering.</p>
<p>Dawn turned to look at what was taking Veo so long and saw his “tools.” His brows furrowed in confusion as his he whispered: “what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Veo looked up at him as he continued to fumble trying to get nonexistent locks to connect with his screw. "What does it look like? I'm breaking in!" He continued to fumble.</p>
<p>Dawn looked back to the wandering spirit, it had come a bit closer to the duo. "I know you hate it, but there is a spell for this kind of thing," He said nervously.</p>
<p>Veo looked up at Dawn with the realization of what he was implying. He stood up. "No." He said blankly. "Not in a million years." He stepped aside. "You do it. I'll keep watch."</p>
<p>Dawn opened his mouth to apologize but left out a breath of disappointment at his comment. He knelt down, taking out his wand and, doing the appropriate hand motions with the words " Alohomora", unlocked the classroom door with an invisible light. Dawn peeked out from behind Veo to get a look at the spirit. When it turned to look at them, he grabbed Veo and pulled them into the room, closing the door behind them.</p>
<p>Veo witnessed as the ghost got closer. "It's getting - Ahh!" He yelped as he got pulled into the classroom and Dawn shut the door behind them. "Do you think it noticed us?" He asked peering into the dark classroom and taking out a matchbox to light one stick. He had never been in this classroom before. Maybe it was one for the older kids.</p>
<p>“I think we’re good,” He said looking around the room with the small light Veo’s match provided. He had had to guess this was an old charms classroom or something. He looked for somewhere to hide just in case.</p>
<p>Veo walked around eyeing the dusty old lecture desk. It seemed to him the room was unused. Why? It looked perfectly fine. He turned around to find the ghost right in front of him. His match light blew out just as the ghost uttered: "You were unwise to come in here." It went dark.</p>
