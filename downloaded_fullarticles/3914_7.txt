    <p>Dear, fucken Potter</p><p>I hate you with every fiber of my being. How dare you! Severus just told me everything! You two where suppose to be getting a divorce! He was with me! Me! We where going to have a happy little family but you just had to be a fucken homewreaker didn’t you potter? Its always about you isn’t it? Precious fucking Potter! You knew we where together and you still fucked him! I bet you where just throwing yourself at him every chance you got. Using your kid as a excuse to see your ex how pathetic are you potter? I hope he leaves you again. Hell come back to me I know it! He says im amazing! The best sex hes ever had. Im his good little slytherin and your just a Gryfindor whore he felt bad for and had to marry because you got knocked up. I bet you did it on purpose to. Trying to trap him in a relationship. Its not going to work he loves me more then he ever loved you! Not that it matters I don’t want him anymore trash can have trash. Good riddance enjoy your fucken lives. </p><p>I love seeing him break you.</p><p>                          Sincerely, the best he ever had</p>
