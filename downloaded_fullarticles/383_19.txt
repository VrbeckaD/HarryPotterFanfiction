          <div class="userstuff"><p>They pass in the corridor.<br/>“Malfoy,” Contempt.<br/>“Potter,” Vehemence.<br/>Draco’s heart hardens. Cold veins.</p><p>They pass on the stairs.<br/>“Watch it, Potter.” Spit flies off his lip.<br/>“Shove it, Malfoy.” Angry. Tired.<br/>Draco watches Potter skulk off. Disdain.</p><p>Draco passes by Potter and his friends. Bumps into him on purpose.<br/>“Get out of my way!”<br/>“Fuck you, Malfoy” Potter’s eyes are dark.<br/>The Weasel tells him it’s not worth it.

Harry.</p><p>Draco starts a letter.<br/><em>Don’t come to Hogwarts this year.</em><br/>Too threatening.<br/><em>It’s too dangerous.</em><br/>Fucking Gryffindor loves danger.<br/>It’s a lost cause.<br/><em>..I love you..</em><br/>He throws the parchment in the fire.</p><p>Harry sneaks into his compartment.<br/>Draco waits for the others to leave.<br/>Draco immobilizes him.

DRACO!”<br/>Harry is there. He says he didn’t mean it. Draco doesn’t care. He’s relieved.<br/>Then Severus is there.<br/>“No..” Draco is going to live.<br/><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>Harry is in the manor.<br/>Draco studies his face. He knows it’s him.<br/>He wishes it wasn’t.<br/>“Is it him?”<br/>“I can’t be sure.”<br/>Draco looks at Mother. His eyes say help me.<br/>Mother helps. Harry escapes.</p><p>They are in the Room of Requirement.<br/>Draco is panicking.<br/>“DON’T KILL HIM!”<br/>Harry is escaping. <em>Leave me here. Live.</em><br/>Harry saves him. <em>Why?</em></p><p>The war is over.<br/>Harry is returning Draco’s wand.<br/>Their fingers brush.<br/>“See you.” Harry hesitates. “Draco.”<br/>Surprise. Something flutters in Draco’s chest.<br/>“Harry.”<br/>Harry smiles. Leaves.</p><p>Harry testifies at Draco’s hearing.<br/>The verdict is not guilty.<br/>Not everyone seems to agree.<br/>Harry runs into Draco outside the ministry afterward.<br/>“Can I buy you a drink?” Draco is surprised.<br/>“Don’t be ridiculous. It’s 10 AM.” Laughter.<br/>“Scared, Malfoy?” Grins.<br/>Draco can’t say no to a drink now, can he?</p><p>Harry writes a letter to Mother.<br/>She shows Draco.<br/>He was thanking her for the time in the forest.<br/>He claimed to be in her debt.<br/>She invited him to Christmas dinner.</p><p>Harry shows up to Christmas with Teddy.<br/>Teddy manages to turn his hair blond like Draco’s and his eyes green like Harry’s.<br/>Harry smiles at him.

It’s ok.”</p><p>Draco is sitting outside in the snow with a bloody nose.<br/>Harry and Weasley are fighting.<br/>Granger comes out, sits next him.<br/>“Let me help you.” He doesn’t want to, but he lets her.<br/>“I’m sorry about him. He has a hard time letting go.” She is sincere.<br/>“I deserve it.” Not a pity party.
