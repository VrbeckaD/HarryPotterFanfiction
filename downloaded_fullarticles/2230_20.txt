    <p>Hermione was not quite sure when exactly did she started noticing the youngest of the Weasleys. She didn’t remember when she realised it was not Ron who she liked, but the glorious redhead lioness that made her go completely silent. Is no that Hermione was always talking, but whenever she was explaining something to the boys ―because of course, they always needed a bit more help with studies― and Ginevra walked past, she would stare and stop talking, earning a few weird looks and questions from Ron or Harry. </p><p>She was sixteen when she caught the first glimpse of the youngest Weasley staring back. How long had she bee missing that? She could feel the blood rushing to her cheeks for being caught mid stare. It was on the middle of a quidditch practice, Harry had just tuned into the new quidditch captain and because of all the fuzz about him being ‘the chosen one’ there were a lot of people interested. A lot. It was insane how many students were only interested in Harry’s fame an don’t in the actual sport. It was good fun to watch when no one was almost dying for being able to stay on their broom.<br/>
The witch was eyeing how Ginny had become taller and you can tell she had become fitter. Her hair was longer, her eyes burnt with the same fire as always. She couldn’t appreciate much, but she could guess her arms and legs ―which she could definitely appreciate through those pants that Ginny wore a bit tighter― had drop fat and gained muscle. The brunet was looking right at her tights and butt when Ginny looked at her. Hermione froze like a bunny in front of car lights while the younger smiled a bit too smug. After the shocker, she smiled back with rosy cheeks and an apologetic look in her eyes even thought she could have probably faked it, she was totally exposing herself and her feelings. She didn’t think of that until later and slapped herself mentally. </p><p>For the rest of the practice she couldn’t help but noticed that Ginny was also looking at her. A lot. Was it because she had been caught? Or was she just too oblivious? She didn’t know, but she did feel like things would probably change. How should she go about it? Hermione had actually never thought about the situation. First of all, they were two girls and even though witches and wizards were a bit more tolerating about this kind of stuff than muggles, there was still part of them that would look weird at you if you were not careful. Regardless, Hermione was not worried about that, she knew she could deal with a few stares and hate words, she had her whole life. No. What she was worried about was Ginny’s reaction if she found out. . . or if Hermione built up courage enough to tell her how she really felt. She didn’t want to lose her friendship, she valued that much more than anything else and she didn’t want to make things awkward. It was nice going to the Burrow and sleeping with her, talking till late night hours and giggling about really dumb stuff. </p><p>A small smile came up on her lips as the quidditch team finished up. The young witch stood up and went to the boys.</p><p>“Congratulations on getting the keeper’s position Ron” she said patting him on the shoulder. </p><p>“Thanks, I thought I was going to fail that last score” said the boy with an enormous smile on his face. </p><p>“Cormac had nothing against you Ron” said a too familiar voice that sent shivers down Hermione’s spine. But what sent her over the edge was the feather like touch on her arm. Ginny had grab her upper arm as a sign of affection and smile at her when Hermione looked at her with a tangled smiled on her lips. She could feel herself heating up again and tried for the life of her to control it.</p><p>“Yes, he’s kind of a douche” the brunette totally agreed with her, taking initiative and resting her hand in the small of Ginny’s back in return to her touch. </p><p>“That was the weirdest trial ever” said Harry that was still talking to some girls to tell them that they didn’t make the cut and was walking towards them with a pained expression on his face. At this, both girls drop their arms to the side and look at him. </p><p>“It’s because seventy percent of the people that came today was more interested on looking or talking to you than actually playing quidditch, Harry” said Hermione in an almost to sassy voice. This only made the young boy twist his lips in an expression that could only be read as discomfort. The rest of the guys just laughed and brushed it off, in the end they managed to fish up good candidates and ended up with a good team. Or at least that’s what Harry thought.</p><p>They all walked back to the castle together and Hermione was thrilled that Ginny had decided to wrap her arm around her shoulders since she had grown taller than her. In return, she hugged her at her waist and couldn’t stop smirking. It was not that they weren’t like that sometime, but this time it meant much more for Hermione because it made her feel things. A dark thought crossed her mind and she tried to brush it away but couldn’t. </p><p>What if it was a bad thing that it made her feel things? Maybe she was taken advantage of the situation and taking Ginny’s friendly touches to feel something the redhead was not trying to express. Maybe she should. . . No. She had stop. She knew Ginny only meant friendship and she was not going to take advantage or think anything about it or expect anything. Not until at least she had a bit more proof. She was afraid of taking the leap. It was too soon yet. Maybe later on? But she knew she probably would never do it. She had been feeling like that for about a year and still didn’t make any advances. She still needed to tread waters first, light touches, more than just as friends, maybe a hand up her thigh a little too high? </p><p>Hermione shook her head to get those thoughts away. They were too dangerous, and Ginny was starting to look at her with curiosity. She new she made faces when she was thinking, it was horrible that sometimes she could be read like an open book when she was not focusing on school or homework. When she was with Ginny she was like that, more emotional than rational. More like she made her like that, the redhead made her comfortable enough to be able to express more. </p><p>“Hermione?” they had stopped and Ron, Harry and Ginny where looking at her. She could still feel Ginny’s arms tightly wrapped around her shoulders.<br/>
“Ah, yes, I would like to eat before going to bed actually” they had been talking about dinner and if she was hungry or not. </p><p>“Good, is good to have a healthy appetite” said the youngest of the Weasley with a grin of approval, turning to go into the great hall well there was still a bit of student having dinner. They hadn’t realised the trials had gone for so long. But then again, as said before, it was an unusual trial. The four lions at down at Gryffindor’s table and started serving was what left of dinner. Hermione, a bit disappointed that she had missed the beef pie started cutting some chicken legs for herself. She took note on how close Ginny was sitting next to her. They had all the space in the table, but she could still feel her firm thighs brushing up against hers. Her almost burnt plan about making some advanced popped up again in her head like a puppy would pop their head asking for more treats. She could feel her heart rushing at the thought of it but. . .</p><p>“Hey Ginny, could you pass me the mash potatoes please” she said, resting her hand high on the lioness thighs. She swore she could see a bit of a blush on the other cheek, but the curtain of glorious red head covered her face when she turned her head to look at the plate and take it for Hermione. Instead of giving it to the brunette, who had lifted her hands ―reluctantly if we were specific― she stuck out her tongue and served Hermione a good portion, the same one Hermione served herself every time, actually. Ginny had been looking at her for longer than she expected. The brunette just said thank you and, in a bold act kissed Ginny’s cheek and turned immediately to her plate and started eating as if nothing.  </p><p>“Oi Ginny you ‘aight?” she could hear Ron say and snapped her head in her direction just naturally. She was hiding behind her hair again.</p><p>“Yeah Ron I’m fine I just remembered that time Fred and George dissolved your clothes in the middle of the patio and you were standing buck naked. I couldn’t contain the laughter” she gained a few laughs from Hermione, Harry and a few Gryffindor sitting next by. At this, his brother turned completely red and stuff another piece of potato in his mouth. The night was going perfect, she was content with what she had done, with Ginny’s company. But she now she wished to be alone with her. Maybe it was enough for today and she will leave the rest to flourish on its own. </p><p>They ended up going all together to the common room, boys went their ways and the both girls started going up their stairs. First stop was Ginny’s room, shared with other fours girls in her year. The redhead opened the door and then turned around to say goodbye to Hermione and gave her a hug. A warm, tight hug that both hold up for a bit too long, but neither wanted to let go. Hermione was the first to broke off carefully since she could see a couple more girls coming up as well. </p><p>“Good night Gin” she said in the affectionate tone she had reserved only for the girl.</p><p>“Good night Mione” the other said in return with a similar tone.</p><p>Hermione went to bed with a smile on her lips that night.</p>
