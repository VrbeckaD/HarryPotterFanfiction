    <p>Kingsley Shacklebolt looked at the muggle minister who was smiling at him. </p><p>“This will be the last time we meet as ministers. I will step down next month,” said Kingsley.</p><p>“As painful as this parting is, I understand. I enjoyed these conversations with you. In the end I am just glad to know that this life exists- a life where the magic my daughter talks about is true. To know that there are wand wielding men defending us mere mortals, to know that the weight of this country is not on my shoulder alone,” said the man with a small smile.</p><p>“No law says that you can’t call an old friend for a tea or vice versa, Richard,” smiled Kingsley.</p><p>The Muggle minister smiled.</p><p>“Of course,”</p><p>“Now, who will be the successor?” </p><p>“As of now, two obvious men are fighting it out. Of course, there are more candidates in the fray. But these two are the likely candidates. One is Fabian Lowell. Extremism, no matter in what direction is not something we can live with. He has massive public support and I fear for the purebloods, dark or light or even the neutral ones. He is a maniac. And he has support. The generation, they are recovering from a war. It has been 13 years, yes. But the pain, the sorrow, the need for a closure, it is there, simmering beneath the surface. Something that just needs a bit of fire to get it to go,” said Kingsley.</p><p>“And the second?”</p><p>“It is him who makes me finally concede that there is something called a necessary evil. Blaise Zabini, pureblood with English ancestry from his mother’s side and Celtic- Italian ancestry from his father’s side. As English as they come in his upbringing and a pureblood. Zabinis were neutral, with a not so subtle lenience towards the dark. But that was more about the dark arts than their belief in muggle persecution. The boy- well man now. He is about to be 32 and was Harry’s year mate. Suffice to say the Head of the Auror Department and the Head of Unspeakables do not get along at all. However, Zabini is a Slytherin. He is very subtle,” said Kingsley.</p><p>“I have heard this name a few good times. Someone Harry disapproves of?” asked Richard dubious. He has met Harry Potter countless times now. Richard thinks, by now, he knows Harry better than Kingsley himself. Kingsley had brought Harry Potter, with a child in tow to him 13 years back asking him to take the kid in for some time. To let him calm down and get his grip on life. The frail 17-year-old and his godson had been welcomed in his house even though he and his wife, at first did not know how to help him with the grief. The boy was a recluse at first. It was Richard’s five and three-year-old sons who broke through Harry’s demeanour and soon, Harry was there everywhere. He would go home to see his wife mothering not just two but four of their children. </p><p>When the muggle world caught onto this new boy living with the Prime Minister’s family, he introduced Harry as his oldest to the world, adopted of course. However, it was soon forgotten for the next big gossip. Later, they introduced Teddy as their fourth child. Richard know his Wikipedia page now shows, four sons. </p><p>Harry Potter, he knows will be home getting scolded by Rachel for not arriving on time for dinner yesterday. He had woken up to the kid sneaking inside their home in the dead of the night silently pleading him to not awake Rachel then. </p><p>Richard Altair never expected his sons, except for Teddy, to have any wizarding ancestry, but they did. His younger boys attended Hogwarts and suffice to say, he is more than just a concerned Prime Minister when it comes to the fate of the Wizarding World. He is also a concerned parent of four. His first born, Aaron is now at the ministry, working as an intern under his brother and loving it very much. Harry had fought the decision every step of the way, but in the end he has yet to learn the art of denying the three spoilt brats yet. The second youngest Milan, is in his sixth year at Hogwarts. Teddy is now in his third year.</p><p>Richard and Rachel were 42 when they had their first born and 45 with the second born. He and Rachel jokes that they can be forgiven for adopting 17-year-old Harry Potter, no papers signed. In Teddy’s case, there were papers involved.</p><p>“I want what is best for my sons. If it is with Zabini as the Ministry head that they will remain safe, I will put everything we have here into the campaign. Ask me and you will get it,” said Richard.</p><p>“I am aware, Richard. Zabini will need a coup to win this. I know their camp is scheming. One of them should be able to come up with an idea to do something to ensure that they do not fall. I am waiting for their move. No Zabini- means we are going into another war. This time, there may be no stopping it,” said Kingsley.</p><p>“I will talk to Harry about it. If it means him supporting Zabini, then be it,” said Richard.</p><p>Kingsley nodded.</p><p>“But it is Harry’s choice in the end. The way you presented it; I know you expect me to convince Harry. You know how my son hates not having a choice. I will not do that to him ever. It is his decision. I am not really worried about my sons to that extent. I know Harry can take care of himself and will take care of Aaron, Milan and Teddy with everything in him,” said Richard firmly.</p><p>Kingsley nodded.</p><p>“You are not as Slytherin as you think,” said Richard smiling a little.</p><p>“You on the other hand, are more like a certain Potter I have known. Trust me when I say this- James Potter- he would have been very happy to know that his son has the guidance he would have given,” said Kingsley stood up to leave.</p><p>---------------------------</p><p>Richard smiled as he heard noises inside his house and his guards stood in attention. The snow was everywhere now and the Christmas trees in his house was glowing. He walked in and saw his wife working over a cake in the kitchen with the staff watching, standing to the side obediently.</p><p>They left seeing Richard.</p><p>“You are here. The boys are upstairs. They are already wreaking havoc. Harry is yet to be home. He said he will arrive after a meeting. When I get that-</p><p>The Floo popped in the living room causing both of them to rush in and there, on his ass was the Head Auror who was brushing off the floo powder. Harry Potter looked up to see the pointed glare from his mother and amused look from his father, not helpful at all. </p><p>He was soon blinded with three bodies crashing. It is not like Aaron doesn’t see him every day. But Harry likes him to be disciplined at work place and had asked him to be a professional while at work and not be a brat.  </p><p>Milan and Teddy on the other hand, Harry has not seen in over two months. Last time he had made an excuse to visit Hogwarts, McGonagall had practically rolled her eyes at him and said “Your brother, Mr Potter, while a very curious child, do not have your penchant for trouble or even Aaron’s. Teddy, has proved a mature marauder, I must say. Rest assured, I do not expect you for another four months because obviously you will be seeing them during Christmas.” All in a wry tone. Harry had protested that he was there on official capacity, all lies, which his former Professor knew very well. </p><p>He hugged all three of them tight and then got up from the tangle. He went over and knew how to win over his mother after years of trial and error. He wrapped his arms around her and his father smiled. Of course, Rachel huffed and scolded him for coming home late the other day and leaving before she was awake earlier this morning.    </p><p>“Kingsley said something?” asked Harry as he sat down next to his father.</p><p>“Zabini?”</p><p>“I hate to admit this, but Zabini is the only option we have. I – will have to forego my -eh deep seated distaste for him- and move forward,” said Harry.</p><p>“You mean you plain hate that guy. Father, you should see. Harry goes all red and curt whenever Zabini walks in. It is like, Harry is a trigger harpy and Zabini is the trigger. Well, but then again, he reacts the same with almost all his former year mates,” said Aaron.</p><p>“Thanks for that endorsement Aaron, I will be sure to do your assessment myself,” said Harry biting into the bacon. Aaron just wagged his tongue in a childish gesture. </p><p>“So, you have decided to put your trust in this guy?” asked Mother as she sat down by Harry’s side.</p><p>“Yes, we might not have much of a choice, to be honest,” said Harry sighing. The family ate, talking about the better things in life. They spoke of Rose, Ron and Hermione’s one year old who is also Harry’s goddaughter. Teddy decided he was going to look like Aaron for the day and all the other four found it amusing when Aaron went all proud about it. This is a regular occurrence. It is no secret that Aaron is Teddy’s hero, just like Harry is Aaron’s hero. Milan, is more like Harry than Harry cares to admit and that worries him. He can already see Milan getting into a lot of trouble.</p><p><br/>
Harry walked through the ministry corridor. He was soon greeted by Hermione who heads the Department of Magical Creatures now. She smiled at him as she walked over. </p><p>“How was the Christmas? How is Richard and Rachel?” asked Hermione.</p><p>“Both are well and asked you and Ron to reach one day early for the New Year celebrations,” said Harry.</p><p>“Definitely Harry. I hate that this holiday is marred with all this stupid politics. I get it Kingsley has been at top for long and people want a change, but Fabian? Honestly, how can they even think that he is up there for anything other than himself, blind selfishness,” said Hermione.</p><p>Harry smiled as he listened to his friend. She can go on and on about politics. Ron met them at her office. From the outside, Ron has nothing to do with the ministry. However, Ron and George’s business will fund this election for Zabini. Harry groaned at the thought of doing something for Zabini. He did not want to. That man is an utter prick who is a stickler for rules and carries heavy disdain for ‘Gryffindorishness’ as he likes to put it. Zabini was the epitome of a politician. Well dressed, sharp, closed off and to an extend mysterious which makes him appeal to the youth. Harry has to wonder about the sensibility of the generation.</p><p>Zabini was already there, Draco and Astoria on his one side and Pansy Parkinson with Theodore Nott on the other. Goyle sat in one of the bigger chairs with Daphne Greengrass and Millicent Bulstrode to his side. Astoria had no qualms as she walked over and greeted him with a hug, closely followed by Millicent. Daphne and Pansy remained in their seat but gave him curt nods.</p><p>Millicent is an auror and has even worked as Harry’s auror partner once he got over his initial distrust of her. Astoria is like a little sister to all of them, a healer and the one person who can hold them all from jumping at each other in anger. Draco lucked out on that; Harry has to admit. To be fair to Draco, he is one of the very devoted and loving husbands Harry has ever met. Much like his father before himself, with no dark lord to ruin their happiness.</p><p>Harry nodded to all the other three gents who returned the gesture but chose to just shoot a disdainful look at Zabini who returned it with ease. Harry has always thought that Zabini’s face itself has a permanent scowl.</p><p>Once discussions ceased and the funding files were signed all looked at Harry.</p><p>“We need something to boost his image. Because let us be honest, the current description would be the unspeakable with a permanent scowl on his face. He is not approachable and therefore shouldn’t hold the office. To sort this out- He should start behaving like a human being, first thing-</p><p>Harry heard a growl but did not pay it any mind. </p><p>“Second is that he should be seen. He should be everywhere and third, he needs to be seen with people who can be associated with the light side. I have a list,” said Harry.</p><p>“Having a politician for an adopted father seems to have done wonders for your intellect, Potter,” said Zabini. </p><p>Harry just gave him a look but did not answer.</p><p>“Potter is right. The ideal thing would be to be seen with the very symbol of light families. How about we start with New Years with the Weasleys?” asked Draco.</p><p>Harry thought about it a bit.</p><p>“The Weasleys are spending the Christmas at my home in the countryside. I will have to discuss this with my family before I say anything. Maybe we can postpone that meeting to after the holidays. Joining Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan Thomas in their book store, meeting Dennis Creevey and his wife at the pub, contributing to the businesses owned by the light families and the likes. I know you are wealthy Zabini as the funding we get from WWW is only so that we get the light families to ally with us in the long run because we will subtly reveal it to them where it comes from,” said Harry.</p><p>“Potter is right. We need to do this systematically and should not overdo it,” said Pansy, getting to her feet. This, Harry liked about her. She was always clear cut and firm. The Slytherins left. 
Harry watched Zabini step out. The man is a presence, no doubt and Harry mused how powerful a minister Zabini would be. He sighed and then Zabini turned and looked at him. Harry gave him a two fingered salute.</p><p>“Uncouth ruffian,” he heard Zabini snarl.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
