    <p>Harry stared out at the frosted lawn as he wrapped his arms around his legs and tugged his cloak tighter around himself. It was early in the morning but he couldn't sleep, his thoughts were locked on the trial that was coming up, his first trial.</p><p>He had had a nightmare again, another one about the face that he was taking part in a tournament that was well known for causing deaths and he was three years younger than the other participants. Luckily it was the start of the weekend so he didn't have to worry about suffering through lessons while sleep deprived. The winter was coming in early this year and Harry was enjoying the clearing quality of the cold air when a figure plopped itself down next to him.</p><p>"What are you doing out here Harry, it's half seven in the morning," Fred asked concerned. It was one of the few times that he had seen one of the twins so serious, his face was set and his blue eyes worried.</p><p>"Just thinking, or trying not to," Harry chuckled humourlessly.</p><p>"How long have you been out here?" Fred pushed.</p><p>"Don't know, since I woke up, it was still dark," Harry shrugged. Fred reached out and touched his cheek before cursing loudly.</p><p>"Harry your bloody frozen, come on you can think in front of the fire!" Fred said as he bodily yanked Harry to his feet and started tugging back towards the castle.</p><p>"Why are you up Fred?" Harry asked confused as he allowed the twin to tug him towards the castle.</p><p>"What did you call me?" Fred frowned stopping and turning to stare at Harry.</p><p>"Fred...I was pretty sure it was you...yeah it is you," Harry looked closer before nodding and stepping back.</p><p>"But how do you know? No one knows how to tell the difference between me and George, even mum bloody struggles most of the time!" Fred grabbed the top of Harry's arms and stared down at him intently. Harry was stunned at the outburst and blinked up at him.</p><p>"I... I don't know...you're just different," Harry stammered not sure what to do with this suddenly very, very serious Fred Weasley.</p><p>"How?" Fred pushed giving Harry a light shake.</p><p>"You...you're the quieter one, more thoughtful, George is the louder one and more confident. You're slightly broader than George, he's a tiny bit taller, your eyes are slightly greener blue, George's are bluey blue," Harry rambled.</p><p>"You really can tell us apart," Fred said softly.</p><p>"Y... yeah...I'm...sorry?" Harry offered shakily, completely confused now. He wasn't entirely sure that he wasn't still dreaming.</p><p>"No... Merlin Harry, don't be sorry I'm just shocked. Harry you're the first person since we were born to be really able to tell us apart and it not to be a partial guess. How come you haven't told us before?" Fred asked softly as he loosened his grip.</p><p>"I didn't tell you specifically but I've called you by your names individually," Harry shrugged.</p><p>"You...you're right, but always when we were bloody together idiot!" Fred sighed as he started tugging Harry again.</p><p>"It's a bit difficult when neither of you are very far from the other," Harry huffed. Fred chuckled and pulled him closer to his body, winding his arm around Harry's shoulders.</p><p>"Fair enough. Bloody hell Harry, you really are freezing, you're going to make yourself ill," Fred frowned remembering why he was dragging Harry inside.</p><p>"I just lost track of time, didn't really notice how cold I was," Harry shrugged.</p><p>"What's weighing so heavily on your mind that you didn't notice when your body temperature dropped below freezing?" Fred asked slightly angrily as he wrapped his cloak and arm around Harry's slender body and then picked up the pace.</p><p>"Ron..." Harry sighed eventually.</p><p>"Ron, Harry my little brother is an idiot of the highest degree," Fred shook his head.</p><p>"But he doesn't mean it?" Harry part asked part stated.</p><p>"Oh no he bloody means it and that makes it all the worse. He's so bloody obsessed with what the rest of us have done and who we are that he isn't actually trying to find his own niche. He's a complete and utter jealous twat and pathetic at the same time. He's my younger brother and I love him, but Merlin I really don't like him sometimes. Bill and Charlie only met you this summer and they knew that you didn't put your name in that damned cup. The fact that Ron threw his toys out the pram is bloody typical of him, the time when you really needed him to be around and he was too busy sulking and pouting over how unfair his life is!" Fred ranted until he was tugging Harry up the steps to the front door.</p><p>"I... that's kind of going through my mind yeah. It's not just him though, it's most of the school," Harry frowned to himself, unconsciously snuggling closer to Fred.</p><p>"Oh! There you are, you found him thank Merlin!" Harry looked up to see George racing across the Entrance Hall to them.</p><p>"You were looking for me specifically?" Harry asked looking up at Fred confused as George reached them.</p><p>"Yeah, Neville woke and found you missing, he didn't know what to do but didn't want to wake Ron so he came and woke us. Good guy that one, he's searching for you as well," Fred explained.</p><p>"Bloody hell Harry, you're frozen! Come on, we need to get you to the kitchen and get something warm in you!" George cursed as he touched Harry's cheek. Before he knew what was happening he found himself squashed between the twins and walked quickly to the kitchens. George had him in front of the fire and started rubbing his hands while Fred turned to the house elves.</p><p>"Could one of you get one hot chocolate and two teas for us please, and some soup and could one of you go find Neville Longbottom, he should be searching around the castle. Tell him we found Harry and for him to go back to bed, everything's ok," Fred requested. The two house elves bowed before hurrying away to do as they were asked.</p><p>"What the hell were you doing outside long enough to get like this Harry?" George asked concerned as he now stuffed Harry's hands underneath his armpits to try and warm them up.</p><p>"He was brooding over our prat of a brother," Fred grumbled before Harry could respond as he started tugging off Harry's shoes and rubbing his feet ignoring Harry's protests.</p><p>"Well as Percy isn't here anymore, that means Ron. Has the idiot said something else? I thought he had moved onto silent treatment at least!" George scowled</p><p>"He's not said anything more, just his natural state of pratishness," Fred snorted.</p><p>"Guys?" Harry interrupted.</p><p>"Sorry Harry," Fred grinned sheepishly.</p><p>"I would say that you should have made friends with Neville rather than our little prat, but then we wouldn't have gotten you so..." George grinned and shrugged removing Harry's hands and giving them one last rub before settling into a seat opposite him and sorting out the tray of drinks and soup the House elf had brought.</p><p>"Hey Georgie, I found out something interesting about our Harry," Fred grinned as he sat back as well before taking his tea and soup bowl.</p><p>"Oh, what's that?" George asked looking between them curiously, even more so when Harry blushed.</p><p>"Harry can tell us apart, no guessing, he actually knows who's who," Fred chuckled when George's eyes grew wider and he looked at Harry stunned who now seemed to be finding his hot chocolate very interesting.</p><p>"You can tell us apart? How...are you being serious?" George frowned at Fred who smiled.</p><p>"Apparently, I'm the quieter more thoughtful one while you're more outgoing and the first in there, I'm broader while your slightly taller and my eyes are slightly greener while yours are bluer," Fred recited.</p><p>"You can really tell us apart?" George asked Harry who nodded, feeling his cheeks get even redder.</p><p>"Y... yeah, since before my second year when I stayed at the Burrow," Harry explained.</p><p>"Come to think of it, you look at us specifically when you say our names. I'm just so used to everyone saying both our names or just calling us the twins didn't really pick up on it...wow...it feels odd," George grinned.</p><p>"Yeah, I think I might have gotten a little over excited when Harry told me and scared him," Fred said softly glancing at Harry apologetically.</p><p>"No, it's alright, just didn't know if I had upset you or something," Harry shrugged before sipping his hot chocolate.</p><p>"Definitely not upset, especially not with you being able to tell us apart," Fred smiled. Harry blinked at him, confused about the emphasis that he had placed on the word you.</p><p>"Have your soup Harry. What happened to drive you outside at stupid o'clock in the morning exactly?" George asked.</p><p>"It was nothing," Harry shook his head.</p><p>"Harry, you don't sit outside freezing your cute little arse off for nothing, what happened?" Fred pushed.</p><p>"It's not fair when you tag team me!" Harry grumbled.</p><p>"Don't tempt us," George muttered making Harry frown confused before Fred took his attention.</p><p>"What happened Harry?"</p><p>"Seamus made a comment last night about me being an attention seeker, and I heard him and Ron laughing about how I probably wouldn't even make it through the first trial anyway. I... I had a nightmare," He flushed embarrassed at having to admit it.</p><p>"Hey, hey, have you been having a lot of nightmares?" Fred moved to kneel in front of him, brushing his fingers through Harry's hair so he could see his eyes despite Harry still staring determinedly at his lap.</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Harry," George's tone was shockingly stern as he knelt down next to Fred.</p><p>"Yes...I know what the first task is," Harry said quietly.</p><p>"What?" Fred took his hand startling Harry enough to look up and find concern in their eyes.</p><p>"Dragons, I have to get passed dragons," Harry felt sick saying it out loud.</p><p>"What?! Have you got a plan? Do you know what you're going to do?" Fred demanded.</p><p>"We will come up with something, a plan," George nodded.</p><p>"I have a plan," Harry licked his lips. "I'm going to summon my broom and fly. If I can get the summoning spell to work," He added gloomily.</p><p>"Ok, we have two days until the trial, we will help you," Fred nodded.</p><p>"What?" Harry blinked.</p><p>"Harry, we have been summoning things from under mum's beady eyes for years, summoning charms we can do in our sleep," George smirked.</p><p>"And we will do a little flying training, dodging and manoeuvring," Fred nodded.</p><p>"Guys..." Harry looked between them.</p><p>"Hey, you will be fine. Now, come on, Fred will take you to the dorms and you can get ready for the day, I will go set up the classroom, we will get a little practice in," George touched Harry's shoulder before standing and striding out the room.</p><p>"Fred," Harry looked at the remaining twin confused.</p><p>"Did you really think we wouldn't help you. Come on, shower, dress and then practice," Fred tugged Harry to his feet before leading the way out the kitchen, trailing a very confused Harry behind him.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>"I think I'm getting it!" Harry said brightly as they walked down the stairs.</p><p>"You are definitely getting better and better," George grinned wrapping his arm around Harry's shoulder.</p><p>"You managed to start summoning it in a few hours, a little longer and you will be sorted," Fred nodded wrapping his arm around Harry from the other side.</p><p>"Thank you, guys, I haven't felt this confident that I might survive since my name came out the Goblet," Harry said sincerely.</p><p>"Hey Potter! Potter. Potter stin..." The Hufflepuff, one of Cedric's friends Harry thought, who had been pointing to his badge started spluttering as the quick spell from George had the badge flying up his nose, a second quick spell from Fred had his hair turning bogy green.</p><p>"So, lunch," George said cheerfully, urging a gawping Harry into walking again.</p><p>"Guys, you could get into trouble for that!" Harry hissed.</p><p>"Harry, we spend half our lives in detention, or escaping it," George laughed tugging him over to the Gryffindor table.</p><p>"Guys you don't have to do this just because I had a... wobble this morning. I'm fine," Harry insisted as they sat down.</p><p>"Harry, you shouldn't have to put up with them treating you like this," George shook his head.</p><p>"We didn't step in before because..." Fred paused and Harry looked between them confused as they exchanged a loaded look. "We couldn't. But that's changed, and we are involved now,"</p><p>"Stop looking so worried Harry, just let us look after you," George reached out and touched his fingers to Harry's cheek confusing the raven-haired teen even more.</p><p>"Don't you trust us?" Fred asked.</p><p>"Of course I do," Harry answered quickly and honestly. The twins were pranksters, and took life as it came, trying to see the fun in life. But by the same respects they were strong, could be serious when needed and were good people.</p><p>"Then stop worrying," George grinned wrapping his arm around Harry's shoulder and tugging him down into a seat at the Gryffindor table.</p><p>"Harry!" Hermione dropped into the seat opposite the three of them, dropping her pile of books down and looked at him critically. "You're looking a little better,"</p><p>"The twins have been helping me with the summoning charm, I think I might have it down before the trial," Harry smiled at his friend's bluntness.</p><p>"You will have it," Fred said firmly.</p><p>"Especially with us at your side," George nudged Harry.</p><p>"He managed to move the book most of the way across the room in a few hours," Fred grinned.</p><p>"Why am I not shocked that you two are good at the summoning charm," Hermione snorted, but she was looking between the twins with something in his eyes that confused Harry. Looking either side of him he noticed that the twins had a look of their own on their faces he couldn't pin down. When they realised that he was looking at them they smiled and turned to their lunch, leaving him glaring between the three of them. Whatever it was about, it was to do with him.</p><p>"What the hell do you think you are doing?!"</p><p>Harry grimaced and slumped a little in his seat. He had been having a fairly good day, and he was not in the mood for Ron to ruin it, but it seemed that he would not get a whole day of peace. Looking up he could see Ron's face was already bright red, not great.</p><p>"We are having lunch dear brother,"</p><p>"I know that you can be a little slow, but this is impressive even by your standards,"</p><p>"I was fairly sure that food was something even you understood,"</p><p>"I'm fairly sure it's the only thing that he understands George,"</p><p>"That is a very good point Fred. Perhaps we should explain,"</p><p>"Ronikins lunch is a moment during the day where you sit down..."</p><p>"...or stand up I suppose..."</p><p>"...Quite right brother, you could stand up..."</p><p>"...and then you eat various foods, lighter than a supper food..."</p><p>"...but heavier than breakfast foods..."</p><p>"...and you eat them, which is the act of placing food into your mouth..."</p><p>"...chewing and swallowing,"</p><p>The snickers grew louder the more the twins talked, and the more the twins talked and the louder the laughter got, the redder Ron got. He was torn between amusement and worry about the blow out that was about to come.</p><p>"Why are you sitting with HIM," Ron spat. He seemed to realise that he had just stepped into dangerous territory when Harry flinched back, and the twins' eyes narrowed. Ron took a step back, paling rapidly taking away the redness in his face as the twins stood up.</p><p>"Guys," Harry quickly caught hold of their hands and tugged at them, asking them to sit back down with his eyes.</p><p>"You have had a reprieve," Fred grunted sitting down.</p><p>"You aren't forgiven," George nodded also sitting down and placing the bowl of sausages in front of Harry. Those around them were staring open mouthed now at the events taking place, Harry was sure no one had ever really seen the twins looking angry before, even when Slytherin were playing their dirtiest at a match they looked annoyed.</p><p>"Why are you taking his side?!" Ron whined. Harry felt a flash of amusement as Hermione actually face palmed opposite him.</p><p>"Because dear brother, you are a moron and he is not, you are a moron and he is not. You are in the wrong and are a terrible friend," George growled.</p><p>Ron seemed to debate with himself about biting back, and finally thought better of it and stormed off, leaving a lot of people gawping around them. Harry turned to the twins, not really sure what to say, but he had a lump in his throat at someone besides Hermione actually sticking up for him and saying out loud that they believed him.</p><p>He was met with the twins, once again, grinning faces and the plate of bacon being held out to him. "You need to have something to eat before we get back into doing the spell," George urged him.</p><p>"Thank you," He said softly.</p><p>"You're more than welcome," Fred nudged him. "I can even pass the eggs,"<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>"Harry, come on," Harry blinked confused at suddenly finding George standing in front of him holding out his hand.</p><p>He had been sitting in front of the fireplace in the common room for who knew how long after having another bad dream. The sudden appearance of George startled him, and he blinked confused at the twin. "George?"</p><p>"You really can tell us apart," George smiled brightly, if a little tiredly, at him.</p><p>"Yes..."</p><p>George just smiled at him, something in his smile that Harry once again could not place, before he reached down and tugged Harry to his feet. Blinking with confusion and tiredness, and a little frustration if he were honest - he didn't know what all these looks being exchanged were but everyone around him seemed to - as George toed him up the stairs.</p><p>He was about to protest that he didn't want to go to his dorm, when George turned into the sixth-year boys' dorm and pulled him into the room. He had never been in here before and he looked around with interest until George hustled him over to a bed in the corner.</p><p>"George?" Fred yawned sitting up a little. Harry flushed when he realised that he was being nudged over to Fred's bed.</p><p>"Harry had another dream," George said by way of explanation, and Fred just nodded before tiredly groping for his wand and waving it at the bed. It expanded big enough to fit the three of them in, and before Harry could even think of protesting George lifted him up and threw him onto the bed.</p><p>"This is cheating," The dark-haired teen huffed as Fred's arm locked around him to stop him getting up off the bed, and George hopped in on his other side, cutting off his escape that way.</p><p>"This shocks you?" George smirked.</p><p>"Not particularly," Harry glared balefully.</p><p>"He's like a kitten glaring," Fred chuckled sleepily, pulling Harry against his chest. Harry wriggled a little uncomfortably, but then George threw the covers over the three of them and cuddled in as well, and the heat of their bodies sank into him, and the feeling of safety. He wasn't stupid, he knew that this wasn't normal friendship behaviour, but he was too tired, too stressed and too lonely to look any deeper into what this was.</p><p>"What..." He mumbled sleepily as he felt a spell washing over him, he was falling rapidly to sleep and the spell had woken him just a little.</p><p>"Shush it's ok, just go to sleep Harry," George's voice reassured him.</p><p>"We're here, you're absolutely safe Harry," Fred added. With that promise in mind he drifted off into the best sleep that he had had for months.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Harry was a little confused when he woke to find himself alone in the bed, the twins gone, in fact the whole room was empty. Dragging himself out of bed he stretched, enjoying the feeling of a good night's sleep. He made his way out the 6th year dorms and was about to make his was to his own dorm to shower and get dressed for the day, when he heard quiet arguing from below. It wasn't an unusual occurrence, but the fact he could pick out Hermione and the Twins' voices perked his interests.</p><p>Slipping down the stairs he could see Hermione was looking furious and protective, which generally meant that this was about him, and the Twins were looking annoyed. He padded closer on his bare feet trying to hear what they were arguing about, hoping to understand what it was that those damned looks were about.</p><p>"...completely improper! You have ruined any chance...let you near him again!" Hermione was hissing as though she had been possessed by Crookshanks. Harry cursed mentally at the giggling 3rd years nearby who were covering part of the conversation from him.</p><p>"...ticle 7 of the...ting acts say that should the su...isve partner be in distress the other/others can offer comfort. He was...and tired. And we used the right spells! Check him!" George was hissing back.</p><p>"Which did you..." Hermione still looked suspicious but less angry.</p><p>"The Propriis Contactu," Fred answered grumpily.</p><p>"Fine! I will check and if I find..."</p><p>"We wouldn't hurt him!" Both twins growled looking furious. Deciding that stopping his three closest friends from arguing was more important than finding out what was going on, Harry hurried over.</p><p>"Hey guys!" The three of them looked guilty, which was impressive considering this was the twins.</p><p>"Hey, we didn't want to wake you," Fred smiled.</p><p>"Did you sleep ok?" Hermione asked concerned, throwing a pointed look at the Twins. The twins were looking more annoyed by the second.</p><p>"I think I slept the best I have in months," He blurted out before going bright red. However, Hermione was looking a little happier and the twins were practically glowing, so he guessed it was worth his humiliation.</p><p>"Right, go and get you little behind dressed for the day, and then we will go practice some more," George urged.</p><p>"Or I could help you change," Fred smirked.</p><p>"I'm ok!" Harry squeaked at the same time as Hermione growled "You will not!"</p><p>Luckily the twins were smirking and looking quite happy with themselves, so Harry reckoned it was safe to leave them together while he grabbed a quick shower and changed.</p><p>When he got back down the stairs the three were exactly where he had left them waiting, though they were having what seemed a much more amicable conversation about the summoning charm, and Hermione actually seemed quite impressed by what they were telling her.</p><p>"Ok, off we go!" Fred wrapped his arm around Harry's shoulder.</p><p>"What about breakfast?" Hermione asked.</p><p>"All sorted my clever little witch," George looked very pleased with himself as the wrapped his around Harry's other shoulder. The two refused to tell Harry and Hermione what they had planned as they led them through the school, though Harry did think they nearly gave in when he applied his puppy dog eyes, which he had discovered worked shockingly well against the twins in his second year.</p><p>They managed to resist however, and finally they stopped outside one of the many unused classrooms in the school. Fred and George unwrapped themselves from Harry, leaving his sides feeling a little cold, as they stepped to the door and grabbed the door handle, before looking at them as though ready to make a presentation.</p><p>"Lady and Gentleman, you our honoured to be trusted..."</p><p>"...with the secret workshop of Weasley Wizarding Wheezes!" They grinned before throwing open the door.</p><p>Harry gasped with wonder and stepped inside the classroom, which had been transformed into what looked like a scientists laboratory, ok slightly like a mad scientist but he did not think the twins would be offended by that comparison.</p><p>There were at least table long tables set up around the room, each covered with different products, half of them were covered with potions ingredients and equipment with several cauldrons bubbling merrily away, puffing out different coloured smoke and steam, one was even puffing out unicorn shaped bubbles. Those tables were pin neat and perfectly ordered.</p><p>The other tables were covered with gears and metal, wood and various other materials, parchment covered in drawings and writings, plans and ideas were everywhere. And floating in the air were dozens of products, including what looked like little fairies who cooed and flew straight at Harry when they spotted him.</p><p>He laughed happily as they playfully flicked his fringe, one perching on the edge of his glasses, as three more landed on his shoulders, the rest floating in front of his face. They were all giggling, which was a sound like tinkling wind chimes, and cooing at him.</p><p>"Ladies, ladies, please!" George coughed waving them away.</p><p>"They're fine, they're amazing! What are they for?" Harry asked raising his arms and smiling as they landed and made themselves comfy.</p><p>"We haven't actually worked that out yet, they are complete charm and potion work, not real fairies. But they have a high level of consciousness as well," Fred explained.</p><p>"This is...amazing," Harry sighed looking around the room again. He noted a few arm chairs, bean bags and even a large double bed.</p><p>"Really? You like it?" George smiled.</p><p>"I love it!" Harry beamed.</p><p>"We took this room over when we were in third year, cast a load of spells to try and protect it. The House elves guard it for us as well," Fred explained.</p><p>"We came up with an object that acts like a muggle hoover, makes their job a lot easier, so they help us in return," George shrugged.</p><p>"We tried to give one to mum for Yule last year but she said she wouldn't encourage us," Fred looked away a little, forced cheer and rebellion on his face.</p><p>"I will buy one off you!" Hermione said, making them start a little. They had actually, embarrassingly, forgotten slightly that she was there.</p><p>"Sorry?" Fred blinked.</p><p>"I want to buy one. My mum will love it! She is always wanting things from our world, and she will love something that can do the hoovering for her!" Hermione smiled.</p><p>"Right, sure, we can do that! Tell us what her favourite colour is and approximately how tall she is and we will custom one for her!" George grinned happily plucking a blank piece of parchment from a pile.</p><p>"You guys are brilliant!" Harry laughed spinning around trying to take everything in. The fairies giggling and flew into the air at the movement.</p><p>"You really like it?" Fred asked.</p><p>"I love it!" Harry said firmly. "Sirius would give both arms and legs to see this!"</p><p>"How is he?" Fred asked gently, brushing Harry's fringe from his eyes.</p><p>"As good as can be expected. He...he is actually planning on calling tonight, if you would like, maybe you would want to meet him, both of you?"</p><p>"We would like that," Fred smiled.</p><p>"Are you still planning on the joke shop?" Harry asked.</p><p>"Yes, when we get enough, which hopefully with the money we are making from owl orders should be in the next few years, we are planning on going to Gringotts and getting a loan. If we have a base collateral to give them, then they will give us a fairly decent loan, especially if Bill will put in a word for us,"</p><p>"It sounds like you have a good plan," Harry smiled.</p><p>"We do, there is a shop in Diagon that we have our eye on, hopefully it will still be there when we can afford to rent a place somewhere like Diagon," George responded wrapping himself around Harry from behind.</p><p>"You're going to put poor Zonko out of business I hope you know," Harry said looking around himself.</p><p>"We are nowhere near him!" Fred protested.</p><p>"I don't know about that," Hermione muttered gazing intently at the fairy who had landed on her finger. The twins both stared at her wide eyed while Harry grinned happily.</p><p>"See the brightest witch has spoken," He chuckled.</p><p>"Harry!" Hermione flushed bright red. "This isn't teaching you the summoning charm, stop hanging off of him and lets get to this. Three days, we will have you perfect at it and you can show Ron and everyone else that they can go suck it!" Hermione ranted.</p><p>"There are practically flames coming from her!"</p><p>"I see what Ron means about her being a little scary sometimes," The twins blinked.</p><p>"You should see her really fired up," Harry snickered as he moved to where Hermione indicated.</p><p>"This isn't really fired up?!" Fred coughed as George hurried to dig out a box from under a pile of parchment for Harry to summon.</p><p>"Nope!" Harry popped the P and grinned at Fred as he clearly tried to imagine Hermione even more fired.</p><p>"Three days to go, lets do this!" Hermione smirked.</p>
