    <p>Dear Lily,</p><p> </p><p>What a way to spend time, but I just had to write to you first.</p><p>We just got home from London, it’s the first of September. I met Harry. I met your Harry! He was standing in King’s Cross station all by himself. Can you imagine? Looking so small and lost - that’ll be Dumbledore, never explaining anything or seeing anything’s done quite right and Harry had no idea how to get through to the platform.</p><p>I knew him as soon as I saw him but I - well you don’t go up to a boy on his first day of school and say “hello dear, you look just like your parents” under these circumstances - now do you? There was a bit of subterfuge went into the whole thing. Well, I walked past him and loudly declared myself a witch for all and sundry to hear, blast the Statute of Secrecy, and he came up to me himself and asked.</p><p>I’m sure James and Sirius got up to worse on that platform, knowing them. Probably caused at least one major incident.</p><p>He asked me how to get through to the platform, Lily. Your little boy. I wanted to give him a hug. He looked so thin.<em> </em>I’ll wager this is Dumbledore’s doing. He tells us Harry’s safe and I see he’s skin and bone? This isn’t the only letter I’ll be writing tonight, let me tell you.</p><p>Broken glasses and hair that’d break a comb. Absolutely rigid with nerves. But he was so polite. I don’t know why it should make me cry that he asked me so politely how to get onto the platform. Bless him. I’m being ridiculous. But he shouldn’t have had to be alone.</p><p>But Harry’s safe and he’s at Hogwarts and that’s what’s most important. I think Ron might have gone to sit with him on the train - he’s a good boy, my Ron. Sharp too, he saw how I got Harry’s attention at the station. He’ll know what to do.</p><p>It’s silly but I’m so terribly worried that Harry will be lonely. When the owls arrive with the post, what will he think when there’s nothing for him? Oh Lily, what about Christmas?</p><p>I’ll make him a sweater.</p><p>He’s his own boy and he’ll make his own way - but I promise you that if he needs anything, I’ll do whatever I can. Arthur too. The way you’d love Harry if you were here, I can’t give him that - no one else could love my kids the way I do - of course not. But if it were the other way round and I were gone, well I hope someone would try. I hope they’d give loving my kids a bloody good try.</p><p>This is all getting a bit dramatic. I left some soup on the stove that I just remembered.</p><p>I’ll post this. I don’t want to tear it up but I don’t want it left around the house in case someone finds it, so I’ll send it to Godric’s Hollow.</p><p>With love,</p><p> </p><p>Molly Weasley</p>
