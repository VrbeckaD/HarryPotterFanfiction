    <p>"Hey! 'Mione, where're you going?" Ron shouted from his seat at their table in the Three Broomsticks.</p>
<p>Hermione flashed her friends a reassuring smile over her shoulder. "I wanted to get some birthday shopping done and there's supposed to be a new book out that I wanted. I'll meet you at Honeydukes."</p>
<p>Nobody had time to reply as she slipped quickly out the door and down the street. She walked quickly through the bustling crowds, following a sensation in the pit of her stomach that she found difficult to deny – it felt like a rope was tied around her waist, pulling her towards something. She paused at the edge of town, where the noisy, milling crowd of students and adults alike gave way to what appeared to be a smooth, solid dirt track. Still, the urge to follow pushed her to continue, and so she took a step. Her foot sank into a thick, clinging mixture of moss and mud. After a brief struggle to free herself, she muttered, “<em>Tergeo</em>.”  Once again clean, she cast a charm on her feet to make her footsteps feather-light. Stepping forwards again, she sank less than an inch, and was soon striding confidently along the track.</p>
<p>Some minutes later, when the village and its people were nothing more than a dull buzz behind her, Hermione released a breath she hadn't realised she was holding. Her breath formed a white, cotton-candy cloud before her - odd for this time of year, even in Scotland – and then it disappeared. Every time she let out a breath, the moisture vanished, less than half a foot from her mouth. Puzzled, with her heart beating a tattoo against her chest, she lifted a hand up, stretching out her arm. For a heartbeat, it felt like pins and needles had engulfed the limb, and then it was just a pleasant tingle running up her arm. Her hand disappeared from sight and, emboldened by the apparent acceptance of the strange wards, she followed. The same happened, only spread throughout her entire body, and she could once again see her hand. Looking about warily, wand clutched between her tingling fingers, she saw that the snow was utterly devoid of disturbance. It struck her as odd that someone would ward an empty hilltop. Feeling her curiosity piqued and, given the stupidity of her actions, strangely confident, she pressed onwards.</p>
<p>After several steps, the tingling of the wards washed away, as if a shower had been cut off, and Hermione stopped. In front of her, appearing out of nowhere, was a huge, gated mansion. There were three floors lined with darkened windows, above which sat tall, pointed roofs of weathered, slate-grey tile. It looked every part the old, Victorian mansion, with an apron of patio slabs that lead around one side of the building, presumably to what had once been a servants’ entrance. She wrapped her hand lightly around one of the black bars of the towering, wrought iron gate and the great, shaggy, black dog dozing on the top step lifted its massive head. It stared intently at Hermione for several seconds, while she remained frozen with bated breath, then lowered its head and went back to napping.</p>
<p>“Magnificent, is it not?”</p>
<p>Startled, Hermione spun in the direction of the voice. Not far from her stood an unfamiliar witch. Her robes, a deep burgundy reminiscent of fine wine, clung to her tall, slender frame, and her sleek, black hair reminded Hermione of Morticia Addams. Her eyes, the striking colour of forest leaves in the summer, flickered from the high-reaching rooftops to the bushy-haired little witch before her. “Come with me.”</p>
<p>An awestruck Hermione nodded and stepped aside as the woman approached the gate. With a wave of her hand, what had appeared a single, solid gate split down the middle, both halves swinging open in silent welcome. The woman beckoned for Hermione to follow and started towards the house. Entranced, she followed without a word, not even noticing the stark white pebbles which lined the path as they crunched beneath her feet – instead, her attention was captivated by the thrumming buzz of magic all around her.</p>
<p>"So, what brings you here, young lady?"</p>
<p>"I don't really know, to be honest," Hermione replied, her voice soft and oddly breathy. "My magic, I suppose. I just, sort of, wandered here."</p>
<p>“That is the most common way,” said the woman as a thoughtful look crossed her angular face. Brushing it off, she ushered the young girl inside. “I am Mistress Marian, and this is the Fiendfyres’ Pleasure House. I oversee all activities here, on a day-to-day basis.”</p>
<p>"Pleasure House?" Hermione repeated absently, looking around the tidy reception area with its grey marble floor and warm, cocoa walls. "What kind of pleasure house?"</p>
<p>"Come with me, Miss..?" Marian trailed off, awaiting an answer.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Hermione turned her attention back to the older witch. "Granger, Hermione Granger."</p>
<p>“Well, Miss Granger, now I know why you seem so familiar. You are in the very middle of this war, are you not? One of Mr Potter’s friends?”</p>
<p>“I- I am,” she said nervously, suddenly wondering whether it was the right thing to do, giving her name. What would Harry say if she got herself caught by Death Eaters so easily? Her instincts, however, told her that she had no need to fret.</p>
<p>“In that case, I will warn you now – this is a safe place for our members. All politics and perceptions are left at the door, without exception. Many of those whom we entertain are in precarious positions, and many find themselves in the unenviable positions of needing to lie to protect themselves and those that they care about. Do you understand that, Hermione? If you cannot agree, then I must ask you to leave now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mistress,” Hermione replied with a firm nod of her head, not quite sure herself why she used that title. “Although, I’m certain I can’t think of anyone I might know here.”</p>
<p>Marian smiled. "You would be surprised. Now, as for those other questions, come with me, Miss Granger, and you will have your answers."</p>
<p>Hermione nodded and allowed herself to be led down a long corridor, into a luxurious office with walls of a rich, ruby red against panelling so dark as to be almost black, while the carpet was a soft, creamy colour. To the left, in front of a large window that showed a beautiful view of the Scottish Highlands, sat an ancient, leather-topped desk of glistening mahogany. It was practically bare, with the exception of a quill and inkpot. To the right was a stack of filing cabinets, exquisitely made with what looked to be not only the same material, but timber from the same tree.</p>
<p>Hermione sat in the seat that was offered to her – an oversized desk chair of supple black leather – whilst Marian walked around the desk to sit in her own seat, made to match. She promptly began rummaging through drawers for something, and finally pulled a sheaf of parchments out, placing it in front of her.</p>
<p>She slid the package across to Hermione. "This should explain everything, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask me. At the back, there is a contract for you to sign; this facility is kept under a charm somewhat similar to the Fidelius, so the contract protects both the owners and members of Fiendfyres’. If, after reading this, you decide not to sign, a specialist will <em>Obliviate</em> you and you will be sent on your way with a vague memory of reading under a tree on a hill, or some such thing, depending on your regular pastimes and such. Should you choose to stay, arrangements will be made for you to begin your training and we will proceed from there."</p>
<p>Hermione nodded and, in true bookworm fashion, dove into the thick pile. The next hour was spent reading through the minutiae of the agreement, devouring every scrap of information provided by the documents. A comfortable silence filled the room, only punctuated by the occasional question. True to her word, Marian replied with detailed answers that left Hermione’s famous curiosity sated.</p>
<p>"You have a contact at the school?" Hermione asked, turning to the last page and taking the self-inking quill in hand.</p>
<p>"We do," Marian responded, "When your formal training is completed, you may continue to learn with them."</p>
<p>"This contact, are they a teacher, a student, who is it?"</p>
<p>"Miss Granger," Marian leaned forward with a soft smile, her elbows on the desk, hands linked at the fingers – long and slender – upon which her chin rested lightly. "This is information I simply cannot disclose until you sign that contract – even then, I will only inform you when I see fit to do so. I assure you, you will be in safe hands. He is a very protective and caring Master."</p>
<p><em>Well that narrows it down to, oh, about half the school!</em> With her lip between her teeth, Hermione turned her attention back to the parchment before her and scratched her tidy signature on the line. She initialled several times and signed twice more, and then Mistress Marian sealed the agreement with her own signature and a tap of her beech wand. The magic of the contract swirled through the room and the parchment rolled itself up and was sealed with swirled black and red wax bearing what appeared to be some sort of crest. The parchment stored itself away in one of the filing cabinets and Hermione's stomach flip-flopped as the realisation of what she had just done hit her like a bludger to the gut.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Hermione; you are now a member of Fiendfyres'." Marian smiled and leaned over the desk for a hug. When they parted, she rummaged through her drawer and removed two unadorned silver bracelets, made of the finest chain link Hermione had ever seen. "Hold your hands out, darling. These bracelets are goblin-made silver, we use them to identify trainees – gold for Masters who are unattached or looking for a new sub. They are not visible to anyone unless you or I make them so – and there are few in this world capable of seeing through the concealment charms."</p>
<p>Hermione raised her shaking hands and watched as the light chains were slipped around her wrists, shrinking immediately to fit snugly.</p>
<p>Marian smiled, held up her finger and said, "Now, before you go, I will give you your journal." From another drawer, she retrieved a small, but thick book with a green leather cover and handed it to Hermione. "I want you to keep a daily record of your meals and exercise in here and every evening, you will write an entry summarising your day. I have a second journal that shall be kept here, and the two are charmed so that I may read your entries and write messages to you. Every so often, I will set you a task, on which I will expect a report. You are to check the journal each morning when you get up, and in the evening before and after dinner."</p>
<p>Hermione nodded, thumbing through the blank pages of the journal. "Yes Ma'am," She replied.</p>
<p>"Call me 'Mistress' or 'Madam,' Hermione. We must be proper – I am no longer your host, but your Domina," Marian corrected, "Please take the submissive pose – you will find you know the position quite naturally."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mistress," Hermione answered, lowering herself to the ground. She tucked her legs under her body, sitting back on her heels, with her hands resting on her thighs, just above her knees, palms upward and open. Mistress Marian placed her foot between Hermione's thighs, nudging them slightly further apart.</p>
<p>"Well done, Hermione. Now, you had best get back to your friends before they wonder where you've gone. I will find my contact and talk to him about making arrangements for you."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mistress." Hermione nodded and shifted fluidly to her feet. "Thank you for this opportunity."</p>
<p>Mistress Marian waved her away with a smile and she collected her bag and hurried back to Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, Hermione entered Honeydukes. She had just seen the distinctive red hair of Ginny and Ron heading inside, and a mischievous grin spread over her face as she walked up behind the unsuspecting Weasley girl. Her fingers found Ginny’s ticklish sides as she shouted, “Boo!”</p>
<p>Ginny squealed and turned on her assailant with a glare to rival her mother's. "Hermione! You can't just do that to a girl!"</p>
<p>Hermione smirked, trying to control her laughter. "Too late now, Gin. What have you guys been up to?"</p>
<p>"Oh, not much. We just went and had a look at some brooms and Quidditch gear – nothing you'd be interested in."</p>
<p>"Right, well we have fifteen minutes to get our sweets and get back to the meeting point before McGonagall comes head-hunting."</p>
<p>"We can do that," Ron piped in, arms already laden with sweets.</p>
<p>"Get a basket, Ronald!" Hermione scolded. "Honestly, anyone would think you'd never seen sweets!"</p>
<p>"Yes 'Mione." He turned away to find a basket, taking Harry and Ginny with him. Shaking her head, Hermione sighed and set off to collect her own basket of sweets. After paying for their treats and shrinking them down to fit easily in their pockets, the group scurried back to the meeting point just in time to blend in with the crowd and avoid a reprimanding.</p>
<p>Shortly up the path, Hermione heard a whisper-soft crack of apparition. She turned and looked over her shoulder, only to find Snape following behind them, the middle and ring fingers of his right hand in his mouth, his cheeks hollowed. A loose gold chain, as delicate as her own silver bracelets, glinted on his slightly exposed wrist. Nobody else seemed to notice him until he removed his fingers and began chastising stragglers. Unwilling to get caught staring, Hermione turned away, self-consciously pulling her sleeves further over her hands. She knew the bracelets weren't visible, yet Snape's uncanny ability to spot even the most sophisticated of concealment charms left her paranoid. <em>What did Mistress Marian say about bracelets? Gold for...?</em> Shaking away the thought – <em>Snape, a sexual deviant?</em> <em>Yuck!</em> – she continued on up the path to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>When they returned to the castle, Hermione slipped away to her dorm and jumped onto her bed. She drew the drapes around her and warded them heavily. The walk had taken longer than expected and it was almost dinner time, so she flicked to the first page to check for notes. She was uncertain if the note she found was a warning or a demand – <em>‘Do not show your bracelets in Defence Against the Dark Arts classes.’</em></p>
<p>With a sigh, she scrawled a quick, though tidy, acknowledgement before checking the time. Realising she was about to be late for dinner, she hid the journal and made her way through the common room and down the stairs. As she waited for one of the staircases to move back into position, she mulled over the note. Something in Defence class was a threat to either her safety, her secret, or perhaps even both. The only thing that came to mind for either was Professor Snape. With that unsettling thought floating in her mind, she tugged her sleeves down past her wrists and followed a group of Ravenclaws into the Great Hall.</p>
<p>She felt eyes on her from the teachers' table but when she looked up, she saw naught but a few owls tittering on the backs of chairs or resting on perches. The teachers were all conversing or eating, none of them paying much attention to the students, all of whom were involved in their own conversations. Hermione took her seat between Harry and Ron and helped herself to a plateful of the rich-as-ever feast.</p>
<p>She was careful to keep track of everything she ate and scribbled every last detail down in the journal after dinner, while nibbling at a slice of strawberry cheesecake. She added her cake by way of dessert, tucked the journal away in the trunk under her bed, which she kept locked and warded, and then lay back onto the mattress.</p>
<p>What had she gotten herself into? She crossed her arms behind her head and pondered this. What <em>had</em> she gotten herself into? <em>A mess, if my past is anything to go by, </em>she thought gravely. With that notion weighing heavily on her mind, she fell into a light, restless sleep long before the other Gryffindor girls returned.</p>
