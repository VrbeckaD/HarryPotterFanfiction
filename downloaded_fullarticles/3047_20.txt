    <p>New York City was, as always, loud and busy. Automobiles honked on the roads, people yelled on the sidewalks. Buildings rose into the sky, some completed and some in construction. Advertisements were plastered on the sides of brick buildings, earning glances and at times full stops from everyday people walking the streets. Grinning civilians and smiling children made their way through the greatest city in the world. But while everyone tried, not everyone was happy. Some were hiding, whether due to fear, hatred, or laws against them. Some were poor, sick, homeless, or jobless. Some were orphans. Some were widows or widowers. The gleaming city had cold, hard innards that many inhabitants knew quite intimately.</p>
<p>Steve Rogers was not well known by anyone save his best friend and his mother. Not in a positive light, at least. He was quite well known for starting fights over everything from racism to catcalls to slurs used on anyone. While his mother and best friend, Sarah Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes respectively, were proud of him for standing up for his beliefs, they were sick of Steve living in a state of almost continual bruising and blood. He was sick so much, and had so many health ailments, the least he could do was stay out of alleyways for a week at a time.</p>
<p>“Bucky, I’m fine,” Steve said, trying to push James “Bucky” Barnes away from him as he sat at his kitchen table. He didn’t succeed in the slightest, and Bucky calmly continued to clean Steve’s cut lip and scraped cheek with a wet rag. It was Sunday, and Steve had already gotten into a fight, coming out of it more worse for wear than how he’d gone in.</p>
<p>Steve tried to shove Bucky away again, and Bucky frowned, stopping his treatment for a second. “Stevie, you gotta let me clean you up. It’ll take less time if you quit your complainin’, I promise.” From the day they had met, Bucky had taken on the role of protector. Steve got into a fight, Bucky was right there to clean him up and send the bullies running. Steve got sick, Bucky was there spoon feeding him Sarah’s soup and making sure he didn’t cough up a lung. Steve and Bucky were almost inseparable.</p>
<p>With a huge sigh and a pointed look at Bucky, Steve relented and let Bucky continue his careful cleaning. True to Bucky’s word, it was done five minutes after it started, only taking so much time because Bucky had to make sure Steve hadn’t gotten hurt anywhere else. Steve was known to lie when asked ‘does it hurt’, so Bucky had to make doubly sure.<br/>
Once Sarah Rogers (who was a lovely woman and nurse at a hospital, as well as a widow and an Irish immigrant) came home from work, she joined the boys in the kitchen and made dinner. After that, they all sat down to eat, Sarah saying a quick Gaelic prayer before they began. That was one simple day in the life of Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Steve had, once again, gotten sick. He was delirious, coughing like there was no tomorrow and with such a high temperature he was putting a radiator to shame. Bucky had been staying with him for the last three days, keeping the blankets piled on his stick-thin body and the wet rag on his forehead. He had been doing his best to giving Steve water and food in the form of soups as often as he could, but Steve just kept throwing it all up. Bucky was stressed, strained, and running on five hours of sleep over the past three days.</p>
<p>Now, Bucky was walking down the not quite downtown streets of New York City with the gait of a man on a mission. His tired gaze lingered on shop after shop, finally landing on a large and very busy grocery store. To the left of it was a jewelry store, full of watches, necklaces, and other shiny adornments, yet empty and desolate. The Great Depression left no survivors, it seemed. To the right was a barbershop, with the iconic red and white signage out front. The view was familiar to Bucky, as he went to both the barbershop and the grocery store on a semi regular basis, the latter much more regularly.<br/>
Upon entering the familiar grocery store, Bucky went straight for what he was looking for; canned chicken broth, for Steve, and a loaf of Challah for the next day, as it was currently Friday afternoon and Shabbat would start soon. Bucky payed for the two items out of pocket as quickly as he could, leaving the store with a quick, “Shabbat shalom,” even though it wasn’t Shabbat quite yet.</p>
<p>On the way back the way he’d come, as he walked past the jewelry store, Bucky glanced through the dark windows without a thought, looking away within a heartbeat. Then he stopped and looked in again, brow furrowing. There, among the lifeless and glittering objects, was a small creature. It looked like the star-nosed mole Steve had once been so excited about, relaying the information he knew and showing Bucky pictures of the oddest creature he’d ever seen. The mole look-alike was darting in, out, and around the stands and counters, stuffing shiny bit after shiny bit into its odd pouch. Bucky was almost positive star-nosed moles didn’t have pouches. Bucky stood there, examining the curious creature as it stuffed its pouch, when his sleep deprived and realized something else even odder about the creature. Its pouch wasn’t expanding. It just kept going and going, filling but never getting any larger. Bucky rubbed his eyes as the small beast let out a squeak of surprise, most likely having either seen Bucky or having gotten to the end of its endless pouch. When Bucky looked again, the beast was gone. Sighing and grumbling to himself, Bucky spent the rest of the walk back to the the Rogers’ place arguing with himself about what that thing was, and if he was hallucinating. By the time Steve got well enough to listen to him, he had almost forgotten about it, passing it off as the effects of getting nowhere near enough sleep.</p>
<p>He didn’t have another encounter of the sort for years. The first time was simple and small. The next time, not quite so much.</p>
