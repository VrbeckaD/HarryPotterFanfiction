  <strong>Closer to a Home</strong>
</p><p>Disclaimer: I don’t own any of this.</p><p>Timoteo felt a twinge in his Intuition long before a tap at his office window alerted him to the arrival of an owl bearing a thin scroll in its talons. He was as alone as he ever was these days, considering his position; there were several guards patrolling the hallways around his office and tonight he was kept company by Ganauche III, who was snoozing on the couch in the far corner of the room. His children were with their own families (or in Xanxus’ case, in his own room), his other Guardians in their own homes, and his mother (as far as he knew) was probably still awake in her wing of the estate watching tv novellas.</p><p>He quietly stood up and let the owl in –even so, Ganauche’s flames flared sluggishly, questioning Timoteo’s movement even while deeply at rest. He paused in untying the scroll to send back a curl of reassurance so Ganauche would relax, and the younger man stopped stirring the instant Timoteo’s flames reached him. The Vongola Don couldn’t help but let out a little huff of amusement, still not used to the earnest attention from his newest Guardian, the most unexpected Harmonization of any of them by far and so unlike his predecessor.</p><p>The owl – a handsome Barn –settled comfortably on the back of his desk chair while Timoteo went about removing the message from its leg, and it gave a happy, subdued screech when offered a bit of the meat from his forgotten sandwich. He let the bird chitter and gnaw at his fingers for a moment before he turned his attention to the scroll again, unfurling it and already prepared for the worst because of who it concerned.</p><p>
  <em>Timoteo di Vongola</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hello, Uncle, I am awfully sorry for not writing to you sooner. With the war over I’ve been terribly busy with my duties at the school and throughout the wider community, and I feel as though I haven’t had a moment to myself in years-</em>
</p><p>But, the letter from Minerva turned out to be a great relief –Timoteo hadn’t heard from his sole magical godchild in over a year, ever since her community’s war had intensified to the brink of anarchy. He hadn’t actually <em>seen</em> her since his fortieth birthday, which had been nearly sixteen years ago if he was remembering right. Timoteo read through the first few paragraphs of Minerva explaining herself and getting him up to speed with fondness, recalling the formal little girl who would now be nearing forty years herself.</p><p>Thankfully, Minerva seemed not to have lost her wits, but her brief lapses into grim anecdotes worried Timoteo in a way he didn’t often feel these days. It always hit him hard when the children in his life lost their ignorance –more so when there was nothing he could’ve done to prevent it.</p><p>Minerva transitioned into the reason for her letter just as Timoteo began to wonder if she was only going to be telling him that she was alright; detailing briefly how the leader of the opposition had fallen and the sad situation of the Potter boy since then. It made his mind flash to his youngest son, although Harry was perhaps a bit worse off if only due to his age. Barely two years old and already both of his parents were dead, his godfather a traitor, and one uncle murdered while the other was embroiled in undercover work.</p><p>It took a turn into further sadness when Minerva wrote of her visit to the child’s caretakers –she had arrived unexpectedly and on her own, the worry over him no longer something she could ignore, and had walked into a house that was less a home and more a roof under which he was confined.</p><p>Far from taking Harry in as Albus had assured her would happen, the boy’s aunt had all but rejected him from her family; it was true that she provided for him, but children needed more than a room and a meal to thrive. Not even touching on the fact that the boy slept underneath the staircase, or that his uncle refused to so much as touch him, or that most of his day was spent either shut out in the backyard, or in his ‘room’, or in childcare.</p><p>Minerva had been at a loss and near apoplectic with fury, knowing that her employer had wished to believe the best of the Dursley family and she had agreed to allow Harry to be left there. Seeing how he was being treated shook not only her faith in Albus but also in herself for her complacency; now she had nowhere else to turn to for help.</p><p>With the war still so fresh in everyone’s minds and Albus impressing upon her the importance of Harry ‘living apart from his fame’, she couldn’t simply place him with a British magical family. She not only feared that he would face danger from the remnants of the Death Eaters were he to be found, but also that Albus might undermine her and place the boy with someone else he deemed ‘fit’.</p><p>
  <em>I fear that the scant connections I garnered separate from Albus during the war will be of no help to me now, busy as they are with their own problems. Even with Harry’s reputation, not many will have room to spare for yet another war orphan, let alone finding someone I can trust.</em>
</p><p>Timoteo knew his answer before the question was put to ink –he would of course help his goddaughter find a suitable place for the child. Somewhere safe, away from both magical and civilian conflict, a place which would raise him with the proper attention and care a child deserved.</p><p>Ganauche awoke as Timoteo closed the window behind the owl that carried his reply, the slight swell of ambient flames in the room the only indication he wasn’t still unconscious for the first minute or two. He pushed himself up slowly and cracked his shoulders, eyes seeking Timoteo out like a beacon even in his relaxed daze.</p><p>“Something up, Boss?” He asked, aware that Timoteo had been seated when he’d first drifted off. “Did you flare while I was sawing logs?”</p><p>Timoteo snorted and shook his head. “There was just an owl by the window. Now come on, we could both use some sleep in our respective rooms.”</p><p>__</p><p>Timoteo may have promised to secure a place for the child, but doing so on short notice with an organization as vast and varied as his own was not as easy a task as one might like it to be. Far from reviewing every member individually to determine candidates, Timoteo had begun by setting himself some requirements to try and whittle the innumerable possibilities down to those who might suit the boy’s needs best.</p><p>He and Minerva had arranged for her to arrive in two days time and to bring Harry along with her, so that when Timoteo woke up next he could be sure to have ample time to conduct his search as well as see her properly.</p><p>Had he not been fully aware of Xanxus’ lingering insecurities over his place in the family, Timoteo might have been tempted to raise Harry himself. He had a soft spot for children and had always wanted many more than the four he was blessed with. He still felt that way now, even with Xanxus not yet grown and his wife’s memory a cause for as much grief as love.</p><p>But he wanted Xanxus to grow comfortable here while he could and not think he needed to compete with another child –especially since he had finally settled on eighteen as when they would have the ‘adoption talk’ as it were. Eight years was still too short, but by then Xanxus would either be taking on duties as a Capo or perhaps joining the Varia with his talents. Realistically, Timoteo was far too busy for a toddler and likely as not wouldn’t be the best caregiver due to that.</p><p>From there he surmised that putting Harry with a family directly associated with the Vongola in Italy wasn’t the best option either. Timoteo knew that while there were many good people within his Famiglia’s ranks there were also definite disadvantages to being raised so close –not the least of which being that Vongola was targeted by all sides, both criminal and legitimate.</p><p>The Varia had never even been in the running.</p><p>Once that was decided, Timoteo sifted through their allies and affiliates, thinking briefly that knowing the boy’s flame type might make the process go a little smoother. He continued to narrow down those who he could reasonably ask this favour of. He knew the Cavallone and the Giglio Nero often had a few young couples within their ranks, and Ottavio Bovino was well known to take in –and take good care of –orphans who had been abused or similar.</p><p>There came up a few smaller Famiglias he discarded from the list; he wasn’t as familiar with them since they had changed hands from his contemporaries. He completely crossed out setting the child up in any of their sponsored group homes or fosters, being that Minerva had seemed set on trying to find Harry a forever home. He finally rounded out his list with CEDEF and was pleasantly surprised to see that a few people from the group were actively searching for possible adoption agencies according to Iemitsu’s quarterly gossip report.</p><p>As the organization was “both affiliated and not”, the risks that made Timoteo hesitate on a Vongola member for Harry’s guardianship were lessened. CEDEF’s members were so spread out that finding an appropriate area away from conflict was easier, and they were well known for their discretion and information management. The Cervello were... occasionally a concern, but once Iemitsu’s parental leave was over he could use this as an excuse to prod the young man into an internal investigation. Iemitsu was still being trained to take over from Casselli, and he shared many of Timoteo’s same worries, but the fact that his wife had finally carried to term had distracted him and Timoteo hadn’t wanted to ask him to take on too much until his child was maybe five or so years old.</p><p>He paused at a sudden idea and wrote it down, musing that paying his distant relative an earlier than planned visit might be a good idea.</p><p>__</p><p>Minerva approached the front gates of the Vongola’s main estate dressed in a plain grey shirt and long black skirt, carrying a small carpet bag on one shoulder and a snoozing toddler on the opposite hip. She assessed the set up quickly, only vaguely remembering it from when she had last visited, and then walked over to where a pedestrian access had been built into the wall next to the vehicle gates. A nondescript man in a suit stepped out of the booth as she came within earshot and asked her politely if he could help her with anything; Minerva primly handed him the card her godfather had sent along with his reply, and told him who she was and why she was here.</p><p>The guard’s eyes widened in surprise as he read the card –he soon showed Minerva to a nearby seat and took the card back with him into the booth. She heard the crackle of a radio and a few muffled sentences in Italian, and within a few minutes he was back with an equally plain looking young woman in tow.</p><p>“Signora, my colleague will escort you to the main house. Do have a good stay.” He said, and handed her the card back.</p><p>“Pleased to meet you, Ms. McGonagall.” The young woman said in accented English, politely shaking her hand. “Do you need any assistance with your bag?”</p><p>“Thank you, but I’m quite alright<em>.</em>” Minerva replied in equally accented Italian, but it was obviously appreciated by the guard. They passed through the gates and made their way through the gardens; still grandiose even after so many years. Minerva inspected the guard out of the corner of her eye –she couldn’t have been more than a few years older than her seventh years, but she certainly held herself professionally, perhaps even moreso than the students from old, well mannered families.</p><p>The young woman smiled slightly. “He’s very cute, how old is he?”</p><p><em>“</em>Two, next month<em>.” </em>Minerva sorely wished that he could have spent more time with his parents, as she’d wished so many times over the last few days. “Do you have any children, Miss?”</p><p>The guard laughed and shook her head. “No, I’m not even out of college yet. I won’t be having any for another few years still.<em>” </em>Minerva nodded in understanding, and paused while the guard moved forward to hold open one of the large doors for her.</p><p>Inside was just as impressive as Minerva remembered; high ceilings and intricately carved wood, a long hall off to one side lined with the formal oil paintings of each of the nine Vongola Dons thus far. Minerva turned around and thanked the young woman for escorting her, but instead of responding the guard straightened even more at the sight of something further into the entrance hall.</p><p>“Minerva!” She turned back to see her godfather coming down the stairs, slightly slower and with more grey in his hair but just the same smile as when they had last seen each other. Beside him was a young boy maybe about eleven with dark hair, red eyes and a suspicious expression on his face as he inspected her. “My darling girl, come let me have a look at you after so long!”</p><p>Minerva smiled, instantly put at ease. They met in the middle of the room, Timoteo briefly thanking and dismissing the guard before pulling Minerva into an embrace, careful not to jostle her young passenger.</p><p>“Minerva, this is my youngest son, Xanxus.” Timoteo introduced, smiling proudly when the boy nodded and extended a hand so they could shake. “Xanxus, this is Minerva McGonagall. She is my eldest godchild, and she lives in the United Kingdom.”</p><p>Something in Xanxus’ expression shifted at that, and though he looked at Harry curiously he didn’t ask anything about why she was visiting or why he had never seen her before. Instead he murmured a goodbye to his father and nodded at Minerva, and then went out into the gardens without another word.</p><p>“He’s shy<em>.” </em>Timoteo told her fondly<em>. “</em>Now, we can talk in my sitting room. The entranceway isn’t the best place<em>...</em>”</p><p>Minerva followed her godfather up the main staircase, recognizing some things as he led her down a quiet hallway, away from the distant echoes of chatter coming from the opposite end. Soon after they reached a white wooden door that Minerva remembered from one of the first times she had ever visited, and the inside proved not to have changed much. Timoteo motioned for her to sit while he grabbed a tray of tea from a table just inside the door, and he poured cups for the both of them before they began to really talk.</p><p>“I <em>was </em>worried during your long silence, but I’m so relieved you’re safe<em>.</em>” He said, passing her the steaming cup once she had adjusted Harry enough that both her hands were free. “I had heard of the war’s end from my own people, but it was harder to find anything on you<em>.</em>”</p><p>“I’m sorry. The war was... very taxing.” Minerva sighed, smoothing Harry’s hair down. “I was still needed even once the fighting had stopped<em>.”</em></p><p>“There’s no need for apologies. I understand.”</p><p>Minerva sniffed slightly; she stared down at the sleeping boy and closed her eyes, overwhelmed by the horrible ‘what if’s that may have come to pass had she not taken Harry from there. “Albus really believed that Petunia and Vernon would care for Harry, if out of nothing else than respect for dear Lily. I never thought so highly of them... but I still didn’t try harder to change his mind...”</p><p>“I don’t think I can ever thank you enough for this, Uncle. I can’t imagine I would be nearly so calm if I didn’t have you to turn to.” Minerva shook her head. “Albus... he’s a good man, but he has his failings. If I hadn’t thought to check in on them, Harry might –I don’t even want to guess on how he would’ve turned out. I’m so worried that I won’t be able to do anything if, somehow, Harry gets sent back there. I’m losing sleep it worries me so<em>.</em>”</p><p>“<em>We </em>all make decisions that, in hindsight, were terrible. But we can also make good ones. His aunt is no longer an issue, and will never be if I have any say in it. Harry will be all the better for it.” Minerva nodded in agreement. “You are my goddaughter, Minerva. I would help you commit murder if you asked, and so I will protect the ones you hold dear with just as much resolve.” Timoteo let the statement hang in the air as he refilled his cup, sure that she knew he was being serious. “I’ve taken the liberty of looking into a few people I think would be suitable, those who would treat Harry as their own son without thinking. We can go over the details tomorrow, once you’ve had a good rest. Although, is there anything you would like to see in potential candidates?”</p><p>Minerva took a minute to think that over. “I’d like them not to be in or near the United Kingdom.” She began, and Timoteo mentally took note. “Financially stable, who can spend time with him, with no more than... three or four other children? I don’t mind if they’re... involved in your business, Uncle, but please not in a dangerous part of the world.”</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>“And you haven’t spoken with any of them yet?”</p><p>“No, I wanted to wait. I did tentatively plan out a few that I was fairly sure would work out, but nothing was officially arranged. You have a bit of time off now that it’s July, don’t you?”</p><p>“Oh, yes. You wouldn’t mind if I stayed a few weeks?” Minerva asked.</p><p>“I wish you could stay longer!”</p><p>__</p><p>Minerva appeared in the dining room at half past noon the next day, Harry toddling around several steps in front of her and accompanied by one of the kitchen staff, having uncharacteristically slept in over lack of sleep and jet lag. Timoteo rose out of his seat to greet her, showing her the vacant seat and high chair to his right, and was about to re-introduce her to everyone at the table when his mother interrupted him.</p><p>“Minerva, dear, you’ve grown into such a fine woman.” Daniela smiled, curiously inspecting Harry. “Were you married while out of touch? I’m afraid I don’t hear much about the wider family these days.”</p><p>Minerva’s face fell slightly, but she smiled anyhow. “I was, but I’m afraid Elphinstone died last year. Harry is my late students’ child, my ward for the time being.”</p><p>“Oh, I, I’m so sorry, Minerva.” Daniela said, Timoteo following suite; Minerva thanked them.</p><p>“I’ve been coming to terms with it. We had three years together, which is more than some people get.” Minerva looked down the table. “...Massimo and Federico, am I right? You were only children when I was here last.”</p><p>“You’ve got a good memory.” Massimo said, stirring his coffee. “I’m afraid I almost didn’t recall who you were, you spent most of that visit talking with Enrico.”</p><p>“Was he not able to come ‘round today?”</p><p>There was a beat of silence before Timoteo sighed heavily. “You wouldn’t have heard due to the timing, but Enrico died two years ago.” Minerva sucked in a startled breath. “So far as we can tell, it was a stray shot in a firefight. There was no way to prevent it.”</p><p>“These last few years have been difficult all around.” Federico said. “But surely they’ll get better, soon. Why, Massimo is going to be married!”</p><p>“Fede, don’t go saying that before I even propose.” Massimo murmured. “You’ll jinx it.”</p><p>“Minerva, did you get a chance to look through those papers I left by your door?” Timoteo asked as his sons devolved into a quiet argument. “Were there any left at all?”</p><p>“Only four, I’m afraid. For Harry I won’t be lax.” The atmosphere lightened a little more as she tried to feed Harry and talk at the same time. “I do think meeting them beforehand would be best. There was something about... flame compatibility?”</p><p>“Mm, sometimes adoption in our circles is a little more complicated than simply vetting their personal situation. If a child has particularly ‘Hard’ flames, they may have a difficult time accepting someone new as a guardian. It doesn’t always turn out well if these things aren’t taken into account.”</p><p>“I suppose it’s better to err on the side of caution.”</p><p>There was quiet again for a few minutes as everyone ate or spoke in low tones, Harry making the most noise among them. Massimo was the first to leave, heading out for a meeting, Federico not long after when he received an unexpected call. When Daniela left for a Doctor’s appointment and it was only four left sitting, Xanxus spoke up hesitantly.</p><p>“F-Father, there’s something weird about the brat.” He wrinkled his nose in distaste and glared at Harry, who was preoccupied with smearing scrambled eggs all over his plate. “It makes my skin crawl.”</p><p>“What does, Xanxus? Something about his flames, maybe?” Timoteo looked closely at the toddler and noticed for the first time a faint shimmer around his hairline, transparent grey and curling closely to his forehead. It wasn’t surprising that Xanxus had cottoned on to it before anyone else –he was already a prodigy in flame use and the way the tendrils crept out to try and inspect them must have been off putting.</p><p>“What is it?” Minerva asked, trying to see what had her godfather frowning at her charge.</p><p>“I’m unsure. Would you be up to taking Harry to have a check up today? Whatever this is might not even be a problem, but it would be a good idea even so.” Timoteo drew back from where he’d been looking closely at the strange occurrence.</p><p>“I think that <em>is </em>a good idea. I noticed that he’s been sleeping an awful lot, even for a babe.”</p><p>__</p><p>Once Xanxus was assured that he wouldn’t have to hold or keep an eye on Harry, he agreed to accompany them to the medical wing, where an appointment had been swiftly arranged for after lunch. The Vongola’s head physician was currently on loan to the Armoniche Ospedale for several weeks, but one of her direct subordinates was well above any standard doctor and was more than happy to clear his busy schedule for them.</p><p>“Speaking physically, he is going to need glasses when he’s older. He has a broken finger that healed the wrong way, but luckily that can be fixed. He’s approaching malnourishment and hasn’t been getting enough sun or exercise.” Dr. Dhanda outlined after the full exam he had insisted upon. “I’d recommend that once he’s settled you find him a primary doctor to oversee his recovery instead of getting one thing or the other treated at a time.”</p><p>“As for his Flames,” Dr. Dhanda went on. “He’s quite clearly a Rain, and already Active besides. But anything more I could say... well, that scar needs to be taken care of as soon as possible. I can’t get a read on Flame Intensity, Secondary’s, not much of anything beyond his Element, really.”</p><p>The grey wisp curled jerkily over Harry’s scar, as if it knew it was being talked about.</p><p>“It’s a combination of Flame remnants and magic. I’ve seen it happen before, but as far as I can tell this is from the same individual, which <em>should</em> be impossible. Regardless, I’m going to call Dr. Bachelette and schedule an appointment for this tomorrow at the Armoniche –if that’s amenable, Don Vongola?” Dr. Dhanda began filling out a note as soon as Timoteo nodded in agreement. “Lastly, he’s going through some sort of Flame Exhaustion that doesn’t involve those Rain Flames – so I think he probably has a Secondary that’s responding to the foreign infection. Dr. Bachelette will have the Rain Ward supervisor take a look at him tomorrow as well.”</p><p>“Thank you Harjit, is there anything else?” Timoteo asked, taking the slip of paper.</p><p>“Once he gets one, just have his primary physician give Dr. Bachelette and I a call, so we can get them up to speed. And don’t miss this appointment.” The doctor said, reaching into the fridge under his desk and handing Minerva a small package of skinless apple slices. “Here, I’m sure he’ll like these after all my poking and prodding.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Minerva hoisted Harry back up on her hip and followed her Uncle out the door, Xanxus bringing up the rear and still giving Harry the side eye.</p><p>“Well, now we have a plan of action.” Timoteo commented mildly. “Xanxus, did you want to stay with us? I’m afraid we’re not going to be doing much that’s interesting –talking about adoptive families might get a little tedious.”</p><p>Xanxus visibly thought about it, even glancing out the window at the estate’s expansive gardens that Minerva suspected he spent a lot of his free time in. “I’ll tag along.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s go sit outside, then. There’s a garden near here that has a low wall ‘round it, so Harry can explore without wandering off.”</p><p>When they set themselves up in the garden with coffee and a bit of food for Harry and Xanxus to eat if they wanted, Minerva let the toddler go and walk around, keeping an eye on him regardless of the fact that the grass was maybe ten paces at any length.</p><p>“I looked through the suggestions you gave me, Uncle, and only found the De Palmas, the Sawadas, the Müllers, and the Martinellis to be acceptable. Why don’t you tell me a bit about them?”</p><p>“Helen and Pablo de Palma are related tangentially to the leader of the Nuevo based out of New Orleans –enough so to be on the radar and afforded protection, but they won’t be in line for succession or any of that. They have one child, and when I spoke with them a few months ago while visiting the city they were open about wanting more children in the future.” Timoteo paused to wave a bee out of his face. “Iemitsu is the vice head of CEDEF, an organization which oversees the Vongola from an outside perspective, and his wife Nana is pregnant with their first child. Out of any of these families, Japan is perhaps as far away from the U.K. as you can get. The Müllers, Gerald and Doyle, have been looking to adopt or surrogate as recently as six months ago; Doyle is one of CEDEF’s foreign branch supervisors and I can’t think of a single bad thing to tell you about him. Finally, Marco and Viola Martinelli are involved with one of our lesser allies, the Uccello, near Venice. They have two children and teach part time at a local La Scuola branch, and were good friends with Enrico before he died.”</p><p>“Why not someone from the Cavallone? They’re a big, safe Famiglia, close to here.” Xanxus injected.</p><p>“I might’ve suggested them, but Don Cavallone is experiencing a bit of unrest due to his illness right now. Asking him to place a child would add to his workload.” Xanxus nodded, accepting the answer. “Now, Minerva, I haven’t talked to any of them yet, but I can easily call them up within the next few days, maybe arrange a visit with each next week so you can meet them and Harry can be recovered enough to travel. How does that sound?”</p><p>“Reasonable, Uncle.” Minerva said with a tired smile, eyes on Harry still as he tripped over a knot in the grass and got up without missing a beat.</p><p>The visit to the Armoniche Ospedale the next day ultimately turned out to be less involved than anyone was expecting. Dr. Bachelette; the Vongola’s head physician, and Dr. Amoire; the head of the Rain Ward, met with Minerva, Harry and Ganauche at noon and they spent a good amount of time simply talking, trying to ascertain how the scar had appeared in the first place. Minerva knew a lot of the story by now, but the hows and whys evaded her even on her best days.</p><p>In the end they decided to go with their usual method of treatment for such an affliction; it was rare, yes, but not so rare that they had never encountered it themselves or had no idea what to do with it. The past decade was full of Flame advancements in every field, medicine no exception –a lot to do with the fact that the Hospital staff very rarely had patients arrive in great numbers, and so they filled their time with research and innovation.</p><p>Harry did have to be put under general anaesthesia for the procedure, where Dr. Bachelette, three other Sun users from the Ward staff, and the supervisor of the Storm Ward simultaneously destroyed the infection from inside the wound and then healed it in increments, making sure to expel the residual magic at the same time. Minerva was allowed to watch with Ganauche from the viewing room, and while it scared her like nothing else to see Harry lying on a table like that, it was also fascinating as well. If she could have, she might’ve introduced Poppy to a few of the Flame doctors by now; the Mediwitch didn’t exactly trust non-magical methods, but she was highly interested in hearing about them.</p><p>When Dr. Bachelette met them outside the door while Harry was being moved over to a bed in the Lightning Ward and informed her that the operation had been a complete success, she was so relieved that she had needed to sit down.</p><p>__</p><p>When Minerva first wrote her godfather she was tired, drained and desperate. A long and gruelling war had given way to a shaky sort of peace, everyone involved in the fighting left to pick up the pieces of their broken families, their shattered lives. Her attention had been split between arranging Elphinstone’s funeral, reopening the school, flushing out the Ministry, and the testimonies she was expected to give concerning more than a dozen incidents or arrests.</p><p>More than half a year had passed when she finally found the time to go and check on Harry herself, when Albus was occupied with his new position as Supreme Mugwump and didn’t have the time to be at the school most days. The man was brilliant, had almost defeated Voldemort a number of times before that tragic Halloween night; but after all she had been through and lost, she didn’t need his opinion, or his permission, and so she hadn’t told him where she was going. She knew deflection –or rather, hope without proof –well, and she knew she wouldn’t rest easy until she saw that Harry was being treated right with her own eyes.</p><p>Now that she and Harry were both in Italy, visiting Doctors about his scar and couples about his future, Minerva wasn’t sure she would ever be able to trust the Headmaster’s word again.</p><p>“Minerva, love, you cannot blame yourself for the decisions of others.” Her godfather reminded her firmly after she had, in a vulnerable moment, told him of feeling guilty for not going to the Dursley’s sooner. Logically she knew he was right, but it was hard to think that way when Harry still cried if she shut off the lights abruptly or made too sudden a hand movement. “Don’t let ‘what ifs’ preoccupy you. Only worry about what’s happening right now. You trust me, don’t you?”</p><p>“I do, Uncle. I really do.” Minerva sighed and let herself relax a bit more. “This is all happening a bit fast, I suppose. Ten days ago I was reviewing student lists.”</p><p>“In Harry’s case, swift is probably best.” Timoteo said gently. “Fast treatment will bring fast recovery, and I have complete confidence that Harry will grow up in a home that will love him and treat him as their own cherished son.”</p><p>“Why is it again you think a...  Harmonized parent would be better?” Minerva asked –three of the four couples they were going to visit had one of the parents involved in a Harmony. “Massimo tried to explain, but he isn’t the best at it I’m sorry to say.”</p><p>Timoteo laughed, shaking his head in amusement. “He isn’t, you’re right. But that’s what happens when things come naturally to you.” He grew a little more serious. “Harry is very delicate at the moment. His Rain Flames are inherently stabilizing, but Lightning Flames can be unpredictable at the best of times, let alone when they’re recovering from extensive Exhaustion. A parent involved in a Harmony will have access to a bit of... flame runoff, and the stability that comes with that will ensure that Harry has a bit of an easier time keeping balanced. It isn’t entirely necessary, nor does it always work –take the Bovino for example.”</p><p>“An extra bit of help, maybe.”</p><p>“Yes. It’s worth taking into account, at any rate.”</p><p>The way he said it –that made it sound like a reason to consider someone rather than a deciding factor for choosing them –was what really made her feel better. It wasn’t the same as Albus’ argument for Harry going to his Aunt’s for the protections the Blood Ward would offer, and that he took the time to explain it to her was appreciated as well.</p><p>When Harry was given the go ahead by both the Rain and Lightning Ward directors a week after his surgery, they flew to New Orleans to meet the De Palmas almost immediately. That evening Timoteo would go and see the Nuevo leadership while Minerva and Harry went to bed early, but in the morning she, Harry and her godfather met the young couple and their two year old daughter Maria at a park in one of New Orleans’ older suburbs. They spent a pleasant few hours talking and watching the children before parting ways, promising to give Helen and Pablo an update after the other meetings went through.</p><p>Minerva was happy enough with it as a start, and it put her in a better frame of mind for the rest of the visits that were to come. Pablo had a stable, well paying job with a local restaurant, and Helen was a stay at home mother. As Timoteo had said, their children wouldn’t be in line for any sort of succession, but Helen had still picked up three Guardians during her time at The School –later explained that she had meant the local ‘mafia school’ like the British Isles’ An Scoil –and they had stuck close ever since. Timoteo mentioned it was a plus that both Helen and Maria were Rain users like Harry, even if he hadn’t been noticeably receptive to either of them.</p><p>“Reacting well at the first meeting sometimes means a good match, but it’s by no means set in stone.” Timoteo replied evenly when she pressed. “Harry has been through a lot. He may just be slow to bond.”</p><p>They met the Müllers two days later, and although Harry actually crawled over to Gerald and appeared content, he didn’t like the four year old they had adopted one bit. Doyle had taken the CEDEF position to remove himself from the running for the succession of his father’s small family –he was the youngest out of seven children, and joked that the two Guardians he had were the only people who agreed with him that he wouldn’t have been a good Boss. Gerald worked in town as a web designer and internet technician, and Minerva liked them well enough, but the fact that Harry didn’t get along with their son like he had with the De Palma girl was a major drawback.</p><p>Their journey to Japan was longer than the average traveller might experience, Timoteo arranging stopovers in Greece, Thailand and South Korea –ostensibly to break up a terribly long plane ride, but in the end he always had some sort of business to attend to for at least a couple of hours each stop. During the trip, he filled her in on the Vongola’s relationship with Japan, the couple they were headed to meet and where they would be off to after this. It was a relief to finally arrive, and even more so to go and meet the couple that Timoteo had told her so much about on the plane ride over.</p><p>When Sawada Iemitsu opened the door to his home to let them in, Minerva was struck by just how much he looked like a blond, tanned James Potter. That impression grew as he cheerfully led them inside, introduced Nana –his heavily pregnant wife –with hearts in his eyes, and managed to draw a shy little wave from Harry within a few minutes.</p><p>They all sat down to talk in the living room, content to let Harry toddle around exploring as they made conversation. Despite the good start, Harry showed no more inclination to approach the Sawadas after that, which they were visibly disappointed about; they brightened somewhat when Minerva told them about Harry’s shy temperament and that he was still convalescing.</p><p>“It’s probably better he do things how he wants.” Iemitsu smiled easily, one hand cradling Nana’s. “With <em>Cieli</em>, it’s very often a complete yes or a hard <em>no. </em>There’s no sense pushing.”</p><p>“Quite.” Minerva agreed, half an eye on Harry as he lifted up a couch cushion next to the coffee table.</p><p>“He’s a very steady walker.” Nana observed, something about her quiet cadence drawing the room’s attention. “My mother told me I could barely crawl until I was three.”</p><p>“My Federico was the same.” Timoteo laughed. “Minerva barely spoke until she was four or five.”</p><p>“Uncle, how dare you tell them that.”</p><p>The atmosphere was light and easy, and even though part of her wanted to be more critical, Minerva found herself taking a shine to the young couple already. This could be a good fit for Harry, she thought absently, smiling when the toddler tried to climb up next to Iemitsu and, upon it proving too difficult a task, allowed the man to lift him up and onto the couch.</p><p>They stared at one another for a few seconds before Harry disappeared with a quiet ‘pop’.</p><p>Nana fainted.</p><p>“You never said he was a <em>magical</em> baby.” Iemitsu sighed, like this had happened to him before.</p><p>“He –He apparated out of-” Minerva stopped in disbelief. Babies weren’t supposed to be able to <em>do that</em>. “He apparated at <em>two years old</em>.”</p><p>“Ganauche is already putting together a search party. Harry’s flames being so young and without trained Sensors, it will take a little longer than usual.” Timoteo explained, snapping his phone shut, mostly to give Minerva something to focus on.</p><p>“That was a ‘no’ if I’ve ever seen one.” Iemitsu mumbled, making sure Nana was more comfortable positioned on the couch. “I thought he was Flame Active?”</p><p>“Sorry, Iemitsu. That was going to be the second meeting.” Timoteo rubbed his forehead. “And it’s difficult to quantify, but when young children possess both, sometimes they don’t lean one way or another until as late as seven.”</p><p>“Oh.” Minerva’s mind seemed to have maxed out on worry and gone back around to latch onto the fact that she would have to arrange to see Harry before he went either way, to tell him the full options on what he was going to decide on. Well, if he ended up raised Flame-oriented anyway.</p><p>“Don’t worry too terribly, Minerva.” Timoteo soothed, as if he realized that she was one thought away from breaking into a full blown panic. “Everyone is already out there looking. I will be as well once I’m sure you’re alright.”</p><p>“I’m... I will be when we find him. Let’s go!”</p><p>__</p><p>It was close to nine at night when Timoteo’s phone finally rang and Ganauche relayed that he needed them to meet him and Nougat a few kilometres over from where they had stopped.</p><p>“His tone was odd.” Timoteo mentioned as they hailed a cab. “But not worrisome. It was like he wasn’t sure whether to huff or laugh.”</p><p>“That’s good.” Minerva wasn’t about to entertain any scenario that could be bad and lead to that sort of description.</p><p>“Ganauche would’ve said if something was wrong.” Her godfather continued, trying to assure her. When the cab pulled up to the small group of gathered Vongola members, Timoteo settled the fare and they both hurried over.</p><p>“Well, <em>where is he?</em>” Minerva demanded, nerves shot and making her feeling like a caged animal. Ganauche did indeed have an odd expression on his face to match his tone, as Timoteo had said; partly as if he was holding in a laugh, but also like he was frustrated and impatient.</p><p>“That’s the rub. Boss, we’re pretty sure the tyke’s in <em>there</em>.” Nougat said, and jerked his thumb at a gate set into a low wall a few metres down the street. Minerva didn’t understand what the problem was, until Nougat followed up with, “That’s the Momokyou-kai compound. Yakuza.”</p><p>“Their reputation?” Timoteo asked, not missing a beat.</p><p>“In their third generation, well respected if small for the area.” Nougat rattled off. “Pretty standard laundry list. The current head doesn’t like his people dealing to anyone under twenty, and no first timers, so they’ve made allies with about who you’d expect. The Shuei, Kuroda, Gotouda. Bit of a feud going with the Tomaso.”</p><p>“Hm. Any bad press?” Nougat gave his boss a <em>look</em>.</p><p>“Besides being criminals? The rumours they’re courting the Triad are <em>just</em> rumours from what we can tell. They recruit a lot of women –and not for the sex trade considering the quotes we’ve got from their second generation head. No sex trafficking going on at all, thank <em>fuck.</em>”</p><p>“Then I see no reason not to knock on the door.” Timoteo said, and with that he linked his arm with Minerva’s and headed straight over to the gate –several put-upon sighs sounding off in his wake. A rather unique looking young man –carrot coloured hair and a grey mechanic’s suit –with a scar down one cheek answered them, and politely asked what he could help them with.</p><p>“If you could please let someone know that a Vongola representative has arrived, calling with a business prospect, we would greatly appreciate it.”</p><p>They were shown in and led to something of a sitting room, where the subordinate left so he could go and fetch whoever was available.</p><p>“Uncle, I’m a tad nervous.” Minerva admitted. She had lived through a war and then some, but that had been in Britain, with an enemy she knew, laws she could ignore, and Harry safe with his parents. This –This was a side of her godfather she was keenly aware of, but had never been so suddenly confronted with.</p><p>“My dear, all will be well, I promise.” Was all he could say before the door opened again.</p><p>Another young man came in, this time accompanied by a woman of roughly his same age. He was rather short but looked as sharp as a knife, while his companion was tall and imposing, with wide shoulders and scarred knuckles. The man stopped suddenly, his eyes going wide at the sight of her godfather, and Minerva marvelled that he could inspire such a reaction so far from Italy.</p><p>“<em>Vongola-sama, </em>h-how may I –be of service?” He asked in halting English, the both of them bowing formally.</p><p>“Please, Japanese is fine, I am in your home. I apologize for arriving without prior warning, and so late.”</p><p>“Think nothing of it.” The woman assured him. “But, could we see some identification?”</p><p>“Of course.” Timoteo raised his cane and lit both the end and the ring on his finger with Sky Flames for a few short seconds, then dissipated them so the woman could inspect the signet ring that Minerva knew every Don before him had worn as well.</p><p>“Thank you, Vongola-sama.” The man intoned, bowing again. “I am Wakatoshi, and this is my second, Kanata. What sort of business have you travelled to Japan for?”</p><p>“It is less business and more of a personal matter.” Timoteo began, keeping a hand on Minerva’s forearm. “My godchild, Minerva, recently came into the custody of a young boy.” Timoteo paused almost imperceptibly, but neither Wakatoshi nor Kanata reacted. “We were visiting a distant cousin of mine when the lad’s accidental magic acted up, and he vanished. We have been looking for him for most of the afternoon.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any children around myself.” Wakatoshi said it so casually that Minerva was almost fully inclined to believe him, if not for Nougat’s word to the contrary. “But, I have been away all day. Would you mind terribly if I went to ask our Kumichō?”</p><p>“By all means. The only urgency is in assuring Harry’s safety.”</p><p>When they were alone, Minerva sighed and relaxed out of her tenseness.</p><p>“Not a bad liar, that one. A liar all the same, though.” Timoteo smiled at her blunt assessment. “I didn’t expect them to be so polite.”</p><p>“Well, not every criminal is a scoundrel.” He joked. “Those two are young, which would normally indicate rude or thoughtless, but it’s likely that they have a higher position with how they handled us. That they didn’t simply deny everything and kick us out means that they know a little more than they’re letting on.”</p><p>“I do think Nougat was on the mark.” Minerva took a steadying breath. “Merlin, this morning I thought we would be back in the hotel by now, looking over the Martinellis, not organizing a <em>search party</em>.”</p><p>“Harry doesn’t seem to make things easy, does he?”</p><p>The door slid open quietly, breaking them out of conversation for the appearance of a man, maybe in his late twenties. He had dark, closely cut hair and the edges of a vibrant tattoo peeking out at his collarbone and wrist, and a significant portion of his nose was missing. He was wearing a grey, formal hakama with blueembroidery, and despite the fact that he had the leader of the most powerful mafia family in the world standing in his sitting room, he appeared as unruffled as if Timoteo were a close friend come for a chat.</p><p>“Don Vongola, a pleasure to have you in my home.” He greeted, also bowing formally. “I am Momoda Sakurai, third Oyabun of the Momokyou-kai. Wakatoshi informs me you are asking after a lost child.”</p><p>“Indeed I am. My goddaughter’s ward, in fact.” Timoteo and Minerva both shook Sakurai’s hand, Minerva introducing herself cordially. “We’ve been absolutely beside ourselves with worry since he vanished.”</p><p>“I can imagine.” Sakurai agreed heavily.</p><p>“Please, we’re sorry to trouble you so late.” Minerva started, glad her godfather didn’t interrupt. “But Harry’s been missing for hours now. I just want him safe, he’s all I have left of his parents. If there’s anything you can tell us, anything at all...”</p><p>Sakurai stared at her for a long minute before he nodded and briefly went back to the hall door, saying something to whoever was waiting on the other side. It was only a moment later that a woman entered the room carrying an obviously drowsy Harry, who smiled and reached out for Minerva once he saw her, making noise all the while.</p><p>“Anty!” He managed in his toddler gurgle, and the woman brought him over, tried to pass him away –but once he patted Minerva’s cheek he decided he wanted to remain where he was for the time being, and they acquiesced.</p><p>“My wife, Sunako.” Sakurai introduced.</p><p>“He’s been just –wonderful. He’s wonderful.” Sunako said, and her voice hitched slightly when Harry curled closer into her chest. “We found him in the back gardens at around one. Poor thing was in tears.”</p><p>“Our condolences. He is an orphan?” Sakurai asked, coming up beside his wife to brace an arm around her waist.</p><p>“Lily and James. They were killed in October.” Minerva told them, and it still hurt. “He wasn’t in a good place before I took custody a few weeks ago.”</p><p>“We... it was a pleasure to take care of him today, even under the circumstances.” Sakurai said, and Sunako nodded in agreement.</p><p>“I –I think he’ll go now.” Sunako murmured –Harry had fallen asleep in her arms. She so carefully helped Minerva take him that Harry barely stirred at all.</p><p>“Don Vongola, please don’t hesitate to call if ever you’re in the area. The Momokyou-kai would be glad to offer our aid.” They shook hands once more, and then Sakurai and Sunako showed them to the front door. “Safe travels.”</p><p>“Thank you, and I extend the offer in return. I’m sure we’ll meet again, Kumichou.”</p><p>“Thank you, so much.” Minerva said emphatically, and Sunako smiled delicately.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>They exited the compound and walked back to where Ganauche and Nougat were waiting with a car to take them back to the hotel; on the way, Timoteo called Iemitsu to fill him in on what had happened.</p><p>The discussion didn’t begin until after Minerva had put Harry down to sleep.</p><p>“Why were they acting so odd? It wasn’t simply that I am the Vongola Don.” Timoteo addressed his Guardians, a serious look in his eye. “Although on the glance they acted normally, if stiffly, they were both reluctant to see Harry go, and Sunako appeared particularly distraught Flame-wise after they had closed the door behind us...”</p><p>“Well, nothing’s been happy for the Momoda as of late.” Ganauche said grimly. “At Sakurai Momoda’s succession eight years ago, they were plagued with internal disputes, assassination attempts by the Tomaso, and worries over Sunako Momoda’s health. They had a calm period for a few years, and then they had a child a year ago, Kiku...” Nougat sighed from behind them all. “The boy died six months back from an undiagnosed birth defect. Soon after, Sakurai Momoda lost his Mist to a freak car accident and his father succumbed to stomach cancer following years of chemo. The organization has been doing well, but the family has been wracked with grief.”</p><p>“Those poor people.” Minerva couldn’t help but say, a pit of sympathy opening up in her chest.</p><p>“What’re you thinking, boss?”</p><p>“Uncle?”</p><p>“Minerva, dear, what would you think if I asked you to consider the Momoda for Harry?” He asked calmly, and Minerva straightened up, meeting his gaze head on in all seriousness. “A young couple with no children –horrible circumstance aside –and the husband with a nearly full complement of Guardians. They will be able to support him, are as far removed from both the wider Mafia community and British Magical society as one can ask; Iemitsu and Nana live nearby.”</p><p>“Uncle, how could we ask this of them? They’re grieving –we barely know them at all.”</p><p>“Harry seemed perfectly content –a child’s insight can go a long way, though it may not always ring true.” Timoteo pointed out; he decided to withhold the fact for now that his Intuition had been prodding him back there ever since they had left, certain that the Momoda would at least be some part of this situation they had to resolve. “And as I’ve said, this isn’t a deciding factor, but Sakurai is solely a Rain and Sunako has a Lightning Secondary.”</p><p>Minerva took a few minutes to think on it. Certainly there were many aspects of the couple that, had they been on the official docket, she would likely have already scheduled a second meeting. No offense meant to the Müllers or the De Palmas, but neither had struck her as an exemplary match for her little ward –good enough, surely, but with this particular child good enough just wouldn’t cut it. Sakurai and Sunako were... a better fit, she had to admit, not the least bit because of how they had cared for Harry during his unexpected disappearance.</p><p>“How stable a situation are they in? Won’t he be in a bad way with a broken Guardian bond, let alone all else?”</p><p>Timoteo glanced at Nougat. “Flame wise, Sakurai is holding up well for having recently lost a child and Guardian. He is the lead in a Skyless Harmony –that is, using the six non-Sky Flame variants he has created a Bond which is as strong as a traditional one, with his Rain Flame as the central aspect. Some think it is a lesser Harmony, but it actually shows that he has gained their trust enough for them to <em>choose</em> to tie themselves both to him as well as each other; he would have to be very mentally strong for this. And though Sunako was likely hit harder for their child’s loss, for she has only one Guardian to support her Flames, I did not get the impression that she was buried in her grief. She may indeed be stronger than her husband in this.”</p><p>“Aye.” Nougat agreed. “Not a whiff of Discordance in the whole place –and I’d be able to tell. Losing a kid’s another matter. As for the Momokyou-kai as a whole, it’s well entrenched in both legitimate and other business ventures, it’s allies don’t chatter about it which means they wanna keep it safe and quiet, and the Tomaso feud has calmed a <em>little bit.</em> Evidently even those weirdos can back off when a baby’s died, their own heir’s age notwithstanding.”</p><p>“And,” Minerva hated to give voice to it, but it had been swirling around her brain the further away she got from Britain. “Albus has no political sway here, no power whatsoever.”</p><p>“Why not give it thought for a night or two? There is no rush. We can play tourists for tomorrow, Minerva.” Timoteo suggested, probably aware of her inner conflict; Minerva found herself agreeing easily, glad for the refuge a night’s sleep might afford her.</p><p>__</p><p>The next day after lunch, while her godfather took Harry to a nearby park, Minerva went back to the Momokyou-kai compound to speak to Sunako alone. In the worst case she would be turned away, but she hoped that they could at least talk briefly and get to know one another before Minerva had to make a decision.</p><p>She ended up seated in a small, cozy room that opened up onto what she’d been told was the front ‘viewing garden’, waiting for Sunako to return from making tea.</p><p>“Please pardon Sakurai-san’s absence, McGonagall-san. We truly didn’t expect to see any of your party back so soon.” Sunako said as she bustled about, sounding a bit like the hostess at a restaurant. “Did you continue on with your visit to Vongola-sama’s, ah, cousin, did he say?”</p><p>“A very distant one, yes. But we ended up not going back. Harry –really, all of us were so tired after yesterday.” Minerva accepted the cup Sunako offered her. “Thank you. And as for your husband, I only wished to speak with <em>you</em>, Momoda-san.”</p><p>“I was –<em>am</em> curious. I’m no civilian bride but it still isn’t often I get visitors of your family’s calibre.” Sunako smiled slightly, as if imparting a great secret.</p><p>“Forgive me, but the truth of my visit is very personal. I wouldn’t blame you if you wanted me gone the moment I’ve said it.” Minerva paused, and Sunako motioned for her to continue. “Your child. I understand what you are going through.”</p><p>Sunako grew very still, although her outward expression didn’t change –she only moved to look down at her teacup in the space before Minerva spoke again.</p><p>“I was married for a little while.” She didn’t wear a wedding ring, but Elphinstone had always liked bucking tradition. “Elphinstone and I loved one another dearly, but in our country a war was being fought, both of us on the front lines. He died a year ago, and we were never able to have... well, <em>I’m</em> unable. And since then, so many children I’ve watched grow up were killed fighting.”</p><p>“Why are you telling me this?” Sunako asked.</p><p>“Because I wanted you to see that your grief won’t last forever, even though your love does. And I want you to understand where I’m coming from when I ask you to consider becoming Harry’s mother.”</p><p>Sunako seemed shocked into silence for a moment, before she turned red in the face.</p><p>“Why would you ask <em>me</em> out of all the allies the Vongola has to offer? Surely a magical household would be a better option.” Sunako cast a look around the room and then stared out at the garden to their left. “To have him grow up an heir is no small decision. If I raised him, I would make no promises to be fair between magic and Flames, nor be unbiased if he asked my opinion on his future. I am not a selfless woman.”</p><p>“If he grows up loved and healthy then damn magic.” Minerva stated firmly. “Magic has hurt him enough, and to keep him with me would mean years of egg shells and worry. This may have come about by accident, but from what I’ve seen you and your husband are a good match. From what I’ve been told, you’re good people. I want Harry to be with good people.”</p><p>“...I see.”</p><p>Minerva and Sunako sat quietly for a few minutes, finishing the now lukewarm tea and inspecting the garden. From further in the house, Minerva could faintly hear bursts of laughter and good-natured yelling.</p><p>“Sakurai-san and I are going to have to talk this over, but...” Sunako broke the silence. “If he were to stay with us, what would you want for him, growing up? What were some expectations his parents had?”</p><p>Minerva had to smile. “I’d like for him to know about his parents –if I visited every so often I could handle that. James and Lily wanted him to attend Hogwarts, in Scotland, but that will be up to him. And if he could keep English at least, I would be happy...”</p><p>__</p><p>“Minerva, when did you get back?”</p><p>Minerva paused with her suitcase and papers so she could turn towards Albus. The Headmaster was smiling, genuinely interested in her answer, and for a split second Minerva was about to meet his eyes and respond warmly.</p><p>Then she remembered opening the door to Harry’s ‘bedroom’ and felt sick at her reflex to give this man the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>“Just a few minutes ago, Albus.” She said, slightly clipped.</p><p>“And how was it across the pond? You went to –Montreal, did you say? Or was it Ottawa?”</p><p>“Montreal. I’m terribly tired, Albus. Why don’t I tell you all about it over breakfast tomorrow?”</p><p>Thankfully Albus agreed and they parted ways soon after, and Minerva had to sequester herself in her rooms before she managed to loosen her shoulders and banish the awful roiling in her stomach.</p><p>Perhaps she should look into Occlumency, just as a failsafe for the years to come.</p><p>__</p><p>__</p><p>Flames and Harmonics Hospital of Italy - Fiamme e Armoniche Ospedale d'Italia</p>
