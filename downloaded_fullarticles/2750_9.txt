    <p>The night of October 31st changed the Potter Family forever. While James Potter was out fighting the dark wizards known as Death Eaters, their master, the Dark Lord Voldemort himself, was assaulting the safe house where Lily Potter was watching over their child, Violet Potter. Lily Potter fought the Dark Lord until they both reached their end. What Lily Potter did that night is not known, but when James Potter returned from the battle, the bodies of Lily and Voldemort were surrounded by ashes and the charred remains of the living room. The War was ended not on a battlefield, but in a cottage at Godric’s Hollow, through the sacrifice of the redheaded witch. </p>
<p>And while Violet Potter doesn’t remember that night, she does remember desperately wishing that her mother had survived that night. James Potter was rarely at Potter Mansion; instead, he was usually at the Ministry, whether due to his position as Head Auror or his seats on the Wizengamot. The little she did see of her father was usually full of yelling about a failure on her part. Violet was sure that her mother wouldn’t have let this happen. In the pictures before Lily’s death, everyone seemed so happy. Not like the pictures afterwards, James and her staring straight at the camera, not touching, and their smiles not reaching their eyes.  </p>
<p>------ ------ ----- ------</p>
<p>	Six year old Violet Potter was wearing Gryffindor red robes and her hair was done up with a scarlet ribbon. Her green eyes were full of tears as she was pulled into an abandoned room by her father, his fingers digging into her arm. His face was red and his hazel eyes were narrowed as he glared at his daughter. “Why can’t you just be good? Why do you have to make everything difficult?,” he growled at her. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Violet whispered as she tried to pull out of her father’s grasp, only succeeding in making him hold tighter. </p>
<p>“All you have to do is be polite, play with the other children. Why is that so impossible for you?” His face was next to hers as he lectured her, his free hand was poking her in the chest. </p>
<p>“I will. I promise, I will.” Violet couldn’t say that she didn’t want to play with the children, that she just wanted to read a book and be left alone. That wasn’t what a Heir did. A Heir must be friendly and make connections with their allied Houses. </p>
<p>“All your friends are here. Neville is here. Just be good, for Merlin’s sake. I don’t understand why this is so difficult for you,” he growled. Violet nodded and tried to quiet her sobs. Her father let go of her arm to roughly wipe away her tears. His fingers dug into her shoulder as he marched her to the children’s room. </p>
<p>The room was quite large and was littered with toys big and small, everything from a slide to a tiny Quidditch Team. The walls were blue and had clouds floating through them, mirroring the weather outside of the house. A dragon soared on the ceiling, peeking in and out of the cloud cover. Neville was holding court with Cormac, Justin, Terry, and the rest of the boys, playing with toy wands and swords, pretending to be King Arthur and Merlin. The girls were playing with stuffed pegasi, taking turns flying around the room. Violet walked over to the girls, getting smiles as the group welcomed her back. “Would anyone like to play Gobstones?” asked Violet. The girls were agreeable, and the boys soon joined them. Violet made sure to laugh and smile, putting the growing bruise on her arm in the back of her mind. </p>
<p>------ ------ ----- ------</p>
<p>	At eight years old, Violet Potter had silky hair falling down her back, a gold ribbon keeping her hair away from her face. She wore matching gold robes as she walked to her father’s office. She had been summoned, and her feet seemed to have turned into heavier and heavier weights as she approached her destination. Luckily for Violet, the halls in Potter Mansion were long, and allowed her plenty of time to prepare. Eventually however, she stopped at one of the ornate wooden door, knocking softly on the door. There was no reply, but the door opened after a pause. </p>
<p>The office had marble floors and burnt gold walls. There was many shelves lining the walls and in the center of the room was a large desk with parchment and scrolls littered messily on the surface. Her father sat in a grand chair reading a letter with a furrowed brow. Violet quietly slipped into the chair opposite him. She stared at her folded hands until she heard him set down the paper a few minutes later. </p>
<p>“I’ve decided to arrange a private tutor to come to the Mansion and instruct you. He’s apparently very good...and very quiet. So if you fail to do any magic, he won’t blab to any of the other Houses.” Violet felt his eyes boring holes into her. </p>
<p>“Thank you, Father,” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Look at me when we’re talking. What are you, some cowardly Hufflepuff?” he said. As she looked up, she saw his clenched fists, his reddening face. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Father.”</p>
<p>James snorted. “You’re always sorry, aren’t you? Why can’t you just be good instead of being sorry all the damn time? It’s not hard, Violet. It’s not fucking hard.”</p>
<p>Violet nodded. She could feel her eyes watering but she couldn’t let them fall, that’d just make him angrier. “I’ll do better, I swear it.”</p>
<p>“See that you do. Neville will be joining you with the tutor. Maybe you can take a page out of his book and actually do some magic.”</p>
<p>“Father, I thought that you said it would be a private tutor? Why hire one if there will be other Heirs here anyway?” Violet did not like Neville. He was arrogant and brash and always grabbing her too hard when she just wanted to be left alone. He was also her father’s favorite and the best student in the class hosted by the Browns, a class most of the children of great Houses attended. </p>
<p>“The Longbottoms are our closest allies, they won’t tell anyone if you fail to do magic. Not that you will,” he glared at her, “And, I want you and Neville to become better friends. He’ll do you some good.” </p>
<p>“Yes, Father.” Violet had the feeling Potter Mansion was going to become even more unbearable. </p>
<p>------ ------ ----- ------</p>
<p>Shortly after the arrival of dusk, the train came to a halt at Hogsmeade. The group put their books and games back in their trunks before they joined the horde of students exiting the Express. A large half-giant with wild, wiry, black hair and a thick beard was holding a lantern and yelling for First years. </p>
<p>The first years made their way down the path and Hogwarts came into sight. It was huge, larger than any of the mansions Violet had seen before. There were dozens of towers and the entire castle was glowing from the windows. It looked serene. As she passed over the lake, and no doubt through the wards, Violet felt a sense of safety, of home, wash over her.</p>
<p>As the boats entered into a hidden cave, Violet prepared herself. She didn’t know what the test was; it was considered tradition to keep it secret. Whatever it was, she needed to be placed in Gryffindor. Life would be impossible if she was placed anywhere else. </p>
<p>Hagrid, apparently that was the half-giant’s name, which she vaguely recalled James mentioning, knocked on the door before being replaced by an older witch with grey hair and a hat that was fashionable forty years ago. Minevra McGonagall. The Transfiguration professor and the Head of Gryffindor House. Violet straightened her back. Maybe the Heads placed the students in the Houses. If that were the case, Violet was sure McGonagall would pick her. She was the daughter of Lily and James Potter, two quintessential Gryffindors. </p>
<p>Before too much time had passed, McGonagall was leading all the first years into the Great Hall. It was as magical as the rest of the place. Four, empty, glass columns stood above the double doors large enough to fit an ogre through. Candles joined with the stars in the night sky that acted as the ceiling of the room. Four tables stretched the length of the hall, filled with students in the black Hogwarts robes. </p>
<p>A long table holding about a dozen staff faced them, and in front of the table, on a crickety, wooden stool, was an old, tattered hat. As it burst into song, Violet couldn’t help but be confused. This was the test? To put on the hat? That was all? How could she prove how brave she was if they just had to put on a hat? </p>
<p>“Bones, Susan,” shouted McGonagall, pulling Violet out of her trance. The hat was on Susan’s head for a mere moment before it yelled out Hufflepuff, and Violet watched as Susan hurried over to the Hufflepuff table, where Hannah was already waiting. </p>
<p>“Boot, Terry.” As McGonagall yelled his name, Terry left the gaggle of first years and walked over to the hat. It took the Hat even less time to declare him a Ravenclaw</p>
<p>As the list went on, Violet got more and more worried. The Hat was on each students head for less than a moment before it decided. How in the world would Violet manage to get placed in Gryffindor? </p>
<p>“Potter, Violet.” McGonagall’s yell hit Violet in her soul. The walk to the Hat felt like an eternity. This would decide how well her time at Hogwarts would be. She took a deep breath and plopped the hat on her head. </p>
<p>“Please Gryffindor. Please Gryffindor. Please Gryffindor. Please Gryffindor,” Violet whispered as she felt the Hat enter her mind. </p>
<p>“Hold on a moment, girl. Let me look around,” the Hat said in her mind.</p>
<p>“Please Gryffindor. Please. I need to be placed in Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>“Ravenclaw would suit you better….”</p>
<p>“Please. You don’t understand. I need to be Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>‘I see… Very well. Gryffindor!” </p>
<p>Violet sent a silent thanks to the hat before taking it off her head and walking over to the table of the lions. Neville made room for her next to him and Violet sat down. “Congratulations, Violet. James’ll be happy.”</p>
<p>“He will.”</p>
