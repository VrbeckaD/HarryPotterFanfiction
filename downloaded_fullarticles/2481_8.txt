<p>Year one : A Dragons Call</p>
<p>"Slytherin!" The Sorting Hat shouted. This was immediately followed by a shocked silence as Minerva Mcgonagall took the hat off of eleven year old, Hailey Potter's, head. The chosen one was in Slytherin! The small, for she truly was small, eleven year old gave Minerva a dazzling smile that the professor couldn't help but return, before she headed to the Slytherin table.</p>
<p>Hailey ended up sat between Daphne Greengrass and fifth year prefect, Marcus Flint, across from them, were Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle.</p>
<p>She felt like she should know several people in each house, just a sense of deja vu, almost. She felt lie she should know the fifth year Ravenclaw that has been glaring at her for several minutes. She felt like she should know Neville Longbottom, she had learned his name during the sorting. She felt like should know the professor dressed in black, who she had learned was their potions master and head of house, Severus Snape, she felt almost as if he had been her father figure at one point, She had seen the look of satisfaction in his eyes when she was sorted into his house, also. Her eyes kept scanning the hall, until her emerald green eyes locked with warm grey eyes. This time she knew she should know him. She should know the Hufflepuff boy, who was just a couple years older than herself.</p>

  <em>A sixteen year old, raven haired, blue eyed girl was making her way across a grand courtyard, her light blue dress flowing around her legs, towards a group of knights who were picking on and laughing at a young servant boy.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Teach him a lesson. Go on, boy!" An older looking knight exclaimed.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"This will teach him!" The blonde in the front stated.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Yeah!" came from another knight.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Hehe teach him a lesson!" the knight that spoke earlier said.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The blonde threw the dagger at the shield, the serving boy was still carrying.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Hey! Hang on!" The serving boy exclaimed.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Don't stop!" The blonde told him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Here?" The serving boy asked.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I told you to keep moving!" The blonde said, then threw yet another dagger.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The sixteen year girl old started running full speed at this.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Come on run!" The blonde shouted at the serving boy, who was obviously having trouble even holding the wooden shield up, let alone carry it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Do you want some moving target practice?" The blonde asked. The serving boy finally dropped the shield, just as the sixteen year old arrived.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Hey! Come on! That's enough!" She shouted.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"What?" The blonde asked. The sixteen year old resisted the urge to roll her eyes, honestly was the guy deaf?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"You've had your fun, my friend." The teen said.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Do I know you?" The blonde asked.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Er, I-I'm Merlyn." She told him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"So I don't know you." The blonde stated. Merlyn mentally rolled her eyes. Was the guy stupid, as well as deaf.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"No." She agreed.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Yet you call me friend." The blonde stated.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"That was my mistake." Merlyn answered.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Yes. I think so." The blonde said, obviously thinking things were going his way.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Yeah. I'd never be friends with someone who could be such an ass." Merlyn answered, then turned to walk away.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She heard the blonde snort. "Or I one who could be so stupid." He retorted.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She stopped walking and turned around.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Tell me, Merlyn, do you know how ot walk on your knees?" The blonde asked.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"No." Merlyn answered.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Would you like me to help you?" The blonde asked.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I wouldn't, if I were you." Merlyn warned.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The blonde laughed. "Why? What are you going to do to me?" he asked.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"You have no idea." Merlyn retorted.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Be my guest!"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"What if I don't want to?"</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Come on! Come onnn! Coooome ooooon!" The blonde whined.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Merlyn looked at him, then tried to punch him. That's how she ended up on her knees, her arm locked behind her back.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Whoa!" One of the knights breathed.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I'll have you thrown in jail for that!" The blonde said.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Who do you think you are? The King?" Merlyn retorted.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"No. I'm his son. Arthur." The blonde, Arthur replied. And that is how she ended getting thrown in jail. literally. thrown in jail.</em>
</p>

<p>"What are you looking at?" Hailey jumped, looking away from the Hufflepuff, and to Daphne, who had spoken.</p>
<p>"Oh! Ummm, nothing." Hailey replied. "Hey, Marcus? Who's that? Over at the Hufflepuff table?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Hufflepuff?" A third year Slytherin asked, from the other side of Marcus. "Why are we talking about Hufflepuffs?" She asked.</p>
<p>Marcus rolled his eyes. "Mathilda." He said in warning. "Hufflepuff, eh?" he looked over at the hufflepuff table. "Third year? Grey eyes? Sitting by Finch-Flecthy and Abbot?" Hailey nodded. "That's Cedric Diggory. He's the seeker on their quiddditch team. The best one in the school." he said this last part reluctantly.</p>
<p>"What's quidditch?" Hailey asked. Everyone around her froze. Heads slowly turned to her. "What?" She asked. The only thing that saved her from a speech on qudditch was the fact that the headmaster choose that moment to stand.</p>
<p>xxxXXXxxx</p>
<p>"Hailey!" An ancient voice sounded. Hailey shot up in her bed. She looked around the room, making sure no one else was up. She quickly looked at the clock, Three A.M. After looking at the time, she quickly, but quietly got dressed, and put her boots on, before grabbing the black cloak she had bought in Diagon Alley. Putting the cloak on, she walked out of the room, she had been hearing that voice ever since she got here, se wanted to find out who it belonged to.</p>
<p>"Hailey!" The voice said again. It was a strangely familiar voice. She knew she shouldn't be wondering around the castle at night, especially alone, be it was almost as if something was pulling her to them.</p>
<p>She reached a tunnel like cellar, and hesitated, the door was wide open. "Hailey!" The voice called again. She slowly walked forward, until she reached a trapdoor, which was, once again, wide open.</p>
<p>She climbed up, on a wooden crate and pulled herself up through the trapdoor. She was in a sweet shop.</p>
<p>She slowly walked towards the door, as to not break anything. Once she got outside, she looked around in wonder. She was in a town that looked like it could be on the front of a Christmas card. Then, she saw it, the hogshead inn, She knew that was where the voice was coming from.</p>
<p>She walked up to the inn, and hesitantly, opened the, surprisingly, unlocked door, and stepped in. She saw a man that didn't look to different to the Headmaster.</p>
<p>"Hailey." Aberforth Dumbledore said. "How small you are, for such a great destiny."</p>
