    <p>Gellert caught Newt when he fell- the Magizoologist completely unconscious. The Dark Lord easily picked up the light younger man, glancing at Albus with some amount of worry in his mismatched eyes. </p>
<p>Albus frowned, but seemed to be considerably less worried. </p>
<p>“He works himself ragged until he passes out. I wouldn’t be surprised if he hasn’t eaten or slept for a few days now.” </p>
<p>“Gott in Himmel, Albus! Why didn’t you mention that earlier?” </p>
<p>The Gryffindor smiled, as if revealing in Gellert being annoyed. And, to be honest, he was just a bit. His opinion on muggles and the like hadn’t changed- he didn’t believe in mass murder for the greater good and yet here he was.</p>
<p>With Gellert and an unconscious Newt whom they both planned on courting. Well, courting implied Newt had a choice and Albus wasn’t entirely sure either of them had a choice. </p>
<p>Neither Newt nor himself. </p>
<p>-<br/>
After Gellert had visited him at Hogwarts, Albus had been plagued with visions and letters from Gellert. Somehow, night after night the Hogwarts professor continued to think about the dream Gellert had described to him. It was hellish in its temptation. </p>
<p>He’d made his choice after Ariana’s death- he couldn’t put so many people in danger for his own selfish desire. Even if he wanted it more than anything else in the world- Newt shared between himself and Gellert and the world at their feet as they led it to prosperity and peace. </p>
<p>Hell, just having Gellert in his life again was tempting. No one else could converse with him like Gellert, no one else in this world understood him like the German wizard. </p>
<p>‘Well,’ Albus thought, walking back to the bed- watching Gellert gently lay Newt down. ‘Perhaps Gellert isn’t the only one.’</p>
<p>Newt was special, to say the very least. His interest in research and education was similar to Albus’ own interests in the field. Save for the near fanatical obsession with beasts. </p>
<p>Watching Newt fitfully sleep, twisting and twitching for a few moments before settling further and further asleep, it began to dawn on him what he and Gellert were doing. </p>
<p>They’d essentially kidnapped Newt- they’d put their mark on him without his permission and Merlin’s beard- hadn’t Gellert technically assaulted him? </p>
<p>“Al?”  Gellert’s voice was soft, an arm around his hip pulling him closer to Gellert’s side, “What is it?”</p>
<p>“What are we doing?” He muttered, looking to Gellert. His eyes wide- oh what in the hell had they done? What were they planning to do? Keep Newt here, pretty and chained until he bent to their whim? </p>
<p>“Albus!” Gellert said again, trying to get his attention. Taking the other’s face in his hands, Gellert looked into the other’s eyes, finally catching them. </p>
<p>“Breath with me,” The blonde ordered, the two of them breathing in and out until Albus’ shoulders slumped, and he practically fell into Gellert’s embrace. </p>
<p>“We can’t- Gel?” </p>
<p>Gellert bit his lip, forcing himself to stay calm. Once Albus felt confident he would be fine- he’d been different since Ariana’s death. He was still as brilliant as ever, as powerful as ever but he’d become scarred from it. Ariana’s death- the death of an innocent had pulled them apart. </p>
<p>Gellert really didn’t really understand it, he understood her death was tragic and a mistake. He understood that Albus didn’t want any danger to befall Newt.<br/>
But sometimes Albus would grow so panicked it was like he wasn’t even here. </p>
<p>He did love Albus, and he was growing quite fond of Newt. The visions he’d seen had simply confirmed that the three of them were meant to be together. But he really didn’t know how to deal with this. </p>
<p>Brushing back Albus’s hair, Gellert helped Albus lay down with Newt. These things always exhausted the Gryffindor too. Not that Gellert could blame him, just watching him go through it was exhausting. </p>
<p>Gellert watched Newt curl into Albus whose arms wrapped around the Magizoologist. Albus had confirmed that he and Newt hadn’t had anything beyond a teacher-student relationship but it seemed as if subconsciously there was already a tie there. </p>
<p>They looked nice together- of course, Gellert already knew they would. </p>
<p>“Everything will be fine, my loves.” Gellert murmured in his native tongue- pressing a kiss to both of their foreheads before leaving the room. He had things to do, and a world to rebuild for the two slumbering wizards. </p>
<p> <br/>
Despite the overwhelming stress of the last few days, Newt’s body still had a schedule it followed. </p>
<p>Early in the morning, Newt woke up to care for his creatures. He’d been so rushed the night before that he hadn’t been able to feed them for the night. Hopefully, they wouldn’t be too upset with him. </p>
<p>Not that he could blame them- when he took every single one of them in he’d promised to take care of them, to protect them and watch over them until they were ready to be released. And for the ones who couldn’t be released, Newt would ensure they had the best life they could. </p>
<p>Laying next to him in the bed was Dumbledore-still asleep. Grindelwald was no where to be seen, and as much as he needed to straight out his thoughts and opinions on that his creatures came first. </p>
<p>Slipping out of bed, quiet as he could, Newt saw his case had been moved to the end of the bed- his wand balanced atop it. </p>
<p>Grindelwald and Dumbledore must really think he wasn’t- rather, couldn’t- leave if they were giving him his wand. </p>
<p>Picking up his wand and opening his case on the floor, Newt noted with some amount of displeasure that his wand had been cleaned. Someone- Grindelwald or Dumbledore had cleaned and buffed it. The inlaid mother-of-pearl at the end of the handle shown like new. </p>
<p>Newt rolled his eyes, slipping his wand into his holster at his hip, this suddenly felt less like a fairy-tale damsel-in-distress situation and more like being stuck at home with Theseus again. He always insisted on cleaning Newt’s wand and trying to organize Newt’s chaos. It was ridiculous, if you asked Newt. </p>
<p>Slipping down into his case, Newt knew immediately that something was wrong. Someone had been here- had moved his things around before attempting to put them back in place. </p>
<p>What the bloody buggering fuck?!

Practically falling the last few steps, Newt ran through his enclosures. His breathes coming in quick successions- counting each and every animal inside. He checked over every single inch of them and their enclosures- casting spells to ensure that whoever had come here hadn’t caused any issues. There was a delicate balance with the borders between enclosures, the temperatures of each enclosure, all of it was very intricate and vital for his creatures survival. A single charm out of place could be their end. </p>
<p>Thankfully, he found that everything was fine. The only difference being that it appeared as if whoever had been in his case had fed his creatures- judging by his moved journal from where he’d left it by the Bowtruckle tree to the inside of his shed and the moved feeding bins. </p>
<p>The worst thing Newt noticed was that his creatures were stressed and were very grateful to see Newt. His Bowtruckles had chirped at him, their tones annoyed at being stressed for their caretaker. Pickett, who’d spent the night in the case when Newt had gone to save the Zouwu just in case things went crazy. Which, in the end, they did was equally as upset.</p>
<p>Pickett had scurried up Newt’s hands up to his shirt pocket, chirping loudly. </p>
<p>“I know- I’m sorry.” The Magizoologist murmured, taking a special amount of time for each creature, to pet them or brush them or just for Newt to ensure to himself that his creatures were okay. </p>
<p>He’d spent a bit longer with the newborn occamys he’d rescued from Spain. At the opposite end from the Sudanese girl’s obscurial was the newest area in the case. It was a hot and mountainous area, a large nest charmed to move the egg inside and keep it properly warm. Usually, Newt kept the egg with him but, like with Pickett he’d figured it was safer to leave the egg in the case last night. </p>
<p>It was a bright coppery-gold, specks of black with a bright light inside shinning through the hard eco-skeleton of the egg. </p>
<p>It was the rarest creature Newt had ever come across. Phoenix eggs were rare simply because Phoenix’s only had an offspring one every 100 or so lives. When Newt had found this egg, its mother had been being experimented on for her reincarnate properties and killed over and over again until she could lay another egg. The mother hadn’t been able to hang on any longer and when she died, instead of turning to ash until she was reborn again the mother phoenix had been set to flame, the ashes instead replaced with small golden diamonds. Newt had kept them only because he didn’t know what else to do with them. He’d laid them near the nest he’d made for the egg but he didn’t think he could just leave them there. If whoever owned the building came back and used the diamonds to do fund similar research would have been awful. If one could call what those wizards did research. </p>
<p>“Hello little one,” Newt murmured, picking up the egg and keeping it in the crook of his arm as he continued through the case until he felt emotionally ready to leave. </p>
<p>Newt had been mostly wasting time as long as he could- he didn’t know what would be waiting for him outside the case. </p>
<p>An Imperio? Did he even have the willpower to fight off such a curse? Why did they even want Newt? Did they want his creatures? </p>
<p>Did they think by using Newt’s sexual inexperience they could take advantage of him? Well, that had already happened- Leta had used him and Newt refused to let it happen again. </p>
<p>Via charms he’d set to alert him around the entrance and boundaries of the case, he heard the case open.After New York and Grindelwald-as-Graves took a trip through his case, he'd found alerting charms to be a necessity.  </p>
<p>“Newt? Can you come out?” Dumbledore’s voice called out- but he didn’t come in, which Newt was thankful for. So, there were some boundaries at least Dumbledore would respect. </p>
<p>Pressing a kiss to his Niffler’s head- who seemed to very much not enjoy the extra attention but willing to withstand it for the time being- Newt headed towards the shed. Keeping the egg secure, Newt moved to head out of the case. </p>
<p>He could only hope that he could either figure out a way to take the ring off or just escape or not be hurt by the other two men. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Grindelwald had made it quite clear what he wanted to do with Newt yesterday, and while Newt wasn’t opposed to sex he didn’t really want to jump into it so to speak. </p>
<p>He’d enjoyed the kiss- moral issues aside, it had been pleasurable. But Professor Dumbledore? Merlin’s beard, that was awkward- the man had been his teacher for magic’s sake! </p>
<p>And yet, yesterday, he hadn’t been totally opposed to what he’d seen. Thinking more on it, aside from the shock of walking in on two people having sex- especially those two specific people, it had been exhilarating Newt supposed. </p>
<p>Giving the Zuowu a last reassuring pet, Newt moved to leave his case. </p>
<p>Waiting in the bedroom- or was it Grindelwald’s? Dumbledore’s? Both? Did they both live here?- was Dumbledore, now fully dressed and awake. </p>
<p>“Good morning, Newt.” </p>
<p>Newt muttered a response, looking around to see if Grindelwald was around as well. Thankfully, it was just himself and Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“Hungry?” </p>
<p>Now that he was thinking about it, the Magizoologist couldn’t remember the last time he’d had a real meal. It was quite possibly that it was in New York with the Goldsteins and Jacob. </p>
<p>“Actually, I’d like to leave.”  If the two of them had expected Newt to just roll over and play along with whatever this was, they were sorely mistaken. </p>
<p>He may not be as brave as a Gryffindor or as cunning as a Slytherin but he was loyal. Loyal to his own ideas which clearly stated he didn’t believe in magical supremacy or in mass slaughter for the greater good. </p>
<p>The Hufflepuff wasn’t interested in taking sides- everyone had a bit of darkness in them so neither side was ever really innocent. By himself, Newt could always make the choice himself on if things were right or not. It’s what made serving in the War so difficult until he’d found a place with the dragons. There, he didn’t really have a commanding officer and could protect the dragons since the English and their allies insisted on trying to use them for their petty conflicts. </p>
<p>Dumbledore hummed in response, neither affirmative or refusing. </p>
<p>“At least have a cup of tea- we wanted to talk to you last night but-“ </p>
<p>“You’re very bad at taking care of yourself, Newton.” Grindelwald interrupted, waiting at the bottom of the stairs. He watched them descending with an odd look that Newt couldn’t place. </p>
<p>“I’ve been busy,” the Magizoologist bit back, feeling partially like a scolded child- like when Theseus yelled at him for the same thing. Except this somehow felt worse, or at the very least awkward. </p>
<p>Dumbledore walked past Grindelwald- pressing a kiss to the German’s cheek before continuing on into the dinning room. </p>
<p>“Come, Newt.” </p>
<p>Newt felt frozen- waiting until Grindelwald walked away too. Grindelwald had eyed him over, grinning before following after Dumbledore. </p>
<p>Taking a deep breath before following last, Newt was about to step through when a chirping in his ear caught his attention. Pickett had moved up to his shoulder, sitting and holding onto his shirt. </p>
<p>In his pocket, he felt the phoenix egg’s heat flare for a moment, as if comforting its adoptive mum. </p>
<p>Okay- he could do this. Breakfast with his ex-professor and an international terrorist who both wanted to have sex with him. </p>
<p>He could do this, right? </p>
<p>Newt wished he felt a little bit more confident as he entered the fray.</p>
