    <p>Blüdhaven had enough psychopaths, mafia families and other mentally unstable meta without importing other and Nightwing had enough work with the local product without having to run after a Scottish serial killer, as Officer Grayson in the day and as Nightwing in the nights.</p><p>But you don’t always get what you wish for, something Dick learned when he was just a boy. The UK was, at least, properly embarrassed about their killer and send a team to help.</p><p>The idea was nice, but the result…. Officer Dean Thomas was fine, smart and competent, Officer Longbottom….</p><p>Officer Longbottom was weird, and this was coming from a man who throw himself from high buildings in highly technological spandex. For a moment, Dick thought Longbottom could be their killer in disguise. Not the first time that type of thing would have happened. But he saw at the same time Longbottom and the killer, so that one was out.</p><p>As days passed, as the number of dead rose, a small part of his brain was still stuck on the Englishman, incapable of dedicating itself to their killer only.</p><p>Everything was slightly out of place. The expressions were wrong, more than the simple USA/UK language barrier should be. The mannerism, the baffling lack of pop culture understanding, the strange scars on his cheeks…Officer Thomas tried to defuse the bomb of Dick’s curiosity: “My partner was raised into a cult. It’s a difficult subject, please don’t try it with him.” It would have been very nice of Dean Thomas to protect Neville Longbottom’s triggers, if Dick wasn’t sure it was lies, lies, more lies.</p><p>It was distracting. Dick had been raised by a detective, he hated when answers escaped him like that. It almost costed him his life. A stupid mistake, a few micro-seconds too late… He would have sworn he heard Longbottom yell something strange when he fell. He probably had a concussion, because from the floor of that warehouse, it was like a light show was going on, strange sounds, violent lights, and not one gunshot.</p><p>When he came back to work two days later, he invited Longbottom for a drink. It was not a plan. Just a thank you to the quiet Englishman for saving his life. Dick had no underplot on this, and Bruce would probably have been disappointed by that!</p><p>Just a drink.</p><p>What an idiot he had been.</p><p>Hours later, Dick was pacing up and down in front of the windows in his loft. It was the middle of the night, Nightwing was supposed to be patrolling at this hour, his body refused sleep. But he didn’t want to take the risk. In the bed, he could hear the quiet respiration of Longbottom. He seemed profoundly asleep, but if he woke up at four in the morning alone, he certainly would have question!</p><p>What stupid idea to bring him here.</p><p>The lights of the city were entering the bedroom from the windows and Dick stopped.</p><p>He had felt it under his fingers, a few hours before, but he hadn’t understood, taken by the moment and the delicious warmth of the other man body. Now, he could see them perfectly.</p><p>Scars of a whip, on the back of his one night lover.</p><p>Had Thomas told him the truth? The scars were old, too old to have been a mission turned bad, Longbottom couldn’t have been more than a teenager when he received them. And now that Dick thought about it, the ones on his cheeks were old too, and nothing he could identify.</p><p>Dick let himself fall in a chair.</p><p>He was a detective, raised a detective, and it couldn’t be forgotten.</p><p>He loved a good mystery.</p>
