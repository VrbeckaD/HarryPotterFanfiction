    <p>“I’m bored!” Harry whined, pouting at his friends. The rest of the common room ignored him, as by now they were used to the chaos that the Golden Trio would create in their wake. “Hey, what’s that?” he asked, suddenly interested in the newspaper Hermione held.</p><p>“It’s just the Prophet, where that absolute hag Rita Skeeter writes trash and gossip about everyone.” she sighed, glancing at the article with revulsion. "Unfortunately, it's the only source of news we have around here," she said, her lips curling in distaste. Harry blinked slowly.</p><p>“Then….why don’t we create our own newspaper?” he asked, and Ron slowly turned to look at him, eyes wide.</p><p>“Mate, I think that’s the best idea I’ve ever heard you say yet.” he breathed, gaping at Harry, who pouted indignantly. Now the other Gryffindors were listening in, wondering if they would actually try to pull it off.</p><p>“Fred, George! Find a good location for our base!” Harry exclaimed, facing the twins. Everyone was gobsmacked when the two devils of Gryffindor actually listened and sped out of the common room. Harry turned on his heel to point at Hermione. “Hermione, you, Neville, and Luna- who has yet to explain how she got in here- will start on how the newspaper will be organized. Like sections on different things going on, puzzles, or even comic strips! Figure it out!” Luna gave a cheerful salute as the trio pulled out a stack of papers. “Katie, Angelina, Alicia, we need a good name for our newspaper. Ginny, Ron, and Lavender, when the twins come back, I want you three to go help them decorate our new base. Make it a good space to work in. I’m going to ask Professor Dumbledore permission for this, because it’s great to have permission, even if though I was going to do this even if he said no.”</p><p>And with that, Harry marched out of the room, leaving the large group of gaping Gryffindors.</p><p> </p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>“Lemons drops,” Harry said, and waited for the gargoyle to jump to the side before running up the steps. “Professor Dumbledore!” He shouts, opening the door only to see him talking to Professor McGonagall. “Oh, sorry professors.”</p><p>“It’s alright Harry my boy. What is it that has you in such a rush?”</p><p>“I would like to start my own newspaper here at Hogwarts, and would like to have your permission, which would help with any legal issues that might pop up.” Dumbledore and McGonagall blinked in surprise. Well, they certainly hadn’t expected that.</p><p>“Of course you can Mr. Potter, just be careful of what you print.” Harry grinned happily before running out of the room.</p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>“We have permission!” Harry shouted once the portrait closed behind him. The Gryffindors cheered, and Luna came up to him.</p><p>“Here’s our plan for the newspaper.” She said, handing him a sheet of parchment.</p><p>“There’s going to be a section on normal everyday household spells, along with common household potions to help with fevers and colds, a runes crossword puzzle, and a few fun facts about magic. On the front page will be the main story, with a few others behind it. There will be a section on new developments within the wizarding world, and interesting interviews on different issues going on as well. Job advertising will be there for new graduates, with a daily comic strip on the back.”</p><p>Everyone stared at her, not used to hearing her talk without her dreamy tone of voice. Harry, however, took it in stride. “Thanks, Luna!” He grinned and turned to face the three Gryffindor chasers.</p><p>“We can’t decide between three options, Harry. The Niffler, The Wizarding Times, or Magical Post.” Katie said, listing the three options.</p><p>“Then let's take a vote,” Harry said simply. He turned to face the common room. “Alright, raise your hand if you want it to be named The Niffler.”</p><p>Thirty percent of the Gryffindors raised their hands.</p><p>“Magical Post.”</p><p>Only ten percent raised their hands.</p><p>“Well, there’s your answer. The Wizarding Times it is.” Harry concluded. “I’m heading out to find the twins and the others with the new room. Hermione, work with Luna on what is going into our first issue. Colin, you’re our photographer, so listen to them ok? We also need an artist for the comic strips….”</p><p>Dean hesitantly raises his hand. “I can draw really well.”</p><p>“Then head over to Hermione and Luna, see ya!” With a jaunty wave, Harry jumped out the portrait. After checking to see if he was alone, Harry whipped out the Marauder's Map, whispered, “I solemnly swear I’m up to no good.” and scanned the map for the devils of Gryffindor.</p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>“What if we put up a desk for every branch?” Fred suggested.</p><p>“That wouldn’t be good since we have no idea how many branches there are going to be, and how many people we have working here.” George countered.</p><p>“Fill the room with desks?” Fred asked glancing at his twin.</p><p>“Too little space to move around.” They agreed.</p><p>“Or how about we put an expansion charm on the room? Like Dad’s tent?” George suggested, and the pair nodded in agreement.</p><p>Lavender, Ron, and Ginny just deadpanned at them. “Finally, they agree on something,” Ginny muttered. Harry suddenly burst into the room.</p><p>“Hello!” He exclaimed. “I’m here with information. So we’re going to need a big room, with a staircase, since I have no idea how many people actually want to work here. I’m going to put out fliers after lunch. And yes, they are for all the houses. So just expand the room to fit a lot of people, and stick up a few Hogwarts banners, and make it comfortable.”</p><p>Fred, George, Lavender, Ginny, and Ron all whipped out their wands to do just that.</p>
