  <em>September 1st 1980</em>
</p><p>"Alright, you lot, shut your mouths," Mad-Eye Moody said as he limped to the front of the room, the hushed conversations falling silent immediately. "Welcome to the first ten week training camp for the Auror programme."</p><p>The excitement bubbled over again until he raised a hand, silencing them once more. Lyra watched his every move carefully. She'd met Mad Eye Moody only once but it was enough to know that the man was unpredictable.</p><p>"This isn't summer camp. We're not going to sing songs and hold hands while we skip in circles. It's going to be brutal. You're going to hate me – oh believe me, I know you don't think it now but you will – and you're going to hurt in places you didn't know it was possible to hurt. You're going to hate the sound of this cane of mine. But you're also going to be up to scratch by the time we're through or so help you… There's a war going on out there, in case you haven't noticed, and we don't have time for idiots who want to play at being heroes."</p><p>His words sank in like a pebble dropping through deep water and the silence in the room grew thicker. Everyone, including Lyra, knew about the war. It was hard not to. Muggles being killed, attacks on wizarding communities, the throbbing green skulls in the sky over houses signalling terror and torture. She paled slightly, hoping that Moody knew she wasn't here to play games. He had seemed to understand, but had made it very clear that she would still have to earn her place like any other recruit.</p><p>"Being an Auror isn't just a job. This isn't for the faint hearted. You're not going to speak to the outside world for these ten weeks and even then you might not make it through to the next stage so listen carefully and pay attention," Moody continued, his voice carrying through the rows of young witches and wizards.</p><p>He scanned the faces of everyone slowly as they held their breath, before he pointed his cane at a dark haired, dark eyed girl at the front. "You. What are the seven uses of dragon blood?"</p><p>Lyra frowned and opened her mouth. "There are twelve uses of-"</p><p>An explosion of blue light flew towards her, dissipating inches from her nose as she threw up a hasty shield charm, dragging her wand out from her robes. Blinking slowly, she stared at Moody in shock.</p><p>Another beam of light sped towards a blonde boy at the back of the room, but no shield charm appeared in time and he was blasted backwards off his chair, hitting the floor with a thud; by now, the rest of the room had their wands out, every pair of eyes wide.</p><p>"Lyra Black, right?" Moody asked, jabbing the cane towards the girl.</p><p>"Right, Sir," she responded, wand still out.</p><p>He nodded appreciatively and made a gruff noise. "Clever girl. Everyone take a leaf out of Lyra's book here, and step it up."</p><p>She didn't bother to smile – everyone knew that was only the first test.</p><p>Moody began pacing the front of the room, making everyone just nervous enough to keep their wands closer than before. "Now I am an extremely busy man, so I will not be overseeing your training yet. That pleasure falls to Auror McKinnon." He turned and swivelled the infamous eye towards the door. "AUROR MCKINNON."</p><p>As if on cue, which it very probably was, the door opened and a young man strode in, twirling his wand in his fingers and smirking. "You called?"</p><p>Moody rolled both eyes and jerked a finger towards the recruits. "This is your lot. They're all idiots, you've got your work cut out for you."</p><p>Auror McKinnon laughed. "You say this every year, Moody. I'll manage."</p><p>Moody snorted and gestured to the raised stage. "Don't fuck it up."</p><p>McKinnon's smirk only grew as he nodded, making Moody chuckle as he made his way out, the magical eye whirling in its socket.</p><p>"Alright now the old man has gone, I'm Mason McKinnon and I run Auror boot camp," he grinned, tucking his wand away and folding his arms across his chest. "Think the Muggle army camps but worse, because we can hurt you more and fix you right back up again."</p><p>The Pureblood recruits looked confused while the rest grimaced slightly. Lyra's expression remained perfectly blank and she just shifted in her seat slightly as she fully recognised the man standing in front of her: Mason McKinnon was the year above Sirius, but the two had both been part of the Gryffindor gang responsible for most of the chaos at Hogwarts. Being a couple of years younger than Sirius, being in Slytherin and not being a blood traitor meant that Lyra had never spoken to Mason – and had never wanted to, thank you very much – but she knew full well the man was at least partially responsible for Sirius leaving home.</p><p>"So to kick start a fun ten weeks, we're going to go and get changed into training gear and then meet for some exercise!" he said, a glint in his eye. "Did you seriously think it was all going to be duelling?"</p><p>Quite a few people groaned, and Lyra's heart privately sank. Compared to some of the boys here, she was a foot shorter, 30 kilos lighter and skinny to boot. If this was anything close to physical contact, she was going to be kicked out immediately.</p><p>"You've been assigned dorms – girls, there's only one room of you so that should be easy to work out. Head there, get changed and meet at the field in fifteen minutes," Mason said lazily, glancing at his watch. "No wands."</p><p>Well shit, she thought, she'd be on the first Portkey home. Grimacing, she picked up her bag from under the chair and slipped out of the row of chairs, following the excited stream of wizards out into the corridor and down the dorm rooms.</p>
<hr/><p>Mason was already in training gear so he went outside right away to wait, spinning the whistle round his finger as he paced at the starting line.</p><p>The silence gave him to reflect on the miserable lot he'd got this year. Compared to the previous year, numbers were definitely up (more people than ever wanted to help) but with only one female dorm and only one Muggleborn in the whole programme, the brewing war was certainly having an impact on the makeup of the group. They'd figured that no one wanted to be a double target; Muggleborns were either finding safer jobs or avoiding the magical world altogether and more and more of the female Hogwarts graduates were being funnelled straight into healing or Ministry desk jobs and steering clear of the traditionally male jobs. Even the thought made his lip curl slightly, but he looked up from the turf as the first few recruits came jogging over.</p><p>He rolled his shoulders and smiled tightly. "Okay, so I know you all had to pass certain tests before you got here, but we're going to start with a simple fitness circuit anyway. It's been a while since you were tested, and I want to see where we're at for myself. Do a lap of the field, and we'll go from there."</p><p>A group of lads who'd clearly already teamed up broke into a fast jog immediately, and the rest trailed after them. The girl with the serious eyes that Mason remembered from the front of the room before rolled her eyes and set off too, clearly pacing herself.</p><p>Smart, Mason thought. The lads at the front were clearly trying way too hard already and he could tell they were going to be dicks.</p><p>Once they were back, he brought out the blackboard, tapping it once with his wand to reveal the list of exercises. Quite a few people looked horrified, and Mason grinned smugly.</p><p>"Pair up and get on with it – I'd do it with you but… I don't need to. I'm making notes too, so don't slack off or fuck around."</p><p>Serious Girl clenched her jaw slightly but turned to the one member of the group already familiar to Mason and one by one, the pairs started working their way through the list. Mason wondered if there was any weight at all on some of them – Serious Girl especially, who he found himself looking at solely because she looked so out of place amongst the muscled boys around her with her sharp cheekbones and her collarbones that he thought a good kick could snap in two. Even if they'd all passed the basic fitness requirements, these ten weeks were going to be grim.</p><p>Lyra was only half way through but she felt like she was going to throw up. She'd trained for the initial test, passed it by the skin of her teeth and hadn't been able to train at all since she'd finished Hogwarts and gone home for the summer, her mother's restrictions meaning that any progress she had made in the privacy of the school's extensive grounds was quickly undone.</p><p>The girl she was partnered with, Dorcas, was slim like she was, but was wiry and strong and a year older than herself and if it wasn't for Dorcas' reassuring smiles and the judgemental look of Auror McKinnon, Lyra would've stopped already.</p><p>"Ten more, come on," Dorcas grinned, holding Lyra's feet steady as she forced herself to sit up again. "I know you've got it in you, and I know my mum packed me plenty of chocolate cake – half of it is yours if you finish."</p><p>Lyra laughed breathlessly, leaning back and then curling her spine once again as she shook her head. "I <em>have</em> to finish. And I don't eat chocolate."</p><p>"Not the point, and you'll want the chocolate after this."</p><p>Lyra nodded, gritted her teeth and ground out the last few with robotic movements before collapsing back down with a huff.</p><p>"Congratulations," Auror McKinnon said from above, holding his hand out and helping her up. She accepted the help only because her stomach felt like it was tearing itself apart.</p><p>"Thanks," she muttered, smoothing her hair down and grabbing her fleece off the floor. She wiped the smudge of makeup from under her eyes and wrinkled her nose in disgust.</p><p>"Did the others go back inside already?" Dorcas asked, looked far more cheerful than Lyra did.</p><p>Mason nodded. "Yeah, I sent them back in when they finished up. Just go back to the dorms and unpack for now, one of the others will be along in a bit to give you more information."</p><p>Lyra glanced back towards the building and scowled – they were the last ones out here and the others had to be laughing. The blonde boy who'd fallen off his chair clearly already had it in for her after Moody had laughed at him inside and she didn't need this too.</p><p>"Hey," Mason said, raising an eyebrow as he watched her, "It's the first day, don't stress. I wasn't taking notes on ability, mostly just who I think is going to be a twat, that's it."</p><p>Lyra nodded sharply and just stomped past, focussing on the hot shower she was going to have rather than the future ten weeks of failing miserably. She knew she'd been shit, and his pity compliment did nothing to improve her mood. So much rested on this, she was risking far too much to take her failure well.</p><p>Dorcas winced. "Homesick, maybe?"</p><p>Mason just laughed and shrugged. "You think I care? She finished, some people don't even do that."</p><p>Dorcas laughed too, the musical sound reaching Lyra's burning red ears as she stalked off. "See you later, McKinnon," Dorcas said teasingly, before running to catch up to her new friend.</p>
<hr/><p>"Do you know McKinnon already?" Lyra asked, slowly scraping the last of the shared chocolate cake onto her fork, glancing across at Dorcas from under her eyelashes. The girl was obviously determined to be friends with her as she'd followed her into the cafeteria and Lyra appreciated it even if it wasn't something she was used to. All of her friends from school were only her friends because their families were, not because they genuinely cared about each other. She wouldn't miss any of them.</p><p>Dorcas grinned, "Why do you think that?"</p><p>"Well you either know him already or you want to shag him, there's no other explanation for how friendly you were before."</p><p>Dorcas rolled her eyes and wiped her finger around the plate to scoop up the icing. "I sort of knew him from Hogwarts, both in Gryffindor and all that. But no, I don't really know him already."</p><p>"So you <em>do</em> want to shag him?" Lyra smirked, leaning back on the dining hall chair and folding her arms.</p><p>"Jesus Christ, he's hot but I'm not going to shag the instructor," she snorted. "I don't swing that way."</p><p>"Oh!" Lyra said, flustered. No one in her family was anything like that and she wasn't sure if she was going to seem like a twat. She'd only ever been told bad things about that kind of person but Dorcas was already disproving most of them.</p><p>"Oh indeed," she sniggered. "So he's all yours," Dorcas fired back, waggling her eyebrows.</p><p>"If I'd wanted to find a man, I would've stayed at home, thank you very much."</p><p>"Of course, you're here to be very serious, to work hard and become a respectable Auror," Dorcas teased, standing up and gathering up their plates to take back to the hatch at the end of the room.</p><p>Lyra followed, giving her a look. "Yes, that's very much the point of being here. Why else would anyone be here?"</p><p>Leaning in, Dorcas smirked conspiratorially, "Is that why you're here immediately after graduating and not a year later as per the rules?"</p><p>Lyra's smile dropped slightly, but she recovered and shrugged. "Why would you think that?"</p><p>"Well I was Prefect for my year, you absolutely weren't my year at Hogwarts and I'll be damned if you're a year older than me. Process of elimination," she shrugged. "But don't worry, your secret's safe with me. And I won't even pry if you don't want me to."</p><p>"I'd appreciate that, yeah," Lyra muttered. "I'm lucky to be here, and I don't want to risk it by letting everyone know."</p><p>"Sure thing," Dorcas said easily, nudging her side as she scraped her plate and dropped the cutlery into the washing up bowls before miming zipping her lips. "Like I said, secret's safe with me."</p><p>"Thanks," Lyra smiled. She actually believed Dorcas would keep that promise, and she was grateful. "And in return, I won't tell anyone that you brought a teddy with you to Auror training."</p><p>"Mr Snuggles is a very important part of my life, I <em>have</em> to have him here!"</p><p>"You're going to be a terrifying Auror," she drawled.</p><p>"Don't you know it," Dorcas smirked, "Fear my wrath, and that of Mr Snuggles!"</p>
<hr/><p>Mason knocked on Moody's office door and entered before he'd replied, knowing that Moody wouldn't care – he hated time wasting more than he hated people forgetting formalities. "Daily report, Boss."</p><p>"Go on, fill me in I suppose," Moody said, dropping the file he'd been reading down onto his desk and leaning back, the chair sighing as well as the man.</p><p>"They're actually not half bad," Mason admitted, settling into the chair on the other side of the desk. "Some of the guys are the kind of guys I'd have punched at school, but should shape up to be decent Aurors. The girls are… varying. Dorcas is good, as expected, the others are completely average and then there's-"</p><p>"Let me guess, Lyra Black?"</p><p>Mason looked surprised that the older man knew the name already, because he couldn't possibly think of what she would've done to stand out to Moody in the ten minutes they'd been in the same room. Even Mason had had to check the list to find out her name. "Uh, yeah, actually."</p><p>Moody huffed. "What I tell you can't leave this room. I'm not telling the other instructors because it really won't affect them at all once we're past the physical stage, but seeing as you've already noticed, I'm going to have to tell you."</p><p>"Moody, she's shit," Mason said, exasperated. "I mean, don't get me wrong, she finished and didn't throw up, but she was there ten minutes after everyone else. She's as skinny as a rake, I could break her with my pinkie finger."</p><p>The Head Auror huffed again. "Yes."</p><p>"How did she pass the initial fitness test, seriously?" Mason laughed.</p><p>"She passed, but that's not relevant. She's here under special circumstances."</p><p>"Sirius doesn't even speak to her, there is no way he'd have put in this request!"</p><p>"Would you let me finish, McKinnon?" Moody snapped, and Mason closed his mouth firmly, knowing when to stop.</p><p>"She's here under special circumstances – not because Sirius spoke to me, but because she did," he explained calmly, flicking his wand to lock the office door and casting muffliato to ensure that no one outside heard even a snippet of the conversation.</p><p>"She <em>what</em>?"</p><p>"She came into the Department right after graduation this year to personally hand me her application and-"</p><p>"She's only just graduated? She's eighteen?!" Mason choked.</p><p>"McKinnon, I swear to Merlin," Moody said tightly, "Yes, she's only eighteen. No, that's not in line with policy. Yes, I will explain if you let me."</p><p>Mason ran a hand through his hair agitatedly but nodded. "Sure, yeah."</p><p>Mad-Eye re-opened the file in front of him and flicked back to the front before sliding it across the desk to Mason, who snatched it up, scanning the document.</p><p>"What the fuck?"</p><p>"Now do you see?" Moody said calmly, his magical eye focussing in on his second in command.</p><p>Clearing his throat, Mason nodded slowly and dropped the folder back onto the table. Her black and white photograph seemed to stare back up at him accusingly, making him feel guilty although he didn't quite know why. It was a magical photo, but she was barely moving, just blinking occasionally with a ferocity in her eyes that survived through the low quality of the photo itself. The lack of colour made her look even thinner than she was in real life.</p><p>"You will get her up to standard, because she isn't going to go home at the end of Phase One. Do you understand?" Mad-Eye Moody said, his voice as serious as Mason had ever heard it. "She is going to pass those exams with flying colours."</p><p>Mason stayed quiet for a short beat, watching his boss.</p><p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
<hr/><p>The end of each week was a rest day. McKinnon seemed to find that funny – some Muggle religious thing that Lyra didn't understand and didn't have the energy to care about – but as she was finishing up the 10km run that Saturday, Lyra could only feel horrifically relieved that she had a full day in bed tomorrow.</p><p>Dorcas had already finished the run, of course, but Lyra wasn't actually at the back which made her far more pleased than she really should be because she was still way below the level she needed to be. Trailing across the finish line, Lyra bent over double and gratefully took the water bottle that Dorcas offered her, lungs heaving.</p><p>"Hey, you beat your personal best!" her friend tried, checking the stop clock around McKinnon's neck and grinning.</p><p>Lyra scowled as she straightened up and shook her head. "Hard to do worse than my personal best, honestly."</p><p>"At least you already know that," McKinnon said calmly, writing the time down on the clipboard in his hand.</p><p>She huffed at him as she turned away to grab her jacket off the fence and Dorcas made an 'I don't know why he's being crabby either' look. "Someone clearly didn't sleep well."</p><p>"Hair's looking a little crazy, Black," a voice interrupted arrogantly. Edgar Bones, the blonde boy from the first day, smiled, pushing off the fence and tugging on the end of her ponytail. "You remind me of someone, it's bugging me."</p><p>She jutted her chin out and stepped backwards, out of his reach. "Don't touch me, thanks."</p><p>"Awh, a little sweat never bothered me," he grinned, a glint in his eyes.</p><p>She just ignored him and pulled the jacket on to keep the biting chill away, moving away from him and his gang quickly. The training centre wasn't in the Ministry itself, but in a Ministry Auror compound somewhere (they hadn't told them where for security reasons) in the countryside. The temperature was great when you were running and trying desperately not to overheat, but once you stopped, it was grim.</p><p>"Is he being weird again?" Dorcas said, her nose crinkling up as she jerked her head towards Edgar.</p><p>"When is he not weird? Boys are strange," Lyra snorted. "Let's get out of here. Between McKinnon and Bones I don't want to see another guy until Monday."</p><p>"Here here," Dorcas grinned, jogging backwards in front of her, "Monday, when you kick all their asses! Girl power!"</p><p>Lyra snorted. "I really hate your optimism sometimes, Dorcas."</p>
<hr/><p>Lyra had spent a lot of her life dealing with things one day at a time, and Phase One was certainly no exception. Each day she woke up with bruises in places she couldn't see and fought to get enough food down to give her the energy to get through the gruelling training programme. It didn't help that McKinnon seemed to be the most inconsistent instructor: some days he was lovely and almost friendly, other days he looked like he'd been hit by the Night Bus and had an attitude to match. It was exhausting and a little concerning and she was getting sick of having to tiptoe around him. Mostly she got through on pure rage, Dorcas' never wavering support and pleasure at imagining a million different ways she was going to beat McKinnon up once she passed the training.</p><p>Matters escalated in week three, once a few of the others had clocked just who she was related to. Edgar Bones had slammed a Ministry issued wanted poster in front of her one evening as her and Dorcas sat around one of the small tables in the corner of the rec room.</p><p>"Who is this?" Emma Vanity snapped from just behind Edgar, fists clenched.</p><p>Lyra looked up from her book and blinked slowly, reading the poster and paling slightly.</p><p>"Bellatrix Lestrange," Lyra said quietly, feeling Dorcas' concerned eyes on her from across the table.</p><p>"And who is she?" Emma snapped.</p><p>Lyra didn't reply.</p><p>"Who. Is. She?"</p><p>"My cousin," Lyra answered, voice even quieter now, barely above a whisper.</p><p>"Your cousin," she hissed, leaning down and jabbing a finger towards the picture. "I knew you looked familiar."</p><p>"What do you want me to say?" Lyra asked, glancing up at the furious girl.</p><p>"Nothing! Don't say anything, you bitch!"</p><p>Edgar put his hand on Emma's shoulder and straightened up. "What is a baby Death Eater doing at Auror training?"</p><p>Dorcas paled, her warm brown eyes darting worriedly between Edgar and Lyra, who looked like she was about to faint. "Guys…"</p><p>"I'm not a Death Eater," Lyra said firmly.</p><p>"Show us your arm!" Emma snapped.</p><p>Dorcas laughed nervously. "Come on. This is insane!" She hadn't pried into Lyra's life just as she'd requested but she knew that she wasn't bad, it was obvious to see to anyone with common sense.</p><p>"If she's not a Death Eater she should have no problem showing us her arm," Edgar said, voice level. Somehow, he made it seem like a perfectly reasonable request.</p><p>"I don't have to prove anything to you," Lyra retorted, shrugging. "I am not my cousin."</p><p>"You shouldn't be here," Davey Gudgeon said, speaking for the first time and not daring to meet Lyra's eye. "We know you're not old enough, and your family are all Dark Wizards, so how are you here?"</p><p>Lyra swallowed and pushed the poster away, glancing to her side and seeing that Dorcas had vanished. She felt a hollow stab of betrayal. "I applied and I got accepted, the same as you."</p><p>"Bullshit," Emma spat, stepping closer. "Either Daddy paid your way in, or you fucked someone, or you're here so they can keep an eye on you. What would you be doing at home? Torturing Muggleborns or marrying some rich Pureblood and popping out even more Blood Purists?"</p><p>"What the fuck have I ever done to you?!" Lyra finally snapped, grabbing her things up and side stepping around the trio. "Seriously? I've never even spoken to you!"</p><p>"Your cousin tortured and murdered Dave's aunt and her children and left their bodies hanging under the Dark Mark," Emma laughed coldly, "You don't belong here."</p><p>Shaking her head, Lyra held her hands up. "Davey, I'm sorry, that's… awful, I don't know what to say. But that wasn't <em>me</em>!"</p><p>"Black, don't kid yourself," Edgar said coolly, "You're no good, you'll be sent home in eight weeks anyway, so why not just leave now and go back to sucking Daddy off or something. Surely you've got some fancy wedding to plan? Your lot have spent years casting anyone out who wasn't 'pure' enough, now it's our turn."</p><p>Lyra wanted to scream – she couldn't win, could she? At home she was too close to the 'wrong side' of the war and here she was too. She could feel the tears burning in her eyes, but she refused to let them see it. Snatching up the poster, she screwed it up and thrust it at Edgar's chest, narrowing her eyes. "Would you just leave me the fuck alone? I've done nothing! What the fuck is wrong with you?"</p><p>"I've been asking myself the same thing," called a cold voice from the other side of the room.</p><p>Edgar, Emma and Davey turned quickly, and Emma took a timid step backwards.</p><p>"Auror McK-"</p><p>"No, go on, Bones, please continue," Mason said with false brightness, "I believe you were at the bit where you mentioned incest and arranged marriages, so I'm assuming something about her appearance or her sex life was next? Just a guess though!"</p><p>"I-I wasn't going to-"</p><p>"Oh you <em>weren't</em>? You were done? I arrived in time to hear the end then!" he said sweetly. "Lucky me!"</p><p>Lyra flushed red but kept watching Edgar with anger-darkened eyes. Mason noticed and jerked his head towards the door. "Get out. All of you. I don't want to see any of you until tomorrow. You're lucky I'm not reporting this to Auror Moody but don't think I'll forget."</p><p>Everyone in the rec room started filing out not just the three involved, an awkward silence filling the space where before there had been casual conversations and the sound of the radio. Lyra shouldered her bag and tried to slip out with Dorcas but Mason caught her sleeve gently and tugged her back.</p><p>"Not you, Black."</p><p>She groaned and closed her eyes, tipping her head back. "Fine."</p><p>Dorcas gave her hand a reassuring squeeze, nodded at Mason quickly and vanished around the corner too. Once the room was empty except for the two of them, Lyra sat down heavily on one of the sofas and crossed her legs, fiddling with the strap of her bag.</p><p>"What the hell did I walk in to?" Mason asked, voice far too calm to actually be calm.</p><p>"I don't know! Why are you asking <em>me</em> this?!" she snapped.</p><p>"Because I want to hear it from you before I talk to them."</p><p>"Well I don't want to tell you. Just forget it, okay? It's not a big deal, and the fact that you had to come and intervene just makes it look even worse!" Lyra muttered. "It's not like it's not warranted. I've been waiting for someone to put two and two together."</p><p>"So you are a Death Eater, you did sleep with someone to get accepted and you are going back home to plan your Pureblood fantasy wedding?" he said bluntly.</p><p>She flinched. "We both know you don't like me, so can you just stop the interrogation and let me go?"</p><p>His expression softened. "Look, I'm sorry I got involved, I know that might not have helped. Dorcas ran and fetched me when she saw it getting dirty, and you shouldn't have to deal with it. I'd help even if it wasn't my job, I don't dislike you, Lyra."</p><p>"That's news to me. You've been a dick to me pretty regularly." Lyra looked up and met his gaze suddenly. "I know you know my brother. I know you know that he left home," she said, failing to keep all of the bitterness out of her voice. "Other people know he did too. So when they look at me and see a mini-Bellatrix and see I was in Slytherin, see that I'm living at home, see that I don't talk to… to Sirius," she said, stumbling over his name, "What are they supposed to assume?"</p><p>He sighed and leaned against the table, watching her thoughtfully. "Well they shouldn't assume any of that, that's for sure. And I dunno if it's just that picture or not, I've never had the pleasure of meeting your cousin, but you're far nicer to look at. And me being a dick isn't personal, I'm sorry it's come across that way. I've got… a lot on my shoulders at the minute. I'm not dealing with it too well."</p><p>She laughed nervously and tugged on the end of her ponytail. "Thanks, I guess. For the compliment and the apology."</p><p>"You know, Moody showed me your file?"</p><p>Lyra stiffened, letting her hand drop from her hair to grip her other hand reflexively, her back straightening.</p><p>"He's asked me to make sure we get you up to the right level for now. Apparently you're going to ace the magical section," Mason shrugged. "I didn't read much more, but I'm not going to let you fail, you understand me? I think you're talented, just maybe not at sit ups. Okay?"</p><p>She licked her lips and bobbed her head. "Okay."</p><p>"And it's not exactly secret knowledge but the gym is open all day every day, I'm sure Dorcas would help you out, or you can come and find me."</p><p>"I'm not going to encourage rumours I'm sleeping with someone for my spot here," Lyra warned. "Private tutoring would absolutely do that."</p><p>"Touché," Mason chuckled, folding his arms across his chest. "But the offer still stands. Eat more protein and keep practising. You've got two months."</p><p>She offered him a small grateful smile and nodded.</p><p>"Do you want me to speak to the others?"</p><p>"No, please don't. It'd hardly make a difference to how they see me, and it might just make it worse," she muttered.</p><p>Mason grumbled under his breath. "Fine. But if it happens again, tell me anyway?"</p><p>"Sure," she said tiredly, "Can I go now?"</p><p>He sighed, but nodded. "I'll see you bright and early tomorrow."</p><p>"Don't remind me," she laughed slightly, brushing past him. "Night."</p><p>Mason silently watched her go, rubbing his eyes once her slender form vanished from view. "Night, Lyra."</p>
