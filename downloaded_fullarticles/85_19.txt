    <p>Dear Readers, </p><p>What a summer it has been, on top of many moons of sites coming down, moderators having other things to do, etc.!</p><p>My apologies for not posting.  Some stories, like Vitae Explicare Momento, I am posting as I write.  The next chapter of that is half-done.  Some stories have many finished chapters, like To Conquer Her/To Claim Him.  However, I'm terrible with administration, and honestly, I pull chapters from Dramione.org when I know the next chapter on my laptop isn't the best version since I maybe did edits in email at my job when I had a spare minute.  Thus, when Dramione.org went down, so did a lot of my good copy!</p><p>BUT IT'S BACK!  And I am, too, as much as someone can be who relies on public transit, works two jobs, has two half-grown kittens, is looking to move, etc. can be.  Work/Life/Fandom balance is going to be my focus in the days ahead.  I'm plotting out times that are good to write, and my muse and beta is still with me, so...</p><p>Fear not!  I may hold on loosely to the fandom, but I won't let go.  I hope you feel the same.  We're just back at square 0 again.</p><p>Feel free to comment on this post if you have any thoughts or idle plot bunnies you want to leave.  I'll do my best to keep up with them, and the muse responds well to batted eyelashes and sweeties.  She's fickle though, so even if everyone is dying for Triur, which is undergoing a major rehab/reconstruction, for example, we'll do our best but...</p><p>Take care, lovelies.</p><p>I'll see you soon.</p>
