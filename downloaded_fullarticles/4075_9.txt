Remus and Sirius pull back, Sirius looking irritated, Remus bashful.</p><p>Sirius decides it’s time he get James home, he’d drunk half of everything they had and was currently talking to Peter about Peter and telling him not to tell Peter how he used to be jealous of Peter's ability to talk to just anyone and hold a conversation and never offend the other person.  Peter shakes his head in fondness and decides to help Sirius with James.</p><p> </p><p>After they leave James with Lily, the two head towards the gate of Godric's Hollow.</p><p>“Hey Sirius...I um...” Sirius looks at him questioningly, “Is something happening between you and Remus?” Sirius clears his throat, flushing slightly.</p><p>“Um no, no, of course not.  Why?”</p><p>“I just...I have a bad...I mean...”</p><p>“What is it Pete?” Peter bites at his lip, looking increasingly uncomfortable</p><p> </p><p>“All the times he disappears and he’s been so weird lately and moving around all the time...”</p><p>“Where are you going with this Pete?” Peter sighs.</p><p>“You know where I’m going.  I...I think it’s occurred to you too.  I mean James...he wouldn’t understand, you know he wouldn’t.  And Lily is so protective of him...I’ve been spending so much time with him trying to keep an eye on him...I think he’s the spy.” Sirius frowns.</p><p>“Peter this is Moony we are talking about!” Peter sighs, nodding and looking at the ground.  He shuffles for a moment before he looks back up.</p><p>“Just think about it, Yeah?” Peter claps Sirius on the back, “Goodnight.”  Peter leaves Sirius by the gate.  He looks at a pregnant Lily who is herding a drunken deer in the Lounge room.  Sirius frowns.  He can't risk the three of them.  Not even for Remus.  If there’s even a chance...no, he can’t risk it.</p><p>Sirius walks back into the house to help Lily with the drunken stag, promising himself he'd watch Remus closely.  Not because he doesn’t trust him but just in case.</p><p>Just in case.</p><p><em>‘Besides, that Jess warrants keeping an eye on as well,’ </em>Sirius thinks to himself.</p></div>
