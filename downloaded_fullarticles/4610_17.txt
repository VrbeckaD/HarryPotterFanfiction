    <p>Leonard Snart; the eldest child and only son of Lewis Snart, elder brother of Lisa Snart by three years, lifelong friend of pureblood Mick Rory, a pureblood wizard, and now a first year Hogwarts student. This was a day Leonard was both excited for and dreading at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>It was the first year he would get to spend away from home for most of the year which was good considering what his father was like. But it was also the first year his sister would spend alone with the man and the year he would be sorted. Everyone in his family has been a Slytherin practically since the school’s founding and if he weren’t sorted into the house his father would be furious and he didn’t even want to think about how his father would react if he were sorted into Gryffindor.</p><p> </p><p>“Good luck Lenny,” Lisa told her brother while hugging him as she and their father saw him off at Platform 9¾.</p><p>“Thanks Lise. I’ll miss you,” he smiled sadly as he hugged her tightly not wanting to let her go.</p><p>“Ahem,” their father interrupted causing Leonard to release his sister as he turned to face the man beside him.</p><p>“Father,” Leonard said with a nod.</p><p>“Leonard,” Lewis said with a nod in return.</p><p>“Do not disappoint me, boy,” he sneered.</p><p> </p><p>Leonard then grabbed his belongings and turned to board the train almost getting there when he was suddenly barreled into by a blonde girl as she rushed to get on board.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry! Sorry. My bad,” she said as she gathered up her things that had fallen from the crash.</p><p>“No, it’s okay,” Leonard argued.</p><p>“Hey!” Lewis shouted as he marched up to them.</p><p>“You should watch where you’re going next time little girl,” he sneered at the young blonde.</p><p>“No,” she said firmly much to Leonard’s dismay as he knew she was only asking for trouble.</p><p>“No?” Lewis asked menacingly.</p><p>“No. You should watch your mouth and not speak so rudely to children. I’m only eleven you know,” the girl said as she told him off.</p><p>“Hmm. You’re a Gryffindor if I ever saw one. They don’t have any manners either,” Lewis sneered at her before turning back to his son.</p><p>“Be careful around this one, boy, she’s nothing but trouble,” he told Leonard.</p><p>“Yes father,” Leonard nodded as he finished gathering up his items including his very flexible wand of 13-inch reed wood and a unicorn hair core.</p><p>“That’s your father?” the girl asked him.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You have my condolences. Sara Lance. Nice to meet you,” the girl said reaching out a hand.</p><p> </p><p>He refused her hand and turned to board the train without saying a word to her. Something he regretted doing but had no choice as he knew his father would be cross if he spoke to her. As the train started to move Leonard found himself a seat in one of the compartments of the train where he was soon confronted by Sara.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! I know your father’s a jerk but that doesn’t mean you have to be such a-” she started screaming at him.</p><p>“I know. I know I’m sorry. Hi, my name is Leonard. Leonard Snart,” he interrupted with an extended hand.</p><p>“And why couldn’t you have just said that before?” she asked with crossed arms.</p><p>“My father was watching. He would have been furious with me for talking to you. You haven’t seen him at his worst. What’s scarier is neither have I. He’s not a man you want to cross.”</p><p>“How do you know you haven’t seen him at his worst?”</p><p>“I’m still alive. You can sit down if you want,” he said gesturing to the seats.</p><p> </p><p>She sat down unsure of what to say after his bold statement of still being alive because he hasn’t seen his father at his worst. They were shortly joined in the compartment by Leonard’s friend Mick who was carrying an assortment of goodies from the trolley.</p><p> </p><p>“Who’s the witch?” Mick asked with a mouth full of sweets making it hard to tell if he said witch or bitch.</p><p>“What did he just call me?” she asked with an eyebrow raised.</p><p>“He said witch. Sara this is my friend Mick. Mick this is Sara,” Leonard said gesturing between the two of them.</p><p>“Pleasure,” Mick smiled at her.</p><p>“Cauldron cake?” he offered to the two of them.</p><p>“No thanks,” Leonard and Sara said in unison.</p><p>“Suit yourselves,” Mick replied as he took a seat beside Leonard.</p><p>“So blondie what family you from?”</p><p>“Excuse me?” she asked.</p><p>“She’s not from one of the pureblood families,” Leonard answered for her.</p><p>“Seriously?” Mick questioned.</p><p>“I’m sorry. What’s a pureblood?” she asked.</p><p>“Holy crap she’s a mudblood. Why the hell are you sitting with a mudblood? You know your father’s going to be pissed when he hears about this.”</p><p>“Which is why he’s not going to hear about this, Mick.”</p><p>“Hey guys care to fill me in on what pureblood and mudblood mean?”</p><p>“Purebloods are witches and wizards whose family lines are comprised solely of wizards such as my family and Mick’s. Mudblood is a crude term for those who are muggle born or rather those not born of any magical parents.”</p><p>“Oh so Mick just insulted me is that it?”</p><p>“Nah. Just mudblood’s faster to say than muggle born.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” she said in a tone that conveyed how little she believed him.</p><p>“So uh what was that your dad said about me being a Gryffindor earlier?” she asked Leonard.</p><p>“Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff; the four houses of Hogwarts. Gryffindors, which my father loathes are considered to be brave and have a lot of nerve. And quite frankly with the way you stood up to him I’d have to agree. Definitely going to be sorted into Gryffindor.”</p><p>“You and I are going to be in Slytherin though. Guarantee it,” Mick said as he stuffed his face some more.</p><p>“What’s special about Slytherin?”</p><p>“They’re said to be the kind of people who are ambitious and self-serving and would gladly stab someone in the back if it helped them achieve their goals,” Leonard explained to her.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Well that’s the reputation anyway. My family’s been Slytherin since practically the school was founded. Only reason I’m hoping to get in that house is so my dad won’t be furious with me for not getting in. Although to be honest as long as it’s not Gryffindor I get sorted into I should be fine.”</p><p>“You really hate disappointing your dad, don’t you?” she asked.</p><p> “It’s not the disappointing him I don’t like, it’s the punishments he dishes out when I do that sucks.”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I can’t imagine what that’s like,” she said placing a hand on his knee.</p><p> </p><p>There was suddenly a knock on the compartment door.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi. My name’s Ray. Ray Palmer. First year. I was just coming around to all the compartments to say hi and get to know my new classmates. So how are you guys doing?” Ray asked the three of them.</p><p>“Hufflepuff,” Leonard and Mick said in unison as they turned to each other.</p><p>“What?” Sara asked.</p><p>“Never mind,” Leonard replied rolling his eyes.</p><p>“Hufflepuff huh? I always thought I was more of a Ravenclaw to be honest. Oh well. See you guys later,” Ray shrugged before heading off to the next compartment.</p><p>“If he’s what we’re going to be dealing with it’s going to be a looong year,” Mick sighed.</p><p>“Long and interesting,” Sara added as she grabbed one of Mick’s snacks.</p><p>“Here, here,” Mick agreed.</p><p> </p><p><em>Well</em>, Leonard thought, <em>Sara did have one thing right. This was sure to be an interesting year.</em></p>
