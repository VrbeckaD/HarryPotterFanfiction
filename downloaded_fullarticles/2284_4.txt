    <p align="left"><u>Hogwarts March 1967</u>,</p>
<p align="left">Bellatrix Black walks through the corridors of the school for witchcraft and wizardry. She glanced at everyone who passes her. She hates a lot of them especially the conceited and gossiping girls like Rita Skeeter. Most people at school think that Bellatrix is also one of them but that’s just gossip coming from Rita. Bellatrix is actually a very eager student and spends most of her time for homework or other school related stuff. Because of that she barley has any friends, so Rita made up that she thinks she is too good for everyone. Everyone is believing Rita, so of course no one wants to talk to Bellatrix on their own accord, only if they must.<br/> As she passed Rita and her friends, she gave them the sourest look she could manage, which only caused them to giggle and Rita said in a sarcastic tone „oooh, better watch out for Bellatrix girls„ and her friends laughed even more.<br/> Bellatrix now stomped angry to her dormitory, she absolutely hated Rita and sometimes she would like to curse her, but that would only get her detention or being expelled and that wasn’t worth it.<br/> Once in her dormitory she packed her suitcase for the Easter holidays which she’s going to spend with her family. In all honesty she would rather stay at school and read in the library because every time her family were together on a big event such as Easter or Christmas, it would always end in a complete disaster. So, she wasn’t looking forward to this at all, but her mother insisted that she comes home.</p>

<p align="left">As she walked through the train to find her sisters, she heard a small group of Slytherin boys talking in hushed voices. Bellatrix wanted to know what they could talk about, that no one else should hear. She tried to eavesdrop, but she only heard small parts of what was being said. Something about a Lord who’s going to rescue the wizarding society. She tried to listen some more, but the boys seemed to stop talking. Bellatrix wanted to continue her search as she bumped into someone.<br/> “OUCH! Watch where you´re going-oh” Bellatrix said as she noticed her younger sister Andromeda.<br/> “What have you been doing, I was looking everywhere for you!” Andromeda snapped at her sister<br/> “funny because I was looking for you everywhere” she answered but Andromeda only rolled her eyes and turned around to go to where Narcissa was waiting. Bellatrix followed her silently. Once in their compartment Narcissa immediately started to interrogate her eldest sister</p>
<p align="left">“where have you been so long, we’re already half an hour on the way! I thought you decided to stay in school instead of coming home with us!” even though Narcissa is four years younger than Bellatrix, she behaved as if she was the eldest and Bellatrix the youngest. “I was on my way to you as I heard some kind of interesting stuff.” She explained “what kind of interesting stuff?” Narcissa wanted to know from Bellatrix all previous worry and anger gone. “well I heard some boys talking about a Lord of some kind who is going to rescue the wizarding society” she told them somewhat excited.<br/> “what do you think that means, rescuing the wizarding society?” Narcissa asked “I don’t know but I think they meant that he’s going to get rid of all that muggleborn filth!” Bellatrix said seriously and Andromeda only rolled her eyes, for she found all that pureblood supremacy straight up stupid.<br/> The rest of the ride was quiet, and Bellatrix was just thinking about finding out more about this lord.</p>
