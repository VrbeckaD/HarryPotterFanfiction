    <p>Hadrian's twelfth birthday was coming up, and Mrs Weasley had asked who he wanted to invite to his party. He had never had a birthday party before. He didn't know who he was allowed to ask. This was the sort of question he would normally ask Professor Snape. Or Neville. But neither one was writing to him.</p><p>Nobody was writing to him.</p><p>Had they heard? Were they all angry at him? He would understand the Slytherins being angry at him, but Neville and Hermione too? Without even talking to him first?</p><p>He was currently reading a book out in the orchard, where the twins, Ron, and Ginny were playing two a side Quidditch, with the twins split between the teams. Ginny wasn't supposed to be on a broom, but as far as Hadrian could see, she was as good as Ron, which left the teams fairly evenly matched. It didn't interest him enough to distract him from his worries though. </p><p>"Come fly with us, Hadrian!" one of the twins yelled. It was probably Fred, based on the broom he was on, but they were known to swap up their favourite brooms as a Quidditch tactic.</p><p>"Still grounded," Hadrian shouted back. He wasn't about to learn to fly under the tutelage of the Weasley twins, no matter how much he liked them. He longed to fly, but he'd been banned from flying last year due to his poor health. Madam Pomphrey was confident he could start this autumn with the first years, after spending a year taking ghastly potions, but he'd feel a lot safer on the Hogwarts pitch with a proper instructor and a mediwitch on call, rather than out in the orchard behind the Burrow.</p><p>"Cowardly snake," Ron muttered, loudly enough to be heard, but soft enough to deny he'd said it. </p><p>"You take that back! Harry isn't a coward!" Ginny shrieked.</p><p>"Ginny, it doesn't matter," Hadrian called back. "Just play your game." He picked up his book and headed out, away from the orchard, away from the Burrow. Just away. </p><p>Other than Ron's hostility and Ginny's fangirl attitude, there was nothing wrong with the Weasleys. They were just so... <em>exhausting</em>.</p><p>He'd made Ginny cry the first day by telling him that none of the Harry Potter Adventures novels were true - that he'd spent the first eleven years of his life in the muggle world, and he'd done nothing more adventurous there than occasional accidental magic. But he'd relented and autographed one of her books for her (<em>To Ginny - Anyone can be a hero - H.Potter</em>) which had made it up to her, and won Mrs Weasley's favour as well. Especially when he told her it was the only book he'd ever autographed.</p><p>The family matriarch was also fond of him for doing whatever chores he was assigned without complaining or trying to skive off. Honestly, Hadrian thought the Weasley children made more work for themselves in how hard they tried to get out of work. If they'd just peel the potatoes or feed the chickens or whatever when they were first asked, then they could go and do their own thing. Instead, they kvetched and moaned and sneaked around. And they were rarely successful, for Mrs Weasley knew all of their tricks.</p><p>Hadrian had already been friends with Fred and George Weasley during the school year, when they were hired to tutor the first year multi-House study group in potions. As tutors, they were serious and competent. Once free for the summer, Hadrian was seeing a different side of them. Pranks, jokes, and insults to their siblings were the order of the day - though Hadrian noticed that they tended to jump in and accept the blame for anything that upset the volatile Mrs Weasley, even if it had nothing to do with them. Already this summer, a broken pot of floo powder (caused by Ginny) and a dead chicken (caused by Ron) were blamed on the twins, and they never spoke up in their own defence. When Hadrian started to, George stepped on his foot. </p><p>"It's kind of our thing," George told Hadrian later. "To make up for all the pranks we subject them to."</p><p>"And because Mum would probably not be nearly so unhinged about little things if it wasn't for us," Fred said.</p><p>"Floo powder is cheap. Ridiculously cheap."</p><p>"And it wasn't like Ron meant to kill the chicken."</p><p>That had been gross. Cleaning the chicken coop was bad enough - it had to be done by manual labour, but when that one stupid chicken had run back in and gotten hit by Ron's shovel - Hadrian still shuddered to think of it. And even more to think of how awful <em>plucking</em> had been. Because after all, the Weasleys had lost an egg layer, but the meat was still good. (Actually <em>quite </em>good, once made into chicken pie and the bones cooked into broth, Hadrian had to acknowledge.)</p><p>"But Mum's always expecting the Burrow to burn down because of us."</p><p>"To be fair, if it ever does burn down, it will probably be because of us."</p><p>"So if she's a little rough on the younger kids, we try to make it up to them."</p><p>Of all of the Weasleys, Hadrian found it most interesting to talk to Percy, who he was convinced was a mis-sorted Ravenclaw. He was a bit pompous, but he was also very smart. He was able to help Hadrian keep up with his Latin and French, and he had looked over Hadrian's homework for him (both of them had long since finished their homework - the three younger boys hadn't started, as far as Hadrian could tell). Percy had a lot of books, mostly purchased secondhand, that he was willing to lend to Hadrian once he realised that the younger boy wouldn't mistreat his volumes. And Hadrian could tell that the prefect was pleased to have someone in the house who didn't poke fun at him for being academic and serious.</p><p>Finally there was Mr Weasley, who kept excitedly asking questions about muggles, but seemed to think of them as cute animals who could do clever tricks rather than actual humans. Hadrian had thought his Muggle Protection Act might have some help for him, but when he looked it over, with Percy's assistance, it was so vile that he found it difficult to spend time around Mr Weasley after that.</p><hr/><p>After leaving the orchard, kept walking, down a hill and towards a shallow riverbed that he hadn't explored before, as Hedwig flew on ahead. Then suddenly he was surprised by the sound of splashes. He found a somewhat bedraggled young girl with long tangled blonde hair playing in the rocks along the river. To his surprise, Hedwig flew in a low circle around her and chattered in a friendly manner. The girl spun around, fell in the water, and splashed up again without a moment's hesitation. She pointed at Hadrian and squealed, "I know you!"</p><p>Hadrian's heart sank. Another fan of the Boy-Who-Lived...</p><p>"You're Crowned-With-Night!" she finished excitedly.</p><p>"Er... what?"</p><p>"That's your name, right? That's what White Death calls you," she said. She climbed back onto the rocks and put her arm out, and Hedwig landed and began grooming her hair.</p><p>"You know my owl?" Harry said. </p><p>"She's the most beautiful owl I've ever met," the girl said. Hedwig preened as if to say <em>Of course I am!</em></p><p>Hadrian grinned. "She is, isn't she? What's your name?"</p><p>"Luna. Luna Lovegood. Some people call me Loony Lovegood."</p><p>Hadrian's smile faded. She had said that as if... </p><p>... as if words didn't hurt.</p><p>"What do <em>you </em>want to be called?" he asked.</p><p>Her face brightened. "Oh! Nobody's ever asked me that before! I want to be called Luna-bell! That's what my Mum called me before she died."</p><p>"My Mum is dead too," Hadrian said. </p><p>"That's what White Death said. She said you didn't have any parents and that you're unhappy in your current nest, and she's angry because of the broonie that's been bothering her," Luna said.</p><p>"Wait, what? What's a broonie?" Hadrian asked. He kicked off his shoes and clambered down the bank. It was a hot summer day - the perfect day to wade in the water. </p><p>Luna-bell was giving Hedwig scratches exactly where she liked them best, just behind her wings. "They're little creatures that look like small people with big ears and noses that can't wear clothes. They have great powers that they can use to be helpful or to cause mischief. I don't know why there's one after White Death, but you can give her a talisman to protect her."</p><p>"Do you mean house-elves?" Hadrian asked, sitting down with her.</p><p>"No, it's definitely a broonie," she said with authority. "If it was a house-elf, it couldn't bother a post-owl."</p><p>"Where would I get a talisman, Luna-bell? Diagon Alley?"</p><p>"No, Crowned-With-Night. You have to find it yourself or it won't work."</p><p>"Er... you can call me Hadrian. That's what... human people call me," he said. "Well some people call me Harry. But I prefer Hadrian."</p><p>She tilted her head so far that she looked like an owl. "Really? Harry doesn't suit you at all. You'll need a hag stone. They look like this." She pulled out a cord from around her neck to let Hadrian see the pebble on it, with a natural hole eroded through it. </p><p>Hadrian took it from her hand, and felt it tingle. "What is it? It's magic, right?"</p><p>"It's a hag stone. If you can find one on your own, it will protect White Death from the broonie. If you can't find one, she can borrow mine, but it won't work as well as one you find yourself. I'll show you where my Mum used to take me to search. It's by the bridge."</p><p>They waded up along the river until they found Luna-bell's spot, which wasn't a 'bridge' as Hadrian considered it, but a line of carefully arranged stepping stones that would be an easy step for an adult, or a leap for a child's span. Of course the two of them were already in the water, so it hardly mattered. </p><p>"How long ago did your Mum die?" Hadrian asked.</p><p>"When I was nine. She was experimenting. She used to invent spells, but that can be dangerous. I miss her a lot. Maybe it won't be so bad when I go to Hogwarts in September. I get so lonely without her." Luna-bell said.</p><p>"Do you have a father?" Hadrian asked.</p><p>"Yes, but Daddy's hardly ever home. I just hope he comes back in time to get my school supplies and to take me to the train station. He promised he would, but, he sometimes forgets me," she said, sitting on one of the stones and splashing her feet. She wasn't joining in Hadrian's search, in case she was the one who found the only hag stone in the vicinity.</p><p>"Er... Luna-bell? Where is your father?"</p><p>She tilted her head. "I'm not sure. I think maybe Ireland, but it could be Iceland. His note wasn't very clear," she said. "You should look upstream of the mossy stone."</p><p>Hadrian wasn't looking for a hag stone any longer. "Are you home all alone? With no one to take care of you?"</p><p>"White Death checks on me every day," Luna-bell said vaguely.</p><p>Hadrian had no idea if this was normal in the magical world, to leave an eleven year old girl home alone, for potentially months? He didn't think so. An underage child was more helpless in a magical household than a muggle one. The Weasleys were dependant on magic for hot water and refrigeration. He had thought Luna-bell was unkempt because she'd been playing in the river, but what if she'd simply had no way to get a hot bath or clean clothes?</p><p>"I think you should come home with me, Luna-bell," he said. "Mrs Weasley will want to make sure you're eating, and she can make sure you get you to Hogwarts okay."</p><p>"But what about your hag stone?" she said.</p><p>"We can come back and look for it tomorrow," Hadrian said firmly. "You are more important, Luna-bell of the River Stones."</p><p>She looked at him with her guileless eyes and mouth open in astonishment. "You gave me a name! Not even White Death gave me a name!"</p><p>"Do you like it?" Hadrian asked, a little nervously.</p><p>She smiled luminously. "I do! I do! Maybe that means we can be friends!"</p><p>Hadrian clambered out of the river and took her by the hand. "I think it does, Luna-bell of the River Stones."</p><p> </p>
