    <p>Her letters were left unanswered.</p><p>            It had been a mistake to hope, Hermione thought to herself. To hope that he would listen. Or care.</p><p>            Still, sighing, a dark pit of sadness in her chest, she read his note, once, twice, a third time, desperately attempting and regretfully failing to figure out the equation that was Draco Malfoy’s mind.</p><p>            <em>I’ll write, if you will.</em></p><p>
  <em>Yours,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>D.M.</em>
</p><p>            Maybe it had been a mistake — that kiss.</p><p>            She remembered it all too well, however, the grey eyes and the strong jaw and the hesitance and the last remaining bits of sunlight streaming in through the balcony of the Astronomy Tower.</p><p>            The day the war ended.</p><p>            She remembered climbing those stairs, exhausted, hurt, dry tears still clinging to her cheeks as she attempted to escape the chaos that had descended her school. Hermione wanted nothing more than to see the sky, and ease her mind, for just a moment.</p><p>            She’d found him even though she hadn’t been looking for him. Standing in that balcony, hands in his pockets, a deadly calm hovering above him like rain clouds, even if the sun was shining.</p><p>            Hermione remembered their conversation.</p><p>            The bickering.</p><p>            Then their kiss.</p><p>            Maybe they’d both been helpless and desperate for reassurance after that day. Maybe it had been the product of their shattered souls searching for a way to be put back together.</p><p>            Hermione could not blame herself for trying to reach out and help him. Regardless of her tumultuous, confusing feelings, it was still the right thing to do.</p><p>            But she received no answer.</p><p>            And she doubted she would.</p><p>            Her unfinished third letter was half crumpled in her desk. Downstairs, she could hear Mrs. Weasley calling for breakfast. The sun was rising.</p><p>            Hermione hadn’t slept again.</p><p>            If only Draco Malfoy was her only worry. There were days when she felt the walls caving in around her, and claws digging deep into her chest – the ache of losing her friends and her family still too present in her mind.</p><p>After a summer in the Weasley’s home, despite the comfort they offered, despite the happiness they gave her, there was still an emptiness inside her that Hermione would not, could not, fill. She was good at keeping herself busy: diving back into her studies, practising her wandless magic in the Weasley’s backyard, reading, reading, more reading, jumping into worlds, words and minds so different from her own, never keeping still, because if she kept still her mind became too loud, and when it got too loud she would often lose herself in-</p><p>Hermione jumped out her chair, instinct driving her to grab for her wand. The ink spilled over the wood, over her trousers, and before she could form a spell on her lips, she saw Ron’s wide eyes staring at her from across her room, the door half-opened.</p><p>“Ronald!” She cried out, her voice sounding shrill even to her own ears. “I told you to please stop… <em>barging</em> in.”</p><p>Ron stared at her for a couple of seconds, and Hermione swallowed down hard, her heart jumping out of her chest.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he breathed softly.</p><p>“I…” she shook her head. “No, I’m sorry. You just frightened me.”</p><p>“Mom’s calling for breakfast.”</p><p>“Yes, I’ll be right down.”</p><p>Ron hesitated, lost words hanging between them like a loose, broken chain. “Hermione…”</p><p>“I’ll be right down,” she repeated, turning away from him.</p><p>He closed the door, and Hermione sat back down, a trembling mess of a girl.</p><p>She pushed curls away from her eyes, carefully placing her wand in front of her, yet not completely away from her reach.</p><p>It had been difficult, in the first couple of weeks, to sleep without it.</p><p>And now, Ron…</p><p>She could sense his sadness like it was her own. The guilt was a firm hand squeezing at her throat, which was not rational, she knew. Hermione had nothing to be guilty of.</p><p>Her eyes trailed over the unfinished letter.</p><p>
  <em>I know you probably don’t wish to come back to Hogwarts, but I truly think</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s best if you face it, trust me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <strike>Tell me that day in the Astronomy Tower was real.</strike>
  </em>
</p><p>Hermione felt like a hypocrite reading back those unfinished sentences.</p><p>Who was she to tell Draco Malfoy to face his school, his peers, when she couldn’t face her best friend?</p><p>Hermione sighed, looked to the window, to the rising sun, painting the skies yellow.</p><p>            She knew what she had to do.</p><p>***</p><p>            Hogwarts was standing.</p><p>            Not many teachers had arrived, and so the empty halls were echoing her footsteps, dimply illuminated by candles and the stars and the moon. She remembered walking these very halls the day Voldemort died, making her way to the skies, so she could have a moment alone to think, to ask for peace. She remembered a broken column at her feet, her wordless spell twirling the rocks back into place. She remembered tasting ash in her bitter lips.</p><p>            Now, Hogwarts was just as it had been before it all.</p><p>            There were memories in every corner, in every curtain and tapestry. As she made her way to the Headmistress’ office, Hermione could not believe this was the last year she was going to get to walk these walls as a student.</p><p>            She could not believe she was there to walk in them at all.</p><p>            McGonagall was sitting at her desk, scribbling slowly. Half-moon glasses looked up at her as she entered, and a calm, knowing smile etched across her old professor’s lips.</p><p>            “Miss Granger, I was not expecting you at this hour.”</p><p>            “Apologies, Headmistress,” Hermione said. “I had errands to run in Diagon Alley, and thought I should stop by.”</p><p>            McGonagall placed down her feather, and gestured for Hermione to sit. As she did, Hermione could not help but look at Dumbledore’s portrait, sitting right behind McGonagall. He was sleeping, it seemed.</p><p>            McGonagall gave Hermione a knowing, yet seemingly tired smile. “He does that a lot.”</p><p>            Hermione smiled. She could not begin to understand the weight of this office, this position, in her old professor’s shoulders. McGonagall, despite everything, had taken the reins and turned this school back to what it used to be.</p><p>            “What is bothering you, Miss Granger?”</p><p>            Hermione hesitated, before saying: “I was wondering, Headmistress, if you knew anything about Draco Malfoy’s enrolment situation.”</p><p>            McGonagall only said, “No, Miss Granger, I must say I unfortunately do not. I know less than you.”</p><p>            Hermione paused. “Do you not think we should…insist?”</p><p>            McGonagall nodded slightly, a little pensively, and said, “The term begins in less than two weeks, Miss Granger. If Mr. Malfoy wished to enrol this year, I believe he would already have.”</p><p>            “But he’s afraid,” Hermione explained, inching forward. “He believe he will be judged by everyone-“</p><p>            “And he most certainly will, Miss Granger,” McGonagall said, matter-of-factly. “It is a dire situation, ours. The world has shifted immensely this summer, but the war remains fresh on everyone’s minds, you see. Prejudice lies in every corner. And while I admire your preoccupation with Mr. Malfoy, I must tell you that I have done everything in my power to reach him, and received no answer. We cannot force people’s hearts, Miss Granger, especially hearts that have strong convictions.”</p><p>            Hermione shook her head to herself, softly sighing. “I will try one more time, Headmistress. If he is allowed to come back, then I must.”</p><p>            “The law of imprisonment of the families involved with the Dark Lord during the war does not prohibit their offspring from finishing their education. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy may never leave their home, and they may never cast a spell or charm without the Ministry being notified, but that does not mean their son is condemned, Miss Granger,” McGonagall explained. “However, he is being watched. As unfortunate as that is, Mr. Malfoy is not without his crimes. And if he does come back to Hogwarts, I must warn you that the Ministry will have wide lens over the young man, and I will not be able to shield him from everything. Whether or not this will be good for him, I am not sure, Miss Granger.”</p><p>            “But what if it proves something to people?” Hermione insisted. “You know it, just as well as I do, that Draco Malfoy is not his mistakes. If people saw him as he truly is, the fear and the prejudice would succumb. I am sure it would.”</p><p>            McGonagall smiled just slightly. “I believe you, Miss Granger. And I want it to be true. I offer my protection as well as the protection of these walls, if you can convince Mr. Malfoy to return. But bear what I told you in mind when you speak to him. This world is ever changing, indeed, but there will be those willing to condemn every Slytherin in this school, but specially Mr. Malfoy. I reckon you understand why.”</p><p>            Hermione lowered her eyes, thinking back to the desperation in him. The sadness and bitterness and anger and trauma all bottled up in pools of grey-</p><p>            “Forgive me for asking, Miss Granger,” McGonagall began again, her eyes gaining new light, “but what has made you wish to protect Mr. Malfoy, despite it being the right thing to do? For I believe you not to be the best of friends growing up…”</p><p>            Hermione stared at those half-moons, attempting to find in herself the right words. “I… had a very enlightening conversation with Mr. Malfoy on the second of May, Headmistress. I found him to be quite burdened with what happened and specially with the role he was forced to play during the war.” The girl paused, and shrugged. “I feel as if I see part parts of myself in him now. What he is going through in the present is exactly what I felt when I first discovered I belonged in this world. I feel it is my duty to help.”</p><p>            McGonagall nodded, watching Hermione with affectionate, gentle eyes. “I admire you, Miss Granger. It is a very difficult thing to keep flowers blooming during harsh winters.”</p><p>            Hermione smiled at her old professor, lifting herself up. “Thank you, Professor.”</p><p>            But before Hermione could step out of the office, McGonagall said, “Hermione.”</p><p>            The girl turned to find her Professor staring at her with wise eyes. “When you speak to Mr. Malfoy, tell him he will be sharing the title of Head Student with you, if he does decide to return.”</p><p>            Hermione blinked, surprised. “Are you sure that is safe? I mean… I don’t think students will appreciate-“</p><p>            “It is like you said, Miss Granger. If you want the world to understand Mr. Malfoy, he has to be given the chance to prove himself. I am giving him that chance. And asking you to keep an eye on him in the process.”</p><p>            “Keep an eye on him,” Hermione repeated slowly, dread falling over her shoulders.</p><p>            McGonagall nodded once. “Mr. Malfoy’s magic will not be controlled by the Ministry in these walls, for it goes against the law, but, unfortunately, because of who he is, I have to take precautions. It is unfair, Miss Granger, I realize it. But after everything that happened, please understand that I cannot risk any danger falling over our school.”</p><p>            Hermione paused. “He wouldn’t…” She hesitated.</p><p>            Her professor nodded once. “My instincts also tell that he would not do anything to harm this school. What I am afraid of, Miss Granger, are the outside forces.”</p><p>            “His aunt is chained in Azkaban. There is no one to free her now. His parents-”</p><p>            “As I said,” McGonagall interrupted. “Precaution.”</p><p>            Hermione nodded mechanically, and said, “I will do my best.”</p><p>            ***</p><p>            Her hands shook.</p><p>            Hermione breathed in. She’d never seen the front of Malfoy Manor, she realized. She’d been dragged here, bloody and scarred, placed on a cell deep below, so far into the ground that no one could hear her screams.</p><p>            Now was not the time for trembling legs.</p><p>            She walked through the front gates, making sure her wand was still clutched tightly in her hand, but not in any way aimed to attack.</p><p>            Hermione must have been out of her mind to risk coming here. To evoke all those images-</p><p>            But she believed in her cause, and she believed in Draco Malfoy, and she believed she could help her school, and her world.</p><p>            She believed, and she hoped.</p><p>            That is why when the door of the Malfoy Manor opened, she stood firmly planted on the ground, her back straight, her chin raised high.</p><p>            <em>She’s not here. She’s not here.</em></p><p><em>            </em>Hermione looked down, and was faced with a house elf, looking absolutely out of his mind with rage.</p><p>            Her throat went dry.</p><p>            “What!?” The elf said.</p><p>            Hermione was speechless for a few seconds, her mind conjuring her friend, Dobby, who had been so mistreated at the hands of the Malfoys. Dobby, who must have suffered as much as this elf certainly had, if not more-</p><p>            She wanted to rage at this – house elves still being permitted to be slaves to wizards was absolutely, irrevocably-</p><p>            “What does you want?!” The creature shrieked. “What does you want, girl!?”</p><p>            Hermione flinched, but-</p><p>            One problem at a time.</p><p>            “May I speak to your…” she coughed, uncomfortable, “master?”</p><p>            “No! Master is not to be disturbed!”</p><p>            “Please,” Hermione said. “It’s a matter of the utmost urgency-“</p><p>            Footsteps sounded in the dark, long and narrow hallway. Hermione could only see a brief glance of white-blonde hair, before the door opened wide in an angry manner, and the elf was sent scurrying back inside with a shrill cry of fear.</p><p>            Hermione’s breath was stolen out of her chest.</p><p>            In front of her stood Narcisa Malfoy.</p><p> </p>
