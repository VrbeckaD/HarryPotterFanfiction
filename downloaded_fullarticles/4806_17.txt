    <p>
  <span>Nobody was surprised when Grindelwald escaped just one month after his capture. Disappointed, yes. Embarrassed, certainly. But very few could honestly claim to be shocked by the news.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Privately, Percival Graves had always considered the subject of his former-captor’s escape a matter of </span>
  <em>
    <span>when</span>
  </em>
  <span> and </span>
  <em>
    <span>how</span>
  </em>
  <span>, rather than </span>
  <em>
    <span>if</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a mindset which allowed him time to prepare a believable response to the report, when it came. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He maintained his calm, while also projecting an air of determination. He even managed to squeeze in a quip or two about getting his long-anticipated re-match with ‘that particular sack of troll-shit’. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Most importantly of all - he managed to hide the sheer terror that was clawing away at his insides like a rabid Sphinx. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To be honest, it had never really left him in the first place. Not after his escape, one year into his capture and 4 days after Grindelwald’s own. Not after being recovered (wounded and close to death in the snow) by Chicago aurors responding to reports or a ghostly dog running up and down the banks of Lake Michigan. Nor in the weeks that had followed as he struggled to recover, provide testimony about what had happened and how it had happened, weathered checks and questions that made his blood boil and skin crawl in equal measure - while trying to claw his life back together all at the same time. Never letting anyone see the state that it was actually in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps that’s how he’d managed it -practice. Perhaps it was simply a matter of nobody looking close enough to actually see it. It wouldn’t be the first time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bitterness licked at him, like a white hot flame forever seconds away from laying ruin to all that was left of his life if he let it ever truly take hold. He forced it out of mind before it could, locking it away in the ever growing pit of dark thoughts and feelings that seemed to be growing inside of him. It would serve no purpose. It would do no good.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina had been eyeing him strangely all day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Briefly, he feared that she’d seen through him after all - but it quickly became apparent that she was actually afraid he was going to do something foolish instead.  Like seeking Grindelwald out on his own. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a reasonable concern, he’d grant her that. But one with no actual merit. The</span>
  <b>
    <em> last</em>
  </b>
  <span> thing he ever wanted to do, was be in the same room as Gellert Grindelwald, after all. Being in the same building as him had been struggle enough, and that was when the son-of-a-banshee had been behind bars and clapped in chains. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, if such a scenario was a concern of hers, regardless of the additional attention she seemed to be paying him, then clearly his act was convincing enough after all. There ought to be some comfort to be found in that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ironically, he’d found himself fairly concerned about the exact same thing, but in reverse. Tina had always been headstrong, determined, reckless for all the right reasons. The thought of her going on a one-woman-crusade, bolstered by the chance victory she’d scored a month earlier, seemed terrifyingly plausible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So he made a point of walking her home that night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a child, Mr Graves,” she griped as they approached her block. “I can walk myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t doubt it,” he replied calmly. “But you played a big part in Grindelwald’s capture. He’s a very powerful, twisted man. I hardly think the buddy-system is an unreasonable precaution to take, Tina.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Besides,” he said. “I’m not being entirely selfless. I’ll personally rest a lot easier knowing that you got home safe and… yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina frowned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about you, sir?” she asked. “Surely you’re in more danger than any of us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She winced the second the words left her mouth and Percival felt the flames flare once more - at the reaction though, rather than the words themselves. She was afraid that she'd frightened him. Afraid that the mere mention of Grindelwald would, what, send him spiralling into a tizzy, see him wracked with panic right here in the street. Had he not managed to hold back such foolishness the whole day long?! Hell, the whole month that he’d been free?! Did people truly think him so weak? So easily broken?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No. That wasn’t it. He knew that wasn’t it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He screwed his eyes and drew in a quiet, calming breath. She was trying to be considerate, not implying weakness. He couldn’t bite her head off for that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a concentrated effort, he shot her a small, reassuring smile and shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think so,” he said. “I’m hardly of any use to him now, am I? The element of surprise was more or less destroyed when his little trick was revealed for the entire DMLE to see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...I suppose,” Tina said, as they came to a stop in front of a tall brownstone. She glanced up at it, and then back to him, with a small smile of her own.  “Well, this is me. I should be fine from here, Sir.” She paused, before adding, “You… you just take care of yourself, Mr Graves. Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival smiled politely and inclined his head as she walked away. He waited until she stepped through the door, then he waited a little while longer after that - watching her window above, waiting, he belatedly realised, for the flash of spellfire.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A wave of self-loathing washed over him when he found himself disappointed that it did not come.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d never intended to use Tina as bait. But now all seemed well, there was no denying that some part of him, a much larger part than he’d like to admit, had hoped that things would play out that way regardless. At least he’d have known where the bastard was. He’d have known and he’d have had the advantage this time. He’d have been able to get the jump on the other man. This time around, he’d have come out on top, beaten him, humiliated him--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blinked, stumbling to the side when his shoulder collided with another’s. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Watch where you’re going, jackass!!” a no-maj barked, glaring over at him before carrying on his way, grumbling bitterly under his breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival stared after him, and then around at his surroundings - which had changed. He was by the Hudson. His feet had taken him from Tina’s apartment without him even realising. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Damn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his head roughly and walked over to the water’s edge, leaning against the railing there and breathing in cold, winter’s air. It helped bring him back to the present, a little. There’d not been much fresh air to enjoy over the past year after all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Breathing in another lungful, he let his head drop, his eyes falling shut with it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mind had wandered a lot recently. It’s what happens, he supposed, when one finds themselves locked away. Retreating inwards was the only way to keep himself sane at times. When he was alone, and also when he wasn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If he went far enough inwards he could imagine himself somewhere far away. Somewhere nice and comfortable. Somewhere safe. He’d imagined his living room a few times, his office, the dorms of Ilvermorny, the library, the woods, Theseus' London flat. It’s funny, thinking about it rationally, but the thought of comforts laying beyond his torment ended up being what saw him through it all in the end. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was rarely allowed that brief relief in Grindelwald’s presence of course. More often than not, just as his mind started to drift away, it was invaded by another and dragged back to the present, to endure an entirely separate violation. If he was lucky at least. When he was unlucky, Grindelwald would violate him there, in those places, those few shreds of comfort left to him - until eventually he dared now allow his mind to drift at all in his presence, lest they become even more tainted by the foul man’s stain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shook his head roughly, cutting the thought off before it could fester, and focused on the river instead. He didn’t want to have another episode. Even now, he could feel cold, hard, phantom fingers gripping the back of his neck, brushing against his skin, heedless to the clothing that shielded it. Gripping, squeezing, pressing… it wasn’t something he wanted to relive again, certainly not right there in the middle of Manhattan. Not in public where anyone could witness the spectacle he’d become. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet the sensation lingered regardless. It was clearly going to be one of those nights. He needed to go home - either for distraction or to hyperventilate in private. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With that thought in mind he drew in another deep breath and stood up straight, pushing off the railing. He hastily made his way over to a more isolated spot and apparating across the river to his Brooklyn home. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His attention flicked immediately to the aurors stationed outside of his flat the second he arrived. He gave them both a hasty nod, and tried to push past another wave of indignation that whipped up inside of him, mixing sickeningly with the anxiety. They were there for his safety. Those were their official orders at least. But he’d been in their position before, and made the order himself enough times to know they were also there to report back on his movements. If he came home later than usual, or god forbid, not at all, he’d be receiving a personal visit from the President.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d confirmed that already, after a night he’d spent alone with a bottle of firewhiskey in his office. Waking up hungover, drooling onto one’s desk in front of one’s head-of-state isn’t exactly an experience he wish to relive anytime soon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stepped inside and locked the door behind him, loathing how even that made his heart pound. Confinement, even self-imposed, unnerved him. But then leaving the door unlocked would fray at his nerves just as bad, if not worse. Most nights he found himself sitting sitting alone by the sofa, straining to hear the sound of a door creaking open, of footsteps coming down the hall. For all the good it would do him. He'd not heard it coming the first time around after all. No matter how many times he recalled that night, turning the scene over and over in his mind, there was never any warning - just a sudden feeling on unease, then darkness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gritting his teeth, he pulled off his coat and hung it up, before toeing off his shoes and nudging them to the side of the front step.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The most frustrating thing of all was that all of this was in his head. The reality was that he was as safe as he’d ever been - more so even. There were aurors watching the house, locks and enchantments keeping people out. Furthermore, he was of no use to Grindelwald or his cause any longer. He’d probably already fled the country. He was fretting over something that would never come to be. He was safe. Nobody was coming for him. Nothing was going to happen. It was all done. It was finished. He just needed to move past it now. Why couldn’t he just move past it?!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His fists clenched beside him as he felt his nerve beginning to slip again, in spite of his attempts at reason. The feeling of hands running over his body returned. All at once he found himself feeling bared, vulnerable. His jaw began to ache, he felt teeth against his shoulder, biting, splitting skin-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Growling, he brought his clenched fist down hard against his thigh, then did so again a few more times until the pain of that brought him back from the edge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It worked to some extent, but not entirely. It was still there - waiting to take hold again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those thoughts weren't going anywhere anytime soon, he was starting to doubt they ever would. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sighed. He was just having a bad night, that was all. He’d had nights like this before, plenty of them. When his captivity was at the forefront of his mind. Surely it was to be expected that the day the man at the root of all of that suffering slipped through their fingers would be worse than most. It would get better with time. It had been before, it will again. He just needed to wait out the storm. Keep breathing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So he tried to ignore it, and hoped it would fade away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Later, he’d chalk his underwhelming response to finding Grindelwald himself, sitting on his living room sofa, up to that. His exhaustion of the hyper-awareness to everything, the flashbacks, the fact that every other time he saw the man out of the corner of his eye, he wasn’t there when he looked back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But this time he didn't disappear. When he blinked He stayed exactly where he was, sitting on Percival’s sofa, smirking at him, his mismatched eyes sparkling with malicious glee. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good evening, Percival.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Terror had once been an unfamiliar sensation for him. Now it felt like an old friend - gripping the heart in his chest in a vice-like hold and squeezing it still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It made his hands slow and clumsy when they finally flew to his wand. But he’d dawdled too long. Just as he gripped the handle, it slipped from his fingers and flew into the other man’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were not expecting me, my boy?” Grindelwald drawled, one of his pale brows rising. “I’m hurt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unable to fight, Percival immediately attempted to flee. Spinning on his socked heel, he made to run for the door, only for a chord to snake around his ankles before he could take a step towards it. He tumbled to the floor with a loud thud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could hear Grindelwald laughing behind him, hear him shifting on the sofa, moving to get up, to come towards him, to touch him, hurt him, take him--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wouldn’t let him! Not this time! Not again!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gritting his teeth, Percival banished the chords with a hasty wave of his hand and jumped back upright. His chest was heaving and his heart was in his throat. He had to fight! But he couldn’t seem to even think - and he needed to. He needed to be smart. He couldn’t let the other man take him again. He couldn’t do it. He wouldn’t be able to survive it again, he was certain. If he couldn’t escape, he’d fight. He’d fight with all he had. He’d die before being taken again! </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grindelwald smirked and rose to his feet as well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival snarled and hurled every jinx and curse he could without the aid of his wand, closing the distance between them with each spell he threw. Grindelwald deflected each of his attacks with apparent ease, so when he was close enough Percival decided to throw something at him that he could bat away with a charm. His punch landed with a satisfying crack and sent the other man, staggering back, so Percival threw another one, then another, before leaping forward and tackling the bastard to the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t going to go down without a fight this time. Wand or not, he wasn’t going to go easily--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>White light flooded the room and Percival found himself flying across it before he could so much as think about summoning a shield. He hit the brick wall with a loud crack and fell to a heap on the floor, the wind well and truly knocked out of him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Muggle dueling, truly?” Grindelwald panted from the other side of the room, a bloody grin spreading across his pale face. Any satisfaction that Percival had felt in striking the other man drained away as it grew wider. “It seems nothing is beneath you, my boy,” he drawled, before pointing his wand straight at Percival. “ </span>
  <em>
    <span>Crucio</span>
  </em>
  <span>. ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival convulsed as a familiar agony shot through him - like electricity, running through the centre of his bones, splintering them and cooking him from the inside out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The spell lifted for a moment. Long enough for him to drag in a couple ragged gasps, before they were ripped from him by another curse. Then another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, it all started to blur together. He screamed, unable to hold it in any longer. Distantly he wondered why the aurors outside hadn’t come to investigate the noise. Perhaps a spell had been put on the room. Perhaps they been confunded. Perhaps they were double-agents. Perhaps they were in the bottom of a trunk, or the bottom of the Hudson, and those men outside had been a pair of Grindelwald’s fanatics that he’d been too unobservant to spot. He should have checked earlier. Should have known better. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The curse was lifted and Percival slumped bonelessly to the floor, every muscle in his body trembling and twitching of its own volition. He couldn’t move. His arms and legs were limp. He could only lay there in a heap on the hardwood floor, watching and listening as a pair of shiny black shoes drew closer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He bit back a pained cry as one of them nudged him onto his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grindelwald smirked, the blood staining his teeth a frightening red. Then with a sweep of his hand - his face was clear and unblemished once more, every trace of damage Percival had managed to inflict magicked away like it had never existed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, I liked being you, Percival,” Grindelwald said softly, crouching down beside him, running his fingers through his slicked back hair, combing it free from its style. “You’re actually very enigmatic -strong, brave, and yet so… responsive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival cringed as Grindelwald’s fingers moved from his hair, brushing down his cheek, over his lips, down his throat, then to the back of his neck. He couldn’t stop the whimper that slipped through his lips when they squeezed there. How many times had he been held in place by that grip alone? How many times had that been the precursor for what was to come?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He squeezed his eyes shut and tried (not for the first time) to will his consciousness away, but was brought back by a sharp slap across the mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be rude,” Grindelwald scolded, before his hands carried on their way down his body, an amused smile playing at thin, pale lips.  “You know, when I was in that cell, I thought about how much I was going to miss having you here, like this. Our time together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival gasped when he felt Grindelwald slipping his hand into his trousers. The other man mockingly echoed it, chuckling at Percival’s attempts to wriggle away from the contact, but it was no good. No matter how much he squirmed and writhed, Grindelwald’s hands went where they pleased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Breathing in strangled gasps he attempted to force his body to obey him, to shake off the weakness the cruciatus curses had cast upon him and fight back. But it was useless. He could do little more than bat at the other man’s hands and push futilely at his chest before Grindelwald grew bored of the display and forced him onto his front instead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tears that had already been prickling at his eyes began to trickle down his face as a finger slipped between his cheeks, probing teasingly at his hole. It was supposed to be over. This was never supposed to happen to him again. He’d promised himself that it wouldn’t. But it was. He’d tried his best, fought his hardest, but he’d been too slow. Nobody was coming for him, nobody was going to stop this from happening to him again.!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hand shifted and came around to his front, cupping him gently for a moment before giving a violent squeeze, wrenching a pained cry from Percival. The other man let go again and went back to running his hands over him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I thought to myself,” Grindelwald breathed, leaning down so his breath was tickling Percival’s ear. “Gellert , I thought. Does it really need to come to an end?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival flinched, cringing away when he felt something soft and wet stroking his ear. Grindelwald chuckled and nuzzled closer - like a lover would, rather than the tormentor that he truly was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The comparison relit a fire in Percival’s belly. Small and flickering, perhaps, but there all the same. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With what strength he had left he tossed his head to the side, knocking it against the other man’s face. He sagged with a soft sigh of relief when, with a hiss, the hands left him entirely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he knew the respite was short lived, </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crackle of electricity filled the room as Grindelwald hexed him two, three, four, five times. He lost track and, he thought, so had Grindelwald. The man had never really tolerated rudeness quietly. Certainly not from Percival. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the beast’s temper had been satisfied, Percival couldn’t move at all. His body twitching helplessly on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grindelwald tossed his head back and let out a breathless laugh, combing the tufts of hair that had fallen over his face back in place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Still so fiery,” he chuckled as he wandered back over to the sofa. “Most would have broken completely by now, you know. But not you. That’s why I like you, my boy,” he said as he pulled off his coat and set down his wand, before walking back across the room, this time with a sense of purpose. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival groaned as a heavy weight settled across his shoulders, pinning him down to the polished hardwood of the floor. He could feel both of Grindelwald’s hands groping at his hips so he surmised it was magic holding him down this time around. No well timed headbutt would save him. Still, he tried to move regardless. He couldn’t. His arms were trapped underneath him, pinned by the weight of his own body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those cold, hard hands of his imagination made quick work of his belt, and before long, his trousers and underwear had been tossed across the room, leaving his naked from the waist down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival bit his lip in an effort to keep quiet as his hips were grabbed, hard enough to bruise, and he was heaved up onto his knees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If only you could see yourself,” Grindelwald panted, spitting on his fingers before pushing three inside of Graves' all at once. A wide grin spread across his face at the pained sob that it ripped from the man. “You wouldn’t be able to contain yourself either.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival grunted as the fingers fucked into him, stretching his hole wider roughly, before punching inside once again. He felt like he was being split open, perhaps he was. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s bled after an encounter with the man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He heard the sounds of a belt being undone behind him, and a shameful whimper ripped itself from his throat in response. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want you to know something, Percival,” Grindelwald said, sounding for all the world like they were conversing over tea. “You are of no importance to me, whatsoever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fingers withdrew and Percival gasped when he felt the terribly familiar sensation of the other man’s cock pressing against his abused hole, before pressing inwards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could kill you right now, right this moment, and be no worse for it,” Grindelwald said as he jerked his hips forward, stabbing his cock almost entirely inside him - dragging a long, pained keen from the man beneath him </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival screwed his eyes tightly shut and bit his lip in an effort to keep silent. But it wasn’t working. The stretch hurt, the spit hadn’t been enough to do anything to ease the experience on his end, though he expected that was by design. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, he tried to keep quiet - but what was the use? He was being raped in his own home. He’d been beaten, bent over and taken from behind by the man who’d now bested him on countless occasions. And this wasn’t even the first time. What was the one more humiliation on top of everything else? Why should he deny himself the fleeting release of vocalising some of his agony simply for appearances sake when that cause had been lost a long time ago. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I won’t,” Grindelwald said as he started to move inside of Percival. The pain gasps and cries seeming to only heighten his enjoyment in the task, for each were rewarded with a particularly rough thrust, or a stinging slap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival groaned when he felt a hand slip through his slicked back hair, before tightening violently. The spell that kept him pinned to the floor lifted. Immediately he found himself yanked upright sharply, until he was leaning back limply against the other man’s chest, the cock inside him as far as it could go.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not tonight at least. Maybe in the future. But for the time being, I think I may just visit. Here and now, quite like I did before,” he said, his breath tickling Percival’s ear, before moving down his neck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival shivered, squeezing his eyes shut, trying to will himself away once again only to be brought back by a sharp pain shooting from the crook of his neck. Grindelwald had sunk his teeth into the soft flesh, hard enough to break the skin. He gasped, then cried when the pressure only increased. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly he was pushed forward again, onto his hands and knees, staying that way for a second, maybe two, before his arms gave out beneath him, sending him face-first into the hardwood floor. He tasted blood in his mouth, and felt it trickling from his nose. How ironic. The most obvious outward injury from this entire encounter and it was born of his own weakness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grindelwald picked up the pace, now well and truly fucking into him hard and fast, treating him more like a $10 whore he picked up on a street corner rather than a sick parody of a lover like he had before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pace were getting harder, jerkier. It was coming to an end. He just needed to hold in there a little longer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sure enough, after one particularly hard thrust he felt the other man coming deep inside him, filling him up. It made him feel sick to his stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even in this, Grindelwald drew out the torment as long as possible - refusing to pull out immediately. Instead he waited for his cock to go soft inside of Percival before finally, </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally,</span>
  </em>
  <span> slipping free. Still, he held Percival’s hips, keeping them raised, chuckling as his come slowly dribbled from the other’s bruised hole. Only then, once he'd had his fun, did he finally let go and allow him to fall properly down onto the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fight well and truly beaten out of him, Percival simply curled in on himself, squeezing his eyes tightly shut.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He listened as the other man rose to his feet, his knees popping and clothes rustling as everything was buttoned back into place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is nothing you, or anyone else can do that will keep me away, my boy,” Grindelwald said, a smile plain in his voice. “I will always be able to touch you. Whenever I want. Wherever I want. If I wanted it I could quite easily have you over your Presidents pretentious desk, and have her watch it too…” he hummed at the idea. “Perhaps I will, one day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percival’s eyes cracked open as he heard the other man move away. He watched warily as he walked over to the sofa and retrieved his wand and coat. So he wasn’t to be taken again? Interrogated? Bewitched? Put out of his misery? Just violated and left behind. Like a toy to be used and discarded at will. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grindelwald glanced over his shoulder and smirked knowingly, like he’d heard Percival’s thoughts. Perhaps he had. Laughing he tapped his brow in farewell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Until next time, Mr Graves,” he said, before walking down the hall, and out the door.</span>
</p>
