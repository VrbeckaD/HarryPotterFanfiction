    <p> </p><p>Harry tried to ignore the blond boy squealing a few seats ahead of her. Whatever the other girls saw in Suoh, Harry differently wasn’t seeing it. She felt a bit of sympathy for Fujioka, the poor first year had to deal with the blond and his ridiculous antics every day. Even after school at that otome game club of theirs.</p><p> </p><p>She shook her head as she dismissed the distraction. Hermione had texted her earlier, a reminder to call during her next free period. It was a bit annoying, but Harry managed to turn on her Bluetooth earpiece to make the call. She began gathering her paperwork and schoolwork, absently wondering how she’d juggle work meetings and school. Maybe Hermione could make her a time turner? As the call connected, Harry began walking toward the cafeteria. It was lunchtime, and if Hannah found out she skipped it again...Harry sighed. It was best not to give the Hufflepuff a reason to worry. Especially on Physical Exam day.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve arranged a training session with Agent Midori,” Hermione said when the call connected. “And you’re training with Agent Senji has been moved to after school hours. Specifically on school grounds. There’s an available dojo. Rent is within your training budget-”</p><p> </p><p>Harry recalled the dojo Hermione was talking about. She’d checked it out when the papers for renting it had been placed on her office desk. It was a good dojo, and with a few temporary Wards, it would be fit for both physical and magical training.</p><p> </p><p>“Send a message to Bill,” Harry said, heading towards the cafeteria. “I’d like to hire his old Warding team. A temporary five-layer multi-purpose ward, negotiate for prices around five thousand, no more,”</p><p> </p><p>“Understood,” Hermione said.”...will you be coming over today?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, why wouldn’t I?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you should be making friends Harry,”</p><p> </p><p>“I already have friends,”</p><p> </p><p>“Besides Ron and I,”</p><p> </p><p>“George, Ginny, Neville, Hannah,  Luna, Susan-”</p><p> </p><p>“How about you make some friends at that school of yours? They have a magic club don’t they?”</p><p> </p><p>“A Black Magic club,” Harry rolled her eyes. “I’m not getting involved with that, who knows what the muggles get into messing with that branch of magic,”</p><p> </p><p>“Then maybe they need some guidance,”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Harry sighed. “Maybe I’ll just make a Mythology and Folklore club instead,”</p><p> </p><p>“Wouldn’t that be funny, Mistress of Death, the oldest Myth in our Enclave teaching others about Myths…”</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled. Then she remembered that Ron hadn’t actually been at the apartment when she visited the past few days.</p><p> </p><p>“Is Ron going to be there or…”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Hermione groaned. “He’s been going out with Lavender more often, I think they’re even looking into their own apartment together,”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s…”</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t believe they’re still dating! He only started talking to her because of the love potions. By Morgana, who does she think she is? ‘Oh, I’ll just drug him up to get his attention’ Like that's a good start to a relationship. We’re his best friends! Where was she when a Death Eater was revealed to be his pet rat? Where was she when -”</p><p> </p><p>Harry hummed along as Hermione began ranting. Personally, Harry hadn’t thought Lavender wouldn’t last more than a year. So far it’s been a year, and there was no sign of her leaving Ron. By Merlin, when Ron followed her and Hermione to Japan, Lavender packed up her life in England and came with. Maybe they were good for each other?</p><p> </p><p>“-Usa-chan!” A familiar voice said down the hall.</p><p> </p><p>Harry quickly ducked into a side hallway and pressed up against the wall. Peering around the wall she saw them. Honi and Mori-senpai. Harry watched them as they walked down the hall. Honey-senpai was talking about something sweets related...and Mori-senpai was as calm and collected as always. Harry’s gaze fell to the hidden muscle and quite a strength, as her mind wandered. What would it be like to be held in his arms? To rest her head on his chest? To dance with him? To <em>spar </em>with him? Oh, she could just imagine what it would be like to spar with the Kendo champion. Her face flushed at the thought, her heart thudding in her chest and echoing in her ears.  </p><p> </p><p>“Harry?” Hermione asked from her earpiece. “Are you having a panic attack? Your bracelet Harry! Call Hannah, breathe!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine! I’m going to lunch. I’ll call you later,”</p><p>“Oh, well...be safe then Harry,”</p><p><br/> “Be safe Hermione,”</p><p> </p><p>Harry turned off her earpiece and shoved it into her purse. She let her head hit the wall behind her with a thud. Why did the older boy make her heart race? Why was he the one who stirred these unfamiliar feelings in her chest? Why couldn’t it be someone she actually had a chance with?</p><p> </p><p>Harry ran a hand through her black curls, her nails scraping against her head, before tightening the yellow ribbon at the nape of her neck. She fixed her skirt, adjusted her sleeves, and double checked her messenger bag and purse. Pulling out her hand mirror she checked her make-up, which still hid her scar, and smiled. Sure, one of the most attractive guys at Ouran made her heart race, but she was fine. It wasn’t his fault he featured so frequently in her daydreams. She’d get over it, one way or another, and everything will go back to normal. It’s only been three weeks since this crush developed anyway, it wasn’t that big a deal anyway.</p><p> </p><p>A nutrient smoothie, with a special nutrient potion, a turkey sandwich, and a cup of pear slices made up her lunch. Harry smiled at the chef and took her tray to a corner in the back of the cafeteria. With her back to the wall and all the exits within her sight, Harry settled down to eat.</p><p> </p><p>She’d be meeting Hannah in a private room for her Physical Exam, unlike her weekly meetings which were in the Academy’s Clinic. Hannah was still worried over Harry’s health problems, like the sudden growth in her magical capacity, or the instinctive response her magic has to ‘danger’ both real or imagined. Harry really doesn’t want to keep hurting her friends because of a nightmare or flashback, but she can’t seem to control her magic unless she’s awake...even then a flashback or memory will wrestle control away from her.</p><p> </p><p>Harry stabbed a pear slice with a frustrated huff. A group of giggling girls had Harry looking up, and she saw the King of the Otome club making a speech. Whatever he was saying, it must’ve been dreamy because half the group of fangirls swooned. Harry glanced around the group and saw Mori-senpai, sitting with Honey-senpai and the red-headed twins. They were on the other side of the cafeteria...it wouldn’t be obvious if she watched them right? The other girls were fawning over Suoh...so maybe one girl so far away would go unnoticed?</p><p> </p><p>The time for the physical exams was set for after lunch. Harry made her way to her private exam room with little hassle. The panicking girls flooding the halls with cries of a pervert doctor were annoying though. Ootori’s doctors were too polite for such accusations.</p><p> </p><p>Hannah ran Harry through the required tests, frowning and humming at the results, before running the magical tests as well.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re starting to gain weight,” Hannah said. “Just don’t push yourself too much during training,”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be careful,” Harry promised.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s still dark magic in your curse scars,” Hannah continued. “How are your symptoms?”</p><p> </p><p>“I still get headaches and migraines...chest pains and smoke still make me nauseous...and my limbs still spasm sometimes…”</p><p> </p><p>“Cruciatus exposer, it may be a life-long thing but I’ll continue looking for something to help,”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,”</p><p> </p><p>“How are you sleeping?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah...fine?”</p><p> </p><p>Hannah raised a delicate eyebrow. Harry sighed.</p><p> </p><p>“I go to bed around ten, but don’t fall asleep until midnight. Then I’m waking up around three at the latest,”</p><p> </p><p>“Nightmares?”</p><p> </p><p>“...yeah,”</p><p> </p><p>“Try taking naps throughout the day then, see if that helps,”</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,”</p><p> </p><p>Hannah sent Harry back to class with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>On her way out of the Hall where the other students were having their physical exams, Harry saw Mori-senpai in a doctors coat. She ducked her head, hiding her blush, as she quickly left the room. She had International Economics next class, she didn’t want to be late.</p><p> </p>
