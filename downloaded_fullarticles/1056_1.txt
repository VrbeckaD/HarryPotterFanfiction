    <p>The day the letter arrived was wet. It had rained the day before, and the air had settled into a hot mugginess. Anne Shirley, eleven years old with bright red hair in two neat braids and a faded blue dress, was imagining a world that had nothing to do with muddy streets and screaming children. She was sitting just inside the door of the shabby house, staring at herself in the dusty glass of an empty cupboard. </p><p>In her mind, she made her sad, warped reflection into a friend named Beatrice. Beatrice seemed like the kind of name a real young lady would have, and they had such fun at tea parties and walking in the vast gardens of their estate. </p><p>She paused long enough to glance at the swaddled infant resting in the corner and count the four children under six who were wading in the street, and then went back to asking Beatrice what gloriously tragic play they were seeing that night. Anne didn’t actually know of any plays—she liked to read but could rarely find any real books—so she was mid-way through making one up, in which a beautiful maiden was so in love she could hardly bear to live without him, when a voice startled her. </p><p>“Morning, Miss Anne!” </p><p>Anne looked up and smiled at the mail carrier. “Hi, Tom!” </p><p>“And how’re the kids?” Tom was old and poor and single, balding with his only pair of pants an unrecognizable brown from the weather. He wasn’t good at sarcasm—his voice sounded grave when he meant to tease her. But she’d greeted him every day for eight months now, and she felt she was beginning to understand his character. </p><p>“Ah, you know how it is,” she gave him an exaggeratedly casual shrug, “they’ll all need a bath tonight—Penny, stay on this side of the house!—but they’re kinda cute anyway. Of course, it would be so much more interesting if I was watching them because I was secretly an orphaned lady named Priscilla but my evil aunt told everyone I wasn’t really and sent me away into poverty. But in ten years little Penny, who I taught to read and took care of her whole life, read an old story about me and realized it could only be her nurse, and she helped me reunite with my home and my dear horse named Jennifer.” </p><p>“Mm,” Tom didn’t usually understand the things Anne said, but he liked her, and he admired her constant smile. “I got a surprise for you today, Miss Anne.” </p><p>“Oh, is it an invitation to a party? Mrs. Williams says they don’t get invitations, but when I lived with Mr. And Mrs. Groves, they sometimes did. They didn’t take me, but I’m a little older now—” </p><p>Tom laughed, “Are you going to let me finish, child?” </p><p>“Yes, sorry!” Anne clapped both hands dramatically over her mouth. </p><p>“I have a letter, addressed to you.” He held out a thick parchment envelope and Anne took it reverently, disbelievingly. Tom turned before she could open it to finish his route. “And Anne, if I were you, I wouldn’t show your foster mother that you got something.” Anne never talked about her badly, but everyone new that Mrs. Nancy Williams was nasty to her husband, her children, and her neighbors. </p><p>In brilliant green ink, it was addressed to: </p><p>Ms. Anne Shirley<br/>
The Kitchen<br/>
226 King Ct.<br/>
London </p><p>Anne carefully peeled up the corner of the envelope so it didn’t rip, relishing the moment. She’d almost gotten it open when the baby, little James, shrieked. She tucked the envelope into her pocket and tried to forget about it as she fed the baby and then called the others in for dinner and baths. By the time Mrs. Williams, who was a laundress, returned tired and grumpy, all her children were asleep and Anne was eating her own bowl of cold soup at the table. </p><p>“Anne!” Her sudden bark made the girl jump. “Why is the kettle still on? There can’t still be water in—shit, girl, you’ve burned it!” </p><p>Anne scrambled to her feet, her food forgotten. “Oh, Mrs. Williams, I am so sorry. I made tea for the children this afternoon and then James was hungry—” </p><p>“Tell me, with what money am I to get a new one? Hire you out as a maid, that’s what. Think you work much now? Just you’ll see! Scrub the stove before you sleep tonight!” She stomped off without stopping for food. </p><p>Tears burning her eyes, Anne knelt to put out the fire so she could scrub the black grime. She didn’t finish her dinner. By the time she finished, it was very late and she was very dirty. In her misery, unable to see through her watery eyes, she didn’t notice Still humming her newest song (“Poor little Priscilla, cast to the filthy floor...”), she slipped out the front door and curled herself into a corner of the dilapidated porch. The sky wasn’t visible through the heavy yellow fog, but the fog itself seemed to glow and gave her enough light to finally read her letter. It said: </p><p>Dear Ms. Shirley,<br/>
We are proud to announce your acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of necessary books and supplies, and be at King’s Cross Station, Platform 9 ¾ at 11 o’clock the morning of September the 1st.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Headmaster Dippet </p><p>She read it five times. It never occurred to her that it wasn’t real, that kindly Tom might have written her something to give her hope. She knew her imaginings weren’t real, but she also knew that sometimes strange things happened to her. She’d finally been sent away by the Groves when she couldn’t explain the bed of flowers that had sprouted in her sad corner. She was...a witch, then? An odd feeling tugged her stomach. She liked stories, and she knew that witches were ugly old women who were mean to little girls, not beautiful young women who died of love. </p><p>Still, the alternative was to stay here until Mrs. Williams tired of her forgetfulness and sent her back to the crowded orphanage. She was so tired of taking care of children. And she’d never been to any kind of school before. She’d learned to read from older kids at the orphanage, and a kind older son of one of her foster families had shown her a little math, but that was all. </p><p>It took her less than an hour to decide. She didn’t know exactly what today was, but she was pretty sure it was August. She knew King’s Cross was a train station in London, but she didn’t know where it was. None of that mattered. For the first time in her life, she had a way out. </p><p>The next day, she asked Tom the date. It was August the 8th. She had almost a month left. She spent a restless week, more forgetful than ever, planning. She owned one little carpet bag of things—two faded books, a cloth doll, two spare dresses. She had nothing else to pack. But finally, on August 15th, she chose something for herself. She waited until Mrs. Williams got home, late at night, so the children wouldn’t be alone. She tiptoed into their room and kissed each of them on their little foreheads, and crept into the night down the dark street, determined to find her way to the train.</p>
