    <p>The grief was slowly becoming too much.  Over the summer, Harry had allowed himself to forget that the battle at the Ministry of Magic had ever happened.  In his few short weeks at the Dursleys and the remainder of the summer at the Burrow, Harry had kept himself so busy that he didn't even have time to think of the true reason that Sirius had not written.  He convinced himself that he wasn't receiving letters from Sirius because the Dursleys weren't permitting it or Dumbledore told him not to write or maybe Sirius was just very busy.  When he returned to Hogwarts, things would go back to normal.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was the root of the problem: when Harry finally returned to Hogwarts, he came home.  At home, there was a pattern to things, and he felt for the first time the true pangs of loss.</p>
<p>It had started gradually, and if Harry were honest with himself, it the grief had only been festering since the moment he watched Sirius fall through the veil. </p>
<p>On his first full day back to Hogwarts, Harry wanted nothing more than to send Sirius a letter detailing his altercation with Draco Malfoy on the train.  He wanted to tell his godfather of his suspicions about Malfoy’s visit to Borgin &amp; Burkes.  He wanted to tell Sirius about the detention he got, the strange book he found in Potions, and somehow managing to win the prized Felix Felicis.  It wasn't until Harry had put quill to parchment that night, his hand scrawling an untidy <i>Dear Snuffles</i>, that he froze.  If anyone asked, Harry would be able to tell them with complete certainty that this was the precise moment in which it finally hit him. </p>
<p>Snuffles. <i>Sirius. </i></p>
<p>Harry had lost many things in his life - his parents, his childhood, Cedric - but he had never been given the proper opportunity to <i>grieve</i>. </p>
<p>After the first sob escaped his lips, Harry threw up a Silencing Charm around his bed with a flick of his wand.  He drew the curtains a second later once he was certain that none of his dorm mates had woken up at the cry.</p>
<p>He had mourned Cedric in his own way. Guilt, nightmares - it had been nearly unbearable at the time, but somehow, this was worse.  This guilt felt like a monster sitting on his chest.  This sadness was slowly sucking all of the air out of his lungs.  Harry felt more trapped in his mind than he ever had in the cupboard under the stairs.</p>
<p>He screamed, palms flying to his face and pressing against his eyes in an effort to block out the thoughts, blocked out the damn feelings that he wished he couldn't feel at all.</p>
<p>The parchment was back in his hands again, his fingers crinkling its yellowed surface as he stared at those two little words:</p>
<p>
  <i>Dear Snuffles. </i>
</p>
<p>Anger coursed through him.  He was angry at Voldemort, at Bellatrix, at Dumbledore - mostly, though, he was angry at himself for getting another person killed.</p>
<p>Harry let out an inhuman screech as he tore the parchment in two, then shredding each half into small slivers until <i>Dear Snuffles</i> was nothing more than specks of black ink on pieces of confetti.  A jab of his wand and a snarled, “Incendio,” lit the pile of parchment into a smoldering mess.</p>
<p>Only then did Harry let his tears fall.</p>
<p>Hermione immediately sensed Harry's emotional turmoil the next morning.  “You look exhausted,” she said bluntly as Harry sat down at the bench across from her. </p>
<p>“Do I?” he muttered tersely. </p>
<p>“It's Sirius, isn't it?” she murmured, reaching a hand across the table to rest on Harry's arm.  He flinched away, instantly feeling regret at the hurt that flashed across Hermione’s face.</p>
<p><i>I hurt everyone around me, don't I?</i> Harry said to himself. </p>
<p>“I'm here if you'd like to talk, Harry,” Hermione offered quietly.  “Or better yet, I imagine Madame Pomfrey-”</p>
<p>“I don't need a bloody Healer, Hermione.”</p>
<p>“I imagine she's trained for things like this, though,” Hermione pressed.</p>
<p>“I don't need a Healer,” Harry said once more, gritting his teeth against saying anything more that could possibly hurt his best friend.</p>
<p>“Then maybe journaling?” she suggested.  “That's something that doctors and therapists advocate for in the Muggle world.  Would you consider that at least?”</p>
<p>“I can deal with this on my own, thank you.”  As Harry surveyed the spread of food on the long table, he realized that he would be able to eat none of it.  <i>Sirius</i>, Harry's mind reminded him as his stomach gave a particularly violent lurch.  Ignoring the food, Harry reached for a goblet of pumpkin juice.  He tried to ignore Hermione’s pleading looks, but it was immensely difficult.  His saving grace came in the form of Ron, who finally showed up to breakfast half-asleep.  Hermione turned her attention to him, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts. </p>
<p>Hermione’s worried glances were driving Harry crazy.  When everyone had returned to the Gryffindor Common Room after dinner that evening, Harry managed to get away by slipping on his father’s cloak and stepping through the portrait hole.  He had no particular destination in mind, but somehow he ended up on the seventh floor, his footsteps taking him back and forth in front of the Room of Requirement until a single wooden door appeared.</p>
<p>Inside, the room had transformed into a small study.  A roaring fireplace cast a warm light around the room, giving it a welcoming feel.  With a relieved sigh, Harry sat down in the single red armchair.</p>
<p>“I'm so sorry, Sirius,” he murmured to no one, his despair and anguish once again welling up inside him.  “I don't know how to deal with this.”</p>
<p>Unbidden, Hermione's words from this morning returned to him.  “Maybe she's right,” Harry said to himself.  “Journaling.  Maybe…”</p>
<p>As if hearing his words, the Room provided a table in front of him, a small brown journal and a Muggle pen appearing on top of it.  “Journaling.  Just like a girl...hope it doesn't talk back,” Harry continued muttering, remembering the last magical journal to appear in his life. </p>
<p>The Room apparently decided that Harry was right and journals weren't exactly trustworthy.  Without a sound, the book was replaced instead by a pile of parchment.  Harry distractedly rifled through the stack, idly wondering what he was expected to do with a pile of blank parchment.  A second later, a book entitled <i>Letter Writing for the Wizard Soul</i> also appeared on the table.</p>
<p>Resigning himself to the Room’s meddling, Harry picked up the pen and held it thoughtfully above the top of the parchment.  He unconsciously began to write <i>Dear Siri</i> before stopping himself short once more.</p>
<p>Sirius.</p>
<p>He could write him a letter, a <i>hundred</i> letters, but he would never get a reply.</p>
<p>Harry let out a harsh sigh, crumpling the parchment in front of him.  “How do I write a letter to no one?” he muttered in frustration.  Being the brave Gryffindor that he was, though, Harry tossed the ball of parchment into the fireplace and set pen to paper once more. <br/><i><br/>Dear No One,</i></p>
<p>
  <i>I've never written a letter that I wasn't going to send.  It seems like wasted effort, but she thinks writing will help me.  She suggested journaling, but I'm not a lovesick witch crying over Celestina Warbeck songs on the radio.  Journaling is definitely not the way for me to go. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>How does one even begin a letter that no one will ever read?  It's fairly useless to ask how you are; there is no “you,” after all - unless the Room can read, in which case…  I suppose I shouldn't put anything past Hogwarts, though.  This is the school with moving staircases and vanishing steps and murderous professors, after all.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I suppose I'm writing because I have no one else to turn to.  Nobody understands what I'm going through.  How can other people understand the pressures that I'm under?  How can others understand what I'm feeling?  How do I tell people that in my head, I feel like I'm being dragged into the Black Lake by a grindylow and I can't even breathe?  I have so much going on in my head that I can't focus, I can't think, I can't-</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I miss you, Snuffles.  That's what this all comes down to.  I messed up.  I ran head first into danger without thinking, and now you're the one that's paid the price.  It's my own fault that I feel like this now.  I feel utterly shattered.  I wanted to be with you.  You were my chance for a home, and I blew it.  I thought I could be normal for once, but I guess they were right.  I guess I'm just a freak. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>If anything, I think writing this has made me feel worse.  Stupid Muggle journaling ideas. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Even if someone did find this, it would hardly matter.  How could anyone understand what a nobody like me is going through?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I guess that's me, then.  Nobody. </i>
</p>
<p><i></i>Harry folded the parchment into thirds.  The Room provided a stick of emerald wax and a seal, which Harry melted onto the parchment to lock away his words.  “I don't care what Hermione said.  No one is going to read this anyways,” Harry muttered.  He tossed the folded letter in the direction of the fireplace as he turned to leave. </p>
<p>He never saw the letter flutter back to the desk and settle onto the wooden surface as if waiting for someone.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Dear Nobody,</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I found your letter. Guess it didn’t go unread after all, did it?</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>My father always told me to be wary of things that talk back. Especially things you can’t see where they have their brain. But at this point, talking to a letter wouldn’t be the first time I let him down. He’s gone because of me. Even if it wasn’t, you know that’s what he’d say. I’m sure my family resents me for it. People say they see him whenever they look at me but whenever I look into the mirror…</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>But I have a new task now. One that’d redeem myself in my father’s eyes, and everyone else who became ashamed of him in the process. I’ll be better than my father ever was. I’ll take my place with the mighty wizards who came before me.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Assuming I get everything in order.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>That’s what it all comes down to though. I’ve got to get everything in order. I’m not foolish enough to ask for help. I’ve been given this task and I’ll do it alone. I’ll probably have to start doing more research soon to figure out the spells. I’m good but I don’t know everything… not that you heard that from me.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I can do this.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>They’ll kill me if I don’t. <br/>Probably. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Either way. I don’t want to find out.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Until I figure things out, I’ll keep swimming in the Black Lake and keep trying to stun the grindylows, if you don’t mind me stealing your metaphor. Or is it analogy? Doesn’t matter. Just have to take one day at a time and keep your eyes on the prize.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Father always told me that- always keep your goal in mind and you’ll find success. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Not to mention the fact that the school year has just started. A lot has happened over the summer. It’s not even mid-term yet. Lots of time left to get stuff done.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I think writing all this down has started stressing me out a little. Putting it all down on paper… it makes the task ahead seem both completely doable and insurmountable. Almost like writing the task of a History of Magic essay in a scheduler. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>So I agree.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Stupid Muggle journaling idea.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Speaking of History of Magic. I have Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon and should probably make an appearance. It’s not as easy to blow off that class as it used to be.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>- No One<br/></i>
