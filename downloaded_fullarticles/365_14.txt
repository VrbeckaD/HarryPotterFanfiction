    <p>Tonks knew her friend loved dragons, it was the kind of obvious thing that even someone who was both blind <em> and </em> deaf would realize if they spent enough time with Charlie. And with Charlie, just five minutes was certainly enough time to realize this.</p><p>But, Charlie loved dragons which was perfectly fine.</p><p>Except that the only things that the wizarding world had on dragons were about breeding dragons, hunting dragons, how to raise a dragon, different breeds of dragons and what uses various dragon parts had. Which meant that there weren't really a lot of actual material <em> on </em> dragons, which in turn meant that Charlie managed to read every book on dragons that Hogwarts' library had.</p><p>Which meant he started <em> sulking </em> because of this. And a sulky friend is no fun at all, especially when he tends to be too mopey to hide properly when they sneaking around. Which leads to Tonks deciding to dip into the reserve of muggle stories that have dragons in them.</p><p>It is a bit of a hit and miss, honestly.</p><p>Take <em> The Hobbit </em> , for example. Charlie had absolutely <em> loved </em> the book right up until Smaug showed up and died.</p><p>All of this means that Tonks is used to finding some kind of muggle book that has dragons in it and passing it on to Charlie. So when she's helping her mum clean out the attic and finds a couple of books titled <em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em> in one box of her dad's old things, she has no issue with passing them along too.</p><p>If she had known what this would lead to, Tonks never would have shared them.</p><p>(She absolutely would. Even though she was forcibly dragged into things, Tonks still had fun during the times they played.)</p>
