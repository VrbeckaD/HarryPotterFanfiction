    <p>    Harry Potter sat by himself in an empty compartment on the scarlet coloured train that was taking him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was having a difficult time accepting that he was going to be free of his family for most of the year. He was having even more difficulty accepting the fact that Hagrid wasn’t lying – magic really <em>did</em> exist, and he, Harry Potter, could use it.</p><p>    When the giant of a man had appeared in the shack Uncle Vernon had whisked them away to, Harry had been sure they were all about to be killed. He didn’t much care for the fate of the Dursley’s – family or not, they were three of the worst people he had ever had the misfortune of meeting, and Harry had long ago decided that he would be having <em>words</em> with whoever had left him with them.</p><p>    So to say that Harry was <em>surprised</em> to receive a birthday cake – he’d <em>never</em> received a birthday cake, wouldn’t have known what one was if Dudley hadn’t been around – instead of death was something of an understatement. And when it became clear to Hagrid – who had introduced himself as the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts – that Harry had no idea what he was talking about, the man had turned to shout at Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.</p><p>    Harry had watched the scene unfold with glee, a little sad that Erus was missing all the fun. But it was <em>brilliant</em>. Especially when Hagrid gave Dudley a pig’s tail for eating Harry’s cake.</p><p>    Until Hagrid had finally got around to telling him about his parents, that is. And all the secrets his aunt and uncle had been keeping from him.</p><p>    “You <em>knew</em>?” Harry had demanded, white-hot anger licking at the tips of his fingers. The entire hut had shivered, but – now that he knew about magic – Harry didn’t think it had been the wind.</p><p>    It was Aunt Petunia who had gone off in a rage, unexpectedly. Uncle Vernon had been the most vocal party so far, but when Harry thought about it, it made sense that Aunt Petunia would be more aware of the situation, given that Harry’s mother had been her sister. Harry listened to her rant, fury making his hands shake.</p><p>    And then Hagrid had whisked him away (they stopped, of course, by Privet Drive – Harry claimed he needed to pick something up, when it was really some<em>one</em>).</p><p>    The trip to the Leaky Cauldron had soothed some of his anger, given him moments of clear-headedness that made him realize getting back at his aunt and uncle for never telling him what he <em>was</em>, what he could <em>be</em>, would have to wait. He couldn’t rush in recklessly – he needed a plan.</p><p>    And Harry knew he had the patience to come up with a <em>very</em> good plan.</p><p>    Inside the Leaky Cauldron, Harry was greeted by people he’d never seen in his life, but who acted as though he was some sort of celebrity. They shook his hand, expressed what a pleasure it was to meet him, and were generally so positive towards Harry’s very existence that he found himself speechless. It was gratifying in a way Harry hadn’t expected.</p><p>    He followed Hagrid, feeling a little overwhelmed by everything but determined to keep up with the large man. They entered Diagon Alley – and wasn’t that just marvellous? – and headed straight for Gringotts, the wizarding bank. They would buy everything with Harry’s money – and wasn’t that something? Harry had barely owned anything in his life, but now he was apparently the owner of a rather impressive fortune residing in Gringotts.</p><p>    The money, Hagrid told him, had been left to him by his parents, although most of the money was actually from his grandparents on his father’s side. Harry absorbed all the information Hagrid gave him as he stared at the mounds of coins and silently wondered whether he had actually died. This seemed too much like a dream to the 11 year old.</p><p>    They didn’t only go to the bank for Harry’s money, however. Hagrid retrieved something – something small and wrapped in a grubby package. Hagrid was very quick to hide it away in one of his many pockets, and that was that.</p><p>    Harry couldn’t lie and say he wasn’t interested – he was. But he thought of himself as being rather good at reading the atmosphere, and the atmosphere around Hagrid told Harry he wouldn’t be getting any answers from the man. So he left it, content to let his curiosity simmer in the back of his mind. After all, he had other things to focus on.</p><p>    Diagon Alley was a lively place, full of strange and interesting sights. They started with Harry’s robes, and then his books, and Harry had the desire to buy every book in <em>Flourish and Blotts</em>. Hagrid grinned good-naturedly at his enthusiasm, and told him that most of the books wouldn’t be helpful to him, not this early on. They bought his cauldron, a set of scales and a brass telescope.</p><p>    The apothecary was filled with ingredients for potion making. Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for Harry’s basic potion ingredients while Harry explored the store, resisting the urge to pick up and feel things because he had no idea what anything was, and it could be dangerous. Some of the ingredients didn’t even have labels – Harry guessed that they were the most commonly used items in the store, something that everyone would recognise.</p><p>    Everyone, of course, except for Harry. For he had never seen such odd and fascinating plants and animal parts. He was admittedly a little queasy when he saw a jar labelled “Snake Eyes”, but he thought that he was justified in reacting that way.</p><p>    Hagrid was very good about Harry’s curiosity – he didn’t rush Harry, didn’t demand he stop asking pointless questions and certainly didn’t seem annoyed to be asked. When he didn’t know the answer, Hagrid asked the man behind the counter, who introduced himself as Tom.</p><p>    Hagrid checked Harry’s list outside the apothecary’s while Harry peered around. Harry could still see Gringott’s, the white building towering above all the others. He stuck close to Hagrid’s side, watching as witches and wizards hurried past him. Most of them wore plain black robes, but there were odd flashes of bright colours that caught Harry’s attention every so often.</p><p>    “Just yer wand left – oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.”</p><p>    Harry flushed, an equal mix of embarrassment and pleasure. “Hagrid, you don’t have to –”</p><p>    “I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at – an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze.”</p><p>    As much as Harry appreciated Hagrid’s thoughts – not getting him a toad because he’d be laughed at was almost enough to make him hug the man. The only reason he didn’t was because he’d never really hugged anyone before, and the idea of physical contact that <em>wasn’t</em> designed to hurt was… odd – Harry had to interrupt.</p><p>    “Hagrid, I don’t want an animal.”</p><p>    Hagrid blinked down at him. “Yeh what?”</p><p>    “I don’t want an animal, Hagrid. I have… I already have one.”</p><p>    Hagrid frowned. “What have yeh got?”</p><p>    Harry swallowed. “Do you promise not to tell?” he whispered, which was a silly thing to do in a crowded street, but Hagrid understood.</p><p>    “I won’t be tellin’ the Dursley’s nothin’, Harry,” Hagrid said, very seriously. “Yeh have my word.”</p><p>    Slowly, Harry nodded. He lifted up his arm and pulled his sleeve away to show Hagrid.</p><p>    Hagrid whistled. “She’s a beauty. How’d yeh catch her?”</p><p>    Harry shook his head. “I didn’t. She’s my friend.”</p><p>    “Well, yer a lucky kid, Harry. Can’t imagine somethin’ like her bein’ particularly friendly.”</p><p>    “She wasn’t at first,” Harry said with a grin. “But I won her over.”</p><p>    Hagrid nodded to himself. “Right then. No animal. She’s not on the list, but I’m sure Dumbledore won’t mind. But we need to get yeh wand. We’d best head to Ollivanders, only place fer wands. And yeh gotta have the best.”</p><p>    And off they went, Harry feeling a little lighter.</p><p>    Unfortunately, Harry hadn’t quite realized that he had to stay with the Dursley’s until term started.</p>
