          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus’ fingers stumble over the piano keys. He’s trying to play something upbeat and happy, to lift his spirits, but he keeps slipping into a minor key.</p><p>He’s shaking. A headache pounds dully behind his eyes. He feels like he’s made of lead, heavy and clumsy. His heart cannot seem to decide what rhythm it should beat in.</p><p>Sirius, he thinks. When this is over, Sirius will be there.</p><p>Any minute now. Any second. The waiting is the hardest part, he thinks.</p><p>His mind wanders. Dark thoughts. The music, he reminds himself. Keep playing.</p><p>His notes are messy. He mixes up sharps and flats, major and minor, loud and soft.</p><p>Any minute now, he thinks. Sirius, he thinks.</p><p>His hands bash loudly against the keys as the pain slams through him. He cannot hear, cannot see, cannot think or feel or breathe. There is just agony.</p><p>His bones are shattered and welded back together carelessly. His muscles are ripped and stitched back together in a crazy patchwork. His humanity is pulled gradually away from him. He feels it leaving him and tries desperately to cling to it, just for a moment, just for a little longer, but it slips from his fingers like liquid mercury.</p><p>The last thing he remembers is screaming for the pain to stop, begging for his life to end.</p><p>He wakes up slowly. He doesn’t try to move. He knows how much it will hurt. Just breathing is painful enough.</p><p>“Sirius?” He mumbles.</p><p>“I’m here. Sleep now, love. I’ve got you.”</p><p>fin.</p></div>
