    <p> </p><p> </p><p>In a fortress in Mirkwood there screamed a witch.</p><p>It was not a normal fortress, filled with knights and horses and swords and shields, nor yet an abandoned one with nothing but dust and dirt and remnants of the past. The name given to it was Dol Guldur, and darkness dwelled within.</p><p>Beneath the black stone, down in the deepest dungeon, shadowed and screaming, lay chained a source of magic unlike any before seen in Middle-earth; boundless in her power, torn from her world and imprisoned for purposes of which she did not yet fully know.</p><p>Ignorant but for the knowledge of vile things made, multiplied, or magnified by her magic; orcs, trolls, wargs, and those which were more dreadful than the dementors they resembled, instilling a terror in her heart that was inexplicable.</p><p>
  <em> The Nazgûl. </em>
</p><p>Unlike the guards of Azkaban, which would bring about her worst memories, they seeped into her very soul a kind of horror that had only ever been matched by the presence of Lord Voldemort himself, who was very much dead now and had been for weeks.</p><p>Or perhaps it had been months.</p><p>The sky here was dark and without sun, an eternal night, and with each passing sleep the darkness buried itself deeper. Along with it came the blurring of days, the further loss of hope; and it was replaced with the harsh speech of Mordor — for it was taught and she had no choice but to learn — and the further dismantlement of her identity; her name, her once-beautiful hair, her struggling sanity, and her magic.</p><p>Already it had been put to great use. Terrible, but great.</p><p>The true details remained out of reach, only that it had been used to bring these Nazgûl to greater form and to fuel the power of other things for something most sinister. A war, likely, if her growing grasp of the Black Speech was indeed any grasp at all.</p><p>Though she did not need to know the language to take a guess at that. War was what the wicked wanted. Or rather, victory — victory over all — and if war was what it took to reach it, then so be it, they would think.</p><p>What was torturing a girl just out of her teens to them?</p><p>“Sûr! Sûr, Lilith uth Mor!”</p><p>Lily could barely muster the strength to speak, much less lift her head to see the speaker. “That’s not” — she took a breath — “my name...”</p><p>Again pain streaked across her face, and her lips burst with blood like crushed cherries. She knew the taste of it well.</p><p>“Gashn tug amukh gashn-u, skessa!” The orc bent over, his face close, his smile terrible, and his breath putrid. “Agh gashn tug izubu Burz Laam!”</p><p>“Daka lat,” Lily said, and the words were foul on her tongue.</p><p>The orc threw his head back and laughed. It echoed through the room and into the dark hallway. Then, as he brought a stone bowl under her chin to collect her blood, he said words which made Lily nearly whimper: “Uth Nazgûl ath katu.” And then again: “Uth Nazgûl ath katu.” When enough blood was collected he stepped back and made for the exit. “Uth Nazgûl ath katu.”</p><p>Lily’s insides became cold and sick, and she could find no words, and even if she could she would not say them, for pleading never worked.</p><p>The orc cackled as he exited. “Skriki, Lilith un Mor, skriki!” And other orcs beyond her walls laughed too, and all around echoed the words, “Skriki!” “Skriki!” “Skriki!”</p><p>Then the Nazgûl came.</p><p>And such fear was upon her that she could not scream, or beg, or think thoughts that were anything more than loosely coherent.</p><p>The days blurred further. Darkness gathered itself around her — in her very core, it seemed — and she knew she would not withstand the patience of the Nazgûl.</p><p>Or that which dwelled beyond the shadows.</p><p>For it was not the Nazgûl who explored, ripped, and corrupted her magic. No, they came only to make her suffer, to weaken and unmake her mind so that which made <em> them </em> could also make her the same.</p><p>New, strange, and terrifying magic was about it, and if she must guess there was much, <em> much </em> more hidden beneath the surface — something altogether terrible, something that spoke more of evil incarnated.</p><p>It was ancient. <em> Demonic</em>, even. Something Voldemort himself would have stayed away from; something that made her gut scream, her eyes fail, her ears ring, and her courage falter.</p><p>Whatever feeling of trepidation she had felt when she had heard the basilisk roaming the halls in her second year — or when Sirius Black had first broken into Hogwarts — or when she had appeared in that old graveyard in Little Hangleton; it was nothing compared to whenever she felt the presence of <em> it</em>.</p><p>She refused its teachings.</p><p>But still she learned.</p><p>Armies and atrocities, death and decay, these were the things she was being used for. This evil wasn’t stripping her selfhood simply to spite her, as Voldemort might’ve done (she wondered if he even could).</p><p>It was to create something from her, and it was put already into motion.</p><p>Her hair no longer glowed like flame or swayed in the wind like the leaves of autumn. Thick and voluminous it may have remained, but its fire was left extinguished.</p><p>Now, wreathed around her head and reaching down to her waist, was black; black like the deepest shadow, from where this evil must’ve warped itself into existence. And Lilith the Black she was to be called; for her name had not been suitable for a servant of darkness — too soft and weak it was called — and something more belonging to the menace of Dol Guldur would have to do.</p><p>Time passed and they kept her chained as she was taught and tortured. And nearly once she broke free of her shackles and escaped, but there was always a watchful Eye on her and if anything, the near-escape came close to breaking her than anything the evil Eye did.</p><p>It remained a painful reminder that her small moment of happiness was ripped away abruptly, that the tentative blossom of hope she had let in was so easily swept away and back into the void, whence it might never return.</p><p>The void which seemed to beckon her.</p><p>Whether it was to ensnare her or give her relief she did not know, yet so far within did the evil of this place reach that not a day passed where she did not almost answer its summon, give in to the call of the void.</p><p>Yet, with time there comes also weariness and defeat.</p><p>And so, in the end, it seemed Lily fell into darkness, and from her shadow rose Lilith the Black, just as the Dark Lord and his Nazgûl had anticipated.</p><p>But they were all of them deceived.</p><p>For in the depths of her mind she hid herself, beyond the darkest corner of thoughts, deep, deep, deep in naught but shadows of memories.</p>
