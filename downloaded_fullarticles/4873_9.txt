    <p>A crisp wind blew through the disheveled and browning leaves that drooped from the many trees along the path that Hermione took from her parked car to the office. The office of someone she had been avoiding ever since she moved to Quantico and it was bearing heavily on her shoulders; there was no way of avoiding it now. Not when she no longer had thousands of miles between them as an excuse for poor communication and lack of making any attempts to reach out. Different time zones and work seemed to be a reliable justification for being aloof, but as she took a sip of her severely unsweetened coffee she knew it was, without a doubt, completely unavoidable.<br/>
Quantico was not the friendliest of cities she thought her career would take her but she was not in a position to complain. Ever since she had gotten the endorsement for the position at the Behavioral Analysis Unit she had nothing but a feeling of finally moving on from her past post. Her work with INTERPOL had been some of the toughest years of her career. Every second of her time had been committed to the work. To bringing some of the most dangerous people in the world to justice. It had taken so much out of her…<br/>
But this was different. This was another chapter. A whole new space in which to bury her fears of the past. </p><p>He’s locked away. </p><p>You’re off the hook forever. </p><p>He promised you’d never be at risk again.</p><p>94 west Elm street.</p><p>This was her mantra for the past year. The words ringing in her head as a voice, not convincingly hers, comforts her with this. A band-aid for her past. A past that would beat ruthlessly to break down her blockade at random moments to remind her of everything she had done. All her mistakes. Everything she had risked to do what needed to be done. She was promised that this would not follow her into this new job. Everything was erased and scrapped from the record. Everything buried under files and higher priority paperwork. </p><p>Nothing anybody needs to know. </p><p>She slipped up the front steps of the building hastily and headed right for the directory placed right in between the elevators in the lobby. Numerous people were strewn about, chatting loudly and looked to be heading on lunch breaks. Taking another sip of her depressing coffee she peered over the long list of names until she spotted the name “Granger” and room number to go with it. Ducking into an elevator, she let out a drawn-out sigh to no one in particular and began to clench and unclench her fists in an attempt at relieving anxiety. She flinched at the “ding” entreating her to vacate the elevator and proceeded to walk down the hallway to the office door. </p><p>Upon entry, she slipped up to the rather large reception desk where a very presentable and young dark-haired woman sat, headset in place and on the phone with someone. Raising a finger, she mouthed one minute while writing something down while Hermione awkwardly stroked a hand through her tangled and voluminous locks, draping them over one shoulder. </p><p>“Hello, sorry about that. How can I help you?” the woman said kindly, but to the point; clicking off her headset. </p><p>“Special Agent Hermione Granger here to see Ambassador Granger,” she stated, trying hard not to sound entirely put-off by the title she had heard her entire life. </p><p>“So, you are Hermione!” the woman exclaimed, a graceful smile spreading across her face. “Monica mentioned you might be stopping by today.” Hermione lifted an eyebrow at that information. Not entirely sure of what to make of it. Had she been proud to announce to everyone that she had been coming to visit? </p><p>“Yes,” she followed, nodding her head slightly and tried to remain focused on getting her visit over and done with as soon as possible. Then my debt is paid, she thought grumpily. “Could you let her know I’m here?”</p><p>“You can go right in, Ms. Granger. She is currently taking her lunch and is not seeing anyone.” She pointed her hand to the left and Hermione walked over to the door, taking a huge breath in before knocking lightly. </p><p>“Come in,” a stern voice came from the other side and Hermione opened the door. </p><p>The desk was exactly how Hermione had imagined it. Complete organization of the papers on the desk in trays; a small placemat with a duo of pens placed in holders lay before her as well as a small picture facing away from Hermione, but she could guess what it was of. The only bit of humanity she probably allows herself to have in this work place, she thought bitterly. The woman in question sitting at the desk perked up after taking a bite out a rather decadent panini and glanced up at Hermione. Suddenly a small sparkle traced her eyes and she placed her sandwich down, wiping her hands on a napkin. </p><p>“Oh!” she declared with a thin smile tracing her face. “Hello, darling.”</p><p>“Hey mom,” Hermione murmured stepping over to the slightly taller woman; not knowing whether to reach for a hug or a handshake. It had been years since she had seen her mother face to face and she immediately realized just how distressing it was to feel like she didn’t have comfort with asking for physical contact from her own flesh and blood, so she just stood there.</p><p>“Oh, do come here, dear,” she encouraged, gesturing her hands to come closer and Hermione did so, wrapping one arm around her mother’s shoulders and the other around her back, locking her in a fragile but well-meaning embrace. “It has been far too long.”</p><p>Hermione scrunched her nose slightly at that, tapping her mom’s back slightly to signal terminating the hug. “Well we both know I didn’t have much of a choice,” she commented, not wanting to sound harsh, but she couldn’t help it coming out as such. “You knew what kind of work I was getting myself into.”</p><p>“Oh yes, yes, of course, dear,” her mother uttered, waving her hand like she was swatting at a fly. “And I also understand that there are certain secrets you are required to keep, even from your own mother. And trust me, I have mine. But, dear, I hope you know that I did miss you.”</p><p>Hermione flinched ever so slightly at hearing her mother say something so genuine. She hadn’t forgotten how for years her accomplishments had seemed nothing but average. Nothing but menial congratulations for getting into the academy, graduating; being successful in every field she chose to enter never seemed enough. Ambassador Granger hadn’t gifted her with a taste of maternal love since she was a teenager. It was unfamiliar and left a strange taste in her mouth.</p><p>“Mom, you know that I couldn’t come see you until I had finished up at INTERPOL.”</p><p>“Hermione, that was almost a year ago. I’m not an idiot. I know you’ve been avoiding coming her right up until your first day at the FBI. And I also know that before your time overseas, or at least that’s where you told me you were, you had the decency to call once every month.” </p><p>Her mother was the most flustered Hermione had seen her entire life. She hadn’t so much as clenched a fist or raised her voice when her father walked out on them, and here she was so confused and at a loss for an explanation. Something Hermione knew must have been the hardest thing for her mother, a woman who built her entire existence on logic and meticulous planning, to not have a legitimate reason for the absence of her daughter’s small iota of communication. But her mother also had to know there was only so much explanation Hermione could supply with it being the truth. </p><p>“Mom… You know that my work doesn’t allow for very much contact with anyone close to me. It could pose as a security risk. But, as for the year in between, honestly, I can’t say for certain why.” Hermione was starting to pick at her thumbnails now. A long standing nervous tick that she could never leave behind. “Maybe I wasn’t ready to face you just yet.”</p><p>“Hermione,” her mom pleaded “you must know that I am not proud of how I went about commending you on your achievements. And you must have seen hell in your years at INTERPOL, but you also must know that I was worried. I worry about you every day whether you believe it or not. You are my daughter, for god’s sake.” Her mother tightened her lips at that, sitting slightly on her desk and looking expectantly at Hermione. </p><p>“I, I just waited so long to hear some word about your status. I even attempted to pull some strings from my end to find out what you were out doing-“</p><p>“Mother-“</p><p>“I didn’t end up coming up with a lot. Just that it was top secret. Need to know. All that delightful garbage. You calling me yesterday was the most relief I have felt in eons. Because I knew for certain you were safe. I know the stories of agents who go into this kind of work and become lost or worse. I’ve seen it, Hermione, trust me.”</p><p>Hermione looked at her mom for the first time in a long time as someone who could be broken. Someone who wasn’t immune to hurt or backlash. It struck Hermione right to the chest and she suddenly had no idea on what to say or how to proceed. </p><p>“Mom, I was working with the absolute best. I was in safe hands. You have to know that I’ve been capable of taking care of myself for years. You really had nothing to worry about.”</p><p>Her mom smirked at that, shaking your head. “Say that to me when you have kids.”</p><p>Hermione stretched a small smile across her face and decided to do something she hadn’t done it such a long time. Because now was a time to let go. To drop all the weight of resentment and start to just…heal. She stepped towards her mom like she was a cat, probable to skitter away at any time, and slowly placed her arms around her mom’s back and placed a kiss to her forehead. She felt her mom, in turn, tenderly place her hands on her back and rub it like she used to when she was a child. </p><p>“It really is so good to have you close again, dear.”</p><p>Hermione held her mom for a while longer, eventually leaning away to look her in the eye, a soothing smile brushing her face. Ultimately feeling the paternal love she had missed for all these years wash over her like a baptism. </p><p>“You, too, mom. You, too.”</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The alarm blared into the dark room as a hand extended out to silence it. A pale blond head poked out from under the covers and Draco Malfoy groaned at the knowledge of another impending day of work. He had been enjoying his mandatory time off and he was not entirely looking forward to returning today. The first time he had days off in perhaps years and he wasn’t expecting it to pass so quickly. </p><p>It had mostly been spent working on the new property he had purchased on a whim last month. It was a house of experience and well-worn to the core. It needed a lot of work and Draco was more than happy to use these renovations as a poor excuse for a hobby, but hey, everyone needs one, don’t they? His job certainly didn’t allow for much time for them anymore. Working for the FBI didn’t leave room for anything. No relationships, no hobbies, no clubs. The only thing Draco had such a strong connection with was his phone and whatever beer he decided to take home after he completed a case. The work never got any easier, this was true. But at least with knowing there was a project he had to take up spare time was a comforting thought. Assuring that he wasn’t a complete waste of 35 years. He finally had something to look forward to other than coming home and mindlessly wandering around his large apartment with no goals in sight. </p><p>Nobody had said this path was going to be easy. This was a job that drained you, Draco knew this now after almost five years in the field. Not accounting for all of his time in the academy and graduate school. But this was something he knew came with a lot of rewards. A lot of families finding closure. A lot of villains finally behind bars. He had helped with that; and it meant the world. </p><p>Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he groaned and got to his feet. Stretching ever so to release the tension built up in his shoulders from another sleep in fetal position. He wasn’t able to sleep any other way, now. He wasn’t entirely sure when it had become a habit, but it wasn’t something that he consciously had any control over anymore. Same could be said for his eating habits, drinking habits and countless other things. </p><p>He suddenly kicked into overdrive, now knowing there was no avoiding the rest of his day. He stood and proceeded to his closet to dress himself in a dark, pine green dress shirt and black slacks. A black tie to complete the formality his work entailed, and deep brown leather shoes made for the field work. He reached over to his bedside table and pulled out his ID card, badge and standard issue firearm and holster. Smirking ever so slightly he began to think of all the times he had been so close to needing a reason to fire this in the field. Thankfully he had never had a reason to, yet. But that yet seemed so sour and invigorating at the same time. Ever since he was a boy he had childish dreams of being a tough police officer and shooting every bad guy he had the chance to. Growing up, and with so many crime scenes cataloged into his memory he knew how absolutely absurd he had been at that age. If only his youthful self could see all the shit his successor had experienced. He would know. He would know just how uneasy it really is to carry a weapon like this every day. </p><p>'Your father didn’t see it that way, though.'</p><p>Shaking away the thought, he looped his belt through the holster and unbutton his sleeves to roll them up to his forearms. His family signet ring wrapped around his left-handed middle finger shone out in the early morning sun: a reminder. A constant reminder of the real reason he chose this path. The reason he fought every single day to bring these repulsive criminals to justice. A family torn apart. A young boy, oblivious to his circumstances. Blinded by wealth and privilege. If only he knew really how he came to be in this beautiful environment. </p><p>The truth hadn’t been surprising, but disappointing nevertheless. </p><p>The large “M” centered on the ring glared back at Draco and he sneered at it. Any logical person would have discarded this ring long ago had they been in his position. Had they known what his family had really stood for. </p><p>He needed to be reminded that when things got tough, when things became unbearable to witness, he knew that what he did: understanding these criminals and calculating their next move was necessary to capturing them. That everyone has a motivation and his fathers had been well-meaning, but undoubtedly corrupt.<br/>
His actions unforgivable. </p><p>Draco continued to sneer even as he went into the kitchen to collect his energy bars that substituted as an excuse for a lunch. He knew that his away bags were already packed with essentials for a flight and nights at a hotel, (if they were to be briefed on a case today and needed to fly out immediately). </p><p>His mind was already so clouded with the past that he realized he would need to take the next twenty minutes getting to the unit headquarters to clear it. Fast.<br/>
He wasn’t certain as to why he had had these thoughts breach his temporary sense of tranquility so swiftly, but he had confidence in cleansing his anger from his consciousness and doing the job properly. </p><p>He pulled his phone out of his pocket to check for any recent texts he had been too distracted to notice. </p><p>There were two from Theo Nott; one of his fellow agents and best friend. Draco knew that Theo would be chomping at the bit for him to return to work. Theo didn’t get along that well with his co-workers and often relied on Draco for conversation and consultation. Of course, they had to remain in a professional mindset at the office, but out of it they were constantly in each other’s company. They’d been mates for years, even before the academy. Before Draco’s father’s arrest. </p><p>Theo knew Draco’s reasons for choosing this career, but Draco never really knew Theo’s. It didn’t really matter in the long run, as Theo excelled at his job and was a brilliant profiler. He also had a real talent for forensic science and could have become a crime scene analyst if he preferred. </p><p>-'Hey mate, you ready yet? I’m gonna swing by and pick you up in about fifteen.'</p><p>-'Get coffee on the way?'</p><p>Draco checked the time. Theo had sent these texts ten minutes ago and would be here soon. He groaned and packed up the last of his essentials for a possible flight and what he needed for the office. </p><p>Swinging his courier bag over his shoulder, he checked his hair one last time in the mirror by the front door and swiped his hand through it roughly, trying to position it in a decent way that didn’t make it appear as if he had just tumbled out of bed. His budding of dark stubble around his mouth and jawline wasn’t helping either. Sighing in defeat, he sneered and closed the door behind him. Already feeling the impatience and overbearing weight of his first day back.</p>
