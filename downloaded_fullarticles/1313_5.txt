    <p>I watched as the birds that nest in the tree outside my window twittered at each other and flapped their wings. It looked as though two of them were talking. They were sitting on a branch tweeting at each other. I hoped they weren’t fighting and imagined they were just talking about the weather like people do. Then one flew away. I watched the bird fly away and wished I could join them up in the clouds soaring freely. </p>
<p>	“Scarlett! It’s time for breakfast!” I could hear my mother’s call from downstairs. Climbing down from my window sill I ran out of my bedroom and down the steps before flying into the kitchen and hopping up on one of barstools. “Careful you’re going to run into something going that fast” mom scolded lightly. </p>
<p>	“Sorry mom” I mumbled as she placed a plate full of scrambled eggs down in front of me. </p>
<p>	“Morning all” Dad called walking into the kitchen rifling through the mail. </p>
<p>	“Morning dear. Do you have an interview today?” mother asked seeing dad was wearing a button up shirt and tie. </p>
<p>	“Yup, the new newspaper factory in town. I’m hoping to get an administrative position” Dad explained. As mom turned back to her cooking “bills, bills, bills” dad muttered as he flipped through the mail. </p>
<p>	“Relax Edgar” mom spoke to him in her normal calming manner. “My job at the hospital is enough to cover the expenses until you get another job” </p>
<p>	Dad let off an exasperated sigh. “Of course Lydia” then he paused examining a letter closely. “What’s this?” </p>
<p>	“What is it dear” mom looked over dad’s shoulder at the tan parchment letter sealed with a red spot of wax. “Oh my goodness” mother exclaimed putting a hand to her mouth. <br/>__________________<br/>	I sat up in my room curled up on my bed. Nothing seemed to make sense anymore. I mean every kid wishes magic exists to some extent. However to have your mother tell you that it flat out is real and that she is a witch and that your a witch and now you get to go to some magical boarding school for witches and wizards. It’s a little overwhelming.</p>
<p>	Another loud bought of yelling erupted from downstairs. I cringed and covered my ears burying my head in my pillow. Dad was mad. Him and mom had talked for a long time before he left for his interview. Then mom came and talked to me and told me what happened and showed me her wand and explained that magic actually existed. Then dad came back and mom talked to him again. They sent me to my room and had been arguing ever sense. </p>
<p>	I didn’t get quite why dad was so mad. I mean mom had good reasons for not telling us about magic. I mean just because I can’t think of any doesn’t mean it there wasn’t any. I closed my eyes buried in my pillow and blanket trying to drown out all the yelling with the joy of my dreams. <br/>____________<br/>	Diagon Alley. I was standing in a walking street full of people dressed for halloween with my mother muttering to herself reading the list of things I needed for school. This wasn’t normal. Most schools required  pencils, paper, textbooks however this school was different it wanted a cauldron, robes, and a rat, cat, or owl. </p>
<p>	“Scarlett are you alright dear?” She asked. I looked up at her and nodded she just smiled down at me. “Don’t worry I was a little shell shocked the first time I was in Diagon Alley but you get used to it in fact your grandparents own a shop down here perhaps once we have all your supplies we’ll pop in for a visit how does that sound.” </p>
<p>	“Yes I hope grandma made cookies” I exclaimed then thought about something “wait grandma and grandpa are wizards?”</p>
<p>	“That’s right you see I grew up in the wizard world but when I got older and met your father I gave it all up to be with him” Mom told me as we walked down the alley. </p>
<p>	“Oh that’s sweet” I smiled up at her. There was an exclamation to my left and I turned to see a group of kids gathered around one shop looking in the window. “Mom what’s that?” I pointed toward the shop. </p>
<p>	“Oh that’s a broom shop” she explained simply. </p>
<p>	“Why are a bunch of kids getting excited about a broom shop?” I inquired curiously. </p>
<p>	My mother smiled down at me like she did when she had a happy surprise for me “it’s a flying broom shop” she further told. “People ride on brooms to fly around and play games” </p>
<p>	“Ooooh” I drew out the syllable my eyes locked on the shop like all the other kids now. “Can I get a broom?”</p>
<p>	My mother chuckled “unfortunately they don’t allow first years to have brooms dear but we can see about it when you’re older.” She paused thinking “Actually I might still have my old broom somewhere in the attic we might be able to dig it out when we get home if you’d like”</p>
<p>	“Yes! Yes! Yes!” I cheered. </p>
<p>	She laughed “come now we got to get some wizard money before we can buy anything” </p>
<p>	“Wizard money?” I inquired as we kept walking away the broom shop fading into the background. </p>
<p>	“That’s right wizards have their own form of currency separate from muggle money. We can get it exchanged at Gringotts the wizard bank though” She clarified pointing down the alley at the large white building we were headed toward. </p>
<p>	“What’s a muggle?” I questioned. I was learning so much in just a short walk I hoped I could remember it all. </p>
<p>	“A person that doesn’t have magic” Mom explained. </p>
<p>	I thought for a moment “so dad’s a muggle?”</p>
<p>	“Yes that’s right” she hesitantly replied. I got the idea mom didn’t really want to talk about dad right now so I stopped my quizzing as we reached the bank. “Now stay close to me Letty. These are goblins we’re dealing with not the most friendly of creatures.”</p>
<p>	“Mom” I groaned at the nickname. </p>
<p>	“Come now I think Letty is a beautiful nickname” Mom stated. </p>
<p>	“Maybe when you were a kid” I gave her a look she scoffed and ruffled my hair. </p>
<p>	We entered the bank and I immediately shuffled closer to mom. I had heard the word goblin come out of my mother’s mouth but I didn’t think she meant literal goblins. Yet there they were beed eyed, pointy eared, and sharp toothed goblins. I didn’t say anything as my mother talked to one of the clerks about exchanging the money. My eyes were busy looking all around me.  </p>
<p>	The place was a vast hall sculpted out of incredible marble and brass. I was in awe. Staring up at the glass ceiling. My mind had wandered to the point of me making shapes out of the clouds that passed over head through the window until my mother rising from her seat drew my attention. </p>
<p>	I shuffled after her out of the building and back on to the street. The next couple shops were a blur. My mother didn’t let me stop for five seconds for fear of me getting myself in trouble. Which was a completely wrong assumption. When we got my pet. I was set on getting a coal black cat that was in the shop window however after the slinky monster clawed at me when I was in there. I settled for my mother recommended screech owl. </p>
<p>	“What are you going to name him?” Mom asked as we headed out of the shop.</p>
<p>	“I don’t know” I replied eyeing the twittering bird who stared right back at me from inside his cage. “How about… Feathers?” </p>
<p>	My mom scoff “very creative” I just shrugged “guess that means you won’t be in Ravenclaw then” </p>
<p>	“Ravenclaw?” I asked confused. </p>
<p>	“oh Ravenclaw is one of the houses at Hogwarts. The other three are Gryffindor, Slytherin, and my house Hufflepuff. Each house has different traits they value and every student gets sorted into a house when they get to school” </p>
<p>	“Cool” I smiled “which house do you think I’ll be in then if not Ravenclaw?” </p>
<p>	“I don’t know you’re defiant like a gryffindor, clever like a slytherin, and kind like a hufflepuff. Plus creativity isn’t the only determiner for Ravenclaw.” She responded. </p>
<p>	“You’re no help mom” I muttered. She smiled and pulled me into a side hug. Releasing me as we kept walking to read over my school list. </p>
<p>	“Oh dear” she paused and dug in one of the bags “we’ve forgotten your potions book.” She sighed “here I’ll go get it. Go on into ollivanders there and get your wand I’ll meet you outside.” She pointed to a shop across the way that was labeled ollivanders wand shop.</p>
<p>	She handed me some of the wizard money before she headed off back to Flourish and Blotts. I walked through the crowd to the wand shop. Walking in was like walking into an ice box. It was freezing I pulled my light jacket tighter around my small frame. The shop’s floorboards creaked under my feet in protest as I walked forward on them. There was a little desk in the center of the room surrounded on three sides by shelves and facing the door. </p>
<p>	I reached up and rang the small bell on the desk. It’s small ding echoed through the silent shelves. It felt uncomfortable being alone in such a creepy store. </p>
<p>	“Well hello Ms. Tanner” </p>
<p>	I nearly jumped right out of my skin wiping around to see a tall lanky man with frizzy white hair that stuck out in all manner of angles standing behind me. “Hello” I replied once my heart had calmed enough to let me. “Are you Mr. Ollivander?” </p>
<p>	The man smiled and walked around me to the desk “indeed I am and you are Scarlett Tanner. Ah I remember when your mother came in here to get her wand. Time flies doesn’t it” he paused as if to think back into the past. Before snapping out of it suddenly “but what we want to focus on now is your wand. Now which is your wand arm?” He inquired picking up a tape measure from his desk. </p>
<p>	“Well I write with my right so-“ </p>
<p>	“Very good extend it for me will you?” He cut me off and I did as I was told he began to measure my arm and hand in various locations. Until he reached my shoulder at which point he let go of the tape measure and turned to go into the shelves muttering to himself. The tape measure however didn’t fall to the ground like one would expect it simply just kept measuring me. </p>
<p>	I watched it curiously the wandmaker having disappeared among the shelves of wand boxes. He reappeared moments later with a box in hand. “Um sir?” I glanced questionly at the tape measure that was measuring the length of my forehead. </p>
<p>	“Ah sorry” he waved his hand and the measure retreated back to his desk “it tends to get a little over zealous sometimes.” I nodded as if I understood however I simply did not. “Now I believe this one will be the trick” He handed me a light tan wand with beautiful carvings running up it. I took it in with astonishment. “Well have a try.” He encouraged. </p>
<p>	I, not sure what to do, gave the wand a slight swipe to the side. A paper weight that moments ago had been firmly planted on the elderly man's desk went flying down a row of shelves followed by a crash and the sound of wood splintering. </p>
<p>	“Sorry” I murmured as the man took the wand from my hand still staring after the paper weight. </p>
<p>	“I don’t believe this is the one” he sat the wand on his desk and disappeared into the shelves again. I could hear him muttering and tried to lean forward to see where he had disappeared to but he quickly re-emerged. A new wand in tow. “Alright let’s try this one” he opened the box and presented me with a sleek black wand that was shorter than the previous one but no less spectacular. </p>
<p>	I moved this wand in a flowing motion making a small circle. Ollivanders chair promptly went spinning and clattered on to the floor. The wandmaker removed this wand from my hand. “Ah well let’s try again” he entered the shelves again but this time he wasn’t out of view yet when he stopped and turned back to look at a shelf right behind his desk. He slowly approached the shelf and pulled a very dusty box from it. Looking at it skeptically then looking at me then looking back at the box. </p>
<p>	“I would never have thought” he murmured so lightly if we weren’t the only ones in the shop I never would have even known he had spoken. The man walked over to me and pulled out the wand slowly. This wand was far simpler than the other two. It had no decorative carvings or sleek finishes. It was gray and held the aged lines of regular wood as decoration. It was longer than either of the other wands and was formed in the shape of an elongated teardrop. With a round smooth end that descended into a point. </p>
<p>	Slowly the wand maker extended it to me. The moment my hand touched the wood I felt a great surge of warmth and I felt as though the entire alley was filled with flames. Not to destroy anything or burn but just simply to warm. I smiled happily as I saw the man do the same. </p>
<p>	“I believe we have found the perfect wand for you” he declared. “Funny, that wand there has been the stubbornest of wands I believe I’ve ever had in this shop. Surprising since its core is that of dragon heartstring. But the Ash it is carved from and it’s length of a dramatic 14 inches make a large counterbalance to negate the more accepting nature of it’s core” </p>
<p>	“A wand can be stubborn?” I asked bewildered. </p>
<p>	“Indeed you see my dear girl the wand chooses the wizard. And that wand which I might add is very old wand. Having been here for many a century. Has only ever chosen one wizard and that my dear is you.” </p>
<p>	I looked closely at my wand. It was so simple but I could feel the power within it. “It’s incredible sir” I told him.</p>
<p>	“Indeed and I believe it a sign we can expect incredible things from you as well my dear” the man smiled. </p>
<p>	“Thank you sir” I looked up at him gratefully as he chuckled happily. I paid him and hurried out of the shop finding my mother standing outside double checking the bags to make sure she definitely had everything this time. “Mom! Mom! Mom! Look at my wand isn’t it amazing” </p>
<p>	I cheered holding it up so she could see. “Quite my dear” she smiled at it “and long to, my goodness.” </p>
<p>	“It’s 14 inches, made of ash, and has dragon heartstring at its core” I informed her repeating what Ollivander had told me. </p>
<p>	“Wonderful. Now why don’t we head over to your grandparents shop for some cookies before we go home” She suggested. </p>
<p>	I nodded vigorously as we hurried along. That day was incredible it felt like I was walking on air. I had a wand and a pet owl and all the supplies I needed for wizard school. After seeing my grandparents who were thrilled to hear I was a witch and would be attending Hogwarts we went home. The next day after that I climbed into the attic and found my mom’s old broom and took it outside to give it a whirl. </p>
<p>	Mom had tried to coach me on how to use the broom. I however was to excited at the prospect of actually flying to remember much of what she said. When I first took off I felt my heart go soaring. It was like my biggest wish coming true a sense of weightlessness and wind blowing through my hair. It was the most wonderful feeling I had ever felt to just fly.</p>
<p>	Unfortunately it only lasted a few seconds as moments later I had accidentally steered myself into the great oak tree that sat outside my window. My mom had looked me up and down and fused over me for fifteen minutes straight checking me for cuts and bandaging the bloody gash I had on my leg. I however didn’t mind the scraps as I was mourning the now split in half broom that was rendered inoperable. </p>
<p>	Two boring horribly normal months later and I was getting out of the car at Kings Cross station with my mother and all my school supplies about to leave on the biggest adventure of my life.</p>
