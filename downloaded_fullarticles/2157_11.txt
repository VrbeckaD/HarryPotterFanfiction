    <p>It was that damned demon.<br/>

All he'd wanted was a normal exorcism, and this sonofabitch had decided to blast him god knows where. In the middle of some fucking woods! In the middle of the night.<br/>

He moved through the trees. This place had a really magical feeling, and he was moving towards the epicentre. Hopefully, he was still in his world, or this was gonna be hard.<br/>

An arrow shot into the tree right by his head. He moved back, searching for who's tried to kill him.<br/>

Was that a centaur?!<br/>

"Hey there, chap." he greeted. No reason to not be friendly, especially since there was another arrow pointed between his eyes. "I think there's been a bit of a mix-up-"<br/>

"Silence!" The centaur roared. "Who are you?"<br/>

"You can't have both!"<br/>

The centaur was not amused. "Who. Are. You."<br/>

"John Constantine. Exorcist, demonologist, occasional master of the dark arts, master warlock. Who might you be?"<br/>

"I am Ronan!"<br/>

"Ronan.. the centaur..." his eyes widened. Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit... "We got a big problem. So... here's what gonna happen; I'm gonna leave, go that way, you won't kill me and I won't kill you. Then I'll talk to Dumbbell and sort this out. Okay?"<br/>

Ronan shook his head. "No. You will explain why you're in my woods."<br/>

"I don't mean to be in your bloody woods!" Constantine shouted. He reached other his pocket, pulling out a box of cigarettes and lighting one.<br/>

"How do you get into the woods without intending to?!" Ronan was getting agitated, and he could hear other centaurs on the way.<br/>

"Great. Absolutely bloody marvellous," he growled. Well, a simple shield spell, and he just walked away.<br/>

He was surprised when the centaurs let him leave.</p><p>It took two hours for him to get to the castles, and another to cross that huge fucking yard. That was after he crossed a lake. The spell for that hadn't worked as well as it normally did, so he was soaked to the bone and bitter. On the bright side, the sun was rising, and he could sense people in the castle waking up.<br/>

Let's see... last time, he'd met Dumbledore in the Great Hall, so he'd try that. They'd left the bloody front door unlocked, so he strode in and tried to find it. That resulted in getting lost twelve and a half time times and encountering countless students. Which he was annoyed by. He had something to do, he couldn't stop to answer questions.<br/>

What was fun was breaking up a duel by turning two magic wands into carnations.<br/>

Eventually, he burst into the Great Hall. "Albus!"<br/>

Before he even got halfway to the big table, a tiny woman in all pink with a really annoying voice stopped him and demanded to know who he was.<br/>

"Well that ain't bloody important, now is it?" he growled annoyed.<br/>

"How did you get in here?"<br/>

"You left the bloody door open-"<br/>

"You much leave at once!"<br/>

"Alright, that's enough of you." he snapped, turning her into a snail. "Don't go anywhere."<br/>

He glanced around the room as if to say 'anyone else' before going up to the staff table. "Dumbledore, we have a problem."</p>
