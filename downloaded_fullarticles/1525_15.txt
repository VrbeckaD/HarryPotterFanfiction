    <p>The  Auror team edged towards Draco Malfoy as if he was an angry hippogriff that was not to be trusted and always ready to claw your eyes out at a moments notice. It was a quiet morning at the Ministry of Magic and Draco had gone to far too many meetings already, signing papers and handing over repaired artifacts that he’d fixed for various departments.</p><p>“I’m sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Malfoy,” one of the younger Aurors said, putting on a brave face. “But we were wondering if we could have a moment of your time?”</p><p>Draco Malfoy wanted to say no. There were potions for Astoria that he had to check when he got home, delicate herbs that had to be added to them at an exact time and a hundred other things to do today. But the last time he’d seen that expression on someone’s face was during the war.</p><p>He turned around so that his silver trimmed robes slid across the floor with an expensive rustle.</p><p>“It’s just that…you knew Harry Potter when you were at Hogwarts,” the Auror continued.</p><p>“This is a well-documented historical fact,” Draco said, stifling the urge to ask if they could bother someone else that had known Potter at Hogwarts and at least had a different kind of history with him. Preferably the sort that didn’t involve Voldemort.</p><p>The group had a desperate look about them, lowering their eyes or clenching their jaws. They must have asked everyone else they dared to approach and been rejected. Still, most of them had to be fully trained or at least in the process of becoming Aurors. They shouldn’t have to look at him like he was going to dock points of their House if they came close. Or as if he was going to curse them.</p><p>Hadn’t he spent all his time since the War ended doing his best to undo what damage he could?</p><p>They lead him into a seemingly abandoned office. A small ferret was dozing in a basket in the corner and the faded carpet was dusty. Draco stared at the ferret, internally shaking off memories of flying through the air.</p><p> “He’s acting strange,” another Auror said, back straight and eyes flickering all over the place. “Sneaking around and writing down notes all the time.”</p><p>Draco could be measuring dried snowdrop petals at the local wizard farmer’s market or having a cup of tea at home by now. He could be deep-conditioning his hair, even.</p><p>But whenever Potter’s life went awry, his always did too. That was the story of his life.</p><p> So, he stayed where he was.</p><p>“And then there is the muttering,” the first Auror said. “He set a pair of mustard-colored socks he found in his desk on fire the other day.”</p><p>“That’s normal behavior,” Draco said. “Potter is a man that is happiest when he’s just sensed that someone’s out to kill him and he needs to find out what’s causing it. He’s so used to being in trouble that it comforts him.”</p><p>“He sleeps with his eyes open while leaning against a wall while on stakeouts,” an Auror said, opening the door and stomping towards Potter’s office. “Just take a look for us, please?”</p><p>“Fine,” Draco said.</p><p>Draco didn’t knock. He just opened the door to Potter’s office and walked right in.</p><p>Potter was sleeping with his head on his horribly messy desk, snoring with his eyes open and staring at the door.</p><p>Well, that wasn’t unnerving at all.</p><p>Potter didn’t wake up until Draco had transfigured some wood shavings on the floor into elegant spice racks and was nailing them to the walls.</p><p>“What is going on?!” Harry asked, sitting up and grabbing the edge of the desk, which was now much tidier than it had been two minutes ago. “Draco? What are you doing in my office?”</p><p>Draco glanced at him to make sure that there was no wand pointed at him, which was indeed true. Potter hadn’t even grabbed his table lamp in order to throw it at Draco’s head. That was a new level of exhaustion, right there.</p><p>Draco had stacked all those files into a neat heap, transfigured some broken quills into some ‘in’ and ‘out’ trays. Now he was arranging the standard healing potions on the spice racks. Aurors got hurt on the job, after all. Better to have those potions around rather than visiting St. Mungo’s every week for minor things.</p><p>“Working,” Draco said, inspecting the lilac liquid that should have been dark purple if it was to be more effective in healing bruises. “Do you know what office supplies are, Potter?”</p><p> Potter working in a neat office, Draco had reasoned, meant that he’d be less distracted by his own mess and therefore quicker to solve whatever problem he was dealing with. If that meant that Draco was currently throwing out dead plants and poking around uncorking unlabeled bottles so that he could live his life in peace, then so be it.</p><p>“You came in here to judge my potions?” Potter said, rubbing his eyes and almost dropping his glasses on the floor. Then he looked around his office, even scanning the air as if he was looking for flying paper birds. “And to re-decorate my office?”</p><p>“It’s my sole goal in life,” Draco said, leaving behind a tiny bottle of Draught of Peace on one of the spice racks. “Try not to die on the job, would you?”</p><p>“What?” Potter said, clearly still half-asleep.</p><p>“My son likes your son,” Draco explained very slowly as if he was speaking to a tiny child, knowing that it would annoy Potter since the boys had been friends for years now. He was rewarded with Potter making a face and crossing his arms. “You dying on the job would make him unhappy which in turn would make mine miserable. So.”</p><p>“Goodbye, Malfoy,” Potter said, grabbing the nearest file and opening it upside down.</p><p>Draco Malfoy left the office, was greeted with the sight of a bunch of Aurors giving him the thumbs up and just kept walking until he found himself in front of the fireplaces that would bring him home.</p><p> </p>
