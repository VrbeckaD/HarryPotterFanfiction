  <p>You may walk and you may run<br/>
You leave your footprints all around the sun<br/>
And every time the storm and the soul wars come<br/>
You just keep on walking<br/>
It's been this way from the start<br/>
Everybody walking round with holes in the heart<br/>
Everybody holding up skies in the dark<br/>
As the stars keep falling.</p>

</p><p>It was Macnair who bought the boy out of the ruins the battle had left of the venerable old Riddle House.</p><p>Of the five Death Eaters Lucius had sent into the crumbling fortress, Macnair was the only one to return. The others – Yaxley, Avery, the Carrows and one milk-faced neophyte whose name Lucius had never bothered to learn – had vanished as if swallowed up by the jagged remains of the elaborate oaken portals. Perhaps a ceiling had collapsed on them, or maybe they’d stumbled into one of the traps set by either side. Or possibly they had attempted to flee the battlefield, hoping against hope to slip past the Aurors who now, after the Order of the Phoenix had waged the actual battle, littered every inch of the hill with their presence and their Anti-Apparition Nets.</p><p>But Macnair returned, and at a distance, the bundle slung over his shoulder looked like nothing more than a spare set of robes. For an instant, Lucius felt a mingled stab of dread – and hope – that it might be the Dark Lord, escaping death through yet another transformation. </p><p>The pain that still gnawed at the inside of his lower arm, however, told him differently. The scorched remains of the Dark Mark had burned a fist-sized hole into skin and flesh that he'd provisionally closed over with a healing film. The first time the Dark Lord had fallen, the Mark had burned too, the green snake inside the skull turning black and eventually fading, but it had not damaged its bearers like this. Several of the younger Marked Death Eaters had not survived its flare. </p><p>No, the Dark Lord was dead. And now, Walden Macnair carried his killer out of the ruins of the battle.</p><p>When the ragged bundle hit the ground at Lucius' feet, it was hard to distinguish between black robes and hair, both equally covered with dust and grime. Only when Lucius rolled it onto its back with the toe of his boot did he recognise the boy underneath the dirt that liberally smeared his face. And the scar. </p><p>At first, he thought the boy was dead. None of the sprawled limbs moved, and the curse mark stood out on his forehead as if touched with a burning iron. But then the face twitched in unconscious pain, green eyes cracking open into slits, and a screech of rage tore through the subdued quiet. </p><p>Bellatrix Lestrange stormed forward, wand raised and aimed at the pitiful shell of a wizard. </p><p>"<i>Cru-!</i>"</p><p>Lucius intercepted her arm before she could finish the curse even though darkness mushroomed in front of his eyes for a moment when the pain of the scorched Dark Mark on his arm flared up again. Bellatrix hissed like a rabid cat, and Lucius held his own wand at the ready in case she should attack. Losing her Lord and her husband in the same battle had unhinged the already erratic mind of his sister-in-law to the point of outright lunacy.</p><p>"He killed our Master!" Bellatrix snarled, spraying Lucius' sleeve with saliva. "Vengeance will be ours at least!"</p><p>A look at Macnair's hard face told Lucius nothing about where the Executioner's own loyalties might fall. Of the few remaining adult Death Eaters, he, Bella and Macnair were the only ones still in fighting condition, and Lucius knew that he had to establish his authority quickly.</p><p>"I found him in the Dark Lord's throne room," Macnair stated gruffly, fingers travelling up to touch his axe in its shoulder sheath. </p><p>Lucius' face twisted. "Snape?" he asked. "Greyback?"</p><p>"I saw Snape's corpse." Macnair's mouth thinned, but he didn't elaborate. "Of Greyback, not a sign."</p><p>"And our Lord?" interrupted Bella, voice hoarse.</p><p>Macnair shook his head. "There was no body – only debris." The coarse face hardened further. "And his wand. In pieces."</p><p>Bellatrix's cry of fury sounded remarkably like a sob, and Lucius had to grab her wand arm again. "He dies!" she spat.</p><p>"There are Aurors everywhere!" Lucius snapped at her, aware that his words were primarily for Macnair. "The only reason they haven't attacked and overrun us yet is that they're waiting for all their reinforcements to come in. And there are <i>three</i> of us, with a handful of wounded and children." The haphazard wards thrown up around the graveyard wouldn’t hold the enemy for more than ten minutes once they finally decided to break them. Faced with two confused faces, he spelled it out. "Potter – alive! – is our only bargaining chip. Our ticket to freedom, Bella."</p><p>"Freedom?" Bellatrix's howl of outrage was so ear-splitting that even Potter, who had slumped back into unconsciousness on the ground, creased his forehead in unconscious pain. "Our master is <i>dead</i>!"</p><p>"But we are not," Lucius pointed out, enunciating very clearly. "Our children are not. And the Dark Lord would not want us to die in vain. He would want us to continue pursuing his goals in whatever way possible."</p><p>Never mind that the Dark Lord would most likely have expected them to die indeed, not giving a toss about anyone who survived his own demise. He’d never cared about anything but himself, Lord Voldemort.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Lucius saw Macnair nod, almost imperceptibly. Perhaps Bellatrix saw it too, for she closed her mouth rather than spewing forth further protestations. </p><p>It was amazing, in retrospect, how rapidly a battle four years in the planning had soured beyond hope. The giants, promised the free way of Britain by the Dark Lord, never came. Neither did Fenrir Greyback's werewolf pack, leaving the battle to the Death Eaters assembled in the Riddle House alone. To them, and to their immortal leader whose immortality backed out on him at the worst possible moment, it was hard to imagine that all those coincidences should have been engineered by the slip of a boy now lying at his feet.</p><p>Lucius grabbed Potter by the front of his robes and shook him until the tired green eyes snapped open.</p><p>“Our reinforcements – the giants – have you intercepted them?”</p><p>A bubble of spittle forms on Potter’s lips before words make it out. “Not coming. Hagrid… challenged their Gurg Golgomath. Won. Commands them now.”</p><p>Lucius' fingers tightened around Potter’s collar. “The werewolves?”</p><p>The boy’s mouth curled up in a ghostly smile at that. “Remus Lupin swore he’d take the pack away from Greyback, for what he did to him as a child.” He coughed, a convulsion that was rattling his entire thin frame. “There’s nobody coming, Malfoy.”</p><p>"Who's out there?" Lucius asked, hard. "Who's commanding the Aurors?"</p><p>Potter shook his head. It looked less like refusal and more as if the boy was trying to jog his thought processes. A milky film spilled across the usually clear, defiant eyes. His face twisted in pain.</p><p>Lucius drew his wand. "<i>Ennervate</i>!"</p><p>The boy's limbs jolted, convulsed, and he whimpered, drawing his arms around his middle as if his insides were on fire. If anything, the milkiness of his pupils increased further. </p><p>Biting back a curse, Lucius pulled him upright again. "You blasted fool! What did you take?"</p><p>Potter's mouth moved twice before a sound came out, and Lucius had to bend his ear towards him to hear when he finally managed to speak.</p><p>"Coeur d'Empuis," Potter whispered through cracked lips, and Lucius barely managed to reign in the impulse to slap him, if only because it would knock Potter right out again. "Felix Felicis," the boy added after another pained swallow.</p><p>This time, Lucius cursed out loud. Coeur d'Empuis alone was a dangerous enough potion, allowing the drinker to focus his mind – and his magic – far longer, and far more strongly, than wizarding endurance would ordinarily permit. The price, of course, was utter physical exhaustion afterwards, or, in the worst case, a lethal breakdown. Not that Lucius hadn't employed the occasional sip himself, but to mix it with a second, even more volatile draught… </p><p>"Who's in charge?" Lucius hissed again, before Potter could black out on them once more.</p><p>"Scrimgeour… I think," Potter slurred, before his lids drooped and he collapsed in a heap of cloth and limbs in Lucius hands.</p><p>Disgusted, Lucius let him drop to the ground. He wasn’t in any shape to start on any of the difficult healing charms that could be employed to alleviate potions poisoning; they'd have to rely on the amazing resilience that had so far kept Potter alive despite Lord Voldemort's every attempt on his life. Hopefully, that resilience would hold true for a bit longer. Not that Lucius cared a whit whether the boy lived or died, but they need a <i>breathing</i> hostage. </p><p>He turned to his associates. "It seems I will be having a chat with the Minister for Magic, then."</p><p>"They're going to kill you," Bellatrix pronounced, sounding almost cheerful at the prospect. </p><p>Lucius shrugged dismissively. "I don't think so. Scrimgeour is a great one for protocol – in public. Still, if I should not come back…" He put a hand on his sister-in-law's wrist. "Have Draco use what he's been given by his mother. There might be hope for you after all."</p><p>Bellatrix stared at him, head cocked and with a deep frown on her pale forehead, but Lucius turned to Macnair and pointed at the insensible boy on the ground. "Make sure that he stays alive, Walden. And that he doesn't get lost."</p><p>Macnair nodded grimly. Lucius drew his black robes tightly around himself and walked the few yards over to where a marble mausoleum testified to the mortality of a Muggle family. From behind the cover of its walls, he could observe the ruins of the Riddle house, and the increasing number of black-clad figures swarming over the front lawns of the property. Most of the bodies littering the field had vanished already, while the remaining ones were being attended to by mediwizards. </p><p>Lifting his wand, Lucius sent his messenger galloping ahead, a flash of bright-white racing into the front yard like a Patronus. Yet Lucius' Patronus had never had such a slender body, nor such a glorious, spiralled horn. The unicorn rose on its hind legs and whinnied a shrill challenge at the Ministry wizards who whirled around to stare at it, before dissolving into a white mist that slowly faded.</p><p>Tense in the shadow of his hiding-place, Lucius waited. It took several minutes – during which Lucius almost started to believe that his offer of parley had been rejected – until a silver light pierced the creeping dusk from the tightest knot of Aurors on the Riddle lawn. Less defined than Lucius' unicorn, it whooshed over the grass, then faded quickly. </p><p>Two more measured breaths, and Lucius put his wand into his pocket holster and left his cover. Grass, still green but hardening under the August sun, crackled under his feet as he strode forward, out of the graveyard, onto the lawn, and towards the milling crowd in front of the house. His chest prickled from the angry stares he drew. It was a calculated risk, however. Rufus Scrimgeour might be as underhanded a bastard as any ex-Auror could be, but he wouldn’t break a wizarding parley in front of a hundred or more witnesses.</p><p>Lucius paused at a few feet's distance, taking in the scene before him.</p><p>Set somewhat apart from the Ministry people, he could see a handful of members of the Order of the Phoenix, crowding around a feather-bed stretcher over which the familiar form of Madam Pomfrey, Hogwarts' matron, was bent. Long, greying hair with black strands spilled down from it into the grass. Lucius had last seen Minerva McGonagall duel Bellatrix during the battle, and it seemed as if she'd come off the worse in that encounter. A handful of children were hovering around her, Potter's crowd most likely. A girl with dirty-blond pigtails was holding the Headmistress' pince-nez.</p><p>Then the crowd of Aurors parted and the leonine figure of Rufus Scrimgeour emerged, weathered face stern and not a hair out of place. A thin, bespectacled redhead – Weatherby Weasley, if he remembered correctly – followed him without looking at the Order crowd.</p><p>"You've come to surrender?" Scrimgeour presumed, speaking before he'd even come to a halt and managing to stare down at Lucius although they were of the same height.</p><p>Lucius allowed his mouth a twitch that signalled anything but amusement. "Not quite," he drawled.</p><p>"Your self-proclaimed Dark Lord is dead, your accomplices have been defeated, and the Dementors have returned into the fold of the Ministry." Scrimgeour's tone of cold disdain never wavered. "Surrender yourself and your fellow criminals, and your lives will be spared. The Kiss, however, will await everyone who spurns the Ministry's clemency."</p><p>"I am not asking for clemency, Minister." Lucius smiled without humour. "I am offering you a trade." </p><p>"Trade?" Scrimgeour repeated with an arrogant tilt of the head. "You are beaten – what could you possibly have to offer us?" </p><p>Lucius held the arrogant gaze pointedly.  "Harry Potter."</p><p>"Potter?" A frown started to mar Scrimgeour's lined forehead, matched by the shocked intake of breath on part of the Weasley assistant creeping around behind him. "Potter fell in the battle against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named."</p><p>"Not quite," Lucius repeated, if possible even more acerbically than the first time. "My... associates found him in the Riddle House. Alive – for now."</p><p>"Harry! He's alive?" The mere sound of Potter's name seemed to have drawn some of the Order members. The one crying out was the younger Weasley boy, the one Lucius had encountered before at the World Cup and later in the Department of Mysteries. Ronald, he recalled. Potter’s best friend. The Mudblood girl Granger – Draco's school rival at Hogwarts – was clinging to his arm. She stooped with her robes full of scorch marks and her hair a bird's nest, but was clear-eyed. The Minister's attaché stared, scandalised, as his brother interrupted the Minister for Magic.</p><p>"Nothing but a last-ditch attempt at saving their Death Eater hides," Scrimgeour waved away the interruption.</p><p>"Would you like to ascertain the truth of my words with Legilimency, Minister?" Lucius suggested mildly.</p><p>For the first time, he saw anger breaking through the stony mask of Scrimgeour's face. Other members of the Order had come up behind the two youths now: a brawny Auror – Shacklebolt, if Lucius' memory served – and a doddering old man with a top hat who looked old enough to have been around to witness Dumbledore's duel with Grindelwald. No, the Minister did not like to be manipulated in front of others at all.</p><p>When Scrimgeour raised his wand with an audible snarl, Lucius pulled the image of Potter, alive but weak as a kitten under his hands, to the forefront of his mind. Scrimgeour's Legilimency ripped into his mind with no finesse and even less care, and it took all of Lucius' willpower not to stumble to his knees. The spell tore at him, rubbing bare the exhaustion and pain Lucius would have preferred to suppress, and the howling grief beneath it. After making sure Scrimgeour had seen what he needed to, he slammed his Occluding shields back into place. They wouldn't have been enough to withstand the Dark Lord, but they were sufficient here.</p><p>Sweat beaded on Scrimgeour's high forehead, and his eyes narrowed in anger. "What are your demands?" he snarled, unmindful of the little sigh of relief that escaped the Mudblood girl. </p><p>"A full pardon for the remaining wizards and witches who have fallen under the … pernicious control of the Dark Lord," Lucius stated.</p><p>"Out of the question!" Scrimgeour spat. "I have promised the wizarding public that no Death Eater will ever walk the streets of magical Britain again."</p><p>Lucius' opinion of Ministerial assurances expressed itself in a snort. "I am quite certain that the magical community would think it a small price to pay to ensure the return of the hero who slew He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named."</p><p>Scrimgeour's face closed as if a curtain was being pulled shut over it; a twinge of apprehension tugged at Lucius' stomach.</p><p>"No, Malfoy," the Minister said curtly. "The Ministry for Magic will not allow itself to be blackmailed."</p><p>"But... Harry!" the young Weasley cried, eyes almost comically wide. "You can't just abandon him! He defeated You-Know... Voldemort. They'll kill him!"</p><p>"I assure you that Mr Potter's safety is a top priority for me, Mr Weasley." Scrimgeour favoured the boy with a thin-lipped smile that didn’t come close to reaching his eyes. Lucius was well aware that the words were aimed at the adult Order members and the crowd behind Scrimgeour rather than at the boy. The Minister's expression became stern and superior when he turned back to Lucius. "Restore Mr Potter to us immediately, and you and your associates will be considered for... special privileges that can be reasonably offered. A full trial, improved prison conditions..." </p><p>The heaviness in the pit of Lucius' stomach increased. Perhaps he'd gone about this the wrong way, approaching Scrimgeour like your average head-blind Gryffindor. Fudge’s successor had nothing to gain from Potter's return. Dead, the boy would make for a perfect martyr; alive, he’d be a living nuisance and a rival to the Minister's power. </p><p>"Think, man," Scrimgeour added as if privy to Lucius' thoughts. "You can't be intending to throw away the lives of your son – your wife – for a bit of revenge!"</p><p>A part of Lucius that was way too close to the surface wanted to scream, wanted to whip out his wand and Crucio the man until they both went down in flames like those that had crowned Narcissa. Something of it must have been reflected in his expression, for Scrimgeour took a step back and the Aurors surrounding him raised their wands. With iron self-control, Lucius restored his features into their usual dispassionate mask. If Scrimgeour didn’t know about Narcissa, he didn’t need to find out now. </p><p>"I'd rather see my son die in battle than locked away in Azkaban," Lucius stated. It was no less than the truth. He had experienced two years of Azkaban – he would never return, and neither would he ever allow Draco to see the insides of those spray-drenched walls. "If, however, a solution for the children of Potter's generation can be found, I might be able to convince–" he ventured.</p><p>"There will be no exceptions for anyone who wears the Dark Mark or has fought for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named," Scrimgeour interrupted coolly.</p><p>By the look if it, the Weasley boy – and where were his parents, whose presence and influence might have made a difference? – was ready to yell again, but the Auror Shacklebolt put a hand on his arm.  </p><p>"Sir, if we attempt to exchange Potter for Malfoy here, it might–"</p><p>"No," Scrimgeour snapped. "I'll not have a wizarding parley in my name broken, and one of our oldest traditions debased." He spared the Auror a dismissive glance. "I think you should go back and tend to your mistress, Shacklebolt," he said with a nod towards the group clustering around Minerva McGonagall. </p><p>Lucius watched Shacklebolt’s jaws clench, but he didn’t respond to the barb.</p><p>"You can't leave Harry to die," little Weasley persisted doggedly, and judging from Scrimgeour's expression, the Minister's patience was starting to wear thin. </p><p>"Of course he can," Lucius threw in maliciously. "He just did."</p><p>"No! You always hated him because he refused to play figurehead for you!" The wand was in the boy's hand as quickly as any trained duellist's, and considering that it was aimed at Scrimgeour rather than at himself, Lucius had to admire the man's composure. </p><p>"Ron!" the older Weasley gasped in horror. </p><p>"Mr Weasley!" Scrimgeour boomed. "The strain of the battle must have addled your brains to draw against your Minister for Magic! I'm sure Mr Potter would <i>not</i> want to be responsible for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Death Eaters walking free once again." Behind the Minister, a group of Hit Wizards started to inch closer, a half-circle of wands aiming at the boy.</p><p>Just then the Mudblood girl groaned, grasped her stomach, and all but crumbled into Weasley's arms. Weasley dropped his wand to catch her, his expression torn between fear and rage. Granger's face was averted from the Minister, but Lucius could see her expression clearly: a fierce, calculated determination which – if it wasn't for her tainted blood – would have done a Slytherin proud.</p><p>"Your friend is injured, Mr Weasley," Scrimgeour said. "Take her to St Mungo's. There has been enough fighting today."</p><p>"Please, Ron," the girl whispered. With a curse, Weasley put his wand back into its sheath and wrapped his arm around Granger’s middle to hold her upright. </p><p>Shacklebolt stepped forward between the two youths and the hedge of wands. "I'll take her," he announced gruffly, drawing Granger up into his arms. "She needs treatment – and the magical community needs to learn of what has happened here today."</p><p>"They will," Scrimgeour threw in icily, and the Mudblood turned her head into the shelter of Shacklebolt's arms.</p><p>"Yes – we'll make sure of that," she emphasised in a very firm tone of voice. Her eyes weren’t directed at Scrimgeour but at Lucius, burning as intently as a brush of Legilimency. </p><p>There was a twin crack of Apparition and all three, Auror, girl and boy, were gone. </p><p>"You've heard our conditions," Scrimgeour pointed out briskly. "If you return Mr Potter to us immediately, unharmed, and surrender, you can expect a fair trial and as much leniency in confinement as the Ministry can promise."</p><p>"I shall... convey that to my associates," Lucius said sarcastically.</p><p>Without a nod of acknowledgement, he turned and made his way back towards the graveyard. His back was itching from all the eyes – and wands – he knew were following his progress. He was certain that Scrimgeour would keep a truce given in public, but some of the others might give in to their rage.</p><p>He had seriously misjudged the Minister, Lucius realised while the grass crunched under his boots and the gravestones started to loom closer. He'd expected Scrimgeour to jump at the chance of becoming the saviour's saviour. There had been bad blood between Dumbledore and the Minister, and rumours that Potter and Scrimgeour had never seen eye to eye, but obviously hostilities had gone far deeper than that. If there was time, Lucius might just wait for the Order and the Ministry to tear each other to bits. There was no mistaking that Granger and Shacklebolt were planning to do exactly that, but Lucius and Draco and the others had an hour at most before the Hit Wizards descended on them, Potter be damned. Probably far less.</p><p>"What kept you, man?" Macnair growled out of the shadows when Lucius rounded the Muggle tomb and stepped down into the little hollow they'd turned into their hiding place. </p><p>The Potter boy was lying at the Executioner's feet, cheek pressed into the grass, eyes closed and his limp black fringe covering his scar. He looked half unconscious again. The rope Macnair had used to bind his hands behind his back cut deep into his skin. </p><p>"What did they say?" Walden added, pessimistic hope evident in his face. </p><p>"They said no," Lucius snapped. "They don't <i>want</i> Potter back, well, not unless we all tag along and walk into our little cages in Azkaban like good pets in exchange for a 'fair trial'." </p><p>Bellatrix's shrill laugh rang across the little clearing. "Didn't I tell you, fool?" she cackled.</p><p>With a snarl of rage, Lucius pulled their prisoner to his feet. It took an "<i>Ennervate</i>!" to force the boy awake, and even then his eyes rolled in their sockets before alighting on Lucius without much comprehension. Lucius grabbed the front of his robes and shook him again. </p><p>"Your friends don't want you back, Potter," he hissed, pent-up anger finding its target. "They'd rather see you dead than strike a deal." He took great pleasure in watching the hurt that flickered through the dulling green eyes, in the way Potter's blood-stained lips tried to form a voiceless syllable of protest. The boy's face was wet, but whether from tears or cold sweat Lucius couldn’t tell.</p><p>"At least we get to kill him now," Bellatrix laughed. "Let's make him pay. For our Lord – for us!"</p><p>"No," Lucius retorted. "He'll be of more use to us alive."</p><p>Black hair whipped her shoulders as she shook her head forcefully. "Alive? We'll all be dead anyhow!"</p><p>Before Lucius could formulate his response, a movement from the mausoleum distracted his attention. Light glittered on white, and then Draco stepped away from the marble wall like a ghost. His absent, drawn face was without expression. He hesitated before coming to a halt before Lucius as if he wasn't sure whom he's seeing. Grey dust still clung to his robes, although his hands were scoured clean. He looked half mad, Lucius realised with a pang of anguish; not that it would have been surprising – watching your mother flare up and crumble to ashes in your arms would do that to a child.</p><p>Like a sleepwalker, Draco reached up to his neck and took out a silvery chain from under his robe. Lucius winced when his son just pulled until the chain stretched taut. Red lines appeared on the thin skin at the sides of his neck until the chain snapped. Draco held out his hand, and Lucius had no need to inspect the tiny silver whistle to know what he was holding – and what it meant.</p><p>"Mother gave it to me when she came to the Riddle House," Draco said in a small voice.</p><p>"It's the Spray Whistle!" Bellatrix breathed. "Isn't it, Lucius? My sister must have been mad to give it into the hands of a boy."</p><p>"Or prophetic." Lucius lifted the small thing off Draco's palm and felt a cold from the depths of the sea radiating from it. Then he let it drop again and closed Draco's fingers around it.</p><p>"You'll have to blow it, Draco," he said, resisting the urge to pull the boy into his arms to wipe the expression of distant pain off his face. He couldn't afford to show weakness, and Draco might crumble altogether if he tried. "Get the others," he told Macnair and Bellatrix.</p><p>"What <i>is</i> this thing?" Macnair growled. </p><p>Draco didn’t seem to hear, so Lucius turned his head to explain.</p><p>"It summons the Spray Coach." Seeing incomprehension etched onto the Executioner's face, he added, "They say that Nimue, the Lady of the Lake, Transfigured a sea sprite into a coach to carry her son Lancelot across the sea from Brittany to England when he desired to fight for Arthur Pendragon. Centuries later, our ancestor Perseus Malefoi came into possession of the whistle. When he came to England, his arrival in the Spray Coach so impressed the head of the Wizengamot that he made him his chief advisor. The Spray Whistle will serve wizardkind three times before the sprite reclaims his freedom and return to the sea. My family has preserved the third request ever since."</p><p>"And that coach thing – it will carry all of us?" Macnair asked doubtfully. </p><p>"All of us and more," Lucius nodded. "It is elemental magic. Now go and get the others, please – we don't have much time."</p><p>Lucius nudged Draco's shoulder gently, and moaned inwardly when the boy turned it over as if to wonder what such a thing might be used for. Watching Walden and Bella retreat towards the marble mausoleum where the survivors lay hidden, he touched the knuckles of Draco's hand. </p><p>"Blow it," he repeated.</p><p>Finally, Draco lifted the whistle to his lips, never even wincing at the cold. </p><p>There was no sound. Not even the wind crackling in the dry grass disturbed the quiet. And then came a rush, a gush of wind that tore at Lucius' hair, swirling and hissing with the tang of the ocean. An exuberant, uncontrollable shower of sea spray filled his nostrils with salt and wetted his cheeks. The carriage fell out of the August sky like chill incarnate, a green-grey thing that seemed bulky and made out of nothing at the same time, with oval, shell-blue wheels that dripped water and yet somehow managed to glide along seamlessly. Even knowing what to expect from the ancient tales heard at his great-grandfather's knee as a boy, Lucius had not quite believed in the existence of the coach until he saw it materialise before him. </p><p>Only one horse was harnessed to the Spray Coach, a wild, blue-green creature with a body as ghost-like as a Thestral’s, and yet insubstantial except for smouldering orange eyes glaring at them with evil intelligence. Spray curled around its slender head in a frothing mane, and curved over one shapely flank to spread into a long tail trailing its hind legs. It pounded the ground with an impatient, barnacled hoof that made no sound and didn’t bend the grass. Neither did the wheels.</p><p>With stiff fingers that wanted to recoil from the icy, shell-encrusted material that could be metal, wood or stone, Lucius pulled the door handle. The door opened with a wet smack, followed by a trickle of seawater flowing down the stairs. </p><p>Then he put his hand on Draco's back and led him into the coach. The cold, salt-laden air inside blurred, shifted for an instant, then solidified into opposite wooden benches. Lucius helped Draco to sit on one of the corner seats and wrapped his dusty cloak around the boy's shrunken shoulders. The whistle was clutched tightly in Draco's hand. </p><p>Lucius climbed out again to make room for Macnair, who was pushing young Vincent Crabbe ahead of him, the semi-conscious bulk of Andrew Goyle half-slung over his shoulder. On Goyle's other side, Marcus Flint, arms covered in green blisters, tried his best to steer the moaning Death Eater up into the coach. It was painful to watch. Crabbe and Goyle, fathers and sons, had always had his own and Draco's back. Losing young Gregory and Vincent's father would be hard to get used to. Flint was the only one who showed unease at the sight of the Spray Horse; Macnair was too hardy, and Goyle and young Crabbe seemed no more aware of their surroundings than Draco was.</p><p>Lucius turned to see Bellatrix bringing up the rear, her inky hair a moving shadow in the approaching dusk. Alone. </p><p>"Where is Rabastan?" he asked even as his eyes took in the fresh blood-stains on her sleeves. Her knife hung openly from her belt now, anchored by a scrap of black cloth.</p><p>"He won't come."</p><p>"Damn you, Bella!" Lucius ground out. He’d seen Rodolphus's body on the battlefield, his chest a mass of black blood and shattered bone, but Rabastan they might still have saved, if not his torn arm. There was no telling whether Bellatrix had believed Rabastan couldn't survive, or whether she’d wanted to make him her final sacrifice to Lord Voldemort's memory. Another piece of the past, gone. It filled his throat with bitter acid.</p><p>She threw him a mocking smile as she climbed past him into the coach, probably only too aware of how badly he wanted to drag her back outside and break her neck. </p><p>From the hill beyond, voices were now approaching; it was time. Lucius bent down to drag the unconscious heap that was Potter off the ground and lift it up. A Seeker's build indeed – he was light as if he had bird bones or as if the Dark Lord had sucked half the substance out of him before surrendering to death. Lucius' mouth twisted. Perhaps the desperately frail creature could be made to serve a purpose after all.</p><p>He hurled the boy through the carriage door and heard him collapse on the slick wooden floorboards like a wet sack of bones. Then he followed, squeezing himself onto the bench next to Draco that his associates had wisely left empty. </p><p>A deep breath and a look over the few heads who had survived the end of Lord Voldemort. Then he placed his hand over Draco's fingers that still held the whistle. </p><p>"Let's go."</p>
