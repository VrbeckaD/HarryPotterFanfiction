</p><p>Ginger tresses pulled back<br/>
Sea and sand waiting<br/>
A weekend to relax<br/>
Looking for her center</p><p>Auburn curls blown around<br/>
Books and briefs left behind<br/>
A weekend to forget<br/>
Looking for her path</p><p>Pale strands tangle together<br/>
Sprites and spirits calling<br/>
A weekend to center<br/>
Looking for her past</p><p>Jet locks hang down<br/>
Dreams and doubts come together<br/>
A weekend to bloom<br/>
Looking for her forgiveness</p><p>Amber eyes search the horizon<br/>
Giggles and games on the wind<br/>
A time to forget<br/>
Waiting for her friends</p><p>Whiskey eyes scan the cottages<br/>
Baubles and bubbles in the breeze<br/>
A time to reconnect<br/>
Waiting for her peace</p><p>Icy eyes twinkle at the sight<br/>
Laughter and love in the air<br/>
A time to remember<br/>
Waiting for her faith</p><p>Dark eyes flash in the sun<br/>
Food and friends on the sand<br/>
A time to forgive<br/>
Waiting for her hope</p><p>Swift feet cross the sand<br/>
Chasing bubbles in the wind<br/>
A moment to remember<br/>
Renewing her hope</p><p>Scarred hands dip in water<br/>
Chasing flashes in the sea<br/>
A moment to relax<br/>
Renewing her faith</p><p>Pale hands skim the surface<br/>
Chasing voices in the wind<br/>
A moment to rewind<br/>
Renewing her strength</p><p>Steady feet touch the sea<br/>
Chasing pebbles in the sand<br/>
A moment to reflect<br/>
Renewing her mind</p><p>Eight feet in the sea<br/>
Four voices in the wind<br/>
Two days to remember<br/>
One friendship made stronger</p></div>
