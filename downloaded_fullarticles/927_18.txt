    <p>The ballroom at Malfoy manor was silent. Torches flickered in sconces along the wall as moonlight filtered in through the windows illuminating the room. Dark figures lined the walls while the center of the room was left open. A lone figure was seated in the center. Lord Voldemort sat in a large throne-like chair. Curled around a chair leg, climbing up the back rested the body of a gigantic snake. No one moved except Voldemort who was slowly petting the top of the snake’s head. The group seemed to be waiting for something. After what seemed like hours, footsteps could be heard from outside the ballroom’s doors. The double doors burst open with a bang revealing a pair of people. A tall man with a billowing cloak yanked a handcuffed woman into the room. </p>
<p>"Ah Severus, so good of you to join us," hissed Voldemort, a cruel smile crossing his face. "And you brought a guest."</p>
<p>Severus Snape walked towards where Voldemort was seated, continuing to drag the young woman. A few feet in front of him, Snape stopped. With a final shove, he flung the young woman to the ground at Voldemort’s feet. </p>
<p>With a bow, Snape spoke, “The plan worked perfectly, my Lord.” </p>
<p>Voldemort laughed, “As I knew it would, Severus. She has become predictable, her compassion making her weak.” With a flick of his wand, the woman is dragged into a kneeling position. “You have done well, Severus. Lord Voldemort is pleased.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, my lord,” Snape replies with a bow. </p>
<p>“You shall be rewarded for this Severus. Lord Voldemort always rewards his devoted servants” </p>
<p>“Thank you, my lord,” Snape says again with another bow. </p>
<p>Voldemort gives a dismissive nod and rises to his feet. <br/>“Friends, tonight we have a guest amongst us. For many months, a plan has been in progress. Tonight, this plan has paid off.” </p>
<p>With another flick of his wand, the hood covering the young woman's face is thrown back. Gasps fill the room as the identity of the woman is revealed. </p>
<p>“Yes, my friends, it has finally happened. The Elemental has been captured”</p>
