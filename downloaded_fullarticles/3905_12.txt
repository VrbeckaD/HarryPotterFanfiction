    <p>The Portkey landed him on a hillside, knee-deep in fragrant, scruffy heather and feeling as if his stomach had been wrung out like a cloth. He took a few deliberate, steady breaths. Around him the other transfer students clutched their middles or leant on their knees trying not to throw up. The teacher who had accompanied them groaned and muttered to herself for a moment, then shoved the tatty disposable chopstick in a bag and started rounding up the eight students, shooing them down the hill towards the lake.</p>
<p>It had been early morning when they’d left Mahoutokoro, light still pale less than an hour after dawn. Here it was night - the sky was dark and clear, with a thin sliver of moon making up a small fraction of the light in the heavens, the rest of it stars. Jotaro couldn’t help but take a moment to look up at it in wonder, and then down at the lake, so clear and still this night that it reflected the stars back. And across the water, the castle, adding its own constellation of gold-lit windows to the spectacle. The air had a bite to it that was partly chill and partly something unseen, ancient and heavy in the way that Mahoutokoro was ancient and light. Strangely apprehensive, Jotaro felt for his wand inside his robes. His fingers brushed over the oak wood and tingled. It was as if it was excited to be here. He swallowed down a sense of unease.</p>
<p>“Phew… Beautiful, isn’t it?” said one of the other students, in red ninth year robes - which would make her a fifth year in Hogwarts, Jotaro supposed. He would be entering the first year, along with one other boy. It seemed strange, given he’d already been going to school for four years, but as it turned out, Hogwarts didn’t have a day school.</p>
<p>“That works out well for you,” his mother had said. “Everyone else in your year will be new too, so you won’t have any trouble settling in.” Jotaro had looked down at the application form dubiously, brush wavering in his hand, and Holly had smiled comfortingly. “You know, it’s completely up to you whether you want to go or not. This transfer does sound like a lovely opportunity for you. You’ll have a chance to connect with another side to your family, and learn lots of new things! But whatever you choose, know that I’m always really proud of you. And I’ll miss you lots and lots, whether you board at Mahoutokoro or Hogwarts.” She knelt down beside him and wrapped him up in a hug.</p>
<p>“You’re going to make me mess up my writing,” Jotaro grouched. Holly laughed into his shoulder. Part of him wanted to tear up the parchment and forget about it. None of his friends at school wanted to go anyway. But a deeper part of him had already made up his mind. Both for the reasons that his mother gave, and for another, secret reason. There was something wrong with his wand, and Hogwarts might be the only place he could find an answer. He sighed, and began to fill out the form.</p>
<p>It took about five minutes to trek down to the lakeside, where a boat just large enough for the nine of them waited on a small jetty. As they all took a seat, it moved off by itself towards the castle. A stray puff of wind sputtered ahead of them, fragmenting the water into countless shards of mirror. Behind, their wake rippled out like unfurling wings. Some of the older students murmured to each other in excitement. Jotaro stared silently out over the water, and checked that his wand was still in his robes, where he had left it.</p>
<p>A little further out, it looked like something was moving just beneath the surface, creating a strange indentation in the lake. Jotaro watched curiously as it began to move towards them. He glanced around - no one else seemed to have noticed it. He leaned out slightly, trying to get a better look. It continued to approach, and the ripple grew larger. It occurred to him belatedly that perhaps he should feel nervous, perhaps he should say something, but there was barely any time to open his mouth before the waters burst open and the air was filled with writhing flesh.</p>
<p>A couple of the students shrieked as two massive tentacles smacked down onto the boat, causing it to lurch violently. The teacher stood up and fired a hex at their assailant, but Jotaro already felt himself tumbling uncontrolled out of the boat. The next thing he knew, there was cold black water in all directions. </p>
<p>Heart racing, he clung to his hat, then let out a little air, trying to see which way the bubbles went. They scattered and danced in the churning water as the giant squid thrashed around, recoiling from the hex. Jotaro curled up as he was buffeted around. The movement briefly stopped and he found himself in a pocket of calm right beside the creature’s body. His lungs felt as if they were pounding on the inside of his chest. He turned his head to face it, and for a moment time seemed to stop as he came face-to-enormous-deep-black-eye with something monstrous and magnificent. And then without thinking, as he felt tentacles regather and reach around behind him, he pulled out his wand.</p>
<p>Almost as if someone else had grabbed his hand, he thrust it out at the beast with a wordless cry, the last of the air in his lungs rushing out in a single yell. From the tip of his wand burst an inhuman figure of ghostly purple light that arrowed through the water as if it were nothing and pummelled a fist straight into the squid’s maw. There was something that felt like a shockwave and an explosion of bubbles. In an angry flurry, the squid squirted a billow of ink and disappeared into the depths of the lake as quickly as it had appeared. Limbs flailing and lungs straining, Jotaro scrambled for the surface. </p>
<p>The ghostly figure was nowhere to be seen. The demon had returned to his wand.</p>
