    <p>Harry groaned as the sun hit his eyes. He went to move and found he had someone pinning his right arm to the bed. His body was wrapped around someone else. He didn't want to open his eyes, as he knew he was going to regret it if he did. He heard a groan and it was clearly a masculine groan. He wondered what exactly happened last night.</p><p>"It's too early for this and to be awake." The other one spoke, as he turned around to look to see who he was in bed with. "Potter?" He struggled to sit up. His body ached. "What happened?" He was at Hogwarts last night, he knew from the room he wasn't there or at Grimmauld Place. He was at the cottage by the Shrieking Shack. This was his regular room when he stayed after a long night in the Forbidden Forest or not being able to make it back to Hogwarts after being summoned by the Dark Lord.</p><p>"I have no idea, the last thing I remember was being in my kitchen at Grimmauld Place. I was going to make myself something to eat." Harry sat up and pulled Severus into his arms as he did so. He didn't get any resistance. He didn't want to let Severus go. </p><p>"The last thing I remember was walking from my lab to my quarters." Severus leaned against Harry's chest. He wasn't sure why he was so willing to let Harry hold him or allowing him to pull him into his arms. He felt safe and secure in Harry's arms. something he hadn't felt in so long. </p><p>"He had to do that stupid ritual we refused to do." Harry snapped. "That is the only way we would be so accepting of our new relationship." He looked down at his hand and he saw the bonding bands on their left wrists. He wasn't sure what it would mean for their future.</p><p>"I agree. We will have to go to Gringotts and figure out our new names." Severus said. "That ritual determines who is in charge and what our names will be." He looked over his shoulder at Harry. "I am going to assume I am the submissive since I feel as if I bottomed." He noticed the metal on his band, he knew he was going to be listed as the submissive one in the relationship. "The ritual goes by the size of the core of the individuals involved in the ritual, it takes into account if the wizards have reached their majority or not, regarding the cores. I don't think they check your core after you reached your majority. I think they did it before your birthday."</p><p>"How do you feel about all of this?" Harry asked, ignoring the comment about the cores, they could deal with it later. He was still trying to process what he was feeling. He knew Severus was better at controlling his emotions. He made a promise to himself to renew his attempts at learning Occlumency. </p><p>Severus didn't answer right away, as he began to review his memories. He wasn't going to talk about emotions, he preferred to leave emotions buried where they belonged. He went into his mind and tried to review his memories, but his memories didn't go past hearing the stunner coming at him from behind the armor he had just passed. "He got me with a stunner, from behind. I don't remember beyond that."</p><p>"I can't either." He was quiet as he thought again about last night. "It was Granger for me, she got me as Weasley stepped in front of me, blocking me from going to the stairs." Harry inhaled deeply and slowly let out his breath. "Why didn't they just accept our no?" </p><p>Severus felt Harry's arms around his waist tighten as he tried to move away. He stopped moving and instead accepted Harry's positioning of his body against his. He didn't like how comfortable this felt. "I am trying to think of why? I mean what does it accomplish?" Severus wondered what the goal of Albus "Annoying Meddler" Dumbledore was.</p><p>"I believe they're hoping you would be in charge. Since you are in the Order and I refused to join, this is their way to making sure I did join and learned to listen to Dumbledore." Harry had refused on this seventeenth birthday to join the Order, he wasn't going to allow Dumbledore to control him. That was less than a week ago. Severus hadn't been at that meeting. They wanted to do ritual on them two days after he refused to join. He was surprised at how quickly they had come up with that ritual. Granger had to have been up for those two days researching for a way to control him. He refused to do it.</p><p>"It appears as if Ms. Granger's research skills didn't reveal everything to her know it all nature everything there was to this ritual, I don't think Dumbledore understood it either." Severus pulled the covers up to his chest. "If they had actually read the smaller details they wouldn't have used it." He knew they wouldn't have used the ritual if they had known. He hadn't even heard about the ritual until yesterday when he refused to also do the ritual. They had come to him seeking a potion to gain control over Harry for them to do the ritual with Severus permission. Severus had spent a few hours reading his own books concerning the ritual and was thankful he had declined. He bet Granger only used one book, as usual.</p><p>"What did they miss?" Harry used his magic to pull the shades in the room, making it darker in the room. "The sun is too bright." He had seen Severus closing his eyes a few times to avoid the brightness of the room. He, himself, had a slight headache from the ritual and knew that Severus must have one too. </p><p>"It's because of the ritual." Severus stopped, he wasn't sure how to tell Harry what the ritual had actually done to them. He wasn't sure what Dumbledore was going to do once he found out, but they would have to deal with it when he did find out. "Harry, we're vampires now." He waited for a reaction. He wasn't sure how to handle it exactly but he wasn't upset about it either.</p><p>"I am not sure why but I am feeling very accepting of it." Harry told him finally. He did feel different, he was wondering what else was going to be affected by this ritual that was done to him. He also was wondering why they were both accepting of this new arrangement. Neither of them was known for accepting change and they were rather well known for their tempers and their mutual hatred. </p><p>"The minor details that they missed, besides turning us into vampires, is the change we will experience in our brains. We will have a better retention regarding what we read and do, our muscle memories will be able to process things faster. So learning new spells or even our fighting skills will increase. We will have the vampire normal traits but also more than the extra strength or speed. We will have all the benefits none of the defects. Daylight won't bother us, neither will garlic or stakes. The ritual was banned because of the minor details that those two missed. Our cores will be bigger and you will able to access mine, you can actually control my magic, from restricting it to allowing me access to spells, rituals or even performing magical bonding between the two of us. I believe they were hoping I would be controlling yours. That ritual mentions the controlling aspect numerous times, in the book that they used. It talked about how the dominant one would have all the control, from being able to even restrict movement, ban practices and places that the submissive one could go. It's worse than an Absolute Contract in that the submissive must obey and doesn't have a choice. The submissive will want to obey and please his dominant. I can feel that aspect already."</p><p>Harry didn't know what to say concerning what Severus would have to endure now. He made a mental promise to keep Severus safe and protected. "If I am understanding this correctly, they were hoping that you would be the dominant one and by using the Order and the Vows you have taken, to control each of us. As you would be in charge and they would be able to use you to control me. Forcing me to do things against both of our wills, in a way and because I would aim to please you, I wouldn't mind it. Dumbledore would use guilt on you and the threat of the mark formerly on your arm. We will have to make sure he doesn't know it's now gone." Harry wanted to kill them. His rage came forth but he was able to control it. He closed his eyes for a few seconds and inhaled Severus' scent. He wanted to lay Severus down and enjoy the pleasures that he would bring from Severus. </p><p>"Yes. I believe you will also have no problem with Occlumency now. No one will be able to enter our minds, well you will be able to enter mine. There is another side effect that I don't think they missed, as we get closer, we will be able to feel each other, speak to each other over great distances. I do think they saw this and it's another reason why they used it, you will be able to track me, find me any place. I believe they are hoping that when they forced you to fight the Dark Lord, I would be able to find you and they could get the praise for killing the Dark Lord, while they made sure neither of us would leave the battlefield." Severus had heard Dumbledore and his cronies speaking and knew they had been stealing from Harry and him. </p><p>"They want to cover up their stealing from us. Yes, I know about it. I visited the goblins about two months ago. I was going to actually submit the changes this week regarding the Ministry. I made a lot of changes and they would not have been happy with them. I also wanted to make changes to my seats. I didn't want to do it so soon to the start of school, but also enough time to let Rita have her fun." Harry nuzzled into Severus, who arched up in pleasure. </p><p>"Harry, we need to think." Severus was trying to ignore the pleasure he was feeling. He wasn't sure how long it would be before the Order would arrive and expect them to follow along with their plans.</p><p>"Yes, I know, they will be here soon. We need to dress and get out of here. Take your shower first, as I fear if I join you, we will take more time than necessary." Harry released Severus, allow the man to move away from him.</p><p>Severus got up. "Ward the room, in case they arrive." Severus headed for the en suite bathroom.</p><p>"I did the whole cottage as soon as we woke." Harry answered. "I will get out our clothes. If we have to I will call one of my elves to get us out." He got out of bed after watching Severus disappear into the bathroom. He wasn't sure what or where they would be going after this but there was no way they were going to be returning to Hogwarts unless they had to. He glanced over his shoulder to the bathroom and got an idea. He was hoping Severus would agree to it. </p><p>_____________________________________________________________________ ____________________</p><p>They quickly made it into Gringotts, they didn't want to take a chance that some of the Order members would see them or try to interfere. "Harry." </p><p>Harry turned at looked at Severus. He could feel the fear that man was suddenly feeling. "What is wrong?" He glanced around, making sure that no one was approaching them. </p><p>Severus looked behind them also. "I heard apparitions, someone will be coming for us." He knew that Dumbledore had his spies in Diagon Alley. </p><p>"I know, that is why we won't be leaving out of the front door." Harry took his arm and started to guide Severus to the line forming for speaking to the tellers. He could feel the fear going down in Severus. </p><p>"Harry, I believe we need to speak to a certain person as soon as possible." Severus whispered. Severus wanted to get far away from Dumbledore and his Order.</p><p>"I already thought of that and I agree fully." Harry knew the Dark Lord would enjoy his ideas and he wanted to get even with Dumbledore.</p><p>Before they could move forward, one of the goblins walked over to them. "If you could please follow me, Lord Potter." </p><p>"Griphook, how nice to see you again." Harry remembered the goblin from his first time in Gringotts. </p><p>Griphook was surprised, usually, wizards didn't know which goblins were which. "Pleasure, Ironclaw is waiting for you, we have been expecting you."</p><p>Severus whispered, "they have real seers, not like that fake we have at Hogwarts." He was sure they were going to learn some interesting information if a seer warned Ironclaw.</p><p>"Let's go and meet Ironclaw, I am sure we will find some very interesting information." Echoing Severus' thoughts. Harry placed his hand on the small of Severus' back and they followed Griphook. </p><p>Griphook knocked and opened the door to Ironclaw's office. He stepped back and Harry guided Severus into the office. They froze as they saw who was sitting there in front of Ironclaw's desk. "Well, it appears we won't have to go looking for him." He told Severus quietly.</p><p>"Indeed." Severus replied as they started at Lucius Malfoy next to the Dark Lord, who was clearly waiting for their arrival.</p><p>"Lord Potter if you and your husband could take a seat, we have a lot of information we need to cover." Ironclaw pointed to the two empty chairs in the room.</p><p>They moved to their seats. The Dark Lord and Lucius remained quiet, as Ironclaw started to speak. "The first thing we will need to start is an Inheritance Test, the ritual that Dumbledore forced on you, changed a lot of things. Our Seers have advised us to bring Tom Marvolo Riddle, known as the Dark Lord Voldemort and Lord Lucius Malfoy here for this and what will follow afterward." </p><p>"We wanted to speak to them, this just saves us some time." Harry looked at the Dark Lord and Lucius, they clearly weren't expecting him to be so calm about it. He could see they were wondering what ritual was used on them.</p><p>Ironclaw began to bring out the bowls, crystals and two silver knives for the Inheritance Test, he pulled two pieces of parchment out of his top drawer and laid them in front of the bowls. "I need you to add three drops of blood into the bowls. I will put the crystals into the bowls and when the crystals absorb all of the blood and essences in the bowl, I will place the crystals on the matching parchments."</p><p>Severus and Harry picked up the knives and dropped three drops of their blood into their respective bowls. Ironclaw put the crystals into the bowls, they watched the crystals absorb the blood and other elements that the ritual bowls had in them for the test from parts of a plant to oils. When the crystals went from clear to a deep green, Ironclaw removed the crystals and laid them on the parchment. "We will do Lord Potter's first."</p><p>Harrison James Riddle Black Potter (Legal Name) Birth 31 July 1980<br/>

</p><p>They could feel the anger flood the room. The Dark Lord looked ready to kill someone, while Harry was still holding the piece of parchment, anger flooding the room from both men. "I will wrap that man's beard around his throat until it looks like a thick scarf, pull it tight. No, I will put him in a mound, drip honey on his head and allow ants to feast on him. No, I will-" </p><p>"Harry, please calm down." Severus touched his arm. "Please." He quietly told him. He was worried about the magic flooding the room. He was surprised how oppressive the magic felt. </p><p>The Dark Lord rose from his seat and wrapped Harry in his arms, pulling him back into his seat. He held Harry in his lap. He used the family magic of the Slytherin line and wrapped it around them as they each dealt with this new knowledge. It explained why the curse failed. Slytherin line prevented the heirs from being killed by family members, especially the father. </p><p>After twenty minutes or so, the Dark Lord loosened his hold. "Harry?" He looked down at his son. The son he had spent months looking for. He had found Reggie dead and their child missing on the 31st of July.</p><p>"I am in control." Harry responded. "Can you release me?" He wanted to finish this, he needed to learn more of the truth. </p><p>The Dark Lord released him, and Harry stood up and retook his seat. "Can you please explain what all this means for me?"</p><p>"We will discuss the titles after I explain a few things." Ironclaw sighed, he wasn't looking forward to telling them this next bit of information. "It means the prophecy that Dumbledore has placed so much believe in, is debunked. It bears no meaning concerning anyone now. He avoided it by trying to force it to be reflective on you instead of who it was meant to regard. It was originally meant for Neville Longbottom. However, between the ritual that was performed on him as a child, and the forcing of using Lord Potter, it has been voided."</p><p>"What ritual was performed and how is it now voided?" The Dark Lord stated. Who would perform a ritual on a child to change a prophecy? What kind of idiot would do that? Well, duh, it's Dumbledore they were speaking of. He would do anything to stay in charge.</p><p>"Mr. Dumbledore, with Lady Augusta Longbottom's permission, used our ritual room to strip most of Heir Longbottom's magic. He convinced Lady Longbottom it would protect her grandson. She agreed, especially when she heard it could between her grandson and Harry Potter concerning the fulfillment of the prophecy. Mind you, this was before the Potters' death. Frank and Alice Longbottom didn't know about the ritual." Ironclaw explained. "When he changed the date of Lord Potter's birth, and after the Magically Restriction Ritual was performed, he forced the prophecy to be focused on Harry Potter. We also know he wanted you to hear it only part of it, allowing you to believe that with the change of birthdays and times, Harry Potter would be your target." </p><p>"So because Dumbledore forced it, it nullified it?" Lucius could see that everyone was trying to control their anger, granted it never really had fully gone away but hearing what the old man did was making them all angry. Knowing that he caused so many to die for the simple reason of forcing a prophecy to come true was sickening.</p><p>"Yes. Prophecies don't always come true, they are meant as a warning, a guide to help the future in some cases, but they aren't meant to be understood until after they have been fulfilled. He forced it to his own meaning, changing it." Ironclaw explained. </p><p>"He killed my husband and stole my son, to force this prophecy to what he wanted, he then did this new ritual on my son and Severus to continue forcing it?" The Dark Lord wanted to go and kill that old man. He felt Harry's touch his arm. He looked at him and calmed down. There was much more that needed to be done and processed before they could go after Dumbledore. </p><p>"Yes, he seems determined to have the two of you fight each other." Ironclaw answered. "We believe he is unaware he is your son, we believe that he knew it was Mr. Black's son. When the Potter's arrived for the blood adoption ceremony, they weren't aware of who the parents were and he talked them out of doing an Inheritance Test on Lord Potter."</p><p>"He wants all of us to die together in a final battle, to keep control over the world. He was counting on Severus being in charge and forcing us into a final confrontation. It why he used this ritual, however, Severus pointed out something, he didn't read the small details. Granger has a habit of only using one book when it comes to research, especially if it backs up what she believes is the truth." Harry touched Severus' hand, gave it a quick squeeze before moving his hand back to his lap.</p><p>"Ms. Granger and him relied on one book for their information on the ritual, they didn't have enough time to research it because they needed to use the full moon." Severus explained. "They didn't look at what the smaller details of the ritual were. They also didn't bother to make sure that Harry's core wasn't bigger than mine after his seventeenth birthday. They relied on the test of it before his birthday, the one that Poppy takes on every 5th and 6th year, so they can be prepared for anyone magical maturity."</p><p>"Now we have a failed prophecy, two forced rituals and I am assuming since we are here there is more information we aren't going to like?" The Dark Lord looked at his son, the boy was powerful during his fourth year, and now he had an increase because of reaching his majority and another increase because of the forced bonding ritual.</p><p>"Correct, based on the information from our Seers, we began to look into all of your accounts, including Lord Malfoy's. In looking at them, we found a few interesting things, the biggest is beside the connection that Lord Potter has to Lord Malfoy's family based on the Black family, we found a marriage contract for Harry Potter to Draco Abarax Malfoy." </p><p>"What?" Everyone gasped. Harry pulled Severus to him. He wasn't going to marry or bond with Draco Malfoy. </p><p>"I never signed one." Lucius wasn't sure how this was going to work, there wasn't a legal contract that he knew of.</p><p>"No, your father did, which confused us, because it's dated before the birth of either of them, yet lists their names." Ironclaw added. He was hoping they went after Dumbledore and destroyed the man for messing with magic and the magical world.</p><p>"How can that possibly be?" Lucius asked. His father never mentioned anything about a contract. His father was ill for the last few years of his life and didn't leave the Manor.</p><p>"We researched it and found it to be a false one, we need the four of you to issue a magical declination of this contract." Ironclaw said. "It's one of the reasons we asked Mr. Riddle and Lord Malfoy to be here."</p><p>"He is going to pay." Harry mumbled. "What do we need to say?"</p><p>"I need you to say I, your name, contest this magical contract. I, your name, ask for Magic to judge this contract, if valid, will be fulfilled, if invalid, the ones who signed shall be punished. So mote it be." Ironclaw told them. </p><p>"I, Tom Marvolo Riddle, contest this magical contract. I, Tom Marvolo Riddle, ask for Magic to judge this contract, if valid, will be fulfilled, if invalid, the ones who signed shall be punished. So mote it be."</p><p>"I, Lucius Julian Malfoy, contest this magical contract. I, Lucius Julian Malfoy, ask for Magic to judge this contract, if valid, will be fulfilled, if invalid, the ones who signed shall be punished. So mote it be."</p><p>"What name do we use?" Harry asked.</p><p>"You would use Harrison James Riddle Black-Potter, your husband." Ironclaw looked at the parchment "is Severus Tobias Potter." </p><p>"I, Harrison James Riddle Black-Potter, contest this magical contract. I, Harrison James Riddle Black-Potter, ask for Magic to judge this contract, if valid, will be fulfilled, if invalid, the ones who signed shall be punished. So mote it be."</p><p>"I, Severus Tobias Potter, contest this magical contract. I, Severus Tobias Potter, ask for Magic to judge this contract, if valid, will be fulfilled, if invalid, the ones who signed shall be punished. So mote it be."</p><p>They watched magic circle around the contract. They saw the flow of colorful streams of magic swirl around the contract and suddenly burst into the air and disappear. Ironclaw looked down at the contract and grinned. "It was judged as invalid." He looked at them. "It will be interesting to see Mr. Dumbledore married to Remus Lupin and Alastor Moody. The others who signed it are deceased."</p><p>"Who else signed it?" The Dark Lord asked.</p><p>"Albus Dumbledore, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, James Potter, however for his name there is an indication of a potion and spell at work, Lily Potter, with the same indication as James Potter." Ironclaw answered. </p><p>Harry looked at his father and to Lucius. "How about we release the marriage contract, but keep everything hidden for now. On September first, we release the prophecy information, edited to suit our needs and desires. He still has too much power for us to attack him full on, but we can chip away at his power base." </p><p>"We still need to speak of your seats." Ironclaw stated.</p><p>Harry groaned. "Why do I hear more bad news in that tone?" </p><p>The Dark Lord agreed with that assessment. "Let's go through this information before we set a plan of action. I am sure Ironclaw will be providing us with a lot of information." </p><p>"You are correct. We have a lot of information to get through, including your son and son-in-law new status." Ironclaw responded. He was going to enjoy working with these four.</p>
