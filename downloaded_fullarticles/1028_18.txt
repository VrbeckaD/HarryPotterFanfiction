<hr/><p align="left">Just as John activated the experimental Frame/shift drive, he didn’t notice the blue tendril that hooked on from his original body and activated the drive, it was not a pleasant experience for the blue tendril because as soon as the Frame/shift drive powered down, it had just been knocked off by turbulence from atmospheric reentry and burnt up. This wasn’t the end for the hardy tendril but it wouldn’t be conscious for another few years.</p><p align="left">During the slumber of the tendril, a great many things occurred, from ‘direwolves’ appearing to Blacklight discovering beyond the stars, from lazy Wizards being found to a symbiotic relationship with Blacklight. And all this occurred while Bluelight sat in a Wizard’s plant pot idly biding it’s time and grew among the massive amounts of Em that the Wizard unknowingly outputted.</p>
