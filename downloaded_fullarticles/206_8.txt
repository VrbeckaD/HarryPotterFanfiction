    <p>Han Jee-Han frowned at the papers he was holding in his hands. These couldn't be right could they? These papers had arrived this morning for his mother but she was still in America so he'd opened them. They'd looked urgent and boy was he right. He couldn't believe this. The man he'd thought was his father all these years wasn't his father. His father was some man named James Potter. In a way it kind of made sense. The man he'd thought was his father had never been around while he was growing up and still wasn't around. He frowned hard as he looked through the papers again for the millionth time. He had a brother. The boy was four years younger than him. 15 to his 19. It said his name was Harry Potter and that this Gringotts bank was contacting them because the boy was looking for family. Jee-Han wondered if the boy was sick. Did he need blood or something? A kidney? Bone Marrow? </p>
<p>Jee-Han finally picked up his cell phone and called his mother. There was nothing for it he would have to confront her.</p>
<hr/>
<p>That conversation had not gone over too well. But, Jee-Han was not about to heed his mother's warning to stay away from his brother. No, he had a bad feeling. He had had it since he'd opened that letter. He'd checked his stats to see that everything was normal but he couldn't shake this feeling that his brother needed him. He was going to England and he was going to find his brother. </p>
<p>Shi-Yun had been easy to convince to come with him. She'd agreed to accompany him on his journey. </p>
<p>Sun-Il on the other hand had taken hours to convince. Jee-Han could understand why of course. Sun-Il was only imortal if he stayed in Korea if he traveled anywhere else he could be killed. Jee-Han had Gramps Sun-Oh to thank for Sun-Il finally agreeing to come. </p>
<p>His friends now with him they debated on the best mode of travel they could fly themselves but none of them had flown for eleven and half hours before and might tire out. So they decided on flying on an air plane instead. Either way it was an eleven and half hour flight and at least this way they could get some sleep on the way.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry Potter wasn't as stupid as everyone thought he was. He was actually quite smart or rather he liked to think that he was rather smart. So when his family had decided to spend the day in London after picking him up and he'd noted that they were close to Charing Cross road he'd made a deal with them. He'd leave them alone all afternoon and they remember to pick him up at a pre arranged meeting spot at eight that night. They'd easily agreed. </p>
<p>Harry had gone straight to Gringotts to get some money out only to be rushed into a private room and explained that they had been trying to get hold of him for years. Harry quickly jumped to the conclusion that he had an Owl Aversion Charm on him. He'd read about back in first year and had thought many times over the years that he might have one on him but he'd done nothing about it. His head was soon spinning with all the information they were giving him. He got some money out of his vault but had a bunch of paperwork that they wanted him to look over and sign. He'd put that in his backpack as it was in a folder that was spelled to be thin and weightless. He then went and got a magical mailbox for his mail. Something told him he would need it. He bought a few books and rushed to meet the Dursley's. </p>
<p>Once home and locked in his room he started going through some paperwork when he came across a birth certificate that wasn't his own. </p>
<p>
  <b>Han Jee-Han</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Father: James Potter</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Mother: Han Jung-Sook</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Age: 19</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Citzenship: Half Korean/ Half British</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Race: The Gamer</b>
</p>
<p>Harry frowned at the Race of his brother. Shouldn't that say Magical or Muggle or Squib? He found his own birth certificate</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry James Potter </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Father: James Potter</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Mother: Lily Evans Potter</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Age: 15</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Citizenship: British</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Race: Pureblood</b>
</p>
<p>He chocked on the drink he had just sipped. He was a pureblood? What the hell? He'd been told he was a half-blood what was going on here? But he'd been right about Race. Why was his brother called Gamer? He bit his lip. He'd always wanted siblings and here he finally had one. He wrote a letter to the Goblins asking if they could contact his brother on his behalf and sent it via his magical mailbox. Hedwig didn't seem to mind too much that he wasn't using her to deliver mail. The response came with in the hour that they had contacted his living family.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Twenty hours after finding out that he had a brother Jee-Han was walking on to Private Drive with Shi-Yun and Sun-Il. People were staring at them and whispering. </p>
<p>"It's got to be your hair." Jee-Han said, to Sun-Il. "They must not see a lot of people with green hair around here." </p>
<p>Sun-Il elbowed him. </p>
<p>"Here it is." Shi-Yun said. "#4 Private Drive." </p>
<p>They looked at her and nodded as all three approached the door. Jee-Han took a deep breath and raised his fist to knock on the door. </p>
<p>Just then a teenager came from around back carrying a heavy yard bag and looking like he might faint and some people got of the car that had pulled into the drive way. </p>
<p>"Can I help you?" the black haired teen asked. </p>
<p>"My name is Han Jee-Han I'm looking for Harry Potter." Jee-Han said, in English. "I'm his older half brother." </p>
<p>The black haired teen grinned. </p>
<p>"I'm Harry Potter." Harry said, brightly. "It's great to meet you, Jee-Han. I'd shake your hand but mine are kinda full." </p>
<p>Sun-il took the bag from him and carried it to the curb while the brother's shook hands. </p>
<p>"I didn't believe it at first but wow, here you are." Harry said. </p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this?!" Vernon Dursley demanded of his nephew. "Who are these forigeners? and what are they doing here?"</p>
<p>"Er......can I explain inside, Uncle Vernon?" Harry asked, "The neighbors are staring." </p>
<p>So everyone went inside and Harry made tea. He then showed his aunt, uncle and cousin the paperwork saying that he had an older brother he made sure all paperwork pertaining to his money was absent. </p>
<p>"We were told when we took you in that we were the only family you had." Petunia said, tightly. "Is he like you?" </p>
<p>"Am I what?" Jee-Han wondered, tired of being talked around. </p>
<p>"Uh.......well, see ......" Harry swallowed. "It's a long story." </p>
<p>"Well, lets talk about it on the way to the Hotel." Sun-Il cut in. </p>
<p>The Dursley's and Harry started in shock. </p>
<p>"The hotel?" Harry repeated. </p>
<p>"You're coming with us." Shi-Yun stated. </p>
<p>They had agreed on it shortly after seeing Harry. He was covered in bruises and had marks around his neck like he'd been strangled several times by many different things. His clothes were too large he was short for his age. They weren't about to leave him here. They hadn't even discussed it. </p>
<p>"Well, that should be okay." Harry said, more to himself than anyone else. He was frowning in thought. "As long as I'm with a blood relitive the wards should hold.......Yeah, okay, I'll go pack!" </p>
<p>"We'll help." Jee-Han said. </p>
<p>They followed him to the cupboard under the stairs. </p>
<p>"My school stuff is in here." Harry explained and got his trunk out. He tried to be quick but the three of them had seen inside and now knew that he had used to live there. "My room is upstairs." </p>
<p>They followed him to a room that had ten locks on the door and a cat flap. Harry went inside and began gathering everything including things from his hiding spot. </p>
<p>"Leave the clothes." Jee-Han ordered. "We'll get you knew." </p>
<p>Harry blushed but nodded. He ducked his head a bit but then looked at Hedwig. He bit his lip. </p>
<p>"I'd better write a letter to Sirius." he muttered and quickly wrote one. "Here, Hedwig, go to Sirius with this and wait for a reply. Peck his fingers off if you have to." </p>
<p>Hedwig nipped his ear took the letter and was off. </p>
<p>Shortly after Harry was leaving Private Drive. He could have sworn he'd saw the rippling of an Invisiblity Cloak and then he heard a loud bang. Harry frowned wondering what that was about. Had someone magical been watching him? and if so who were they going to report back to? Harry pushed it from his mind and focused on his brother. He couldn't believe it. He had a sibling and that sibling had taken him away from the Dursley's. He hoped that he never had to go back. </p>
<p>They were a good deal away from Private Drive when they stopped and Jee-Han made Harry's things vanish. </p>
<p>"Eh." Harry cried. "Where did they go?" </p>
<p>"Don't worry, little brother." Jee-Han smiled. "They're in a safe place. I'll tell you about later but for now......tell me do you like to fly?" </p>
<p>"More than anything!" Harry said, brightly. </p>
<p>Harry cheered when they were suddenly in the air. His brother was holding him around the waist at his side like it was nothing and Harry was having the time of his life as they flew towards London. This felt so much more amazing then flying on a Hippogriff or even a broom. This was freedom. Harry wondered if his brother would teach him how to fly like this if he asked. He wondered how all three of them could fly like this. Was it some form of highly advanced magic? Could Dumbledore fly? Could Voldemort fly? He frowned at his own thoughts then just let his mind wander as they flew through the sky.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Jee-Han had wondered if flying with his brother had been a smart thing to do but he hadn't wanted to take a cab as he still wasn't sure if his money would turn into the local currency or not. He needed to test that out. One look at his brother and he'd knew that he'd done something his brother had loved. He could tell the younger teen was excited by the sparkling excited eyes, flushed face and wind swept hair. He swore to himself that if he couldn't teach his brother to fly on his own that he would take him flying whenever he wanted because it was clearly something Harry enjoyed doing. </p>
<p>They checked into their suit not far from Charing Cross Road, got something to eat from  room service, and then began telling each other about thier lives. Harry confessed to being a wizard and having magic but told them that he wasn't allowed to show them because of the law. Jee-Han, Sun-Il, and Shi-Yun explained Ability Users to him and Jee-Han explained his power and showed him a few things. They then settled in to talk about their lives and friends.</p>
