    <p>Years of botched plans and failed attempts hung heavy in the room.</p>
<p>The air was ice cold. There was a slight breeze coming out of the archway. Whispers seemed to float out on the gentle wind as if caressing the skin of the onlookers and enticing them to come forward.</p>
<p>Hermione Weasley slowly let out a breath as she realized she had been holding it for what seemed like an eternity. She glanced over at her husband of 26 years and found an emotionless and unreadable look on his face.</p>
<p>A single tear slipped down her cheek as she looked back at the Veil and realized this time would be like all of the others. A failure.</p>
<p>Harry reached out his hand and squeezed her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry, Hermione. We mourned for him 30 years ago,” He looked over at Ron catching his eye, and looked back at Hermione, “I think it’s time we finally put Sirius to rest.”</p>
<p>Harry walked over to the Unspeakable who was on the dais with them to help him replace the protective wards for the Veil they had created together over 20 years ago. It was a safety precaution they had put in place so there would never be a repeat of what had happened to Sirius.</p>
<p>Hermione spun around to face Ron and whispered urgently to him, “But it should have worked this time. I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>A look of pain crossed Ron’s face as he reached for his wife’s hand. She jerked from his grasp not wanting to be consoled.</p>
<p>“But we can save him,” she pleaded. “We can’t give up now.”</p>
<p>Ron took a deep breath and silently prayed before he said, “Hermione, dear. You said yourself that Sirius could be saved, but only if he were still alive when he went through the veil,” he tucked her brown and grey hair behind her ear. “We replayed all of our memories a thousand times from that night and no one knows what curse he was hit with. We can never know for sure.”</p>
<p>Harry parted ways with the Unspeakable, thanked him for his time like always, and asked for a few more moments alone with his friends.</p>
<p>After the last footfalls were heard Harry finally addressed the two closest friends he had in the entire world.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he started. He needed those words to sink in as they were never enough. Not for the two people standing in the room with him. Always standing with him.</p>
<p>“For everything you have both done to try and save Sirius. It’s more than any good friend would do,” he closed his eyes and clamped his hand, “I can’t do this anymore,” the pain of those words tore through him as he opened his eyes and emerald green glistened with unshed tears. “We should have stopped a long time ago,” he chuckled to try and keep from crying, “But we’re not exactly the ‘let’s give up’ type, are we?”</p>
<p>They stood there for a moment longer. Hermione threw her arms around Harry. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I was so sure. I wish I could do more.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” he said to reassure her as his arms came around her too, “You’ve done plenty enough."</p>
<p>Hermione pulled away, her sniffles to be attended to by Ron with an outstretched hand and a handkerchief. His arm went around her waist as he led his wife for the last time out of the Department of Mysteries.</p>
<p>Harry slowly followed behind his two best friends as they tried to collect themselves before heading to their son’s Hugo’s first quidditch game of the season with the Chudley Cannons.</p>
<p>He excused himself from apparating with them. He didn’t even remember what excuse he gave, all Harry knew was that he wanted to be at home instead of under the watchful eyes of the public.</p>
