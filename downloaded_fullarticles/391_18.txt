          <div class="userstuff"><p>IN THE KITCHEN, Albus can hide from them. Bare feet, cold floor. Socks have always felt too constricting, and no matter how thick or fluffy or thermal the socks are, his toes are always cold. Gran said it was something to do with his circulation. James called him a snake, but that was when they were younger. Albus just thinks he has cold feet. </p>
<p>The kettle flicks on. An orange light flits to life in the plastic base. Albus drums his fingers along his arms, hugging his chest while he waits for the water to boil. It’s three in the morning and his feet are cold. It doesn’t feel much different to three in the afternoon. It’s three in the morning and he’d quite like a hug, but there’s nobody awake to ask and he won’t bother them, and if someone tried to hug him now he might crawl out of his skin. </p>
<p>There is a voice hiding beneath the table. One voice always sticks low, and Albus tentatively named it Warrior. Warrior shortened it to W, and that’s what he is, now. W, beneath the table, hunkered low and telling Albus to press his knobbly knuckles to the hot surface of the kettle until it burns. Not to hurt him, W says. Just to see when the kettle has finished boiling. </p>
<p>The orange light flicks off: the kettle has finished boiling. </p>
<p>Albus taps his fingers against the skin of his arms again. He doesn’t <em>want</em> a cup of tea. He doesn’t want soup from the packets they keep in the cupboard, or bitter coffee that tastes burned and will keep him awake for hours, or a Lemsip. He wants to fall onto a bed that feels like air and fall asleep. He wants to wake up feeling rested. </p>
<p>W calls him names and slinks further under the table. </p>
<p>Albus reaches for a mug.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>THE SPACE BETWEEN three and six is a bleary void. Albus peels open his eyes, crusted shut, and wipes his mouth. He’s splayed on his back on the twin bed; the sheets are a bright, emerald green that hurts his eyes even in the dark. He liked blue, when he was ten. Now it’s like green is the only colour he can lay claim to.<p>Someone bangs on the wall. He squints at the ceiling for a minute, but there is no proper sensible reliable way to tell whether the noise is real. </p>
<p>“Come the fuck on, Albus! We’re going to Gran’s!”</p>
<p>It’s Lily’s voice, followed by a few more knocks. The Voices that he hears are cunning and persuasive, but so far they only sound like themselves. Albus tilts his head in acceptance and gets out of bed. </p>
<p>It’s six in the morning, but Gran knows the routine by now. They get dressed in the semi-dark, slipping into sweaters and socks, while the birds start chirping outside. Mum runs up and down the stairs in a frazzled state, quill between her teeth. Dad’s office door is locked. At the front door, Lily grabs Albus by the arm and shoves a cereal bar at him. He squints at it; it’s got raisins in it, but the packet is sealed tightly. He pockets it for later. Someone hisses at him, but he shudders and tries to ignore it.  </p>
<p>“Ready?” Mum nods before they can answer, and leads them out into the cold, crisp air. Bracingly, she says, “It’s supposed to warm up soon. Hold tight.”</p>
<p>When they Disapparate, Albus leaves his stomach behind, but not them. The voices. The little noises and sounds and voices that speak far more normally than most people think is possible. They come with him. W is the loudest, scampering through the grass they land in. Albus peers up at the dark, looming shape ahead as he tries to catch his breath. It’s the Burrow, drenched in dawn.</p>
<p>W tells him to move. W calls him a fucking embarassment when Albus wheezes through another breath. W says other things too, shifting in the coarse grass, and only vanishes when Albus tries to look at him. But he’s still there, grumbling as they stride towards the Burrow, and he only gets louder when Gran opens the door and they all troop inside. </p>
<p>While the adults chat, Albus retreats to the kitchen. Sometimes that’s the only way. Kitchens are always loud, even when they’re quiet. Always something whirring or humming or whistling, always something to be stirred or pots to be clattered, even when the room is empty. The sounds fill up that loud space that follows Albus around like a dog—and he winces, because W knows exactly what he just thought, and he <em>hates</em> that comparison. W doesn’t like to be called a dog, or small, or a voice. </p>
<p>There’s a bird in the hedgerow outside, pecking at a poor, wilted leaf. Albus grips the counter and stares out of the kitchen window. Not blinking. W sneers from beneath the chair, cursing up a storm. He calls Albus names. Some of them are even true. Albus grips the counter tightly and blinks. </p>
<p>“There you are, Albus, you ran right past me.” Gran bustles in and pats him on the shoulder, shifting him aside so she can reach the sink. “Your mother’s gone to work, and Lily’s off to the Lovegood’s later, so it’s just us this morning. Tea?”</p>
<p>He didn't hear the door shut. But sure enough, the shape of his mother strides through the waterlogged garden, vanishing beyond the gate. He blinks at the sunlight seeping across the sky, like gold ink spilled on parchment, bleeding into the greedy fibres. Night sucks in the light, and morning spits it out again. He blinks, and unfolds his hands from the counter, nodding shortly. </p>
<p>There’s a mug on his bedside table at home, filled halfway with cold tea. He won’t clean it for a month. It will sit and grow mould, and he’ll take it down to the kitchen in the night, or when Mum isn’t there to look at him too harshly. </p>
<p>W curses again, something about dogs and their owners. </p>
<p>Albus doesn’t particularly want a cup of tea. But Gran arches a grey eyebrow, wand raised, and he nods again. </p>
<p>“Tea sounds nice, Gran. Thanks.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>HE TAKES THE train to therapy. St Mungo’s offered to send him to Mind-Healers when he first coughed the words out, when he knelt in his bedroom with his arm shoved over his stomach to keep everything in, to keep the words in, clutching so tightly that it ached, like he was holding in his organs and the soft, fleshy parts of him instead of his secrets. It was like if he let a few tears go then the whole lot would go rushing out like a damn breaking, and he <em>tried,</em> he tried so hard to keep it a secret because there were voices that nobody else could hear. There were things that nobody else could see. There were all these experiences that might not be anything but felt too big to be nothing, and they scared him still. They scared him into silence.<p>But he couldn’t stay silent, and eventually Dad gripped him very tightly by the forearms and held on, and said, <em>what’s wrong,</em> and <em>tell me.</em> St Mungo’s was at a loss. They shoved potion after potion down his sore, dry throat, but nothing came of it. Magic looks for a cure, and anything less than fixed is worthless. Why glue something back together when you have Reparo? Why not just throw the whole vase away if Reparo doesn’t work?</p>
<p>The train journey is seventeen minutes long. Eight songs, give or take. He winds the earphones under his jumper and out through the hem, connecting them to the old, battered iPod that Lily’s Muggle friend gifted her. Lily’s not a music person. Albus is, but only because he has to be; it turns the Voices into muffled sounds that he can cope with.</p>
<p>There are no kitchens to hide in on a train. A buffet cart, sure, but that’s closed until they reach the bigger towns. This journey goes from Ottery St Catchpole to a town with ten percent more people, and fifty percent less greenery. More cars on the road, and no Christmas lights when that time of year comes round, and dull brass statues robbed of their luck, standing where there should be trees. </p>
<p>Albus sits on a seat that smells of tobacco and his nerves thrum when he catches his nails on the cheap, scratchy upholstery. The toe of his canvas shoe squeaks when he rubs it on the dirty floor, but he doesn’t hear it. He chews his lip in time with the music. Holds his ticket in a vice-like grip. </p>
<p>Nobody checks it. He gets off the train with ten minutes to spare before his appointment, breathing heavily through the tight, crushing feeling in his chest. </p>
<p>A voice clucks its tongue above him. ‘Always so ridiculous, that one. Nobody’s watching him, but he can’t help but try and make a scene anyway. Embarrassing, that’s what he is.’</p>
<p>And then, ‘Of course, they’re all watching him now. Staring, aren’t they? He should have picked something better to wear. He looks awful, ugly, who would want to be seen in that?’</p>
<p>There are answers. It’s not just W that has something to say. The Elders all sound similar, stiff and proper with nothing but judgement in their voices. They never deign to talk directly to Albus, but he’s their favourite topic to dissect and pull apart. Their words blur together and come apart again. He picks up whole sentences, and chunks of comments, and digs one earbud harder into his ear. He moves along the platform. The air is cool, but he’s still sweating. </p>
<p>W barks a laugh, trotting at his heels. He says that Albus has sweat patches, that people can see the light grey of his hoodie turn dark under his arm. He murmurs about stink and deodorant and calls him foul until a car rushes past, silencing him. </p>
<p>The ninth song starts up. It’s a much stronger beat.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>THE ARMCHAIRS ARE too stiff. Albus sits in one that faces the window, his legs too long for the seat, and instantly wants to move. His head hurts from the music. The earbuds will tangle like vengeful snakes in his pocket, but he benches them anyway, cutting off the strain of Biffy Clyro.<p>“Albus,” Ed says warmly. </p>
<p>Ed Lean, he’s called. A therapist. A man who wears suits and leather brogues, the laces always undone. He’s a Muggle, and a good man, and he never has a pen. Albus bought him a pack of simple biros for Christmas last year and never got the nerve to pull them out of his pocket. </p>
<p>“Hi,” Albus says. He’s not sure that it’s warm, but he means it to be. </p>
<p>Ed Lean, the Therapy Machine. That’s his name in Albus’s phone. When the potions didn't do anything, and the results of every spell under the sun proved that Albus wasn’t under some kind of curse or Hex, they turned to more… Muggle solutions. Psychosis, the Mental Health Team said, shuffling papers as they looked at Albus kindly on their second home visit. Medication might help, they said. There were options. He wasn’t going to be alone, and they would help. </p>
<p>It took awhile to get to that point. It took even longer for Ed to become available; Albus quietly declined the first therapist he saw, who talked for too long about shit that Albus wasn’t interested in, who was too opinionated and didn't listen the way Albus needed him to. He declined the medication too. Not all of it, but some of it.  </p>
<p>It’s taken a while to get here, but he’s here. </p>
<p>Ed sits back in the chair, sprawled comfortably. He always looks comfortable. Albus feels like his skin is a cage, like his skeleton is something of a crumbling scaffolding, like his joints are one cold day away from rusting in half. He wonders if Ed feels like that too, with his lanky legs and flat fingers, or if he feels as comfortable as he looks. </p>
<p>“How’ve you been?”</p>
<p>And it starts. Albus says things, hums. His knee jiggles up and down like a yo-yo on the end of its tether. Up, down, up down, <em>updown.</em> </p>
<p>“Fine,” Albus says, at the end of his short explanation. “I’ve been fine.”</p>
<p>Ed raises an eyebrow. </p>
<p>And it starts again. </p>
<p>“I keep… not sleeping,” Albus says eventually, fumbling the words. “I have a headache right now. It’s like my eyes are full of sand.”</p>
<p>“Want some water? We even have tea, I think.”</p>
<p>They go back and forth like that for a bit. </p>
<p>“You have to ask specific things,” Albus reminds him. “I don't… when you do that. When you. When you just ask me how I am or how things are, I don't know what I’m supposed to say.”</p>
<p>Ed goes on a tangent, a bit. He talks about how there’s nothing you’re supposed to say or be in therapy. <em>Therapy is your space, Albus. We can talk about whatever you like. We can talk about shoes or whatever you watched recently. We can sit in silence if you want. This is your space to do whatever you want with. Free of judgement.</em> </p>
<p>W says, “It’s not that easy. He’s lying. He’s always lying, that fucker, with his plastic smile and shitty little shoes and the way he looks at you with pity. He’s a fucking liar and I don't fucking trust him, and you’re a fucking idiot if you do...”</p>
<p>And then there’s a lot more curse words. Albus must flinch. He must, even though he’s used to this, because Ed leans in a little.  </p>
<p>“Did you bring someone with you today?” Ed smiles. It’s not a smile for a child, but Albus just shrugs, because that’s what W thinks. W thinks everyone looks down on them, and it’s frustrating because half the time Albus finds himself agreeing, buying into it. </p>
<p>“W,” he says. “He’s pretty pissed.”</p>
<p>W doesn’t like when Albus speaks for him, but he’s accepted that nobody else can hear him. ‘Too fucking stupid for it.’ So it has to happen. Sometimes Ed wants to speak to W, and he nods patiently and apologises for being patronising, and laughs a little when Albus smiles wryly, refusing to translate the swear words. </p>
<p>“I don't mind swear words,” Ed will promise him, every time it happens. “I’m always on the look-out for new ones. And I promise, I’ve heard it all before. You can’t shock me.”</p>
<p>W tries out a few threats, just to prove him wrong. Albus doesn’t translate those, either. </p>
<p>“We can talk about him, if you like,” Ed says. “Or I can ask you something else.”</p>
<p>It takes a minute to make the decision, but eventually Albus says, “Something else,” and he finds he’s not too scared of saying the wrong thing.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>THE TRAIN BACK is still seventeen minutes long. Albus runs through his songs, chewing his lip and tapping his foot on the floor. Standing room only this time. His ticket gets stamped and he lets out a harsh breath, tasting the mint gum he chewed on the way out of Gran’s door this morning. He didn't brush his teeth.<p>Sometimes he just can’t be bothered. He knows he needs to do it, and he knows that he’ll spend the whole day rubbing his tongue along the outside of his teeth, feeling the silicone layer that covers them. But even when he knows just how much he will hate himself if he doesn’t do something, sometimes he can’t do it. He just lies there or sits there and thinks about how stupid he is for not getting up and doing this one fucking stupid easy thing, and by then it’s time to leave. </p>
<p>The wheels rattle over a rough patch of track. Albus feels wrung out. His sweaty hand clings to the pole as they shake through the countryside. This is a smaller train than the one he took to therapy. Trains like these are built like boxes of tic-tacs. It shows in every aching, grinding sound and the shudder of loose, battered windows. A draught billows about Albus’s ankles. </p>
<p>“Got something for you,” James says, on the other end of the train. </p>
<p>He’s standing on the platform in broad daylight, dressed in his Quidditch gear with a grin on his face. Bold as brass. Cheerful and bright in a way that makes Albus feel like a big dark cloud. Albus steps away from the platform edge and eyes him uncertainly. </p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Waiting for you. You didn't half take your time.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help how long the train takes!”</p>
<p>James holds up both hands, palms facing upwards. “Slow your roll, Albatross. I was joking. Maybe I’m just eager to see you, ever think of that?”</p>
<p>Nobody speaks up. An Elder scoffs. But nobody speaks up; everyone, including Albus, always feels exhausted after therapy. Even when nothing really happens, when the chatter is easy and the conversation stays firmly on track, the exhaustion always hits. </p>
<p>Albus blinks up at his older brother. Older by entire years; months of time carved out in the space before Albus existed, a time when it was just James and his parents. Sometimes, when he hasn’t slept in a while and his tea is busy growing cold beside his numb hands, he thinks about how it should have stayed that way. He thinks about how much James must hate him, for coming along and ruining the spotlight. He thinks of how his parents must have grimaced at the thought of him, those first few months. How they learned to hide it. </p>
<p>“Oi.”</p>
<p>James, with his calloused fingers and gentle touch, eases Albus’s head back to him. The foggy bit behind his eyes clears up and he can feel the platform beneath his feet again. </p>
<p>“You floated off for a second,” James says, pulling him into a quick hug that lasts too long and not long enough. “Come on, Space Case. I told you I had something for you, didn't I?”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>WHAT JAMES HAS is not immediately apparent until they reach a cafe in the middle of Ottery St Catchpole.<p>“I don't really feel like eating cake, James.” Albus doesn’t really feel like eating anything, actually. “I might throw up on your fancy uniform and then you’d really hate me.”</p>
<p>“If you threw up in my hair, then I’d hate you. Uniform is mild loathing, at most.”</p>
<p>Albus snorts, and lets himself be turned around by the shoulders. They’ve stopped in the middle of the path, right outside the cafe, and they must be getting in the way but James doesn’t move. And nobody says anything, so maybe they’re not getting in the way. And maybe it doesn’t matter anyway. </p>
<p>“How do you feel about social interaction?” James eyes him critically. “I don't mean in general, because I know that’s like the biggest thumbs down that anyone could ever give. I mean right now.”</p>
<p>“I just got out of therapy, and then I had to take a train.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“There was this guy on there that was listening to rap music without earphones.”</p>
<p>James winces. A few Voices make a sort of rudimentary comment about Albus being a mess, and ungrateful to boot, and how he’s disappointing James. James came all this way to see him and Albus isn’t even trying. He <em>never</em> tries. It’s the kind of thing that hits the mark; Albus can take the insults and name-calling and constant aggressive posturing, but when he can sense how true it is, it digs at his soft parts. </p>
<p>“But I’m fine,” Albus adds, quietly, and with a small scowl. “We can go in.”</p>
<p>Very lightly, James flicks him on the forehead. “Hey,” James says mildly. “You’re allowed to not want to do anything. I’m just gauging how much you can deal with right now.”</p>
<p>It’s not often that he knows what he can deal with until he’s already dealing with it. The reverse is true, too: it’s not often that he knows what he can’t cope with until he’s knee-deep in a panic attack and stuttering in front of some poor, exhausted cashier who just asked him a simple question, decidedly not coping with it.</p>
<p>“I can deal with this.” He ignores W scoffing from the gap in a folding shop sign. “I’ll let you know if I can’t.”</p>
<p>“So basically, keep an eye out for a crumpled mess on the ground, but otherwise, everything’s groovy.”</p>
<p>“I’m banning that adjective.”</p>
<p>James holds up two thumbs and says, with torturous cheer, “Funky monkey. Cool beans. Cool <em>bananas,</em> even.”</p>
<p>“Jesus fucking Christ.” Albus marches away from him. “It’s no wonder I’m in therapy.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>WHAT JAMES HAS still isn’t apparent until Albus looks sideways, standing awkwardly in the middle of the cafe, and spots Scorpius sitting in the window. He’s been dipped in gold. There’s sunlight on his skin and in his fair hair, and it shines a light on the dust in the air and the little creases in his shirt, and it makes him look ethereal. Albus comes back down to earth with a harsh swallow when Scorpius waves at him shyly.<p>“One best friend slash love of your life delivery,” James says, shoving him towards the table. “Free postage and everything. I’m getting drinks and you’re gonna eat something, and I’ll keep an eye on them, go and be nerds together.”</p>
<p>James shouldn’t have to keep an eye on anyone - not least the barista who is not the least bit interested in poisoning a customer. Not today, anyway. But W is already making anxious harsh noises under the nearest table, like he thinks the food will turn black the minute it’s got Albus’s name on the receipt, so Albus nods and doesn’t protest. It’s weird, he knows it's weird, to even have to ask for such a thing, but it’s what he needs. </p>
<p>There are sugar packets lined up on the table, a tell-tale sign of nervousness. Albus forgoes the other side of the table and slides into the booth before Scorpius can escape, leaning against him. It's already so warm; Albus can feel it in his toes. Scorpius makes this little sound before he unsticks his teeth and hums, draping an arm around his waist and holding on, a sort of sideways hug. </p>
<p>‘You smell like trains,’ W barks. ‘God, get the fuck away from him, he’s gonna think you’re this needy clingy bitch and then he’s gonna leave. You want him to leave? You’re so stupid.’</p>
<p>“Hi,” Scorpius says quietly, smiling. “Good day?”</p>
<p>Very slowly, Albus leans his head against Scorpius’s shoulder, and breathes. He can still hear W. He still feels anxious. His heart pounds in his chest at all the noise, real or not, and he keeps one eye on James as he flirts harmlessly with the bemused barista. But Scorpius is warm from the sunlight and smells like coffee, like he’s spent hours here, soaking in sun-drenched lattes. His shirt feels real against Albus’s cheek. He puts his pointy chin in Albus’s hair and doesn’t complain about the dry, lank, brittle curls. He makes the little sound again, relaxed and quiet, and it’s enough that Albus can take another breath. </p>
<p>“I saw a bird you’d have liked today,” Albus says, letting his eyes close briefly, and his lips turn up into a small smile. “So yeah. Not bad.”</p></div>
