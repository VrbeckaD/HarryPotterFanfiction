          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus Lupin took a deep, shuddering breath. He was going to tell his best friend something that he hadn't ever willingly told anyone else before. And it terrified him to the very core. He thought for a second he was going to be sick. But no, he had to do this. </p><p>"I...I have a medical issue," he said slowly. </p><p>Sirius Black gasped, eyes wide. "Vanishing sickness?!"</p><p>"What?" Was that even a real thing? He was still learning all these wizard diseases and things. "No! I'm safe, all right?"</p><p>"Black cat flu?"</p><p>"...what."</p><p>"Is it something you get from a billywig?" Sirius pressed on. </p><p>"...I'm a werewolf, Sirius."</p><p>"Oh my god--"</p><p>Remus winced; he was expecting a worse reaction, but he supposed he just had to wait--</p><p>"--do you have syphilis?!"</p><p>Remus gave him a look then. He was still scared, yeah, but he was so ridiculous that he almost smiled. "I literally just said I'm a werewolf, you prat."</p><p>"I mean, it could be more than one thing." Sirius shrugged. "And I already knew that other thing, dude."</p><p>...oh. Wow. Okay then. </p></div>
