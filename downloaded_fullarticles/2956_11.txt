    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">The sun was rising with every minute that passed by as Hermione sat at her desk, two weeks earlier. She was working on her tenth- no, thirteenth draft of what she called, a letter to Theodore Nott. She wrote the letter traditionally, without magic. Inside her room, you could only hear the sound of her quill working its way through the letter. While she was writing, her sun kissed hazelnut hair fell over her shoulders, putting it back in place every now and then. She sighed, rumpled the letter and threw it into the bin. Her face sunk into her hands. What was so hard about this letter? She wrote letters everyday, she was good with words, she was brilliant with words. But not today, no.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s2">It’s been three years since she left London and the English wizard community thus leaving her friends and family. But after going to university in California and working for the Magical Congress of the United States her muggle therapist suggested that she was ready to face her fears.</span>
</p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">Once again she took her quill and wrote:</span><br/>
<br/>
<em>Dear Theodore,</em><br/>
it’s been a long time since we talked and I hope you’ve been well.<br/>
I know things between us were really complicated in the last couple of years but you’re still the closest thing I have to family.<br/>
If, by chance, I happen to come back, is there a room at the Nott estate that I could use while looking for a new apartment?<br/>
<br/>
Your’s sincerely,<br/>
Hermione Granger<br/>
<br/>
She thought of the last time she talked to Theodore. Her words were harsh and mean and her heart full of anger. She was angry at everyone. Theodore, Harry, Ginny, Ron, the Order, Dumbeldore and even at those who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>had died. It was hard to breath at that moment and she did something that was not typical for her. She fled. Out of rainy Britain into sunny California.</p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">Without giving it another thought and without the chance to throw another letter into the bin, she went to the window that faced the little garden behind her apartment and blew into a little whistle. Shortly after, a small brown owl appeared at her window sill.</span><br/>
<br/>
„Good day Rosa, please bring this letter to Theodore Nott."<br/>
<br/>
Hermione sticked the letter to Rosa's leg and gave her a treat before she sent her off into the cloudless sky. It took a load off her mind that was quickly replaced with a queasy feeling. Theodore was by far not as complicated as Hermione and far less conflicted. Even at their time in Hogwarts, he was mostly nice to her while the other Slytherins teased and bullied her.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Hermione sat on the windowsill and looked down at a small glass ball. She got it when she had bought Rosa and with it she could always see where the owl was right now. When the wind blows right the bird would arrive in the early evening hours and because of that she was nervous and excited at the same time. She turned her golden pendant between her fingers as a knock, followed by the sound of the door opening, brought her back into the present.<br/>
<br/>
„Hermione, I’m going to the city, do you want to come along and eat something?“ A blond man with freckles and green eyes sticked his head through the door. A charming smile on his lips. He was tall and tanned, a shirt of some Muggle Band Hermione didn’t know tightly fitting around his broad shoulders matched with his favorite pair of vans. He was well known for his looks. Once or twice when they went into the city, talent scouts were trying to get him for their agencies. Hermione was pretty sure, there is a place in heaven for people like Matthew, that are not aware of their charm.<br/>
<br/>
„ Oh, Thank you Matthew but I’m going to meet a friend for lunch today.“ She rose from her desk and walked through the room to grab her purse from her bed.<br/>
<br/>
„You sure? How about you cancel your date and we grab some burritos and go to the beach?“<br/>
<br/>
„I’m going to meet Harry.“ Hermione lifted a brow at him.<br/>
<br/>
„You choose the chosen one over your best friend? I’m shocked!“ Matthew made a dramatic gasp and crossed his arms in front of his chest.<br/>
<br/>
„Nope, Harry <em>is</em> my best friend.“ She rolled her eyes and put her mobile phone into her bag.<br/>
<br/>
Matthew and Hermione met at college and started working together for the Magical Congress of the United States of America. He was like California. Sunny, warm and lighthearted. When she was looking for a place to stay she found his advert at the social board in the wizard part of her college in Los Angeles. She called him right away but lied about her name and origin because she was afraid that the wrong people heard about it. Her worries were forgotten when she learned that the only thing Matthew knew about the second wizard war was that it has something to do with a guy named Harry Potter.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione liked him a lot. For a wizard and pureblood Matthew was really into muggle art and artistic stuff in general. She tried to act annoyed by his nosy, straight forward character but she enjoyed his company a lot.<br/>
<br/>
„So I guess you already decided whether you want to go back to London or stay.“<br/>
<br/>
Hermione was quiet for a second and turned back to face Matthew. He frowned.<br/>
<br/>
„Well, it was what I had planned to do from the beginning….to return as soon as I feel better again."<br/>
<br/>
Matthew sighed and turned to leave, he made a grimace.<br/>
<br/>
„Go and meet your friend Hermione, I’ll support all your decisions…gosh, it’s so hard to look for a new roommate! And now I have to buy something to wear for when I visit you in cold, rainy London! I need a margarita to get over this!“ His hand on his forehead he left with a dramatic pose. He’s such a drama queen, Hermione thought. But that’s what she liked about him.</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s2">~*~*~</span>
</p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">Harry was waiting at a café in Santa Monica. He was wearing a blue t-shirt with white stripes, jeans and sunglasses,. His hair was messy but she knew that he spent a good time to make it look like that. What an odd picture, Hermione thought. So young and carefree and all in all different from the images burned into her eyes. The images of a boy that went into the woods to die four years ago. When Harry saw her across the street he stood from his chair and pushed his sunglasses up. He smiled above the mouth.</span><br/>
<br/>
„Hermione, it’s so good to see you!“ Within a few steps Hermione was in Harrys embrace, smiling from cheek to cheek.<br/>
<br/>
„I’m so glad you made it Harry! It’s been ages since we saw each other!“<br/>
<br/>
Harry loosed his embrace but reached to hold Hermione’s hand and lead her to the chair next to him. The feeling of his hand in her’s made her wonder if he was afraid that she would flee once again.<br/>
<br/>
„Definitely. I wouldn’t miss the chance to see you. How are you? What about your studies, is everything going as planned? You look really good, Mione! Everyone sends their regards to you!“<br/>
<br/>
Hermione chuckled and squeezed his hand. Being with Harry was so easy. The waitress arrived and when she came back with their lunch they were so deep into their conversation that all worries were vanished.<br/>
<br/>
When Harry finished his sandwich, Hermione folded her serviette and took a deep breath.<br/>
<br/>
„I’m coming back. To London. Tonight.“<br/>
<br/>
Harry blinked and looked into her brown eyes. Her eyes flickered between his, unsure what to expect. What if it’s too soon? What if there’s no space for her anymore? The golden trio. The golden duo. She read the Daily Prophet, she saw the headlines. „Where’s the Golden Girl?“, „Heartbroken in California, fall of a war heroine“. But Harry smiled and his eyes were full of kindness.<br/>
<br/>
„Oh, that’s wonderful news, Hermione! You can’t believe how happy I am!“ She felt his hand at her underarm and she blinked "Do you know where you want to stay? Ginny and I can prepare a guest room at Grimmauld Place if you like.“</p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">„That’s really kind but I already asked Theodore if I can stay with him.“</span><br/>
<br/>
Harry narrowed his green eyes at this.<br/>
<br/>
„You sure? I thought you wanted to let the past be.“<br/>
<br/>
She looked away and fixed a spot over his right shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
„Yes, that’s what I actually wanted but I think I need to face it. I’m at a point where it’s all or nothing.“<br/>
<br/>
Her eyes wandered back into his, hoping for him to understand. And he did.<br/>
<br/>
„Of course. You know what you need to do. I mean, you’re the brightest witch of our age, right?“ He laughed and drank from his water. „And have you told Ron about this?“<br/>
<br/>
„No. I don’t think that he would be too happy about it…“ Hermione looked at her hands. It was awkward to talk about Ron with Harry. He was too biased.<br/>
<br/>
„Well, since we’re already talking about good news, there’s something else I wanted to talk about.“<br/>
<br/>
„Sure, what is it?“ Hermione was relieved that he changed the topic.<br/>
<br/>
„You know, I thought about it for a long time but I wanted to talk to you about it first. Because you’re my best friend and you’re also a girl.“ He plucked at the tablecloth and looked into his water. „I really want to propose to Ginny. Soon. And I think I need your help once she said yes.“<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly the anger was back. But she was smart enough to keep it quiet, to send it back into the lost part in her heart. She pushed her fingernails into her hand.</p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">„Oh, that’s lovely Harry! To be honest I wondered why you haven’t done it yet. I’m sure Ginny will go head over heels!“ Breath, Hermione thought. Breath. You’re happy. You have to be happy. Do it for him.</span><br/>
<br/>
„You think so?“ He smiled that smile that reminded her of the young boy she met at the Hogwarts Express.<br/>
<br/>
„Absolutely, Harry. I will do everything I can to help you. You deserve this.“ The knot in her stomach was gone. She felt oxygen flowing into her lungs.<br/>
<br/>
„I’m so glad to hear this! You know that I’m not good with all this stuff and social gatherings and so on so if you would like to help me with the preparations for my proposal, we can start tomorrow, if you’re free!“ He grinned but there was something else in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
„Everything. What is it?“ She relaxed a bit and gave him a smile.<br/>
<br/>
„I’m going to attend a charity ball from a really generous witch, called Lydia Frey. Do you heard from her?“<br/>
<br/>
Hermione thought about the latest articles that she read. A blond man with grey eyes came to light in her memory but she pushed him away. There she was, Lydia Frey. Two weeks ago. „She’s famous for her jewelry, right?“<br/>
<br/>
Harry clapped into his hands „Yes, exactly! She donated a lot to my charity project and I would like to get in touch with her. I hope I can persuade her into making our engagement rings."<br/>
<br/>
„Wow, there’s someone you need to convince to do something for the boy who lived?“<br/>
Hermione knew that the name Potter was like a spell. All doors in the world would open if Harry asked them to do so.<br/>
<br/>
„She retired a few years ago and puts me off every time I send her an owl. But I don’t want her apprentice to manufacture it. Molly’s wedding ring was made by her and I want Ginnys to be the same.“ He seemed to be quite nervous. Harry is well known for his frugality and he seems to be embarrassed to be so fussy about stuff like this.<br/>
<br/>
„Well, I thought I could avoid a dramatic performance for my comeback but this is important to you and I can’t let you ruin things. Skeeter will be delighted.“ She smiled honestly. Her last wizard party was some months ago and the wizard community in America is not half as tory as the one in England.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br/>
<br/>
Harry chuckled. „I promise you that they will not believe their eyes. I can see the headlines: HARRY POTTER WITH MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY! WHO IS THIS SUN KISSED WOMAN?“ He made an exaggerated pose and Hermione couldn’t help herself but laugh. This wasn’t what she had planned but it was a statement after all.<br/>
<br/>
„Send me the address and floo network and I’ll be there in time.“<br/>
<br/>
Harry winked at her and Hermione paid the bill. He insisted to pay for their lunch but she told him that it was his turn when they were back in London. He held her tight as they said their goodbyes at the apparition point.</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s2">~*~*~</span>
</p><p class="p3" align="left"><span class="s2">Back in her flat she found Rosa tapping impatient at her window. She let her in and watched how the bird flew a little circle before dropping a silver envelope sticked to a little package in front of her feet. The dark wax seal with the oh-so familiar Nott runes gave the author away. and Hermiones heart dropped to her knees. With quite shaky hands she opened it and read:</span><br/>
<br/>
<em>Dearest Mione,</em><br/>
<br/>
My house is yours.<br/>
Use the portkey to drop by, your new room is waiting for you and I can’t wait to see you again.<br/>
<br/>
Yours sincerely,<br/>
Theo<br/>
<br/>
She unwrapped the package and found an old book from the Nott library about houselfs and pureblood relations set as a portkey.<br/>
Hermione smiled and waved her wand. Her trunk opened and filled itself with all her belongings.<br/>
<br/>
So, it was settled.</p>
