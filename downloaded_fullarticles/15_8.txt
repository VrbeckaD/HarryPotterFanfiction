    <p>Arya Stark stood there in a line composed of other eleven year olds waiting for her name to be called. The entire Great Hall was full with older students already sitting at their respective house tables. The girl in front of her was shaking, but she was pretty calm. Her older siblings had already told her how the deal with the Sorting Hat was and she was confident she would get sorted into Gryffindor, along Robb and Jon.</p><p>A short man with deep green eyes that had presented himself previously in the entrance hall as Professor Howland Reed appeared an old hat and a wooden stool in front of the teacher’s table.</p><p>The hat sang a song that made Arya cringe in embarrassment and then the professor proceeded to call the new students by alphabetical order. When they finally got to the letter S she knew her name was close.</p><p>“Santagar, Nymea”</p><p>A small girl with dark black hair sat on the stool and a few moments later was sorted into Ravenclaw.</p><p>“Stark, Arya”</p><p>The time had come, seven years of her life would be decided in this moment so she headed with a sure step to the chair and the hat was placed over her head, so big it covered her eyes. In that same instant she could hear a voice that wasn’t hers inside her head.</p><p>
  <em>Courage I see yes, but also deep loyalty. Cunning as well. Slytherin maybe?</em>
</p><p>She immediately thought “Not Slytherin please” </p><p>
  <em>Hmm I see. I see indeed. I can see what really moves you. You think its bravery but bravery often comes from loyalty. People can really rely on you. Yes I see now.</em>
</p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF”</p><p>Shock was to say the least. Hufflepuff? Not Gryffindor?</p><p>They took the hat from her head and she walked to the house table while being welcomed with heavy applause. She turned to see her brothers sitting on another table, smiling at her but looking slightly disappointed.</p><p>A few other kids were sorted and then the headmaster, a tall albino man missing an eye stood in the center of the table and introduced himself as professor Brynden Rivers. He welcomed the new and the old students and spoke of certain prohibitions like the Forbidden Forest and other places inside the castle. Then with a loud voice and a flourish of his wand food appeared magically on the tables.</p><p>The last thing she had ate was hours ago at the train so she felt really grateful when all those good looking dishes were in front of her. She was chewing on a piece of honeyed turkey when everyone around her started talking.</p><p>“My parents aren’t wizards, I think you call them muggles. We have a bakery and they were preparing me to take over the place until I got a letter on April the day of my birthday saying I was a wizard. Took everyone in my family by surprise.” Said a chubby kid before swallowing a lamprey pie.</p><p>“Both my parents are wizards and my older brother is here as well so I’ve been expecting to come to Hogwarts since I could remember.” Said a kid whose face Arya didn’t see.</p><p>“Mine as well, my two older brothers are in Gryffindor and my older sister is in Ravenclaw. I would have wanted to be sorted with them.” Arya said without noticing how could it hurt her new fellow Hufflepuff classmates.</p><p>“Cheer up, no matter what people tell you, Hufflepuff is a great house.” A boy a few years older than her, with dark black hair and deep blue eyes spoke to her. “We have the best rooms if anyone asks me. Not cold like those towers and definitely nicer than Slytherin’s Common Room at the dungeons. Plus I’m gonna share a little secret with you newcomers, it’s the closest one to the kitchens, where you can ask the house elves for all kind of treats.”</p><p>That was all fine for the others, but Arya really just wanted to be with her brother Jon and felt like an outsider now.</p><p>“I’m Gendry by the way, Gendry Waters.” Well at least there were some nice people here and it didn’t really matter because her brothers would be leaving the school pretty soon anyway, just a couple more years until they graduated.</p><p>So Arya decided to make the most out of it in her time there and with a smile she answered “I’m Arya, Arya Stark.”</p><p>When they finished their meal a prefect ordered them to line up ad follow him so they could go to Hufflepuff’s common room. While she was getting up she had the chance to see Jon and Robb.</p><p>“What a surprise little sister. Now Bran has to be sorted into Slytherin and we will have a Stark in every house.” Said Robb with a smile.</p><p>“Bran would never be sorted into Slytherin. He’s not that kind of person.” Said Arya with vehemence. She always thought Slytherin housed the worst people.</p><p>“Who knows, I always thought you would be a Gryffindor but we were surprised today.” Said Jon, caressing her hair.</p><p>“Are you disappointed?” The line was moving and soon she would have to leave.</p><p>“Of course not, Hogwarts houses don’t define who we are. You’re still our little sister.”</p><p>She smiled and went back to her group.</p><p>“Were those your brothers? The Gryffindor quidditch captain and the seeker? You must be really good with a broom.” The boy named Gendry asked her.</p><p>“I am. I was hoping to join their team but I guess now I will have to compete against them.”</p><p>“Well I hope to see you in the tryouts. I will try too but for the position of beater.”</p><p>The group kept walking towards the inner parts of the castle while the boy whose family had a bakery marveled with the moving paintings.</p><p>When they finally arrived to what seemed like a normal wall, the prefect pronounced the special password and the wall changed into a door.</p><p>Arya had prepared herself to live in the Gryffindor tower her whole life. She even had a defined image told by her brothers. So it was a pleasant surprise to see the Hufflepuff Common Room. Round and cozy, a faint smell of bread lingered from the kitchens close by, Arya decided she rather liked it.</p><p>People were nice to her and soon her magic education would officially start. Maybe being a Hufflepuff wasn’t so bad.</p>
