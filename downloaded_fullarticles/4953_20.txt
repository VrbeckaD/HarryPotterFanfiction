    <p>If anyone told Luna that she'd have such a horrible crush on Hermione, she would have laughed briskly and discarded such an idea. Lately she couldn't stop starring at the other girl, it was as if her eyes were itching and the only relief was to glance over.<br/>
Hermione didn't seem to notice, too enthralled in Ron. They both went to the same high school, both sat at the same lunch table, but Luna hardly ever spoke to the other girl.</p><p>It wasn't until their graduating year that Luna started talking to Hermione more and more. Asking the other girl about her favorite color or telling her that physics was actually silly. Luna was more of a writer, a dreamer, a drifter, she wasn't as enthralled with science, it was too strict. She was different, but if any of her friends thought she was weird she wouldn't know, they never really teased her about it.</p><p>Currently Luna was sitting with Hermione in the library, and Luna was reading a book about gardening. It looked like Hermione was doing some sort of complicated math and Luna was glad to not be a part of that. The only thing that was distracting her was the other girl's waves of beautiful hair. Luna couldn't help but want to feel those pretty brown strands between her fingers.</p><p>Ron was so lucky to have Hermione, and Luna just got so jealous at times. If Luna was a guy maybe she would have been able to snatch up Hermione before Ron. A year ago such thoughts would of confused Luna, but now Luna was sure that she was a flaming lesbian. If her wet dreams about Hermione said anything that is.</p><p>Today Hermione had asked to borrow Luna's sweater, the soft pink one Luna wore very often. It was a simple oversized cardigan, the type you could cuddle into on a cold day. Luna had remarked that surely Hermione could borrow a sweater from Ron, but strangely enough Hermione had insisted, something about being too chilled to even look for Ron.</p><p>Luna couldn't believe how perfect the other girl looked in that pinwheel pink sweater, it hung off her angled shoulder's perfectly. It made Luna want to embrace her even more, it made Luna wonder how cute Hermione would look in her other clothes. All these thoughts were dangerous, so very dangerous, because in the end Hermione was still with Ron and Luna was alone and frightfully gay.</p><p>"Hey Hermione? I'm going to go look for another book, this one isn't talking about the flowers I want." Luna muttered and noted how swiftly Hermione looked up, the other girl had been chewing cutely on her bottom lip.</p><p>"Okay, hope you find it." Hermione said softly and sweetly. The things that pretty voice did to poor Luna, it was going to be her end.</p><p>Luna didn't need a different book, she needed air. So she walked around the library until she entered the gardening section. She had no idea what to do, with little thought she grabbed a book on growing lavender and headed back.</p><p>When she was only a few feet from their table she was stopped. What she didn't expect was a head cheerleader, Lavender Brown, to come up to her and smile brightly.</p><p>"Luna, I know I'm wonderful but I didn't think you were looking for a book on me. Darling, you could have just asked." Lavender said in a flirty voice, her eyes staring deeply into Luna's wide ones.</p><p>"Uh yeah Lavender, I should have asked you." Luna said carefully confused as to why a pretty cheerleader was communicating with her at all.</p><p>Lavender chuckled a finger finding its way to rest on Luna's chest. "You really should have, we could have set something up, a time when I could really show you how to grow lavender."</p><p>Luna was almost speechless but instead she wittily replied back, "I need some hands on experience, maybe even more than what a book could give me."</p><p>Lavender's hand was so close to her left breast now, Luna was sure the girl was going to just slide it the whole way down and cup her completely. "I can give you hands on anytime Luna." Lavender muttered leaning in so her lips brushed Luna's ear.</p><p>Without another thought Lavender was gone, and Luna was standing there with a flushed face. She glanced at her and Hermione's table and was shocked to see Hermione gazing at her with an annoyed look. Luna walked back over to the table setting her books down, and decided not to mention what had just happened. She could tell by the look on Hermione's face that the wheels in her brain were spinning.</p><p>"What was that all about?" Hermione asked in that way that made everything sound more intelligent.</p><p>"I think Lavender Brown may like me is all." Luna offered.</p><p>"But Lavender's straight as an arrow!"</p><p>"Obviously not Hermione," Luna said about to chuckle, she stopped when she saw Hermione's face.</p><p>Hermione looked like she was pouting, the expression was incredibly strange looking on her strong features. Her eyes were gazing on Luna's pale slim fingers that were playing the first few pages of her book, and her lips down turned.</p><p>"Hermione, what's the matter?" Luna murmured guilty.</p><p>"Nothing, I just have a lot of homework and you guys were distracting me." She muttered swiftly before going back to her math.</p><p>Hermione was quiet the rest of the day, and every time Luna tried to talk to her she seemed frustrated. It made no sense to Luna especially when Hermione lashed out at Ron. Ron took the mean words with ease and gave Hermione a pat on the hand as if she was a child. That only made Hermione even more upset and she stormed off. Luna couldn't figure out what had irritated Hermione so much, she was wondering if the girl was homophobic or maybe just hated Lavender. That's when Hermione's horrible mood had started after all.</p><p>Two weeks went by with a moody Hermione and a flirty Lavender. Every time Luna was in the library so was Lavender, waiting for the chance to attack and sink herself further into Luna's life. Luckily she seemed to only strike when Hermione was working and Luna was looking for a new book.</p><p>Lavender hadn't been getting too close, well not until recently. Luna had gotten up to return her book and she felt a hand on her waist. It was Lavender with her trademark grin ever present, and an almost daring look on her face. Luna looked down at those pretty manicured fingers and the other girl smiled knowingly. This time Hermione was watching as Luna seemingly melted under the other girl's touch.</p><p>"Would you like to take a walk with me in the parks?" Lavender asked already steering Luna towards the exit of the library. "I think it's a beautiful day for some exploring don't you?"</p><p>Luna was about to answer when she was roughly pulled back by Hermione who had rushed up.</p><p>"Lavender we aren't supposed to go to the parks during school hours! I don't need Luna in trouble," said Hermione.</p><p>"Oh, you are ridiculous, like you haven't been there with Ron! Stop hogging Luna! She's her own person! What would you like to do Luna?" Lavender asked her voice softening as she looked at the grey eyed girl.</p><p>"I would love to go out to the parks with you Lavender." She couldn't help but flush, "But Hermione is right, I really can't afford to get in trouble."</p><p>Lavender nodded and scowled at Hermione's triumphant grin. "Maybe some other time Luna," she offered Luna with a wink.</p><p>Once Lavender had swayed away Hermione was grumbling to herself.</p><p>"What's wrong Hermione? You've been acting off for awhile now."</p><p>"Nothing is wrong! She is just such an annoyance. She keeps undressing you with her eyes and it's so disrespectful!" Hermione grumbled out pulling Luna back to their table.</p><p>Laying on Hermione's chair was Luna's soft pink sweater, the one Luna hadn't seen in weeks. She noticed how Hermione pulled it up over her shoulders as she sat down, giving it a snuggle. It was adorable and Luna would have cracked a grin if Hermione's words weren't still ringing in her head.</p><p>"Hermione?" Luna asked softly.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p> "You do realize that I like girls right? That I don't mind that Lavender likes me? I think it's nice to be sought after." Luna admitted biting her pale bottom lip with white teeth. She was scared that Hermione would indeed be disgusted, and the thought left her painfully sad.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Hermione mumbled seeming confused. "You are a lesbian?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Hermione didn't seem upset but the wheels in her brain really did seem to be spinning. She was biting her lip and starring at Luna with squinted eyes. Luna was feeling nervous under that strict gaze, she felt like an equation that Hermione was solving piece by piece.</p><p>"Okay?" Luna asked her voice like the  whisper and crackle of falling leaves.</p><p>"Yeah." Hermione muttered before smiling, and it was a soft smile, one that confused Luna even more.</p><p>"Okay." Luna mumbled before slowly standing up and grabbing her backpack. "I'm just going to go, uh duty calls." She grabbed her gardening books with a nervous smile before walking away. She didn't look back.</p><p>The next day there was a hush over their lunch table and Hermione and Ron were sitting on opposite sides of the table. Luna was approaching the table and noted this difference, her body language growing less confident as she got closer. Did Ron and Hermione break up? Luna was going to find it hard to believe that they actually just split so quickly. Sure, they had been struggling lately but they had been so in love. Luna noticed that Hermione had Luna's pink sweater tied around her waist, the room a bit too warm for the garment, but yet the girl still wore it in some way.</p><p>Just as Luna was about to sit down at the oddly quiet table she made eye contact with Lavender. Lavender had this look on her face as she eyed Luna's simple outfit, it was the look of  undeniable lust. Luna was wearing a simple white tank top that was tucked into a pleated paisley skirt with saddle shoes. It was a more retro outfit but she liked it, and more importantly the outfit popped with her black circle rimmed glasses. She hadn't been able to find her contacts that morning so she was forced to pull out her glasses.</p><p>Lavender stood and made her way over to Luna, stopping her from getting to her usual table. Luna couldn't help but gulp as the cheerleader stalked closer.</p><p>"Hey Luna, how have you been lately? I've been meaning to catch up ever since yesterday, I didn't get to finish talking to you." Lavender said taking Luna by the elbow and leading her to an empty table. </p><p>"I'm doing alright, a bit tired if I'm being honest, I was up late last night reading." Luna confessed rubbing at her grey eyes with a sheepish grin. </p><p>Lavender smiled at the action and Luna almost felt like such a smile couldn't possible be for her. It was so soft and caring, a look Luna had yet to see cross the cheerleader's face. It was so different from the usual confident grin the girl had set on her face. It was disarming and gentle, and Luna couldn't help but stare. She couldn't recall anyone looking at her like that, maybe Hermione once or twice but she'd never thought much of it. All Luna could do was let one of her dreamy grins slip onto her face, all of a sudden aware of her random outfit and tangled hair. Her glasses slipped down her nose as she tilted her head down her shoes suddenly quite interesting. </p><p>"Luna, where did you even find such ridiculous glasses?" Lavender teased. </p><p>"I- uh these are the ones I picked out, um from the store-" Luna stumbled over her words as the other girl pushed the glasses up her nose. </p><p>"I don't think I like them, but they look cute on you anyway," said the girl who was leaning impossibly close. </p><p>Luna smirked and was about to defend her glasses but she didn't have to. That was supposedly was Hermione was for, because suddenly the girl was right behind Luna's seat, her hands resting on Luna's bare shoulders. Yup, Luna was most definitely going to melt from that amazingly soft touch. Luna tried not to shutter or react but she could feel her eyelids droop ever so slightly, each lid wanting to flutter under the simple touch. She felt the grip tighten ever so slightly when the two girls started to glare at each other. She didn't know why but she could tell that Hermione had her debate face on, the face that could make a person fall to their knees. </p><p>"I love your glasses Luna, they accent your eyes wonderfully," said Hermione. </p><p>"Granger! This is ridiculous! Please leave us the fuck alone!" Lavender scowled. </p><p>"Don't talk to her like-" Luna was cut off but a raging Hermione. </p><p>"Certainly not! Luna needs to eat something and if you keep talking her ear off, she might starve." </p><p>"Hermione, I won't starve from missing lunch once," Luna reminded gently. </p><p>"Luna I would feel much better if you got something to eat, actually stay here, I'll get it."</p><p> Hermione was suddenly gone and Luna was starring at an annoyed Lavender. Her fists curled and her chest puffed out ever so slightly. It was strange to see her looking so frustrated when usually she was the one in control. Her eyes returned to Luna and they seemed to soften ever so slightly once again. </p><p>"Would you want to go on a date tomorrow night?" Lavender asked quickly and Luna could swear she heard someone curse behind her. </p><p>Luna took a moment to respond, her initial reaction being complete and utter shock. Should she go on a date with Lavender? She liked her well enough, she could even fall for her (maybe, if she tried). She needed to get her mind off of Hermione anyway, because her heart was already crushed by having to watch her and Ron all the time.</p><p>"Yeah, I think I do."</p>
