    <p>Their last year at Hogwarts was one to remember. Friendships formed, mended, and destroyed. Families mourning over their loved ones, a whole new array of staff members. Most students came back to finish up their N.E.W.T.s, like Hermione, who was determined to finish her education properly. Some came back to be around their friends for one last year, away from their family before having to go out on their own, like Ron.</p><p>But one, he came back because he felt like he needed to be there. He'd protected the school for seven years, what was one more? His friends were somewhat standoffish, and most of his teachers scoffed at his arrival, as they all thought he didn't need it. He was already offered a position as an Auror, even without the needed requirements. Regardless if he failed his N.E.W.T.s or not, the option was there.</p><p>He came back because he felt like he was missing something he didn't have in his previous years. It left a hole in his chest, one longing to be filled, by anyone, anything. And Harry felt as though he could find that here, in this final year. Of course, he could, he did. It was filled with deep silver eyes, gentle hands stitching him back together. But stitches don't last forever, and neither to people. So in this last year, Harry threw caution to the wind and let this person be there for him. He let him ruin him, and he let him love him.</p>
