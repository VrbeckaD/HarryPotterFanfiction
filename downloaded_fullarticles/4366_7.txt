    <p>*</p>
<p>Newt’s been in England for barely a month when an owl swoops through his window, just as he’s sitting down to high tea.</p>
<p>He experiences a moment’s irritation when the exhausted bird drops an envelope into the jam jar, only to feel instantly contrite. Meal forgotten and making soothing sounds, Newt offers the owl a perch and a dead mouse before taking up the missive, using his butter knife to break the wax seal.</p>
<p>The paper is a delicate shade of pink, lightly perfumed and covered top-to-bottom with an unfamiliar scrawl. He furrows his brow in confusion when he examines the valediction before pushing aside his tea to read, mouth gradually falling open in shock as words like <em> unexpected </em> and <em> reputation </em> and <em> she needs your help, Mr. Scamander </em> jumps out at him, before he sighs heavily and sets the letter down.</p>
<p>Newt indulges in a rare moment of self-pity, scrubbing his eyes with the heel of his hands before standing to put his untouched supper away. He thinks as he works, absently grateful his manuscript is so close to completion, mind clicking along rapidly until the only truly logical solution becomes clear.</p>
<p>A flick of his wand sets the kitchen to cleaning itself as he retreats to the study, summoning his favorite quill, a sheet of parchment and an envelope. He squares his implements while checking his funds, finding them tighter than he’d like but by no means lacking, before taking up his pen to formulate a response.</p>
<p>
  <em> Dear Miss Queenie… </em>
</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Two days later sees him standing before a familiar brownstone, hands shoved deep into the pocket of his blue jacket as he projects his thoughts as hard as he can.</p>
<p>The front door creeks open a few minutes later, a blonde head peeking out to surreptitiously look around before waving him forward. Newt takes the snow-dusted steps at a light jog, deftly moving through the hallway and up the stairs, holding his breath until the double doors are safely locked behind them.</p>
<p>Queenie takes his jackets and kicks off her shoes before inspecting him curiously. “Where’s your case, Mr. Scamander?”</p>
<p>Newt scrubs his hands over the front of his trousers, feeling curiously unanchored. “I left it with my brother so I could catch the Floo here instead of waiting for a ship,” he explains breathlessly, watching from the corner of his eye as she chews her lip, making an obvious effort to stay out of his head. His shoulders relax when she produces no recriminations, touching his waistcoat pocket to feel Pickett stir curiously beneath his fingers. “I can only stay three days. I—I think that will be long enough.”</p>
<p>She nods before gliding into the kitchen. “I think we’ll be able to bring her around tonight if we play our cards right,” Queenie tells him. “She ain’t happy about this, either.”</p>
<p>A flick of her wand brings a cup of tea floating over to him. Newt nods his thanks before taking a tentative sip. It’s strong and good, and he manages a small smile before asking the question that’s been heavy on his lips.</p>
<p>“How is she?”</p>
<p>Queenie sighs while summoning a glass of milk. “Teenie ain’t doing so bad,” she says eventually. “She just ain’t...<em> happy. </em>” She takes a sip, then, “Tina knows that you know. She saw me sending the letter and was able to guess.” Another sigh and she catches his eye before going on. “She says she’s upset with me but she could never hide her emotions very well. I think she wants you to help, even if she won’t admit it. She was thinking about writing you herself, but...”</p>
<p>Newt nods and takes another sip of tea. “It’s understandable for her to be unhappy,” he murmurs, “as long as her health isn’t suffering for it.”</p>
<p>She smiles and shakes her head ruefully. “Tina’s stronger than that. If losin’ her job and what happened to Credence didn’t make her crumble, then nothin’ will.”</p>
<p>Newt flinches at the reminder of their failure, and Queenie takes a moment to look sympathetic before setting her jaw. “Now, whatever you was thinking, Mr. Scamander, I’d like to hear about it. Before Tina gets here, if you don’t mind, ‘cause I want to make sure it’s gonna work.”</p>
<p>He meets her eyes with a forced smile, nervous sweat coating his palms. “In that case, I’m going to need some more tea,” he tells her, and she Summons the pot and a tray of cookies before turning her expectant gaze on him.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Newt and Queenie are just putting supper on the table when Tina arrives home, kicking off her tired brogues and hanging her jacket before coming up short at the sight of him.</p>
<p>“Er, hello,” Newt manages with a crooked smile when her eyes widen before cutting to the side. She sends Queenie, who smiles innocently, a hard look before crossing her arms over her chest.</p>
<p>“Mr. Scamander. It’s good to see you again.”</p>
<p>Newt winces and drops his eyes to his boots. “I’m happy to see you, too,” he tells his dusty laces and tries not to feel hurt that she no longer considers him worthy of first-name status.</p>
<p>Queenie makes a sympathetic sound before turning to Tina. “How ya feeling, Teenie?” she asks, her forehead creased into a frown. Newt looks up to find Tina staring at her sister, her face waxy-pale as her fingers clench the chair rail.</p>
<p>“What did you <em> make </em>?” Tina asks in a wobbly voice, pressing shaky knuckles to her nostrils when her throat bobs convulsively. Queenie’s eyes widen in understanding as Newt withdraws his wand, casting a quick series of air-cleansing charms before moving to Tina’s side.</p>
<p>“<em> Sit</em>,” he tells her, cradling her elbow while pulling out the chair.</p>
<p>Tina doesn’t sit so much as <em> collapse </em> into it, large beads of sweat standing on her forehead. Newt crouches to be level with her eyes before reaching out to frame her face, feeling the pounding of her heart through her jaw.</p>
<p>“Breath with me,” he says calmly, taking exaggerated deep breathes until she matches his rhythm, informing Queenie in an undertone, “It’s the meat. Put it away please, or find a way to contain the smell.”</p>
<p>Queenie waves her wand in a complex pattern as Newt holds Tina’s gaze, willing her to calmness. A few careful sniffs reveal that the lingering odor of cooked meat has vanished. He casts a cooling charm, rewarded with a gentle sigh when Tina closes her eyes, before reluctantly releasing her face and standing.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Tina whispers, opening her eyes to pin him with her stare. “I don’t know what came over me, but thank you, Newt.”</p>
<p>Newt swallows the harsh burn of tears while inclining his head. “You’re welcome, Miss Golds—<em> Tina </em>.” He blinks hard before forcing himself to focus on the crook of her elbow, bringing her face into his peripheral vision. “Would you—are you hungry at all? Or would you rather skip it entirely? I can make some tea that will soothe your stomach if you’d like.”</p>
<p>Tina shakes her head before reaching out to brush her fingertips over his knuckles. “I’m fine,” she murmurs, and he can just make out the movements of her mouth when she bites her lip. “But I think...I think I’ll skip supper tonight if that’s okay.”</p>
<p>He smiles slightly, fighting the urge to rotate his wrist and take her hand in his own. Pickett chooses that moment to poke his head out of Newt’s waistcoat pocket, chirping a pleasant greeting before retreating. Tina grins at him and Newt's eyes are drawn back to her mouth like a magnet, watching her lips form the shape of her words. “Not that I’m not happy to see you Newt, but what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Newt wishes desperately he were better at prevarication when he looks up to find that Queenie has slipped from the room, unnoticed by them both. Tina covers the back of his hand with her palm before settling the issue, confidently threading her fingers through his own. Shocked, Newt glances down at their joined hands, blinking hard until he’s managed to convince himself that <em> this is actually happening </em> before gulping and lowering himself to his knees.</p>
<p>Tina makes a questioning sound when he reaches out to take her other hand, watching him curiously as he absently strokes her third finger while gathering his courage. Feeling her eyes on him, irritated by his own faulty resolve and sternly reminding himself of the inarguable logic of his idea, Newt huffs frustratedly before starting in the middle.</p>
<p>“It’s not unusual for pregnant females to be discomfited by the smell of certain foods,” he blurts, ignoring her shocked intake of air as he squeezes her fingers. “I realize that this is abrupt and your sister tells me that you were attempting to come up with a plan, but I felt it prudent to come and talk to you in person. I think you deserve that much.”</p>
<p>She presses her lips together unhappily and he hurries on, desperate to get it out before he chokes. “I’m not convinced the ‘European cousin’ excuse is the best solution here because I <em> know </em> you’ll wish to work for as long as possible and it’s...very difficult to hide a delicate condition after a time.” He strokes her hand reassuringly when she blanches. “And while I’m perfectly aware that I am not...that the child isn’t...while I know that I am not the <em> responsible </em> party here, I think you’ve misread me <em> terribly </em> if you thought I’d walk away from you, as your sister seemed to imply.”</p>
<p>He gulps when her fingers clamp around him, hard enough to dig her fingernails into his skin, and looks up to find her watching him with round eyes. “So Tina...Miss Goldstein...if you’d consider it, I’d like to offer you a possible solution.”</p>
<p>Her throat clicks when she swallows, her face pale. “<em> What? </em> What solution?”</p>
<p>It’s the most difficult thing Newt’s ever had to do, giving her the honor of looking her in the eye when he gives voice to the most important question he will ever ask, the sound of his own rushing blood very loud in his ears: “Will you marry me, Tina?”</p>
<p>His heart pounds very slowly but very hard as he awaits her response. Newt’s expecting angry rejection, disbelief, possibly even disgust at a perceived attempt at taking advantage of her, and is prepared to lay out his reasoning. So he’s entirely flummoxed when she bursts into harsh sobs, traces of silver coating her cheeks until she hides her face in her hands.</p>
<p>Moving on instinct, Newt gently pries her fingers loose before gathering her in his arms. Tina chokes out his name while clutching at him convulsively, and Newt allows her to press her face into his neck as she weeps, soothingly stroking her hair.</p>
<p>Queenie doesn’t bother them. Neither does anything else.</p>
