    <p>
  <span>“Poppy, stop babbling, I told you already I am not leaving this ward. I have questions to ask Mr. Potter and for once Albus isn’t here to interrupt us.” Snape said in his usual cold voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry knew it didn’t bode well for him. He remembered why he was under the fabulous care of Madam Pomfrey, again, there was a potion incident, Neville added too much bat wings to their potion and Harry put himself between the ‘soon-to-be-exploding-cauldron’ and his friend. ‘Damn his people saving thing, now he was stuck with Snape.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One thing Harry was certain, the medi-witch always knew when he would wake up and made her way to his bed before the Headmaster could question him. Not that Harry ever witnessed the Headmaster coming to watch over any other student in all the time he spent in ‘his’ bed in the infirmary. ‘Three-Two-One’ Harry thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah! Mr. Potter pleased to see you finally awake,” The gentle voice of Madam Pomfrey forced him to open his eyes, so he could assure her he was fine and maybe convince her to let him go quickly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before you try to explain yourself, Mr. Potter, I would like to know why you seem to think it’s okay to be arrogant enough to play hero in potion class when you were too lazy this morning to put on your heir ring? Which I would like to remind you Mr. Longbottom was wearing as recommended and as such was in no danger of whatever you two managed to cook in your cauldron this afternoon,” Snape said, all the while glaring at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape wasn’t as impressive as he could have been, but Harry assumed if he hadn’t been so used to the disgusted looks, sneers, and glares from his ‘loving’ family, the man might have frightened him, as it was Harry’s defense mechanism was to always try to up him, some part of his brain thought he was just testing the man to know what it would take for him to break and go from verbal to physical abuses, it’s always good to know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well? Mister Potter?” Snape questioned when Harry took too long to answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am sorry, Sir, I don’t know what you are talking about. Mrs. Weasley said she bought everything on the list, and I checked it twice since I am always missing things other students have, whether for your class or for others. And before you start saying I am so spoiled I don’t even shop for my school stuff on my own, it wasn’t my choice. We were going to go shopping the day after the Quidditch World Cup, obviously, I wasn’t allowed outside of the Burrow after what happened, especially since some people still thought I was responsible for the Dark Mark since it came from my wand,” Harry explained and waited patiently for the man to retorted something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, Darling?” Madam Pomfrey asked for his attention, so he stopped glaring at his potion professor. “Why would Mrs. Weasley be in charge of procuring your heir ring for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it one of those items I can only buy in person? Like for my wand? Because, if it is I don’t think I’ll ever get one. I mean I haven’t been to Diagon Alley since the incident in our second year. Between Lockhart trying to kidnap me, Malfoy Sr being his evil-self, Mr. Weasley’s and Mr. Malfoy’s fists fight and my first ever floo travel ending with me in Knockturn Alley, I understand why Mrs. Weasley took charge of our shopping in the following years. Before our third year, I was living in the Leaky Cauldron, after I blew up Aunt Marge but the minister said I wasn’t to leave the establishment.” Harry explained naively. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he was looking at his hands the whole time, ashamed somewhat by his childlike treatment where Diagon was concerned when they had no problem telling him he needed to kill Voldemort if he ever came back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I know,” He said, suddenly cheerful, in the silence that had followed his last intervention. “Maybe I can get one in Hogsmeade, I mean Professor McGonagall must let me go if it’s as important as you say, and surely someone his selling those ‘air rings’ in case we lost ours or if someone stole it right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I…” Snape mumbled, Harry had never heard the man mumbled, so he looked sharply at him. “Mr. Potter, an heir ring isn’t something you can buy,” Snape said in a firm voice but even Harry could say something was bothering him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How am I supposed to get one if I can’t buy it?” Harry asked perplexed but it wasn’t the first weird thing he encountered in the magical world, after all, he got the philosopher stone from the mirror to his pocket, it just appeared there. “Is it something you have to transfigure? Because I know my work in transfiguration isn’t so bad but I don’t think I could manage something that would save me from potion accident.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter, please - Stop - Talking.” Snape snapped at him and Harry thought maybe he should listen, for once, since the man had said ‘please’, and Harry had never heard him say ‘please’ before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, Harry just nodded, agreeing to stay silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Poppy, would you mind leaving us alone for a moment?” Snape asked the medi-witch who hesitated looking concerned at Harry who nodded to tell her he was okay, so she left. “Mr. Potter, I know your heir ring couldn’t be given to you the way it traditionally is…” Snape started and Harry already wanted to interrupt him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape must have felt it and answered the unasked question. “It is an heirloom the Lord or Lady of important families give to their heir, either the firstborn or the first son, or daughter, in case the lordship is gender specific.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry frowned at that, it would explain why he never heard of it, Neville wouldn’t have mentioned it, he didn’t like to talk about his parents, and Ron was neither the firstborn, nor the first son of his family, Harry wasn’t even sure the Weasley name was entitled to a Lordship, he read it used to be in the history book Hermione landed to him, but he never heard anyone in the family talk about it, maybe Mr. Weasley had an older brother or sister, and they were the ones with the Lordship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now I know your parents couldn’t give it to you, but if the heir is too young for the responsibilities at his or her parents’ death, the ring is put into their Gringotts Vault for safekeeping and given to them before they enter Hogwarts.” Snape kept explaining, his voice nice and gentle when he mentioned children being orphaned at a young age as Harry had been.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Surely, your relatives took you to Gringotts so you could retrieve your ring and be given a statement of finances.” Snape wondered and looked at Harry, but he remembered not to talk and shook his head ‘no’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need to know what I am working with before I let you explain yourself is that okay with you?” Snape asked and Harry nodded ‘yes’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know, you’re not that much of a pain when you can’t talk, Potter.” Snape joked and Harry looked at him wide-eyed for a few seconds before he shrugged, after all, it wasn’t the first time someone told him they didn’t want to listen to him, at least Snape was still talking to him and not simply ignoring him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you know what a Statement of Finances is?” Snape asked and Harry shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t your tutor explain it to you, or were you simply not paying attention?” Snape snapped at him before remembering to ask yes or no question and it wasn’t Harry’s fault or at least Harry assumed it was what happened when the professor said “Sorry”.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did your tutor talk to you about Finances?” Snape asked Harry shook his head, trying to convey that he didn’t have a tutor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did they teach you potion before you came to school?” Snape asked and again Harry shook head sighing, visibly it didn’t work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, you only learn DADA, figures, it is why you have good grades in it,” Snape said without looking at Harry but Harry kept shaking his head until he was sure the man had seen it, even though it was making him a little dizzy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you have tutors, Mr. Potter?” Snape said cautiously and once more Harry shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can talk now,” Snape told him, and Harry took a big breath, not sure why he stopped breathing as he normally would while the man was questioning him, maybe he just didn’t want to break the tentative truce by making sounds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quirrell talked to me about tutors too. I told him I never had any, he said I shouldn’t lie about such a thing just, so I could slack off with Ron, I should be proud to beat Hermione and Malfoy in his class, they had tutoring too.” Harry told him, he was now curious to know what was so important about tutoring.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor Quirrell.” Snape corrected him absentmindedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no respect for people who tried to kill me,” Harry mumbled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape looked at him for a while before he opened his mouth, only to close it immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t understand if everyone has tutors before coming to Hogwarts, why isn’t there a primary school for magical children, surely, there aren’t that many qualified teachers in the United Kingdom, if the Headmaster  employs people like Quirrell, Lockhart, or Professor Trelawney…” Harry said thinking to himself, at Snape surprised look he added. “She only predicted my death, multiple times, she hasn’t tried to kill me herself to make it true, yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Point,” Snape said nodding his approval. “The fact is Mr. Potter, we were told you had tutors and would know everything about the magical world, its culture, and its history.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had to learn all that between my birthday and getting on the Hogwarts express?” Harry asked in a defeated tone. “Even if I had been allowed to look at my school books, I am not smart enough to learn all of it in a month. No wonder I used to feel so stupid sometimes when everyone knew so much more about me than I did, or do.” He said with a sigh before adding in a whisper. “I still don’t know anything, can’t even seem to find the books about me Hermione keeps talking about.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you misunderstood me, Mr. Potter.” Snape told him, Harry had to repress the shiver he was feeling every time someone spoke that word or the ones assimilated with it, ‘it’s only a misunderstanding’, ‘you misunderstood’, ‘misunderstand’, they only led to bad memories and shivers of fear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape hadn’t missed the reaction and filed it for later, he would ask about it once he knew more about the boy in front of him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I meant, we were told you were being given a magical education at your relatives’ house.” Snape tried to explain as best as he could, but was perplexed when the teen started to laugh so hard the medi-witch came back to check on them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once he had calmed down a little, Harry asked if the professor was serious and got a nod.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t even allowed to say the word magic in the house. Once I got punished because my cousin Dudley wanted to watch Merlin on the telly, Aunt Petunia said I was trying to corrupt her son.” Harry explained and moved away from the professor when he saw the man’s reaction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape’s face was red, just like Uncle Vernon before he started yelling at Harry, so Harry carefully backed away from him and into the headboard of his bed, pulling his knees against himself, it was late October, and he could eat normally again, it had been quicker this time due to his weeks at the Weasley, he wasn’t about to let Snape ruin all his hard work with a misplaced blow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Petunia? The old fool left you with Petunia?” Snape started to yell angrily but stopped instantly when his eyes caught Harry’s. “Potter?” He asked sounding unsure and looked up at Madam Pomfrey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, Darling, nothing is going to happen to you here, you’re safe at school, remember?” She told him and gained a twin snort from both Harry and Snape for her efforts. At least, the twin snort relaxed Harry, a little.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am not mad at you, Harry,” Snape told him. Harry turned incredulous eyes toward him, Snape had called him by his first name. “I knew your mother and your aunt before we came to Hogwarts, she was never a nice person toward those who were different, she hated knowing their parents were so proud of Lily for being a witch, for being one of the brightest witches at school, when Petunia was just average. I don’t blame your grand-parents, I have seen them encourage her too, they went to her horse riding competition, they put her scores on the fridge for the summer, but no matter how proud your grand-parents were of her she could never see past the fact that they still loved Lily even if she wasn’t ‘normal’. I don’t understand why the Headmaster left you with them, he knew Petunia tried to push Lily down the stairs more than once to see if she could get her sister to lose her powers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He knows she tried to beat them out of me too, he says I am exaggerating, that they love me and would be  hurt if they heard me talk about them like that,” Harry admitted for the first time since Dumbledore had sent him back to the Dursley at the end of his first year.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry saw both of the adult in the room get their wand out in seconds and as soon as it happened he was off his bed trying to find his, cursing himself for taking so long to realize he didn’t have it in hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry!” both adults cried out at the same time, stopping him in the middle of his frantic search.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We want to do a health scan on you,” Snape said and Madam Pomfrey acquiesced.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t Mrs. Pomfrey do one, when I came in?” Harry asked hesitantly, he sat back on his bed ready to pounce away from them if needed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I did a surface one to know if you needed immediate medical care, or if you had any current injuries requiring treatment, as I do every time you come here. We…” She said and turned toward Snape who nodded. “We would like to do a deeper one, it would list everything which happened to you since you were born.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry backed himself into the headboard shaking his head vigorously, he didn’t want them to know everything, he wouldn’t survive the humiliation and the mockery from the student body and from Snape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Guessing what was wrong Snape offered something, “I, Severus Tobias Snape, promise to keep to myself everything Harrison James Potter chooses to reveal to me, may it be in writing, by speaking, or by sharing his memories, I swear on my magic that I will not talk, or write, or share unless he gave me leave to do so, which includes mocking him or alluding to his situation in any fashion, may it be comforting or demeaning in public as well as in private. So mote it be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You…” Harry said and thought about what the professor just said. “You wouldn’t want to comfort me?” Not that Harry cared, or was suddenly expecting Snape to hug him, but he thought if he could be comforted by a simple world the man would at least attempt it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just wanted to make sure you knew I would never speak of anything unless you tell me specifically that I can,” Snape assured him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My healer vow prevents me from speaking of anything to anyone other than another healer about a patient. But I could do the same, this way no one can take it from my mind either.” And she did, with the same wording.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can comfort me in private when it’s just us three, it’s private enough if you wanted.” Harry assured both of them, and they nodded before pointing their wands at him again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The scan took longer than expected, not that Harry knew how long it was supposed to take, but he could both see and sense Professor Snape and Madam Pomfrey getting more, and more, worried, as well as paler with every line the magical quill wrote on the medi-witch parchment. Harry had tried once to move away from them, they had seemed distracted enough he thought maybe he could run for it, he was wearing one of the infirmary pajamas but ti was okay it wouldn’t be the first time the other students in the castle would get to see him in those. He didn’t get far anyhow, not even out of the bed, before Snape, he was pretty sure it was him his magic felt different from Madam Pomfrey’s, stuck him to the bed with the help of a sticking charm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need…” Snape started then stopped, casting a wary look to the papers piling up in the Medi-witch’s hands. “Yes, that’s it, I need you to stay on this bed, with Poppy, I have a floocall to make,” He declared and left them alone going to the office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mrs. Pomfrey?” Harry asked when she stayed silent, glaring at the parchments in front of her. “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I okay, he asks! Am I okay?” Poppy ranted for a while before her eyes snapped toward him, and she gave him a piercing look. “I should be the one asking if you are okay, Harry, not the other way around. This…” She said pointing a line on the parchment Harry couldn’t read from the bed. “And this…” She said pointing another line. “And all of those, …” She kept going from one parchment to another, adding comments in the margin with her quill. “How are you even alive?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“ I would like to know as well.” A deep voice said from behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>---------</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile in the office:</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus sat down on the ridiculous cushion next to the floo. Why was it pastel green, why not Slytherin green? He knew the devil medi-witch didn’t even like green as a color, she didn’t have anything against his snake, but it was an aversion she developed during the first war after seeing too many casualties of the dreaded Killing Curse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was dreading the call he had to make, it wasn't the first time he had to call the man but usually, it involved pranks gone wrong and suitable punishment, never did he have to call on him on such an important matter. He knew he would be needed, or at least his wife would in some way. Plus, he hated the fact that he had to call out that stupid name every time he wanted to speak to the man.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gryffindor’s Den,” Severus called out while sending a pinch of floo powder into the hearth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What be Master Potion need?” One of the House-elves answered. “Is little Masters in trouble?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In a way, I need to speak to your Master, it is rather urgent,” Severus said and the House-Elf quickly popped away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man must have been close by, as he walked into the room not a minute later. Before, any greetings could be exchanged Severus told him what he wanted from him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need you to step into the infirmary right now.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Noda said none of the children were in trouble. What is this about Severus?” The man asked calmly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I took a vow not to divulge that information, but I am requesting as a friend for you step through as quickly as possible,” Severus explained putting as much urgency as he could in his voice, they didn’t have time to waste, if Dumbledore was to find out what they were doing, something told him the man would swipe it away as he had done before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My grandson was with me for an afternoon tea, should he join us?” The man asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus quickly thought about it, only one of them could be having tea with his grandfather and since the more Harry talked, the more they uncovered, it might be useful to have him on hand just in case they needed to make a quick trip, he might at least be useful in running interference with the Headmaster.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, take him with you,” Severus answered and stepped away from the fireplace when he was told they would come immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once again they skipped the pleasantries, Severus would apologies later but time was of the essence here. As they stepped through the door, Severus had to silence the younger man, glaring at him for daring to interrupt the Medi-witch in her rumbling. She didn’t give any details just pointed lines after lines on parchments that both of their guests recognized, the ‘in-depth medical report’ parchment had a specific blue color it was light and only people who had already gone through one or work in the medical field would know it for what it was, but they had never seen so many pertaining to the same person.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are you even alive?” Poppy finally asked, and this seemed to chock the older man out of his stilled stance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would like to know as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked back at them, even though his position stuck on the bed wasn’t ideal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t know what Snape had gone to do but since the man wasn’t dead he would assume he hadn’t told anyone what he had confided in him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The older man next to Snape reminded him of someone, another person, he couldn’t yet see, was standing behind them, but his attention was focused on the older gentleman. He was dressed in nice robes, in deep blue with a bit of gold on the hem, simple but yet looking expensive, at first glance Harry thought it might have been silk he had seen Malfoy walking around in similar robes, but when the man walked closer to him he could see, what he had mistaken for the effect of the sun reflecting on silk, were tiny mother-of-pearl scales twined together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man himself, although he looked well cared off, looked ordinary, and old, Harry thought he looked as old as Dumbledore himself, but instead of long hair and a long beard, his was shaved, and the few hairs still present on his head were trimmed short and as white as chalk giving the wrong impression of boldness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Grandfather let me introduce you.” A younger voice said from behind them and Harry recognized it immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bill?” Harry ask incredulous and wondering why Snape had called Bill, and who Harry assumed was Arthur’s father, having heard of Molly’s parents’ death not long after her brothers, and finally understanding why the man looked so familiar to him.</span>
</p>
