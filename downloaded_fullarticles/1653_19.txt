    <p>
  <span>Ten year old Remus Lupin, sat on the bed in the far corner of his small bedroom, pulling the dark drapes slightly aside, and looking longingly out the window. Two of the neighbor boys were playing with a ball in the street. Although Remus had a collection of both muggle and wizarding toys, he often found himself wishing he had someone to share them with. He had a very loving muggle mother, Hope, and wizard father, Lynall. However, in their quest to protect him, they isolated him and allowed him to speak to no one. Lynall homeschooled him, and Remus was not allowed outside during the day, so that he would not be seen. Since he was not allowed to talk to anyone, he had no friends and was a quite lonely, yet incredibly intelligent child. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lynall, worked for the Ministry of Magic in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Remus himself, qualified as a magical creature, since being bitten by a werewolf at the age of four. Up until then, he had lived a normal life and had many friends, but now they moved houses any time someone started asking questions about Remus. He was a small, pale, and sickly child, and his parents’ greatest fear was that someone would discover his lycanthropy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doorbell rang and Remus quickly dropped the drapes and took a few quick steps across his room to close the bedroom door incase someone came into the house. He heard his mother answer the door and from what Remus could hear, a man seemed to be inviting himself inside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You must be Hope Lupin,” he said brightly, “is Lynall about?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just then Remus heard his father enter the room and say in a tone of surprize, “Professor Dumbledore! What can I do for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lynall, how are you these days?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m well, and you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am well myself. Now, I was hoping to speak to your son, Remus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“R-remus? Why?” asked his father quickly, “he won’t be attending Hogwarts, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm,” answered Dumbledore, and Remus heard him walk towards his closed door, “is this his room here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er, yes. But- sir-” started Lynall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m sure you won’t mind if I just have a quick chat with him? Perhaps we can all have some tea together after I’ve spoken to him?” Dumbledore cut in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus looked around desperately for somewhere to hide, but turned back to the door and froze when he heard it opening. A tall man with long white hair and a long white beard, wearing bright purple robes entered the room. Remus shrunk in on himself and looked down, but when he peaked up through his curly bangs, he realized the man was not staring at his pale, scarred skin at all. He seemed more interested in the decor of Remus’s bedroom. Once Remus fully lifted his head, he saw his father in the doorway, nodding his permission for Remus to talk to this man. Remus swallowed nervously and went to sit on his bed, looking at Dumbledore. The wizard pulled up Remus’s desk chair and sat across from him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Remus. I am Professor Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where you no doubt know that your father went to school.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus nodded, not sure what to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was wondering,” started Dumbledore, “if you might like to attend Hogwarts next fall?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus’s mouth fell open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-I can’t. I’m too… too ill to go,” he said, hoping Dumbledore would not push the issue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the first time he had ever been thankful for his too pale skin and sickly look, thinking he could pass his illness off as any number of chronic problems. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore frowned at that, “what I am trying to ask, my boy, is if you would </span>
  <em>
    <span>like</span>
  </em>
  <span> to go to Hogwarts, if special arrangements were made for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er, well I suppose I’d </span>
  <em>
    <span>like</span>
  </em>
  <span> to go, but I really can’t, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very good!” Dumbledore exclaimed, seeming to ignore the second half of what Remus had just said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore then went back into the living room, with Remus following him, mouth open to set him right, but not knowing what to say. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now,” said Dumbledore, taking a seat in the chair across from the couch where his parents were sat, “I would love to offer Remus a place at Hogwarts School. I know all about his condition, and accomodations can easily be made for him to go to a secure location once a month.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wha- what?” Remus asked, sitting quickly down on the floor as the world started to fade out of focus with panic at this man knowing what he was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He heard movement and voices, but everything sounded so distant. When he came to, his mother’s face was inches from his and she was telling him to take deep breaths. She had grabbed a blanket off the back of the couch and was now wrapping it around his shoulders, telling him it would all be okay, and lifting up his light body and tucking him into bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just rest dear, we will get everything sorted out. There is no reason to worry,” she smiled as she closed the door, and he fell asleep almost instantly, exhausted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He woke up about an hour later, according to the muggle clock on his bedside table. Still bringing the blanket with him, he tiptoed to his door, listening to see if Professor Dumbledore had gone. He was met by silence, so he figured it safe to open his door and walk back into the living room. His mother and father got up off the couch as soon as they heard his door open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are you feeling, dear?” his mother asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Better,” Remus answered quietly, “what’s going to happen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing bad, and nothing at all if you don’t want it to,” said his father. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” asked Remus nervously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, your mother and I had a long conversation with Professor Dumbledore, and it sounds like he really could keep you safe up at the school. All you would have to do is keep your condition a secret , and you could attend Hogwarts if you wanted to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I- I could?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus had never even considered that going to school would be something he could ever do, and he was not sure what to do, now that he had the option. He had always loved learning, and it would be amazing to go to Hogwarts, but he still would not be able to make any friends there, incase they were to find out about him. Would it be better to be lonely at a school, learning about magic? Or to continue being lonely at home with his family where it felt safer? The more he thought about Hogwarts, however, the more he realized it was an opportunity he could not pass up. He had the chance to become a fully certified wizard, and he wanted that more than anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to go,” he said aloud, making up his mind.</span>
