    <p>It was simply too much. Hermione did not only have a bad week. No, due to the Timeturner that dangled loosely around her neck she had experienced this terrible week already twice. After the Arithmancy essay there had been a moon-chart for Astronomy, a translation for Ancient Runes, and now she was grappling with six-hundred and eight tightly printed pages of <em>Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles</em>.</p><p>She had even brought it to the Gryffindor Ravenclaw match in a desperate attempt to finally get through the Chapter “The Homely Body: Taking off shoes and washing hands”. But her head, already heavy from severe lack of sleep, had started swimming from the constant sound of yells and shrieks around her. While it certainly had been exhilarating watching Harry perform a patronus on Malfoy and catch the snitch she now needed to catch up on a lot of reading.</p><p>She had been moderately successful in blocking out the sound of an entire common room in uproar until Harry came to talk to her: “Did you even come to the match?”</p><p>“Of course I did.”</p><p>It was a relief talking to Harry again after the last two weeks of them ignoring each other. But it did not make her forget that she had been right in informing Professor McGonagall of the Firebolt.</p><p>“And I’m very glad we won and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.”</p><p>“Come on, Hermione, come and have some food.”</p><p>Harry’s pleading look was underlined by Hermione’s stomach grumbling, reminding her that her last meal had been breakfast this morning. But she needed to finish this chapter now. She could not bear to further prolong reading about Muggles clipping their toenails.</p><p>“I can’t, Harry, I’ve still got 422 pages to read. Anyway… <em>he</em> doesn’t want me to join in.”</p><p>A wave of bitterness washed over her as she looked at Ron who shot her a nasty look and said:</p><p>“If Scabbers hadn’t just been eaten, he could have had some of these fudge flies.”</p><p>And that was it. Hermione had been dealing with a lot for over four months of school time now, but now it was too much. She snapped the book shut and grabbed her quill and parchment. It would be another night of lying in her four-poster with her books and quietly crying into Crookshanks’ fur. Head ducked low so no one saw her red eyes, she stormed towards the staircase leading up to the girl’s dormitories.</p><p>“Ooof”, was the sound she heard when she collided full on with somebody, followed by the clinks of several bottles tumbling to the floor.</p><p>“Careful where you’re going”, Fred Weasley crouched down to pick up the empty Butterbeer bottles he had been juggling with. Looking up from the ground into her face, he halted.</p><p>“Granger, everything alright?”</p><p>Hermione exhaled, tried to say something but her voice did not go past the big lump in her throat. She stepped around the bottles and sped up the staircase.</p><p>||</p><p>It did not turn out to be another night of lying in her four-poster. She startled up from her book when a scream cut through the silence. The other girls woke up as well and they hastened into the common room. 

Sirius Black had nearly stabbed Ron. Hermione spent the rest of the night neither shutting an eye, nor even being able to read any more. She was terrified and restless, unable to exchange a word with Ron who had been taken aside by Professor McGonagall.</p><p>Now, Hermione was sitting at the breakfast table, forcing down some porridge. She desperately wanted to make up with Harry and Ron but could not detect either at the Gryffindor table. Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil next to her discussed in hushed voices whether a prophecy they had heard from Professor Trelawney the day before could have possibly been predicting Black’s appearance.</p><p>“She said a ‘dark stranger’- dark, 'Black', come on, Parvati, the crystal never lies.”</p><p>Hermione did not even have the energy or nerves to scoff at that. Two second years- friends of Ginny’s- who had been eating across from Hermione got up and the Weasley twins slid into their spot instead.</p><p>“Morning.”</p><p>“How’s Ron?” Hermione burst out.</p><p>“He’s alright”, George shrugged. “Still a bit in shock, who can blame him. But he’s also kind of milking it.”</p><p>Fred passed his brother the orange juice tumbler, then halted. “Speaking of shock, Hermione, are you alright?”</p><p>Hermione felt a whole lot of emotions threatening to whirl up again, so she nodded curtly. “I’m fine.”</p><p>And she slung her bag over her shoulder and left the Great Hall.</p><p>||</p><p>“No sugar, right?” Hagrid smiled at her, kindly, when he placed a teacup the size of a soup terrine in front of her.</p><p>“No thank you.” Hermione tried to smile back.</p><p>Hagrid had listened quietly when she had told him the events of yesterday night. He gave her an unusually tender embrace when she started crying once more.</p><p>“Ron didn’t get hurt. And don’t you blame yourself for anything. He’ll get over himself eventually. It’s sad to lose a pet. But it’s worse to lose a friend.”</p><p>Buckbeak clicked with his beak from the corner of the hut. Hagrid suddenly looked guilty: “You know you are not a pet, Beaky, you know that. Oh, don’t give me that look.”</p><p>Glad to change the topic, Hermione rummaged in her bag.</p><p>“By the way, Hagrid, I have double-checked the sources on that Hippogriff hearing in 1872… See, if you look at that section…”</p><p>||</p><p>The sun shone brightly the next day and bathed the grounds in crisp February-tinged light. The portraits scuttled around to find a spot in a picture that was hit by sunlight, cramming together to “get back that rosy tint of aquarelle”, as Hermione heard Violet, a tiny friend of the Fat Lady, say.</p><p>Instead of prowling around the common room, Crookshanks lay in a sunny spot on the window-sill next to her and purred placidly. One hand absentmindedly buried in his fur, Hermione was examining the Old Runes table in front of her, furrowing her brows. Either, that was a dodgy “thorn” rune, or maybe that word was a remnant of what Hermione had read about the Godric’s Hollow dialect… she made a note of asking Professor Ruthwell about it.</p><p>Suddenly, she heard a thump in front of her and the screech of someone pulling back another chair. When she looked up, she saw Fred Weasley with a grin and a box of custard creams he had placed on her copy of <em>Runes or Riddles?</em>.</p><p>“What do you want?” She asked, immediately suspicious.</p><p>“Nothing, except be your saviour.” She looked unimpressed as he winked. “Come on Hermione, you seem so incredibly busy with school stuff, even Percy looks like a dropout next to you.”</p><p>Percy who sat two armchairs away, humphed scandalised: “I do not- Head Boy duty is a <em>very</em> important, strenuous-“ </p><p>“Oh, shut up, Perce.” Fred rolled his eyes and opened the biscuit tin. “Have a break, have a biscuit.”</p><p>Hermione examined the custard cream closely, then popped it into her mouth. It tasted fine, but suddenly she felt a strange sensation in her nose, as if it was pulled forward, and her arms started itching. When she looked down, she saw that they were covered in canary yellow feathers. Her nose, as she could detect when she turned crosseyed, had turned into a short beak. Fred’s eyes crinkled up with laughter while he scrutinized her.</p><p>“Not a bad result”, he said, reaching to feel the feathers on her arm. Hermione indignantly swatted his hand away. Crookshanks turned and looked mildly interested at the feathers.</p><p>“You will turn me back immediately or I swear to-“</p><p>Fred hastily fumbled for his wand behind his left ear and muttered: “Reversio.” The feathers slowly trundled to the ground and Hermione could breathe normally again.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“Canary Cream”, Fred shrugged. “We are still working on it, when it’s ready it’s supposed to turn you completely into a bird. Only for a minute though”, he added as he saw Hermione’s eyes narrowing.</p><p>“I thought it might distract you a little.” He shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>Hermione crossed her arms over her chest: “How does it work?”</p><p>“Oh, um, well, we tried it with a tiny bit of Polyjuice Potion first, but you are not supposed to use that for animal transformations for a reason.”</p><p>He shuddered and Hermione had a flashback to her time in the hospital wing, halfway stuck to transforming into Millicent Bullstrode’s cat “Professor Tiddles”. The name had made it somehow even more humiliating.</p><p>“Apart from it being a legally restricted potion.”</p><p>Fred lifted one eyebrow: “May I remind you that last year, <em>you</em>-“</p><p>Hermione’s cheeks reddened. “So- what did you do then?”</p><p>Fred’s grin widened.</p><p>||</p><p>“I wish I could go to Hogsmeade as well”, Ginny sighed enviously as she saw the group of Gryffindors huddled up around the notice board. “I’m dying for some chocolate- Hermione, do you mind bringing me some?”</p><p>She rummaged in her cloak for a few sickles. “<em>Honeyduke’s</em> Scrumptuous Caramel Delight, please.”</p><p>“Of course”, Hermione smiled but refused the sickles. “It’s on me, because you cracked that Ferraverto Charm in Transfiguration today.”</p><p>Ginny fondly rolled her eyes. “Thanks.”</p><p>“Oi, Ginny, are you in for a round of Gobstones?”</p><p>“One second, Josh.” She waved her goodbye and Hermione dropped her bag on an empty table next to the notice board.</p><p>As she unpacked her books, she realised that Harry and Ron stood in front of her. She unscrewed the lid of her ink bottle but stopped when she heard Ron mutter: “Hogsmeade next weekend, what do you reckon?”</p><p>“Well, Filch hasn’t done anything about the passage into <em>Honeyduke’s</em>.”</p><p>And that went too far. Harry couldn’t possibly be so stupid to go to Hogsmeade, now that Black had managed to break into their dormitory? Decidedly, she cleared some of the books in front of her and hissed: “Harry!”</p><p>Harry jumped a little bit and turned around.</p><p>“Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again, I’ll tell Professor McGonagall about that map.”</p><p>“Can you hear someone talking, Harry?” Ron said, viciously.</p><p>“Ron, how can you let him go with you, after what Sirius Black nearly did to you? I mean it, I’ll tell!”</p><p>“So now, you’re trying to get Harry expelled”, Ron turned to her, furiously. “Haven’t you done enough damage this year?”</p><p>Her chest stung at these words. Hermione had been responsible for Harry’s Firebolt being confiscated and Crookshanks had chased after Scabbersquite a bit, but how was she to blame when all she had wanted was to keep her friends safe and to finally have her own pet?</p><p>As if summoned by her thoughts (as Hermione suspected was the case with Mrs Norris), Crookshanks prowled around the table leg and jumped into her lap. She knew it was best to keep him away from Ron. Otherwise, Crookshanks would end up with a few hearty kicks in his direction and Ron with some scratches over his face. When she had put down the cat on her bed and returned to her table, both Ron and Harry were gone.</p><p>||</p><p>She did not tell Professor McGonagall. She was too tired of all the fighting between them. When she woke up Saturday morning, she pondered what to do with the day. Hogsmeade sounded tempting, but there was still so much work to do. She decided to work for a few hours on that essay on vampires for Defence against the Dark Arts. She would use the Timeturner to go to Hogsmeade after she was finished.</p><p>After she had taken her afternoon tea in the Great Hall, she marched up a hallway. Looking left and right, she moved away a tapestry of Bilbur, the Boarheaded Baron. She pulled out the time turner from under her cloak. Just as she went to turn it back, a loud “Ohhhh” made her jump backwards and bump her head against the stone wall. She hastily tried to shove the golden chain out of sight but-</p><p>“Bloody hell, you have a Timeturner! That explains so much!”</p><p>Fred Weasley looked at her, eyes wide open and brimming with wild excitement.</p><p>“Fred”, Hermione hissed and rubbed the back of her head, “what on earth are you doing in here?”</p><p>“Hiding from Filch, but much more importantly, where did you get <em>that</em> from?”</p><p>Hermione sighed, resignedly. “Special permission from the Ministry, so I could take all of my classes. Please don’t tell anyone”, she added, pleadingly.</p><p>Fred nodded, still wide eyed. “Wicked. But are you telling me that you got a bloody Timeturner and only used it for studying?”</p><p>Hermione’s cheeks were burning as Fred laughed: “Of course you would.”</p><p>“Well”, Hermione stuck up her chin defiantly, “now I’m actually using it to go to Hogsmeade. I promised your sister I’d bring her some chocolate.”</p><p>“Let me come with you”, Fred immediately pleaded.</p><p>“No chance.”</p><p>“Please Hermione, what harm could it do?”</p><p>“You are really asking that?” She scoffed. “What about, maybe, you being seen by yourself and wondering what in Merlin’s name is going on?”</p><p>Fred dismissively tossed his hand. “I slept in, only woke up at noon. That’s why I didn’t go to Hogsmeade, I simply missed it.”</p><p>“Well, what about anybody else from your dormitory seeing you?”</p><p>“What should they think? ‘Fred woke up early to go to Hogsmeade? That’s super dodgy!’ Actually, come to think of it”, he paused, “they probably would find that a bit dodgy. I’m only joking”, he added, hastily. “Literally no one would notice. And with George, I could just tell him. We’ve stopped asking too many questions years ago.”</p><p>“Probably for the best,” Hermione muttered.</p><p>“Why should I not come with you, Hermione?” Fred asked, with a smile he probably thought looked endearing. “Tell you, it might actually be nice- I get to travel back in time and you don’t have to go to Hogsmeade by yourself. Heard Ron throwing his little hissy-fit yesterday.”</p><p> He tutted. Hermione ducked her head.</p><p>“I don’t need your pity, Fred. I’m just fine on my own.”</p><p>And with that, she turned to leave, but Fred caught her elbow.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Granger, really. I didn't mean it like that. But, you know, it could be fun.”</p><p>She halted. Maybe it would be. Hermione was sick of being alone all the time. She liked to spend a lot of time by herself, yes, but by choice, not by force.</p><p>“Okay.” She said.</p><p>“Please, I will- okay?”</p><p>“Yes, alright. Come here before I change my mind.”</p><p>And with a surprised laugh, Fred stepped closer to her, fascinated by the filigree clockwork dangling on the golden chain.</p>
