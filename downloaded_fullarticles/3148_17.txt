    <p>Draco.</p><p>I DON’T like potter. </p><p>No matter what the other people from my year believes, I am Totally not in love with “the boy who lived”. </p><p>I am declaring this to anyone who cares to read this.</p><p>I know I did some pretty weird things that may have confused some people. But those girls make it so much WORSE. I mean, I did sit on a tree for half an hour waiting for potter in third year. BUT IT WAS PURELY OUT OF HATE. If you are a straight guy(like me), you would understand that not being able to sit down because of the prickly tree branches is WORTH IT if you get to taunt your ABSOLUTE WORST ENEMY. </p><p>OKAY?</p><p>So let’s assume I liked him at that time and wanted to impress him. IF i did (Which I didn’t), I would certainly stop liking him because I got turned into a muggle ANIMAL afterwards. </p><p>Plus, I’m super super very tremendously incredibly infinitely STRAIGHT.</p>
