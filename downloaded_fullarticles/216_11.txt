    <p>As all bad things do, it happened when Peter was absolutely, perfectly cheerful. He suspected nothing could wipe the grin off his face because it was the Last Day of School. The last day of no-maj school, for him. 'Cause next year, he would be at Ilvermorny, learning Magic. With a Magic Wand.</p><p>He walked into his and his Aunt May's apartment, dropped his backpack on the entry-way floor and noticed lots of boxes. Some were empty, but some were full and shut tightly.</p><p>He found May in the kitchen, pulling dishes out of the cupboards and looking at them before putting them in a box marked either 'To Sell' or 'Special Dishes'. </p><p>"Why are you selling dishes?" Peter asked.</p><p>May jumped, startled, then turned around and smiled happily at Peter. He felt his gut writhe in anticipation of Bad Stuff. "Peter! You're home early."</p><p>"It's the last day so they made it half-length."</p><p>"Oh, that's right." May pulled a mug out of the cupbaord and immediately put it in the 'To Sell' box, which was considerably larger than the other. </p><p>When May didn't say anything, Peter repeated, "Why are you selling dishes?"</p><p>May glanced at him, guilt flickering in her expression before she pasted on an agressively cheerful smile. "Peter, you know we've been struggling on a low budget lately?"</p><p>Peter nodded, frowning. He'd noticed. Ever since Ben died, May had been struggling to find a job and he hadn't been allowed nearly as much treats as before. But he'd thought it would pass. After all, when you're ten years old, you don't quite understand the difficulties of the world.</p><p>"Well," May continued hesitantly, "I've landed a job. It'll pay very well, and we'll finally be able to live normally again. But..." She sighed, turning back to the cupboard and removed several china plates, stacking them carefully in the Special box.</p><p>"But why do we need to sell our dishes?" It seemed a bit backward to Peter. If she had a job, why did they need extra money?</p><p>"There's too much to bring to our new house. And besides, we could use the extra money right now." She wasn't quite meeting his eyes.</p><p>"Hold on," Peter said slowly, "Why are we moving?"</p><p>May sighed. With a flick of her wand, a parade of dishes filed out of the cupboard and into the Sell box, neatly stacking themselves in rows. "Peter, dear, the job I got requires me to be in England to work. I know it'll be hard for you, but trust me, you'll love it there."</p><p>It took Peter a minute to comprehend what she'd said. Then the wires in his brain connected, and a spark ignited and transformed into the hot fire of irrational rage.</p><p>With a wave of magic, May's wand sealed the two boxes neatly. She finally turned to look at Peter whose face had gone flat with shock. He stared at her, jaw clenched, before he spun around and stormed to his room.</p><p>May sighed. This was about what she'd expected, but she'd still hoped to avoid it.</p>
<hr/><p>Meanwhile, Peter pulled an old suitcase from the attic and started stuffing things into it. Several pairs of clothes, a pen or five, a notebook, several Iron Man comics, a large Iron Man poster (which he folded up <i>very carefully</i> of course), an extra pair of shoes, a sneakoscope, a rememberall--</p><p>Suddenly, Peter came across his old broomstick. That certainly wouldn't fit into the suitcase. He looked at the suitcase in question, still open on his bed. He took a deep, shaky breath through his nose and let it out. Then he collapsed onto the floor, sitting against his bed.</p><p>Of course he wasn't going to run away. Where would he run to? May was his only family left, and he didn't know any wizarding families, since May had distanced herself from that world ever since Ben died. But Peter didn't <i>want</i> to go to Jolly Old England. He didn't want to leave New York. It wasn't fair.</p><p>He would soon learn that fairness didn't at all come into it.</p>
<hr/><p>The next week passed in a blur of packing up some of their things, selling others, and generally getting ready to leave the United States behind for the United Kingdom.</p><p>Finally, the next Monday morning, they were at the airport and boarding a plane. Peter would have been more excited at the prospect of flying an airplane for the first time in his life, but at the moment he was more concerned with the fact that New York was now becoming farther and farther and farther away.</p><p>And so it was that Peter Benjamin Parker left his identity as an American behind and became a Brit.</p>
<hr/><p>Of course, it wasn't as simple as that. After the plane landed, the passengers exited, and Peter and May joined the steady flow of people leaving the airport, then arrived at their new home in a small neighborhood, Peter did not settle in. He was being a stubborn ten-year-old instead. At first, May tried to convince him into liking the new house, but she eventually gave up, having more important things to tend to if she were to keep her job.</p><p>It was a no-maj job, of course. May didn't like to use her magic if she could help it. She blamed magic for Ben's death. He no-maj police had said he'd been shot, but of course that wasn't the case. It was actually one of Voldemort's followers, one of the crazy ones that went after every auror ever, which included Ben Parker. Ben had died, and the other man sent to Azkaban.</p><p>May didn't like to use her magic if she could help it.</p>
<hr/><p>Peter did not like the hot summer. It was hot and sweaty and gross, and Peter didn't like that. He hung on the garden fence one afternoon while May was gone for work. She was gone a lot.</p><p>Peter watched as one of the boys in the house across the street tended the garden. Another, much larger and fatter boy watched him, licking an ice cream. Peter wondered why the boy with black hair was gardening. It seemed too hot for such things.</p><p>Peter did not like Surrey.</p>
<hr/><p>On a Saturday afternoon when it was considerably cooler outside than normal, May brought Peter to the park. It made him slightly les unhappy, because May could rarely get Saturdays off.</p><p>May sat on a bench in the shadow of a large tree while Peter climbed around the playground. As he stood on a high bridge, he spotted the boy who'd been gardening the other day. He was looking around as if he expected to be attacked.</p><p>Then there was a shout, and the boy took off running, the other fat boy chasing after him with several other boys behind him.</p><p>Peter frowned. The large, fat boy, who resembled a beach ball wearing a wig, was obviously a bully.</p><p>Peter didn't like bullies.</p><p>And Peter's magic acted up when he didn't like people.</p><p>With only a little concentration, Peter made the fat boy trip over his own feet, landing flat on his face. It happened so suddenly that the boys behind him fell right into him, making a very large, very ugly pile of blubber.</p><p>The black-haired boy with the glasses kept on running.</p><p>Peter did not like Little Whinging.</p>
<hr/><p>As Peter scrolled boredly through memes and messages from his American no-maj friends, he sighed. He closed the laptop and put it on his bed. Making his way downstairs, he looked at the clock hanging in the living room. Half past two. May woukdn't be home for several more hours.</p><p>He walked out the front door and stared across the street. There was an owl on the garden fence. The fence of that fat bully, Dudley. In broad daylight.</p><p>The owl had a thick letter in it's beak. It fluttered to the door of number four, slid the letter through the mail flap, and flew off again. Peter stared.</p><p>That was a wizard owl.</p><p>Which meant that there were wizards living in number four.</p><p>Peter grinned, his first true grin in several weeks. He ran down the front steps and to the front gate. He paused, about to open the latch.</p><p>He would have noticed if there were magic people living there. There were certain signs you could see if you knew to look for them. For instance, the family would likely never leave through thw front door, preferring to Apparate or travel by Floo. This wasn't true with the Dursleys. Mr. Dursley left, in a perfectly normal no-maj car, to go to work nearly every morning.</p><p>There also would likely be gnomes in the gardens, because they preferred magical gardens to the boring orderly rows of the no-majs. This also wasn't true. Their gardens were as orderly as a line of soldiers.</p><p>So the Dursleys simply couldn't be wizards. That meant that one of their two sons must be muggle-born. It obviously wasn't Dudley, the boy had been taken down by Peter's magic every time without fail. If he was a wizard, then his magic would likely have counteracted Peter's.</p><p>That left the skinny black-haired boy. Peter grinned. This was going to be lots of fun.</p><p>He opened the gate and made his way across the street and up to the front door of number four. He kncoked loudly, exactly three times. After a moment, the door was opened by a large, purple-faced man by the name of Vernon Dursley.</p><p>"What?" The man said rudely.</p><p>Peter smiled. He thought himself very good at being polite to rude people. "Hello, Mr. Dursley. I'm Peter Parker. I was wondering if I could talk to your son."</p><p>"Dudley?"</p><p>"No, the other one."</p><p>Mr. Dursley's brow furrowed. Then he snorted. "Oh, he's not my son." Oh. Well that explained a lot. The boy didn't even bear the slightest resemblance to any of the Dursleys.</p><p>"Oh. Well, could I speak to him, please?" He added the 'please' as a forced afterthought.</p><p>Mr. Dursley seemed to think very hard for a moment. Then, he said, "No. He isn't home." He looked quite pleased with himself.</p><p>Well, Peter knew a lie when he heard it. It helped that the boy was peeking curiously into the hallway, as well as Dudley and Petunia Dursley. Peter frowned up at the large man. "Yes he is."</p><p>Vernon didn't seem used to having people argue with him. His face went slightly red. "No, he isn't."</p><p>"He is so."</p><p>"He isn't."</p><p>"Is."</p><p>"Isn't!" Vernon looked furious at the fact that a ten-year-old boy had managed to drag him into a petty argument. His face turned redder.</p><p>"I can see him, you know. I have eyes."</p><p>Vernon spun around, and the black-haired Not-Dursley shrunk back out of the hallway. Peter frowned. Dudley grinned.</p><p>In the next moment, Dudley squealed as if he'd been pinched. "Something bit me!" He yelped.</p><p>Peter gave a very evil grin, which of course nobody saw.</p><p>Then the door was slammed in his face. He stood there, blinking in surprise. Then he let out an irritated <i>hrmph!</i> and spun around, marching down the garden, across the street, through his front door, and slumped back down on his bed, opening his laptop.</p><p>Peter did not like Privet Drive.</p>
<hr/><p>"That boy is one of them."</p><p>"Yes, you've told me!"</p><p>"It's true! He did that to Dudley! With ma--"</p><p>"Don't say that word, Petunia!"</p><p>"But it's true, Vernon!"</p><p>"It doesn't matter!"</p><p>"But that boy <i>knows</i> it! He knows what he can do! I saw him grinning that horrid grin after he-- after he did <i>that</i> to Dudders!"</p><p>"The boy is American."</p><p>"They're all over the world, Vernon!"</p><p>"<small>...b..od.....</small>"</p><p>"<small>....h.s...u..ha.c.....</small>"</p><p>"...Fine."</p><p>"But I'll handle it."</p><p>"...If you must."</p>
<hr/><p>The next day, as Peter and May were having a late lunch in front of the TV, the doorbell rang. May was about to stand, but Peter beat her to it, saying she deserved to sit and relax.</p><p>He opened the door to find, surprisingly, the pinched face of Petunia Dursley.</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>Petunia shifted, clearly not liking the current situation at all. "I want to speak to your mother."</p><p>"My mother is dead."</p><p>"Oh..." Petunia didn't seem to know what to say to that. "Your father...?"</p><p>"Also dead."</p><p>There was a moment of one-sided-ly awkward silence. "Well-- just-- your legal guardian." She managed to spit out.</p><p>Peter turned without a word. A minute later, May came to the door. "Yes?"</p>
<hr/><p>Peter knew he shouldn't listen. He really did. But his curiosity won him over. After all, there was no way Petunia was here to apologize, was there?</p><p>Unfortunately for Peter, by the time he managed to get close enough to listen without being discovered, their conversation didn't make much sense.</p><p>"I don't know if I can take another right now." May sounded a bit distressed.</p><p>"It would be better for him, and for us as well." Petunia was insistent.</p><p>May was silent.</p><p>"Besides," Petunia added, a little desperately, "You've already got one, and you yourself are one, what's the harm in one more? Would you rather he grew up with muggles?" A muggle? Peter didn't know that word, but something nagged at him, some half-forgotten memory.</p><p>May sighed. "I suppose it would be better for him growing up with his own kind." Then her tone became sharper. "And I've heard from Peter that that Dudley of yours is a buly."</p><p>There was an awkward-hostile silence.</p><p>"I'll take him." </p><p>Petunia let out a sigh of relief. "Thank you. I'll send him over with his things."</p>
<hr/><p>"Boy!"</p><p>He shuffled to the door of the tiny cupboard.</p><p>"You're leaving!"</p><p>"I... I'm what...?"</p><p>"I told you, you're leaving! Right now! Gather all of your things, your only making one trip!"</p><p>And so it was that Harry Potter's life was changed for the better forever.</p>
