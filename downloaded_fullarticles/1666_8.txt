  <strong>Chapter 1 - Malfoys in dubious places</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>.oOOo.</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">When they had decided on a plan to raid an illegal hub to trade and buy creatures, Auror Potter had not suspected to find Draco Malfoy inside the well-disguised black market and he certainly hadn’t suspected him to be among the prisoners there. </p>
<p align="justify">But there the deserted Death Eater was, stuck into a heavily warded, silver cage, which was filled to the brim with weres and other beings, all in a bad shape, leaving little space to move as they defeatedly sat on the ground. The cage itself was inside the nondescript Muggle house the dealers and hunters had used as a trading area, located in a not too shabby suburb. But the house was, of course, only a carefully constructed facade. Inside, it looked more like a warehouse than anything else, maybe a rundown bazar, easily ten times the size it should be able to have because of magic. Dust made it hard to breathe and the air carried the smell of rot and mold, barely any light illuminating the room.</p>
<p align="justify">For a few seconds, Harry simply stared at the familiar blonde in shock, still out of breath from running through the narrow paths between cages and crates, taking out one vile hunter after the other with a stunning spell. In fact, the fighting was still going on around them and the Auror probably should have helped his colleagues. But upon seeing Malfoy, he couldn’t avert his eyes. <br/>His fellow 21-year-old was in a pitiful state, looking worse than in their 6th year or even in the war. His cheeks and eyes were sunken in and he appeared to be fairly apathetic to his surroundings, as though he had been given some kind of drug. Seeing the other people were a little better off though, Harry guessed he might have been starving or too dehydrated. His grey eyes were unfocused but still landed on him, briefly widening in a mixture of spite and relief. But after only a moment, the other was back to gazing into nothingness, heavily breathing as though his lungs had some kind of deep-rooted sickness nesting in them. </p>
<p align="justify">A million questions raced through the Auror’s head: <em>Since when had Draco been here? Why hadn’t his parents alerted the Ministry about him missing? What kind of creature was Draco even? </em> But he had no time to dwell on them, when, just behind a shelf full of crates and small cages, Ron shouted, “Harry! Some help-”<br/>This had Potter snap out of his stupor, hurriedly telling the creatures, “I’ll be right back!” He then proceeded to help his best friend, who was also an Auror and had been cornered by five merchants. </p>
<p align="justify">After fighting a few more of the merchants, guards, and buyers, Potter was told to go back to the Ministry by his supervisor to have their medi-wizards look him over - standard procedure after even <em> remotely </em> interacting with creatures of any variety. However, he didn’t feel willing to listen and instead made his way back to the cage. That in itself took a while in the maze-like warehouse. Once he arrived, panting, however, the cage was empty and a worker from Hermione’s Department - the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures - greeted him with a raised brow. “Something amiss, Auror Potter? I thought you guys got rid of the people here-” He, a ratty man approaching his 60s, seemed frightened suddenly.</p>
<p align="justify">“Er- No. The bad guys are gone. Erm… what happened to the creatures in this cage?” This probably wasn’t any of his business and he normally wouldn’t have cared too much - creatures weren’t his job - but this was <em>Malfoy.</em> And, oddly enough, the Gryffindor felt vaguely responsible for the young adult.</p>
<p align="justify">“Oh! We sent them to our Department, of course. They have to be patched up, some surely have to be registered and categorized, families need to be contacted… well, and some have to brought to reservoirs. Deputy Head Granger-Weasley will have quite the trouble coordinating all this, I bet…” the worker lit up then when he was sure to be in safety. </p>
<p align="justify">“Where <em> exactly </em> are they? It’s… It’s kind of important. I knew one of them,” Harry unveiled, seeing no harm in telling the other wizard. </p>
<p align="justify">Face softening in sympathy, the old man cooed, “Oh dear, sorry to hear that. Well, they must be in the lower level of our Department, to the right in the infirmary. But… you’re friends with our Deputy Head - She can probably help you if you can’t find your creature friend.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Thanks,” the successful but overworked wizard breathed out before unceremoniously apparating straight into Hermione’s workplace. They weren’t supposed to do that - Hermione disliked having her ‘<em>work atmosphere disturbed’ </em> - but he ignored it this once. The middle floor of the Department seemed unusually empty currently, only one stray secretary hurriedly running to a desk, scribbling a note on a piece of paper and stuffing it in an owl’s beak before running downstairs again.</p>
<p align="justify">Taking a hint, the Auror rushed after her and downstairs, finding out where apparently <em> all </em> of Hermione’s staff was located. It was a <em>mess.</em> The workers were easily the most silent thing on the usually pristine floor of the building. The noises of various scared, livid, and confused creatures was deafening and it didn’t help that at least a quarter of these creatures were small and able to fly, desperately trying to find a way out of the chaos while screeching on the top of their lungs. The infirmary on the right was totally over-encumbered and the cages, tanks, and artificial nests to keep creatures in were empty, no one managing to get even <em> one </em> creature in them. </p>
<p align="justify">Apparently, the Department had not expected <em> this many </em> rescues coming in and, honestly, the Auror couldn’t blame them. They had not known the scale of their raid, either. <br/>Suddenly, as he froze in the middle of the hallway, he was approached by Hermione. The witch was in a horrible state, her tight bun appeared to have been torn at by a Pixie, her brown suit missed some pieces of cloth, and her face was an overwhelmed, defeated mess. “Oh, <em> Harry</em>! It’s- What have you <em> done</em>!” </p>
<p align="justify">“I haven’t done anything!” the Savior held up his arms but then promptly hugged Ron’s wife, seeing she needed a bit of comfort. “We didn’t know they were so many! Also, it’s not my fault your guys apparated them all at once and <em> without </em> the cages.” </p>
<p align="justify">“Just- Just <em> please </em> help me. Head Peterson is on vacation a-and I- I don’t know, how to deal with this,” the Deputy Head - only recently having been made such - sobbed. “Can- Can you get some of your squad? <em> Please</em>?” Hermione appeared about ready to pass out in his arms, clutching at the thick fabric of his blue robes.</p>
<p align="justify">Again, Harry’s plan to search for a certain Malfoy was postponed as he silently nodded, gave her a pat, and apparated back to the Auror Bureau. The Head Auror wasn’t overly happy about him going on a solo trip <em> again </em> but eventually yielded when an escaped Centaur galloped by their workplace, visitors screaming and jumping out of the way. </p>
<p align="justify">In the end, most of the Ministry suddenly had been promoted to pest control, even the Unspeakables and Shackelbolt himself desperately trying to prevent further damage to the building and visitors by stunning countless, frightened beings and beasts. Even the humanoid creatures didn’t manage to stay calm, instead trying to flee from the hordes of dark creatures and having to be consoled.</p>
<p align="justify">It was only upon nightfall, that a secretary caught the last boggart, which had snuck into her office desk to live in there. Around 10 pm, Harry finally found Hermione again, sitting on the floor, hidden from others behind a plant. She was still inconsolable, thinking she would be demoted now, so Harry sighed and fetched Ron to deal with this problem. He then made his way downstairs again and toward a medi-witch, who currently patched up a Veela’s right wing. “Boy, <em>please.</em> I really can’t patch you up right now- Don’t you Aurors have medical training?” The chubby woman was less than enthusiastic to see him, he short, curly, brown hair already looking somewhat sweaty. </p>
<p align="justify">“I don’t need patching up. I’m searching a creature-”</p>
<p align="justify">“Malfoy? Over there, in the tank," she rightfully guessed, whom he was seeking, "If you tap against the glass, I will personally see to your hand being cut off,” she growled, eyeing a cylindrical glass tank. It stood in a row with five others. One was fully filled with water and housed some squid, another was only narrowly filled and was inhabited by a frog-like creature. Then, there was Malfoy in another tank filled completely with greenish tinted water, floating in it, passed out. </p>
<p align="justify">“W-What kind of creature-”</p>
<p align="justify">The witch breathed out in an impressed way while putting what seemed to be tape around the Veela’s wing, who in turn angrily hissed. “Half-Selkie. Never seen one of those before, only in books. Either, he’s a bastard or won the creature inheritance lottery. ‘Cause I’m quite sure the Malfoys aren’t known for being selkies.”  </p>
<p align="justify">With furrowed brows, he eyed Draco again. He looked pretty human to him and since he was only wearing a pair of boxers now, he couldn’t be hiding any fins. “Are you <em> sure</em>?” </p>
<p align="justify">“Well, he’d be drowning otherwise, wouldn’t he? Potter, the boy’s too weak <em>and </em> passed out to transform. And we didn’t want to risk forcing him to; we only got his gills to open. They’re infected. See the green stuff?” Harry grunted in approval, “Potion to heal him. But ah… doesn’t look too good. They must have mistreated him quite a bit. Maybe dumped him in a dirty pond. Honestly, I don’t want to know. Most of the creatures looked miserable but he takes the cake.” She shook her head before finishing her work and patting the Veela’s back firmly, leading it to a sort of enclosure, where three other Veela’s already rested on fluffy, giant pillows. </p>
<p align="justify">While waiting for her to return, Harry couldn’t stop mustering Draco. He stepped a little closer to the tank, as well, and was now able to see shark-like gills on the other’s throat. Craning his neck, he saw the insides of them were an angry red, probably redder than they ought to be. Whispering, he uttered, “What the hell did you do these past three years…?” After Draco’s trial, Harry had been too busy rebuilding Hogwarts to check in on the Death Eater. Guiltily, he realized he had pretty much forgotten about the blonde entirely. Which had once been a positive sign - if the Auror didn’t hear of Draco he couldn’t have been making any trouble - was now horrifying. What if Malfoy had been in captivity for ages and no one had cared to search for him? Not even Harry, who had promised to give him a chance?</p>
<p align="justify">Water condensed against the glass; the water in there had to be quite cold. Which made sense to the Auror; Selkies were the Scottish version of sirens and therefore lived in cold water. They had seal-like tails. That was about all the knowledge the Auror had on selkies, however. As the chubby witch returned, he asked, “Have you contacted his parents yet?” </p>
<p align="justify">“Of course. But I don’t think it will do him much good. He must have been held captive for a while to develop <em> such </em> an infection and be this thin. If it weren’t for the cold water, he’d be burning up. Malfoys must be bloody heartless to not let someone search for their son. Hell, they could probably have bought him back!” She seemed positively livid, despite her eyes being fixed on Draco’s Dark Mark, which was freely visible now. “I bet they abandoned him because his blood isn’t technically pure anymore…” </p>
<p align="justify">Swallowing nervously, the Auror asked, “Could you keep me informed about his status? If his parents don’t show up…” </p>
<p align="justify">Her face became gentler as she regarded Harry, “Yes… even if it goes against the rules.” She - on a nametag on her chest, he saw her name was Adkins - winked briefly before going on, “He must be glad to have such backup from you.” </p>
<p align="justify">Blushing, Potter clarified, “Oh, he’ll probably be livid I got him rescued again. He’s not one to be erm… grateful. Still, I can’t just leave him like that.” Harry didn’t know exactly why he couldn’t let Draco sort out his own problems despite all the things he had said and done to the Savior and his friends. Maybe it was the hope that the blonde <em> might </em> be a good guy in disguise. “I wish he would simply <em> ask </em> for help sometimes instead of trying to solve everything on his own,” he murmured at that. </p>
<p align="justify">His back was patted slightly, “Maybe he learned this time? Either way, it’s time to go rest now. For <em> all </em> of us, Auror Potter.” She sternly eyed him like McGonagall always had, making him smile. Adkins then covered various tanks and cages with oversized blankets to give the creatures in them some privacy. </p>

  <b>.oOOo.</b>
</p>
<p>On the next day, which was luckily a Saturday, Harry didn’t stay at Grimmauld Place for long before making his way to Hermione’s and Ron’s apartment to check up on them. The night had been tough; Harry had had a hard time falling asleep. This was normal after large battles like these but he also thought the worry for the half-selkie kept him awake. Harry didn't want to lose even more people, he knew. Even if they were snooty pure-bloods.</p>
<p align="justify">Once he arrived at the apartment, Ron opened the door with an equally as tired shake of his head, whispering, “Mate, <em> help me</em>.” Luckily, Harry had had the sense to grab a box of chocolates, which he promptly pressed into Hermione’s hands as she sat on a leather couch, a red blanket covering her, eyes still a little puffy.</p>
<p align="justify">“T-Thanks, Harry,” she sniveled and proceeded to unwrap the first, clover-shaped piece of chocolate. Ron soon came to give Harry a cup of tee before sitting down next to his wife, leaning against her. Harry, who sat on an armchair, always loved being at their home. It was a modest apartment, everything a little cramped in the main room, which was kitchen, living room, and dining room at once. The style was more Muggle-like than anything else, they even had a Tv - which Ron was still utterly fascinated by after over two years. He found the muggle shows very confusing, however, not getting most of it.</p>
<p align="justify">Trying to cheer Hermione up again while old Crookshanks settled on his lap, Harry cast her a supportive smile and said, “I stayed at the Ministry until 10:30 or so. They really did do a good job of patching all creatures up and tucking them in.” </p>
<p align="justify">Her lower lip began to quiver at his words, though, “They- They shouldn’t have taken that long and- what if someone got hurt! They probably did…” </p>
<p align="justify">“‘Mione, it’s okay. Getting hurt is daily business at the Ministry. It’s… It’s not like Muggle establishments,” he weakly tried again, “Magic <em> is </em> dangerous.”</p>
<p align="justify">“S-Still…”</p>
<p align="justify">“But we saved them all. That’s the only important thing. Peterson won’t throw you out, ‘Mione, just because it didn’t go perfect. I mean, he could have come to help out and he didn’t. If anything, he’s to blame for leaving you alone so early.” After a few more consolations and more chocolate, the bright witch finally seemed to calm down again and accept she hadn’t done anything wrong. Harry used the chance to ask, “Did you two see Malfoy?” </p>
<p align="justify">As Hermione nodded, Ron freaked out, “What? Where! That git didn’t do anything-” </p>
<p align="justify">“No, Ron,” she hurriedly told him before silencing him with the last piece of chocolate. “He was among the creatures. But I… I didn’t get the chance to ask, what he was-”</p>
<p align="justify">“He’s a half-selkie, guys. I didn’t even know half-mers were a possibility,” Harry told them and gave them some time to let it sink in. </p>
<p align="justify">The Muggleborn shrugged, “Veelas are very closely related to mers and we know there are half-veelas. I must admit, I never saw a half-selkie before. I would have to research them some more.” At the chance to do so, her expression became even more delighted.</p>
<p align="justify">But Potter told them in a dark tone, “He doesn’t look too good; his gills are infected and he was really dazed when I first saw him. The medi-witch didn’t sound all that convinced he would make it.” The other two seemingly couldn’t decide, whether they ought to feel sorry for Malfoy or not. “I hope he pulls through. I told her to give me updates-”</p>
<p align="justify">“<em>Harry</em>-” Hermione seemed a little angry.</p>
<p align="justify">“Yeah, I know, slightly illegal. But, ‘Mione, I don’t think his parents will turn up. Or did you get wind of him missing and them searching? Besides, when he wakes up, I want some answers,” he apologetically told the Deputy Head, who pressed her lips together to form a thin line, but didn’t scold him again.</p>
<p align="justify">Weasley didn’t see a problem, “And? Then they don’t turn up. Mate, that guy isn’t our problem anymore. Did he even thank you for bailing him out of prison? He’s not worth the trouble.” Both his wife and Harry shot him disappointed glances at which he flushed and made himself small. “I-I’m just saying we helped him enough…”</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione hit his thigh lightly, “<em>Ronald</em>! How can you be this heartless? You don’t stop helping people because you helped them in the past! Who knows, what situation Malfoy is in?” In silence, the Auror started to pout and rub his leg. </p>
<p align="justify">“But what is Harry supposed to do? Stick Malfoy in his bathtub? We can hardly turn up at Malfoy Manor and demand them to take him back if they <em> really </em> abandoned him…” The ginger still wasn’t entirely convinced. </p>
<p align="justify">But the Boy-Who-Lived didn’t mind. If it truly came to that, he’d take Malfoy in if needed. His house was too big, anyway. “Malfoy has to wake up first. Then we’ll see. Fact is, whatever happened needs to be investigated.” </p>
