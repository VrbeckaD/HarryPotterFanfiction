          <div class="userstuff"><p> </p><p>Morning sunlight sets on his face.</p><p>His freckles come alive in such a way that Dean is pretty sure that constellations decide to leave the sky each night to come and rest on Seamus’ face. He wants to lay down and make patterns on Seamus’ nude back, connecting the dots of his moles. He wants to kiss Seamus’ freckled shoulders just to see how stardust tastes like. He wants to interlock their fingers and anchor himself in Seamus.</p><p>He wants.</p><p>He can’t.</p><p>
  <em>Not yet.</em>
</p><p>Seamus’ pink lips swollen and bloody at the edges by nervous bites. The shallow sleep that overcomes him; eyes moving frantically from one side to the other under heavy lids, black bags under them, carrying the weight of sleepless nights, night terrors and nightmares. Seamus’ hands twitch in a way that makes Dean remember a red flash, screams and pain, so much pain, unbereable pain. Seamus’ nose is a bit crooked and a smear of red under it makes the silence louder than ever. The purples and blues and greens around the pale skin makes Dean’s stomach turn in an unpleasant way.</p><p>Dean sighs and looks around. <em>The war is close</em>, they said,<em> the war is near</em>. They should have told them that the war never went away, that they were just soldiers playing childrens for a short time. That future is overrated, that freedom depends on which angle you use to see it. Dean swallows down the sour feeling of bile rising up on his throat. Seamus’ restless body twitches at his side and Dean looks back at him. He’s one of the bravest soldiers out there, with a fierce roar in the middle of his irish chest and a fire ready to burn down in his green eyes.</p><p>He needs to stop thinking.</p><p>He doesn’t want to.</p><p>
  <em>Just wait a bit more.</em>
</p><p>His fingers find a new pattern in Seamus’ hair and he just gives in to temptation. Seamus sighs happily in his sleep and visibly relaxes. The tense line of his shoulder melting down, the frown on his brows softening. Dean smiles and remembers a better time where fire was the cause of laughter instead of tears, where hiding was a game and not a need, where tactics and strategy were just part of a chess board and not vital for their safety. Better times where Seamus could sleep and not have a crippling fear eating his insides and aching his bones, where his bravery wasn’t under test each day.</p><p>Better times.</p><p>Dean wished for them to come back.</p><p>
  <em>It’s about time they do.</em>
