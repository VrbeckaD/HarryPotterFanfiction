          <div class="userstuff"><p>      Ron Weasley wasn't appreciated enough. </p><p>      He was the youngest brother, nothing new, nothing special. The least worthwhile in the family of red-headed blood traitors.</p><p>      He wasn't smart, or particularly kind. After all, what was he compared to Hermione, or Harry?</p><p>     Even his best friend overshadowed him. He was the bloody sidekick, a red shirt. Expendable. </p><p>     Ron Weasley wasn't brilliant, or brave, or as good at Quidditch. He wasn't funny(though he tried) or popular. Everyone knew Hermione was brilliant, and Harry was a hero. No one knew Ron, though. </p><p>    He was the comic relief. The unimportant one. The only thing that made him stand out was his red hair. The part of the Golden Trio that didn't even need to be there. </p><p>    He was the one who had abandoned his friends in the forest. Who let in the goals. Who didn't do his homework. Who was afraid of spiders, and wore the ruffled dress robes. </p><p>   Ron wasn't anything. </p><p>    No one knew Ron Weasley. No one thought there was anything to know. </p></div>
