    <p>
  <span>     Once there was a boy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>      This boy was named after the stars, as was every child born in his family. His name meant </span>
  <em>
    <span>little prince, </span>
  </em>
  <span>according to his mother, and indeed it did. But if you asked his brother, wild and fierce and brave, he would tell you the other meaning; </span>
  <em>
    <span>lion-hearted.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>      This boy, this little lion-hearted prince, was a star, as was every member of his family. His brother was the brightest of them all, and the warmest, too. His parents were as cold and as distant as the night sky, as was the rest of the family. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>      This boy tried. He tried so hard; to be the perfect son, the perfect follower, the perfect pureblood. But then he discovered a terrible, terrible thing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       The lion-hearted prince had no-one to turn to (his brother shone bright in another galaxy and his parents burned cold, cold) and so he dealt with things himself. He had no one to trust, and nearly died for it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       But the thing is; he was a boy who </span>
  <em>
    <span>tried</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The Sorting Hat had pled for Hufflepuff, so great was his determination. It had begged for Ravenclaw, so desperate was for his want for knowledge. It had even suggested Gryffindor, so steady was his courage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       The lion-hearted prince had spent a life in second place, a life hidden in the libraries, a life tucked in others' shadows. He knew, oh so intimately, the power and danger of secrets.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       He knew that he could not die, not now. He could not die while he was still the only one who knew.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       Regulus Arcturus Black fights and struggles and frees himself, dragging himself back onto shore, his hands scraped raw and knuckles bleeding. Every fiber of his being screams in pain, in torment. There is no hope, no light, no life. All he can think of are his mistakes, his failures, his worst memories. No hope, no light- but there is obligation, somewhere. Determination, buried as it may be, to see this through.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       "Kreacher," he gasps out, as the encroaching darkness consumes him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>      He opens his eyes to a lesser pain and a sobbing house elf.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>      "Master Regulus," Kreacher chokes out, clinging to his shoulders. "Master Regulus is awake. Finally awake!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       Regulus opens his mouth, but no sound comes out. Kreacher summons a glass of water from god knows where, and gently helps him sit up and take a sip. He's not as horrifically parched as he had been, in that awful cave, but his throat is so dry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       "Kreacher," he manages to rasp. His voice is hoarse, like it hasn't been used in years, or like he's been screaming. "Where- how-"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        His dear, loyal elf just sobs again. "Master Regulus is calling Kreacher, Kreacher is coming back for him. Family tree and Mistress and the Dark Lord is thinking Master Regulus is dead. Only Kreacher is knowing, Kreacher is keeping Master Regulus alive."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        If everyone thinks he's dead, it must have been weeks, even months. "How long?" Regulus manages.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "Four years," Kreacher wails, tugging on an ear. "Master Regulus has been unconscious for four years. Kreacher is looking after family, but Mistress is dying before the war is ending, and only Master Regulus is being left."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Four years.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>        Four years?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "The war ended?" Regulus rasps out, because he might be half-dead in an empty house, but he still has his priorities in order. "Who won?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         Kreacher is shaking his head. "Not the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord is being defeated by the Boy-Who-Lived, and war is ending."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         "Kreacher," Regulus sighs. "Thank you."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         The wonderful, devoted elf almost bursts into tears. "Anything for Master Regulus! Anything!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         He tries to smile. "Then grab… grab the papers from the Dark Lord's fall?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         Kreacher sighs, snaps his fingers, and the relevant papers appear. "Kreacher is making breakfast. Master Regulus is needing to eat on his own."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "Yes, Kreacher," Regulus replies, and opens the first in the stack of papers. His hands shake as he does it, little tremors that are more annoying than problematic. Hopefully that will stop.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        As he discovers when he tries to stand on his own, in fact, it does not stop. It worsens, and he probably would have fallen if not for Kreacher's timely catch. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        It's now officially problematic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Kreacher helps him limp to the bathroom, and Regulus stares at the bath with no small amount of concern. Standing water, always standing water.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         But Kreacher is a wonder and a genius, and keeps up a constant stream of almost meaningless chatter as he helps him. It does help that the water is warm, instead of the freezing cold of the hellish lake.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         Regulus still flinches, a few times, but there's no mental breakdowns, which is good.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         He's come to an unfortunate conclusion by the time he's managed to get dressed again, with no small amount of help from Kreacher. He's too unsteady, otherwise. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         "Kreacher," Regulus says reluctantly. "I think I need a cane."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        That gets the expected look of worry, and the concerned frown, but Kreacher pops away and returns with one in each hand. The one on the left is made of smooth, dark wood, simply and elegantly carved; his great uncle's. The other is made of silver and ebony, the metal designs covering the handle and tracing down the length of the wood; his father's.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       He's definitely not using his father's.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       Regulus takes his great uncle's cane, and it's enough for him to make it back to his chair in his room. He can sense something Dark and awful down the hallway, in his mother's bedroom, but Kreacher shakes his head. "The locket. Kreacher is trying to destroy it, but the locket is not breaking."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       "It's alright," Regulus says quickly, before Kreacher can start getting upset with himself. "I'll figure something out, and do it myself. I'll be glad to see it destroyed."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       Kreacher nods, and they go back to his room in silent companionship. Regulus has been awake for… maybe an hour, two hours at most, but he's already exhausted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       It's only after he's collapsed back into bed that he remembers to ask something rather important.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       "Kreacher," he asks softly, "where's my wand?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        There's a long pause, before Kreacher just shakes his head. "Master Regulus did not have his wand when he called for Kreacher again. Kreacher is thinking it is in the lake. Kreacher is sorry, Master Regulus."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Regulus stares at him, and runs a hand through his hair. "That's alright, Kreacher. It's not your fault. I'll just- I'll go to Ollivander's in the morning."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "Master Regulus is not going to Diagon less than a day after he woke up," Kreacher says firmly, eyes narrowing. "Master Regulus is going to stay at home and heal, until he can walk on his own!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         That little tirade has to make him smile. "Alright, Kreacher," Regulus agrees, and lies down before he can black out.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>        The next few days are a blur of being almost exactly the same as one another. He wakes up, eats breakfast, flings himself into old newspapers, and falls asleep again. Kreacher wakes him up for lunch, and then he pours over various books from the family library, trying to figure out how to get this godforsaken Mark off of his arm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        He's made very little progress, but he </span>
  <em>
    <span>can </span>
  </em>
  <span>tell where he's going to find his answers; runes. The Mark itself is a sort of rune, and a runic construct can only be broken down by another of the same. If he can manage to find the right set of runes, he can hopefully get rid of the damn thing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Hopefully.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        But before he can make much more progress, he's going to need a wand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Kreacher fusses, but after a week and a half Regulus has a new and begrudging respect for Muggles, as well as a burning need to have a wand again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        He floos to Diagon (he can hear his mother ranting about how unsteadily he steps through, unbefitting of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black) and manages to stay upright. It's a little pathetic, but he counts it as a major achievement.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Fates bless his family's hoarding habit, and the cane and cash he got out of it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Diagon Alley is a sad, hollow echo of what it used to be. The stains and scars of the war are everywhere; closed shops that had been Muggleborn-owned, quieter shoppers and shopkeepers, a distinct lack of outside vendors or stalls.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Oh, it's bright and busy enough, if you don't have anything to compare it to. But Regulus remembers being thirteen and sneaking out of the house in his brother's clothes, meeting Barty in the Alley and buying hot chocolate from the old woman who kept her stand outside the apothecary, laughing as they watched the wild dance on the conjured stage. He remembers looking on at the fierce and unrepentant joy of the street, no matter his parents' disapproval, and feeling it burn itself into his bones.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        But there is no hot chocolate, no dancing, no singing shopkeepers or laughing performers. The war had taken that. Not even the August weather seems to be properly warm, in the face of this odd emptiness. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Regulus burns in anger and shame, and steps into Ollivander's.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        This, at least, has not changed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "Ah," Ollivander says, peering at him from over the counter. "Mr. Black. Is there something wrong with your cypress wand?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Deep breath.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "The old tales I heard about cypress wands are apparently true, when it comes to self-sacrifice. My heart stopped for about two minutes, if my house elf is to be believed," Regulus says evenly. "I'm afraid that wand was lost."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Ollivander stares at him, leaning over the counter. "You speak the truth, Regulus Black."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "I do," he affirms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>       The old wandmaker nods to himself. "I see. Yes, you will need a new wand. Not a water, no, no. Fire. You are fire, now, much like your brother… Pine? Redwood? Vine? Here. Redwood and unicorn hair, try a lumos."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         "</span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos</span>
  </em>
  <span>," Regulus whispers, feeling eleven instead of twenty-two.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         The wand sputters out a glow, but not a proper light. Ollivander snatches it away immediately. "That won't do. Pine and dragon heartstring, give it a try."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         "</span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos,"</span>
  </em>
  <span> Regulus repeats.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         The flare that the wand produces is a deep red, and nearly blinding. Regulus drops it back on the counter even without Ollivander's prompting.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "</span>
  <em>
    <span>Vine</span>
  </em>
  <span> and dragon heartstring, unyielding," the wandmaker announces cheerfully.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "</span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos</span>
  </em>
  <span>," Regulus tries again. This is just pathetic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        The glow is far too dim, this time. Ollivander shakes his head. "No, no, alright. Tricky match, there. I wonder… holly and phoenix feather, perhaps?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         "</span>
  <em>
    <span>Lumos</span>
  </em>
  <span>," Regulus says for a fourth time, tamping down his impatience. He can't force a match to happen. The wand chooses the wizard, after all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         The glow is warm and golden, but the wand feels like it's burning in his hand. Ollivander peers at him. "Fascinating. And, now, aspen and dragon heartstring. Curious, how curious."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         Regulus sighs, and takes the offered wand. </span>
  <em>
    <span>"Lumos</span>
  </em>
  <span>."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>         And then the wand tip lights with the perfect warmth of a summer afternoon, bright and gentle and soothing all at once.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        "Well then," Ollivander says. "That'll be seven galleons." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        </span>
  <em>
    <span>"Father's got a elm wand, because he's dignified," Sirius had said, sitting at the top of the stairs. "And Mother's wand is red oak, because she's, ah, quick to react, I'll say. And mine is blackthorn, which means I'm going to get in trouble, but come out of it stronger. I wanted aspen, but that's okay."</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>        "Why aspen?" Regulus had asked, looking up at his brother.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>        Sirius had grinned. "It's a duellist's wand! But you've got to really believe in what you're doing, and be really determined about it. They say that it's a wand for someone who's going to bring change, that and vine. Ollivander called it a revolutionary's wand wood."</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        Regulus blinks away the memory, and digs the coins out of his pocket. "Thank you."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        He leaves as quickly as he can, but Ollivander calls after him, "But of course!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>        (The door shuts behind him, but he's fairly sure that he hears a faint </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mr. Sterling</span>
  </em>
  <span> added onto that sentence. He shakes his head- Ollivander has always been odd- and walks on.)</span>
</p>
