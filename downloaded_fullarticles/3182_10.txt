    <p>“Qu’est-ce que c’est?”<sup>1</sup> Yvette wondered. Whatever it was, Marcelle was entranced. Since the mail had arrived, Marcelle hadn’t said a word, and her expression was enigmatic. Yvette had skimmed through her all her mail. It was nothing special-- just a letter from Maman with a small allowance. Gradually, she witnessed in confusion as Marcelle’s lips widened, and her eyes grew bigger than she thought humanly possible. They rose at an alarming rate. “Yvette!” Marcelle already had her undivided attention, but this had slipped past her in all the excitement. “Ouais?”<sup>2</sup>she answered unsurely, not prepared for the news she knew was coming. Marcelle was easily excited. Any sort of news could have her skipping through the halls of Beauxbatons, making just enough sound with her heels to attract attention. In this state of mind, she hardly cared. Yvette rarely did either. She knew that everyone already had a strong opinion on her, if any at all. The two girls were in their fourth year, and were far beyond first impressions. They had spent most of their years together, and Yvette had learned more about Marcelle’s nature than she asked for. Still, after four years, this event was a mystery.<br/>
She was reading The Daily Prophet, which could mean anything from the murder of Leonard Spencer-Moon to a new volume of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Although, by the frightful grin on Marcelle’s face, Yvette decided that anything like the former was entirely unlikely. “Il y aura une programme d’échange cette année!”<sup>3</sup>She quickly burst into what looked it should be screaming, but emitted no actual sound-- unless it was too high-pitched for anyone to hear. Yvette smiled understandingly, but she didn’t get substantial information to share in the excitement. She waited for Marcelle to open her eyes again. “C’est tout?”<sup>4</sup> Marcelle was almost offended, until she realized that she hadn’t gotten to the best part. “A Poudlard!”<sup>5</sup> Now it made sense. If anyone wanted to visit Hogwarts, it was her. She didn’t really care that it was a world class wizarding school. That was just an added bonus to the fact that Scamander had been there. Marcelle was sure that if she ever got the chance, she would beg the Sorting Hat to be in Hufflepuff. Of  course, Yvette knew all this. She started hearing it four years ago, and nearly every time that Hogwarts was mentioned.<br/>
Yvette barely thought about her house placement until that very moment. She came to no conclusion because they were quickly interrupted. “Et Ilvermorny!”<sup>6</sup> Marguerite was sitting on the same side as Marcelle, so she was able to read the paper herself. Marguerite befriended them the last year, after being entirely disowned by a group of fifth-years. She crossed the line when she lost someone’s lipstick. Most of the school heard within the week. Marguerite recovered the lipstick after a few weeks, and decided to keep it for herself, wearing it on special occasions. In the same way Marcelle fantasized Hogwarts, she dreamt about Ilvermorny and her house. She was certain that she would be a model Pukwudgie. Occasionally, she tried to get her hands on cranberries to make what sounded like the most delicious treat in the world, but with the war, it became harder and harder to find. So, she only imagined what the dessert tasted like.<br/>
Naturally, upon hearing the news, they were both intrigued. “Il y a rien d’autre,”<sup>7</sup> Marcelle explained. “Comment?”<sup>8</sup> Yvette was invested. “C’est tout ce qu’il dit,”<sup>9</sup> Marguerite insisted.<br/>
“Rien d’autre?”<sup>10</sup><br/>
“Regard.”<sup>11</sup><br/>
She looked. There was really nothing else. Nothing to lead to the rest of the article, nothing to indicate how to learn more information. It was simply announcing the exchange program. They were perplexed for the length of Herbology. Yvette tried to focus on the lesson. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see that Marcelle was in deep thought. There was nothing to suggest she knew where she was, or more importantly, that Professeur Roth had also seen her dazed face. “Mademoiselle?” She showed no signs of listening. “Marcelle Aubry!” She lifted her head. “Comment?”<sup>12</sup> Roth started toward the door. “Suis-moi, Aubry.”<sup>13</sup> They left the room. Marguerite commented, “Penses-tu qu’elle sera punie?”<sup>14</sup> Yvette would usually think not, but she had heard stories of Roth’s reactions to similar situations. In fact, they were already circulating around the class in whispers. One student told the tale of a first-year who was given a mildly toxic potion for trying to correct the professor. A sixth-year was sent into the mountains to find a rare specimen after trying to inquire about it during a lecture. Supposedly, the student never returned. Several minutes later, Professeur Roth returned alone. “Revenons à nos moutons. Qu’est-ce que vous pensez de cette plante? Elle est belle? Regardez, c’est dangereuse.”<sup>15</sup><br/>
On the way to astronomy, Marcelle rejoined them. She did not seem incredibly distraught, although she never did. Yvette examined her expression, trying to find any explanation of what had happened while she was gone. Clearly, she was not sent into the mountains. She showed no signs of poison, although some poisons take longer than others. Yvette did not want to ask for fear that it would be a sore subject. Marcelle was very aware of Yvette’s intentions, and decided to keep it to herself for as long as she could. Needless to say, that was not long. Before they arrived at astronomy, her grin was back in the same way it had been earlier. Marguerite was was horrified by it. She could barely bring herself to look, but her pain was put to an end soon enough.<br/>
“J’ai des bonnes nouvelles.”<sup>16</sup> She had been perfectly prepared to be sentenced to a month of collecting mandrakes, but that was not the case. Directrice Serviot had called her out of class. Instead of letting any student apply, she wanted to recommend people. Anyone who had a conversation with Serviot knew that she had a soft spot for Marcelle. The only problem was that no one knew why. She never did particularly well in class. Her attention span was spotty. She wasn’t very popular with the students, and yet, the Directrice adored her. Everyone made sure that she never found out, which wasn’t hard in most occasions. To hear that Serviot wanted to put Marcelle on a pedestal was not not hard to believe. Although, it would be equally understandable for the Directrice to never tell her about the program so that she would stay at Beauxbatons for as long as possible. In short, Directrice Serviot was constantly confusing the entire student body, while also conforming to each and every one of their expectations. This turmoil was well-known among the students. It became the topic of many conversations. If the school had a newspaper, Yvette was certain that it would be filled with speculation for the Directrice’s actions and reactions.<br/>
Despite Yvette’s growing curiosity for more details, Marcelle had already moved on. She was looking forward to astronomy because they were starting the chapter on Venus. She claimed it to be her favorite planet. “Mais la terre! C’est tout qui compte,”<sup>17</sup> she bitterly argued. She was practically consumed by her curiosity. The professor walked in. She refocused. Yvette attempted to focus, at least. She was much better at it than Marcelle, almost caring about the lesson for some of the class. Still, she could not help herself from wondering the specifics of their conversation.<br/>
By the end of the lesson, she had given herself a good idea of the conversation. She was sure that Directrice Serviot welcomed her to the room, then explained the situation to Professeur Roth. The Directrice would have then dismissed the professor to have a private conversation with her favorite student. From there, she went over the specifics. Knowing Marcelle, it took so long because she kept squealing and asking questions that would be answered later.<br/>
“Puis-je être avec les Poufsouffles?”<sup>18</sup><br/>
“Ça dépend…”<sup>19</sup><br/>
“De quoi?”<sup>20</sup><br/>
“L’élève de Poudlard. Tu vas être où cet élève était.”<sup>21</sup><br/>
“Pourriez-vous demander à Monsieur Dippet s’il peut échanger un poufsouffle? Ca me rendrai heureuse.”<sup>22</sup><br/>
“Mais oui!”<sup>23</sup><br/>
Without even knowing what she was doing, Marcelle had probably persuaded Directrice Serviot into a strange request. Yvette only wished she could know Dippet better so that she could more accurately fantasize about how that conversation went about. Regardless, she giggled to herself at the thought of Dippet receiving that letter. Marguerite took a glance at her while she had gone through one of these quick emotions. She was purely perplexed, and just worried enough to ask for an explanation. It’s not that Yvette had a constant frown on her face, or that she generally remained unamused. It was, with all due respect, completely out of character for her to be giggling without context. Although there appeared to be no context, Marguerite convinced herself that there must have been some kind of context. If it was an inside joke with herself, she at least wanted to know.<br/>
She recalled an instance after knowing her two friends for a couple of months. Marguerite had a comfortable understanding of them, but she was still surprised by some things. In this moment of time, the girls had just left the campus to get some candy. All three of them were elated to find a new flavor of Every-Flavor Bean. Marcelle, however, was less enthusiastic than usual. Marguerite was even more timid then. She didn’t want to bring much attention to herself. She decided to herself that she would let the expert Yvette take care of it without saying a word.<br/>
It took Yvette much longer than expected to discover anything out of the ordinary with Marcelle. When she finally asked, Marcelle explained that she had forgotten her money under her bed. Marguerite automatically offered to pay for her. Immediately, the blonde haired girl beamed with joy. The rest of the walk, granted it was not a long way to go, she bobbed her head like a metronome in allegro. It did not matter to her that the newest flavor was soap. She bounced her head with her unique smile the whole promenade back.<br/>
At the moment, Marguerite was unsure. Marcelle was not likely to notice anything while the professor was lecturing on her favorite planet. She wasn’t sure if there was anything wrong with Yvette at all. There may be no harm in some extra cheer from her. Although, maybe there was all the harm in the world. If this was some sort of defence mechanism, nervous giggling, she wanted to help. She wanted to know how she could help. She still didn’t get to help much. She picked up her quill to write Yvette a note. At that movement, she attracted Yvette’s attention. Marguerite couldn’t bring herself to say anything under such a spotlight; she put the quill back down.<br/>
Yvette assumed Marguerite was going to take a note of something, but ultimately decided it was unimportant. If there was any other explanation, it had to be entirely irrational, especially since nothing about what Professeur Astrète could say in quick review of Venus basics was important. It was possible that something could come up later, but she seriously doubted it.<br/>
The girls talked over lunch. It is assumed that had it not been for Marcelle’s spotty mind, Yvette would have burst because the very trait that caused her twitch her eyes also let her take a huge sigh of relief. Yvette told herself that she would no longer stand for not knowing the truth. There was no point in having detailed predictions if they could not be compared with reality. Luckily for her, she did not even have to bring it up.<br/>
“La Directrice dit qu’elle va trouver une poufsouffle pour moi. Si elle peut, je serai avec les autres poufsouffles, et on va parler de M. Scamander. Et puis, quelqu’un va le connaître, et on va se rencontrer. Tout sera super!”<sup>24</sup><br/>
Yvette was entirely content with herself. She was almost entirely right. She wanted more, still. “Et comment tu l’as fait? Tu l’as demandé simplement?”<sup>25</sup> She wanted to get a full record of the meeting. Marcelle thought nothing of giving all the details. If Serviot had told her, she surely wouldn’t mind if she disclosed all this information. Except, she barely thought that much. For her, anything she had heard was fair game for repetition. Yvette was often concerned about this habit. It was very lucky that she hadn’t gotten into any trouble yet, and while Marguerite thought the same thing, she was much less comfortable with saying it. Yvette had attempted countless times to help Marcelle distinguish from what was private or otherwise, but she failed every time. This instance she let slide for the single reason that she wanted to know everything.<br/>
So, Marcelle gladly explained everything. Professeur Roth had explained to her on the way there that Serviot wanted to her to come by at the beginning of class. He had forgotten until he saw her almost asleep. He jokingly claimed to be planning her punishment, but he knew what was going on with the Directrice. She pulled students from his class a few weeks ago, which was not appreciated, but he could do nothing about it. Most of them were model students, but he was not surprised when she asked for her.<br/>
“Je sais pas ce qu’il voulait dire quand il l’a dit…”<sup>26</sup><br/>
“Moi non plus… Continue.”<sup>27</sup><br/>
When they arrived at Serviot’s office, she was intently waiting for them. She had some sweets on her desk, which Marcelle accepted without thought. She explained to Marcelle that she overheard some of her excitement. At first, she didn’t realize that she would want to leave Beauxbatons, because the headmistress believed that Marcelle was perfectly happy here. Supposedly, as she heard about Marcelle’s reaction, she knew that she had to let her go. And, unlike other students, she knew exactly where she wanted to go, and if she wanted to go. Marcelle reported that the headmistress was at ease when informing her. She had already sent her parents a letter explaining the occasion. The program would last three months starting in a few weeks.<br/>
As soon as they finished their food, Professeur Animard asked Marcelle to retrieve his box of carrots from the kitchen. She was especially passionate about feeding the knarls, which made her a frequent carrier of feed. Animard had other directions for Yvette and Marcelle. “Allez au bureau de Serviot, s’il vous plaît.”<sup>28</sup><br/>
They did as they were told. Yvette theorized that Animard was the one who told Serviot. He probably didn’t think much about it, thinking it would purely bring joy to the Headmistress. Instead, he was losing a faithful student. Of all her classes, Care of Magical Creatures was the only one Marcelle proved to be useful in. Animard was highly aware of this. He heard stories about many of her mess-ups, which obliged him to take her under his wing. Yvette assumed that he would also be writing to Hogwarts, assuring that she was in their Care of Magical Creatures class. She imagined that most of the staff was frantically sending owls to Dippet or otherwise, trying to make sure that Marcelle didn’t entirely disrupt the small school. She was also fairly certain that her meeting with Directrice Serviot was to inform her that Marcelle needed someone to keep a close eye on her. She forgot that Marguerite was also going, and therefore did not account for her having anything to do with the program.<br/>
Marguerite, on the other hand, could only come up with reasons that she deemed impractical. There was no way that she would be any help to Serviot. Animard must have made a mistake when he told her to go to the office, or, more likely, he was just being nice. He didn’t want to leave her alone, and not thinking of anything else for her to do, she was sent with Yvette. That was the story she decided to go with, except she did not fully believe in it.<br/>
Naturally, they were both caught off guard when the Directrice greeted Marguerite first.<br/>
“Mademoiselle Piètois, je voudrais te dire de l’exchange à Ilvermorny. Je suis très désolée, car vous êtes la seule d’ici qui peut y aller. Il n’y a qu’une élève-là qui parle le francais. J’ai essayé si dur de trouver un autre donc vous ne serez pas toute seule, mais je me suis ratée. Je comprend que vous vouliez bien y aller…”<sup>29</sup><br/>
“Oui.”<sup>30</sup><br/>
Marguerite’s simple affirmation had a level of confidence that had never been exhibited before. It was more clear than her voice had been since she had been at Beauxbatons, and its meaning was unmistakable. She was somehow unaffected by everything that Serviot had just told her. There was no reason in her mind that would keep her from going. Yvette would have been impressed, but the small girl went back into her languished posture almost immediately. It was like thought her long wavy brown hair could hide the world from her view if she just tilted her head a little more, but no amount of it would help. She had asked for bangs before coming to Beauxbatons as a way to force her to confront her fears.<br/>
“D’accord. Je vais dire Oreps que vous voudriez même y aller. Il sera ravi. Il vous attend, je pense. Cet école n’a jamais nos élèves à cause des langues… Vous pouvez aller au cours maintenant.”<sup>31</sup><br/>
Yvette instinctively stayed put. She knew that the topic was about to switch. There had been no reason for her to come just to hear about Ilvermorny-- none that she could think of. As Marguerite shut the door, Serviot dropped her smile. Yvette would have been frightened, but she had zoned out of the Ilvermorny conversation. She theorized that it had something to do with Marcelle. (It was the best she could do in such a short amount of time.) She did not need much time to be proven right.<br/>
“Yvette, je comprends que vous êtes l’amie de Marcelle. Car vous êtes amies depuis longtemps, vous comprenez sans doute ce dont elle a besoin. J’ai un peu peur pour elle. Marcelle n’est pas vraiment… consciencieuse. Comprends-tu?-”<sup>32</sup><br/>
“-Oui, je sais bien.”<sup>33</sup></p><p>	The Headmistress fully explained her intentions for Yvette. She had stalled for weeks to decide if it was right to let Marcelle go, if she could go to a new school where no one knew her. Yvette would have thought that she was her mother, except that she knew better. She only wondered how often Serviot had to intervene to keep Marcelle on her feet. This amazed her until it terrified her. At Hogwarts, Directrice Serviot would be just disconnected enough to be inefficient. Yvette realized that she was not just there to watch over her friend. She was there to save her from any misfortune that might come in her path. Should she do anything less, her last years would be slaughtered.</p>
