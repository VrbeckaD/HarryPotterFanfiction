          <div class="userstuff"><p>
  <span>His head was resting against the wall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His head was throbbing and blinking was proving painful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was waiting for his body to slip into the darkness. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They slipped into the house, gently closing the door behind them. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His throat was burning from thirst.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His body was shaking from hunger.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A deep breath caused him to ground his teeth in pain. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They looked around the sitting room; there were no photos of a green eyed boy.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He looked over his battered body.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bruises splatter over his skin like a Jackson Pollock painting.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>New wounds connected bruises together. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Both men noticed a strong trace of magic underneath the stairs.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Underneath the new wounds, pale welts we raised.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Old scars peeking out from the new pain.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Some scars criss-crossed; some didn’t.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>After opening the cupboard they noticed an old cot in the empty space.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His right leg looked awkward.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was extremely swollen and sore.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The front his shin was slightly bent wrong.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>After sharing a pain expression they headed for the stairs.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His left hand swollen as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He couldn’t move his fingers without pains shooting up his arm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It laid uselessly next to him on the floor.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They paused at the door riddled with locks. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He closed his eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He shifted his back slightly, trying to find comfort.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hoping that he would fall into darkness. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They were unlocking the locks when the front door was opened.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He heard his doors unlocking slowly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He grunted trying to pull his legs to his chest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was preparing for another beating.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Sharing a look they opened the door only to stop.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was surprised to hear gasps. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Blinking, he tried to focus on the two tall shapes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were too small to be his uncle.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Whatever they were expecting, it wasn’t this.</span>
  </em>
