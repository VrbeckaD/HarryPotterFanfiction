    <p>Hadrian</p><p> </p><p>Chapter 1: vacation</p><p> </p><p>The water is that crystal clear seafoam blue.  There's an inlet that pulls inward nearly a mile in diameter.  There are underwater caves and tunnels as well as a healthy reef just a few miles from the outer shoreline.</p><p> </p><p>Dad decided we need a vacation after all the trouble we faced.  I don't know if this is celebrating Eric's death or finally being free of him or just an attempt to forget he ever existed but it's something dad especially needed.  So to Australia we've gone.</p><p> </p><p>The whole coven couldn't go, it would've drawn too much attention and left our canton vulnerable.  So we brought Miya and Peyton with us while the older hexens stayed behind.  There was some grumbling about unfairness, all without meaning, so we'll take the others next time.  The girls think it's nice to spend winter break somewhere warm.</p><p> </p><p>The beaches are wonderful.  They're white sand and clear water.  We've gone once with a Kershite group, scuba tanks and all, the first time to learn.  Then we rented a boat and spent three days swimming along the reef.  Even dad is relaxing and laughing more than I've ever seen him.</p><p> </p><p>I know there's no such thing as gillyweed here and boy do I wish there was.  There isn't even an equivilant to be found in this world.  Thankfully I do remember the bubblehead spell even if it didn't work the same here.</p><p> </p><p>I cast the spell, concentrating on the desire to breath under water.  The bubblehead spell should've created something like an upside down fishbowl on my head.  Instead, the spell created a moving bubble over my mouth and nose.  It works and doesn't distort my vision but it took some getting used to.  The girls and dad love it though so we've no complaints.</p><p> </p><p>We stayed still while a trio of sharks swam nearby.  We touched the colorful fish and watched the sea creatures moving through the reef.  It felt surreal, like being in a whole other world.  Miya and Peyton especially took a million pictures it seems.  Dad didn't stop smiling.  Then again, I don't think any of us have stopped smiling.</p><p> </p><p>Dad mentioned knowing where the mermaids live so I begged to go see them.  He warned again that to swim with them could be seen as a mating offer.  Peyton jumped in to say that if we all swim as a coven it should be alright.  </p><p> </p><p>The girls have never seen mermaids before so they're excited.  I'm not sure if they know what to expect or not.  Dad seems to think they'll regret asking but he agrees to take us.</p><p> </p><p>A familiar figure approaches.  Honey blonde hair and sun kissed skin, ocean blue eyes and a troublemakers grin, Marlee stalks over.  I grin, calling a greeting and introducing her to Peyton and Miya.  She's friendly enough, welcoming us all to their little cove.</p><p> </p><p>She laughs when I tell her we were hoping to swim together.  A few others nearby share shark like grins.  But they wave us to join them all the same.</p><p> </p><p>Marlee walks ahead of us into the water, stripping off the swim dress she was wearing to enter the water nude.  A few others do the same.  I try not to laugh, knowing that they're going to woge once we get under.</p><p> </p><p>"They're fast swimmers," I warn my hexens, "so swim fast and don't let them catch you.  It's mostly for fun."</p><p> </p><p>Dad snorts, amused, "They consider swimming to be foreplay and they eat after mating."</p><p> </p><p>Neither Miya or Peyton are deterred any though.  Both are still excited as we strip down to our swim suits and walk into the water.  Dad opts to wait on the shore even if I can feel his curiosity through the bond.  Maybe he'll join us later.</p><p> </p><p>The water is cold at the first touch but it warms quickly.  We walk until the water is chest deep.  Then I motion them both under with me and cast the spells for them to breath.  Both grin, partially woging so their power can help them fuel the spell.</p><p> </p><p>Movement behind them draws our attention.  Marlee and two others are swimming full speed towards us.  They're still in human form but as they get closer that changes.  All three shiver through a woge, swimming past us to circle back out.  </p><p> </p><p>The girls watch Marlee with wide eyes.  Her legs blend into a longer tail with trailing fin-like tendrils and a wide flair at the end.  The flair is a bit like an anglefish but it goes up and down like a sharks tail end.  The tail itself is covered in scales that shine pearl-like with blues and greens.  Her spine gets several fin spikes with webbing connecting them.  </p><p> </p><p>I shove myself forward.  The girls move to follow although they still swim human slow.  One of Marlees companions, another honey blonde with darker skin and brown eyes, swims beside us.  The girls watch her swim slowly past.</p><p>Her hair seems to be part of a webbing that flows down her back, flared out like a cobras hood.  And her face from the nose up seems unchanged except for a scattering of scales across her cheeks and forehead.  I know the moment the girls see their mouth.  Both jump, shoving themselves back and swimming closer to me for protection.  I grin back at the mermaids.</p><p>Because their mouth has sealed and instead it's moved down.  It now hinges on their shoulders.  And the front of their bodies have swelled outward in a way that gives more room to their organs but isn't noticeable from the back.  </p><p>The bottom jaw juts out with many long curved teeth coming up.  The top of the mouth, where a human jaw would be, similarly has many long curved teeth that angle down.  It gives the appearance of that deep sea fish called an angler fish.</p><p>Mermaids... vicious, deadly, and beautiful.</p>
