    <p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Severus slowly walked down the stairs, his hands in his pockets as he came into view. The basement that had previously been his potions lab, was now devoid of everything, except for his new hostage.</p>
<p>With Harry Potter defeated, and the Dark Lord at full strength and power, Severus had been given his rewards for his ‘loyalty’. It didn’t matter that he’d really been on the side of good all along … The Dark Lord didn’t know that … and he had lied well enough to maintain his position on Voldemort’s side.</p>
<p>There was nothing left he could do to aid the light side. There was no one left. No one willing to stand. So Snape played his part and took the rewards given to him.</p>
<p>He stopped at the bottom of the stairs, looking blankly at the unconscious naked girl chained to his floor. The insufferable know-it-all. The bane of his teaching career. Well, her and a few others. Her need to please sickened him.</p>
<p>He saw her stir slightly, but remained where he was. It wasn’t long later that she finally opened her eyes. When she saw him, she didn’t scream. Which in a way surprised him. Had he been in her position he probably would have.</p>
<p>“Professor?” Hermione asked, confused and disoriented. She had no idea what was going on. “Professor what-” She looked around and took in her surroundings. She was in an empty room, stone brick walls, much like the dungeons at Hogwarts and she was … she was naked and chained to the floor. She blushed furiously as Snape stepped towards her.</p>
<p>“Professor please – you have to help-” She paused when memories started flooding back to her. The night before, being given to Snape as a reward for his loyalties to Voldemort. Being drugged and … Hermione didn’t know what happened after that. She doubted much had happened, since she felt find other than the minor disorientation but …. “Please let me go.”</p>
<p>Severus’ face remained unreadable as he watched her gently tugging at her chains, but he felt his cock hardening within his robes, hidden from her view. How strange. It seems he had a liking for her begging. He suddenly wanted to know what it sounded like to hear her crying. Screaming.</p>
<p>Perhaps he could have some fun with her.</p>
<p>Severus stepped forward, his robes rustling about him as he walked and he stopped just before her.</p>
<p>“And why, Miss Granger, should I do that?” He asked, a tiny hint of a smirk tugging at his lips.</p>
<p>“B-because …. You … you were on our side. You … Harry said it was all an act … you were really loyal to us so …. So you can let me go. Voldemort won’t know … you could … you could tell him you grew bored of me. That you killed me. I can hide so they’d never find me. Please.” She said, though her arguments were weak. She saw the look in his eyes, and couldn’t tell if what she saw was real or not. Was he acting? Was he still playing a part?</p>
<p>Looking at him now it was hard to imagine the sensitive, heartbroken young man Harry described him to be. Was that the lie? Hermione was so confused.</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t think I’ll be doing that.” He said, his hand reaching into his robes to pull the button on his pants loose. “Why would I do that, when I can have so much fun with you instead.” He said as Hermione’s eyes grew wide with fear.</p>
<p>“No … Professor no … you can’t. Please.” She begged struggling against the chains harder. “Please no … just … let me go. I beg you. Please.” She said struggling harder as Snape pulled his large hard shaft free from his black pants. He let go of it and it jutted out from the black material of his pants and long jacket. He slipped his teaching robe off and tossed it to the side. “Professor …”</p>
<p>Severus smirked. “Keep calling me that Miss Granger. It’s not helping your case any.” He said as she straddled her chest, his large cock inches from her face. “Do you remember Miss Granger, what happened last night?” He asked, stroking his cock in front of her face as she turned away from him. “No? You don’t remember being given the option to <em>choose</em> your new master … You chose me, Miss Granger.”</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head though she knew it was true. She thought Snape would be the best option. She was surprised she had been given a choice at all.</p>
<p>“You should have chosen young Mr. Malfoy dear. He is all talk, and very little bite. The both of them. I doubt you would have been harmed at all … but here …” Severus smirked. “Rest assured I’ll never hurt you more than you can withstand …  but …. I have far more … unorthodox tastes … when it comes to women.” He said, rubbing the tip of his cock with his thumb. “Look at me.” He commanded.</p>
<p>Hermione felt like she was going to be sick. Her potions professor practically sitting on her chest, his large cock hovering inches from her mouth, if she turned … Her mouth would be right at it’s head. Hermione had never felt more sick than she did right now. Her greasy, ugly potions professor, the man she thought would save her, was going to … to rape her.</p>
<p>“I will not repeat myself Miss Granger.” He said, though Hermione still refused. He let go of his cock and took Hermione’s hair in his hand before slapping her hard across the face. She cried out in shock and pain as red finger prints appeared on her pale skin. “Do as I say Miss Granger and this will be a lot easier on you.” He said taking his cock back into his hand. “Look … at … me.” He said angrier this time.</p>
<p>Hermione could feel tears pricking her eyes as she turned her head to look at him, the tip of his cock brushing her lips. “Good girl.” He said that smirk returning to his face. “Open your mouth.” He said quietly, “And don’t you dare bite me.” He said sternly. Hermione shook her head, tears falling down her temples and into her hair.</p>
<p>“Please, no … anything but that.” Hermione begged, though she didn’t like the smirk that came across Snape’s face.</p>
<p>“Be careful what you wish for girl, I can come up with a number of things I’d enjoy doing to you that don’t involve my cock and I guarantee you, you’d be begging for it as an alternative … Now open … your ... mouth.”</p>
<p>Hermione whimpered as she tried to stop herself from crying, Snape’s cock twitching at the sound. Who knew he was such a sick twisted man? She slowly opened her mouth, barely opening it at all before Snape pressed the head of his large cock against her lips. She closed her eyes tightly as he thrust his thick shaft into her mouth, the appendage sliding against her tongue. Hermione whimpered again.</p>
<p>She’d never done this before, but it was nothing like how she had imagined it would feel like. She always thought a mans shaft would be hard … this was … odd. It tasted like salt and sweat, and the shaft itself was … well it was hard, but it was soft at the same time. Like something hard covered in a soft outside.</p>
<p>She kept her eyes closed as her professor thrust into her mouth over and over again, going deeper and deeper until she felt him hit the back of her throat causing her to choke and gag. He pulled back as she caught her breath.</p>
<p>“If you think this is better than whatever else you had in mind … I don’t want to know what the other thing was. This is foul.” She said pulling at the chains attached to her wrists again.</p>
<p>“Oh you’ll learn to love this …” He said. “And you’ll find out what the alternative was soon enough. I plan on using you in such a way soon enough.” He said, pressing his cock back into her mouth without warning.</p>
<p>He leaned forward, bracing his hands on the floor, her head between his legs as he thrust down into her mouth over and over again, choking her, gagging her, uncaring if he hurt her a bit. She was nothing more than a sex toy … a doll to have some fun with.</p>
<p>He rolled his hips against her face, his cock going deeper and deeper, her face turning red from lack of air before he thrust into her hard one last time, holding his cock inside her mouth as he came hard, groaning as he shuddered against her. Once he relaxed, his cock no longer pulsing inside her mouth, and starting to soften he pulled out of her mouth to hear her crying below him.</p>
<p>He smirked as he stood up, cum dripping from the side of her mouth. “Stop crying Miss Granger. You’ll get used to it soon enough.” He said, tucking himself back into his pants. He didn’t bother to clean her up as he went up the stairs.</p>
