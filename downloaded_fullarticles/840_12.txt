    <p>"WHAT?!" clamored down the staircase, angry that my dad had casually mentioned that we would be moving to London "We can't move to London, that's worlds away." my mind was racing "Plus I can't just leave my friends, and what if Hogwarts doesn't accept me?" I said, my face red with anger. </p><p>"Madelyn, i don't know why you are acting this way, you said you never had very many friends. Hogwarts is a fine school" he said, he walked past me towards a little table in the hallway. He opened a the small wooden drawer which held a small envelope with red seal. He turned around and handed it to me. I looked at it, the seal had been broken. </p><p>"What is that?" I asked though, I already knew what it was.</p><p>"That's your Hogwarts acceptance letter." he said with a smile, "We leave in a week, so start packing."</p><p>I look at him in disbelief, he gave me a weeks notice that we would be moving to a different continent! </p><p>"A week? Why are we moving, is it work?" i asked annoyed, but trying to still be respectful. </p><p>"Yes, and yes, but it's classified." he said looking away from me. </p><p>I decided to end the conversation there, i looked at him with a scowl, and headed up our creaky stairs. Our house, it wasn't much, it was small and old. But i couldn't imagine living anywhere else. I flopped against my bed, and sighed. My owl, Billie, squawked for food, to which i handed her a couple of owl treats i had laying on my bedside table. I just couldn't imagine living anywhere but Brazil, and couldn't imagine going to anywhere but Castelobruxo. After hours of tossing and turning I drifted off into a light sleep. </p><p>Beep, Beep, Beep </p><p>My eyes opened slightly as i looked at my alarm clock, 7:45 a.m. I glared at it as i got out of bed, it's beady red eyes glaring back at me. I walked groggily down the stairs, into the blue painted kitchen. My father had a nice breakfast of eggs, ham, and toast prepared for me. </p><p>"Thanks dad." I sat down at the table with a mad expression, i was still angry at him about the bomb he dropped last night. "It's not his fault we are leaving" I thought, trying to console myself. I straightened up and look at him, i let the corners of my mouth go up a bit. " i'm sorry about the other night." my tone of voice serious and with a hint of sadness. "I just have lived a in Brazil my whole life, doing the same thing, going to the same school. Change is different, change is hard." I said in a calm voice, looking at him with a smile. </p><p>My father got very strange whenever i apologize, he puts on this "guilty face", like he did something wrong. I remember it always being like that even when i was little apologizing for the littlest stuff. Like "sorry i broke the vase, lied, or threw my toys." but he still made a sad face. When he would say sorry he always sounded more sincere than he should have. Almost like he is apologizing for something worse then what he actually did. He made that same face again.</p><p>"It's all right. Why don't you eat and run along, tell your friends about Hogwarts." he said leaving the room. </p><p>I scarfed down my breakfast, almost choking on my egg, and changed out of my pajamas. I walked out the door to tell my friend about the news. I don't think my father knew this, but i didn't have friends, i had a friend, one friend. But that is alright because she is my best friend. She goes to Castelobruxo like me, we met as first years, and we kind of have been doing the same things as each other ever since. I could talk to her about anything and everything. But i was dreading telling her about me moving.</p><p>"Harry Potter goes to Hogwarts, the kid who defeated 'he who must not be named'" said Miranda as we walk through the market. </p><p>"Really? He's like really famous right?" i asked with wide eyes</p><p>"Yeah i'd say if you defeat an evil wizard who tried to kill you, you get pretty famous" she said laughing a bit.</p><p>We walked down the road to a small store with a big sign that read "Gigi's Magic Shop". The store was very small, and all the space was used to store a variety of muggle magic trinkets. Of course it wasn't real magic, just tricked out wands that could make plastic pigeons come out of them, never ending handkerchiefs, and an assortment of playing cards. We walked up to the counter which stood a rather large lady who always had a scowl on her face. Her curly black hair matched her beady black eyes staring down at us. </p><p>"Qual é o seu negócio? (what's your business?)" she asked us skeptically. There was a code that you would have to say to get through. It changes every week. This week it was...</p><p>"It's a great day for Quidditch." i said brightly</p><p>The women turned around pulled out her wand, and pointed it to the door and window. They immediately shut. She turned around again, pointing her wand towards an seemingly empty wall.</p><p>"revelio" she said as a door appeared, and opened.</p><p>We walked through a alleyway leading to a large square. Many wizards and witches moved quickly in and out or the stores. Many booths were set up on the walkway, many with an assortment of potions and charms, some with cramped owl cages. Me and Miranda walked a ways till we reached a small pub, it had a small hanging sign that read "Spine's Pub", the sign gave a groan in the wind like it was in pain when it moved. We walked in, being hit immediately with the smell of strong beer. </p><p>"Two butterbeers please." i said politely. </p><p>Once we had gotten our butterbeer we sat down at a small wooden table, where we talked for hours. </p><p>"I better go, my father will be expecting me for dinner." I said with a frown, this very well might be the last time i would see her.</p><p>"Write! You better write" she said tears filling her eyes. "Even if nothing is happening just write!"</p><p>I nodded, and pulled her into a hug.</p><p>"Bye" i said, tears now filling my eyes. And with that i left. </p><p>I spent the rest of the week packing up my belongings. Our house echoed at every step as boxes took the places of household items. Until the house was completely empty, including boxes and large pieces of furniture. I assumed they had been aparated to our house in Britain. </p><p>"Alright, it's moving day!" said my father as he walked down the stairs his wand out, with his trunk hovering in front of him.</p><p>I ran upstairs to my trunk in my room. "wingardium leviosa" i said pointing my wand at my trunk. I walked down the stairs turning back to the house. "Goodbye." i said as i flew my trunk into the flying car. And our journey to London began, in about 12 hours we would be at our new home. (Lets just pretend that in Brazil there are certain spells an underaged wizard can do ;) </p>
