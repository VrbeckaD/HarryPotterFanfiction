    <p>my name is Kennetheseus Kendall Coo'Kie Christopher Fuzzy Snape. but everyone calls me kenneth. i have a cool anime cut brown haircut and dark black eyes like the galaxy. im Professor Severus Snapes younger brother by two years and im a slytherin pride and true. my bro just became a professor at my school, Hogwarts, last year after graduating, and now he gets to teach me. </p><p>"i can't wait for my potions class next period.." i think while daydreaming about my brothers strong hands stirring the big wooden spoons in the cauldrons.</p><p>"KENNETH WAKE UP" my best friend Chad says, poking my arm and catching my attention.</p><p>"Chad! i told you not to wake me up when im dreamimg about *sighs* him". </p><p>"Him? whos him Kenneth".</p><p>i turn beet red at his question. i know i cannot reveal my secret to him. its snape my big brother. how i long for is solemn expression to turn happy when he sees me. how he smells of ingredients when hes done teaching classes. its potent to me. makes me long for him more than i thought i could.</p><p>"hey buddy... you in there" Chad says while giving me a confused expression. i struggle to speak and stutter over my words. i get up almost tripping on my cloak and run to the bathroom quicker than a rabbit.</p><p>i stop in front of the bathroom mirror and look and my reflection staring back at me. you could tell me and my big brother Severus Snape are brothers bevause i have his eyes. it makes me blush hard. i force my gaze away and wash my face with some cold water to get my brain back on track. </p><p>"i have to get smart and pay attention! i have OWLs coming up!" i say to myself, thinking in the back of my head that my brother could always tutor me if i really needed the extra help. he was always so smart and fluent in academics. shaking my head and sighing, i hear the bell ring, signaling that class is over. i head out of the bathroom before the halls get too crowded and start to head to the dungeons for my next class. Potions.</p><p>while in the hallway i see him. ugg harry potter the golden boy of the school. another similarity that runs between me and my brother is the hate for him. but i cant help looking in his eyes and secrerly swooning. oh gods whats wrong with me. i look down at my sleeves knowing the scares that lie beneth. i want to cry and scream and aaaahhhhh. i hate him and stupid friends. the stupid red head and the frizzy haired bitch. i want to be close to harry but they forced me away from him. now i hate all of them. whatever i realize and keep walking to class.</p><p>harry walks by me laughing with some asian chick and i catch a whiff of his natural musk. he smells of cinnamon, french cologne, and wolfsbane. it makes my heart skip because the wolfsbane smells like snape. </p><p>"i can't believe i have a crush on the chosen one AND Severus.. wtf is wrong with me?!?!?!" i scream at myself in my head. the thought doesn't last long though as i finally make it to the potions classroom, where professor snape is standing by the door scowling at the other 7th years entering the classroom. only i notice the small tug at his lips upon seeing me, which makes me smile back at him knowingly. i walk into the classroom and sit down at the table closest to his desk, where my three fellow slytherins Anthony Tidesdale, Ursula Mermaid, and Nick Digger sit and wave at me. i sit my bag next to my chair and wait patiently for severus to start the class.</p><p>"Alright students today will be a test to see if you can create a potion with ingredents that you shall scavenge for yourself in the garden. all the labels have been removed and you must use your prior knowlege to identify and procure the right herbs, rootsx and such." Snape says to the class in his regular solemn voice. i know its a façade he puts on for hogwarts. i wish he would show his true self and not hide away. i notice snape realizing me staring at him. oh no. i quickly turn my head and begin blushing.</p><p>"you may proceed to the garden at this moment. all except you, kenneth." snape says, making a hand gesture that was like swatting at a fly, making the students scurry out of the classroom.</p><p> "uh oh.. good luck kenny!" Nick says, shaking his head. gulping, i stand and gather my things but stay put in the classroom, waiting until everyone else is gone. closing the door with his wand, professor snape turns to me with a glint in his eyes. </p><p>"in the third greenhouse you'll find all the ingredients you'll need to make a love potion. make haste and don't tell anyone else." he drawls out, winking at me. i blush and nod, touched that snape would make sure of my success. </p><p>"wow, thank you! is that all onii-chan.. i mean professor..?" i say with a blush.</p><p>I walk out determined to get to the third greenhouse quickly. </p><p>" hey Kenneth want to make a p-potion with me" Chad said looking up at. he had a red tint on his cheeks and a sparkle in his eyes. </p><p>" uhhh im sorry Chad. i cant. i need to go. i want to be alone ok." i said. chad looked sad. i hoped he wouldnt cut himself tonight. the long grass tickled  my ankles as a scamperd away. i wasnt looking when i knocked into him. harry. i fell down almost ruining my cloak. </p><p>"aaahhh you complete fool!" i screamed in anger. Harry had fallen down to.</p><p>"im sorry kenneth. i didnt mean to" said  Harry in a sad tone. its like he knew what ron and hermione did to me.</p><p>i looked at harry, sprawled out in the grass and looking fragile as ever. i think about rom and hermioknee and how mean and cruel they are to me, always pantsing me and calling me names. i start to tear up at the thought. </p><p>"you're stupid harry!!!! you could never understand!!!" i shout at him. harry stares back sadly, grabbing my hands and wiping away my tears. </p><p>"meet me in the boys 3rd floor bathroom at 9pm tonight and we'll talk." harry says. i stare disbelieving and nod my head. </p><p>"now let's get our ingredients before professor snape gets anggery!!!"</p><p>I finally make my way over saying hi to Ursula on the way. I see the large brass couldren that was places at the egde. a message was tapped to the rim of it.</p><p>" i hope you succeed in making it" it was written in beutifil hand writing with a rose drawn on the egdge on the page. i felt light headed with love. i longed for snap. but them i remembered im supposed to meet harry at nine o clock. i know what to do. ill make 2 doses of the lobe potion. one for snape and one for harry. oh got in himmel. im a genuis .  </p><p>i begin to pick my ingredients from around the greenhouse by using a spell. </p><p>"accio ingredints!" i say and everything i need in the right portions fly into the caouldron and begin stirrinf and making intona potion. it smells like.. snape..! but wait.. a little bit like harry too? confused, i start to bottle the potion and decide to think on it later. i put a hot pink stopper in the bottle and exit the grreenhous, ready to impress professor snape with my awesome alchemy abilities.</p><p>i stopped my my friends Ursula, NICK, amd Anthony. but Chad wasnt there! oh no. i asked them quickly where he was. </p><p>"je ran away and said not to follow him" anthony said in a annoyed voice. i new he had a crush on chad. i decides to ignor everything else because i remembered snap and the potion. i hid the other potion for harry in the pokect of my black leather cloak. I make my way looking at harry as he made his way into the shool. we al waited in our seets to get our grades. we all put our potions in front of us. i had dyed my potion black cause i hate the color pink. Sanp walked infornt of all of us slowly. giving us the grades. i look over at harry and rom and hermoinkee. they all got bad grades expect harry becaise they are leaches. Smape takes up ebery ones potions but mine whispering to sabe it for later. the hairs on the back of my neck raised up. i could feel hos warm breath on my ear. he smelled so good.</p><p>i start thinking of all the delicious possibilities of what will happen later with my potion. suddenly i start to feel a little erext.. down there. i blush and adjust my pants to hide me hard on. snape looks down at my lap, smirks, and walks on to the rest of my classmates. i pick up my potion and put it in my pocket, next to harry's. snape goes back to the front of the classroom ajd begins speaking. </p><p>"im surprised no one managed to make a show of their.. questionable pyrotechnic abilities. i grade the class as a whole.. C+" professor snape then nods, clasps his hands together, and swirls around in a show of his long, lucious, black robes that twirl and a flick of his pretty, greasy black locks. the class mumbles, surprised that we'd gotten such a good grade. the bell rings, loud and unforgiving, a dark reminder that my hour with snape has came to an end. but there's still the promise of tomorrow that keeps my stomach in a knot. i get up from my table to leave with my friends, but since im the last to head out the door, it shuts in my face, leaving me and the professor alone in the classroom. </p><p>again.</p><p>"Kenneth… it apeers youve done exzactly what i told you to do. good job." i look up at my big brother my</p><p>"Snape i-im so glad your happy" i admire him. hes makes me feel so alive. </p><p>"your doing so well in your clases. to bad. i would of giben you an extra credit assainment." Snape gives me a scandulous look and lifts his eyebrows. i struggle to talk. </p><p>"SnP i-i" i can feel my boty gettimg hot. Snape gets closer to me when the second waring bell blares into exsistence. reminding me i must go. i pick up my bags and rush to my room. i dont care if i miss the class. i cant be reminded of him anymore. as i dash i run into draco malfoy. </p><p>"where are you going" he sneers. </p><p>"you wouldnt want to be late to clas would you kenny". </p><p>"Dont Call Mee Kenni" i remark to him. he looks down to see my erextshoun. oh nooo. i want to die. Draco blushes and winks at me. </p><p>"leave me alone you pervy bastard!" i yell as i slam my door.</p><p>i look down at my hard on and groan. it's hard as a rock, but now im scared of draco barging in or listening to me. being a powerful wizard, i decide to pick up my wand and cast a silencing spell, and then put a ward over my door. </p><p>"there.. stupid fuxkin perv…" i say to myself. then i get an idea.</p><p>"me and snape have a mind link from our childhood, so what if i.. tease him in class?" i think wickedly. in the back of my mind, i bring the mind link to life by bringing ir to the front od my brain. i can see what snape is seeing, and hear what he's saying, and now i know he can see and hear what im doing too by the way he's stiffened. i walk over to my bed and throw off my big, leather slytherin cloak and slowly, teasingly, take of my slytherin tie. i can feel my big meat stick swelling, and i look down at it to make sure snape can see it too. </p><p>"Kenneth.. what are you doing?" i hear Snape think. </p><p>"just wait and see big brother.." i say smugly. </p><p>i touch my pebnis and moan loudly. i masticate and say Snipes name. </p><p>" you are disrupting clas Kenneth" Snape says in his mind stuttering over his words in class. i can hear the kids wondering why snape is sweating. im close to orgasning. i accendently moan harry potters name. Snape is pulled out of his lusty trance. i quickly severe the connection hoping he didnt hear that. i quickly jump in the shower and wash my body. i feel so dirty. i cut my wristed and watch the blood run down. i begin to cry im so confuzed. why cant i be normal. i get out of the shower and dry my hair. i put on my pentagram earings and apply black lipsick. i grap a clean uniform and put my favorite pins on it. mcr, fallout boy, troye sivan logos on shiny enaml pins. i look in my mirror my black hair shines and the white streek stands out amazingly. </p><p>i put hair curlers in my hair to give myself a perm. while i wait for it to curl i slip on my 7 inch high heel black hooker boots to complete my look. i can't believe i moaned harry potters name.. i smash a hole in the wall in agony and bust my knuckles open and they gush bright red blood. i don't bother cleaning it up, instead letting it stain the edges of my black nails, giving me a even gothiker look. i put on my spiked collar (reversed so the spikes go into my neck) and pull the curlers out of my hair, letting it bounce down. it makes me look like a fallen angel. feeling drained from all of the emotions my depressed self usually doesn't feel, i lay down to take a nap, hoping i never wake up.</p>
