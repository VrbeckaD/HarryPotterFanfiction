    <p>
  <span>“Petrificus totalus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s arms snapped to his sides as his mouth clicked shut. The castle floor rushed up before him, but strong arms caught him before he could hit it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He cast about, eyes rolling wildly as he tried to catch a glimpse of his attacker. Who would dare assault the heir of the Malfoy famiy like this? He couldn’t see them, though, even as they hauled him up on their shoulder like a sack of potatoes. His stomach lurched as he felt the ease with which his attacker manhandled him. He struggled against the bonds of the spell, accomplishing nothing. The bitter taste of panic filled Draco’s mouth. He’d never felt a spell this strong before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His kidnapper - </span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh Merlin, is he going to ransom me to Father?</span>
  </em>
  <span> - carried him down a long corridor then turned into an empty classroom, setting the blond-haired Slytherin up against one wall. His forehead rested against the stone. He felt like a board leaned against the wall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something cold touched his neck. With a shiver, the pureblood heir realized that it was the tip of a wand. He was at his captor’s mercy. It wouldn’t take a curse to kill him from there; a first-year’s spell could do it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of a deadly spell, however, Draco felt the wand-tip begin to trace down his back, accompanied by the faintest of sounds. It wasn’t until he felt the cold air between his shoulder blades that he realized what was happening: His captor was stripping him, cutting his robe away. Terror mingled with frustration and humiliation, brewing into fury. </span>
  <em>
    <span>When I escape</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he vowed silently, </span>
  <em>
    <span>My father will </span>
  </em>
  <span>ruin</span>
  <em>
    <span> you, you dishonorable, low-down, disgusting, perverted-</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The wand reached his ass and pulled away. Draco felt the twin slashes of cutting curses on his arms, then the cloth of his robe falling from his body, leaving him in only his flannel underwear. He felt his cheeks flame, especially when his assailant then proceeded to cut those away too, leaving him bare as the day he’d been born. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, his assailant spoke. “You’re pretty cute. Must be all that pureblood breeding - is that what they marry you for; to produce the most fuckable little heirs?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco tried in futility to rebut the insult to his house, but the paralysis spell still held him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin knows that’s the only thing you’ve got going for you; besides money that is. So I guess they’ve got to work with what they’ve got.” The wand returned to the nape of his neck. “Hold still,” came the voice again, then “Cicatrixus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco was sure he’d heard it before, but before he could place it the wand tip burned; not searing-hot but like a stab of pins and needles. Slowly, it moved down, then lifted and was replaced at the top, and made shape after shape that he couldn’t guess at. Finally, it was taken away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you come across that spell before, Malfoy? The tattooing charm. Quick, easy, and pretty close to painless. Nice of me, eh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was mocking him, Draco realized. His captor knew he couldn’t answer and was asking him these tupid questions anyway. When he got out he’d-!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The paralysis fell away suddenly. The pureblood barely caught himself before he faceplanted into the wall. Before he could even get up, though, the voice returned. “Close your eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Against his own will, Draco’s eyes screwed shut. “Stand up and raise your chin. Keep the rest of you still.” The pureblood felt his body obey, even as he tried to keep it from doing so. If the full body-bind had been torment, this was torture. He could move, he knew it, and yet his own body wouldn’t obey him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cicatrixus,” came the voice again, and this time Draco felt the wand at his collarbone. This design was much smaller, taking less than half the time of the first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stand with your legs apart, thrust your hips forward and grab your dick and balls so they’re away from your body.” Draco’s body obeyed, his mind a humiliated passenger. A whispered spell, and then the blond-haired wizard felt his pubic hair fall away from his body. “Isn’t that better? All nice and smooth.” The tattooing charm was cast a third time, this time tracing a simple circle around his member and sac. It hurt more this time, owing to the sensitivity of the skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let yourself go.” Draco did so, gladly this time. “Turn around. Now just stand still. Almost done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A final twinge on his left asscheek and the wand was gone. “Now, sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pureblood felt tiredness descend on him like a physical weight, bearing him down into slumber.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Draco awoke with a start, breathing hard. He looked about wildly, but instead of stone walls and desks shoved against them he saw the canopy of his own bed. He breathed a sigh of relief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was just a dream. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he began to get ready for the morning, the pureblood thought about his dream. It had been so vivid; he could remember every breath of air on his bared skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He retrieved day-clothes from his trunk and began to pull off his pyjamas to change into them when he saw it: an intricate design, seemingly inked in black, right at the base of his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a growing sense of foreboding, Draco stripped away his nightclothes to reveal that, sure enough, his skin was traced with dark lines - at his collarbone, the back of his neck, beneath and surrounding his dick and, when he twisted over his shoulder, a black mark on his ass. They were aesthetic, working to accentuate his own pale skin, flowing along the lines of bones and muscle. Belatedly, he realized that his body hair was gone too, as if it had never been.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Merlin, Morgana and Viviene, it was real</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The world seemed to close in on the pureblood. He’d heard of this kind of magic before, binding spells woven into marks on the body. This was the kind of magic the old families sometimes used to bind disobedient heirs or spouses or mistresses - the kind of magic that needed rituals to break, that no simple </span>
  <em>
    <span>finite</span>
  </em>
  <span> could end. And usually part of any such magic was a prohibition against telling… Anyone…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clumsy in his haste, Draco rushed over to his writing desk and pulled out pen and parchment. He inked the nib and began to write a letter to his father-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco came back to himself and looked down at the letter he’d written. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Father</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I am writing to tell you that I’ve found my purpose in life. I went into the Forbidden Forest yesterday and was taken by the centaurs to be used as their broodmare. They filled me with their massive horsecocks, and even now my stomach swells with their seed. My arse has been remade by their dicks to serve them.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I will not be returning to Malfoy Manor at the end of this year.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yours sincerely</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Cumslut to the Forbidden Forest tribe</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The pureblood blinked at the parchment before grabbing his wand and turning it to ash. He pulled out another piece and dipped pen in ink-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he was done. He looked again.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Father</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I can no longer countenance the derision of muggles by us pureblooded of the ancient wizarding lines. They exceed us entirely in the areas of romance, endowment and sexual prowess, as I discovered when I used the broom you gave me to visit a muggle town. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I was courted and wed by a handsome boy who made love to me with a cock thrice as thick and long as my own microprick, and with such skill that despite the fact I have never penetrated him or had my dick touched he has never come before me. I wish nothing more than to put my magic at the disposal of my beloved husband for the rest of my life, in whatever manner he sees fit.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yours </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Draco Freebairn, nee Malfoy</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>P.S. This is not our actual name; I do not wish you to find us. I know you think you’re doing what’s best for me, but I am happy here.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The second letter was incinerated the moment he had finished reading. So, the magic not only prevented him from telling others, but mocked him with his own hand. Very well. He would simply have to devise a way out of this predicament himself. He was a Slytherin, after all. He would escape these spellbound shackles, and when he did the one who put them on him would suffer the full wrath of the Malfoy family!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A knock came at the door. “Draco! You’re going to be late for breakfast if you don’t hurry up and get out of there!” It was Blaise’s voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I shall be there,” doing his best to inject his voice with noble authority, despite his nudity and rising fear. A few minutes later, he was washed, dressed and as composed as he could manage. He left his room and fell in with his year-group as they climbed their way up from the dungeons to the Great Hall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he went, Draco couldn’t help but let his eyes wander, probing every statue’s shadow for a hidden assailant. Logic said that no-one would be likely to ambush him in a group like this, but he was on-edge. He considered telling someone, to see if verbal communication would get past the geas - but no, it would make no sense to keep him from sending a message but let him speak, and all he would likely achieve is utterly humiliating himself before his peers or, worse, his godfather. </span>
  <em>
    <span>No</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Draco decided. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I need to find the one that did this to me myself, or somehow get someone to realize I’ve got the spells on me without telling them</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Arriving in the Great Hall, Draco made his way with the group over to the Slytherin table and did his best to sink into the familiar rhythm of the day, calming himself. Professor Snape had taken him to task on more than one occasion for his recklessness. He couldn’t afford to act rashly. This was a conflict in which his life and freedom were at stake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He managed it, pretty much. As he ate, the pureblood scanned the throng of students, mentally running through his list of adversaries and the family alliances and feuds. Who would both want to and had access to the magic to do this kind of thing? He watched as the other houses trickled in in ones and twos and little knots of people. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t see Potter anywhere, but the Boy-Who-Lived was practically a muggleborn for all his heritage. He’d never know how to lay that kind of spell, and he was far too </span>
  <em>
    <span>righteous</span>
  </em>
  <span> besides. He did spy a group of three together, though, who he knew to be Potter’s dormmates - information purchased from an older Slytherin, thence gained from a ‘friend’ in Ravenclaw who had a sister in Gryffindor. Neville Longbottom he recognized at once, but it took a moment longer to recall the names of the others; a halfblood, Seamus Finnigan, and a mudblood, Dean Thomas. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something was up with them, though. Draco didn’t remember the mudblood being so tall or broad, nor the other two so… </span>
  <em>
    <span>cute</span>
  </em>
  <span> was the word that came to mind. It was difficult to really tell at this distance, but they seemed to reflexively defer to the dark-skinned wizard, and when he sat down they took places on either side, seeming to </span>
  <em>
    <span>snuggle up</span>
  </em>
  <span> to the muggleborn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’re you looking at?” Blaise asked, a knowing twinkle in his eye. Draco had to fight down a blush. “The enemy,” he replied dramatically, deftly spearing a sausage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you say so,” Blaise said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco had almost managed to put the odd trio out of his mind when an owl swooped down and deposited a folded note in his lap. It winged away back into the indistinct haze of the Hall’s enchanted roof before he could identify it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco narrowed his eyes. That was strange, and given what was going on…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pulled out his wand and whispered a spell to check for curses, jinxes or other magic. It came back clean, revealing only the kind of animation magic used on wizarding photographs. With trepidation, the pureblood opened the envelope and unfolded the paper within. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, he almost didn’t process what he saw; the veins, the rigid shaft, the soft fuzz of trimmed hair at the base, the red head peeking out from under its hood. Then the motion began; a hand appearing from out of frame and beginning to luxuriantly stroke the cock backhand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really, Draco? At the dinner table? For shame.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise’ voice broke into the blond’s thoughts. He slammed the note folded again, realizing that he’d been staring - and that even the brief glimpse had gotten him rock-hard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other Slytherin was looking at him with a sly smirk. “Is </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> why you were so late in last night?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco was still scrabbling for a rebuttal, mind lost somewhere between panic and lingering in desperate lust over what he’d seen, when his body moved on its own, nodding then speaking. “You wouldn’t believe how </span>
  <em>
    <span>full</span>
  </em>
  <span> he made me feel. I can’t wait for him to breed me again, use me as his little boytoy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, thirsty-boy. Ever heard of too much information?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s cheeks burned, and he almost set the damnable thing on fire - but he managed to master the impulse and merely crumpled it in his fist before slipping it into his robe. “I’ll see you later,” he said brusquely, getting up and stalking out of the hall and towards his first class.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Charms wore on, the picture in his pocket weighed on Draco’s mind - and, distressingly, his dick. It just wouldn’t go down! All through Charms and Mad-Eye Moody’s Defense Against the Dark Arts he stayed hard as a rock, and whenever he tried to pull his mind away to something else, to concentrate on the lesson or try to work out who his assailant was it inevitably came back around to the almighty cock in the picture. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had no doubt that it was sent by the same person that had enchanted him, but to what end? Mockery? Taunting him with his own impotence? Certainly, what the magic had forced him to say to Blaise had been exactly the kind of blow to his reputation he’d been trying to avoid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, Defense ended, giving way to a break for lunch. Draco ate quickly, then, having given up on the damned thing going down on its own, retreated to his room to try the other method of taming his rebellious dick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After locking the door behind him and activating its silencing Charm, the pureblood surprised himself with his own ardour as he shucked off his robe, pulled down his pants and sat on the side of his bed, beginning to stroke his painfully-hard member. He tried to concentrate on just getting off as quickly as possible, keeping it businesslike and efficient. Usually it didn’t take too long for him to come - he was a lord, after all, and it was beneath him to do such things regularly. As the minutes wore on, though, he began to beat off more quickly. His erection remained firm as ever, precum slicking his hand’s movements, but the orgasm just. Wouldn’t. Come. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before long, the pureblood was frantically pumping his shaft. The sensation burned through him like fire, drawing pants and moans from his open mouth, but he couldn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>finish.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looked at his wall-clock. Still half an hour left. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tried imagining things, picturing a faceless, beautiful pureblood girl to fuck - but that did nothing. Next he tried a man; handsome, fine of features and round of ass. Even that didn’t do anything for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The damned picture drifted into his mind again, that monumental pillar being roughly stroked in long, smooth motions. Unwillingly, his thoughts flickered to what he could do with the thing. What would it… taste like? What would it feel like to </span>
  <em>
    <span>take</span>
  </em>
  <span> in his ass?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His dick jumped, responding to the thought as it hadn’t to all his ministrations. Draco thought of his wand. Casting the cleaning and lubricating spells would take but a moment…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But no. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>refused</span>
  </em>
  <span> to lower himself like that. Refused to so easily submit to his enemy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a frustrated, still hard and somewhat raw student who slouched into Professor Binns’ class that day, though the ghost cared little. Normally, Draco made use of the period to do homework or idly consider one thing or another, but for now he had a mission: to discover the identity of his attacker. The only clue he had was the picture.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Claiming a seat towards the back corner, Draco sat down as Binns began his lecture. He pulled out a book, then the slightly-crumpled picture and laid it down on top of the pages. Once again, his own cock jumped in response to the sight, though instead of stroking the hands seemed to be more showing off - measuring the length and waving it as if to demonstrate its sheer size. Draco could practically </span>
  <em>
    <span>hear</span>
  </em>
  <span> the silent ‘Don’t you want it?’</span>
  <span> going along with the motions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some part of Draco wondered how big it was, that two hands together didn’t encompass the whole manhood. The rest of him did its best to put that thought out of mind and concentrate on any clues that the image might yield.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hands wore no rings, bracelets or other items, and the dick didn’t seem to have any piercings or similar. The background seemed to simply be wooden floorboards, varnished dark and worn smooth, which could be almost anywhere. However, when he looked closer, Draco noticed something: the bush was </span>
  <em>
    <span>ginger</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unusual hair colours weren’t all that odd in the Wizarding World (changing it was easy as casting a spell, after all) but there was a family known for the trait - a family of Gryffindors, of whom at least one had it in for Draco. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ron Weasley’s a dunce, though</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the pureblood tried to convince himself. </span>
  <em>
    <span>There’s no way he could cast that magic</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Somehow it rang hollow, though. The Twins were certainly more magically capable, but for all that they were vicious pranksters, this didn’t really seem their style. Percival Weasley didn’t even merit thought - too straight-laced.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco cast a glance over to where the youngest male Weasley was lounging back in his chair - and started. He hadn’t really registered it when coming in, but Weasley had definitely grown since the last time he’d seen him before the Christmas holidays. Where he had been slim, now his biceps strained the limits of his T-shirt. Where he had been a particularly pasty example of a teen, now he was tall enough that the pureblood was pretty sure he’d have to strain upwards to look him in the eyes. And where before Draco had had no problems with distraction from the Weasley, now his eyes drifted inexorably down towards his crotch and the bulge visible there even through the loose jeans he wore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck,” Draco heard himself mutter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed as though the bastard had heard him, because he turned and put his hand over his crotch in a motion that could be construed as casual and </span>
  <em>
    <span>grinned</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The bastard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the end of class, Draco was fuming. He’d had to spend an entire two hours just </span>
  <em>
    <span>sitting</span>
  </em>
  <span> there, knowing that the cur who’d done this to him was just across the room, and mocking him besides. He had to be; why else would his hard-on have raged as it had, his body flushed, his mind wandered to what it would feel like to have that massive, muscled form on top of him?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Binns finally called the end of the day, the students flooded out of the classroom. Draco hung back, waiting for his opponent to make a move. Sure enough, Weasley took his time packing up his books and quills. But instead of turning to address Draco, he stepped out into the corridor trailing the pack, as though he, Draco Malfoy, wasn’t worth his time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Furious, the blond stormed after him, catching up a little ways down the corridor. “Weasley-!” he shouted, but didn’t get any further before the taller boy turned and grabbed his outstretched wand-hand. There was a whirl of motion, and suddenly Draco found himself slammed up against the cold stone wall, facing the grinning bastard. Something filled the air, smokey and enticing. Draco’s mouth went dry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re that eager for a kiss, are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once more, Draco found his body moving without his input as the red-haired wizard leaned down, craning up to meet his lips. A moment later, though, the time for lips had passed as Weasley pushed past them with his tongue, dominating Draco’s mouth as he pushed him up against the wall. A knee rose between his legs, pressing hard against his insistent boner. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The blond moaned unwillingly into the kiss as his dick was stimulated. His ears reddenned as he heard the whispers spreading. Even as the power of the tattoos faded and Draco felt his body return to his control, though, he didn’t pull away. Something about the smell, the force of Weasley, the situation, set him alight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the end, it was Weasley who ended the impromptu makeout session, pulling away as Draco chased him, panting. The larger wizard pushed him back into the wall with a hand on his chest, casting a searing glare at the tittering spectators. They scattered, leaving Draco alone with him in the corridor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want those spells off you, Malfoy, all you’ve gotta do is take me to your room. I swear it on my name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Making a split-second decision, the Slytherin turned and began to lead the other downwards, towards the dungeon. Perhaps it was foolish, but Weasley had been honest before. He was raised by the ‘light’ side, after all. Perhaps he was regretting using such ‘dark magic’ on the Malfoy heir? And he’d sworn on his name; the most sacred of Wizarding vows but an unbreakable one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By and by, they came to the entrance to the Slytherin common room. Glancing up at Weasley, Draco firmed his resolve and spoke the password. A section of wall yawned open, revealing the room beyond. There were only a couple of occupants, but Draco felt their eyes on him as he led Ron - no, dammit, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Weasley</span>
  </em>
  <span> - up from the bottom floor, towards his bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco reached the door first, unlocking it. He went to stand aside for the Gryffindor, but the taller man pushed him ahead and closed the door behind him. Draco stumbled forwards and landed on the bed, catching himself on his hands. Standing up again, he turned to see Weasley sliding the bolt across the door. The red-haired man crossed the room and sank down into Draco’s good chair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, here’s how this is going to go,” he began. Draco opened his mouth to protest, but as silenced by a casual “Shut up. As you are now, you’re mine.” The word sends a shiver through the Slytherin’s body. “If I wanted, I could have you strip off and bare your arse to me like a bitch in heat. But I’m not interested in keeping you as a puppet, only doing stuff that I tell you to. So we’re going to stay here, in your room, and I’m going to let you do what you want. I’m not going to do anything to you you don’t ask me to. If you keep your hands off me for an hour and a half, I’ll remove all the spells but the one keeping you from telling people and leave you to do what you want. Understand? You can speak now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-I understand,” Draco said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good. Be quiet again, then. If you do touch me, I’ll let you do what you want, then fuck you into that bed until you scream my name and can’t remember your own - then you’re mine until I decide otherwise. I’ll listen to what you want me to do to you and take into consideration what you don’t. Try to leave before time’s up or attack me… well, you won’t like what happens. Understand?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco nodded, then said rebelliously, “Like I’d ever want a </span>
  <em>
    <span>pauper</span>
  </em>
  <span> like you, Weasley. I bet you couldn’t even afford to keep me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron shrugged nonchalantly, flicking his wand and conjuring a glowing clockface. “I’m sure you’ll be willing to pay up, ponce. Anyway, time starts now.” The clock’s hands began to move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, I need to… </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>do anything to you… sexually?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yup.” The bastard had the temerity to grin confidently, like he was certain Draco would succumb. The Slytherin ground his teeth, then stalked over to his bookshelf and picked out one of the volumes. “Fuck you. I won’t even </span>
  <em>
    <span>look</span>
  </em>
  <span> at you, Weasley.” So saying, he sat himself down on the bed and opened the book. He barely bit back a grimace - of all the books he could have picked, why did it have to be Molton’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>Record of the Ministers</span>
  </em>
  <span>? A drier text he was sure he didn’t have.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Care to make that the stake, snake?” Draco glanced over towards the Gryffindor. His eyes darted immediately downwards. Weasley had opened his legs where before they had been crossed and - yes, he can definitely make out the outline of his bulge. Distressingly, that same outline made it clear that he was, at most, half-hard.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With an effort and a burn of humiliation, Draco dragged his eyes upwards, dreading what he’d find there. Indeed, the redhead’s eyes were knowing, the cast of his jaw smug. He looked away, trying to focus back on the book, but he could feel the weight of other’s eyes on him. His mind conjured images of the rugged wizard’s gaze roaming over his body, picturing his clothes coming off. Once again his dick twitched in his pants. He gritted his teeth. He would endure this, for his freedom.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>When I’m free</span>
  </em>
  <span>, some mutinous train of thought broke in, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I wonder if he’d still be interested.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco quashed the thought ruthlessly, bringing his mind back to the life and times of the forty-fifth Minister for Magic. He wanted </span>
  <em>
    <span>nothing</span>
  </em>
  <span> to do with the perverted sod who’d spelled him into all-but slavery. If his body seemed interested, that was just the magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Minutes crept by, agonizingly slowly. His eyes kept flickering to the other wizard’s </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound of shifting fabrics yanked his head back around as if it were on a cord. Ron was slipping his hands underneath his t-shirt and lifting, exposing a band of rippling muscle beneath. Speechless, the Slytherin watched as the shirt was pulled up, up, up, showing off abs that seemed to run on forever. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, abruptly, they ended, giving way to two mouth-watering pectorals. A wild thread of imagination pictured pillowing his head on the swells of muscle. Finally, the shirt came off completely, tossed carelessly away. Draco didn’t see where it landed, eyes too occupied with tracing the contours of the Gryffindor’s newfound musculature.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure you don’t wanna get a better look, Snake?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco came back to himself, only then realizing that he’d put the book down and half-crawled off the bed. He caught himself, shaking his head against the honey-dripping chuckles of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>damned bastard</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No, Draco. Just stay strong. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Minutes passed once more, but the Slytherin couldn’t help but glance up at the rolling muscles every now and again. Every time he did, he was met with mocking eyes and a smirk that slowly grew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then there was a sound of something shifting again. Draco looked up once more to find Ron standing. He glanced at the clock. Only fifteen minutes had passed since the hour had begun. </span>
  <em>
    <span>That can’t be right</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, I was thinking,” the Gryffindor began, the sheer physicality of him seeming to fill the room. “I haven’t really been straight with you, have I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco almost missed the next words, because the ginger had slipped his hands into his trousers, and was teasingly pushing down the hem, revealing more sparks in his treasure tail, and even more of the sculpted stomach. “I should tell you what I’m gonna do with you - or rather what you’re gonna do for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s mouth was dry. The hem inched downwards.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Once you break, you’re going to want me to touch you, to let you taste my cock, to lift you up and fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>impale</span>
  </em>
  <span> you. But I’m not going to.” A hand moved to the Gryffindor’s fly and popped the top button. “I’m going to get you to strip off, sit yourself at that desk and sign a contract. You’re gonna sign over everything to me - your money, your rights, your shit, </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span> - and only then will I let you taste my cock.” The zipper was agonizingly slow as it came undone, each tooth seeming to take an age. The material of the briefs beneath was white and strained with the sheer </span>
  <em>
    <span>mass</span>
  </em>
  <span> of what it was trying to keep contained. And </span>
  <em>
    <span>still</span>
  </em>
  <span>, from the shape of it, the Gryffindor’s cock was soft. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Merlin and Morgana</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Draco found himself thinking. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I don’t think I could hold that with both hands. </span>
  </em>
  <span>The mental image consumed his mind, cock and balls spilling between his fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re gonna make yourself my slave, my pet, my fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>toy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. You’ll be whatever I fucking want you to be, snake.” The zipper came to an end, and the trousers went down. God, Ron’s thighs were works of fucking art, pure sculpted muscle. “You like that idea? Answer me truthfully.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes!” The word was pulled from the Slytherin’s mouth like a fish on a hook. Draco blushed red as the other’s house colours. He didn’t want that! </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then the images came. Himself, sleeping with his mouth wrapped around that </span>
  <em>
    <span>monster</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Himself, wearing only what he was given. Himself, handing over his allowance to be used as another wanted. The visions sent sparks through his body, straight to his cock. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You like that, you little fucking bitch. You know your fucking place, don’t you? Here, take these.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco opened his eyes - </span>
  <em>
    <span>When did I close them?</span>
  </em>
  <span> - to see something black flying at his face. In a panic, he stretched out his arms to catch whatever it was. His hands met rough fabric, and with a start he realized Weasley had tossed his trousers at him. He lowered the garment from in front of his eyes, and was greeted with a sight that hit him like a punch to the stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Gryffindor was built like an Atlantean statue, every inch sculpted muscle and sinew - and there wasn’t much left to cover it up. Only a pair of far-too-thin briefs that clung to every minute contour - Merlin, Morgana, Vivienne and </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mordred</span>
  </em>
  <span> he could see the </span>
  <em>
    <span>veins</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, of course, he could see the size of the manhood kept barely-constrained by that thing fabric. Some part of him clinically noted that it still couldn’t be more than half-hard, going by the shape of it, but the rest of him was occupied with far less coherent thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t you just come over here to get a better look, if you’re so interested?” Weasley palmed his monstrous cock through the briefs. Draco found himself inching forwards, off the bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sure you wanna give it up right here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words brought him up short. “D-don’t you want that, Weasley?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure. But I want us </span>
  <em>
    <span>both</span>
  </em>
  <span> to know it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> that chose it.” The Gryffindor fell backwards into the chair once more, keeping his legs spread wide. “Though I won’t count it against you if you wanna give those a good sniff,” he continued, waving an absent hand towards the trousers which Draco still kept clutched tight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Almost before he realized, the pureblood had brought the material up to his face and was inhaling the scent, drawing the thick, manly musk deep into his lungs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, wanna get it from the source, snake?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looked up, and couldn’t help a pang of longing. “N-no.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sure? You sure you don’t wanna strip off, get down on your knees and worship me like your fucking god?” The damned </span>
  <em>
    <span>pauper</span>
  </em>
  <span> spread a hand over his crotch and gently squeezed his member. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco let out a little whimper at the thought. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here ya go - wanna have a look at the conditions?” With his other hand, the Gryffindor tossed a sheet of rolled paper over towards the bed. Draco caught it and unfurled it, eyes flicking down the neat type.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is a slave pact!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yup,” Weasley acknowledged flippantly. “Told you already, didn't I? Convenient of you purebloods to have that kinda shit already written up. You know what’s really interesting, though? I had a look around, and the clauses in there ain’t much different to those in a marriage agreement - at least, the traditional kind. So, you’d probably have ended up signing something like this anyway, and with someone you might not care about at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, what’s better: To sign it now, knowing what you’re getting into, or to wait a few years, sign it then, and miss out on all </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” So saying, the Gryffindor flexed his arm, causing the bicep to bulge and Draco’s mouth to dry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“P-pass me the pen,” he whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I said give me the fucking pen!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The muscled man stood and walked over to the desk, giving the Slytherin a delightful view of his tight-cupped ass. He picked up the pen, turning back towards the bed. “Sure you want it? Don’t wanna make a decision we’ll regret, do we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco took a steadying breath. “I want it. Give it here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thankfully, the Gryffindor did. Taking it in hand, the pen suddenly felt like it weighed a ton. Was this right? Should he really do this?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pureblood looked up at the presence looming over him, the sculpted topography of muscle and manhood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Flattening out the paper, he signed. He looked up again to see a beaming smile. “That’s a good pet. Now, does pet want a treat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco climbed to his knees on the bed and shuffled forwards, suddenly unsure. He’d never done anything like this before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, pet. Pull them down,” the Gryffindor said, guiding Draco’s hands with his own. Fingers slipped beneath the waistband, then tugged. All at once the shaft was revealed, base nestled in a neat nest of orange curls. “Go on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hesitantly, Draco moved his head forwards, extended his tongue and got his first taste of his master.</span>
