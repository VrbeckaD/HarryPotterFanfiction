    <p>The first time Harry encountered a dementor he didn’t sleep for a week. He woke up with dazzling green lights in his eyes and thoughts saturated in death.</p><p> </p><p>The first time Harry woke of screaming his dorm mates tried to be sympathetic.</p><p>They were good people. Each and every one of them. They were also growing boys and when you’re growing sleep is very important. It’s also important not to trivialise their need for sleep. With not enough sleep to be functioning at their best, they understandably got a little ratty.</p><p>The second time Harry woke up screaming Seamus and Dean were less sympathetic and despite telling Harry that he understood, Ron was snappish for the rest of the day. He didn’t really understand. How could he when the kinds of things that make people scream the way Harry did were so foreign to him?</p><p> </p><p>There wasn’t a third time.</p><p> </p><p>It’s hard to wake up screaming if you never sleep at all.</p><p> </p><p>The only problem with his new coping mechanism was that he started losing focus, forgetting things. It started small, inconsequential.</p><p>Harry was never particularly studious in the first place, nobody found it overly suspicious when</p><p>Harry missed breakfast to finish last minute herbology homework.</p><p> </p><p>The thing was he wasn’t just forgetful, he was tired. Going all the way to the great hall was so much effort and he wasn’t hungry anyway.</p><p>Except he was hungry. He just didn’t recognise the weakness and gnawing in his stomachs.</p><p>It was Hermione who realised. When Harry fell asleep for 30-second increments and was talking to somebody a second later. When Harry attempted to say the same thing five times but lost his train of thought each time. When Harry vomited from hunger and nothing, but bile came up despite the fact he should have eaten only 10 minutes prior.</p><p>Hermione leads him to the hospital wing. She knew he wouldn’t come willingly, and she had 10 excuses already forming on her tongue, but Harry wasn’t even lucid enough to ask where they were going. He just followed her freely.</p><p>Madame Pomphrey attempted to lecture him, but Harry’s eyes were glazed, and he was humming nonsense. She fed harry a nutrition potion and then dosed him with a sedative.</p><p>Hermione came back four hours later when he was awake and lucid. She ran her hands softly through his hair and informed him that he has just got to take better care of himself and then begged him to please tell her what’s going on.</p><p>He didn’t tell her much, just that he didn’t want to wake up the other boys in his dorm. She reluctantly taught him a silencing charm but not before informing him this was not a solution. She tried to get him to talk to her, but he was reticent as always so finally she accepted that at least he would get some sleep. She urged him to talk to her one last time, but Harry didn’t really know what that meant.</p><p>He still woke up with death on his tongue, but he learnt a silencing charm. If a child screams in a room and nobody hears, did he ever scream at all?</p><p> </p><p>---</p><p>The second time Harry encountered a dementor he fell and fell and fell. When his fear and cold addled mind heard his mother, he thought maybe this is it. Maybe I’m finally going home. After all, home is where the heart is, and Harry’s heart will always lie with his family.</p><p>When Harry wakes up, he can’t help feeling faintly disappointed.</p><p>Hermione hugs him so hard he thinks he might suffocate but then she leaves. Then he’s alone. He lays there amidst the remnants of his broom and his misery.</p><p>Then, he receives another visitor.</p><p>Cedric Diggory is all long limbs and smooth skin. Harry recognises him, he’s seen him before, but only in the vague way, he’s seen every student in the school.</p><p>When Cedric rubs his hands nervously up and down his jeans before whispering a tentative, “Hey”. All Harry can do is stare for a bit.</p><p>The greeting hangs in the air for a beat until Harry swallows his confusion and musters an equally as tentative, “Hi.’</p><p>“You must be wondering why I’m here.” Cedric is now shifting from side to side nervously.</p><p>Really Harry hadn’t been wondering that at all. He was still a little hung up on the long legs and smooth skin thing. He swallows a little at the ridiculousness of that thought and manages to process what Cedric had just said.</p><p>“Sort of,” Harry admitted, “You should take a seat though,” Harry offers before adding belatedly, “if you plan on staying that is.” Harry doesn’t know what to do with this random stranger in his room. Suddenly he wishes he’d paid attention to the way Mrs Figgs sometimes ranted about manners and making conversation, maybe those skills would have come in handy now.</p><p>Cedric smiled softly and sat down. “I just wanted to see how you were doing, and, apologies I guess.’</p><p>Harry frowned “What do you have to apologize about? From what my friends told me you were pretty decent about the whole thing.” More than decent. Harry can be a bit single-minded when it comes to Quidditch. He probably wouldn’t have been able to shift his focus from winning to being decent in the way Hermione described Hermione.</p><p>Cedric seems a little frustrated by Harry’s response. Harry finds it confusing that Cedric is frustrated by being complimented “I just think, it wasn’t fair on you.”</p><p>Harry shrugged, “there are worse things than losing a Quidditch match.”</p><p>Cedric laughed lightly, “tell my father that”.</p><p>Harry was smiling now too now.</p><p>Then he processes what Cedric said and is suddenly very unsure about how he feels, “did you say you were checking up on me?”</p><p>Cedric ducks his head and he peevishly mutters, “shut up.”</p><p>Rude, the unhelpful part of Harry’s brain supplies.</p><p>Cedric sobers quickly, drawing Harry’s attention. “You were so pale Harry. I ‘d just caught the snitch and I thought everybody was cheering but then I realised they were screaming, and you were right below me and you were so, so pale.”</p><p>“Oh.” Maybe Cedric hadn’t been frustrated earlier so much as distressed. Harry might be projecting a little. He’s definitely distressed.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Cedric is looking at him intently now, none of his previous nervousness is showing. Harry wants the nervousness back. Cedric looks so earnest right now. Harry doesn’t know how to do earnest. Why is earnest and emotion people do?</p><p>Then Harry catches Cedric’s eye. There’s something about the intensity of the way Cedric is holding himself that startles Harry into responding honestly, “I’ll be okay.”</p><p> “Do you mind me asking?” Cedric waits for a breath till Harry nods in confirmation. “What, what do-“</p><p>“The dementors do to me?” Harry asks, not unkindly. Cedric nods.</p><p>“I see my parents.” Harry isn’t sure what brought on this admission but he’s glad to tell someone.</p><p>“You must miss them.” Cedric supplies.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Cedric opens his mouth like he’s about to ask something else but seems to think better of it and stands awkwardly.</p><p>The “See you around Potter.” Cedric throws over his shoulder echoes in Harry’s head the whole night.</p><p> </p><p>After that Harry sees Cedric all the bloody time. Sees him in the great hall, on the way to classes, in the library. Harry feels like a stalker and wonders if they always saw each other this much? Maybe he just didn’t have the incentive to notice. It irritates him because he so wants to go up to him and start a conversation but there is never a good enough excuse.</p><p>He doesn’t dwell on it too much. He’s a bit distracted with Hermione running herself ragged, trying to convince her to drop something has been challenging to say the least. She’s just as obstinate as him. Harry thinks that may be why they’re friends. Maybe Hermione is the only person in the world who can deal with his blatant hypocrisy.</p><p>Harry was lying before, he still dwells on the Cedric of it all but he likes to pretend.</p><p> </p><p>---</p><p>He finally finds a reason to talk to Cedric when he runs into him at Honeydukes. The only issue is Harry is invisible. Also, he broke more than a few rules to be there and Cedric was a prefect. Its super inconvenient.</p><p>He doesn’t see Cedric when he enters Honeydukes. He’s too focused on finding Ron and Hermione. It wouldn’t have been an issue if he had just briefly bumped sides with him. He could’ve just kept moving and Cedric would’ve passed it off as mild inconsequential delusion. However, Harry’s luck is always the worst (or the best) so he runs smack bang into him. He ends up with his head smashed in Cedric’s chest and Cedric grabs him instinctually.</p><p>They’re right at the back of Honeydukes behind most of the shelves so nobody sees them. Harry thinks this is a very poor start to his career as a vigilante. Maybe he doesn’t deserve the Marauders map.</p><p>Despite having a squished nose Harry thinks that this is the warmest he’s been since he stepped out of Hogwarts into the snow. Before he has a chance to contemplate staying there forever Cedric is stepping back and the invisibility cloak falls unceremoniously on the floor.</p><p>“Harry!?”</p><p>Before Harry can even think about what he’s doing he’s standing on his tiptoes with his hand pressed against Cedric’s mouth hissing, ‘shh!” When Harry realises what he’s done he quickly pulls his hand back.</p><p>He looks up cautiously, expecting Cedric to be mad. He is both relieved and thoroughly humiliated to find him laughing. Absently Harry thinks laughter is a good look on Cedric and has an insane urge to run his finger over Cedric’s dimples.</p><p>“Why are you skulking around back here?” Harry would tell him except they’ve only talked twice. Harry has learnt telling strangers’ secrets is bad for your sanity and you know Harry’s budding criminal aspirations might take a hit if he starts spilling his guts to prefects.</p><p>So, like a petulant child, Harry says, “what are you doing skulking around back here?”</p><p>Cedric is smirking at him now and Harry’s stomach swoops dangerously. “Well, I wasn’t wandering around under a disillusionment charm so nothing nearly as nefarious as whatever you are up to.”</p><p>“disollusi-a-what?”</p><p>“Come on now Harry no need to lie to me, it’s a Hogsmeade weekend I’m off duty,” Cedric says ginning lazily.</p><p>Harry wants to lie. He really does, but he finds himself explaining things before he even knows what he’s saying. He manages to censor the story a bit. He doesn’t tell Cedric about the map or the or the secret passageway. Just says he snuck out of Hogwarts because he missed his friends. He thinks if Cedric draws his own conclusions about dissilusi-thingies then that’s not his problem. Serves him right for making assumptions.</p><p>Cedric’s looking at him with a soft sort of sadness. “Harry, you can’t be out here right now.”</p><p>Harry didn’t know what he expected, but it wasn’t that Cedric would turn him in. He supposes this is his comeuppance for telling this almost stranger his secrets.</p><p>“Don’t look at me like that. No really, please. I don’t care that you broke the rules. Harry. Harry.” Harry was just bending down to gather up his cloak and then possibly fleeing when Cedric grabs his hand and spins him, so they’re face to face. “Harry, some of my friends decided not to come today because of Sirius Black.”</p><p>Now Harry is flinching for entirely different reasons than before. “Not this nonsense again.”</p><p>“Harry there is a serial killer out there trying to murder you, you shouldn’t risk your life for something as insignificant as a singular Hogsmeade weekend.”</p><p>Harry is less than impressed. “The serial killer that’s after me has been after me my entire life. He almost managed to murder me thrice. Once in my own home and twice at Hogwarts. So statistically speaking if it's him your worried about then this is exactly where you want me to be. Well, here or wrapped in bubble wrap somewhere underground and heavily fortified. If it’s the mass murderer after me your worried about, forgive me if some low life servant doesn’t scare me nearly as much as the Dark Lord.”</p><p>Then Harry is swooping the Invisibility Cloak over his head and storming out. Distantly and ridiculously, somewhere under his anger, Harry is quite pleased with how smart he sounded just then. Hermione had heard about the bars on his windows from the twins and had been sending him tiny purses with undetectable extension charms on them filled with books. For somebody who had never owned anything until he was eleven, having libraries in his pockets was an amazing thing and Harry had utilised them greedily.</p><p>Harry spots Hermione and Ron going into a tavern and from there his world gets turned on its head.</p><p> </p><p>---</p><p>When Hermione takes his new firebolt Harry just hugs her and asks her to teach him the spell she uses on the purses she sends him. He’s starting to realise that without her he might get himself killed one of these days and he’s been informed that’s something he should be worried about. People have been throwing around terms like war and murder and death, but it’s never really meant much to Harry before now.</p><p>Harry doesn’t speak to Cedric again until after the holidays. He doesn’t like how they left things but they’re still almost strangers so there isn’t anything else to say to him. Except that Cedric is an almost stranger that does things like visiting Harry in the hospital and worrying about his safety. So when Cedric catches him alone just outside the great hall and pulls him aside, looking at him guiltily Harry cuts him off dismissively before he can get anything more out than “Harry listen, about Hogsmeade-‘</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s not your fault my life’s just-,</p><p>“Yeah, I’m starting to get that impression.”</p><p>Harry smiles shyly at him.</p><p>“That doesn’t mean you should throw it about like its nothing, though.” Harry is shocked at the vehemence of the statement and by the look on Cedric’s face so is he. “Sorry it’s just, life’s precious”.</p><p>“I just, don’t want to- I’m Just s-,”-uch a burden.</p><p>He doesn’t say it but maybe Cedric hears it anyway because then he is saying, “It’s okay to be scared sometimes, Harry. It’s okay if sometimes you need people to accommodate you because you’re scared. Despite how you may feel you’re not alone.”</p><p>After a heavy silence and a disbelieving stare from Harry Cedric continues “The dementors didn’t just get onto your cart. They made it to where my friends and I were hanging out and we were affected too. One of my best friends, Zoe, screamed so loud our ears were ringing for days afterwards. I nearly passed out. Your year wasn’t as badly affected because most of you aren’t old enough to have seen the kind of things that the dementors bring to the surface but in the older years almost nobody was completely unaffected.”</p><p>Harry swallows thickly. “Y-you, you nearly fainted?”</p><p>Cedric smiles sadly at him “I remember seeing my sisters.” Cedric says softly.</p><p>Harry is confused for a second because as far as he knows Cedric doesn’t have sisters. Then, with a jolt of realisation, Harry thinks maybe that’s the point.</p><p>“They were premature, which is common for twins, but their organs hadn’t developed properly and after a little while they just gave out.” Here Cedric’s eyes glaze over a little.</p><p>“In a way sort of peaceful.” Then Cedric’s face crumples, “they were so little, and my mum was so distraught.” There are tears in his eyes now and Harry clasps his hands gently.</p><p>Cedric sobers quickly after that. “I’ve forgotten what my point is now.”</p><p>There’s a beat before Cedric rushes, “oh well gotta run places to go people to see. See you around, Potter.” Harry is left staring bewilderedly at the place were Cedric was wondering what exactly had just transpired.</p><p>Harry tries not to dwell, but he seems incapable of not dwelling when it comes to Cedric.</p><p>So now they’re almost strangers that know each other’s secrets.  So considering Harry can’t seem to not dwell when Professor Lupin offers to teach him how to fight dementors and Harry thinks of Cedric’s secrets he decides to invite him along.</p><p>He catches him alone after Cedric has clearly had herbology. Harry is distracted by the flush of Cedric’s cheeks that he forgets what he has to say altogether and like a git reaches up and reverently wipes the dirt off Cedric’s nose.</p><p>Cedric is understandably a bit shocked too and they kind of just staring at each other for a while.</p><p>Cedric clears his throat. “Harry, are you feeling okay?”</p><p>Harry startles a bit jumps back. “Yeah; Sorry; I just have something I wanted to talk to you about.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Harry takes a few seconds to get his thoughts in order before saying “Professor Lupin, offered to help me learn how to defend myself, against the dementors.</p><p>I was just wondering if maybe you’d want to learn as well.”</p><p>At the mention of dementors, Cedric winces slightly. He is looking at Harry intensely now.</p><p>“You don’t have to, I’m sure if you wanted one of the other teachers would teach you, or professor Lupin would definitely show you alone, I just, I just thought, it might be-“</p><p>Cedric is, infuriatingly, laughing breathlessly now. ‘Harry. Harry that sounds, I’d love to. Thank you.”</p><p>Harry smiles softly and makes to scurry away.</p><p>“Harry, wait.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“I might need a little bit more information.”</p><p> </p><p>After the first Patronus lesson, both Harry and Cedric are shaking and elated. Both their Patronesses are non-corporeal but still strong. Cedric got it faster. When Cedric finally got it, he spun Harry around in elation and laughed joyously.</p><p>When Cedric told him, he thought of his family Harry is proud he didn’t flinch too badly. He manages to congratulate Cedric despite the inability to suppress the subconscious urge to run his hand over the bruise on his shoulder. In a moment of anger Petunia had hit Harry with a frying pan so hard his shoulder had ached for a week. The event had been so jarring Harry hadn’t been able to think of much else for the rest of the week.</p><p>Eventually, he realised maybe the family would work for him too. He thought of his family, but he didn’t think of the Dursleys. The silver mist that pours out of his wand feels like strength.</p><p> </p><p>Ron and Hermione are going at it like cats and dogs, or cats and rats Harry supposes. He tries desperately to stay out of, but he can’t help but lightly suggest to Ron that maybe that’s just what cats do, and it isn’t really Hermione’s fault. Ron is, of course, horrified at this shocking display of disloyalty and grumbles for days. With Hermione looking more exhausted and wan each day Harry doesn’t feel too remorseful.</p><p>It’s Hermione who brings him back his broom after McGonagall clears it for use and he spins her around in delight.</p><p> </p><p>Harry offers to let Cedric test his broom. Suspiciously the only day Cedric has time to test it out happens to be on the next scheduled Hogsmeade’s weekend. Harry is, of course, very irritated but also sort of endeared so he doesn’t comment beyond a few grumbles.</p><p>They spend an hour on the pitch together swapping brooms and laughing merrily before Cedric needs to go study. Turns out that he really is busy. Impulsively Harry suggests they study together. Harry doesn’t really intend to study perse, but he thinks lying in the sun with Cedric sounds better than moping in the Gryffindor common room alone.</p><p>They end up on a picnic rug by the black lake. Cedric transfigures a rug from his scarf, the colours make it look like a massive rectangular bumblebee. Cedric also cast an engorgement charm on it, which means there is more than enough space for them to really spread out. They end up right next to each other anyway.</p><p>When Harry finishes reading his book, 1984, he rolls over and peers over Cedric’s shoulder. He’s just finished doing some arithmancy homework and has started on his ancient runes. Harry turns his Arithmancy homework to him and finds that he recognises some patterns but most of them just look like a giant mess. He notices under the homework there is a textbook. Harry picks it up and starts reading it.</p><p>“Did you forget your textbook?”</p><p>“Hmm?” Harry says absently skimming through the notes.</p><p>“Your arithmancy book?”</p><p>“I don’t take Arithmancy,” Harry says rolling to face him.</p><p>“What do you take?’</p><p>Harry blushes, suddenly feeling inadequate in the presence of Cedric, studying for his Owls in Arithmancy, Ancient Runes and Muggle studies.</p><p>Then there was him. A slacker taking, “Divination and Care of magical creatures.”</p><p>Cedric smiles “Wicked, my dad is a magizooligist he begged me to take care of magical creatures, but animals terrify me.”</p><p>“Can’t be too disappointed with Cedric Diggory, boy wonder for a son,” Harry says grinning steadily.</p><p>Cedric lies on his back and puts his hands under his head. “You have no idea.” He says with a groan.</p><p>“So, tell me.” Harry prompts.</p><p>“I mean I can’t complain too much. He loves me a lot he just, expects a lot.” Harry thinks he’s done talking but then after a beat Cedric adds “Some people say their parents want them to be exactly like them, well mine want me to be better.”</p><p>“Is that why you’re taking so many information heavy electives? Would you have chosen them otherwise?”</p><p>“I think, for the most part, I’m happy with my decisions I try not to let him control me too much. I mean I can honestly say I love my electives but sometimes when I do badly in DADA or herbology I think I take it harder than I would have if my dad didn’t care so much.” Cedric is sitting up now staring intently at Harry.</p><p>“I think working hard, to do what you love, that’s amazing. That’s more than a lot of people can say. It’s more than I can say.” Harry admits softly. Fiddling idly with his book bag. “You should be proud.”</p><p>“Thanks, Harry.” Cedric murmurs quietly.</p><p>“Why aren’t you taking arithmancy?” Cedric asks after a while turning on his side completely to face Harry.</p><p>“I didn’t really know much about it. I mean, my relatives are muggles, and muggle math and science are completely different to Arithmancy. I mean not really, but I didn’t know that until just then when I stole your textbook, so I didn’t really have any point of reference of what it would be about.” Now that he’s saying these things out loud, he realises he doesn’t know why he isn’t doing arithmancy, why he immediately skipped over it as an option.</p><p>“Outside of Hogwarts I basically have no access to the wizarding community, so I had no way of knowing anything about any of the electives, so I mostly just chose what Ron did.”</p><p>Harry’s fiddling has increased now. He hates talking about Dursleys especially because he needs to pick his words exactly right.</p><p>Cedric puts his hands over Harry’s hands to still them. “You could change you know. If you want. Probably not this year but you could talk to your head of year I’m sure she would help you.”</p><p>Harry suddenly feels desperately hopeful. “Do you really think so?”</p><p> “I mean I would think so. Harry, you’re looking a little frantic.</p><p>Are you scared of animals too?” Cedric asks only semi-joking.</p><p>“Not Animals,” Harry says bracingly</p><p>Cedric still has his hands in Harry’s and he squeezes them softly. “Then what? What scares you, Harry.”</p><p>Harry thinks of Green lights and hooded figures. Of mass murderers, serial killers, red eyes and death. Thinks that when Trelawny tells him he’s going to die he thinks of fists, frying pans and falling, falling, falling, and believes her.</p><p>He doesn’t say any of these things. Just gently pulls his hands back and starts gathering his things.</p><p>It’s getting dark anyway.</p><p> </p><p>When Hermione quits divination, Harry asks her how she likes arithmancy and ancient runes.</p><p> Somehow, he ends up in McGonagall’s office with a lot of summer homework. He still needs to finish the year and take the exams but next year he’s free. It’s such a euphoric feeling, being able to change something he doesn’t like, that he kisses Hermione on the cheek and spins her around thrice.</p><p> </p><p>One lunch the twins approach him. They tell him that Hermione’s been worried. Tell him that pranking is important but not more important than his life. Tell him that they would be furious if Snape got his hands on the map but if Professor Lupin “somehow” got his hands on the map they wouldn’t be too disappointed.</p><p>Harry had been thinking about giving the map to Lupin for ages. He’s starting to really appreciate Hermione. He thinks if giving the map up is going to help protect Ron and stop Hermione and the twins from worrying, well, maybe that’s something he can do.</p><p>Ron reconciles with both him and Hermione when they receive a missive from Hagrid informing them of Buckbeak’s fate. They celebrate together when Hermione slaps the smirk right off Malfoy’s face and then Harry whips his arse in Quidditch. Nothing like Draco Malfoy to bring friends together. Then they stress together over exams. Well, Hermione does at least. Harry does a little, he thinks that if he does terribly on his exams maybe McGonagall might not let him take up new electives.</p><p>That thought process doesn’t really apply to divination so he kind of just wings it. After the incident at the end of it, Harry is thoroughly relieved this will be his last encounter with professor Trelawny.</p><p>Then Harry lives the day from hell twice. He was already so tired at the end of the first time but by the second time he’s dead on his feet. As Sirius flies away on Buckbeak its bittersweet. On the one hand, Sirius is alive which is more than Harry could have hoped for a few hours ago but on the other hand; as Sirius flies away, all Harry’s hopes for a home go with him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry doesn’t see Cedric before the end of the year. He imagines that owls take up a lot of Cedric’s time, so he doesn’t want to bother him. He does receive a letter from Sirius and Harry leaves Hogwarts with pockets filled with books and cautious optimism for the future.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
