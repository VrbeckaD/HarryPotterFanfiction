    <p>The nightmares came every night now. Harry wasn’t surprised about that, but the onslaught having only begun recently did go against his expectations. There had been a period of numbness immediately after Voldemort’s defeat, a floating through court proceedings and dogged <em>Prophet</em> attempts at interview, an endless parade of well-wishes from an endless parade of well-wishers; but these just served as mild punctuations during his long, long, long stretches of dreamless sleep. Hermione said this was completely normal – said this as she rubbed the dark circles under her eyes with the balls of her hands, Ron still clinging to her like a lifeline during his own disturbed sleep.</p><p>They had taken to sleeping in a cramped pillow fort on the floor of Ron’s room at the Burrow. Eighteen years old, the lot of them, but being on the run had meant they woke up drenched in sweat if they couldn’t immediately feel or find each other in the dark. It was temporary, they knew – the three of them were returning to Hogwarts after the summer – but the after-war transition meant they were still on edge, still gasping awake at any small sound the house made around them.</p><p>Weirdly, Harry’s nightmares weren’t anything that anyone might have predicted. He had seen blood, bodies, flashes of green light; these were as familiar to him as the sounds of his friends’ voices. Instead, he dreamt his flickering body stood – or floated? – in a void of bright white light, not unlike his between-life-and-death King’s Cross purgatory. There were no trains here though, and no-one to pose him any difficult moral questions. He was alone, and he wasn’t even sure he was there himself, what with his body wavering in and out of existence. Harry wasn’t sure why, but that nothingness terrified him more than any corporeal horror could have at that point.</p><p>He would sleep through it, was the worst part – hours of floating, doing nothing, no-one there. When he woke up to the sunlight streaming through the window, the same as always – as if no war had happened, as if no one had died – the reassurance of his friends still being there and alive could only marginally slow down the rapid beating of his heart.</p><p>Harry wasn’t sure if he would be able to handle this for long. Ron and Hermione had recently started seeing a mind-healer – Ron at Hermione’s urging – and they had both said that it had been helping to mitigating their – what had the mind-healer called it? Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder? But, and Harry laughed mirthlessly at this, his uncle’s frequently barked mantra of “Shut up and don’t ask questions!” had returned to embed itself deep into Harry’s heart. He was quieter nowadays. Molly had taken to feeding him more and more to fill the empty space where talking would be. Ginny had taken to turning away from him with a lost expression in her eyes.</p><p>They were all looking for something from him, a distant part of him realised, and they were doing it all unconsciously. He recognised it from other people too; they expected answers from him, as if he was their messiah. What do we do now? What is our new normal? Now the celebrations have ended and the dead are buried, how do we fill this aching void in our lives? Harry, what do we do about Fred, about Lupin, about Tonks, about Mad Eye, about Lavender, about Colin Creevey, about about about…</p><p>Ron and Hermione were the only people who asked nothing from him. They would often sit with him on the hill that overlooked the Burrow and be quiet with him. The first time they did this, Harry realised how desperately he loved them. They were his family, and he would be alright. They all would, eventually. Right now, he needed to think and be quiet and have these nightmares and spend time with his friends and eat Molly’s cooking and listen to Arthur’s updates about the outside world and play with Teddy until he was ready to speak again. He knew this with the same detached familiarity that told him that the reason people looked at him with that desperation in their eyes was because they felt the same as him; sometimes, the thought of continuing scared him too.</p><p>Ron and Hermione had each other. This was something else he realised, with the same dull ache in his heart that told him he didn’t have this with Ginny. She understood, of course she did, and she had her own healing to do. She had kissed him for the last time at the beginning of August as they wound their way round the fields of the Burrow.</p><p>Returning to Hogwarts had seemed impossible to him at one point, but more recently, as summer started to draw to a close, the prospect seemed more and more attractive; after all, Hogwarts was the first place he had ever been able to call home. McGonagall had assured the students that the castle would be ready to open its doors come September; it wanted so desperately to protect the people inside that it had repaired itself at a speed almost unimaginable. Magic, it seemed, wanted to heal. If, Harry thought, I was back in Hogwarts, maybe I could heal too.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>Draco Malfoy was escorted to Platform 9 ¾ with a guard of Aurors, a cavalcade of <em>Prophet</em> reporters, and his anxious mother in tow. It seemed that publicly switching sides during the climax of a brutal war – throwing your wand to the Saviour of the Wizarding World no less – altered public perception of you like nothing other. Draco Malfoy: Misunderstood and Manipulated due to his Draconian Father’s influence. Draco Malfoy: the Hidden Victim of Voldemort’s Reign of Terror. Draco Malfoy: Redeemed.</p><p>It made him sick.</p><p>How his father had taken the brunt of the family’s punishment and exile made him hate himself with an acuity that surpassed even his sixth year, when the Dark Mark had first been branded onto his semi-reluctant skin. Yes, he was a victim of his circumstances. Yes, he had been born and bred with prejudice drip-fed to him from the very first. But, it had always been him spewing those vile thoughts. It had always been him controlling and torturing those people. It had always been him who – just the thought made bile bubble up into his throat.</p><p>What was he even doing here? <em>The Prophet</em> was documenting his triumphant return to Hogwarts with a fervour only exacerbated by Harry Potter’s recent transformation into a recluse. No-one knew if Potter was going to return as an eighth year like the other twelve luminaries, three of whom already had their own pockets of paparazzi buzzing around them as they tried to board the Hogwarts Express. Granger was a given, Weasley a fifty-fifty. But Potter was where the story was. And until one of the three showed up, Draco had to staunchly ignore the reporters who scuttled alongside him, fawning, sycophantic.  It was only for his mother’s sake that he put on pleasantries. If it wasn’t for her requesting him to comply, in order for them to regain some semblance of respectability in magical society, he would not be here right now, parading around like a fraud. Though, honestly, if it wasn’t for her, he wouldn’t be here at all.</p><p>Draco shook his head with an aggression that sent the cameras flashing. Ignoring his mother’s startled look, he made his way to the rear carriage of the train, a sea of faces parting for him. Some people looked at him in awe, some in hatred. Good. He was glad there were still those who despised him. He did not want to be let off the hook that easily. His life had been an endless series of stupid mistakes and he was sharply aware of his need to be punished for each and every one of them.</p><p>Far from the exercise in healing, reconciliation and new beginnings that the eighth year cohort was supposed to represent, Draco felt that his return to Hogwarts would be a year-long punishment for his misdeeds. He fully intended to complete this year, graduate a hermit, and, after an appropriate time had passed and his mother was once again fully integrated into wizarding society, fade into obscurity. Then, he would disappear altogether.</p><p>He had formulated this plan during his fortnight-long bed rest after attempting to burn down Malfoy Manor. <em>The Prophet</em> had reported this as a rogue Death Eater trying to get revenge. Well, for once they were right. Draco had lay in the spare bedroom, staring up at the canopy of the four-poster, his hands still stained with ash. Those curtains, at least, were not the opulent green velvet and silver brocade of his youth; instead, they were a generic burgundy, faded with age enough to boast, subtly, to any guests staying of the family’s wealth and antiquity.</p><p>His mother had forced him into bed rest and plied him with calming potions and draughts that settled his mind enough to calm down, though he was not able to sleep properly. When she realised this, she placed a poultice on his head and draped chamomile and lavender around his bed frame; a magic even older than his family name. Draco still couldn’t sleep, but he drifted into a state of comfortable numbness, enough to allow him to ghost through his days, drinking little and eating almost nothing.</p><p>He would do this for his mother. His father was no longer an option, and Draco had enough filial piety in his heart to make sure his mother would suffer no more than she already had. When she had stood up in court, had proudly said, head held high, how she had defied the Dark Lord, how she had cast his wishes aside completely to make sure her son was safe, love and devotion flared deep in Draco’s chest. The intensity of which was comparable only to that of Lucius’s screams of “<em>traitor</em>!” from where he was manacled in the docks.</p><p>Lucius, steadfast in his faith to Voldemort, had taken his turn in the stand to state, coldly, staring across the crowds and straight into the eyes of his only child, that he would rather Draco have died loyal than live on as a coward, a defector, an embarrassment to the family name. The eruption from the crowds solidified Draco and Narcissa’s changed reputations as unwilling participants to the Dark Lord’s cause; people to be pitied instead of reviled. And Lucius? The villain. On par almost with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named himself. Throw him into Azkaban, Kiss him and let him rot and fester.</p><p>Draco wasn’t sure why exactly, but the almost universal pardoning of himself made him disgusted. The pity burned his stomach with acrid acidity. He needed – he craved – the hatred from others. He saw it slightly in some of the faces peppered in the crowds now, and he felt a sensation inside, almost of contentment, when he saw them. These would have to be his pinpoints of light this year, he decided, until they grew bored of him again.</p><p>He kissed his mother goodbye and entered the rear carriage of the Express. As it shut behind him, a sudden quietness washed over him, making him release a breath he hadn’t been aware he was holding. He steeled himself to open the door to the assigned eighth year compartment – assigned in the hopes of sprouting inter-house unity before they even entered the castle grounds. With any luck, he would be the first one there.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn’t have any such luck. In fact he was almost the last one there; Longbottom, Thomas and Finnigan sat with the Patil twins, Abbott, Finch-Fletchley and Bones. It seemed that, along with the Patil girl, only one other Ravenclaw had returned, as Goldstein milled amongst them. Belatedly, he realised that the eighth years still on the platform were all Slytherins, probably doing exactly what he was doing in trying to present a brave face to the papers. And of course, the Golden Trio were there, sequestered in the corner as usual, part of the group but also not-quite.</p><p>A horrible feeling lurched from Draco’s stomach into his throat – he was going to throw up. He wavered in the doorway as the entire compartment stopped what they were doing and looked at him. He gripped the doorway infinitesimally more tightly, hovering between entering and running away completely, his vision tunnelling. This had happened only once before, just after he had set his bed curtains on fire and panicked, his heart thudding in his chest with such rapidity he felt he was going to die.</p><p>They must have realised, because suddenly Longbottom was on his feet and manoeuvring him from the doorway and into the empty corridor, closing the door behind him.</p><p>“Just breathe,” he was saying, but Draco thought this voice was coming from somewhere far away. “Breathe in for five, breathe out for seven…”</p><p>Eventually, Draco’s mind took over and he started following Longbottom’s instructions, counting with him as he controlled his breathing, allowing it to fill up his chest slowly, letting his eyes fall shut as he listened to Longbottom’s calm voice.</p><p>It felt like hours afterwards when Draco finally felt the strength give out in his legs and he sank slowly, sliding down the wall until he crouched onto the ground.</p><p>“What just happened?” he croaked blearily, suddenly acutely embarrassed that there were tears pricking at his eyes.</p><p>“Has that ever happened before?” Longbottom asked.</p><p>“Once.”</p><p>Longbottom thumped down on the ground next to him and sighed.</p><p>“I think you’ve just had a panic attack.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It’s when your body goes into overdrive and you start feeling all this fear. Your mind gets overwhelmed when you’re in stressful situations and it starts overacting. It’s a normal response… when you’ve been through tough stuff.”</p><p>After some long moments, Draco asked, “Do you get them too?”</p><p>“Not so much,” he replied vaguely. “But I know plenty who do. I’ve gotten used to dealing with them.”</p><p>Draco didn’t say anything. With his adrenaline rush receding, he felt horribly humiliated and needed to get out of there as quickly as possible. What the hell had he been thinking, believing he could handle this? What the hell was he trying to prove?</p><p>Longbottom must have picked up on this because, concerned, he started to ask, “Malfoy, are you-"</p><p>“Draco? What the hell happened?!” Daphne Greengrass appeared in his peripheral vision and dropped down next to him, grabbing him by his shoulder.</p><p>Groaning, Draco batted her away. “I’m alright, Daph, don’t worry, I-"</p><p>“What did you <em>do</em> to him?” she growled, glaring at Longbottom.</p><p>“No, Daphne, no it wasn’t him. Just drop it, okay?” Draco began to rise to his feet. Seeing her sceptical look, he added. “I mean it. Please.”</p><p>It came out almost like a sigh. It almost shocked him how exhausted he sounded. Blinking in surprise, Daphne quickly recovered and hooked her arm in his, drawing him protectively close. “Of course. Are you going in? We’ll go in together.”</p><p>“Give me a second, yeah? I need to just… sort myself out.”</p><p>Draco glanced at Longbottom, who nodded at him and, patting him once on his shoulder, went back into the compartment.</p><p>“Do you want to wait for the others before going in?” Daphne asked. Draco nodded once, and then started to clean himself up, rubbing the tears from his eyes as Daphne pointedly started to busy herself with her bag.</p><p>Honestly, now that the panic had subsided, Draco was able to examine it with a clarity that he had been developing over the past few months. Thinking about it, he had probably had this, or something like it, happen before in sixth year, when he would lock himself in the girls’ bathroom with only a ghost to soothe his sobbing. Before, however, he had been able to hide it away, keep his feelings far far away from anyone else to scrutinise and inspect. But now, everyone had seen.</p><p>There was something so shameful in having lost it in front of everyone. He felt weak, exposed and vulnerable, and the thought of that terrified him. And then, a thought came to him in full force: Potter had seen. It almost winded him in its severity. He did not know why, out of all the people who could have seen him, <em>Potter</em> knowing so desperately horrified him, but he felt smaller than he ever had in his life. Smaller than when Potter had rejected him way back in first year. He felt tiny and so unlike himself. But then, when had he last felt like himself?</p><p>After a while he dimly registered that Zabini and Goyle had arrived. Daphne had spoken to them in hushed tones as Draco pressed his forehead against the cool, darkened train window, collecting himself. </p><p>“You alright, mate?” Zabini asked once Draco turned to face him.</p><p>He was about to respond when he realised he didn’t actually know how to speak to them anymore. There was a space between him and the three other Slytherins. They stood only a few steps away from each other but it stretched out like a yawning chasm between them, the space between full of suspicion as they sized each other up. They were eyeing him wearily, like cornered animals; though he registered he was probably doing the same. He couldn’t remember the last time he had seen any of them.</p><p>Zabini’s family had avoided the brunt of the furore after the war because of their ambivalence during the height of Voldemort’s power. In fact, both his parents had absconded to their second home in Italy for the duration of Zabini’s seventh year; Zabini only attended Hogwarts due to his relative safety as a pure blood. They had never aligned themselves with either the Ministry or the Dark Lord, believing themselves above it all.</p><p>Goyle, on the other hand, had benefited from the patronisingly forgiving reaction to Draco’s situation. He, too, was painted as a casualty of parental circumstance, though with the added edge of a generally accepted lack of intelligence on his part. Goyle knew this, not being as stupid as everyone believed, but Crabbe’s death had sobered him. He had lost his fight and his pride, and he accepted his position just as easily as he used to follow Draco’s footsteps before. Draco was a poor, sorry victim, and now so was he. His presence here reminded Draco of just how much he needed to suffer. Crabbe was gone, and now Goyle was here, a grey shadow cast over him, and he had to take responsibility for both.</p><p>Draco remembered his mother, remembered her standing tall in the stands and saying proudly, the Slytherin flowing out of her, that loyalty was always her first object; she would do anything if it meant keeping her family safe. Seeing his three – friends? Housemates? – in front of him, he stood taller. Wordlessly, he nodded, and a shared moment between them all made them all visibly relax, their shoulders untensed. Whatever the others had been waiting for from Draco they managed to find, and Zabini was the first one to move forward with an outstretched hand. Goyle hesitated, barely, but enough for Draco to register and feel a cool stab in his gut.</p><p>Though it had felt like an age out in the corridor, in actuality it was more like twenty-five minutes. Long enough for the shame of making a scene to have grown and implanted itself firmly in Draco’s mind, but also long enough for his long-practiced ability of putting on his mask to kick back in. There was an art to artifice that all pure blood families of their status were well versed in. He was aware of it as Daphne straightened her shoulders, as Goyle puffed his chest out. Zabini affected an air of arrogance, and Draco himself settled into boredom.</p><p>Beyond the compartment door was a room of unknown; whether those inside would be enemies or allies was the question that bound the four of them together in their own alliance. It was both strong and tenuous at the same time – against the rest of Hogwarts the four would stand solid, but between them Draco knew there were cracks. The larger part of him felt the appropriateness of having those damaged foundations. A year, he thought. Just a year, and then I’ll be gone.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>When the door opened again Harry was only slightly surprised that the four Slytherin eight years were there together, though in retrospect he shouldn’t have been. The rest of the eight years had arrived two hours earlier than the scheduled Express departure time in order to avoid the inevitable crowds. In that time, they had spread themselves out across the magically enchanted compartment in an excellent imitation of a House common room.</p><p>“Do you believe all this stuff about Malfoy and Goyle and the other Slytherins?” Seamus said after a while. He and Ron had already waylaid the cart witch and were now pouring over chocolate frogs, delighting when Ron found a trading card of himself.</p><p>“What stuff?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“That they’re victims, changed, that kind of thing.”</p><p>The other eighth years quietened what they were doing at this point and looked towards Harry. He realised that they were waiting for his verdict: at his say so the Slytherins could be accepted with open arms or cast aside forever. The pressure of this decision had already started to weigh on him when Hermione momentarily rested her hand on his.</p><p>“Everyone did things they weren’t proud of,” she said shortly.</p><p>Ron made a huff as he got up from the floor and stretched, before moving to plonk himself on Harry’s other side.</p><p>“Way I see it,” he started. “The war is over. I’m tired of fighting. And I’m sure even Malfoy is too.”</p><p>There was a finality to Ron’s tone that settled things for the rest of the students. If even Ron could forgive them, then what had the rest to worry for? Some of them already had reached the same conclusions as Ron and Hermione– Neville, Hannah, even Susan, who could have been easily justified for any cynicism – but the few others who still remained sceptical seemed able to let go following their lead. Besides, after a war, holding grudges just felt so pointless and petty. Like others, the thought of fighting left them exhausted. It was far easier right now to let go.</p><p>This had been brought into sharp relief when they saw Draco Malfoy himself crumble so quickly and perceptibly in front of them. How were they supposed to hate anyone who looked so utterly defeated? Neville had been the first to move to help, but when he shut the door behind them, a silent agreement passed through the rest of the eighth years – no one was to bring this up again, not if Malfoy didn’t first. To crow victory over him after seeing that would feel hollow and exploitative; the papers positioned them as beacons of the winning side, championing morality and love and magnanimity. Even if that came easier to some than others, and even if that left a tasteless, superficial flavour in their mouths, no one could shake off the responsibility they felt at having to be forgiving.</p><p>Thank god for Justin’s pompousness, because when he stood up, brushed his hands on his trousers and extended his arm to shake hands with Malfoy when the Slytherins entered, it was just farcical enough to completely break the tension in the room. They all broke into cackling laughter at him as he looked round wildly in confusion, and Ron threw a Pumpkin Pastry at Malfoy by way of welcome that he caught with a seeker’s muscle memory. The Slytherins were startled into laughing also and, surprised at the almost-friendly reception, somewhat awkwardly sat down in a corner of the compartment, themselves part of the group but also not-quite.</p><p>Throughout all of this, Harry realised, Malfoy didn’t look at him once. He affected nonchalance but his eyes darted round like a frightened animal, his shoulders tense as if he expected attack at any moment. Harry knew that feeling well and searched for Malfoy’s eyes across his friends’ more than once during the duration of the train journey. Whether purposefully or not, Malfoy avoided his gaze. A funny feeling settled in the pit of Harry’s stomach. It was a distant feeling, reminiscent of something from the past, a need for something, some kind of recognition. Or perhaps it was something missing; the sharp jibes that characterised the seven years of their knowing was absent and Harry felt it keenly.</p><p>Malfoy looked like how Harry felt. A grey cast had settled over him and his sharp features had grown even sharper over the course of the summer. He looked, and moved, almost like a ghost. Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if, just like his dream-self, Malfoy began to flicker in and out of existence. Maybe it was an echo triggered by this thought, but Harry felt a spike of sudden panic and felt the need to grab onto Malfoy, shake him and drag him back into reality. And then just as sudden Harry realised what he was thinking and, embarrassed of his staring, shook himself, grabbed a chocolate frog from Ron’s hoard, and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>
