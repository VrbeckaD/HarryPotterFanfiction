          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry had been dating his boyfriend for awhile now, and the two of them were really happy. They didn't always get along though. For years he and Draco were at odds with each other. After the war they became friends and soon after that they realized they liked each other even more than friends. </p><p>Anyway. All of that was over. Right now the two of them were just cuddling. </p><p>"...hey," said Harry. He'd just thought of something right this very second. </p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"What boys did you like while we were at Hogwarts?"</p><p>Draco flushed slightly, a little pink on his very nice cheekbones. Harry thought it was cute. "You mean besides you."</p><p>Harry flushed then too. "Obviously."</p><p>"Hm..." he tapped his chin in thought. "Viktor Krum was hot."</p><p>"Really?" Harry smirked suddenly. "You know what? You have more in common with Ron than you might think."</p><p>"...wait what."</p></div>
