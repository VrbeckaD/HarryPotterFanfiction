    <p>Perhaps magic's worst drawback is pride. When a person is given constant access to such power, they can start to feel invincible, like nothing will ever hurt them as long as they have their wand. At least, that's how Fenley Thistlebrook felt when he apparated to England's Ministry border point after a holiday in Australia when he informed the official that no, he had brought no unregistered foods, plants, animals, herbs, spirits (alcoholic or malevolent), potions, or mysterious objects back with him. Which was of course, entirely false- but what harm could one billywig in a jar possibly cause? His brother was a magizoologist and had loads of the little creatures, just pop it in a cage and it'll be fine. Besides, he was feeling a tad bit peaky and wanted to sleep in his own bed after three long weeks, not wait in an uncomfortable chair while his bloody billywig was examined for threats to the country. He blew his nose into a handkerchief and straightened his travelling cloak as the official allowed him to pass and used an Apparating Station to head for home. He arrived, kissed his wife on the cheek, and gave the billywig to his young son to look after, warning him to avoid the stinger before slipping into a fretful sleep.</p><p>Fenley, Marjorie, and Winston Thistlebrook were the first recorded cases of Gillypox in England since the 1930's. Fenley Thistlebrook's coworkers, Marjorie's potionry group members, and Winston's schoolfriends (notably especially those who visited the billywig) were soon to follow, as was much of the magical population of West Sussex. In two months, Northern Ireland was the only pox-free place in Britain. Travel and trade were cut off almost completely between Britain and the rest of the magical world to slow the pox's spread in Europe and the Americas. Preliminary quidditch matches were postponed indefinitely. Parents began teaching their children too young for Hogwarts how to cast <em>scourgify</em> using their wands, and many smaller businesses on Diagon Alley closed their doors temporarily. As for Hogwarts, its isolated location offered it an advantage over the rest of Scotland and it remained stubbornly open through the meteoric rise of the pox. Parents, although worried for their children, acknowledged that Hogwarts was most likely the safest place for them to be in a crisis like this. However, extra precautions were still taken: no packages in and out, only letters; no Hogsmeade trips; and of course, the Plague Charm.</p><p>Only those extensively familiar with <em>Hogwarts: a History</em> will be familiar with the Plague Charm. It is, in fact, actually a collection of spells placed on the castle itself following the time of the Bubonic Plague in the fourteenth century. When prepared, the charm can be activated by any professor and initiates a sort of "lockdown" procedure, where doors lock so that all inhabitants of the castle are in the smallest place possible in which they can still reach a bathroom (an important amendment added after the Dragonpox outbreak of 1634). The house elves continue to prepare food as usual and it is spelled directly to the students and faculty rather than the great hall. Only professors are permitted by the castle to move freely. In October, two months after Fenley Thistlebrook returned from Australia, Headmaster Dumbledore prepared the Plague Charm.</p>
