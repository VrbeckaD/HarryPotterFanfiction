    <p>“Get out of my way, <em> Potter.” </em>Draco snarled under his breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck you, <em> Malfoy.” </em>Potter whispered back.</p><p> </p><p>“Only in your dreams, <em> Potter.” </em>Draco grit his teeth, and elbowed Potter hard.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you mean nightmares, <em> Malfoy.” </em>Potter wheezed and stomped viciously on Draco’s foot.</p><p> </p><p><em> "Ow! </em> <b>You stupid bitch — these are custom made—”</b></p><p> </p><p>“Keep your voice down!” Potter hissed.</p><p> </p><p>“You stupid bitch—” Draco whispered back, furious.</p><p> </p><p>Behind them, someone cleared their throat.</p><p> </p><p>Draco dearly hoped that is wasn’t Shacklebolt. And of course — because Draco had hoped for something with all his heart — it turned out to be Shacklebolt.</p><p> </p><p>Draco bit back a swear. </p><p> </p><p>“Is there a reason you’ve both been hogging the coffee machine?”</p><p> </p><p>Potter, the fucking toad, turned to Shacklebolt, “Malfoy cut in line.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco gave Potter a look of pure disdain. “I did nothing so crass. I got here first.”</p><p> </p><p>“You did not, you dirty liar!”</p><p> </p><p>Draco turned to look at Shacklebolt — <em>look at what I’ve had to deal with every-single-fucking-day since you partnered us. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Look at me and feel guilt, you worm. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Shacklebolt pinched the bridge of his nose. “Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Minister?”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you cut in line?”</p><p> </p><p>“I most certainly did not.”</p><p> </p><p>Shacklebolt sighed. “Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you overreacting?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wha— No! <em> I’m </em>the one who got here first—”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care — both of you get out of my way.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter shot Draco a dirty look — as if this whole ordeal was <em> Draco’s </em>fault. Draco didn’t know how he’d managed to get through this past year without strangling Potter’s sanctimonious neck.</p><p> </p><p><em>‘Ooooh look at me, I’m the Boy Who Couldn’t Fucking Stay Dead and I don’t know how to use my eyes and Ooooh look! There’s that death-eater scum, Malfoy! And he’s in front of me! Oh shucks, he </em>must <em>have cut in line! There’s absolutely </em>no<em> way</em> <em>that’s he’s been there from the beginning! Oooooh let me shove him out of the way like the heathen that I am!’</em></p><p> </p><p>Draco made eye contact with Astoria — one of the only good things in this godforsaken place. She smiled at him and rolled her eyes: <em> Potter’s a Moron. </em></p><p> </p><p>Draco smiled back: <em> Exactly, my dear. </em></p><p> </p><p>And of course — because Draco was smiling innocently, and that <em> must </em> mean he’s <em> up to something — </em>Potter whirled back towards Draco. “Why’re you smiling?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m planning on murdering some puppies when I get home.”</p><p> </p><p>“Listen here, <em> Malfoy—” </em></p><p> </p><p>And that’s when the coffee machine exploded — all over Shacklebolt’s newly bought dress-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Draco eyed the broken contraption —<em> about time, as well.</em> With the amount of raw magic circling around the Ministry, the Muggle device was bound to malfunction. Perhaps exploding was a rather exorbitant malfunction — but what did they expect, really. Muggle devices have never properly functioned amongst magic. </p><p> </p><p>(Something to do with how magic disrupts the electric field and prevents any delocalised excitation from occurring — thus preventing the flow of electrons — or what the Muggles like to call: <em> elecktricity.) </em></p><p> </p><p>(Or so Granger liked to drone.)</p><p> </p><p>“Did you do that?” Potter demanded.</p><p> </p><p>Draco sneered at him, “yes. And I invented cancer as well.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Malfoy.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Keep your panties on, you twit. It wasn’t me,” Draco rolled his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>And of course, that was the moment that Shacklebolt lost his fucking marbles.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Harry! Malfoy!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco exchanged a look with Astoria.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “This is your fault!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco couldn’t believe this. “Um, no, actually, it isn’t—”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Shut up, you ninny!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> Well, then. </em> Draco rubbed his forehead and looked at Potter. <em> Do something, you useless bugger. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Kingsley, it wasn’t—”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Shut up.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Potter — the most pathetic Gryffindor of them all — did, indeed, shut up. </p><p> </p><p>And that’s how Draco and Potter ended up in a Muggle coffee shop, buying coffee for their entire bloody department.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re fucking useless, Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not even to save my life.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck off!”</p>
