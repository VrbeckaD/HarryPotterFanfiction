    <p>Getting drunk is not as fun as Harry thought it would be.</p><p>But then again, a lot of the <em>adult</em> things he thought would be fun...just aren't.</p><p>Maybe it's because he's been through literal hell, but most days he prefers teaching the first to fourth years defense classes. Until McGonagall can find another teacher, she swears, but he's not so sure she's trying that hard. He keeps finding books and an assortment of teaching materials, and a paper that he's pretty sure had been a test for Newts Defense.</p><p>At least his repertoire of more arcane magic grows by the day. He's not sure if it's <em>normal</em> to have the ability to cast spells that most Wixen have trouble with until their late twenties, but when has he ever been normal?</p><p>The alcohol probably won't disappear by itself. Harry might have a vault full of galleons (that is slowly increasing thanks to his minimal pay of ten knuts a day, that he had firmly talked down from five sickles a day) but to this day he still drinks and eats every last bite if he pays for something. But the Mer-Ale-in really isn't hitting the spot.</p><p>"I wish I had someone to drink this with." Harry mutters a little more petulantly than he has been for years. He's sure if Ron or Hermione weren't miles away they would be giving him hell over his word choice.</p><p>They would also give an exasperated sigh at the sight of Harry starting to glow in pink, purple, and copper tones. "Founders fuckery." Harry glares at his hands, "This better not be a side effect of the ale." This brand is <em>supposed</em> to be tame compared to most magical drinks; it's why he had gotten it over Firewhiskey or Parrot's Cowl, which were generally the more favored drinks for parties.</p><p>Except, there's a sudden vertigo swing, and even Harry with his limited drinking experience can tell <em>that</em> is not normal. Moments later, Harry tilts sideways off his stool, and falls. It's a long, dizzying, fall and somehow his drink stays perfectly full in his hand.</p><p>Landing is more like standing back up, and Harry has to take a few long blinks before he eyes his drink. "Never trusting Dumbledore to recommend a drink again." He scowls at the Mer-Ale-in.</p><p>Because right in front of Harry. Where the old staff meeting room should be, and where Harry had been hidden from everyone in the school, were a load more people. Including, Dumbledore himself.</p><p>This really was just Harry's luck.</p>
