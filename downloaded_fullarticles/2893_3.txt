    <p>“Merlin’s beard! Harry growled out as he came to a crash on the green and brown grassy ground. Pain raced through his legs and lower body as he slowly started to recover. </p><p>                                “Where am I?” Harry declared aloud. The volume of his question was minimized by the whispering wind that traveled through the area. There was a forest to his rightside with huge dark green trees. On his leftside the boy who lived noticed a ruddy paved road that looked like it had definitely seen better days.  North of the area the young wizard noticed that there looked to be a large city in the distance, but it did not look like Hogwarts or any place that he was familiar with. </p><p>                “The spell must have misfired.” Harry thought. It had been late at night at Hogwarts and he had been practicing an old transfiguration spell that he had read about in the library. Even Hermione had thought it was too advanced for her but Harry had been mesmerized by it because it mentioned travel to parallel worlds. The thing was he had just been trying to get to the point where he could open a small window into a world. Hermione didn’t believe that they existed but the idea of catching a glimpse of himself and his family in another realm held great appeal for Harry. He had planned to only open a small window but almost as soon as he had started to spin his wand, the portal had grown larger and then suddenly it had been as if a great invisible hand had pulled him forward. Harry only had enough time to tighten his grip on his wand before he was summarily yanked into the bright spinning portal. </p><p>                After that it had felt like he was torn apart into a hundred pieces and then quickly put back together right as he had been. The first thing he remembered right before hitting the ground was hearing a loud swirling noise and feeling intense warmth on his body right before he had begun to freefall and eventually land on the grass beneath him. </p><p>                Now finally recovering he was glad that his wand had made the trip with him. As he stood up and moved his eyes away from the city in the distance, his eyes saw something else much closer. A woman appeared to be fighting off a group of men in armor and leather clothing. Fire blazed from her fingertips in a dazzling display Harry had never seen before. Unfortunately, after she managed to disrupt the attack of one of her opponents, a bowman a bit removed from the brutal melee scored a hit with his bow. The arrow struck the lovely woman with short redhair in the shoulder. Harry could just catch the look of anger on her face but the minor hit was so much more damaging as the seconds ticked on. The look of anger caused the magic user her concentration and it opened the door for a sword strike to across her stomach and another arrow to hit her leg. </p><p>                Harry heard a cry cut through the area as he rushed onto the scene and readied his wand. Still barely minutes from having arrived at this strange world the young man with jet black hair and a lightning bold scar raised his wand to the men closing in on the defeated woman.</p><p>                “Expelliarmus!” Magic charged forth from his wand in a brilliant zap of white light. The target with his big black hat and scarred face never saw it coming until his deadly sword was plucked seemingly from his hand as he was about to connect with the sorceress’ body once again.</p><p>                “Whah?” He muttered as he and the rest of his cadre turned the newcomer.</p><p>“Ow’d he do that?” Another with a bow uttered dumbly before Harry caught the sword in his left hand. </p><p>                “Who cares! He’s a witch like the rest of em. Get him and we’ll finish them both off.” A big harry brute with an axe declared. The bowman nodded and strung an arrow quick as a man could blink. The arrow was flying towards Harry faster than plenty of spells he’d seen. Thankfully he remembered his training. </p><p>                “Protego!” Harry quickly shouted while waving his hand in a circular motion. The shield charm rippled to life mere seconds before the arrow would have hit his chest. Instead the arrow smashed against his shield and fractured into a dozen pieces. The group of Witch Hunters stood on looking dumbfounded.</p><p>                “He’s no Witch. He’s a Witcher.” The man with the axe declared. Harry noticed his fingers tightening around the long axe being held in both hands. </p><p>                “I don’t want no beef with a Witcher.” The bald archer said. </p><p>                “Aint Witchers posed to have shiny medallions, like a wolf or something?” The man who Harry had disarmed grunted out towards his fellows.</p><p>“I don’t want no problem with Witchers. I say we leave.” The archer said as he scratched his head. The man was looking decidedly more worried given his primary way to kill Harry had been so utterly negated. </p><p>                “He took my sword!” The unarmed man growled out. “And we’re supposed to kill her and bring her back to Novigrad to collect the reward.”</p><p>                “We could lose more fighting him. Let’s get out of here. We’ll kill her another day.” The archer declared, his eyes never leaving Harry. It appeared like he was worried that in addition to being able to cast a spell to protect himself, he might send a bolt of fire straight at the Archer’s face. After a bit more muttering the witch hunters eventually decided the two were not worth their time and they quickly departed.</p><p>                Harry moved over to the injured mage. “Are you alright?” He asked the redheaded mage.</p><p>                “I’ll be fine. Thanks for your help. I’m surprised. Your power is like nothing I’ve ever seen.” The lovely woman said, her orange eyes scanning the mysterious stranger. </p><p>                “I’m not completely sure. But I think that I’ve actually come from another world. None of this looks like anything I’ve known. I’m Harry, Harry Potter.”</p><p>                “Well that is quite strange but not unheard of. I’m Triss… Triss Meregold. Excuse me just a moment. Urrhhh…” Triss said before she began using her powers to heal her wounds.           Before Harry’s eyes Triss’s fingers glowed with blue energy and she began to mend her wounds. Harry was surprised by how easy her healing magic knitted her flesh, but he also enjoyed the fact that for the first time in a long time, a magic user hadn’t known who he was just based on his name or his scar. </p><p>                “Did you happen to bring any books from your world. I love books and the books may help me create a portal to take you back to your world.”</p><p>                “Sorry, I really only have my wand and my clothes, which are now ruined.”</p><p>                “I can’t believe you wear such simple robes like these. They give you so little cover and I don’t sense any charms or protective amulets set into your outfit.” Triss said, her lithe pale fingers running over Harry’s clothing and occasionally dipping beneath the fabric and rubbing against his skin.</p><p>                “Well I was getting ready for sleep.”</p><p>                “We can worry about getting you back later. For now we need to find somewhere to lie low.”</p><p>                In a few minutes they found an abandoned cabin. There were a few dead wolves and something that looked humanoid but was definitely no human on the ground.</p><p>                “Looks like some bandits or someone powerful came through here. Only the bravest will come through here for a while.” Tris said confidently. The pair went into the house and then both Triss and Harry put down a set of magical trap spells. Both of their spells glowed brightly for a time before disappearing as if nothing had been done to the doors and the windows. The house had very little way in the way of furnishing. There was still a semblance of a kitchen and a living room and a bedroom. After observing the state of the place Harry was actually very surprised that there was still a bed.</p><p>                He turned back towards Triss and was suprirsed to find her a bit close to his fface as she looked at him. She definitely seemed very curious by his presence and appeared invested in getting to know more about him. </p><p>                “That damage outside was pretty large. Was it a dark wizard? We have those back home.” Harry admitted while noticing the impressive amount of cleavage that Triss’s tan leather top and aqua blue collar and shoulder piece displayed. She appeared to have no shame about it and it actually made Harry slightly stiff in his sleeping robes. </p><p>                “Who knows these days. Whole region is at war with Nilfgaard and Redania. Still could have just been a witcher. They have been some running around these parts of late.” Triss said while she removed some of her larges pouches and packs from her outfit as she took a step closer towards Harry.</p><p>                “What’s a witcher?” Harry asked, his nose picking up on the incredible scent of her flesh and the lovely redhead’s perfurme. Harry figured she was more than a bit older than he was but her beauty and small smiels were quite alluring as she stood close to him.</p><p>                “I’ll explain later. For now, I should repay you for helping me out Harry. Those Witch Hunters would have killed me without your help. I don’t like having unpaid debts.” Triss said before she moved forwar. The redheaded woman rest her right hand on Harry’s chest and then leaned in and kissed her pretty pink lips against his own. The young wizard with black short hair was surprised by her kiss. He had kissed girls before, and done more but he was a bit taken aback by the kiss right now. Triss was still quite a stranger, but in some way he felt something incredible, and something magical as they stood their kissing each other. There was attraction but something deeper stirred for both of them.</p><p>                Harry took the initiative and cradled the back of Triss’ head with his right hand as he turned her around so that her cute ass faced the bed. As they stood and continued embracing each other, Harry pushed his tongue into Triss’ warm welcoming mouth before he pushed her body back. Triss moaned against his lips and then when she pulled back for a moment she smiled at him before letting out a little gasp when she felt Harry’s stiffening cock teasing the front of her pants. </p><p>                Warmth traveled along from Harry’s core out to his cock. As his length stiffened he moved another step forward and then pushed Triss back onto the bed. She laughed at his boldness and then gave out a look of annoyance when she noticed how dirty the bed was. “We should take care of this before we go further.” The bright eyed sorceres declared before she waved her hand over the bed and spoke an incantation. Right before Harry’s eyes he watched as the bed transformed wheever Triss’s dainty soft fingers traveled. In no time at all the bed had been remade from a piece of trash into a fine silk sheeted duck feathered bed. Harry had never seen magic of that nature but what Triss did next completely caught him off guard.</p><p>                “Come here Harry.” Triss said before the redheaded vixen brought her hand towards her collar and started moving her hand down the midline of her body. Harry’s green eyes blinked slowly as bright white light started to materialize on the fabric of Triss’ outfit. It was almost as if she was pulling down a gleaming zipper of magical energy. As the light pulled out to the left and the right Triss’ naked flesh was revealed. It only took a few seconds for her hand to finish the motion and completely reveal her naked body towards Harry.</p><p>                “You’re overdressed Harry.” Triss declared as she shifted her left leg to perch on top of her right leg, covering up her pussy from Harry’s eyes. The young wizard smirked and then quickly pulled up his shirt and hopped out of his pants. His underwear came off last and then he quickly moved forward towards the bed. When he got close he moved over Triss’ incredible body. Her flesh was like smooth pink porcelain. Large breasts rested on her body and looked divinely set. Each orb of soft flesh was capped by a pink nipple and areola, the sight of which made Harry’s hard cock twitch as blood surged through every inch of his sex. </p><p>                He used his right hand to push down Triss’ left shoulder. After her body fell back onto the silk sheets covering the remade bed he let his body fall more onto her lovely form while his left hand grabbed a nice handful of her large breast while he put his mouth on her other tit.</p><p>                “Ohwaahh… Harry. I always love it when someone plays with my nipples. But don’t tease me too long. I get irritated when men play with me too much.” Trriss admitted before she let out another lewd gasp. Harry smiled with his lips still anchored tightly around her nipple. As he continued sucking and massaging her flesh both of her nipples became hard as iron and Harry’s cock continued to twitch eagerly. He moved his right hand back down and then opened up Triss’ legs. There was no resistance from the beautiful sorceress and Harry could almost feel the heat rising off of her pussy when the tip of his cock got closer and closer towards her opening. </p><p>                Slowly, his lips released their grip on the tasty flesh of Triss’ nipple. Her flesh tasted like the ripest fruit but something else was drawing his attention more and more. After Triss let out another mewling sigh as the tip of his warm cock rubbed against her clit Harry paused and ran his hand along her neck.</p><p>                “Triss… should I put on something? I don’t know any magic for this.” Harry declared softly. He knew that there were spells witches and wizards knew to stop pregnancy risk, but he had not come across such spells in his work yet.</p><p>                Triss smiled at him. She knew that due to her power and all the spells that she had done that there was very little chance she could get pregnant. It was the same situation pretty much across the world for advanced magic users like her. Finally she shook her head and then used her toes to rub and play with his legs to bid him to put the tip of his cock exactly where she wanted him. </p><p>                “Trust me it will be fine Harry… “ Triss declared. With a short nod Harry rolled his hips forward and penetrated Triss Meregold’s lovely labia with his hard cock. </p><p>                “Owaaahh… such warm flesh.” Triss cooed out. Her pussy had already been wet but now she was dripping out with her precum as Harry’s cock speared deep inside of her cunny. It had been a while since she had lain with another and Harry’s cock was definitely a welcome visitor inside of her pussy. Her tight lips coiled around Harry’s large cock and she had to will her body to release. Skilled fingers generally more suited to cast spells rose up and played with her stiff pink nipples. </p><p>                Even as tight as her pussy was Harry pressed on, driving his hips down towards Triss’ flesh so that his cock could explore deeper inside of her squishy warmth. Harry’s thickness registered high on the sorceress’ list and it felt so good being fucked right after nearly dying. Triss loved embracing life whenever possible and helping the strange traveler and her relieve some tress felt incredible as he started to pick up the pace. Triss smiled at his energy. She knew some magic users could use their energy to reinforce their stamina. Today she’d hold back on that to see how the two stacked up with no magical enhancement. Her bare ass rubbed and stirred the silk sheets beneath her flesh. The combination of such soft material coursing against her flesh as Harry’s redhot cock drove deeper towards her cervix was blissful. Soon enough the redheaded woman was starting to scream so loudly that she was glad one of her wards was creating an area of silence as she started to moan out like a whore in Novigrad. </p><p>                “That’s it Harry. Keep going right there. I can weather it.” Triss declared as her breasts bounced to the movement of Harry’s cock pushing deep inside of her pussy. Harry smiled and grabbed a handful of both of her breasts while he started to really hammer his thickness deep inside of her core. He squeezed the soft meat of her tits together and was thrusting so deep now that his balls were nearly churning away against her pussy lip as he fucked the woman he had saved. </p><p>                Eventually Harry wanted to change position. He pulled out, much to the sadness of Triss. She mewled out like a lost kitten as her lips pulsed from the feeling of emptiness without his cock drilling hard into her pussy. Harry grabbed her amazing form and then flipped her over to take her doggy style.</p><p>                Triss almost wanted to remark about the change in position when Harry climbed up on top of her and dressed his cock straight back into her hungry cunt. No fresh quip came from her mouth. Instead her lungs sprouted out wave after wave of heated moans as she was once more filled out by Harry’s cock. The new position allowed his cock to launch even further into her pussy. The head of his cock started to tickle the small opening of her cervix but quickly enough as Triss added her own leg power ot the mix Harry’s cock actually began entering her womb as she moaned like a bitch in heat. Her pussy was pushed forcefully down against the sheets and created even more friction and heat for her while Harry’s cock forced itself against her walls again and again. Triss almost felt like his cock was reshaping her pussy </p><p>                Triss couldn’t believe it when her body started to break down from the heat and pleasure of Harry’s cock. As the next pair of thrusts sunk the tip of his cock straight through the opening of her pussy she howled out as he fucked her doggy style. With his cock still buried deep inside of Triss’ pussy, her entire body started to quake and writhe as her body melted. The pleasure was so intense and her breast mooshed against the silky sheets as Harry continued to pulverize her body. Triss hadn’t had the chance this time to cry out that she was cumming but when Harry’s groans turned into longer more harrowed statements she knew he would cum soon.</p><p>                Harry’s hands gripped hard on Triss’ cushiony hips as he pounded her from behind. With another round of thrusts he reached his end and soon the young wizard started to cum. Triss cried out even louder than before. Her mind and body were completely melted by the repeated surges of white hot cum pouring deep into her pussy and womb. She hadn’t felt this full in a long time and soon both of the lovers were relaxing and trying to catch their breath.</p><p>                Harry eventually extricated his wet cock from deep inside of Triss’ cum saturated pussy. He rested on his back beside Triss and soon fell asleep, he had been close to sleep before arriving in Triss’ world after all. Triss smiled at him and relaxed her eyes. She was in no rush to get cleaned up after such a hard fucking. Strangely enough, if it had been anyone else in the world, it would have been fine having them cum inside of her pussy. But Harry was not from her world. Unbeknownst to both magic users, Harry’s seed took root deep inside of Triss’ womb the first night they met. Luckily for Harry, it would not be the first time he came across a female mage on his mysterious journey.</p>
