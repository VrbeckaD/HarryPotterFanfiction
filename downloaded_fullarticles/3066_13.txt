    <p>     Very little remained in Newt's head after the fight. There was very little there upon entering the fight, if it made a difference - save Credence, protect the obscuris, help him, help him, help him - very little other than the intense stream of commands that echoed through his subconscious.</p><p>     Therefore Newt had not been expecting Percival Graves to put up such an intense fight whilst in the subway. Curses and spells shot back and forth, Newt aiming to stun or disable the opposing wizard, while clearly Graves had some other intentions in mind. The twisted steel of the subway tracks shut up beneath him, filling with electricity and shooting him out of the air and off his feet.</p><p>     "Crucio!" Newt could not have heard Graves hiss the Unforgivable curse beneath his breath, but he gritted his teeth as the pain shot through him, limbs twisting in agony, body writhing along the tracks. There was no more control over his body - there was nothing but the fiery breath of pain, the scourge of the relentless wizard pushing down upon him.</p><p>    Newt managed to grab his wand, sending out a stun with the flick of his wrist. It did very little to stop Graves, and within a moment later his arm had shot back out and Newt's body was twisting, rolling across the tracks in pain. Graves didn't even care enough to give the man his full attention.</p><p>     "Credance! I don't mean any harm - you are so powerful. I can teach you. I can show you the way." Graves walked swiftly forward, moving down to the train tracks, eyes darting down to Newt, who was struggling to point his wand once again at Graves. He kicked it out of Newts hand with a scowl, planting a heavy boot down on the mans neck. "You stay out of my way, you meddling freak."</p><p>     With a swift kick in the ribs, Graves walked past Newt, who had assumed a slight fetal position, cradling his wounds. Grabbing his wand, he twisted his body about, ignoring its cries of protest. "Petrificus Totalus!"</p><p>     Graves body stopped in its place and stood still. The noises of Credance moving about the subway landing became louder, closer, stronger, and Newt hobbled to his feet and began to sprint as fast he could manage down the tracks, following the sounds.</p><p>    Almost immediately after he rounded the corner, out of sight from Graves, the obscuris shot through the long hall, swinging Newt once again off of his feet, throwing him back thirty yards like a doll. He landed on his arm with a thud and a grunt, practically able to hear the bone break beneath the impact of the launch.</p><p>    Newt gripped his wand with his good arm, and after a moment, fought once again to his feet. "Credance! It's going to be okay. You can survive this, I promise. Just - just please. Come back down."</p><p>     Suddenly the halls about him were filled with people, aurors mingling together, voices yelling, spells casting. "No!" Newts cries were deaf to the sound of the Obscuris under the heavy fire of spells from all directions. Newt could hear Graves screaming in protest, the Obscuris screeching and writhing and destroying the very foundations of the subway itself.</p><p>     <em>No, </em>Newt thought, his body tired, his eyes watering, teeth gritted and fists clenched in anger. <em>They can't do this, they can't, not, let him, they can't...</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     The events that happened after Credance's vanishing were an immense blur. Graves - he wasn't graves, and thanks to Newt's good aim, he was captured and revealed to be Grindelwald.</p><p>     The sight of Tina and Queenie, along with Jacob by their side, warmed Newt slightly. His legs were shaky, his breathing uneven, his wrist throbbing and face bloodied and battered by the fight.</p><p>     "Merlins beard, Newt - are you alright?" Tina's anxious voice cut through the shock of the events.</p><p>     Newt nodded earnestly, wincing slightly in pain. "No, I'm alright, 's nothing really, I'm quite-"</p><p>     Jacob shook his head solemnly. "Man - I don't know much about you wizards, but you don't look too hot to me, Newt. What happened down here?"</p><p>     "He fought Grindelwald," Queenie answered, a hint of reverence resounding in her voice. "And Credance..."</p><p>     Tina was still trying to inspect Newt thoroughly, poking at his face and arm, trying to detect the strongest source of pain. "What did he do to you, Newt?" She shook her head, afraid of hearing what might have conspired, though she knew that Newt would answer with little more than a modest shrug. "We - we must get back to the apartment. Heal you properly."</p><p>     Newt shrugged, glancing down at his feet. "I think it might be best if I was to leave. 's just for the best I think - I've caused more than enough trouble here 's all."</p><p>     Tina and Queenie shook their heads, appearing more like sisters than ever. "You're staying," Tina said matter-of-factly, already her stern demeanor turning into one of comfort and concern. "There's no more trouble to be caused, alright? Let's get going."</p><p> </p><p>     Saying goodbye to Jacob had taken another heavy emotional toll upon Newt. He felt drained, physically and mentally, his entire body burning in pain, his mind fatigued and racing with confusing thoughts.</p><p>     By the time that the three of them reached the apartment, he was on the verge of passing out. Tina supported him, one arm wrapped around her slender back. Newt stepped heavily, slowly, and soon enough they dropped him down onto a small cot and began to assess the damage.</p><p>     Immediately as the two women began to poke around his arms and face, Newt's eyes fluttered open. "No - 's fine. 's all fine. Please- just..."</p><p>     Queenie snapped her fingers sternly, and his mouth shut softly. Newt began to sit up in protest, only to be pushed back down by Tina, who was attempting to carefully maneuver his teal blue jacket from around his shoulders. Newt attempted some form of weak resistance, but in reality his body could not fight the gentle onslaught, and he allowed his protective layer to be stripped from him.</p><p>     Queenie gasped dramatically as she unbuttoned his orange vest, eyeing the scarlet stains soaking through the front of his shirt. "Oh, Mr. Scamander..."</p><p>     Tina opened up his shirt, Newt's mind so delirious from the pain that all he could think of was the tinge of red on his cheeks. "Stop. Please - 's... 's... fine..."</p><p>     Once again he began to sit up in protest, only to be pushed down a last time by Tina, who shushed him gently. As the back of Newts head met the pillow once again, his eyes fluttered slowly, and finally his mind surrendered itself to the luxury of sleep.</p><p> </p><p>     Waking up the next morning felt like something out of a dream. Newts body felt detached - like his mind was simply floating through the atmosphering, flying through the air like a Thunderbird, soaring gently about through the breeze. There was no real thought, simply existence, no memory of the previous days happenings, no emotions to bog him down, no memories to taint the world around him. There was only darkness and the smell of tea.</p><p>     Until a clear, gentle voice spoke from the space left of him. "Mr. Scamander?" </p><p>     Newts eyes fluttered open slightly, immediately reeling his body back down to Earth. Along with the physical experience came the sensation of intense pain. Newt groaned slightly in realization, his face aching, ribs sore, arms and legs feeling mashed and beaten.</p><p>     "Mr. Scamander? How are you feeling?" Newt was able to tilt his head slightly to the right, pleasantly surprised to see Tina sitting nervously on the cot beside him, holding a mug of tea and dressed in pyjamas.</p><p>     Newt licked his dry lips, shifting his neck back so that he stared at the ceiling. Trying to ignore that fact that there was no shirt along his bare chest, he murmured, "I've been better, I suppose."</p><p>     Tina chuckled. "I sure hope so. Magic helps a lot - but your nose was broken, along with a couple of ribs, and your wrist was fractured pretty bad. Your legs - and you had some cuts on your chest..." Her voice broke off slightly, feeling awkward in the weight of conversation topic.</p><p>     Newt turned back toward her. "Thank you, Tina. And Queenie, wherever she is, and I'm sorry. 's not really what I had in mind... as an end to the chaos. 's not fair to you."</p><p>     Attempting to resist another slightly chuck, Tina opted for a slightly nervous smile. "What do you mean, Mr. Scamander?"</p><p>     "Please, Tina, it's Newt - just because I'm hurt doesn't mean you don't know me." He shrugged slightly, immediately regretting the movement as he felt his aching body cry out in protest. "'s just - I already, I dunno. 's that I already barged in, and now you're talking care of me 's all. Not... fair. I dunno."</p><p>     The tenderness in his voice made Tina frown slightly. Why was he so scared now? Why did his words echo fearfully - why was he sorry?</p><p>     "You - must be a very humble man, Newt, to say things like that." She clucked slightly to herself, wishing Queenie was here to even out the aura of the room. "It's not your fault you were hurt, Newt."</p><p>     Inside, Newt saw it as quite the opposite. <em>You should have fought harder, </em>an angry voice in his head chided. <em>And Creedance would still be alive.</em> Yet Newt said none of it aloud. "It kind of is- 'sn't it? I dunno - just, thank you, Tina."</p><p>     Tina fought hard not to protest him again, reminding herself how fragile the man was. His skin was pale, and half of his body was wrapped up in bandages. She opened her mouth to speak, about to gesture down to the tea, when suddenly Newts eyes widened and he tried heartily to sit up.</p><p>     "My creatures - Frank and the Mooncalves, the bowtruckles, they need to be - taken- care of-" Newt grunted and winced and pain as he sat up as far as his body would allow. Immediately Tina had played the tea on the bedside table and was attempting to push Newt back down into the bed, panicking as his face grew paler and paler with the straining effort.</p><p>     "Mr. Scamander! They are quite alright, they have all been taken care of!" The words came to Newts ears but he denied them vehemently. Nonetheless, no matter how hard he forced his body to push, he fell back down awkwardly on the bed, muscles sore, head throbbing, eyes watering ever so slightly with strain.</p><p>     Tina stood back up, letting out a quick sigh. "They were taken care of this morning, Mr. Scamander - Newt. Queenie and I figured things out well enough - we used some of your writings as a sort of guide. They all seemed fairly happy, though concerned over your absence."</p><p>     Immediately she could see emotion filling into his eyes at the words. "I miss them." He said simply, then moving his gaze from the ceiling back to Tina. Newt appeared heavily exhausted, now white as the sheets he lay upon. "I think - I'll rest some more. Tired 's all. I'll - I'll tend to them tomorrow."</p><p>     His eyes fluttered closed once again and Tina found herself grimacing slightly, walking silently out the room, and shutting the door silently behind her. Queenie sat at the kitchen table, an open newspaper laid flat on the dark wood, her eyes bouncing from the door to Tina. Her face was sad, and Tina found herself tilting her head in confusion. "What's wrong?"</p><p>     Queenie opened her mouth, then closed it again, shaking her head slowly. "It's Newt, I guess - Tina... he's a sad man."</p><p>     Tina pursed her lip slightly, moving over to the counter to pour herself a cup of coffee, eyes flickering to the half full pot of hot water as it floated in the air. "He didn't seem too sad, really, just upset he couldn't get to his creatures, Queenie."</p><p>     Queenie stood up, crossing her arms as if cold - the frown that painted her face made Tina uncomfortable and she attempted to turn away from it. But Queenie persisted. "No, Tina, not like that. I was listening to him, you know, his thoughts - and... and he's sad. He thinks this is all his fault. Newt's laying there thinking, he could not give one damn about himself. All he's thinking is that he's made a million mistakes."</p><p>     Tina stopped, the mug, suspended in mid-pour, hanging still in the air. "Does he really think that?" Her voice came out as a shocked murmur, and she cleared it, continuing the pour the water into the mug.</p><p>     "Relentlessly," Queenie replied, backing away slightly and adjusting her robe around her body. "What do you think we ought to do about this whole situation?"</p><p>     The mug settled down on the counter, and Tina picked it up, sipping at the hot liquid, and turning towards Queenie. She grimaced and cast her eyes over to the door, behind which Newt could be heard very quietly snoring. "Every damn thing we can."</p>
