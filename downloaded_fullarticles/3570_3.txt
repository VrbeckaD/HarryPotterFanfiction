    <p>Harry watched his godfather fall through the veil in abject horror- one of the only links he had left to his parents, one of the few people who really cared about him, someone who guided him, hugged him, <em> loved </em> him, and he was just… just gone.  He couldn’t believe it- <em> wouldn’t </em>believe it.  Rational thought fled to the side as he rushed towards the veil, ignoring the sounds of the battle raging behind him and dodging Remus’ attempt to hold him back.  Not slowing down at all, he jumped through after Sirius, ignoring the background cries of “Harry!” from all his friends.</p><p>    Beyond the veil, it was rather like what Harry had pictured- white and misty, like being wrapped in a fog, but with nothing beyond it.  This was merely an entryway, he supposed, where you waited to be taken to wherever you would go. He took a step of forward, feeling faint, disconnected.  His head hurt, and he felt as if he was… <em> spreading out, </em>almost.  He was losing his connection to the living world, and he needed to find Sirius and get out- quickly.</p><p>    It didn’t take long.  Once Harry managed to pull himself together as much as he could, he stumbled forwards, and then Sirius was just <em> there.   </em></p><p><em>     </em>“Pup?!” He yelped, looking surprised but otherwise unharmed (whereas Harry felt himself falling apart).  “What are you doing here?!”</p><p>    “I followed you in,” Harry grunted, feeling like he was floating, but not in the good way- like his mind was going up and the rest of him was stuck at the bottom.  “We… gotta get you back… before you’re gone for good...”</p><p>    “I’m fine, pup, really,” Sirius assured, leaning down worriedly.  “I’m not dead- I’d feel different if I were. You, though,” he fought the rising tide of panic in his throat.  “You look like you’re halfway there.”</p><p>    “He is,” suddenly, there was another voice, and they were looking into the face of a tall, pale man that <em> seemed </em> young but whose eyes spoke to the contrary- there were eons of depth to them, the irises nearly as dark as the pupils.  His hair was black, but unlike that of Sirius or Harry, it seemed to <em> absorb </em>light rather than reflect it.  Padfoot knew, with the certainty that washed through him painfully like ice-water down his throat, that he was looking into the face of death.</p><p>    “What- <em> why?!   </em> I mean, <em> I </em>feel fine.”</p><p>    “You, Sirius Black, <em> are </em> fine- the veil will not only <em> allow </em> you back through but <em> demand </em>it.  But Harry,” his eyes seemed to soften for a fraction of a second as he looked at the teenager, and it occurred to Sirius that for all the ways this man fit the typical image of death, emotion was rather unexpected.  “Harry is torn- he has a horcrux of Tom Riddle inside of him, and he must get rid of it before it drags him back through. As for now, he is only half-alive, not enough to go back through with this piece of necromantic filth inside.  The veil will not let him stay, but he cannot go on either, in this state-of in-between, so he is dying. The only way is for him to rid himself of the horcrux.”</p><p>    “How?” Harry groaned, sweat beading on his forehead.  He could feel himself trying to go, and it was taking everything he had to stay.</p><p>    “You must expel it, child,” death’s baritone voice wove around them, strangely comforting.  “I am in no hurry to take you before your time, but I have no control over who I take and who I don’t.  What the ancient laws demand, they shall have. Unless you fight it. It is your connection to the enemy of nature, he who has split his soul.  In this state, you shall feel it easier. You must take it and <em> push, </em>but it will not want to go.  You must make it.”</p><p>    “I… okay,” Harry wrenched out from between his clenched jaw.  He was <em> so </em> tired, and he wanted to give up, give in, just go on to wherever, but Sirius was looking at him with such concern, such <em> love, </em> that he determined to fight until he had nothing left.  He found the evil thing, the <em> horcrux </em> (he didn’t quite know what that was, but he knew it was awful, from the way that this connection that had always hurt his head and forced him together with Voldemort had become more than a tenuous link, it had become a tangible, <em> behemoth </em> force, black and putrid and oily, thrashing and twisting and coiling around his essence, determined to use up everything he had in its fight to stay, that if <em> it </em>must go, so must Harry).</p><p>    For Sirius, he fought- he took the evil and he <em> shoved.   </em>But it did not want to go.</p><p>    “You think that it is worth it, to stay?” Said the little voice in his mind, sounding so, <em> so </em> like Tom Riddle.  “You are no better than me, and your muggle relatives knew it.  The wizarding world knew it, Umbridge knew it. Do you really want to get rid of me, to have no excuse for being the miserable wretch you are?  Nobody wants you- the Dursleys have whipped the hatred into your back, haven’t they? You carry <em> visible </em> reminders of what a <em> freak </em> you are.  You only get those you care about in trouble.  Your godfather is only here because he came to save <em> you.   </em> Let me take you, take you away.  Don’t fight- you’re useless anyway.  Be useful, for <em> once </em> in your life be useful and just give in, give up.  Give yourself to me, and all the pain will be over.”  This piece of Tom wanted to stay, and it wanted to use <em> Harry </em>to do it.  </p><p>It was arrogant enough to believe that it could cheat death yet again, if only Harry would stop fighting it.  If it could use Harry’s powers, it could become alive enough in its own right to go back through. Harry, well… Harry would fade away to nothing, and that wasn’t really its concern now, was it?</p><p>Harry fought- he knew what it wanted, this evil, and he wasn’t going to let it win.  It made some good points- he <em> did </em> bring pain to those he cared about, and he <em> was </em> tired, <em> so </em> tired, of fighting this losing battle, but he <em> had </em>to keep fighting it.  He couldn’t leave Ron and Hermione to go on alone.  He didn’t want to die- not yet.</p><p>But maybe they <em> would </em> be better off without him there… after all, <em> Cedric </em>would have.  Maybe he…</p><p><em> No, </em> he reminded himself.   <em> Ron and Hermione love you- they </em> <b> <em>need </em> </b> <em> you to fight, because they </em> <b> <em>want </em> </b> <em> you with them. </em> And even if they <em> would </em>be better off without him, when it was a choice between him or this piece of Tom, this piece of Tom that only wanted him to stop fighting so that it could take what was left of him, well, he was undeniably the better choice.  This foul thing didn’t even have a body or a soul- it was trying to feed off of Harry’s strength because it didn’t have its own, and Harry wasn’t going to listen to something like that.</p><p><em> Worthless, </em> it reminded him, feeling Harry gathering his strength as it lost more and more of its grip.   <em> Worthless freak.   </em>It rifled frantically through Harry’s memories, pulling out images of Vernon, advancing with the belt, Vernon, drunk out of his mind after Petunia and Dudley were asleep, breaking a whisky bottle against Harry’s skin because he hadn’t gotten him something to eat on the table fast enough.  It pulled out long, hungry nights in the cupboard, the winter air cold through the slats, the heat turned off on the first floor because all the bedrooms were upstairs and there was ‘no need to waste good utilities on the freak.’ It pulled out beatings and cruel words and illnesses where he was given a kick and a slap for putting ‘the family’ at risk with his germs and shoved under the stairs again.  “No food for you, boy,” Petunia would say as she slammed the cupboard door. “If you can’t even do your chores, what use is it to waste it on you?”</p><p><em> No, </em> Harry pushed back, pulling up images of laughing in the common room with Ron and Hermione, of hugging Remus, of having Mrs. Weasley fuss over him like one of her own children.   <em> I </em> <b> <em>matter </em> </b> <em> to people.   </em>Like casting a Patronus, he drew on his admittedly smaller cache of happy memories, of being loved and getting his first Weasley sweater and making Dobby smile with the socks he’d gotten him for Christmas.</p><p>Tom’s soul fragment felt itself slipping away, and it pulled a final, last-ditch attempt that it was sure would work.</p><p>“She died for you,” it taunted, pulling the memory of the night Lily Potter had died, begging Lord Voldemort to spare her child as he offered to let her live if she would just step aside.</p><p>For a moment, it thought that that might have done it, as Harry stalled, a crushing ache in his chest.  But, right as it began to congratulate itself, Harry squared up again.</p><p><em> NO, </em> he boomed, tired and frail but assertive and determined.   <b> <em>YOU </em> </b> <em> KILLED HER!   </em>A final heaving assault, and it was gone.  Harry knew no more after that.</p><p>______</p><p>“It’s gone,” Sirius said, watching the black, screaming wraith as it was jerked violently into the mist.  “Wait, why doesn’t Harry look better?!” He croaked, his heart sinking to his knees.</p><p>“Oh dear,” Death sighed.  “I had hoped that would be enough.”</p><p>“What do you mean, <em> enough?” </em>Sirius demanded.  “You said the horcrux was the thing keeping him here.”</p><p>“The horcrux was <em> part </em>of the reason keeping him here,” the deity clarified morosely, going over to turn Harry, whose glamours had fallen in the fight with the horcrux.  “Look at him, Sirius- he is not well.”</p><p>“I…” Padfoot finally got a closer look at his godson.  He was thin, cheeks hollow and eyes sunken, his brown skin far paler than it should be.  Death lifted Harry’s old, threadbare shirt, showing Sirius the crisscrossing networks of raised, knotted scars on his back and chest from Vernon’s belt, Marge’s dog chains, and whatever else his relatives had on them to hurt him with.  “They… his relatives, they…”</p><p>“Yes,” Death exhaled, his voice bearing far more pain than one would expect from him.  “The abuse has been long, and it has weakened him. And look…” he pointed to Harry’s hand.</p><p><em> I must not tell lies, </em>those cruel, raw wounds that he had been glamouring to look far better than they were so Ron and Hermione wouldn’t panic, were now shown in all their painful, ugly truth.  The cuts were weeping, bleeding, the hand swollen.</p><p>“Umbridge,” Sirius growled, voice low and deadly.</p><p>“I will be glad, I must admit, to get my hands on her,” Death agreed.  “His hand is infected fairly severely, and on top of the abuse and the effort from expelling the horcrux, he isn’t healthy enough to be allowed back through.  He cannot stay here much longer. As of yet he is not able to pass on, but that will change soon. Being in the in-between like this, the veil demands that those inside go one way or the other.  Since Harry was on the fence before, and then had to fight away such a presence, the beyond is winning over. It is taking all of my influence to keep him here now.”</p><p>“So what do I do?!” Sirius was on his knees, one hand protectively around his shallowly breathing godson.  “Do I have to trade- I will! Take my life force- just send him back!”</p><p>“It does not work like that, my friend,” Death whispered softly.  “I am not like in the myths, with a choice of who to collect and who to leave.  I am merely a slave to the ancient laws. Do you think I <em> want </em> to rip families apart, to watch innocent children fall to illness while the evil and corrupt remain living on and extorting the weak for their own gain?  No, I can only do what I am told, and it is taking all of my limited influence to hold him here this long. However, there <em> might </em>be something I can do…”</p><p>“What? Anything- just do it!” Sirius yelled.</p><p>“It is not quite so simple,” the immortal being held up a hand to silence him.  “Hear me first and then decide,” he ordered, and Sirius swallowed his protests with restraint and nodded tightly.</p><p>“Harry has been touched by me before and survived- I had never seen such a thing- it was an act of strength, not just the love of his mother.  Her sacrifice was noble, but the ancient magics that govern our world would not have let him stay if it he was not destined to. The fact that he has lived this long continues to prove this- I have gotten close- too close- to him many times, and each I was relieved to find myself turned away.  But now this connection may help us- because I have touched him once, completely, we have a link. I can do with him what I have never been able to do before, and pour some of my power into him. But…” he continued, when Sirius opened his mouth again. “I haven’t any idea what the side effects might be, as this has never been done before.  He would live, surely, and he would continue to be <em> Harry, </em>but other than that I cannot say.  If it was decided that the risk was too great, he could go on- he has done more than enough and sacrificed more than enough to earn eternal paradise with his parents.  The choice must be made by you, as he is not in a position to be able to.”</p><p>“I…” Sirius worried his lip.  Would it be selfish to keep him here, to take him back to fight a war when he could see an end to his pain?  He wouldn’t be <em> fixed </em>when he went back, either- he’d be ill and weak and would have to recover both physically and mentally from this abuse that none of them had seen.  Should he let him go, for Harry’s sake?</p><p>“We don’t have much time,” Death warned him, and Padfoot snapped up.  Harry deserved to <em> live, </em>to see his friends again and to have children and to see his dreams come to fruition.  James and Lily would want that for him, and he had to believe that Harry would want that too, since he had fought hard enough that the horcrux, an abhorrent, loathsome magic, was expelled.  That took effort, effort that someone who wanted to die would not have been able to muster… right?</p><p>“Do it,” he shoved as much authority into his voice as he could muster, despite still having some doubts.</p><p>“Very well,” Death agreed, and Sirius may have been just grasping at straws, but he thought that he seemed pleased with the decision.</p><p>“There is one more thing,” he added in his deep, silky voice as he knelt down and put his hands over Harry’s body.  “You cannot tell him what has transpired- it is in the ancient laws that an agreement between an immortal and another being may not be discussed unless it is brought up directly.  Harry will have to somehow figure it out, down to the last detail, on his own, and if that happens you may confirm that it is true. It is not my choice to make, either, I am afraid.  It is just the way things are- if you found yourself trying to tell him, the words would become trapped and simply would not come. It is a stupid rule- it seems rather arbitrary to me, as myself nor any of my associates have been able to figure out why it is so.  The ancient laws can be rather… well, I believe you humans would refer to it as ‘total dicks.’”</p><p>“Right then,” Sirius was feeling a bit of an information overload.  “Is he ready to go back through?”</p><p>“Yes,” Death nodded thoughtfully, stepping back to survey Harry, who didn’t look any different, to be honest.  “But he will need lots of time to recover, and he is still human- look after him, and make sure his life is good.  I have grown rather fond of this little human, fonder than I have been of any before. With this job, I have found myself having to grow indifferent just to bear it, but with him… there is something that caught my attention, and I have been hoping and wishing that he would come out alright.  Perhaps it is our connection, the fact that he has been the only one yet to resist this hateful power of mine, but I wish for him the chance to utilize this unbreakable spirit, and to find the happiness he deserves. Go, Sirius Orion Black, and live your life, but know this- we have made a pact, and it has bound <em> us </em>together as well.  We may yet see each other before I greet you here again, and I hope you shall not look upon those times with fear.”</p><p>“I owe you a great deal,” Sirius utilized all his hated pureblood training as he stood tall, his godson in his arms, and looked Death respectfully in the eyes.  “I never thought I would find myself saying this, but Death, it was nice to meet you.” He carefully readjusted Harry’s unconscious form and stuck one hand out for the immortal to shake.</p><p>“Likewise,” he quirked one corner of his mouth as they clasped hands.  “I do not often get a chance to cultivate intrapersonal relationships, as I am usually, well…” he made a garrotting motion across his throat.  “I hope we can come to call ourselves friends.”</p><p>“I’ve definitely had worse,” Sirius chuckled bitterly, thinking of Peter.  “Well, thanks a lot, and I guess I’ll be seeing you around. And he turned and walked back through the veil.  </p>
