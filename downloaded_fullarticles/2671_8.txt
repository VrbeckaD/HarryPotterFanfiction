    <p>"Graves"</p><p>That voice jerked Percival Graves out of his stupor, unaware that he had just been followed, he was definitely off track, and for his line of work, he had to be careful. He slowly looked up to see the silhouette of a man. He hadn't recognized the voice, not until the stranger moved out from the shadows. Grave's heartbeat increased as he backed away, his wand was in his back pocket, so if he made a move for it, he would be stunned by the man before him. </p><p>Percival Graves has never been afraid, sure he would have fleeting moments, but they wouldn't account to the amount of fear he has now. Standing before him is Gellert Grindelwald, he has cornered Graves, knowing that he would be alone. He's silent, the pale-haired wizard stalks towards him, a small smile showing, his mismatched eyes trained on the well-dressed man before him.</p><p>"I have finally found you".</p><p>Graves has no clue why Grindelwald would be looking for him, but a few moments later when the wizard is now closer than ever before, too close to his liking, he realizes, but it's too late. Gellert cocked his head to the side, just a little, both were of the same height, so Graves couldn't use his height to intimidate. He drew a shaky breath, cursing internally when Grindelwald heard it, "do I frighten you?" His hand suddenly came up towards Grave's face and gently stroked his cheek. Percival in return took a step back, away from the dark wizard's cold touch, though Gellert followed him until Graves's back hit the brick wall behind him. </p><p>"Please don't run from me".</p><p>Gellert gently placed his hand on Percival's arm, again, Percival cursed, he couldn't apparate without taking the other wizard with him, and he wouldn't risk breaking contact whilst in mid-apparation, in fear of being splintched. </p><p>"No... I'm not afraid of you".</p><p>Percival said, a little shocked that he got through that sentence without a shake. Gellert smiled at him, his hand slowly moving up Percival's arm, never leaving his body. Percival didn't know what to do, he couldn't look at Gellert in the eye, that would make it too awkward. He could feel the darker wizard's hand cross over to his chest, rubbing over his right nipple, which caused Percival to gasp and jolt. With that happening, Gellert stopped, his eyes widening before they softened just a little, and his hand continued on, now moving up to his collar bone, tracing it before passing and reaching his neck, just so that he could place his hand on Percival's pulse point.</p><p>"Stop".</p><p>Percival snarls, he can't really push Gellert away, because he's up against the wall, but the other wizard ignores him, his eyes raking over Percival with an expression the formal wizard cannot read... Or is it an expression he doesn't want to read? He then tried to make a break for it, attempting to shove Gellert to the side and run. But just as he does that, Gellert is able to right himself before catching Percival from behind. His right hand clasped over Percival's forehead, effectively pulling his head back to expose his neck to the pale moonlight, and his left arm as wound it's way around Percival's thin waist. Gellert's fingers have also intertwined in the loopholes of his pants so that it'll be harder for Percival to unwrap himself from Gellert's grip. Percival is panting, he's fit, but that took a lot of energy. Gellert is now pressed up behind him, his head resting against his. <br/>
Then he hears Gellert, he's smelling him, he can't see his expression, but he can tell that the dark wizard is rolling his eyes in ecstasy.</p><p>"You smell wonderful, sweetheart".</p><p>Percival freezes when he feels Gellert's hot mouth gently clamp around the lobe of his ear, now he can't move in risk of losing his ear, all Gellert had to do was bite down hard enough. The wizard pulls Percival's head back a little more, to the point that it's getting hard to swallow, he's straining his neck too far back, at one point Percival chokes on his own saliva and begins coughing. </p><p>"Shh, calm down, you'll end up choking yourself. Please don't be frightened of me, you're safe with -".</p><p>"I'm far from safe! especially with you!"</p><p>Percival could feel Gellert tense against him, and he felt the hand on his forehead clamp down, "I understand of my position to you, but I suggest you don't fight me".</p><p>"Or what? You'll kill me, torture -".</p><p>Suddenly Gellert has Percival up against the rough brick wall, his head knocks the wall a little, stunning the man, his belly pressed up against the cold barrier with Gellert behind him, his body still hot against his back, pinning him in place. Percival has turned his head to left, giving him a little view of Gellert, who brings his face closer, so that his lips are close to Percival's.</p><p>"I won't kill you, or torture you, I'll promise you that". </p><p>"Let me go then!" </p><p>Gellert can hear the frustration mixed with belittling fear in the formal wizard's voice, Percival was afraid of him, of what he could do. It was very hard to be reassuring to the other wizard when he had him pinned up against a wall, so he kisses Percival. His right hand, that had been on his forehead, now resting on Percival's shoulder, has managed to squeeze through the front of Percival, capturing his chin and turning him more towards Gellert, allowing the dark wizard to lock lips with him.<br/>
The kiss is very slow and rather passionate... Well on Gellert's side, Percival has gone completely still, <em>shock</em>, he was being kissed my Gellert Grindelwald. Percival's vision begins to fade, he's getting tired, he tries to fight it, but his muscles are giving out, then he collapses, his body slumping and falling back into Gellert, who is now holding him up, his head lolling back against Gellert's shoulder, exposing his neck once again.</p><p>Gellert smiled as he tenderly kissed Percival's pulse point, he wasn't going to hurt Graves at all, he just had to get that through the Auror's head, it was a little difficult, but he got there. He relishes in holding the Auror, he was fit, his left-hand travels down to Percival's stomach, he's tempted to go a little further, but he knows he should do this at him. So he apparates, taking Percival Graves with him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
