    <p>Mrs. Dursley was watching a program on the tele about youth ballroom dancing one afternoon and became enamoured with the thought of her little dudders waltzing in a suit. It would also make her seem like a better mother than the others in the neighborhood. She wanted to start lessons right away and new just where to go from the program she watched. But she worried about <em>the boy</em>. He was too young to be left alone (what would the neighbors think? Not to mention she didn’t trust him in her lovely house) and the usual sitter was visiting her family for the month. Vernon was busy making connection for work hoping for a promotion so couldn’t look after him. She and Vernon had spent the entire duration of the boy’s stay in their home setting him up as a troublemaker and delinquent, no one would think to watch the brat.</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Dursley silently fumed in her living room. She’d have to take the boy with her precious son to the dancing class. So with a pinched face that weekend, she loaded the car with enough snacks to keep her baby boy happy and drove to the dancing studio.</p><p> </p><p>Once she herded her charges into the studio she had to sign up Dudley Dursley and Harry Potter for the newcomers introduction and sat on the side of the room as she proudly watched her son with the other children while ignoring her nephew.</p>
