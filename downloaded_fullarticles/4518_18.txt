    <p>First Year Ruby Black shuffled into the Great Hall the day after the sorting ceremony, adjusting her emerald and silver tie nervously.</p><p>Kids were running around, both older and younger, yelling excitedly to friends and comparing class schedules.</p><p>She had barely managed to avoid a knot of Gryffindors as she ventured toward the edge of the hall when a ball of canary yellow and black barreled right into her, followed by a painful squeak and limbs flying everywhere.</p><p>The Slytherin narrowly missed bashing her head on the edge of the bench, the cracking sound from the other side of the row indicated the mass now identifiable as a Hufflepuff Second Year was not so lucky.</p><p>Ruby jumped up and rushed to the whimpering, slightly bleeding student, pulling her up carefully with the hand not clutching her wand.</p><p>“Don’t move, alright?”</p><p>The other girl stiffened, smiling slightly as her head injury was quickly healed, the blood cleaned up as well.</p><p>“Thank you. I’m forever not looking where I’m going. I was trying to deliver some cookies to a sick friend at the Slytherin table.”</p><p>Ruby nodded, not responding other than a quiet “Be careful,” before she started walking away.</p><p>The Hufflepuff scrambled up and gathered her things, managing to catch up to Ruby just as she reached the table, scooting into the bench next to a rather green looking student and handing them a brown package before turning to her rescuer.</p><p>“Hey! Where did you learn how to do that, I saw you just get sorted last night!”</p><p>Ruby blushed a little under the scrutiny of her peers, her twin sister Emerald smiling from behind a book as they failed to look like they weren’t listening.</p><p>“My parents are not nice, so I ended up vanishing into books to hide from them.”</p><p>The badger’s face fell for a second before her 100-watt smile returned.</p><p>“Well, we’ll have to introduce you to Madam Pomfrey; she’ll be thrilled to have someone who can fix others up. You’re really talented... um?”</p><p>“Ruby. Ruby Black.”</p><p>“I’m Audra Tauren!”</p>
