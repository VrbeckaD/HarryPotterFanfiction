    <p>“So what are you doing now that there’s no Dark Lord left to defeat anymore?” Draco asked when they met the next time.</p>
<p>Harry looked up at him confused, apparently completely unprepared for the question. “I meet my ex-nemesis/soulmate in a Muggle café.” He finally settled on.</p>
<p>Draco sighed. “And other than that?” He could see the hurt in Harry’s eyes as he demanded a real answer and felt sorry for asking instantly. But he wouldn’t take it back, primarily because he really wanted to know now.</p>
<p>“Nothing much…” Harry mumbled. “I’m currently renovating Grimmauld Place a little.”</p>
<p>“That’s a house from the Black family, right?” Draco asked. He had heard his mother talk about a house of the Black family Harry had inherited once.</p>
<p>“Uh… yeah. I inherited it from Sirius.”</p>
<p>“Why are you torturing yourself like this?” Draco wasn’t sure where that question had come from but as soon as he had asked he knew he wanted to know the answer.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You’ve attended every funeral thus far, you live in the house your deceased godfather willed to you, hell you probably do a hundred more things to remind you of the horrible things that happened in the war. Why are you torturing yourself like that?”</p>
<p>Harry just looked up at Draco and blinked. “All those people died for me, because of me. How can I not attend their funerals? How can I not mourn their deaths?”</p>
<p>“Harry.” Draco sighed and took the hand lying on the table in both of his. Mesmerized he watched it turn grey for a second before he focused on Harry's face again. “All the people who died in the war died for their ideologies, some died for pureblood supremacy and others for equality. No one died for Voldemort, for Dumbledore or even for you. They believed in something and fought for it and died in a <em>war</em>. It’s not your fault they died because you didn’t end it sooner. You were a teenager for Merlin’s sake; you shouldn’t <em>have</em> to fight a war. A school shouldn’t be war ground, making every student part of the war raging on. It’s very noble of you to attend their funerals but you don’t have to. I don’t think anyone who matters to you expects you to.”</p>
<p>Harry just stared at him. Then he blinked. Then he continued to stare. Draco could almost see the cogs in his brain working.</p>
<p>“I…” he stammered. “You… you’re right…”</p>
<p>“Yes, I usually am,” Draco teased and squeezed Harry’s hand. The grey tint deepened a little. “Why don’t you volunteer in an orphanage for example? You would still help the survivors of the war but not risk your mental health for it.”</p>
<p>Draco would love to do something like that. He wanted to redeem himself by showing that he wasn’t his father who just donated money to whoever would support him in his political career. He honestly wanted to help. There was only one reason he hadn’t offered his help at an orphanage, yet. He was scared they wouldn’t let him help because they would only see the Dark Mark and how much he looked like his father.</p>
<p>“That’s a great idea actually,” Harry admitted after some thinking. “Would you come with me? We could spend some quality soulmate bonding time.”</p>
<p>It sounded like an honest offer and Draco found himself nodding. He had wanted to do it anyway, so why not? And with the Saviour of the Wizarding World at his side he surely wouldn’t get kicked out unless he did something to provoke it.</p>
<p>The bright smile Harry gave him in response showed Draco he had done the right thing. “Do you know any orphanages we could go to?”</p>
<p>“I actually know about a few,” Draco admitted. “I did a little research already because I wanted to help in a way that had nothing to do with just giving money but I chickened out when I realized that probably no one would want to have me.” He hated being this open with less than flattering things about himself but he really wanted to get to know Harry and he wouldn’t if he didn’t open up in turn.</p>
<p>“Thar’s very noble of you, Draco,” Harry replied and Draco couldn’t help but show a little smile at the praise. “I’m sure the orphanages would appreciate your help without looking at your past. Even offering to help shows how different you are from your father. We should definitely visit one together.”</p>
<p>“I think it beats getting coffee any time,” Draco joked and earned an honest smile from Harry.</p>
<p>“I have to agree. You should choose an orphanage and send me an owl when you want to go.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite agreeing that an orphanage beat the cosy café they met in any time it took them several weeks to finally visit one. After drinking one too many Firewhiskeys Draco had finally sent Harry an owl telling him he had decided on the Remus Lupin Orphanage, named after the war hero and Harry’s good friend. Draco’s research had shown that they not only took in war orphans but also children who had been bitten by a magical creature, transforming them, and had been abandoned in the process.</p>
<p>Draco only remembered he had sent the letter when he got an excited letter back from Harry the next day. They decided to spend some time there the next weekend but still met for their obligatory coffee on Wednesday. It had become kind of a tradition to meet every week and Draco wasn’t sure they would stop their coffee dates (he refused to call them anything else, after all Harry had told him they could become boyfriends someday) once they spent time together at the orphanage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once there they were received by a white haired matron, who looked every bit the loving mother she seemed to be for the children. She ushered them inside and into the kitchen without looking at them twice. Draco and Harry shared a smile, grateful that they weren't treated like celebrity or villain but like normal people who wanted to help children in the aftermath of the war.</p>
<p>They talked to Lilian for a while (she had introduced herself to them as Lilian Argent and insisted they call her by her first name) and once the nap time was over she ushered them into the playroom so they could meet the children.</p>
<p>The first child to approach them was a little girl with bright blue eyes and chocolate brown hair. Lillian introduced her as Robin.</p>
<p>“I like your hair,” she said with a bright smile.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Draco replied, making sure his hair still lay flat.</p>
<p>“No silly,” Robin corrected with a giggle. “I like his hair.” She pointed to Harry, who looked a little uncomfortable at being addressed. “It looks so fluffy.”</p>
<p>Harry blushed furiously, not really used to dealing with either children or compliments so he was understandably a little overwhelmed by the combination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you, darling,” he finally brought out. “Do you want to make sure it’s as fluffy as it looks?”</p>
<p>The girl smiled brightly and nodded. Harry smiled back and pulled her onto his lap so she could reach his unruly mop of black hair.</p>
<p>“It’s really soft!” she marvelled but then hesitated. “Uhm… I don’t know your name, Mister.”</p>
<p>“My name is Harry. And you are Robin, right?”</p>
<p>Robin nodded excitedly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the meantime Draco had attracted the attention of another kid. A small toddler waddled up to him and demanded “Up! Up!”</p>
<p>Draco sighed and, resigning himself to his fate, picked the boy up. He had never held a child before so he was a bit unsure of what to do except keeping the boy from falling from his lap. Considering how much he moved it was probably a good idea.</p>
<p>After some squirming the child finally settled down against his chest and he found it felt good to hold a child and he was filled with the urge to protect this little human from everything the world might throw his way. His thoughts drifted off further and he imagined Harry and himself in the future, adopting one of the children from the orphanage, giving them all the love Harry and he had never gotten in their childhoods.</p>
<p>“What are you smiling about?” Harry asked, jarring him out of his dream future and back into the present.</p>
<p>“Just a stupid daydream,” he muttered. He wouldn’t tell Harry he had fantasized about them adopting children – at least not yet. They were barely friends, they still had a long way to go until they could begin a relationship and even longer until they would even consider adoption.</p>
<p>“Whatever it was, it looked like it made you very happy,” Harry pointed out. “I’ve never seen you smile so brightly and you have smiled a fair amount whenever we met for coffee.”</p>
<p>To his mortification a blush formed on Draco’s cheeks. Harry had watched his smiles so closely that he could see the subtle differences. It made Draco feel a little giddy with happiness.</p>
<p>“Yes, that smile,” Harry said. “That’s the smile you just wore.”</p>
<p>Draco’s blush deepened. He was doomed. He had officially fallen completely for Harry now, no turning back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When they wanted to leave several hours later, children were clinging to their legs, pleading with them to stay just a little longer, to just read one more story or play one more game. Harry’s heart ached for them, how little love had they experienced in their short lives that they were so clingy after only one afternoon?</p>
<p>They could finally separate themselves by promising to come back the next day just before it was time for the youngest children to go to bed. They said goodbye to every child who wanted to with a kiss to the cheek or the forehead and waved to all of them and Lillian on their way out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once he had apparated home Harry had to admit Draco had been right, going to the orphanage was a much better way of helping the survivors of the war than anything he had done before and he looked forward to seeing all the children again the next day.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the mirror he traced all the places Draco had casually touched him during the afternoon with his fingers. With a smile on his face and Draco and the children in his thoughts, he slowly fell asleep.</p>
