    <p>Sunlight pours through the window panes of Scorpious Malfoy’s bedroom, shifting past the little boys crib that sat isolated in the middle of the baby blue painted room. </p><p>Pitch black siloetes of a stag, wolf, and a dog chase after each other across the walls. Leaping from high rocks and slipping down slopes near a grand stream.</p><p>Meanwhile inside the cradle lay a small green eyed toddler with soft blonde locks, small legs kick the air. Everything for a moment seems still, until a figure seemingly draped in starlight appears beside the crib. </p><p>A messy mass of black hair covers their scalp, providing warmth and a sense of softness to their appearance. Their skin is lightly tanned naturally, but he still remained a little pale, deathly pale almost. </p><p>They wore a dark blue cloak that masked their physical appearance from sight. However no amount of shadows could hide the brightly shining sage irises that only Scorpious could have inherited. </p><p>Harry Potter. Or more so a shadow of what once was Harry Potter, although this shadow of what once had been was indeed a shadow. It wasn’t entirely a shadow, but rather an angel that had a duty to see through, watch over its loved ones. </p><p>An angel is born from suicide, but even though there are tales of heaven and hell, none of it exists. Despite that angels are purely believed in the wizarding world to be creatures that were once human which died from suicide. </p><p>The pain they felt follows them into their new life style, memories, habits, everything. Harry Potter suffered dealing with the strikes at the ministry of magic, although it had nothing to do with him it did affect his job and pay. </p><p>Not only that, but he felt downtrodden by his best friend Ron, whom decided dumping his own children on him was okay. Even though Harry didn’t have the time nor energy to babysit other children when he already had one that was- is still very important to him. </p><p>Harry with his bright eyes stared fondly down at his son, small hands reach up towards his papa. His own eyes mirror their creators, slowly both their eyes begin to glisten with oncoming tears. </p><p>Scorpious opens his small mouth, corners of his lips turning up into a small smile. Harry smiles gently at his son, forever shall he remind him of Draco. </p><p>“Hello, son” Harry greets the young wizard quietly, gently reaching a hand out to lightly stroke his golden hair. </p><p>A small bubbly gurgle irrupts from his wet lips, weakly leaning into the touch of his parents hand. Scorpius hadn’t smiled as much since his parents were fussing over him in the dining room, before Harry died. </p><p>Harry drew back his hand, Scorpius began to breathe in deep breaths, chest beginning to heave. Tears only now trickling down his soft cheeks, Harry too. </p><p>“Pa-Pa-Pa.. Paa-Paaaa!” Scorpius sobs loudly, hands clenching down on thin air. Eyes taking in the sight of his vanishing papa leaving him alone. Leaving Daddy all alone. </p><p>Suddenly Draco charged into the room, eyes bright with promise of pain directed to nothing. Draco sighed deeply, chest deflating slowly and eyes dim as he stares sadly upon his son. </p><p>“Score” he called out sweetly and quietly in hopes of calming his baby with his voice, but resulted in no change. </p><p>The Malfoy stride towards the crib to gaze upon the crying baby, sage eyes stare back at him. Harry’s eyes. </p><p>“You miss papa?” He states more than asks even though he didn’t expect an answer. </p><p>Scorpius stopped crying almost immediately. </p><p>“Me too”</p>
