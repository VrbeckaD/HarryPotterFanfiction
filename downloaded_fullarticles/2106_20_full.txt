      <p>So, sorry for those hoping I'd be updating one of my other stories soon. I hit a bit of a writers block with them, and then I had this dream last night that demanded to be written. So, a new story for you all! I'm not sure if this will be a part of my Master of Death and Re-incarnation chronicles yet, read it and let me know, okay? I'm thinking of making this the very first piece of the series. </p><p>And, yay! I finally chose a different name from Sirina for my Fem!Harry Character. Calla is a delicate form of Lilly, so I thought it was a great name for a Fem!Harry. </p><p>Hope you enjoy!</p>

</p><p>                The night was dark, the silence oppressive. Calla held onto her mother’s hand tightly. Behind her, in the dark, nothing stirred. She still felt eyes on her, though. It wasn’t hard for her to believe. It didn’t matter the time of day, people were always stalking Calla. Her mother told her it was because she was beautiful and would make an excellent Sky. Calla knew better. She’d learned it in school, after all. In a world full of people with flames, whether active or not, Calla had the most powerful Sky flames in existence. Even when she buried her flames deep inside her, they could not be hidden from others. The infamous ‘sky attraction’ was also extremely strong in Calla.</p><p>                <em>“I wish they would all just go away!”</em> She thought angrily as her mother led Calla into the store. Moving to a new town wasn’t unusual for the small two-person family, but Calla sensed something different about this move. Ever move her mother seemed to grow more tense, more worn out. Her mother’s skin seemed paper-thin, despite the woman’s young age. Though the only bags on the woman’s face were under her eyes, the hollows in the woman’s cheeks seemed combined with the bags made the woman look aged beyond her years. The brown eyes which once sparkled with her own active flames and passion for life had long since dulled. As they walked up the sloped hallway, her mother’s eyes shifted around. Spotting a group of boxes about midway up the hallway, Calla’s mother gently urged her daughter to hide behind the boxes.</p><p>                “I’ll draw them off. Once they’re gone, I’ll come back for you.” The woman promised. Calla looked up into her mothers’ eyes from where she crouched beneath a window, between the boxes and the wall.</p><p>                <em>“False.”</em> Her intuition whispered, and Calla swallowed dryly. A lump grew in her throat, but she nodded like a good girl. Her mother was the closest thing she had to a guardian, and her only family, after all. Calla knew she needed to be a good Sky, needed to think of her family first.</p><p>                “Okay.” Calla whispered numbly. She eased down until she was sitting with her knees drawn up to her chest.</p><p>                “Good girl.” Her mother whispered. The woman started to move away, hesitated, then reached over the box and down to ruffle Calla’s hair. “I love you.” The woman promised.</p><p>                “Love you.” Calla replied softly, tears clouding her eyes as her intuition whispered <em>“True”</em> to her. Then her mother was gone. She heard her mother’s footsteps continue quickly up the hallway. For a long time Calla waited for other footsteps to follow her mother’s, but none did. Finally, Calla risked a quick look around. No one was nearby. Calla crawled from behind the boxes and straightened. Carefully she brushed out her skirt and pushed the hair of her ponytail back over her shoulder. Then she set off up the rest of the hallway herself. Her mother may have gone, but Calla knew why they’d come to this out of the way trading post. There were only two reasons people came here. The first was because it was a major shipping center. Goods came in and most were shipped right back out. Some were kept and traded, though. The other was because this was a place people could get underworld jobs to complete, even if they weren’t a part of one of the major <em>Families</em>. It was also the place where the infamous Reborn took his jobs. If Calla’s luck held out, she might get the chance to meet the man. The man her mother called “Ren.” The man who owed her mother a favor. A favor that her mother told her was now Calla’s to call in. This was the only known place to contact the infamous hitman. Especially if you didn’t know him personally.</p><p>                Quietly Calla made her way to the job’s office. It had been hard for the two women to find out where the job office was, and Calla didn’t know how her mother finally did it. She wasn’t going to waste this opportunity. Stepping into the small room, Calla compressed her flames even smaller inside her. It was true she couldn’t entirely hide her flames, and the flame attraction was always hideously strong, but Calla <em>could</em> make herself seem much weaker than she actually was. Often it was the only thing that helped her avoid undue attention. Looking around the room, she was relieved to see it was only herself and an older man present. The room itself seemed to be a typical small office. There were cork boards with papers pinned to them, and a map hung up on the wall with pins in it. There was a metal desk in the middle of the room where the man sat, and a couple lining the walls filled with paperwork and filing cabinets beneath. Curiously, there was not a computer or security camera to be seen. The man himself was middle-aged and overweight. In fact, he had quite a bit of belly. The man also had very little hair, as he was mostly bald. What little hair he did have was close-cut. Not quite military or navy style, but short nonetheless.</p><p>                “<em>Safe</em>” Her intuition whispered. Calla relaxed slightly at her intuition’s reassurance.</p><p>                “Hello.” She whispered quietly to the man, who looked up at last. A slight blue light shimmered slightly in the man’s brown eyes as he first looked up, but faded after he saw Calla standing before him.</p><p>                “Hello. What can I do for you?” He asked, and seemed to sense she wasn’t a regular part of the underground. It probably wasn’t hard, Calla thought ruefully. Hardened criminals probably didn’t stand before his desk wringing their hands slightly and shifting nervously. With more willpower than she thought it should take, Calla forced herself to still.</p><p>                “Are you Berto?” She asked softly. The man smiled at her.</p><p>                “I am indeed, young lady.” He agreed.</p><p>                “I…I wish to leave a message with you. A…sort of a job?” She hesitated slightly over the wording. Calla had been banking on her mother to be the one holding this conversation. The man took out a small notepad and put his pen to the paper. “How…How much?” She wondered, biting her lip.</p><p>                “Depends on the message, the job, who takes it, that sort of thing.” He replied, still looking down at the paper.</p><p>                “The message…the job, it’s for Renato Sinclair.” She admitted quietly. The man looked up sharply, rain flames flaring until his eyes were pure blue.</p><p>                “Sinclair?!” He demanded quietly. A moments hesitation, then Calla nodded quickly.</p><p>                “Yes. Please tell him Lilly’s daughter has come to claim a favor. I…I suppose I’ll have to meet him here.” Calla added thoughtfully. The man nodded shortly, writing it quickly down and then tucking it into his shirt’s front pocket.</p><p>                “I’ll tell him. Sinclair won’t be here for at least a few days, though. Probably, anyways. You never can tell with that man.”</p><p>                “The price?” Calla asked again. The man shook his head and raised his hands in a placating way.</p><p>                “No charge. Not for Sinclair. He pays to have all his messages delivered. Do you need a room?” He asked gruffly. Again Calla hesitated. She’d never had to make these choices before. Pretty sad for an eighteen year old, but it couldn’t be helped.</p><p>                “I…I’m not sure. Can I book a different room every night? I don’t know how many nights I’ll need to be here, either…” despite her timid words, the man nodded easily.</p><p>                “Fairly standard request, really.” He reassured.</p><p>                “Just a room for tonight, then. Just in case. Oh, if I have to leave for some reason, I’ll leave a message to let him know where I’m going.” She added. Berto withdrew the note from his pocket and added a quick line before tucking it away again.</p><p>“You’ll need to pay in advance each night.” The man informed her. Calla wordlessly handed over her debit card. Then he picked up a phone and spoke into it quietly. A moment later a young man, who could be no older than fifteen, showed up and showed her to a room. Calla settled herself in quietly and prayed the man she waited for would come quickly. Prayed that she would be able to still be here when he did.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>                It was only three days later that Calla got a message from the young boy who helped out around the place. Sinclair should be there later that night. A sigh of relief escaped Calla as closed the door behind the boy. Every second she stayed in this place her intuition warned that trouble drew ever-closer. Calla knew several families were trying to track her down, not the least of which was probably her father’s. She also knew she couldn’t afford to let any of them catch her. Around lunch-time Calla finally ventured out to find food, shoving her flame down ruthlessly inside of herself. Her intuition warned her repeatedly not to go.</p><p>                <em>“Not safe, not safe, not safe.”</em> It chanted in her mind, giving her a headache. Since most of her life had been spent with the refrain drumming in her ears, Calla ignored her intuition. She’d not come out to eat for several days. For the time she’d been there, her Intuition had insisted the room was the safest place to be. Instead of going out for food, she’d used the cup in the bathroom and the water there to fill herself up. Other than when she changed rooms, of course. Every time she’d left the room, even if it was only to go down the hall to a new room, her heart hammered and she felt like danger squeezed in on her. So she’d followed her Intuitions guidance once more and stayed in. Now, though, she couldn’t afford to put off eating any longer. As loud as her intuition warned of danger, it also told her she needed to eat.</p><p>                “<em>I’ll probably need a lot of energy soon, then.</em>” Calla thought grimly as she sat down inside the little café attached to the depot and truck stop. Quietly Calla ordered something, though she couldn’t really remember what, her intuition was so loud and contradictory in her mind. The food was just as tasteless in her mouth as if she’d ordered cardboard or ash, so in the end Calla decided it probably didn’t matter what she’d ordered. As she was finishing her last hasty bite, Calla noticed a strange couple by the ordering counter. Though Calla could not have said what made them stand out to her, she felt the hair on the back of her neck rise. The waitress at the counter smiled cheerfully but didn’t seem to be giving the couple the answer they wanted. Carefully Calla stood, leaving a fifty on the table to cover her food and tip before sneaking silently behind the couple. As she passed them on the way to the door, Calla heard what they were saying.</p><p>                “…young lady, black hair and green eyes. She’s skinny and very shy. Our family is very worried she may have been kidnapped, you see…” the woman urged, leaning forward slightly towards the waitress in a confiding manor. The waitress smiled pleasantly at the other woman, but Calla thought the smile looked slightly fake and sharp.</p><p>                “I haven’t seen such a girl.” The waitress replied as the she looked up and met Calla’s eyes. “And even if I had, company policy would not allow me to say anything. You know that.” The waitress scolded the two. “Can I get you any food or drinks?” The waitress encouraged as the man snarled at her reply. Calla carefully slipped out the door behind the two. Silently Calla memorized their faces. Both were dark-skinned, looking almost Italian or Spanish.  The woman was about half a head shorter than the man. The woman wore a simple dress, with flowery print. The man wore a business suit, though it seemed more expensive than your average suit.</p><p>                <em>“Probably Italian.”</em> She decided as she moved through the hallways and into the storage room. It was looking to be a very long day before she could meet with Sinclair. Predictably, with the way Calla’s luck ran, it <em>was</em> a long day. It didn’t seem where Calla hid, the couple looking for her kept coming to the same places. Even outside. It was like they could sense just enough of her flames to tell she was in a room, but not exactly where. Calla quickly lost track of time as she moved from hiding place to hiding place. She’d tried hiding amongst the huge piling towers of boxes in the storage rooms, and even on top of the boxes. She tried hiding on, in, under, and around the big shipping trucks. One of the trucks almost left with her still underneath it! Thankfully it had gone out of the couple’s sight before it really sped up, and Calla was able to drop to the group and speed away before they saw her.</p><p>                She noted absently that the sky was dark now as she slipped back into the same upward inclining hallway from a few days ago. Calla turned her head and looked out a window just in time to see the couple spot her from nearby. Her heart started to beat frantically under her ribcage. The couple was only a few feet away from her, separated only by glass and a little bit of wall. Calla had seen Lightnings and Clouds go straight through concrete barriers to get at her before. Immediately she started to run. Of course the couple went right through the glass to get at her, the glass shattering and spraying into the hallway in all directions. Calla felt a piece of glass fly right past her ear and cheek as she ran. She could hear the heavy pounding of the man’s footsteps behind her, but not the woman’s. She prayed silently that the woman was also behind her, not moving ahead to cut her off. Calla wasn’t nearly stupid enough to look back and find out. She might not see something in front of her and trip up. The man reached out, and Calla felt his fingers just brush the back of her jacket. Her heart nearly burst from the terror and adrenaline right there.</p><p>                At the top of the hallway, she spotted a scowling man exiting the job office in the connecting hallway. The man wore the most expensive and stylish suit Calla had ever seen. Considering how many members of the underworld chased Calla on a regular basis, that was saying quite a lot. He also wore a fedora, with a thin band of bright Sun-yellow ribbon around it. A chameleon was perched upon his hat as well, and her heart swelled with sudden hope. She knew what the man looked like, after all. Lilly had described him a thousand times to Calla.</p><p>                “Sinclair!” She yelled in desperation, and the man looked up. Sharp black eyes took in the situation in a mere glance. Then the man was running forward, little more than a blur to onlooking eyes. Calla threw her arm towards Sinclair, desperately hoping he would make it to her before the man behind did. She was half right. Sinclair’s hand grabbed her just as the man behind Calla got ahold of her hoody. Yellow Sun flames flared all around Sinclair, his eyes turning glowing molten gold as emotion filled him when his flames met Calla’s own reaching amber Sky flames. Calla had never intended to reach with her flame, but her desperate will to escape being captured by the couple had her flames moving outside her control. Their flames met, both their eyes changing colors, and then everything exploded. Calla was thrown into the man she’d come to meet, and the man holding onto her jacket was flung all the way to the other end of the hall.</p><p>                Eyes still molten gold, Sinclair carefully moved Calla behind himself. He had a normal gun in one hand and his chameleon jumped into the other before transforming into another gun. Calla gripped the back of the man’s jacket suit, but readied herself in case she needed to let go. The man at the end of the hallway didn’t get up. The woman, however, showed up running down the connecting hallway Sinclair had just come from. Without even a pause of consideration, the hitman fired his normal gun at her. The woman went down, blood leaking from a spot on her forehead and the back of her skull splattered on the door behind her. Calla grimaced slightly but turned back to face his back.</p><p>                “Others?” He asked gruffly. Calla shook her head, then realized he couldn’t see her.</p><p>                “No.” Calla replied, then corrected herself carefully “Not that I know of, anyways. Not here.” At her words, the hitman carefully stored his normal gun. “I don’t know if they were in contact with anyone else about where I was, either.” She admitted ruefully. The hitman nodded sharply, drawing her to his side and wrapping an arm around her waist. For the first time since she was a toddler, Calla felt safe.</p><p>                “Come.” He demanded, walking back up the hallway. Silently Calla moved with him back into the mission office.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>                Though it was dark when Reborn got to the job desk, he was pleased with his timing. His last job, one for Tsunayoshi, was supposed to take a good week and he’d managed to take only four days. Of course the job was still properly done, but Reborn thought he deserved a reward. Maybe he’d take a break and go to Mafia Island? Then he entered the office, closing the door behind him, and Berto looked up at the familiar flame signature. The look in Berto’s eyes told Reborn something had come up while he’d been gone. It looked like Mafia Island would have to wait.</p><p>                “What happened?” Reborn demanded, leaving off the pleasantries.</p><p>                “Message.” Berto grunted, pulling a note from his pocket and handing it to the World’s Greatest Hitman. Reborn quickly scanned the note, mouth pulling into a frown. He’d rather thought the woman he owed this particular favor to had forgotten all about it. Or that she didn’t know where to go to let him know she wanted the favor repaid. This wasn’t just any favor, though. The woman was the first (and only) person who’d saved his life. Literally. Renato was a very young hitman, long before the curse, and had been bleeding out in an abandoned alley way. The young redheaded woman, then just a teenager although older than Renato himself, had appeared out of nowhere with a crack and stumbled over him. Without even asking any questions, the woman had carefully lifted Renato up and taken him to her apartment. There she’d dressed his wounds while Renato passed out and when he awoke once more it was to find his bullet and knife wounds completely healed.</p><p>               He’d told her he owed her a life-debt and she could call a favor from him whenever she wished. The woman hadn’t had a telephone, so he’d carefully told her of a place where she could leave a message for him. Unfortunately, Renato had to change his message center when he was cursed as an Arcobaleno and gave up the name Renato Sinclair for Reborn.  It seemed to woman, or at least her maybe-daughter, had still found a way to contact him.</p><p>               “The girl?” He demanded gruffly.</p><p>               “Looks to be about seventeen or eighteen. Timid. Definitely not mafia. Probably not even underground. Not sure how she even knew of this place. Looked a bit desperate, though. Was willing to stay here till you showed up. Mostly. Not sure what her problem is, but my guess is something’s chasing her. Wanted a different room every night. Hasn’t even come out to eat, other than changing rooms.” Berto listed quickly. The rain frowned. “Fairly certain there’s more to her than meets the eye, but didn’t want to scare her off by checking before you got a chance to meet the chit. Didn’t seem to have much in the way of flames. Could be active, but I couldn’t tell. If she is active, she’s learned how to hide her flames somewhat.” Berto admitted. “Beautiful little thing. Black hair, green eyes, light skin. Too skinny, no luggage that I could see. Not even a purse. Kept her card in her front skirt pocket.” The man added.</p><p><em>               “The girl probably had more luggage than you could see. If she’s anything like Lilly. The secretive woman.”</em> Renato thought, instantly memorizing the description. The green could have come from Lilly’s eyes. He’d know when he saw the girl, for that green was distinctive and Lilly had told him once it ran in the family. ‘Always the same shade,’ she’d told him.</p><p>               “What room?” He asked aloud.</p><p>               “Put her in the flame-blocking rooms, in case someone was looking for her. 205.” Berto grunted. Reborn nodded shortly and turned to go. He paused at the doorway.</p><p>               “Did you tell her the rooms would hide her flames?” He asked. Berto shifted slightly.</p><p>               “No. Not supposed to have that kind of tech in a random truck stop and shipping center, are we?” Berto pointed out. Reborn scowled and exited the room. He carefully controlled the impulse to slam the door behind himself. He had more class than that.</p><p><em>               “She could be anywhere here, if she didn’t know her room is the safest place…”</em> He grumbled silently in his mind.</p><p>               “Sinclair!” a girl’s voice shouted, and Reborn looked up immediately. Instantly he recognized the girl Berto described, as well as her plight. She was indeed being chased. By a rather large lightning, if he wasn’t mistaken. Reborn blurred into action, his mind crystallizing everything as his flames pumped through him. The girl’s face seemed etched into his mind, the desperation shining out of those familiar green gems caught at his heart. Suddenly she was all he could see. Well, all that mattered to him. In the moment Reborn didn’t have the time to realize what the feeling meant. What it meant that she had suddenly become the most important thing or person in the world to him. He concentrated on picking up every clue he could as he ran towards her, sun flames activating his muscles so he could go insane speeds. The pallor of her face suggested she’d been running, physically running, not figuratively, for quite some time. The man chasing the girl had almost caught her once already as she ran towards Reborn. Lilly’s daughter reached out for him as the man grabbed her hoody and started to pull. Immediately Reborn caught the girl’s hand to pull her away from the other man.</p><p>               The instant their skin met, Reborn’s flames flared wildly out of his control. He felt them flooding out of his body to meet the Sky flames flooding out of hers. The surprise on the girl’s face made it obvious she had no more control over her flames in that instant than Reborn himself did over his own. Then their flames touched, entwining intimately, and impossibly she became even more important to him.</p><p><strong><em>               “My Sky! Mine!</em></strong><em>”</em> His mind and flames declared happily as the bond settled into and between the two. The next instant Their flames burst outwards from them, throwing the man chasing <em>Reborn’s Sky</em> to the other end of the hallway. Reborn immediately drew his Sky behind him, the urge to protect singing in every cell and molecule of his body and flames. The other man didn’t get up, but Reborn wasn’t fooled. One solitary man did not scare Skies so easily. He cast his flames out quickly and detected another lightning coming from the direction of the office. Reborn barely even had to look at the woman, his flames pinpointed her so well, when he shot her. He winced slightly in his mind when the back of the woman’s head splattered against the wall behind her.</p><p>               “Others?” Reborn demanded, though he could not sense anyone else within a hundred feet. Well, no one besides them and Berto. Reborn stayed in position, doing one last sweep of their surroundings until she assured him there probably weren’t any other immediate threats. Then he could afford to turn his attention to her once more.</p><p><em>               “Definitely not mafia. Probably not even underground.”</em> Berto’s voice repeated in his mind. Dreading her rejection, Reborn turned to meet his Sky’s eyes. The girl had been looking at his back, but she turned her face up to him when he moved to face her. To his surprise and silent delight, the girl had no judgement in her eyes. Instead she seemed grateful and relieved. He carefully drew his Sky to his side, mindful of how skittish she probably was. Who knew how long she’d been on the run? How long had these people been chasing his Sky? Did they have allies? Were there others chasing her? He didn’t know, but Reborn intended to find everything out. First he had to get her to a safe location, though.</p><p>               “Come.” He ordered, unable to think of anything but the possible dangers around them. Lilly’s daughter (<strong><em>His Sky!</em></strong><em>)</em> Obediently stayed tucked against his side and walked with him towards the office and the hotel rooms. More specifically, towards his permanently rented room here. As they approached the office, he caught the girl (<em>he really needed to learn his Sky’s name</em>) glance once at the viscera that painted it. She grimaced, and his heart nearly stopped while he wondered if now was the time she would reject him as a killer, but the girl merely glanced away from the morbid decoration. He gently squeezed her waist and opened the door. Inside he felt slightly safer, but didn’t let his relief show.</p><p>               “Cleanup outside.” Reborn informed Berto flatly, who was immediately on his feet and talking into his phone. Reborn ignored the man and moved to the back of the office. Silently he maneuvered himself and his Sky around the desk and to the back wall. Reaching forward, he ignored the mist Illusion that told him only another stretch of filing cabinets stood before him. He reached right through the filing cabinet, grabbed a knob, and opened the hidden door there. Once they were safely on the other side, Reborn quickly marched them down the hallway and up two flights of stairs. At the end of the second flight of stairs he entered a doorway, steering his Sky inside before closing and locking it behind them. Finally feeling safe, he let his flames subside and turned to inspect his Sky.</p><p>               “Are you alright? Any injuries?” He asked, voice more gruff than he’d intended. He probably shouldn’t have bothered asking, though, because he’d automatically started scanning her with his flames anyways. The thought that she might have been injured in the flame explosion, or injured before he’d met her, made his eyes flare golden with his emotions once more.</p><p>               “I’m fine.” She answered softly, shyly as she blushed at the intrusion of his flames. He felt slightly embarrassed about filling her with his flames before they’d even been properly introduced, but she seemed to welcome his flames. And she made no verbal protest either. Finally he relaxed when he found only the exhaustion of a long work out. Well, that and hunger.</p><p>               “We are safe here, the room is specially designed to prevent others from sensing flames or people from outside.” Reborn promised, and the very last of the tension seemed to bleed from the girl.</p><p>               “Thank you!” She breathed. Reborn quickly strode into the apartment’s kitchen and the girl followed him, detouring only to take a seat at the bar separating the kitchen from the living room.</p><p>               “Always.” Reborn promised solemnly, meeting her eyes before he drew ingredients out of the fridge to begin making a meal that would help her replace all the energy she’d lost. Then he paused as another thought occurred to him. “Any allergies? Food, medicine, animals, seasonal?” He demanded. The girl blushed, looking down at the counter top.</p><p>               “Ah, just cats that I know of.” She answered shyly. Reborn nodded and began preparing a simple pesto chicken pasta with bread, cheese, and a side of mixed veggies.</p><p>               “Do you understand what happened?” He asked, eyes firmly on the pan he was frying chicken in to go with the pasta. He silently hoped she knew, that she could feel their bond. It was very likely that she could, though she may not understand what she felt. As Berto had guessed, the girl had more flames than she’d let on. Quite a lot more. Reborn was silently proud his Sky could hide any amount of her flames, there was such a huge quantity. She had more flames, and purer ones, than anyone he’d ever met. Including the various Arcobaleno Skies before half their flames were used up.</p><p>               “Ah, which part? I understand the couple chasing me here are dead now. I’m guessing this is your apartment…and…we…our flames…” The girl hesitated in answering, and a sort of worry squeezed Reborn’s heart when she paused. “Are you my guardian? I think we bonded, only, I’ve never had a Guardian before so I wasn’t sure….” She rushed the words out, and Reborn breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>               “Yes, I am now your Sun Guardian.” Reborn assured while he plated up the food. A kind of fierce pride filled him to know he was her <em>very first guardian</em>. He turned to place a plate before her and placed his in front of himself, opposite from her.</p><p>               “Thank you.” She murmured again, and Reborn knew she meant more than the food.</p><p>               “My pleasure.” He replied honestly, voice a dark purr. She quickly took a bite of his food, probably to distract herself from the blush spreading over her cheeks, and then made a noise of delighted surprise. A delicious smugness spread through Reborn as she seemed to delight in his food. He silently ate his own meal standing across the counter from her, watching as she demolished what was on her plate. When she’d finished, his Sky stood and took her plate to the sink. She began running the water and Reborn frowned as she started to wash up the plate and the things he’d used to make the meal.</p><p>               “You don’t need to clean up.” He grumbled as he brought his own plate to the sink and gently displaced her so he could do the dishes.</p><p>               “But you cooked.” She pointed out shyly, wringing her hands slightly. One side of Reborn’s mouth ticked up at the corner.</p><p>               “So, you know my birth name, but I should probably properly introduce myself. I go by Reborn these days, though as you know my first name was Renato Sinclair.” Reborn drawled to distract his Sky.</p><p>               “Ah, Calla Andromeda Potter-Black. Well, that’s my adopted name anyways. Mostly I just always go by Calla or Allie. Would you mind if I still call you Renato? Or Ren?” the girl replied quickly and meekly. The timidity of his Sky confused him. She was so powerful…why was his Calla so meek he wondered.</p><p>               “You, <em>My Sky</em>, may call me anything you wish.” He informed her smoothly, unable to help his voice dipping into a sort of smug and pleased tone. The girl blushed once more, hands twisting together.</p><p>               “Oh. Um, thank you.” Ignoring the mouse-like meekness for now, though he made a mental note he’d have to build up her confidence, Reborn set the clean dishes aside.</p><p>               “Living room?” He offered, and the girl nodded before following Reborn. Once in the living room, Calla sat on the couch while Reborn took an adjacent armchair. “Now that we’ve eaten and are in a safe place, tell me about the favor you wanted.” He ordered easily. The girl flushed.</p><p>               “Ah, my mother…she brought me here because she heard you train Skies to be strong, and you… you find strong guardians for them.” The girl admitted while wringing her hands in her lap. Reborn was unable to stop himself from reaching forward to her and slipping a hand between hers. He gently squeezed her hands. “It was the finding guardians I think she was most worried about.” The girl whispered while biting her lip. His Sky was going to be the death of him, he was sure.</p><p>               “What she was worried about? Then you did not wish to find guardians?” He prodded while that same unfamiliar dread squeezed his heart in its’ vice once more.</p><p>               “I’ve wanted guardians for a long time. Only…I almost had one once. I don’t…I don’t remember too much of what happened because I was so young at the time. He was a lightning, though. I remember that much. But he wasn’t strong enough. We talked about trying to bond one day, and the next he was dead. A rival lightning found out I’d chosen him…” Calla whispered, and Reborn felt both relief and anger on his Sky’s behalf. Relief that she did, in fact, want guardians. Anger for what she’d gone through. It seemed his Sky wasn’t done explaining yet, though, for she spoke again.</p><p>               “It’s my flames, you see. You probably already know this, but the stronger the Sky flames are, the stronger the Sky Attraction is. I can hide a lot of my flames, but the Sky Attraction cannot be lessened. There is literally nothing I can do to stop how much Sky Attraction I put out. I’d always hoped that once I got a full set, my flames wouldn’t feel the need to attract everyone so strongly. I haven’t lived in the same place for more than a handful of weeks at a time ever since that incident. I haven’t even been able to make friends because they all fight each other over me or we aren’t there long enough. That couple chasing me today? I met their eyes across a restaurant for about five seconds once. They’ve never stopped chasing me since. Mother left to draw them off while I gave Berto the message for you…but they came and she didn’t.” His Sky started crying silently as she spoke, tears dripping down her face. Reborn quickly relocated to sit next to her while pulling out a hanky. Gently he drew her to lean against him and dried her tears with his hanky.</p><p>               “What happens now?” She asked in a trembling voice. Reborn smiled down at the top of her head nestled against his shoulder.</p><p>               “Now we let you rest and recover from your ordeal as long as you need. Then we can start looking for the guardians you need. I have a few people in mind, and I promise you they are strong enough to protect both you and themselves.” Reborn assured, his fingers starting to draw patterns on her opposite shoulder without him realizing it. “Do you have pajamas, or shall I lend you a shirt?” changed the subject to something happier.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>               “I have my belongings with me. Mother said you know about magic?” At Reborn’s affirmative sound, Calla pulled a necklace out from beneath her hoodie. On it hung what looked like a tiny trunk. Reborn stood and gently pulled Calla to her feet. He directed Calla to his former guest bedroom (It was hers forever, now. At least in Reborn’s mind), and Calla detached the charm from her necklace. She held the charm out in the air in front of her, and tapped it with the pointer finger on her left hand. The trunk started to grow until a standing closet stood before her. Reborn watched as she gently unlatched the lock on the left side of the trunk and pulled the “lid”(which looked more like a door now) to the right side. The inside of the trunk was enlarged, and it looked like another room inside.</p><p>               There were even a couple doors branching off the main room. The first room had everything Calla needed, though. The left side of the room looked very much like a walk-in closet, and included a couple dressers, a set of dressing room mirrors, and a vanity. Calla crossed the room to a set of drawers and withdrew a simple pair of pink flannel pajamas. Then she grabbed a basket off the top of the dresser which contained her toiletries.  She turned to face Renato.</p><p>               “Bathroom?” She asked shyly but brightly.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p>
