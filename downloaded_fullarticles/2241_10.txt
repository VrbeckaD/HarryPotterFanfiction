    <p>Percy had always been the ugly duckling of his family. There were Bill and Charlie the two older brothers who had made their parents proud, the twins who were so funny and mischievous that it was impossible not to love them, Ron who was the great Harry Potter's best friend and of course Ginny, the younger sister that everyone cherished. And then there was Percy, the one who was always put aside, forgotten. He was his grandparents' least favorite grandchild; family friends would always forget to send him an invitation to their party, pretending that it was a mistake. But deep down everyone knew that it was an excuse not to let him in because he was the killjoy, the boring law-abiding one. </p>
<p>So the least Percy could do was to do his best in every possible field. He didn't have the spark of creativity which made the Weasley family so unique, so to compensate, he had to be perfect in every way possible. This involved spending his entire holidays working alone in his room, whole nights awake bent on a book, long weekends spent looking after the Gryffindor kids. But no one ever seemed to notice him, to get how hard it was for him to keep up with everyone's expectations, after all, who was he compared to his awesome siblings? </p>
<p>Percy had decided that to be at his best, he had to completely forget himself, to dedicate himself to work, neglecting his personal life. At some point, everyone at Hogwarts thought that he slept in the library, but it would have implied that he slept; which was highly unlikely. </p>
<p>It was how things worked until something very odd happened: someone noticed him. And this someone wasn't anyone, it was Oliver Wood, the captain of the Quidditch team, the handsome Keeper that everyone liked, pretty much the opposite of the Prefect. One day Percy was skipping lunch, working in the library when Oliver came to sit right next to him and started staring at him. Percy stiffened but didn't look back, with all these years spent alone he had learned how mean people can be when they decided to make fun of you, and the Quidditch player coming near him was obviously part of a joke. But when he spoke, it was with a very soft tone:</p>
<p>“Hey, Percy isn't it?”</p>
<p>Of course it was his name. Oliver had known it for years but had never dared to come to talk to him, his friends would always make fun of him when he looked at the redhead for too long, until this day. It was a few days ago. The Prefect had punished one of his friends who had pushed around a first year for having “looked at him in a wrong way” by giving him a detention. His friend didn't appreciate it and decided to retaliate; he locked himself with Percy in an empty room and beat the shit out of him, he knew all the right places to hit without leaving too many marks. Of course, the Head Boy never reported this; it would have been proof that he was weak. This day Oliver decided that these guys were no longer his friends. In addition to this, with the exams coming Percy had spent even more time working and seemed paler every day, coughing and sneezing all day long. So he finally made the decision to man up and go talk to him. </p>
<p>The younger boy finally looked back at him but didn't answer.</p>
<p>“I saw you were alone, so I took the chance to come to talk to you,”</p>
<p>Of course he was alone, Percy was always alone.</p>
<p>“I wanted to apologize for my ex-friends behavior, they are complete morons.”</p>
<p>“Ex-friends?”</p>
<p>“Yep, I decided that I didn't belong with people who use violence to solve all their problems.”</p>
<p>Percy didn't want to keep up with this conversation but despite his best intentions to hide it, he was and would always be compassionate.</p>
<p>“You shouldn't let your friends go because of me; I'm not worth it, I don't want you to be alone because of me...”</p>
<p>Oliver couldn't help but smile, the ginger boy was so sweet, it was a shame he was always hiding it behind an armor of uprightness. Oliver felt true empathy towards him.</p>
<p>“I'm not alone”, but he didn't let time to the other boy to answer it and kept talking, “besides, I also wanted to make sure that you were ok. You look pale, you cough and you seem weak, look you're shaking!”</p>
<p>Indeed, Percy was shaking, and even if Oliver was right about his symptoms, it wasn't because of it. Percy hadn't even noticed his condition; he was too absorbed in his work; this might have been going on for days without him knowing. But it didn't matter, because Oliver had somehow implied that he was weak, that he couldn't care for himself and that he NEEDED someone to tell him what to do and how to look after himself. He wasn't a child. He wasn't a baby and he wasn't going to let some stupid quidditch star take him down. He knew his anger wasn't justified; he knew Oliver was only trying to be nice, but he didn't need his pity. He gathered his books quickly and left without a word, letting Oliver puzzled. He had obviously underestimated Percy's pride.</p>
