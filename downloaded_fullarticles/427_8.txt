          <div class="userstuff"><p>Azkaban was hell.</p><p> </p><p>It was always dark and cold. Eerie quietness would echo through the confinement if it weren’t for the fact that distant screams could always be heard. One meal daily, a stale, crusted piece of bread with butter and scraps of meat. With any luck, they would have access to water twice a day. The prisoner's hygiene wasn’t usually considered a high priority to the guards, it was rare that the option of being able to wash was available to the convicts, and when it was the water was like ice, causing many of the inmates to by-pass the opportunity. Not to mention the dementors; the foul, soul-sucking creatures occupied the hallways, happiness and hope draining from every person, minds filling with haunting memories from the past. Both the physical and mental health of the prisoners would be neglected. Some people would die in their cells, whether it was self-inflicted or from lack of nutrition, no one would discover them for weeks at a time.</p><p> </p><p>Being in the horrid prison for a day could come close to driving a person insane. What would fifteen years do?</p><p> </p><p>After escaping the filthy penitentiary that was Azkaban, Bellatrix had been fortunate enough to have her sister to go to. Narcissa was able to help take care of any immediate health concerns and ailments that her sister may have. The dark witch's health was still poor and her immune system weak, however, because of the growing war, there wasn’t time to focus on the smaller illnesses that she was plagued with.</p><p> </p><p>Even if her sister had treated some physical problems, there were still the mental ones. The memories would always remain etched in her mind, the memories of her childhood, of Azkaban, and the war. The more she thought about her past the more she became aware of her actions. Normally they wouldn’t bother Bellatrix, but for some reason now they did.</p><p> </p><p>When the war ended, Kingsley was appointed the Minister of Magic. After the damage from the war had been cleaned up, the government was reformed and one of his first actions as Minister was to have Azkaban destroyed. Some prisoners were moved to the new prison that had been built, while others were chosen to participate in an experiment the Ministry was conducting where former criminals would have the chance at a normal life. They would be placed under house-arrest for up to ten years and would have restrictions on magic. Some would have to see soul-healers as a part of the contract. After the house-arrest was completed, the witch or wizard would be assigned a job at the Ministry, the chosen person would then still have their freedom while being monitored by the government. Among the group of people, surprisingly Bellatrix Black had been chosen.</p><p> </p><p>When she had finished her time she had been placed in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement as an assistant. That’s where she met Hermione Granger.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Saying sorry, admitting to her mistakes, trying to start anew; they hadn’t been easy feats to accomplish, but with time somehow she found herself saying the words. What surprised the witch the most was when she was forgiven by the brunette. Even after everything she had done; tortured her and many others, killed countless amounts of people, fought against her and discriminated against muggle-borns her whole life. When asked for an explanation as to why Hermione didn’t hold a grudge the woman had simply said that everyone deserves a second chance and that Bella had faced her consequences and was now trying to change her ways. The answer hadn’t made sense to the pure-blood and still didn’t. Especially since the very person who had forgiven her now lay in her arms peacefully sleeping.</p><p> </p><p>Their bodies pressed close to each other, fitting perfectly together like two puzzle pieces. Fingers danced up and down Hermione’s spine, causing her to stir lightly. The room was quiet, the only sound being the hushed breathing of the two women. Despite it being morning it was almost completely dark, the only source illuminating the room was a sliver of light that shone in through the curtains as the sun started to rise. While Bellatrix embraced the younger woman, memories from the previous night played over in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Soft caresses, roaming hands, rushed movements. Clothes were discarded and thrown to the floor. Their bodies pressed close as they shared a heated kiss; a plush mattress encasing her as she fell backward onto a queen-sized bed.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Bellatrix was roused from her thoughts as the woman in her arms shifted and her eyes fluttered open. A smile grew on her face seeing Hermione. The girl was the epitome of perfection. Her golden-brown locks framed her face, long curled eyelashes made her honey-brown eyes stand-out and her lips were colored rose-pink. She was the most beautiful person Bellatrix had ever seen. Intelligence beyond imaginable and kind to everyone around her, Bella couldn’t ask for someone better.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning.” Hermione’s groggy voice made her smile grow wider; she was only more adorable when tired.</p><p> </p><p>“Morning. It seems like you slept well.” </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm, I most definitely did. I think it’s been the best sleep I’ve had in a while.” The brunette shifted so that she sat upright facing Bella. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that so?” Bellatrix smirked before leaning forward and meeting Hermione’s lips in a chaste kiss. She hesitated before continuing, “What now?” </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“I love you. I’ve never told that to anyone before, but I’m glad I’m saying it to you. I love you Hermione, more than I’ve ever loved or cared for someone before. Even though my past isn’t what many people would like, you still accept me. You forgave me, something I never thought anyone would do. You are kinder to me than anyone has ever been and I am so grateful to have you in my life.” It had taken all of her courage to say what she did.</p><p> </p><p>Fear coursed through Bellatrix’s body. Would Hermione respond poorly? If at all? She shouldn’t have done this. It would be like every other time she had been vulnerable; she’d be hurt in the end.<br/><br/></p><p>But that’s not what happened. When the Slytherin looked up she found tears forming in her lover’s eyes. Two hands came out and held her face between them, stroking her cheeks gently as she did so.</p><p> </p><p>“Bellatrix Black, I love you too. With every molecule in my body. I don’t care that you made mistakes before. All I care about now is the current you. You have cared for me in ways that I thought no one would before.” Hermione leaned forward, moving her hands to the base of Bella’s neck before meeting her lips in a slow kiss.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“What is this called again?” </p><p> </p><p>“It’s a film. Similar to pictures in the wizarding world except they’re for entertainment purposes and can have sound included in them. People called ‘actors’ act out a story and pretend to be someone. It’s their job.” Hermione had answered the same question many times already from Bellatrix. Even though she was a pure-blood Hermione didn’t think it would take <em> this </em> long to explain movies and television to her. </p><p> </p><p>“Hmm. This better not be a waste of time. We could be doing a lot <em> better </em> things right now.” Bellatrix smirked at the blush that formed on Hermione’s face when the younger woman realized what she had been insinuating. </p><p> </p><p>“Hush. I promise you’ll like it. Now this movie is drawn by people and the actor's voice reading the script is added in. It’s called animation.”</p><p> </p><p>As the movie started playing the two witches went quiet. Hermione leaned her head on Bella’s shoulder, letting her girlfriend wrap her arm around her; holding her close.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed Bellatrix was quite enjoying the film as she focused entirely on the screen for the duration of it. Hermione, however, didn’t seem to care for watching it at that moment as she had fallen asleep halfway through the movie. When she had awoken it was only to see the final credits rolling and Bellatrix looking in awe at the screen.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The screams rang in her mind. The hollow feeling. The cold and darkness. How had everything gone from being okay to complete shit? It felt as if she was stuck in place, held down by heavy chains. She tried to move, to get away but she couldn’t, at least not until she was woken. </p><p> </p><p>Sweat rolled in beads down her forehead, her breaths short and in quick bursts. The room was pitch black, which only increased her fear. Where was she anyway? Bellatrix’s mind went blank, and panic spread through her body. It took a few moments before Hermione’s soft voice reached her ears, attempting to calm the frightened woman. </p><p> </p><p>The calming voice soon made it through to her. When her breathing evened out, arms gently wrapped around her and pulled her close to their body. A kiss was placed to her head and imaginary circles were being drawn on her back, helping to sooth Bellatrix.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay. You’re safe Bella. They can’t hurt you anymore. I wouldn’t let them.” The words caused a sob to be released from the witch as she clutched tighter to Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I can’t. The memories, they hurt too much. I wish that I wasn’t here. I wish I didn’t have to deal with them. That Azkaban had just taken me away from this fucking world.” </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t wish that Bella. I know you don’t. You’re starting to get better. I know the dreams still happen but the healer is helping with that a bit. You will make it past this. Cissa and Andy will help you along the way, and I will too. We will always be here to support you. Just please don’t wish death upon yourself, you have so much to live for.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Everything seemed to go in slow motion. At first, the question had hung in the air, Hermione taking it in, but after a moment she had burst into joyous tears. Quickly she agreed and admired the diamond as it shone in the light. </p><p> </p><p>And now here they stood. A bright day upon them as they stood with their hands interlocked. </p><p> </p><p>“I do.” </p><p> </p><p>The final step before they would be together for life. The last few seconds of their old lives, but they weren’t sad to see it go, rather excited for the next chapter in the book of life. </p><p> </p><p>Red lips against rose. Quick but meaningful. The moment imprinted on them forever. When they broke apart Hermione smiled slightly, meeting Bellatrix’s gleaming eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“They’re all looking at you.” A hushed whisper meant only for the older woman to hear.</p><p> </p><p>“No, they’re looking at you.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Bella…can you come here a moment?” Hermione’s tone wasn’t panicked, but nor was it calm, a mix between the two perhaps? Or Unsettled? The difference in her voice caused Bellatrix to - as always - assume the worst and rush to her wife’s side. </p><p> </p><p>“What is it pet? Is everything okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Upon entering the room it was quickly noticed that the young witch wasn’t in danger or harmed, she did, however, have tears in her eyes, whether from joy or pain, Bellatrix didn’t know.</p><p> </p><p>“Everything is more than okay. Look.” She held out a small stick for her wife to see.</p><p> </p><p>A pregnancy test. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, wait. Holy shit, Hermione is it...are you?” A quick nod was the answer to her unfinished question.</p><p> </p><p>“It worked. I wasn’t sure it would, but magic can do amazing things.” Bellatrix and Hermione had spent weeks trying to find a way for them to conceive, and when they had found it the chances of it working were low. </p><p> </p><p>Tears formed at the corners of her eyes, a rare occurrence for the older woman. Hermione couldn’t help but rush towards Bella, wrapping her arms around her in a tight embrace.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you so fucking much, Bellatrix Black-Granger.”</p><p> </p><p>---</p><p> </p><p>The small body had been sleeping peacefully, only stirring when a noise sounded in the distance. Curious eyes glanced up at the two witches, watching as they smiled down at her. She had pale skin and a few raven curls atop her head, however, her eyes stood out the most. They were hazel brown, identical to the brunette’s. A perfect reflection of both Hemione and Bellatrix.</p><p> </p><p>“Welcome into the world, Cassie”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>One of them was the dark, and one the light. Together they worked because you can’t have one without the other. They had been a perfect pair, always challenging their partner with every passing day, yet pushing each to do their best. The two lived off of each other. Without one the other was only just. So they stayed, and it worked.</p><p> </p><p>But now only one of them remained.</p><p> </p><p>Roses had always been Hermione’s favorite flower. Their soft petals, varying color, and fierce yet delicate body. She’d always said that Bellatrix had been her rose. A bold and strong exterior but alluring sense. </p><p> </p><p>So that’s what laid there now; roses. On the cold stone, they rested under her name. Dew sat in drops on the flower, drying in the sun after the rain that had passed.</p><p> </p><p>Now only she remained; Bellatrix. And the two young girls. </p><p> </p><p>Under any other circumstances, she would have allowed herself to fall apart, but now she had to be here for Cassie and Delphi. She had to stay strong for them, be a leader. Be both the dark and light in their lives.</p><p> </p><p>Because now there wasn’t a difference between them. It was only grey, and that would have to make-do.</p></div>
