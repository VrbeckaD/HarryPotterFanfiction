    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Harry Potter has developed the unfortunate habit of needing coffee before he can start functioning during the day. The fault lies mostly with his newly finished Auror training. When he began, he had noticed the high rate his colleagues went through the provided supply. He hadn't thought that after only two weeks, he too would be part of the caffeine addicts.</p>
<p>Now that he isn't out on various training missions every day, he decides to find some better coffee. The first cafe he tries is right across the street of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. It's dreadful. Harry does not return there.</p>
<p>The second one is more passable, and for a while, he continues to get his coffee there. But eventually, the cost stops justifying the mediocre coffee.</p>
<p>Third times the charm, right? <em>Nope</em>. Let's move on.</p>
<p>Finally,<em> finally</em>, he finds what he is searching for. The coffee shop is tucked neatly in a corner a few streets away from the busy ones near his office. It's called Crow's Nest, and Harry soon finds out why.<br/>
As he enters for the first time, a young woman stands behind the counter and only hesitates for a moment before she greets him with a smile. "Welcome to Crow's Nest! What can I get you today?"</p>
<p>The place is small; Pictures and paintings hang on one of the walls. One wall is painted a warm orange; The other walls sport a creamy white. Different pillows and fabrics cover the furniture. It feels homey.</p>
<p>"One coffee with milk, please." The woman, her name tag reads Carla, nods. "No sugar?" When he shakes his head, she turns around: "Coming right up! You can sit down if you want, I'll bring it to you."<br/>
"Thank you."</p>
<p>He takes a seat at the window and looks out at the street. It's still early, and only a few poor souls are up and out already. With slight amusement, he realises that he's one of them. And so is Carla who is now walking towards his table. "Here you go." She sets the cup down in front of him. "Enjoy!"</p>
<p>The coffee is delicious. Harry returns the next day.<br/>
And the one after that.</p>
<p>This morning Carla isn't alone. "Good morning!" She greets him with her usual smile, though it does seem a bit more honest than the first time. Gesturing to the person next to her, she adds: "This is Crow. They're the owner."</p>
<p>Crow gives him a wave and a toothy smile. "Hi there. Carla told me that she finally has some company in the morning. Had to see it myself."<br/>
Harry wonders if Crow is their actual name or if it is a nickname based on the beak-like nose and the black hair.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter, he figures. Crow seems friendly, and Carla seems comfortable around them, that's always a good sign. Besides, the coffee still tastes fantastic.</p>
<p>He visits the Crow's Nest almost every morning after that. Soon the "What can I get you today?" changes to "The usual?" It's nice, being treated like just another customer. Sometimes Crow is there, but most of the time it's just Harry and Carla. He learns that she is currently finishing her studies and hopes to get a job in the ministry. Harry genuinely wishes for her to get what she wants.</p>
<p>"You know," Carla says one day after setting down his coffee, "I sometimes wonder, what Crow does when they're not here. They never talk about their private life." She thinks for a moment and then adds hurriedly: "Not that they have to, of course! I'm just curious is all. At my last job, my boss always talked about himself. Or his last or next vacation, or how much he hates his wife, and all that. I'm so glad I no longer work there."<br/>
Harry smiles at her. He usually doesn't say much, but it's comfortable like that. Carla likes to fill the silence, and he enjoys to sit back and listen.</p>
<p>"Anyway, have you had time to listen to the bands I recommended?"<br/>
Well, sometimes she does manage to engage him: "One of them, yeah. Ashley Hamel, I think?" Carla nods. "I like her. It's not the kind of music I usually listen to, but you were right. She's pretty good."<br/>
Carla claps her hands together: "That's great! I'm so happy to hear that! You'll like the others, too then. I'm sure of it!"</p>
<p>Eventually, Harry starts visiting the shop in the afternoon as well. That's Crow's shift. There are more people there than the zero, plus Harry, in the morning. Still, the relative obscurity helps in keeping it from being crowded. Crow makes an effort to exchange a few words with every customer, but it's nowhere near Harry's conversations with Carla. He's not mad about it.</p>
<p>One day he catches Crow sighing behind the counter. He knows, it isn't his business, but that has never stopped Harry before. "Everything alright?"<br/>
Crow looks up and immediately smiles again. "Yeah, yeah, of course. Just a bit stressed about finding a new employee."<br/>
"You're hiring?" Harry asks, despite that being obvious now.<br/>
Crow looks at him, confused for a second. "Yeah, hasn't Carla told you? She finally got that job she's been after. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for her, but she's a damn good employee, and I wish I didn't have to find someone else."</p>
<p>Harry is stunned. No, Carla hadn't told him, but he understands now, why she had been so fidgety lately.<br/>
Crow either doesn't notice or chooses to ignore Harry's reaction. "Not that I expect it, but you don't happen to be interested in working here?" Harry tries to cover his unexpected laughter with a cough. "No, sorry. Besides, what makes you think I know anything about coffee, considering that I pay you to make it for me daily?"<br/>
Crow just shrugs. "Don't need to know anything, that's what training's for. Just thought, I'd ask."<br/>
"How many of your customers did you ask today already?"<br/>
Crow mumbles something. Harry won't let them off the hook, though: "Sorry, what was that?"<br/>
They cough and then answer sheepishly: "Five or six, maybe?"<br/>
Harry snorts. Of course.</p>
<p>Carla does finally tell him the next morning. He congratulates her honestly. Still, he's going to miss her company in the early mornings before work.<br/>
She pats him on the back. "Don't worry; I'm sure my successor is gonna be just as awesome as me." She pauses. "Well, maybe a little bit less awesome, I'll know for sure, once I meet him."<br/>
"Did Crow already find someone?"<br/>
"Yeah, came in for an interview yesterday evening. Crow's been stressing about that the whole week; Hired him on the spot though. I can't wait to meet him. I mean, I'll be training him for a week, so I'm sure we'll get to know each other pretty fast. And he'll be taking my shift, so you'll meet him soon enough."</p>
<p>Harry doubts he'll get along with the new guy as well as he does with Carla, but he's willing to give him a chance.<br/>
That conviction holds until he returns to the coffee shop the next Monday.</p>
