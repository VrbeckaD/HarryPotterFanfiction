          <div class="userstuff"><p class="npf_chat">Tonks watched Remus with a small smirk. She saw him watching Sirius Black. And finally she just had to speak up and say something. </p><p class="npf_chat">"He’s still handsome, isn’t he? After all those years in Azkaban."</p><p class="npf_chat">Handsome might not be the immediate word she'd use. His face was gaunt and his eyes were a lot more distrustful and scared than she was used to seeing on her older cousin. His dark hair looked brittle, and while he had always had facial hair since around his sixth year at Hogwarts, now his chin and neck were patchy and scratchy. But...it was still him. And he broke the hearts of those who loved him. </p><p class="npf_chat">Remus glanced at her. "I suppose you have fallen in love with him, then?"</p><p class="npf_chat">Uh...he was her cousin, wait a moment. </p><p class="npf_chat">He turned back to look at him then. "...well, get in line, ma'am."</p><p class="npf_chat">Tonks smiled more to herself now. "I knew it."</p><p> </p></div>
