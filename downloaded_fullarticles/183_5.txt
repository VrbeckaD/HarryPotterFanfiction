    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>            There is a thing to be said about magic, and that is that although it is a wonderfully extraordinary thing, it is often extraordinarily unpleasant. For example, starting your day as, say, a nineteen year old boy late to a college class in 2017 Arizona, and ending it as a one year old boy on a doorstep in 1981 England.</p><p>            It took me a while to figure out where I was, of course, but when Petunia Dursley opened the door and looked at me, I realized approximately what had happened. Somehow, I’d ended up as Harry Potter.</p><p>            That wasn’t so bad, I supposed. I could make some changes. I was familiar with how the story went; from the recognizable faces around me, it appeared to be the movie-verse, which was convenient. And I’d read enough fan-fiction to think I was prepared.</p><p>            …I wasn’t.</p><p>            No one tells you how excruciating it is to live as a child. They moan and bewail the curse of babyhood, but truth be told, babies have the memory retention of, well, babies, and my conscience may be imparted upon this toddler brain, but the fleshy bits don’t do what I want them to. So I slept through all the boring parts.</p><p>            That was where I noticed the first change. In the books, the abuse Harry (me) received was never described completely, but it was implied that it began rather early: about four years old. So I grew, apprehensively waiting for the day I would officially begin my life as a glorified slave.</p><p>            And it didn’t happen. And I thought maybe I’d gotten lucky, and my life would be alright.</p><p>            And then school started.</p><p>            And it was terrible.</p><p>            You know that feeling you get when the teacher spends a week reviewing basics and you already know everything? Imagine being surrounded by six year olds still learning to read. Being taught that two plus two is four…and knowing that you have five more years of this. Needless to say, I was frustrated.</p><p>            It’s not to say that the teachers didn’t try to move me ahead grades. They talked to Petunia and Vernon repeatedly. But Vernon refused to let them move me, pointing out that Dudley had the same education I had, and surely they must want to move him too. The teacher patiently explained that I was a ‘special case’ and that moving Duddlekins could ‘gravely impair his intellectual growth by overwhelming him too early.’ I wanted to point out that Duddlekins’ intellectual growth had been impaired the moment he’d been born to these parents, but I refrained.</p><p>            So a year dragged by. Rather than an abrupt switch to slavedom, I was slowly given more and more household chores. I weeded the garden. I painted the fence. I cleaned the house with Petunia. I took up the cooking – much to my dismay.</p><p>            I didn’t mind the work, really, but it started getting inconvenient. I needed time to plot. So one afternoon, with Dudley down the street playing with the Peckers boy and Vernon at his drill mine (or wherever he worked), I approached Petunia.</p><p>            “Aunt Petunia,” I began in what I hoped was a patient and reasonable tone of voice (it’s hard to peg these things when you’re the stunted conscience of a twenty-six year old inside a seven year olds body).</p><p>            She didn’t look up from her tabloids, where she was no doubt trying to catch up to with all the celebrity gossip. “What do you want, boy?”</p><p>            “I was wondering if you and I could make a deal?”</p><p>            She shot me a look that could have meant either ‘I’m listening’ or ‘I don’t make deals with devil spawn’. I assumed it was the first, and continued. “See, I’m not getting the education I need from school, so I was wondering if after I’m finished with my chores each day, I could go to the library until dinnertime.”</p><p>            She frowned. “And what are you offering in return?”</p><p>            “Oh, well,” I shrugged, “I won’t tell my teachers that you keep me in a cupboard for one. And I’ll try to keep the… freaky business to a minimum.”</p><p>            Petunia’s face paled dramatically. For a moment, she looked like she was going to ask me something, then she pressed her lips harshly together. “Fine.” She forced out. “After you’re done with your chores you may go to the library. But don’t be late for dinner, and don’t do anything peculiar.” This last word was whispered with the venom of a lifetime of hatred and for a moment I almost didn’t pity her and her sad life.</p><p>            I grinned and made a show of skipping out the door, waving merrily as I went, and disappeared down the lane. I had some things to learn.</p><p>            Namely, hoarding any information I knew I wouldn’t be able to get at Hogwarts: Science, Biology, Advanced Mathematics, ‘Muggle’ History, Geography. Anything I could get my hands on and cram into my woefully underdeveloped seven-year-old brain.</p><p>            At the library, I wandered to the non-fiction section and found a few books on advanced mathematics. The librarian gave me a few strange looks, and I ignored her. She didn’t have to spend eight mind-numbing hours being force-fed the principals of basic multiplication.</p><p>            Unfortunately, advanced math’s were not something my seven-year-old flesh-brain wanted to concentrate on, and after a few hours I gave up and went home. It would be there again tomorrow, waiting to mock me.</p><p align="center">^^^^^^^^^^</p><p>            A year passed.</p><p>            I learned how to plot trajectories and graph in three dimensions and other things that I probably wouldn’t have learned in college. I memorized chemical equations and the parts of complex cells and started learning some Latin. The librarian got used to me.</p><p>            “What makes a young lad like you so inclined to spend your summers in the library?” She asked me once.</p><p>            I shrugged and copied down a mammal classification key into one of my pilfered notebooks. “Sunlight is overrated.”</p><p>            She raised an eyebrow and said nothing else.</p><p>            It wasn’t until I was nine that she finally asked about my parents.</p><p>            “They’re dead.” I told her bluntly. Children were forgiven tactlessness, right? “I live with my aunt and uncle.”</p><p>            She frowned softly, a look of maternal concern in her eyes. “And they treat you alright?” She prompted.</p><p>            “They treat me as well they’re able.” I told her. And it was true; they treated me as well as they were able, considering their hearts were shriveled pieces of compassionless coal with moral compasses so broken they locked toddlers in closets for the crime of being hungry enough to cry. But I didn’t hold it against them, honest.</p><p>            My answer, all the untold truth of it, seemed to placate the librarian and she didn’t ask me about my family again. And I was happy for it.</p><p align="center">^^^^^^^^^^</p><p>            The next major landmark in my life was one I was reasonably familiar with: Duddlekin’s eleventh birthday.</p><p>            I woke up the same way I often did, with Petunia knocking loudly on my cupboard door.</p><p>            “Get up and cook breakfast, boy.” She told me through the door, her shrill voice stabbing into my sleep-fogged head like a piccolo funeral dirge being played by the personification of a hangover.</p><p>            I got up and wandered into the kitchen, still sleepy.</p><p>            “Don’t burn the bacon, I want everything to be perfect for Dudley’s special day.” She ordered me.</p><p>            Dudley’s special day. Dudley’s birthday, I realized with a jolt of adrenaline. I tossed bacon into a pan and began frying it. That was today, was it? I wondered if I’d still get to go to the zoo with them.</p><p>            Oh boy, the zoo.</p><p>            I hated zoos. At least there was the possibility of a snake.</p><p>            I’d talked to a few garden snakes while weeding, but most of them didn’t have anything particularly interesting to say. It mostly went the same.</p><p>            :Speaker! Speaker! Hello Speaker:</p><p>            :Hello little snake, do you have a name?:</p><p>            :Does the Speaker want a juicy rat? I have many juicy rats!:</p><p>            :No thank you. I’d like to know your name.:</p><p>            :I like juicy rats. The Speaker does not like juicy rats?:</p><p>            :No, the Speaker doesn’t eat rats. What’s your name, little one?:</p><p>            :I don’t have a name. Goodbye, Speaker. May we meet again in the rat-filled Paradise beyond the second sleep.:</p><p>            Apparently snakes were religious. Who would have thought.</p><p>            “The bacon, boy!” Petunia’s shriek cut through my musings, and I quickly lifted the pan off the heat. I inspected its contents. The bacon was a bit singed, but it would be fine.</p><p>            “It’s not burnt,” I called back to her.</p><p>            I could feel her disapproval radiating from the living-room and I ignored it. It was a superpower I’d developed over the years.</p><p>            The table was covered with all Dudley’s presents, and I idly wondered how many of them were from Aunt Marge the Barge. It was no secret Vernon’s job was middle-class at best. He couldn’t exactly afford what looked like a new computer, a second television set, and a racing bike.</p><p>            I was frying the eggs by the time Duddlekins made his way downstairs. He grunted at me by way of greeting and immediately sat at the table to count his hoard.</p><p>            I was surprised he knew how to count, honestly, but I refrained from making my observation.</p><p>            “Thirty six,” Dudley said. He sounded horribly disappointed. “That’s two less than I got last year.”</p><p>            “Sweetie, you haven’t counted this one from Uncle Vick, right here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.” Petunia lifted the present from its hiding spot with an encouraging smile.</p><p>            “Alright, thirty seven then.” Dudley muttered.</p><p>            “What’s all this, my boy? Not happy with your haul are you, you little tyke?” Vernon chuckled as he walked in. He ruffled Duddlekin’s hair. “That’s my boy, always wanting the best.”</p><p>            How anyone could sound so proud of what was basically a semi-sentient pile of lard escaped me.</p><p>            “You haven’t counted my present either,” I told Dudley as I set the food on the table.</p><p>            He eyed me suspiciously. “You got me a present?”</p><p>            Petunia and Vernon also gave me suspicious looks. I wasn’t sure whether or not to feel offended. “Yep.” I told Dudley. “It’s in my cupboard, let me go get it.”</p><p>            I headed to my cupboard. I actually did have a present for him, though I doubted he’d appreciate it. In my defense, I was still trying tentatively to befriend him. It wasn’t going well, but I did my best.</p><p>            I grabbed the shoddily wrapped package from where it was sitting on my shelf and headed back to the table.</p><p>            In the minute I was gone, Dudley had eaten all the bacon. I wasn’t all that surprised. I handed him my present.</p><p>            “Now you have thirty-eight, just like last year.” I said helpfully.</p><p>            He stared at the package. It was wrapped in homemade wrapping paper, covered in my drawings, and looked rather festive with all its different colors.</p><p>            “Well, sweetie, why don’t you open it and see what Harry got you?” Petunia said, trying to sound pleasant and failing rather spectacularly.</p><p>            Dudley obediently tore the paper away and pulled out an old, worn book of fairy tales.</p><p>            “Fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm.” He read. “A book.” He looked stupidly at me.</p><p>            “It’s a picture book.” I muttered, and took a bite of my eggs. It wasn’t my best work, all things considering, but I’d had four years to practice drawing and countless hours at the library with plenty of access to informative books about art.</p><p>            He flipped through it and his eyes lit up, to my surprise. “It’s got gory pictures in it!” He declared happily. “Thanks, Harry!”</p><p>            Petunia and Vernon cast me twin looks of fearful disgust. We were at an impasse, I could tell. On one hand, they couldn’t take my gift away because Dudley liked it, but on the other hand both were loath to let him keep it. Petunia also looked a little surprised. Dudley usually turned his nose up at books of any sort, whatever the pictures.</p><p>            The phone rang suddenly, and Petunia got up to answer it.</p><p>            While she was away Dudley opened the rest of his presents and I ate more eggs than I probably would have been allowed to.</p><p>            When she got back, she looked worried. “Bad news, Vernon. Ms. Figgs broke her leg and can’t take care of Harry.”</p><p>            Dudley looked horrified.</p><p>            Vernon looked horrified.</p><p>            It was almost comical.</p><p>            “We could phone Marge,” he said desperately.</p><p>            Petunia shook her head. “She hates the boy.”</p><p>            “What about your friend, what’s her name, Yvonne?”</p><p>            “On vacation to Majorca.”</p><p>            “You could leave me here,” I inserted happily.</p><p>            Petunia looked like she’d swallowed a lemon. “And come back to find the house in ruins? Absolutely not!”</p><p>            Vernon glared at me as if Ms. Figg’s accident had been my fault. He tugged at his moustache. “We’ll have to bring him with us.” He said reluctantly.</p><p>            Dudley’s mouth fell open and he looked at me with horror. His face screwed up and he began to cry. “I – I-don’t- I don’t wa-a-ant him to c-come!” He wailed, and Petunia rushed to hug him.</p><p>            “I’m sorry, baby,” she soothed, “but there’s no other choice.”</p><p>            The doorbell rang, signaling the arrival of the guests, and Dudley stopped crying immediately.</p><p>            Half an hour later, I was sitting in the back of the Dursley’s car with Dudley and the Peckers boy – whose name, I discovered, was actually Piers Polkiss, so his status as the Peckers boy was, in fact, false – on the way to the zoo.</p><p>            It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was quite full. We walked for a good while and I ignored everything that was going on. It was too crowded for me to really enjoy myself, and as it had been fifteen years since the last time I’d been somewhere so busy, I was a bit overwhelmed by the whole ordeal besides.</p><p>            After lunch, we made our way to the reptile house. Dudley quickly made his way to the biggest snake there, some sort of a Brazilian python. It was curled up fast asleep.</p><p>            Dudley pounded the glass, trying to make it move.</p><p>            I shuffled in front of the tank, peering intently at the snake. It was probably bored out of its mind. I hoped it would be slightly more interesting than the garden snakes, but I knew better than to assume greater size meant greater intelligence. Dudley, after all, was four times my size and less intelligent than me by the same multiplier.</p><p>            The snake raised its head suddenly and looked at me.</p><p>            Then it winked.</p><p>            I stared at it for a moment, then glanced at the others to see if they were watching. They weren’t.</p><p>            The snake tilted its head at them and very clearly rolled its eyes.</p><p>            :I know,: I murmured to it, :It must be really annoying,:</p><p>            It nodded its head vigorously.</p><p>            “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”</p><p>            The yell startled me and I jumped away from the snake tank. The snake looked rather affronted.</p><p>            Dudley came waddling over as fast as he could. “Out of the way,” he grunted at me, shoving me. I obligingly allowed myself to topple over onto the ground.</p><p>            What happened next happened very quickly, and I almost didn’t see what happened. One minute Piers and Dudley were leaning against the glass, the next moment they both leapt back as quickly as they could.</p><p>            The glass had vanished.</p><p>            The great snake rapidly uncoiled itself and began slithering out onto the floor. Petunia scrambled back and let out a quiet scream. The commotion attracted the attention of the other visitors in the reptile house, and people began screaming and running for the exits.</p><p>            :Brazil, here I come…thanks amigo: The snake hissed at me as it slithered past.</p><p>            I hid a smile.</p><p>            The week I spent locked in the cupboard was well worth it, in my opinion.</p><p>            July arrived with worrying suddenness and a horrible sense of anticipation. Every morning, I waited anxiously for the mail to arrive and bring with it the letter that would decide my fate.</p><p>            There was, of course, an off chance that this was an alternate timeline in which I, Harry Potter, was not going to Hogwarts. But I figured the odds were in my favor.</p><p>            There was an exciting clatter in the mail slot as I helped Aunt Petunia put breakfast on the table one morning. Duddlekins and Vernon the Walrus were already sitting at the table, the former staring avidly at the telly, the latter buried in the newspaper, his horrid mustache bristling at some injustice of print.</p><p>            “Dudley, get the mail.” He grunted as I put bacon on the table and sat down.</p><p>            “Make Harry get it!” Dudley protested.</p><p>            “Get the mail, brat.”</p><p>            “Make Duddlekins get it!”</p><p>            “Poke him with your smelting stick, Dudley.”</p><p>            I dodged the smelting stick and headed to the door, trying not to be too excited, but my eleven year old body was full of adrenaline anyway.</p><p>            Three things lay on the doormat. One was a postcard from Aunt Marge the Magnificent, a custom one judging by the unflattering photo of her in her flashy – and unkindly revealing – circus outfit, her two trained monkeys on her shoulders. The second item was a brown envelope that was probably a bill. And the third – here my heart skipped a beat and a half – was a creamy yellowish envelope addressed to a Mr. Harry Potter.</p><p>            Well, well. What have we here? I picked up the mail and headed back to the living room, pocketing my letter and handing the other two to the Walrus. Aunt Petunia         narrowed her eyes at me as I sat down and I gave her as guileless a look as I could muster.</p><p>            Probably too guileless, I decided, as Petunia said in a sweet voice, “Harry, what have you got in your pocket?”</p><p>            “A ring,” I muttered quietly, unable to resist.</p><p>            “What?”</p><p>            “Nothing.”</p><p>            “Harry,” Her voice turned sharp. “Show me what you put in your pocket as you were walking in.”</p><p>            I sighed and pulled the letter out of my pocket. I held it up so she could see that it was addressed to me. “It’s a letter. And it’s mine.”</p><p>            I made to put it back in my pocket, but something in Petunia’s face had hardened. “Give that letter to me, boy.”</p><p>            I stared at her for a moment. How could she know what it was?</p><p>            Wordlessly, I handed it over. It wasn’t going to matter in the long run anyway. I would end up at Hogwarts one way or another.</p><p>            She tore it open and pulled out the paper. After taking a moment to scan it, she turned to Vernon. “Vern, it’s from…” she cast a look at Dudley and myself, who were both watching her aptly, “that place.” She hissed.</p><p>            Vernon’s face turned a blotchy red. “You said we wouldn’t have any of that nonsense in this house!” He barked, then turned his beady eyes on us. “Freak, get into your cupboard. Dudley, why don’t you go into the living room and watch the telly while your mother and I have a little chat?”</p><p>            “I don’t wanna go!” Duddlekins protested predictably.</p><p>            I stood up and headed out of the room, not bothering to point out that none of us had eaten yet. Duddlekins could do with a few skipped meals. My stomach growled at me to remind me that I myself could not, and I ignored it as I crawled into my cupboard to wait.</p><p>            After fifteen minutes or so, the cupboard door was opened by a nervous looking Walrus. “Erm, boy,” He began, his large mustache wiggling comically, “about this cupboard – your aunt and I have been thinking… you’re getting a bit big for it… we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.”</p><p>            “I won’t.”</p><p>            “What?”</p><p>            “I’m not leaving the cupboard.” I frowned at him.</p><p>            This seemed to leave Vernon at a temporary loss for words. “Not – leaving – the cupboard?” He repeated.</p><p>            “No.” I stated firmly. I liked this cupboard. It was cozy and smelled like pine boards. Dudley’s second bedroom smelled like old socks and reminded me painfully of my college roommate, Marvin, who had been both a pothead and a vegan.</p><p>            “You ungrateful little…!” Vernon began to roar and I closed the cupboard door in his face.</p><p>            I heard the door lock and sighed.</p><p>            It was going to be a long day.</p><p>            The next morning, Vernon sent Dudley to get the mail. Duddlekins tried to protest, but a hard look from Petunia quelled him.</p><p>            There was another letter, which Petunia snatched from Dudley immediately.</p><p>            “But that’s my letter!” I protested.</p><p>            She glared at me. “It was sent to you by mistake.”</p><p>            “It has my cupboard on it!”</p><p>            Petunia’s mouth pressed into a thin line.</p><p>            “Let me read it!” I tried to grab the letter from her, just for fun.</p><p>            She smacked me across the face, hard enough to sting. “That’s enough. You may not read this letter and if you keep trying, I’ll revoke your library privileges.”</p><p>            I tried to decide whether it was worth it, and decided it wasn’t. Sulkily, I ate my dry oatmeal and cast longing glances at the platter of bacon.</p><p align="center">^^^^^^^^^^</p><p>            This pattern of letter delivery and theft continued for several days. Each day, the number of letters increased, and with it, Vernon’s nervousness. Petunia didn’t seem to care that there were more letters. She kept hiding them away and I wondered briefly what she would do with them once I was gone.</p><p>            Then Sunday arrived and Vernon was positively dancing with glee. “No post on Sunday!” He exclaimed brightly at the breakfast table.</p><p>            I ignored him in favor stealing bacon off Dudley’s plate while he was distracted watching the kitchen telly.</p><p>            Petunia gave me an annoyed look as I ate my pilfered food, and I gave her a blithe smile in return. She made a small, irritated noise.</p><p>            It was at this moment there was a terrible noise in the chimney. We all turned and watched, with varying degrees of horror, as a few letters flew out, and then a few more, and then all at once a great torrent of fifty or sixty, flying about the room like huge, awful paper moths. Vernon jumped from his seat and began trying to grab them.</p><p>            I stole more bacon from Duddlekins’ plate.</p><p>            After all the letters settled to the floor, looking like so much giant confetti, Vernon spun and saw me eating bacon. “You!” He roared. “Out! All of you, out! We’re leaving!”</p><p>            He grabbed me and hauled me into the hall, tossing me unsteadily at my cupboard. “Pack some clothes. Pet; Dudley, do the same. Meet back in the hall in five minutes. No arguments!”</p><p>            I didn’t have a suitcase to put my things in, so I made do with a book bag one of the librarians had given me because it had had a hole in the bottom. I’d repaired the hole and now made short work of stuffing all my grey, oversized clothes into it. Everything I owned fit into it pretty well and I made it into the front hall just as Petunia and Dudley came down the stairs lugging large suitcases. Vernon was already in the hall, nervously twitching his mustache.</p><p>            We loaded into the car silently. We drove in equal silence. Dudley seemed shell-shocked, probably because Vernon had refused to let him bring any of his toys or his portable telly. Petunia looked pale and her lips were in a now-familiar tight line. Vernon was shaky and kept checking the rear view mirror.</p><p>            We drove… and drove… and drove.</p><p>            Finally, we stopped outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. I shared a room with Duddlekins, who snored as I sat awake and stared out the window, wondering if tomorrow and the next day would go exactly according to canon and if I would be able to save peoples’ lives and if…</p><p align="center">^^^^^^^^^^</p><p>            We ate stale cornflakes and toast for breakfast and as we were about to leave, the desk clerk approached us.</p><p>            “Is one of you a Mr. H. Potter?”</p><p>            “I am,” I raised my hand.</p><p>            “Well, I got about a hundred of these addressed to you, kid.” She held up a letter with the address:<br/>            MR. H. POTTER<br/>            ROOM 17<br/>            RAILVIEW HOTEL<br/>            COKEWORTH</p><p>            Vernon’s face paled. “I’ll take care of them.” He followed the clerk.</p><p>            A few minutes later, he came back and we all trailed silently after him to the car.</p><p>            “Wouldn’t it be better to just go home, dear?” Petunia suggested timidly, hours later.</p><p>            Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of us knew, although I was pretty sure of our destination.</p><p>            Sure enough, after many more hours in the car, we stopped on the coast. Vernon locked us in the car and disappeared. It started to rain.</p><p>            About an hour later, just as Dudley was starting to complain, Vernon appeared again and he was smiling. He had a long, thin package that he didn’t tell us what was. “Come on,” he said, “everyone out!”</p><p>            Duddlekins grumbled about the rain, and Petunia fretted about the mud.</p><p>            Vernon pointed to a large rock off the coast, upon which could be seen sitting a small shack.</p><p>            Petunia’s face turned grey. “Vernon, you can’t be serious.” She hissed.</p><p>            Vernon grinned jovially. “This old man has kindly agreed to lend us his boat.” He gestured to an ancient, toothless man. The man pointed, with a rather wicked grin, to a rickety rowboat bobbing in the iron-grey water below them.</p><p>            “All aboard!” Vernon said and headed to the boat with mad cheerfulness.</p><p>            It was a cold, miserable ride to the shack. It was cold and miserable inside the shack, too, and it smelled of seaweed. There were only two rooms.</p><p>            Vernon tried to start a fire, but the wood was wet and simply smoked. After a few tries, he succeeded only in filling the room with nasty smoke, and he gave up.</p><p>            As night fell, the promised storm blew up around us. Spray from the high winds splattered the walls of the hut and the wind rattled the filthy windows. Petunia found a few blankets and made up a bed for Duddlekins on the moth-eaten sofa. Then she and Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door.</p><p>            I settled reluctantly on the hard dirt floor. In a few hours, judging by the time on Dudley’s lighted watch, I’d be ‘eleven’. Technically, I’d be more like thirty-three.</p><p>            Technically, technically, I’d be negative eight, because I hadn’t been born yet.</p><p>            I realized with a jolt that a version of me might still be born in this world, and wondered how hard it would be to get to Arizona to check for my alternate self after I graduated Hogwarts.</p><p>            I occupied myself with thoughts like this for the next few hours, part of me waiting excitedly to hear the THUD of Hagrid arriving.</p><p>            Five minutes to go, and was that the creaking of the roof or of our unexpected guest?</p><p>            Four minutes to go, and I absentmindedly drew a birthday cake in the dust. Hagrid was bringing a cake with him and I, having not eaten since breakfast, was eagerly anticipating it.</p><p>            Three minutes, and that was probably the waves crashing on the rock, but my brain said it was heavy footsteps. And (two minutes) the crunching of gravel had to be imagined.</p><p>            There was no way I could hear these things with the wind screeching and the thunder cracking so loudly it was drowning out Duddlekins’ snores.</p><p>            Thirty seconds. I briefly considered counting down.</p><p>            Ten…nine…eight…seven…</p><p>            BOOM.</p><p>            The whole shack shivered. He was early.</p>
