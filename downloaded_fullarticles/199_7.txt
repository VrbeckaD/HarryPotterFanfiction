    <p>Hermione’s week with him was wonderful. He took her to every place he had promised, every sight there was to see, and as soon as those were done, they would hurry to his flat and wrap themselves around each other. They eventually thought of birth control, quite early on after that first night, so he took it upon himself to take a potion and save her the trouble. He would always have those available anyway. He patented and sold them.</p><p>            After shagging each other’s brains out – he had in fact helped her break that record of four orgasms in one day quite early on – they would be famished, and he would cook for them. It was bliss. She had never been happier.</p><p>            Early on Boxing Day, they took a portkey to London. Mobile numbers were properly exchanged, as were addresses, and they already arranged for him to sneak into her room the following night, after the kids were in bed. It would all work out. It had to. She couldn’t stop smiling.</p><p>            Hermione took the time to go home and leave her luggage. She sent a patronus ahead of her, to wake the kids and let them know she would be there in an hour. Rose had a mobile, but it didn’t work inside the Burrow. They had to go for walks to get to her during the week she was in New York. Plus, she was sure Arthur had taken it over, fascinated with muggle technology as he was.</p><p>            Once she had put away her clothes, day dreaming about Severus as she waved her wand about for the clean ones to go to the wardrobe and the dirty ones to go to the hamper, remembering exactly how some of those had gotten dirty, smiling giddily to herself, she apparated to the Burrow.</p><p>            As she was coming up a hill – she apparated far away now, hoping to not have to meet all of the Weasleys and make small talk, since it gave her anxiety – the kids spotted her, and ran down to meet her. Thank Merlin for that. However, the sight of their father following took her relief away.</p><p>            “Hi my darlings!” She exclaimed with a wide smile as Hugo and Rose came crashing into her with tight hugs. “Is everything okay?”</p><p>            “Yeah. We just missed you.”</p><p>            That made Hermione smile again. She thought about taking their hands and just apparating them out of there, ignoring the redhead that marched towards her completely, but she had to be civil. For the kids. So she waited for him to get to her.</p><p>            “Did you guys behave?” She asked while she was waiting for his wobbly ass to get down the hill. That thought made her smile, as she remembered Severus’ very tight and gorgeous one.</p><p>            Both her children chimed “yes” in unison.</p><p>            “And did you have fun?”</p><p>            “Yes. Uncle George is always fun to hang with,” Hugo said. Hermione made a note to confiscate any gifts that came from his shop later.</p><p>            “Plus, Albus and James and Lilly came over on most days,” Rose said smiling.</p><p>            “That sounds like a great time,” Hermione replied. “And did you get everything?”</p><p>            “Yes,” they said, tapping their bags on their backs.</p><p>            Ronald finally approached them. “Mione, we need to talk.”</p><p>            <em>Oh now you want to talk. A bit too late.</em></p><p>            “Did the kids get themselves into any trouble?” She asked, already sure of the answer. She taught her kids well.</p><p>            “No, they were great.” He messed up Hugo’s hair playfully. The boy however, scrunched his nose, much like his mother sometimes did, not appreciating the roughness and the weight of his hand. Ronald didn’t notice or care.</p><p>            “Then I don’t see anything we would need to discuss.” She turned to head back to the apparition sight, holding both her kids’ hands. “Say good bye to your father, kids.”</p><p>            “Bye.” “Bye dad,” they sang without looking back.</p><p>            “We need to talk about <em>us</em>, Mione.”</p><p>            Being called that now made her skin curl. It was terrible. She much preferred being called Herms. Of course it would ruin the charm if everyone called her that. “Walk on to the apparition point, guys,” she said to the children. “I’ll be right behind you.”</p><p>            They nodded and skipped on down the hill. Hermione turned swiftly to see Ron smirking in the most obnoxious way, believing she had actually considered talking to him, that he was so fucking great that she couldn’t live without him.</p><p>            “There is no <em>us</em>, you imbecile. The sooner you get that through your thick red skull, the better. You didn’t want to talk when there was a <em>us</em>, and now I rue the day I ever met you. The only reason I don’t wish you dead is for the sake of the children. But to me personally, it would truly make no difference if you were run over by the Knight Bus.” She spat it all out angrily, between gritted teeth, and left Ron speechless, with his jaw dropped.</p><p>            She turned around swiftly and hurried down the hill to catch up to her kids. She was quite pleased and surprised with herself. She didn’t think she had it in her to speak to him like that. She probably would never have done it, weren’t it for meeting Severus again, spending the week with him making her feel like she was a queen, and worth a damn. She smiled.</p><p>            Ron only regained the ability to speak when she had caught up to the kids. “Mione!” He called a bit angrily, and began walking towards her again.</p><p>            “Okay guys, hold on to my hand tightly. Here we go,” she said, and disapparated immediately, not even waiting to reach the apparition point.</p><p> </p><p>            As they unpacked their backpacks in their rooms, Hermione stood in the hall, between both doors, listening to them retell how they played with their cousins and their fun uncle, how their grandma stuffed them full of food, how they got so many presents. She then announced she came bearing gifts as well. She went into her room to fetch them, alongside the little New York snow globes – and a little stuffed animal with an “I heart NY” shirt on for Rose, and a pin for Hugo – and gave them the presents, adding to the pile their uncles and grandparents had given and that they were showing her. They were both very excited, and thanked her with hugs. The snow globes and teddy bear went up on their shelves straight away.</p><p>            Hermione cooked them lunch, and as they sat at the table eating, she prepared to address the topic that was most pressing to her right now. Her complete happiness.</p><p>            “Hey, guys… I need to talk to you.”</p><p>            “Yeah?” Rose asked. Hugo just looked at her.</p><p>            “How would you feel if… I started seeing someone? A man.”</p><p>            “Like… going out on dates and stuff?” Hugo asked.</p><p>            “Yes. Just like that.”</p><p>            Hugo just shrugged slowly. Rose, ever the romantic, looked more excited.</p><p>            “Would you guys be willing… to meet him, and see if you like him?”</p><p>            “Oh, you’re already seeing him?” Hugo asked.</p><p>            “Well, yes. We met and really like each other, and I want you guys to be okay with it. Does that bother you, Hugo?”</p><p>            “No… it’s just… weird, is all.” He was a little quiet. He had always been the shy one.</p><p>            “Wait, is it Severus?” Rose asked, eyes shining. She was always a sucker for romance and fairy tales. And her mother had told her the story, not getting into deep sordid details about her father and what he said and did. But she knew he wasn’t right for her mom. She had always sort of known. They never clicked like the prince and princess in the stories.</p><p>            Besides, the constant silence in the house, the weird atmosphere, the screaming, when there was talking, all told her that it wasn’t right, it shouldn’t be like that. Even Hugo knew. And when she opened up to her mother, saying she would never want to get married or want a boyfriend, and that she avoided making friends with boys in school because she didn’t want to be around more people, more <em>men</em>, like her dad, Hermione had to prove to her all men would not be like that. And the only example she had to share was of Severus, so she did, scared to death that the 9-year-old at the time would let something slip to her father or anyone else, and that Hermione would be seen as the cheating whore. But Rose was smart. She knew she could not be too open with her father. She had learned it early on. He got mad at the smallest, stupidest things, and screamed and called everyone names. That alone discouraged her from even talking to him much. And Severus… It gave her romantic heart hope, that she could find someone like that when she was old enough, and that her mom could one day smile and be happy. Maybe he could find them, and save them from her father.</p><p>            Hermione smiled sheepishly. “Yes,” she nodded.</p><p>            “Who’s Severus?” Hugo asked.</p><p>            “He’s a friend mummy had long ago, before you were born even. And I really liked spending time with him, but we lost touch.”</p><p>            “Were you… <em>with</em> him while you were with dad?”</p><p>            “No, never, sweetie. We were just friends.” Hermione reassured firmly. “I swear to you.”</p><p>            Rose thought it would be okay if she were with him. She knew her dad had been with others. She had tried to deny it to herself for long, but all the time he spent away from home while her friends’ dads where at home, having dinner… and how her mum was always sad. But during the divorce she had overheard it, and it made sense. She had never told her mother though. At least if she had been with Severus, she would have gotten back at dad, and would have been happy, even if for a while.</p><p>            There was a bit of silence. Then Rose spoke.</p><p>            “I started to learn about the war in History of Magic. How you and dad and uncle Harry were in it.”</p><p>            “Hmm.” Hermione did not really make much of it. They had already talked about why people took pictures and stared in Diagon Alley and other magical neighborhoods. And Hogwarts, now, of course. They addressed that early on.</p><p>            “And they say Severus was in it too. Is it true?”</p><p>            Oh. Yes. There was that. Fuck. Nothing was ever easy, was it?</p><p>            “Yes, he was,” Hermione started apprehensively.</p><p>            “And he was a spy for the Light, and put himself in danger to save you and uncle Harry?”</p><p>            Hermione smiled, relieved they were teaching good things about Severus. Right things. That was probably mostly Minerva’s doing. Otherwise they could be taught everything in a wrong light, and Severus’ role could be open to interpretation. “Yes, that is true. He almost died, to save the world from Voldemort.”</p><p>            “He was a spy?!” Hugo asked, amazed. Hermione nodded. “Wow! Cool.” Hermione sniggered.</p><p>            “And is it true he did it all because he loved uncle Harry’s mum?”</p><p>            “Well… yes, they were friends, and he was really sad when she was killed.”</p><p>            Rose fell silent for a moment. That was a little hard for her romantic brain and heart. How could he have loved Mrs. Potter for all that time, say it was eternal, and then have a history with <em>her</em> mother? Didn’t true, everlasting love exist then?</p><p>            Hermione seemed to guess what her daughter was thinking. “Honey, that was so long ago. Mrs. Potter… well, she’s dead, and even if she wasn’t… she was Mrs. Potter. Don’t you think Severus deserves to find someone who can love him back? To be happy? It doesn’t mean that what he felt for her wasn’t real… It’s like me and your father. There was love there once” <em>at least on my part</em> “when we got married and had you guys. But then it just… didn’t work. It doesn’t mean that what we felt never existed, you see? Love is like a little seed you plant, and if you water it and let the sun shine on it, it will grow into a tall tree, and stand strong through everything time can throw at it. But if you leave it forgotten in the dark, take it for granted… it will die. Mrs. Potter did not nurture Severus’ love. So now he’s open to something new. But if you take good care of it, love <em>can</em> last forever.”</p><p>            Rose smiled. “I see.” The part about her father not nurturing her mother’s love could be left unsaid.</p><p>            There was more silence as they chewed.</p><p>            “So, would you be willing to meet him and let him accompany us to New Year’s?”</p><p>            “Yes,” Rose smiled.</p><p>            “Can I ask him about spy stuff?” Hugo asked.</p><p>            Hermione chuckled. “Perhaps not right away, dear. Those memories are a bit painful. They’re not like in the movies you like to watch.”</p><p>            “Okay,” Hugo said, a bit disappointed.</p><p> </p><p>            That night, when the kids were in bed, Hermione crawled into hers, with her mobile. She called Severus. She missed him already, and had fought back the urge to text him all day, like a stupid teenager afraid to be annoying and clingy. But she wouldn’t be able to wait to talk to him only tomorrow.</p><p>            As the phone rang, panic filled her. What if whatever had happened in New York, had stayed in New York, and she was being a stupid dreamer thinking all that would transfer into normal, daily life? And she was teaching her daughter to be a stupid dreamer too, to only get her heart broken?</p><p>            “Hi, gorgeous,” she heard rumbled in her ear over the phone, in that silky, sexy molten voice, and her heart was suddenly calm again to hear him being as sweet as he had been all week. As he had been ever since their re-acquaintance, all the way back after the war. “Sorry it took me a while to answer, I was in the shower.”</p><p>            “Hmmm. That right there would be a great sight for me to be having right now.”</p><p>            “You should have video called then.” She could hear the smirk on his voice. “I’m already getting dressed now, unfortunately for you.”</p><p>“Well, now I know what time I’ll be video calling every night, at least,” she replied.</p><p>Severus just chuckled at that. “Is everything alright, love?”</p><p>“Yes,” she smiled. He was still calling her love. “I’m just calling to let you know I had the chat about you with the kids.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“It was good. We are on for New Year’s, it seems.”</p><p>“Fantastic. Tell me more. How did they react?”</p><p>“They… Hey,” she changed her track of thought suddenly. “Would it be too annoyingly overbearing to tell you that I miss you already, and that I don’t think I can wait to see you tomorrow? Would it be too clingy if I were to ask you to come over now?”</p><p>She heard a sudden pop on her patio and a subsequent knock on her French doors before she could even make sense of any of it. She looked outside, and he was there, on her patio, holding his phone and wearing his pajamas, smiling through the glass at her.</p><p>She rushed out of bed, still holding her phone to her ear, stupidly, and opened the door.</p><p>“No,” he answered her into the phone, then hung it up. “Because I already miss you too,” he said directly to her, and pulled her body to press against his, her lips to be devoured by his.</p><p>“Hi,” she smiled giddily when they parted, his arm still around her.</p><p>With his free hand he closed the door to the patio behind him. He then pulled her thighs swiftly up so her legs could wrap around his waist, and she muted her surprised yelp by pressing her lips together while she held on to his neck. She had dropped her phone on the carpeted floor, and didn’t even care. His had been dropped when he pulled her in for the first kiss. She just hoped the kids hadn’t heard her little yelp.</p><p>“Hello,” he said into her neck as he kissed it, carrying her to bed.</p><p>“Severus... I thought you wanted to know what happened with the kids,” she said, smiling cheekily as he laid her on the bed and laid himself on top of her.</p><p>“I do.” He claimed her lips softly, sucking on her lower one for a moment longer after they had parted. “Tell me.” He kissed her lips again. “I’m listening,” he smiled, then lowered his lips to her neck and nipped it lightly.</p><p>She sniggered. “Rose has heard about you in History of Magic,” she said, taking purchase on his shoulders as he still attempted slow kisses on her neck and nibbles on her ear, “and from me of course. She seems really taken by…. The reason you became a spy.” She paused. He said nothing, just continued to stimulate her neck, now nipping the flesh that joined it to her shoulder, making her quiver. He hadn’t shaved since the previous morning. That morning, when they woke to catch the portkey, he had already had a 5 o’clock shadow, but there had been no time to shave; they had to run to catch it. And it appeared as if he had foregone shaving for the rest of the day, as he now had a nice stubble on his gorgeous face. It was mostly grey, peppered with black, and made him even sexier, if that were even possible. It rubbed on the sensitive skin of her neck and instead of making her itch and annoying her, as she had known other beards to do, it was soft and nice and made her tingle in the best of ways. Made her quiver with much more intensity. He smirked against her skin as she quivered yet again with his nuzzling, and she hummed softly.</p><p>“Hugo…” she was already finding it difficult to concentrate and tell him what she wanted to. “Hugo seems to think you are James Bond.”</p><p>Severus licked her throat and moved to kiss the other side of her neck, stubble always softly caressing her. “Well I do have a sexy Bond girl with her legs wrapped around me,” he rumbled in her ear before nipping it. His hand slipped under her shirt and found a bare breast. He rolled his thumb over her nipple as he hummed his approval of her breast being bare against her neck.</p><p>“Seeev…” she whined half-heartedly, dying to have him take her and really not giving a damn about what she was saying. But she couldn’t let him know that, give him that much power. “You’re not listening.”</p><p>“I am.” He kissed her neck, hand still on her breast under her shirt, kneading on it. “But your smell… it’s just so intoxicating. What is that? You smell slightly different than from New York.” He said it all into her neck, then rubbed his nose behind her ear, and once again his stubble hit some internal button that just made her quicken.</p><p>“It’s just soap,” she smiled.</p><p>“Soap and ensnaring witch,” he rumbled while pinching her nipple.</p><p>“Sev!” She squeezed his arm.</p><p>He pulled back and supported his head on his hand, elbow on mattress, to look at her. His other hand was still under her shirt, softly kneading her breast. “I heard. Rose is ever the romantic and is taken by the romantic hero plotline. She should be ease to please, as I do, truly, love her mother.” He lifted Hermione’s shirt with his index finger, slowly, exposing the breast he had been bestowing attention on, and his eyes shined upon seeing her bare skin. She smiled like a bloody teenager. He continued to gently tease her nipple. “And Hugo… likes adventure. Don’t worry, I’m sure I am able to tone down some stories to be… appropriate for his age.” Severus covered her lips with his again, hungrily. He then pulled her bum so her core could touch his, and feel his hard cock under his pajama trousers. She moaned into his mouth. She then pulled apart from him, while she could still focus enough to form words.</p><p>“It’s not <em>that</em> I worry about. I… don’t want him badgering you and bringing up painful memories.”</p><p>“Herms. Baby.” He kissed her lips. “I appreciate the concern. I really do. But no memories could ever pain me again now that I have the love of my life in my arms, claiming she is mine.”</p><p>Fuck. He would make her cheeks freeze up next to her eyes the way he had her smiling like a fool all the time.</p><p>“I am yours,” she said, then claimed his lips.</p><p>“Say it again,” he whispered against her lips, pulling her by the waist to press her body against his.</p><p>“I’m yours, Sev. All yours,” she breathed.</p><p>“You are getting my prick so hard for you,” he rumbled.</p><p>“Yeah?” She breathed next to the corner of his mouth, her hand snaking in between them to stroke his cock over his trousers. “Is this all for me?”</p><p>“Every fucking inch.”</p><p>He slid his hand to caress her mound lightly over her pajama trousers.</p><p>“Uhhmm… I should have changed into something sexy before calling you.”</p><p>“You’re sexy all on your own, love.” He nipped her ear, teasing her mound still.</p><p>“I don’t want you to see me in big cotton knickers only!”</p><p>His hand left her mound and came to cup her face, his thumb on her lips. “You could be in dirty rags; I would still want you.” He then teased her lips open with his and devoured them.</p><p>            “You lie,” she whispered when their lips parted.</p><p>            “I don’t. But if it bothers you so much, just wait for me naked,” he smirked.</p><p>            She smiled and pushed his shoulder gently. So he took that hand from her cheek and slid it into her trousers to find her warm center. He immediately touched the perfect spot, and she had to bite her lip to cut her loud moan short.</p><p>            “You naughty little witch. You aren’t even wearing knickers at all.” He sunk his finger into her moist folds, making her moan into his neck and bite gently on it to be more quiet.</p><p>            “Oh… fuck… Sev…” she panted as he teased her. “We need to be quiet.”</p><p>            “Good luck with that,” he said, smirking. “My mouth will be full, but you… you I want to hear screaming, uninhibited, showing you are enjoying yourself thoroughly.”</p><p>            “And your mouth will be full… why?” She asked, panting as his fingers thrust slowly into her.</p><p>            “Because I’ll be eating your delicious pussy.” He pulled off her pajama trousers quickly, throwing them out of the way, to the floor, and she excitedly pulled her shirt off after waving her hand at the closed door and locking it.</p><p>            She smiled as he again began to kiss her neck, moving faster this time, down to his announced destination, but she pushed him to lie back. She straddled him and pulled off his shirt. He lifted his arms to enable her. “Oh no, no,” she said as she caressed his bare chest, scratched it softly, letting her fingers run through his chest hair which she so liked to tease. It made him look all man. It excited her more. “<em>I’ll</em> be the one with my mouth full,” she said in what she hoped was a sexy tone and smile, but he could see the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes.</p><p>            “Herms,” he cupped her cheek, his fingers sinking into her hair gently, “you don’t have to. I don’t need that,” he said softly, kindly. He had noticed her apparent reluctance in performing such an act during their week in New York. He had quickly kissed her, letting the playful insinuating be forgotten, and never did he again insinuate such a thing, not even as a joke. He didn’t know what that was about, and he didn’t ask. He didn’t want to know, unless she wanted to share freely. Because it could be something as simple as insecurity she wouldn’t do a good job, or it could stretch to a matter of things, right up to Weasley having forced himself on her. And if he learned such things happened, he would kill him, without a doubt.</p><p>            She indeed had reluctance in doing it, simply because she didn’t remember ever enjoying it. The taste wasn’t pleasing, she got absolutely nothing from it, especially since men – or maybe just Ronald –  would fall asleep immediately afterwards, and because his cock was obviously not hard anymore afterwards. Besides, Ronald would hold her to him at some point, making it hard to breathe and just that much less enjoyable. But men liked this. And she wanted to please this man. And this, right now, his tenderness in saying he didn’t need it when his dark eyes had obviously lit in desire at her insinuation, was a sign he would be gentler, at least.</p><p>            “I want to,” she smiled at him, and there was more conviction in her eyes as she lowered her lips to his. She then took her lips to his chest, and trailed a way down it, sliding off of him to kneel beside his hips. When her lips reached the waistband of his trousers, she grazed her teeth on the flesh under his navel, and he hissed. She looked up at him, to make sure it had been in pleasure, and his eyes were fixed on hers, burning hot with desire. She pulled the waistband over his cock, which sprang out immediately, desperately craving freedom, and she stroked him once… twice… slowly, as she watched him with a smile. He closed his eyes at her touch and grunted.</p><p>            She pulled off his trousers completely, and once again stroked him. He placed his hand on her back and caressed, tracing her spine like only he knew how, making her quiver, making her aroused by it, by all of it. So she proceeded to kissing his tip gently as she stroked closer to the base, and he breathed heavily through his nose. His hand still caressed her back, reassuring her, and she rolled her tongue over his dark pink tip, slowly, and then sucked lazily on it, as if it were a delicious ice cream cone, and he let out a moan. She took him away from her lips with a smile and looked at him, placing her index finger against her lips, indicating he should be quiet with the most devilish smirk on her lips. It made his cock twitch. It would certainly be very hard.</p><p>            She sucked on his tip again. He tasted good. So good. She was enjoying it, enjoying watching the effect she had on him. It helped as well that, despite having chest hair that trailed a path down into his trousers, to his cock, he was very well groomed down there. So she could slide her lips down his shaft with ease, and feel his soft, sensitive skin, and only that. And that she did. Afar as she could, she engulfed him, and he growled, his teeth gritted, trying to keep it low, rolling his eyes back into his head as his tip hit the back of her throat, once… twice… and again.</p><p>            She enjoyed herself. He now caressed her bum as well he could while she sucked him off, and his fingers teased her slit, her labia, sunk into her briefly to touch her clit, tease her folds.</p><p>            She started to lose focus due to this, his ministrations, so she placed herself in between his legs, further from his touch, so she could give him all the attention he deserved. She licked his underside again, base to tip, zigzagged around his ridges, making his breathing even more labored, as her eyes never left his. She then sucked his tip slowly, savoring it like strawberry ice cream again.</p><p>And his hand came towards her cheek. But instead of forcing her down on his cock, grabbing her hair to control her movements, he just caressed her cheek, and pushed her hair back so he could see her face better. That tenderness made her more aroused. She once again took all of him into her mouth, and he hissed, still caressing her cheek.</p><p>“Your soft lips feel so fucking good, Herms.” He hissed as her lips lowered around him. “Fuck,” he breathed.</p><p>Hearing that made her core tighten, and she sucked on him again, over, and over, fondling his balls at one point, watching for his reaction.</p><p>He was finding it hard to breathe, to keep his eyes on her as he wanted to, to hold his hips still and not push into her mouth. He saw her bum up in the air, reflected off the black TV screen, and her swollen channel was craving him, calling to him, and it only increased his arousal. And when she fondled his balls… fuck… he bit his tongue to not be loud, though he couldn’t stop from grunting and groaning.</p><p>She had read about something – little bookworm she still was – but had never had the urge to even try it. But now, seeing him squirm under her, look at her with so much hunger and desire, telling her she felt so good… she wanted to make him come hard. So she withdrew him from her mouth, letting the air touch the warmth of her saliva. She licked his length… then she sucked on his balls as her hand stroked him slowly, and he couldn’t help but hiss “fuck” in a slightly louder tone. Her tongue then teased his perineum, and he moaned “oh fuck yes, Herms,” confirming to her that it was indeed pleasurable. So she took her fingers to it, and applied pressure, letting his cock go briefly. She had read that if she inserted her finger in his bum, it would feel better, but she wasn’t sure how he would feel about that, nor did she have lube handy to try it. But this external massage on his perineum seemed to be working just fine for now. He fisted her sheets, his eyes closed, his breathing heavy. When she touched his cock again, he trembled. She lowered her lips onto him, and his breathing hitched.</p><p>“Herms… I… I can’t… love, please…”</p><p>She knew what he meant, but continued to suck him anyway. One… two… three pumps of her lips around him as she massaged him on that magical little spot were enough to make him come hard down her throat, spilling shot after shot of his seed, which she swallowed all of, gladly, confirming to her that he indeed tasted marvelous, and that the problem she had was not in performing this act at all.</p><p>He bucked into her mouth once, then froze, then twice, as he apparently felt waves of pleasure running through him repeatedly. He had exhaled in a throaty way, but her trained mom ears told her all laid undisturbed outside the walls of her room.</p><p>She placed herself beside him, smiling at what she accomplished. He looked awestruck, still catching his breath. She was so horny. It was a first for her, being this aroused just because she gave someone pleasure, hardly being touched herself at all.</p><p>She placed her hand in between her legs, gently teasing herself, feeling how wet she was. Then, without much thought, she took her hand, fingers sticky with her fluids, and caressed his chest as his panting subsided.</p><p> He felt her warmth, her moistness on his chest and suddenly, he cupped her cheek and pulled her lips to his, devouring them. “You little minx,” he rumbled against the corner of her lips when they parted. He caressed her lips, teasing his fingers into it, and she sucked on them. He kissed her behind her ear, his stubble rubbing on her cheek and neck, making chills run down her spine. He took his wet fingers from her mouth to her mound, sliding his middle and ring fingers on either side of her clit, pinching them between them, making her moan.</p><p>“Now it’s your turn to come hard,” he smirked, and nuzzled her neck, knowing full well by now that his stubble would make her quiver. He still slid her clit in between his fingers, and he felt it swell in between them.</p><p>“Oh Sev…” she exclaimed loudly.</p><p>“Shhh… quiet as a mouse, remember?” He smirked, and pinched her clit lightly. She sunk her fingertips in his shoulder and bit her lip to avoid moaning.</p><p>He kissed her collarbone, his beard once again scratching her.</p><p>“Sev…” she whispered. “Oh yes.”</p><p>He then rubbed his stubble on her breasts, lightly on her nipples, and they prickled and hardened instantly. He traced a circle around her nipple, the one closest to him, with the tip of his tongue, then sucked on it. When he released it with a slight pop, he also pulled gently on her clit, which was still being teased in between his fingers.</p><p>“Oh fuck, Sev!”</p><p>He finally buried his face in between her thighs. His stubble grazed her inner thighs as he kissed them, teasingly, and also her mound as he kissed the flesh under her navel. It made all kinds of sweet sensations shoot through her as she writhed beneath him. He then finally licked her slit, and his lips settled on her clit, licking it lazily, sucking on it passionately. Since she had a full wax, she could feel his stubble scratching her gently on her outer lips, and it just drove her to the edge of insanity.</p><p>“Oh Sev, yes love, please,” she whimpered.</p><p>“Shhh,” he rumbled against her clit, and the vibration added to her pleasure. He then sucked on it slowly, and her eyes rolled back into her head.</p><p>“Oh fuck!” She let slip in a moan, and he looked up at her, a smirk in his eyes as his lips continued at their task, while she watched the grey top of his head nestled in between her thighs. He reached up a hand and covered her mouth with it, gently, as his tongue increased its pace and suction of her bundle of nerves. It was a good thing he did it, because her moans really got away from her for a moment, and the only thing that muffled them was his palm.</p><p>She then found it in her to nip at the fleshy part of his fingers and palm as he covered her lips. He inserted his fingers in her mouth, and as he sucked on her mound and clit and licked her folds, she mimicked his movements on his fingers. He then pulled his fingers away, and brought them down to where his lips worked, inserting them in her already soaking folds, her saliva only adding to the ease with which he slipped into her.</p><p>She managed to grab a corner of the duvet and stick it in her mouth. She then moaned into it, loudly, all that she had wanted to moan while his fingers where entering her. It would have definitely woken the whole house if it had not been muffled by the cloth in her mouth.</p><p>He smiled, eyes on her, tongue at work more earnestly, beard scratching at her labia and inner thigh, finger thrusting slowly inside her, hooked, teasing that wonderful spot inside her over and over. She rocked her hips against him and caressed his short, soft hair. He could hear a muffled string of “oh yes, fuck, Sev, please, lick that pussy.”  He worked harder, faster, and so her hips rolled, following the pace he set. He held her hips down and pulled back to tap four flat fingers on her engorged clit, once, twice, making her flinch in pleasure and moan. He then stuck two fingers back into her folds, hooking them to scratch that sweet spot, and placed his tongue flat on her clit, licking it and sucking swiftly. Her legs trembled and her eyes rolled back into her head, and he could hear her almost always present whimper of “yesyesyesyesyesyes” before she screamed into the duvet as she wet his face and hand with her essence. He triggered more waves, still scratching inside her and sucking on her bud.</p><p>When he pulled back, she was so breathless, almost suffocated by the duvet. He pulled it away to see her fully flushed face, and to cover her lips with his, still moist of her pleasure.</p><p>“Severus,” she panted, still, as they broke apart. “I love you so much.”</p><p>He smiled. “I love you more,” he whispered, and sucked on her chin.</p><p>“No. No. I doubt that. I just want to stay here, in this bed, next to you, for the rest of my life.” He kissed her throat, his stubble once again working wonders on her skin. “And that beard… oh, I could really get used to that.”</p><p>He smirked, rubbing it more intently as he nuzzled her neck.</p><p>“Can you stay the night?” She asked. “Sneak out in the morning?”</p><p>“Absolutely. Especially since you got my cock rock hard again, my incredible little witch,” he rumbled in her ear, pressing his prick on her leg so she could feel he spoke the truth.</p><p>“Hmmm,” she hummed in appreciation of his prick hard against her leg and his beard rubbing on that spot on her neck that drove her insane.</p><p>He shifted his weight so he could be completely atop of her and slid himself into her, slowly. She squeezed his bum, pushing him further into her, and he claimed her lips lovingly. Once their lips parted, he rubbed his nose on hers. He then just stared into her eyes as he moved atop her, inside her, gingerly.</p><p>“What?” She asked, blushing, once she began to get self-conscious of his loving stare.</p><p>“It just boggles me.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How fucking gorgeous you are,” he breathed.</p><p>She smiled. “You should stop that. I just might get used to it.”</p><p>“Good.” He pecked her lips. “You should be told that every day,” he kissed her cheek. “And I will do it for as long as I live.” He nuzzled her neck. As he kissed it, he hooked her leg behind him and that made his tip brush nicely against that sweet spot inside her.</p><p>She moaned rather loudly. “Oh Sev, yes!”</p><p>“I thought we were being quiet,” he breathed against the corner of her lips, his thumb caressing the other half of it. He started moving slightly faster.</p><p>“I love you,” she whispered.</p><p>“And I you.”</p><p>“Promise me it will always be like this,” she pleaded in a desperate whisper, her fear and anxiety of having a good thing shattered taking the best of her.</p><p>“Yes,” he panted. “Always.” He hit that spot in her again and she rolled her head back into the pillows. “I love you with all my heart.” He grazed his teeth gently on her throat as she clung to his shoulder.</p><p>As her head rolled back down to face him, he touched his forehead to hers, and they just moved slowly as one, staring into each other’s eyes, pecking and sucking on each other’s lips. Their orgasms didn’t take long to come, and did not come to them explosively. They crept up quietly, and before they knew it, they were shuddering in each other’s arms, just holding one another close. She expressed hers with a small whimper, and he just grunted as he exhaled against her cheek.</p><p>He shifted to lay beside her, and just looked at her, smiling, caressing her cheek. She grazed her nails on his chest, playing with the hair there.</p><p>“Wait for me right here,” she said as she started to get up.</p><p>“Like I could apparate or even move in such conditions,” he drawled playfully. “Where are you going?”</p><p>She was pulling on a housecoat. “Just to check if the kids are still asleep.”</p><p>“Okay. Please caw like some kind of bird as means of warning if I need to hide myself under the bed. It might take a while for me to manage. I am old, you know.”</p><p>She laughed softly. “They won’t come in here. Just stay there and relax. And don’t start with the old talk, or I might have to sit on your face to prove you wrong.” She smiled cheekily.</p><p>“You’ll be the death of me, Herms.”</p><p>She shushed him as she unlocked the door and headed out, pulling it closed behind her.</p><p> </p><p>After almost a week of sneaking into her room afterhours and leaving at the break of dawn, New Year’s Eve was upon them. He walked up to her house like a proper muggle, after having sneaked out of there that morning, and rang the doorbell. It was early afternoon. He was nervous. He had never made a good impression on children, but his life and happiness depended on it today. He carried two packages – belated Christmas presents for them. He hoped it would work.</p><p>Hermione came to the door wearing a smile already. “Hi,” she said, and he so wanted to kiss those smiling lips, but dared not, since the curious children came trotting up behind her.</p><p>“Hello,” he said a bit stiffly.</p><p>“Come in.” She stepped aside and he stepped inside. The kids shyly looked up at him and the packages he held.</p><p>“Rose, Hugo, this is Severus.”</p><p>Severus stretched out a hand to shake Hugo’s hand first. The boy took it firmly.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Hugo. Nice shake.”</p><p>The boy smiled shyly.</p><p>Severus then took Rose’s hand and leaned down to brush his lips lightly on the back of it, like a gentleman, making her giggle. “A pleasure to make you re-acquaintance, Miss Rose.”</p><p>He couldn’t help but stare a bit. She very much looked like the baby he had held 13 years ago, but she also had her mother’s soft eyes now. The only Weasley feature was in fact the red hair, which didn’t make her look like Weasley at all. All the memories of holding her and feeding her bottles and bouncing her about in his arms came rushing back to him, and his heart just filled with sudden joy and… possibly love for her, it really did. He wished he could have been around for longer. “You’re just as pretty as I remember.”</p><p>Rose looked at Hermione and her mom just smiled. “Thank you,” Rose said as she blushed.</p><p>“Now, he said, trying to fight away his anxiety and the awkwardness that hung in the air, “I come bearing belated Christmas gifts. Your mum helped me pick them out, so hopefully you’ll like them.”</p><p>He had bought them in New York with her, when she bought hers. He handed them the packages, and their little eyes shined.</p><p>“What do we say?” Hermione spoke to her children.</p><p>“Thank you,” they said in unison.</p><p>“May we open them now?” Rose looked to her mother, then Severus.</p><p>Severus looked to Hermione, and she looked to him, as if saying it was his call. “Yes, of course,” he said a bit awkwardly, and they ran to sit on the living room floor and open them.</p><p>Hugo got a Lego set Hermione assured Severus he would love. It was an extension of the one she had given him, and he would most definitely be disappointed in not getting the complete set. So he would complete the boy’s happiness. And so it seemed to be the case. He ripped the wrapping paper open and his jaw dropped when he saw it. “Oh wow! Thanks!” he said again, more enthusiastically this time. Hermione smiled as she snaked her way to Severus’ side to watch, under his arm, as he stood at the living room door. He just naturally embraced her, not even registering the novelty of showing affection in front of the kids.</p><p>Rose got Jane Austen’s collection. Hermione assured him she was an avid reader, which really wasn’t hard to believe given the womb she had come from, and would certainly enjoy Austen. Hermione had her own copy, of course, a large tome with all of them combined in it. But Severus gave Rose a collection with individual books, bound in nice, pretty, girly cloth. That way she could carry the one she was reading around in her robes in Hogwarts, like he just knew she would. It would be good for her romantic heart. She could see that, for every Willoughby that broke your heart and wronged you, there would be a Brandon to help mend it and who accepted you, flaws and all; for every Wickham that misused you, there would be a Darcy to make it right; for every Churchill that deceived you, there would be a Knightley who was truthful; and if there was a Wentworth that the tides took away, time would bring him back to his rightful place. As it had happened with him and her mother.</p><p>The kids took their presents, excited looks on their faces, and hurried to find a little spot of their own in the house to enjoy them in. But not before walking past their mom and noticing the smile on her face, and how she leaned against Severus’ side, arm around his waist, as he had his arm around her shoulders. They displayed a bit of silent and timid shock, and Severus stiffened a bit. But it wasn’t due to him. It’s just that they hadn’t seen affection like that in their house, ever. It was mostly seen in movies only.</p><p>When they had disappeared, Hermione announced she should get dinner going, if they were to get to the firework show in time. He, of course, offered to help. But as he chopped something or other for her, he looked very much not there. He was a bit closed off, mind on something else.</p><p>“Sev?” Hermione asked worriedly.</p><p>He looked up as if he had been startled. “Hmmm?”</p><p>“What’s wrong? You look… weird.” Her mind started racing. Was this too much for him? Would he leave? <em>Oh God, please, don’t let that happen</em>. “If… if you don’t feel well doing this…”</p><p>“Hey, hey. Hush woman,” he said, smiling slyly and wrapping his arms around her waist. It was then he realized he hadn’t even kissed her. Since that morning when he left at the crack of dawn that is. So he leaned down to touch her lips softly, suckle on them tenderly. She very much enjoyed it, and was smiling when they parted. “I’m just… worried. What they think of me. If I’ll impress. My happiness does rest in their hands.”</p><p>Hermione let go of him to tend to a pot that was hissing, and he just leaned his backside on the counter.</p><p>“Don’t worry. They’re just shy. But I can tell they don’t dislike you. You came bearing gifts after all,” she laughed softly, as did he.</p><p>“And I will not lie, seeing Rose again…”</p><p>Hermione looked at him and could tell that he was a little emotional, though he was trying hard to control it. She smiled and let go of the spatula she led, leaving it resting in the pot, and moved to wrap her arms around him. She kissed his chest and rubbed her hand up and down his back, soothing him quietly.</p><p>She poured them some wine, and he helped her with the dish she was making from scratch as they talked and joked and stole innocent caresses. It was while they laughed about something together that Rose came walking into the kitchen. She had her face in one of the books she had just gotten, but the laughing made her look up. It was strange noise for her household. She saw her mother and Severus, both had their backs to where she was coming from, busy with something on the counter and the stove. But her mother had that giant smile on her face that had been there since that morning, growing wider when he rang the doorbell. And he took his hand to her mother’s cheek, his thumb caressing it, his eyes so tender and warm. She remembered how her mother had said not all men would be like her father, and when asked how could she know for sure, she had opened up about this friend of hers. And it seemed to be true. Her stomach tingled with excitement for her mother, and when she noticed Severus was turning back and would see her, she stuck her face in her book again and continued her walk into the kitchen as nothing had happened.</p><p>Severus snorted softly at the sight, the girl not even paying attention to where she was going, absorbed in her reading. He noticed she had chosen Persuasion to start on. He smiled, watching her place the book on the island but not take her eyes off it while she reached to the fruit bowl in the center of the island and found an apple.</p><p>Hermione looked back to see what it was Severus admired, and smiled when she saw. “Rose, sweetie, you need to wash that first,” she said as the girl was taking the fruit to her lips absently, once again truly absorbed in her reading.</p><p>“Oh, right,” she looked up, finally, upon hearing her mother’s voice. She then looked to the sink, in front of which Severus stood. She became a little shy.</p><p>“Allow me,” he said, stretching out his hand to take the apple. She gave it willingly, with a smile, and Severus turned to wash it with a smile of his own.</p><p>“So, Miss Rose,” he said as he handed her the clean apple back, “I see you’ve chosen Persuasion to begin with. Excellent choice.” She had already read quite a bit of it, considering the time lapse from when she received it, and also the language level of Austen books. “How do you like it so far?”</p><p>“I like it. But Anne’s family is so mean to her! They made her give up this guy she liked and now she’s alone and stuck with them. And the guy, Wentworth, is related to the people that now live in her house, and is coming to visit. It’s such angst!”</p><p>Severus smirked a little. “Well, it will get better, I promise.”</p><p>“I hope so.” Rose was turning to leave, biting into her apple, and Hermione spoke.</p><p>“Uh-uh. Finish your apple here. You’ll get lost in the book and leave an unfinished apple lying somewhere in the house. That’s always a pleasant surprise.”</p><p>So Rose returned to the island and sat on one of the stools, reading and biting into her apple. Severus and Hermione returned to the work at hand, quietly, but Severus smiled, happy that Rose seemed to like his gift and wasn’t bothered by his presence. Hermione caught that and smiled too.</p><p>Rose finished her apple, throwing away the stem in the rubbish bin that was in a cabinet, next to where Severus stood. She then stopped beside him and stared up at him for a while. He tried to pretend he didn’t notice.</p><p> </p><p>“Severus?” Rose said sweetly, and something exploded in his heart.</p><p>“Yes?” he looked at her.</p><p>“Could you reach me a glass, please? In the cupboard.” She pointed to a cabinet next to his head, and he happily opened it and handed her a glass. “Thank you,” she smiled, and walked off to the fridge to get herself some water.</p><p>Once Rose walked out, Severus asked what else he could do to help Hermione. Everything seemed pretty much underway.</p><p>“Actually, could you… go check on Hugo? If you don’t mind? He’s awfully quiet, it’s not very much like him.”</p><p>Severus looked a bit uncertain.</p><p>“Or… you can put this chicken in the oven for me and I’ll go check on him,” she said.</p><p>“No, I can go. It’s alright.” He started to head off.</p><p>“Can you take him some fruit? He’s probably hungry.”</p><p>“Sure… apple?” Severus picked an apple from the fruit bowl.</p><p>“Doesn’t matter. He hates fruit. Just eats them because I tell him to. Just let me cut it up for him, he seems to eat better that way.” She was washing her hands to go to the apple slicing.</p><p>“I can do that, Herms,” he said tenderly and proceeded to washing the apple to them slice it up.</p><p>Severus walked about the downstairs of their home, looking for the little redheaded guy. He only found a little redheaded lady in the den, sitting on the window seat, immersed in her book.</p><p>“Rose?”</p><p>“Yes?” She looked up from her book</p><p>“Do you know where I can find your brother?”</p><p>“Upstairs in his room.”</p><p>“Thank you,” he said, and left her to her reading, much against his heart’s desire to just sit and learn everything he could about her, what he had missed in the last 10 years.</p><p>He found Hugo in his room, trying to put together both his Lego sets. They were extremely large, both of them, and he was very concentrated. Severus knocked on the open door.</p><p>“Sliced apple for a Mr. Hugo?” He tried to be acceptably friendly. He really didn’t know his way around children, not unless it was to be a harsh disciplinarian.</p><p>“I’m not hungry,” he said, not harshly or unkindly, just concentrated on his task.</p><p>“Well, your mum seems to think otherwise. Perhaps just a couple of slices?”</p><p>Hugo nodded slowly in acquiescence.</p><p>Severus sat down on the floor, across from the boy, leaving the plate with apple slices beside the kid.</p><p>“Need any help?” He asked as the boy stared at the early stages of the construction in between them.</p><p>“Sure,” the boy said.</p><p>“What troubles you, then?”</p><p>“I can’t figure out where this goes.” He held up a piece.</p><p>“May I?” Severus asked. The boy nodded and handed him the piece, and Severus took the instructions lying around the floor. “Ah, here we go,” he said after a quick glance at the instruction and the pieces already put together in front of him. “Right here.” He placed it there.</p><p>Hugo’s eyes lit up when he saw it made sense. He then began placing other pieces and Severus helped, handing him the pieces that were closest to him, neatly laid out around them, placing a few pieces himself, analyzing the instructions when Hugo got stuck. He also encouraged the boy to eat the apples, and he did take slices in between placing pieces.</p><p>They did this in relative silence for a little while. Until Severus finally felt more at ease to speak.</p><p>“So… you like building things?”</p><p>“Yes.” Hugo was more at ease too. “I wanted to be an engineer.”</p><p>“Do you not want to anymore?”</p><p>“Dad said I should do something in the wizarding world, because I’m a wizard,” the boy stated, saddened. “I should be an Auror. He doesn’t even like that I play with these.” Which is why the boy was enjoying the company and help and interest Severus showed. His father either didn’t care, or sat with him impatiently, as if forced to, and ended up taking over and doing it all without the boy’s help, and often magically, so it would be done with, sucking the fun out of it.</p><p>Severus rolled his eyes at Weasley’s utter stupidity. “Well, if you’ll be happy as a muggle engineer, you should do that. But there are wizard constructors as well.”</p><p>“There are?” The boy looked up at him with gleaming eyes.</p><p>“Yes. How do you think the buildings in Diagon Alley, or Hogwarts, were built?”</p><p>“Yeah. Makes sense.”</p><p>And so they built and talked a bit, and the boy started to warm up to him. Severus found out his favorite subject was transfiguration, and that he very much liked spy movies, of course.</p><p>“Is it true you were a spy in the war?” The boy asked shyly.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Was it cool?” He asked, with wonder in his eyes.</p><p>Severus sighed softly. “It wasn’t as… interesting as movies make it out to be. But I suppose it was… <em>cool</em> to have the feeling of performing my duty well, saving some people from getting hurt… being so good at it no one realized what I was doing.” Severus smiled softly.</p><p>“Did you jump from buildings, like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible?”</p><p>Severus smirked, amused at the boy’s amazement.</p><p>“Yes, there was a bit of that. Though being a wizard I did not need many of his trinkets.”</p><p>“And did people change faces, like those masks in the movies, to fool the enemy? Did you?”</p><p>“There was some of that too, yes. I never partook in it… your mother did though,” he whispered, smirking.</p><p>“Really??” The boy’s eyes went wide.</p><p>“Yes. Don’t tell her I told you, though.” He placed his index finger over his lips.</p><p>“How did she do it? Why?” The boy was whispering now.</p><p>“There’s a potion that does it. She needed to fool people into thinking she was one of the bad guys, so she could go into this woman’s vault in the bank and retrieve an item that was valuable to our victory.”</p><p>The boy was in awe of that, and Severs was happy they were creating some sort of connection.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione had already gone up to find them bonding and building together when she thought Severus was taking long. She smiled and retreated silently, never having been noticed, and only called up the stairs for them to come down when dinner was ready.</p><p>They came down, and Rose emerged from the den with her nose in the book. She sat at the table like that, and while Hermione and Severus took the food to the table, Hermione said “Rosie, what have we said about reading at the table?”</p><p>Rose closed her book and placed it on the vacant seat next to her. “Sorry, Mama.”</p><p>After serving themselves in silence, and digging in, Severus watched the kids, then looked to Hermione. She smiled, and squeezed his leg under the table, as she was sitting next to him.</p><p>“I think I’ll take the opportunity to get to know you a little more since I won’t interrupt your reading now, Miss Rose.” He smiled at her as she chewed. There was a pause. “I’ve learned that Mr. Hugo likes transfiguration and would like to be an engineer.” He looked fondly at Hugo, who was smiling shyly. “How about you? What is your favorite subject in Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Hmmm. I think I’d have to say… Potions, definitely.”</p><p>Severus almost chocked. He wondered if that time in his lab she probably didn’t even remember had anything to do with that. Hermione again caressed his leg, and he looked at her to see her smiling.</p><p>“You know that shop you like going to, Rose?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“The Potion shop? I like the smell. And to read what every potion does. I haven’t gotten through all of them yet.”</p><p>Severus couldn’t help but stifle a chuckle, that came out softly through his nose.</p><p>“Well, Severus owns it.”</p><p>Her eyes went wide. “Really?”</p><p>“Yes. And I can give you a copy of the instruction for each potion, if you like. That way you don’t have to stand in the shop reading them all.”</p><p>“Oh could you? I would like that, yes. Thank you.”</p><p>Severus smiled, pleased with himself that she took interest in something he could provide. It was something they could talk about forever, should she remain interested. “Hugo, you don’t like potions?”</p><p>He shrugged. “It’s hard.”</p><p>“Hugo has a bit of a hard time with it, and the professor,” Hermione said.</p><p>“Well, if you ever want my help, I’ll be happy to give it.”</p><p> </p><p>It was late evening and the time had come to go watch the fireworks. The little family of four walked down the street to a dark spot next to a vacant house. Hugo was already holding his mother’s hand, he had been as they walked down the street, so it seemed set he would be apparating with her.</p><p>“Care to ride with me, Rose?” He offered his hand. She looked to her mother, who nodded with a smile.</p><p>“Sure. But… I always get very nauseous. What helps is I cling to my mum.”</p><p>“Oh…” he started, thinking that was a polite way to decline his offer. He was about to say it was fine, he would be right behind them, when Rose stepped closer to him, took his hand, and wrapped her arm around his waist, her cheek pressed to his side. She wasn’t declining, she was just explaining.</p><p>His heart, not for the first time that day, filled with warmth and something fuzzy. Her hand, still small when compared to his but not quite as tiny as he remembered wrapping around his finger, made lovely memories flood his mind. He put his free hand on her back, securing her, and looked to Hermione, who held Hugo. She nodded once, smiling at his slightly shocked and pale face, and they both disapparated simultaneously.</p><p>They came up in a dark spot, behind some trees.</p><p>“Are you good?” Severus asked as Rose pried away from him.</p><p>“Yes!” She smiled. “Didn’t get nauseous at all this time.”</p><p>The kids walked excitedly ahead, though Hermione cautioned every two minutes that they stay close. Severus walked beside her, arm around her shoulders. They made their way through the crowd as best they could, and found a decent spot to stand at. Then they just talked for a bit, waiting for the moment.</p><p>Suddenly, people all around them started the countdown. When they hit one, Big Ben started to chime and fireworks lit up the skies. The kids looked up at it, amazed. And when they looked back at the adults that accompanied them that evening, they were kissing. Severus had one arm around Hermione’s shoulders, the other hand cupping her cheek, and one of her arms was around his waist and the other hand rested on his chest. Their lips were still locked, slowly tasting each other’s, when the siblings looked to one another. Rose giggled, and Hugo looked appalled.</p><p>“That’s disgusting,” he said, the grown-ups not even aware of what was happening, still lost in the kiss.</p><p>“It is not. Let them be.”</p><p>Hugo still looked disgusted.</p><p>“When have you ever seen mum smile as much as she has today?”</p><p>Hugo’s look changed into one of contemplation. “Never, I guess.”</p><p>“Exactly. And have you ever seen mum and dad snog like that?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“So, this is a good thing, yes? She likes him. She’s happy. And he’s nice!”</p><p>Hugo shrugged. “I guess.”</p><p>Big Ben’s chimes stopped and music started playing. Rose and Hugo started to dance, looking up at the bright lights in the sky as the couple behind them still tasted each other, completely in love and oblivious to the world around them.</p>
