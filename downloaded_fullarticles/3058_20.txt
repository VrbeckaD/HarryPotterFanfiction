    <p>Sirius was tired. This war was making old men of all of the Marauders, but Sirius deliberately took on the most dangerous missions. He didn’t know if he was more or less valued by the Order for it, but he knew that to him, his life mattered the least. So, yes, he would continue to take on the most dangerous missions, because then James and Peter at least wouldn’t. Remus he didn’t know about. He was secretive and moody all the time, gone for weeks on end. Sirius didn’t want to believe it about the young man he had always considered a brother, but he worried that he had gone over to the other side.</p>
<p>Just now, Sirius was in yet another small Muggle village, looking for pockets of Voldemort’s followers, tasked with finding them, spying on them, capturing them if possible, eliminating them if necessary. It was dangerous and not glamorous as he had thought it would be when he joined the Order. Mostly it was just lonely. He missed his friends, and he rarely saw James, Lily and Harry. They were the only family he had.</p>
<p>Yet, he wanted more, someday. A deep, light place inside him hoped that he could rise above his upbringing.</p>
<p>Lonely and bored but unable to sleep, Sirius grabbed his jacket and decided to venture to the only night spot in town, The Green Frog. It was a pub that served lunch and dinner, then had music and dancing after dinner hours. They were guaranteed all the business in town because they were the only place open after 7pm.</p>
<p>So Sirius went in and grabbed an empty stool, ordered a beer and turned to sit with his back to the bar, leaning back a bit, the picture of cool aloofness with a touch of elegance. He always got looks, and he always got laid when he tried, though he didn’t try as often as he once had.</p>
<p>Tonight he wasn’t planning to try. He didn’t feel that kind of lonely. He just wanted to see other people, to see the people he was working to save. He knew that he would never know any of them, not really. But sometimes the loneliness made him feel the need to put faces to the endless missions; he needed to remember that there was more than just a fight – there was a cause.</p>
<p>As he sipped his beer and looked through the faces, his eyes went past and then came back to one in particular.</p>
<p>
  <em>Looking out my window, an angel enrobed</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Appeared and nearly tore me apart</em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>You were there with friends for a birthday gathering, but you weren’t much in the mood to celebrate. You hadn’t been in the mood since your fiance had left you for another woman.</p>
<p>It had been over a year and your friends had been supportive in the beginning, but most of them had drifted away as you hadn’t just “moved on.” Honestly, part of you wanted to move on, but the bigger part was afraid to ever trust any man again. You understood the logic that said that you could never be happy if you never took a chance, but you couldn’t get hurt if you didn’t take chances, either.</p>
<p>So you were the one who sat at the table and watched purses while everyone else went and danced. They were on the prowl, after all. You weren’t. What was the point of prowling when you knew all of the available “prey?” Every guy out there was either at school with you or one of your siblings. You knew them. They weren’t going to be the ones to make you take a chance.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sirius watched you a while longer, sipping his beer and imagining why a beautiful bird like you would be alone. The other girls you were out with were pretty enough, he supposed, but you were objectively a rare beauty. Sirius was a connoisseur, after all.</p>
<p>How were you alone? Why were you so sad?</p>
<p>Then the rest of the girls at the table jumped up to go to the dance floor. Abba had that effect on people, he supposed. You had simply nodded at them when they asked if you were sure you didn’t mind, a smile pasted on your face that didn’t reach your eyes.</p>
<hr/>
<p>You told yourself that you had done your co-workerly duty and you would leave as soon as someone came back to the table. You were rarely in the mood to go out drinking, and tonight was no exception. What was the point? You watched your friends as they went through the ridiculous motions of trying to land a man. You felt detached, like you were writing an article for National Geographic. The female of the species, unlike every other member of the animal kingdom, decorates herself and moves about in what they hope the male of the species finds to be an alluring dance in this never-ending mating ritual.</p>
<p>You snickered a bit at your internal joke, then wondered if that was a sign that perhaps you spent a bit too much time alone and in your head. Blimey, maybe your friends were right? Maybe it was time to return to the world.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sirius was watching you as much as he could without looking like a complete creep. He had seen the sadness, irritation and and loneliness flash brief across your features as you watched your friends dance, but then there was a flash of a smile that disappeared again quickly.</p>
<p>But, Merlin, in those seconds that smile had lit up your already beautiful features into absolutely the most gorgeous face he had ever seen.</p>
<p>He wanted to talk to you. But he had to leave town. It wouldn’t be fair to either of you to start something that you couldn’t follow through with…</p>
<p>
  <em>A million miles of freedom, a million miles of road<br/>But I still don’t know where to start</em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sirius shook his head and turned back to the bar. Yet his eyes returned to you over and over, finding your face in the mirror behind the bottles lined up within easy reach of the bartender, just waiting to help Sirius forget.</p>
<p>In one of the times he caught himself looking, he saw you smile and shake your head no politely. Sirius turned around to see what was happening and was halfway across the room before it even registered in his head what he was doing.</p>
<hr/>
<p>“I said, no thank you, George. I need to be going home soon.”</p>
<p>“C’mon, Y/N, you’ve said no to all the lads. People are goin’ t’start thinkin’ you like birds instead of blokes!” the unpleasant fellow said loudly.</p>
<p>You were irritated. George had been a nuisance since primary school. This wasn’t the first time he had suggested you didn’t like men simply because you didn’t like him.</p>
<p>“The lady doesn’t seem to be interested,” came a voice that was loud enough to be heard but low enough to be all business.</p>
<p>“Piss off, mate. This don’t concern you,” George growled, turning his bulk toward the voice.</p>
<p>Sirius was a bit shorter and a lot lighter than George. He wasn’t intimidated, though. He had known plenty of halfwits like this one who might have been solid at school, but now he had gone to fat. His once muscular chest now resided around his waist, hanging over his belt.</p>
<p>Sirius had met men like this in his travels quite often, unfortunately. In the smaller villages like this one, everyone knew everyone and a stranger was marked immediately. Sirius was handsome, girls looked at him, he slept with them occasionally. This did not endear him to the local males, ergo he’d had to prove his ‘manhood’ more than once, and without magic.</p>
<p>Yet he had also been in battles with Death Eaters, and the stakes in those fights were too high to let male posturing take him out of the fight. Needless to say, George didn’t intimidate Sirius. He had seen so much worse that the Georges of the world didn’t even give Sirius pause.</p>
<p>You looked at the new guy. You had noticed him, of course, he was the epitome of male beauty. Beyond that, however, you were actually attracted to him. That simply had not happened since Trevor had left you. It was… exhilarating.</p>
<p>And terrifying.</p>
<p>“George, I promised to dance with him if this song came on,” you lied to defuse the situation. It certainly wasn’t because you wanted to dance with him.</p>
<p>Sirius looked at you with surprise but held out his hand, not looking a gift horse in the mouth. “Milady.”</p>
<p>You took his hand and let him guide you to the dance floor, your friends’ looking shocked as you began to sway to “Wonderful Tonight” by Eric Clapton.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the dance,” Sirius said quietly, leaning close to your ear, his warm breath tickling your neck.</p>
<p>You leaned back a bit to put some distance between you. “I was just trying to avoid trouble between you and George.”</p>
<p>“Still. I noticed you earlier and wanted to talk to you but you’re a bit intimidating,” he said with a smile.</p>
<p>You blushed a bit and looked down. “Pshaw, intimidating my arse.”</p>
<p>Sirius shrugged. “You’re the prettiest girl here. I saw you turn down half the blokes in the place and the rest just couldn’t get up the gumption to ask you. I didn’t think I’d fare any better.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t come to dance or find someone to go home with. My coworkers guilted me into coming or I’d be at home watching telly,” you said with a small smile.</p>
<p>Sirius quoted one of Lily’s Mum’s favorite movies, Casablanca, and said, “My lucky night then. ‘Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, eh?’”</p>
<p>You smiled at the reference. “You’re a Bogart fan, then?”</p>
<p>Sirius shook his head a bit and said, “One of my mate’s Mum loves that movie, so I’ve seen it a few times.”</p>
<p>“So, are you new in town?” you asked.</p>
<p>“Just passing through,” he said quietly, almost seeming regretful.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. Well, like I said, I wasn’t looking for someone to go home with, so you should probably ask one of my work mates to dance.”</p>
<p>“We can at least finish the dance, though, can’t we? I was about to sing to you,” he said with a wink.</p>
<p>You narrowed your eyes at him. “Did you expect that shite to work?” you asked in an incredulous voice.</p>
<p>Sirius leaned forward and sang, “My darling, you were wonderful tonight.”</p>
<p>You laughed and he joined you. “Aye I’ll give you that. There are at least three lasses at my table that would have her tongue down your throat by now. Want me to point you at them?”</p>
<p>He laughed and shook his head at you. “No, I’d like to know your name, though. Mine is Sirius, by the way.”</p>
<p>“Sirius. Like the star?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said with a smile.</p>
<p>“My name is Y/N, but you’re really not getting into my knickers, Sirius,” you said quietly.</p>
<p>“Well, Wonderful Y/N, I wasn’t looking for a shag tonight.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?” you asked skeptically. “What were you looking for then?”</p>
<p>Sirius looked down. “I’ve been traveling for a  while, and I guess I’m lonely.”</p>
<p>“In my experience, when a man says he’s lonely, he’s usually looking for a shag.”</p>
<p>He had no idea why he was about to bare his soul to you, but he looked into your eyes and replied, “No. I’m not looking for a shag. I’m looking for more.”</p>
<p>“More what?” you whispered.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but when I saw you earlier, I thought that you might be able to help me find it,” he whispered back.</p>
<p>You stared into his pale eyes for a moment before you realized that you had stopped dancing, there was a faster song on and your friends were hooting at you from the table. “I have to get home,” you said, pulling away from Sirius.</p>
<p>“Can we just…talk? For a little bit?” he asked, almost desperately.</p>
<p>You considered him for a moment and then nodded and took his hand, leading him to an empty table by way of your friends’ table where you grabbed your purse.</p>
<p>Sirius went up to the bar and got drinks for you both, returning to sit down across from you.</p>
<p>You talked for hours. You had been ready to leave when he asked you to dance at about 9:30 – you looked up when the bartender announced last call and looked around to see that your co-workers had gone and there were only a few regulars clinging to their barstools.</p>
<p><em>“Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life</em><br/>I’ve been trying to find my place in this world”<br/>I said to her, “Baby, baby, baby, I’ve got all night<br/>To listen to the heart of a girl”</p>
<p>“I really need to go home now,” you said.</p>
<p>“Can I call you? If I…if I come back this way?”</p>
<p>“I dunno. You deftly managed to avoid answering my questions whenever I asked why you were here. For all I know you have a wife or two and a dozen kids,” you speculated.</p>
<p>He paused a moment, choosing his words carefully. “I suppose I am an undercover agent of sorts. There’s a very bad guy that the organization I work for is trying to find. I travel around and look for people who work for him.”</p>
<p>“What a load of shite!” you exclaimed. “Am I meant to believe you’re Black, Sirius Black? Are you on Her Majesty’s Secret Service, then?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly,” he said with a half smile. “Look, I really can’t tell you anymore. But, I promise, I’m not married, never have been, no kids.”</p>
<p>You looked at him for a moment and swore you saw sincerity in his eyes. “I almost believe you.”</p>
<p>“I swear it’s true.”</p>
<p>You pulled a pen from your handbag and wrote your number on a cocktail napkin and handed it to him, figuring you’d never hear from him again.</p>
<p>Which you were quite surprised to find actually made you a bit sad.</p>
<p><em>She wrote her number down</em><br/>And she gave it to me<br/>They had to scrape me off the floor </p>
