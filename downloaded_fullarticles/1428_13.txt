  <b></b></p><p>The ding of the door chime startled her out of her thoughts. Hermione looked up from the papers strewn on her table for one and was surprised to see a woman in a wedding dress. She almost looked away, unconcerned, but there was something about the woman’s frantic hand motions that made her pause. Then a sob escaped the woman’s mouth and she turned around, her eyes darting around the café as though desperate for some escape. </p><p>Hermione gasped softly, but the woman heard her. Their eyes met, and Hermione’s main thought was that Pansy Parkinson didn’t look a day older than she had at her trial, six years before. Relief, then doubt, skipped through her eyes and she bit her lip. Hermione could see tears threatening to fall.  The two women stared at each other for a few seconds; then Hermione motioned for Pansy to join her.</p><p>For a moment, she hesitated, then hurried over and slunk into the chair across from Hermione, slouching down as though trying to avoid being seen.</p><p>“The wedding dress is a bit of draw, you know,” Hermione said dryly.</p><p>Pansy glared at her, then promptly burst into tears. </p><p>Hermione felt a little bad, and when Pansy had calmed a bit, she said, “So… do you want to talk about it?” </p><p>Pansy huffed, scowled, then bit her lip, her eyes welling with tears again. “I… not… Not really.”</p><p>Hermione nodded and returned to her papers. She’d been at the café for an hour reading reports for work. It was something she did occasionally on the weekend. </p><p>“I just couldn’t marry him,” Pansy blurted out. “My parents found this… Polish prince, or something, and he was amazing on parchment, but there was no spark between us, no interest. I tried, I really did, but when I saw him there, standing under the bonding tree, a blank expression on his face, I turned around and ran.” She paused to blow her nose.</p><p>Hermione waited. She had heard of Pansy’s illustrious New Year’s Day wedding, though of course she hadn’t been invited. It wasn’t as though they were friends. They were cordial when they happened to meet, which was very rare. Harry had testified at her trial—at the trials of all his fellow Hogwarts students—in an attempt to keep as many of them out of prison as possible. It was his belief that forgiveness, not punishment, would go further to heal the wizarding world. So far, Hermione agreed with him. The six years since the end of the war had been a peaceful time, with Harry leading the way by example. He’d befriended many of his former enemies, or at least extended a hand toward them—even Pansy, who, during the Final Battle, had wanted to turn him over to Voldemort. Hermione and Ron had gone along with Harry’s plan, but had never tried to befriend anyone from Slytherin. Ginny had been dating Blaise Zabini for two years, though, so he had been grudgingly accepted into their circle. That hadn’t been too difficult, once it was clear how he felt about Ginny. Plus, he had always been different from most of them, had never been ambitious in wanting to rid the world of anybody he didn’t agree with. </p><p>From all accounts in the Daily Prophet and Witch Weekly, Pansy was madly in love with the Polish prince—an actual prince!—but Hermione could tell that the woman in front of her was anything but. She felt a mild twinge of sympathy for her. </p><p>“My parents will never understand,” Pansy continued. “They don’t seem to care how I feel about the matter. They just want me married off to someone rich and preferably from another country. I’d have had to move to Poland!” Her eyes flashed desperately. “I couldn’t do that! All my friends are here, everything I’ve known is here! Now, maybe if I loved him, I could do it, but….” She trailed off, then grabbed Hermione’s wrist and stared at her imploringly. “I don’t love him. So I… I shouldn’t have to marry him, right?” It was as though she needed permission from somebody to say what she was saying. </p><p>Hermione tried to give her a comforting smile. “Of course not. No one should be forced into a marriage without their his or her consent.”</p><p>Pansy let out a full-body sigh of relief, and her shoulders slumped. “Thank you,” she whispered. “I don’t know what to do.” She dropped her head onto her arms on the table.</p><p>“Why don’t you write your parents a letter?” Hermione suggested. Pansy glanced up at her with a skeptical expression. “It’s something I do, sometimes, when I need to get my thoughts out clearly and doing it in person is daunting.”</p><p>At that moment, another door chime sounded, and Hermione glanced up to see Draco Malfoy, in full dress robes, glancing methodically around the room. When his gaze met hers and he saw Pansy, he headed straight for them. Hermione knew that Pansy hadn’t been about to marry Malfoy, but she thought she saw in his eyes that he would try to talk his friend into the union. Hermione squared her shoulders and prepared to repel him, but as he came nearer, his expression softened.</p><p>“Pansy,” he said gently, reaching out to touch her shoulder but thinking better of it. </p><p>She raised her head, and Hermione saw her face streaked with fresh tears. “Draco?”</p><p>He smiled kindly, and Hermione was struck by the look on his face. She’d never seen him appear so tender, so open. “Are you all right?” </p><p>She shook her head, and Hermione thought she might start crying again, but instead she sat up straight and wiped her eyes. “I can’t marry him, Draco.”</p><p>He Summoned a chair from another table and sat beside her to look into her eyes. After searching them for a moment, he sighed. “I know. But what will you do now? Your parents… your father is livid. He’s convinced he can find you and change your mind.”</p><p>Pansy set her jaw and gave Draco a fierce look. “I can’t. I won’t marry him; I will not spend my life with someone I don’t love.”</p><p>Draco reached up and wiped a tear from her cheek. “I’m not here to try and bring you back. I wanted to find you before someone else did. Many are looking, and your father is… unreasonable. I won’t let anybody take you. Though I doubt anyone would look here.”</p><p>Pansy smiled very slightly. “I was looking for somewhere, anywhere, where I felt I could be safe, and I saw Hermione sitting here and I knew, I just knew, that she would understand.”</p><p>Draco blinked, then looked at Hermione, as though he hadn’t even seen her before. Hermione felt inexplicably sad as she watched his walls fall into place. The rare instance where he had been so vulnerable in front of her had been charming to observe. “Granger,” he said mechanically. </p><p>Hermione gave him a slight smile. “Malfoy.”</p><p>He stared at her hard for an instant, then turned back to Pansy. “What are you going to do now?”</p><p>“I don’t know!” she whined, dropping her face into her hands. “Whenever I gave any indication of not being completely thrilled at the prospect of marrying Jakob, my father got angry and threatened to disown me if I didn’t comply! And now that I’ve so very publicly embarrassed him, he’ll never forgive me. Oh, Draco, he’ll make me leave home! I have nowhere to go! What’s going to happen to me?”</p><p>“You’re going to be fine,” Hermione said firmly, a strong feeling of sisterly protection coming over her. </p><p>They both looked at her, Draco with a calculating look, Pansy with a hint of hope. “You think so?” she asked timidly.</p><p>“Absolutely. You can stay with me; I’ve got an extra room.” It was out of her mouth before she’d really thought about it. </p><p>Pansy’s mouth dropped open, and Draco’s eyes went wide. “With… you?” she said, obviously surprised by the offer.</p><p>“Sure,” Hermione affirmed. “You can stay with me until you figure things out. I’ll help however I can.”</p><p>Draco’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Why?”</p><p>“Because she shouldn’t have to marry someone she doesn’t want to, and she needs a path open to her that gives her room to think and breathe and plan her own life. If she doesn’t have a soft place to land, she’ll feel like her only option is to do what they tell her to do.” Hermione had always had a strong desire for justice, and this situation was no less deserving than any other. </p><p>Draco’s expression softened. “That’s true.” He turned to Pansy. “You can always stay with me.”</p><p>“No,” she said resolutely. “I know your parents are… different… but how do I know they won’t try to get me to go home? Or tell my parents where I am?”</p><p>“They won’t,” he insisted. “You know their views on this kind of thing.”</p><p>Hermione was instantly very curious about the Malfoys but felt it best not to interrupt.</p><p>“Yes, but I don’t trust them to shelter me from my family. The pressures from another high and mighty wizarding family would be hard to ignore,” Pansy said defiantly. “I’m not staying with you. I’ll stay with Hermione.”</p><p>“You sure about this?” Draco asked Hermione with an intense look.</p><p>“Of course,” she replied, though now she was starting to think through what she had offered. Pansy would suddenly be present in her daily life. It was highly probable she didn’t know anything about living in the real world outside of her parents’ protection and provision, to say nothing of living with someone whose Muggle parents visited regularly. What had she gotten herself into? Before she could think herself out of it, she continued. “We can go right now and get you set up.”</p><p>Pansy’s eyes lit up. “Yeah?”</p><p>Hermione smiled. “Absolutely.”</p><p> </p>

  <p>oOo</p>
</center>Five hours later, Pansy was completely moved in. The closet had required expanding—Hermione couldn’t believe how many pairs of shoes Pansy felt she needed. Pansy had made a fire call to her parents and told them she couldn’t marry Jakob. They promised to cut her off completely, and within an hour of the end of the call, Pansy received an owl saying that her vault access at Gringotts had been revoked. She had cried a little, but resolved to find a job the next day. Finally, exhausted physically and emotionally, she’d gone to bed right after dinner.<p>Hermione’s home was a simple, two-bedroom, one-bathroom flat. The door opened onto a small entry area that led directly to the kitchen, which was open to a generous living room area. The two bedrooms both had doors off the living room with a fireplace between, and there was a large bay window at the back. By crawling through a window, one gained access to a small, railed patio.</p><p>Draco was helping Hermione clean up, restoring her main living space to what it had been before Pansy moved in. The living room had a sofa and an armchair arranged around a coffee table, with the sofa opposite the fireplace. </p><p>“You really don’t have to stay,” Hermione insisted. It wasn’t that Draco was entirely unpleasant, and she truly wanted to catch up with him, but she was ready to be alone so that she could process everything that had happened and make a plan for the immediate future. </p><p>He shrugged. “It’s almost done.” </p><p>Hermione ended up in the kitchen, and as she wiped the last crumb off the counter, she noticed a bottle of wine. “I can thank you with a drink,” she said. “Would you like wine? Or Ron might have left a beer somewhere.” </p><p>Draco was surprised, but he nodded. “Beer, please.” Hermione got him one from the refrigerator, a wine glass and the bottle, and joined him in the living room. She sat on the floor by the coffee table, poured herself a glass, and leaned back against a chair, closing her eyes and savoring the first swallow. She heard the pop of Draco opening his beer.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re all right with me coming to dinner tomorrow?” Draco asked softly after they’d been quiet for a few minutes.</p><p>She smiled. “Of course. Though I suspect we’ll have more than just us three.”</p><p>“Oh?” </p><p>“Harry and Ron live across the hall,” she explained. “I see them quite a lot, and they come by for meals. Every Friday night we have a big dinner to start the weekend. Though, I don’t really expect them on a Sunday night. But maybe. You never know who will stop by. Ginny usually only comes Friday nights with Blaise.”</p><p>“I’ve heard him mention it,” Draco commented. </p><p>Blaise and Ginny had been together for almost two years, though Hermione had always felt like he was holding back when he was around them. Hermione poured herself a little more wine. “He’s one of the group now, I suppose. Oh, and Luna.”</p><p>Draco nodded thoughtfully. “Well, I’ll survive one dinner. Won’t I?”</p><p>Hermione chuckled. “I think, given what we’ve all been through already, we can get through one meal.”</p><p>They were silent again for a long while before Draco spoke again. “Thank you. I mean it. For taking her in like this. Considering the history between you…. Nobody would have expected it of you. But I believe you can give her something that I never could: life outside of our circles. I think she’ll do well, once she adjusts.”</p><p>“Of course she will,” said Hermione firmly. “Pansy is strong, though she might not know just how strong yet. Leaving her wedding today was huge! I’m so glad she did. And my history with her isn’t rosy by any means, but it’s better than some.” She meant him, of course, among others, even though they’d patched things up shortly after his trial.</p><p>“Have you thought about how this affects your life?” he asked, glancing at her sideways. “You not only have Pansy living with you now, but she and I are… close. She’s like a sister to me. I don’t want to lose that.”</p><p>Hermione smiled. “I think I can handle it. You and I have worked together in the past. It wasn’t terrible. We were even… dare I say it… friends. Life will be different, but what is life without change? I’m not usually good at such abrupt change, but this feels right. At least tonight. Ask me again in a week, and I might have something new to say!” </p><p>Draco took a drink, then looked at her appraisingly. “Do you remember fourth year?”</p><p>She looked at him curiously, surprised by the abrupt change in topic. “Yes, vividly. It was the year Voldemort returned,” she answered quietly. </p><p>“Before that,” he said with a quick shake of his head. </p><p>She thought a moment. “I remember you feeding Rita Skeeter information that she could twist in order to write a slew of lies about a lot of people I cared about.”</p><p>He laughed, to Hermione’s surprise. “Yes, well, we both know I was a wretched little arse.” Hermione laughed too, thankful that he hadn’t taken offense. “I’m thinking more specifically of the Yule Ball,” he said, a strange note to his voice. He didn’t look at her, instead frowning slightly at something on the table. </p><p>Hermione smiled while her mind played pictures from that memorable night. “It was a magical evening. I had so much fun. It was the first time I really let myself just have fun.”</p><p>“You went with Viktor Krum,” Draco remarked, absently rubbing at the label on his bottle. “Everybody was stunned.”</p><p>Hermione snorted. “I was the only girl who treated him like a person,” she remarked. “And Ron was too much of a coward to ask me, so he ended up making an arse of himself with Padma Patil. I know it was the first time he really thought of me as a girl.”</p><p>He didn’t respond right away. “Weasley wasn’t the only one. I remember seeing you enter with Krum. I couldn’t take my eyes off you; I thought you were the most beautiful girl in the room.” The way he said it was light, matter-of-fact. “I thought about you a lot after that night.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, ignoring the strange discomfort caused by his proclamation. “Probably thought of more ways you could make fun of me.” </p><p>“Oh, no,” he said with a low chuckle. “In all the ways a fourteen-year-old boy thinks about a beautiful girl.”</p><p>Hermione felt her cheeks redden. “Are you saying you had feelings for me?”</p><p>Draco shrugged and cleared his throat, not meeting her eyes. “I wouldn’t put it quite like that, but as I said, I was fourteen. It was complicated. I’m guessing you had no idea.”</p><p>“No!” she exclaimed in astonishment. “How could I? You were too good at being a right little beast to me!” How could he possibly have had any sort of feelings that weren’t disgust for her at any point in their childhood? He’d been raised to believe that people like her weren’t worth the air they breathed. </p><p>He laughed and drained what was left in his bottle. “Too right. I was such an arse. Well, I should go,” he said abruptly, standing up. “Thanks for the drink. I’ll see you tomorrow night.”</p><p>Hermione scrambled to her feet and followed him to the door. “Yes, tomorrow. Dinner.”</p><p>Draco was in the hallway before he turned around, giving her a quick smile. “Good night.”</p><p>“Night,” she said dully, closing the door.</p><p> </p><p>
