    <p>Chapter one: Rebuilding</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny was no longer sure how many days had passed since the end of the battle. Her grief for lost friends, for Fred, kept a hold of her and stopped her from thinking about the passing of time beyond sleeping, waking and eating. 

She was desperately trying to hold herself together drawing strength from her mother’s example. Her unstoppable mother who had wept beside Fred’s lifeless body, expelling all her raw grief, until she had no more tears to shed. 

She had turned all her formidable energy on looking after her surviving children, George and Percy in particular as they were walking around like shells of their former selves. 

All of them looked like they were barely holding it together, the thinnest of parchment paper away from breaking down completely once more.

 But they were here, the Weasley survivors were all together, relatively whole apart from the empty space in their hearts, in one place as a family, Hermione and Harry included in that.</p>
<p><br/>
She had shared her grief with Hermione, they had sat together in her dorm room away from the watching strangers and tried to talk to each other about what had just happened. 

But the more they had tried to speak about emotions that were still so new and raw, the more both of them had struggled to find any words, until they ended up weeping on each other’s shoulders, until they were sick of crying.

  It had been good for them, Hermione said she had been seriously missing female company without even realising it. Ginny had desperately wanted to ask her about Harry, and what the three of them had been doing, but she could not seem to find the right way to ask. 

    Hermione was changed too, she was quiet and less confident, and she never strayed too far from Ron’s side. All three of them looked so much thinner, and there had not been much of poor Harry before they all disappeared from Bill and Fleur’s wedding.</p>
<p><br/>
If she was struggling to cope with her emotions about those who had been lost, it was nothing compared to the confusing swirl of feelings she was experiencing about a certain black haired boy. 

    Harry was in a daze Ginny could see it, they all could really. He did eat, when food was offered to him, but only the bare minimum. Her mum had tried to put second helpings, or deserts in front of him but they would not be touched. 

    There were a couple of times she had seen the tiny frame of Kreacher bring Harry food in person, as if he did not trust the plate would get to his master.</p>
<p><br/>
He sat looking at nothing, and not protesting, while Madam Pomfrey attended to his many wounds, the only thing he refused to drink right then was the sleep potion, Ron had taken it and assured Madame Pomfrey that Harry would take it later. 

He didn’t really talk, no more than the bare minimum to answer questions. He didn’t smile, but that was not really a surprise, nobody was, despite the fact they had won. 

He just sat or stood wherever he was put. She had asked Ron if he was taking care of washing himself and Ron just shook his head slightly, frowning in worry for his friend. Harry was clean though, the clothes he had been wearing when the trio had arrived at Hogwarts had long been discarded. The clean clothes still hung off his too thin frame, and his clothes had never really fit him properly anyway, apart from his school robes. 

Ginny had realised it must be Ron looking after him. Ron who looked like he was taking on the burdens of both his friends, who had become so much older in the months since she had last seen them at the wedding. He stood straighter, and spoke with a calm authority, he held his own against his brothers, whose attitude towards him had also changed in response. Gone was the surly unsure teenager, he was a man now, and even Ginny could see it.

  His way of dealing with things was similar to their mother, he needed to take care of Hermione and Harry, although it seemed to be working so much better for Hermione. They would smile shyly at each other like they hadn’t known each other for the past seven years, and sit or stand with their hands interlocked. 

Ginny was happy they had finally figured some things out, it was about time, however it did make her long for the same thing. 

It was seeing Ron take control, and Harry looking so lost, that snapped Ginny out of her own grief fuelled haze.</p>
<p><br/>
“Is he sleeping ok?” She asked Ron one morning, she didn’t need to tell him who ‘he’ was. Her gaze never strayed too far if they were in the same room. 

   They were still at Hogwarts, helping to make the building safe and make sure that every body was found. 
It was hard work but Ginny found comfort in having a purpose, all be it a grim and difficult one. She did not know when they were all going to go home. Arthur was going to the burrow with Bill to check it out later that day. She waited expectantly for her brother to answer her question.</p>
<p><br/>
   Ron was shovelling food into himself as if he hadn’t had a decent meal in weeks while watching Hermione take slow bites of her toast as she sat beside him, her body leaning against his tall frame, and occasionally glancing down the table where Harry sat closest to the doors eating almost mechanically. 

    Ginny didn’t know what to do with her feelings for him right now, she desperately wanted him to comfort her, to lose herself in his soft kisses, his strong arms, she also wanted to hit him round the head in hopes it would snap him out of his state.

 But most of all she felt the need to look after him, to let him know she was still here for him, that she still wanted to be his Ginny. 

Ron watched her watching Harry.</p>
<p><br/>
“He’s having nightmares.” Then looking down at Hermione added. “We all are, but his are so much worse. Madame Pomfrey says he’s in serious shock, and we need to be patient with him.” He seemed to take a moment then to consider his words, almost like he was reluctant to say them. 

“He needs you Ginny, there is only so much Hermione and myself can do for him. We can’t give him the kind of support he needs right now. The only time he looks more like himself is when he notices you.” Of all the people she would have guessed would encourage her back to Harry, the last person she would have thought of was Ron.</p>
<p>He had grown and he had seen things, probably done things, he knew his friend was broken, and perhaps Ginny could be the one to bring him back. 

    Harry who had given everything it was possible to give, never running from his duty, or the responsibilities piled on him. 

Who had sacrificed his happiness in the hope it would keep her safer, and deep down wanted nothing more than a normal life. Did that life still include her? 

    Ron seemed to realise her surprise at his words. “I know I was hard on him when you kissed on his birthday. I didn’t want you to get your hopes up, but watching him these past months, I know how much he cares for you. I thought that because I was your brother it was my job to hate any bloke who came near you on principle, but I’ve realised a few things since then.” he looked down at Hermione again with such a soppy smile on his face she almost teased him about it, but she couldn’t as he was being so honest with her, and for the first time in her life she felt the need to tell her brother honestly as well.</p>
<p><br/>
“I love you, Ron. I’m very lucky to call you my brother.” Then she added as she stood up. “But if you think I’m ever going to admit to telling you that, you can think again.” He managed a weak smile for her and a softy spoken “love you too Ginny.” Before she bundled up her courage and turned her attention towards Harry, and he back to Hermione who was looking back at him with a matching smile.</p>
<p><br/>
She sat down beside Harry and took his hand without looking at him, she tried to calm herself down and play it as casually as possible. She watched him look down at their interlocked fingers, noticed the hint of an upward twitch of his lips.</p>
<p>“I think you need some air,” she informed him and stood up still holding his hand. He followed her meekly as she walked them out into the grounds and to their tree down by the black lake. 

Nobody stopped them, she didn’t see any of her other brothers or parents to tell them where she was going, but Ron knew. He would tell them if he needed to. 

   The sun was trying its best to shine through the clouds, although not warm it was comfortable enough to sit outside. 

The dementors were still a danger but the mists did seem to be thinning, and the weather was getting back to where it should be for May. 

Ginny summoned a blanket and laid it down, then added a cushioning charm for good measure. She motioned for him to sit and he did, staring out across the black lake looking at nothing in particular. 

She just stood there for a moment, watching him not sure exactly what to say or do. Harry solved this for her by reaching up and pulling her down to sit beside him with her back to his chest, he wrapped his arms around her waist and put his chin on her shoulder his lips so close to her ear she could feel his warm breath. 

    He was taking big deep breaths, like he used to when they would sit here before, a lifetime ago. He used to tell her he could happily sit like this forever and lose himself in the smell of her hair, he always loved playing with her hair. She sat there silently with him, just enjoying the feel of his arms around her, his chest against her back, feeling more at peace than she had done in a very long time. Being in his arms was like coming home. He was alive, breathing, his heart beating so close to her own. No longer with the threat of a dark wizard over his head. 
    
She didn’t know how long they sat for, it felt like hours, and mere moments, but nobody disturbed them, almost as if they had put up wards to keep everyone away. She was content to just sit with him for now, hoping that he would talk when he was ready to, knowing that being here together was enough. 

His breathing was calm and even as she wondered if he had fallen asleep, but his head was no heavier on her shoulder. Her mind wandered to her family and the loss she had been refusing to acknowledge, she allowed herself to feel the grief that was always just under the surface, the relief of being alive, and the guilt. 

The tears came once again. She tried to hide it from him but when her shoulders started to shake she, was forced to take shuddering gasps of air that he would surely notice. 

   She hated crying, she was not a weepy person, and she hated looking so vulnerable in front of anyone, she wiped the tears away angrily. He had lifted his head from her shoulder at the first shudder, she tried to turn her head away from him, to hide her weakness, but he held her chin and made her look at him, he had tears in his eyes too.</p>
<p><br/>
“I’m so sorry Gin.” He croaked, his voice raw from little use. “I can’t tell you how truly sorry I am. I’ve been selfish, and wallowing in my own darkness. I don’t deserve you.” He squeezed his eyes shut, but opened them again quickly as if he didn’t like what he saw behind the lids. 

“I am so tired, I feel broken, and I don’t know how to put myself back together.” He held her close again as he spoke, so her head now rested against his chest. “There was a darkness inside me that I couldn’t control, didn’t know it was there. I didn’t find out until just before I went into the forest exactly what it was.” Her mind screamed to ask questions but she forced herself not to interrupt him. 

  “I want to tell you everything, I’m just worried that once you hear it you might not think so well of me.” He slid a hand through his hair in a warmly familiar gesture of his frustration. “For the first time in my life I can go anywhere I want. There are no expectations on me, and I don’t know what to do with that. The only thing I know I want, more than anything, is to be with you.” He slid his fingers through her hair, looping it behind her ear. 
“I’ve been watching everything happen around me through a thick fog, and there you were like the sun, burning through it.” He managed a weak smile for her then. “I’ve been so busy focusing on defeating him, I’ve not really had any thought beyond that. Perhaps some vague dream of a house with children laughing and you smiling at me.” Now that he had started to talk it was almost like he couldn’t stop, his thoughts coming in disjointed phrases. 

“I want to tell you everything, I really do, but I need to order my thoughts, and I need to get away from here.” The look he gave her then said so many things to her he did not need to say. He wanted them to spend time together, as a couple, but he was guilty about those feelings. It told her without words just how much he needed her, and how much he wanted to be there for her. “I need to find someplace to live I suppose. Grimmauld place has too many ghosts.”</p>
<p><br/>
“Mum will want you at the Burrow, with us.” It was the first thing she had said since they had sat down, his face looked conflicted once more.<br/>
“I will stay, for a while.” He conceded. “But I need my own space. I need to have something that is completely mine. Someplace without any old memories. I love your family but I don’t want to intrude…” she cut him off sharply.</p>
<p><br/>
“You know you are not intruding, you are as much part of this family as the rest of us. Mum will not be happy if you go off on your own. Mum needs us to be close right now. You are included in that.” She modified her tone slightly when she saw his panicked face.

 “I suppose if you need space then of course find a place, I can understand the need. And we will just make sure you keep mum sweet with frequent visits.” She leaned over to him and kissed him gently on the lips, a soft kiss full of promise for a future together, it took a great deal of willpower on her part to pull away as he tried to intensify it, trying to control her own thoughts and urges. 
She smiled inwardly at his small huffy sigh, there was her Harry. “We all need time to find out how this new world will be for us, and how we all fit.” 
She didn’t want to think about Fred and the others they had lost but the thought hung heavy in the air. All she really wanted was to be with him. Realising he thought pulling away from him was a rejection she leaned in to kiss him again, and this time she didn’t end it prematurely.</p>
<p><br/>
It was Charlie who found them, still under the tree both fast asleep, Ginny’s head resting on Harry’s shoulder, and looking very peaceful. It was a shame to wake them but under instruction from their mother he had no choice. He touched Ginny’s arm who stirred immediately, causing Harry’s eyes to snap open.<br/>
“Dad and Bill are back from the Burrow. They have news.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>0O0</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bill Apparated to his family home and stopped in horror at the sight of it. When his father, always the strong and steady rock of the family, appeared beside him Bill had to catch him as his legs failed with the shock. 
The bottom floor of the burrow was a blackened shell, all the windows were blown out, chunks of debris littered the grass around the house, and there were gaping holes, where Bill could clearly see the furniture still sitting inside. The fire seemed to have been isolated only to the bottom level, the anti-fire wards preventing it from spreading further than the initial cursed rooms. Only the very top level looked to be mostly undamaged apart from the windows.</p>
<p><br/>
“We can fix this dad.” Bill assured him, but this seemed to be the final straw for his father as he yelled out in pain, and anger, all the emotion he had been holding so firmly in check at Hogwarts came flooding out. 
Bill let him cling onto him like he was the only thing keeping him from drowning, unshed tears running down his own face. It took Bill a while to compose himself enough to conjure a patronus and send it to Kingsley. He hoped he was not overstepping his boundaries with the newly appointed interim minister, but he did not want his mother to see this. He had not expected the minister himself to turn up with four Aurors in tow.</p>
<p><br/>
“We will check it out in case whoever did this left anything unpleasant. I will also assign a team to repair your home.” Kingsley’s baritone voice spoke with the same calmness as always. 

Arthur had done his best to compose himself when Kingsley showed up, and started to protest that they were fine, more important things needed to be done, but he waved away his arguments. 

“Your family is very important Arthur. I understand also that Harry is going to be staying here with you. It would be good for him to be with family. Good for me to know that he is somewhere safe.” 

Bill never really considered before the other members of the order having the same desire to take care of Harry as his parents did. He didn’t know Harry that well, the weeks they had sheltered them at shell Cottage were frustrating times, with them refusing to tell him their plans. In hindsight, of course, he was glad he had been told nothing so when the goblins had interviewed him about it he did not need to deny anything.</p>
<p><br/>
Green sparks shot up from the wreckage of the house indicating it was all clear, followed by the soft pops of the Aurors leaving. But before Bill could make his way into the building six more wizards appeared and began their work fixing the damage. One of which came over to the three of them and nodded his greeting. He seemed to know his father quite well as he gripped his upper arm, in silent condolence, then offered a hand to Bill who shook it briefly.</p>
<p><br/>
“I’m very sorry Arthur. Unfortunately there is not enough left of the ground floor for us to put it back without raw materials so it will take longer. Do have any sketches of how it was, or how you would like it?” His father was having trouble tearing his eyes away from the Burrow, but at the question he shook his head, as if clearing his thoughts and spoke to Bill.</p>
<p><br/>
“Thank you Dafydd. Bill, in my shed? The plans we had drawn up, the way Molly dreamed, maybe one day?” His words trailed off, Bill nodded knowing exactly what he was talking about. He had been at the burrow that day, making plans for his and Fleur’s wedding, when his mother and father had discussed the fact that the family was only going to get bigger, and the family dinner table was already cramped. 

 On a little whim, and to distract them from wedding plans, he had started asking them about how they would change the Burrow, he had put it all on paper, folded it away, and handed it to his father promptly forgetting about it. Until now. 

They were not too difficult to find considering Dads haphazard way of storing things. It was obvious the shed had not been touched, not even the windows had been broken. Perhaps the death eater’s fear and mistrust off muggle things had kept them away from it. When he handed the plans to Dafydd he looked them over nodded and went back to the rest of his team.

  “Kingsley.” Arthur began, feeling a little useless in front of all the activity going on. “We cannot repay the ministry at this time.” Arthur’s ears went red with the shame of having to admit this. “I can assure you though, we will make every effort to pay you back as soon as we can.”</p>
<p><br/>
“Arthur.” Kingsley responded gently. “Your family has paid a price far higher than many others. This is the very least we can do for you.” He said it in a very authoritative tone, there was no way that he was going to let them contribute anything. Bill’s father merely nodded his response far too emotional to say anything. Bill too was feeling the minister’s words keenly, thinking of the brother who would never step into the Burrow again.</p>
<p><br/>
Kingsley said his goodbyes, promising he would be back once the family were all settled back here. They then spoke to Dafydd, he assured them he would send word to Hogwarts as soon as the work was done. So then there was nothing else left to do but go back to the family, and tell them what had happened.</p>
