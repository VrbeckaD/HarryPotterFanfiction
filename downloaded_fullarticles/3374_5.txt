  <em>   [Troye Sivan, ‘Touch’]</em>
</p><p>Is it wine? I would think so but...</p><p>No.</p><p>I know it is him.</p><p>We stop in the doorway, and he turns to look at me... there is this spark, right there, flaring briefly in his heart, dying down in an instant, as though yielding under his will. Shaking his head, he steps into the room and I follow him as though on a leash.</p><p>He thinks it is I who is Pulling, they all do. No, it is not how it works; not quite.  </p><p>Air around us is thrumming, alive with his heartbeat. He stops by the bed and turns. It is dark in the room but it doesn’t matter, not to me. For against the darkness the flame that ignites in his chest shines even brighter, no matter how hard he tries to dim it down... until he gives in.</p><p>He doesn’t know all this, he has no idea I can see. I am not about to tell him. Not about to let him know that it is he who has the power over me, not the other way around. Those who don't know, always mistake the Veela Pull for the manifestation of our power. Except for our kind, no one knows things for what they really are. It is our biggest secret. Our blessing and curse. If they only knew...</p><p>A Veela follows the one they attached their heart to; a Veela can only Pull the one who already does have that spark in them. And he's had that spark from the beginning, even when he didn't recognise it for what it was. The spark that now burns bright and brighter. The spark that tells me everything I need to know.</p><p>Thudding of his heart is deafening in the silent room. The roar of his blood on fire is music in my ears. Motionless, he ceases to breath, probably grateful to the darkness that he thinks conceals him from me. I feel the flow of my magic seeping through my fingertipst. This is how I know - a mere second before he knows it himself - that he is already allowing me everything I needed for so long, needed to do to sate this hunger that he is the source and the reason of.</p><p>I reach out and touch. </p><p>My fingers graze the back of his hand - barely so - I cannot allow myself more, I am not even able to. All I can do is wait until he takes that final step, or he doesn't. He has to come willingly. Whatever he may think, it is not in my power to force him.</p><p>Something shifts in the air, and I exhale in relief, for I already know what he is about to do, even before he does.</p><p>He launches forward, grabbing my face between his palms, leaning in, and I think I am prepared for what is coming. I am not. I expect a kiss and to have an upper hand. Stupid of me, this is Potter.</p><p>The first thing I feel when our lips collide is a sharp bite - his teeth sink into my lower lip. I relish the pain, kissing back through it, finally being allowed to. His wild nature is my undoing, the very thing that pulls me, that holds me on a leash. My fingers glide up his neck, making him shudder. I am gathering it, getting high on his final surrender to my touch. Gasping, he throws his head back as though in pain, pushing up into me with his whole body. I press my lips to the hollow of his throat, drinking in desire that is rising from his skin in golden sparks.</p><p>He may think that it is I who is pulling, but of the two of us I am the desperate one. He cries out. I know my touch stings. He falls, and I gather him in my arms.</p><p>"Blaise," he whispers, "of course..." He sounds delirious, I doubt he knows what he is saying.</p><p>"Yes." I lower him on the bed, vanishing our clothes.</p><p>I need his skin, all of it, without any barrier between us. I take his glasses off and look into his eyes.</p><p>W<em>ords</em> are rising from my lips on their own accord, and I can almost see them in the dark air. I cannot stifle them, cannot hold them back even if I wished to. The whisper of an ancient knowledge rippling through - the thing that is bigger than me - the <em>Creature</em> I don't have control over. All I can do is let it out.</p><p>I trail his chest with my lips, letting the <em>words</em> sink into his skin, etching into his very heart that is hammering under my breath. His whole body arches as though in pain or pleasure, it looks both. I taste his skin, sliding my tongue along his stomach, down, down, around the navel, down to where his cock is standing hard. I inhale the scent of his desire - he is so aroused he might burst. And there somewhere, drowned under the overwhelming lust, I feel the faintest flutter of something different: anxious and on its guard.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>He's never done this before.</p><p>I swallow him down, he jerks. I bob my head, moving my tongue along the underside. He arches against my finger sliding inside. </p><p><em>"I want..."</em> he says.</p><p>His hands stroke my nape, pressing into my scalp as I circle the head of his cock with my lips. He wants, of course he does - the thought makes me smile. I am going to make it good for him, so good that he will come for more and stay.</p><p><em>"I want..."</em> he says again, trembling and gasping and gorgeous, and the Creature in me sings with triumph.</p><p>"I'll give it to you." It makes me say, changing my voice into purr, and he shivers under my palms.</p><p>I'll give it to him as best as I can. I push, and he is letting me in, and I summon all my restraint not to wreck him. I am hurting him and he screams; I feel his pain as though it were my own, there's no help to that.</p><p>"Don't fight," I whisper into his neck. </p><p><em>Don't fight, or it will kill you,</em> the Creature almost makes me say.</p><p>Pressing my lips to his skin, I let my magic sip into his body - sweet melody, soothing his wounded being. Going pliant, his body ceases to resist, and he is giving himself without reserve, melting into my touch. He slides his palms over my skin, pulling me deeper and the Creature is singing, baring its sharp teeth. I move, and he hisses. I don't stop, hurting him again and again, for there is no way around this pain, no way but through. I pin his hands above his head, lacing our fingers together, and we move - not in a fight but in a dance. I am etching myself into his being forever.</p><p>He doesn't know the moment when his agony becomes bliss, but I know it, for the air changes. It is singing, blissful and golden, dissolving his cries of joy, and it is my highest reward to give him <em>this</em>. In this very moment he is <em>mine and mine alone, </em>completely and utterly mine to sate my hunger, drinking him in, until I am full to the brim. Until I become the Creature and the Creature becomes me, until there is no difference or divide between us, for we are one; until I am whole, until I dissolve, ceasing to exist.</p><p>His pleasure bursts between us, and I am dying, for this is too much to bear, and I am taking it all.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>I watch him asleep, exhausted from my touch. He curls into me, and the Creature is purring. As soft and languid as a cat, and as predatory. Its nature is playful, jealous and greedy. It is tender and vulnerable, and its possessiveness can suffocate. It is a vital part of my being, but not my essence; sometimes I wish it were. I wish there were enough of a Veela in me for us to become one.</p><p>They think we are one, but we are not; not quite. They think I am <em>it</em>, and they are not wrong. Though what they don't know, is that I fight it as much as I cherish it. I never win, and by the end I cease to even try. In the moments like this, I don't even want to know whom he has fallen for, dragging me down with him. Because I am afraid he doesn't see <em>Me</em> in me, and rightly so. He's drawn to the Creature, which is too vital in me not to try and bond him, which is not a Veela enough and too weak to accomplish it.</p><p>I trail my fingertips along his arm and shoulder. He is so delicious, I can't breath. Those months since the beginning of the term, since the very first day I caught his gaze on me, have passed in his constant pull and my resistance, until I gave in. He has no idea how desperate I am; he mistakes my weakness for my power; they all do. It is not love, not yet. I tiptoe the fine line between the Creature's desire to possess and my own emotions that only need a little push for me to finally fall. I am afraid to fall. I don't know what it means to him. And there is nothing more pathetic than a creature like me on a leash.</p><p>In the moments like this I regret that I am not able to force him, unable to <em>make</em> him. I would gladly do it, if I could.</p><p>He stirs in his sleep and turns on his back, so I finally see his face. I am able to fathom the faintest rippling of the visions beneath his eyelids. There's heat and desire and shining movement of my hands, reaching for him. Ah, that is how he perceives me in his dreams. I smile, leaning down to place a kiss on his lips.</p><p>Fire is rising in him again, before he is even awake, the need for me; and I am going to fuel it and give it to him, sate it as best as I can. My hand reaches down to where his cock is ready and hard. He presses into my touch, opening his eyes with a moan. They are wide and bewildered. Sitting up in the bed, he bolts out, welcoming me as I straddle his hips. Claiming his lips, I sink all the way down, relishing the pain; he cries out. I begin moving, striving to overcome the pain, eager for it to never end. Throwing his head back, he gasps, and I can hardly bear it, for he cannot feel my pain, but I am feeling everything he is feeling. This is already too much, but there is still all the way to go. He squeezes my arse, guiding me up and down, I feel how close he is. My head falls back, and I feel the press of his lips on my neck, the heat of his tongue stinging my skin, the sharp touch of his teeth; I shudder. He takes my cock in his hand and I hiss, biting my lip. I look down at him, and I am so ready. Leaning in, I press our foreheads together, reaching for him with my mind. He meets me in the middle only to pull me close and drag me down and hold me tight, until there is nothing left of us among our bliss.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>I wake up to the empty bed, his scent still lingering. He must have got up mere minutes before.</p><p>"Come here," he said, pulling me to lay my head on his stomach.</p><p>I closed my eyes, relishing the feeling of his skin beneath my cheek.</p><p>"You are so..." He trailed his fingertips through my hair, as though stroking a sleepy animal. "You remind me of..." He didn't finish.</p><p>"Of what?" I was dying to know and afraid to appear too eager.</p><p>"Of an animal... I mean like... a cat or some such. Dangerous and gentle, both at once."</p><p>He sounded dreamy and a bit delirious, as though already half-asleep. I raised my head to look at him.</p><p>"I don't know which one draws me to you or scares me the most," he said with his eyes closed.</p><p>He smiled, and my heart ached. Because I was not mistaken, it is the Creature he wanted, and never Me. Albeit he thought the creature was me, and maybe - just maybe - it could work out? Putting my head back on his stomach, I said nothing, and he didn't elaborate either, and I was asleep before I knew it.</p><p>The door opens, letting him inside. He has nothing on but a towel around his hips. Closing the door, he stands still with his back to me. The air is changing. He's brought <em>something</em> with him, something that makes me uneasy. </p><p>"Hey," I say. I want to see his face.</p><p>He turns around. "Hey."</p><p>Behind the glasses his eyes are haunted, as though it pains him to look at me. I must protect him.</p><p>"Come here," I say.</p><p>As though unable to resist the pull, he comes and stops by the bed, reluctant to make a move. I reach out with my hand, making him sit.</p><p>"What's wrong?" I ask.</p><p>I already know.</p><p>"Look, Blaise..." he begins, not meeting my eyes.</p><p>"You are freaking out," I say, "it's okay... come here."</p><p>I pull him down beside me, gathering him in my arms. He <em>is</em> freaking out. What we’d done last night may have come as a shock to him in the sober light of morning. But it's not only that, it is something else.</p><p>"It's okay," I whisper, pressing my lips to his nape again and again.</p><p>His smell soaked my whole being through, how am I supposed to let it go? It is the Creature, I want to think. And it is, but not only. <em>Not only.</em> He turns in my arms, and... There is <em>Draco, Draco, Draco</em> written all over his face. <em>D</em><em>raco</em> is screaming at me from his guilty eyes.</p><p>"Blaise, I'm sorry."</p><p>I knew it all along, it hurts anyway. I wince, not letting go of him.</p><p>"I see..." - is all I can manage right now.</p><p>I look at him and suddenly feel worn out, drained. I gave him so much of myself last night, poured out so much of my vital energy. He is taking it all and leaving, and there is nothing I can do. I wish I could force him to stay, force to give it all back. No such luck. </p><p>"I am really sorry,” he says, “I didn't think...but..."</p><p>Reaching out, he touches his finger to my neck, trailing it up and down; it is all I can do not to recoil.</p><p>"But it is not <em>Me</em> you want," I say.</p><p>I am so tired, I think I might sleep through the rest of the day.</p><p>He nods. "I'm sorry."</p><p>I see he really is. I see it pains him to hurt me. But there is nothing he can do, and the last thing I want from him is his pity.</p><p>"I thought..." I say, "I might at least try. I thought if I made it good for you, maybe you'd... stay?"</p><p>Why am I even saying this? I know I shouldn't. But he is honest, which makes me want to let him know that it wasn't <em>nothing</em> for me. I don't want him to think I only used him for my own pleasure.</p><p>"You did, Blaise... it was so good, you have no idea...but..." he trails off.</p><p>But not good enough. Not a <em>Veela</em> enough to force him to stay, and not enough of <em>Me </em>to make him want me for <em>Me</em>.</p><p>The Creature is whimpering, weak and pathetic. </p><p><em>'You are a failure'</em> - I say to it - <em>'No good for anything real. I am sick of you.'</em></p><p>And it wraps itself around my aching heart, trying to soothe it. Taking pity, I cradle it and let it weep, for we have no one but each other.</p><p>"I really like you Harry, and I thought there may be something more between us," I say. There is no point in saying this. I just want him to know.</p><p>"You are so beautiful, so exquisite, Blaise... don’t waste yourself on me..."</p><p>His eyes are so pure, he really means it. He is like this, which always astonished me: this ability to expose himself, to say what he thinks, to lay everything bare, like a weapon on a table. Whenever I tried it myself, it never did me good.</p><p>I lean forward and kiss him, allowing myself to indulge in his taste for the last time. There is <em>something</em> in him still, it is stirring and reaching for me, and it is all I can do not reach out in return.</p><p>
  <em>No.</em>
</p><p>It is already yielding under his will.</p><p>
  <em>Enough.</em>
</p><p>"Alright," I say, "I won't. Thank you for... being honest."</p><p>Throwing the sheets aside, I sit up and gett out of bed. Not looking back at him, I leave the room.</p><p>I need to be alone. </p><p align="center">**</p><p>My face is wet, I don't wipe it, letting droplets run down freely. They are only water from under the spray, I am not crying.</p><p>I am washing his scent off my skin, better not to linger.</p><p>The creature is weak and small and pitiful: clinging to my heart it curls around it in its sleep. It needs time to heal.</p><p>I know this ache in me won't wear off soon.</p><p>We both need time.</p><p align="center"><strong>*****</strong>  <strong>The end of the Part 3</strong> (look for the link to the Part 4 down below)<strong> *****</strong></p><p align="left">
