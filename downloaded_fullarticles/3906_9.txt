    <p>
  <span>Hermione fell to the ground and lost her grip on her vinewood wand as rubble crumbled from the castle onto her legs. The castle was slowly falling apart, magic no longer able to keep it standing after the multitude of hits it took from curses and various magical creatures. Lifting her eyes to witness the battle around her, Hermione screamed as she saw Ron succumb to the torture Greyback was putting him through. He looked in her direction one last time before she watched his bright blue eyes fade, the light leaving his eyes. Greyback had heard her screaming, and she frantically tried to pull her legs from underneath the fallen stone as he approached her. His teeth were bared, showing the disgusting, yellowing fangs protruding from his gums. With no time to succumb to the emotion she felt watching her friend..her future die in front of her eyes, she flung herself forward as far as possible, grunting in pain as her legs refused to budge. Wiggling her fingers, she brushed the tip of her wand, but couldn’t pick it up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched as her wand was crunched into several small pieces by a large foot. Before looking up, she knew who it was. The will to fight was leaving her. Dying just might be the easy way out. Making a split second decision, Hermione closed her eyes and reminisced on happier times. After several moments, she frowned and opened her eyes just in time to see Malfoy slice into the werewolf’s neck, severing his head completely, blood gushing over the both of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy?” Hermione asked incredulously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No time to explain now, Granger!” he shouted over the sounds of battle, wiping blood from his face. She watched as he raised his wand and lifted the rubble from her legs. “Can you stand?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shook her head. “I think my legs are broken. I know the spell, but Greyback broke my wand.” He then looped his arms around her — one around her waist, the other underneath her knees. She wiggled underneath his grasp, unsure if she could trust him. Before she watched him slice open Greyback, she thought he was with the Death Eaters. Trust in someone can’t possibly change that quick. Can it? “Wha— What are you doing?” she sputtered out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stay still,” he commanded. He then lifted her and took off at a fast paced walk toward what used to be the entrance of the Great Hall. Helpless with her legs useless, she stopped wiggling in his arms and instead put a little faith in him hoping he wasn’t delivering her to the enemy and helped him navigate through the halls. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where are we going?” she shouted, as he continued to run. He just shook his head in response, and Hermione huffed. The little bit of faith she had put in his moments ago was wavering at his lack of response. He could be running her straight into the arms of the enemy for all she knew. Malfoy’s head continued to whip back and forth, looking for danger. After what seemed like forever, Malfoy slowed down to a walk before stopping outside double doors she didn’t recognise. She opened her mouth once more to ask where they were when he lifted he moved them closer to the door and knocked lightly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione was surprised, to say the least when Madam Pomfrey poked her head out and ushered them inside. This wasn’t normally where the entrance to the Hospital Wing was located, but Hogwarts being magical had most likely started to move things around in an attempt to save itself and the people inside. Malfoy squeezed them through the small opening of the door and Hermione sighed in relief to see other members of the Order and Dumbledore’s Army in the room. She would be safer here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Turning her attention back to Malfoy, she let herself observe him as he manoeuvred her through the room and to an open bed. He had beads of sweat appearing on his forehead and his hair, for once, was dishevelled. She reached her hand up to wipe the dirt off his chin, and he stilled. She removed her hand immediately and looked away to avoid embarrassment. She had forgotten who they were for a moment. Arriving at an empty bed, he deposited her into it and flung himself in the chair next to the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing?” she asked, trying to sit up in the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should stay laying down. Madam Pomfrey will be over to heal you in a moment.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing?” she asked again. She needed to know and was beginning to become frustrated with his lack of answers. Her head was buzzing with questions and confusion. Why did he save her? She deserved an answer!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy opened his mouth and closed it before talking. He looked off into the distance before returning his gaze to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I—“ He was cut off by Madam Pomfrey showing up with a tray of potions for her. She took each one the matron gave her, saving the Dreamless Sleep for last. She still wanted to talk to Malfoy and didn’t want to be too drowsy. Throwing back the potion and placing it on the tray in front of her, she turned his attention back to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Granger, it’s a long story. But just know I am on your side. On the light side. I defected.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione just nodded her head, the dreamless sleep beginning to take effect. She closed her eyes and fell into nothingness. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>Hermione sat in St. Mungo’s in the waiting room, distraught. Draco sat beside her, their fingers entwined. The fear and uncertain she went through when Ron died was nothing to how she was feeling now. Maybe it was because she still had Harry to lean on when Ron died but if Harry—. Her thought trailed off. She didn’t even want to think about that happening. Harry had returned to Godric’s Hollow last night, on Halloween, and that’s where they found him. The Death Eater sympathisers had ambushed him in his parents’ home, taking revenge on him for ending their Lord’s life and his reign of terror on Britain. Luckily, Hermione had felt something was off and came to his side, but it had been too late. She apparated him to St. Mungo's, and they were currently waiting to hear from the Healers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione felt a nudge from her side and looked up to see a healer in lime green robes walking toward them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Miss Granger. Mister Malfoy,” the healer addressed them. Hermione waited with baited breath to hear the fate of her friend. “I’m sorry. There’s nothing —“ </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione didn’t hear the rest of the healer’s words. She fell to her knees and screamed, sobs wracking her body. First Ron, now Harry. How could this happen?</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>Hermione woke up in a cold sweat with Draco leaning over her, pushing her sweat covered bangs off her forehead. He said nothing, just pulled her into his arms placing a kiss below her ear. She took a deep breath and tried to steady her breathing. She looked at the clock, noticing it was after 12 am. It had officially been twenty years since the Battle of Hogwarts and nightmares of her friends’ fates still haunted her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco had been there by her side ever since he carried her into the hospital wing that horrid day. He comforted her in times of need and held her when she woke up screaming from her nightmares. If it wasn’t for him — and Scorpius, she would have given up on life long ago. Rolling into Draco’s side and into his arms, she breathed in his scent, placed a kiss on his bare chest and closed her eyes, drifting off into what she hoped would be a peaceful sleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ready, Hermione?” Draco said, leaning against the door jamb to their bedroom. “It’s time.” Hermione stood up from her vanity and turned toward her husband, nodding. She wasn’t really ready, but she would never be ready. She walked closer to him and grasped his hand, hard. He gave her a small, reassuring smile and led her down the stairs to where Scorpius was waiting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ready Father? Mother?” Scorpius asked. Hermione smiled at their son — such impeccable manners. He had been a beacon of light in such depressing moments over the years. But the smile was short lived. Seeing Hogwarts for the first time in twenty years would be difficult and just thinking about it exhausted her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re ready, darling,” Hermione responded, clasping his hand. She nodded at Draco who spun on the spot, apparating them to the one place Hermione swore she would never return to. </span>
