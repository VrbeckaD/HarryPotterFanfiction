          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ebony glanced at her dorm mirrors as she passed it. Her black hair was a mess, and with a sigh she paused to fix it.</p><p>She practiced her sharp smile as she quickly combed the knots out. White teeth glinted back at her. "You look fantastic, darling," the mirror soothed, sensing Ebony's nerves.</p><p>"I know," she grimaced, "you always tell me that. Even when I'm wearing--<em>M</em><em>uggle band</em> shirts and a <em>miniskirt--</em>" She gestured down at her outfit. "You're a pureblood mirror for Merlin's sake, act like it." There was no real bite to her words.</p><p>Ebony smoothed her black miniskirt nervously, taking care to avoid the intentional creaks. "Wish me luck," she breathed, and swept out the door before she could chicken out.</p><p>Everyone in the common room turned their head and stared. </p><p>Her skin itched from all the eyes on her, but she pretended not to notice nor care. It was weekend. The school rules clearly stated students were allowed to wear whatever they want on the weekend, she reminded herself over and over. It was supposed to be a statement, she couldn't show weakness now.</p><p>Her classmates sneered her as she hastily made her way out of the common room. Muggle clothes, and so blatantly differing from normal, plain wear at that. She would probably be socially outcast from Slytherin for at least a few weeks. But she was making a point.</p><p>"Ebony." As she was approaching the common room entrance, it opened, and Draco Malfoy stepped inside. He nodded politely at her, keeping his face carefully blank.</p><p>He, arguably, looked even worse than her. His make-up--neither of them had even touched a stick of lipstick before this, although Ebony had a little bit of experience with powder. Now they were clad in the most terrible muggle clothing, with faces almost as pale as their layers of foundation, and black eyeliner and lips. Draco was wearing red contacts too, Ebony saw, just to up the anti a little.</p><p>Something in her loosened at seeing her friend look so ridiculous. He had insisted it was political suicide, but he'd trusted her anyway and he'd gone along with the plan. She.. appreciated that. </p><p>He had been her friend for six years now. He knew that if her plans worked, and they <em>had</em> to work, it would overthrow the whole additude towards everything Muggle.</p><p>"Draco." She nodded back at him, and he took her arm, escorting her to the Great Hall.</p><p>Willow was waiting for them at the Slytherin table, looking like a cartoon vampire. Despite that, she was smiling cheerfully, enjoying this move way too much. "Ebony!" She said happily, suggestively moving her eyes towards Ebony and Draco's linked arms.</p><p>Ebony immediately pulled her arm back, then scowled silently. It was good manners to escort a lady, that's all. Draco didn't seem to have caught the look, to her relief.</p><p>"Still going to that muggle concert together?" She asked, deliberatey letting her voice carry. The Slytherins at breakfast were all either looking at them in horrified shock or glaring at them with eyes that promised death.</p><p>Ebony covered her flinch up with a movement towards her plate. "Yup. Can't wait, I love Good Charlotte. My favorite band, besides My Chemical Romance, of course." She let her voice take on an airy drawl, unconcern radiating from her. </p><p>"Of course," Willow nodded with an easy going grin.</p><p>Ebony fidgeted very subtly and tried to eat some toast, but the stares were getting to her. </p><p>"Let's go make out in the forbidden forest or something." She huffed when she couldn't bear the looks anymore. A tiny bit of defensiveness slipped through, but she didn't think anyone noticed. She pulled Draco up by his sleeve and dragged him out of there.</p><p>Willow pouted sarcastically, not moving to stand. She looked quite comfortable where she was. "Awe, I'm already being excluded."</p><p>Ebony ignored her friend with practiced ease.</p><p>The doors to the Great Hall closed behind her and she relaxed marginally, feeling the heavy looks slide off her back. They walked a little further before turning a corner and quickly checking if anyone had followed. </p><p>"That went pretty well," she said. Draco raised his eyebrows at her in an expression of incredulity.</p><p>"'Let's go make out in the Forbidden Forest'?!"</p><p>"Hey, I was under pressure!" Ebony defended. She sighed as Draco mouthed the ridiculous words once more. "Okay, it was pretty bad."</p><p>"Yeah, it was." </p><p>Ebony turned aroud in an instant, wand snapped into her hand. Harry Potter raised his hands in feigned alarm. With a grimace, she lowered her wand again. "Potter. What do you want."</p><p>Draco sneered at him, coming to stand beside Ebony.</p><p>"Calm down. I just wanna know..." He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "-is this because Greengrass called you a mudblood last week?"</p><p>Draco scowled darkly beside her, glancing away. "<em>In public,</em>" he hissed under his breath. </p><p>Ebony's lips quirked up as she imagined Greengrass' face when she heard of the new development. She shrugged. "If she wants me to be a muggle so bad, she can have it. Best thing is, she can't argue, not publicly. Not without getting some the blame for embarassing the Slytherin house."</p><p>Potter's lips quirked into an identical smirk. "I want in."</p><p>Ebony stared.</p><p>"My public image has always been controlled." He explained, ignoring their suspicious looks. "First by my guardians, then by Dumbledore. It's time I ruined all their hard work, don't you think?" His tone was almost jovial.</p><p>Draco spluttered.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>That evening, Draco and Ebony were called up to the Headmaster's office.</p><p>"Sit, please," Dumbledore gestured, his voice grave, despite his twinkling eyes. His phoenix flared proudly behind him, showing off its beautiful flaming feathers to its new audience.</p><p>Ebony took a seat. After a second of hesitation, Draco remained standing. That's when she realized there was only one guest chair. Where was Draco supposed to sit, on her lap?</p><p>Dumbledore offered a strange kind of candy, which was twinkling almost as brightly as his eyes. "No, thank you," Ebony said politely. She was a Slytherin, her mask wasn't stirred by the nervousness she felt in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>"There have been some unusual rumors," Dumbledore suggested lightly, "about you two entering the Forest, which is, of course, Forbidden."</p><p>His gaze didn't once linger on their clothing, simply accepting it as normal, somehow. Then again, Ebony had no doubt Dumbledore had long since lost all sense of fashion or just his sight entirely, going by his choice of robes.</p><p>Ebony fought the urge to sigh. "That was simply a joke at the breakfast table, sir."</p><p>She looked into his eyes, focusing on this morning's breakfast, her classes in the morning and afternoon, and homework after, before being called here. She'd heard rumors herself, after all, about the Headmaster.</p><p>Dumbledore nodded, looking satisfied. "You must forgive my reliance on rumors. Sadly, this one is quite popular. Encompassing the majority of the school, I believe." </p><p>Ebony blanched. At least half the school thought she had made out in the Forbidden Forest with Draco.</p><p>She heard the latter groan beside her.</p><p>"Right, sir."</p><p>"You're dismissed," Dumbledore twinkled. The old bastard.</p><p>Draco lead the way as they escaped from the office, only to stop short at an encounter in front of the guard gargoyles.</p><p>His godfather was standing a few feet away, staring down at the two in consternation.</p><p>For a moment, Snape simply massaged the bridge of his nose. Finally he found the courage to look at them again, and when he spoke it was with a strained voice. "I assume there's an explanation for this?"</p><p>".. Politics, sir." Draco piped up, with not-quite-a-shrug. Ebony envied how casual he could be with the professor, as long as he kept a certain amount of respect. </p><p>"Of course." Snape sighed heavily. "Let me know when I can expect the hippy phase."</p><p>He swooped past them, and Ebony caught a mutter of 'teenagers'.</p><p>When he was out of earshot, there were a few moments of silence before Draco began snickering quietly. Ebony shook for a moment, trying to hold on, before both collapsed in breathless fits of laughter. Narcissa's secret photo stash of the Potion Master's school years were what had inspired their looks in the first place.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ebony could practically hear the sound of brains breaking all throughout the Great Hall.</p><p>Draco and her both gaped at the boy who plopped down next to them at the Slytherin table, before thinking better of it and snapping their mouths shut. Dark red streaking through black hair, the same crimson red contacts as Draco, a painted pentagram on his forehead, a band t-shirt and were those <em>actual fangs?</em></p><p>"Potter," Draco said faintly, "You look horrific."</p><p>He somehow managed to make it sound like a compliment. </p><p>"Ahw, thank you so much! Call me Vampire." Potter grinned like a madman. At the front of the hall, someone's forehead hit the Head Table.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>By next week's Tuesday, rumors had spread. Potter, Draco and her were in a love triangle of cheating and jealousy, apparently, and illegally entered vampires that sucked each other's blood in their free time.</p><p>Ebony wasn't quite sure how they'd have blood if they were vampires, but people believed it and that was enough. </p><p>In any case, Ebony thought, looking around, her plan had worked. No one'd been concerned with calling slurs at muggleborns anymore. And call her crazy, but she thought she'd been seeing more and more students losing their tie on the weekends and walking around in t-shirts. After all, with the Goth Vampires taking all the incredulity and social isolation from the other students, who really cared about some Ravenclaws walking around in pants or Slytherins wearing sneakers under their robes?</p><p>She smiled. Greengrass could suck it. </p></div>
