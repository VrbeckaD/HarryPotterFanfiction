    <p>It was the greyest morning in October when black-haired, strong-headed important man in a black trench coat came apart. </p><p>First out of his slumber. </p><p>Percival was respected by his subordinates and colleagues as a figure that always symbolized order, authority, punctuality, and he was lacking the latter. </p><p>Secondly, of his home. </p><p>He had moved, recently, to a new neighborhood, as he had bought a new, bigger (and emptier) house. But every day he regretted it more. </p><p>The kitchen was enormous and, although Percival did cook cook acceptably some of his old mother's recipes, he was used to the much smaller working area of his old studio. His paintings and family heirlooms were chaotically through all of his three story house, thus he couldn't find anything. </p><p>He also lacked of a knack for interior design, so it was almost certain that when his furniture was ordered it would still look like a disarray; but he could proudly state that his bedroom was the nicest room in the house, even if it was a far cry from the cleanest— those rooms were the guest rooms, still untouched by Graves— but Percival liked it the most, as it was the only place in that building he could call home, but still even it lacked something. </p><p><em>Someone</em>, said a voice, suspiciously like his sister's, in the back of his head, but Percival shut that thought out immediately. He didn't need anybody. His life had been a lonely one for decades, and he wouldn't have wanted it any other way. </p><p>Those years of loneliness, only mitigated by the feeble company of his sister and her kids, had given him the successful career he had longed for since he was a child. And if he bought that new home out of wistful thinking, out of a secret desire to have a family of his own, who would know, who would judge him? </p><p>But now he could tell the whole street was judging him, because he was running like a racehorse into his subway station, almost jumping from stair to stair when he lowered himself down, into the underground, because he was going to arrive late to his work for the first time in, well, a lifetime. </p><p>The third time he was came apart, though, it was unexpected. </p><p>When he got inside of his train, which he almost lost, he perceived, more than saw, his reflexion in other people's faces. They were agitated, nervous and a big portion of them </p><p>surely late, too. There was, though, someone who surpassed the pure anxiety that Percival's face emanated, and that caught his attention. </p><p>The boy was in shambles. Mismatched socks with mismatched shoes, untamed hair in a hideous bowl cut, a too-tight suit and a wrinkled shirt with yellow spots on the neck of it. His eyes were open as an owl's, and his face was twisted in a scowl that expressed sheer fear. The young man looked in every direction frantically and, for a moment, his gaze and Percival's met, and what Percival saw the was beyond natural. </p><p>The boy's eyes were blown wide, but that only displayed better the beautiful black color of his iris. The older man had never seen eyes with so much depth and beauty, and then the moment broke, when those gorgeous bottomless ravines stopped piercing his, and Percival felt a feeling of... Of having lost a piece of himself to that young boy. </p><p>He was going to think more of it, but the boy disappeared from the train in the next station, looking even more disheveled after his weird exchange with Graves. </p><p>Graves would be lying if he said he didn't felt let down, but he'd be completely honest when affirming that he didn't know exactly why. The boy had a pretty face, but it was highly downplayed by his clothes and hair, and although Percival could see that he reflected on the boy’s ethereal aura that Percival couldn't get enough of, even when he had only perceived it for a mere minute. </p><p>Had it been a minute? Percival suddenly fell out of his reverie and checked his clock. It had been 20 minutes, and he was arriving to his station. </p><p>He jumped off the train, and he realized that, if he ran, he would only be fifteen minutes late. Not the best possible scenario for someone of his rank, but he could manage an excuse. </p><p>While he ran he has a strange idea, and he tried it, imagining that instead of running towards work he was running to the cryptic and beautiful brunet. </p><p>He arrived six minutes late. </p><p>"Hey Graves", exclaimed his subordinate, Abernathy, when he walked past the door, "we thought the Russians had gotten a hold of you, considering you're late." He said, jokingly, but his amused smile disappeared at Graves' irony gaze, and then he remembered. </p><p>"I'm so sorry boss, I completely forgot, if you want to I can bring you something, a coffee and some pastries perhaps, anything to—", he was cut short when Percival entered his office and slammed the door shut behind him, right in front of Abernathy, who had followed him all the way from the entrance of their floor to said door, the door of Graves' office. </p><p>He was relieved he didn't have to listen to the man's half-hearted and annoying apologies, and he thanked the architect of that building for the soundproof walls, as he decided that the best way to relieve all the stress that he'd felt that morning was throwing himself on the Chester he had mere inches away with a groan, that sounded more like a growl. </p><p>He remained in the couch for a couple of minutes, rubbing his fingers over his temple, trying to digest the anxiety he hadn't felt since he was naive new agent. But he knew, deep down, that it wasn't only residual anxiety that kept him from starting his paperwork, and there was something buried deep inside of him that wanted to explore that feeling. </p><p><em> Longing</em>, he was telling to himself the feeling, but his line of thought just couldn't articulate the word.</p><p>He had felt longing before, a longing of having a normal job, of saving those he had lost, of achieving the rank he now had. But he had never felt that feeling for someone. It was exhilarating, to remember his face, and specially his eyes, but it was excruciating to contemplate the fact of how they surely would never meet again. </p><p>He was then regretting not talking to him, not following him when he hopped out of the train, and the longing became need. Need to calm down that eerie creature that had captured his waking thoughts only by setting eyes of him. </p><p>Percival wouldn’t be honest if he said that he wasn't a romantic, at heart, but he would be brutally honest if he said he had never been that way with someone. His job was demanding and his free time scarce, and it was only some months ago, when he had been promoted, that he lived in a stable place. </p><p>He had held himself back of any wistful thinking about any of his one night stands or short lived relationships, and now the dam he had meticulously created over the years to hold that part of himself back was breaking down. </p><p>And all it took were a pair of ebony eyes. </p><p>He had been lounging for twenty minutes when someone knocked on his door, and Percival got up, begrudgingly to face whatever was in tow for him behind that door. </p><p>He was surprised to see Abernathy, now red-faced with a fire in his eyes that only meant danger, next to his new agent, a promising young woman that came highly recommended. The brown haired woman looked enraged, too, but her face turned pale when she met his gaze. Under all those feelings shone sheer determination, and if it wasn't for his well trained observation skills, Graves would have missed it. </p><p>It was impossible to miss it, though, when she talked just before Abernathy opened his mouth. </p><p>"Agent Abernathy interrupted my mission, director Graves.", her voice was shaky but her tone stern, and when she was finishing that line Abernathy proceeded to give his side of the story. </p><p>"I have interrupted no mission, Director Graves, but I did stop Agent Goldstein from doing whatever the hell she was doing." Kegan Abernathy was usually a pliant and quiet man, at least on Percival’s eyes, but when angry it was of common knowledge that he became a basilisk. </p><p>"I was taking care of a mission!" Answered Goldstein in a heartbeat, turning her whole body towards him, her expression extraordinarily expressive. </p><p>"You were starting a crusade!" Abernathy faced her completely too, seemingly forgetting whose office they were at.</p><p>Graves stood on the same spot, unamused, waiting for the shouting match to stop, although he was curious about about said mission. </p><p>"You ventured yourself into a mission that was assigned to you by who?" Exclaimed Abernathy, with a hint of a condescending tone at the end of his question. Agent Goldstein's reaction was a strange one for a woman of her drive and fierceness, because by the way she lowered her head, tinted with a faint but visible blush, it was obvious that she regretted not doing things differently, maybe in a more formal way, Graves guessed. </p><p>"It was a self assigned mission, sir." She mustered out, explaining at last to graces what she had done that had caused such a commotion. </p><p>Graves then understood why Agent Abernathy, who had been the responsible of a great deal of paperwork and responsibilities over keeping order, was so outraged. </p><p>An agent self assigning a mission was risky for said person, but a new agent? That was unheard of. Graves knew the protocol for this kind of situations, he did, but something deep inside him, that went beyond the admiration he felt for Agent Goldstein's guts, told him that that case was important. </p><p>He looked at the woman long and hard, and then to the man the very same way. It seemed like hours for both agents until director Graves spoke, with a low and dangerous voice. </p><p>"Agent Goldstein, to my office, now." He ordered, and agent Goldstein looked paler than a ghost. Abernathy tried to hide a smirk, but he was unable to. He waited for orders, though, which Percival did appreciate. </p><p>"Agent Abernathy, you can leave." He turned around with a stone cold frown, but Percival could swear that he was smiling in all his self-satisfied glory as he walked back to his cubicle, far away from Graves' point of view. </p><p>He let Goldstein in first, closing the door behind himself. When he got in he was before a sight he wasn't expecting, Goldstein looked defiant. </p><p>And that was when he realized it. </p><p>This was a crusade indeed, Goldstein was willing to lose her job right there for it, and God knew how much she had worked for it. It was apparent in her whole demeanor that she was willing to lose her job for that case, and although such defiance would have annoyed him any other day, that day was a different one, so he risked being seen as weak by his young agent and asked about it. </p><p>"What was the case?" Tina was surprised by the question, and Percival felt positively smug about it. It was, after all, a weird day, full of unexpected feelings and actions, and he might as well enjoy seeing someone who looks as flabbergasted as he looked not an hour before. </p><p>Agent Goldstein realized that she was holding her air when she started to get dizzy, and after she breathed in subtly for air, she finally decided what to answer. </p><p>"Will you fire me, sir?", she asked in return and, to her utter surprise, Director Graves fought back a smirk, which was there for a fraction of second. When his face was plain again he answered in a tone which left nothing to bargain. </p><p>"No." And Tina knew in that exact moment that not even if Picquery demanded that she was removed she was going to get fired. And so she conjured and asked one final cautious question. </p><p>"Will I be moved to another department?" <em>Will I go back to paperwork and back to the nine to five work schedule?</em>, that was the real question and they both knew it, and Percival saw himself in that young woman, he saw the determination, the rejection of a normal lifestyle to satisfy the justice-hungry shine in her eyes, and he was sure that whatever the mission Goldstein had started was, it was one that deserved his time. </p><p>"No." He answered again. He might have done that, in another lifetime, another place, but Goldstein was lucky enough to find him in an empathetic high, fueled by obstinate black eyes that stared at him with an almost magical twinkle, that called to him like a mermaid singing to a sailor. </p><p>But there was no mermaid, there was only Porpentina Goldstein with him, with a stunned face but a ferocious stance, like a bird that was flying for the first time. </p><p>The looked at each other, eye to eye, and when Tina saw nothing other than sheer sincerity she started explaining. </p><p>"I was working on the Vector case, and when I was revising one of the suspects activities I stumbled upon something very disturbing, sir." She started, tentatively, still not believing her utter luck. "It was a little girl, with a young boy, she was crying and he was comforting her." She stopped there for a second, her gaze blank and unseeing as she stared into nothing, "then I saw them get startled by something, and the got up and started handing pamphlets. I don't know why I cared so much about them, sir," she said, silencing the questioning look of her boss, who didn't speak a word, expecting her to continue, and so she did, now staring at Graves' eyes as she spoke, "then the next day I went to the zone to interrogate a witness of the Vector case and I saw the boy. He handed me a pamphlet and his hands..." She closed her eyes, breathed in deeply and continued talking. "I've seen emaciated hands before, sir, but not like this, not in someone that could not possibly deserve it." When she saw no response from her superior she carried on, again, disturbed by the man's silence. "I closed the Vector case weeks ago, but I still thought about was happening to those two, so I started investigating, and yesterday I went to their home, sir, and it was the worst place to raise a child to ever exist. It's an extremist church, sir, and their so called mother abuses her children in every way. I arrived as a possible new devotee and I was horrified by their initiation process, so I self assigned myself to sue that cult for child abuse, human trafficking and tax evasion, and thus end it." </p><p>She looked fierce and Percival saw himself, ten years younger, in her. He would let her, he was now certain of that, but the question was how he would let her. </p><p>"Leave the case." Almost as soon as he said it agent Goldstein interrupted him, looking shocked. </p><p>"Captain, with all due respect, I just told you how grave the situation is! I cannot just drop it and I ought to tell you now that, if you forbid me to keep on investigating, I will not hesitate in quitting." Her gaze bordered murderous then, and Percival wasn't surprised, if maybe a little amused. He thought of how lucky she had been again, as only that day he was going to let her use that tone on him. And the funny thing is that he wanted to be in the same mood the next day, and the next, and on the weekends too. He wanted to have that good mood for as long as he lived, he concluded. He was taking his time to answer, he realized, so he explained his last command, while mentally planning how to find the young man that had given him so much contentment in such a short stare. </p><p>"Leave the case for a week and let me assign it to you next Monday." He looked at her in the eye, and saw how her expression morphed to a genuinely happy one. </p><p>"So I will be able to investigate what happened?" </p><p>"In a week, yes." Her eyes shone with hope at that, and she mouthed a thank you to Percival, and if she then she'd a stray tear after that, who was he to tell? It was pretty obvious that agent Goldstein wasn't used to people accepting her propositions, and he was glad that he had been happy that day, because that way her new case had been approved. Still, she's a smart woman and the case does seem grave, after all, Percival thought. </p><p>"Have you thought about a partner for this investigation?" He asked, half wondering how much she had planned of that mission and half thinking, wishfully, that he could twist this into repaying a favor himself. </p><p>"I..." Agent Goldstein looked cornered, not knowing exactly what to answer. "May I be frank, sir?" At Percival's nod she proceeded. "Anybody except Abernathy." Percival was not surprised by the least about that. He would have smirked, but he had the mind to manage to keep a stern face for his employee. </p><p>"I'll concede that." He started, waiting for a moment to appreciate her demeanor change into a slight smile of contentment and her eres widening with wonder, positively pondering who she wanted to choose as a partner for her case. "On one condition." Her expression shifted again, and she looked curious and uneasy, trying to sort out what was that her boss wanted. He reassured her with a calm gaze, as of telling her with no words that it wasn't a difficult task he was asking for, and then he spoke again. "The brother of someone to whom I owe my life to is coming to The States to investigate on one research of his." He eyed her reactions, and he was glad to see her poker face. She was going to be a great agent, he was sure of it. "He works for the British government, of course, but he focuses on animal mistreatment issues. The issue, though, is that he has no business in The States." </p><p>Tina still looked unreadable, and Percival waited for her to intervene, but was only met with a nonchalant hum. </p><p>"So, if you're not against it, I'll assign him as your partner." He eyed her again, more calculating, trying to coerce out the opinion she was not giving away by the least. </p><p>"Is he incompetent?" Was the only thing she asked after a moment of silence between the two, gazing at Percival straight in the eye, expectant, and he knew what she was referring to. Agent Goldstein came from the bottom, she was extremely talented to have come so far when growing up she had had so little, and although that wasn't Percival's case she understood her desire of working with people that had worked their way up, not with a person that was assigned a job merely for being someone's brother. And luckily for both of them Newt Scamander was so much more than that. </p><p>"He is quite competent, for a brit, of course," he smirked at that, remembering all the bickering he used to have with Theseus, Newt's older brother, about what national intelligence was better, "of course he's no James Bond, he's more of a researcher than an agent, but am excellent agent still." Tina's face had shifted, just a little, some hope started to break through and he was glad. </p><p>He was going to proceed to tell her to leave his office and start working on her new case, but she asked a question, so fastly that it looked like had been holding the words for hours in her mouth, and that she had just set them free, like a lively bird that had been trapped in a cage and that had flown away as fast as it could after been released. "What makes him indicate for this case, sir?" She closed her eyes, sheer embarrassment hidden badly, but he decided to just answer the question, ignoring the slip his young agent had just had. </p><p>He remembered having those, too, when he was young and full of questions, and he also knew that what she was feeling in that moment was punishing her more than he could ever achieve to do by reprimanding her. Before opening his mouth he looked at her with faint amusement shining in his eyes, just enough for her to notice and to make it positive that she wouldn't let her curiosity take over her in a while. </p><p>"For what you've told me, your case is a delicate one," he began, choosing his wording carefully and speaking slowly, "it has children, religion and I'm sure that it's got it's fair share of brainwashing, right?" Agent Goldstein nodded, her gaze lost in the carpet, partly because of her embarrassment and partly because she was processing every word, interested in how her partner was right for her case. "Agent Scamander is maybe the most empathetic worker of the British intelligence, he knows how to calm raging bulls and how to tame fierce rhinoceros, but he also knows how to treat the most fearsome mockingbirds and to nurse back to health the sneakiest salamanders. He is not the best at peer to peer communication," at that agent Goldstein seemed to stiffen up, "but he does have a knack for treating people with the care he thinks they deserve. Especially when it comes to children." at the last couple of sentences agent Goldstein relaxed greatly but in a way that was almost impossible to perceive to the common eye. And, because Percival wasn't common in any way, he smiled. It was a small smile and Goldstein had already turned around, but he was too happy to continue smiling just for the sake of it. </p><p>He was alone, again, so he could focus again on his main focus now: finding the man that had made him happier with just a glance than he had ever been with days of chatting and nights if passion with any other person. </p><p>Percival knew it was risky, to put his hopes so up for someone he didn't know at all, but still he had a feeling it wasn't misguided. </p><p>He had a strong belief of that there was a time and place for everything. There was a time and place for traveling across the world, for seeing all the wonders and darkness the world has to offer, for days and nights of mindless studying and even for murder, and for him there hadn't been a better time and place for falling in love. </p><p>Finally he had a stable home, a well paying job and a heart that was satiated of the self-discovery trip that had been his life when he was younger. Now the only thing he wished for was that the young man he has met in the subway would accept his love. </p><p>He was being unfair, in a way, but he couldn't help so. He had gone the last fifteen years working himself to exhaustion and meanwhile everyone he knew had settled down, finding someone with whom spend their lives with. He couldn't stop himself of thinking of his sister, Genevieve, who he had always criticized for marrying young. But ten years later, he envied her. </p><p>Her husband and her had flourished in their fields of work, they still loved each other and they had three children who they loved dearly. He wanted that, he wanted that kind of domestic bliss neither him or his sister had experienced while growing up. But he knew better than beating himself up over something he had no control over. His career was a dangerous one, in which any kind of sentimental partner would be threatened because of him. Still, he couldn't help his want. </p><p>He envisioned the man's dark eyes, his penetrating gaze and his lithe figure waiting for him in his too wide, too empty house, looking at him with the same want he felt for him. He ought to find him, get to know him, for he knew that that was the only cure for the longing he felt and, maybe, he could make that man come apart, too. </p><p>He was bordering on creepy, he knew that, but the temptation to think about the other was overwhelming, he felt like Pylades when he found Orestes, like Patroclus when he met Achilles, and although he hadn’t yet got to know him, he knew that his admiration for him could only grow. </p><p>Percival regretted the two years he spent in Athens, when he pretended to be a classics professor in order to take down a human trafficking network. It all went smoothly, if not a little longer than anticipated, but after those years he found what he had never faced before: beauty. He felt its utter softness caress something deep inside him when reading classic tragedies, and after those wonderful moments he was never the same. </p><p>He was hopelessly romantic, not looking for love, but with a want of a deep human connection, which sometimes made him cynical, for he was yet to find someone to open up to. He looked into his notepad. He had his next date with his psychiatrist in one week, and he knew she would want him to write the thoughts he was having in that very instant down, but he didn’t find himself capable of doing so, of restricting the absolute potential that this young man was into paper, having to articulate what were the conclusions he had gotten from their first encounter. To write down the lies, until proven true or false, he had created in his imagination about the beautiful man that was rushing around the subway. </p><p>Percival wouldn’t concentrate in the next hour, he knew it, so he decided to stand up, lock his office door and sit down, spreading his body on his massive chair, stretching himself and putting his hands behind his neck, reminiscing the obsidian black eyes that had locked with his that very morning.</p>
