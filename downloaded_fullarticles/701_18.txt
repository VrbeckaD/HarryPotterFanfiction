    <p>“…What am I supposed to do with it?”</p><p>“Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.”</p><p>Godric paused in his ranting to glare at his lover, but if Salazar noticed then he gave no indication of it. He was too busy looking over the latest plans for the school, making the occasional mark with his quill. There was a smudge of ink on his cheek and Godric was tempted to go over to him and clamber onto his lap to lick it off before he remembered that he was supposed to be angry with Salazar’s apparent disinterest.</p><p>“It’s a sword,” he said. “They can’t think I’m actually going to use it.”</p><p>“Why not?” Salazar asked. “<i>They</i> use swords. Perhaps they do not see your height as the same disadvantage you do.”</p><p>“That thing is the same size as me!” Godric snapped back. “I can barely lift it!”</p><p>Salazar finally looked up, green eyes bright with amusement, and lowered his quill. He stood and approached, kneeling before Godric so that they were of a height. “Anwylyd,” he said, resting his hands on Godric’s shoulders, “if it so offends you then take action. You know how much pride the Goblins place in their treasures.” Salazar’s smile when he was plotting something was a thing of true beauty. “They forgot to extract an oath from you to bequeath it back to them. If you’re truly as angry as you say you are, deny them that.”</p><p>Godric raised his eyebrows. “You want me to have children?” he asked, disbelief colouring his tone.</p><p>Salazar snorted. “Not at all,” he replied. “Let our brothers continue our lines, for you are mine as I am yours. What I’m suggesting is that you bequeath the sword to the school to aid in its defence. Goblin-made weapons are valuable assets and highly sought after.”</p><p>Never mind that ‘the school’ was little more than a pipe dream at the moment, the idea had merit. Godric nodded and leaned forward to press a kiss to Salazar’s lips. Salazar kissed back briefly, before standing. “Now come,” he said, “and look at these plans like you’re supposed to before I shackle you to the desk, my Lord Gryffindor.”</p>
