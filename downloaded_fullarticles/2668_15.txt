    <p>There are many different ways to worship. A religious person can be found in a church, worshipping to a god who they believe will save them from their sins. A peasant can be found worshipping their kings or queens, hoping that one day, maybe, just maybe, they’ll be royalty as well. </p>
<p>And then, there are the lovers. A lover can worship their partner’s body, showing them in more ways than one how much they appreciate them and, maybe, if they’re lucky, love them. Worshipping your lover is no different from worshipping a deity or a royal — they become your goddess as you feast on the honey that drips from the hollows of their body, hoping that it will sweeten your wickedness. They become your queen as they grace you with their unholy moans and sultry smiles as you beg to become their king — an equal.</p>
<p>Tom Riddle was no stranger to worship. He was used to being worshipped. The moment his voice lowered to a smooth baritone and he began to stand at 6’ 5”, all of the witches, older and younger, began flocking to him as if he were a king. They sighed at his dark, dreamy eyes, hoping to peer into them and finding more about this mystery of a man. They longed to run their fingers through his thick, wavy brown hair. With his pale skin, high cheekbones, and hollowed cheeks, he could have passed for the Lord of the Underworld in another lifetime. He was darkness and beauty mixed into one dangerous combination, but they wanted to worship him. Yes, they wanted to worship him so badly. He could be their Hades and they would be his Persephone. </p>
<p>But the witches weren’t the only ones worshipping him. The wizards worshipped him as well. Tom Riddle became the epitome of what it meant to be an aristocratic wizard. He was intelligent, dignified, charismatic, but most importantly, powerful. Despite wanting so badly to hate the wizard (what’s his lineage?), most found that it was impossible. Those who tried to judge him on a bloodline he couldn’t control found themselves at the end of his wand and his eyes that looked like smudged charcoal would flash dangerously. Those who were looking closely would find that it would flash red with his temper. The wizards were positively terrified of him, but they worshipped him and became his Knights of Walpurgis in hopes of becoming something akin to their Lord — not his queen, of course, but the enforcers of his will and with it, glory. </p>
<p>Tom has never had the inclination to worship anything in his life. He could be obsessive, yes, but worshipful? No. No deity could exist and allow a wizard of his magnitude to live in such conditions. </p>
<p>No, Tom truly had never wanted to worship anyone until the first day of his seventh year when Headmaster Dippet introduced the students to the new Arithmancy professor, Hermione Granger, and he felt her magic against his skin and he wanted to moan out loud at how pleasurable it felt. It felt positively sinful. </p>
<p>The witch was young for a professor, but he felt her power and he wanted her as his in every possible meaning of the word. He reached out with his magic and tentatively caressed hers. Her eyes found his across the Great Hall and he deigned the witch with a smirk. She gave him a tight smile in return before resuming conversation with the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.</p>
<p>He would have to have her as his. </p>
<p>He would worship her without hesitation.</p>
