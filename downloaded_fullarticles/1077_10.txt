    <p>Harry grinned. He listened as Ron regaled him and Hermione with stories from his summer holiday in Egypt. The trio sat in the dimly lit dining room of the Leaky Cauldron. Their conversation was light and bubbly. Harry found himself laughing more in one interaction than he had during the whole summer. After fleeing the Dursley’s, he had spent three delightful weeks with free reign of Diagon alley, but it was nothing compared to reuniting with his two best friends.</p><p>They had written him ahead of time to tell him they would be there for the last day of break, but they had only arrived an hour ago. Molly Weasley had come in, followed by a wake of boisterous red-headed teens. After enveloping Harry in a big hug, she had requested that the trio wait a little longer before doing their shopping. Apparently, Mr. Weasley was picking up a transfer student that would be joining their year. Molly had hoped they would show him around.</p><p>The friends exchanged glances before they agreed to wait. Hermione was clearly anxious about buying her materials at the last minute, but she agreed when Mrs. Weasley requested it. She empathized with the plight of newcomers to magical London. Navigating Diagon Alley for the first time was intimidating.</p><p>For a little while, the kids speculated about the new student. Hermione and Ron both confirmed that a student entering Hogwarts after first year was unusual, but they quickly grew bored with the topic. Instead, they were swept up in the joy of seeing each other again.</p><p>When Mr. Weasley arrived at the inn half an hour later, the conversation was still going strong. A short blond kid in a bright red coat trailed after him. He stood back awkwardly while Mr. Weasley cheerfully greeted the trio. The boy busied himself looking around the Leaky Cauldron. His apprehensive look faded to one of boredom. Finally, Arthur noticed the curious looks the trio were directing at the newcomer. “Oh, how rude of me. This is Edward Elric.”</p><p>Edward’s attention snapped back to the conversation at hand. He straightened his posture and extended a gloved hand to each of them in turn. He had a firm handshake. He met their gazes with his own. “Please, call me Ed.” He said in a thickly accented voice. They introduced themselves in return. Once this ritual was completed, he returned to slouching and averting his eyes.</p><p>After a little more conversation, Harry, Ron, and Hermione led Ed through the back door to Diagon Alley. They stopped at Gringotts first. Ron and Harry waited on the steps for Ed and Hermione to sort out their money. They rendez-voued with the other Weasleys at Flourish and Blots. Hermione went to find several volumes she needed for extra courses she was taking. Ron wondered aloud when she planned on sleeping. She rolled her eyes.</p><p>While she searched, Harry helped Ed find the second-year textbooks. As they looked, Ed explained that he was allowed to start in the third year, even though he hadn’t studied magic before, but he was expected to catch up on the earlier course work. He had the first-year books delivered to his home when he had first found out he was attending Hogwarts. He had only just finished them.</p><p>Harry wondered why Ed had not been in school before this year. What had changed this year? Perhaps some of Elric’s awkwardness could be attributed to isolation from other kids their age. Harry was pulled from his thoughts when he had to drag Ed away from the random books he wandered off to inspect. Ed eventually agreed to stick to the list when Harry described the Hogwarts library to him.</p><p>Next, the extended group went to buy potions ingredients while Ed acquired more essentials. Hermione broke off with Harry to buy new robes, while Mrs. Weasley took Ed and Ron to purchase wands. Ed arrived at Madame Malkin's with a long box stuffed in his bag, just as Hermione was checking out. She and Harry waited for him to be fitted. Then, the three of them met Ron in front of Olivander’s. A huge grin split his face. He held his new wand out for them to inspect, “Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail hair.” He said proudly, before taking it back and placing it carefully back in its box.</p><p>“Nice.” Hermione said, “What about you, Ed? I don’t think you've said.”</p><p>Ed pulled the box from his bag and read the chicken scratch on the side to jog his memory. His mouth twisted in confusion, “It’s eleven inches, fir with unicorn hair. I don’t really know what any that means though.”</p><p>“You should read up on the wand woods once we get to school. It’s really quite interesting, if a little subjective,” Hermione said. Ed nodded.</p><p>After they bought their supplies, Hermione announced that she wanted an owl. Ed looked baffled. She explained the owl post to him as Harry led them to the Magical Menagerie. The confused look turned into a thoughtful expression.</p><p>The room the group entered was full of scratching and shrieking. They inspected the different, oddly colors animals as they walked through. Hermione fell in love with a huge orange cat that was dead set on attacking Ron’s rat. She forewent the owl, much to Ron’s displeasure. Harry, Ron, and Hemione waited outside the shop while Ed looked at the different owls. Hermione busied herself petting the cat, whom she dubbed Crookshanks. She scratched him behind his ears, eliciting a loud rumbling purr.</p><p>After a moment, Ed ran over to them. He carried a cage containing a nondescript brown owl with tufts of feathers sticking out from its head at awkward angles. Ed apologized for holding them up before stopping to pet Crookshanks. He said something in a language that Harry does not recognize. The words were unfamiliar, but they sounded suspiciously like cooing. Hermione smiled and told them that at least one of the boys had good taste in cats.</p><p>---</p><p>That night, Harry walked down the stairs to fetch a tonic for Ron’s rat. He paused. He could hear bits a whispered conversation between the Weasleys. They debated whether to tell him that the escaped murder convict he keeps seeing on the news, Sirius Black, was out to get him.</p><p>He frowned. With all this fuss there was no way he would be allowed to visit Hogsmede.</p><p>When the Weasleys left, he crept into the room. He was preoccupied with what he had heard, so he didn’t notice Ed sitting at one of the tables right away. When he did, Harry noted with confusion that Ed was obviously in ear shot of the conversation. Had the Weasleys not noticed, or did they not care? Ed was fixated on the second-year potions textbook and he hadn’t looked up when Harry entered. Harry grabbed the rat tonic from under the table and took his leave as quietly as he could.</p><p>---</p><p>The next day, they rode in ministry cars to the station. Ed seemed a little unsure when faced with the barrier to platform 3 ¾. Ginny showed him how to get through the barrier, and they walked out of sight together. Hermione and Ron followed them into the crowd. Harry was about to join them when Arthur pulled him aside.</p><p>Harry called to his friends to save him a seat and Ron gave him a thumbs-up as he disappeared into the train. When Harry turned around, Arthur wore a serious look. He told Harry urgently that Sirius had a grudge against him, but Harry interrupted to admit him that he overheard the conversation last night. He assured Mr. Weasley that he was not scared.</p><p>Weasley ignored this intent, and repeated that Hogwarts was safe and that the ministry had put extra protection in place, “That’s why Elric is here.” He said off-handedly.</p><p>Harry drew his eyebrows together, “What has he got to do with anything?”</p><p>“Never mind that, it’s mostly a bunch of political nonsense anyway. What’s important is that your safe a Hogwarts. Promise me you won’t go looking for Black.” Harry felt a little indignant and a little confused; why on earth would he go looking for a murderer? Nevertheless, he promised. A cheerful, but strained, expression quickly returned to Arthur’s face. He gave Harry a hug and waved to him as he boarded the train.</p><p>Once he was inside the Hogwarts express, Harry walked past the compartments. He couldn’t wait to tell his friends what he had learned. He found them at the end of the hall waiting for him. Hermione indicated the door to the left. “It’s the only compartment left with enough room.” The three of them entered and remarked on the new professor dosing inside. Hermione pointed out the name on his luggage tag. When Harry was sure that Professor Lupin was asleep, he eagerly explained his conversation with Mr. Weasley.</p><p>“What has Ed got to do with keeping you safe?” Ron asked.</p><p>“Or with politics, for that matter,” Hermione added.</p><p>Harry just shrugged. His friends turned the discussion back to Sirius Black. They kept shooting him concerned looks but he couldn't bring himself to care. He was far more curious about the enigma, Edward Elric.</p>
