  <p>Harry was running through the downpour with his hand above his head and the other tugging his lightened trunk behind him. He sighed as he reached the overhang that protected the entrance to King's Cross station which housed the magical platform 9 and three quarters. He smiled as he thought of the exciting fourth year he was to spend at his real home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This year would be the fourth year he would attend the magical home that had been a nine month reprieve from the hell that he had associated with his previous sleeping arrangements with the Dursley family. Harry knew that something big was going to happen this year, and this thing had nothing to do with Tom Riddle, at least he hoped it wouldn't. He didn't know exactly what was going to happen since the Weasleys had managed to stay tight lipped about it over the time he had spent with them since the Quidditch World Cup this past summer. But he did know that it was supposed to be something big and it was to be very entertaining. Honestly, he was hoping it would be something that might actually allow him to avoid more fame and just be able to enjoy a single year at his home.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Quidditch world cup had been very fun to watch and even the horrible way it had ended, with a dark mark in the sky, it was still one of the most notable magical experiences that Harry had ever had. Harry was brought out of his musing as he turned to look at Ron and Hermione appear from the deluge followed quickly by Ginny, the twins, Charlie, and then Mrs. Weasley. He wasted no time in moving forward and creating a path through the myriad of people on the platforms so that his friends could follow him. It took them little time to reach the pillar which acted as the portal from the Muggle world to the magical platform. Harry was used to the portal after three years of using it and quickly moved through the portal.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry moved to the side as he watched his companions move through the portal and gather together before goodbyes were started. Mrs. Weasley started to berate the Twins and doted upon Ginny as Hermione, Ron, and Harry stood to the side, "I think we should go put our trunks in our compartment then we can come back." Harry whispered to his friends as it looked like Mrs. Weasley was on a bit of a tirade, "We have the time." Hermione looked slightly apprehensive about just leaving but Ron nodded almost immediately and Hermione, somewhat reluctantly, followed her two friends onto the Hogwarts Express.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry led the way down the narrow hallway with Ron and Hermione following. They were about halfway through the train when they finally found an empty compartment and Harry stepped forward, blocking the entrance from the other side as Hermione and Ron filed into the compartment. Harry was about to step into the compartment himself when he felt a hand land on his shoulder and he turned to see who was there.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Hey Harry." Angelina Johnson said as she stood in front of him, wearing a very flattering tanktop that clearly strained against her recent growth in bust line, or merely a growth Harry had never noticed before. Harry's eyes wandered down his fellow Quidditch player's body and he had to swallow the glob of spit that appeared on his tongue as he saw her bare stomach, the toned muscles which were displayed were obviously results from her training for quidditch. Her skin rippled as she took a breath and Harry appreciated the darker skin tone she possessed, something akin to milk chocolate if he had to place a color to it. She had on blue jeans which hugged her figure nicely and caused Harry to gulp once more before his eyes snapped back up to Angelina's brown eyes. A smirk played at her lips as she saw Harry blush, "Have a nice summer?" she asked.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry nodded mutely and he blushed slightly as her eyes roved over his own figure. He did puff his chest out slightly in pride as Sirius had seen how malnourishment and years of physical abuse, not in beatings so much as being locked up constantly, had taken their toll on Harry's health. Sirius had sent Harry to Madam Pomfrey for a full physical and Madam Pomfrey had provided him with potions and a daily regiment of food and exercise that Harry had adhered to all throughout the summer, except for when he was with the Weasleys. When Harry had asked her why she hadn't done this before, she had replied by saying that she was going to start him on it during this year but didn't want to start too early since his body was still too weak from his previous malnourishment. The past three years of Hogwarts food and decent food outside of Hogwarts resulted in him finally being capable of following her regime. He reminded himself that he needed to thank Madam Pomfrey when he reached the school.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry had shot up a few inches over the summer and his previous description of "small and skinny" no longer fit the broad chested teenager that now graced the Hogwarts express. He had always been forced to tilt his head up to see Angelina, whom was a slightly tall girl herself, but now all he had to do was flick his eyes up to see her face. His legs and arms were no longer simply skin and bones. He had acquired a slight level of muscle coating his entire body and Harry, for the first time, was quite proud of his body.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Well, I wanted to talk to you about the Quidditch Team this year, mind sitting with me for some of the trip?" she asked. Harry blinked and looked over at his friends, whom were just now realizing Harry hadn't joined them. Harry thought about it before he answered.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Hermione, Ron." he called to them and they both looked at him, "Angelina needs me for something important, could you let Mrs. Weasley know that I will send her an owl once we settle in tomorrow?" he asked. He didn't really want to go back out onto the platform and be hugged by the woman again. While he enjoyed the fact that she considered him close enough to the family that she would treat him like that, her constant mothering and almost smothering of him was beginning to grate on his nerves. It may be because he was a teenager or maybe he had only just realized this but she really did treat him as if he was her own, but that sometimes infringed upon things that he felt should be his own interests. The most glaring of these was the fact that he had no idea why he had allowed her to hold his vault key. He still had yet to get the key back from her since second year, when she confiscated it.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Is it really so important that you can't even say goodbye to her?" Hermione asked as she narrowed her eyes at Angelina. Harry could understand her hesitance but he quickly cut her off.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"You know I wouldn't cut out if I didn't have to Hermione, please just tell her for me, okay?" he asked with a slight pleading in his voice. Hermione stared at him for a few moments before Ron cut in.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"It's fine Hermione. I'll let her know, mate. Come on Hermione." he said as he gently led Hermione back into the corridor and then back the way they had come before Hermione could say anything else.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry breathed a sigh of relief as he turned back to see Angelina slightly amused, "Thanks Angelina, you have no idea how happy I am to have a reason to avoid that hug." he said as he shivered slightly.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina smiled wider, "No problem Harry, I know what you mean." At Harry's raised eyebrow she turned and began to walk down the hallway, "I entertained the idea of dating George one year and a single meeting with Mrs. Weasley kinda put me off." she admitted as she made sure he was following her. Harry smirked slightly and nodded he understood why.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"It's not that she isn't trying to look out for me, it's just she smothers me a bit." Harry commented.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina tossed a smirk over her shoulder, "Why Harry!" she exclaimed, "Is that some hint of teenage rebelliousness I hear?" Harry blushed slightly and sputtered a negative even as Angelina giggled in front of him. Harry stopped in the corridor and stared at Angelina with slightly narrowed eyes as he listened to the girlish gesture he was now sure he had never heard pass from her lips before. Aneglina took a few more steps before realizing that Harry wasn't following her and raised an eyebrow at his still form, "What?" she asked as she looked at him.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry shook his head, "Just don't think I've ever heard you giggle before." he admitted. He blinked as he could have sworn her cheeks darkened just a bit before she turned from him, "It's nice." he said as he took a few steps to fall back in line behind her. Angelina didn't respond as she moved forward and into another car of the train before stepping up to a compartment and waving him inside. Harry glanced at her cheeks but the darkened skin he swore he saw earlier was gone, replaced by the normal milk chocolate color.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry stepped into the compartment and blinked in surprise when he noticed that the other two chasers on the Quidditch team were present. Katie Bell was a year older than Harry, as opposed to Angelina and Alicia whom were both two years older than himself. Her blonde hair meshed happily with her hazel eyes, which combined with her light skin, led to Katie being one of the most talked about witches in Harry's year. His other teammate, Alicia Spinnet, was a dark skinned girl, if Angelina was milk chocolate then Alicia would be dark chocolate. Her skin was not so dark, however, that she would be mistaken for someone from, say, Africa. Her dark brown hair combined with a light brown pair of eyes complimented her perfectly. Overall, Harry was suddenly feeling very self conscious about himself as he realized that he had been on a team with three of, what he considered, the hottest witches currently at Hogwarts and never realized it.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Another realization that struck Harry was that Hogwarts robes should be banned, or he should have been smacked into noticing girls sooner as he noticed how well endowed his teammates really were. Of course, the tight shirts they were wearing along with the tight jeans, all remniscient of Angelina's outfit didn't seem to be trying to hide much, all three of their toned stomachs were on display as Harry gulped and stepped into the compartment, placing his trunk above the benchs while he greeted his teammates, "Morning Alicia, Katie. How was your summer?" he asked.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"It was great, how did you like the Quidditch Cup Harry?" Katie said happily. Harry blinked slightly, not even knowing that Katie had been there.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Mine was fine, Thanks for asking Harry." Alicia said quietly. She had always seemed like a quiet person, very rarely speaking up except for the one time he had seen her defend Hermione rather viciously from Malfoy when he had called Hermione a mudblood. That was not to say she was shy, she would easily speak up if she had to, it just seemed she was averse to loud noises.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry smiled at his teammates and heard Angelina close the door to the corridor with a quiet snap as he replied to Katie's question, "It was great until after... well you know." he said with a sheepish grin. Katie nodded and sat back in her bench. Alicia and Angelina occupied one side of the compartment so Harry slid down into the seat next to Katie as he felt the train begin to move towards Hogwarts.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A comfortable silence fell upon the group as they looked out the window and watched the express pull away from the station. Harry had always enjoyed watching the scenery as it passed from downtown bustling London to the plains that surrounded the track the Hogwarts Express took to the ancient castle. Harry suspected that was because he got to travel so little during his life and the way the scenery changed slightly fascinated him. The transition took almost thirty minutes of their trip and Harry had finally gotten his fill of the fascinating scenery, so he turned to ask Angelina what she wanted to talk about in regards to quidditch.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He was slightly surprised when he noticed that the three girls, women, he corrected himself, were holding a seemingly quiet conversation with glances much like he was capable of with Hermione, and to a lesser extent, Ron. He waited a few more seconds before he saw their eyes all flicker to him and they all noticed he was sitting there with a smile on his face. It widened when Katie spoke, "Sorry about that Harry, we get so into each other's minds that we sometimes don't even realize it." she apologized.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry shook his head, "Don't apologize, I bet that's why you guys...women" he quickly corrected himself when he remembered how Angelina had always corrected Oliver about his way of addressing the team, "are such great chasers." he praised as he noticed Angelina, and Katie were both smiling at his change as Alicia cocked her head curiously. "That's got to be dead useful. I'm slightly jealous that I can't do that with Ron." he admitted to their obvious pleasure, "It would certainly help out alot." he admitted.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>All three women shared a small smile before Alicia's quiet voice cut through the happiness, "Can you do it with Hermione?" she asked.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry blinked in surprised at the question and the women all focused on him, leading him to blush slightly as he ran a hand through his hair in a nervous habit, "Uh, well yeah." he admitted to the women's curious looks, he thought back and added, "I think ever since she got unpetrified at the end of our second year we could sort of hold our conversations like that. It got stronger last year, our fight only seemed to enhance it once I got over being such a git." he said.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The women giggled at his admission and Harry blushed slightly. He knew he had been a git to Hermione and he had apologized profusely after realizing this during last year. Luckily, she had forgiven him with little fuss, stating she knew how he felt but she had done what she had to in order to keep him safe. Harry, looking back on it, was grateful for her stance as she was always looking out for him.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"You weren't being too much of a git Harry. I mean she did go behind your back." Angelina pointed out.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry shook his head, "Yeah, but she did it to look out for me. Regardless, I shouldn't have just disregarded her like that. She's been the voice of reason for the past three years and I shouldn't treat her the way I did." he admitted. Harry wasn't above admitting his faults. He knew he had them but he was constantly trying to better himself, if only to ensure he survived his next year of schooling.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"That's good Harry. I know Hermione was really upset when you wouldn't talk to her." Katie said as Angelina shrugged her shoulders. Harry frowned at Katie's admission.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"I know, and I'm hoping that I can make that up to her. I figured I'd buckle down and study a bit more this year. My grades could use the boost anyways." he admitted to the women's chuckles. Seeing that the time had flown, despite how little the four of them had talked, Harry noticed that it probably wouldn't be too much longer before they reached the place where they would need to switch into their robes. "So, what did you want to talk about Angelina?" he asked curiously, "I'm guessing that you were made captain for this year."</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>All three women shared a look that Harry could not miss. He wondered silently what was going on. "Well, I was going to be captain but because of the Tri-wizard Tournament, Quidditch won't be happening this year. Professor Mcgonagall explained that in her letter to me about why I didn't get the captain's badge." Angelina said quietly.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry blinked and then blinked again as he looked at the three women who were now watching him intently. Slowly, his mind processed what Angelina said and then he frowned, "What's a Tri-wizard tournament got to do with Quidditch? What is a Tri-wizard Tournament?" he asked quickly.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>All three women blinked before Angelina and Katie turned to Alicia, "Harry," Alicia said quietly, "what exactly do you know about our world?" she asked just as quietly.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry blinked before looking at his teammates in confusion then sighed, "I was muggle raised, so I only know what I've learned in the past few years. I'm not allowed to study outside of school so I really know almomst nothing outside of Hogwarts' teachings. Hedwig isn't allowed outside of my house because of how noticeable she is." he admitted. The three sharp inhales of breath told Harry something was wrong, it was Alicia's response, which was quickly gaurded by Angelina's quick wand work, that surprised him the most.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"What the hell is wrong with Dumbledore?" she raged, the quietness which had prevailed in her words completely gone as she shouted, "How the hell were you supposed to know about all of this if he didn't teach you or at least provide ways of getting the information. Has he at least hinted at telling you more of our world as your magical guardian?" Alicia had quieted during her short rant but Harry's confused look seemed to incense her further.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Magical guardian?" Harry's tone of voice told the three women that Harry had no idea what that meant.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For the first time in his life, Harry was scared of his fellow teammate as Alicia's brown eyes seemed to become alight with a flame that burned with the same intensity of Hermione's passion for books. "That- That!" Alicia uttered a scream of rage as she collapsed into her seat with her hand over her eyes as she took a few shuddering breaths. Harry, Angelina, and Katie all stared at their teammate in mute shock as the girl managed to get a handle on her feelings before snapping her eyes back onto Harry's. "In order Harry," she said, her voice was not quite normal but she was no longer shouting, "A magical guardian is the person whom is assigned to any muggleborn or muggle raised wizard or witch who is supposed to prepare you for your life in the wizarding world. Normally, this would be your head of house but the Headmaster seems to take an inordinate amount of interest in you so I would guess he is yours." Alicia told Harry to his astonishment. "You should have been told all of this during your Hogwart's interview."</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Interview?" Harry almost squeaked, hoping Alicia didn't blow up again.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Alicia looked angry yet again before she hid it, "Yes, interview. Didn't a teacher come to collect you since you live with muggles?" she asked.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry nodded, "Hagrid did. He took me to diagon alley and had me take money out of my vault before we got my school supplies. I was only told to get to the platform on September 1st and be on time. I didn't even know how to get on the platform until the Weasley's passed me while muttering muggles." he informed them.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Alicia sighed, "I'm beginning to believe all those stories that trouble just follows you Harry." Alicia said with a small grin as Harry grinned morosely back, "Well, Dumbledore, or any of the Heads of House, should have met you to inform you of our world and what you were in store for before taking you to Diagon Alley." she told Harry. "As for the Tri-wizard Tournament and what it has to do with Quidditch," Here Alicia straightened and Harry had a flash of Hermione over the smaller chaser from his team and he grinned, "The Tri-wizard tournament is one of the most highly anticipated and entertaining tournaments in our world. It is held between three schools and each school has a champion that is chosen by an ancient magical artifact. The champions then compete in a series of contests that result in someone winning fame and, usually, a very nice cash prize."</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry nodded, "As for Quidditch, it would interfere with a champion's ability to compete so it's scrapped so the champions can focus on their tasks." Harry hung his head. He had been looking forward to a year of playing quidditch again. Then, a lightbulb went off above his head.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Wait a minute," he said as he narrowed his eyes at Angelina, whom suddenly was smirking, "if there isn't any quidditch then what could you possibly want to talk about quidditch with me?" he asked crossly.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina, Katie, and even Alicia, smirked as they all looked at him, "Do I need a reason to want to sit with the only boy who wouldn't ogle us three like we're pieces of meat and would act as the perfect shield to unwanted attention?" she asked innocently.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry blinked and Alicia and Katie giggled slightly as the words processed before he blushed, slightly in happiness and slightly in anger at being used, "You couldn't just ask me that could you?" he asked irately.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina chuckled herself as Katie stepped forward with the answer this time, the way they kept going back and forth was reminding him a bit of the twins, "Would you have agreed if she had? Knowing that meant that Hermione and Ron would be alone without you?" she asked. Harry opened his mouth to retort yes but he stopped before he uttered what, he knew, would be a lie. He slowly closed his mouth and pursed his lips slightly as he looked at the three of them with narrowed eyes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"I don't appreciate being used like that though." he said, his anger dwindling in the sight of their gazes. These women had been his teammates for years and Harry didn't really mind that they had used him in this way, simply that they hadn't told him until just now.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Aww, did the big man get his feelings hurt?" Angelina asked mockingly, and Harry bristled, "Girls, I think we should reward our little hero for keeping the unwanteds away." she said. Harry blinked as he watched Alicia, Katie, and Angelina blush, Angelina noticeably less than the others but Katie and Alicia both stepped closer to where he had shot up from his seat and leaned in quickly to lay quick kisses on his cheeks. He felt his anger dissipate as quickly as it appeared under his first cheek kiss ever, from a girl near his age. He stood dazed for a few seconds before he came back to his senses only to have his mind fried as Angelina's lips descended upon his own, those soft and luscious lips pressed to his firmly for a few seconds, just long enough to give him a tease before pulling back agonizingly slow.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>An eternity later, Harry could hear Angelina speak as if she were miles away and not standing right in front of him, "Is your male ego thoroughly restored?" she asked cheekily. Harry nodded dumbly as the girls blushed and giggled at his awestruck face. "Well, I think we need to-"</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Wait Angelina." Alicia said as she leaned forward and smacked Harry lightly on his cheek to get his attention, "Harry, I need you to concentrate. I need an answer to this question." she said seriously and Harry shook his head to clear his mind, he could swear that veela had just cast their charm on him again as he tried to clear his thoughts. A few moments later Harry nodded, "Okay, did you ever get a talk at the end of second year about something very important?" she asked.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry felt more than saw Katie and Angelina suck in their breaths again as he racked his brain for anything they could be talking about. His escapades in the chamber of secrets wasn't very well known but it was documented. However, even as addled as he was, Harry could tell she was talking something a bit more general in the way that it would pertain to almost everyone. He finally decided he had no idea what she was talking about and shook his head no. The answering swear words was not what he was expecting. "Is there something wrong?" he asked in concern.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He barely noted the way their eyes seemed to connect before he was answered, "Not really. We need to change now Harry, would you mind going back to Ron and Hermione?" they asked and Harry was suddenly shoved out into the hallway with his robes in his hands. He blinked in surprise before looking at the compartment behind him in curiosity. He shrugged his shoulders, deciding he wouldn't ask what those women were thinking before making his way to where he was sure Hermione and Ron would pester him about his absence.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <hr/>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry sighed in relief, as he heard Dumbledore's declaration that only wizards who were of age would be capable of competing for the cup. If he were capable of competing in the tournament, he had no doubts that the Weasleys would try to pressure him into putting his name in for consideration. While he could refuse them, Harry didn't know why he held no backbone when it came to his friends. He could easily put Malfoy in his place but when his friends said or did something Harry was usually the first to jump the train heading out their station instead of waiting peacefully on the platform for a less crowded and dangerous train.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Meeting his friends on the train had led to exactly what Harry had expected, a full questioning on what Angelina had wanted, which he easily admitted that she had told him no quidditch would happen this year. When Ron had been struck dumb, Hermione started in on him about why that wouldn't happen and he enjoyed teasing them just like Charlie had for the past week, since he now knew what he had been alluding to.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The deluge of water hadn't let up since their trip began and the trip from the express to the carriages, and then to the castle itself, had left most of the students soaked. It was a good thing the Great hall was warmer than usual to ward off from having the students get colds. After the sorting, Dumbledore had begun to announce the tournament when their new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher appeared before them. After he had been introduced, and the whispers about him silenced, Dumbledore informed the school of the history and purpose of the Tournament before mentioning the limitation.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Of course, as Dumbledore prattled on in the background, Harry smirked to himself as he thought of Dumbledore 'prattling'. Harry's eyes wandered the Great Hall. He smirked as he saw Malfoy's sullen disposition at the declaration, as his eyes slid then to the Ravenclaw table locking onto an attractive witch by the name of Cho Chang. Harry had been nursing a small crush on her since a little after Christmas last year. Though he knew nothing about her past the fact she was an intelligent witch, much like Hermione, and very easy on the eyes, as Seamus would say, he had a few fantasies of him asking her to accompany him on a moonlit walk around the lake with his cloak and then them sharing a very sweet kiss.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry was surprised then, when he looked at Cho and felt none of the warmth that had previously associated with her visage. This caused him to frown and, as he wished for those warm feelings to return, he felt his eyes slid quickly to a group of three women whom were sitting further down his own table. He blushed as he felt those feelings return full force as he thought of how their lips had felt against his skin. Harry shivered slightly as he felt his body react to the thoughts he was having.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He was quickly brought back to reality when Dumbledore managed to quiet the outrage that followed his declaration, "The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and will be remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts chamion when he or she is selected. I believe that is the end of our welcome feast. Welcome again our new students," he said nodding to the young, wide-eyed first years, "and welcome back for our older students, " he inclined his head again, "I hope you all have a wonderful year, Bedtime!" he ended with a happy shout as his eyes twinkled.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As the students began filing out of the Great Hall, Harry remained in his seat, allowing the complaining Weasleys to precede him so he could think in peace. He didn't really want to enter the tournament anyways, he was more confused on why he had so quickly lost his feelings for Cho and how easily they had transferred to his teammates. He stopped dead in the middle of the corridor he was using to avoid the bulk of the students moving around the castle as his eyes shrunk to pinpoints, "I fancy Alicia, Angelina, and Katie?" he whispered to himself and the warmth that filled him was not unlike what he had felt for Cho, only about twice as strong. He shook his head and leaned against the wall to keep himself upright. How the bloody hell did that happen?</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He considered this momentarily and decided that it must have been when they kissed him. While he had fantasies about kissing Cho, Alicia, Katie, and especially Angelina, had kissed him in the real world. Not to mention, he knew them much better than he did Cho. While he admittedly knew little about them personally, he knew their personalities from working with them in the team and knew that they were all wonderful people whom others were always happy to befriend.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>But there was a problem, while Harry may fancy them, that would mean he needed to pick one, and he never wanted to do that. While he fancied them all, he would rather be a friend to all of them than be the boyfriend to just one. So, just as this realization came to him, Harry decided quickly that he would get to know the women a bit better, just to be a better friend for them in the future.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Running a hand through his hair, Harry sighed as he felt how disgusting the rainwater had made his hair and decided a nice hot shower would be called for when he reached his dorm. With this thought firmly in mind, Harry hurried to his dorm, hoping to beat the rest of his roommates.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <hr/>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry walked towards the showers for the Gryffindors, which were conveniently located on the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh floors of the dormitories for the guys. The showers held the same principle of whom could use the showers depending upon what year you were in. The first and second years shared the second floor bathroom, which was less spacious than all but the seventh floor bathroom. The third and fourth years shared the one on the fourth floor, which was the most spacious and was a bit less comfortable than the sixth floor bathroom while the sixth floor bathroom was used by the fifth and sixth years. Only the seventh year students got to use their bathroom exclusively within their own year.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Each of the bathrooms increased in elegance and comfort until the seventh year's bathroom, which was supposed to be so comfortable that some people had spent whole weekends just soaking in the water, if rumors were to be believed. Harry had smiled when he found his room empty except for Hedwig, who had merely hooted at him before flying out of the open window, which wasn't allowing any rain inside, and towards the owlery where she would spend most of his school year at. He had quickly gathered his things and headed towards his bathroom, allowing him to slip into the bathroom just as he heard the noise level increase dramatically in the common room.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry smiled as he looked at the familiar lion trimmings which highlighted the room. The room was oval in shape, with the entire floor slanted so that the water from the faucets which lined the walls ran towards the center of the room and down the drain set there. Surrounding each set of faucets were a set of walls which blocked fellow shower-goers from showcasing to their partners what they were washing. These walls came equipped with a magical curtain that could be pulled to hide the alcoves from view if one wanted. Most of the guys washed in their bathing suits so the curtains were used only when the guys were interested in a complete body wash.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry, however, never liked bathing with a bathing suit on, he still felt dirty if he didn't wash himself completely so he always used a curtain to wash himself, this had the added effect that the staring that had Harry so uncomfortable during his first year was stopped by said curtain. Harry walked all the way to the other side of the room and entered the showering stall that was the biggest because of it's position. He pulled the curtain shut and let out a small sigh of relief as he relaxed. This was probably one of the only times Harry had ever been able to let himself completely relax because he was sure that the curtain would keep out anyone and everyone. As a result, Harry always took a shower his first night at Hogwarts to allow himself to unwind from the Dursleys.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry slowly and methodically divested himself of his school robes, hanging them in the small alcove within his alcove that had another curtain which allowed him to pull it close and keep his clothes dry as he washed. Harry turned the water on to the perfect temperature, half a turn for the hot water and just a splash of cold, for his shower and allowed the water to heat up for a few seconds before passing a hand underneath the head of the nozzle. It was spraying a gentle spread spray down upon his alcove, leaving him a small place in the corner to hide from the blast of cold water at the beginning.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry smiled when he felt how comfortable the temperature was and stepped under the water. He was allowing the soothing motion of the water flowing over his body to relax his tense body and he could feel the tension flowing away with the water. Harry took his time in washing himself, enjoying how clean he felt being back at Hogwarts and finally having time to enjoy his shower.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As Harry washed himself, he let his mind wander. His thoughts were not in any logical order, he just allowed his consciousness to float about in his head, allowing any errant thought or idea that came through his mind. Series of events that had happened to him flashed through his mind, starting with Hagrid's appearance at that hut on the sea, he remembered his first trip to Gringotts, which led him to handing Molly his key, then his mind latched onto how much money he actually owned. He had never gotten a full account of what was in his vault; he had been too overwhelmed with everything that had been happening to him. The thought of his money brought him back to the Dursleys as he thought of what they would do if they found out he owned so much money and the clenching of his fists quickly before he relaxed again showed that he didn't like what that thought brought.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This thought also brought him to Dudley and what his overweight cousin would spend his money on, if he didn't use it all for food. You see, Harry had found Dudley's small and budding stash of adult picture books. The first book Harry had grabbed had a very busty, a term Harry learned from the books, blonde woman whom was holding her breasts enticingly on the front. Flipping through the book, Harry had been surprised and a bit freaked out when he saw the various sexual acts that had been depicted within. Harry had no idea where the big whale had obtained those books but Harry had been intrigued. Unfortunately, he had almost been found out the first time he found the books when he was cleaning and hastily grabbed a single book to inspect before replacing the stash so Dudley didn't know what had happened.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As it turned out, the book he grabbed had been an informative book that explained about sex and its function. Harry had been fascinated when he learned that this was how babies were made and set out to learn more but had been stopped at the library by age requirements. The first time he asked the local librarian about books for it, the woman had made wide eyes at him and told him to ask his Aunt and Uncle. Harry knew he couldn't do this so he snuck the book he had taken from Dudley back into the whale's collection and proceeded to learn as much as he could from the pictures and explanations within the risque books.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As a result, Harry had been quite aroused a number of times when reading those books but had rarely touched himself. Any time that he had attempted to simulate a handjob left Harry feeling dissatisfied as when he was coming to completion, he felt an odd stirring inside himself and had always been stopped by slight fear that what he was doing was immoral.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Despite this, Harry now knew what sex was and had seen several pictures of nude women which had led to a few fantasies that had him taking his relationship with Cho a step further on that moonlit walk. While he was thinking of this, Harry felt his mind float into that fantasy once again. He felt the slight tingle that the cool air placed upon his skin. Warmth radiated from his hand, where Cho's hand was entangled, and his lips from where Cho had recently kissed him. He blinked in surprise when he felt Cho pushing him back, and his body responding in kind to the interesting ways that he lips felt against his own.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He felt his back land against the trunk of a sizeable tree and he groaned lightly in response to the digging of tree bark into his back. His erection throbbed in time with his heart as he felt a, now, familiar heat pool below his waist. He groaned into Cho's mouth as she stuck her tongue into his mouth and then pulled back, leaving Harry's glasses slightly askew while his chest expanded as he took his extended breath. Cho smirked at him, and in an almost serpentine fashion, slid her body down his own. Harry immediately wished that they were both naked so that they could have the most skin to skin contact, but Cho seemed to smile wider as she slowed her movements to make the moment last a bit longer.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry shivered as he felt her breasts barely brush his erection. He sucked in an even bigger breath as he felt Cho's hands deftly unbuckle his pants and slid them down his legs so that he was left in only his boxers, which did a poor job of controlling the raging erection he had acquired from Cho's actions. Quickly, Cho ripped his boxers down his legs and his erection bobbed before her. Then, Cho did something that Harry had always woken up from before they could start, She licked her lips in an obvious display of lust before opening her mouth as wide as she could and swallowing a few inches of his member down her hot and wet cavern. Harry groaned as his hips bucked as his head was thrown back, eyes closed as he tried to get more of his cock into Cho's mouth.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry felt Cho's tongue cup the underside of his member and she caressed him a few times before pushing forward slightly then pulling back. Harry groaned as he felt his member being extracted from the lovely warmth of her mouth. He looked back down, thinking of memorizing this particular scene in his mind when he noticed something was wrong. He blinked in confusion when, instead of pale skin and black hair, he was met with brown hair and a milk chocolate complexion that had Harry gasping out, "Ange-" before he was reminded of the real world as his hand fled from his cock as if it were pure fire and he blushed a deep red as he panted.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry slowly began to get his breathing under control, and was starting to wish for his erection to recede when he heard the curtains behind him rustle slightly. He turned quickly, narrowing his eyes because his glasses were still in the alcove with his clothes as he wondered who could have opened the curtain which should have magically kept anyone out until he pulled the curtain aside himself. His hazy gaze, made slightly worse by the fog in the room from his heated shower, made out a shape that Harry hoped he was wrong about as his hands moved in front of his obviously enraged cock at having been denied its relief once again.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Angelina?" Harry asked quietly, hoping he was completely wrong because there was no way a girl got into the men's showers. While he still felt that it was unfair that girls could come up to the guy's dorm rooms but guys couldn't go up to a girl's, he was sure that the founders would not allow females into a male restroom.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>His hopes were dashed when Angelina's voice wafted to him, amusement and slight embarrassment evident in her tone, "Why Harry, maybe I'm not needed here afterall." she said as she stepped closer and pulled the curtain closed, "By the way, you should make sure the curtain's closed all the way before you start wanking off. I know alot of people are interested in seeing you but I don't think you want that kind of publicity." she teased.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry blushed a bright red as Angelina's teasing and the attire she was wearing came into clear focus, despite his bad eyesight. She was wearing only a silver pair of knickers that reminded Harry of the bikini bottoms he had seen in his cousin's books. This fact, coupled with how close Harry had been to completing only moments before brought Harry's slightly diminishing libido to a roaring flame as he witnessed his first real, mostly, nude woman. His eyes squinted as he followed her graceful face down to the silky smooth skin of her neck, which Harry had an odd urge to suck upon, down to the sloping of her shoulders. Following her smooth skin led to the first real pair of breasts that he had ever witnessed, and to add to it they were the first that looked like this period, since he had only ever seen white women in Dudley's collection.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Her breasts were even more pronounced without any clothes on, jutting out proudly from her body high on her chest, unlike some of the women he had seen, and her nipples were a slightly lighter color than the surrounding skin. Harry was entranced momentarily as thoughts ran through his head, how soft were they? Were they heavy? Did she like to have them rubbed? Had they gotten bigger in the last few seconds? he asked himself until he noticed she had moved closer to him and his erection throbbed angrily as he saw her boobs bounce with each step she took. He gulped, loudly, as he spoke, "What are you doing here Angelina?" he asked, glad his voice didn't break in his embarrassment, "The better question is How are you in here?" he amended as Angelina smirked even more.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Even as he asked these questions, Harry's eyes continued down Angelina's body, barely being able to keep from just latching his sight onto Angelina's breasts again, he followed the curve of her stomach. The toned muscles that had enticed a reaction earlier today on the train flexed as she moved and Harry noticed that her abdomen was slightly raised from the rest of her stomach, showing her conditioning. He gulped as he saw that those muscles formed a bit of an arrow, pointing to the place of a woman that had always aroused him the most, and the only place that he couldn't see because of her knickers. Harry was slightly relieved at that but he knew that a part of him did want to see that part of Angelina.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Finishing his inspection of his teammate's womanly aspects, Harry noted that Angelina's legs were smooth and that her hips swayed tantalizingly as she walked. Harry had to hold his hands in front of his member to keep his want to touch her smooth and toned body down. He was brought back to Angelina's face by her light giggling as she cupped her breasts to enhance their fullness, "Like anything you see Harry?" she cooed to the awestruck and very horny teenager in front of her.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry felt his cock throb angrily in response to her question and he felt a nervouseness not unlike the one he had before any of his inevitable life altering events in his life. Oddly enough, his embarrassment and curiosity managed to get Harry's hormone adled brain to speak, "How did you get in here Angelina?" he asked.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina frowned, and all of a sudden her countenance changed from flirtatous to shy, "Is that really what you want to talk about right now Harry?" she asked, a hint of nervousness and trepidation filled her normally strong voice. Harry's eyes widened slightly, "I mean, I'm pretty much naked in front of you right now and all you want to know is how I got in here?" Angelina's teeth chewed on her lower lip, giving her shy persona a cute factor that Harry had never seen before. Somehow, this action made Harry backpedal.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Uhhh, well..." he stuttered. Harry had no idea how to handle such a change in personality nor how to comfort her from some insecurities she seemed to be feeling. Harry blinked and Angelina was suddenly right up next to him, the shy, coy look gone and replaced with one that Harry could only define as lust. He shuddered when Angelina palmed the sensitive head of his member.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"I wonder what you were doing before I came in here." she whispered into his ear and Harry shivered as he felt her palm rub lightly over his tip. "I mean, your cock looks so angry," here, her eyes drifted to his engorged member, "It's filled with blood and fit to burst. The way it's throbbing is amazing." she continued whispering into Harry's ear.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To Harry, this was torture. Her soft skin felt amazing, much better than his calloused hand that had been rubbing earlier. The fact that it was a woman was not lost on Harry's body and it acted accordingly, Harry couldn't believe how much better it felt that another was the one touching him. He also felt that familiar feeling building up and he wanted to pull away, like he always did, but Angelina's actions and words caught him off guard. Despite the fact she was talking about his cock, Harry loved the way her voice was deep, husky, while her breath seemed to come in deeper breaths and her eyes were locked upon his erection. He felt himself getting too close and went to pull away.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina smiled to herself as her eyes flickered to Harry's and she felt his member throb under her palm, "What was it that you were about to scream as you came Harry?" she demanded as she pressed harder against his erection and felt him throb again, "Ange- huh?" she giggled, "Was it my name you were going to yell out Harry?" she smiled at the thought but the fact she felt his erection pulse once and her hand was bathed in his sperm caused her to gasp as she saw his eyes widen.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry's erection pulsed again and Angelina felt his second shot coat her fingers, she barely got her hand away for the third shot and she blinked in amazement when she saw his sperm shoot all the way across the shower and splatter against the curtains. Angelina's mouth opened as she watched Harry shoot, three, four, five, six times before it lost its power and three dribbling shots later, Harry collapsed to his knees. Angelina was still in a slight state of shock at the volume Harry had produced so she missed the way his eyes narrowed to pinpricks.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry couldn't deny that finally having finished the act, even if he hadn't done it himself, was relieving in a way. The pleasure he had felt from his ejaculation was undeniable while the feeling was odd. He felt his body lock up, his knees straightened and his hips thrust forward as he felt his cock stiffen harder than anything he had ever felt. The oddest sensation was the fact that his cock literally pulsed in time to the jets of cum he had expelled. It was after he was finished, however, that he felt the oddest sense of guilt. He felt his body relax and he could hardly keep himself from just crumpling to the floor.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The guilt was slightly crushing. He had never been taught that masturbation was wrong, he had just always stopped before he finished because of his feelings. Now, he was wishing he had been able to stop Angelina before finishing him because he felt so guilty, even if he had no idea why he felt bad.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina took a few moments before she realized that Harry had yet to move to stand and she looked down at Harry, worried. When she saw how he was staring at the curtain in slight horror, she blinked in surprise as she washed her hand under the running water before kneeling next to him. "Harry?" she asked quietly as she shook his shoulder. Harry blinked and looked over at her, "Are you okay?"</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry just stared at her for a few moments, each moment making Angelina more nervous and she was now wondering if her coming here had been a bad idea when Harry made to stand and shakily made his way over to a bench that had appeared at his command. The bathrooms could conjure benchs for people who liked to sit while letting the water flow over them. Harry sat down heavily, letting out a large sigh. "No," he said shakily, "I'm not."</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina frowned and moved over to him, sitting next to him. "What's wrong?" she asked, figuring she could forgo what she wanted to do to his still throbbing erection, of which she was surprised, in order to see what was wrong. She was his friend first, of course that was part of the reason she was here.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry shot a look at her from through his bangs and sighed as he pointed to the cum that was still running down the curtain, "I never finished because I was afraid of that." he admitted quietly, Angelina blinked in surprise, "I always stopped before finishing because I was sure I was going to..." he trailed off.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina blinked before her first time flashed before her eyes and she smiled gently, "OH Harry," she said as she pressed her breasts against his arm and she smiled a bit wider as she felt him stiffen and his cock throbbed again, "You're feeling guilty because you wanked off?" she asked.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry shot her another glance, "Okay, That I wanked you off?" she rephrased and Harry took a few moments before hesitantly nodding his head, "So, this is really the first time that you have done this?" she asked. Harry nodded as he sent a glance at the cum that he had shot. Angelina sighed, "So, I'm guessing Hermione never bothered to approach you about this?" she asked. Harry suddenly looked horrified and was about to curl into a ball but Angelina pressed herself against him again to get his attention.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Harry," she said gently, "This is the reason Alicia asked you about second year." she waved towards the curtain once again, Harry gulped, "and why I asked about Hermione and why I'm here now. I think it's time for you to hear what every witch and wizard is supposed to be told." she took a deep breath which had Harry's eyes latching onto her large globs and her smiling, "What is told to every witch and wizard at the end of your second year is that magic usually has us beginning puberty slightly earlier than our muggle counterparts. The earliest we can be kickstarted is about a year but it doesn't always happen." Harry nodded.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Anyways, we are told this during second year because that is usually when guys start, over the summer, and girls are usually getting more exploratory." she said with a grin that had Harry blushing slightly, despite the fact that he was sitting there with Angelina's breasts pressed against him and his erection still throbbing, Harry didn't seem too upset about it. "Masturbation, and sex, are not really looked down upon in the Wizard world. At least, not as much in the muggle world. We still frown for outside of marriage sex but our ways of preventing pregnancy are so much more potent that teenage sex is not actively suppressed, but it isn't approved either. Adults want you to be subtle about it so they don't catch you." Angelina explained. Harry was slightly surprised.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Masturbation, however, is actively encouraged because it helps your magical core." Angelina said to Harry's wide eyes, "You don't need to masturbate every day, nor even every week, but it is suggested you do it at least once a month. If you don't, it can be detrimental to your health, and doing what you have been doing, masturbating but not finishing, can be even more dangerous as it builds up your magic but doesn't release it." Harry suddenly looked worried. "That's the end of the talk with Wizards and Witches stay for the next small part of the talk." Harry was curious, "We're taught just some very basic methods of noticing if a wizard or witch starts to avoid masturbation and we're asked simply to notify Madam Pomfrey, they say that they don't want the guys to know because then they might try to take advantage." Harry nodded, knowing a few guys who would, unfortunately.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"So, this is why I was up here." she finished, "I had noticed last year that you seemed to be blocked up but I figured Granger would have jumped at the chance to help you. She certainly doesn't seem very shy in helping out her dormmates from the way Lavendar and Parvati talk about her." Angelina said to Harry's shock. "Oops." Angelina said with a shy smile, "I guess she didn't want you to know about that. Doesn't matter, she was being cruel to help her dormmates but she claims to be your best friend and never reported it. Even if she didn't want to help herself she knew she could tell me, Alicia, or Katie. As you teammates, we have an obligation to help you if you need it anyways." Harry opened his mouth but Angelina beat him to the punch, "And don't tell us not to help with this, you would help us if we asked, I just didn't ask and decided to help anyways." she smiled crookedly at him, "Besides, I get to see the Boy-Who-Lived cum like a bloody fountain cause of my handjob, you can't imagine the ego boost I just got." she teased.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry blushed again and looked down. He noticed his erection and stood, leaving Angelina on the bench, "Well, thanks Angelina. I'm glad you had this talk with me." he said.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"It's fine Harry, just so you know there is nothing wrong with masturbation. It does feel a bit awkward the first few times so don't worry about it." Angelina offered. Harry nodded.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"So, could you get out so I can finish taking my shower and head to bed?" he asked quietly.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina suddenly looked shy again, looking down at her body she seemed to be asking herself if something was wrong before she looked straight into his eyes, "Harry, you really should learn some tact." she said. Harry blinked, "Do you really want me to just walk away when you obviously are going to wank off? Can you imagine what I think about when you just ask me to leave after you see me like this?" she asked.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry thought for a moment, putting himself in her shoes, "<em>Now, if I approached... let's say Alicia, and she asked me to leave when I'm standing naked in front of her, I would feel... insecure, ugly. OH!</em>" his eyes lit up in recognition and he turned to Angelina. "Sorry Angelina." he said as he stared into her eyes, "I don't think you aren't beautiful and I certainly do appreciate your body and the show you have given me but despite what you just told me, I really think this should be done with someone you, at the very least, fancy." Harry distinctly didn't mention that he fancied her since he really wanted her to stay, he would just feel awkward asking her to help him after learning about this so soon.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina frowned slightly, "So, you think I would do this with just anyone?" she asked, "And what exactly do you appreciate about my body?" she seemed to ask quietly.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry blinked, realizing that he may have just put his foot in his mouth, "No!" he said, "I mean, you said that we were teammates so I figured you were doing it because of that." he admitted, "As for your body, well since I haven't ever seen a real live pair of boobs before I have to say that your's are still the best I've seen, even when compared to pictures." he admitted, "Plus, your smooth stomach just seems so very... enticing." Harry gulped, wondering why the hell he was speaking like this. Sure he had thought those things, but he didn't mean to mention it to her. He guessed he was rambling.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina blinked slightly before she giggled and her cheeks were coated in a darker chocolate color than before, Harry was sure that he had made her blush. "Really Harry?" she asked shyly as she nibbled on her lower lip.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry gulped and nodded his head, both of them bobbing in time to his heartbeat and Angelina giggled, "Well, just so you know, I didn't do this because you're my teammate, just like Alicia and Katie probably wouldn't do this because you're our teammate. I fancy you a bit Harry, I figured you would figure that out by now. I wouldn't do this with anyone I didn't fancy as more than just a teammate." she admitted to Harry's probing gaze. "Now, I think you deserve a bit of a reward for being so honest with me." she said and Harry was backed up to the wall before he even knew what was happening, "You're going to love this." Angelina whispered before she nibbled on his ear.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry shivered again as he felt Angelina's mouth move down the curve of his ear before laying a light kiss underneath his ear. He groaned out as Angelina smiled against his skin. Angelina couldn't deny the feeling of power that she felt as she heard Harry reply to her attentions as if she were a violinist and he the violin. She set about to hear Harry's full range of sounds before she was finished.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina dragged her lips down the side of his neck and pressed again as she met the hollow between his neck and shoulder. This time, she licked his skin before sucking hard as she pulled away. She smiled hungrily at Harry as she saw his skin redden slightly. Satisfied with her mark, and the groan she had pulled from Harry, she moved her head down and crouched slightly, grasping his hardened nipples with her tongue, she flicked it over his sensitive bud and smiled again when she heard his answering moan.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry couldn't hold the moans and groans that filled him as Angelina lavished her attention on his body. He was slightly surprised, and a little bit scared when he felt how pleasureable his nipples were when Angelina licked first his right, then left nipple before moving onto his toned stomach. Harry was proud of the slight six pack he had managed to cultivate and Angelina certainly showed her approval of each as she laid feather light kisses on each of his muscles, causing the heat between his legs to increase as he felt his stomach do flip flops.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina was pleased to hear his groan of disappointment as she kissed, first above his erection and directly on his bladder, before moving to the interior of his right thigh and layering the skin there with her saliva as she licked the inside of his thighs without ever touching his cock or sack. Angelina felt her pussy convulse slightly as she heard him groan and his hands finally fist into her hair as he tried to pull her closer to his cock. She bit him lightly on his thigh to let him know to stop.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina was enjoying her tasting of Harry. His body tasted clean with a hint of manly musk. It was unlike anything she had ever tasted and the few times that she had kissed another guy, they hadn't tasted particularly pleasant. She was horribly expectant of when she would get to taste her prize for helping him.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry yelped slightly as he felt Angelina bite his thigh to keep his hands from pushing her towards his cock. He hadn't even done that consciously, his hands had moved and were gripping her before he even realized what had happened. He did, however, enjoy how smooth her hair was and the way he was gripping her head felt right, so he didn't remove his hands and Angelina seemed to like the fact he was massaging her scalp slightly as she kissed where she bit him before moving to where he wanted her to be.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He still didn't know why he was so eager to allow Angelina to do what she wanted but when he felt her lips touch his erection, all conscious thought flew from his mind as he stared down at his cocolate-skinned teammate proceed to kiss his cock in one of the most erotic and arousing scenes Harry thought he would ever see. He was slightly surprised when the pleasure he felt from her kisses increased as she reached down to his sack and suckled one of his balls into her mouth. His head flew back and he groaned louder than ever before as he felt her release his ball and kiss her way back up to the tip of his member.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"You might want to watch this Harry." she whispered from her spot and Harry's eyes were drawn to her wide open mouth, the way her milky chocolate lips faded to the pink inside her mouth had him fascinated as he watched her draw closer and finally suck his tip into her mouth. He had to fight with himself on whether to throw his head back in pleasure, close his eyes so he didn't blow his load again, or watch as Angelina's pleased face sucked more of his erection into her hot and wet mouth.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>His decision was made for him as she took more of him into her mouth and he groaned again, feeling about half of himself inside her Harry couldn't resist closing his eyes from the pleasure she gave him.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina herself was savoring this blowjob; the taste was just as good as the rest of his body and Angelina really couldn't say she wouldn't want to do this again, even his precum tasted alright. She crossed her eyes to look at the amount of Harry that she had left and was pleasantly surprised to find that she had a good amount of him left, but this was as far as she was comfortable with and brought a hand up to grip the base of his cock. She felt him jump slightly, jerking his hips forward and pushing just a little too far into her mouth. She suppressed the cough that threatened to make her bite him and gave him a warning tug with her hand which only enhanced the glare she was giving him with her eyes. She saw he understood and took her tongue, laying it under his cock, coiling it around him to let him know she wasn't too angry.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry felt bad for thrusting like that after seeing Angelina's glare but he groaned once again as he felt Angelina's tongue do exactly what he had imagined her doing in his daydream. He stiffened slightly as he felt his orgasm coming on but Angelina backed off slightly allowing him to catch himself. Angelina didn't wait long though, she reared back slightly, leaving only his tip in her mouth before lunging forward and swallowing him again. His hand slapped at the wall as he moaned out loudly.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He could do nothing but watch as his brain fried from the overload of pleasure he recieved. Harry was paralyzed with pleasure as his erection was lavished attention by one of the most gorgeous women he had ever met. He could hardly believe he hadn't already blown his load as the pleasure he was feeling was beyond anything he had ever felt before.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina sucked strongly on Harry's cock as she gave him his first blowjob. She was very pleased with the way he was responding to her and she could feel her pussy dripping juices from his erotic moans and groans. She couldn't believe that she was so turned on just from his response to her actions but she had never had such a vocal lover before. The one boyfriend she had done such activities with was under the impression he shouldn't let her know how good he felt from her actions and it was a bit of a turn off when she did something for him but he made no mention of if it was pleasureable other than simply cumming. Harry, obviously, had no such inhibitions as his moans and groans were almost as much of a turn on as dirty talk would be.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina was wanking off part of Harry's cock as she sucked on part of it, she got another idea in mind and brought her other hand away from his thigh and brought it up to his ballsack. She gripped his balls in her hand and mentally smiled as she felt his cock throb in response and his balls tighten. She knew what that meant but she could see Harry trying to stave it off, probably to prolong their activity and Angelina felt a rush of pride at the fact he wanted to last longer for her and to enhance himself. Unfortunately, Angelina also wanted to end this so she didn't wind up going all the way with him. She was so turned on now, it would probably take a few times frigging herself before she could sleep after she left so she went for the kill.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina took her mouth off Harry's cock and enjoyed the groan of disappointment torn from his throat as she looked down at her wanking him off and massaging his sack. She smiled sultrily up at him as she felt his balls contract again, "Cum for me Harry." she whispered seductively, "Blast it down my throat!" she said as she felt his balls contract again and his cock throb. She hurriedly placed her mouth back on the tip of his cock, she could feel the cum traveling through his cock from her hand, which was still wanking him off and sucked strongly as she felt his spunk reach the end of his stick.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry's answering groan to orgasm had Angelina's pussy clenching harshly as she sucked out his first shot of cum, she was barely able to taste it before his second shot joined the first, which caused her cheeks to bulge slightly. Angelina was surprised at his volume, but the memory of his previous orgasm caused her to hastily make a critical decision. Should she swallow or did she want to let him finish outside her mouth as she savored his spunk? His third shot filled her mouth before she made her decision and her throat bulged obscenely as she gulped down his thick semen.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry's orgasm lasted just as long as his first. If Angelina had to guess, she would say that his load was probably just as big as she felt his final shot of sperm coat her already musky smelling mouth. His spunk was inordinately thick, she felt almost as if she were gulping down sludge instead of the watery substance that she had gotten from her previous lover. She hadn't been able to truly enjoy the taste until she felt his cock soften slightly and she tightened her grip on his cock, moving her hand up his erection until it was next to her lips, squeezing the last of his spunk out before pulling her mouth back and looking up at Harry. She swirled his taste around her mouth, mentally evaluating his taste and found that she found it agreeable.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She waited until his eyes opened, enjoying the way his chest heaved from her actions, before opening her mouth and swirling it around, savoring the taste of his incredibly thick sperm. She smiled as she saw his cock throb before she closed her mouth and made a show of gulping his load obscenely. His taste wasn't particularly tasty, it was just so much better by comparison that Angelina truly enjoyed that blowjob so much more than any she had given to date.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It took Harry a little while for words to come back to him and, by this time, Angelina had stood. Harry was a little intimidated by the way Angelina was looking at him now. He had figured that after that blowjob Angelina would be satisfied, but the look she had was anything but satisfied. "Wow." he said breathlessly, unclear on how he should act. Angelina smiled widely, Harry answered her smile with one of his own and he felt a sense of impending doom as he saw her eyes shine, "That was amazing Angelina." he said, trying to make it apparent he had enjoyed what she had done. His appreciation was obviously noted as Angelina smiled wider. "And, ummm..." he hesitated, not knowing if he should say this before saying, "if you ever need help I would be happy to ummm, help." he offered as his smile turned slightly worried.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina's responding look was something Harry hadn't expected, "You mean that Harry?" she asked, her brown eyes bored into his own, "All I need to do is ask right?" she asked. Harry gulped slightly, smelling what must have been himself combined with Angelina's unique scent before answering with a hesitant nod. "Good, then you can take that nice big fat cock of yours and ram it up my cunt." she said harshly as she turned them around, pushing herself back up against the wall and pulling Harry closer to her. Harry didn't see her quickly pull her soaked knickers off her leg.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry was surprised as he heard Angelina's dirty talk, she hadn't been very vocal before but he supposed she had her mouth busy, something which made his erection throb again, but, he wasn't sure he wanted to take it all the way. This was his first time, he wanted to do that with someone he loved. He looked to Angelina, deciding that he would try to get her to let him lick her or do something else when he felt her pussy lips wrap themselves around his cock, he looked down, and he swore he would never forget the sight as Angelina rose up onto the very tip of her toes, even with being almost a head taller than him to put his head in the correct positioning.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry barely had time to cry out as she sunk back down, spearing herself on his thick meat and quickly refilling his flagging erection with blood as he pulsed within his first woman. Harry heard Angelina suck in a deep breath but he could barely keep his mind coherent as he felt the hot, tight, and wet quim that now housed his tackle. He couldn't believe anything would have surpassed Angelina's blowjob but her pussy squeezed his cock in ways that he mouth couldn't. He could feel his muscles flutter around himself as he sheathed himself even further into Angelina.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina was in a haze. She didn't lend much thought to what she was doing as she turned them around and sunk herself onto Harry's erection. She moaned in slight pain from his girth but the pleasure of his size quickly overshadowed that. She had been so very wet from sucking on his cock that Angelina knew she didn't need anymore foreplay. She was so ready to blow even before she placed him inside her she knew it wouldn't take long for herself to come. Just as she knew his first time wouldn't last long either.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry barely managed to pull his mind back from simply concentrating on his cock's pleasure center before Angelina moved against him, dragging her large breasts against his skin and pulling his cock from her clenching warmth with a groan of disappointment. Harry, in an attempt to relieve his displeasure, shuffled forward and thrust his hips forward, burying himself once again in her depths to her loud approval. Harry took a few thrusts, varying the angle and the speed before he felt comfortable with them and set his own pace. Angelina didn't seem to mind as her eyes remained locked on Harry's as Harry tried to please her. He could barely believe he hadn't cum right away but, by the time he had managed to find his rythmn, he wasn't long to blow.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina's right leg raised, wrapping around his hip as he left leg supported her weight. Harry's left hand went to her hips and steadied her instinctively as his eyes caught sight of the bouncing breasts in front of him. He thrust particularly harshly and leaned forward, capturing her brown areola inside his mouth and gave it a suck. Her answering moan, and the clenching of her pussy had Harry almost immediately releasing her nipple so he could grunt out, "Gonna cum, Angelina."</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina barely seemed to hear him, her eyes were starting to roll as he continued his pounding, he could barely feel his tip hit something hard inside her as he thrust particularly harshly. He thrust a few more times before deciding he needed to pull out but Angelina woke up, "Inside Harry." she groaned.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry thrust again, feeling the end near, he had to make sure, "But-" he said but, what he guessed was, her orgasm hit before he could finish his sentence. The tightening of her already tight pussy led to an inevitable chain reaction. Harry's orgasm, barely staved off, began almost as soon as Angelina's. His hips snapped forward, his legs straightening in an age-old instinct of the male to get as deep in the female to ensure impregnation. His first shot was messily deposited in her gushing pussy.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina's hands clawed at Harry's back as she tried to get some sort of hold with which to last her orgasm out but when she felt his thick spunk so deep inside her, her body seemed to lose all form of rigidness and her leg gave out. It was instinct that kept Angelina and Harry from crumpling to the floor. Once Angelina's leg gave out, her pelvis rested completely upon Harry's, pushing his cock as deep inside her as it could go and Harry felt his tip against something bony. He managed to shuffle half a step forward and pressed Angelina against the bathroom wall as her body shook in his arms and her mouth opened in a silent scream of pleasure. He could barely withold his his own body from spasming as he felt her inner core clench tightly against him.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>What Harry didn't know was that the bony tip he was feeling was Angelina's cervix, having dropped down during their sex, Angelina could feel his thick spunk no longer being pumped into her pussy but directly into her womb. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head as she convulsed in pure pleasure and her womb was painted white with Harry's massive load. She felt her womb bloat slightly from his load and her mind couldn't handle the load being pumped into it. Angelina swore she felt his balls contract against her body as she felt each spurt of his spunk blast against the back of her womb. She had never experienced such pure bliss before and her eyes rolled into the back of her head.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Harry himself barely managed to keep himself and Angelina up against the wall while his orgasm subsided. He managed to slide them down and sit on the floor, heaving chests between the two of them as they tried to recover from such an explosive orgasm. Harry popped out of Angelina's quivering sheath and his eyes widened at the flood of white that dribbled from her abused pussy lips.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It was a few moments later, while Harry was still staring in shock, Angelina giggled drunkenly, "I hope you know you aren't going anywhere until you replace all that." she smiled at him though her half lidded stare denoted how tired she seemed, "I don't care if I'm sore in the morning, I'm going to test your stamina until you can't go anymore. I can't believe a virgin managed to get me to cum so hard." she admitted.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>"Is that a challenge?" Harry asked, feeling slightly bold.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Angelina eyed him for a moment before smiling, "If that's what it takes to get you hard again." she said as she laughed, only to be cross eyed as Harry stood, his cock still mostly erect. "Well, that's a good sign." she said.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It was hours later that Angelina and Harry managed to stumble their way to Angelina's bed.</p>
