    <p dir="ltr" align="justify">As I waited for the light to change at the crosswalk, I watched a woman on the other side of the road with idle interest, a smile playing around the edges of my mouth. She was dressed quite unusually for a woman in Los Angeles; she wore a long, faded black tiered skirt, a black vest with no top beneath it, and a charcoal scarf covered with what looked like silver pompoms. However, it was her hair that caught my eye -- she had tumultuous, spiraling midnight black curls that blew around her face in the stiff breeze. The light changed, and we began to cross toward each other when I heard the sound of a speeding engine. I looked away from the striking woman, and down the street where a car came barreling around the corner, clearly without the intention of stopping. The lady who was in the direct path of the Chevy hadn’t looked up. The best my adrenaline-filled brain could come up with was to surge forward. I saw, for the briefest moment, the lady’s shocked expression as I rammed her back out of the way. The shriek of tires reverberated in my ears as the car tried to stop, but something about the crushing weight against my ribcage told me that the driver hadn’t managed it in time.</p>
<p align="justify">I warily cracked open one eye, uncertain as to my location, or why I felt hungover. I shifted slightly, and winced. No, not hungover. In pain, and drugged. So, hospital, then. Hopefully. The room was over-illuminated by fluorescent lights and the air was heavy with the saccharine stench of disinfectants, so unless I was in an impeccably clean interrogation chamber or the psychopath that had kidnapped me had very specific OCD, hospital it was. I opened my eyes more fully, blinking against the abrupt brightness, my head throbbing with a special vengeance. Only able to see the ceiling and -- if I craned my neck -- part of the far wall, I attempted to push myself up into a sitting position. I gasped in shocked pain, and slumped back in defeat.</p>
<p align="justify">“Fuck,” I grumbled, though it came out as more of a croak.</p>
<p align="justify">“Actually, it was a car,” came a new voice, making me start. I turned my face to the right as best I could, and saw a woman sitting in a chair beside my bed. Well, I saw her knees and her torso; I couldn’t quite see her face from this angle.</p>
<p align="justify">“God, I really shouldn’t be blithe. It’s awful, I apologize. Nervous habit,” she confessed, and I could hear both the anxiety and the smile in her voice — her rich, deep British voice. Her hands fidgeted in her lap, her fingers fiddling restlessly with a large, kitschy silver flower ring.</p>
<p align="justify">“You sound tired,” I rasped sympathetically.</p>
<p align="justify">“Been up for a few days,” she replied, sounding strangely apologetic for the fact.</p>
<p align="justify">“Ah. Do you make a habit of sitting vigil at strangers’ bedsides, or am I special?” I asked curiously, wondering what Wonderland-esque world I had awoken to and pleased that my voice was growing marginally stronger. The lady chuckled despite her previous resolve to remain serious, and I silently congratulated myself, because her laugh was incredibly endearing. Warm and almost accidentally sultry, with a hint of a surprise and innocence. Was I really analyzing the laugh of a woman I woke up next to in a hospital? I was comforted when I assured myself that it was the drugs talking, though even in my current condition, I rather suspected that was bullshit.</p>
<p align="justify">“No, darling, it’s just you,” the lady promised me, and if I were surprised by the term of affection, I didn’t show it.</p>
<p align="justify">“To what do I owe such honor?” I queried, smiling at the surrealism of the entire situation. Should I be worried that I’m not terribly alarmed and curious about how I earned a hospital bed? Nah. One thing at a time.</p>
<p align="justify">“I, er-- Well...” she began disjointedly, but I waved a hand at her to wait. Truth be told, it was more of a feeble hand spasm in her general direction, but she seemed unsure enough how to respond that she paused anyway.</p>
<p align="justify">“Would you mind helping me sit up first? I want to be able to see you properly. No offense, you have lovely knees, but...” My shoulder twitched in an approximation of a shrug; I despised the feeling of lying on my back, utterly helpless.</p>
<p align="justify">“I don’t know,” the woman worried, “the doctor said you needed rest...”</p>
<p align="justify">“Please?” I sighed. “I feel ridiculous like this.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Oh, all right,” she conceded. “Just don’t— Just tell me if anything hurts.”</p>
<p align="justify">“I’m sprawled out flat in a hospital bed,” I reminded her. “Everything hurts. But I’d rather be sitting up.” I could practically feel the woman’s concern and indecision radiating off her, but she stood nonetheless. Graceful as ever, I nearly choked on my gasp when she moved into view.</p>
<p align="justify">“You! The-- the hair lady!” My head was too busy being slammed with memories to care much about how inarticulately that was phrased. She had removed her sweater and funny scarf, but I now realized that the skirt was the same eccentric piece that the woman on the street had been wearing, and the hair was absolutely unmistakable. The long, wild corkscrews tumbled down her shoulders in a casual disarray, and I found her as fascinating to behold now as I had when I had first set eyes on her. Her lips twitched up at the peculiar name I had bestowed upon her, but her forehead was creased with immeasurable guilt.</p>
<p align="justify">“I-- Yes. From the road. You knocked me out of the way of that damn car. Saved my life,” she said quietly.</p>
<p align="justify">“Don’t feel bad, it wasn’t your fault,” I told her emphatically. Something about the combination of pain and her guilty expression made my stomach twist uncomfortably. “I could hardly let a woman who wore that out in Los Angeles and had such spectacular hair be erased from the human population. It’d be a tragic loss,” I grinned up at her, and felt that my efforts were worth it when she smiled back.</p>
<p align="justify">“What’s wrong with what I’m wearing?” she protested playfully, frowning.</p>
<p align="justify">“Oh, nothing, nothing. Were those pompoms on your scarf, or just silver lumps? It was a bit difficult to see, I was busy being run over at the time.” Her initially bright expression fell; she bit her lip, and her eyes tightened with self-reproach.</p>
<p align="justify">“Sorry,” I sighed, and I meant it. “Was that too soon?” She snorted in an enjoyably un-ladylike manner.</p>
<p align="justify">“Not even out of hospital yet? Yeah, a bit, I’d say,” she returned, rolling her eyes and relaxing slightly, though that anxious, haunted look hadn’t fully disappeared from her face.</p>
<p align="justify">“I’m sorry,” I repeated. “No guilt, okay?” I demanded, furrowing my brow and looking up at her scoldingly. “It was my choice to hurl myself in front of that idiot in order to save your lovely face.” She laughed again, gazing down at me with a peculiar expression.</p>
<p align="justify">“You’re kind of remarkable, you know that?” she said seriously.</p>
<p align="justify">“Um,” I started, “okay? Any particular reason?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Yeah,” she answered, shaking her head thoughtfully, “quite a few.” She didn’t elaborate, and I decided not to press her.</p>
<p align="justify">“So, what’s your name, then? Or am I destined to forever refer to you as ‘Hair Lady’ inside my head?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Oh! I’m so sorry, darling. I’m Bellatrix Black,” she smiled, reaching out to shake my hand, though she settled for patting my arm lightly when she remembered my hand was partially bandaged.<br/> “Bellatrix. It suits you,” I mused. “I’m Hermione.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Thank you,” Bellatrix blushed.</p>
<p align="justify">“Now, Bellatrix, please help me sit up.” She frowned disapprovingly, but obliged, and began stacking pillows up behind my head. Then she gently eased me into a sitting position, doing her best not to jostle me. I sucked in a sharp breath through my nose, and pressed my uninjured hand to my ribs, the source of the worst of the pain.</p>
<p align="justify">“Are you okay, darling?” Bellatrix asked, biting her lip, her face lined with heartwarming concern. “Well I mean no, of course you’re not, but...” I suppressed a smile at her rambling, because really, that would not be appropriate at the moment; she looked genuinely anxious, and my ribs did hurt quite a lot.</p>
<p align="justify">“I’ll be fine,” I managed, shifting slightly in a vain attempt to ease the ache that had settled in my diaphragm. “Do you have any idea what the damage is? Did the doctor talk to you?” Bellatrix stood somewhat awkwardly next to the bed, forcing me to look up at her when I spoke. She glanced at the chair, and was about the move it closer when I patted the bed beside me. When she looked skeptical, I repeated the action, adding,</p>
<p align="justify">“That chair looks dreadfully uncomfortable, all plastic and cold metal. Come, sit. I don’t bite, I promise.” She tucked a rebellious ringlet behind her ear as she perched on the bed next to me before replying.</p>
<p align="justify">“Not even if I ask nicely?” Bellatrix’s tone was casual and light, but the moment after she finished speaking, her eyes widened and she covered her mouth with her hand. I raised my eyebrows, one corner of my mouth curling into a crooked, impressed smile, and let out a low whistle.</p>
<p align="justify">“Getting more and more glad I saved you, Ms. Black.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Oh, my God,” she muttered, removing the hand over her mouth and pressing it instead to her flushed cheek. “I’m sorry, it’s...habit, I suppose. I really need to learn to filter.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Not on my account,” I protested, still grinning. “I find it charming,” I assured her resolutely.</p>
<p align="justify">“Anyway,” she pressed on, “yes, to answer you question, the doctor did talk to me. I may have…implied we were slightly more…familially connected than we are. But you didn’t have anyone else here, and I figured someone really ought to know. I hope that wasn’t…too far out of line?” Her verdant eyes were covered by a film of guilt again, and she was chewing her lower lip with worry.</p>
<p align="justify">“I’m glad you were here,” I admitted. “I don’t really many people to call, so I’m glad at least someone was here to know what was going on. Thank you.”</p>
<p align="justify">Bellatrix ducked her head, several tightly wound curls tumbling forward to partially conceal her face.</p>
<p align="justify">“You’re most welcome. It’s really the very least I could do, after all,” she smiled, finally glancing back up at me. “Shall I go on, then?” I nodded, and she continued.</p>
<p align="justify">“The doctor said you were actually incredibly fortunate. You’ve sprained your right wrist, broken two ribs, and dislocated your right shoulder. You also have some pretty extensive bruising along your chest, back, and shoulders, as well as some shallow cuts, and a few deeper ones as well. You rolled over the windshield of the car that hit you, which accounts for the kind of injuries you have -- you would’ve been much, much worse off if you had gone under the car. You could have died,” she said softly. “Does that-- does that answer your question?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Yes, thanks. It’s all I need to know for the moment, anyway,” I replied, not overly eager to dwell on the details; I found that it made my injuries throb, as if to remind me of each point of impact. Bumper. Hood. Windshield. Pavement.</p>
<p align="justify">“I pushed you to the ground,” I recalled slowly. “Fairly hard, actually. I didn’t hurt you, did I?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Oh, no, not much. I scraped my hand a bit when I fell, and a very minor wrist sprain. Nothing to worry over. If you hadn’t...I would’ve ended up...Well, rather like you, if not much worse.”</p>
<p align="justify">For the first time, I noticed the neutral colored bandaged that peaked out from beneath the sleeve of Bellatrix’s blue and grey striped shirt and wrapped around her wrist and the base of her hand. I lifted my own bandaged hand (my doHermionent, unfortunately) and rested it next to where hers lay on the bed, brushing my fingertips gently over her knuckles.</p>
<p align="justify">“We match,” I remarked softly, a wry smile tugging at my lips.</p>
<p align="justify">“We do,” Bellatrix agreed, linking her pinky through mine as if we were children flushed with the youth of summer and swearing solemn vows, instead of adults sitting side by side in a hospital bed, connected by our brokenness, the decision to save and the decision to stay, and one terribly irresponsible driver.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">“I really must advise you to stay. I’d like to keep you here for a few days to keep an eye on you, but at least stay overnight.” I was shaking my head even while the doctor was talking.</p>
<p align="justify">“I’m sorry, I can’t, I need to go home,” I told him firmly, shoving the sheet off my legs, and felt my heartbeat beginning to pound in my fingertips.</p>
<p align="justify">“Please, I just need to leave.”</p>
<p align="justify">“All right, Ms. Granger. If you’re willing to sign a form that says you are aware you’re leaving against medical advice, then you may leave. You’re going to need someone to drive you home, though,” the doctor warned, sighing as he peered down at me with disapproval.</p>
<p align="justify">“Yes, all right, sure. Anything you say, doc. Just get me the form, I’ll sign it,” I promised. The doctor sighed again, and I rankled slightly at his sad displeasure, but brushed it off in favor of focusing on controlling my breathing. When I opened my eyes, the doctor had left and returned and was handing me a clipboard of papers. I took it and set it on my lap while he unhooked my IV; I didn’t meet his eyes, and waited until he left again before starting on my pile of paperwork.</p>
<p align="justify">“They tell me you’re signing yourself out AMA,” Bellatrix accused, walking abruptly into my room and sounding cross. “Is this true?” I looked up at her, forcing a smile.</p>
<p align="justify">“Yep, I’m busting out,” I replied, working for jokingly cavalier, annoyed with myself when my voice wobbled.</p>
<p align="justify">“Are you all right, darling?” Bellatrix asked, her crossing toward me, her tone immediately becoming softer. Her brow furrowed in concern, and she sat down on the bed beside me, closer than before. I blinked, and felt my lashes grow heavy with tears. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p align="justify">“Nothing, I just hate hospitals,” I told her, and cleared my throat in an attempt to rid my voice of its hoarse quality. She seemed to consider that for a moment, before nodding.</p>
<p align="justify">“Okay,” she agreed. “I can understand that.” She sounded tired in a way she hadn’t earlier, and I wondered what had happened to cause her glittering dark eyes to be so full of empathy for someone whose hospital-related trauma was so transparent.</p>
<p align="justify">“Would you mind picking up my stuff from the front desk for me? I need my phone to call someone and ask for a ride home,” I said after a minute of quiet, this time managing a genuine, if small, smile.</p>
<p align="justify">“Of course, but...” she trailed off uncertainly.</p>
<p align="justify">“Yeah?”</p>
<p align="justify">“I could drive you home,” she offered quietly. “I mean, if you like. It’s late, and I’m here. I don’t mind. I’m not a fan of hospitals either, but you’re still leaving AMA, and I’d feel a lot better if I know you made it home safely.”</p>
<p align="justify">“All right, Ms. Black. Thank you, I’d really appreciate that.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Lovely!” she exclaimed, sounding relieved. “Okay, then, I’ll go collect your things, let you finish up this business here, and then we can get you home.”</p>
<p align="justify">It ended up being another forty minutes before the various hospital staff would let us leave, but eventually Bellatrix was very carefully helping me into the passenger seat of her car. I breathed shallowly as she leaned in across me to buckle my seatbelt, the faint scent of antiseptic and honeysuckle clinging to her clothes and the freckled skin off which I could feel warmth radiating.</p>
<p align="justify">“I spoke to the doctor while the nurse was helping you get dressed,” Bellatrix started as she pulled out of the hospital’s underground garage.</p>
<p align="justify">“Oh?” I prompted, shifting cautiously in hopes of easing the sharp ache around my ribcage.</p>
<p align="justify">“Mmm,” she acknowledged, her eyes on the road while she navigated an intersection. When we slowed to a stop at a red light, though, her eyes flickered over to meet mine. “He said you’re at risk for a concussion — you’re not allowed to sleep.” I nodded; I knew this. “He, ah, strongly recommended that you have someone stay the night and make sure you don’t accidentally hurt yourself or slip into a coma. If you have someone you can call for, then all right. I told him I’d stay with you — he really did keep going on and on. I’m happy to do it, though, darling.”</p>
<p align="justify">“I’d argue on principal, but you have been incredibly kind to me. Besides, I needed help putting on my seat-belt, so...if you’re willing to stay for awhile, I’d be grateful.”</p>
