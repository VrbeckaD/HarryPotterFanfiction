    <p>Harry shifted to get comfortable in the chair. They were in the living room of The Burrow, having just gotten back from Hogwarts. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were on the loveseat talking to everyone about school. Ron was on a chair on the other side of the rug, answering their questions and regaling them with their school adventures. Ginny walked into the room and hopped onto Harry’s lap. It seemed weird to Harry that she would do that in front of her parents, but he, in truth, hadn’t spend a whole lot of time there, so maybe he just didn’t know. Her parents seemed to have no problems with it.</p><p>Just as Harry had needed to shift himself when he sat down, letting his robes fall open and not bunch under him, Ginny seemed to need to do the same thing. She stood just a smidge up, off Harry, to adjust her school skirt, rubbing her amazingly cute backside over Harry’s trousers. Harry’s predictable reaction was immediate, and he had zero time to adjust himself before Ginny sat back down, her skirt now falling cleanly over her legs and his.</p><p>The Weasley parents turned and asked something of Ginny, (what, Harry wasn’t sure, he was otherwise distracted), and she answered cheerfully, seeming entirely unconcerned with the predicament she had put Harry in. Harry, on the other hand, could think of nothing but his erection pressing tightly into Ginny’s bum, which was both more muscular, and at the same time softer than Harry had ever imagined.</p><p>She continued talking with her parents, becoming incredibly emotive about whatever it was she was talking about, (Harry still had no idea,) and as she laughed and waved her hands, Harry’s crisis became worse, because she was now wiggling and jiggling, pressing and moving Harry’s erection in the most amazing manner, and yet, Harry could do nothing about it except try to hide what was happening. He tried to adjust himself under her, to get himself into a more comfortable, innocuous place, and out of trouble. But, Ginny was not making it easy, shifting her own balance on his lap every time he moved, pushing herself back into him.</p><p>As Ginny continued her slow, inadvertent torturing of him, Harry felt the front of his trousers shift and he realized with horror that he had obviously forgotten to zip them up after he went to the loo last. He panicked, but with the weight of a whole other person in his lap, was unable to do anything to fix the problem – not without everyone seeing. And then, like out of his worst, teenage nightmare, the fabrics of his clothes shuffled exactly in the wrong direction and his full erection popped through. He was now poking Ginny in the arse, and only her skirt hid what was going on.</p><p>He could only fear that she knew exactly what somehow happened, and prayed that she didn’t and wasn’t aware what was prodding her. Very nonchalantly, she placed her hands on the seat, right next to his legs, and pushed herself up his lap a bit, as if she had been sliding down slowly during the conversation. As she did so, the tip of his frighteningly erect cock made its way directly between her buttocks and was now nudging directly at her pert little rear hole.</p><p>“No, no, no, no, no,” went through his head, simultaneously along with “Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.”</p><p>There was no way Ginny didn’t know. She was a bright, attentive, beautiful girl, and she absolutely had to know what was going on. And yet, she simply kept talking with her parents, settling herself carefully back onto Harry without a care in the the world.</p><p>His erection was like steel, the pleasure of just being near her in such a dangerous, intimate way, starting at his base and separating the sensations of his erection from the rest of his body – like it was not him, but his, and his entire head was focused on what it could feel.</p><p>And what it could feel was Ginny. It was all Ginny. The muscle of her rear opening was not wet, but soft, and tight, like velvet. As she sat back, she slowly spread over his head, engulfing him. There was friction, and heat. It was home, and pleasure. And she was still sitting.</p><p>The image was in his head of his dick, penetrating and entering her slowly, spreading her open. And it was all he could do to not cry out. Yet, no one else seemed at all to care what was going on. The Weasley parents continued their conversations with their children, and Ron and Ginny kept answering them. He closed his eyes, trying to concentrate on not betraying what he was feeling, while also focusing entirely on the pleasure that was Ginny.</p><p>She continued to envelop him. He could feel his pleasure build, behind the base of his cock and deep in his groin. No more than a mere moment could have passed, but he knew there was no way he was going to last. He was going to go off before he made it the whole way into Ginny the way it was going.</p><p><i>He was</i> in <i>Ginny!</i></p><p>The pressure was pleasure and it was growing, like an explosion waiting to happen. He knew, deep in his head, that he was going to go off like a firehose. Here. In Ginny. In her house. With family watching. And he couldn’t care.</p><p>It was overtaking him faster than she was. He wanted to hold out as long as he could, savoring what it was to be in Ginny like this.</p><p>He wanted to go off, to empty himself into her, to know that he was finally with her and she was his. He was coming whether he wanted to or not.</p><p>His eyes shot open.</p><p>His heart hammered in his chest, almost painfully, as if it were slamming into his sternum with every beat.</p><p>
  <i>Noooooo!!!!</i>
</p><p>His clothes were soaked in sweat. He was still only processing the damp sheets around him, the secrecy of the hangings, while his consciousness was still only focusing on Ginny <i>not</i> being there with him – of him <i>not</i> being in Ginny.</p><p>He still had an erection, and it was painfully hard, no longer ready to go off at a hairs’ touch.</p><p><i>Ginny!</i> he though frantically to himself, shutting his eyes desperately trying to get the Burrow back. To get Ginny back. To finish with Ginny.</p><p>But the shuffling going on around the move told him it wasn’t going to happen. He lay there, frustrated, angry, embarrassed. How would he face Ron? How would he face <i>Ginny</i>?!</p><p>But, it was time to start the day.</p>
