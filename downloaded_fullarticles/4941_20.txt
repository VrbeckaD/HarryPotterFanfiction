    <p>Severus was not happy to be called into the Headmaster’s office. It had been a rather long and trying day dealing with inept brats. It had taken a huge restraint of control not to hex the blithering dunderheads as once again a simple potion had gone awry. Hours had been spent taking care of the aftermath, which was far too dangerous to be left to students that fully deserved detention. Only through quick thinking and action had he managed to get his students out before the classroom was caked with the remains of the cauldron explosion.</p><p>Oh, he was thoroughly aggravated by the whole situation, which was why he currently was storming his way up to the Headmaster’s office. Robes billowing as he took long strides past students who received the nastiest snares.</p><p>If he had it his way he would have expelled more than half of the student body at the beginning of their first year. Unfortunately despite his insistence Albus Dumbledore refused to expel any student over these many years. Above all it was the Gryffindors who seemed to make it a goal of destroying his classroom. He had half a mind to confront Minerva about disciplining the members of her house.</p><p>Making his way towards the statue guarding the Headmaster’s office he mumbled the password revealing the winding staircase. He took the stairs two at a time wanting as little of his precious time to be wasted. Out of courtesy he knocked before Albus called him to enter. Pushing through the door he was brought to a sight he had seen many times before: Harry bloody Potter sitting in the chair across of Albus and Minerva standing beside her Gryffindor golden boy. Undoubtedly this meant that another Potter incident had occurred.</p><p>Moving more into the room he could feel that something was off, which he quickly recognized came from Potter’s magical energy. Potter had grown into a fine young man and with it his magical core had strengthened to the point it was almost tangible. There was a significant difference in magical quality, it seemed weaker. Minerva moved aside enough for him to catch a glimpse at Potter. A quick assessment told him that Potter was looking weaker, his skin was flushed and eyes sunken as if the boy hadn’t slept in years.<br/> "Why is Mr. Potter not in the infirmary where he obviously should be?" He asked the Headmaster.<br/> "He refuses to go." Minerva said eyeing Potter, who was physically trying to shrink into the chair.<br/> "One would think he enjoyed his time in the infirmary considering how often he was admitted. It was my understanding that Madam Pomfrey was going to engrave his name into one of the beds." He drawled sarcastically.<br/> A small chuckled erupted from the boy wonder, who was doing his best to contain it. Something inside him calmed as he watched Potter's shoulders bounce up and down from the laughter threatening to slip through his fingers. Despite Potter being a brat on occasion Severus didn't like the despondent look on his face, of course, he would never say such a thing out loud.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry was doing his best to stifle his laughter. If he didn't know any better he would've thought Snape had intentionally made a joke to make him feel better. Such an impossible thought made it hard not to double over in laughter. Snape wasn't the type to make jokes he was the brooding stern type or so that's what he had always believed.</p><p>Regardless of it being intentional, this laughter was so soothing and well needed when faced with worried looks.</p><p>When Hermione and Ron had noticed he wasn't feeling well they had insisted that he go to the infirmary, which he had promised to do later. He truly believed it was nothing more than a cold that would soon pass without the need of Madam Pomfrey. The only reason he was in this current predicament was because he had fainted for a quick moment on the staircase leading up to Dumbledore's office while accompanied by Professor McGonagall.<br/> "I suggest we call someone from St.Mungo's to check Mr. Potter's head. There surely must be something wrong to incite such unnecessary reaction." He heard Snape say.<br/> He couldn't hold his laughter back. The way Snape spoke told him the man was amused by his reaction. Usually all remarks made by the potion professor was laced with snark and each word intended to cut a person down. It was one of the many reasons why the student body referred to the man as the snarky git dungeon bat. In this moment there was no harsh tone to these words, no malice behind their meaning. Harry never thought the day would come that he would be laughing at something Snape had said.</p><p> </p><p><br/> Severus couldn't fathom why he was attempting to cheer up Potter. It wasn't as if they were friends although they had grown more cordial to one another over the years. Perhaps the exhaustion of the day had taken its toll on him. Potter looked much better with a smile on his face he mused. The other occupants of the room must've thought so too as Minerva's face had relaxed and Albus was giving him a small smile.<br/> "I...I'm sorry sir...Perhaps you are right." Potter spoke between laughs.<br/> He watched as the old warped frames of Potter's glasses were lifted so the boy could wipe away tears. And then those large emerald orbs were looking at him, those eyes that just barely resembled Lily's. He took this moment to shift his attention back to Albus, who seemed way too keen about the exchange.<br/> "Potter requires medical treatment."<br/> "Poppy will be here momentarily." Albus said just as the floo burst with green flames and the medi-witch stepped through.<br/> Pomfrey went straight to Potter's side.  She looked confused at the sight of Potter in tears and quickly glanced around the room for an explanation.<br/> "I am fine."<br/> "You are most certainly not Mr. Potter. Now tell me what has brought you to me this time."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"I don't know."<br/> "I suggest that you be upfront with her Mr. Potter." Snape warned in his famous teacher voice.<br/> That tone could make nearly anyone comply.He was compelled to do the same the problem was that he honestly didn't know what was the cause of his fatigue. He wasn't feeling that horrid, he had gone through worse fits of illness growing up. He recalled a time he had gotten pneumonia and the Dursleys had refused to take him to the doctors until he became so weak that his uncle had to drag him out of the cupboard under the stairs. Days of high fevers and persistent chest pains went untreated was nothing compared to this. All he felt was tired. Even if he told them that there was no way he would be believed.<br/> "I really don't know."<br/> A huff came from Madam Pomfrey before she went about casting spells to reveal what was wrong with him. This part was by far the most comfortable of his many visits with the woman. What would come next was something he never looked forward to.  Harry silently thanked Merlin that he hadn't broken or lost any bones. Sometimes he could still taste the nasty drink he had been forced to chug down after the incident in second year. With all the visits he had acquired over the years he was surprised that his taste buds hadn't died from the foul treatments. Mentally he went over his list of potions he had taken ranking them from most foul to tolerable. If he was lucky he would receive something leaning more towards the tolerable side.<br/> "You’re sure you have no idea what has caused this?"<br/> Harry thought back to all he had done the day before but nothing stuck out in his mind. Pomfrey looked worried out of her mind and Harry knew she was being professional by not acting hysterical.<br/> "No." He said hanging his head low.<br/> "Is it serious?" McGonagall asked worriedly glancing at her student.<br/> "Of course it is." Snape snapped.</p><p> </p><p><br/> If there was one thing that truly set Severus Snape off it was dimwitted questions. He couldn't hold back the remark at Minerva's question. He knew the head of the house of Gryffindor was a powerful witch who no doubt sense the weakening of Potter's magical core so he couldn't let the idiotic question go. Any imbecile knew that anything that affected one's magical core could result in death. It did no one any good to hide that fact.<br/> "It is?" Potter asked, eyes wide in fear.<br/> A glare from Pomfrey shot towards his way. He felt as if he could kick himself for his bluntness. Often he forgot that Harry Potter, the savior of the Wizarding World, still knew very little about their world. Years of being raised by muggles had robbed him of knowledge that was so common sense in their world that they weren't even taught about in Hogwarts. He knew from first-hand experience what it was like to be left in the dark about certain etiquette and common knowledge when he was a student at school. Severus refused to let his mind wander into the past, nothing came from reflecting on those times.<br/> "Professor Snape is correct." Madame Pomfrey said in a soft tone.  "Something is affecting your magical core. If not treated...."<br/> "You'll die."  He said when it became painfully obvious that Pomfrey couldn't bring herself to say the words.<br/> "Come with me Mr. Potter. I need to run more tests to determine the cause of this."<br/> The look of dread that came over Potter's face was one that he knew very well. As a student he had gone through rigorous medical treatments at the hand of Pomfrey. Since those days he had vowed never to receive treatment from her unless absolutely necessary. Even if he returned from a Dark Lord meeting feeling as if he were going to die he still refused to go to the infirmary.  He didn't envy Potter at this moment. A small smirk came with the thought of all the horrible concoctions Potter would have to endure. Afterall Potter would get through this scare unscathed.<br/> "Perhaps you would like to join us Professor Snape." Pomfrey said in a tone that told him it wasn't a request.<br/> With a curt nod he followed as Pomfrey ushered Potter into the floo. In a moment they were gone and he stepped into the now empty fire place.<br/> "Keep an eye on the boy." Albus said.<br/> He wanted to snap back at that comment claiming how he had always looked after Potter since his first year. Severus knew well enough not to rise to the bait and called out for his location. Green fire enveloped him and he was stepping into the fireplace in Madam Pomfrey's office. Pomfrey was already setting Potter into one of the many beds as he stepped into the empty infirmary. A curtain was drawn over them as the medi-witch began more invasive testing he assumed. There was nothing for him to do at the moment as he wasn't a medi-wizard so he took a nearby chair. Glancing around the infirmary he contemplated how this place seemed to not have changed since he was a student. Years had gone by and yet everything looked exactly the same from the uniformed bedding to the aged paintings on the wall. He could practically see a younger version of himself lying in the bed across of him covered in bruises and scrapes from the many fights he had gotten in with James Potter’s gang.  <br/> This place made his stomach lurch even more than the location of the Dark Lord's meetings. Without a doubt once he was free to leave this place he would be spending the night nursing a glass of fire whiskey. After a day like today he deserved a glass or two regardless of it being a school night.  The movement of curtain alerted him of Pomfrey's approach.  Her face held a quizzical look mixed with sadness. Whatever she was about to say was not going to be good.<br/> <br/> Harry laid back on the bed hoping that the tests were over. He hadn't a moment to ask questions as Madam Pomfrey had gone from one test to another, each making her face drop slightly. Desperately he wanted to ignore those looks or the comment Snape had made about him possibly dying.  He had gone through the wallowing in self-pity stage a few years back and had come to terms of possibly dying, but he had believed that it would be at the hands of Voldemort.  For now he didn't want to think about that.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"What is it Pomfrey?"<br/> "My office please."<br/> Glancing at Potter's bed one last time he followed her into the office. As he put up a silencing charm around them he noticed that her eyes didn't leave the direction of Potter.  <br/> "I'm afraid that all the pressure has gotten to him." She said above a whisper.<br/> "Explain."<br/> "I did multiple tests and... It appears he has consumed a large amount of various potions."<br/> "What are you insinuating?"<br/> From her look he could gather what she was attempting to say.  He would scoff at the thought if it weren't such a serious manner. Mixing multiple potions together could be rather deadly. Personally he knew of one person who had died in that manner. There was no way what he was being told was true.<br/> "You think Potter tried to kill himself?"He spoke softly as if Potter were able to hear them through the charms.<br/> "I don't want to believe it either Severus....I...I don't know what other reason such a mixture would be in his system."<br/> "The Headmaster should be notified."<br/> "This is a very delicate situation...I am able to help flush out some of the remnants, but it has been in his system since last night if my scans are correct."<br/> In all the years he knew Pomfrey her diagnosis was never wrong and that unsettled him right now. Depending on the mixture of potions Potter had taken consecutively the effects on his magical core could possibly be irreversible. Severus knew he couldn't simply confront Potter and interrogate him about this. If the boy wonder had attempted to take his own life such an approach wouldn't do the boy any good. A situation like this was not something he could deal with effectively.<br/> "Please Could you keep an eye on him while I gather some of my things."<br/> "Very well." He said before removing the charm and exiting the office.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sleep was calling to him and yet he was unable to let his eyes shut. He had felt this way since last night and didn't know why. Not even a Dreamless Sleep potion had helped him fall into a deep slumber last night. Harry wondered if the lack of sleep had affected his magical core to the extent that it warranted the worry of his professors and Madam Pomfrey. To him that didn't make sense considering all the years at the Dursleys that he had received little sleep and even less food. There had to be more to it than just lack of sleep then again he didn't know much about magical cores or what weakened them.<br/> Turning his head to the side he watched as a silhouette moved across the curtains around his bed. Slowly the silhouette tugged at the edge of the curtain and Snape smoothly stepped through. Something in those dark eyes made him want to cry. The Usual stern look was nowhere to be found on the potion Professor’s face. No hate, no anger, not even annoyance was in those eyes. Those dark eyes were devoid of emotion as they peered into his very soul. For a split second he thought the man was using legilimency on him, yet there was no noticeable push into his mind.<br/> “Sir?”<br/> Their eye contact broke as Snape took the seat beside him. Things must have been very serious for the man who hated him to be sitting so close by. Silence hung between them was very uncomfortable. Fidgeting under the gaze of his professor he tried to voice the million questions floating around in his mind.<br/> “Mr. Potter.”<br/> He had heard this man say his name so many times over the years, but not like this. His name had come out so quiet that if it weren’t for the silence of the infirmary he would’ve missed it. Tears were threatening to make its way out of his eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Severus Snape didn’t do emotions nor emotional displays. Above all crying wasn't something he could handle. Perhaps it was his upbringing or the struggles he faced in life made him thoroughly unqualified to properly care for someone on the verge of tears. Lacking the ability to console another forced him to push on the emotional well-being onto other Professors such as Minerva. Minerva was the right person to handle this not him. She would be more than comfortable to embrace the boy and tell him that things were alright. With a reputation like his students weren’t flocking his office door with their emotional distress.<br/> He needed Pomfrey to return. If Potter started to sob he wouldn’t know what to do. Those emerald eyes were looking for him to give something that he simply couldn’t give. And there was the matter of broaching the subject of Potter’s possible suicide attempt. It was unthinkable for the golden boy to commit such an act, then again he had gone through much pressure since entering their world. Surely anyone would crack under the pressure of being given ‘the honor’ to destroy the Dark Lord. As someone who fought for both sides he knew that the fight was not simply a one on one affair, yet the way Albus put so much emphasis on the prophecy making it sound as if it were all up to this child. No Harry Potter wasn’t much of a child anymore, he had already endured more than anyone his age. In truth, this young man before him had endured way too much and had lost even more. The war was still upon them and those too ignorant to realize that were blessed fools who may not make it. Neither he nor Potter had such luxury to live in such ignorance. If he were more of an emotional man perhaps he would tell Potter that he knew of the suffering he had faced.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Alright Mr. Potter I need you to cooperate with me on this.” Madam Pomfrey said wheeling in some strange contraption.<br/> Harry groaned at the sight of the thing. Whatever this thing was he was sure it was going to be uncomfortable.<br/> “At least I don’t have to drink anything awful.” He muttered to himself.<br/> “The night is still young.” Snape said with the tiniest smirk.<br/> Now he was sure that he was in seriously bad shape; this had been the third time Snape had made a snide comment that was surely meant to be a joke. And somehow he knew that smirk was not intended to be cruel. He could laugh again for when wasn’t the dungeon bat cruel or snarky? Maybe them missing dinner for yet another Potter incident as Snape called them was affecting them. Hunger was a possibility considering he personally hadn’t eaten anything all day and he didn’t remember seeing the man at the head table at either eating time.<br/> “I shall leave you in capable hands.” Snape said getting up from the chair.<br/> “Actually...”<br/> “What is it?”<br/> He didn’t know why the word had come out. In any other visitation to Madam Pomfrey he would’ve outright denied the man to be anywhere near him. Today was different he wanted the man to stay. Snape was the only one who didn’t look at him with pity. The man was curt bordering on cruel in his words and held the demeanor of indifference, which was somehow comforting to have in times like this. How could he tell the man that though?<br/> “Nothing...Sorry.”<br/> A nod was all he got from Snape before the man disappeared behind the curtain. As Madam Pomfrey brought the device closer he felt like the non-existent contents of his stomach was going to rise up.<br/> “Let us begin.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Severus took the moment to return to the Headmaster’s office to report on what was taking place. Someone had to relieve him of this duty he couldn’t go back to see the young Gryffindor in this current state. He knew that in a matter of minutes Madam Pomfrey would expel the remaining of the potions Potter had consumed, which would tell them exactly what he had digested. As someone well versed in potions he would have ‘the privilege’ to inform the medi-witch of the damage done. Potions were a delicate thing if one ounce was off during brewing the result could range from explosions to the potion having ill effects. Mixing potions proposed a whole new set of issues. Some potions used for medical purposes could be used in tandem with others without a problem while certain combinations could poison you. The thought of the numerous combinations that could be very deadly came to him with far too much ease. Queasy feeling churned inside from the thoughts and memories.<br/> “Ah Severus my boy welcome back!” Albus chimed.<br/> At times like this he truly hated the Headmaster’s uplifting tone. There were just things in life that weren’t solved with lemon drops and tea.<br/> “I have come to inform you that Pomfrey has discovered the reason behind Mr. Potter’s horrid state.”<br/> “Thank Merlin.” Minerva sighed.<br/> “Mr. Potter is in the capable hands of Pomfrey at the moment, however there is a problem which I simply cannot assist in.”<br/> “You’re worrying me Severus.”<br/> “What I have to say will worry you even more.”<br/> “Please explain my boy.”Albus said.<br/> “It appears that there was a highly dangerous amount of mixed potions in his system. Currently Madam Pomfrey is flushing out his system to negate any more damage, but nothing is guaranteed.Depending On the mixture he took there might not be a means of prevention for the inevitable.”<br/> “How did this happen?”<br/> “Madame Pomfrey believes that it was self-inflicted.”<br/> “That simply cannot be!” Minerva said shooting up from her seat. “He...He would never...I am going to see him!”<br/> He was more than grateful at Minerva determinedly stepping through the Floo. Having her in the infirmary to console her Gryffindor would be for the best. Although he knew Pomfrey would request his assistance he felt desperate to go back to his quarters. He was about to make the long trudge towards the dungeons when Albus placed a hand on his shoulder. Twinkling eyes practically bore into his own for a split second.<br/> “Come my boy.” Albus motioned to the floo.<br/> “With all due respect Headmaster, I don’t think my presence will be helpful in this manner.”<br/> “Nonsense. From what I’ve seen you are what the boy needs right now.”<br/> “You need to get your eyes checked. What Potter needs is someone like Minerva not someone with the reputation of the school’s snarky dungeon bat.”<br/> “You are far too hard on yourself.”Albus said motioning to the floo.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The verdict was in, this latest treatment was by far one of the worst things he had gone through at the hands of Madam Pomfrey. Given an option, he would choose to drink a disgusting potion over the device. His stomach felt as though it had been gutted out as he laid back onto the bed. A silhouette danced across the curtain bringing up hope that Snape had returned. Such hopes were dashed when Professor McGonagall stepped through.<br/> “How is he doing?” She asked the medi-witch.<br/> “He’ll be recovering from the treatment. In the meantime, we have to wait.”<br/> He wished that people wouldn’t talk about him when he was right there. Shimmying up the bed was painful, it felt like knives were digging into him at the slightest move.<br/> “Where... Where is Professor Snape?” He asked in a hoarse voice.<br/> “Don’t worry about that.” McGonagall said moving to take his hand. “If you don’t want him here he doesn’t have to be.”<br/> Shaking his head he looked into his head of house's eyes. Professor McGonagall was far too worried to realize that he had no problem with Snape's presence.<br/> “Mr. Potter...”<br/> That tone was in her voice again. How he hated that tone, the tone that people used when someone was thought to be as fragile as glass. Fragile wasn’t a word he would use to describe himself. After all that he had gone through in his short life he was far from being fragile. This was just another Potter incident and like all the others he would get out of it in one piece.<br/> “You do know that you could always come to me to talk about anything don’t you Mr.Potter?”<br/> He nodded unsure of where this was going.<br/> “Is there anything you wanted to tell me?”<br/> He wracked his brain of what it was that Professor McGonagall wanted him to say. So far he hadn’t caused too much trouble this year. Sure there was the occasional prank here and there, but nothing that warranted him disclosing to his head of house. “No.”<br/> McGonagall's lips formed a thin line at his response.<br/> “Mr. Potter I am not here to judge you.” She spoke softly. “Sometimes life can be overbearing...When things get to be that way it’s okay to turn to someone. There are many people who care for you. Your friends and even professors want to see you live a full life. So many would be at a lost without you.”<br/> Harry didn’t know what to say. His heart began to sink at the words. It sounded as if Professor McGonagall had already given up on him. Worry was one thing complete lack of hope was another.<br/> “You should rest. We can talk tomorrow.”<br/> He nodded, too worried that his voice would reveal how hurt he felt. With one last small smile McGonagall left. Now that he was alone he curled up on the bed. Despite the motion being painful he hugged his knees to his chest, this position often was the only comfort he had against the bad things in his life. Being in the infirmary he couldn’t put up a silencing charm without alerting the medi-witch. He had to settle for smothering his cries with his pillow.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>After much insistence and an internal debate, Severus had returned to Madam Pomfrey's office. He still refused to be there while Minerva took care of Potter’s emotional needs. All he had to do was wait for the results from Pomfrey and he could retreat to his own room. Albus wouldn’t have approved of him sitting back, but he figured he had done enough of what that old coot asked of him. Wasn’t it enough that he was in the vicinity of Potter? Already he had sat by the boy, which he knew was uncomfortable for both parties.<br/> The chimes in the office alerted him that someone had left the infirmary, in all likelihood it was Minerva who left. Madam Pomfrey came in holding a scroll. He took the parchment without a word and made his way out of the office. The look on the medi-witch’s face said that she wanted to talk , but he was all talked out. Sleep. He needed sleep and a drink. Tomorrow would come and he would be in a better mindset to address the issue. Quietly and quickly he moved passed Potter’s bed. Muffled crying made him turn back. Glancing at the drawn curtain he wondered if he should do something. What could he do?<br/> “Minerva was supposed to help the boy.” He thought as he turned on his heels back to Potter’s bed.<br/> In a not so gentle manner, he peeled back the curtain. Potter physically jumped at his entrance. The current position of the school’s golden boy was something he never thought he would see. Potter was curled up on himself, hugging a pillow that was soaked with tears. Contrary to rumors about him he didn’t enjoy seeing any student in this state.<br/> “Potter, what has brought on this blubbering?”<br/> His words weren’t kind nor the ones Potter needed. Severus was well aware that he could do more harm than good, but how was he suppose to leave knowing that Potter was sniveling? He couldn’t be cruel enough to walk away, which is why he resumed the seat he had previously occupied.<br/> “Sorry Sir.”<br/> “Just answer the question Mr. Potter.” He said pinching the bridge of his nose.<br/> He couldn’t tell why he was torturing himself like this. How was anything he done had helped Potter or himself today? Couldn’t he just let the boy cry in peace? Wasn’t he dying to get back to the comfort of his own room and drink away the stress of the day? What would sitting here by Potter’s bedside accomplish? There wasn’t anything he could offer, not kind words, not advice, not even a spell to comfort him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You want to know why I am crying?" He asked, lifting his head from the damp pillow.<br/> "I simply am inquiring why Professor McGonagall was clearly unable to address your emotional needs."<br/> "I don't understand."<br/> "Why is that?" Snape asked with an arched brow.<br/> "I...It's..."<br/> Words were failing him. A part of him wanted to forget about this day push Snape out of the room then curl up into a small ball. Why couldn't the man leave him to cry? Muffling his sobs had done nothing to prevent him from being put on the spot. Nothing was more embarrassing than being caught sniveling by the sternest professor in school.<br/> "You must think me weak." He mumbled under his breath.<br/> If Snape heard his mumbles the man didn't react, then again the man rarely did react to things. Harry wished that he was a little more like the potion professor, having the ability to control one's reactions was surely something that he could use more of.<br/> "If you do not wish to talk I'll take my leave."<br/> "No!" He said quickly sitting up.<br/> Snape's eyebrow remained arched as he met the older man's gaze. He didn't want to Snape to leave with the thought that he was crying for no reason. Summoning some of that trademark Gryffindor bravery he prepared to tell Snape what was going on in his mind.<br/> "Sir...I don't know how to feel about all this...If it's not one thing it's another. After everything I...I just thought." He knew he wasn't making much sense. Taking a breath he tried again. "What's upsetting me is that when Professor McGonagall was talking with me earlier it felt like she had given up on me."<br/> "I'm sure she had no intention of coming off that way. She is fond of you so much so that she barely does her job disciplining your rule breaking tendencies."<br/> Harry was shocked at Snape's response. He had expected some comment about him being a baby and that he should grow up and realize that life was tough. For some odd reason, this man had been doing a lot of surprising things in these last few hours.<br/> "I know she cares about me. The way she spoke though saying that a lot of people would miss me if I was gone made me feel like she was sure I would be dead by tomorrow."<br/> " I assure you that won't happen."<br/> " I thought you would be happier without me around." He nervously laughed.<br/> "Listen Potter." Snape said in a stern tone as he leaned forward in his chair. "I may think you a brat and a pest at times. And the way you get away with every little thing vexes me to no end, but I would never rejoice at the news of your death. No One should feel that things have gotten to the point that there was no reason to go on living."<br/> Taking in those words brought up a mix of emotions within him. He wanted to cry and smile. Something about what Snape said also bothered him so much that he couldn't let it go unspoken. Pairing what was said by McGonagall and Snape made it all fit together. Even the looks he got from Madam Pomfrey fit this realization. He had to ask to be sure. Regardless of how hard it would be to ask this question he needed to know.<br/> "Do you... They think I tried to kill myself?"</p><p> </p><p><br/> That question had hit him harder than he thought possible. Harry Potter was a Gryffindor in every sense of the word and as such was a thorn in his side for several years.  Potter wouldn’t attempt suicide, then again Severus knew suicide wasn’t something that affected only one type of person. Hearing Potter ask that question with sorrow and shock filling those emerald orbs showed him that there was still some sliver of innocence left within the Gryffindor.  Silently breathed a sigh of relief that the damage to Potter's magical core hadn't been an intentional act against his life. If Potter admitted to an attempt on his life he couldn't sit back. There were things in this life that he didn't want to repeat.<br/> "Madame Pomfrey's tests showed that there was a high quantity of various potions within your system. When certain potions are mixed within a wizard's system the mixture  can become deadly as it can damage one's magical core."<br/> "You can die from mixed potions?"<br/> "Yes." He said quickly, not wanting haunting memories to come up to the surface.<br/> "I would never do that. I couldn't do that."<br/> "I know." The words slipped out before he could calculate their effects. "It has been a long day. You should rest."<br/> Now that he knew Potter hadn't done this to himself he needed answers. He had yet to look at the parchment from Pomfrey but prayed to Merlin that he would be able to combat the mixture's effects. As he left Potter's side he swore he heard the boy whisper him a good night.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The night hadn't been as rough as he expected. Without a Dreamless Sleep potion it usually took him hours before he could doze off, which usually led him to drift off in the early mornings. Being in the infirmary always aggravated his insomnia, however this time was different. When Snape left he expected to stare up at the ceiling until he had gotten bored. A calm sleep was the furthest thing he had expected, yet here he was waking up to a brand new day. The exhaustion he felt yesterday was gone. He wanted to jump out of bed run up to the Headmaster's office and claim that his Potter luck had once again saved him. Nearly he did fly out of bed, however when he moved a sharp pain shot through him.<br/> "I should've known it was too good to be true."<br/> Clutching his blanket he rode out the wave of pain. As it slowly faded Pomfrey came in with a large tray filled with food. Seeing the medi-witch he did his best not to let the fading pain show on his face.<br/> "You should eat something Mr. Potter. I would like to check on your vitals afterward."<br/> Growling his stomach agreed with the medi-witch's proposal. This time when he moved no pain shot through him and he greedily bit into a muffin. Food tasted so good after yesterday's aversion. Nausea remained at bay while he consumed the majority of what was on the tray. It was perhaps the most food he had ever ate in one sitting. Chugging the pumpkin juice the patter of someone walking into the infirmary echoed off the stone floor. Right away he knew it wasn't Snape, one of the man's abilities was being able to walk briskly without his steps being audible. His ears perked up when he realized it wasn't one set of footsteps but two.<br/> "Hi mate how are you feeling?" Ron asked as he stepped through the curtain.<br/> "We were so worried about you." Hermione added.<br/> "I'm feeling a lot better now."<br/> "It sure looks that way." Hermione said eyeing the remnants of his breakfast tray."It's good to see you eating again."<br/> "Yeah mate. So did you get the all clear?"<br/> Harry didn't know how much he should say. He knew that telling them something was possibly wrong with his magical core would upset his friends. Hermione would run off to do as much research as possible, which would give him a headache more than anything at this point. Snape had given him just enough knowledge last night for him to know that this wasn't a normal occurrence, then again when did anything that happen to him was normal? Why couldn't he just be a typical sixteen-year-old?<br/> "Not yet. You know how Madam Pomfrey is she'll keep me forever if she could."<br/> "I would actually prefer going more than a few weeks without having you in here." Madam Pomfrey said.<br/> "We should get going to class." Hermione said giving an apologetic look to the medi-witch.<br/> "I'll bring you something to entertain you if you're not released before lunch." Ron said following after his girlfriend.<br/> Ron took Hermione's hand as they walked out. Harry was happy that they were finally together. Years of them fighting not to acknowledge something so blatantly obvious was frustrating. Once they became a couple he had a sliver of worry that he would be a third wheel. He had no reason to worry according to Hermione they would always be a trio. For the most part they were,they still hung out and got into trouble like old times. Ron and Hermione were very respectful always making sure that pda was limited to hand holding or a kiss on the cheek. More than anything he was overjoyed that his two best friends in the world were happy together in a time that happiness was increasingly difficult to grasp.<br/> "Let's see how you're holding up Mr. Potter."</p><p> </p><p><br/> Utterly exhausted Severus entered his classroom. Teaching was low on the list of priorities at the moment, still he had to do his job. Snapping at a late student and taking points from Gryffindor had no effect on his mood. He was going through the motions while his mind was working out the latest Potter incident. The list of potions Potter had in his system were so numerous he didn't see how the boy survived. In addition to the sheer quantity, the mixture was one of the most deadly combinations possible. Even though Potter hadn't done this to himself intentionally, the results left little room for other possibilities. One possibility would be that Potter was forced to drink several potions one right after the other and then had memories erased, yet that held little to no water. For one there was the issue of how would anyone get that much potions without him realizing it. The next issue was that his stocks were untouched, he had spent hours last night checking and rechecking to see if anything was stolen. Afterwards, he had instructed Pomfrey to check her own supplies, which too was untouched. Even with magic it would be impossible for someone to restore the amount of potions that would've been stolen without either of them noticing. He didn't trust a student enough to copy the instructions of his lessons let alone let them touch valuable ingredients, so he also had ruled out a breaking in of the classroom. Painstakingly he had counted each of the ingredients that he had kept in the secured cupboards in the classroom. Everywhere he turned there were no answers of how the mixture had gotten into Potter's system.There had to be something they were missing, something so minute that could be easily overlooked. The one thing he had managed to have progressed in was a possible antidote for Potter's weakened magic core, which proposed its own set of issues.<br/> "In light of yesterday's disaster, I want a twelve-foot scroll on proper brewing safety and etiquette. Open to page 26." He instructed his class.<br/> Groans erupted from several students to which he shot glares at. Sleep hadn't come to him last night due to his racing mind and he was in desperate need of a rest. Luckily teaching was something he had learned to do effectively when he had little energy left. As he began lecturing he consulted a tattered note book which he had written notes many years ago. This notebook was something he rather to never open again. Many times out of frustration he had attempted to destroy it, but by some grace he always stopped himself. This notebook held information that could save Potter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Madam Pomfrey hadn't given him the all clear before lunch. No pleas of wanting to go to class was getting him out of this place. She kept an eye on him so he couldn't make a break for it. Even going to the bathroom was monitored with the medi-witch standing outside the door. Still Harry felt this was a waste of time and energy for the medi-witch. He was feeling good for the most part. The sharp pains came and went infrequently, but if he leaned a certain way he could go without feeling like his air supplies was temporarily cut off. If he could just figure out how to counter the symptoms he could go on with his everyday life again. Madam Pomfrey had previously taken away his wand so he didn't know how he would feel if he did any magic, even so he was determined to show her that he was capable of leaving this place in one piece.<br/> Ron was true to his word. As soon as it was time for lunch he had come by with Hermione with a chess set in tow.<br/> "How you holding up mate?"<br/> "I've been bored out of my mind all day."<br/> "We'll remedy that." Hermione said lifting up her purse. " I hope you don't mind that I went into your trunk a little."<br/> "Not at all."<br/> From her bag she pulled out some muggle comic books that she had gifted him a few years back for his birthday, it was the first comics he'd ever owned. Hermione had gifted him thick books as well, but he had yet to read them. Hopefully he would have to stay here long enough to break open one of the books.<br/> "I also bought some essentials." Ron said as he pulled out two handfuls of candy from his robes.<br/> "Thanks a lot you guys. Care for a round of chess Ron?"<br/> "Prepare to be sorely beaten!"<br/> As Ron set the board in the middle of his bed Hermione dealt with Dobby, who had popped up with his lunch. Seeing that his friends had come for a visit Dobby insisted on getting them food as well. By the time the house-elf had returned Ron was already making his first move. He picked at his lunch as he calculated his moves. Since the first time he had played chess with Ron he had made it a goal of his to one day beat the redhead. Today wasn't going to be the day, he could tell after a few moves in. Ron wasn't the kind of person to go easy on his opponents, even if they were sick, but that was something he was grateful for. In everything he had faced he appreciated that he never truly went through things alone. Having these two by his side made his crazy life feel more normal.<br/> "I love you guys."<br/> "Don't think buttering me up will save you from losing." Ron said as he took another pawn.<br/> "I know. I just wanted to tell you both that you mean a lot to me."<br/> "Harry?" Hermione asked, lifting her face from the book she was reading. "Is there something wrong?"<br/> Lying to Hermione was risky business. As the smartest person in school he knew it would only take her a moment to work things out. Perhaps she had already figured it out and was waiting to hear it from him. He couldn't say it.<br/> "Yeah Ron won't let me win."<br/> "Hey if you want to win you have to do it on your own." Ron teased as he made his last move. "Checkmate!"<br/> They all burst into laughter. His laughter was cut short by the sharp pain in his chest that had been bothering him all day. Doing his best to hide his pain he smiled at Ron's still laughing face. Hermione gave him a concerned look, which he chose to ignore.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By lunch time Severus was ready to call it a day, unfortunately he still had classes to teach. He decided to forego lunch in the Great hall to spend his time in his office. Opening the notebook he had contemplated for the last several hours he pulled out the texts that was in his references. Some of these texts he hadn't looked at in years. There was good reason why they sat untouched for so long, however now there was a greater reason to open them. Whatever ghosts of his past that he had to face again was going to be worth it, that he was going to make sure of. Pinching the bridge of his nose to relieve himself of an oncoming headache he threw himself into the text. Before these were abandoned on his shelves he had read them over a hundred times. As he turned the page Deja Vu hit him hard. Unpleasantly he could recall specific passages that had stumped him in the past. The years away had given him a fresher look at the theories he had developed long ago.<br/> The roar of his office fireplace made him look up from his work. There was no worry about anyone stepping out of the fireplace since he had ordered<br/> Albus to keep the floo connection closed. Hoping to make the firecall end as soon as possible he brought his text with him.<br/> "What do I owe the pleasure?" He asked the fire image of Albus.<br/> "I Didn't see you at lunch."<br/> "That isn't exactly unusual. As you can see I'm quite busy and have a class to attend to in a few minutes."<br/> "Of course. Please come by my office after your last class."<br/> "Anything else?"<br/> "Don't forget to take care of yourself. You look exhausted."<br/> "I assure you I am fine. I will see you later this evening." He said before cutting the conversation short.<br/> With a nod Albus's flame image disbursed. Sighing he closed the text, grabbed the notebook and headed to his classroom. This particular class was one that he was not looking forward to. Teaching potions with the Gryffindors and Slytherins were always a challenge in keeping his composure. The rival houses fed off each other in a way that the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws didn't, making the classroom a tense place at times. As head of Slytherin he knew the members of his house worked hard to succeed in his classroom, but that didn't inspire Gryffindors to do the same. Gryffindors tended to play around resulting in horrible messes that he often had to clean himself. Of Course he wasn't oblivious to the occasions when one of his Slytherins would play a prank on unsuspecting Gryffindors. Severus wasn't a perfect man he had often looked the other way at the harmless pranks due to his favoritism. However when he noticed something potentially dangerous he quickly put an end to it and sent the culprits to detention. The one thing that put Slytherins in a better position than any other house was their fear of disappointing him.<br/> House Rivalry interfering with learning was not what he was worried about this time. The two Gryffindors that composed the famous Potter trio was going to be there. On occasion there had been classes where the trio was a duo, however this time was different. Potter's condition was severe if not addressed so the duo would not be in the best mindset.<br/> Stepping into the classroom he glanced at the duo expecting them to seem distressed. To his surprise they acted as if it was a typical day. Their lack of sorrow told him that Potter hadn't disclosed what was going on. As much as he appreciated not having students erupt into tears at the news of Potter's possible fate, he questioned why the boy wonder wouldn't let his closest friends know about his state of health. Potter was more of a mystery than he gave the young man credit for. Last Night they had more than a decent conversation. Such events had helped him see the Gryffindor in a light he hadn't before. Since Potter's first year he had compared him to his no good father. The-Boy-Who-Lived was a title young Potter had been slapped with, but back then Severus thought the boy would walk around with the arrogance of being the savior of the Wizarding World. It took a long time for him to separate his presumptions from whom Potter truly was. It was still something he had to be mindful of.<br/> "Potter has been occupying too much of my thoughts. I should be teaching." He mentally scolded himself. "Open your texts to page 26."<br/> Almost on cue Mrs. Granger's hand shot up.<br/> "Professor Snape this is double potions shouldn't we be starting on..."<br/> "Mrs. Granger." He interrupted. "I am well aware of what class this is. We will resume the lesson from last meeting after we go over proper brewing safety and etiquette. Just because this class is advanced does not mean we can forget safety procedures." He took a moment to glare at the whole classroom as he continued his speech. "When we start brewing I don't want any mishaps. The second years had already seen to destroying my class this week so I will not tolerate any horseplay. Understood?" With audible gulps and head nods he proceeded. "Now open to page 26."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed for the umpteenth time. Madam Pomfrey had confiscated a majority of the candy Ron had given him shortly after his friends had left claiming that he should be watching his sugar consumption. It was hard to stop himself from telling the med-witch to give him a break since he could die at any moment. He knew that she wouldn't have appreciated those words and if she was one of those who thought he had tried to kill himself a comment like that wouldn't help his case. The comics Hermione brought were ones that he read so many times that he practically memorized them. Perhaps it was Hermione's plan to bring these in hopes that he would get bored enough to read the book she had brought him.<br/> "Nice try Hermione." He said turning the page of the comic in his hands.<br/> Knowing what was going to happen on the next page made it difficult to stay engaged with the story. His mind wandered to his friends in doubles potions without him. For once he was envious of them to go to potions class. Today's assignment was one he had felt so confident in that he could brew it without Hermione double checking all of his steps. Now he was confined to this bed while his friends got to brew a potion they had spent a week learning all about its history and uses.<br/> "I would rather be in his class now."<br/> A train of thought took him to the conversation he had with Snape last night. It couldn't have been a dream since he didn't have enough imagination to come up with something like that. And he didn't want last night to be a dream, well at least the parts concerned with Snape. The potions professor had been kind to him. Kindness wasn't something the man showed often, especially to the-boy-who-he-hated-the-most. After last night he didn't know how to feel about the man after all Snape had said that he wouldn't be happy if he died. Something about that made his heart beat a little faster. If he remembered correctly Snape had promised him that he would live to see today too. All of it was surreal. If he could talk about the events of last night without having to talk about his damaged magical core he would divulge it all to his best friends. They would say he was out of his mind for thinking Snape would cheer him up or listen to his troubles.<br/> "I'll keep it to myself." He smiled at the secret.<br/> "And what is it we are keeping to ourselves Mr. Potter?" Madam Pomfrey asked as she came in for another vital check.<br/> "I was just thinking out loud about my comics." He lied.<br/> "That is some strange literature you have there."<br/> "It's a muggle thing."<br/> "I see." She said as she cast the same spells he had come to expect. "How are you feeling Mr. Potter?"<br/> "Not bad."<br/> "Be honest with me."<br/> "Sometimes I get a sharp pain in my chest and I feel like I can't breathe, but it's not so bad once you get used to it."<br/> "I prefer if you didn't have to get used to such pain. Unfortunately I can't administer anything to help ease the pain...."<br/> There was that sad look again. There was no reason for her to walk on eggshells around him.<br/> "Madam Pomfrey."<br/> "Yes Mr. Potter?"<br/> "I...I just wanted to let you know that I didn't do this to myself on purpose. I didn't try to kill myself."<br/> "Thank Merlin." She said as tears fell from her eyes.<br/> Seeing the usual collected woman tear up made his own tears start to flow. When the woman leaned forward he hugged her tight. Truly he hadn't realized how the thought of him possibly being suicidal had weighed on her. He could only imagine how hard Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore was dealing with that false thought. Even Snape must've been concerned. If it weren't for the man's words he would still have thought that those he had come to trust had lost hope in him.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Keeping a sharp eye on each student during the brewing had paid off. Not one cauldron exploded nor one student injure themselves. By the end of class two groups had produced a nearly perfect potion while the rest were of a decent enough quality. Dismissing his class he watched as each student file out. He half expected the duo to approach him, but if Potter hadn't divulged his current situation than there was no reason for the duo to willingly talk to him outside of class. Making sure that all students were gone he secured the finish potions. He had to be even more careful now that he knew someone had intentionally poisoned Potter. Even if the potions weren't stolen from him he wouldn't make it a possibility. In the back of his mind Severus knew that he was prolonging the inevitable as he straightened up his office. More than ever he didn't want to meet with the Headmaster nor did he want to see Potter. Hiding in his room and drink away bad memories was not an option. Slipping his tattered note book into the inner pocket of his robes he left for the Headmaster office.<br/> Walking to the Headmaster's office was always more preferable than flooing. Unless it was an emergency he rarely used the floo connections of Hogwarts, perhaps his aversion to them were because of past memories of fumbling out of them when he was younger and getting used to the magical transportation. Shaking his head of past thoughts once again he arrived at the statue. With the password given and stairs ascended he readied himself to be face to face with the old coot.<br/> "Have a seat my boy." Albus chimed. "Lemon drop? Tea?"<br/> "No thank you." He said as he took his usual seat.<br/> Severus couldn't understand how many more times he would have to refuse the wretched candy for Albus to understand that he would never accept the offer. And the tea was out of the question. Albus was notorious for spiking the tea with Calming Draught or something else if the headmaster was feeling mischievous. He supposed that Albus could get away with such things solely because of his status. Albus was far from senile despite how often he acted that way. The Headmaster always appeared to be scheming and Severus often tried not to get tangled in those schemes.<br/> "Perhaps something more solid would be better. When was the last time you ate?"<br/> It wasn't unusual for him to go without eating for a few days. Research always took priority over basic necessities like food. Albus question made him realize that he hadn't eaten anything since lunch yesterday. This wasn't a healthy habit of his, yet his mind had gone into overdrive at the mystery of Potter's damaged magical core leaving no time for food or sleep. With a pop sound a house elf appeared with a spread of finger sandwiches. To appease the Headmaster he took one off the plate and ate it.<br/> "Surely you didn't call me just to watch me eat."<br/> "I did not."<br/> "Has Potter's condition deteriorated?" He asked nonchalantly.<br/> "Pomfrey is doing her best to keep him stable.I have yet to see him, but Ms. Granger has informed me that he is looking better than yesterday."<br/> Severus knew that an improvement in outer appearances didn't guarantee a clean bill of health. Memories were threatening to breach again. Unconsciously he placed his hand on the old notebook in his pocket.<br/> "Is that all?"<br/> "Pomfrey has also informed me that Harry told her that this wasn't a self-inflicted act. But you already knew that."<br/> Often he wondered if the position of Headmaster gave Albus the ability to know everything that went on in Hogwarts. The all knowing nature of the man was something he had tried to figure out time and time again with little success. The old coot knew far too much even for a Legilimens. Regardless he wasn't going to admit to the late night chat he had with Potter.<br/> "Potter wouldn’t take his own life." He said getting up from his chair. " I think we have wasted enough time here. I need to discuss the results with Pomfrey."</p><p> </p><p><br/> Harry was starting to read the book Hermione had given him during the lunch break. So far it wasn't as boring as he thought it was going to be. After Madam Pomfrey had gone over his vitals yet again she had left him to attend to something else. Admitting to his situation not being self-inflicted had granted him a little more freedom from the medi-witch's attention. No more had he dealt with her standing outside the door of the bathroom, but she still poked her head to check on him every thirty minutes or so. The pains he felt every so often weren't as much of a shock after the initial time. Every once in awhile he could feel his magic flicker like a flame, which reminded him that this wasn't the simple cold he once thought. He refused to let dark thoughts creep in after all Snape said that he would help him.<br/> "Snape is always helping me isn't he." He thought.<br/> As if his thoughts summoned the man Snape appeared beside the foot of his bed. He jumped at the sudden presence, his heart nearly stopping from the fright. Clutching the shirt on his chest he willed his heart to settle down. One day he had to ask Snape how he could walk without making a sound. Besides Snape stood Dumbledore with a small smile that he was unsure if it was forced or not.<br/> "You sure know how to scare someone half to death sir."<br/> "How are you feeling?" Dumbledore asked.<br/> "Aside from my heart stopping just now I'm doing alright."<br/> "Poppycock!" Madam Pomfrey said joining his two visitors. "This boy always undermines the severity of his condition when he's with me. It's like pulling teeth for him to admit that he's in pain."<br/> Her words came from love and concern for his well-being, yet he felt somewhat ashamed. It was true that he was always a difficult patient. Rarely did he just lie back and did as he was told by the medi-witch.Possibly his defiance stemmed from his time with the Dursleys. Back on Privet Drive none of the injuries he got from Uncle Vernon’s beatings received official medical attention. Not even the time he had sworn his shoulder had popped out of his socket from the harsh yank on his arm after not finishing his chores to his Aunt's standards. Injuries he received were looked at as nothing more than a scratch that warranted nothing more than a band-aid if even that. According to Aunt Petunia hospital wasn't for freaks like him. Only through magic did he believe his body had survived the years of abuse without permanent damage. Having Madam Pomfrey care for his injuries fluttering about the infirmary running test after test was something he had yet to get used to, not that he wanted to get used to it. Regardless of how many times he found himself in this place without fail, he would get out as soon as possible.<br/> "I must discuss the results with you." Snape said to Madam Pomfrey.<br/> "I think we would all like to hear about these results." Professor McGonagall said as she set foot into the infirmary.<br/> It was tough to meet the eyes of his head of house with the knowledge that practically a day ago she had thought he had done something unthinkable to himself. The party that stood before him all thought that. Professor McGonagall offered a tired smile. The puffiness under her eyes told him that she had been crying recently. He took a moment to look at everyone's face, seeing the worry etched into each of their faces except Snape's. Snape held the same nonexpressive face that he always had. Since the day he had met Snape the man hadn't changed his face much. There was one time that he saw Snape's lips curl up into a small smile and clap somewhat vigorously at the Slytherin's victory in Quidditch. That was the one and only time he had seen Snape so animated, of course at the time he was frustrated so he didn't get to enjoy such a rare image. Right now the only thing that differentiated Snape's look was subtle changes, like the bags under his eyes that looked darker than yesterday. Only now did he notice that exhaustion colored the potion master's features. Insomnia was something he was well versed in. Harry supposed that Snape's position of potion professor, death eater, spy, and whatever else the man did, didn't offer the recommended nine hours of sleep. He truly envied those who could sleep the full nine hours or even more.<br/> "I’d rather discuss with Madam Pomfrey on how to proceed alone." Snape said.<br/> "I actually want to know." He spoke up.<br/> "Very well I will explain all that I can if you can answer this question. How did such a high quantity of mixed potions get into your system?"<br/> "I don't know." He said looking down at his hands.<br/> "Think hard Mr. Potter did you drink anything unusual recently? The results showed that the mixture was in your system since the previous night, ruling out that you were poisoned slowly over time."<br/> "I don't think I drank anything weird."<br/> "As hard as it might be you need to use your brain. Think of everything you consumed no matter how small."<br/> Searching through his memories he was drawing a blank. Digging deeper into his mind he thought of the one thing he had previously overlooked.<br/> "Dreamless Sleep Potion!"<br/> "There were faint traces of that in the mixture." Snape mumbled to himself. "Continue."<br/> "As you know sometimes I have nightmares of old Voldie so I use it when the dreams become too much. The night before was dreadful and the day hadn't been any better because of the nightmares. I thought I had run out of Dreamless Sleep and would've requested more later, but I found a vial of it in my robes. I don't remember putting one in my robes. I didn't really think about it at the time, though looking back on it the taste was slightly off. When the potion didn't work I thought maybe it expired or something. I figured that I caught a cold because of my insomnia so I didn't see Madam Pomfrey until I fainted on my way to the Headmaster's office, and you know the rest."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Severus pondered Potter's story. Last night he had wracked his mind with possibilities of how the golden boy had consumed enough of the poisonous mixture to create this much damage. He speculated someone slipping the mixture over time in Potter's pumpkin juice but that didn't match up with the test results. The results showed that the mixture was present at one specific moment as if the boy had sat consuming one potion after the other in a short time period. If Potter's recollection was correct it would fit the time period the mixture was administered. Severus knew very well of Potter's need of the dreamless sleep and he had previously planned to make more for Albus to give to the Gryffindor. There was no way that the potion Potter took would have come from his stock.<br/> "Do you still possess the vial you used?"<br/> "I think it's still in my bedside table drawer."<br/> "I would like to test its remaining contents."<br/> "You think the expired potion did this?" Potter asked knitting his forehead in confusion.<br/> "Potter potions don't simply expire."<br/> "Minerva would you be a dear and retrieve the vial from Mr. Potter's room?"Albus asked.<br/> "I will request the assistance of Mr. Weasley."<br/> Curiously he noticed Potter slightly relax as Minerva left. Those emerald eyes were looking at him again. He had noticed the once over earlier. This time he subtly returned the favor, taking in Potter's appearance, he did look better than yesterday. No longer was the boy's face swollen from crying as it had been last night and the color had improved drastically. Indeed Potter looked to be healthy, despite the physical appearance, however Severus could still feel the weakening magical energy.<br/> "Do you have any ideas Severus?" Albus asked.<br/> "The potion that Potter thought was Dreamless Sleep most likely was a highly concentrated mixture. I believe that someone might've slipped that poisonous mixture into your robes while you were unaware."<br/> "You think that a fellow student would intentionally do this?" Pomfrey asked.<br/> "It is very possible. We are at times of war. And before you start a witch hunt against the Slytherins there are students of other houses that don't hold allegiance to the light."<br/> Secretly Severus was very protective of his students. The Slytherin house was one that held the sole reputation of being composed of dark wizards. Anyone sorted into the house was deemed evil or soon to be corrupted. Over the years he did his best to deter his students from joining The Dark Lord because that was expected of them. It was difficult to sway students whose parents held allegiance with The Dark Lord without raising suspicion. Being a spy for both sides of the war didn't offer him the freedom to warn his students about The Dark Lord's false promises. He needed to guide his students away from being seduced by the power and riches that was believed to come along with joining the Death Eaters. In reality becoming a Death Eater didn't provide either of those things. He knew firsthand how manipulative The Dark Lord was and regardless of what was promised or how well you served him The Dark Lord would never uphold his end of the bargain. Being the head of house he worked tirelessly to prevent as many students as possible from joining the ranks. Unfortunately, he wasn't always successful. His stomach churned each time he saw one of his students take on the Dark Mark. Slytherins were not the only ones who were at risk of falling prey to false promises of glory and strength. A significantly smaller amount of students from the other Hogwarts houses had joined the ranks of Death Eaters. Those students were mostly outcasts of their specific houses. As an outsider, he understood the appeal of the dark lies. It only slightly shocked him the first time he saw students from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw at the Death Eater meetings. Most of the attention at Hogwarts was focused on the house rivalries of Slytherin and Gryffindor. For those who weren't associated with Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy they merely existed in the background. When he noticed an influx of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students he had tried to meet with the heads of the houses. Because of Slytherin reputation other head of houses didn't actively prevent students from leaving the light side as he did. His concerns went unheard. Most adults first and foremost saw him as a Death Eater, a supporter of The Dark Lord, and not a Professor.<br/> "Do you have any idea who would do this to you?" Pomfrey asked Potter.<br/> "No." Potter said shaking his head. "A lot of people want me dead. If this had happened a few years ago I would've thought it was Draco's doing. I know now that he never wanted me dead."<br/> One of Severus's greatest accomplishments was stopping Draco from taking the Dark Mark. Draco was perhaps one of the most difficult student to prevent from falling into The Dark Lord's hands. Since birth Draco had been groomed to become a Death Eater. The boy's father, Lucius Malfoy was adamant about Draco upholding the promise he had made to The Dark Lord. How he had managed to free Draco of that commitment without acknowledging which side he held true alliance to or without getting tortured was nothing short of a miracle. Draco was his godson and that alone made the blond the only family he had. Going behind Lucius's back had been risky, yet he didn't feel anything remotely close to friendship with the man anymore. Lucius had hated the fact that he was far more irreplaceable to The Dark Lord because of his position close to Albus and his skills in potions. Securing the status of The Dark Lord's second-hand man was the moment that fully cemented the idea that the friendship he had made with Lucius during their years at Hogwarts was only a ploy to gain favor of the higher statused Death Eaters at the time. Regardless he never held Lucius's actions against Draco, even though it was difficult at times to do so. In the blonds' first two years at Hogwarts he had been a downright annoying prat. The rivalry between his godson and Potter had given him enough headaches to last him years. Over time, however, he noticed a change in their relationship much like the one he had with Potter, both of them became more cordial. He wondered how that change had happened but was thankful for it nevertheless.<br/> "Draco Malfoy has indeed not pledged allegiance to The Dark Lord. There would be no reason for him to kill you."<br/> "Yeah I don't think he would go that far to win the house cup." Potter laughed.<br/> "For now we should focus on how to help Mr. Potter." Pomfrey said.<br/> "I agree."<br/> In that moment the infirmary doors opened announcing Minerva's return. She moved faster than he had ever seen her move before. Without a word she nearly thrust the empty vial towards him. Glaring he took the vial and uncorked it. A sweet smell rose from the nearly empty bottle, from a whiff he could identify the mixture. Recorking the vial he placed it into his robe's inner pocket to test out his theory later, though he was certain this now empty vial was the culprit of Potter's condition.<br/> "You didn't recognize that the potion smelled off?"<br/> "No."<br/> Anyone as paranoid as he was would notice the scent was off. Dreamless Sleep didn't have the sweet aroma that was clearly intended to entice the person into drinking the mixture. Whoever had planted this had gone through lengths not only to make the mixture appear like Dreamless Sleep but make it appetizing.<br/> "Surely there is something you can do Severus." Minerva said.<br/> One thing about being the Potions Master for Hogwarts was that often things came down to him to solve. Severus wasn't a man with all the answers ,yet that's what theses staff members expected of him. The knowledge he held was a double edge sword.<br/> "I do have knowledge about this mixture and it's affects."<br/> “So you can make an antidote?” Minerva asked with hopeful eyes.<br/> “ If I had the ingredients I could.”<br/> “Brilliant!” Potter beamed.<br/> “Before you all start celebrating I am unable to brew an antidote.”<br/> “With your skills I am sure you will be successful my boy.” Albus said.<br/> “It is not my skills that pose the issue.”<br/> “What is it?” Pomfrey asked.<br/> “A crucial ingredient needed for the antidote is unavailable.”<br/> Severus watched as Harry’s face paled at the news. He knew that the poisonous mixture would slowly kill the young Gryffindor without the proper antidote. Even if he were to bastardize one without this specific ingredient there would be little chance of success.<br/> “Surely there’s something you can do Severus.” Albus spoke, eyes still holding their twinkle even in this dire situation.<br/> “Headmaster the necessary ingredient was eradicated some years ago. Not even with my connections could I retrieve it. They were known to only grow in one place and as I’ve said they have ceased to exist.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry couldn’t take this conversation. Self-hatred was rising up as his mind berated him for falling for a simple trick. If he hadn’t drunk that potion then they wouldn’t have been in this mess. He could already see the headline of the DailyProfit The -Boy-Who-Lived death by stupidity, it was a thought that almost made him laugh. Truly he didn’t understand why Snape wasn’t laughing at his current predicament or telling him off. Usually Snape would claim his idiocy on being a Gryffindor and refuse to help. Harry was sure that the only reason Snape even did something ungit like was because of Dumbledore's insistence. Now he was doomed to die and there was nothing anyone could do about it.<br/> “If the ingredient doesn’t exist anymore...” He was thinking out loud, unwilling to give into the helplessness that was creeping up.<br/> “There was an abundance a few years ago, the only way to get it would be...”<br/> “Time turner!” He interrupted with his epiphany.<br/> “Don’t you dare interrupt me again Potter.” Snape warned.<br/> “Sorry Sir...But if we could go back in time then we could get the ingredient.”<br/> “Indeed, though it is not so easy to accomplish.”<br/> “If we use a time turner...”<br/> “And how do you suppose we acquire this time turner?” Snape asked with a raised eyebrow.<br/> “I...I know where to get one.”<br/> Harry wasn’t too sure if he was doing the right thing by exposing the secret time turner Hermione had. He looked between Snape’s curious brow and Dumbledore's’ twinkling eyes. He figured that the amount of trouble he would get into was nothing compared to the Wizarding World losing their savior. After the last time they had used the time turner it was agreed that they would keep it locked up in Hermione’s trunk until it could be safely placed in the Potter safe in Gringotts. They had yet to getting around to doing that with all the attacks on his life and whatnot. If he asked Hermione to borrow it just this once they stood a chance of saving his life.<br/> “Splendid.” Dumbledore smiled. “If you have access to a valuable item Professor Snape will be able to create the antidote.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once again Potter was getting away with defying both school rules and logic. As far as he knew all time turners were locked up within the Ministry. Leave it to Potter to get his hands on something that shouldn't have been in his possession. Severus didn't linger on that too long as it was a necessary item to save Potter's life. All the theories and texts wouldn't help the boy without that missing ingredient.<br/> "What do you suppose we do until they acquire the time turner?" Minerva asked Albus, who stood stroking his beard.<br/> "I am able to brew a temporary fix. It will be able to minimize the pain and could slow down the deterioration of your magical core."<br/> Emerald eyes once again were looking at him searching to see if he was telling the truth. The other members of the room too were wondering the same thing. He felt confident in creating a temporary fix, he had successfully done so a few years back. Within the tattered notebook there was a slim possibility of success and if he got his hands on the time turner that possibility would be more than a slim.<br/> "Thank you Professor."Potter said tearily eyed.<br/> "I will need some time to brew. I should be done after dinner. I suggest Pomfrey free the boy long enough to eat within the Great Hall with friends."<br/> "I do not need you to tell me what to do with my patients." Pomfrey huffed.<br/> "I agree with Severus's suggestion." Albus smiled.<br/> "But Albus!" Pomfrey protested.<br/> "Keeping Mr.Potter here will not do anything. I trust that he will return so I may administer the temporary fix." He asserted.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry couldn't believe that Snape was not only going to brew him something to make him feel better but was trying to grant him freedom from the infirmary. Vigorously he nodded at Snape's words. Getting out of here if only for dinner would be amazing.<br/> "We are in agreement then." Dumbledore chimed.<br/> "No we are not." Madam Pomfrey denied.<br/> "I understand your concern, but he will be out of your care for only a few hours." Dumbledore stated.<br/> "A lot can happen in a few hours."<br/> "I promise I won't do anything. Please Madam Pomfrey. You could do without me being here for a short time." He pleaded.<br/> "You truly think that he will be alright Severus..." Madam Pomfrey asked only to realize that Snape had disappeared. "Where did he go?"<br/> "Knowing him he went off to get straight to work." Dumbledore smiled.<br/> Definitely he had to ask Snape how he appeared and disappeared without a sound.<br/> "Ugg that man could at least announce his departure." Madam Pomfrey grumbled.<br/> "I completely agree." McGonagall nodded. "Would it ease your worries if I kept my eye on Mr. Potter."<br/> "Very well. I expect you back as soon as dinner ends."<br/> "Of course! Thank you!"<br/> "Go on then. Dinner will be starting in a few minutes." Dumbledore grinned.<br/> No one had to tell him twice. In a flash he hopped off the bed and dashed for the door. As soon as he made it past the doors he needed to slow down as his breathing hitched. This wasn't going to stop him now that he was free for the next few hours. Making his way to the Great Hall he ran into two familiar faces.<br/> "Ron! 'Mione!"<br/> "Harry!" His brunette friend launched into a hug.<br/> "Sprung out at last." Ron patted him on the back.<br/> "Actually I have to go back after dinner, but Snape managed to grant me few hours of freedom."<br/> "Snape?" The duo shrieked.<br/> Mentally he kicked himself for mentioning the potions professor. He wanted to keep what happened with Snape a secret now he had gone and messed things up.<br/> "Yeah...umm..I think he convinced Madam Pomfrey to let me go since he thinks I'm not that ill. You know him always going on about how I get special treatment."<br/> It was a little white lie.<br/> "I can't believe that git still gives you trouble. I can't stand it." Ron grumbled.<br/> "Perhaps next time you should give him a piece of your mind." He teased.<br/> "No way am I getting killed for mouthing off to him. Sorry mate."<br/> "You two know that Professor Snape isn't as bad as he seems." Hermione interjected.<br/> It was tempting to tell Hermione that she had no idea how un-gittish Snape could be. All those rumors about the man didn't come close to who Snape really was. Snape could be kind, could make him laugh.<br/> "Lets not waste the freedom I have. Come On I know you're starving Ron." He said, pushing thoughts of Snape aside.<br/> The Great Hall was slowly filling up with students. Already there were a few groups on each table chatting. Out of his peripheral vision he spotted the blond hair of Draco Malfoy. For years they had been rivals and on the Quidditch pitch they still were. The whole castle had gone mad the day they decided to bury the hatchet and started a friendship. He was so glad that day because deep down he knew it would hurt to see the blond on the opposite side of the battlefield. Regardless of the taunting they received from the Slytherin Ron and Hermione had accepted the idea of Draco being an ally. Things in the beginning had been more than rocky with Draco's taught prejudice slipping out at the worst possible moments. A good punch in the nose compliments of Hermione had finally broke the young man of the habit of saying certain words in the presence of Ron and Hermione. When his two best friends began snogging one another he was more than thankful to have Draco distract him with gossip. Apparently being one of the more feared students within the school granted the blond with endless information coming to his attention. Some days it was the typical gossips that ran around the school grounds, other times it was important information about which students were thinking about joining The Dark Lord. With his father being a known Death Eater Draco held swaying power with the students, even if he hadn't taken on the Dark Mark. That was another thing he had learned more about from his one-time rival. Draco had gone to great lengths to explain why people would willingly take on the Dark Mark.<br/> "You should at least say hello if you're gonna stare Potter." Draco remarked with a grin as he made his way towards him.<br/> "Who would want to stare at you Draco?" He said in mocked anger.<br/> "I have you know there are many people who admire my looks." Draco batted his eyes.<br/> "They should get their eyes checked."<br/> "That's rich coming from someone who still wears those awful glasses." Draco said reaching over to pluck said glasses off his face. "Really how do you see out of these Harry?"<br/> He liked how they had gotten into the habit of speaking to each other this way. Mocked insults fitted their previous interactions better than typical friendly chatter. As always he beamed at the blond trying on his glasses. Those large frames weren't as bad as they were in first year. His old glasses now were something that brought him joy whenever they were placed on his friend's face. The blurry features looked beyond ridiculous and it helped that the blond seemed to always forget just how blind he was.<br/> "Practice." He shrugged.<br/> "Take them back before I become as blind as you." Draco said sliding the glasses into Harry's hand.<br/> Replacing his glasses on his face the blurry world came back into focus. " Humm..Curious."<br/> "What is curious?"<br/> "You know Draco I think you look better when I don't have my glasses on."<br/> "Next Quidditch game you're dead." Draco playfully glared.<br/> "Why wait? Bring it on Malfoy." He smiled.<br/> "Next time. Your friends are waiting for you." Draco motioned to Ron and Hermione sitting with the rest of the Gryffindors. " Where have you been anyways? I didn't get to mock you at doubles potions today."<br/> "Infirmary."<br/> "Already? "<br/> "I'm trying to break my record for how many visits one student can have to the infirmary in a year." He joked.<br/> "You don't look that bad to me." Draco scoffed.<br/> Harry knew that Draco was worried about him even if his tone didn't say so. All of his friends were constantly worried about him.<br/> "Yeah I'm good. You don't look too bad either."<br/> "Unlike some people, I actually sleep and eat regularly."<br/> "I never thought to do that. You should become a healer.” He said in mocked awe.<br/> "Sod off Potter." Draco smiled.<br/> "Until next time." He winked.<br/> As the blond turned back to the Slytherin table he moved to his own house's table. Sliding into the seat beside Ron he was greeted by the smiling faces of his friends. More and more people filled the hall making it a tad bit uncomfortable. His time at the Dursleys had made him able to handle confined areas, still he was starting to feel entrapped. Staying calm he focused on the feast that had just appeared before them. Per usual Ron was the first to tear into the food, grabbing one of everything and placing it on his plate. Hermione started scolding Ron for stuffing his face when the sharp pain in his chest striked. Trying his best he bit back a whimper. Tears were forming in his eyes as another wave of pain rippled through him before he could recover from the first one. He had to be strong. He had promised Madam Pomfrey he would be okay. And Snape had believed that he could handle dinner with his friends. Out of habit his eyes moved straight to the Head table in search for the potions professor. Of course Snape wasn't there.<br/> "Snape is brewing a potion to make me feel better. I can handle this." He told himself.<br/> Taking a deep breath as possible he closed his eyes. He thought about last nights talk with Snape. Imagining that smooth voice of Snape was whispering how he should leave everything to him, his body began to relax. The pain was bearable again at the thought of Snape saying he would make it through this.<br/> "H..Harry?" A timid voice asked.<br/> Opening his eyes he saw Luna's boyfriend? Rolf Scamander staring worriedly at him. Luna sitting beside him tilted her head.<br/> "Are you alright Harry?" Rolf asked.<br/> "I am. I just got tired." He lied.<br/> "You know Harry you shouldn't sleep at the dinner table you never know what creatures might try to play tricks on you." Luna's lulling voice stated.<br/> He smiled at Luna's nonsense. It was nice to have her free spirit thinking around the Gryffindor table every once in awhile and Rolf was a good addition to the group. Lately his friends were pairing up, which made him a little lonely during dinings. If things weren't so shaky between Slytherins and Gryffindors he would invite Draco to join them.<br/> "You better eat!" Hermione scolded, finally turning her attention away from Ron.<br/> Reaching for a dinner roll he noticed Rolf pulling out a parchment and quill. Shrugging it off he bit into the warm bread.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was hot and humid besides the brewing cauldron. The thin smoke that rose from below was as soothing as a stiff drink to the potions master. Stirring counter clockwise for the last time he extinguished the fire. Boiling reduced to a simmer as the heat was removed. Referencing his notebook he was pleased with the color and consistency. Brewing this potion again brought up memories that he worked to keep at bay. This potion wasn't strong enough to negate the effects of a damaged magical core it only made things more bearable. Years of research and sacrifices had gone into making this incomplete elixir.<br/> "This will have to do for now." He muttered to himself as he bottled up the potion.<br/> Moving to the office attached to his classroom he dug through his desk in search of his travel bag. Dust clung to the old bag that hadn't seen light in who knew how long. Traveling had been at the very end of his list of things to do in the last several years. With the resurgence of The Dark Lord the only traveling he did was to Death Eater meetings and recruit missions. When the war was finally over he thought he would travel again, travel some place so far away that no one knew him or the horrible things he had done. Reaching into the bag he pulled out outdated maps, a small binder filled with plant samples,and a carefully wrapped up portkey. He knew that the portkey was still operational,which would be the best way to travel considering how pressing the issue was. He was still a little wary of using a time-turner. They were notorious for wreaking havoc in the hands of misguided witches and wizards. If he had given a time turner when he was younger he would've been one of those misguided wizards. He had to do this now or risk the savior of the wizarding world dying. Severus hated that Potter was being cultivated to be the sole hope of the wizarding world to defeat The Dark Lord. The boy who lived title came along with situations like this,making it increasingly difficult for him to prevent the boy from certain death. This time however was different. This was more nerve racking than preventing the boy from falling off a hexed broom during his first Quidditch game. This was more difficult than protecting the boy from a werewolf. It was even riskier than fulfilling his role as a spy. None of the things he had to do for Potter had required him to relive painful memories in this way. Not even those horrid occlumency lessons weren't close to scraping the surface of what this current incident was bringing up.</p><p> </p><p><br/> Stuffing his face as much as possible Harry listened to the chatter of his friends. He noticed Hermione looking over at him several times. To counteract her glances he made a show of parading around the food in his hand before taking a bite. She was always nagging him about eating more sweets than what she considered real food so he stood clear of the sweets tonight. He needed Hermione to be in a good mood so that she wouldn't get too cross about him borrowing the time turner again. One thing that he couldn't get out of was the in depth integration from the brunette, but hopefully he could avoid a scolding.<br/> "'Mione." He whispered.<br/> "What is it Harry?"<br/> "I need a favor."<br/> "I already told you that I'm not doing your homework ever again." Hermione said pointing her fork at him as if it were her wand.<br/> "I can do homework on my own." He huffed.<br/> He almost missed it when Hermione helped him out with his homework. It was so helpful for her to explain every little thing in the first two years at Hogwarts. Things changed in third year though when she offered to let him copy one of their charms assignments. Excitedly he took the offer only to be more confused at what she had written then in the text. Harry suspected that she had done it on purpose and blew up in frustration. In return she had snatched the assignment out of his hands levitated his textbook over his head and let it drop on his head before storming out. With a lot of apologizing they had made up,but she held to her threat of never doing his homework again.<br/> "This isn't about homework I promise.I need to borrow something."<br/> "Mate what's so important that it can't wait until after I'm done eating?" Ron said bringing attention to the fact that Ron was physically caught in the middle of their conversation.<br/> "Sorry Ron. It's very important."<br/> "Out with it." Hermione said moving closer.<br/> "Ineedthetimeturner."<br/> "What was that?"<br/> "I need the time turner." He whispered slowly.<br/> Both Ron's and Hermione's eyes widened. The gears in Hermione's heads were practically visibly moving trying to piece together some reason why he would need the time turner. Ron, on the other hand, was looking a bit more excited, probably because last time it was only Hermione and himself that got to go on a time traveling adventure, which wasn't as great as it sounded.<br/> "We shouldn't be talking about this here." Hermione warned. " I require an explanation."<br/> Nodding they all rose up from the table. Out of the corner of his eye he spotted Ron stuffing some food into his pockets. The others at their table didn't pay them any mind, they had grown so accustomed to the trio running off.<br/> "First no hello and now no goodbye? You have rubbish manners." Draco said as they passed by the Slytherin.<br/> "My apologies Sir Malfoy." He said sarcastically while pinching his robes in a mocked curtsey.<br/> "Glad to see you know your place."<br/> Sticking out his tongue he exited the Great Hall.<br/> "I will never understand why you two talk to each other like that." Hermione said.<br/> He shrugged. There weren't enough hours in the day to explain the strange friendship he and Draco had now. If he could he'd invite Draco to join in their discussion, but there would be too many questions and time was already so short. Right now he needed to convince Hermione to let him have the time turner without freaking her out with the truth. Later he hoped to fill in the blond so he wouldn't feel left out. Ducking into a nearby empty room was a better option than making it all the way to Gryffindor tower when he had to be back at the infirmary.<br/> "Out with it." Hermione said once she put up a silencing charm around them.<br/> "It's a long story."<br/> "Then give me the short version."<br/> Harry had no idea how he was supposed to come up with a short version of everything he had gone through in the last day and a half. The serious look in Hermione's eyes told him he better say something.<br/> "Okay short version is that Dumbledore needs it." He lied.<br/> "You're a terrible liar Harry." Ron pointed out.<br/> "I'm not lying. Dumbledore really does need it."<br/> "And he couldn't ask the Ministry for a time turner?" Hermione said.<br/> "Why go through that trouble when there's one here?" He retorted.<br/> "You better not be going on a fun adventure without me again mate." Ron spoke as he bit into a roll he had taken from the Great Hall.<br/> "Time traveling is not fun it is dangerous." Hermione snapped.<br/> " I know 'Mione. I swear I'm not going to use it to cause trouble."<br/> "You say that, but you never know."<br/> He was starting to feel ill again, the room was starting to spin, still he had to remain upright. Closing his eyes against vertigo he pretended to be thinking. Regretfully he opened his eyes. Both Ron and Hermione were looking at him worried again.<br/> "You don't look well at all mate."<br/> "We should bring you back to the infirmary." Hermione said moving to stop him from falling over.<br/> Silently he cursed himself for not being able to hide his illness. How could he explain that his magical core was damaged to them? Or worse that it was all a result of one stupid mistake.<br/> "No." He said pushing Hermione's hands off of him. "Not until..." It was getting hard to breathe again. "Not until you agree that I can borrow the time turner."<br/> It was a horrible thing to do, yet necessary. That time turner was all he had to offer against his latest mess up.<br/> "Harry!"<br/> "I am one hundred percent serious." He spoke with bravado. " I won't go back unless I hear you say I can borrow the time turner."<br/> "You're being ridiculous!"<br/> "Mate you are about to faint."<br/> "So what."<br/> It was growing increasingly hard to not sway. His friend's faces were starting to blur as his breath tightened in his chest. In just a few more seconds he would be on the ground unconscious and all this wouldn't have granted him what he needed. His mind drifted to Snape and how the man was going great lengths for him again. The least he could do was get the time turner.<br/> "Fine! You can borrow it." Hermione exclaimed.<br/> "Another Potter victory." He smiled.<br/> "Bloody Hell mate."<br/> "Hurry and help me get him to the infirmary." He heard Hermione call out as the surroundings began to dim.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Twenty minutes till the end of dinner Severus returned to the infirmary with the special potion in tote. He had arrived before Madam Pomfrey's return from the dining hall, though he assumed it would be only a moment until the medi-witch returned. This place felt even more disturbing without a soul occupying its space. Walking across the long room he stopped in front of the bed in the farthest corner. It was his bed. From the looks of it no one had been in it since his years attending Hogwarts. There was a good reason why this specific bed had gone unused. It wasn't as if he'd cursed the bed, simply it was one of the worst placements in the whole infirmary. It lived next to a wall that had the tiniest crack that let in the coldest air during the night and it was so isolated from the other beds that its occupant would be easily forgotten. He could still remember the one time after a nasty beating he had broken his leg and spent the night in the infirmary holding a pillow over his face to muffle his moans of pain all because the medi-witch had forgotten to give him a potion for the pain. Despite that incident he still insisted on that bed when he was forced to see the medi-witch. He preferred to be away from other injured or ill students because he didn't like seeing them like that and frankly everyone hated him. This rickety draft ridden bed was what he deserved. Potter's bed, in contrast, lived along the middle of the room. A perfect bed that was directly across from the medi-witch's office so its occupant could receive attention at the slightest sign of distress. It also was set up so that if necessary the two sides on either side could be moved to allow more room for privacy. It also had a decent distance to the bathroom attached to the infirmary. To Severus this perfectly visualized the distance between people like Potter and himself.<br/> He spun on his heels at the sound of the doors opening. If Pomfrey found him 'reminiscing' he wouldn't hear the end of it. Pomfrey wasn't the one who entered, even before he saw who it was he felt the magical energy of Harry Potter. A nearly unconscious Potter was being dragged by his fellow trouble making Gryffindor friends.<br/> "Professor Snape!" Ms. Granger just about shrieked when he approached them.<br/> "Give Potter to me." He instructed.<br/> The two worried filled Gryffindors looked at each other before pushing their slumped over friend towards him. Swooping up the Gryffindor was not an effortless motion with Potters limbs moving like wet noodles. Securing his grip he wandlessly cast a feather light spell and walked towards the famous Potter bed.<br/> "What happened?" He asked casting a nasty glare to show he demanded answers.<br/> "He fainted." The red haired one spoke up.<br/> "It does not take a medi-wizard to realize that Mr. Weasley."<br/> "Be nice Snape." Potter muttered eyes still closed.<br/> "Mr. Potter if you are conscious explain yourself."<br/> "Too...tired."<br/> Severus knew he had to administer the potion, but he knew it would look bad if he just shoved the vial into Potter's mouth with two witnesses around. Also he needed answers such as if Potter had eaten anything during dinner.<br/> "Ms. Granger what has brought Mr. Potter back in this state?"<br/> "He wasn't looking too well during dinner..."<br/> "Did he eat?" He interrupted.<br/> "Yes. He ate a lot more than usual after I nagged him. We were arguing a bit afterward and he started to look more ill, but he refused to come back here unless I agreed." Ms. Granger paused turning her attention to Potter. "He can be the most stubborn person on the Earth."<br/> "I got you to agree." Potter murmured.<br/> "Mr. Potter you should not gamble with your health." He warned.<br/> "Necessary."<br/> "Harry what you did was despicable, not necessary!"<br/> "Madam Pomfrey will be here momentarily so I suggest you two come back at a later time."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry didn't want Ron and Hermione to leave. Them leaving would mean Madam Pomfrey scolding him and waving her wand all around with the same tests they had done all day. He knew that once she saw him in this sorry state he'd never be able to leave this place again. His body felt so heavy yet he scooted up into a sitting position and turned to look at his friends.<br/> "I'll be fine."<br/> "We will see you tomorrow." Hermione said.<br/> "Bye mate." Ron said actively avoiding looking at Snape.<br/> Through barely open eyes he watched his friends exit. The second the door clicked shut Snape's hand was upon his forehead. It was so cold yet so comforting. His heart started to race as that hand was removed from his forehead and two fingers pressed to his neck. Snape's dark eyes were looking at him in a way that made him feel embarrassed.<br/> "You need to relax Potter." Snape said taking away his fingers from his neck. "Your heart is beating erratically for someone so still."<br/> "Sorry."<br/> "We must hurry before Pomfrey comes back if you wish to not be pestered for the rest of the night." Snape said pulling out a vial containing an unfamiliar purple mixture.<br/> "That's it?"<br/> "It is." Snape said uncorking the vial and handing it to him.<br/> "Does it taste bad?"<br/> "I made it especially disgusting for you." Snape smirked.<br/> Glancing at the vial in his hand he readied the mental list of all the horrid potions he had in this infirmary. This potion looked a lot better than most, but looks could be deceiving. In one motion he chugged down the potion hoping that the aftertaste wouldn't be as bad if he got it in his mouth as quickly as possible. He expected to taste something along the lines of rotting fish, instead it tasted more like a bitter tea with something he couldn't put his finger on. It wasn't terrible at all. Looking at Snape for answers the man stood indifferent. A warm feeling filled his body like a nice cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter day. The heaviness that had settled in his body was lifting little at a time. He felt good, perhaps better than he had felt in a long time.<br/> "Thank you."<br/> "Are you experiencing any pain?"<br/> "No."<br/> "Good." Snape said looking over something in a tattered notebook. "Now tell me, Potter, what was so important about your argument with Ms. Granger that you had risked your health?"<br/> "It was about the time turner. I managed to get her to let me have it."<br/> "So it was in Ms. Granger's possession."<br/> Harry felt guilty for unintentionally tossing Hermione under the bus. There was no way he could lie to Snape forever about the time turner. Eventually everything he did that was deemed as mischief would be known to the man, even without the mind reading ability.<br/> "So now you see that it was necessary. She wouldn't agree if I didn't threaten not to come back here."<br/> "I would think Ms. Granger would be working a way to address your condition." Snape spoke with a quizzical brow.<br/> "She would...that is if...if I told her."<br/> He felt awful for keeping his friends in the dark about his condition. They deserved to know. He just couldn't tell them. If he just kept taking Snape's potion he could make it through never telling them.<br/> "You should tell them." Snape muttered so softly that he wasn't sure if the man had even spoken.<br/> Something was in those dark eyes, whatever it was had shown up more now than it ever had before. Guilt would eventually eat at him for not telling his friends what was going on, still he couldn't. If he told them it would make this all feel too real. Too permanent. No he wouldn't tell them.<br/> "I will later." He lied.<br/> "Mr. Potter I never want to find you incapacitated due to your stupidity again understood." Snape commanded.<br/> "Understood." He gulped.<br/> Snape looked him in the eye, probably seeking for any sign of disobedience. The eye contact broke as Madam Pomfrey returned.<br/> "Ah good you're here Severus." She said almost pushing the potions professor aside to be near him.<br/> "I have already administered the potion."<br/> "How are you feeling now Mr. Potter?" Madame Pomfrey asked. waving her wand around yet again.<br/> "A lot better! I could take on a dragon right now."<br/> Snape scoffed at his words. He didn't care. Snape could berate him for hours and he would simply smile because he knew there wasn't hostility between them now. Snape's words didn't hold the same cutting power as they had when he was a first year. In first year it took everything not to burst into tears at the potions master's strong words. Back then it felt like every little mistake he made was magnified in the potions professor's eyes. That slow drawl made the hairs at the back of his neck stand up way more than anything his Uncle or Aunt yelled. Eventually he had learned that there was no true threat in his professor's words. The name calling was nothing compared to being called a worthless filthy freak while getting beaten. As a professor Snape couldn't beat him or hex him, learning that had helped build a slight arrogant attitude. In Second year he had been a prat and for good reason. Draco had been rather nasty with taunts that year and after their duel, in which he spoke to the snake Bloody Lockhart couldn't dispose of. Majority of the student body had turned their back on him for being a Parselmouth. All that frustration had to come out somehow so what better place than against the snarky dungeon bat. Draco was always getting away with taunts and pranks during their potions class so when he was given detentions for retaliating he'd glare at Professor Snape when he wasn't looking. Hatred for both Snape and Draco changed not too long after Sirius's death.<br/> Both had refrained from nasty comments, threats, or detentions. Depression had covered most of that year in a blur. It had been so hard to lose his godfather. The next year he tried to aggravate Draco at any given opportunity just so he could feel something. One day he called the blond out to a duel at midnight. That night he had waited and waited yet the Slytherin didn't make an appearance. Ambushing Draco he dragged him into an abandoned classroom. He had needed a fight to get out all of his feelings. At the time it felt right to take it out on Draco, his father was Voldemort's greatest follower and it was His aunt who killed his godfather. Draco had refused to fight. "If you want to hurt me go ahead. It won't make you feel better for long though." Draco had said with a sad looking his eyes. "What would you know?" He had cried out, wand pointed with intent to harm his fellow student. "I worry about my godfather every day. I've seen what The Dark Lord is capable of... No one deserves what happened to Sirius Black...I'm sorry for your loss." Those words had been so sincere so genuine that instead of hexing Draco into next week he had broken down in tears he had long thought were dried up. Draco didn't laugh at him then, just stood beside him listening to his sobs rubbing his back. In that moment he didn't worry about Draco's actions being a ploy. That incident had changed their dynamic. They had become friends slowly, occasionally coming back to this place to talk about things that he didn't discuss with others.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"You do look much better Mr. Potter." Pomfrey said.<br/> Potter looked to be lost in thought with a teary look on his face. Severus knew it would be easy to peer into those thoughts, still he refrained from doing so. If this had been a few years ago he could read the Gryffindor without effort. In first year Potter's thoughts would sometimes be telegraphed to him and in second year thoughts of how much the young Gryffindor hated him practically were shouted at him. Potter was no longer an open book with his thoughts, however that didn't mean he couldn't read certain movements or expressions.<br/> "Severus you've done it!"<br/> "This is only a temporary relief." He stated. "I will return tomorrow morning to check up on the uptake. Alert me if there is any issues."<br/> "I will fire call you at the first sign of distress."<br/> With a nod he moved for the exit.<br/> "Severus." Pomfrey called out. "Please eat something."<br/> He bit back a comment about people suddenly caring for his eating habits. Instead he turned to Potter, who appeared to be coming out of his thoughts. If Pomfrey wasn't around he would once again tell the young wizard to inform his friends about his condition. As hard as it would be for the Gryffindor to give such terrible news he knew all too well of how devastating it was to learn about something so serious too late. Potter still had some time. If he told his friends now they could make fond memories of his last moments. Without the actual antidote he knew Potter could live until the end of this year or maybe a little more than that. He was unease for relying on the ludicrous idea of time traveling for an extinct plant to save Potter's life. Logic told him that Potter couldn't count on him finding the eradicated plant. With the temporary relief potion he could grant Potter a few months of normality. After that he would do his best to adjust it. The inevitable would happen without the antidote and when that time came he wouldn't be able to do a thing to stop it.<br/> "I expect you to behave yourself."<br/> "I will. Goodnight Professor Snape."<br/> "Good night Mr. Potter. Pomfrey." He said before departing.<br/> With robes billowing around him he made his way back to the dungeons. Potter had taken well to the potion so now he could proceed with brewing more. He was in for a long night of brewing. Thankfully tomorrow he didn't have to teach and he hadn't to deal with any detentions this Saturday. He needed to make as much of this potion as possible. Once Potter secured the time turner Albus would send him on his way to retrieve the missing antidotal ingredient. The sooner he left the better, though he wasn't sure if there was a way to come back. All he knew of time turners were the brief descriptions in old texts and rumors. Well they were more horror stories than anything. For now he didn't want to think about the ramifications of going back in time. Brewing. All he had to think about now was brewing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Saturday morning greeted Harry with another sharp intake of air. The nice feelings of the potion had worn off. The pressure was returning to his chest as if someone were steadily stacking large books on top of him. With a huff he shifted his position on the bed bracing for the sharp pain that came with this pressure.<br/> "Mr. Potter how are we feeling today?" Madam Pomfrey asked.<br/> Soundlessly he groaned. There was no telling how much longer he could handle hearing that same question over and over again. And the tests that didn't appear to do anything but make Madame Pomfrey's mouth form a thin line. What was she expecting? What were any of them expecting? They were probably expecting TheBoyWhoLived to be invincible. That was something he wasn't even with his 'Potter luck'. If he were truly invincible he wouldn't be laying here thinking about what he was going to tell his friends. How could he lie to their faces each day as if nothing were wrong. He had thought he'd made up his mind about that, he wasn't going to tell them, but Snape's words looped in his mind all night. If that baritone voice wasn't so soothing to his ears it would've kept him up most of the night.<br/> "How am I going to tell them?" He whispered to the ceiling as Madam Pomfrey laid his breakfast tray down.<br/> She didn't leave after setting the food down like he thought she would. Madam Pomfrey stood beside his bed eyeing him. There was an uncomfortable smile on her face, the one you'd use when you didn't know what to say. Since all of this started it had been hard for them to talk to him. Dumbledore had no trouble giving him knowing looks, which pissed him off since he wanted to know what exactly the Headmaster knew. Other than those looks they hadn't spoken much. Professor McGonagall was the hardest to deal with. All through dinner he could feel her eyes on him. The sad look in her eyes dug into him as if he'd greatly disappointed her, which he knew wasn't the case. Disappointed wasn't what his head if house was feeling for him, no that feeling was his own. He was letting people down by not living up to the pedestal he was placed on since first year. Up til now he had gotten out of scrapes deemed impossible. Now he was reduced to this. Soon when his magic could no longer stand against Voldemort he'd be thrown away. What good was the chosen one if he couldn't complete the thing he was chosen to do?<br/> "How the mighty have fallen." He thought.<br/> "Mr. Potter this must be a very difficult time for you."<br/> He wanted to scoff. He didn't. Madam Pomfrey was only trying to help.<br/> "I'm here to listen if you desire to speak... I wish I could do more. I'm beside myself for not being able to do more."<br/> Her words reminded him of something important. Love. Here he was loved. Professor McGonagall, Dumbledore, Madam Pomfrey, as well as others loved him since he started coming to Hogwarts. The people he had come to know here weren’t like the Dursleys. The Dursleys would toss him out if he couldn’t do simple things. The Dursleys had led him to believe everything was his fault. Living in that house taught him that he was nothing, something so replaceable that he worked so hard to remain useful. There was no love there. Privet Drive wasn’t his home.This school was his home. He felt ashamed of thinking they would toss him away now. Tears were welling up in his eyes.<br/> "Are you alright dear?"<br/> "I will be cured." He said fighting back the tears. "I won't give up."<br/> "Neither will I." Madam Pomfrey smiled fighting back her own tears.</p><p> </p><p><br/> Sunlight stung his tired eyes as he emerged from the dungeons. It had been at least two days now since he slept or ate anything more than the sandwich Albums forced him to eat. Those were trivial matters at the moment. This wouldn't be the first or last time he ran himself ragged. A Pepperup potion would do wonders if it weren't for his empty stomach. Food could wait until Potter received his potion and he instructed Pomfrey on what to be aware of after administering it. Only after making absolutely sure that Pomfrey understood his concoction and could comprehend his notes about combating possible side effects would he have an appetite. As for sleep that was simply something he didn't want to do.<br/> Both Potter and Pomfrey was in tears when he entered the infirmary. If it weren't for his years of practice of remaining aloof he would've run up to the two in a panic. Pomfrey spotted him before Potter did and she shook her head as if the action was supposed to tell him something. Gradually he approached the two not looking at Potter. He was far too exhausted to deal with those tear filled eyes.<br/> "I take it there were no issues last night." He addressed the medi-witch.<br/> All throughout the night he was brewing he paid utmost close attention to the fireplace in his office. Not a single call was made to him. That wasn't enough to quench his unwilling paranoia. At every given moment he could spare away from the brewing cauldron he would check on his fireplace.<br/> "No he slept soundly. He didn't even stir when I checked in on him." Pomfrey said, tears drying on her face.<br/> "Sir?" Potter's voice still held a tired tone.<br/> Being the stubborn man he was he didn't look at the Gryffindor. He had seen enough tears to last him a life time.<br/> "I will need to instruct you on Potter's care."<br/> "I am still at a loss of how you accomplished this." Pomfrey said.<br/> It wasn't as if the woman was doubting his skills, potions for damaged magical cores were just something that others hadn’t successfully created. Most information on damaged magical cores composed theories and studies on the last moments of the patient's life. Such information was limited. Of course he had his own studies, which he had achieved through less than desirable means years ago. For all the studying he had done it wasn't enough, still it was the closest thing anyone had come to creating a feasible antidote. Most Potions Masters had given up on it.<br/> "It is temporary." He reminded.<br/> "Thank Merlin we have you."<br/> Compliments given to him were few and far apart. Aside from the 'compliments' given by The Dark Lord he didn't know how to react. Compliments always sounded so fake to his ears. Anything directed at him that wasn't anger or fear seemed off. Giving a nod he pulled out the scroll of instructions from his inner pocket. Pomfrey took it and steadily began reading it.<br/> "Sir?" Potter spoke up again.<br/> This time he did turn to face him. Thankfully there were no more tears on Potter's face. Those emerald eyes still held a tint of red from the crying. Staring at those puffy eyes he wondered how many more times he would have to see that look.<br/> "Potter?"<br/> The Gryffindor's bottom lip was caught between teeth. Emerald eyes were raking over him again so he stood up taller. With his usual arched brow he watched Potter biting his lower lip. It was such a horrible habit of the boy. Noticing the mountain of food still untouched he wondered what was wrong.<br/> "I...This is..."Pomfrey spoke.<br/> "If there is something you do not comprehend we can go over it." He said pulling out the case of Potter's potion. "I have brewed enough to last a few weeks."<br/> "I will secure these away right now. Give me a chance to go over this a few more times." The medi-witched motioned to the scroll as she balanced the case in her arms. "Seriously Severus you never could write in plain English."<br/> "Then allow me to translate my notes into imbecile for you." He smirked as Pomfrey huffed.<br/> "Sir."<br/> They were alone again. It bothered him how many times they've been left alone together recently.<br/> "What is it?"<br/> "Here." Potter said holding out a small plate with a scone on it.<br/> The Hogwarts scones were one of his favorites. They've always been his favorite since his first year. He had practically gorged himself on them in his first week.<br/> "What is the meaning of this?"<br/> "You should eat."<br/> "You are the one who needs to eat before I can administer the potion." He said crossing hands.<br/> "I won't eat until you do."<br/> "I have eaten."<br/> "No you haven't!" Potter said with a weak glare.<br/> "And how would you know?"<br/> "I....I didn't see you at any meals."<br/> "Keeping an eye on me?"<br/> "It's not like that." Potter huffed with tinted cheeks.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Why does Snape have to be so stubborn?" Harry thought.<br/> All he wanted to do was help out the man a little. Those bags under Snape's eyes worried him. Plus he hadn't seen him at meals for the past two days. True it wasn't the first time the potions professor was absent from the Great Hall, still it bothered him. If only he could make this stubborn person eat then he would feel at ease. Holding out the plate with conviction he tried again.<br/> "Eat."<br/> "Mr. Potter I do not take orders from you." Snape spat.<br/> "Please..." His words were caught off by a sharp pain.<br/> It felt like someone had just stabbed straight through his heart. Air caught in his throat, still he didn't drop the plate. His eyes tried to remain on Snape as another pain skewered his lungs.<br/> "Potter."<br/> "Please....Eat." He wheezed.<br/> Suddenly the plate in his hand felt lighter. Dropping his hand he leaned back to ride out the pain. He watched as Snape bit into the scone.<br/> "Good." He smiled.<br/> "Now you must do the same." Snape said suddenly pushing a piece of toast towards him.<br/> The pain was subsiding. Arms felt too heavy to reach for the bread. Tilting his head forward he bit into the toast. Chewing on the bite he caught Snape's eyes widen slightly. His whole face burned hot the moment he realized that he had just been hand fed by Snape. Snape! The Potions Professor that always acted like he was the most pestering person in all of Wizarding Britain. Snape had probably expected him to take the toast and he had bitten into it while it was still in those potion stained fingertips.<br/> "Sorry."<br/> "I thought I warned you to not gamble with your health." Snape drawled, returning the toast to the tray.<br/> "It's the quickest way to get what I want lately." He smiled.<br/> "Eat."<br/> "Join me."<br/> "I don't think you would stomach sharing a meal with me." Snape said while stepping back. "What would your friends say if they caught you dining with the Greasy Dungeon bat?"<br/> He was at lost for words. He never knew that Snape was aware of the nickname the students had given him. Before he couldn't say anything Snape moved toward Madam Pomfrey's office and the front doors opened. Quick steps distracted him long enough for Snape to slip away.<br/> "He could've stuck around." He mumbled to himself.<br/> "Morning mate." Ron greeted.<br/> "Morning you guys."<br/> "Here." Hermione said tossing a small bag at him. "Now spill.I want to know everything."<br/> "What no hello?"<br/> "Hello. Now tell me what's going on. I've been wracking my head with possible reasons for you to want that."<br/> "Let him eat first before tearing into him." Ron said snatching a muffin off his tray.<br/> "He can multitask."<br/> He loved Hermione's insistent nature when it wasn't directed at him. Picking up the toast that he had already he bit from he tried his best not to blush. No way could he explain what had just happened between him and Snape. Eating would provide him enough time to think of a better lie to tell his friends.<br/> "I told you that Dumbledore needed it."<br/> "For what purpose?"<br/> "He doesn't tell me everything 'mione."<br/> "He must've said something."<br/> "He didn't." He said taking a bite out of the fried eggs.<br/> "If I marched up to his office would he say he told you nothing?"<br/> "Go ahead." Hermione didn't know the password.<br/> "Harry!"Hermione said slapping him on his arm.<br/> "Hey I'm sick."<br/> "If you weren't you would get a punch. I haven't forgiven you for what you did yesterday."<br/> "I'm sorry."<br/> "We were worried sick mate. She even wanted to get Malfoy to talk some sense into you."<br/> "Where is the blond weasel anyway?" He asked, glancing at the door just in case Draco walked in.<br/> "Slytherin has Quidditch practice."<br/> "Oh." He said pushing around the oatmeal in his bowl.<br/> If he had to reveal all that was happening he wanted Draco to be there. Draco deserved to know too. For everything they were put through Draco had become a support system far different from Ron or Hermione. He still felt supported by his two old friends, but it was different with Draco. Probably because Draco knew the darker side of the war. They could share stories with each other without having to censor them so no one got upset. And if needed they could throw spells at one another to let off steam.<br/> "Harry." Hermione said taking his hand. "Please I need to know what is wrong. Don't keep us in the dark."<br/> Snape's words echoed in his mind saying that he should tell them.<br/> "Alright I will tell you. Not here though. Not yet." He whispered.<br/> "And why not?"<br/> "Snape is here." He lowered his voice as much as possible.<br/> "He is?" Ron asked looking over his shoulder.<br/> "In Madam Pomfrey's office."<br/> "You shouldn't scare me like that. I could've had a heart attack." Ron said, returning to stuffing his mouth.<br/> "One would think your eating habits would result in a heart attack Mr. Weasly." Snape said suddenly appearing.<br/> "I swear saying his name summons him." He mumbled to himself.<br/> "Mr. Potter." Snape spoke with authority. "Did you eat or has someone else consumed your much-needed meal?"<br/> A chuckle had to be contained.Ron's face was priceless pale and paused in mid chew not knowing what to do with the food in his mouth.<br/> "I did eat."<br/> "This will not end well if taken on an empty stomach." Snape warned as he pulled out the same purple colored potion from yesterday.<br/> "I understand." He said taking the potion.<br/> This time he didn't toss the potion into his mouth so quickly. He tipped the contents into his mouth as if it were a cup of pumpkin juice. The strange bitter tea flavor covered his tongue. He tried to pinpoint the other flavor with no luck. That warm feeling washed over him again. So comforting.<br/> "Thank you." He said handing back the empty vial.<br/> "I must return to Madam Pomfrey. If you sneak out I suggest getting back before lunch." Snape said.<br/> He watched as Snape slyly slipped the pre bitten scone into his hand before the flowing outer robes hid it.He pretended not to have noticed the subtle move. It was enough to just know that the man was going to have something in his stomach.<br/> "Did Professor Snape just told you to sneak out of the infirmary?" Hermione asked with a wide eyed look.<br/> "He's probably setting you up for detention." Ron commented.<br/> "Maybe." He shrugged.<br/> "Why is here anyway?" Ron whispered.<br/> "Obviously helping out Madam Pomfrey."He said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Severus rolled his eyes again at Pomfrey's frustrated huffs. If it weren't for the scone he had snatched he would be even more peeved then he was. In his rush to get Potter his second dose he hadn't fully translated his notes. It wasn't his fault that others couldn't understand his thought process. Having to translate his work into simpler terms was a headache and a half, yet it did quench his paranoia.Never would he have to worry about other potions masters stealing his instructions and claiming his intellectual property. He hoped that Potter and his gang would leave while he distracted the medi-witch so the trio could talk. Once he was gone Pomfrey was sure to keep Potter on a short leash.<br/> "I think I understand it now Severus."<br/> "Are you sure or are you just saying that so I will leave?"<br/> "I have not spent years educating myself and going through rigorous training just so I could be humiliated by you. Honestly you write these instructions in such a convoluted way just to spite me."<br/> "I actually do it to spite everyone." He smirked.<br/> "Watch that tone young man." Pomfrey warned as she smacked him on the arm with the rolled up parchment.<br/> "Good morning." Albus said suddenly stepping through the fireplace in a green puff of smoke.<br/> "Goodmorning Headmaster." Pomfrey greeted.<br/> He nodded.<br/> "Oh my boy. I am glad you are here. How is Harry doing?"<br/> "He appears to be responding to the potion well. I recently gave him his dose and have been educating Pomfrey on its properties."<br/> "Excellent. Let's greet our brave Harry a goodmorning." Albus chimed as he made his way out of the office.<br/> The trio still remained in the same arrangement when he had left. The tray of food was gone.<br/> "Good morning all." Albus spoke.<br/> "Goodmorning Dulmborbore." The trio chime in unison.<br/> "It's a lovely day don't you think? Perhaps you two should enjoy it."<br/> "You're right. Come along Ron."Ms. Granger said dragging the Weasley boy along.<br/> "I'll see you later." Potter called out.<br/> Ms. Granger was always a smart student, able to pick up on the insinuated order from the Headmaster. From the lack of fuss he suspected that potter had yet to tell them what was going on.</p><p> </p><p><br/> “How are you feeling?” Dumbledore asked.<br/> “A lot better...Oh!” He said reaching for the small bag Hermione had tossed at him. “I got it. The time turner.” He smiled.<br/> “Wonderful!” Dumbledore said clasping a hand on his shoulder. “Severus are you prepared to go?”<br/> “I am. I have provided enough potions for my absence and have made arrangements just incase.” Snape said.<br/> “I don’t think those will be necessary.” Dumbledore said.<br/> “What do you mean?” He asked.<br/> “Time turners are very sensitive objects.” Dumbledore said.<br/> “We are unsure of the effects of traveling so far back in time. Whether I am able to come back.”<br/> Harry didn’t like the sound of that. What was he suppose to do if Snape was gone? Would he even know that Snape was gone?<br/> “You worry far too much at your young age Severus.”<br/> “I worry enough.” Snape said crossing his arms.<br/> “You can’t let him go! If he can’t come back...” He uttered.<br/> “He will make it back.” Dumbledore said with a knowing twinkle in his eyes.<br/> “How do you know?” He asked hoping that Dumbledore had an actual answer and not just relying on blind hope.<br/> “Some years ago I stumbled upon a spell that combines the ability of a time turner and a portkey. I believe I can grant Professor Snape three days in the past to complete the task and then bring him back to our time.”<br/> “I’m going!” He said sitting up straighter.<br/> “Out of the question!” Snape objected.<br/> “Please Sir let me go with you.”He said standing up from his bed in some sort of evidence that he was more than willing to go.<br/> “It’s dangerous. Your current condition will continue to make you weak until it consumes your magical core. Not even my skills can prevent that.”<br/> He stared into those dark eyes unwavering. He had to go.<br/> “I rather slowly die while getting this ingredient than waiting around helpless in the infirmary.”He put every ounce of his Gryffindor bravery into the statement. He couldn’t and wouldn’t wait for Snape to return. He couldn’t let Snape do this on his own.<br/> “It might be wiser to administer the antidote as soon as the ingredient is collected, there is no telling if time traveling would corrupt its properties.”<br/> “Thank you!”<br/> He felt so overjoyed that he hugged Professor Snape. The embrace lasted no more than a few seconds as the professor's body tensed up,making Harry realize just how uncomfortable the man was. “Sorry.” He said as he removed himself from the embrace.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Severus was not an affectionate man. He hadn’t received much affection in his life after his mother’s death. Anything more than a quick handshake was all he could stomach and that was all he ever expected from another person. Certainly a hug from the-boy-who-drives-him-insane was something he had never expected to receive. Potter was a bundle of emotion, as to be expected when given the news that you were dying, still a hug? Severus couldn’t remember the last time anyone had hugged him. He thanked Merlin that the hug had ended as quickly as it started. He also thanked Merlin that his years of perfecting his mask of aloofness prevented either Pomfrey or Albus to see how shocked he was by the action.<br/> He stared at the young Gryffindor who had the audacity to hug him. A tint of pink colored Potter’s cheeks. If it weren’t for Albus sudden cough he would’ve teased the young man about the reaction.<br/> “I think it’s a splendid idea that you two go on this trip.” Albus smiled.<br/> “You make it sound as if we are going on vacation.” He said trying not to roll his eyes.<br/> “It will be a good way to get to know each other.”<br/> There was that insufferable twinkle in the old coots eyes again. Severus wondered just how Albus saw the world from those half moon glasses. If he didn’t know any better he’d claim that those twinkling eyes were some sort of charm. Such things were possible considering the headmaster tended to do things like lace tea with Calming Draught. For once he didn’t want to be looked at in this way, to come face to face with a look that said the Headmaster knew all. In his opinion the old coot didn’t know anything, especially when it came to the so called ‘relationship’ he had with Potter. He only cared for the young man out of duty and guilt from things he long wished to forget. There was no getting to know each other when he was sure that the boy wonder hated him. It was understandable for the savior of the light to hate someone like him, most people in fact hated him. All the things he had done for the light would go unknownst with the exception of certain staff and Order members.<br/> “Get to know each other? This is a serious matter not a summer camp!” He snapped.<br/> “When can we go!” Potter beamed.<br/> Clearly no one understood the risk of this little adventure. Even if he chose to believe Albus had the right spell to bring them back to this time in one piece they didn’t know what to expect once they went back in time. All of this was starting to give him a headache.<br/> “It is dangerous.” He mumbled.<br/> “You’ve already said that.”<br/> “And I will continue to say it Mr. Potter until you get it through that thick skull of yours.”<br/> “I’ll go pack!” Potter said ready to make a break for it.<br/> “I have already done the honors.” Albus smiled.<br/> “Really?”<br/> He wanted to roll his eyes. Of course Albus who knows everything Dumbledore would already have Potter’s things together. When would these imbeciles realise that this wasn’t an average camping trip.<br/> “Would you like me to request a house-elf to fetch your things Severus?” Albus asked.<br/> “No I can fetch it myself.”<br/> “I shall open up your floo connection.” Albus said in a tone that it wasn’t a suggestion.<br/> Stepping into Pomfrey’s office Albus opened the floo and he stepped through into the his office. Albus followed with Potter. His office still was a mess with books piled up all over. Now that Potter was going to accompany him he needed to pack even more supplies.<br/> “Here you are Albus.” He said carefully handing the wrapped up portkey.<br/> “Do you need help Sir?” Potter asked him.<br/> “Do not touch anything except my books.” He ordered as he moved to pick out brewing equipment.<br/> He rather Potter not touch any of his things yet he didn’t like the idea of leaving his office in this state. Out of the corner he watched Potter pick up some books and place them back on the shelves. Albus stood out of both their ways waving a wand along the time turner and portkey in his hand.<br/> “What does this missing ingredient look like?” Potter asked while lifting a small pile of books.<br/> “It looks like this.” He said picking up the only book that held a sketch of the plant.<br/> “Funny looking isn’t it?” Potter said taking the book. “Should we bring this book?”<br/> “There is no need to bring it I have sketched it in my notes.” He said holding out his tattered note book to the page with his sketch.<br/> “Wow! It’s like an exact copy.”<br/> “It should be. I spent a great deal of time on it.”He said returning the notebook to his pocket.<br/> “So we need to go back in time a few years and get this plant thing?”<br/> “I’m afraid it’s far more complicated than that.”<br/> “How complicated?”<br/> “This specific plant thing as you call it only grew in one location,which is not in this vicinity.”<br/> “So where do we have to go?”<br/> “Somewhere more tropical.”<br/> “I have finished and taken the liberties of getting your things.” Albus said handing a full bag to Potter.<br/> “How does this work exactly?” He asked slinging his own magicked bag over his shoulder before taking a stance besides Potter.<br/> “You have to take each other's hands. Harry you take the time turner. Severus the portkey.”<br/> They complied with the instructions. Holding hands with Potter was a necessity and nothing more. He eyed as the timeturner now hunged on Potter’s neck.<br/> “Good with your free hand Harry turn the time turner and at the same time Severus remove the wrapping from the portkey.” Albus said placing the wrapped portkey in his hand. “The spell will work as soon as these two motions occur. You should be able to last three days over there. After that time the you will need to join hands again with these items close by so I suggest you keep them on your person at all times while there. Good luck.”<br/> This was it.<br/> “Ready Potter?”<br/> “Ready.”<br/> On the count of three they followed Albus’s instructions. Suddenly their surroundings blurred and they were being pulled to somewhere else. All too quickly they stumbled into a new place. Heat hit him first. He had forgotten how hot it was here,especially when he was dressed in black. Potter leaned into him looking like he was going to puke.<br/> “I’m alright.” Potter said swaying. “Where...where are we?” Potter said shading his eyes from the bright sun.<br/> “Welcome Mr. Potter to The Garden Island.”</p>
