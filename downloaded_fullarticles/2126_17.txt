    <p>“Potter and Malfoy have both spotted the snitch and are neck and neck to reach it!” Sounded the Quidditch commentator, Hugo Granger-Weasley as the crowd around him both cheered and booed for their opposite houses.</p><p>Scorpius caught Albus’ smirk out the corner of his eyes and he retorted by huffing out his nose in faux annoyance. <em>What a tosser,</em> Scorpius thought, not that he really thought that. Scorpius pushed on, following the snitch as it nose-dived towards the grounds. Albus was hot in his heels, but Scorpius had no more of an inch advantage. He heard Albus swear just behind him and Scorpius couldn’t help but laugh. They may have been friends, but on the pitch, it was every man for themselves.</p><p>“Malfoy no doubt has this snitch in the bag,” announced Hugo. “Slytherin team captain Nathan Parkinson prepares himself for one last attempt at distracting Potter with a bludger as the Gryffindor chasers are desperate to get in a few more goals, as though that will help them this late in the game. The only thing saving Gryffindor at this point is if Potter catches the snitch and- oooh. That's going to hurt.”</p><p>Scorpius could taste blood in his mouth as he collided harshly with the grounds of the Quidditch pitch. Thankfully, the snitch was flying low, so the fall wasn’t too drastic, it was more the hit from the bludger that hurt. A wave of vertigo washed over him and Scorpius rolled onto his stomach, propped himself up on his knees and waited for the nausea to pass. Scorpius spluttered blood on the floor, trying to catch his breath by coughing; the bludger left him winded. Pain ebbed through his stomach and ankle as he dry-heaved, which turned into a violent cough. Scorpius collapsed onto his back once the nausea had eased, trying to steady his breathing through the pain.</p><p>“Was that a direct attack on his own team member? Everyone knows the beef between team captain Parkinson, Seeker Malfoy and Keeper Zabini, but are tensions high enough to potentially cost your own team the cup, Parkinson?” Scorpius wished with all his might that Hugo would just shut the <em>fuck </em>up. Not only was his relationship – or current lack thereof – not of his or anybody else’s damn business, but his voice was cutting through his headache and making him feel worse.</p><p>The pain started in his ribs where the bludger initially hit, but the harsh and unfortunate landing meant his ankle now seared with pain.</p><p>“What is Albus Potter doing?” Hugo asked over the microphone. <em>Probably winning,</em> Scorpius thought bitterly, clenching his teeth as the pain ripped through him.</p><p><em>Just get up, you wimp, </em>he told himself. Scorpius took a deep breath – Hugo hadn’t announced that Albus had caught the snitch which meant the game could not have been over yet. If he could just get up, swallow the pain and mount his broom, there was still chance for Slytherin to win the cup. Scorpius snapped his eyes open, and funnily enough, there was Albus Potter. He was standing over him, eyes wide with worry.</p><p>“Are you okay?” He asked, his voice genuine. Scorpius grimaced.</p><p>“Fabulous,” he managed, shooting a small smile up at Albus. Albus held his hand out which Scorpius gratefully took, ignoring the warmth it sent through him. With a lot of groaning and muffled screams, Scorpius was standing on his feet – his foot. The one he landed on was not looking too peachy, but he could get that checked out afterwards.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Scorpius asked Albus as the game finally come to a halt, Madame Hooch touching down to check on them both.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“You could have won, you idiot,” there was no harshness to his tone, only slight humour.</p><p>“Your own team just bludgered you off your broom, idiot,” he retorted with the same tone, “someone had to help. Besides, we’ve played poorly, we don’t deserve to win. Ten more points from Slytherin and it doesn’t matter which of us catches the snitch because you’d have won,” he had a point. Not that Scorpius was going to admit that.</p><p>Albus helped Scorpius back over to his broom, he had rolled quite the distance from it. Madame Hooch had finally made her way over.</p><p>“Are you alright, Mr Malfoy?” She asked, giving him the once over.</p><p>“Yes, Professor, I’m ready to carry on.”</p><p>“With that injury, no way! You need the infirmary,” Albus protested, pointing suggestively at his foot and the very obvious way he couldn’t put any weight on it.</p><p>“And I’ll go after the match, I don’t need my feet to fly,” he raised his eyebrows in a smug look and Albus rolled his eyes. Madame Hooch was happy to watch the two boys’ bicker. She knew Scorpius and his stubborn ways, if he said he was getting back on that broom, there was no use in arguing. She had tried and failed many times before. The rest of their teams hovered stationary above them, waiting for the match to resume.</p><p>“And what about your ribs? That bludger hit you square on. They’re probably broken,” Albus protested again, going to lift Scorpius shirt to inspect his injuries. Scorpius grinned at him and rolled his eyes. He didn’t know why Albus cared so much, but after all he’s been through in the past week or so, it was nice that someone did.</p><p>“If you wanted to take my shirt off you could have just asked,” Scorpius said, playfully, winking at Albus. Albus shot him a deadly look and rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Fine, have it your way. But, don’t expect me to go easy on you just because you’re injured.”</p><p>“I would never expect that of you, Potter,” Scorpius smirked and picked up his broom with a groan. They both mounted, sending each other one last smirk before taking to the skies. The pause in the game meant the snitch was – once again – no where to be seen.</p><p>“And the match resumes – let’s hope the Slytherin team captain can keep his hands to himself, though word down the street is he’s never been able to,” Hugo announced happily, and the crowd reacted in laughter.</p><p>Word had got out about the reason for Scorpius’ and Nathan’s break-up, but mostly people played it off as a joke. Nathan never lost his reputation or popularity. However, Scorpius had. It came apparent at that moment that people only put up with Scorpius because of his relationship with the popular Quidditch captain and most people shunned him away once they broke-up. He lost his best friend, too, because George Zabini had been the one that Nathan cheated with. Overall, Scorpius became mostly friendless. He had a few people he spoke to and would maybe even sit with at dinner, but most he would never consider a friend. Most of the team – for obvious reasons – took Nathan’s side apart from a few who remained neutral. In the twelve days since the break-up, Scorpius found himself incredibly lonely.</p><p>Luckily for him, avoiding Nathan was easier than anticipated. He was a year older, so they had separate dorms and where Nathan favoured studying in the common room, Scorpius favoured the library. All in all, they only had to interact at Quidditch practice. Avoiding George was significantly harder – they shared a dorm and most their classes, they would often both study in the library and of course, there was training, too. Scorpius was trapped in a world of betrayal and heartache with no way to escape. So, he let himself drown in his misery.</p><p>A flash of gold flickered in the corner of his eye and he swerved the broom quickly to chase after it. Pain shot through his ribs at the sharp turn, but Scorpius ignored it in favour of chasing after the ball of flying gold. It came into view immediately following his manoeuvre, but of course, Albus was there, too. Scorpius drowned out the crowd and Hugo’s presenting and focused solely on the snitch.</p><p>Albus hadn’t been joking when he said he wouldn’t go easy on Scorpius. He flew swiftly through the wind at a pace slightly faster than Scorpius. They both blindly followed the snitch on the whirlwind it took them on, neither boys seemingly fast enough to catch it. It made rapid turns, one so sharp that the two seekers nearly flew into each other. The game was still in full swing, Gryffindor catching up a few points which meant now that Scorpius had to catch that snitch in order to win. If he didn’t, he’d be shunned out of the team for good.</p><p>Tired of playing the snitches game, Scorpius stopped and analysed his surroundings. Albus continued, not even taking notice of the other boy no longer following him. The snitch was heading rapidly for the stands, which meant that when it finally changed course, Albus would be thrown off for a split second to determine its direction. Scorpius had a one in four chance to guess that direction for a head start against him.</p><p>Scorpius started on his broom again, now quite the distance between him and Albus, and therefore the snitch. He ignored the shouts from his teammates directed at him. In his head, he had been analysing the flight patterns of the snitch, so far it had taken two lefts, three rights, one up followed swiftly by a down, then another left, up, right, down, left, down, right, left, right, up, down, left, left, left.</p><p>To anyone else, there seemed no obvious pattern. But, to Scorpius – who spent his entirety of third year analysing snitch flying patterns in order to train to get the spot as seeker in his fourth year – he knew exactly it’s plan. He caught up to Albus fairly quickly but kept a fair distance. The snitch went up, followed by Albus after a moment’s hesitation, but Scorpius went down. Sure enough, the snitch did exactly as he predicted, and made a quick nose-dive down and thankfully, straight into Scorpius’ hand.</p><p>“Malfoy has caught the snitch and Slytherin win! Not only this game, but their first house cup in nine years!” Hugo announced over the microphone, sounding happy despite his own team losing. The Slytherin crowd erupted into cheers as the rest of his team touched down to embrace boisterously, followed by the crowd entering the pitch. Albus floated down next to him, a dumbfounded look on his face. Scorpius grinned brightly at him, trying his best not to look smug as the snitch flew circles around his head.</p><p>“But- wh- how?” He stuttered. Scorpius had never seen <em>The</em> Albus Severus Potter stutter before. It only made this way more amusing.</p><p>“I can’t tell you my secret now, can I?” Scorpius teased.</p><p>“I knew you were brilliant but that was definitely cheating,” Albus teased backed. Scorpius scoffed, his mouth agape and he looked upon in disbelief at Albus.</p><p>“How dare you accuse me of cheating!” He exclaimed, trying – but failing – to keep the amusement from his tone. They shared a laugh as they descended to the grounds. Scorpius – momentarily forgetting his injuries – fell to the floor with a grunt when the pain shot through his leg as he dismounted his broom.</p><p>“Oh-woah, woah,” Albus spoke quickly, half catching Scorpius on his way down and pulling him back up. Albus wrapped his arm around Scorpius’ waist for support and Scorpius wrapped his own around Albus’ shoulders.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Don’t you want to get involved in that?” Albus asked, nodding towards the group of Slytherin’s that had now crowded around the team, chanting and cheering for their win.</p><p>“They haven’t even noticed I’m not there, I’m good. Plus, I always hated that part of the game, crowds make me anxious,” Scorpius bit his bottom lip and Albus turned his head to look at him, eyes boring holes into the side of his face.</p><p>“Slytherin wouldn’t have won if it weren’t for you,” he obviously pointed out. Scorpius shrugged, feeling tears beginning to sting in his eyes – and not just because of the pain his body was in.</p><p>“Albus!” The conversation was cut-short by Albus’ team heading over to them. The voice belonged to his cousin, Rose Granger-Weasley, one of Gryffindors beaters. Followed closely behind her was James Potter, the Gryffindor captain and chaser, then little Lily Potter, keeper and the rest of his team.</p><p>“What’re you doing?” James asked as they reached them. Albus and Scorpius came to a stop and Scorpius felt Albus’ hand clench against his waist slightly.</p><p>“Helping Scorpius, he’s injured,” they were never Scorpius and Albus usually, always Malfoy and Potter, just like their father’s had been. Though, he and Albus never had the same relationship as their fathers. They liked each other, for a start, despite being constantly pitted against each other for almost everything. Mostly, they played into the idea that they were supposed to hate each other, and their bickering was just banter, though to anyone else it seemed the two boys never got on. They both found it quite amusing.</p><p>However, something in their relationship had shifted since the night in the Astronomy Tower. Before, neither of the boys considered the other as a friend, but now they did. There was something about pouring your heart out to a stranger that connected you to them. They both needed a shoulder to cry on and that night they had each other. Neither would ever forget that, and both now knew that they would be there for each if they ever needed.</p><p>So, even though they were on separate sides of the pond, they found themselves drifting towards each other. Not in any way too drastic. Before they would pass in the halls without acknowledgement, now they shared a quick hello, or maybe a ‘how are you?’. In class, they shared glances which mostly involved them rolling their eyes then giggling because the only two classes they shared was History of Magic (boring) and Divination (a load of bullshit). So, yeah, it’s fair to say they were friends.</p><p>Though, Albus actually carrying him and risking the game for him, that was a new level they hadn’t quite reached before.</p><p>“I can’t believe you stopped to help him, we could have won!” James exclaimed and both Scorpius and Albus scoffed, though Scorpius’ was more discreetly.</p><p>“He needed help,” Albus defended at the same time Scorpius drawled, “how very Slytherin of you.” Lily let out an uncontrollable chuckle, but James was far from amused. His eyes shot to Scorpius, narrowed in disgust as they looked Scorpius up and down. If he was thinking that he could take Scorpius in a fight, then there was no doubt that he would win. Scorpius was never a fan of physical fights. He had never punched anyone in his life, favouring his wand over violence. Albus looked at him quite proudly, but also like Scorpius was on a death wish.</p><p>“What the fuck did you just say to me?” James spat, and Scorpius had to fight the urge to roll his eyes. James Potter didn’t scare him by any means. He knew James from prefect rounds and where the two never exactly got along, Scorpius did know that James never liked violence either.</p><p>“I said it’s very Slytherin of you. Stealing the win whilst the other players down, it’s cunning, shows your ambition to win and you crave the power that owning the cup would give you. Very Slytherin indeed, Potter,” Scorpius smiled smugly, narrowing his eyes at James the same way he did to Scorpius.</p><p>“Are you saying that’s what you would have done if the situation was reversed? You’re a Slytherin,” he stupidly pointed out. This time, Scorpius did roll his eyes.</p><p>“Oh, well spotted,” he commented snidely. “But no, I would have helped Albus, too.”</p><p>“Lay off it, James,” Albus finally input and James’ eyes snapped from Scorpius to Albus, his features softening slightly.</p><p>“Scorpius has a point, Jamie,” Lily sing-songed next to him and Scorpius found himself liking the youngest Potter. James and Lily started bickering back and forth, Rose occasionally interjecting.</p><p>“Here, let’s get you to the infirmary,” Albus spoke up, ignoring his siblings and cousin and going to guide Scorpius away from them.</p><p>“No, Albus, it’s fine. I can take myself.”</p><p>“Scorpius, you can barely walk, stop being so bloody proud.”</p><p>“Honestly Al-”</p><p>“Scorpius!” They were interrupted by Scorpius’ last remaining friend. Okay, she wasn’t really a friend before the break-up. He and Marley were on talking terms, she was one of the teams Chasers’, and they had the occasional conversation and would sometimes partner up on projects. But, she seemed to be the only person showing empathy towards him and the two had started hanging out a little bit more. He was thankful for her presence most the time, she made things less lonely. But, she couldn’t be there in the dead of the night when his thoughts ran rampage around his mind like his other friends had been. Still, he appreciated her.</p><p>“Hey, Marley,” he greeted.</p><p>“That was a nasty fall,” she commented. So, she had seen it and hadn’t bothered to help. At least Albus had. It only confirmed Scorpius’ theory that he had a heart of gold.</p><p>“I was just taking him to the hospital wing,” Albus butted in.</p><p>“I don’t mind taking you, it’s no trouble,” Marley replied, sweetly. Albus was hesitant until Scorpius squeezed his shoulder.</p><p>“It’s fine, Marley can take me, I don’t want to take time out of your day.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll swing by later then,” he said, untangling himself so Marley could take up his previous position. “Do you want me to take your broom?” He offered, holding his hand out. The brooms were taken to the house elves who gave them a clean and a polish before returning them to their respective owners. Usually Scorpius would do it himself – he was very precious about his broom – but, he’d never get around to it if Matron Abbot kept him in for the day.</p><p>“You don’t mind?” He asked, handing his broom over to Albus.</p><p>“’Course not, I’ve got to take mine anyway,” he smiled at him and Scorpius returned it.</p><p>“Thank you,” Albus nodded his head. Scorpius and Marley turned to walk away when Scorpius stopped her, turning back around in a moment of courage.</p><p>“Hey, Al…” every member of Albus’ family’s eyes were on him, Albus’ wide with curiosity, James’ narrowed with disgust, “bus,” he finished his name lamely. The moment of courage was whisked away with the wind and Scorpius was reminded why he was never sorted into Gryffindor. “There’s a party tonight,” he now addressed the whole group, hoping it wouldn’t seem so weird. “In the Slytherin common room, I assume you’ve already been invited because you usually are, but you should swing by,” he directed the last comment at Albus, keeping his eyes on him.</p><p>“Yeah, we will,” Albus replied lamely. James scoffed.</p><p>“Of course, we’re already invited, you losers always host the end of season party no matter who wins,” Scorpius fought down the urge to comment that they were the losers, given it was Slytherin who just won the match and therefore the cup. “Have to admit, it’s kind of sour now that you’ve won, and we lost, but we’ll dwell in our loss alongside your celebrations,” there was strange bite to James’ words that got lost the longer he spoke. Scorpius decided to ignore it.</p><p>“See you there,” he again directed this to Albus, who nodded and smiled. Scorpius turned away this time, following Marley to the infirmary where Matron Abbot proceeded to tell him that he had two broken ribs and a sprained ankle and scolded him repeatedly about playing out the rest of the game. Scorpius mostly drowned her out, thinking too much about what the night might bring.</p><p> </p><p>
