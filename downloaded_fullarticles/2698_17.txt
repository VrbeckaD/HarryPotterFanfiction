    <p>
  <span>Credence Barebone had died. But not really. Not properly. Had his mother been alive (had he not killed her) she would have scoffed at that. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Pathetic Credence, can’t even die properly. Useless boy. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Credence had died, but only a little. Enough of him was alive that recovery was possible, if not entirely wanted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything that happened, the real events that led to his almost-death, he would learn afterwards. Witches and Wizards called Aurors had attacked him, and in his fragile state as an Evil Dark Cloud Being (an </span>
  <em>
    <span>Obscurus </span>
  </em>
  <span>apparently) he had all but exploded. Sometimes he thought if they’d just put a little more effort in, they could have finished the job. But that was a dark way of thinking, and he tried not to let his mind wander there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the Goldstein sisters who had found him, taken him in and nursed him back to health. He’d been confused and disoriented the first few days he was there, but slowly his mind had returned to him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They told him what happened. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A wizard named Grindelwald had infiltrated Macusa, kidnapped and impersonated a high-ranking Auror and caused all kinds of havoc. He had manipulated Credence, and once Credence - and more importantly the Obscurus inside of him - had seemingly been destroyed, he had attacked. With the help of Newt Scamander (Tina said he had met him in the train station) and something called a </span>
  <em>
    <span>swooping evil, </span>
  </em>
  <span>they had managed to subdue Grindelwald and take him into custody. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As for the man whose face Grindelwald has taken, Percival Graves, Credence didn’t know him… the real him. Who he was. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Before.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He only ever knew the impostor, the fake with the stolen face and false but shiny words. The one who lied, tricked him, used him. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Truth be told, he hadn’t given much thought to the real man whose face Grindelwald had taken. Credence was the one who had been hurt, who had been manipulated and groomed. Who Percival Graves, the real Percival Graves, was… it was of little consequence to him. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Until they met, of course.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>Leaving the Goldstein sisters behind had been an easy to decision to make, and a difficult one to stick with. Credence needed to strike out on his own, figure out who he was and who he was going to be. But every night Credence spent on the streets, sleeping in abandoned buildings or homeless shelters or not sleeping at all, it became harder and harder to live with the choice he’d made. Hunger was not an unknown feeling to Credence. Besides the belt, starvation had been one of Mary-Lou’s very favourite punishments. But even when he’d had no food in his belly, he’d always had a roof over his head and clothes to keep him warm.</p><p>
  <span>Over the months he stayed on the street, he found that stealing was not quite the sin Mary-Lou had claimed it to be. Stealing food would keep him fed, stealing clothes would keep him warm. At first he was caught, more times than he could count. They’d chase after him, beat him and take back whatever he’d stolen. But after a while, he started getting good at it. Not being seen was always a talent of Credence’s. His ability to blend in, to be part of the background while people’s eyes slid over him as if he didn’t exist use to cause him pain. But now it was a blessing. He learned to move his hands quickly, to deftly take what was not his. After awhile he began to take from people as well. Watches, wallets, jewelry.. Anything he could get his hands on without being seen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every night, Credence lay awake, turning fitfully and trying not remember the things he’d done as the Obscurus. Killing Senator Shaw, killing Mary-Lou… and Chastity… he hadn’t meant to. He hadn’t wanted to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Deep down though, he wondered if he had. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since nearly dying, Credence had heard not a whisper of the dark thing which lived inside him. He knew it was there, somehow he could feel it stirring, waiting… but it stayed inside, and made no sound. He wondered how long he had before it came out again, how long it would before it burst from his skin and wreaked havoc on the world around him…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wondered how long it would before it killed him. For good this time.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the streets, huddled with others like him around a garbage can alight with flames, this is where he met Nicky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence had seen him around a few times before they were officially introduced. He often had a black eye, or cut lip or some other form of bruise or injury. Credence wondered why. When they met, in the official sense, Nicky explained it as being an “occupational hazard.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a while he always saw Nicky with a girl, a pretty and tall girl with long red hair and dark black eyes. He would come to learn her name had been Carol. After a while, he stopped seeing Carol hanging around. He would come to learn why that was, too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The night was cold, and Credence had yet to be able to find a place to hold up for the remainder of it. He was in the yard behind some building, where people without homes or places to go (people like him) came. He was trying to warm himself by the fire, when he heard an unfamiliar sound; laughter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking around, he found the source to be a tall, lanky boy with dirty sandy blonde hair that fell into his eyes. He knew this kid from around, but didn’t know his name. He’d taken notice of him because he looked to be around the same age as him. The kid was laughing, clutching a bottle that was covered in a brown paper bag. He took a swig from it, and giggled again, swaying slightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A burly man in a black overcoat approached the kid. “Where’d you get that from?” He asked, gesturing to the bottle in his hand. “You shouldn’t be drinking that out here."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another giggle, followed by a hiccup. “I gots my sources,” He said airily, ignoring the second part of the statement. “And it’s nunna your </span>
  <em>
    <span>business.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man glowered. “You better share the </span>
  <em>
    <span>sources </span>
  </em>
  <span>you got, or I might just have to drop a dime on you,” He threatened, taking a step closer. “Or worse.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taking another drink from the bottle of what Credence could only assume was alcohol, the kid smiled. “Slow down there, big guy. I’m not gonna tell you were I got the gigglewater from, but for a tenner I could find some other way to make you happy,” He attempted to finish the statement with a wink, but it just sort of appeared as if he closed both his eyes and then opened them again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence stopped pretending he wasn’t watching now, as did several others around him. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What </span>
  </em>
  <span>did he just say?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t seem to be the only one having a hard time comprehending that statement. “The </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck </span>
  </em>
  <span>you say to me?” The man growled, closing in on the other guy. He pressed him back up against the fence behind him and grabbed the front of his shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence could see concern on the younger man’s face, but perhaps he was too drunk to fully comprehend how much trouble he’d gotten himself in. He took another swig from his drink, and slurred a response Credence couldn't understand. Whatever it was he said, it only seemed to make the man harassing him even more furious. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You goddamn faggot...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Far away, Credence heard a police siren. A few other people looked like they heard it too, but no one moved. Credence knew the arrival of a patrol vehicle was enough to scatter everyone, but this one didn’t sound like it would be approaching anytime soon. Credence cleared his throat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heat’s coming, scram out if you don’t wanna get nailed!” He shouted, trying to stir up panic. The siren sounded again, and even if it sounded far away, Credence’s cry had worked: everyone ran. Reluctantly, the larger man let the other go, glaring at him for a last moment before he too turned tail and ran out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The younger man let out a breath, watching as his attacker ran off. “Yeah, ‘ats right, go chase yourself!” He shouted after him. Fortunately, he seemed to be too far away to hear. He grinned drunkenly. After a moment, he noticed Credence, the only other person left in the yard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Staring at him with a deeply concentrated look, after a few more moments had passed he asked “You do that on purpose?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guy frowned. He was quiet again. Then, a smile. Stumbling over to where Credence stood, the guy clapped a hand on his shoulder. “You know what, you’re alright, kiddo.” He took a long drink, and then hiccuped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence looked him over, and wondered what would happen if he left him on his own tonight. Nothing good, he was sure. The kid was ossified. “You got a place?” He asked quietly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another goofy grin spread across his face. “You big flirt!” He giggled. “I do, but it’ll cost ya’.” He looked Credence over, and Credence felt his face heat up. He tried to stutter a protest, but the guy cut him off. “Oh alright, I’ll throw you a bone for scattering that creep.” Another drink. “C’mon, let’s blouse.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He began to saunter out of the yard, swaying from side to side. Credence followed, and took hold of his arm to steady him when he almost fell over. Hiccuping again, the guy looked up at Credence with a dazed expression. “I’m Nicky, by the way,” He said, before vomiting on Credence’s shoes. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>It took a long time to get back to the place where Nicky was staying, mostly because he was too drunk to give proper directions. It was late when they finally found the place, in a not-so-good part of town that he had never been in before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The place Nicky took him too was a tall, somewhat dilapidated building tucked so thoroughly into a corner of the street that if Nicky hadn’t pointed it out, Credence doubted he would have seen it.  The sign on the front read in peeling letters “Hannigan’s ----” whatever the second word had been, it was long since faded away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a bit for Nicky to convince Credence this was the place, but only because this was the third building they’d been too that night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Trus’ me, Creedo,” Nicky slurred, leading him by the hand into Hannigan’s. “Behind these doors is e’erything you want.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence very much doubted that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inside, Hannigan’s was even less pretty than its exterior. The room was dimly lit and mostly empty, save for a few shelves of useless knick-knacks on the wall. There was a counter at the back. The lady sitting behind it was asleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe we should leave,” Credence said, feeling oddly nervous. It had been a mistake in the first place, to get so involved in this as he was. What had he been thinking? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky had other ideas. “Ey, Maureen,” Nicky shouted, slapping the counter near the sleeping lady. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maureen jumped, and looked around wildly for a moment before her eyes landed on Nicky. “Oh, it’s you,” She muttered, straightening the wig she was wearing. “Felt like givin’ me an attack, didja?” Shaking her head, she took a key and went to a door behind her marked </span>
  <em>
    <span>BROOMS AND MOPS</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She opened it and gestured for them to go inside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tipping an imaginary hat to Maureen in </span>
  <em>
    <span>thank you, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Nicky sauntered through the mop closet. After a moment, Credence followed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the night he’d had, Credence was only somewhat surprised to find himself in a speakeasy, and not a mop closet. Despite the lateness of the hour, the party going on inside Hannigan’s was in full swing. People danced and music played, and behind the bar a young man with an attractive freckled face slung drinks out with a smile. The place was brightly lit, which Credence found odd. He would have thought a criminal establishment would have been dimmer. But he supposed if the police raided the place, low-lighting wasn’t going to save anybody. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky went right up to the bartender. “Big C!” He called, getting the bartender's attention. The man came over, his smiling slipping as he looked at Nicky. “I got someone I want you to meet.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man’s eyes slip from Nicky to Credence. He frowned. “Has he been like this all night?” He asked. There was worry in his voice. Credence nodded and the man shook his head. “Nick...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Clyde, this is Credence,” Nicky went on, ignoring Clyde’s obvious disdain for his inebriation. “He’s my new beau, and we’re going up to my room to fuck all night,” He said. Clyde raised an eyebrow at this, and Credence’s face turned pink. He thought he’d been getting used to such things -- Nicky had been going on in a similar fashion all night -- but hearing it said in front of someone else was different. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I -- I don’t, I’m not...” Credence stuttered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clyde raised a hand. “Credence, thank you for bringing this drunken fairy home,” He said. Nicky blew a raspberry. “Nicky, go sleep this off and we’ll talk about the booze you nicked tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky seemed likely to protest, but Clyde raised an eyebrow and the younger man sighed. “Fine fine. I’m going.” He turned and left, waving airily at them as he went. Clyde watched after him. “He didn’t get into any trouble, did he?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence swallowed. “There was… a man. He tried to uh…. Nicky sort of...” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clyde seemed to understand what he was saying. “Did the guy get violent? Did you see what he looked like?” He asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence shook his head. “It didn’t get that far. The cops were close, so the guy scattered.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking relieved, Clyde let out a breath. “Good, that’s good. First time in a while lady luck’s paid a visit to Nicky. Usually the guy pops him a few times before he can get away.” He sounded bitter. “Thank you… Credence, was it?” Credence nodded. “Thanks for bringing him home.” Turning behind him, Clyde pulled out a glass and began filling it with alcohol. “Here, on the house.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He almost refused, but why the hell not? Who was he to turn down something free when it was offered to him. The glass was cool under his palm, and Credence sipped the drink slowly. He coughed, and sputtered. It tasted terrible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clyde laughed. “Not much of a drinker, huh?” He asked. Credence shook his head. “Well, I won’t be offended if you can’t finish it. Not everyone takes to it like Nick.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Smacking his lips, and trying to get rid of the burning taste on his tongue, Credence looked at Clyde. “Is he…. I mean, does he...” He wasn’t sure how to phrase what he was asking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean is he a homosexual, or a prostitute?” Clyde asked. Credence blinked. “Yes to both, is your answer.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Was all he could say. He had met a few prostitutes before, living on the streets, but they had all been women. For a lack of anything else to say, he took another drink. It was still terrible. “Are you…. ?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clyde raised an eyebrow. “Which one?” He asked. Credence shrugged. “I’m not a prostitute,” He said, smirking. Credence realized how very rude the question had been. “As for a homosexual… not exactly. I guess I’m not too particular.” He said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence wondered what that meant. He raised his glass to his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And yourself?” Clyde asked, leaning forward on the counter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence choked on his drink. He didn’t answer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me see… I doubt you would have been so shocked to learn about Nicky, if you were in the same occupation yourself… so I think we can rule that out.” He said slowly, looking Credence over. “But the other bit… it’s hard to say. Why does something make me think you’re not even sure yourself?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps it was the drink, or the scrutiny, but Credence’s entire face and neck were burning steadily now. He pulled at his collar by way of answer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about it,” Clyde said, pulling down two more glasses for a few customers who had just walked up. “Spend enough time around Nicky and he’ll help you figure it out.” He filled their glasses and slid them down the bar, where they left their change. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clyde collected the change and deposited it in a register. He went back to Credence, and leaned in again. “Although I might be tempted to help you myself,” He said, winking. Credence gripped the stool he sat on, sure he was about the fall over. Clyde grinned at him, apparently enjoying the effect his words had. “You’re alright, Credence.” He said. “You’re alright.” </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Hannigan’s, it turned out, was more than just a typical speakeasy. It was also a hotel, albeit a fairly small one. They had two floors of rooms in the back, the bottom floor being for </span>
  <em>
    <span>staff </span>
  </em>
  <span>(Clyde said this mostly meant him and Nicky) and the top being for paying customers. Usually people only stayed for a night or so, when they didn’t want to be out drunk. Clyde said Credence was welcome to stay as long as wanted, as long as he was willing to work for his room and board. Credence was more than willing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, this is the room, you’ll be staying in,” Clyde said, unlocking the door to room 03. “You’re two doors down from Nicky, four down from me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence nodded, looking around. The hotel area of Hannigan’s was clean, but not exactly what he would call luxury. The wall paper was peeling, and the lights flickered in the hallway. Down at the end of the hall, Credence noticed a door open. Credence peered at the open door, trying to decide if he thought he saw someone staring out at him. The door slammed abruptly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here you go,” Clyde opened the door, and Credence stepped inside. The room may have been small, but it was hard for Credence to say. It was bigger than the room he’d had with Mary-Lou, and about a hundred times better than anything he’d found on the streets. It was clean, and warm and there was a fresh set of linens on the bed. He may as well have found heaven. “Hope it’s alright. We don’t have a turn down service or anything, so you’ll have to make the bed yourself. Carol used to help with that sort of thing but...” Clyde trailed off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s Carol?” Credence asked, stepping into the room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a look of hesitation on Clyde’s face. “She was… she used to work here. Did a bit of everything, I guess. She was like Nicky, you know, a working girl… those two were close as anything.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence remembered the red haired girl he used to see Nicky around with. He didn’t think he’d seen her for a while. “What happened to her?” He asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clyde wouldn’t meet his eyes when he answered. “Don’t know, really. Ran off with some john, I guess….” He ran his fingers through his dark hair. “Real shame though. Nicky misses her. He’s been really hitting the booze after she left.” Clyde looked up. “Anything else you need?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence paused. “Who’s staying at the end of the hall?” He asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, you ask a lot of questions, eh?” Clyde remarked. He chuckled nervously. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence waited. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clyde sighed. “Officially, no one is staying down there. But if he’s gonna keep poking his head out…. Just don’t bother him, ok? And I ever send you up to him with a drink, don’t make small talk. Just give him the booze and move on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That all?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence nodded again. Clyde looked relieved. “Alright. You start work early tomorrow, so get some sleep. There’s a toothbrush in the bathroom, and soap in the shower. If you need anything, I’m down the hall to the left.” He cast one more glance at Credence, before depositing the key on the dresser. Then he shut the door behind him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly feeling light headed and dazed, Credence took a seat on the edge of his bed and marveled at how things could change to drastically in one night. In a matter of hours, he’d gone from having no one and nothing, to a place to sleep and a job. It didn’t feel like a hand out either, like staying with Queenie and Tina. Clyde didn’t want to coddle or heal him, he just needed a job done and Credence was a person who could do it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Getting ready for bed that night, Credence thought about what Clyde had asked him about himself, and how he’d been unable to answer. Mary-Lou has always said it was a grave, burn-in-hell forever kind of sin, but Mary-Lou had been crazy. And the way Clyde and Nicky talked about it, it was like it was hardly even a big deal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Credence knew most people outside of Hannigan’s would be more inclined to side with Mary-Lou, but inside… perhaps Credence had found a place where he could finally be himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whoever that was. </span>
</p>
