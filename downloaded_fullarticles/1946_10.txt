    <p align="justify">It was New Year’s eve in an old large and handsome manor surrounded by elaborate gardens which would have made the former kings of Versailles blush in envy, in the middle of large dark woods in Wiltshire. The gardens were comprised by an intricate Victorian maze containing a magnificent fountain in the middle, a small lake partly surrounded by old thick oak trees, a rose garden with a small white pavilion in between and several English garden fields. Each section of the vast gardens was separated by large green hedges. As it was New Year’s Eve nature seemed to have remembered, that it should be winter and within several hours the gardens were transformed into a beautiful wintery landscape with snow covering everything. The only path not covered in snow was the large gravel driveway leading towards the manor house whose windows shown like diamonds through the thick, slow snowfall. The driveway was illuminated by countless white flowing candles in the form of snowflakes. Inside the manor busy house elves were buzzing around for last minute preparations before the arrival of the guests who were invited to the annual Malfoy Ball to celebrate the Beginning of the New Year. The hostess Narcissa Malfoy was known for her lavish Balls, tastes and creativity as people tended to talk for month about them.</p><p align="justify">But at this very moment the hostess was close to panicking because of her stubborn daughter. The guests were due to arrive any minute and her son had just told them that Cassandra, his twin sister had decided that she would ditch the ball this year and unfortunately she was unable to find her. Lucius was not in his best of moods after he had heard that.</p><p align="justify">She had first looked for her in her room, but had only detected her daughter’s newly bought, very expensive pink dress shredded to pieces. Apparently when she had said she hated the colour she had meant it. Which girl did not like the colour pink? Thankfully she had been able to mend it with a few swishes of her wand. The girl was also not in the kitchens which she loved very much. Something that neither Narcissa nor Lucius could understand. Malfoys did never go to the kitchen. It was the workplace of the house elves who adored her and it seemed that she did the same.  She hoped that she would find the strong willed little girl in the vast library which was a small maze on its own, but the little girl of five years already knew every inch of it. She could not blame her daughter for finding refuge in the library, but to her shock the little girl had been able to read at age three. Lucius personal house elf Dobby had apparently taught her. Lucius, not believing that his daughter was able to read had randomly pulled books out of the library and looked for passages for her to read and she had been able to do it perfectly. Another house elf Dilly had taught her how to write. How the house elves were even able to read and write was beyond her. The Black house elves had never been able to do this. Her husband however seemed to prefer their son Draco over his daughter, but Narcissa knew him well enough to know that he had no idea how to handle a girl as there have not been any siblings for generations of Malfoys and his daughter was already quite strange, even for a magical child. There had always been a son, never a girl and he was the first Malfoy in a very long time who had both. Unfortunately Cassandra had long given up getting her father’s attention and found refuge in the library. But now was not the time to hide in the library. There, in the armchair near the lit fireplace she could spot her blond daughter cuddled contently in between the armrests in a green blanket engrossed in a thick book. It looked as if she would become a Rawenclaw one day widening the rift towards her father. She even tended to correct the other woman in Narcissa’s Tea Circle, when they mentioned wrong dates.</p><p align="justify">“You are supposed to be ready for greeting the guests in the entrance hall!” Narcissa scolded her daughter who jumped at her harsh tone.</p><p align="justify">“I am not going!” she answered folding her arms to get her obdurate refusal across. “There will be too many people, I don’t want to know about and I know that something bad is going to happen tonight.”</p><p align="justify">“Nothing bad is going to happen, Cassandra.” Narcissa said sitting down on the left cushy armrest and stroking her daughter’s fine hair.</p><p align="justify">“It’s New Year’s eve. Everyone will have a good time. Pansy, Astoria and Daphne will be here in a few minutes. “Her daughter rolled her eyes at her mentioning the three girls. “Don’t you want to play with them?”.   Cassandra shook her head at that.</p><p align="justify">But she saw that no matter what she said for trying to convince her daughter she would remain stubborn.  With the book on her lap and her arms crossed she stubbornly looked into the fire. <em>Is that Latin? </em> Narcissa thought surprised.</p><p align="justify"> “No. I don’t like them. They are stupid and can’t even read yet.”</p><p align="justify">Chuckling Narcissa argued for one last time:”Normal schooling begins for children at age six, darling. Your brother started a year earlier because he was jealous about your tutoring.” Patting her daughter, who rolled her eyes again at the mentioning of her ten minutes elder brother, reassuringly on the shoulder she stood up again. “Come on. Let’s get you ready.”</p><p align="justify">But her daughter seemed to disappear further in the armchair, if that was even possible. “I don’t want to go. Please. Don’t make me mother! There are too many people and father seems to favour the dark ones.” Narcissa’s eyes widened at her surprise. Her daughter was a sharp one. How did she know that his friends were Deatheaters who had been able to avoid Askaban? Had she overheard them somewhere?</p><p align="justify">“Please. Something terrible is going to happen. I just know it. I can’t explain it. Please mother. Don’t make me do this.” her daughter repeated again with a wavering voice.</p><p align="justify">“Cassandra Persephone Malfoy!” the snarling voice of Lucius came from the dark entry of the library before her father stepped into the light. “You have two minutes to get out of the library, to get ready for the ball and to get down to the entry hall. Otherwise you will be very sorry.”</p><p align="justify">Cassandra’s heart was beating faster. Her father was a terrifying man and the very image of her cold hearted grandfather. He had never beaten her or used his cane, but he looked so much like her grandfather, who had no qualms about using his. She remembered the day her father had found out about her grandfather beating “some sense into her”. The anger and magic between them had been palatable. Especially, as grandfather had called her father a weakling. She knew her father would never hurt her like that, but her fear of him remained. But why could they not understand that something terrible was about to happen? She had had dreams repeatedly telling her of pain surrounded by ballroom dance music and her feeling was that it was about to happen today. Dobby had called them visions, but when she had mentioned it to her parents for the first time she had been told that they were just dreams. Apparently they had forgotten what she had told them. She could not go! But how could she persuade her stubborn parents? Unfortunately she was contrary to her brother a very healthy child and had tried everything the days before to get sick. She had swum in the freezing lake for a few minutes and dragged herself back to the manor with clattering teeth, had eaten several garlic sprouts and had slept with her window open at night, only to find it closed in the morning. And she had not gotten sick. Simulating would not help, but she would try.</p><p align="justify">“I am not feeling well.” she said pulling the blanket closer to her chin. Technically it wasn’t a lie. She was feeling horrible at dreading that something was about to happen.  Her mother checked her front with her right hand and shook her head. “You are really trying everything to avoid going down to the ball. No fever Lucius.”</p><p align="justify">“Screams, Pain and Waltz music are going to happen today. I know it!” Cassandra screamed to get her point across. “Please. I can’t go!” Her eyes glistened with unshed tears.  Narcissa was close to give in she could feel it, even her father was hesitating, but caught himself again.</p><p align="justify">“Stop being so melodramatic and get ready! Or you will regret it.” he hissed taking his wand out of his cane and with one flick the blanket vanished and the book landed in his pale hand to the dismay of his protesting daughter.</p><p align="justify">“Dilly!” he called and a small, grey house elf with big floppy ears appeared dutifully beside the two parents. “Get my daughter ready as fast as you can and bring her down to the entrance hall. All her orders to you are void for the moment.” he ordered.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, Master.” Dilly squeaked taking her young mistress hand aparating her back to her room.</p><p align="justify">The distressed house elf mumbling “Sorry, Mistress.” just snapped her fingers twice and Cassandra was in her new pink dress. She abhorred that colour and could not understand why her parents insisted on buying her dresses in this colour. Her mother had repaired it apparently or was it one of the house elves. The little elf snapped her fingers twice more and Cassandra was ready. Could she order Dilly to get her away? No. Her father was the head of the house and his order would override hers. Why prepare for a ball if house elves could get one ready so fast.</p><p align="justify">As she blinked again she stood in the ballroom in front of her father and gulped. There were several people already in the Ballroom. Her abhorred grandparents were one of the people present. <em>One more reason to leave the ball immediately</em> she thought.</p><p align="justify">Time passed the family greeted every one of the arriving guests personally, pleasantries were exchanged but to Cassandra it was just dumb and extremely boring talk. But her parents just loved to stand on ceremony. Her time would be better spent reading the Aeneid further. They had interrupted her when Aeneas had finally arrived in his destined country Italy.  She wanted to know how the story would continue. Instead she had to spend listening to grown-ups talk about the weather, the decorations, dresses, business and other boring stuff. She hated it. Especially as she sensed that quite some of their guests could not stand her parents at all, but acted as if they did. Beside her Draco seemed to be equally bored, but he was better at hiding it standing in front of her mother.  Her gaze strayed often to the groups of talking people in the room and around the opulent buffet and started to ignore the guests until she felt her father’s big right hand tapping on her shoulder to remind her to behave properly. There were so many people in the large room but for her it still felt as if she would suffocate. She could feel every single one of them, her brother standing next to her and her parents behind her. Her father felt strangely similar to some of the guests and all of those were people who made her neck hairs standing straight. They were trouble. Some felt foul and Cassandra was nauseated at their presence. All she wanted to do was to grab some chocolate tarts before Grabbe and Goyle, Draco’s best friends, could get their sticky fingers on them and get back to the safety of the library and away from the danger of the ominous feeling that something terrible would happen. She started to squirm again and pondered how she could slip away unnoticed under her father’s watchful gaze.</p><p align="justify">Finally her father addressed the guests in the ballroom and welcomed them in his humble home. Cassandra snorted at that. She had seen a few manors, but none came even close to theirs. He asked everyone to enjoy themselves and greet the New Year in a few hours. After his speech Cassandra pulled at her father’s robes and carefully asked:</p><p align="justify">“Father. We greeted the guests. You had your speech. Now can I be excused? Please?” She tried using her puppy eyes look which always worked on her mother but unfortunately he was not amused at her persistence.</p><p align="justify">“Cassandra I do not know what’s gotten into you, but you will stay in this room. Narcissa, make her play with some of the other girls.” he ordered his wife looking after Draco who was chasing after Grabbe and Goyle. Narcissa, dutifully took her hand and led her towards a group of small girls and Cassandra groaned. Pansy, Daphne and Astoria. All dressed in hideous variations of pink.</p><p align="justify">“The room is so beautiful!” Pansy gushed at the white, silver and golden arrangements in the room. Daphne and Astoria nodded affirming to a shrugging Cassandra who wrecked her brain how to get rid of them. From the ceiling hung hundreds of icicles changing colours in a heartbeat, white, lilac, golden and silver garlands interwoven with different kinds of evergreens hung squarely under the icicles. The tablecloths were golden with intricate patterns and silver plates and cutlery.  Finally she got an idea and smirked dangerously.</p><p align="justify">“Do you want to play a game?” she asked innocently with a higher pitched voice than normal. The other girls nodded happily.</p><p align="justify">“We could play aurors and thieves! The boys could play the aurors and us the beautiful thieves they have to catch.” Daphne suggested, but Cassandra shook her head.</p><p align="justify">“There’s no way father will allow that with that many guests in the room. Remember what happened last time. What about hide and seek. You hide and I will search for you. If I haven’t found you until midnight you’ll get a chocolate cake each to take home.”</p><p align="justify">“But mother does not let me eat chocolate cake. She says it can make me fat.” Pansy whined.</p><p align="justify">“She doesn’t need to know about it.” Cassandra suggested whispering and Pansy smiled happily and nodded.</p><p align="justify">“Alright I count to hundred and you hide.” she said, covered her eyes and started counting while she felt the other girls speed away. After counting no further than twenty she stooped, looked around, put her hands behind her back and ambled towards the buffet while hoping her parents would not spot her without the other girls. She finally made it to the chocolate tarts, grabbed some and used the guests as covers to slip past her parents out of the ballroom towards her sanctuary.</p><p align="justify">Hours passed and Lucius enjoyed being the centre of the attention, showing off his superior dancing skills with his beautiful wife. Once in a while he looked for his children and while he could spot Draco making shenanigans with his two other companions and playing with the Nott boy, the girls seemed to have disappeared completely. Have they gone to Cassandra’s room, or had his daughter played mischief on them? He feared the latter as she had been quite adamant to get away from the ball.</p><p align="justify">“Lucius have you seen Cassandra?” Narcissa whispered coming over to him from talking to the minister’s wife and he shook his head.</p><p align="justify">“Dobby.” he whispered calling discreetly for his personal house elf who appeared the next second. “Do you know where the girls are?”  The grey little elf nodded hiding a grin.</p><p align="justify">“Miss Pansy is hiding in a cupboard in the kitchen, Miss Daphne is hidden behind the curtains in the parlour, Miss Storia is hiding under Misses Cassandra’s bed.”</p><p align="justify">“And where is my daughter?” Lucius asked with deep voice which had a dangerous edge to it. Dobby bit his lower lip and squirmed under his master’s gaze. “Tell me.”</p><p align="justify">“Miss Cassandra is in the library reading.” Dobby stated while Narcissa snorted amused and Lucius Malfoy sighed and shook his head and coughed to hide his grin. Maybe his daughter was Slytherin material after all. Nevertheless, Midnight was approaching fast and Cassandra would not escape greeting the New Year with them in the Ballroom.</p><p align="justify">“I go and fetch her” Lucius whispered into Narcissa’s ear. He should be angry at her for disobeying him, but she was a child after all and maybe he had been a bit too harsh with her earlier. “Dobby, get the other girls to their parents.” he ordered.</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em>hoc dicens ferrum aduerso sub pectore condit               </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>feruidus; ast illi soluuntur frigore membra</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>uitaque cum gemitu fugit indignata sub umbras.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Cassandra gasped horrified at what she had read and checked the fragile binding for further pages. But there weren’t any missing! How could this be? This story could not end like this! Aeneas, the hero had killed Turnus, his opponent, after all the heroic deeds that he had done! This was a stark contrast to the phrase <em>parcere subiectis et debellare superbos</em> from the sixth book. The Olympic gods could not approve of this! There had to be more to this.</p><p align="justify">“Why did you leave the ball girl?” her grandfather snarled while stepping into the soft light cast by coming from the fireplace. Cassandra shrieked in panic and snapped her book closed. Her grandfather looked like an older version of her father, having the same aristocratic features, his hair blond turning white but he felt foul, like the some of the other people in the ballroom. He was pure evil for her and for whatever reason he hated her.</p><p align="justify">Her gaze darted around in the room for an escape route. She was alone in the library with her scary grandfather and nobody would hear her. Would he teach her a lesson by using the cruciatus as he had often threatened to do?  “I was…” she began but her voice was barely audible because of her sudden dry throat.</p><p align="justify">“You were doing what?” her grandfather took another step and Cassandra felt danger. Every fiber in her body was alert and she seemed to be aware of it in a very strange way. He took one more step and she was about to jump out of the armchair when she heard a different voice and breathed in relieved. She had never been so glad to hear her father’s voice.</p><p align="justify">“What is going on in here?” he asked his father and while positioning himself protectively between his daughter and his father.</p><p align="justify">“She disobeyed your orders, son and left the ball.” her grandfather informed her father. “She needs to be thought a lesson for her shameful behaviour. “</p><p align="justify">“The only one punishing my daughter for her behaviour is me or my wife, father.” her father spat straightening his stance angrily. “Not you. Her education is <strong>not</strong> your duty”.</p><p align="justify">Turning to Cassandra he took her right hand with his left and led her out of the dark library, before his father could come back with some snarky remark about how he was not man enough to lead his own family or the Malfoy estate.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry father. But the ball was so boring and the people really unpleasant.” Cassandra apologized.</p><p align="justify">“You disobeyed my orders, Cassandra and whether you like it or not, but you will greet the New Year with us in the Ballroom. It’s your punishment.” her father answered drily dragging her through the Ballroom door towards his wife, who seemed to be looking for their son. There was a crowd of people, but they were not dancing. What had he missed?  Suddenly Cassandra’s heart stopped a beat and panic set in again startling her father who wondered why she had stopped. The feeling of suffocation was surrounding her again, she could hear a very familiar sounding waltz and she stopped in her tracks. It was about to happen! She tried to wriggle free of her father’s grasp, with gathering tears in eyes. But he would not let go as he looked confused at her.</p><p align="justify">“No. It’s happening, it’s happening now.” she whispered trying desperately pulling towards the entry.</p><p align="justify">Finally realized what was hidden behind the crowed as he spotted different kinds of lights popping up and curses shouted. Someone was duelling in his Ballroom! Without letting go of his daughter he pressed himself past the witches and wizards in the crowd and spotted a very drunken Nott Sr. and an equally drunken Goyle Sr. hurling curses at each other. All the front-row spectators had their wands in their hands to conjure basic shielding charms but nobody had the sense of stopping the two.  They probably expected him as the host to break up their drunken brawl unworthy of purebloods.</p><p align="justify">He finally let go of his daughter who seemed to have problems breathing, was ghostly pale and looked close to fainting and took out his wand as the curses seemed to get darker. Cassandra was about to dart away from danger when she suddenly stopped in her tracks again and looked around. Looking between the two duellists he waited for the opportune moment to go in between the fighting without hurting himself or someone from the crowed. He shot a canon imitating spell to get both of their intension, but only people from the crowd jumped; Nott and Goyle Sr. did not react to this. That the two duellists where still able to cast spells in their inhibited states was a miracle. Finally he decided that he had no other choice and called: “Incarcerus!” and shot chains at them, but unfortunately one of the two duellists was able to cast one more curse while being pinned down by heavy chains, which proved to be severe.</p><p align="justify">Cassandra was feeling the overwhelming dread; there was pressure in her chest keeping her from breathing properly. Her pulse racing in throat and she heard the familiar Waltz oddly distorted but still being played, yet it seemed as if the volume had intensified tenfold and she wanted to run out of danger as soon as possible but something was holding her back. The people were moving in unnatural slowness.  She knew she could not leave but she wanted to. Pain would be felt by someone soon. She saw chains from her father’s wand shot at the two men and she spotted her brother standing happily in the front row, but there was something moving towards him. Something her father had missed.  Draco had no shield! Why did nobody shield him?!  She saw the ray of the curse slowly moving towards her brother and suddenly she felt an unfamiliar tug at her navel and she was standing right next to her brother and pushed him out of the way.</p><p align="justify">A heartbeat later something hit her straight in the face and she was knocked down. Every fibre in her body was alight in pain and fire as the fire was racing up and down her body and the feeling as if thousand knives where stabbing her repeatedly, causing her to spasm uncontrollably and she just wanted the pain to stop. From far away she could hear an angry roar, shocked gasps and the mockingly slow waltz. Her eyes were also on fire as if they were boiling, her sight became fussy, blackness was closing in on her from the edges of her gaze and she knew no more.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Far away on a planet consisting of one single city with many different levels, the little green Grandmaster of the Jedi Order was violently roused from his meditation in the room of thousand fountains. He had heard the desperate mental cry of a Force sensitive child and felt her horrible amount of pain. This was disturbing. Through his high Midi-chlorean count he was able to sense many Jedi many systems away, but feeling Younglings he had never met before was considerably harder, yet not impossible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>
