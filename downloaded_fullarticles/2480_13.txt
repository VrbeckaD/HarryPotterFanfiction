    <p>
  <em>
    <span>Something’s wrong.</span>
  </em>
  <span> The realisation was similar to the pressure drop in the air right before a storm. Tension had already spread through the castle due to the advancement of Grindelwald, but that was shared, non-specific. Polymela was sure she alone felt this particular dread. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For one thing, she’d had it before. It had been rearing its ugly head on and off for a fortnight—since the start of 1945. She couldn’t pinpoint how it came about. There had to be some sort of catalyst but she could not recall—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nott, for Merlin’s sake,” James Dorsey grumbled, holding a jar of Bicorn Horn powder. “Will you help or just stand there?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His arch nemesis, who happened to be at the table ahead of them, turned around and said, “Oi, Dorsey, where’s your manners, you knobby brute?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up, McLaggen—” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gentlemen, settle down,” Professor Slughorn called from the front of the room, where he was attempting to fix the disaster in Bruin Weasley’s cauldron. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without a word, Polymela took the jar from Dorsey and added a couple pinches of the powder until their Pepperup Potion turned a bright orange. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s supposed to be more of a rust,” Dorsey informed her frostily. “I can see you’re not planning on going to NEWT level.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oi, Dorsey,” called Felix Murdoch from the Slytherin side. “Why don’t you keep that smarmy trap shut for ten minutes?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dorsey scowled and turned away while Polymela sent a grateful look Murdoch’s way. He and his partner, Alphard Black, were quite tolerable for Slytherin boys, but the one at the table in front of them, Icarus Yaxley, was a different story. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blonde, freckled, and wealthy, Yaxley was, in sum, the typical, obnoxious, Sacred 28-descended prat. However, he left most of the Gryffindors alone, so Polymela hadn’t much contact with him. Except now he was giving her an odd leer, like she was his entertainment for the afternoon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like what you see, Nott?” he asked quietly. She quickly turned away, feeling her cheeks flush, betraying her discomfort. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On her other side, Dorsey glared at her as if she was the one to draw attention to herself. “Give me that, please,” she hissed, snatching his copy of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Advanced Potion Making</span>
  </em>
  <span> out of his hands even though her own was in her bag draped across the stool. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm, we need to add the mandrake root,” she mumbled, scanning the table and seeing they didn’t have it. Since Dorsey didn’t move, she added, “I’ll go get it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she pulled a root from the crate next to Slughorn’s desk, her blood ran cold again, the dread intensifying. It was here, waiting in the queue in the beginning of the lesson, where it had started before. She’d been standing behind Yaxley, his fancy French cologne in her nose, and out of nowhere, her heart had kicked up, but why? Yaxley hadn’t leered at her then, hadn’t even looked her way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clutching the mandrake root tighter than necessary, Polymela shook her head and walked back to the cauldron. She couldn’t understand what the big fuss was about. </span>
  <em>
    <span>They’re connected</span>
  </em>
  <span>, a voice deep in her head said as she set the root on the chopping block. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What</span>
  </em>
  <span> was connected? No answer for that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I sure hope you had some grand epiphany over there,” Dorsey sniped as she began chopping, “because we’re not likely to finish.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned out to be right, but it didn’t matter since 25 of the best brewing pair’s awarded 50 points went to Gryffindor, due to one of them being Emmeline Arnold. Her partner, a Slytherin prefect by the name of Harper Messier, was the brightest in their year, the likely reason the pair received the points. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course it’s Messier,” Beatrice Winter grumbled to Ignatius Prewett. “Why even bother with her around?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re just as bright,” Dorsey insisted. “Slughorn favors her is all. Slytherins are so biased.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Polymela wanted to point out that Emmeline Arnold was in their house; thus, there was a flaw in the theory. But she knew her housemates wouldn’t listen to her. They hardly considered her a house mate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thankfully, the anxiety subsided in the Great Hall, especially once Polymela sat down facing away from the Slytherin table. On the way to Herbology it almost faded entirely, and by the end of lessons, it didn’t plague her at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After completing her homework, her plan for the evening was to curl up in bed and read the newest book her grandmother had sent: </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Phoenix Flies at Midnight.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Polymela was happy to read of anything not concerning Gellert Grindelwald, since that’s all The Daily Prophet wrote about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, that plan was halted upon stepping foot in the common room and discovering that Beatrice Winter had formed an anti-Grindelwald congregation of students strewn across sofas and seated on the floor. “If he makes us pin that bloody triangle to our robes,” Antonia Longbottom of Ravenclaw was declaring from one of the armchairs, “we shall turn them upside down as a subtle expression of defiance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hear, hear,” called Ignatius Prewett, while the rest of the group, which consisted of all Houses except Slytherin, clapped and nodded along. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Polymela crept to the dormitory as quietly as possible, but she still caught the attention of a few on the periphery. With her tall frame and abundance of curly auburn hair, she couldn’t exactly hide. As expected, they shot her glances laced with contempt. Ducking her head, she scuttled away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Reading in the dormitory was out of the question, for Beatrice and Emmeline would be arriving soon, hyped up from hatred of Grindelwald and blood supremacy. Then they wouldn’t see Polymela their classmate, only the daughter of Ulysses Nott. She sighed; like she’d asked for one of the biggest Grindelwald supporters on this side of the world for a father. He wasn’t too happy with his Gryffindor daughter, either. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draping her bag over the desk chair, she thought of a better place to spend the evening. The vast, abandoned room on the fifth floor was surely empty, waiting for her. For the first time in Merlin-knew-how long, a small smile lifted the corners of her lips as she opened her bureau drawer and took out her second-most prized possession—the first was a silk dress with a billowed skirt her grandmother had given her for her 16th birthday—Maria Lambetti’s new record. Holding it against her chest, Polymela left Gryffindor Tower without a glance at the others, in a much better mood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The intended plan for the abandoned room was unknown, but it had the required criteria: wide open space tucked away from others and a record player. Polymela set up the record, smiling again when Maria Lambetti’s voice echoed around the room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took off her school robes and flung them over a creaky old chair. Her vest was about to follow, but as her hands reached up to her collar, the dread clenched around her stomach, her heart picking up speed ever so slightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll just leave it on, then,” she muttered, sick of the whole thing already. With her arms stretched wide, Polymela closed her eyes and began to twirl, singing along. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Take me back to the good old days...to the blue skies free of pain…”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>At once, the dread dissipated, allowing her to slip out of reality for the duration of the song. Her heavy wool skirt billowed around her legs, freeing them, while her long curls fanned out.  Time ceased as she swayed, the world silenced at last. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dancing was the only activity in which she felt like a woman, not a tall, gangly imitation. Her aunt told her once that her lithe figure would attract men as soon as she was fully developed, but who knew when that would be, as Polymela was already 16. Right here, right now, none of that mattered; her body felt weightless. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was cut abruptly short when the next song started playing, usually her favorite: “A Whisper in the Dark.” The dread came back full-force, stopping her in her tracks. Maria Lambetti’s smooth voice belted out lyrics Polymela could rehearse without thinking, but her throat was clogged, preventing her from singing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Desperate for air, she fell to her knees, gasping. Her throat was closing tighter, a piercing ringing blocking out the record. The song sounded tinny and distorted, the room blurring in front of her eyes. Merlin, what was happening? Was she dying? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Breathe! </span>
  </em>
  <span>Her mind was shrieking at her body, but her lungs weren’t cooperating. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no…” she moaned, pressing her palms against her ears and crouching over. Saliva dribbled down her chin and her eyes filled with tears as the ringing grew louder, vibrating her skull…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her forehead met the wooden floor, stirring up dust, which filled her nose and triggered a sneezing fit. Oddly, this jolted her out of panic, calming her down. Gasping, she pinched her nose and inhaled sharply. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The record played on as if its owner hadn’t nearly died on the the floor in front of it. For a moment, Polymela lost lucidity, blinking in consternation. Then she climbed to her feet and pulled the needle off the record with shaking hands. She was trembling and covered with sweat, her heart hammering away, but at least her mind was clear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, that was horrible,” she muttered to herself just to hear to voice, to confirm that she was indeed still alive. After stuffing the record back in its case, she slipped on her robes and made her way back to Gryffindor Tower, walking briskly and taking quick, even steps. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luckily the rally was finished, a few Gryffindors lingering around the fire, mugs of mead in hand. Only Ignatius Prewett noticed her, giving her a small smile. By the time she got her mouth working, he’d looked away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once she entered the fifth-year girls’ dormitory, she’d calmed down considerably. Beatrice Winter was the single occupant, sitting at her desk, writing what appeared to be a letter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Polymela kicked off her shoes and drew the bed hangings without undressing. She lay flat on her back, the record next to her elbow. Exhaustion took hold, weighing her muscles down and sinking her into the blanket and pillow. Her eyes closed, ready for sleep, but her mind still raced, trying to make sense of it all. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Something’s wrong</span>
  </em>
  <span>—that much was clear. What wasn’t clear was anything else. Was Polymela simply going mad? She wouldn’t be the only one in the castle, with the threat of Grindelwald taking over the UK. No, it couldn’t be, she assured herself, otherwise she would feel mental all the time, not just under certain circumstances. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Listing those circumstances would probably help, she figured, so she started with the obvious, that Maria Lambetti tune. Why would one of her favorite songs steal the breath from her lungs? Such an odd reaction, yet so powerful. Even now, the anxiety lingered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Brushing back her hair with sticky palms, Polymela recalled the potions lesson, Yaxley, the scent of his cologne. He hadn’t done anything strange, though…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What had started it? Racking her mind, she tried to remember the very first time she felt the dread. New Years Day...walking down the corridor...the pale winter sunlight shining through the large windows...nearly bumping into two green-robed figures, both handsome and dark-haired: sixth-year Slytherin prefect Cygnus Black and Head Boy Tom Riddle, also of Slytherin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’d been smirking at the girl in front of them. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sorry</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she’d mumbled, shuffling away, eyes on her Mary Janes, wanting to get as far away from them as possible. Riddle was nothing but unobtrusive and polite, but Black was another Sacred 28 rich boy, even worse than Yaxley. Last term, he’d told Polymela she was a disgrace to her bloodline by allowing the Sorting Hat to place her in Gryffindor. This had wounded her, since her father shared that sentiment, but she hated them both so she quickly disregarded it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As much of an arrogant arsehole as Cygnus Black was, he wasn’t dangerous, not to her knowledge. A couple of years ago when the muggle-borns were targeted by something within the castle, everyone pointed the finger at him, considering he loathed each victim. But after Myrtle Warren’s death, Rubeus Hagrid was caught with a giant beast and expelled. Not very surprising, as Hagrid was always trying to sneak vicious creatures into the castle despite multiple reprimands and detentions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, what? Why such a reaction to a boy who was all talk? Something crucial was missing, but Polymela was too tired to think of it any longer, the wheels of her mind finally stilling. As she rolled over, he elbow slammed into the record case, knocking it off the bed. It slid under the bed hangings and dropped to the floor, ignored. Meanwhile, Polymela settled on her side, hugging the pillow, and succumbed to sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~**~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The early morning sun streamed through the high windows in sharp contrast to the fog of gloom that had overtaken the castle lately. The Daily Prophet had arrived while Albus was dressing, sitting neatly on the desk in his office. He’d decided he was not going to read it just yet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took a seat and lifted his teacup, surveying the world outside. Saturday, no classes, allowed for a more languid pace. The quidditch pitch had a few blue dots scattered around—Ravenclaws’ practice. Despite the bright sun, the outside air was below freezing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus smiled, recalling his own youth, when weather and other obstacles never stopped him. Now he felt as if he was forever held in place by something he couldn’t see. At least he was held at Hogwarts teaching the next generation of wizards. On that train of thought, he had plenty of essays to grade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After another swallow of tea, Albus dove into the seventh-year pile, the easiest, for his NEWT classes had a much better grip on Transfiguration theory than the younger-years. Of course that was to be expected—the younger-years were in the midst of a steep learning curve in both magical theory and the world itself. Not so easy, coming of age in the Great Wizarding War, especially for muggle-borns. Because of this, Albus had vowed to increase his threshold of patience. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Halfway through the first essay—so far nearly flawless, written by Head Girl Lysandra Bell—a harried knock came from his office door. “Enter,” he called, setting down his quill. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A wide-eyed Septima Vector burst into the room. “Albus!” she cried. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Automatically assuming something happened to a student, Albus stood, ready to trot out of the room. “What’s happened, Septima?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you read the paper?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have not,” he answered, calming a bit. If the urgency was outside the castle walls, the students weren’t in immediate danger. Just the usual amount of danger, he reminded himself grimly. “Let’s have a seat, shall we?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Septima nodded, spotting the folded newspaper on the desk as she sat down. She snatched it up and set it on top of Lysandra’s essay, facing Albus. The headline jumped out: GRINDELWALD SEIZES FRENCH MINISTRY. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s advancing, Albus,” said Septima, voice wobbling with worry. “It’s only a matter of time before he sets his sights on the UK.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That won’t happen,” he assured her firmly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It quite looks like it will,” she insisted with a glance at the photo of a very familiar symbol spray-painted on a Parisian building: a triangle with a line through the center and circle in the middle. The symbol of the Deathly Hallows. Once, in a different lifetime, Albus had drawn that symbol on parchment, had signed his name with it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now it turned his stomach almost as much as watching his lover become his enemy—almost. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Albus, please,” said Septima in an unusually soft tone. “You’re the only one who can defeat him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Albus tore his eyes from the photo and looked into her eyes, wide with fear. It was disconcerting, to say the least, to see the normally brisk, cold woman on the verge of tears. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure I can defeat him,” he admitted, “but I will not let him seize Magical Britain.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Septima nodded, satisfied with his answer. She reached over and squeezed his hand before leaving. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By now his tea had gone cold, so he abandoned it, along with the newspaper and essays, and walked to the window, gazing out to the field. The blue dots were all in the air now, zooming around the pitch. Albus had to protect them. He’d failed in 1943 despite every effort to catch the killer. Catch, not find, for he was right under everyone’s nose. Proof, unfortunately, was nowhere to be found. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Swallowing a ball of distaste, Albus turned away from the window and sat back down at his desk, pulling open the bottom drawer. Inside a locked cedar box was a phial, which he took out to inspect even though he’d held it countless times in that previous life. It had held a mixture of his and Gellert Grindelwald’s blood—a blood pact made between two 17-year-old boys, two lovers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now the phial was empty, only the faintest pink tinting the glass. After a painful bit of complex, obscure magic, Albus had drained the blood, effectively ending the pact. Nothing had befallen him yet, but Albus knew the consequence would come for him once he actually moved in defiance of the pact. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Neither of us shall move against the other.</span>
  </em>
  <span> But Grindelwald was effectively moving against Albus, wasn’t he? He couldn’t honestly expect Albus to remain tucked at Hogwarts forever while he turned the wizarding word—the entire world—upside down, would he?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, that is exactly what you’re doing, a voice in his head pointed out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now without the blood pact, there was no obstacle unless Grindelwald had already gotten the Elder Wand. This was very likely, as that the Hallow he’d been most intent on possessing. He’d never given up his quest for the Deathly Hallows. On the contrary, it had taken a single afternoon for Albus to give up his quest for them entirely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something burning was brewing in his throat. Elder Wand or not, Grindelwald had to be stopped and clearly the ministries were not the ones to do it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taking a swallow of the cold tea to soothe the burning, Albus checked his watch. He had to form a plan to take down his former lover and the most dangerous wizard in the world, but now was not the time. The more pressing and much easier task was to think up non-magical labor that would occupy at least two hours, for Icarus Yaxley was due to start detention in 15 minutes.</span>
</p><p>
