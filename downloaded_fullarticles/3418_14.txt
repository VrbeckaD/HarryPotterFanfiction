    <p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had only recently mended fences and begun talking. They were getting along brilliantly-- too brilliantly, perhaps.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione was enjoying her eighth year at Hogwarts, while he was trudging through the formalities of it all. Everyone either wished they didn't have to do the year over, or, like her, wished that they could do twenty more years! </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At some point, between bumping into classes, being partnered during Slugworth's lab, a spark had ignited. They were both reluctant to admit this, though. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since then, glances held a bit more weight, laughs were even flirtatious, at times. The question on everyone's mind was, when would they let their guard down? </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It would happen on a snowy afternoon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hogwarts was glistening with icicles and snowflakes. Hermione admired the facade from outside, laying out on a bench. Her form created a haphazard snow-angel on the wood. Next to her lay a thermos of hot chocolate spiked with a smidgen of coffee. In her hand was a book, propped open while she perused the text. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had to admit, daydreaming came a bit more naturally these days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her daydream was shattered by the feeling of a snowball smacking the book from her hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bloody-- Oh no!" She shouted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She let out a yelp and scrambled for the book, only to knock her thermos over and out onto the snow. The white stuff melted, succumbing to the heat of the chocolatey delight she had conjured. So much wasted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once she had managed to collect her book and now-empty thermos, she stood up, looking for the perpetrator.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nobody was seen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who's out there?! Show yourself! You... You cowardly arsehole!" She huffed, her scarf slackened about her form and nearly touched the snow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>From the treeline he hid, just barely able to peek at her distraught form stomping the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He may be on good terms with the witch, since she was kind enough to put unsavory history behind them, but he still needed to have his fun with her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sure, he might enjoy the way she grew red in the cheeks with frustration, or pursed her lips stoically in protest. In the cold air, those lips were a bit redder than usual. Her eyes, a furious chocolate brown, darted around to find him. He was having none of that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Come on, then!" She shouted, dusting snow from her book and screwing the lid back onto her thermos. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was busy admiring her casual outfit, muggle leggings, snow boots, and a long, baggy that her father had sent her upon request. He was so busy, in fact, that he didn't hear her say "Homenum Revelio." He had been caught.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knew it was over when she began to mutter an incarcerous spell, but he cut her off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Alright, alright... I'll come out with my hands up." He slowly revealed himself, since her wand was already pointed his direction. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She scoffed, quickly dropping her wand and shaking her head at him in disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What the hell, Draco... Are you intent on ruining my quiet holiday afternoon?" She crossed her arms, and began to turn to go inside before he could defend himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, come on. It was funny! I will say I didn't expect you to blunder and spill your cocoa, though. That was a plus," he teased, quickly running up to walk with her. He made sure to stay out of arm's reach, though.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You... Ugh-- why couldn't you have just gone home for the Christmas holiday?" She huffed, while checking the pages of her book now for tears, bends, or water damage. He shook his head smartly, stuffing his hands into his pockets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, well you know... I think I'm keen on at least one year away from the Manor. You know, I could ask you the same thing, Hermione." They made it to the arched outdoor garden leading toward the classrooms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I already told you, Malfoy," she said his surname with a bit of venom, "I wanted to have some time alone. My parents understood, they gave me their blessing. I have nothing to feel guilty about!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt so guilty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was stopping at the door of the kitchen, peering her head in stealthily. He peered in behind her in a rather comical way. "What are we looking for." </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow startled, she gasped, smacking him in the chest before entering the kitchen. Although there weren't many options for food for people staying behind during the holidays, there was plenty of cocoa and coffee. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She made a bee-line, ignoring him talking behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Shouldn't we ask for permission? I wouldn't want either of us losing housepoints, you know. I'm ever so afraid of what might become of us if we're caught at this hour..." He feigned concern in such a way that it was both infuriating and comedic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was laughing when she finished up refilling her thermos. She turned to him, smirking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Are you quite finished?" She glared darkly, betrayed by her smirk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Almost, one more thing," he bright his fingertips to his teeth and pretended to gnaw them out of worry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Alright, you two... get out of here..." a voice spoke, startling Draco enough to spin around with a noticeable start.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This elicited quite the laugh from Hermione. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Afternoon, Chef Guarnaschelli. I just need to top my cocoa off since SOMEONE spilled it..." she glared at Draco.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco feigned guilt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, I didn't know it was you, honey. Help yourself. Oh! Actually, I was wondering if you and your... friend here... might want this half of a cake left over?" The Italian woman walked toward a counter just beyond the fridge, and retrieved a decorative box.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It was left over from one of the cook's birthday yesterday." She handed it over, implying that she would not take 'no' for an answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"OH! Thank you! I'd love that." Hermione attempted to peek into the box, to no avail. She was shoo'ed out of the kitchen soon after that, along with Draco.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the hallway, the chef waved them off, and they started walking again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So... where should we eat that cake?" He asked, peering over at her in curiousity. "You don't think it's chocolate do you... I do love a chocolate cake," he nearly whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stopped, and turned to him sassily. "You-- you don't think that I'm going to give YOU any, do you?" She began to cling the cake to her chest covetously. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh... well Chef said that--" he began innocently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"'Oh well Chef said', that doesn't mean I have to share with YOU!" She mocked him, although barely able to hide a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But you couldn't possibly put that entire cake away! You're so tiny! It's the size of your head-- just let me have half." His hands came together over his chest in a prayer motion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hmmm... I suppose you're right. And it'd be wrong to waste it." She pondered, looking off to the side in thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Let's go to your commonroom." She finally suggested. Before he could protest, she turned around. "It's not as if I'm getting crumbs all over Gryffindor." She snarked, and they were off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was short work to make it to the Slytherin commonroom, and it was rather comical how quickly he spat out the password to enter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only moments ago she revealed that the cake certainly SMELLED chocolatey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After fumbling into the commonroom like a nervous teen, he sat down. Then he got back up, rushing into the kitchen. He returned with a fork and sat back down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He eyed the package in her arms greedily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She set it down on the pitch black coffee table before them. Her eyes were elsewhere, taking in the dark greens and blacks of the commonroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's... nicer than I expected." She began, while tugging off her scarf and coat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was too busy cracking open the cake to notice that she was taking off her large sweater too, revealing a form-fitting green thermal shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was also too busy drooling over the German chocolate cake to see her begin wandering around the common room and out of sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He daintily scraped a few shaved chocolate flakes from the top of the cake and let them melt in his mouth. There was a noticeable shiver overcoming him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>From there, he began to carefully carve out a small sliver from top to bottom, and hovered his hand beneath the fork as it travelled to his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mmmmm..., Aren't you going to eat any?" He asked to nobody. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked around, chewing. He hadn't imagined her, had he? The cake was real enough-- so where had she gone? </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyes went wide as he turned to notice his doorway, just down the hall, opened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nearly leapt over the back of the couch, fork clattering to the floor, to investigate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Upon arriving at his room, he saw nobody. He crept deeper into the room, looking left and right-- trying to find where she was hiding. He crept to the closet, grinning. Slowly, his nimble fingers wrapped around the doorknob, and he could practically hear her giggling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He jerked the door open, seeing nothing but clothes and shoes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What ARE you doing?" She asked from the hallway, peering into the room for the first time. Her sleeves were rolled up as she dried her hands on a cloth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Nothing. Where did you go?" He questioned, squinting at her slightly as he casually shut his closet door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I was washing my hands..." She stepped into his room, wondering what was so interesting in there. She looked at the neatness and took note. She noticed the freshly-made bed, his slippers next to it, and his silk robe draped along the foot. His desk is what caught her eye the most.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She made her way over to the bookcase just next to it, eyes meandering over titles until she inspected the books on his desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, we should get back to that cake, Hermione. It's SO good, I can't even explain it." He began daydreaming over it once again, smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then he noticed her investigating a letter sent from Blaise, stretched out on his desk for all the world to see. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he had managed to cross the room to distract her view, nearly sitting on the desk in front of her, she had managed to make out "<em>why not just challenge the witch to a game of Truth or Dare, I'm sure you--."</em></span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was startled by him sliding to block her view.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's that, then?" She asked, peering over his shoulder in vain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What's what, then?" He questioned, slowly stretching over the desk, as if it were all quite casual at thing to do. As he did, his ribbed turtleneck raised over his lower abdomen, revealing a bit of white skin to the dark room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I couldn't read any of it, if that's what you're worried about," she crossed her arms, her lie far too apparent as she avoided eye contact.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, we both know you're an awful liar, I know you read it." He challenged, pointing a finger at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Then who is Zabini suggesting you play Truth or Dare with?" She retorted, head tilted, volleying the challenge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I-eh... It's stupid, he's just keen on playing match-maker with me." Draco turned to face the desk, tucking all embarrassing things away and out of sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was apparent that Draco wanted to drop it, and she acquiesed-- for now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Now, you MUST try this cake." He left the room, but waited for her, gentlemanly in a way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just as she was out of the door, he shut his door tightly, if possible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were back on the couch, enjoying the cake in silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As if the triple-chocolate German cake weren't enough, they both decided to wash it all down with some of her hot chocolate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Any tension that had risen in the air was falling by the way-side, as the chocolate filled them with cheer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the sun set, the fireplace turned on just behind her. She was knelt on the floor hovering over the half-demolished cake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the flames illuminated the room, they both looked around, noticing the windows were caked with snow by now save for small ovals revealing the world outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So..." Hermione toyed with a bit of cake, debating eating some more. "Why is it that Zabini is 'keen' on getting you a girlfriend?" She began tearing away a bit of icing, licking that off of her fork.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally content with a belly full of cake, Draco had joined her on the floor, across the table and leaning back on the couch. His eyes were full, too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His view was the back-lit silhouette of the witch seated in front of him. His appetite may have been satiated in terms of food, but the manner in which she was licking the icing off of her fork was proving a quality apartif. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She noticed his expression darken slightly, and tilted her head, "Draco? Did you hear me?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shot his eyes from her mouth to her eyes, and to the window. He stretched casually once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Ahh, no, what was that? Oh, Zabini? Well, he knows how picky I am, and I just... I don't know. He knows I have my eye on a specific witch, but..." </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes grew rounder in wonder, "Oh? But?" She was still licking that bloody fork.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But... I haven't what is it-- courage? I haven't the courage to see if she has eyes for me, as well." He nodded, as if it were the most casual thing in the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His pulse throbbed in his neck and ears. The crackle of the fire was unheard to him, since he was apparently deaf from blood-flow. He nearly worried for stroke. Is that what muggles called it? Could Hermione save him from a coronary infarction? He swallowed finally--breathed finally.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who is it?" She asked plainly, resting her elbows on the table. She looked deeply into his face. "I bet... it's... Jeannie.." She nodded, tapping her fingertip to her lip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Who?" He quirked a brow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You know, that girl that's always fawning over you from the stands at Quidditch matches? Blonde hair?" She made a motion, as if he would understand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Heh, no. Guess again," he teased, reaching for a sip of cocoa.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hmm, perhaps... Is it Ladrissa?" She shot upright slightly from her knelt position. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Umh... No. She's gay." He supplied, tension coiling within him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, well I suppose she is..." Hermione trailed off in wonder, "makes so much sense, now..." She muttered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's you." He uttered, his voice warbling slightly, quite unattractively.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"... Ginny had told me, but, well, I didn't believe it. But I suppose there's no real 'look', is there. No... That's homophobic to think... Sexist even, maybe..." She was doing that thing again, tapping her lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I said it's you," He leaned forward, courage leaving him as he reached for the nearest source of comfort. Cake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What?" She asked after many long moments of silence and staring his way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had already given up on his admission, burying himself in cake. It had been literal minutes since his second attempt. He just assumed that she was off in her own world-- never to know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked up at her, crumbs falling from his fork. He seemed to think remaining still would reverse time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's me?" She seemed to reposition herself on the rug, as if assessing herself in a new light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He noticed this, and chuckled the tiniest chuckle. "Yea." He admitted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well--wow. I guess... It makes sense, I suppose." She nodded quite matter-of-factly. Now, though, her eyes were on her fork as she inspected the make and model from her lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hadn't the heart to break her silence, but had lost his appetite. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cat was out of the bag. Worms out of the can. Guts all over the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In an attempt to breathe, he straightened his back, looking to the watch on his wrist. He made to speak, but coughed instead. He could have sworn that she was about to say something. He had to hear what she had to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, she merely looked up at him innocently and went 'hm'?</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His face screwed up in a way she'd only seen when he was younger. She braced herself for impact.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"'Hm?'... 'HM??!' That's all you have to say after I basically admit that I've fallen for you?!?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was shouting now, but his voice revealed that he wasn't angry so much as hurt. Her eyes grew wide and her mouth followed suit. She attempted to defend herself, but he interrupted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You--You just... sit there... Eating cake and going on about lesbians... And I'm over here, spilling my heart out to the most insufferable witch of her age!" He was standing now, pacing a small distance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She remained on her knees, watching him in shock from the other side of the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And you have the NERVE to just... be silent. You, the most out-spoken, noisy, loud-mouthed WITCH in this entire sch--" Something happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the span of seconds, he was halted by a keen spell on Hermione's part--this was followed up by her coming to stand on the short table, grip him by the collar, and slap him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Winded, he was looking up at him now-- the spell fading. His stunned face was tilted up to take her in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I know I couldn't make you want me," he whispered up toward her. He watched her eyes as they studied his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You can't make me do anything..." She insisted, before closing the gap between them. Their noses brushed clumsily before finding a comfortable nook on either side. Her chocolately lips captured his briefly, almost chastely, before pulling away enough for an inch to come between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He opened his eyes up toward her, gulping, and nearly swooning at her proximity. The position was oddly reminiscent of years ago, when she punched him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She certainly had the upper hand again, and he was at a loss for words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well. Now that you've calmed down... Shall we?" She carefully stepped down from the table to stand right in front of him, now nearly a foot shorter-- looking up at him instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had an awfully enticing effect on him.</span>
