    <p> </p>
<p>The first time Harry saw him was coming up the steps of Gringotts as he was going down. The Bank was magnificent, it held so much attention that Harry almost missed the boy with white blonde hair and silvery gray eyes, but they bumped into each other, and years later, Harry would be thankful that they had. At the time, however, the other boy sneered, “watch where you’re going,” without stopping. Harry didn’t have a chance to apologize as they were swept in opposite directions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Something about the boy made him want to turn around and watch him leave, but he was quickly out of sight. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t think about the boy once he was inside the bank, but less than an hour later, Hagrid left Harry at Madam Malkin's with a blush and a mumbled excuse. When Harry followed a helpful lady to the back where there was a fitting area, he was startled and happy to find the Blonde Boy there. It appeared he was happy to see Harry as well, for a smile stretched across his face, and although he looked condescending, it lit up his face enough Harry didn’t mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s you!” The boy exclaimed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry shrugged as he stepped up on the stool. “It’s me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Glad to see you figured out how to walk. What’s your name?” Instead of being upset, Harry snorted at that, glad he had found someone who had a similar sense of humor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry.” Harry said simply, not really wanting a repeat of the scene in the Leaky Cauldron. “What’s yours?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m Draco. Are you a First Year, too?” Draco turned slightly so a sales girl could hem the side of his robe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah.” He was being boring. No one his age had ever wanted to talk to him for long, so he didn’t have a lot of experience with interesting conversation. What should he say? While he was trying to come up with something, Draco went on talking about where his mother and father were and after that, the houses at Hogwarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Harry answered when Draco asked what house he was going to be in. “What’s the difference?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well,” Draco drawled, “Slytherin is the best of course, then you have Ravenclaw, bunch of know-it-alls, Hufflepuffs are dunderheads, then you have Gryffindors. They’re the enemies of Slytherins, all brave and noble.” The last part was said in a mocking voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh,” Said Harry, starting to feel a little bad. There was nothing really wrong about this boy, but he was rubbing Harry the wrong way. He didn’t like it when people were mean to each other, even if no one it applied to was in the room. What if he ended up in one of the other Houses? “How do you know which house you get into?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Draco grudgingly admitted. “My Father says it’s important to expect the unexpected, so he didn’t tell me, but I think it’s some kind of test.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“A test?” Harry blanched. He was doomed. “I bet I’ll fail, and they won’t even let me in.” His heart began to hammer away in his chest, he would have sat down if someone wasn’t at his feet still working on his robes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey,” Draco said suddenly, all signs of condescension melting from him. He was facing Harry now as the seamstress worked on his left side. “I’m sure it’ll be ok. I’ve never heard of anyone being enrolled only to kick them out before classes even start. I bet you’ll be in Slytherin with me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Really?” Harry asked, feeling better now that Draco wasn’t being mean. Maybe he had misjudged him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah. You just need to be brilliant, and you are, so obviously, you’re in.” There was an air of prestige with him again, but this time it was directed towards Harry. Maybe Draco was just nervous, and he had a mask that was his way of coping. Harry tended to get quiet and fidgety when he was nervous, it drove Aunt Petunia mad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thanks, I bet you’re right.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What are friends for? And you bet I’m right, remember that, because it’s always true.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry laughed, actually laughed, even if it was really breathy. Were they really friends? His first real friend his own age of his very own. He was afraid his grin might split his face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“All done!” The girl working on Draco’s robes announced. “I’ll bring these to the register for you, if you want to look around some more.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco waved her off, coming to stand next to Harry, staring critically at his robes. “This needs to come in another two inches,” he said, pinching the cuffs in how he wanted them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The woman who was working on his robes scowled, “I don’t need help, dearie, why don’t you look around?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry would have it were him. Apparently, Draco didn’t mind confrontation. “He’s paying good gold for these robes and he deserves to get them fitted properly. Or should he go somewhere a seamstress can take a critique?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Seamstress bit her lip but nodded slightly. “Are you wearing anything under this sweater, dear? It would be fitted better without it.” Oh, that was bad. Oh, a bad situation had just unfolded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry had bruises on his arms from his latest bouts with Dudley and the Dursleys, and if his shirt rode up, they would see even more. As he stammered, Draco rolled his eyes. “Just go to the dressing room, go on.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More thankful than he could believe, Harry hopped off the stool and raced towards the door Draco had pointed to. He changed quickly, leaving his trousers on, and was back on the stool in no time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“See that’s better already.” Harry’s stomach did a strange flip at Draco’s approval.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’ll be wearing clothing under the robes,” the seamstress pointed out, perhaps trying to gain favor in the conversation but Draco didn’t acknowledge her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why are you wearing muggle clothes anyway? Are they supposed to be so big?” Draco picked up the sweater Harry had been wearing between his pointer and thumb, face screwed up in a look of disgust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, I just get most of my clothes from hand-me-downs from my fat cousin.” He really got all his clothes that way, but Draco didn’t need to know that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco laughed, dropping the sweater. “We’ll have to go shopping after this, find some clothing that fits. You’ll need it for when you’re not wearing uniforms, and I won’t be seen in your company if you’re wearing <em>that.</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was glad he had gotten to know Draco enough that he could realize Draco was mostly joking…. right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco!” A voice came from the door. It belonged to a beautiful woman who had to be Draco’s mother or older sister, with her long blonde hair and haughty expression. “Are you finished yet?” She asked as she got closer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, mother, I was just waiting on my friend. We were going to get some clothes for him.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco’s mother’s eyes roved over Harry briefly, went back to Draco, then immediately returned to Harry’s forehead. They widened, but that was the only indication that she noticed who Draco’s new friend was. “Lovely,” She said in a charming voice, “but your father is waiting. I’ll purchase your robes, you say goodbye to your friend.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She was leaving when Draco protested, “But Mother-!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco.” Was all she needed to say, in a scary mother tone of voice, for Draco to quieten.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After she had left, Draco turned back to Harry, a slightly sheepish expression on his face. “Well, I’ll see you on the train at least. Promise me you’ll buy a couple extra outfits, alright?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded, wondering if there was a spell to hide things. He didn’t want the Dursleys to take his new clothes. He watched as Draco left, his mother’s hand on his shoulder leading him out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry managed to find a section that sold non-robes wizard wear and added enough for a week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The rest of the summer passed quickly, at the same time as a snail’s pace, because Harry simply couldn’t wait to go to school. He read and re-read all his school books and the couple other books he had purchased for extra-curricular. He had entered Flourish and Blotts with a goal in mind, to find as many books as possible about the magical world, and at least one on concealing objects. The shopkeeper had recommended several for what Harry asked, and Harry picked the biggest ones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had found a fairly simple spell for keeping the Dursleys away from his belongings and after a few attempts succeeded. At least he figured it worked, since they didn’t attempt to come near the magical belongings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He also attempted a couple of the first-year spells as he didn’t want to look like a dunderhead on his first day, not being able to do any magic would be awful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry wondered idly if it was the spell that made his Uncle throw his trunk on the sidewalk next to him before driving off laughing with his wife and son. Probably not, he concluded as he dragged his trunk over to a cart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He found Platform 9 easily enough, and 10, but there was no 9 ¾. After a rather heated discussion with a conductor, he began to panic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“...Packed with Muggles of course. Come on!” came a voice floating to Harry, and it was one of the most wonderful things he had ever heard. ‘Muggle’ was a wizarding term, which meant that the red-haired family heading towards him and Platform 9 were wizards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had tentatively made friends with Ron when he saw the blonde, drawling boy again. Draco, his mind supplied helpfully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He smiled when he saw him through the window of the compartment door, but it quickly vanished when he saw the look on Draco’s face. Gone was the charming boy he had realized Draco was in the later part of their meeting. In his place was a practically snarling, cruel looking boy, flanked by two large boys with condescending cruel expressions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, well, well. Look what we have here.” He drawled, looking down his nose at the boys. “Weasley. Trying to rub elbows with the rich and famous. And you, Potter. Don’t you know anything about his family? More children than they could ever hope to afford. You’d do better to find better suited friends. Like a Ferret, at least it’s a couple steps up from a Weasel.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They were stunned for a moment, but Ron jumped up, fist barred, “Say that again!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why, you too stupid to hear or do you have dirt in your ears as well as on your nose?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Get out!” Harry yelled. “And don’t come back!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Malfoy sneered at both of them, “I’m not sure I want to. Look at all this food you have. I bet you tried to buy him off, Potter. Guess you did know how poor he is. OW!” He had buried his hand in the pile of sweets and come out with a rat biting his finger. He screamed and swung his hand around trying and succeeding in knocking it off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“On second thought, we were just leaving,” he was gone, pushing the two burly boys out of the way in his haste.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron was laughing, but Harry just stood there staring at the empty doorway. Why had Draco changed so much? Which one was the real Draco?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can’t believe it, he’s gone back to sleep!” Ron said about his rat, Scabbers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t comment. He just closed the compartment door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco continued to torment Harry and his friends throughout the year. Harry went to his lessons, there was Draco, sneering at him through most of them. Harry made friends with Hermione, after Draco had called her some mean name. Harry got on the quidditch team, thanks to Draco’s cruelty. Harry learned about the Philosopher’s Stone after Draco challenged him to a duel and didn’t show up. Harry got detention in the Forbidden Forest and met Voldemort, again thanks to Draco. It seemed like everything that happened to him that year was somehow, or another related to Draco.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through it all, Harry mourned the loss of his friend, his first friend, and the nice boy hidden under that ugly exterior. Not that Malfoy was physically ugly, in fact he seemed to get more and more beautiful. It wasn’t fair. Harry wanted to forget about that boy he had met in Madam Malkin’s, but it was just impossible. As time went on, however, the pain he had associated with losing his friend began to dull and became easier to deal with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The mystery of the Philosopher's Stone unfolded, distracting him and his friends, but in the back of his mind, he couldn't help contemplating the mystery that was Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a voice, speaking to him. Harry’s head hurt, and he didn’t want to wake up. He was drifting, but there was something about that voice, something that pulled him in. He wanted to hear more, take more in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His brain caught up more of the words, and he realized someone wasn’t talking to him, so much as reading aloud, presumably from a potions book or something similar, he recognized some of the keywords being used. He listened to the gentle, musical words, going back to hearing more of the tone than the actual words. He still didn’t want to awaken, but the longer he laid there, listening quietly, the more he wanted to know who it was.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It sounded so familiar, but there was something about it that was uniquely foreign. He peeked one eye open and had a hard time not gasping. It was Draco Malfoy, sitting at his bedside in the hospital wing, reading quietly to him. Harry stared in utter bewilderment, wondering if he was dreaming. It would make more sense than whatever was actually happening.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He opened his other eye and observed Draco—Malfoy. He was acting so strange, being nice, like he had at Madam Malkin’s. He didn’t want to break the spell of whatever was happening. He had missed Draco, the person he had met in the robe shop, to the point where he looked forward to the times when his ‘Malfoy’ personality would interact with him. He knew that wasn’t healthy, and he wasn’t sure what it was about Draco in particular that brought forth that reaction. He had never looked forward to being bullied with anyone else, when he was younger or presently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry suddenly remembered the Philosopher’s Stone, and he almost had a violent reaction. Luckily, he stopped himself from jumping, not wanting to startle Draco. The stone had to be safe, otherwise, Harry wouldn’t be alive. He relaxed back into the bed, staring at Draco.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Usually, there were hard lines across his face, but it was softened, warm and welcoming. Harry could look at him all day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco glanced in his direction for a second before doing a double take. Their eyes met, Draco’s widened and his mouth opened. “Pomfrey said you weren’t going to wake up yet!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry blinked, sitting up. “I’m sorry. We can pretend I’m still asleep, if you want to continue.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco shook his head. “I need to go, forget you saw me, Potter!” He quickly stood from his chair, but Harry was faster. He lunged over and gripped Draco’s wrist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Stay, please!” Draco looked back at Harry, his face now riddled with fear. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You wouldn’t understand, Scar-Head. Let me go.” Draco pulled once on his arm, but it wasn’t very strong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why don’t you try me? What’s going on? Why are you here?” Harry asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco glanced at the Hospital Wing doors, then back at Harry. “I can’t.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can’t what?” Harry asked in confusion. Draco only appeared more distressed, it hurt Harry to look at. “I wish you would tell me, but I can’t force you.” His grip loosened, then he let go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite his efforts to break free, Draco did not immediately try to escape. “You’re just letting me go?” He asked, some of the fear leaving his face to be replaced by confusion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “I want you to stay, and explain to me why you’re here, but I’m not going to even try to make you to do something you don’t want to do. If you’re worried about someone seeing, I promise, I won’t say a word.” Draco hesitated, looking towards the hospital wing doors again, before looking back at Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I shouldn’t be here.” Draco said quietly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You want to be, though,” Harry said carefully, looking at him. “Something’s stopping you. I always wondered why you suddenly decided to be mean to me, but I didn’t think someone was making you. That’s it though, isn’t it?” Harry’s eyes widened as he saw Draco’s surprise and disarm. “Is someone threatening you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You don’t know anything, Potter.” Draco said quietly, trying and failing to put force in his words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Then explain it to me, please!” Draco looked down at his hands, not answering. Harry gave him a minute, then slowly reached out to place his hand over both of Draco’s. Draco flinched, his hands twitching away, before resuming their place. Draco looked up and met Harry’s eyes. Harry looked back, begging him with his eyes as the two stared at each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco gulped, and Harry was surprised to see the beginnings of tears as Draco looked down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m so tired of this. I don’t want to do it anymore.” He said quietly. His hands twitched again, and Harry thought he would pull away, but instead he turned one over so that it was facing Harry’s. They weren’t quite holding hands, the angle was off, but it was nice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What don’t you want to do anymore?” Draco shook his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t have a choice, I have to.” Harry took a deep breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Please, you’re not making any sense. Just tell me.” Harry waited, and waited. Just when he thought he wasn’t going to get anything else out of Draco, he spoke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I didn’t know it was you, when we first met. I mean, I didn’t know you were Harry Potter. It didn’t matter. There was something about you that I… liked. I didn’t make a real difference to me, but my mother noticed who you were, and told me. I’ll admit, I was excited, but it wasn’t because it was Harry Potter, it was just, I know it’s weird, but I always admired the famous Harry Potter, and I dreamed about us being friends. It felt like my big dream was coming true. Only…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was silence again, and Harry tried to take all that in. He didn’t like the idea that people only liked him because he was famous, but that didn’t sound like what was happening. Draco had liked him before finding out he was <em>the</em> Harry Potter, it sounded more like it was just a bonus to him. His thumb stroked the edge of Draco’s hand in comfort and gentle prodding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“…My father, he…” Draco cleared his throat. “He made it very clear that any sort of friendship would not be tolerated. I argued at first, and refused to sever ties, and threw tantrums. I wasn’t used to not getting my way. Father quickly became angry, and…” This time, Harry could tell he didn’t just need time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What did he do?” He asked quietly, and moved closer, repositioning his hand so he could hold Draco’s in comfort. Draco didn’t continue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My relatives don’t like a lot of what I do. They punish me a lot.” Harry said quietly. Draco looked up, meeting his eyes. After several long moments, Draco took a deep breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It was more what he didn’t do. What he said he would do. He’s never been that bad. The things he said he’d do to me though…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can you tell someone?” Harry asked quietly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco shook his head. “I don’t think you understand how pureblood families work. I can’t tell anyone.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sighed. Despite what Draco thought, he very well could understand that. “If he’s hurting you…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He won’t. Not now that I’m doing what he wants.” Draco said firmly. Harry squeezed the hand he was holding lightly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So, you did want to be friends, then?” Harry asked quietly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco met his eyes again. “I do. But, like I said, I can’t.” They sat in silence, both lost in thought. Harry couldn’t believe what he had heard. It was so unfair. There wasn’t anything Harry could put his finger on about why he liked Draco so much, but he knew he did. There was something special about him. Harry couldn’t believe he had lost him, before he really even had him. “I heard about what happened, and I was worried about you. I didn’t expect you to even know I was here.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That was sweet.” Harry said softly. “Thank you. What were you reading?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, just a potions book. I was hoping the knowledge would sink in and help improve your skills.” There was a teasing quality to what he said, and Harry glared mockingly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gee, thanks. I’m sure it helped lots.” He said dryly. Draco laughed, and Harry’s stomach did a very strange flip. “Why does you father have a problem with me?” He asked quietly. Draco looked up, then back down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said quietly. Harry thought there was more to it than that, but he decided not to push.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So, do you really mean the things you say to me, or do you just make that up so your father doesn’t suspect you still want to be friends?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco’s lips twitched into a smirk for a moment. “I’m sorry about all the things I’ve said and done to you this year. I don’t know why I did half the things I did.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Maybe you were just taking out your anger in the only way you knew how.” Harry said quietly, Draco shrugged, but looked thoughtful. “And, I forgive you. I—I understand if you really needed to do it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco blinked at him. “Really? You’re sure? I would understand, if you hated me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “I don’t hate you. Not at all.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco smiled, and it changed his whole face. Harry smiled back, feeling a calming peace he rarely experienced. After a minute, Draco’s smile faded. “If only it mattered. After I leave, we can’t speak of this. I can’t be nice to you, Harry. I wanted you to know, but we can’t be friendly.” Harry swallowed, looking down at their clasped hands. For some reason, this was breaking his heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh,” he said quietly. He had really known that, but hearing it aloud was hard. If only there was some way they could be friends without Mr. Malfoy finding out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry head the sounds of students at the door, he couldn’t see them around the privacy curtain around his bed, but Draco’s eyes widened, jumping up as if he was burned. Harry missed the hand under his immediately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, no!” Draco whispered, panicked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked around, opening the drawer in the nightstand next to him—yes. “Here,” he said quickly. “Put it on.” He handed Draco the invisibility cloak as footsteps approached. Draco had secured it around him just as the curtains started to move.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mr. Potter!” Madam Pomfrey exclaimed. “You’re awake!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It would appear so,” Harry said, trying to stay calm. Draco was trapped where he was for now, with how the curtains were positioned with Madam Pomfrey and two students blocking the path out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, you’ll need to leave,” the Matron said to the students, who were staring at Harry, “you may leave the gifts, or come back later.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gifts?” Harry asked. Pomfrey gestured to the nightstand Harry hadn’t really taken in. It was loaded with candy and cards. He gaped. The students set their own candies on the foot of the bed, then ran away, giggling. “Thank you!” Harry called after them. “They’re for me?” Harry clarified, still a bit stunned at the turn of events.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey nodded. “Tokens from your admirers,” she said dryly. “Wait right here, I need to grab something,” she departed quickly, heading towards her office.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once she was out of sight, Draco started to appear. “Do you need it to sneak out? You can give it back tomorrow.” Harry said sadly. “Or whenever I get out of here, I mean.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh,” Draco said quietly. “Thank you, I would really appreciate that. I don’t want anyone knowing I was here.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Right.” Harry said, and his throat was a bit constricted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you, Harry.” Draco meant more than the cloak, and Harry returned his heavy smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re welcome, Draco.” Draco drew the cloak around him again, leaving the hood off for now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, goodbye…Potter.” There was so much in his tone, so much said and unsaid in that word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Goodbye…Malfoy.” Harry returned quietly. Draco looked at him for a long moment before the hood came up and he vanished from sight. Harry waited until he heard the hospital doors close before he laid back down, thinking and heartbroken.</p>
