    <p>Hera awakes.</p><p>She’s not where she should be. She’s not in her dorm, at Hogwarts, where the light streams through the high windows appearing to set fire to the red and gold tapestries and bed drapes, and the cold drafts swirl in to make the flames in the fireplaces dance. She’s on cold stone, in a cold room; there are no windows, and the air is stale.</p><p>The door is locked, and Hera does not have her wand. She’s never been proficient at wandless magic, but she tries anyway. Maybe that’s what draws his mind there, because he comes at once.</p><p>He comes, holding yew wand, and there is a strange anger in his face.</p><p>Hera launches herself at him, fighting the muggle way, and she doesn’t mind; she’s spent much of her life playing muggle anyway. But so has he, and he wins as if he hasn’t already won.</p><p>“Hera Potter,” he spits, when she’s huddled by his feet and can barely hear for the ringing in her ears. “I’ve waited for this day for many years…” He’s circling her; his feet are bare. “And yet once again, I am thwarted, it seems.”</p><p>He stops and Hera wonders who or what has come this time to save her again.</p><p>Thwarted. He’s always thwarted, even when he’s had her defenceless in a crib or alone in the forgotten nest of a basilisk, or bound against a gravestone, and thwarted it seems he is again, by his own admission. Maybe she’s not destined to ever be killed by him.</p><p>He laughs, and the sound rises high. “You don’t know how much truth there is in that, my horcrux,” he says, and he articulates that statement so hatefully and so spitefully, that Hera, as astonished as she is, doesn’t think to disbelieve him.</p><p>He sees the shocked understanding in her face. “So, you do know what that means,” he says. “How much, I wonder?”</p><p>Then he’s tearing into her mind, and Hera knows now that what Snape had put her through in her Occlumency lessons last year had been easy; mere child’s play, in fact. The blood that flows from her nose is viscous, and maybe she’s bleeding from the brain; it certainly feels like she is.</p><p>When he finds the memories of her private lessons with Dumbledore and sees the Gaunt ring on his withered hand, blinding rage flows from him like a river of lava. “So,” he huffs like a bull. “So. It wasn’t enough for you to have robbed me of my body. You plot also to destroy my soul.”</p><p>Hera runs the back of her hand through her bloodied face. “That’s how I plan to kill you, yeah.”</p><p>He shoots her a dirty look. “If you only had the grace to die the first time I wanted you to.”</p><p>“Sorry to disappoint,” Hera says, and attacks him again, rearing up to claw unceremoniously at his robes, but he says a word and suddenly Hera’s hands are burning even though there is no sign of fire. She staggers back flailing and mind casting deliriously about in that bare room for something with which to douse the searing pain.</p><p>The spell is lifted only when she is close to passing out. “I don’t think you understand your position. I have you now. No one is coming.”</p><p>“Good,” Hera pants with bravado. Her suffering is guaranteed and there’s nothing for it. “Your Death Eaters can’t help you then.” And she charges again.</p><p>This time he does let the pain carry her away. When she returns, he is standing almost halfway across the room. He slowly points his wand at her, arm extended fully. “I am your Lord now, and you must atone. Atone and you will be forgiven, for I am a merciful Lord.”</p><p>“No thanks,” says Hera when she’s strong enough to speak. “I don’t want your forgiveness.”</p><p>“You’ll want it. But first you must pay for what you did to me.”</p><p>Hera pushes herself to her knees, but that’s the furthest her body is willing to rise. “Didn’t do anything to you,” she mumbles. “Don’t want anything from you.”</p><p>He glides forward. “Thirteen years I suffered, when my spirit was ripped from its home. Thirteen long years. I will want thirteen years of your pain before I can forgive you.”</p><p>Alarm shines through Hera’s eyes, burning right through the fatigue. “What are you on about? You can’t mean to- you don’t mean that literally?”</p><p>His wand hand doesn’t move. It’s pointed directly at her chest. “Yes, I do. And your penance starts now. Are you ready?”</p><p>Hera looses one long, shaky exhale, closes her eyes in preparation, then springs to life in another desperate bid at self-defence. “No!!”</p><p>“Crucio.”</p>
