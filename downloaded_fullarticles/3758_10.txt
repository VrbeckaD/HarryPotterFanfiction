    <p align="center">Prompt: "I got stuck in a port-potty and got rescued by a hot stranger"</p><hr/><p>Â </p><p>Draco held in a long suffering sigh.</p><p>His Mother that morning deemed it absolutely impertinent that the entire family was to go down to Black Lake for a 'lovely picnic'.</p><p><em>There is nothing lovely about this</em>, Draco groused in his head as he shifted uncomfortably on the blanket beneath him. It was an extremely hot day, and all the good spots beneath the shade were already snatched up by other families.</p><p>Black Lake was a popular family destination, with its clear waters and numerous playgrounds for children. He supposed as he bit into his egg-salad sandwich the outing wouldn't have been so terrible if there were:</p><p>a. Shade so he didn't have to be stuck boiling under this bloody relentless sun and</p><p>b. Less screaming children. Now, he wasn't a complete heartless jerk who grew sour at the sight of a happy child, but his ringing hears had had enough.</p><p>On top of this all, his mother insisted on conversing on the most boring of subjects- why did he care that her friend's new brownie recipe was a complete success?!</p><p>Squinting, he carefully scanned his surroundings. To his dismay, there wasn't a single hot chick in sight either...<em>truly a waste of an outing</em> he thought, somewhat bitterly, to himself.</p><p>Getting up, he brushed off imaginary dust from his jeans before excusing himself from the picnic, "I'll be just a moment, I need to use the restroom."</p><p>Narcissa followed her son's gaze to the 3 port potties at the end of the lake, and crinkled her nose in distaste, "Are you sure you want to use those, sweets?" she asked, probably considering the condition of the grotesque contraptions.</p><p>Truthfully, he didn't, he just needed an excuse to walk around for a bit, so he only nodded to his mother before setting off. Once he reached the hideous modern outhouses he considered the fullness and decided he would use the dastardly thing after all.</p><p>Stepping inside, he nearly vomited at the stench that threatened to overwhelm him. Quickly shutting the door behind him, he held his breath and fumbled with the buckle of belt, desperate to get out immediately. He wasted no time in relieving himself, and by the time he was done he was beginning to feel lightheaded. Pleased with his breath holding skills, he turned around to open the door.</p><p>It wouldn't open.</p><p>One budge. Two budges. A shove. A desperate rattle on the handle.</p><p>Unable to hold his breath anymore, Draco gulped in a large breath of air, only to gag on its stench a second later. He couldn't believe his bloody luck- he was stuck in a rancid port potty!</p><p>Pounding on the door, the smell of human defecation completely annihilating any pride he once held, Draco shouted, "Someone open this door, I'm trapped!"</p><p><em> I'm Draco fucking Malfoy</em> he snarled in his head, <em>I don't get stuck if port potty's!</em></p><p>Continuing to pound on the door while still trying to get the bloody handle to turn, Draco heard what he could only figure was an angel's voice call to him from the outside.</p><p>"Is someone stuck in there?" the very feminine, airy voice called. Draco sent a silent prayer of thanks.</p><p>"Yes!" he exclaimed, relieved that he wouldn't have to stay in this shit covered hell hole for much longer, "The door is jammed, open it from the outside!"</p><p>He got no reply, so he assumed that the woman had just went straight to work in freeing him. That's a work ethic I can appreciate, he thought to himself, the closest thing to a satisfied smirk could look like when one's face was scrunched up from absolute stench crossing his features.</p><p>"Are you a ghost?" Draco gaped at the stuck door, unable to comprehend the sheer stupidity of the question he was just asked.</p><p>Absolutely furious now he shouted, "Of course I'm not bloody ghost! I'm a bloke that's about to pass out from the lack of uncontaminated oxygen in this shithole!"</p><p>He was about to continue on with his rant when he heard a click and the door opened. The beams of sunshine that stung at his eyes felt as if they were rays of light from heaven itself, jumping outside, he fell to his knees as he took in huge gulps of the fresh sweet air.</p><p>"You can never be too careful you know," his insane savior spoke from behind him, "Port potty ghosts can be particular vengeful on no specific person."</p><p>Turning around with an insult already formed on his lips, he was once again stunned into silence at the sight of the girl who saved him from his humiliating demise. A girl around his age stood before him clad in the most ridiculous outfit he had ever seen. She wore bright purple leggings that had had turtles with top hats printed on them. She had on a neon orange tshirt that sported a smiling cake that said, "I think you're sweet!". Her hip-length hair was a complete mess, with part of it held back into a bun that was held together by a pen. She wore oversized red boots and strawberry earrings. The oddest thing about her though, was definitely her eyes. They were huge, and looked as if she was staring into an alternate dimension.</p><p>Getting up from his knees, Draco turned his nose up at the girl and sneered, "A vengeful ghost would be too frightened by your insanity to do anything to you."</p><p>Feeling satisfied with his retort and only slightly guilty that he didn't thank her, Draco spun on his heel, fully intent on walking away and downing a gallon of lemonade.</p><p>Behind him he heard a dreamy giggle before she called out, "Your zipper is down!"</p><p>Face bright red Draco hurriedly zipped up his jeans, unable to believe a pretty girl had just seen him with his fly down. It was only halfway back to his parents when he realized that he had just thought of that lunatic as pretty.</p>
