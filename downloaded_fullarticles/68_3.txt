    <p>Lily Evans was sprawled across the couch in the Gryffindor common room. She had both legs dangling over the end and a Transfiguration textbook between her hands, eyes clinging to every word intently. It was a surprise when a face appeared over hers and she was met with a pair of soft lips. Lily smiled.</p><p>"How am I expected to get my studying done with you sneaking up on me like that?" When she opened her eyes James Potter was smirking over top of her. He plopped down on the couch, lifting Lily's legs to place in his lap.</p><p>"Hey, you're only going to be this young once Evans," he teased, making Lily blush. He loved to act like school meant nothing to him but she knew that was a facade.</p><p>"You can't survive a five-minute break?" Now he was kissing her. His lips on her neck, moving up towards her lips. "Not even for your boyfriend?" Lily's eyes flung open in shock. Her <em>boyfriend</em>? Lily's surroundings came to life and then suddenly she was awake, distracted by an owl's beak tapping against her window.</p><p><em>What the hell had she just been dreaming about?</em> Dating <em>James Potter?</em> Hell would have to freeze over before such a thing were possible. Lily's stomach churned as she scrambled to get the window open and let in her owl, Apollo.</p><p>"Sorry," Lily apologized as she stroked Apollo's head, tearing open the wax seal of the letter she'd had delivered.</p><p>
  <em>Lily,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>France is wonderful. Mum left after the first few days, had to get back to work, but it's better that way anyhow. Amy's been showing me all around, introducing me to her friends, taking me out to the pubs. Have I mentioned how much I absolutely fucking love being seventeen? I love it. Being officially legal is like a breath of fresh air if you ask me (perks: we will no longer be restricted to muggle bars that can't tell our IDs are charmed!)</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The only downside to so far has been Amy's lack of free time with work and all. She tries to leave me maps and lists of things to do but I always end up getting lost or confused (you know me). In more exciting news, I've recently acquired an incredibly helpful guide to show me around. His name is Anton and before you ask yes, we are a little more than just friends. Wipe that look off your face! You wouldn't be able to resist it either if you had a fit French lad showing you around Paris!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Only a few more days until I'm forced to return to reality and kiss my French romance goodbye. On the bright side, I'll be able to spend the next two months running around, wreaking havoc, with you, Mary, and Alice. I can't believe this is it, our last summer as students. Well, no matter, we'll certainly make the most of it, lots of drinking and partying to go around. Talking about parties, I'm keen for your boyfriend's little get together (which I am incredibly thankful he is throwing a day after I get home). Try not to be too glum without me, I promise to return home with loads of prezzies.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lots of love,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Marlene</em>
</p><p>Marlene McKinnon's letter left a smile on Lily's face. She'd hurried off to France to visit her older sister, Amy, the day after they'd returned home from Hogwarts. Lily had wound up missing her friend more than she ever could've imagined. It was only a two-week separation and yet, somehow those weeks had been the most complicated for Lily.</p><p>Lily found the rest of her house quiet. Her mother would be working at the hospital by now and Petunia was still away on vacation with Vernon's family. It was no bother to Lily, who rather preferred all the time to herself. She strode around her kitchen with no pants on and a <em>Holyhead Harpies</em> t-shirt that would've driven Petunia mad.</p><p>Downstairs Lily managed to shake the last of the Frosted Flakes from the cereal box, eating her bowl in front of the television. It was the same way she'd spent Saturday mornings as a kid, a comforting ritual to get her wonky morning back on track. It was rare she got such alone time in the morning when the three women of the house were usually on top of each other the most. It had been like that for the past year, ever since the passing of Lily's beloved father.</p><p>It was his armchair that Lily sat in that morning, feet curled beneath her, as she fiddled with the remote, desperate to find the right program to soothe her anxious mood.</p><p>Lily was the only one who ever sat in her father's chair. Richard Evans had been taken from his family at the age of forty-five. One morning, when it'd been just Lily and him at home, he'd gone into cardiac arrest, leaving behind his teenage daughters and doting wife. Lily's mother, Katherine, had been devastated. She'd spent the summer of her husband's death on paid leave, barely rising from bed most days, needing Lily or Petunia to remind her to eat.</p><p>Lily's dad had been her role model. She'd shared a special bond with him from a young age, the two of them on a frequency neither Petunia nor her mother could ever reach. Lily had the fondest memories of her father slipping her treats on their drives home from school.</p><p>"Don't tell your mother and sister okay?" he would instruct Lily warmly as she struggled to chew on a mouthful of toffee. "This is our little secret." It always was, too. Never once had Lily shared those moments with the rest of their family.</p><p>It was ironic, Lily thought, that her father should die from heart failure, considering he had the biggest heart in their family. He'd never been one to watch his diet. Her father had always been a portly man but it had suited him. Lily could remember her mother nagging him constantly about his eating habits but she'd never realized how serious it was.</p><p>"Rich, you have to pay more attention to your fat intake," her mother would sigh time and time again. "It's not good for you, especially as you age." Her father would simply grin.</p><p>"Would I be the man you married if I worried about my fat intake?"</p><p>"I would just like to keep the man I married around long enough for our golden wedding anniversary." Sadly, Lily's parents would never make it.</p><p>Her dad's death had come the previous summer. While her mother and sister had been out shopping, Lily had come downstairs from a shower to find her father frozen in his armchair, a cigar still burning between his fingers.</p><p>Sitting in that same chair now, all Lily could think about was that last morning with her dad. She couldn't even remember her last words to him, not that it mattered now. She looked down at her now soggy bowl of cereal and placed it aside, no longer having the appetite for it.</p><p>This summer would be better than the last; Lily had already decided that. She'd spent her time off the year before mourning the loss of her father and avoiding her friends. Lily refused to repeat the same mistakes this time around. A lot had changed in a year. She'd grown her hair out, turned seventeen, and been steadily dating one of the cutest boys in her year for the past six months.</p><p>Fabian Prewett had been a crush of Lily's for years. When he'd finally worked up the courage to ask her out halfway through sixth year, she'd been thrilled. Lily had been good friends with the Prewett twins since her first year, two of the few Gryffindor boys in her year that she could stand. Fabian was kind, funny, and strikingly smart. Not to mention, he was incredibly good-looking; thick auburn hair and warm brown eyes. He could be found often taking runs around the campus or soaring around on a broomstick during Quidditch games.</p><p>Lily had been on cloud nine, until recently. It wasn't Fabian; no, he was still absolutely amazing, It was her. Since returning home, Lily's dreams had been plagued by a familiar messy haired boy. She winced just at the thought of it, terrified of whatever unconscious thought was causing this to happening.</p><p>It wasn't as though she and James were on bad terms; they'd gotten over all of that last year. For most of the past year, they'd managed to co-exist quite cordially. James had stopped asking Lily out three times a day and she'd come to the startling realization that he wasn't really an arrogant toerag - most of the time anyway. They'd even spent the journey back to Kings Cross together, playing a round of Exploding Snaps and making plans to see each other over the summer. So what the hell was Lily doing dreaming about him?</p><p>Was she going mad? She'd have to be to ever think that the two of them could ever work. Lily Evans in no way fancied James Potter, that was a fact. The pair becoming friends was shock enough, but Lily having an actual crush on him? Hell would have to freeze over first. James may have grown up a little but he still managed to behave like a complete asshole when it suited him. Not Lily's type at all. No, Lily enjoyed the quiet brooding type, specifically her lovely boyfriend.</p><p>That was the problem, Lily decided, the lack of Fabian Prewett in her summer. She'd been so distracted recently she'd barely given her boyfriend much thought but that was all about to change. Lily would prove to her subconscious just what man she should be fantasizing about.</p>
<hr/><p>James squinted up at his friends, soaring high above his head, and adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose. Peter, Remus, and Sirius were in the air, playing a small game of Quidditch as they always seemed to wind up doing. James put his broom beneath him, shooting up to meet the rest of the boys, quaffle in hand. He looked towards Peter who was gripping onto the end of his broom for dear life, his knuckles going white.</p><p>"You alright there, Pete?" James asked. He struggled to keep the amusement off his face.</p><p>"I hate flying. Why do we always have to do things that involve flying?"</p><p>"Quidditch is a religion Wormtail, get with it," came Sirius' unsympathetic voice. Peter shook, adjusting his hands carefully around the broomstick. The four of them played for at least an hour, Peter loosening up over time as he always did. In the end, it was James and Remus that won, much to Sirius' disappointment.</p><p>"I still say that goal Wormtail got was legit!" He had been moaning on for at least five minutes now, refusing to accept he'd lost. The rest of the boys knew the drill, sharing knowing smirks as they made their way back up the field towards the Potters' manor. James could see his mother standing at the back door, hand waving to catch their attention.</p><p>"Lunch!" she called to the group, all four boys picking up the pace with the incentive of food.</p><p>"So, are we going to the party at the Prewetts on Saturday night?" Sirius asked casually. He posed at as a general question but was James he was staring at as he asked. He hated when his friends did that, acted as though they were all supposed to hate Fabian because of him. James and Fabian had always gotten along well, since they were just first years, and in fact, Fabian had done the courtesy of asking James first how he might feel about him and Lily dating. James had told him his crush on Lily was a thing of the past, but he was lying. It had just become abundantly clear in the past year that if James Potter was ever going to become appealing to Lily it'd have to be of her own accord.</p><p>"I don't see why we wouldn't," James shrugged. "The twins are always a good time."</p><p>"Have you talked to any of them recently?" Remus wondered. "The girls?"</p><p>"Marlene wrote a few days ago. Apparently, she's having the time of her life in France, shagging some French guy-" James cut off quickly as they reached his house. His mother was standing close to the door and it was best he kept information on Marlene's love life quiet around her. She and Marlene's mother, Maureen, were best friends; they had been from the time James and Marlene were in diapers; destined to become best friends as well. In fact, at one point their mothers had plotted a union between them, but neither had ever been very interested.</p><p>"Wow Care, did you make those all yourself?" Sirius teased Caroline Potter. She gave him a stern look. James' mother couldn't cook for her life. Perhaps growing up with a house elf always around did that to a person. James knew that he had been spoiled rotten by his family's house elf, Mimsy, who would do just about anything he asked her to.</p><p>"You know, Sirius, I don't <em>have</em> to feed you," Caroline reminded him in jest. While James' mother was older than most she still managed to be an absolute knockout; tall and thin, her once jet-black hair had grown streaks of grey and her smooth, freckled skin now wrinkled along her forehead and under her eyes.</p><p>She took the boys to the dining room, the table already set, and placed the sandwich platter in the middle. "Now, what am I getting you boys to drink? Is pumpkin juice fine?"</p><p>"You'd forget we have a house elf," James quipped before being smacked across the side of the head.</p><p>"Have some respect for the person who does all your cooking and cleaning, this family would be useless without Mimsy around." James bowed his head guiltily. He hadn't meant the comment to come out with such arrogance, it just had - as most words that came from James Potter's mouth did. Once Caroline had left the room again, satisfied with her fulfilment of hostess duties, James returned to his story.</p><p>"Anyway, like I was saying, Marlene is planning to become French." Sirius made a gagging sound. "Frank and Alice have that summer training program at the Auror office," James continued. "Oh, and Mary is definitely shagging Amos Diggory."</p><p>"<em>Seriously?</em>" Peter choked. "I was stuck partnering up with him in Defense fifth year, he's awful." Remus nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Mary's not an idiot, what does she see in a piece of work like that?"</p><p>"Don't ask me to rationalize what Mary McDonald does," James took a large bite out of his Ham and Swiss sandwich. Silence came over the group and then Sirius coughed, suggestively, grabbing everyone's attention.</p><p>"I think you've left out one name there, Prongs."</p><p>"Well, I don't know… it's not like we're best pals."</p><p>"But you two did seem to be getting along well last year," Peter noted optimistically.</p><p>"Yeah, I think she only came to me cursing about you once," Remus added. James rolled his eyes, leaning back in his chair so the two front legs lifted off the ground.</p><p>"Well, we'll see her at the party I guess. Anyway, I'm sure Lily Evans has spent the past two weeks thinking of nothing but her boyfriend. They couldn't seem to get enough of each other last time they parted." James couldn't pretend the words didn't hurt him to say but he shoved them out with an air of casualty all the same.</p><p>If James had to watch Lily be blissfully happy with any guy at least it was Fabian, not any of the other tools pining for her. You always knew Fabian's intentions were pure and he would never mistreat her. It hadn't been easy for James to accept, but after watching them for a few months he saw the truth. He was never going to be the guy Lily Evans needed. She wanted someone without edges or dark corners and that would never be James. He would always be a little too sarcastic and his arrogance would follow him no matter how hard he tried to erase it. The best he could do was try and be a better version of himself, less of a git. Anything other than that wouldn't be James Potter. If Lily didn't like him she never would, it was simple as that and James was slowly coming to terms with it.</p><p>"Fuck it, we're getting smashed Saturday night," Sirius decided for the four of them. "And we're all getting laid." James watched Sirius turn his cool grey eyes in Peter's direction. "Even you."</p>
<hr/><p>Mary woke up with her long, chocolate brown hair covering her eyes and a small line of drool slipping from the corner of her mouth. She wiped it away quickly, rolling onto her back so that she could stretch, letting loose a small sigh of pleasure. She was in a small, broom closet of a room, cramped into a twin-sized bed with a snoring Amos Diggory. The small line of sunlight, which streamed in between his dark grey curtains, told Mary it must have been late morning. Carefully she climbed from the bed, tiptoeing around the bedroom, scooping up the various pieces of clothing she'd lost in last night's fun.</p><p>How Mary McDonald, one of the most sought-after girls at Hogwarts, had ended up fooling around with Amos Diggory was beyond her. He was quiet, academically driven, and spent most of his days buried in history textbooks on magical creatures. Mary found magical creatures interesting but that didn't mean she wanted to spend an entire night reading about them.</p><p>Once fully dressed, Mary paused for a second, admiring the sleeping figure before her. No one paid much attention to Amos, but staring down at him now Mary couldn't seem to find anything faults. He had shaggy, light brown hair and soft features. He had more meat on his bones than most of the guys she slept with who were completely obsessed with their bodies. Mary couldn't help but admire these things about him. He wasn't terrible in bed either; it had been a shock to her.</p><p>Their introduction had come in the Care of Magical Creatures class. Mary spent the entire year complaining to her friends about how obnoxious Amos was, shooting his hand up to answer any and every question the professor asked. Mary could have pushed him into the container of Blast-Ended Skrewts. Somehow, halfway through the year, she'd been doing terribly in the course and ended up getting tutored by him. It was torture - she bickered with him most of the time. Then, one night, on the way home from the library - after a long evening of Mary sighing exasperatedly and Amos struggling to understand how she couldn't get it - he'd kissed her. She'd meant to smack him but instead, she'd kissed him back.</p><p>Amos stirred in his sleep and Mary jumped, realizing how insane she must have looked just staring at him. She stood, frozen for a moment, struggling with whether to leave or say goodbye. Finally, she stepped forward, shaking Amos delicately.</p><p>"Hey… Amos?" His round brown eyes fluttered open, glassy from sleep.</p><p>"Mary?"</p><p>She smiled, running her fingers through his hair.</p><p>"I'm heading out, okay?" He nodded. "Am I going to see you tomorrow night?"</p><p>"What's tomorrow night?"</p><p>"The Prewett party?" she said it like he must have been the only person on the planet not to know what was happening.</p><p>"Oh, um… not really my scene. I have some reading I really need to catch up on." Mary looked at Amos blankly, blinking a few times. Was he passing up a Prewett party for some reading?</p><p>"I'll see you around, Amos." She knew he wouldn't be able to stay perfect for very long.</p><p>Mary could have gone home but she wasn't in the mood. Her younger siblings would all be awake and running around, her mother chasing after them tirelessly. Mary was too exhausted to deal with that and the questions she'd be bombarded with immediately upon walking through the door. Instead, she made a quick stop at the bakery down the street from Amos' and then apparated to Cokeworth.</p><p>Mary walked down the familiar street, knocking on the house with the blue door and well-kept garden. A sleepy-eyed Lily Evans, still sporting bedhead, answered the door.</p><p>"McDonald?" she asked curiously, blinking at her friend. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>"Making sure you're still alive, distracting myself, the usual." Mary pushed past her friend and stepped inside, making herself at home. She led the way into the kitchen, passing Lily the large coffee she'd brought over - two milk one sugar, just the way she liked it.</p><p>"This smells like heaven." Lily licked her lips.</p><p>"I know you well. Here," Mary said as she pushed a croissant in her direction, "my treat." Lily must have been one of the prettiest people Mary had ever met. Mary's beauty was generic; tall, thin, dark hair, dark eyes. People were drawn to its commonness. Lily's beauty was unique. Her long, slightly wavy red hair and startling green eyes were attention drawing. It made you never want to stop looking at her. It didn't hurt that she was sharp as a whip either. Lily Evans was lethal to men. James Potter had learnt that the hard way.</p><p>"Excited for Fabian's party tomorrow?" Mary asked, picking at her own food.</p><p>"Yeah, I visited him the other day. He and Gideon are pulling out all the big guns for this one."</p><p>"Wouldn't expect any less from them." Mary was thrilled about the upcoming event. She loved a good party. It was an excuse for her to get all dolled up and flirt - and Mary loved a good excuse to flirt. Besides, it was their last summer as students and the first time all summer the whole group of them would be together.</p><p>"Hey, have you seen Mar yet?" Lily asked, her voice suddenly jumping with excitement. "She must have gotten in from Paris yesterday." Mary nodded, tucking a loose strand of dark hair behind her ear.</p><p>"She probably just went to sleep, exhausted from <em>excessive</em> Anton shagging," Mary said the last part with dramatic emphasis, which made Lily laugh so hard she spit out the coffee in her mouth.</p><p>"How does she manage to find love anywhere she goes?"</p><p>"That's our Marley, a dick magnet." Mary could see Lily pursing her lips together hard to hold in the laughter and she smiled proudly.</p><p>"It'll be so nice to see Alice though, won't it? She and Frank took these summer internships and we never see them anymore!"</p><p>"They might as well already be Aurors." Mary hated that it felt like their last big summer was being wasted. Shouldn't they be fighting to stay together? Wanting to spend every night having sleepovers, shopping, and braiding each other's hair? The braiding might have been a bit excessive but Mary felt it necessary nonetheless. She felt robbed of their last summer holiday together.</p><p>Last summer had been awful, with Lily losing her father. No one had known what to do or how to comfort her. Lily was the glue to the group and without her, they were lost. The girls had been distraught, trying to figure out what to do to fill the void Lily's father had left in her life. Mary wasn't sure if they'd ever succeeded.</p><p>"You have to promise me we're going big tomorrow night," Mary begged. "Seriously, you, Marlene, Alice, and me altogether. Lil, let's do a big sleepover, just like we used to!" Lily looked hesitant but Mary's big, pleading, puppy dog eyes seemed to draw her over.</p><p>"Okay, okay. I think a sleepover can be arranged." Mary jumped out of her seat with excitement.</p><p>"Marlene is going to be so happy!" She couldn't wait to throw her arms around her bony little blonde friend for the first time in two weeks.</p>
<hr/><p>It was eleven AM on a Friday and although most normal people were awake by this time, Marlene McKinnon knew James Potter would not be. She made her way up the Potter's front path, towards the tall gorgeous home, which had green vines climbing up its red brick walls. Marlene rang the doorbell, a bag of presents hanging from her wrist.</p><p>Her curly blonde hair was gathered into a high ponytail and her face was clean of any makeup so that her newly obtained freckles were clearly visible. Marlene's skin had tanned just a few shades darker during her three-day trip to the South of France and it gave her a healthy glow.</p><p>Mrs Potter was the one to answer the door. A large smile spread from cheek to cheek when she realized it was Marlene waiting on her front step.</p><p>"Hello, sweetheart!" She opened her arms, Marlene jumping into them. "How was your trip?"</p><p>"Wonderful." <em>And filled with lots of sex</em>, Marlene wanted to add.</p><p>"And your sister?"</p><p>"She's doing great. She really loves her job over there." Caroline nodded with approval. Marlene had never been so happy to see someone in her life. Over the years she'd grown to see Mrs Potter as a sort of mother figure, being there for her in the ways her own mother couldn't be. "Oh! I almost forgot…" Marlene rummaged around in her bag for a moment before producing a small, navy, jewellery box. "<em>Ta-da!</em>" Caroline gasped.</p><p>"Oh, Marlene! You didn't have to do this."</p><p>"It was screaming your name," Marlene shrugged. Truthfully, she'd spent days searching for the perfect gift for Caroline Potter. Inside the box were two lavender pearl earrings that went perfectly with a necklace Marlene had remembered seeing Caroline wear.</p><p>She heard the sound of footsteps above her head and then Mr Potter appeared, walking down the large spiral staircase that took up most of the entry hall.</p><p>"Marlene McKinnon!" he called out warmly. "How was France?"</p><p>"Fabulous. Think fast!" she exclaimed, tossing a box in Alec's direction. He caught it with ease, reflexes just like his son's, opening it up to find the nice striped tie Marlene had purchased him on her visit.</p><p>"Do you think there's still enough time to convince Maureen to trade kids?" he joked with Caroline, making Marlene smile proudly. "This is great, Marlene, thank you."</p><p>"Another to add to that collection of yours."</p><p>Alec nodded, smiling in his wife's direction. "Should we get going?"</p><p>"Yes, off to work for us Mar, I wish we could visit more." Marlene gave Caroline another tight hug.</p><p>"We will, soon! James is upstairs, right?" Caroline nodded.</p><p>"Yep, him and Sirius both. See if you can get them up and fed."</p><p>"Now that's a challenge I'll accept," Marlene said with a wink, turning towards the stairs.</p><p>James's bedroom was on the third floor, his own little oasis. It was huge, the house's attic, which his parents had renovated for him before he left for Hogwarts. The outer wall had two large windows so that the room was always awash with natural light. Otherwise, the decor was to James' taste, Quidditch posters everywhere, a desk filled with scribbled on parchment and empty ink pots, a couch littered with clothing. Regardless of the sometimes questionable odour, It was Marlene's favourite room in the house.</p><p>She tiptoed up the attic stairs and opened the bedroom door to find just still snoring in his queen sized bed. Marlene could've shaken him awake peacefully but that wasn't really their style. Instead, she bolted towards the bed, jumping up and down over James to wake him up.</p><p>"<em>I'm home! I'm home! I'm home!</em>" Marlene cried as James groaned below her. After a few seconds, she collapsed beside him, planting a big, sloppy, kiss on his cheek. They often played the role of siblings; in fact, many people at school had mistakenly assumed they were related. Had their mothers had their way, they would have been married the minute it was legal. Luckily, their platonic feelings for each other had made that impossible.</p><p>"Wake up you lazy lump, I've got presents for you." That got James moving a little faster. He reached for his glasses, lying on the bedside table, and sat up in bed.</p><p>"You look different…"</p><p>"I'm tan!" Marlene enthused. it was a very exciting thing, especially considering it was nearly impossible for her to tan on a regular basis. She handed James his gift, but, before she could even watch him open it she was tackled down by Sirius.</p><p>"McKinnon's home!" he shouted, despite Marlene's protests. He kissed the side of her face the way she had James' and she cried out with disgust. "I hope there's another gift in there for me," he said, winking at her. Marlene rolled her eyes but produced one anyway. She knew that when James got a gift Sirius needed would need something as well. They were children. Marlene brought James a new book on Quidditch and Sirius a comfy black sweater.</p><p>After she'd made them sufficiently happy with presents they were forced downstairs so that Mimsy could whip up some breakfast.</p><p>Have you visited anyone else yet?" James asked. The three of them were sitting around the kitchen table, growing hungrier by the second as Mimsy made them all pancakes.</p><p>"Nope, you're my first stop."</p><p>"You just couldn't stay away, could you McKinnon?" Sirius said in his sleaziest tone. Marlene stuck her tongue out at him.</p><p>"You two are going to the Prewett's party right?" They nodded. Marlene was excited to know everyone was going. She knew James hadn't been in the highest of spirits at the end of the school year. He'd been forced to spend the last half of sixth year watching Lily Evans fall head over heels for Fabian, all the while playing the role of her friend. It had broken Marlene's heart. It was also the most selfless thing she'd ever seen James do.</p><p>"I heard a rumour that Penelope Frasier is single again," Marlene noted casually, her eyes planted on the plate of food in front of her.</p><p>"Penelope's single?" Sirius was practically drooling. Marlene glared at him.</p><p>"She's not really a one night stand kind of girl." Marlene and Sirius shared a glance and then both turned to look at James.</p><p>"I don't even know Penelope Frasier," he said defensively, his mouth full of pancakes.</p><p>"Well get to know her! She's really great and you know I wouldn't just say that. Besides she's smart, funny-"</p><p>"-Really, <em>really</em> fit," Sirius added. Marlene could have torn his head off. Why did James keep him around again?</p><p>"Right, well… that too. Anyway listen, I know you won't admit it but you've been moping since I left, haven't you?" Marlene pointed her fork at James accusingly. "I'm not blaming you, I'm just saying, you're a great guy, Potter, and you've come a long way in the past year." James smiled gratefully. "I just don't want you to feel like it was all just for her… maybe she was just the one to get the juices flowing."</p><p>"Thanks, Dumbledore," Sirius muttered as she finished.</p><p>"Seriously though James, I <em>will</em> murder him."</p>
<hr/><p>Lily's home was bustling with estrogen as her friends began to show up one after another. Mrs Evan was downstairs in the kitchen preparing snacks for them all. Lily hadn't been planning on dressing up much but when Alice and Mary had arrived they'd practically fainted upon seeing what she was wearing.</p><p>"Lily, is this some kind of sick joke?" Alice asked. She held her head in pain dramatically. Lily was wearing a simple blue cotton sweater and ripped jeans. Neither of her friends seemed very pleased with this choice. Lily hadn't felt much need to dress up considering it was her boyfriend throwing the party, and why did she need to look like she'd spent hours getting ready anyway?</p><p>"Evans, this party is going to be brimming with hot, well-dressed ladies, all pining after your adorable boyfriend. Is this really what you want to wear to say 'be jealous of me?'" Lily looked down at her clothing choice unsurely now.</p><p>"I am a genius," Alice assured them, "because I went shopping before showing up here, of course, I knew you'd pull something like this…" She fiddled around in her tiny purse, which was much larger inside than it appeared, and produced a shopping bag. "Voila!" Alice tossed it in Lily's direction.</p><p>Alice herself looked beautiful. She was wearing a pair of skinny black ankle jeans, an oversized black sweater, and open-toed large black heels. Lily admired her choice of colour. On anyone else, the outfit might have looked ridiculous, but on Alice, it was the height of fashion with her bright red lipstick and short pixie cut.</p><p>"Al, this is a slip, not a dress!" Lily complained</p><p>"You are wearing that!"</p><p>"Of course it's green." Lily groaned. Why was she always forced into green? Yes, the colour looked great on her but the leprechaun jokes got old about fifteen years ago.</p><p>"Because you look fucking great in green, now put it on!" Lily rolled her eyes but did as her friend instructed anyway, slipping out of her clothing of choice and into the tight and uncomfortable dress. It was a short curve-hugging, deep green lace dress with spaghetti straps.</p><p>"I look ridiculous," she fretted, pulling at the ends of it.</p><p>"You look like you're going to be the most gorgeous girl in the room," Alice assured her, looking proudly at her friend. "Do her hair, Mary! You're always great with hair."</p><p>The truth was, Lily, didn't really want to do her hair, or put on makeup. Really, she would've rathered slip back into her sweatpants and spend the night at home with her friends, possibly some popcorn, and a really good, tear-jerking film. None of her friends really understood movies, except for Mary, but they'd put up with them from time to time to appease their muggle friends.</p><p>"There," Mary announced proudly. She'd gathered Lily's thick red hair into a neat bun on the top of her head. "Fabian is going to die when he sees you."</p><p>"Is Molly going to be there?" Alice asked from the edge of the bed. She had a handheld mirror in one hand and a mascara brush in the other.</p><p>"I highly doubt it, she's got two young kids at home and she's ready to give birth to her third any day now."</p><p>"Wow… how many little Weasleys do you think we can have running around this country?" Lily shrugged, turning back towards her vanity mirror, fiddling with her hair a little bit. Mary had made the bun so tight Lily felt like the skin was being pulled back on her face.</p><p>"Where is Marlene?" Alice pouted. "I've been excited to see her all day!"</p><p>"Just like McKinnon to make us all wait for her." Mary plopped down on the bed beside Alice now to stick on her heels. Lily couldn't pretend she wasn't desperate to have Marlene back around; it was just so easy to talk to her. Marlene wouldn't judge her but she wouldn't soften the picture for Lily either, she was straightforward and yet the most caring person Lily had ever met.</p><p>"Should we leave without her?" Lily suggested uncertainly. Like magic, there came a tap at her door. Her mother stepped in, smiling at the group of them.</p><p>"I have some snacks for you guys." She carried in a tray, placing it down on Lily's desk by the window. "Also, you have a very pretty blonde friend waiting to see you." Everyone in the room cried out happily and then, from around the corner, came Marlene, a huge grin plastered across her face.</p><p>Lily could have cried she was so happy to see her. Marlene looked much of the same but she was tanner than she had been the last time Lily saw her. She seemed well rested as well; the usual bags under her eyes had disappeared. She carried a big bag in her hand and then proceeded to move around the room and give each of her friends a present.</p><p>"I couldn't go to France and not bring you guys gifts!" Lily loved her for it. She'd gotten her a gorgeous golden-chained necklace with a little leaf on the end of it. Lily loved it, she never wanted to take it off.</p><p>"I missed you so much, Marley," she said, throwing her arms around her friend and breathing in the familiar vanilla bean scent she carried everywhere. Lily wanted to sit her down on her bedroom floor and pour her heart out right then and there but she knew it wasn't the right time.</p><p>Who's ready to party?" Mary called out, the girls all hooting back with enthusiasm.</p>
