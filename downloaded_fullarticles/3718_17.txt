    <p>"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!" </p><p>"Avada Kedavra!"</p><p>James' eyes flew open. He couldn't see anything, where was he? He opened his eyes to scream but only managed a shallow cough. There wasn't enough air. There was a strange taste in his mouth and in his nose-- something foul and dirty and rotting. The damp air carried the scent.</p><p>He tried to sit up but something hard and smooth was on top of him. It was all around him. Trapping him. Like a box. </p><p>Frantically, his trembling hands wandered around his body. He felt a cold and hard object next to him. He gripped it with his hands and pulled as hard as he could. He heard a scattering sound, almost like glass breaking, and was able to pull the object in his lap. </p><p>He tried to turn around but barely had enough room to bring up his knees, yet alone turn. The object in his hand proved useless. It wasn't strong enough to bang against the ceiling of whatever box he was in. </p><p>He swallowed a couple of times before he tried to yell. </p><p>"Help me! Help me, please." James's voice came a little louder than a whisper. </p><p>He wanted to cry, but he needed to get out. There was something that he had to do. He had to look for someone. They were in danger!</p><p>He moved his legs and banged them at the edge of the box. Nothing moved. He tried it a couple of more times and something that felt like dust settled on his face. His breathing quickened and he began to bang and cry against the walls of the box. </p><p>"Somebody help me! Where am I?" Nothing he did freed him from his prison. He couldn't see or smell anything around him, except for the darkness and rot. He touched the object on his stomach again, hoping it might be useful, but his fingers landed what felt like something human. </p><p>He couldn't breathe as he examined the object in his hand more closely. He felt five bony little fingers. One finger had a ring. Probably a gold ring with an engraving that said To My Lily, Your James. </p><p>It was quiet in the coffin for several seconds as James Potter took in and understood where he was and who was beside him. Then, all hell broke loose. He threw himself at the smooth, wooden cover, clawing and banging until his fists and nails were bloody. He screamed and screamed as much as much as he could, the stench of death thick in his throat.</p><p>James, James, you want to get out of here? A female voice whispered in his ear. </p><p>James stopped moving. "Lily," he whispered. </p><p>James, please stay with me? The voice begged. He could swear he could feel the woman's warm breath in his ear. He turned his head around but he couldn't see anything in the bleak darkness of the coffin. Was Lily actually alive?</p><p>"Lily?" He tried again, coughing. "We have to get out of here. We have to..."</p><p>They had to do something. What was it? It was something really important to both of them. </p><p>Harry. </p><p>It was as if a spell had been flung at his stomach. Harry, his son. </p><p>"Harry? Are you here?" The thought of his sweet, innocent little baby in this hell of death and decay made James gag, but he had nothing to bring up. </p><p>James, where's our son? Lily's voice asked. </p><p>"Harry!" James's hands again wandered over the coffin. He began to sob when he felt Lily's dead, decaying corpse. His beautiful wife. His whole body shook as he waited to find a little baby body. </p><p>James, where is Harry?</p><p>"I don't know! Harry! We got to find Harry, Lily." James's voice could barely whisper. </p><p>The three of us must be together, James. </p><p>James went back to pounding and scratching his way out of the coffin. He needed to find his son! He was choking and gagging on the thick, nasty stench around him. </p><p>I found him, James. He's here with us. Lily said happily beside him. </p><p>"No!" </p><p>There was a large explosion and James Potter knew no more. </p><p>------</p><p>As soon as he felt the cool, sweet air cleanse his lungs, James wanted to open his eyes. He could only open them for a few seconds a time. He experienced, what he later would find out, several hours in a series of snippets: the moonlight bathed headstones, the musky taste of dirt in his mouth as he struggled to lift himself up but collapsed, voices around him screaming and yelling, Albus Dumbledore's dumbfounded expression, and finally, waking up in the hospital wing. </p><p>He knew that he was at Hogswarts because he could recognize the hospital wing with the identical beds, the astringent smell of medicinal potions, and crests of all four houses displayed proudly on a nearby wall. </p><p>James, James.</p><p>He sat up, his heart pounding. "Lily, where are you?" He looked around but couldn't see any part of his wife.</p><p>James, where is Harry? The feminine voice asked as clear as if a woman was standing right next to him. But he was alone. It sounded like Lily but it also didn't. There was a darkness to her voice that never existed in his wife's.</p><p>"James, James Potter?"</p><p>James looked up and saw a teary-eyed Albus Dumbledore. "My dear boy, it's a miracle."</p><p>He blinked around in confusion. "Albus? What happened?"  </p><p>"A miracle, a real miracle, my boy." The rest of his words faded into the background as James lost focus in the conversation. He continued looking around, his eyes glazing over the people around his bed. He absentmindedly noticed that the people around him looked teary-eyed, including Professor McGonagall and Madame Promfrey. Dumbledore kept speaking and looking urgent and apologetic. Sirius' name came up as did Lily's. James noticed all this but it slipped from his mind before it could register and make sense. </p><p>James, where's Harry?</p><p>"Where's Harry?" He asked, abruptly and loudly. </p><p>It became quiet around him. James suddenly felt tired but he didn't want to go to sleep. He needed to find Harry. He frantically craned his neck around the people now surrounding his bed. Oh my Merlin, he left Harry back in the box with...</p><p>"Lily, where's Harry?" His voice was stronger now, so he was able to raise his voice so much that the people around him flinched.</p><p>"James, Lily isn't here. Are you seeing her?" Madame Promfrey asked softly. </p><p>"Where's Harry?" He became more frantic, craning his head around the people moving closer to the hospital bed.</p><p>"Calm down, Mr. Potter. We'll get Harry to you as soon as possible. Severus, do you have the potion?" Dumbledore spoke to someone outside of James's eyesight. He looked relieved, then the man spoke to James again. "You're going to take a little rest, James. When you wake up, everything will be sorted out."</p><p>Someone with cold, thin hands held his nose closed. When he opened his mouth to breath, a foul tasting potion was thrust between his open lips. He saw Snape's ice cold, black eyes before he went to sleep.</p><p>The next time James woke up, he struggled to keep his wits around him. He saw from the tentative and strained smiles on the his visitor's faces that he had failed some type of test. He had to pass this one.</p><p>In the hospital wing and in a calm voice, Dumbledore told him that he had been dead. Lily died on that fatal night when Voldemort came to visit them. Harry was alive and well, he's with Lily's relatives. </p><p>"Petunia? You put my little boy with that hag?" James scoffed and rolled his eyes. He suddenly noticed that Snape was standing near a few feet away from his bed, glaring at him. </p><p>"Was it your idea, Snivellus? I bet you liked that, some wizard-hating bitch raising my son." He saw Promfrey flinch at his tone and words. Professor McGonagall shook her head at him. He closed his eyes, he was failing this test. He needed to convince them that he was well, so that they could bring Harry to him. </p><p>"Anyways," he spoke slowly, trying to calm himself down. "What is he doing here?"</p><p>"Professor Snape works at the school now, James. He's been a great help in making the potions to help you get better," Dumbledore said smoothly. </p><p>'He's been drugging you, James. We have to find Harry.' Again, the female voice echoed in his ears. He clenched his fist, so he didn't start looking for its source. </p><p>"Where's my son? You said he'd be here when I'd wake up. Where is he?"</p><p>Silence. Dumbledore looked apologetic. "We need to run some more tests, James. We need to look after Harry, make sure he's safe."</p><p>'They think you might hurt Harry, our little Harry.'</p><p>"He's safer with me than with that spiteful magic hating Petunia. You know what's the last thing she said to me? She said I hope you and my good for nothing sister die. And guess what happened? Huh? What happened? We did die! And my little boy is with her! Bring him to me, I need to see him!" He couldn't control himself anymore. He thrashed around, suddenly ropes were trying him to the bed. He almost dislocated his shoulders, trying to get free. </p><p>"James, James! Calm down!" Promfrey said.</p><p>"Let me go! I need to go and find him!" </p><p>"Pro-- Dumbledore, I can't hold the spell for much longer. He's too strong!" James surged violently towards Snape's strained voice. </p><p>"Let go of me, you son of a bitch! You always wanted Lily, you were jealous of me!" James laughed and laughed as the people around him tried to calm him down and press him onto the bed. </p><p>"Promfrey, give him a calming draught!" He heard Dumbledore shout.</p><p>James continued, "But who could love an ugly little worm like you?"</p><p>That greasy head of hair leaned down. The low silky voiced hissed near his ear,"I hope you never recover your sanity! That you stay like this, a raving lunatic!" </p><p>It was the opening James was waiting for. With Snape's concentration briefly split, James felt a slag in the ropes. He pushed forward, smacking his forehead against Snape's nose, who hadn't managed to pull away fast enough.</p><p>James felt power surge throughout his body, and he mentally released it. The people around him were flung back by an unseen force, leaving James free to get up and run as fast as he could towards the hospital wing's exit. </p><p>Harry! I'm coming for you! He thought happily.</p><p>We are coming for you, the female voice sweetly reminded him. </p><p>He ran, ran, and ran until he couldn't feel Hogwart's wards. Then, he disappeared with a loud crack.</p>
