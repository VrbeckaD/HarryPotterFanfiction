          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in The Order of The Phoenix's headquarters, members Mundungus Fletcher and Sturgis Podmore are talking.</p><p>Sturgis smiled. "You know they're wrong about you, Dung. The Order I mean."</p><p>Mundungus asked, "How so?"</p><p>Sturgis told him, "You're not the shady, not to be trusted guy they think you are."</p><p>Mundungus smirked. "Oh, I may be the shady guy, but I can be trusted if you get on my good side; Sturg."</p><p>Sturgis said, "I'm not going to 'keep an eye on you' for The Order, even if that means that I get reassigned."</p><p>Mundungus beamed, "That's a nice sentiment, but I hope that you don't get reassigned."</p><p>Sturgis grinned. "I hope so too."</p></div>
