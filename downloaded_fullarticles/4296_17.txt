    <p>“Where’s Draco?” Pansy asked. “Why isn’t he down for breakfast yet?”</p><p>There was an alarmed look on Pansy’s face. Her shoulders were tensed, her eyes kept flickering towards the doors as she fiddled with her fingers on the side of her thigh.</p><p>“He was still sleeping by the time I left the room. I didn’t dare wake him up since he threatened to hex me the last time I did.” Harry explained as he took a sip of his morning pumpkin juice.</p><p>“Are you sure he was asleep and that he wasn’t-” Pansy abruptly stopped talking. “Oh no.”</p><p>Pansy ran off out of the Great Hall and before Harry could ask what was going on, he ran off after her.</p><p>“Pansy, wait!” Harry panted as he finally caught up with her.</p><p>“Treacle Tart!” Pansy yelled at the portrait to get inside the 8th year common room.</p><p>Harry saw the look of fear and determination in Pansy’s eyes as she ran up the stairs to the boys’ dormitory searching for the room. The room he shared with Draco upon returning the Hogwarts.</p><p>Pansy busted into the room and pulled Draco’s curtains back.</p><p>“Draco!” She bawled out. “Potter, call McGonagall and Madame Pomfrey! Now!”</p><p>Quick to think, Harry casted his patronus.</p><p>“Expecto Patronum!” Harry called out. “Headmistress, get Madame Pomfrey and head to my room...Draco he’s-”</p><p>Harry looked at Pansy whispering to Draco to breathe. Tears were falling down her face.</p><p>“I think he tried to kill himself.” He finished as he sent the message off.</p><p>
  <em>Dead. Dying.</em>
</p><p>It was getting cold all around the room. Harry began to have trouble breathing. He couldn’t hear Pansy anymore. He couldn’t look at Draco lifelessly laying on his bed. It was too much. So he ran. Ran out of his room. Out of the 8th year common room. Death was surrounding him again.</p>
