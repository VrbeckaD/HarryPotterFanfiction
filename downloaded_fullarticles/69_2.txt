    <p>Despite Mr. and Mrs. Dursley's many attempts to make him so, Harry Potter is not a normal boy. He is far from it, in fact, perhaps even the farthest from normal he could be. The Dursleys can’t stand it.<br/><br/>Everything that ever goes wrong in the Dursley household is blamed on Harry. Even the things that are physically impossible for them to be his fault. Most recently, the glass disappearing on a boa constrictor's aquarium at the zoo, allowing the snake to escape. Harry was beyond confused as to why that could <em> possibly </em> be his fault. The glass just vanished. Like magic. But it's not like Harry is a wizard.<br/><br/>Except he is, or at least, that's what that giant, hairy man, Hagrid, told him. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon even went along with it. Of course, not until after they argued that Harry couldn't possibly be a wizard any longer as they made him live normally for so long. The entire time he was waiting to wake up and find out it had all been a dream, or to have Uncle Vernon call Harry a “bloody gullible little boy, go get the post and make sure not to burn the breakfast”.<br/><br/>It’s hard for Harry to believe that witches and wizards are real, and apparently so are hundreds of other strange creatures Harry believed to be a myth, like dragons, which Hagrid had claimed were “severely misunderstood” and he “always wanted a dragon”. There’s so much that Harry doesn’t know about, and as Harry stands in <em> Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions </em> getting fitted for his school robes and talking to another wizard boy his age, he thinks that he’ll never be able to learn it all and he’ll be thrown out of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for being too far behind the rest of the students.<br/><br/>"Quidditch?" the blonde boy asks, snapping Harry out of his terror-filled thoughts.<br/><br/>"Quidditch?" Harry repeats in an even more questioning tone than that of the boy.<br/><br/>"Quidditch," the boy says back before breaking their one-word conversation. "Surely you know what Quidditch is. Do you play?"<br/><br/>"Um... no," Harry answers, still just as confused as before. What in the world could Quidditch be? Has he found yet another thing he’ll have to learn before school starts on September the first?<br/><br/>The boy frowns for a second before his smirk reappears. "Well, I do. I'm going to be on my house's team. At least, I will be after first year. Shame they won’t let us first years have a broom. Do you know what house you'll be in? <em> I'm </em> gonna be Slytherin. Everyone in my family was. What about your family? Where were they sorted?"<br/><br/>Harry's eyes widen in his confusion. The combination of the boy changing topics almost every sentence and the fact that Harry still can’t comprehend that he is a wizard makes it hard for him to keep up with the conversation. "I don't know."<br/><br/>"They <em> are </em> like us, aren't they?"<br/><br/>"You mean, a witch and wizard?" Harry asks, and the boy nods his head in affirmation. "Yeah. They were."<br/><br/>"Were?" the boy asks, but before Harry can respond, Madam Malkin finishes fitting Harry's robes and shoos him away.<br/><br/>In the crowded streets of Diagon Alley, Harry looks back through the window of Madam Malkin's and sees the blond boy still inside, watching him with a curious glint in his eyes and a smirk playing on his lips. Suddenly, Harry feels himself back into something large and solid, and he turns around to see Hagrid grinning down at him, holding a snowy white owl in a cage.<br/><br/>"There yeh are Harry! I got summat fer yeh birthday. Yeh can have pets at Hogwarts, so I got yeh an owl." Hagrid says, motioning towards the cage.<br/><br/>Harry's eyes widen and he smiles up at the large man. "Oh- thank you, Hagrid! Thank you so much, but you didn't have to. Thank you!"<br/><br/>"Don' mention it," Hagrid grunts out, a smile just visible through his wiry beard. "Now, come on, we need ter get yeh a wand."<br/><br/>Harry glances back in the window of Madam Malkin's one last time, but the boy is nowhere in sight. With a shake of his head, Harry starts to follow Hagrid through the crowd, which is much easier than when Harry was alone, as the witches and wizards part to let the giant man through. Soon enough, Harry and Hagrid have arrived outside of a store with a sign reading <em>Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands Since 382 BC</em>. Upon entering the shop, Harry is met with shelves upon shelves of rectangular cases. Harry assumes there was probably some sort of order to it at one point, but now it just looks like they were shoved anyplace they would fit.<br/><br/>"Excuse me?" Harry calls out weakly. When there isn't an answer, he calls out slightly louder, "Hello?"<br/><br/>This time, an old man with skin almost as white as his hair comes out from somewhere in the stacks of wands. His misty eyes seem to glow when they land on Harry. "Ah, Harry Potter. I knew it was about time I would be seeing you."<br/><br/>"I'm sorry?" Harry asks, confused as to how the man knew his name and why he was expecting him.<br/><br/>Instead of answering, the man sees Hagrid and moves towards him. "Ah, Rubeus! It's been a while since I've seen you. Your wand was sixteen inches, oak, rather bendy, yes?"<br/><br/>"Uh, yes," Hagrid says.<br/><br/>"However, I suppose they snapped it when you were expelled."<br/><br/>Hagrid ducks his head down, looking rather embarrassed. "Yeah."<br/><br/>"A shame, that is," the man says, shaking his head before he suddenly turns back to Harry. "Now, let's get your wand, shall we? Which arm is your wand arm?"<br/><br/>The man, who Harry now assumes to be Mr. Ollivander, takes out a tape measure and holds it up, looking at Harry expectantly.<br/><br/>"Oh, well, uh, I'm right-handed?" Harry says, not quite sure if that's what Mr. Ollivander is asking.<br/><br/>Mr. Ollivander then instructs Harry to hold out his right arm, and he starts measuring from his shoulder to his fingertips before going off into the stacks of wands, looking for one he thinks will be suitable. The tape measure, however, keeps measuring away. It measures different portions of Harry's arm, around his head, even between his nostrils, before Mr. Ollivander tells it to stop as he walks back.<br/><br/>In his hands, Mr. Ollivander holds a slender, dark red case, in which lies an elegant looking wand with engravings of leaves spiraling their way around the sides. "Let's try this one. Beechwood with a dragon heartstring core, nine inches, nice and flexible. Try it out, give it a little wave."<br/><br/>Harry takes it, but before he can even begin to move it through the air, Mr. Ollivander snatches it back.<br/><br/>"No, no, not that one," Mr. Ollivander mumbles as he hurries away. It's not long before he returns with another wand. "How about this? Ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, quite springy."<br/><br/>This time, Harry brings the wand swishing down through the air, but when the end result is a vase shattering and several wand cases flying around the room, Mr. Ollivander, again, takes the wand away.<br/><br/>Again and again, Mr. Ollivander hands Harry a wand, seeming more delighted each time, and again and again he takes the wand away from Harry, barely even letting him test it out.<br/><br/>It seems like a miracle when something finally happens and Harry realizes what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for.<br/><br/>"I wonder if maybe... here, holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple. Try it out."<br/><br/>Harry doesn't even have to try it out, however. As soon as the wand is in his hand he feels a comforting warmth shoot from his fingertips up his arm and throughout his body. When Harry waves it a little, red sparks spray from the wand tip as if they are fireworks celebrating the wand having finally claimed Harry. Harry smiles down at the wand, feeling triumphant and elated that he had finally found one. Hagrid also seems excited, letting out a loud whooping noise which startles Harry's new owl as well as Harry and Mr. Ollivander.<br/><br/>Mr. Ollivander continues to smile, however, now he mumbles, "Curious... curious... how very curious," as he puts Harry's wand back in its box and wraps it in brown paper.<br/><br/>Harry's smile slips from his face, quickly replaced by a confused expression. "I'm sorry, but what's curious?"</p><p>"It's curious that this wand has chosen you. It chose you when it's brother chose the one who tried to kill you."<br/><br/>Harry's confusion only deepens. "What do you mean? It's brother?"<br/><br/>"This wand was made with Phoenix feather core. The Phoenix whose tail that feather came from has only ever given one other feather. The wand made with that feather chose You-Know-Who all those years ago. It was with that wand that he gave you that scar on your forehead. It is curious that this wand has chosen you, that you are destined for this wand, when it's brother gave you that scar."</p><p>Harry looks down at the wand, now in its case and wrapped in brown parcel paper, and he remembers that green flash of light that he now knows was from the spell that killed his parents. He feels something strange that he can't quite place, but it's gone almost as quickly as it had come, and Hagrid takes the parcel from him as he digs in his pockets to bring out his wizard money to pay Mr. Ollivander for the wand.</p><p>"Thank you, Mr. Ollivander," Harry mumbles out as he and Hagrid leave the shop with a jingle of the bells hanging above the door.<br/><br/>Back amongst the crowds of Diagon Alley, Harry follows Hagrid through the Leaky Cauldron and back out into Muggle London. Harry stays silent, sorting through his thoughts, until finally he decides to start asking Hagrid about everything that's been worrying him while they eat burgers in a small diner while waiting for their train back to the Dursleys’.<br/><br/>"Hagrid," Harry starts, still trying to decide which question he should start with. Finally, he settles on asking one of the simpler questions floating through his brain: "What's Quidditch?"<br/><br/>"Blimey, Harry! I keep forgettin' you don' know abou' the Wizardin' World!" Hagrid exclaims after dropping his burger. The few people in the diner with them turn to give them curious looks, but they quickly seem to get bored and look away. "Quidditch is on'y the mos' popular sport to witches an' wizards. You go' fourteen players, all flyin' on broomsticks, tryin' to score points by gettin' a ball through one o' the three hoops on either side o' the field, while also tryin' to catch the Snitch. I can' really explain it tha' well, you'd be better off jus' watchin' it."<br/><br/>"Oh," Harry says, feeling slightly upset that he didn't know about the most popular sport in the Wizarding World. "What about houses, and sorting? What does that mean?"<br/><br/>"Well, when yeh firs' get to Hogwarts, yeh'll be sorted into one o' the four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Wha' house yer in will decide yer class schedule an' yeh'll live with the other studen's in yer house. It's like yer family at Hogwarts, yer house is,” Hagrid replies, then, seeing the fear in Harry’s face and realizing that Harry is worried about the sorting, Hagrid adds, “but don’ worry, the sorting is more of a personality test than anythin’.”</p><p>Relieved, Harry relaxes his shoulders that he didn’t quite notice were so tensed. “What house were you sorted into?” Harry asks.</p><p>“Gryffindor. Same as Dumbledore,” Hagrid says proudly, puffing out his chest slightly when he adds, “The house o’ the brave. Yer parents were both in Gryffindor, too.”</p><p>Harry smiles at that, feeling a surge of pride knowing his parents were brave. “I hope I’m in Gryffindor.”</p><p>“Any o’ the houses would be good, ‘cept Slytherin. I can’ imagine bein’ sorted in Slytherin.”</p><p>Harry tilts his head to the side, remembering that the boy he met in Madam Malkin’s said his entire family was in Slytherin and he wanted to be too. “What’s wrong with Slytherin?”</p><p>Hagrid’s face turns dark and he leans toward Harry conspiratiorially. “I don’ know of a single witch or wizard who wen’ bad who wasn’ in Slytherin. <em> You-Know-Who</em> was in Slytherin durin’ his time at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Harry’s spine tingles and he shivers. Was that boy evil? He didn’t seem like it, but then again Harry didn’t have that long of a conversation with him. It would be impossible to tell someone’s motives from a short conversation only held to pass the time. Harry supposes he’ll just wait until he gets to Hogwarts to find out there.</p><p>“Well, would you look a’ the time!” Hagrid exclaims suddenly and Harry’s attention snaps from his thoughts to the clock on the wall of the diner. “It’s abou’ time we head fer yer train back to the Dursleys’!”</p><p>Just like that, Harry’s mood drops. Another month with the Dursleys before he gets to go to Hogwarts, before he gets to be part of the magical world again.</p><p>“Don’ worry, i’s on’y a month before yeh start school. I remember I was ready teh start righ’ away, too,” Hagrid says merrily as he pats Harry on the back, misinterpreting Harry’s sudden sadness. Harry doesn’t bother to correct him, however, and instead helps Hagrid count out the money to pay for the meal when the waitress comes to give them their check.</p><p>All the way back to the Dursleys’, Harry and Hagrid endure strange looks from the other passengers, directed mostly at the owl, but also at the overlarge man and the many oddly-shaped parcels. Harry doesn’t quite notice, as he is too busy worrying about what will happen at school. He has never fit in at school before, Dudley and his gang made sure of that, but with him not knowing a thing about the Wizarding World... he doubts he will ever get to find out what it <em> is </em> like to fit in.</p><p>Luckily, for the rest of his summer holidays, the Dursleys take to ignoring Harry, which allows him to read through some of his books in order to prepare. It doesn’t do much good, unfortunately, as Harry quickly becomes confused and has to put his books down frequently, allowing himself a short break to try and process whatever information he has just read. The downside to this is that the more breaks he takes, the more worried he becomes about the start of term.</p><p>And then, it is only the day before term starts when he remembers he would have to <em> get </em> to Hogwarts before he’d even have to worry about being thrown out. He racks his brain for what Hagrid had said he would have to do, when he finally finds a train ticket mixed in among his school things. A train ticket leaving from London. Harry quickly goes downstairs and finds Uncle Vernon sitting in front of the television set, watching his favorite evening news program.</p><p>“Uh… Uncle Vernon?” Harry questions, more than slightly nervous. He is beginning to think that the Dursleys had all gone deaf and blind to his presence until finally Uncle Vernon gives a grunt to show he is listening. “Um… I was wondering if you could take me to London tomorrow? It’s just that... I need to catch a train at 11 o’clock in order to get to school.”</p><p>It takes another moment for Harry’s uncle to answer.</p><p>“Whatever, boy. We’re going to London tomorrow anyways for Dudley to get that bloody tail removed.”</p><p>Harry’s heart leaps as he makes his way back upstairs. That’s one problem out of the way. Now he can worry about how much he doesn’t know about being a wizard.</p>
