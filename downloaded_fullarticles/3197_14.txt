The interminable war had taken a turn against the Order in recent months, and Voldemort had declared himself ruler of the cowering Wizarding World. There was still a resistance, but it was weakening. <em>Harry</em> was weakening.</p>
<p>“Now, Mr. Potter,” Voldemort drawled, as he idly stroked Nagini’s head, “we shall see how strong you really are. As strong as your precious blood-traitor Weasleys, perhaps? Though none of them proved particularly strong, in the end.”</p>
