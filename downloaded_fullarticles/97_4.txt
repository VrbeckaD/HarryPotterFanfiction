    <p align="center">ONE.</p><p align="center">THE PHONEBOOK. OBVIOUSLY.</p><p align="justify">Of the many and varied people Harry may have expected to show up on the door step of his quiet little apartment at a quarter past eight one cool March morning, Petunia Dursley was not high on the list. She wasn’t even in the top ten. To be perfectly honest, she wasn’t on the list in the first place.</p><p align="justify">But there she was, all the same.</p><p align="justify">Harry blinked, readjusted his glasses and blinked again. “Er- hello?” he said, warily.</p><p align="justify">Harry found himself wondering a great many combination of possibilities, including whether he was still asleep, having some sort of mildly unpleasant dream or if perhaps someone was pulling a distasteful prank for some Merlin forsaken reason. He wondered if a Boggart had been let loose in the building, if maybe his greatest fear had transformed into his skinny, pinched mouthed Aunt without him knowing. He wondered, perhaps a little fantastically, if this was some kind of bizarre coincidence: if Aunt Petunia had knocked on his door expecting- oh, who knows- some old biddy member of her book club and was just as surprised to find her shaggy haired, disgraceful nephew standing in the doorway as he was to find her.</p><p align="justify">“Harry.” She greeted, simply and then scowled a fraction. “You need a haircut.”</p><p align="justify">Right, so not that last one then.</p><p align="justify">“Thanks.” Harry said, still bewildered. “Aunt Petunia, what are you doing here?”</p><p align="justify">The scowl tightened. “Waiting for you to invite me in, of course.”</p><p align="justify">“Right.” Harry said, shaking his head a little as if to clear it. “And why would I do that?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s past eight o’clock in the morning, Harry.” Aunt Petunia said, as though that explained everything. “Well within the bounds of acceptable visiting hours.”</p><p align="justify">“For a hospital, yes.” He frowned. “This is my flat.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes.”</p><p align="justify">“Where I live.”</p><p align="justify">“I imagined so.”</p><p align="justify">“What are you doing here at my flat where I live?”</p><p align="justify">The scowl emerged in its full force. “Waiting to be invited in of course!” she huffed. “Honestly is this how you greet all your visitors?”</p><p align="justify">“Only the ones who show up unannounced at eight o’clock in the morning.” Harry snapped back, irritably.</p><p align="justify">Aunt Petunia tilted her head sharply with intent. “Well?” she demanded. “Are we going to discuss personal business on the doorstep where anyone can snoop and pry?”</p><p align="justify">Harry really, deeply considered slamming the door in her face at that moment but couldn’t quite manage it. Call it a leftover shred of fear remaining from his childhood or his own finely honed instincts for self preservation but something told him the action would not be worth the consequences. So, reluctantly, he held the door open and watched Aunt Petunia tentatively step inside his flat, her pale blue eyes flitting from surface to surface as though she couldn’t decide what to comment on first.</p><p align="justify">The sight of her was jarring. He hadn’t spoken to his Aunt, Uncle or cousin in years. The last time he’d had any contact was a small note announcing the marriage of Dudley Andrew Dursley to some woman named Karen which had been accompanied with an even smaller note in Petunia’s neat scrawl that he was not welcome to the wedding. He’d sent a box of Chocolate Frogs as a gift, only partly in spite. Seeing his aunt again dredged up their last meeting, in the house at Privet Drive, in that nameless look they’d exchanged before she had left with Vernon and Dudley to go into hiding and he had begun what had seemed to be a doomed search for Horcruxes. The feeling was oddly itchy, like a too tight woolly jumper.</p><p align="justify">At present, the two of them stared at each other with apprehension.</p><p align="justify">Harry ran a hand through his hair anxiously. “Can I get you a glass of water?” he asked, uncertainly.</p><p align="justify">Aunt Petunia scoffed. “Certainly not.”</p><p align="justify">“How about some frogspawn then? A nice cauldron of phlegm?” Harry asked, sarcastically.</p><p align="justify">Petunia’s glare was icy. “On second thought, perhaps just a glass.”</p><p align="justify">Thankful for something to do, Harry moved about the little galley kitchen, taking his sweet time. “So…how’s Uncle Vernon?” he called out, wondering if she was here to report a death in the family.</p><p align="justify">“Quite fine.”</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Drat. Not Vernon then.</em>
</p><p align="justify">“Still working?”</p><p align="justify">“Hard as ever.”</p><p align="justify">“And Dudley?”</p><p align="justify">“Harry, I will not have a conversation screaming from the other room.” Aunt Petunia huffed, impatiently.</p><p align="justify">Harry peered at the window over his sink and wondered what it would be like to plunge headfirst through it. <em>Maybe later, </em>he told himself as he re-emerged from the kitchen with a glass of tap water. She took it gingerly but didn’t condescend to drink it.</p><p align="justify">Another long pause and Harry threw a hand out haphazardly towards his couch. “Do you want a seat?”</p><p align="justify">Aunt Petunia took a long look at the furniture in question before she decided it was worth the risk and took a seat at the furthest edge. “Thank you.” The words looked like they physically hurt to say.</p><p align="justify">“Actually, Aunt Petunia, how did you find me?” he asked, the last dregs of sleep fading from his head. Despite his rather short career, his time as an Auror was marked with the arrest of several high profile criminals, many of whom would have delighted in having his home address. That wasn’t even mentioning the countless ex-Death Eaters and their families who may have thought to seek revenge so many years after the end of the War or, Harry’s personal favourite, the endless list of journalists and tabloid reporters who clamoured after him at all hours of the day and night, desperate for a scoop or an angle or a quote or a story. Assassins, all manner of Dark wizards, paparazzi – his address was meant to be privy information. He wondered how Aunt Petunia had discovered it.</p><p align="justify">“The phonebook, obviously.” Aunt Petunia replied with a careless wave of her hand.</p><p align="justify">Harry let his eyes close. “Obviously.” He repeated. He rubbed his forehead, feeling nowhere near refreshed enough to ask but with no other method of recourse. “Aunt Petunia, why are you here?”</p><p align="justify">“I just said, I looked up your name in the phonebook.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not in the phonebook, Aunt Petunia.” Harry said patiently.</p><p align="justify">“Nonsense. How else did I find you?”</p><p align="justify">“That’s not- look, what’s going on?” he asked, frustrated. “Why did you look me up?”</p><p align="justify">Aunt Petunia didn’t reply but Harry took the opportunity to look her over for the first time, somewhat surprised at what he saw. His memory had filled in some gaps that were visible now that the shock had faded: her hair was greyer than it had been, the wrinkles more pronounced around her pinched features. But more importantly, she looked pale and tired. Her blouse was slightly wrinkled; there was a scuff mark on her shoes. Her hands shook a little, holding the water.</p><p align="justify">“Aunt Petunia, what’s going on?” Harry repeated, this time a little concerned. “Did something happen?”</p><p align="justify">Petunia set the glass down on the smudgy coffee table and straightened like a bow string tensed for action. “As I’m sure you know, your cousin has been married for several years.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, he mentions it every time we catch up for bingo.” Harry said, impassively.</p><p align="justify">Aunt Petunia’s nostrils flared with disapproval. “Well he has a child. A girl.”</p><p align="justify">Harry felt his mouth quirk a little at that. “Duddikins’ a dad, huh?” he said, throwing up a silent prayer for the poor kid. “That’s- that’s really something.”</p><p align="justify">The older woman looked a little soft as well. “Yes, well. We’re all very proud, obviously Dudley is a wonderful father.” She boasted.</p><p align="justify">“Obviously.” Harry repeated, thinking about the boy who used to dunk his head in the toilet and beat up kids on the playground for fun.</p><p align="justify">“He’s so devoted,” she continued, starry eyed. “Just absolutely adores little Clementine.”</p><p align="justify">“Clementine Dursley.” Harry acknowledged it wasn’t the worst name he’d ever heard.</p><p align="justify">“And she’s such a bright thing too, very clever already, you can just tell she’ll be quite something when she’s older-”</p><p align="justify">“Aunt Petunia, this is great, really.” Harry interrupted. “But I think maybe a letter could’ve done the trick?”</p><p align="justify">She glared at him, all joy gone from her face. “There’s been a development.”</p><p align="justify">“A development.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes.”</p><p align="justify">“With Dudley’s kid?”</p><p align="justify">“With your second cousin,” Aunt Petunia said pointedly. “Yes.”</p><p align="justify">“Right and this concerns me, how?” Harry said, confused.</p><p align="justify">Petunia shifted slightly in her seat, uncomfortable; a sight at which Harry felt only a twinge of satisfaction. “There was an incident.”</p><p align="justify">He waited but no details were forthcoming. “An incident.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes.”</p><p align="justify">“A development and now an incident? Merlin, it’s a wonder you haven’t called the BBC.”</p><p align="justify">Aunt Petunia looked furious. “How dare you make light of the situation-”</p><p align="justify">“A situation too?” Harry said, mockingly. “Aunt Petunia, what’s going on? Why are you in my flat at-” he checked his watch. “-eight thirty on a Sunday morning when we’ve spent the past six years wilfully ignoring each other?”</p><p align="justify">“Because it concerns you and <em>your sort!</em>” she snapped.</p><p align="justify">“My sort?” Harry echoed, warily. “What do you mean? Has something happened to the baby? Is she okay?” He wasn’t heartless enough to tease his aunt about the life of her only granddaughter.</p><p align="justify">Aunt Petunia huffed. “She’s fine as we can tell, considering she spent three hours last week on the ceiling!”</p><p align="justify">Harry paused, double checking his hearing. “Hang on, she spent-”</p><p align="justify">“Three hours!” Aunt Petunia wailed, looking caught between desperation and rage. “We tried to get her down and she just crawled away, laughing at the top of her lungs like it’s all some sort of game!”</p><p align="justify">“Dudley’s kid was on the ceiling.” Harry repeated, aghast. “Why?”</p><p align="justify">“<em>That’s what I wanted to know from you!</em>” Aunt Petunia howled, settling on rage apparently. “We never had this sort of trouble with you until you were a little boy! No colour changing wallpaper, no bathtubs overflowing with bubbles, no <em>babies stuck to the ceiling!</em> So what I’d like from you, Harry Potter, <em>is an explanation!</em>”</p><p align="justify">The pieces clicked into place so loudly Harry could hear the <em>clack </em>reverberating inside his skull, revealing the completed image, as unlikely as it was. “Dudley’s daughter is magic.” He said, astonished by the very words. “She’s a witch.”</p><p align="justify">Petunia looked insulted. “She’s a Dursley!”</p><p align="justify">“She’s a <em>baby!</em>” Harry knew his mouth was open but he couldn’t figure out the button to close it. “What- I don’t- are you <em>sure?”</em></p><p align="justify">“Am I sure that we spent what was otherwise a lovely Wednesday night chasing my two year old granddaughter around the ceiling?” Aunt Petunia trilled. “Quite!”</p><p align="justify">“I’ve never heard of magic at that sort of age.” Harry muttered, sitting back in his seat with a thump.</p><p align="justify">“So then?” Aunt Petunia demanded. “What’s your solution?”</p><p align="justify">“<em>Me?</em>”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, you! You’ve obviously done this so <em>fix it!</em>”</p><p align="justify">“I’ve done this?” Harry repeated, bamboozled by the concept. “Aunt Petunia, I’ve never even met her!”</p><p align="justify">“No but you grew up with Dudley! We let you in to our home, raised you, clothed you, fed you and all that time, you were, were- <em>infecting </em>our son!” Aunt Petunia accused, viciously. “I want it fixed! I want it fixed now!”</p><p align="justify">“Fixed? Petunia, magic’s not a disease!” Harry snapped, indignantly. “I didn’t infect Dudley, he just inherited whatever gene it was that gives people magic and <em>that </em>he inherited, might I add-”</p><p align="justify">“Don’t you <em>dare-”</em></p><p align="justify">“-from you.” Harry finished, sharply.</p><p align="justify">She had gone pale and trembling all over, rage in her features but very real fear in her eyes. He had never seen his aunt so worked up, not in all the years he’d spent at Privet Drive. Even watching them leave their home with strangers, Aunt Petunia had never appeared so afraid as she did now, at this: yet another a witch in the family and this one, her fault.</p><p align="justify">“There must be a solution.” She said after a long moment, lips barely moving. “Your sort can do all manner of things, unnatural and twisted and impossible, there <em>must </em>be a cure for this.”</p><p align="justify">“I told you, it’s not a disease.” He said, bluntly. “There’s no fix for it.”</p><p align="justify">“There must be something.” She said, desperately. “Please, Harry, there has to be something-”</p><p align="justify">“Here’s a thought,” Harry said, his anger overwhelming his sense of pity for a moment. “Don’t lock her up in a cupboard.”</p><p align="justify">His aunt took the words like a physical blow. “We would <em>never-</em>” she said, in a low voice.</p><p align="justify">“Yes. You would. In fact, you did.” Harry cut her off, rising to his feet. “I think I’d like to you to leave now.”</p><p align="justify">Petunia followed suit, her sense of manners not allowing her to do otherwise. She left the water glass untouched on the table. At the door though, she stopped and turned to him urgently. “Come with me.” She said, suddenly. “To Dudley’s.”</p><p align="justify">“Why would I do that?” Harry said, wearily.</p><p align="justify">“He doesn’t know what he’s getting in to.” Petunia said, desperately. “He doesn’t understand-”</p><p align="justify">“He grew a tail when we were eleven and watched Aunt Marge blow up like a balloon and float away when we were thirteen, I think he understands a bit about magic.” Harry said, sarcastically.</p><p align="justify">“Not like this.” Petunia shook her head. “He’s scared and confused.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s Dudley, he’s confused about stop lights and how letter boxes work too.”</p><p align="justify">“He’s your cousin whether you like it or not!” she shrieked.</p><p align="justify">“And Clementine is your granddaughter whether you like it or not!” Harry retorted, feeling attacked.</p><p align="justify">“He’s family! So is she!” Petunia insisted.</p><p align="justify">“Funny way to treat family, isn’t it?” Harry snapped but the words had tugged on the last dreg of sympathy he had for his cousin, a place not so much deep inside Harry as it was distant and unused, a place which housed the words <em>I don’t think you’re a waste of space</em> and the realisation that the Dursleys were the only biological family he had left in the entire world. A family which now included a little girl named Clementine who was, through no fault of her own, a witch.</p><p align="justify">Sensing he was softening, Petunia removed a piece of note paper from her purse and pushed it into his chest. “Dudley’s address. They’re a back house.”</p><p align="justify">And with that, Aunt Petunia left his flat and her nephew in quiet peace once again.</p><p align="center">*                *                *                *                *<br/>*                *                *                *</p>
