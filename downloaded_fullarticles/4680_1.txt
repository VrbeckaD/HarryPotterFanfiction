    <p>“Harry, seriously mate, why can’t you just ask her? She’s driving us all crazy over it. It’s all she can talk about.” Ron groaned, his face buried in his crossed arms. Harry was sitting across the cafe table from his friend, his eyebrow raised in annoyance. </p><p>“I don’t care if she makes a billboard about how much she wants me, I’m not going to ask her.” Harry said firmly, but his statement was only met with confusion.</p><p>“A what?” Ron asked, head slightly raised, a perplexed look adorning his face.</p><p>“Nevermind. The point, is that, as I’ve already said, many times, I already have a date. No matter how much she kicks and screams I will not be taking Ginny to the Memorial Ball.” Harry said.</p><p>“Maybe we’d all believe that if you actually told us who it is. For all we know it could be a blast-ended skrewt!” Ron huffed. </p><p>“I can fully assure you that it is not,” Harry chuckled, “you’ll know who it is if you show up. Besides, we both know Hermione’s simply dying to get out of the house.”</p><p>“True, ever since she’s taken leave from work she’s been really restless. Gone through all the books in the house! Honestly, that woman.” Ron muttered fondly.</p><p>“See! It all works out. Now, why don’t you go tell your sister to stop sending me owls. It’s getting really annoying.” Harry said exasperatedly.</p><p>***********************************</p><p>The frenzy surrounding the Ministry’s Memorial Ball started as soon as the invitations were sent out. This was the second one, so while the pain wasn’t as fresh, it was still present in all those that had lost loved ones. Harry, of course, received an invitation, and as all included a plus one, many fans were vying for his attention. The most annoying however happened to be Ginny Weasley, who seemed to be having delusions when it came to her and Harry’s relationship, or lack thereof. </p><p>She sent owl after owl to Harry, demanding his attention, whining about why he hadn’t been the attentive man she needed, etc… It frustrated Harry to no end, especially due to the fact that he was already happily in a relationship with someone he loved very much. The ball had provided them a way to make their relationship public. And, due to the identity of his lover, the memorial ball was the perfect place to do so, as it was all about renewal and forgiveness. </p><p>Lucius Malfoy had been on the opposing side during the war, but he had been desperately trying to save his son and wife. He had tried to wreck the least amount of damage that he could, but he still did some horrible things. As soon as his family was free, Lucius and Narcissa had separated, finally able to leave their arranged marriage behind. When the public had turned away and cast judgment on the family, Harry had been there to defend them, and later he and the Malfoy lord started to discuss the horrors that they had faced. One thing led to another, and then they found themselves falling for each other, with no will to stop what they were feeling after such a life of hardships. Their love for each other flourished, and they could no longer see a future without the other in it. </p><p>So when the gold embossed invitation arrived during their breakfast, they decided that they would let the public know of their relationship. Life was too short for secrets.</p>
