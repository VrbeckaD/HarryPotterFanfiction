<p>"I've got a special present for you pet. I hope you like it"</p>
<p>Antonin Dolohovs face stood in the light of her cell window, he only came around when it was time to eat. Her stomach rumbled audibly. She felt the slither of the chain attached to her shackles shorten. The small door to let food in opened and a bowl floated down placed just near enough to where she could reach. Her wrists were held back by those chains, but just long enough for her to bend down her head to eat.</p>
<p>When she would Finish, he would leave and the chain would grow again in length to allow her to rest her head. A kindness that wasn't always available to her.</p>
<p>Before coming to be with Dolohov she was shackled to a wall, the back of her head forced to press against the unforgiving stone. The lack of movement caused horrible cramping and muscle spasms. It didn't help she still experienced pain of after affects from the Cruciatus curse.</p>
<p>When she was given to Dolohov he gave her a cell bigger than what she had been used to, when they first tried to break her.</p>
<p>She now had a cot that lay on the ground, with a threadbare blanket and a actual blessed toilet instead of a bucket... though it was more like a hole in the floor she had to crouch over, that would vanish anything left behind, still better than what she had. It was perhaps not a good thing for her to feel thankful towards her captor, But she was.</p>
<p>She had spent what she assumed around two years here. Without being physically maimed, tortured or left with more Scars not even touched. </p>
<p>Before she was with bella and Rodolphus, being tortured and made to watch others be tortured. </p>
<p>Roldulphus loved stripping flesh from bone. It was his favorite activity. he especially liked doing this to muggle women and children. Would taunt her saying how one day it would be her on his table. And while they were bleeding out. He would imperio them.. and make them do unimaginable things...  Things she didnt want to think about for fear of bringing back nightmares. Bella would cackle in the background. The shrieks of these women and the insane giggling of Bellatrix lestrange still haunted her at night, but less as the time had gone by, best not to chance it. She shook the thoughts from her head, and put up a mental barrier. Out of sight, out of mind.  </p>
<p>Her current prison was a strange but welcome change of pace, a luxury even.. How many years of the lestranges she couldn't say. she believed that she was around 25 years of age now, they lost a long time ago, maybe a few stragglers left, she didn't understand why she was still alive. </p>
<p>She shook herself of the thought and brought herself back to the present. No need to wonder about her age at a time like this.</p>
<p>Surprised by the wonderful smell coming from the bowl. It was unlike what she has become used too. It wasnt a weekend, she knew that simply because an established routine had been made. Certain food on certain days.</p>
<p>Of course.. it was only an assumption that those days were weekends a simple observation.</p>
<p>the food was better tasting. Most days she would get a basic broth of what she assumed to be chicken,  and a stale corner of bread she would let soak in the broth before eating. Broth and bread, sometimes if he was feeling generous he would give her a pumpkin juice instead of water... she didn't like pumpkin juice, but after eating only a certain amount of food she would savor it.</p>
<p>The other meals she was given were all broth based , she assumed tomato and maybe beef, the tomato had veggies sometimes and, the beef broth had little strips of meat. She assumed that  Saturday was beef broth day and Sunday was tomato soup day. </p>
<p>Because she couldn't use her hands she was always given a straw, the broths weren't ever too hot for her to sip from  And the food would disappear after a certain amount of time, then her chains would lengthen again. </p>
<p>It was a surprisingly good fare today she blinked at it with surprise . It was oatmeal, with what looked like a cream of some type on top, the bowl smelled like cinnamon and maple.</p>
<p>Compared to what she had been given in the past.. this was a delicacy. Hermione was immediately suspicious...but She was also starving.</p>
<p>The smell of the oatmeal making her salivate. She glanced back up to find him leering at her. His eyes dark and glinting.</p>
<p>" Eat it pet"</p>
<p>He ordered,  she sniffed the oatmeal. It looked alright, other than the weird white viscous cream on top.. It wasn't like a milk or cream that she had ever seen before, how curious. It also didn't have a straw, not that one would help with eating oatmeal. '<em>He did that on purpose</em>' </p>
<p>"I won't tell you again pet"</p>
<p>his voice deep and menacing. It promised pain and humiliation if she didn't comply. He's never hurt her outright, not since the Ministry fiasco where he nearly killed her. but the threat was there.</p>
<p>Dipping her face back to the bowl, she tried to eat as daintily as she could, but that was impossible to do. It was sweet, the maple she  tasted bloomed over her taste buds it was also slightly salty, a little bitter. </p>
<p>She had to keep herself from moaning in pleasure. It tasted delicious and she couldnt help but gorge herself. Who knew when the next time would be that she got to eat like this. The white stale bread and thin broth were the only things she had been allowed to eat since being brought to him. </p>
<p>She licked the bowl clean And instantly began to regret how quickly she had devoured it. Disappointment filled her as she pulled away. She had no way of cleaning her face now, all Sticky from the remnants of creamy cooked oats. The broth didn't leave much of a mess she realized. But her stomach was content for the first time.</p>
<p>He licked his lips while watching her eat. a wicked chuckle rumbled from him. "How did you like the taste pet"</p>
<p>his deep accented voice She hated that she liked hearing it. He had a sinfully deep voice. she didn't know why he called her that. "Pet" It was like an endearment, but more.. sinister.. maybe it was his twisted way of thinking she wasn't human in his eyes. she almost wanted him to call her mudblood again, at least then she'd feel more human.</p>
<p>Clearing her throat the best she could without anything to drink she responded honestly, he would know otherwise. "It was delicious, best thing I have eaten in years"</p>
<p>he chuckled darkly at that  "do you want more" she held his gaze unsure, and confused but she swallowed the doubt she had. And nodded her head in confirmation  "Yes I would like more"</p>
<p>"Say please" his condecending tone made her cheeks flared in anger but the memories of pain not so distant flashed through her mind and stopped her vicious retort. "Please" she choked out quietly. Unable to say more than that.</p>
<p>It apparently was enough. The cell door open. She jerks in shock to look up at the hulking figure before her.</p>
<p>This is the, first time he had appeared in person in over a year. </p>
<p>She is tiny in comparison to him by a large margin. His could break her like a twig if he wanted. </p>
<p>A cloth was clenched in one hand. And the other held a cup. He stood there looming. Slowly he bent down, bringing the cloth to her face.. she flinched at first at the contact.. this was the first bit of physical contact she has had in a long while. Her body tensed as he gently wiped her face clean of the oatmeal.</p>
<p>It was soothing and those tensed limbs  loosen and unintentionally she leaned into his caress. A small 'thank you" leaves her mouth without her permission. Leaving her mortified, sitting up and looking away from him.</p>
<p>A tear threatening to fall, she was taught to always say please and thank you, by her parents, it was drilled Into her, but for her to unconsciously thank you to her prisoner. It had been years since she had even thought about her parents her kind and gentle parents. Hopefully they were still in Australia, oblivious and happy. </p>
<p>She clenched her teeth. Disgusted in herself. '<em>All you need is a little kindness and you're putty in his hand'</em> a voice that sounded like hers taunted in the back of her head. His large hand gripped her chin and brought her facing forward again, a glass of what she assumed was water is held out to her face, his hand gentle but firm held her chin, giving her no reprieve.</p>
<p>"Drink" </p>
<p>she opens her mouth at the command. She truly was so thirsty and try as she might, she couldnt get all of it into her mouth, large droplets fall onto her very old and worn shirt. but she's parched after eating the oatmeal, she continues to drink. </p>
<p>It was most likely a potion who knows what, but she still drinks till it is gone. The cloth is back sitting lightly against her face and she couldnt help but slightly nuzzle it. It was so warm against her cold cheek, the cell is damp and no matter what she did, she couldn't get warm.</p>
<p>"That's my good malyshka" he rumbled softly in his native tongue. his attentions were strange and confusing but more than welcome after the torture she had endured, '<em>humans require physical contact, humans are social animals. S</em>he had assumed that was why he hadn't touched her, ever, no physical contact at all. Leaving any interaction for cleaning up to an elf. An elf what would not respond to anything she said.</p>
<p>She wondered if that was how he planned to make her crack. It was a well known fact that people could go insane from lack of touch. </p>
<p>Maybe he was switching tactics. And if that were the case. She might be in some trouble. '<em>You always were the teachers pet, love being praised for doing a good job, you got off on it' </em> the voice taunted. As much as she would of liked to disagree with it.  She couldnt because it was true in a sense. Being at school getting good grades, being praised, it was her bread and butter. </p>
<p>Hermione clenched her jaw, what was he trying to pull. When would he finally turn against her and hurt her like the others had, she hoped He  would. It would be better. She could deal with that. It made sense. the man that once tried killing her, almost succeeding, why wouldn't he try to hurt her again. </p>
<p>He gave her the first nightmare she had ever had and she still had them,  still better dreams than with bella '<em>dont think about it'</em>  the burning pain from the scar on her chest. She would dream about burning up from the inside, her old potion Professor  Professor Snape, told her of the curse and what it was supposed to do, forcing potions after potions down her so she wouldn't die. After learning about what curse had originally meant to do. And even before. Nightmares of that night haunted her for months after.</p>
<p> Even now she could feel it her scar.  It heated up in his presence. It was a sick irony, that the only thing that keeps her warm is when he is near by, she missed that warmth, craved it. Even now the heat radiating off of him. Made her want to hug his body close to hers, and use him as a blanket. </p>
<p>Dolohov stroked her head a few times before getting up. Taking the bowl and cup with him, he gives her a long lingering look, a smile curling to one side of his mouth. Before turning around and leaving through the door. </p>
<p>She watches him leave. Her eyes following him , the door closes with a heavy thud and the sound of a lock turning echoes through her empty cell. She shivers, all warmth evaporating. She hates herself for wishing he would come back. </p>
<p> </p>
