This is not nothing.” Angry Severus took hold of Harry´s arm and dragged him into the bedroom to his wardrobe.<br/>“Well, do you have anything to say?” He snarled.<br/>“That wasn´t me, I don´t think that baby blue is really your color.” Harry said trying to hide his smile, well he wasn´t successful.<br/>“Do you think this is funny? All my clothes look like this, except from the things I am wearing.”<br/>“Sev, it is just a prank calm down and then we will find out who did it.” Soothingly he slid his arms around his partner. <br/>“I want revenge.” Severus said almost pouting, almost a Severus Snape does not pout.<br/>“You will get revenge and I will help you.”<br/>“If you really did not do this than it has to be Albus.” Slowly an evil smirk spread across Severus´ face. “I think Albus´ lemon drops might go through some modification.”<br/>Grinning Harry walked to the door. “The lemon drop delivery arrives every Friday in the kitchen, I will talk to Dobby.”</p></div>
