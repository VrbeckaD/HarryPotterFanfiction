    <p>Four days.  Four days since his team had been attacked in their cells by a group of dangerous fugitives, since Wordy’s back had been sliced up by his vicious half-brothers, and since Greg himself had been forced into his Animagus form, which had promptly come within a hairsbreadth of dining on his own team.  Starting with an already injured Wordy.</p><p>His nightmares featured the events after his forced transformation in glorious Technicolor, complete with the utter <em>hopelessness</em> on his constable’s face as he’d advanced, practically drooling for fresh meat.  That was the worst part.  Greg could <em>remember</em> how he’d felt as he moved in on his teammate and friend, could <em>remember</em> how his gryphon side hadn’t even been willing to differentiate between male and female human, much less treat them with respect.</p><p>Sure, his gryphon side had stopped once it realized Wordy was Pride…or was that Flock?  But respect?  Hah!  His gryphon side had seen his team as helpless and weak, not as the capable officers Greg knew they were.  If it had been up to his gryphon side, Ed and the rest would have stayed in the cell block, which meant Ed never would have ended Moffet’s rampage.</p><p>Not that he really remembered that part…</p><p align="center">* * * * *</p><p>
  <em>He snarl-hissed at the flying metal bird, demanding that it come down and fight him.  As it turned, a human with a burnt amber sheen around it appeared, its hands coming down on the metal bird as it yelled words he couldn’t understand.</em>
</p><p><em>Darkness lashed out, sending the human tumbling out of the sky, straight towards him.  There wasn’t time to leap aside before the human hit him.  Magic roared and he squalled, trying to get away.  But the magic held him fast, locking his muscles in place as </em>his<em> magic flowed back into him, stronger than the last time he had felt it.  The human yelled, launching something golden skyward, but he didn’t truly hear it as the magic swirled, settling into bone and blood, flesh and fur.  As the last of it sank home, he felt something bubbling under the surface of his mind.  He squalled again, straining to stop whatever it was, then he collapsed under the weight of his own mind and soul, gasping for air as he regained his human awareness.  His conscience.  For a second, he simply laid there, getting his breath back and wondering how he’d gotten from the cell block to McKean’s landing pad.  Then memory crashed down and he fled, leaving his team to deal with the aftermath of Moffet’s second attack on McKean.</em></p><p align="center">* * * * *</p><p>He still couldn’t believe what he’d <em>done</em>, couldn’t trust <em>himself</em> after his own actions, but Wordy had pulled him out of the darkness he’d been sinking into, grabbing hold and refusing to let Greg drown in self-hatred.  The rest of his team had pitched in too, coming up with several rather creative ways to interpret their Sergeant’s animal vocabulary and refusing to let Greg sulk once Wordy had coaxed him out of the room he’d initially fled to.</p><p>Madame Locksley, realizing that Greg could hardly go <em>home</em> while he was still trapped in gryphon form, had offered up her own family’s estate as a place to stay until a Healer trained in healing magical animals could travel to Toronto.  Greg had, therefore, been present as Locksley finally introduced her nephew to her daughter.</p><p align="center">* * * * *</p><p><em>Sam’s expression was wary, uncertain, and braced for the worst.  Greg positioned himself next to his constable, deliberately lying so that his shoulder brushed Sam’s shin and his head was in just the right spot for Sam to pet him.  While it had felt extremely…odd…the first few times, Parker had come to accept that there were simply different rules now that he was an animal.  It didn’t hurt that the petting was actually rather pleasant, though he suspected his team was having a much harder time with the idea than </em>he<em> was.</em></p><p>
  <em>The sound of footsteps brought both sniper and gryphon’s heads up.  Madame Locksley appeared first, shepherding a girl with long blonde hair into the room and to a comfortable seat.  The girl refused to look up at her guests and Greg felt Sam’s hurt sting against the restored ‘team sense’.  But something was wrong; Greg could smell the girl and she smelt of shame and fear, not scorn or disdain.  The gryphon rose to his feet and padded closer to the couch, trilling inquiry.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Startled, the girl looked up and both officers froze.  Scars marked her face, large and cruel; scars from being staked out under the hot desert sun and left until she was almost dead of thirst.  Sam swallowed hard as he understood; he was looking at another one of Moffet’s victims.  “Hi,” he managed, “I’m Sam Braddock.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Incredibly, her face brightened.  “Sam Braddock?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“The goblin who found me asked if I was related to you,” the young witch confided shyly.  “Am I?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The gryphon churred in laughter and Sam chuckled quietly.  “I think we are.”  Looking up at Madame Locksley, Sam added, “I’m your cousin…”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh!”  Embarrassment lit her scars up like fire and she ducked her head again.  “I’m Jane.  Jane Locksley,” she admitted from behind her hair.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sam pushed himself up from his chair and walked right up to Jane, holding out a hand.  “Nice to meet you, Jane.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Confusion shone on Jane’s face until her mother whispered to her, then she reached up and tentatively shook Sam’s hand.  Then her eyes dropped to Greg, who’d followed Sam’s movement and now sat at his constable’s side, his tail curled around his paws and talons; he resisted the urge to preen and stayed focused on the cousins.  “Is that a griffin?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yes.  No.  Kinda,” Sam fumbled.  Jane gave him a bewildered look and Greg squawked a chortle.  “Um…”  Sam rubbed the back of his neck.  “This is my Sarge, Greg Parker.”  Parker bowed his head and purr-thrummed a greeting.  “He got forced into his Animagus form, so…”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Madame Locksley stepped in smoothly.  “Sergeant Parker will be staying on the estate until the injuries he sustained in his form can be treated,” she informed her daughter.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Jane’s expression as she regarded the gryphon was wary and very uncertain.  “Is he safe?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Greg winced, but Sam’s voice steadied and turned unshakably confident.  “He’s good,” the sniper told his cousin firmly.  “You can trust him with your life, Jane.  I know I do.”</em>
</p><p align="center">* * * * *</p><p>Idly, Greg checked his wings and tail over, preening askew feathers back into place and tugging one loose feather free.  Much as he tried to keep his gryphon instincts down, as long as he was trapped in his Animagus form, he couldn’t suppress <em>all</em> of them.  Nor could he avoid the fact that he <em>was</em> currently a meat-eater, a fact that had been driven home when the Locksley house-elves refused to serve him any meals inside the house.</p><p align="center">* * * * *</p><p>
  <em>Greg was a bit surprised when Jane tentatively invited her cousin to stay for dinner, an invitation Sam accepted without a qualm.  Once the ice was broken, Sam worked on drawing Jane out of her shell, ignoring her scars with a skill that made his Sergeant glow with pride.  The sniper would never be a negotiator like himself or Jules, but Sam definitely had his own flare and plenty of empathy towards those who were scarred, either emotionally or physically.  He’d come a long way from the uptight, impatient rookie who favored going tactical and still sported a chip on his shoulder from his friendly fire incident.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When the group entered the dining room, Greg immediately noticed that only three places were set at the table and resigned himself to waiting for his own meal.  Sam, however, stopped in his tracks, confusion in his voice as he asked, “Where’s the spot for Sarge?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Madame Locksley looked embarrassed.  “My house-elves refuse to serve raw meat at the table, Constable Braddock.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sam flicked a look at her.  “Thought it was ‘Sam’,” he corrected, right before he went on the offensive.  “And what does raw meat have to do with anything?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Jane cleared her throat, drawing Sam’s gaze while Greg wished himself under the nearest rock.  “Griffins are meat-eaters, Sam,” she explained politely.  “Our elves don’t want to clean up the mess.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Blue eyes narrowed, but Greg just slunk under the table, thoroughly embarrassed and well aware that his last few meals had ended with bits of meat and blood scattered all over the ground; gryphons, like most meat-eaters, had no table manners to speak of.</em>
</p><p align="center">* * * * *</p><p>Done with the preening, Greg shifted to a standing position and spread his wings out as far as they would go, flapping them hard and ignoring the slight throb of pain from his right wing.  No, he would never fly…and didn’t <em>want</em> to fly anyway…but he couldn’t shake the conviction that, crippled or not, he should exercise his wings and keep the muscles limber.  Another few feathers shook themselves loose as he exercised and the Sergeant retrieved them once he was done.  If nothing else, the feathers might make nice souvenirs once he was back to being human.</p><p>Carefully, Greg worked his injured wing around to inspect the gunshot wound; the injury was smaller and hurt much less, a vast improvement over how it had felt <em>before</em> the Healer had visited.  Of course, the Healer’s visit had been an experience all its own.</p><p align="center">* * * * *</p><p>
  <em>From what Ed had said on his last visit, Holleran had assigned Eddie as acting Sergeant for Team One until Greg could come back, a move Greg quietly approved of; it would make his plans easier to implement.  Ed hadn’t mentioned who was acting team leader and Parker, obviously, couldn’t ask.</em>
</p><p><em>Left alone by both the Locksleys and their house-elves, Greg ranged around the estate’s gardens and outdoor architecture, trying to keep himself busy and get used to his gryphon form.  In truth, he was hoping that he’d never get stuck in his Animagus form again, but he needed </em>something<em> to do and ‘training’ was as good as anything else.  Better, because the training let him ignore, for a little while, the increasing amounts of pain coming from his right wing.</em></p><p>
  <em>He’d just scrambled up a decent sized rock when the house-elf appeared, twisting its ears nervously as he leapt back off the rock and trilled a question.  “Mistress is being in the front garden with Healer,” the elf reported.  “Handon can be showing you, ifin yous wish.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Greg inclined his head and padded after the elf as he was led to the front of the estate where a Healer was standing next to Madame Locksley.  Even from a good dozen meters away, Greg heard the exact moment he was spotted by the wizard.</em>
</p><p><em>“Madame, that griffin is </em>loose<em>,” the Healer exclaimed, alarm in his voice.</em></p><p>
  <em>Locksley sounded amused.  “Believe me, the griffin is not a threat, Healer Reynold.  He’s been a perfect gentleman these past two days.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Parker snorted a laugh as he moved around the house-elf and bounded towards the two wizards, half-spreading his wings as he ran for better balance.  When he got close, he decided to show off and pushed off in a jump to land neatly in front of the pair, his wings snapping back together on his back as he landed, paws and foretalons close together.  After a moment, he relaxed, shifting his paws to stand at ease as he inspected the Healer from head to toe.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The wizard’s skin was swarthy with long hours under the hot sun and he wore robes that were cut generously for ease of movement and easy clean-up.  A wizarding world veterinarian, Greg would bet a month’s salary on it.  His black hair was going gray on the edges and brown eyes were inspecting Greg in turn.  The most curious thing, from Greg’s point of view, was the swirl of the man’s magic over his skin and robes.  It was a forestry brown that reminded Greg of woodland animals, with a hint of the more exotic around the edges.</em>
</p><p><em>Parker still hadn’t gotten used to actually </em>seeing<em> others’ magic and it had stunned him when he’d finally realized it </em>was<em> magic he was seeing.  Even the most magic-less members of his team had sheens of light around them to his vision, a phenomenon he intended to ask about once he was back to normal.  Though he already had a theory that it had something to do with his </em>nipotes<em> and their Wild Magic.</em></p><p>
  <em>Reynold cleared his throat, still looking uncomfortable with the gryphon’s freedom.  “Well, now,” he stumbled, “Now that my patient is present, shall we begin?”  Without waiting for a reply, the wizard flourished his wand and cast a spell.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Greg snarl-hissed as he was paralyzed, his body slumping to the ground.  Instinctively, he fought the magic, straining to move.  In the background, he heard Madame Locksley shout something, then the spell evaporated and the gryphon rolled back to his feet, backing away from the Healer fearfully.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The wizard was indignant.  “You can’t expect me to treat a griffin without the proper precautions, now can you?” he demanded of Madame Locksley.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“He won’t hurt you,” Locksley retorted angrily.  She stepped towards Greg, extending one hand and gesturing him closer.  It took a moment, then the wary gryphon padded forward and let Locksley smooth down his bristling feathers.  It took a minute, but Greg relaxed, letting out a soft <strong>squrr</strong> as the witch tossed the Healer a superior look.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Don’t restrain him,”  Locksley ordered.  “He’s had quite enough of that lately, Healer Reynold.  He won’t fight you, my word on that.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Parker added his own rumble-trill of promise, swishing his tail and tucking his hindquarters close as he sat, careful to keep his talons curled and his lion claws sheathed.  The Healer edged closer, watching Greg’s beak and shoulders closely before he cautiously pulled the Sergeant’s right wing out to examine it.  He clucked at the deformity, then zeroed in on the gunshot wound.  It had been treated at McKean, to clean out the bullet residue and keep infection minimal, but Greg suspected it was infected nonetheless.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The next two hours were painful and grueling as the Healer cleaned the injury out again and slathered on potions to deal with the infection and lingering dark magic.  Greg restrained his responses to soft screech-growls and winces as Reynold worked, his tail lashing involuntarily at the more painful prods and touches.  When the Healer was done, Greg was relieved to note that the bandage was fairly small.  Even better, the magic on the bandage meant that he didn’t have to worry about accidentally dislodging it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, I must say, ma’am, this is the best behaved griffin I’ve ever encountered,” Healer Reynold remarked.  “Most wild animals would savage me for even a fifth of what I’ve put your griffin through.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Parker tilted his head, surprised.  Didn’t the Healer know he was an Animagus?  Or at least the Squib-born version thereof?  Locksley graciously thanked the Healer and guided him away without correcting his assumptions.</em>
</p><p align="center">* * * * *</p><p>“It won’t heal any faster, you know,” a young female voice observed.</p><p>Greg snapped around, his wings ruffling before they folded back into place.  Jane Locksley settled herself on a nearby bench, watching him as closely as the Healer had.  Parker padded closer, but stopped well short of the bench, tilting his head to the side as he studied the witch and her magic, a blue as pale as her eyes with the life and vitality of an ambitious, bright young woman to it.  Though much of her spirit was still recovering from Moffet’s actions, her magic spoke to her ability to recover and become the stronger for her experience.</p><p>“Mother says you’re a Squib,” Jane remarked quietly.  “And that your team beat her best Aurors in a competition a couple years ago.  I remember that; I told her you would.”</p><p>Parker trilled a low chuckle.</p><p>The witch smiled briefly, propping her chin on her leg as her eyes went distant with memory and pain.  “I dream about it, you know,” she whispered.  “I dream that I’m still out there and <em>he’s</em> laughing, saying that Mother should’ve known not to try and trick him.”  She stared at the ground, guilt in her eyes.  “It’s ‘cause of <em>me</em> that Mother did what she did.”</p><p>Greg edged closer, tilting his head in a listening attitude.</p><p>Jane sniffled.  “After Mother found her brother and, um, Sam, she wanted me to meet my cousin, but Father said ‘no’.  He’s very old-fashioned, like my grandparents.”</p><p>The Sergeant reared back, confused.  He hadn’t met Mr. Locksley yet…or was the male Locksley a lord?  Even so, the gryphon snuck one step closer, waiting patiently for the rest.</p><p>“Well, he’s not so old-fashioned now,” Jane hissed resentfully.  “Ran off with a witch young enough to be my <em>sister</em>.  Broke Mother’s heart and he hasn’t written at all since he left.  Mother asked me if I wanted to meet my cousin, but I wasn’t sure.  Then, on my way home from work, someone grabbed me from behind and well, I think you can guess the rest, Sergeant Parker.”</p><p>Indeed he could.  Greg nuzzled at her, trying to communicate that he didn’t blame her and he didn’t think Sam blamed her either.  It wasn’t her fault that she’d been used as a pawn against her mother, against his team.  Jane wrapped her arms around his head and neck, crying for the loss of her father, the loss of her innocence, and for the chain of events her kidnapping had kicked off.</p><p>Greg let her cry against his feathers and his fur, silently urging her to let the poison out.  Guilt.  They were both living with it and for events that they’d had no control over.  She’d been imprisoned by Moffet, while <em>he’d</em> been imprisoned by his Animagus form.  Jane Locksley would survive her guilt, he knew.  Himself, he wasn’t so sure about.  Because every time he closed his eyes, every time he dreamed, he was back there, too.</p><p>And he had no idea how he was supposed to move on when he didn’t know if he could keep it from happening again.</p>
