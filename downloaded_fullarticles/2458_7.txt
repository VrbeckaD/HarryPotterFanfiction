          <div class="userstuff"><p>Sirius dreams of a sinking ship. <br/>Dread rises in his belly, grips his throat like a cold hand. <br/>All around him, people scramble pointlessly for escape. The sky hangs heavy with grey clouds, the sea around them heaves and surges with a terrible certainty- it will claim the ship and everyone aboard it, it is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Moony. <br/>He's got to find Moony. <br/>He's got to tell him something important, but it's a dream and he doesn't know what that could possibly be.<br/>His legs are heavy, he can’t move fast enough, can’t see Moony anywhere, can’t even scream for him past the constriction in his throat.</p>
<p>He pushes blindly though the masses, his mind burning, blurring with a sort of panic that feels for all the world like the end of days.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye he spots something that turns his blood to ice. <br/>The deck is moving- roiling with a thousand rats. Shrieking and crawling over one another, and the feet of the terrified passengers.<br/>They're looking for a way out, he thinks with a removed sort of clarity. <br/>Rats will do that.</p>
<p>His stomach lurches unpleasantly, and suddenly he's sitting bolt upright in bed, covered in a cold sweat, the sheets twisted around his legs. <br/>The house is quiet and the only thing he can hear is the wind outside, sounding horribly like a storming sea.</p></div>
