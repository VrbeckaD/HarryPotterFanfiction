    <p>“Time is the longest distance between two places.”<br/>
― Tennessee Williams, The Glass Menagerie</p><p> </p><p>Harry chased the rogue Unspeakable down the corridor, not pausing when he entered a familiar room, the one where he lost his godfather. He heard Auror Robards just behind him, and he blocked the curse that was sent his way.</p><p>“It’s over!” Harry shouted at him. “You’re surrounded—you can’t escape. It’ll be best for you if you come quietly, we can talk about this!”</p><p>Unspeakable Tooley just quirked his eyebrows and raised his wand again. Harry cast a shield around him, ready for whatever came, but in one swift movement, Tooley swiveled on his feet and screamed "<em>Bombarda Maxima</em>,” at the veil.</p><p>In the space of a moment, the veil exploded into a million little pieces, inhuman shouts coming out the other side. Harry raised his shield, but tiny chunks of the veil fell down through it, and one touched his bare skin. He shouted, feeling his body ache in a way it never had before. He thought of his sons, if they would remember him, they were so young, he hoped they knew that they were wanted and loved more than anything. He sent a silent apology in his mind to Ginny and took a breath.</p><p>But it wasn’t his last, as he expected. He kept moving, he was going somewhere. It was a million times worse than apparition, Harry felt his bones re-arrange and travel through what felt like a horrifying distance, until he landed on his feet in a bedroom that looked oddly familiar.</p><p>There was a child sleeping in a wrought-iron bed, he was older than James, Harry took his wand out to light a soft Lumos to see his surroundings a little better. There was a constellation nightlight on the wall.</p><p>The boy blinked his eyes open and jumped out of bed, running over to him.</p><p>“Harry! You’re back!” he yelled, big gray eyes wide with delight.</p><p>“Err, hello,” Harry said, sheathing his wand.</p><p>“Are you not happy to see me too?” he asked, pouting his bottom lip. He was hopping from foot to foot in excitement.</p><p>“Are your parents around?”</p><p>The boy rolled his eyes. “This is their house, isn’t it? But don’t worry, I used to cry a lot when I was a baby or after I was punished so they put silencing wards on the room so they can’t hear me!”</p><p>“Right,” Harry said to that horrifying sentence and searched the boy’s face. It was so familiar. He nearly had it, it was on the tip of his tongue. He knew that face.</p><p>The boy sighed loudly, and ran around to find a toy quaffle in his room, and chucked it at him.</p><p>Harry caught it, and stared again at the boy.</p><p>“Harry, you don’t know me yet, do you?” he asked, still jumping around in boyish excitement or nervous energy or maybe both.</p><p>“I’m afraid not,” Harry apologised.</p><p>“It’s your first time then! You just got cursed in the ministry,” the boy said, a mischievous grin appearing on his face.</p><p>“That’s right,” Harry said, crouching down to the boy’s level. “Do you think you can tell me about that, mate? I’m a little lost.”</p><p>The boy nodded. “You said you’d be confused when you came to me for the first time, it’s some sort of curse from the blasted veil, but that Hermy-something is working on a cure and um, you’ll be back to where you came from soon and not to worry too much!”</p><p>“Thank you,” Harry said, feeling more disoriented than he had in his entire life. “I’m sorry that you know me and I don’t know you though.”</p><p>“Mother says you musn’t apologise, it makes you look weak like a Muggle, but it’s not like we’ve ever even met any Muggles,” the boy said and <em>oh</em>, of course Harry knew who this was. “Sirius Black, at your service,” he said with a dramatic bow.</p><p>“Harry, but you know that, I guess,” he replied, his voice only shaking a little. “So we’re at Grimmauld Place?”</p><p>Sirius nodded. “This is my room!”</p><p>It looked different without the posters of muggle women and Gryffindor posters, but Harry could almost recognise the blank canvas. “And how old are you, Sirius?”</p><p>Sirius held up 7 fingers. “And four more years till I go to Hogwarts!”</p><p>“That’s right,” Harry agreed, tossing the quaffle back to him. Sirius caught it and threw it back with gusto.</p><p>“Your face looks weird,” Sirius commented, after getting bored of tossing the quaffle around.</p><p>“That’s just my face, I’m afraid,” Harry joked, sticking out his tongue.</p><p>Sirius laughed and made his face go crossed eyed. “Are you scared? Don’t be scared! I told you what happens, you’ll go back and leave me, you always do!”</p><p>Harry sat down on Sirius’s floor, thinking that he was the one who left him, not the other way around. “I’m not afraid. Just confused. And hoping your mum doesn’t come in here.”</p><p>“She is scary,” Sirius agreed. “But she’ll never come in here, she doesn’t, she just gets the stupid elf to drag me out for punishments.”</p><p>“What kind?” Harry said, his voice going hard. James was only 4 but he would rather cut off his wand-arm than hurt his son.</p><p>“Oh, all sorts,” Sirius said with a shrug. “It’s because I’m bad and don’t behave like a proper heir.”</p><p>“You’re not bad,” Harry said, his heart breaking. “You’re so good, Sirius. Don't forget that.”</p><p>“You always tell me that, and that’s why you’re my best friend in the whole wide world,” he replied. “Want to play with my new model set of the Tornadoes? I’ll let you be seeker again!”</p><p>“Sure, Sirius,” Harry said, watching as Sirius scurried to grab his set of quidditch models.</p><p>Harry took a deep breath, but his body started to tingle, the great waves of pain starting again. He bit his lip again and watched Sirius blink out of focus and in the space of a moment, he was back at the Department of Mysteries. Pieces of the veil were scattered everywhere, and Unspeable Tooley was in chains.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Harry said, staring at his colleagues. “Just had a little trip.”</p><p>Auror Robards shot a glare at him but just sighed. The strangest things always happened when he was around.</p><p>Harry begged off the paperwork, and flooed home. James and Albus were asleep, and he kissed them both goodnight, double-checked that they were fine, and re-cast the alert spells on their rooms.</p><p>If they woke up with a cough or a night terror or even sneezed, he and Ginny would know.</p><p>He crept to the bedroom, where Ginny was reading a novel and she smiled as he walked in, but the expression fell off her face when she looked at him properly.</p><p>“What happened?” she asked, closing her book and padding the side of the bed for him to come closer.</p><p>He let her hold him, and take his ministry outer robe off. “I saw Sirius.”</p><p>“Harry, he’s been dead 13 years.”</p><p>“I know that,” he protested. “I’m not crazy! I was chasing an Unspeakable that was found to be taking bribes from a sect of Russian dark wizards, and he blew up the veil, Gin. And part of it hit me, and I met Sirius, but he was only a little boy, but he knew me, called me Harry.”</p><p>Ginny grabbed his hand. “I’m sorry. What was he like?”</p><p>Harry rubbed at his eyes. “Like James, excited and happy and he wanted to show me his toys, but his Mum was already horrible to him, he said he knew he was a bad boy.”</p><p>Ginny cursed underneath her breath.</p><p>“My thoughts exactly,” Harry replied.</p><p>Ginny grabbed his hand, and ran a comforting hand through his hair. “Harry, I don’t know how to say this.”</p><p>“What?” he said, feeling bone-tired, in pain and like the wound of losing Sirius was ripped open all over again.</p><p>“You know you can’t save Sirius, right? He goes to Hogwarts and becomes best friends with your Dad and becomes your godfather…and what happens, has to happen, right? Horrible things happened to wizards who have meddled with time.”</p><p>Harry’s head hurt. “We saved him before, in third year. Hermione and I.”</p><p>“I think you should talk to Hermione about it,” Ginny replied, her freckled face looking a little pale with fear.</p><p>“I will,” Harry promised.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Ginny asked after a moment.</p><p>“You know, I don’t think I am.”</p><p>“You will be,” Ginny promised, and Harry nearly believed her.</p><p>Harry didn’t speak to Hermione though. It had been four days, and nothing else had happened, so he was a little convinced that it was all in his head. The pain had faded to nothing and he didn’t even get any new scars for his efforts.</p><p>He was back at work, ready to go home after an unproductive day looking at closed case files that Unspeakable Tooley had consulted on when the same horrible sensation pulled him back out of his desk, out of his body, and out of time. He swallowed a scream and stopped fighting, falling on his arse on a cold stone floor. He looked around, it was Hogwarts, he’d recognise it anywhere.</p><p>Sirius was bent over a desk, writing lines dispassionately.</p><p>“Detention then?” Harry asked, brushing the dirt off his robes.</p><p>“It was worth it,” Sirius said. “Hello Harry!”</p><p>“I’ve missed you,” Harry said honestly.</p><p>“Me too,” Sirius admitted, dropping his quill.</p><p>“And how old are you now, Sirius?”</p><p>“Sixteen,” Sirius said. “And you’re the same as ever.”</p><p>“28, yeah,” Harry replied. “Probably the cryptkeeper to a 16-year old.”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re a regular Albus Dumbledore,” Sirius joked, but Merlin, if Sirius was 16, then Dumbledore was probably just up in his office. Maybe he was pacing or eating a lemon drop or chatting with Fawkes, or doing Order business…when Harry could end the whole war with the knowledge inside of his head.</p><p>Sirius chucked a wad of parchment at him. “Oi, Harry, you don’t look old, let it go, I was only having a laugh.”</p><p>“I wasn’t worrying about that,” Harry said, taking a step closer to that. “I got my first grey hair a few years ago and honestly, I kind of like them.” It reminded him that he was alive, that he made it, but he didn’t tell Sirius that he never thought he’d make it to 18 let alone 28.</p><p>Sirius’s face pinked a little, but he quickly recovered. “You look fine, I suppose. And you’re a Potter, but the vanity gene must have skipped you somehow. James is going to throw the mother of all strops when he starts going grey.”</p><p>Harry looked down.</p><p>“What’s the matter? Do I throw a strop when I get old? Come on Mister Man out of time, give me a hint, do you travel to visit me when I’m old?”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “You always look good, Sirius, that’s not something you need to worry about.”</p><p>“I wasn’t,” he insisted, and kicked back on his heels. “How are you feeling, do you think we have time to get out of here and go grab a pint of butterbeer or something stronger?”</p><p>Harry took a deep breath, and felt his magic tingle. “I think I’m here for a bit, yeah. But I can’t just be waltzing around the castle, people are going to notice I’m not a student.”</p><p>Sirius waved a hand at him. “I’ll just tell them that James accidentally took an aging potion…or hold on,” he said, rustling in his bag. He made a noise of delight and tossed Harry his cloak. “I had it stashed for a prank later, I nearly forgot!”</p><p>“Wicked,” Harry said, running his hands down the familiar fabric.</p><p>“Of course you know what it is, Potter family heirloom and all,” Sirius grumbled. “I can’t tell you anything.”</p><p>“You can tell me whatever you like, I don’t know everything, I’m not Dumbledore,” Harry protested, as he slipped on the cloak and followed Sirius down to the statute of the one-eyed witch.</p><p>“Is it a Hogsmeade weekend?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Nah, mate, it’s a Tuesday, but Rosmerta likes me and if we’re back before too late, no one will be any wiser,” Sirius said, shooting a naughty grin.</p><p>“And if you get caught, you can always run away and turn into a dog,” Harry said lightly, and Sirius stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“That’s a secret,” Sirius huffed.</p><p>“It’s brilliant is what it is, Padfoot,” Harry said, continuing to walk along the hidden passageway. “I’ve always admired what you did to help Moony.”</p><p>Sirius threw his hands up. “Harry! That’s the kind of talk that makes me think you know everything. It’s unfair.”</p><p>“It is a bit, yeah.” Harry agreed.</p><p>“Sometimes I wake up angry that I have this whole other best friend that no one can know about, or they’d think I was cracked if I did tell them,” Sirius confessed. “It’s so unfair that you know more about me than I know about you.”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I don’t know how much I can tell you without getting us all into a whole lot of trouble,” Harry said, thinking back to the time-turners.</p><p>“That bores me, I’ve heard that one so many times before,” Sirius said, picking up the pace. “Last one to the Honeydukes entrance is a rotten Occamy egg.”</p><p>Harry started to run, but Sirius transformed into a dog, and on four legs, handily beat him to the exit.</p><p>“Dirty cheater,” he complained, but Padfoot just licked his hand and in the space of a moment, Sirius was back.</p><p>“Scoot over,” Sirius said, and went under the invisibility cloak as well.</p><p>Harry was full-grown and Sirius was nearly there, he wouldn’t get much taller, making it was a close squeeze under the cloak. He could smell a woodsy, amber scent of Sirius’s cologne, he had taken so much pride in his appearance, down to the little details.</p><p>Harry shook off the thought of just how pleasant it was, and tip-toed through Honeydukes to the exit, swinging the door open on the way out.</p><p>“Well done, top marks on the Hogwarts jailbreak,” Sirius said, as they made their way over to The Three Broomsticks.</p><p>“I’ve done it before,” Harry admitted.</p><p>“Can you tell me about it or will it possibly destroy the whole world and everything good wizards and witches hold dear,” Sirius said, dramatically swooning onto a barstool.</p><p>Harry laughed despite himself, loving seeing Sirius so carefree and light. “I can tell you. I wasn’t allowed to go to Hogsmeade my third year, I didn’t get my slip signed.”</p><p>“I got my Dad to sign it after promising to look after Regulus, or I wouldn’t have got mine either,” Sirius confessed.</p><p>Harry nodded. “Anyway, I wanted to go to Hogsmeade with my friends…so I took the same passage we just took many times, with that very cloak. Got all the butterbeer and Honeydukes’ my stomach could handle.”</p><p>Sirius grinned, lighting up the room. “Looks like the Potters have a legacy of troublemaking, hmm?”</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>“Your grandson is doing well carrying on your legacy then,” Sirius said, after ordering them two butterbeers.</p><p>Harry blinked at him. “Sorry?”</p><p>“I know you can’t tell me much, but I stayed at the Potter House this summer, because my family is, well you know how they are, and I saw your family tree. Henry Potter, you were alive for the first ten years of Jamie’s life at least. I mean, you’re at least 100 years younger now, but man out of time, what have you.” Sirius said, looking smug at having ‘figured it out’.</p><p>Harry swallowed. “You’re a very clever boy, Sirius.”</p><p>“I know,” he said, smiling at Rosmerta as she dropped two mugs in front of them. “I can understand why it’d be weird for you to meet him, you’ve not even had your own son yet.”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Lots of things are weird in my life, you have no idea.”</p><p>“I might have a bit of one, being the first Black to be sorted in Gryffindor in you know, ever, and my best friends are James Potter and another Potter who I’ve known my entire life.”</p><p>Harry felt a surge of love for his godfather then, so young and so brave and so much fun.</p><p>“You’re looking at me funny. What is it?” Sirius said, looking down at his drink, and blushing again.</p><p>“I’m enjoying spending time with you that’s all,” Harry said. “Just sneaking out and having a drink together.”</p><p>“I’d say we should do this more often, but it’s not like you can control it,” Sirius replied.</p><p>“No,” Harry agreed. “But I’m glad that whatever happened, it brought me to you.”</p><p>Sirius smiled again, Merlin, he was so easy to please at this age, so full of life and open with him.</p><p>But Sirius-his-godfather had always been happy to see him too. Harry’s head hurt, but then his whole body started to tingle.</p><p>“You’re off again, then?” Sirius asked, and Harry nodded.</p><p>“See you soon,” he whispered before falling back to his proper time.</p><p>Harry landed back at the ministry and he sprinted down the hall to where Hermione worked, ignoring the strange looks he was getting from passerbys.</p><p>He didn’t even knock on her door, he just swung it open and silenced it behind him.</p><p>Hermione was there, sucking on a quill and look over her notes, but she caught one look at his face and she stood up and grabbed him into a tight hug.</p><p>“Did it happen again?” she asked him.</p><p>He nodded. “What did Ginny tell you?”</p><p>“Oh, I didn’t hear much from her, exactly, I got the unspeakable files too,” she told him. “You disappearing and reappearing in an area of the ministry that doesn’t allow apparition is a mystery in itself.”</p><p>Harry swallowed and started to tell her the story, the words spilling out of him like a knocked-over glass of water, he couldn’t stop once he started.</p><p>Hermione listened, not stopping to interrupt him maybe once. “Oh, Harry,” she said, tugging at her hair. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“I’m not all that sorry,” he said, his heart hurting. “He’s not my godfather yet, but I’d take more pain if it meant being able to see him again.”</p><p>“I know,” she said, scrambling for parchment so she could start writing some notes down. “Just be careful, okay? I’ll do some research, but don’t try and change anything significant.”</p><p>Harry snorted. “Like what? Hello, Sirius, how are you? Don’t trust Wormtail, do you want to go play Quidditch?”</p><p>Hermione didn’t find that funny. “That’s exactly what I mean, Harry. Maybe your parents live for a while longer, but Sirius is the secret-keeper and killed for his efforts….you’re safe, but the ministry falls sooner and Voldemort starts his reign of terror years before this time. Countless people could die before you grow old enough to stop him.”</p><p>Harry felt ill. “What if I tell him about the horcruxes?”</p><p>Hermione tugged at her cloud of brown hair frantically. “I don’t know, Harry. It could work or it could be a disaster. It’s too risky. I’ll look into it, but there’s so many ways it could blow up.”</p><p>“So what, I just pretend to be my own grandfather and listen to his stories?”</p><p>Hermione nodded. “He said you’re his friend, Harry. You could try and be that.”</p><p>“Alright,” he said, his heart still beating too fast. “Just look into why this is happening, please, I don’t know how much I can take.”</p><p>“I know how hard this must be for you,” Hermione said.</p><p>Harry doubted that she did, but he felt grateful for her help anyway.</p><p>“I wonder if it’s taking you to Sirius’s past because he was the last one to fall in the veil,” Hermione mused aloud, and Harry sat down at her desk.</p><p>“I don’t know if I can see that again,” Harry confessed. “Seeing him as a child is hard enough…Hermione, his parents are so awful, they treat him as if he’s worse than dirt.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s a good thing that he has someone who understands what that’s like then, hmm?” Hermione said, her eyes going glassy with unshed tears.</p><p>“Stop,” Harry protested, not wanting her pity. He was grown now, and tried not to think of the cupboard or Petunia’s cruel words.</p><p>“I’m just saying that as much as this is a curse, you understand, so maybe it’s a gift too, magic tends to have both,” Hermione explained before fixing him a cup of tea.</p><p>“Thanks,” Harry muttered dully, taking a sip of the too-hot Darjeeling.</p><p>“Go on home,” Hermione said. “Go kiss your sons, who you are raising to know that they’re loved, and remember that we all love you so much, okay? And I’ll get some books on time magic and the veil and see you soon.”</p><p>Harry nodded, and headed for the floo.</p>
