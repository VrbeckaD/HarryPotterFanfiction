  <em>Theodore Huxley had nothing</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Well, that's partially a lie. His family, the Huxleys, were rich, they were one of the richest and most well known pureblood family, know mostly for their company Applesoft, a company best known for making all sorts of potions and magical artifacts; legal or illegal. The Huxleys started out in America but later moved to Britain seeing how they could make money off of both wizards and muggles with their products.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The Huxleys were very rich, and Theodore was a Huxley, so that meant he's rich. That meant he had everything, right? Or at least could have everything</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Again, it was partially the truth. For Theodore, he'd rather go poor and happy than to be rich and unhappy</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>His family weren't exactly... The nicest bunch. Not a day without the reminder of how much of an idiot, a useless nobody he is. The torment, the hitting, the abuse, it happened for years. It became clear to Theodore that his parents and brother would never fully accept him to the family but he denied it, still hoped that maybe, just maybe, it was their way of showing love and maybe there was something wrong with him, that's probably why they're acting that way to him. Yeah, they're probably doing it to make him a better person, to live up to the Huxley name</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"Theodore, dear..." His mother stroked his cheek and spoke with deceiving sweetness. It was not sweet not tender like the love of a mother, nothing of sort. It was cold and threatening</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"Y-yes mother?" He stuttered, causing the glare on his father's face to grow darker</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"What have you achieved?" His mother's voice was stern and not so patient. Theodore gulped and finally spoke</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"I... Got some friends..."</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"Are they purebloods of high families?"</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"N-no..."</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"Go on" His mother insisted, causing him flinch even harder</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"I... I..." He hesitated</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"Well?"</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"I... Don't..." </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>SLAP</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>His cheek turned red from the harsh slap ot her mother. More tears welled up but again, he held them down</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"Pathetic. Utterly pathetic. Pathetic and stupid little child. Why can't you be more like your brother?! You're a disappointment Theodore and until you begin to be more like your brother, you will always be" His mother finally left. His father followed after as he continued to glare at the boy. The parents were out of sight and Felix finally left for his own room. Theodore then ran for his room, for his safe haven</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>His room was not special, well not as special as the other rooms in the house. At least it was big. He had a king sized bed with green sheets, his desk had nothing, a bookshelf just beside the desk filled with books about business, potions, dark magic spells, and more books about pureblood history, pictures of him and his family hung on the walls, the Slytherin emblem hung on the wall above his bed because "All Huxleys Are Slytherins", a small coffee table in the middle of the room which sported an emerald green rug underneath it</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>What was interesting, however, was what lied underneath the bed. Theodore sat beside his bed and pulled out two cardboard boxes of the same size and the same heavy weight. Theodore opened one of the boxes and pulled out a book from it</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them by Newt Scamander</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>It was some sort of comfort for him, sneaking in things he'd always wanted but never actually got because his parents couldn't give a damn about his happiness and well being. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Theodore opened the book and he could feel himself elevated. Everything will be alright. The book gave comfort, it always had and it always would</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Until one day, it didn't</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">---</p><p dir="ltr">The train was leaving. The Huxleys gave their children the warmest goodbyes. Well, they gave Felix the warmest goodbye, Ted just scowled and left to find himself a compartment. He's sure Felix won't look for him</p><p dir="ltr">He found a free compartment with another boy sitting there, book in hand. The boy was his age with ginger hair, freckles, almost glimmering green eyes, and round glasses. He reeked of intelligence from his feature and something about that gave Ted unknown comfort. He inched closer nervously</p><p dir="ltr">"Is this seat taken?" The boy looked up from his book and observed Ted head to toe. He was slightly nervous, nervous because he's afraid the boy would kick him out. But fortunately</p><p dir="ltr">"No. You can sit if you want" Ted was stunned by the sudden act of kindness and without hesitation reached for the seat and plopped himself down with a smile. The boy seemed nice</p><p dir="ltr">"What's your name? I'm Ted!" The boy looked up to see Ted extending his hand in a form of greeting. He smiled softly</p><p dir="ltr">"Montgomery. But that's a bit too long, so just go with Monty" Monty took the hand and shook it gently. His smile only grew when he saw Ted also smiling</p><p dir="ltr">"You don't look like you're from around here" Monty's smile slightly died down and Ted regretted everything he had said. <em>'Was it something wrong?'</em></p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Not really from around these corners. I'm from Glasgow" Ted raised a curious eyebrow</p><p dir="ltr">"Glasgow?" Monty nodded, a smug smile now plastered across his expression</p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Worse place in muggle Britain, had me glad to get this letter" Ted watched in fascination, connecting two dots together</p><p dir="ltr">"You're muggleborn?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Half-blood. My mum's a wizard. What about you?" Ted flinched slightly and stiffened. It made Monty wonder if anything he had said triggered the reaction</p><p dir="ltr">"... Pureblood" Ted responded, hesitant and afraid. Monty just looked at him with unreadable expression</p><p dir="ltr">"That's cool. Y'know, you purebloods are supposed to be glad, living in this world. For some reason, both my parents decided muggle Glasgow is a wonder to be living in"</p><p dir="ltr">"I've never been into muggle Britain..." Ted wondered to himself and it was Monty's turn to ask</p><p dir="ltr">"Never?" Ted nodded slowly, still wondering</p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. My parents would never let me. Thinks muggles are lower people and stuff. I don't think that's true though, I think muggles are just as people as we are" For the first time, Monty was stunned. The first time he stepped into these halls, people were looking at him as if he had the plague, and circumstances were made worse when his father was the one that came with him to pick up supplies. He was called names and especially his father. Never had he thought those words would come out of a pureblood wizard's mouth</p><p dir="ltr">"That's good..." Was the only thing he knew what to say. It surprised him to no end. This boy came up to him, shy and at the same time excited. Reluctant to say he's a pureblood, unlike the others he'd met, afraid that his status would scare Monty away. There's something about this boy that intrigued him</p><p dir="ltr">"I heard muggles don't have magic, that's why alot of purebloods think they're second class. But I think not. I think muggles are smart. I heard muggles have mechanics, technology beyond anything we could ever dream of. That sounds pretty cool. I heard one calles 'Camputor' and you can communicate with others from a long distance!" Monty would've cried from the compliment if it weren't for the sudden mispelled word. He snorted and confusion filled Ted</p><p dir="ltr">"What's wrong? Did I say something funny?" Monty laughed out loudly before receding to tears</p><p dir="ltr">"It's not 'Camputor', dude. It's pronounced 'Computer'" Sudden realization hit and Ted was already going red</p><p dir="ltr">"Well whoops" Monty rolled his eyes in amusement</p><p dir="ltr">"I like you, Ted. You're cool. Like very cool" The red in Ted's face disappeared almost immediately and was replaced with a goofy grin</p><p dir="ltr">"You're cool too, Monty. Hope we can be friends and get into the same house"</p><p dir="ltr">"Hey. First of all, the moment you said muggles are cool, is the same moment the word 'friend' is attached to you so no need to worry. Second, that'll be cool, being dormmates. What house do you want to go in?" Again, Ted froze in his place, nervously fiddling his robe</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know exactly... I want to go into Hufflepuff but then again, all of my family are Slytherin, and I don't want to be in Slytherin" Monty nodded in understanding</p><p dir="ltr">"Then don't. Your family doesn't determine your housing, the sorting hat does. And I'd say, you are not Slytherin material"</p><p dir="ltr">"Really?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah. You're more Hufflepuff than Slytherin so don't worry, there's still a chance"</p><p dir="ltr">"I hope so, what about you?"</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know. Never heard of the houses before. The only ones I heard were Hufflepuff and Slytherin and it was from your rambling. Would ya explain a few?" An excited Ted then proceed to explain the four houses; Hufflepuff and Slytherin are two of them alongside Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. Monty listened, paid much attention to the knowledge of the four houses. And honestly? If Ted were to end up in Hufflepuff, he'd hoped to get there too. He was his first friend, the first person he'd willingly call a friend. And he wouldn't want to be seperated from a friend in a world where muggles are treated like shit and muggleborns and halfblood are treated worse than shit</p><p dir="ltr">He'd only known him for a few minutes, but he knew Ted would make the years in Hogwarts much more bearable</p>
