    <p>Chapter One<br/>
May 1906</p><p>“Theseus? A word?” Professor Dumbledore spoke just loudly enough for Theseus to hear as he passed the professor’s desk at the end of class. He stopped and told a couple of friends that he would meet them in the next class. When the classroom had cleared, Professor Dumbledore closed the door with a wave of his hand.</p><p>“I understand that you are planning to go into Auror training.”<br/>
“Yes,” Theseus answered. Professor Dumbledore had given him good marks. Did he not think that Theseus would score high enough on his NEWTS?<br/>
“I would like you to consider putting that off long enough to get your Mastery in Defence. You are an exceptional student.”<br/>
Theseus laughed. “Excuse me for saying so, sir, but your experience is sufficiently limited that I’m not sure how flattered I should be.”</p><p>The young professor blushed. Theseus realized he didn’t know how old Professor Dumbledore was exactly, but he couldn’t be much older than Theseus. Probably it had been rude to draw attention to what a short time he had been teaching. But it seemed that apologizing now would just make it worse.</p><p>Professor Dumbledore cleared his throat. “It is true that I have only been a professor for two years. But I know intelligence when I see it. You have been ready for more advanced work since I arrived here. I’d like to see you properly challenged. And I’d like to see what you could do in front of a classroom. You would help me with some of my research projects the first year, and the second year you would work on a project of your own. By the time you were done, you would have a Mastery, you would be published, you would have teaching and research experience. You could go on to Auror training afterwards, if you still wanted to. Or you could become a curse breaker, or teach, or…”</p><p>Theseus shifted on his feet. His professor was rambling. And still blushing. He was clearly nervous about something. Theseus didn’t know what Professor Dumbledore had to be nervous about. It was Theseus who was being asked to consider changing his plans for next year. Theseus who was getting a rather uncomfortable compliment – he was essentially being singled out as the best Defence student of his year. Of his year and the next year, assuming the professor wouldn’t take on two Mastery students at once.<br/>
“Thanks, professor. That’s, umm, kind of you.”<br/>
“Not at all, Theseus. I can’t think of anyone I’d rather work with.”</p><p>Theseus would just have to trust Professor Dumbledore on that one. That level of praise was honestly embarrassing.<br/>
“I’ll consider it. But right now, I need to get to Potions.”<br/>
“Of course, Theseus. You can come to my office if you have any questions.”<br/>
Theseus had a lot of questions already. He wished he could stay and keep talking to Professor Dumbledore.</p><p>He couldn’t stop thinking about it as he walked to class. Professor Dumbledore was his favourite professor by far – he had been since he had arrived at the beginning of Theseus’ sixth year. He was electric – he just about set the room ablaze with his enthusiasm. The depth of his knowledge was astonishing, and he could quickly come up with solutions to any question a student raised, even when he clearly hadn’t even considered the matter before. He had a dark sense of humour, and was intriguingly difficult to get a laugh out of, though he smiled easily.</p><p>Theseus had spoken at such length about Professor Dumbledore’s classes that his friends had become annoyed with him.  Now they would tease him – when one friend would say – just about anything – another would say, in a poor mimicry of Theseus’ voice, “You know what Professor Dumbledore says about that?”<br/>
How could they not understand? Here was someone barely older than they were, and he was a complete genius. Lots of their professors were naturally talented in their subjects, but none of them explained what they were teaching in ways that everyone in their class could understand – until Professor Dumbledore.<br/>
Now this person that Theseus had admired for almost two years was saying that he couldn’t think of anyone besides Theseus that he would rather work with – what would he tell his friends?</p><p>It didn’t matter. The one thing that had been making him unhappy about graduating from Hogwarts was never getting to learn from Professor Dumbledore again. It looked like –<br/>
The Potions professor interrupted his musings. “Mr. Scamander!”<br/>
“Yes! The answer is yes,” said Theseus. The class erupted into laughter.<br/>
“I am fairly certain, Mr. Scamander, that ‘yes’ is not the ingredient I am looking for. 5 points from Hufflepuff for failing to pay attention.”</p><p>After class, walking to the Great Hall, his friends questioned him.<br/>
“What happened in there? Potions is one of your best subjects!”<br/>
“He was daydreaming about Dumbledore.”<br/>
They all laughed. All but Theseus, because for once they were right.</p><p>*****</p><p>Professor Dumbledore was at the librarian’s desk. Theseus would never admit that he had known the moment the professor had walked in the door, because he had memorized the sound of his footsteps. Everyone’s footsteps sounded slightly different, and Theseus had a few committed to memory: his younger brother’s, two of his friends’, Professor Dumbledore’s. Which was perfectly natural – the man was always in motion in front of the classroom, and Theseus always sat at the front. The professor moved in a way that was both confident and graceful, and that was reflected in the sound of his footsteps. </p><p>Theseus ignored the sound of Professor Dumbledore walking into the library, trying to concentrate instead on his notes. The first day of NEWTS was tomorrow, and this was the last chance to revise. Professor Dumbledore may have offered to supervise his mastery, but that could only happen if Theseus got an O on his Defence exam, and on at least 4 others. He needed to stay focused. </p><p>It was more difficult now that Professor Dumbledore was speaking to the librarian. Even when speaking quietly, as he was now, it was hard to ignore how melodic, and yet authoritative his voice was. Theseus looked up. The librarian was handing the professor a stack of books. The professor was smiling at her – Theseus had always thought that Professor Dumbledore had a nice smile. Though he’d never told anyone he thought so – this was not the sort of thing one was supposed to say about another man. Not that Theseus understood why. Professor Dumbledore’s smile was objectively contagious – anyone could see that. </p><p>Theseus noticed that Professor Dumbeldore was wearing wizarding robes over his suit. He didn’t wear robes in the classroom, but the rest of the time he did. Of course, Muggle clothing looked good on him, but he did wonder why he didn’t wear robes when teaching. Theseus wondered if it would be rude to ask him about that. He had moved on to noticing the professor’s auburn hair (and wishing that his was still long enough to wear back like that, but he had cut it short, anticipating joining the Auror corps), when Professor Dumbledore turned and looked at Theseus. Perhaps he shouldn’t have been staring? He was expecting the professor to – he didn’t know what he was expecting, but he definitely wasn’t expecting what happened next, which was Professor Dumbledore <i>winking at him</i>. What did that mean?</p><p>Theseus felt very strange – embarrassed and giddy and a bit nauseated all at the same time. He had not felt like that before, and he liked it, which was strange, too. He blushed and looked back down at his Defence textbook. He was studying Defence. Which was taught by – no – he was studying… charms. Yes, charms. Ok… He began shuffling papers aimlessly. He must look completely scatter-brained. </p><p>He risked looking up, and Professor Dumbledore was gone. He was somehow disappointed and relieved at the same time. He had never felt relieved not to see the professor, but there was no time to examine that, or anything else that had happened in the past fifteen minutes. His Defence exam was going to be first thing in the morning.</p>
