    <p>You always remember the first time, when you finally understand that you’re unacceptable. I was seven during that original assessment, it was summertime, and I had just sluggishly dragged myself from the overbearing sun. I’d been lazing in it for the last several hours now, burning my skin and ruining my eyes, so as I sank quietly into the cool tile floor it took me a few minutes to hear the voices. But there they were, in the background of the dining room. Usually I’d have ignored them, gone upstairs to read some more, but their was something in their voices that sounded extremely adult-like and important, and besides, I’d just read Harriet the Spy and had been perfecting my eavesdropping skills ever since.<br/>
One of the voices was my mother’s and after a minute I realized the other was one of my neighbor’s mothers, Eric’s one I think. I was so jealous of Eric, he got to go to Hogwarts this fall, I still had four long years to wait.<br/>
Getting out my small journal, I started writing down what Eric’s mum was saying with my finger after whispering a soft “atramento” that caused ink to release from my fingernail. I was so excited to find that spell earlier in the week, after-all, spies don’t have time for all that silly quill nonsense.<br/>
“I just don’t understand it, Lilah. We did the best we could by him, I mean, we didn’t raise him badly at any rate, didn’t expose him to all that Muggle nonsense. And it’s not like he’s been doing badly otherwise, he got seven OWLS and this will probably be his third year as a chaser. Sure, they don’t win a lot, but they’re Ravenclaws, not Griffindors-”<br/>
Not to interrupt you Valerie, but you’re getting off track.”<br/>
“Oh, sorry Lil. I just, I don’t understand why he would do this to us.”<br/>
“Has he actually, tried anything, you know?”<br/>
“No, thank Merlin for that, but we found some body transmogrification books in his room when I searched it earlier, and who knows what he’s planning to do when he gets back to Hogwarts.”<br/>
“You’re planning on sending him back then?”<br/>
“I mean, what else can we do? Arnold doesn’t want anyone to suspect.”<br/>
“Well no offense to Arnold but they’ll jolly well suspect if your son comes back home from break with C-cup tits and pink painted nails.”<br/>
Eric’s mum bursts out crying.<br/>
“Oh, don’t worry, it’s alright. You know, I know of a few places, you know, lovely ones that can get all those silly thoughts out of your boy’s head. What, there’s six more weeks of break? That’s enough time to send him off there, fix him up, and next thing you know he’ll be mastering his NEWTS and bringing a sweet pureblood girl home for Christmas.”<br/>
Tearfully, she asked,“You really think so?”<br/>
“Course, I’ve seen it myself. Now, let me just make us another lovely pot of tea, and I can show you some pamphlets.”<br/>
My head was so reeling and confused by what I just heard I didn’t understand the importance of the footsteps coming towards me until the door I was resting against was pushed open, causing me to sprawl on the floor.<br/>
“For Potter’s sake, Delphi, what are you doing there? Look, you’ve got mud all over my clean floor, I spent fifteen minutes scouring this.”<br/>
“Sorry, mum, but-”<br/>
“You should be. Now go up to your room and get changed. I’m talking to a friend right now.”<br/>
I ran off before she could wonder about the book in my hand or why I was leaning against the door in the first place.<br/>
At first I wanted to figure out what they were talking about myself, like a proper detective, but after spending a few hours wracking my young stupid brain about the whole thing, I still didn’t have a single clue. So, I decided on the next best thing, fessing up.<br/>
After mum had tucked me into bed that night and was asking if I “really” wanted to read the Tale of Babbity Rabbity again, I took my chance.<br/>
“You know actually, no.”<br/>
“Oh, thank Merlin.”<br/>
“So, mum, I know I shouldn’t have, but I was curious, and I didn’t mean to listen in I swear.”<br/>
“Oh, Delphine, I know you were listening into me and Valerie.”<br/>
“You did?”<br/>
“Of course dear, you aren’t exactly subtle. You have a while yet until you’ll be proper Auror material.”<br/>
“So.......what was it about? I was confused.”<br/>
“Well, dear, it’s complicated, but you know some people get very confused sometimes?”<br/>
“........sure, I guess.”<br/>
“Well, her son, the older one, James, not Eric, he’s very confused right now. And she’s just very worried about him.”<br/>
I knew James, he was cool. With dyed green hair and one big dragon earring, he would watch over as Eric and me played Quidditch sometimes. He would act properly impressed whenever we got a ball through the conjured hoops, whooping and doing barrel rolls, and even when I won.<br/>
“Well, what is he confused about? That doesn’t sound too bad.”<br/>
“Dear, he-he thinks he’s a girl.”<br/>
I spent a few minutes mulling that over in my head.<br/>
“Is..is that bad then?”<br/>
Mum looked shocked. “Yes, yes dear, it’s extremely bad, very much indeed. Thankfully his mother cares about him and is going to send him somewhere where he can get all sorted out and normal again.”<br/>
“But, mum, we’re magic. If, if he thinks he’s a girl, why doesn’t he just turn himself into one for a bit, and then he’ll realize he isn’t.”<br/>
“Delphine, you can’t talk like that. Magic like that, magic where you change your body, it’s evil, it’s not right.”<br/>
“But polyjuice potion.”<br/>
“It’s not just right, okay?” mum’s voice suddenly got very low and intimidating, like when she would read the villian parts in books. “Polyjuice potion is different, it’s non-permanent. But to change your apperance permanently through magic, that’s too much. Even for witches and wizards. And we couldn’t even if we were silly enough to want to, it’s illegal.”<br/>
“Oh........”<br/>
“I’m sorry dear, it’s just complicated. You’ll understand it more when you’re older.”<br/>
I nodded my head as she kissed me goodnight and turned off the lights as she left the room, closing the door behind her. In the darkness on pierced by the fairy nightlight who glowed and adjusted her hair every few seconds, I realized tears were running down my cheeks.<br/>
I’d never told my mother this, but the first year when I got to Hogwarts, I was planning to be the best ever transfiguration student they’d ever had. And I’d give myself short hair, and rough hands, and I would get to play with boys properly and  I’d be the bestest Quidditch player ever, and when I came back for the summer mum would realize how silly she’d been, because I’m obviously a boy and not a girl. And we’d laugh about it, and she’d bake me a cake.<br/>
But what can I say, I was a stupid kid. A kid who didn’t know any better. Everything that came after though, that is another story.</p>
