    <p>The news was on the front page of the Daily Prophet; Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban. Darius had heard about Sirius Black from his uncle Severus and auntie Bella and from what he had heard he was not a good man. He could only imagine what the man would do now that he was loose. One thing was for sure though; the rumours about him serving his father were false.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Rumours say that he is after Potter,” Blaise said as they were on the train to Hogwarts.</p><p>“What would he want with him?” Pansy asked.</p><p>“Everything is about Potter nowadays,” Draco said bitterly and Darius gave him a look just as the train stopped in the middle of the tracks.</p><p> </p><p>“Why are we stopping here?” Pansy asked as she gazed out of the window. Just then the air grew cold in the compartment and their breaths came out in small puffs of smoke. They watched how a dark figure appeared outside the compartment, its’ dark hands with the long fingers gripping the side of the sliding door. The empty space where the face was supposed to be appeared to be looking around. Darius felt his heart grow cold at the sight of the creature who quickly moved on to the next compartment.</p><p> </p><p>Darius let out a breath he did not know he was holding as the compartment grew warm again.</p><p>“What is a dementor doing on the train?” Pansy asked, shivering slightly from the experience.</p><p>“Looking for Black,” Darius said; he had heard as much from his uncle. He stroked Megara who was coiled up in his lap, his hands shaking just a bit from the experience.</p><p> </p><p>The train soon started moving again and a student that Darius did not know the name of was running around, telling people how Potter had fainted when faced with the dementor. Draco chuckled softly at the news and Darius hit him lightly on the arm to make him stop.</p><p> </p><p>They eventually reached Hogwarts and gathered for the welcome feast. Dumbledore welcomed them all and also welcomed their new DADA teacher, professor R.J. Lupin. Darius noticed that Snape did not look too pleased with the new teacher and from what he had heard Darius did not blame him.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Potter!” Draco whispered to get the attention of Potter who glanced at him. “Is it true that you fainted?” Darius gave his cousin a look.</p><p>“Leave him be, Draco,” he whispered and got Draco to face forward again. Darius gave a small nod to Potter as a greeting and then went back to listening to the principal who told them that the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher would be none other than the gamekeeper Hagrid. The giant man stood up a little clumsily and gave a small wave as the students applauded.</p><p> </p><p>“Finally,” Dumbledore said with a serious look on his face. “on a more disquieting note, Hogwarts - at the request of the Ministry of Magic - will, until further notice, play host to the Dementors of Azkaban.” A murmur quickly filled the hall at the news.</p><p>“The Dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds. While they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as you go about your daily activities. Under no circumstances are you to approach them. It is not in the nature of a Dementor to be forgiving,” Dumbledore continued and a solemn mood filled the hall but it quickly turned jolly again as the feast began.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, princess,” Darius heard two voices say just as two arms wrapped around his shoulders. he smiled as he looked up at the twins who had come over to the Slytherin table.</p><p>“Hello, Fred. George,” he greeted. “How was Egypt?” He had kept in contact with the twins over summer and had heard about the whole family’s trip to Egypt.</p><p>“Brilliant!” they spoke in unison.</p><p>“The ancient tombs were the best,” George said with a smile on his face.</p><p>“You should’ve seen them, princess,” Fred added with a matching smile.</p><p>“Maybe one day I will,” Darius answered.</p><p>“How were your summer classes?” Fred asked since Darius had told the twins that he would be doing a lot of studying with private tutors over the summer.</p><p>“It was great. Wizarding law is so fascinating,” Darius answered. He never mentioned that he had also studied dark arts and duelling with auntie Bella.</p><p> </p><p>The feast was soon over and Darius went to the Slytherin common room with Draco and their friends.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Darius’s first class the next morning was studying of Ancient Runes with professor Bathsheda Babbling. The subject was fascinating and Darius enjoyed translating the different runes to English. The next class was Care of Magical Creatures which was taken outdoors with Hagrid. The giant man proudly led the way for the students from his hut and into a paddock just outside the Forbidden Forest.</p><p> </p><p>“Now gather round over there and open your books to page 49,” Hagrid instructed. Draco glanced down at his book Monster book of Monsters which was held secured together with a leather strap.</p><p>“How are we supposed to do that?” he asked and Hagrid looked at him with a grin.</p><p>“Why, you just stroke the spines,” he said and took Hermione’s book and removed the leather strap. When the book started biting Hagrid calmly stroked his fingers along the spine and the book shivered before opening.</p><p> </p><p>Darius took his own book and copied the motion and was able to successfully open his book. Neville tried as well but was attacked by the book instead which started biting at his robes, tearing them. Darius rushed to help him and stroked the spine of Neville’s book to calm it down.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you alright?” Darius asked and Neville sat up from where he had fallen over.</p><p>“Yes. Thank you,” he said and Darius smiled.</p><p>“You are welcome,” he said while he helped Neville up on his feet. Neville’s robes were torn but otherwise he looked fine.</p><p> </p><p>Hagrid then cleared his throat and made a fanfare with his mouth as he gestured at a creature that had the torso, hind legs, and tail of a horse, but the front legs, wings and head of a giant eagle.</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid said proudly. “Say hello to Buckbeak.”</p><p>“Hagrid,” Ron said flabbergasted. “What exactly is that?” Darius looked down in his book.</p><p>“It is a hippogriff,” he said, reading the page that Hagrid had told them to open.</p><p>“That’s right,” Hagrid said with a smile. “First thing you want to know about hippogriffs is that they are very proud creatures, very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff; it may just be the last thing you do.”</p><p> </p><p>Darius gazed at the majestic creature and gave a small smile. It was indeed, beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>“Now,” Hagrid said, clapping his hands. “Who would like to come and say hello.” Everyone backed up safe from Darius and Potter.</p><p>“Well done Harry. Malfoy,” Hagrid said with an encouraging voice. Darius and Potter glanced at each other and slowly stepped forward.</p><p> </p><p>“Now, you ought to let him make the first move,” Hagrid instructed. “It’s only polite. So, step up and give a bow and wait for him to bow back. If he does, you can pet him, if he does not…well we’ll get to that later.”</p><p> </p><p>Darius and Potter looked at each other again and gave a deep bow under Hagrid’s instructions. Being a Malfoy, Darius was unfamiliar with ever bowing to anyone but he wanted to show respect to the creature.</p><p> </p><p>The hippogriff looked at them curiously and then started flapping its’ wings and Hagrid warned them to be still. They waited a while until the hippogriff finally gave a bow as well.</p><p> </p><p>“Go on and pet him now,” Hagrid said. “Careful. Let him come to you.” Darius and Potter carefully approached with their hands held out. The hippogriff gazed at them and seemed hesitant at first but eventually lowered its’ head to meet the boy’s hands so they could pet it. The feathers felt soft and silky underneath Darius’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“Well done, boys,” Hagrid praised as he clapped his hands and the other students followed his example. “I’d reckon he’ll let you ride him now.” Darius stepped back then and watched as Hagrid lifted up a surprised Potter and placed him upon the hippogriffs back. He held back a smile as Hagrid patted the hippogriff’s rump and Potter held on for dear life as the creature started running and then took off into the air and started flying around the school grounds.</p><p> </p><p>Hagrid gave a whistle to bring the creature back and it landed with a trot.</p><p>“Well done, Harry,” Hagrid said proudly and helped Potter down before he faced the other students. “Who’s next?” he asked and some students stepped forward eager to ride the hippogriff.</p>
