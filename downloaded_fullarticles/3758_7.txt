<p>Birthday Choice</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Astoria led Draco by hand into their bedroom. “I’ve a surprise for you.” </p>
<p>“Oh?” Draco watched as she opened a cabinet, removing a phial and several envelopes. “What’s this?” he asked when she returned. </p>
<p>“Polyjuice base.” She handed him everything. “And each envelope contains the hair of someone you’d like to fuck.” </p>
<p>Draco blinked. “Astoria—”</p>
<p>She placed her finger over his lips. “It’s all right. It’s only human nature to want…variety on occasion. And it <i>is</i> your birthday.”</p>
<p>“Is this my gift?” </p>
<p>“Mmhm.” Turning away, Astoria began to undress. “Pick who you want, I won’t look. You get a free pass tonight.” </p>
<p>Draco studied the names on the envelopes. “You’ve got quite the variety here. Ginny Weasley?”</p>
<p>“You like Quidditch.” </p>
<p>“And your sister?”</p>
<p>“She could have married you.” </p>
<p>“Unlikely.” </p>
<p>When Astoria faced him, she was naked. “Have you chosen?” </p>
<p>Draco wordlessly handed her the Polyjuice, which she tipped back, shuddering as she drank. “Ugh.” </p>
<p>“Come here,” said Draco, reaching for her. </p>
<p>They climbed onto the bed, kissing, Astoria keeping her eyes closed as he worshipped her breasts with lips and tongue and fingered her until she trembled. </p>
<p>He fucked her face to face, his eyes roaming her features as if memorising them, and only after she came did he find his release. </p>
<p>Astoria watched the clock. When an hour had passed and nothing happened, she frowned. “Did the Polyjuice not work?”</p>
<p>Draco hummed. “I didn’t add hair. I’ve no need to fuck anyone else, love.” </p>
<p>Astoria exhaled. “Right answer.” </p>
