    <p>
  <span>Tom Riddle had chalk-white skin, electric blue eyes, wavy black hair and a lithe frame. He stood at 5’11 and he was Head Boy. Heir of Slytherin, well respected by most and one of the most powerful wizards even at the age of 17.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter had a light skin tone, bottle green eyes, jet black hair and lanky frame. He stood at 5’7 and he was a nobody in Slytherin. He knew of Tom Riddle, respected him to a degree and avoided him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However it changed when everyone had to take a Classification Potion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>You were either a Daddy, Little, Pet, or Neutral.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tom Riddle already had his results. He was a Daddy. Not that he would ever go looking for a Little or Pet. Even though Tom grew up in an Orphanage, he was abused to a certain degree but he was not a weak little boy. He stood up to those around him and took charge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry Potter was not a Daddy, in fact, he was a Little. He did not grow up in an Orphanage, but was abused worse than Tom. His relatives belittled him, showed him no love or even kindness. They treated him worse than a House Elves and those poor creatures were treated horrible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even though these two boys had nothing in common, they still get wrapped up in each other's problems and are soon to be the answers to their problems.</span>
