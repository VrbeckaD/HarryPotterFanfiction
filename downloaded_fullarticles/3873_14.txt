    <p>The first time you met her was on your first day.</p><p>And you noticed her just because she was bullying Rowan, your best friend.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>And then when she noticed you standing there. It started.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The hate that she had against you, because you were related to someone who’s been expelled, and then went missing.</p><p>You were his sister.</p><p>But you weren‘t like him.</p><p>Okay maybe you were after the Cursed Vaults, but just because you wanted to find him.</p><p>But She was same as you.
After the Cursed Vaults, but why? You didn't know that.</p><p>She said, she knew, where my brother is, but.. She didn’t tell me.</p><p>„I'll tell you after you find the Cursed Vaults.“  She said.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Everytime when we Gryffindors and Slytherins had potion class, she's always looking at me.</p><p>Whatever it was glancing or glaring. It happens all the time.</p><p>Not that i mind, but. I don’t understand.</p><p>But when i by any chance ended up looking at her.</p><p>She would be like „Why are you looking at me? Are you copying my technique?“</p><p>And then i facepalmed internally. Holy shit Merula how can i copy *you*, when you are using *my* cauldron. Because you doesn't have your own.</p><p>Of course i couldn’t say that loud, because you know, Snape.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Then there was flying class.</p><p>„I’m the best witch.'' she always says.
And then she'd end up hitting herself with her broom.</p><p>3 times.</p><p>I mean, what?</p><p>„I should be the one, teaching this class.“ „Yeah because everyone wants to know how to hit themself with their broom.“ I said sarcastically.</p><p>Of course she heard it, and then made her pouty face.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>I don’t know why, i never thought i would say this but.</p><p>Even though she behaves like a .. you know, and everytime she opens her mounth i want to slap her.</p><p>She's cute.</p>
