  <strong>Chapter 1: <em>A Broken Time </em></strong>
</p>
<p align="center"> "Remember Ms. Granger" Albus Dumbledore said before leaving the infirmary. "3 turns should do the trick" Dumbledore walked out of the infirmary leaving 3 teens in one room one of course couldn't get out of the bed considering his leg was bandaged up due to being attacked by a black dog, Which low and behold turned out to be young Harry Potter's godfather which even threw him for a loop.</p>
<p align="center"> Harry going in and out of his mind thinking long and hard to everything that just happened. First it had just been a normal day and then everything blew up they were running to the whomping willow to save Ron and then they were almost in a full fight with Professor Lupin, Sirius Black and Severus Snape. In which none of this actually seemed real to him in the course of what should have been a full 4 hours plus. Before Harry knew what was going on he had felt Hermione's arms reach around him which to him was weird enough to bring him back to reality.</p>
<p align="center"> "Hermione what are you doing?" Harry asked as he tried to touch the object that Hermione had just brought out from her shirt. Without answering him she smacked his had to dismiss this action. "Hermione did you hear me?" Still Hermione hadn't answered him which started to irritate him horribly enough to finally shout. "HERMIONE LOOK AT ME!"</p>
<p align="center"> Hermione's head quickly bolt up hearing Harry holler for the first time in the past 3 years they have been attending Hogwarts together.  </p>
<p align="center"> "Harry trust me there is nothing more I would like to do than tell you what this is but, I have to concentrate or....." Hermione trailed off horribly realizing what she was doing while try to scold and reassure her worried friend. Hermione looked at her hand which had already started turning the dial on the time turner which was worse because she had lost count after Harry decided to shout. With a little bit of hope in her heart Hermione let go of the knob and they watched as the time turner started run making everything go back in time until it was finally to late and they had disappeared from Hogwarts all together.</p>

<p align="center"> "What's this supposed to be?" a stalky man asked as his 'friend' pulled a bottle of liquid from his pocket.</p>
<p align="center"> "This Jacob is called Erumpent musk. Honestly this will help me considering she is in heat" The smell coming off the bottle was almost grotesque to explain no human alive could possibly figure out what concoction had been mixed to make that musk. "Here please hold this for me" the man said handing Jacob the bottle of musk thankfully sealed. </p>
<p align="center"> "Mr.….Mr. Scamander!" Jacob yelled but to no avail seeing as the tall man had already started some sort of strange ritual that even Jacob himself couldn't comprehend. Instead Jacob just stood there and watched as this strange ritual somehow turned into Mr. Scamander dancing like a hurt matador making some sort of pig noise. This while starting almost seemed laughable until Jacob saw that the magical creature started to follow the dance through almost going into the briefcase in which would captured the creature until..</p>
<p align="center"> "OW!" A fish flew and smacked Jacob causing the bottle to fall. While a seal ran away laughing Jacob picked up the bottle slowly realizing that the cork that had been keeping the scent sealed in was currently missing which engulfed Jacob in its horrid scent. Jacob looked over as if to hope and pray that the scent hadn't reached the creature just yet but to his dismay the Erumpent had indeed smell the musk that had caught her attention away from the hopefully Scamander and instead the creature had eyes for Jacob. Immediately Jacob started running with the Erumpent at his feet. Jacob had found a tree that he could climb up without falling off.</p>
<p align="center">"Scamander  help!" Jacob cried watching as the creature raced towards him. Although before the creature could get near the tree a shot of light had appeared and oddly enough one of the lights had been flung off to the side causing the creature to be stunned enough for Scamander to catch the creature back into his briefcase.</p>
<p align="center">"Oh Jacob you can come down now" Scamander hollered looking happy as if there was nothing to be feared. Jacob climbed down the tree slowly as if the creature would jump out of the briefcase to finish the job it had started.</p>
<p align="center">"Hey Scamander was that one of those spells you used to stun and stop it from attacking?" Jacob asked confused. Scamander looked puzzled not knowing how to answer and just before he could they heard a rustling noise nearby.</p>
<p align="center">"Hello who's there?" Scamander asked aiming his wand towards the area casting Lumos (a spell which illuminates the tip of the wand). Scamander looked closely as a young boy with glasses slowly got up raising his hands.</p>
<p align="center"> "Sorry sir but my name is Harry sir, Harry Potter" Harry looked around while talking trying to find Hermione but without the use of his own wand he couldn't see anything. He had to come up with something, that was until he heard a rustling behind a bush which made the man turn his wand towards the bush.</p>
<p align="center">"And who are you?" Scamander said taking his eyes Harry Potter. A young girl whom looked like she had just fell from her broomstick stood up with her hands up as well.</p>
<p align="center">"I'm Hermione Granger a third year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry" Hermione admitted looking over at Harry almost feeling bad for saying to much.  Before Hermione could say anything else she felt something cut her hand which made her wince in pain. </p>
<p align="center"> Without thinking Harry drew his wand pointing towards the man as he walked over to Hermione. </p>
<p align="center">"Don't attack I'm just checking to make sure she is ok she got hit pretty hard by that creature" Harry said almost ready to lower his wand. Once Harry had gotten over to Hermione he could see that she had glass in her hand as well as sand. "Hermione what is that really?"</p>
<p align="center"> Hermione looked up as if she was to cry and before she could say anything to Harry a voice quickly perked up.</p>
<p align="center">"Merlin's Beard that's a time turner, but where on earth did you find one of those?" Scamander said not realizing he had just made the two jump and become very uncomfortable. "Sorry my Apologies my name is Newt Scamander a lover of magical creatures and I think we may need to talk about this indoors" Newt said coxing everyone into his briefcase in which sat now close to the tree and found its way into the hands of Tina Goldstein  whom looked like she had seen an episode from an horror film.</p>
