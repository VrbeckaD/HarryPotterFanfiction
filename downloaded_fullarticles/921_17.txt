    <p>
  <span>Harry took one look at his cousin’s expression, watching as Dudley and his little gang of friends walked down the street, and stood up. The moon shone down on his cousin and his ‘friends’, providing the only light other than the pitiful street lights. He was sitting on one of the swings in the playground, having been exiled after dinner. Or… whatever dinner he could get from his uncle and aunt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, Potter! How about a game?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry flinched before turning around and taking off in the opposite direction of the house. The house where no one cared about him or saw to it that he got enough food. He ran through the street, passing cars, and down another street, hearing the yells of his cousin and his gang.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He ran down the street, distantly recognizing this street, and was about to turn around and head back to the house, when he ran right into a truck. He reeled back, eyes wide, as he looked up at the blue and red truck cab. The truck that he had never seen before. The truck that had its driver’s seat open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was parked at the end of the street, on the corner and a few feet away from the street light. Harry probably hadn’t seen it because of that, because most of their neighbors kept their cars in their garage, in their driveway or right under a street light.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry glanced behind him, hearing Piers and Dudley laugh about him, then made up his mind. His cousin and the gang were close. The truck seemed unoccupied. He climbed up the small step and hopped into the truck cab, closing the door quietly enough that he hoped that no one heard him. He ducked down into the footwell, hoping that no one would see him, and froze, trying to calm his breathing down. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Optimus Prime started awake from his deep recharge as his driver’s seat door closed. He glanced into the driver’s seat in his cab, optics widening at the small human that had made his way into Optimus’ cab. The little one was breathing heavily, a  human boy of about seven. The boy had short, untamed black hair and clothes that didn’t fit him, were multiple sizes too big.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The human boy was breathing in short, shallow breaths, tucked into the passenger seat footwell. Optimus watched as the boy stayed frozen, didn’t even look around him at the truck. But the boy did eventually look up, allowing Optimus to get a good look at his green eyes and the vivid scar on his forehead. The scar was shaped like one of the lightning bolts that came with a winter storm on Earth, pointing downward towards the boy’s nose. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Optimus looked out at the street in front of him, looking for any indication for why the human boy was now inside him. The street was an ordinary one, houses running along the sides of it and street lights lighting up and occasionally flickering. He had chosen this street because it was ordinary, no police, no firefighters, no government to be found on this human street.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A pack of more human boys came running towards the alley. These human boys were big and sturdy and if Optimus was any judge, leaning towards overweight. But he would leave the medical opinions to Ratchet, whom he dearly missed. The young boy inside his truck went even more still as the boys outside yelled, shouting for someone called Harry or… Optimus let his engines turn on, let them growl as one of the boys called out with another name… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Freak!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sudden sound of loud, growling engines startled the group of boys in front of Optimus and they yelled out in surprise, running off in the other direction. The young boy inside his truck shivered in fear, whimpered a little. And… Optimus started a little too, at the amount of… power that emanated from the boy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was unfamiliar, not born of energon but of something from this Earth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Optimus turned his engines off, not wanting to scare the boy even more and watched him. The young human quieted down, his body falling still, as he snuck up onto the passenger seat and peered through the window. The boy stared out, seemingly watching as the group of boys ran off, then sighed in relief. Optimus watched as the boy’s body began to quiver again then on a hunch, he turned on the heaters in his truck, quietly so that the boy wasn’t frightened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Optimus watched as the boy slowly slumped into the comfortable passenger seat, his eyes slowly closing as he curled up. The boy’s eyes drooped closed, body stilling then relaxing into the added heat, and a few minutes later, fell asleep.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry blinked awake, the sun streaming through the truck’s windows and falling right on his eyes. He stared at the steering wheel of the truck, peering over at it from the passenger seat, studying the weird looking icon in the middle then stiffened. He had fallen asleep in this truck, in this truck that probably belonged to someone. Harry yelped and pushed open the passenger door and jumped out, knowing that the Dursley’s wouldn’t even give a shit that he hadn’t come back last night. But if someone owned this truck and found him in there…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though he did vaguely remember hearing classical music during the night. He had woken up from one of his nightmares of a green light and cackling laughter to quiet music, a piano playing through the radio. It had sent him right back to sleep, drifting off against the comfortable passenger seat. And he hadn’t been cold at all. He remembered the engines of the truck turning on last night too, scaring off Dudley and his gang.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it was him that did those things. Maybe it was like when he had appeared on the school rooftop last year. He shrugged and with one last glance at the blue truck with the red flaming stripes, he walked back to the place where he slept and lived.</span>
