    <p>The day had started out like any other day. Sixteen-year-old Steve Rogers was sitting outside in the tiny greenspace near his house sketching, when there was a blinding flash of golden light. When he could see again there was the body of a small boy lying in front of him. Seeing the blood, he threw down his sketch pad and rushed to see if the boy was still alive. Noticing the rise and fall of the boy’s chest Steve let out a sigh of relief. Looking up Steve called out to his friend, glad for once that James Barnes was never far. “Bucky! I need a hand over here!”</p><p>“Steve, what’s going on? Are you okay…who’s this?”</p><p>“I don’t know. He came running around the corner looking panicked and scared, then he fell and passed out. You have to help me take him home.” Steve was quick to lie in order to cover up the boys clearly magical arrival.</p><p>“Steve, we don’t know anything about him…”</p><p>“Bucky, he’s bleeding out. We need to get him to my Ma, so she can patch him up. He’s in no condition to do anything to anyone.”</p><p>Shaking his head Bucky bent down to pick the small boy up. “You better run ahead and warn your Ma Steve.”</p><p>Nodding Steve took off towards his house. He was glad Bucky had suggested he go ahead. Crashing through his front door Steve yelled for his mom. “Ma! Ma, we need your help!”</p><p>Sarah Rogers stepped out of her room, her hair a wild mess. “Steve sweetie, what’s wrong? Are you hurt?”</p><p>“No Ma, its not me or Bucky. I don’t know where he came from, he just appeared out of nowhere. His back is badly injured and he’s losing a lot of blood. I think we need to call granddad.”</p><p>Nodding, Sarah tied her apron and pulled her hair up into a messy bun before clearing off the kitchen table. “Where is he?”</p><p>“Bucky’s bringing him.”</p><p>“Go get my emergency kit then call your granddad.” Not waiting to see if her son followed her orders, Sarah put pots of water on the stove to boil while covering the table with a stained, but sterile cloth. Steve returned with his mother’s emergency kit just as Bucky arrived carrying the small boy. “Put him down on the table James.” While Bucky put the boy down Sarah gathered what she needed from her kit. “If you need to head home James, Stephen and I can handle this.”</p><p>Understanding the dismissal when he heard it, Bucky frowned, but headed towards the door. “If you need help, you’ll come and get me?”</p><p>“Of course, James.”</p><p>“Don’t worry Bucky, Ma and I have this under control. I’ll let you know how he’s doing.”</p><p>With one last glance at the unconscious and bloody boy Bucky left, heading back to his house. The moment he left Steve pulled out a second emergency kit from behind the stove. Opening it he began pulling out potions and other magical medical supplies. “Granddad said he would floo in a couple of minutes with more supplies.”</p><p>“Good. Help me take his cloths off, I need to see just how badly he’s hurt.” Together mother and son worked to uncover and clean the boy’s injuries.</p><p>“Sarah? Steven?” a deep masculine voice called out from one from the back rooms.</p><p>“In the kitchen Da.” The man that entered the kitchen was tall and young looking, he looked no more than 30, though he was closer to 60. His shoulder length blond hair was tied back in a low ponytail. All in all, Lord Theodore Grant was a very imposing figure.</p><p> “Steven said this boy is probably magical, what have you found so far Sarah?” Theodore walked closer to the kitchen table, staring down at the unconscious boy.</p><p>“I haven’t had much time to examine him, but the cuts on his back are definitely magical in origin. Could you cast a diagnostic charm Da?”</p><p>“Of course, dear one.” Pulling out his wand Theodore allowed himself a moment to bemoan the fact that his only child was a squib and that due to his illnesses his grandson was little better. <em>Though, </em>he thought as he cast the spell. <em>It’s probably Steven’s magic keeping him alive though all his medical issues.</em> Scanning the parchment Theodore scowled and recast the spell.</p><p>“Dad…is everything alright?” silently he handed his daughter the parchment, then began casting spell upon spell on the boy. Reading the parchment Sarah paled, “oh my.”</p><p>“Ma? What’s going on?” coming up beside his mom Steve took the parchment from her hands and read it over.</p><p>
  <em>Hadrian (Harry) Jameson Potter-Black born July 31, 1980</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Father: Jameson (James) Fleamont Potter – deceased</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mother: Lily Elenore Evans – deceased</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Godfather: Sirius Orion Black – incapacitated </em>
</p><p>
  <em>List of Injuries</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Spider bite with poison – left leg</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Large cut – right arm</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Horcrux in curse scar….</em>
</p><p>Steve wasn’t sure which alarmed him most, the boy’s birthdate or the massive list of injuries. “How accurate is this Granddad?”</p><p>“Very. I can understand your concern, but I haven’t miscast a diagnostic spell since I started healer training. Somehow this boy managed to travel through time. By the looks of him, it’s not a very nice future.”</p><p>“While this is all very interesting, why don’t you help me stabilize him. We can talk about the merits of the future afterwards.” Properly scolded the two men turned back to the table in order to help heal the young boy.</p><p>Once Sarah and Theodore were certain that they had done all they could for the boy Theodore levitated him to Steve’s bed, which the boy had graciously offered up. Once he was sure his daughter and grandson had everything under control Theodore turned to leave. “Floo me if you need me and do let me know when he wakes. I left a supply of potions with Steven. This Hadrian hasn’t even woken yet and already our boy is taken with him.”</p><p>Sarah laughed. “So, I see. I don’t think Steve is going to leave his side. Don’t worry Da, we’ll keep you up to date. If I don’t floo you, Steve will.” Giving his daughter a hug and kiss Theodore floo’d back home, determined to return the next morning regardless if Sarah or Steven had floo’d or not.</p><p>In his room Steve had set about trying to make both Harry and himself as comfortable as possible given the lack of space and soft things. Once he was satisfied with the level of comfort he settled down on the floor beside his bed. He had thought about bringing a chair into the room, but the only chairs he could lift were the kitchen chairs and those were decidedly uncomfortable.</p><p>“Steve, honey, how are you doing?” Sarah poked her head into the room and had to supress a giggle. She was sure her son had hijacked every pillow and blanket in the house. “I better still have a pillow and blanket in my room.”</p><p>“Don’t worry Ma, we’re good and I didn't take anything from your room. I’ll stay with him; you need your sleep before your shift at the hospital tomorrow. I’ll floo granddad if I need anything. You don’t have to worry about us.”</p><p>Sarah smiled at her boy; he was too generous for his own good sometimes. Crossing the room, she kissed her sweet boy on the head. “Whatever did I do to earn such an amazing son?” Leaving the two boys to themselves Sarah headed for her room to attempt to get as much sleep as possible. In his room Steve checked over Harry once more before curling up in his nest of blankets and pillows beside the bed.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Harry woke slowly, sitting up he hissed in pain, his body on fire. Giving up on trying to sit Harry tried to remember what happened and figure out where he was. <em>This isn’t the hospital wing, so, where am I? the last thing I remember is dueling Voldemort and the golden cage. Merlin, I hurt. Where the hell are my glasses? </em></p><p>Hearing movement from the bed Steve jumped up. “Hey, its alright, you’re safe here. My name’s Steve Rogers. I found you in the park and brought you home to my Ma, who’s a nurse. She healed you up as much as possible. How are you feeling?”</p><p>Harry turned to face the large blur that was beside the bed. “My back feels like its on fire. Do you know where my glasses are?”</p><p>“Glasses? No sorry, I didn't see any glasses when I found you. If you give me a minute, I’ll floo my granddad and he might know what to do.”</p><p>“Wait!” Harry called before Steve could leave the room. “You’re magical?”</p><p>“Not really. My Granddad is a wizard, but Ma’s a squib and my Da was a no-Maj. Granddad says I’d be magical if I wasn’t so sick. He thinks my magic is the only think keeping me alive. Let me go and get him and I’ll be right back. Are you hungry at all? I can bring you some water and food if you want.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t help but smile at the other boy’s honest enthusiasm. “That would be nice. I think I could eat a little.”</p><p>“Alright. I’ll be right back.” Steve bounded out of the room and down the hall to the small floo room his granddad had installed when his parents got the house. Throwing in the powder Steve settled down on the pillow set in front of the fire. “Grant Manor!” it did not take long for Theodore to answer the call.</p><p>“Steven, is everything alright?”</p><p>“Yes granddad. Harry just woke up. He asked about his glasses, but I didn't see any when I found him.”</p><p>“Let me gather some potions for him and I’ll be right over.”</p><p>“I'm going to get him some water, then start making some porridge.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about food Steven. I’ll get Mist to make something and bring it over”</p><p>Ending the call Steve went into the kitchen to fetch Harry a glass of water. “Knock, knock. I talked to my granddad and he’s going to come over in a few minutes with some potions and he’s getting his house-elf to make us something to eat.” Sitting down beside the bed Steve put the glass of water down before helping Harry sit up. Pilling pillows behind him to help him stay upright. Once he was sure the other boy was stable Steve handed him the glass, which Harry gratefully drank down.</p><p>“Where am I?”</p><p>“Brooklyn.” Seeing the slight confusion on the other boy’s face and taking in his accent Steve continued. “New York.”</p><p>“America! How in Merlin’s name did I end up in America?”</p><p>“That is a very good question young man, but I think introductions should come before explanations. I am Lord Theodore Grant, young Steven’s grandfather.”</p><p>“Oh, um, I'm Harry.” Theodore narrowed his eyes in irritation, not that Harry could see. Steve, however, knew that look. While his Granddad might not be as stuck up as other Pureblood lords, he did follow the traditions, even after leaving England. If there was one thing Lord Theodore Grant hated most it was bad manners.</p><p>“First things first, may I cast a diagnostic spell on you? I would like to make sure your injuries are healing properly.” Harry nodded, feeling slightly numb and unsure. People didn't help him without wanting something from him. Steve and Theodore watched the emotions flash over Harry’s face with concern. With a quick glance at the parchment Theodore was glad to notice that nearly all of Harry’s injuries were healing well. “This is pain potion, it’s only a mild one so let us know if the pain continues.” Theodore pulled a vile out of his pocket and handed it to Harry. “Now, I believe Steven mentioned that you were missing your glasses. If you would allow me, I know a spell that corrects one’s eyesight.”</p><p>Harry perked right up. “Really? Yes! That would be amazing, not to have glasses.”</p><p>“Very well. Steven you need to move and Hadrian you need to remain as still as possible and keep your eyes open.” Harry didn't have a chance to correct the lord on his name as he quickly had the man’s wand pointed at his eyes. He couldn’t hear the spell, but he could soon see clearer than ever before.</p><p>“Brilliant! I have never seen so clearly before. Thank you.”</p><p>“You are most welcome young one. Now,” Theodore conjured a chair for himself. “Why don’t you tell us about yourself Hadrian. What happened to you to cause such injuries?”</p><p>Harry shifted as best he could without aggravating his injuries. “Well, I don’t know how much you’ve heard about what happened in England thirteen years ago,” Theodore and Steve both admitted to knowing nothing about it. Harry thought about how to explain for a moment before continuing. “Well the basics are that the Dark Lord Voldemort had risen to power, and my parents were part of the resistance against him. I don’t know why, no one will tell me, but he decided to kill me. He came to the house where my parents were hiding on Halloween 1981. The house had been under Fidelus, but their secret keeper was a traitor and told Voldemort where to find us. He killed my parents, but something happened when he tried to kill me, and he disappeared.” Harry found himself telling them a bit about his muggle relatives, the issue around his Hogwarts letter and the past four years at Hogwarts.</p><p>Theodore and Steve listened in shock, horror and amusement. “I hate to add to your troubles Hadrian, but…well there is no gentle way to put this, so I shall be direct and to the point. Not only have you traveled to America, but you have also traveled into the past, it is June 25, 1935.”</p><p>Steve watched the colour drain from Harry’s face. Wanting to comfort the other boy he reached out and took one of the small hands into his own. “Hey, it will be alright. I'm sure that your family and friends will be looking for ways to bring you home and we can do the same thing on our end.”</p><p>“Steven is correct. We shall do everything within our power to get you back to your time. For now, my daughter has said that you are more than welcome to stay with her and Steven. If you are still here come September, I shall arrange for you to attend Ilvermorny, which is our version of Hogwarts. When you are well, we shall go to Gringotts and see about opening you a vault. For now, though, you need to rest. I understand this must be extremely difficult for you but have no fear, we shall figure it all out in time. Steven, Mist shall be awaiting your call for when you boys need food.” Standing Theodore gave both boys’ shoulders a squeeze before leaving the room.</p><p>The pair sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, neither one releasing the hand of the other. A quiet pop startled them into finally releasing the other’s hand. “Mist is bringing young masters their breakfast. Master Grant is also sending potions that need to be taken.” The well-dressed house elf placed two trays down on the edge of the bed. “Young masters is to be calling Mist if they is needing anything else.” With stern look at the boys and a pointed finger she disappeared with a quiet pop.</p><p>The boys blinked, looked at each other and burst out laughing. Harry had to wrap an arm around his chest to hold his ribs, but it felt so good to have an honest laugh. He couldn’t really remember the last time he had laughed like this. Beside him Steve was noticing how Harry’s eyes lit up and sparkled with his laughter and after wishing that he could see what colour they were, he swore that he would do anything to see that happen again.</p><p>“I think we should eat before Mist comes back to really scold us, and you need to take those potions.” Steve stood and picked up the tray with the potion vials to hand to Harry before taking his own and settling back down on the bed beside the other boy.</p><p>Giving a small laugh Harry allowed Steve to place the tray on his lap. Picking up the second tray Steve sat down beside Harry he wasn’t sure if he was glad that because of how small the bed was they were sitting close enough that their legs were touching. The boys ate their breakfast in silence with Steve taking their trays to the kitchen when they were finished, returning with a refilled glass of water for Harry.</p><p>“I’m assuming I’m stuck here for a while hun?” Harry asked with a little glare directed at the bed.</p><p>Steven laughed at the look. “Yeah, granddad wants you to stay in bed for a couple of days at least. I’ll stay and keep you company. Schools done and I don’t have a job, so you get my undivided attention.” Something about what Steve said and how he said it made Harry blush and duck his head. Noticing the blush made Steve want to see it again.</p><p>“What do you suggest we do to pass the time?” Harry asked when he finally felt the heat leave his face.</p><p>“We can take turns asking questions, but we both have to answer their question. It’ll make the time go by and we can get to know each other.”</p><p>“That sounds alright, who goes first?”</p><p>“Well, seeing as you’re the reason we’re stuck here you can go first.” Steve joked.</p><p>“How old are you?”</p><p>“I’m sixteen, but I’m turning seventeen on July forth, you?”</p><p>“I’ll be fifteen on July thirty-first. Your turn.”</p><p>“What did your parents do? Ma’s a nurse and my dad was a solder. He died not long after I was born, during the Great War.”</p><p>“Your dad fought in the First World War? That’s a neat piece of history. I don’t know what my parents did. No ones told me much about them, I didn’t even know what they looked like until my first Christmas at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“That’s horrible…wait did you say First World War? You mean there’s another one coming?”</p><p>“Oh Merlin,” Harry put his head in his hands. “I forgot I’m in the past. Yeah, there’s a second one coming, but I don’t know too many details. We hadn’t covered it in school before I started Hogwarts.</p><p>“That’s alright. I’m sure it’s probably better not knowing too much. What Hogwarts like?” Steve quickly asked not wanting Harry to dwell on the slip up.</p><p>“That question is against the rules,” Harry laughed. “But I suppose I can indulge you, on one condition. You have to tell me what’s its like to live here.”</p><p>“Deal.”</p><p>The pair took turns telling stories of their childhood, though Harry was careful about which stories he told. They only took a small break when Mist brought them their lunch, so both were a little shocked when Sarah poked her head in. “How are you boys doing?”</p><p>“Ma! Your home, what time is it?” Steve jumped up to give his mom a hug.</p><p>Sarah laughed. “It’s almost seven, I just got home and thought I’d check up on you both before I made dinner. How are you feeling Harry?” Sarah carefully made her way across the minefield of pillows and blankets to stand next to the bed.</p><p>“I’m alright Mrs. Rogers.”</p><p>“No significant pain or swelling?”</p><p>“No ma’am.”</p><p>“Do you mind if I have a look at your back? I’d like to make sure everything is healing properly.” Slowly and carefully Harry leaned forward, allowing Sarah to lift his shirt and look at the angry red marks crisscrossing his back. Prodding the marks gently Sarah nodded her headend lowered Harry’s shirt. “Everything seems to be healing nicely. You still need to be careful about your movements, but you should be able to get out of bed sooner rather than later. Now, I’m going to make dinner. Steve you should go and let James know that Harry is alright.”</p><p>Steve looked back at Harry causing them both to laugh. “Steve, I’m sure Harry will be fine without you for a little while.”</p><p>“Your mums right. I’ll be alright by myself for a bit. You should go.”</p><p>Laughing Steve held up his hands in surrender. “Alright, I get it. I’ll go and let Bucky know everything is fine. I shouldn’t be too long.”</p><p>Sarah smiled at her son, “as long as your home in time for dinner.” Giving both boys a kiss on the forehead she stood and left the room. Harry stared at the open door with a shocked/confused look on his face.</p><p>“Harry,” Steve reached out to hold the other boy’s hand. When Harry looked up at him, Steve could see the smaller boy’s eyes were shining with unshed tears.</p><p>“Is that what having a mum feels like?” Steve gave him a sad smile and slowly wrapped an arm around him pulling him close. “Ron’s mum always insisted I was part of the family, and she gave me a few hugs, but she never treated me the same as her kids.” Not knowing what to say Steve stayed silent, just holding the smaller boy. After a while Harry gently pulled away blushing. “Thanks Steve. You should probably go and see your friend. I’ve taken up enough of your time.”</p><p>Steve gave Harry one more gently squeeze. “It’s no problem Harry. I really don’t mind at all. I’ll tell Bucky to come by in a few days to properly meet you, if your feeling up to it.”</p><p>“That sounds good. I’d like to meet your Bucky.”</p><p>“I’ll be back soon.” Steve stood and reluctantly left the room, stopping in the kitchen to talk with his mom. “Ma,” he said quietly, not wanting to startle her.</p><p>Sarah turned from the stove but paused when she saw the look on her son’s face. “What’s wrong love?”</p><p>“It’s Harry. He asked if that’s what it feels like to have a mom after you kissed him.”</p><p>“Oh, the poor dear. Well I’ll make sure to do that more often.”</p><p>“Thanks Ma. I'm heading over to Buck’s, but I’ll be home for dinner.” Feeling relieved Steve left the apartment and headed down the street to Bucky’s place.</p><p>Back in the room Harry found himself enjoying the privacy, yet missing Steve’s company at the same time. When he was sure he was alone, because he honestly expected Steve to come rushing right back. “Okay,” he leaned back against the headboard and hugged his knees. “Somehow, while duelling Voldemort I ended up in 1935 America. How the hell am I supposed to find a way home when I have no idea how I got here in the first place? I'm sure Dumbledore will try to find me, maybe Hermione might find something. I wonder if I could leave a message for them. But do I really want to? Here I have a chance to start again, be just Harry.”</p><p>Overcome by uncertainly Harry buried his face into his knees. Standing in the doorway Sarah couldn’t help but feel bad for the poor boy. Walking over she set the cup of tea down on the nightstand then sat down on the bed next to the lost boy. Reaching over she pulled him close and held him, just like she had done so many times for Steve when he was sick. “Oh sweetie, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Harry had frozen when he first felt the touch but melted into the embrace when he realized it was Sarah holding him. Hearing her call, him sweetie broke the dam holding back his tears.</p><p>Before he knew it, Harry was telling her everything, about his relatives, finding out he was a wizard, his years at Hogwarts, having everyone love him one minute then hating him the next. He told her all about the tournament and Ron turning on him, how he wasn’t sure he could really trust his friends, how much he hated his fame. “Is it wrong of me to not want to go back?” he finally asked. His tears had long since dried out and he felt wrung out and tired.</p><p>“No sweetie,” Sarah said, gently pushing Harry’s head to lay on her shoulder and running her fingers through his hair. “Its not wrong to want a fresh start away from all that. I’ll tell you right now, even if we find a way to get you back you are welcome to stay here if that is what you want.”</p><p>“You’d let me stay, even knowing I had a home to go to?”</p><p>Gently Sarah moved so she held Harry’s face between her hands and looked him hard in the eye. “Sweetie, I don’t know what they have told you, but what you had is not a home. How your aunt and uncle treated you is not right. They are lucky they are not alive yet because I would be heading to England to give them a piece of my mind. And how the English wizards treated you is no better. I'm hoping that you have the chance to learn what a family is supposed to be like. I know it’s a little early, but when you feel up to it you are more than welcome to call me mum. Now I've brought you some tea.” Sarah released Harry’s face and turned to look at the now lukewarm cup and laughed.</p><p>“Well…I will go and put on another pot and when you are feeling up to it you may come join me in the kitchen but,” she held up a hand to stop Harry from jumping up. “You must take it slow and you tell me the moment you are in pain so I can get you another potion, understood?”</p><p>Harry nodded. “Yes ma’am.”</p><p>Getting up Sarah kissed his head, picked up the now cool cup of tea and headed for the door. “The bathroom is across the hall and the kitchen is at the far end. You take your time Sweetie, there is no rush.” Giving Harry one more motherly smile Sarah headed to the kitchen to put on more tea, she would have preferred something stronger after listening to Harry’s story, but she refused to indulge with an injured child under her roof.</p><p>In Steve’s room Harry forced himself to calm down before slowly getting out of bed and making his way to the bathroom. After freshening up a little Harry slowly made his way down the hall, to his right was a small living room that despite its size looked warm and cozy. To the left was the slightly larger kitchen. It reminded Harry a lot of the kitchen at the Burrow. The coal range was in the corner close to the door, across from the range was a small round dinning table with four matching chairs. The window had a small collection of plants growing on the sill while the shear white curtains swayed in the slight breeze. Across the kitchen clothing hung on lines to dry. There was something about this room that screamed of home.</p><p>“Perfect timing sweetie. Tea’s done, come and sit down you shouldn’t be on your feet for long.” Sarah placed a tea set down on the table and poured Harry a cup. “Are you hungry at all?” she asked while pouring herself a cup.</p><p>“A little, but I can wait for dinner. I think if I ate now, I wouldn’t be able to handle anything for dinner.”</p><p>“Well then you just sit there and enjoy a cuppa. Despite being American now, I can still make a proper cup of tea, my dad ensured that.”</p><p>Taking a sip Harry sighed. Sarah was very good at making tea. “This is better than how the elves at Hogwarts make tea. Your dad’s English then?”</p><p>“Technically, we’re Irish, but dad grew up in England and went to Hogwarts. The Grant’s have been Hufflepuff’s since the begging.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “I can definitely see Steve as a Hufflepuff.”</p><p>“Its unfortunate that even if he had enough magic my Steve wouldn’t have gone to Hogwarts.” Sarah was interrupted by the front door opening. “Speak of the devil.” Reaching over she pulled out another cup and placed it on the table beside Harry’s.</p><p>“Mom, I'm back.” Steve called from the doorway.</p><p>“We’re in the kitchen honey.”</p><p>“Bucky says hi mom and he's thinking of coming over tomorrow to meet…Harry! You're out of bed! How are you feeling?” seeing Harry sitting at the table Steve rushed over to sit beside him.</p><p>Harry had to laugh at Steve’s enthusiasm. Hufflepuff indeed. “Your mom said I was alright to come and sit here. I'm doing alright, though I’ll need another pain potion before bed tonight. How’s your friend?”</p><p>“Buck’s good, just a little protective of me. He was a little reluctant to bring you here, sure that you were going to attack me or something.”</p><p>Harry laughed. “Just a little protective? What did he think I was going to do to you while I was bleeding out?”</p><p>“Who knows sometimes with Bucky?” Steve shrugged.</p><p>“Oh, don’t be insulting James like that Steven. You know that boy has watched out for you since you met. He worries about you just as much as I do. He just wants to make sure you are safe. I know you haven’t had an attack in the last few weeks but...” Sarah said as she placed the food on the table. “Now, how was your day?”</p><p>After dinner Steve helped Harry back to his room and into the bed. Not long after Sarah poked her head in. “You boys good for the night?”</p><p>“Yes Ma, we’re good.”</p><p>“Alright. Here’s a pain potion Harry. I expect you to take it when you need it or just before you go to sleep.” Placing the vial on the bedside table Sarah kissed both boys on the head while giving them a quick squeeze. “Good night boys don’t stay up too late. You both need your sleep.”</p><p>“Night Ma.”</p><p>“Good night Mrs. Rogers.”</p><p>Steve and Harry kept each other awake for hours, swapping stories about their crazier adventures until Harry's injuries became too much and they had to call it a night.</p><p>The next morning Sarah once again checked Harry’s back, but found it slightly irritated. “Today there is to be no moving beyond going to the toilet and back. I shouldn’t have let you up last night, so you’ll have to rest a bit more. Here are your potions. I’m sure Mist will be coming with breakfast soon but remember to tell her not to bring lunch if James is coming over. You’ll have to make do with what we have here. Have a good day boys. I’ll see you both later.” Kissing both boys Sarah left for the day.</p><p>Harry sighed and slumped down, feeling dejected. “Hey,” Steve nudged Harry’s legs. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll stay here with you and Bucky will come by later. He’ll probably bring cards and we can play.”</p><p>“I don’t know muggle card games.”</p><p>“Then we’ll teach you. Don’t worry about it. Though we should come up with a reason for your arrival and injuries.”</p><p>“Well, we could tell the truth...”</p><p>Steve shook his head. “No, we have to avoid all mentions of magic. I’m technically breaking the law just by being friends with him.”</p><p>“What! You have to be kidding me?”</p><p>“No, I’m not. Rapport’s Law is extremely harsh about No-Maj relations. So, we can’t tell him anything.”</p><p>“Well...what about the truth, minus the magic?”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“Well,” Harry shifted a little in the bed feeling slightly uncomfortable. “We tell him that my uncle is the one to have hurt me. I’ve been living with my aunt and Uncle since my parents died. Recently my uncle had a business deal here in New York and he brought me along with him. He wanted me to...to...to help him convince the men to sign the deal, but when I refused, he whipped me. As soon as I could I ran away from him, but got lost easily, which is where you found me.”</p><p>Gently Steve put his hand on the smaller boy’s shoulder. “Hey, it’s ok now. You don’t have to talk about it with me, but I know Ma will want to know and she can help. For now, just remember, those people haven’t even been born yet.” Slowly Steve’s hand travelled across Harry’s shoulders to pull him into a hug. While he was calmly helping Harry, inwardly he was screaming and wanting blood.</p><p>At first Harry wasn’t sure what to do. He had only been hugged – read tackled – by Hermione and the motherly hug from Mrs. Rogers. Yet, he soon found himself melting into the embrace. There was something about Steve’s touch that made Harry feel safe and warm, and there was something else, but he absolutely refused to think on that feeling just yet.</p><p>Hearing the front door open Steve quickly, but gently pulled away from Harry. “Bucky’s here.” He Explained, not wanting Harry to think the worst. Nodding Harry rearranged himself on the bed, trying to look casual or at least as casual a beaten lost teen in a different country could be.</p><p>“Stevie?” A voice called from the living room.</p><p>“We’re in my room Buck.”</p><p>James Barns had been feeling anxious and unsure since he brought that strange boy to Steve’s place, two things he was not used to feeling. He couldn’t believe he had allowed Steve to convince him to bring that boy to his house. How was he to know if this kid was a threat or not. Sure, Steve had been feeling alright the last couple of weeks, but what if an attack happened. It wouldn’t be the first time Steve suffered from one of his sickness’ suddenly. He wouldn’t be able to live with himself if Steve got sick and this stranger took advantage and hurt the punk. Standing in the open doorway of Steve’s room James paused to get a good look at the threat, only to find a tiny hurt and lost boy sitting on the punk’s bed.</p><p>“Harry, this is my best friend, James Barnes, but we just call him Bucky. Buck, this is Harry Potter. He’s staying with us for now.”</p><p>“Okay,” Bucky sat down on the edge of the bed. “You two better start explaining.”</p><p>“Well, Harry here was-”</p><p>“It’s ok Steve,” Harry put his hand on the other boy’s arm to quiet him. “I can tell him.”</p><p>The pair shared a look, then Steve nodded and backed down. Buck was surprised when Steve shot him a warning glare. <em>The Punk seems protective of the little brat. I'll have to bother him about that later.</em> Giving Steve a slight nod of understanding, Bucky turned his attention to Harry.</p><p>Harry, meanwhile, had missed the silent conversation of the other boys as he was busy having a breakdown. He had never told anyone about what his uncle had done. Even if he hadn’t said what Vernon had done, it was the closest he had ever come to telling anyone about it. <em>Why did I tell Steve? I know we could have come up with an excuse for why I am here. What is it about him that makes me trust him like that? I’ve never even thought about telling Ron or Hermione.</em></p><p>“-arry? Harry? Steve reached over and touched the smaller boy’s shoulder causing Harry to flinch away. Moving so quickly pulled on his scabs and Harry couldn’t repress the hiss of pain. “Oh god Harry, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to startle you. We called your name a couple of times, but you wouldn’t answer. Are you alright? Do I need to get Granddad?”</p><p>Harry blinked a few times to clear his head. “No, it’s okay Steve. I’m alright. I defiantly pulled the scabs, and I’ll need some of those pain meds your mum gave me earlier, but not right now. Promise.”</p><p>James watched the pair with eagle-like eyes. He could tell there was something going on between them. He wasn’t stupid, no matter what the teachers like to tell his mother. He knew that Stevie liked blokes more than dolls, but he wasn’t going to say anything until the stupid punk told him. Sighing Bucky gave Harry what he hoped was a concerned/understanding look. “Who beat you?”</p><p>“W-what?” Harry stared at James, startled.</p><p>“That flinch was too instinctive to just be surprise. Who hits you?”</p><p>“M-my uncle and cousin, sometimes my aunt.”</p><p>“And your parents haven’t noticed or done anything about it?”</p><p>“BUCK!” Steve yelled at his friend wanting to protect Harry from the pain.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“They’re dead.” Harry looked down at his hands clutching the blanket like a lifeline. He was surprised when Steve’s hand came to hold both of his in a comforting grip. Releasing the blanket Harry held onto Steve’s hand tightly. “My parents died when I was fifteen months old. I was left on my aunt’s doorstep with a note. They never wanted me and made sure I knew it.”</p><p>“Your Ma’s letting him stay with you?” Steve nodded, glad his friend understood without needing to be told more. “Good. Now, what have you two been up to?”</p><p>When Sarah arrived home that night, she had to supress a laugh. Clearly the boys had gotten sick and tired of being stuck in Steve’s room as they had taken over the living room. All the blankets and pillows Steve had horded had been moved, along with, “Is that your mattress?”</p><p>“Oh. Hi Ma. We didn't see you there.”</p><p>“Clearly. What have you three been up to?”</p><p>“Well, we started teaching Harry how to paly poker, but it got a little cramped, so we decided to move.”</p><p>“Don’t worry Mrs. Rogers, I carried both Harry and the mattress out here.”</p><p>“Thank you, James. Will you be staying for dinner?”</p><p>“I would love to, but no. My Ma wants me home on time tonight.”</p><p>“Well then you had best get a move on young man. It is already after five.”</p><p>“Oh shit. Ma’s gonna kill me if I'm late again.” Buck jumped up and rushed for the door ignoring Sarah’s chastisement about his language.</p><p>“Well,” Sarah closed the door behind a running Bucky. “It looks like you two will be sleeping here tonight.”</p><p align="center">~*~*~*~</p><p>Harry woke feeling a little excited. Finally, after nearly a week on bed rest, he was finally allowed out and to top it all off Theodore was taking him and Steve to the American Gringotts. “Come along boys. I want to get everything done with the bank as soon as possible. I have an appointment at the ministry later this morning. Once we are done at the bank, I shall leave you boys to your shopping. If I am unable to return, then I shall send Mist to you. Grab hold and we will Apparate to Heilig Way. Hold tight now.”</p><p>Harry felt like he was being squeezed through a tube. It was all he could do upon landing to not loose his breakfast. “You alright Harry?” Steve reached out to help his friend upright. Harry only nodded. He was sure if he opened his mouth, he would lose what little control he had over his stomach. When he was satisfied both boys were alright Theodore directed them towards Gringotts.</p><p>Looking around the alley Harry felt like he was eleven again. While it had the same magical feeling as Diagon Alley, Heilig Way was more organized and open. Beside him Steve was smiling, happy that Harry was showing more emotions again. After Bucky had left after that first visit Harry had reluctantly told Sarah what his uncle had done to him. Steve hadn’t been there, once his mother had an idea of what Harry wanted to talk about, she had sent him to his granddad’s. When he had returned it was to find Harry passed out from exhaustion while his mother held him crying. He never asked what they had talked about, but his mother said Harry would tell him when he was ready. Since that night Harry had been withdrawn and quiet.</p><p>Entering Gringotts the boys followed close behind Theodore to one of the open tellers. “Good Morning. I would like to speak to Stonehammer.” The lord spoke with authority. The teller looked the group over then descended from his perch to speak with one of the guards. Returning to his post the teller simply pointed to the waiting area. Nodding to the goblin Theodore guided the boys to the line of benches on the far wall.</p><p>“Never let the goblin rudeness get to you. State what you need simply and directly. They value directness over the simpering politeness other magicals give them. Never call them sir, they see it as an insult being address like a human. Whenever you can use their name, address them as master goblin or simply avoid the use of a name all together. If you can earn the respect of the goblin in charge of your account, then they will make sure to invest your gold well and inform you of any issues.”</p><p>“Very true Lord Grant. I'm glad to see you teaching the younglings properly.” Coming up behind the lord was a very well-dressed goblin.</p><p>“Stonehammer. I'm hoping you can help us with a small problem.”</p><p>“Let us retire to my office then.” The goblin led them through a twisting turning maze of rock tunnels until they arrived at a large marble door. Pushing the door open with surprising ease the goblin entered the lavishly decorated office. “Sit,” he pointed to the grouping of chairs in front of the large marble desk. “What is the issue I can help with Lord Grant?”</p><p>“Well, to begin with both boys will need an inheritance test done.”</p><p>“Very well.” Nodding, Stonehammer reached into his desk and pulled out a small ritual dagger and two pieces of parchment. “Who’s first?”</p><p>“I’ll go first,” Steve said reaching for the dagger. He knew that his would cause the least amount of problems.</p><p>“Place seven drops of blood on the parchment. No more, no less.” Stonehammer passed one of the parchments to Steve.</p><p>Harry watched fascinated as Steve cut his finger and allowed seven drops of blood to fall onto the parchment. All three wizards were curious to what the test would show and didn't look away as the parchment absorbed the blood and writing appeared.</p><p>

</p><p> “What’s a soul connection?” Steve asked as he looked up from the parchment.</p><p>“A soul connection or soul bond is someone with whom your soul connects with who is not related to you through blood. It can be parental, sibling, child, friend or lover. There have been people who have discovered the connection before ever meeting the other person. The type of connection can also change, depending on the interactions and feelings of the pair.”</p><p>“Is this soul connection why I was so quick to trust Steve, Mrs. Rogers and Lord Grant?” Harry had to know if this soul connection thing was affecting him.</p><p>Stonehammer shrugged. “Sometimes it can promote feelings of trust, but not once in any documented case of soul connections was that trust misplaced. After all it is your own soul and magic telling you that you can trust this person.”</p><p>“Hadrian,” Theodore looked over at the younger teen. “Would you like to do yours now?”</p><p>Harry could only nod. He was both excited and horribly nervous to see what his test said. Slowly he took the dagger from Steve, cut his finger and counted out seven drops of blood. Just like with Steve’s the parchment soaked up the blood before writing appeared. Taking a deep breath Harry looked down at the writing.</p><p>

</p><p><em>Horcrux in curse scar</em>......</p><p>“Well, once again you have made light of a larger issue Lord Grant.” Stonehammer looked a little pale as he stared at Harry’s test. “Well, perhaps we can begin with the easier question of how you arrived here Heir Potter-Black?”</p><p>Knowing how difficult the story was for the younger boy, Steve reached out and took hold of Harry’s hand. Taking a deep breath and holding onto Steve’s hand with both his own Harry began telling his story. Taking comfort in Steve’s presence and what Sarah had told him days before, Harry left nothing out of his story. When he started talking about his uncle, Harry had to look down at his hands holding onto Steve’s in a hold that had to be boarding on painful for the other teen, yet he said nothing. He just held on.</p><p>When he finished his tale all three males were horrified. Unable to let the small boy continue alone Steve stood, pulled Harry upright and sat down in the now vacant chair before pulling Harry down onto his lap. At first Harry was shocked by the contact, but quickly relaxed into Steve’s embrace.</p><p>“Ah,” Stonehammer cleared his throat. “If you want to return to your own time we can-”</p><p>“NO!” Steve glared at his grandfather and the goblin. “No. Harry isn’t going back to those monsters.”</p><p>Theodore wasn’t sure if he should be proud that the boy was standing up for what he believed in or frustrated that the brat was daring to glare at him. “Unfortunately, that is not your decision to make Steven.”</p><p>“But,”</p><p>“But nothing Steven. By his telling Hadrian has had his choices taken from him. We will not do the same as those…people. It is Hadrian’s choice alone if he stays or if he returns to his own time. All we shall do is make sure he has all the information in order to make a properly informed decision. I apolgize Stonehammer, you were saying.”</p><p>“We can leave a note with our London branch to be open after Heir Potter-Black disappears, letting the headmaster know so he can arrange a way home. Now, I would need to double-check with our branch manager, but I believe we have a ritual that would return Heir Potter-Black to his own time. In the meantime, we need to do a cleanse on Heir Potter-Black to remove all the blocks and compulsions. We shall also remove the horcrux. I shall leave it up to you Lord Grant when and how you would like to explain it to the boys. While Heir Potter-Black is in the ritual room I shall have papers drawn up to place him under your guardianship Lord Grant. I will also begin transferring a small Potter vault to be used by Heir Potter-Black while he is here with arrangement for it to be paid back through the main vault after his disappearance. This is healer Stormclaw. She will take you to the ritual chamber Heir Potter-Black.”</p><p>Harry looked up at the female goblin, then back at Steve. “Its alright. If it were allowed, I would be right there with you. I’ll be right here when you get back.” Giving his hand a squeeze, Steve helped Harry stand and nudged him towards the goblin healer.</p><p>“If it would make you feel more comfortable Heir Potter-Black, Heir Grant may accompany us to the ritual chamber and wait outside.” Stormclaw smiled at the relieved look on both their faces and gestured for them to follow her.</p><p>Theodore and Stonehammer laughed when the office door closed behind the boys. “They have no clue, do they?” Stonehammer asked smiling.</p><p>“No.” Theodore agreed with the goblin. “I think Steve has a small idea, but Hadrian is absolutely clueless. If they are not courting by the end of the summer, I may have to step in and help them.”</p><p>“When they do begin courting, let them know that it is highly likely for them to become pregnant. Mates with a soul connection conceive easier and with your heir’s medical issues they will have to be doubly cautious.”</p><p>Theodore nodded. He would need to speak to both boys about sex, not a prospect he relished. “Let us get the guardianship paperwork done first. I have a meeting at eleven.”</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Harry held tight onto Steve’s hand grateful the other boy was here with him. “This is as far as Heir Grant may go. There is a chair for you to wait in. Heir Potter-Black, please come with me.”</p><p>“Don’t worry Harry. The goblins won’t let anything happen to you and I’ll be right here when you’re done.” Letting go of Harry’s hand Steve settled himself down in the chair, watching as Stormclaw guided Harry into the ritual room. Steve wasn’t sure how long he sat there for, whether it was two minutes or two hours, he just kept meditating. Getting upset or worked up was never a good idea for him, it always led to him getting sick. So, he just kept meditating, focusing on his Occulmency shields. He was glad for the focused calm when Harry finally emerged looking frazzled and unsure. Standing Steve quickly made his way over to the other boy and wrapped his arms around him securely. “You ok?”</p><p>“Yeah…just really worn out.”</p><p>“Come along boys. Stonehammer will be waiting for us.” Hand in hand they followed Stormclaw back to the office.</p><p>“I trust everything went well.” Stonehammer stood to greet the boys. “I had snacks delivered. I understand the cleansing ritual takes a lot out of a person.” He gestured to a small table covered in food set in between two large comfortable couches. Still, feeling a little numb Harry allowed himself to be guided onto one of the couches and gratefully accepted a cup of tea.</p><p>“Unfortunately, Lord Grant could not stay like he wished, but he bid me to tell you to enjoy the afternoon in the alley. He left a purse of Dragots for you both to spend. I will also let you know that Lord Grant is now your guardian Heir Potter-Black. If you decide to stay in this time, it will be Lord Grant’s responsibility to look after your magical education, including financing it. We were also able to transfer one of the more obscure Potter vaults here for you. Notes have been written that will be left with our London branch, depending on what you choose. I don’t want to want to pressure you Heir Potter-Black, but if you intend to stay your name needs to be down for new students at Ilvermorny by July 20. Try not to think about it for the rest of the afternoon. Enjoy exploring the alley.”</p><p>When they were done eating (Stonehammer refused to let them leave before), Stonehammer handed over a bag filled with Dragots as he escorted them to the entrance. Thanking the goblin, the two boys left the bank, feeling better out in the sunshine. “Well,” Steve shook the bag making the coins jingle. “Let’s go shopping.”</p>
