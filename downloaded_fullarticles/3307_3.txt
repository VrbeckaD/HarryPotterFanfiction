    <p>“Harry, It's fine.” I look up at my godfather as he is re-reading the list of materials for the fourth time today. </p><p>    “I know, I just want to make sure you have everything. Don’t want you to get there and not have what you need.” </p><p>    I smiled up at the man. “I think I have everything, and if I don’t… Well, then it must not have been put on the list because I am pretty sure you have looked over that 4 times since Diagon alley.” </p><p>    He gave me a smirk and leaned in for a hug as the horn from the train sounded singling that it would be leaving soon. “See you at Christmas,” I said into his shoulder, I had to get on my tippy toes to do so, but I made it work. </p><p>    “See you then. And write, we want to know what is happening over there.” He let go of the hug and smiled. “Don’t forget to tell Headmistress McGonagall good luck.” </p><p>I laughed at “Will do.” I started walking towards the entrance to the train, ready as I would ever have been when I was stopped. </p><p>“Oh, and tell Nevill I said hi.” I smiled at him and entered the Hogwarts express. The walls were lined with boxcars and the walkway was fairly thin. I looked in the box to find a preferable empty one with no prevails. But after I walked a little farther I found a car with no one in it besides a girl that looked about my age. </p><p>Her robes hung loosely on her frame and the black clashed against her Navy tinted hair. “Is this cart taken?” I asked. </p><p>“Yes, it is filled to the brim with non-existence people.” She smiled and tilted her head as I walked into the car, closing doors behind me. </p><p>“Well, I guess I’ll just have to interrupt the conversation.” I sat down on the bench opposite from her and reached my hand out. “Teddy Lupin, at your service.” </p><p>She took my hand and we shook, “Del Fermi, Pleasure to meet you Lupin. You a first year too?”</p><p>“Yeah, a little nervous, too?” </p><p>“Somewhat, this is all knew.” She gestured around that train compatible. </p><p>“Are you muggle born” I froze after I said that, Aunt Hermione would kick my ass right now. “Not that that is a bad thing. I have plenty of muggleborn friends. And… well… I should just shut up right now shouldn’t I?” </p><p>She threw her head back laughing and I could feel the blood rushing towards my cheeks. “Dude, it’s fine. And I’m not Muggle-born. My parents,” She caught herself. “Just never wanted to really be involved in the wizarding world once they graduated.” </p><p>“So they went to Hogwarts.” </p><p>She shook her head. “My mother went to Beauxbatons but moved up to Britain before I was born” I nodded. </p><p>“So your French,  you know what they say about French girls right?” I joke and I got a small wrapped candy thrown at me for it. “I kid, I kid,” I said in a horrible french accident, which only earned me another projectile to the face. </p><p>“You better be.” We both started laughing as I picked up one of the candies and popped it into my mouth. It was cold to the touch and was kind of salty with a sweet aftertaste. </p><p>“Trolly, Trolly. Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties.” The troll witch passed our little huddle home and opened the door enough so she could talk to us.</p><p>“Anything from the trolly dears?” I shrugged at Del.</p><p>“I’m good, Lupin you want anything?” </p><p>“Nothing from the trolly.” The witch knotted, closed the doors, and moved on. “Hey, why do you keep calling me Lupin instead of Teddy.” </p><p>“Um. I don’t know, do you want me to start calling you Teddy instead?”</p><p>I thought about this for a while. “How about we stick with Lupin.” She smiled. “Or Moony!” I blurted out before I really thought about what I was saying. </p><p>“Sure thing Moony, but one day you are going to tell me what that means.” </p><p>“Yeah ok, one day.”</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the ride was spent with sharing of horrible jokes, and the occasional projectile of candy. After we rode over the lake in boats that seemingly propelled themselves. I looked up at the castle were my parents were killed, and then constantly thinking about the hair I was currently making pitch black like the potters. I wondered if I should make it blond, or purple, but then thought against it. I liked having a piece of the potter's with me before I got placed in a house. </p><p>Once inside we made our way to the great hall, once there we were met my Nevill, no, Professor Longbottom. We were met by Professor Longbottom. “Hello everyone.” The man started. “I am Professor Longbottom, head of Gryffindor house and Herbalist Professor. Now trust me when I say I know how scared you all must be, I was terrified and thought I got sorted into the wrong house. But you will do fine and I can’t wait to see all of you in my class tomorrow.” </p><p>There was an odd pause between the students and Longbottom. Most of us knew the legend of the scarf Gryffindor who then killed the final Horax in the Battle of Hogwarts. I myself heard the story from the man in question during the holidays. </p><p>“And don’t worry, if you all behave, there will be no reason for any beheading this year.” He smirked, “Now let's get on with it shouldn’t we.” </p><p>With that, he turned around and opened the large doors leading into the great hall. Once the older students released this, they all quieted down in order to get a look at the new blood. The lot of us quietly walked up to the front of them. Hall was Headmistress McGonagall was waiting with the other professors. </p><p>“Welcome all, Let the Sorting ceremony beguine!” She boomed and her voice was heard in every corner of the room. Longbottom pulled out a scroll wish I was guessing was the list of names for all of the first years. She began listing off. </p><p>Several people had been called when she paused and looked me dead in the eyes. “Edward Remus Lupin.” I looked at Del and she smiled encouraging me to go forward. I walked up the few steps required to get to the stool, upon sitting down the sorting hat was placed on my head. </p><p>“Mmmm…” The hat thought for a second. “Hufflepuff.” I smiled and thought of the canary color associated with the house. When the hat was lifted from my head, the whole room seems to grasp. </p><p>“Real Classy Teddy.” I looked to Longbottom as he was holding the hat. I smiled and ran to the Hufflepuff table were people clapped and welcomed me, and I waited to see what house my new friend would be sorted into. </p><p>After a few more people went up her name was finally called. “Delta Fermi.” She slowly approached the stool and sat down. </p><p>“Well, this is strange. I see you have a… natural fascination with water-based magic…” I held my breath waiting for the house name to be called. “Slytherin!” Only the people belonging to that house clapped, well and of course me. She walked over to the table like she had just taken a defeat. I thought for a second, making my newly yellow hair bleed into light green tips and hollered. </p><p>This got her attention and she looked over laughing as she saw my hair. Then she took her seat at the table next to mine.</p><p>-</p><p>First Years had very limited classes, and we were all in the same classes with each other, so at least I would get to Del today. Everyone in Hufflepuff was nice, but none of them seemed to get my sarcastic humor and need for a little mischievous. And I Hoped my friend in a house that had a little more fun might be able to help me with that. </p><p>Once I got to class I waited for the rest of the class to file in, so far the only people there were Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. There was idle chatter amongst the students and Longbottom had yet to show up as well. After a couple minutes the Slytherin house arrived and took some open seats, most of them clumping into one place. Del spotted me and quickly rushed over to take the empty seat next to mine. </p><p>“So, I see you finally slithered into class. Now we just need to wait for the Gryffindors to arrive, I hear they travel with great pride.” I smiled at my lame jokes and she was obviously trying not to laugh as she shook her head at me disapprovingly. </p><p>“Moony… I feel like I need to bring candy to our next class so I can throw it at you when you are being bloody annoying.” </p><p>“Well.” I blocked her on her nose, “You would only be feeding me.” </p><p>“Shut up.” She said finally giving in and laughing. </p><p>“Sorry, I’m late.” A tired looking Longbottom came in holding a  mug of coffee and quickly placing his notes on his desk and approaching the chalkboard at the front of the door. “What unit are we on?” He asked looking very distraught. </p><p>“Professor Longbottom, we don’t know what subject we are on, and the rest of the class isn’t even here.” A Ravenclaw boy spoke up form the other side of the room. Neville seemed to relax a little bit with this information and walked over to sit at his desk. </p><p>“Oh, well then, talk amongst yourself for the time being.” The whole class watched in confusion as the professor reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a knitting project with only one needle, then continued to use his wand to continue his little project. </p><p>“There is no way that is Neville Longbottom.” The person sitting at the desk assent to ours whispered to us. </p><p>“Actually,” I turned to face her, “He is, I heard the stories from him and my godfather.” A Ravenclaw joined in the conversation. </p><p>“Whos going to ask him.” The whispers fell silent. </p><p>“Professor Longbottom,” Del asked the man in question. </p><p>“Yes, and you are?” </p><p>“Delta,” Longbottom nodded. “Are the stories true, did you really kill the last Horcrux?” She asked shamelessly as the rest of the people in the class stared at her in disbelief. </p><p>The professor looked up from his knitting and looked her dead straight in the eyes. “Voldemort was a punk ass bitch.” That calmly looked continued his knitting. </p><p>“Bloody Hell.” The Hufflepuff girl who started the conversation started. “You really don’t have much to fear when it comes to the teacher here, don’t you. Because I sure as hell wouldn’t just ask one a question like that on the first day of school. Jamie by the way, you?” She looked to Del. </p><p>“Delta. And well… No guts no glory right?” I shook my head. </p><p>“Wow, you sure you're a Slytherin, you don’t sound like a death eater.” One of the watering cans at the front of the room exposed and for a moment the water stayed in the air. </p><p>“I’m not a death eater,” Del said softly, but by the white creeping its way to her knuckles, I doubted that was her current mood. </p><p>The class and Longbottom stared at her for a moment, putting together what I had also gathered, she was the source of the explosion. It stayed this way for a little while until the Gryffindors entered. The mood changed and the class started to like the incident never happened. </p><p> </p><p>After class Del practically ran out of class and I tried to do my best to keep up, but let me tell you this, chasing a pissed off Slytherin in dress shoes, 10/10 not would recommend. “Dude, wait up!” I hollered to her. </p><p>She stopped dead in her tracks and turned back around to look at me, some older students walked by us and stared. “What.” She said softly as I got closer. </p><p>“Ok, I am not going to ask what that was, but I want you to know th-”</p><p>“That you don’t think I am a death eater?” She looked at me. “Trust me, I know I am not a death eater and anyone else's opinion doesn’t really matter, even yours moony.” </p><p> </p><p>    “Ok fine, fair enough. But our next class is that way.” I turned and pointed to down the hallway we had just come from. “And let's face it, and am too much of rebellious, sarcastic, little shit to fit in with the Hufflepuffs in our year and I would like to have a friend there, some of the older Hufflepuffs are cool but I am not that smart to go to there classes.” </p><p>    She shook her head and smiled. “Smooth Lupin, smooth.” She started walking in the hallway to the way we came. </p><p>    “Does that mean we are going to class now,” I yelled at her. </p><p>    “Yes you blubbering idiot, that means we are going to class now.” </p><p>    “Well in that case…” She stopped and looked at me as I cough up to her, digging into the rather large pocket of my robe and pulling out a chocolate bar. “We might want some snacks for the road.”</p><p>    “Man, you really know what a woman wants to hear.”</p><p>    “Don’t I thought?” </p><p>    We stared on to our next class, DADA, as I unwrapped the bar breaking it into two pieces. </p><p>“I like the hair,” She reached up and ruffled it a little bit.</p><p>“Why thank you, an original design.” I gave her a half as she laughed again at my joke.</p>
