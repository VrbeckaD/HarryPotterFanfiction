  <span>The sunrise is powder-purple, the snow on the ground is patching in great holes like the surface of some alien planet, and Sirius Black steps out into Jericho daylight as though he was born here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t, really, but he’s adapted over the space of several small lifetimes—microcosms in and of themselves, tiny compressions of histories taken up and forgotten just as smoothly in the spaces between the years. Sirius shook off the cobwebs of Wyoming like dust in his hair, threw himself into trade after trade before getting sucked up into the clergy as though the rapture came too early and swallowed him down, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Holy, Holy, Holy,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and now he’s here a half-decade back from 40 with his own church in a small town that feels, above all, safe.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Safety. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Not quite something a man of the cloth should have to keep in the back of his mind, but it’s there nonetheless in spite of the anglican comforts that surround him here. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Catholic lite,</span>
  </em>
  <span> one of Sirius’ parishioners has joked more than once, </span>
  <em>
    <span>all the gifts, half the guilt!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s taken twelve long years for Sirius to be comfortable with half-smiles and wholesome prayer beneath the blandness of wake-exist-sleep-repeat, twelve long and attenuated years away from the sulfuric char of what life was before, whatever it was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he allows himself the space, the quiet, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>risk</span>
  </em>
  <span> of trying to remember, it always fills him with a sense of dread. His childhood is a blackened char of a thing there at the base of his skull, gnarled around itself as though burnt on the altar of time—there is always a chant, always the smell of dead leaves, always the tight grip of horror that chokes him with a steady fist. But then Sirius will take a breath and hum a quiet prayer to one saint or another, and the terror will abate until the next press of his past at the threshold beneath his consciousness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius knows there are memories deep down in those swollen clusters of his ganglia, bound together like pyre fuel just waiting to be burnt—hideous memories, things that feel and taste of soot when he wakes from the periodic nightmares that worm their way in around his internal defenses of three persons in one God, holy bulwark stood up in his guts like a shield. He knows they’re there. But it’s been a quiet blessing as time has worn on to find the horrific virility waning in the face of all the life Sirius has constructed for himself in the meantime, no matter how mundane.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he buys this week’s roast at the butchery, Ms. Vance gives him a sweet smile Sirius returns easily. It’s a bland response, milquetoast, the emotional equivalent of over-pouring cream into black coffee without any sugar to offset the flavor. Venison trussed up tight under his arm, heading then to the cobbler to pick up the shoes whose soles Mr. Pettigrew has likely brought back from the dead—it’s a constant joke between them, Peter always joking about resurrection and the homonyms that surround cobbling and priesthood alike, at which Sirius has gotten very good at laughing sensibly—Sirius pauses when the wail of an ambulance carves its cry into the quiet midmorning like a jagged knife.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hail Mary, </span>
  </em>
  <span>the silent toll in practiced habit at the back of his head prays immediately as Sirius turns to watch the speeding madness of sirens race down the main street, </span>
  <em>
    <span>full of Grace, the Lord be with thee...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The bell above the library tolls eight times, mixing cacophonously with the ambulance. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners….</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Careening forward, the siren warps its cry a half-tone lower once it passes Sirius there on the sidewalk and the ambulance turns left and disappears around the pleasant shrug of the New England brick siding risen up all over town in more thorny dissonance—the calm against the hectic. Sirius blinks and sniffs a little sigh to himself, his breath pluming faintly in the cold; </span>
  <em>
    <span>Now, and at the hour of our death.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Amen.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>—</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>New one, </span>
  </em>
  <span>his instincts hiss, small voice at the base of Sirius' brain scratching like inquiry at his mind's door jamb. The man is knelt there on the cushioned bar before the altar as the choir warbles its Eucharist anthem, something-something </span>
  <em>
    <span>I fear not in thee, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and Sirius is sure he's never seen that face in his life right alongside the same surety that somehow he knows this man—or at least some permutation of this man—from those scraps of memories warped by the tug and pull of Sirius' more terrifying dreams. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the man himself isn't terrifying. He's vaguely beautiful in an exhausted sort of way, with a set to his jaw and a subtle furrow at the midpoint of his sandy-brown eyebrows that belies someone running on very little sleep. Perhaps he has dreams as well, just as murky and intangible and confusing? Sirius steps up to him, just in front of the man's clasped hands, and lifts a Eucharist between his thumb and forefinger. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The body of Christ," he murmurs above the organ and the gaggle of altos nearest this end of the altar in the choir stall, much with the same tone he might say </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hello there, stranger.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"Amen," the man rasps, his hands still clasped—his own intonation couched in the realm of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Pleasure to meet you</span>
  </em>
  <span>—before he opens his mouth in waiting supplication. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius presses the wafer to the man's tongue and refuses to be the first to break eye contact, even as the man makes a tidy sign of the cross over his chest and gives an incongruent little twitch of a smile on that delicate straight line of his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The organ carries on as the man stands, folding himself back into the crowd and through to the pews again. Sirius swallows dryly, a vague thrum of beginning starting up inexplicably just beneath his vocal cords. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Amen,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the choir sings as though in reply to the stranger, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Amen, Amen, Amen. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>They meet in earnest in the church basement not half an hour later.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Amid the dry rattle of the radiator pipes, the knock and clatter of it making just as much noise as the milling churchgoers sipping paper-cup coffee as they talk in low voices with one another around the occasional mouthful of corner store sugar cookies, Sirius’ eyes flick along the congregation in a repetitive cycle of searching. His vestments gone and folded back into his office closet so full of moth wards it may as well be witchcraft, Sirius feels vaguely naked in just his sweater and collar and simple Sunday slacks; </span>
  <em>
    <span>Father,</span>
  </em>
  <span> they call him. The title feels out of place when he’s in veritable shirtsleeves without all the pomp and posturing of his robes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Father,” another voice says—two syllables rough like granite, two syllables that ring faintly of a familiar </span>
  <em>
    <span>Amen</span>
  </em>
  <span>—to pull Sirius’ attention up out of his coffee and standing-about. He’s only about as tall as Sirius’ chin, but he has one wide palm extended in waiting greeting. “Pleased to meet you,” he continues, this time aloud instead of the faint ringing at the back of Sirius’ mind; “I’m Remus Lupin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius takes his hand and shakes firmly, only mildly surprised by the warmth there. “The pleasure is mine, Remus, welcome. Are you visiting, or new to town?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A jagged little laugh trips out of Remus’ throat, pointed in its angles of vague surprise. “No, I—well, I grew up here. I just haven’t really been to church. In a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s never a bad time to come back.” Sirius smiles his best smile, blandest smile, the one that crimps a little at the corners of his eyes and almost makes it to the light behind his pupils. Almost. Remus’ own eyes flash a little in reply, the blend of buzzing fluorescent bulbs shuddering in the pale brown of his irises. Sirius watches him evenly as Remus’ mouth twitches slightly, as jittery as that laugh of his. “What do you do in town here, besides find your way back to church?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A spark of good humor passes through Remus’ expression, and Sirius feels a few fibers of himself relax ever so slightly into this dynamic. Good humor is good; anyone who can hold up the epee of joking mildly about service is a valuable parishioner to have. “I’m an EMT, I drive ambulances.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be with thee…</span>
  </em>
  <span>Sirius accidentally lets the smile buckle a little as easement takes him over for a moment. He leans a bit nearer, his voice dropping, his eyes fixing distantly on the far corner of the basement where Molly Weasley’s twin boys duck under one of the folding tables with a king’s ransom of shortbread; “Hopefully,” Sirius murmurs, “I don’t meet any of your passengers for last rites.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Commiseration isn’t something he’s ever wanted for here, more than content to simply thread life through the eye of his heart like a string tied to itself in endless repetition in steady tugs into and out of the meat of each ventricle—but Sirius finds a seed of warmth rooted deep and sudden in his belly when Remus smiles sideways at him again, hands in the pockets of his canvas jacket and the shrug of those half-combed curls swept sideways along his forehead, as though he can read Sirius’ beginning and end right there in the basement like a pair of stone tablets in the foothills.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Let’s hope so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus Lupin leaves after a touch more chatter—glimpses of a childhood in Jericho, brief but dear; flashes of Sirius’ own adventures through seminary school; both of them giving, taking, not quite the same </span>
  <em>
    <span>This is my body</span>
  </em>
  <span> insistence but certainly sharing the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Amen</span>
  </em>
  <span> of budding familiarity—and the basement feels blander than ever once Sirius watches the last curve of his shoulder disappear up the side stairwell. He stares after the empty space for moment, sipping absently on the last mouthful of burnt coffee gone cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning, Father!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius blinks, returns to himself in quick fractals of pieces; the smile returns, entirely absent from the backs of his eyes now, and he twists steadily to face a parishioner whose name he’s probably learned three times and now forgotten twice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shakes hands. The gesture lacks warmth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sunday wears on into its cool compression of time, a slowing-down of the early winter chill as if the wooden gears between the struts of presence could truly groan with the frost leached into their pores. Sirius straps his snowshoes on in his tiny foyer with the door half-open to the spill of the forest just beyond the front stoop. His wraps his scarf once, twice, three times around his neck, reconsiders the squeeze of it at his throat, unspools it back to twice and tucks the ends into his lapels. The old ear flap cap shrinks the borders of Sirius’ world into the muffled nearness of only the squeeze of snow beneath his feet and the rustle of naked branches as he shuts the door solidly behind him, and the wood lets him in like an old friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Crawling low on the horizon, the sun casts pale gold across the standing leagues of bare trees in angular, spiny throws of shadows. Sirius’ breath steams forth from the engine of his lungs—all of him churning while he walks, all of him pinked and obstinate-hot in the face of wintertime—and his mind spins, that maddened bobbin reeling over and again through his memories like a half-charred rolodex.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He remembers taking similar walks through the woods with his father, the murky depths of Wyoming woods just a short drive away from their home in Ten Sleep—the drone of the car radio broadcasting haunting tunes in a strange language, his father’s chain of cigarettes always held in one hand propped on the open window no matter the weather, the hard plastic feeling of the truck seats beneath Sirius’ legs in the passenger’s seat, all of it vague like the tattered edges of faded motel curtains—and stops in a small clearing to breathe and think.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s easiest to try and pull at the threads of these memories in the forest. The canopy shyness above, especially in the wintertime, at least makes it feel as though there are holes poked in the lid of the great glass jar holding him all together.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Someday you’ll lead a Hunt, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Orion’s voice tolls in the annals of Sirius’ childhood as though carried through the frequency of the trees whispering against one another. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’ll teach you all I know, and you’ll lead the whole of the Forum to Arcadia.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How will I know where to find it?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius shuts his eyes, his lashes fluttering slightly against his cheeks, as the memory of him asking and looking up at his father’s carven frown meshes suddenly with the unbidden sight of the new stranger at church, Remus Lupin, half-smiling and half-explained and wholly unexpected.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You’ll know,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the gravelly ferocity of his father’s conviction resonates in unexpected harmony with the imagined rasp of Remus’ voice shaping around the very same words; </span>
  <em>
    <span>they’ll show you the way.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius so rarely misses his father anymore, but at times he’s reminded of the rare glimpses of the man he might have been in his youth when memory flashes up at him like the white belly of a fish beneath a frozen pond. He was a man saddled with expectation and greatness by nothing but the placement of the stars and an early labor that nearly claimed his wife. Orion grew into his role as teacher as a tree fits into a pot just barely too small for its roots; he did not wear the raiment of divine guide easily at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How lucky he is, Sirius supposes once he opens his eyes again—snow is seeping lightly into the weave of his jeans, when did he fall to his knees? When did he close his gloved hands around the snow, squeezing it tightly, for how long has he been on the ground?—that he has the Lord on his side now instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>In him there is no darkness at all,</span>
  </em>
  <span> a thread of a tune assuages Sirius as he staggers up into a stand and stamps his snowshoes a few times to wake some life back into his toes, </span>
  <em>
    <span>the night and the day are both alike; The Lamb is the light of the city of God…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>How truly, truly lucky he is.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Songbird trill smashing through his concentration shatters the evening quiet. The phone rings sharply. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius removes his reading glasses carefully and folds them slim to hold his place in the middle of the book of Jonah—</span>
  <em>
    <span>That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love</span>
  </em>
  <span>—before he rubs at the bridge of his nose with one hand while the other reaches for the old pearl-white telephone affixed to the wall beside his desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I—Father, hi there. It’s Remus. I’m sorry for calling a little late, but I found your information in the Saint Edmund’s directory and—”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Unexplained apprehension lights up in Sirius’ guts, as though he has anything to realistically be worried about. He leans forward onto the desk, his chair creaking faintly, and furrows his eyebrows. “Is everything alright?” comes out in a hurry, when what he really means to say is </span>
  <em>
    <span>Not a problem at all.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>A little pause on the other end of the phone hisses with the faint noise of the line. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Yes,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Remus says after a moment with what might be a hint of a smile evidenced there in the syllable, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Yeah, I think everything is fine.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You</span>
  <em>
    <span> think?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I—well.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Remus sighs, a cloudy sound through the tinny compaction of his voice in the earpiece, and Sirius frowns at the open flat of his study bible looking up at him; </span>
  <em>
    <span>But the Lord replied; Is it right for you to be angry?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius waits a few beats for Remus to reply and cuts in when all that meets him again is the vague wash of the phone line and a faint rustling from Remus’ end of the call. “I’m happy to help if something is wrong, Remus, in any way I can.” There’s a tremor in his heart at that, a fidgety reaction to the lie—not entirely a lie for of course he can help in the manner of giving counsel, but if Remus is hurt or legitimately in need of something besides holy platitudes Sirius is largely useless from across town with nothing but a handset leftover from 1966 to connect the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A brittle crinkling of movement on Remus’ end underscores another light sniff of self consciousness.</span>
  <em>
    <span> “Nothing is wrong, promise. I...just wanted to let you know I’m grateful, for your guidance.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Guidance. Sirius holds in his own little sniff at that, as if the eucharists and crumbs of conversation he’s held with Remus for the past couple of Sundays are anything close to </span>
  <em>
    <span>real </span>
  </em>
  <span>guidance; deep discussions of life, both the present and the everlasting sort, and tumultuous conversations in the quiet of his little broom closet of an office is how Sirius has always viewed the surrounding of those two syllables. Looking down at the dragonfly-wing pages of his bible, worrying their edges blithely with the tip of his thumb, Sirius nods slowly to himself. </span>
  <em>
    <span>If only,</span>
  </em>
  <span> a small piece of him thinks vaguely into the cotton-dark of his mind, </span>
  <em>
    <span>it was so simple for everyone.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “I’m happy to help,” Sirius says instead. Quiet, again for several short moments, with nothing but Remus’ faint breathing and the tick of Sirius’ kitchen clock over his shoulder on the opposite end of the house overtakes them. Sirius shifts in his seat, leaning back steadily with one arm crossed in an unconscious guard over his chest; “Are you sure that’s all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oh, I—no. Thank you. I just suppose I’ve been having trouble sleeping lately, and I figured I might as well see if you were up also.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius tips his wrist sideways to glance at his watch, near enough to midnight that it matters. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“It helps to talk to someone else, to get me to sleep more easily.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“So I guess I </span>
  <em>
    <span>can</span>
  </em>
  <span> help then, can’t I?” He smiles despite himself and, against his better judgement, Sirius feels the spaces between his ribs swell a bit with lightness as he hears Remus’ own smile creep into another delicate fuzzing of air with a light chuckle.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yeah. I guess you can.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tucking his wrist back into his elbow, putting away time for just a moment, Sirius relaxes into a suspended handful of minutes free from the trappings of expectation and talks about nothing with Remus Lupin. The only shocking thing about it is how natural it feels, how absolutely fitting it seems to shelve the present and live in the spaces of another man’s voice for just a little while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s given up, of course, on being surprised that it’s a man. The only surprising thing is that it’s a man Sirius has only met in the confines of his church. But, he finds upon one more glance at his watch to see that nearly twenty minutes have passed in what seems like the blink of an eye, Sirius supposes there might be a certain type of confessional divinity here in the delicate privacy of a phone call. After all, he’s familiar on more than one level with more than one type of holiness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Sirius breaks into a pause then, one of many pauses between them all made of strange comfort and new boundaries like a foal learning its legs, yawning with a faint cracking in his jaw—Lord, he’s gotten tired without realizing it, that old and faint pain in his side bothering him now that exhaustion is rearing up in full—“it’s later than I’d anticipated so I’m afraid I’ve got to get going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Christ, it’s past midnight isn’t it?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Something about the way Remus doesn’t even flinch at mild blasphemy across from a priest does unexpected things to Sirius’ guts. He ignores it and wipes a hand down his face after nodding at the position of the hour hand on his watch. “Nearing one even. Should I expect to see you next Sunday then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yes, definitely. Sorry again for keeping you up, I completely lost track of time.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> There’s an unsaid compulsion between them then that Sirius is sure Remus must feel as well, a pull to say </span>
  <em>
    <span>But I liked it.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius swallows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a problem at all.” So he’s doing it like this then, pulling it out like a thread being coaxed from carded wool as though it isn’t dangerous to play with his compulsions this way. There’s a soft shifting again from Remus’ end and a short huff of breath, delicate breath, almost as though it were breaking softly along his tongue. Sirius puts away thoughts of Remus’ tongue and blinks quickly at his desktop, staring past the text staring up at him from that left-alone page of Jonah as though it will help him quit this slow dive like a whale swallowing him whole; </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He wanted to die, and said, ‘It would be better for me to die than to live.’</span>
  </em>
  <em></em>
    <span></span><br/>
<em>
    <span>But God said to Jonah, ‘Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?’</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span><br/>
</span>
  </em>
  <em></em>
  <span>‘It is,’ he said. ‘And I’m so angry I wish I were dead.’</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Thank you again, Father.” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Remus’ soft voice pulls Sirius out of his own head with its earnestness, a gentle texture woven from honesty and gratitude Sirius is almost surprised to hear there. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Truly. I appreciate it. It might sound silly, but I feel...very drawn to you.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius nearly swallows his tongue then, but he settles for tossing out a wry laugh that carries none of his true pleasure at hearing Remus murmur something like that through the intimacy of a phone call. He leans forward again, propped up once more on his elbows, and presses his free hand flat over one eye as though it might shut out the rising interest beginning to pool in his heart. “Thank you, Remus, but—you don’t know me, really.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don’t I?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s a bolt from the blue, a staggering supposition that should discomfort Sirius or even infuriate him—</span>
  <em>
    <span>And I’m so angry I wish I were dead—</span>
  </em>
  <span>but it strikes him instead right at the core of his heart, for who else in his life made of all its poorly-fitted parts and shadowy gaps of forgotten memories has ever presumed before to know him, really? Sirius lets out a slow breath through his nose, his hand still pressed evenly over his eye until he removes it slowly, sunspots seeming to spangle behind his pupils for a moment while he runs the tips of his fingers along the pages of his bible again. Remus stays a soft sort of silent on the other end of the phone. “You might,” Sirius finally murmurs against his own will, “you might very well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There isn’t any smugness but simply the hint of a comfortable half-smile when Remus seems to nod in agreement; </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Sleep well, Father.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight.” Set vaguely alight by the use of his title now, now after they’ve traded this enigmatic somethingness billowed up along the phone line like a thundercloud down from nowhere, Sirius doesn’t trust himself not to wrap Remus’ name in something too-sweet as it trips off his tongue. In spite of his bones screaming for him to stay on the line, Sirius hangs up before he can say anything else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stands abruptly, his feet pacing into the kitchen to bring him to his shallow liquor cabinet. The cap of the half-empty rye scrapes emptily as he twists it off and pours a thin glass of it, neat, down in one toss with another pour quick on its heels. Sirius takes this one to the armchair in his living room, sits in the dark, and stares blankly at the wall across from him with tense knuckles whitening in a fist he clenches unconsciously on his knee.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t I?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius shuts his eyes around a deep sip that he lets ruminate on his tongue for several seconds. It burns at the insides of his cheeks pleasantly, stinging with the faint persistence not unlike the searing reach of grasping at the scraps of his past when he spirals into these more contemplative moments and craves to know himself, know his past, piece together all those disjointed images and sounds and smells patched along the inside of his skull like a disparate fresco thrown against the wet bone by a maddened artist—he grinds his back teeth together very, very slowly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the rest of the night, his thoughts wind themselves in glittering hazel shades around abstract thoughts of bright, wide eyes and a looming sense of something mildly horrifying. Whether the fear comes from the learned resistance to his own proclivities or a general ingrained sense of righteous fury, Sirius doesn’t care to parse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He falls asleep just over an hour later, the shards of unknowing rounded off messily and unsure of his compulsions not for the first time.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The following Sunday alights with mild surprise and what feels like a cloudbreak ushering in all manner of glory; there like a stray, thrown in golden relief against the pure white of the marble foresteps, Remus waits for him at the locked entrance to St. Edmund’s without so much as a breath in Sirius' direction all week long. It shouldn’t feel like arrival. It </span>
  <em>
    <span>doesn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> feel like arrival, and yet Sirius finds himself quelling a rise behind his breastbone as he makes his way down the line of skinny aspens that hem the walkway to the church.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Remus.” He calls it out from a dozen yards back before he can see detail on that carven, sharp-eyed face—before he can track the exhaustion there, the circles like bruises beneath that shuttered gaze, the restlessness at the corners of Remus’ lips and the overall slump in his body as though carrying the misshapen heft of a universe on those shoulders is bending him in half. Sirius stops short, stilled on the walkway as Remus stares at him from the top stair. “Feeling alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus shakes his head as Sirius feels his insides flex sharply. “No, not particularly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sketching up the steps and leaning onto the doorway to easily unlock it, heaving it open with one shoulder and a quick glance back at Remus’ disrepair, Sirius nods to the far side of the narthex that winds back around to this office. “Come in, I’ll make coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There isn’t any protestation that follows, so Sirius does his best to quiet the soft buzz beginning to build at the base of his brain. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Calm,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he tries to tell himself, his shoes ringing dully on the wood floor as the nave thrums beyond the hallway wall to the right with the choir rehearsing today’s psalm—</span>
  <em>
    <span>For in death no one remembers you; and who will give you thanks in the grave? I grow weary because of my groaning; every night I drench my bed and flood my couch with tears...</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Calm, calm, calm.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It works just enough to keep him from glancing more than once over his shoulder to make sure Remus is still following him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here, have a seat,” Sirius finds himself murmuring as he shuts the door tightly behind him and clears a stack of missals from the only chair across from his desk, overladen with books and ledgers of all sorts. The low ceiling amplifies the quiet here, twinned by the pale light cutting across the floor through the letterbox window high above the file cabinets behind the desk, and Remus moves just as quietly into the seat where he shrinks into the dark wool of his coat. He shuts his eyes. Sirius doesn’t realize he’s begun holding his breath then until Remus opens them back up again after a moment with a twitching blink, as though refocusing a lens.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Coffee would be great, thank you,” he croaks. Sirius stammers to action with a quick nod, over to the electric kettle and pouches of instant coffee stacked beside his vestments wardrobe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cream or sugar?” He asks it to fill the air, realizing too late he’s only ever kept sugar in his office for the absence of an icebox.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just black. Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My pleasure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s tension here, leagues of it, but Sirius fixates on the coffee and the vague pulse of the organ bleeding through its bones built into the belly of the building and almost forgets to feel it. Remus is silent as the kettle clicks to a boil, as Sirius tears open and mixes the sachets of coffee, juggles over the mugs in both hands with a cobbled warning to be careful for the temperature; Remus nods his thanks, still staring blank at the floorboards, and sips easily without blowing on it first. Sirius goes for his own sip and scalds the tip of his tongue on the first try.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry for showing up out of nowhere.” Remus wraps both hands around his mug, his voice sounding as though it’s been raked over coals. Sirius is familiar with the stresses of exhaustion from his days in seminary preparing for examinations and all sorts of fly-by-night acolyting, so he tries his best to ignore the evident pain of it. Shrugging, Sirius rounds his desk and lowers into a sit in the high-backed chair twice-patched over where his legs meet its edge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I got uppity about someone finding refuge on the steps of my church I’d be a sorry sort of priest, wouldn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blessedly, the twitch of a smile lights onto Remus’ lips at that. Sirius tries to pretend he doesn’t watch them for far longer than a half-second. “Still. I know it’s early. And I appreciate the coffee, thank you.” He gestures with the mug and it’s only then that Sirius looks up away from his mouth. Sirius smiles that automatic bland smile before he catches himself and replaces it with something more honest, the due Remus deserves from the freshly-torn membrane of their phone call the other night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Truly, it’s my pleasure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s quiet again, but none of the security of a telecom line to guard either of them now. Sirius clears his throat a little before raising his cup to his mouth to blow cool air over the coffee for a few seconds. “So, would you like to tell me what you’re dealing with, or…?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus blinks again and seems to re-remember why he was pulled into Sirius’ office in the first place. He shrinks a bit back into his seat, the edge of his lower lip sucking between his teeth in what looks like a worried habit, while Sirius bites down on the compulsion to reach across the desk and smooth the chaotic tumble of short curls back from his forehead. “I’m still having trouble,” he finally mumbles. “Sleeping, I mean. It comes and goes, but mostly I’m just lying awake and...I don’t know, forgetting what’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>real.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius raises his eyebrows. “Are you sleepwalking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A bitter sound scrapes out of Remus at that, somewhere between a laugh and a cough. “I wish. Or, fuck, I might be, who knows anymore.” He rubs the heel of one hand into one eye, a rough gesture that musses the hair skimming his eyebrows, as though he might push the exhaustion in him out through the socket and leave it writhing there on the floor. Remus shakes his head. “Sorry. I’m so tired.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no, not a problem,” Sirius hums. Inwardly he scrapes about for something to say, something comforting or vaguely sympathetic, but Remus sighs again and tips one foot back and forth as if in careful thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s as if,” he says softly after just a few more breaths, “I’m losing time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius frowns a little as he takes a sip of coffee. “How’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another bitter grin plucks at the seams of Remus’ expression, and he meets Sirius’ eyes for the first time since entering the church—there’s a faint and untamed wildness to the golden-brown light fettered within that stare beneath the crust of enervation, and something inside Sirius recoils fully at the touch of it even as he feels irrevocably drawn toward its resonance. “You’re going to think I’m fucking crazy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Giving his best flat stare, the look he perfected in seminary through all his practice with the solemnity of preparing communion, Sirius leans forward. “I promise you,” he says gently, in the same fashion he whispers his </span>
  <em>
    <span>Glory Be’</span>
  </em>
  <span>s in the privacy of his kitchen over lonely dinners or the way one of his old memories tells him his mother used to teach him different prayers—angular prayers, prayers that tasted of iron on his tongue, prayers he could sing or chant so differently from the ones he knows now—”whatever you think ‘crazy’ is, you’re not it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus gives another twitch of that honest smile. Something in Sirius’ veins opens up as though reaching for oxygen. “I dunno, Father, this is...pretty wild.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wild,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius wants to scoff, the dregs of Ten Sleep and shapeless rituals he only remembers in blurred outlines flashing briefly through his mind’s eye, </span>
  <em>
    <span>you don’t know the half of wild.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Try me,” he settles on saying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Narrowing his eyes shortly around a wide gulp of his coffee, Remus seems to make up his mind. “Alright then. I don’t know if it’s my shot-to-hell sleep cycle, or stress from work, or whatever other mental fucking ruin I might be bringing home with me from the hospital, but I black out most nights lately. Completely gone, like—some kind of seizure or something, but I know that’s not what they are, and when I wake up I don’t know how I got to where I am then. Could be minutes apart, could be hours, the worst yet was an entire day, just </span>
  <em>
    <span>gone</span>
  </em>
  <span>. But it’s not like I’m passing out, because it feels like I pulled an all-nighter every time I come back to myself, and—and I still clock into and out of work, and then I can’t even fall asleep the next night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius watches him carefully, watches the way Remus seems to internally rage at himself as though his body is revolting against him. Clarity hits Sirius with sympathy’s sudden, sharp slap when he realizes then that Remus likely started coming to church in an effort to beg God for some kind of peace to stop whatever this is. The desperate parishioners, the ones with nothing left to lose, have always clutched at Sirius' heart hardest. He softens a little, leaning back in his chair as he watches Remus patiently. “There’s more to it though, isn’t there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sharp curve of Remus’ cheek dips inward slightly as he clearly chews on it absently with his back teeth. “Yeah,” he hisses, staring down into his coffee as though he might hide in it, the tatters of that smile gone to an abashed scowl. “It sounds like a total crock, but it...gets worse the more time I spend outside. Anywhere that isn’t home, really, especially the woods.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Heart rate ticking up a jog, Sirius tries not to tighten his fist around the handle of his mug too tightly as Remus continues; “Not worse in the sense that the episodes last longer, but worse in that I...remember them, I suppose. But they don’t feel like my memories.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't they?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus' eyes flick up to meet Sirius', not challenging but meeting on common conversational ground as though double-checking that Sirius really isn't judging him. Seemingly assuaged, he shakes his head. "They feel worn. Used, like I'm chewing on someone else's leftovers."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius stands up, pushing his nearly-full mug to the corner of his desk, and runs one hand through his hair as casually as possible even as his heart continues its quick and uneven run behind his ribs. It's a near-perfect description of what Sirius felt as a boy, those gaps of time left blank between his waking moments in Orion's truck going to and from the hunting lodge—the in-between of it blank as chalk—with nothing but a dull throbbing in his head and a switching of the side of the road on which they drove to mark passage. He doesn't dare mention the recognition. "What sort of memories, are you—I mean, are you sure you aren't dreaming?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If these are dreams," Remus says around a derisive snort, the coffee kicking in a little to wake him into a straighter sit, "get me to a fucking psych, because they're </span>
  <em>
    <span>dark."</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The vestments closet seems like an ideal place to distract himself as Sirius glances at the clock and sees thirty minutes until the start of service looking back at him—earlier than he would usually dress, but his hands might start shaking soon if he doesn't busy them somehow. He pulls open the old mahogany doors with a creak and watches Remus' profile through the slim mirror fixed to the inside of the door on his left; "Describe one to me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A long sigh leaves Remus and he stares at the floor as Sirius takes his cassock up from its hanger to smoothes it from top to bottom as always. "It starts in the woods, not here but somewhere with a whole stand of pines. It smells like fire, like someone has been cooking but it's all been burnt. I'm watching from the edge of this...clearing, I guess it is, and there's a—a body there in the center, with footprints and ashes and all sorts of debris scattered around it."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Is it alive?" Sirius pulls his hair through his collar before settling the alb over his shoulders, watching Remus sharply but knowing the answer with a widening pit burrowing steadily into his guts—</span>
  <em>
    <span>It may not have been alive at the outset, but it certainly wakes up.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius has dreamt over and over again of being that body in the Wyoming snow, his mind scrambling to piece together his missing edges. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus nods through another sip coffee as Sirius bites his teeth together and slips his chasuble on as though he might hide from what follows that nod therein. "Yeah, it—he opens his eyes, and he starts crying and begging someone for help, and then I notice he's bleeding badly from a laceration in his side."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Absently, still staring at the woodgrain at his feet, Remus traces a line along his left-side ribs overtop of his coat. Sirius holds in a shudder and reaches for the stole. He beats back the rearing shapes of his own dreams, ink-foam waves that paint his own occasions of restless sleep in shades of crimson and pain and the same desperate cries to plead with gods long gone silent, and focuses on the way the sunlight is reflecting presently across the buttery brown of Remus' disheveled hair. He gently asks, watching the cut of Remus' profile reflection, "Do you help him?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A shocking tremor of despair ripples across Remus' face for a moment. "I try," he admits, his voice cracking. Sirius' breath catches as it sounds like Remus might be suddenly clutched by tears; "I come forward and I—I do everything I can think of, I pull away his shirt, I apply pressure, it—I try to pack the wound, but it doesn't help." Silence falls for several long seconds. Even the organ in the nave is quiet. Remus looks over to the wardrobe and shanks his gaze dead-sharp into Sirius' own with something that feels like desperation as Sirius finishes adjusting his stole. "He dies with fear in his eyes."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius forces himself into stillness as Remus holds his stare. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Libera me ad Arcadiae,</span>
  </em>
  <span> a voice deep in his inner eaves pleads, rising through his viscera as it does whenever Sirius finds himself on his back in that same dream pleading with the faceless figure begging him back to life in that doomed cycle. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Consumptura est enim corpus meum de partu voluntatem tuam.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well." He shuts the closet steadily and the ghost of that chant in him stops abruptly. Sirius moves back to the far side of his desk, fully dressed in his vestments and feeling more secure with a few more layers of matter between his heart and Remus'. There isn't any evidence of Remus sensing foul the way Sirius has scrambled to cover the angles of whatever this is—happenstance, coincidence, some twisted fate throwing two broken souls together in Jericho's stillness—but Sirius isn't going to take any more chances than he already has. "You work a stressful job. Do you...tend to have these dreams after losing patients?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus watches him evenly for several beats before he looks away, back into his coffee cup to rub at the inner corners of his eyes. "I don't know. Like I said, it doesn't feel like something from my brain. My day-to-day hardly affects it, it seems to come out of nowhere. I—I just don't know, Father, I told you it's crazy."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"But do you not feel desperation of some sort when you lose a patient?"</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Remus' gaze flashes before it hardens with a steely cut up at Sirius across a stack of thick, fraying hymnals. "Death is a fact of life, you of all people should know that with all your promises of what comes after. I've made myself comfortable with loss."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius raises his palms in cool surrender, his lungs gripping slightly. The hem of his vestments folds softly along the creases of his wrists. "I apologize, Remus, I didn't mean to presume anything. I'm only trying to help. I'm...awful at anything that isn't prayer, really. I'm sorry."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He must present a real spit of the faded painting of Christ hung on the far wall, hands up in offering and begging forgiveness as he goes, for Remus watches him through another handful of seconds before his eyes soften back down to a weary loam-brown. "It—it's okay. You're just trying to help, and I don't think I've slept in three goddamn days. Thank you, really, even just for listening."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The organ starts up beyond the walls again, the tinny highs of an opening improvisation to signal the congregation begging to trickle in, and Sirius smiles softly. "I'm here to serve."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus' jaw flexes as he clenches it before tossing down another quaff of coffee. "I don't suppose," he grits out, "it would be very polite of me to fall asleep during Mass?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I think I can convince Him to look the other way just once." Sirius nods at that portrait of Jesus to point Remus' attention to it, and the surprised little cough of a chuckle it brings out of him is perhaps more blessed than the delicate strain of </span>
  <em>
    <span>O Sacrament</span>
  </em>
  <span> beginning to thread itself together in the organ's meandering whistle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once service begins, Remus ends up seating himself in the back of the church and drifts off in the middle of the first reading. Sirius watches him almost entirely throughout the gospel, his face placid and beautiful to be so free of the heaviness plaguing him back in Sirius' office, and Remus awakes with a steady return to his body only when Sirius is preparing the gifts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"This is my body," Sirius exclaims with the Host aloft between his fingers, his voice echoing through the nave as he meets Remus' sleepy stare as though drawn to it like divinity itself, "which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The altar server rings the cluster of bells at her knee, the transubstantiation moves through the church in a wave—unseen, unfelt, extant only in the mutable strength of belief—and Sirius feels one of the last struts left around his heart buckle and slough off into the boiling sea at the pit of his stomach put to heat by the brilliance of Remus' fell presence. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Terror. Cold and steel-sharp, there is terror in this place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It feels like his father's old hunting cabin, the one-room storehouse in the middle of the woods hung thick with pelts and antlers and all manner of bone wards—there, the figure above the interior lintel twisted together with shrike skulls and gut string stares down as though passing judgement. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ash and blood,</span>
  </em>
  <span> it seems to jeer, </span>
  <em>
    <span>ash and blood and spit and spoor, wind it together to dash on the shore. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"Take the staff, Sirius."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looks to his left and sees it there in the corner, the elk femur carved thick with runes and dressed with the feathers and teeth and furs from every Hunt in years past. Orion is watching him, he can feel those eyes on him through the hollow sockets of the bear skull fit over his face, and Sirius can't disobey—he is at once a terrified child and a furious man, helpless to resist the pull of his heritage but utterly horrified of what will follow as he takes up the staff to begin the pilgrimage toward the Last Rites. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sanguinem Arcadiae</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the chants mount to a churn in the clog of his inner ear as though the rest of the Forum is here stuffed into the cabin like taxiderming bunting, bone and wood clattering with dissonant resonance beyond the thick timber walls, </span>
  <em>
    <span>sanguis enim venari. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius knows this spells his death. He will bleed for the Forum, he will host the root of the Forum, secret it in his body as he grows, and when the time comes he will spill open for the Forum somewhere far away from this place—their power will rise from within him, claw itself out, born from the cradle of Sirius' blood it will tear itself out of his body and swallow the world to herd the electi into the Halls of Arcadia. He was born for this, he tells himself as his hand trembles, reaching out to take hold of the staff and feel the smooth flat of bone beneath his fingers—born under the right stars, the right circumstances, pulled out into the world bloody and shrieking and doomed for servitude from his very first breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Sanguinem Arcadiae, sanguis enim venari. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sirius," Orion bids him as he comes closer, closes his own hand around Sirius’ to cover it fiercely, squeeze his fingers tightly around the staff; Sirius looks over at him, seeing him at once as the bitter man he knew and the old man Orion would never live to be here in this suspended, strange warp of space. "Take it," he hisses, "begin the end."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A building chorus of howls rips into the wind beyond the walls, the forest crying and railing against the horror it can no doubt sense in its pulse—the creatures stay away from the Forum, the profanity and misuse of their bodies like grotesque photo-negatives of the grace given them once by the natives long culled from this place by Sirius' ancestors. He tries to pull his hand back, his strength failing him, stopped short by the bone-crushing grip of Orion's hand on his with those knuckles dusted by dark hair and scored with calluses and scars born from Hunt after Hunt after awful, reeking Hunt. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Do it,"</span>
  </em>
  <span> Orion snarls, just as the door collapses inward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s as though a surging wave of fur and teeth has come to life, and Sirius fears at first that the vestiges of the Forum’s ruin has risen up as some great spirit to take them all away until he recognizes it as a pack of wolves. His father hardly has time to turn and see it descend on him before he’s engulfed, torn apart like dry, bleeding bark between the vise of open jaws—his mask clatters to the floor and shatters apart, a hole in the packed dirt opening up beneath it like Hell itself, and Sirius can only gasp around a fetid lungful of air that tastes of death before the entire cabin begins warping to ruin and he hurtles down as well into the earth’s maw. He lets go of the staff, ripped away by the wolves and their maddened voracity, and tumbles backward for what feels like forever until his back hits the frigid wet of powder snow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gasping for air, the wind knocked from him in a rush, Sirius stares at the stars jeering down at him and tries to reach up as though he could claw back the moment in the cabin. But it’s gone and he knows it in his marrow; plagued sorrow fills him, the empty holes in his memories scrambling to fill themselves with something as they scrape for the truth—is he a failure, is he a monster, is he a savoir? His eyes fill up with tears and Sirius chokes on a sob, clutching desperately at the empty air with weak fingers stretched up on trembling arms. He cries ugly, heaving cries, wailing up to the sky with the profundity of loss ebbing up around the concentrated, icepicking pain in his left side as the night sky whirls and wheels above him. He does the only thing he can think to do and sings a prayer with broken, pleading need. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Come back,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he wants to scream, </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t let me go on alone! Don’t leave me here, I can’t do this!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s a calming voice that echoes up and finds him there from the back of his mind, a shorn growl of a sound, familiar and foreign at once. It stills him in a heartbeat with a sharp catch in his throat that jags through his lungs in a start. “Here,” it repeats, drawing Sirius up into a slow sit, “here, here, here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius staggers up onto his feet, his side still spangling pain but abating just slightly when he presses a flat palm to it. The wet squelch of blood meets him there but he fights past it to stare instead into the dark yawn of the wood, the edge of the clearing giving way to a pathway he only knows to follow like some sort of bold, untended instinct. Tear tracks start to dry clammy on his cheeks. A breeze rips past with a low moan through the pines. Sirius staggers onward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His footsteps are heavy and uneven, snow skipping up around his bootsoles like gunfire peppering his feet as he clutches his side and staggers onward. Sirius lets the voice take over his mind, feral voice, Remus’ voice, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> who it is—Remus Lupin, beckoning him away from catastrophe in this strange morph of reality with that warm stroke of a syllable, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Here, here, here.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius lets it lead him and surrenders to guidance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The forest opens up after leagues and leagues of walking to a second clearing, a repeat of the one into which Sirius had fallen with the same footprints and blood spatter left at the spot where he had landed somehow doubled here. No matter. Sitting at the center of it is a massive grey wolf, one who might be king of the pack that ruined the cabin and destroyed that strange effigy of Orion, with a severed head nestled between its paws.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here,” the wolf murmurs again, the sound of it echoing loud as a cathedral bell through the creaking trees, and Sirius falls to his knees and realizes the head is his own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Black hair pooling like spilled ink, skin pallid with death, mouth slack and eyes shut, it’s Sirius. He tries to say </span>
  <em>
    <span>Help me</span>
  </em>
  <span> but can’t make words; he tries to indicate his side, his wound, the pain nestled therein as though something sharp and smoldering has been wedged between his organs, but blood pours out from between his fingers when he tries to move his hand and the only sound Sirius can make is a whimpering sob.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here,” the wolf intones, showing his teeth and letting those human-brown eyes of his—warrior's eyes, eyes that have seen too much of the world, Remus' eyes—flash with conviction as he stares deep into Sirius’ own, “here, </span>
  <em>
    <span>here.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The head in his paws snaps its eyes open. They are not grey but the ice-blue reflection of Orion’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“HERE.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ chest nearly carves itself in half with the force of the gasp that rockets him into waking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sheets are soaked with sweat, his shirt collar sticking flush to his skin and his hair tendriled against his neck, and it takes more than a handful of seconds for him to hold fast to lucidity as he sits up. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Jericho,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he thinks wildly to himself as he sucks on full-bellied heaves of air, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Jericho, Vermont. Ten Sleep is ashes to you now. You sat with Remus Lupin not five days ago and had coffee with him, he isn’t a wolf. The Forum is a shambles. You owe nothing to them anymore, nothing at all.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Dry sobs work their way to the fore of his face despite the white noise of his thoughts, and Sirius lets them move through him like undertow. He pants around the still of the night, instinctively clutching his left side, weeping tearless passion in the sharp path carved by a spear of moonlight until his heartbeat quiets down from a sprint and he’s sure enough of his sanity that he can move into a slow stand and make his way out of the bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Water from the kitchen tap, cool and blank as the winter outside, helps calm him. Sirius drinks down two tall glasses, traces of it trickling down the corners of his lips with the voracity of the third—sucking it down like air, like lifeblood, as though he’ll choke without it instead of on it—and he only notices the red pinhole eye of the answering machine blinking slowly in the dark across the sitting room on his desk when he wipes the last of the wet from his chin.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Strange.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He hadn’t heard the phone ring, but then again that nightmare had been thick enough that the trumpets of the Seraphs themselves wouldn’t have woken him. Sirius sets the empty glass in the sink as he rubs sleep from his eyes, and he trudges to the desk and leans heavily on it with his forearms. He thumbs the worn rewind button, burying his face in his hands briefly with the cobwebs of horrific sleep still spidering along the backs of his eyes—he looks up with a drained bolt of surprise when the tape clicks to playback and ushers Remus’ voice into the quiet dark.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Evening, Father.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a strange shade of sleepiness framing that voice, a clouded sort of un-presence that Sirius can only guess is that loss of time he had mentioned last Sunday. Sirius frowns and slowly settles himself into his desk chair as a moment of quiet, muted shuffling threads out from the answering machine.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Apologies for the hour,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Remus continues, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I know you’re probably sleeping or...I dunno, holding some sort of vigil at the church, but I didn’t expect you to answer. I just need—I guess I just want to feel like someone might hear me right now. And you picked up last time. So here I am.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus’ voice is slow, even, pillowed in a half-whisper as though he’s afraid to wake himself; certainly not inebriated but a little bit slurred on the near-break of his voice. Sirius shifts in his seat and leans back, still frowning slightly at the machine as something enigmatic presses with soft intent at the space between his lungs.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“We lost a patient tonight. Cardiac. Had to get clear across town, almost into the other county, and I was too late.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sympathy grips Sirius sharply at the same time Remus’ words catch just a little—not with the wet descent of sorrow, but the dry parch of guilt. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I know by now that half those calls are going to result in a loss. I know it, I </span>
  </em>
  <span>know </span>
  <em>
    <span>it. It’s nothing new, but...I dunno, Father, I try not to blame myself. But I lied to you last Sunday.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> A bitter curve of irony twists into Remus’ voice, a breath of a laugh that knits seamlessly into some sort of choke of a gasp or groan, and Sirius crosses his arms tightly across his chest as he tries to fathom out the emotional maelstrom likely wreaking havoc in Remus’ heart with the chaos of trying to save lives. Remus’ breath puffs in a crackle against the receiver before he swallows thickly. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I lied about the death thing. I really do have trouble parsing it, living with it, accepting it. I feel like I’m losing part of myself whenever someone dies on my watch.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus pauses again with something like a groan, and Sirius taps into his apostolistic strength when something about the way it hits the air makes his guts tug sweetly and his cock twitch in his threadbare boxer shorts—</span>
  <em>
    <span>Stop it,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he admonishes himself, crossing his legs and clenching one fist in front of his mouth, staring intently at the answering machine as though ignoring the sudden heat between his legs will make it go away. He redoubles his attention on the message, focusing closely on the white noise of the tape instead of these angles of guilty passion in Remus’ voice that do sinful, staggering things to Sirius’ resolve.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Do you think about the afterlife very often, Father?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Remus continues, his breathing slightly labored; </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I spend so much time rolling it around in my head I might as well go into seminary myself. I think God and I might be on the same page here, with all that giving and taking away—is that blasphemous? Not intended. I just—</span>
  </em>
  <span>fuck,</span>
  <em>
    <span> I just wanted to tell you I was lying the other day before I forgot. I care about what you think of me, you see, which is probably ridiculous but I’m too far past the point of worrying about that now.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Absently, Sirius bites down lightly on the knuckle of one finger. He stares at the answering machine light as though it holds any of his disparate answers—why this, why now, why Remus in an addled twist of guilt in the small hours of the morning?</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I only hope,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Remus’ voice breathes in a soft crackle, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m not too far gone with all my own fuck-ups to get a good one. Afterlife, I mean. I started going back to church for a reason, you know, but then I found you there and I’m afraid that might have ruined my chances handily.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> There’s a shifting sound on Remus’ end, the ghost of a breath or a gasp between the words, and Sirius’ stomach drops sweetly as his eyes go wide and he realizes the obvious heat in Remus’ tone.</span>
  <em>
    <span> “I know I’m supposed to focus on the services, the messages, but I can only ever think about you when you’re up there at the altar. Do you know what you do to me, Father? Do you have any idea h</span>
  </em>
  <span>—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The message ends with a click, the limit of the recording cutting itself off in the middle of Remus’ building intensity. Sirius stares at the wheels of the cassette tape through the foggy plastic covering it in the machine as though he could make the recording continue, see it through to Remus’ own sordid end through sheer force of will. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Do you know what you do to me, Father?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius shudders. His heart beats heavily behind his ribs, the angles of his nightmare replacing themselves steadily with all sorts of unbidden imaginings of Remus sprawled out with his phone in one hand and unimaginable pleasure in the other. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hesitates for the half-life of another phantom answering machine message, hunched over himself as the sound of denial screams high and hot in Sirius' inner ear, before he hisses a sharp "Dammit all," to himself and kills it with one broad, serrated stroke. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius slips one hand into his waistband while the other flips the rewind button, and he leans back in his chair to revel again and again in Remus' addled splendor.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius is used to seeing it out here in the forest, especially in a winter so bitter as the present with nearly a foot of snow on the ground—branches naked, leaves wet and dead underneath the ice, creatures quieted to near-full silence—but something about the unexpectedness of it even in spite of the stillness hurts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A rabbit carcass stares up at him from a lurid splatter of its own blood, torn nearly in half on the snow to the left of the snowshoe path Sirius uses for his afternoon walks. Its eyes are wide, terrified, pupils blown huge in death’s torpor. A spill of guts slips out from the hole on its side, as though whatever tore into it wanted merely to kill it and not eat it. The treetops shiver with a chilled rattle when a breeze sighs past. Sirius eases down to his knees beside the poor creature without care for the chill, his palms held flat in the air above the rabbit on a compulsion that rises up in him from a place he can’t quite track.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Depart, O Christian soul, out of this world,” Sirius murmurs, steam hot from his mouth. “In the Name of God the Father Almighty who created you; in the Name of Jesus Christ who redeemed you; in the Name of the Holy Spirit who sanctifies you. May your rest be this day in peace, and your dwelling place in the Paradise of God.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing changes. Animals, he knows from every teaching and reading on souls over which he’s ever pored, don’t have anything to commend to the afterlife.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Do you think about the afterlife very often, Father?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius shivers. He rises to his feet, brushes off his pant legs, and hesitates slightly before giving a hasty sign of the cross. He continues down the path, the boughs creaking faintly in daytime peace, and tries to forget the feeling of belonging that overtakes him whenever he lets pieces of Remus into his mind.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The day after the first, the same trail but further out from the house, Sirius finds a second rabbit carcass. Split this time with its head torn messily from its body, it makes another dark stain on the snow that last night’s dusting had covered from the last corpse closer back toward the house. Nothing of it looks eaten again—simply defiled, used, forgotten by whatever killed it—and Sirius resists the instinct to dredge up old memories from Ten Sleep as the impulse to do it bubbles up in him. His left side twinges.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Morte ad vitam, in commutationem;</span>
  </em>
  <span> the chant still threads its way into his head despite himself, although he does without the strange suspension of reality that tends to throw him back into vivid thoughts of the hunting lodge when it takes him unawares.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Going down on one knee again, Sirius closes his eyes and holds a hand out over the rabbit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Depart, O Christian soul, out of this world…”</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Friday. Not a rabbit this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius stares, fear thrumming just a bit behind his breastbone to take in the doe splayed out in another flurry of blood in the churned-up snow beneath her. Her left foreleg is hanging onto her body with nothing but a grotesque thread of sinew, her stomach shredded open by what could only be something with a terrifying row of teeth or claws worthy of knifepoint. Her neck is thrown back in slackened supplication, surrendered to finality, and Sirius can’t seem to shake the sense that she didn’t deserve this.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It is our job to determine the end. That is why we Hunt,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Orion’s voice choruses without willing it in Sirius’ head, making him start there in the woods. He is alone and he knows this, but a feeling of dread presses heavily on his shoulders. The compulsion to bless another poor creature is trampled by a dormant instinct to plague its lifeforce into the ground—into the dirt, into the pattern that could be carved there, into the blood that might pool in the shape of that rune that burns sometimes against the backs of Sirius’ eyes as he sleeps. He blinks in a flurry, tries to press the blackened craving out of his body, but he raises his hands anyways.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Descendunt in lacum,” Sirius chants into the cold, his brow furrowed in refusal to submit to the duress sparking up in his veins as it compels him; “Forum pascere, Forum ducat, Forum implebis. In cunis noctis, Forum rogaverat.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A crow caws sharply and bursts through the rattle of branches high above. Sirius gasps on the cold, shocked to find tears spilling past his lower lashes as the cloying miasma of confusion clears with the end of the terminus prayer still feeling as though it’s suspended in the frigid air. “I’m sorry,” he wheezes, falling to his knees; “I’m so sorry, I’m sorry, forgive me, please forgive me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doe says nothing in death. Sirius cries quietly to the emptiness, his left side twinging sharply and his heart pulling with sympathetic pain, and wishes he had any answers at all for the maddening, serpentine twists of reality. He stays there for longer than he cares to track, praying and apologizing and trying his best to collect himself on his knees in the wet Jericho snow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He staggers home, exhausted, with what feels like lead weights strapped to his feet instead of snowshoes. Sirius' side hurts worse than a stitch in his lung, radiating and searing as though a peach pit were jammed between the rungs of his ribs. Sirius stops short when he sees a set of footsteps that don't belong to him leading to and away from the stoop. A small yellow square of a note is stuck to the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Stopped by. Shouldn't have. Sorry. -Remus</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius sweeps it off with a shaky hand and crumples it in a fist, the angular handwriting within creasing and collapsing on itself like a dying star. All he can ever fixate on lately when he lets himself think about Remus is the white-hot jag of desire that floods him from tip to tail, and it doesn't do to addle himself with the thick of it after such close proximity to the no-go zone of deep-veined memories dredged up from Ten Sleep. Sirius steps into the house before he turns and leans his forehead against the flat of the door shut behind him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Jesus," he whispers to himself. He can't tell whether or not he's hissing it as a ward against the blackened char of guilt rising thick in his throat or just as the heavy sigh of exhaustion it would be for anyone else. He shuts his eyes, frozen there in the foyer with snow still stuck to the toes of his boots and the pink of cold and exertion stained around the dried tears beneath his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The house remains silent. Nothing changes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing changes. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s been days since the voicemail, and Sirius has stayed quiet about it despite his compulsion to pull Remus into the nearest corner and demand and explanation—how </span>
  <em>
    <span>dare</span>
  </em>
  <span> he bring such shuddering beauty into Sirius’ life, how absolutely </span>
  <em>
    <span>dare</span>
  </em>
  <span> he wake up the silent chill of Sirius’ heart beyond the walls he’s so painstakingly built there? He refuses to bring it up first. Remus hardly even seems to remember it, which is its own quiet ache in and of itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s dangerous. Sirius knows this. It’s dangerous to throw dice with this draw he feels toward Remus, dangerous to play the tape back every few nights and imagine the splendid shapes Remus might make in his sheets or a desk chair or even just splayed out on the floor, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Christ</span>
  </em>
  <span>—Sirius can’t help it. He feels a kinship, a pull toward Remus, just as unexplained and intense as the depth of Sirius’ climax every time he listens to that unspooling glory in its grainy handset recording he keeps in the drawer beside his bible and comes hard there in his chair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s dangerous not to cut this off. Sirius is at once a coward and a lionheart in the face of it as he lets it spin onward.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avoiding sleep like the plague, Sirius sits awake for what very well might be the third night in a row. He’s hunched over his desk and staring unseeing at the open page before him, the text of Isaiah scrimming in his vision as he tries and fails to study it—</span>
  <em>
    <span>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>If he sleeps, he’s met with terror in the repetition of that dream in the Ten Sleep woods; </span>
  <em>
    <span>Here, here, here.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tied down to waking, pinioned against it unwillingly, Sirius aches with exhaustion but at least doesn’t have to relive the hunting lodge and the blameful stare of his father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The telephone rings like the hewing bite of a wolf. Sirius doesn’t let it complete its second ring before he snatches up the handset, hallowed as a water skein in the desert.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oh—hello, Father.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a breathless catch in his voice, the same dreamlike air that had pervaded Remus’ message. Sirius’ guts flex, instinctive to wrench toward desire with all the silt of craving kicked up there in the evidence of arousal. It’s blatant this time, sewn thick around even just three words like crimson bunting and spinning forward as Remus' breath crackles the handset lightly. Sirius leans back in his chair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going to waste time,” he murmurs, “asking you whether or not you’re alright this time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lightness of Remus’ chuckle strokes along Sirius’ ear as in a kiss. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m alright. I don’t quite know where I am right now, but I’m alright.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius palms himself through his jeans, the old wood of his chair groaning softly. “Are you safe?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yeah.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> He nearly gasps it, half a plea, and Sirius bites down hard on his lip as his pulse dips low to hear it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m in a phonebooth somewhere across town, the snow has let up. I feel—I feel as though I’ve been outside for a long time, like I’ve been hunting. My hands ache. My mouth is tired. I—I wanted to talk to you, even just for a bit.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you called.” Sirius’ mouth dries out as he says it, and the courage it takes to forge onward comes from some place in his marrow he summons with a deep breath; “I’ve kept the tape, from your last call.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus is quiet for a moment, a comfortable quiet. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I...vaguely remember that night.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> There’s a shift on his end of the line, a huff of worked-up breath; </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Refresh my memory?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Swallowing thickly, Sirius squeezes the hardening bulge between his legs and tightens his hold on the telephone. “‘Do you know what you do to me, Father?’” he quotes evenly. Remus breathes another little laugh, one that sounds like it tips his head back to rest on the plexiglass of the phonebooth.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Right. I suppose I should count myself lucky you’re still talking to me after something like that, shouldn’t I?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“On the contrary.” Sirius fingers his zipper with a slow draw of his forefinger, flirting with the beautiful threat of giving himself over fully to private madness. “I was worried you didn’t even remember it. Why haven’t we talked about it since, Remus?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a rubied sound of bliss ripped up from the core of Remus’ throat.</span>
  <em>
    <span> “God, say my name again.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You stopped by my house the other day,” Sirius murmurs, his thumb hooked over his waistband as though it will hold off his compulsion to touch himself for much longer at all. “Are you sure everything is alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“It’s as fine as it’s going to get, Father,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Remus groans. He breathes a sharp sound, a jag of pleasure, and Sirius is sure Remus has a fist wrapped around himself now in the lonely silence of some roadside phone booth. The thought bolts him hard through the belly in the best way. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Say my name again.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius finally slides his zipper down and folds his fly open wide, drawing his cock out thick and already pearling at the tip. “Tell me about what sort of afterlife you imagine, Remus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“It’s full of greenery. I’m the only person there, it isn’t heaven or hell. It’s an in-between, and I get to stay forever.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think yourself unworthy of paradise?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oh, Father,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Remus croons, his teeth bitten together around a hiss of abject pleasure, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“to be alone with nothing but the woods is paradise to me.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius shuts his eyes hard around a rich beat of his pulse, a jump that makes his cock twitch in his fist along with the dreamy cast of Remus’ voice. “The woods here, in Jericho,” he breathes, “what about those?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I want to bring you with me one of these days. I want you to follow me into the forest, into the trees, and I want you to fuck me into the snow.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“God,” Sirius’ voice breaks as he begins a steady stroking with his fist along his length. “How long have you wanted that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Since the first day I saw you up there, dressed in all your robes, chanting about body and blood and communion,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Remus pants. The receiver is close to his mouth, close enough that Sirius can imagine pulling him forward and licking into those lips like a depthless chalice. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I want us to devour each other, Father, I want to taste you and know some fucking peace when I shut my eyes.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius can hardly hold back the broken cry that trips off his tongue as he imagines Remus beneath him, wrapped around him, his face buried in Sirius’ neck with the hazy fade of the forest spinning around their union. “Take this,” he murmurs, “eat of it, this is my body, which is broken for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Fuck me, Father</span>
  </em>
  <span>—</span>
  <em>
    <span>God, I want you so badly I can hardly even dream lately, it’s just you. It’s always you.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus is panting, wild, breathing as though he’s sprinting through the stands of trees that scrape into the Jericho wilderness in wide, unforgiving swaths. Sirius picks up his own pace, tipping his hips up into it, heedless of the hedonism swallowing him whole here in the sitting room. “How do I fuck you when you think of me, Remus?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Deep,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Remus chokes out, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“and slow, and as though you’re committing it to memory. Like you’re preparing me for communion, savoring my flesh.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want others to receive your body as well? Do you want a congregation to fuck you too?”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“The trees can watch, the wolves can watch and the forest can bend to hear us, but only you,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Remus cries, keening and attenuated in the spiral of fast-approaching arrival; </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I only want you tasting me, fucking me, I—! Christ, Father, I want you so bad, I’m gonna fucking come.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come for me,” Sirius hisses intently, his own limit rocketing forward as he hears Remus approach oblivion—</span>
  <em>
    <span>Descendunt in lacum,</span>
  </em>
  <span> his mind tolls like a blackened bell before he shoulders it away with blind pleasure. “Show me how much you want me, Remus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A broken yelp of a shout, a war of bliss and the small pit of suffering that suffuses orgasm, bursts out from Remus’ end of the phone, hemmed by desperate whines as Remus sees himself through the rich crest of climax. Sirius works himself quickly to the sound of it, shuts his eyes and imagines the image; Remus with his throat exposed, head back against the wall behind him, his pants hastily thrown open as his cock pulses ropes of seed out to drool down his fist and splatter at his feet. Sirius cums with his own low groan when it becomes too much to hold onto, too much for his heart to compress without bursting, and he watches his own cock spend in several hard, thick pulses along the fabric of his jeans and the edge of his desk. He barely misses the open bible with the furthest jot of it, still open to the book of Isaiah. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"You don't know," Sirius finally gasps into the silence on the other end of the phone, "what you do to me."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus pauses, his senses still returning to him if the soft tell of his breath against the handset is to be believed. </span>
  <em>
    <span>"Oh, but I do."</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>They share quiet again for several seconds. Sirius lifts his hand to his mouth and licks off a stripe of seed from the gap between his thumb and forefinger. "Get home safe," he says softly, tasting salt and bittersweetness on his tongue. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"I feel," </span>
  </em>
  <span>Remus murmurs with a very slight smile in his voice, </span>
  <em>
    <span>"like part of me is already there."</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The click of the line going dead is a surprise, sudden and too-soon for Sirius' calming pulse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sits with the telephone still pressed against his ear for some time after then, listening to the dull dialtone as his cock softens against his thigh and his heart rate slows. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Home,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius thinks idly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He does not examine too closely how deeply those woods in Remus' paradise feel like something of the sort when he lets his imagination wander.  </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s been fourteen days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shouldn’t be complaining. Christ had nearly double that—forty days on his own, forty days with the devil, but Sirius has made his own sort of devil out of all this, hasn’t he? The difference here is that he’s made bread from these stones; he’s thrown himself from the pinnacle of this temple, succumbed to temptation and then some in the desert of adoration. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius is hardly worthy any longer, he tells himself, to consider himself a minister of anything adjacent to grace as long as his heart and his soul and the entire seedling of his being pulls toward the forest and the sweet pain of old memories now. Toward the moribund peak of desire. Toward Remus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They haven’t spoken since that last phonecall, but with the flexion and press of that boundary crossed, then broken, then trod under the feet of cantering craving, Sirius can’t quite blame Remus. He blames himself, mostly, at the same time he listens back to Remus’ first voicemail and memorizes every curve and intake of his breath. He hardly sleeps. His left side is consistently aching now, his nerves are sheared to dirt, he couldn’t even go in for service last Sunday or hold Thursday’s vigil mass. His day is a cycle of eat-stare-come-doze-snowshoe-eat-come-stare-sleep, and half the time he finds more of those poor carcasses in the woods while he’s out and sleep becomes impossible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dreams in those rare fits of drifting off. At the core they’re always the same: Orion pulls the rusted-out truck up to the hunting lodge, he dons his mask and outfits Sirius with his own, they begin the final Hunt, and the surge of wolves crashes in before it can be completed. Sirius always ends up in the woods somehow with his side carved open—falls through the floor, gets carried on the backs of the beasts themselves, shuts his eyes in fear before opening them up again to find the lodge has disappeared and only the forest remains. It makes him painfully, intently aware of the slim scar at his ribs, twinging whenever he wakes or lets his mind prod at the Old Way, but that’s just coincidence. The scar came from a bicycle accident when he was a boy, he tells himself with stubborn intent, riding too quickly on the ice and taking a spill into the brambles. There is nothing in these dreams that crosses over with reality...save for the strange resonance his unconscious has seemed to strike with Remus over the last several weeks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sometimes the dreams shift and it’s Sirius performing the rites. The last three days, in scraps of sleep stolen on the armchair in the sitting room, he’s found himself in his father’s position while he dictates the ceremony to a charred body at his feet—clawed hands and bared teeth frozen in burnt desiccation, as though the rite has already seen itself through and swallowed its host up in profane flame. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Succendetur et devorabitur,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the tolling thrum of the Forum’s voice had risen up inside him, </span>
  <em>
    <span>nunc tempus tuam.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Last night’s dream was a riot of bone, blood, and snow. Sirius had found himself the clearing again, following the low and graveled </span>
  <em>
    <span>Here, here, here,</span>
  </em>
  <span> only to find the wolf alone without the head on his paws. Waking had thrown clarity into a madness of spangled fragments, but Sirius can remember the wolf lunging at him and burying its teeth into his side as though he were truly Orion instead of just taking his place. He had looked down at the wolf as it bit into him, ripping through skin and fat and flesh to pull black blood welling up around each puncture, and felt far more so the depthless sadness echoing up at him in those human eyes instead of the pain of mauling. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m sorry,</span>
  </em>
  <span> they seemed to cry up at him, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m so, so sorry.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The sadness; that’s what really twists the proverbial knife. It’s ruining his sense of waking reality.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Presently, Sirius is in the middle of the second “stare” stage in his daily rota—boneless on the armchair, the television turned to static, his awareness shuttering in quick flashes between the overwhelming darkness of his dreams and the bright mundanity of waking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A knock on the door throws him into an addled panic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Is Sirius even awake? The dark outside the windows looks deep, deeper than Ten Sleep, and Sirius feels his heart tick up to a pounding sprint as he stands. The neutral, Anglican-bland colors of the house around him seem to smear together, twisting as he staggers to his feet—still wearing his pajamas, half-damp with sweat and sodden with exhaustion, </span>
  <em>
    <span>there.</span>
  </em>
  <span> The hunting rifle, Orion’s old rifle, the only vestige of Wyoming taken into Vermont, everything else would have burnt itself up into ash crossing out of the Forum’s limits, everything besides Sirius himself; but why him? Why does he matter? How did he escape the jaws of their terror, the blood of guilt and responsibility, what’s left inside him of their cultish fury?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ side twinges sharply as he takes the rifle down from the mantle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The knocking comes again, not a pounding but a calm rap of knuckles, and somehow it ramps up Sirius’ nerves more sharply than if an entire brigade had smashed the door to pieces. He cocks the rifle, hefts it in one trembling arm, and stalks over to the door. Is that howling coming from beyond the treeline, out there in the night? Sirius leans against the jamb and takes several shaking breaths. There is madness here, there is confusion and terror and the low hum of fear in his veins, here, </span>
  <em>
    <span>here, Here—</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius shakes his head to clear the noise and swings the door open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I—Jesus fuck, Father, are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The present to slams back into clarity as Sirius looks into those brass-gold eyes and stills. The distant howling stops. The high whine of white noise rising deep in Sirius’ ears cuts off in a gasp. He blinks several times and leans heavily in the wall. “What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He realizes that Remus has blood smeared across his hands and the lower half of his face then, and looks just as confused as Sirius feels. “I don’t know,” Remus admits, his eyes darting around the stoop with the night pressed quietly around him, “I—I needed to talk to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whose blood is that?” Sirius’ teeth ache as he speaks, his voice rough with disuse over the past several days. Remus’ gaze flashes, rimed by lassitude and a thin wash of fury, and he sets his teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think it’s mine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus eyes the rifle and Sirius waffles a bit before disarming it and letting it clatter to his feet as he presses a bewildered hand to his forehead. “Shit. I—fuck. Come inside.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You weren’t there on Sunday,” Remus says as he steps around the width of the door and heels it shut behind him. Sirius leans heavily against the wall behind him, the foyer thin and secretive to keep them close to one another, and shakes his head wearily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not feeling well. You, though, I mean…” Sirius gestures loosely at his mouth and chin, the flat of his palms, as Remus takes blithe stock of the gore strewn there as though it were simply dirt instead of drying blood. “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus leans back against his own wall, and it’s then that Sirius realizes he’s wearing a backpack or satchel of some kind slung across his shoulders. “I could ask you the same thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius ignores the fact he probably looks like death risen. “I’m not feeling...myself, at all, honestly, Remus, what happened?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A dry snort comes out of Remus’ mouth, and Sirius is almost unsettled by how easily he seems to wear the blood that isn’t his smeared across his face. “Welcome to my brain, Father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t fucking call me that.” Sirius bristles sharply, unexpectedly, and stops for a moment before burying his face in his hands and taking a deep stilling breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What should I call you then?” Remus murmurs. Sirius takes another breath, and then another. He removes his hands slowly and combs them both back into his tangled hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why are you here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus shrugs. “I don’t know. I woke up on your doorstep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What, you couldn’t have called?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bitterness that rises up on Sirius’ tongue is shocking to both of them, with the way Remus’ eyes widen slightly. Sirius bites his tongue. Neither of them speak for a long moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was at home,” Remus says slowly, watching Sirius like a wild animal—like </span>
  <em>
    <span>he’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> the one with blood all over him—“And then I blacked out, and now I’m here. I woke up. On your doorstep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“With something else’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>blood</span>
  </em>
  <span> on you,” Sirius coughs out. He lets a disbelieving skip of laughter huff out of him and drops both hands to his sides, letting his hair hang wild and limp. “What the fuck, Remus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been out of it for two weeks, Sirius, you think I know what the fuck I’m actually doing here? I left my house somewhere along the way. Something in me clearly thinks you’re safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or you’re going to tear into me next.” Sirius gestures again at Remus’ hands, fear spidering together with confusion and need and excitement in one great web around his guts. Remus narrows his eyes—</span>
  <em>
    <span>wolf’s eyes, forest eyes, sorrow’s eyes; I’m sorry, I’m so, so sorry—</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It—no. Please.” Sirius licks his dry lips, scrapes at the light day’s-worth of stubble on his face with a flat hand; “Don’t leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quiet takes them, leaning across from one another in the middle-dark of the unlit foyer with the hunting rifle on the floor, without any of the scrimmy comfort of the phone line between them to buffer it. Sirius grinds his teeth together and tries to make words work. Remus wipes his palms together idly as though smearing blood on blood will make it go away somehow. He ignores the mess on his lips. Sirius ignores the compulsion to pull him forward and kiss him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I dreamed about you all last week,” Remus finally whispers. Sirius looks up, aimless hound pointing at an unseen game hen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good dreams?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Strange dreams.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Those can be good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus rolls the tip of his tongue along his upper row of teeth as though idly counting them behind his closed lips. “I wouldn’t call them good. There was snow, and fear, and something dying. But it wasn’t you dying, it—you were there. Always.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyelids flit in a fussy squint. Sirius watches him carefully, unblinking. “Whose fear is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Remus presses the heel of his hand onto his forehead, as though staving off the sudden onset of a terrible headache. He winces.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In your dreams,” Sirius clarifies, “who is afraid? What dies?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus hunches over a little, his breath thickening. Something in the air shifts; Sirius feel the vague threat of the unknown descend on the house like a roosting vulture. “Never me,” Remus wheezes, “and never you. The others are afraid, the usurpers, they try to keep us from meeting, from joining, from...from making you </span>
  <em>
    <span>whole.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ heart squeezes, the same distant sensation from the morning in the church office when Remus had first mentioned his dreams. “Why are we meeting in the first place?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We close the loop,” Remus says slowly, as though the words are hot slag that hurts to bear from his tongue; “the others, the Forum, they fall apart when we discover each other.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eyes going wide, Sirius barely has enough time to register the fact that Remus has just dragged Sirius’ past up from the bottom of the frozen lake of denial deep inside him without him ever mentioning anything of the sort—Remus looks up at him, pins him with a feral stare that feels like transformation, and surges forward to press a hungry, desperate kiss onto Sirius’ mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A sharp pang shoots out from Sirius’ left side, but the sensation of Remus leaning into him and pressing him back against the wall is far more immediate. He reaches up automatically to bury his fingers into the short tangle of Remus’ curls, pulling him closer, tilting his own face to the side as he opens his mouth to an insistent tongue, heedless of the blood and the iron taste coming in along with it. The confusion and the fug of loneliness dissipates as intense, foreign, distilled belonging floods into Sirius along with Remus’ breath. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Here,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the moment seems to toll, especially as Remus presses his right hand to Sirius’ ribs and holds him there, warm and slightly sticky and perfect in his disrepair, </span>
  <em>
    <span>here, here, here.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius kisses him as though he will die without Remus’ breath and receives the same. He opens his mouth even further, willingly, to Remus’ two fingers when they slip up his neck and chin and into the wet parting of his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pill on his tongue hardly registers, even as his vision begins to fur black around its edges.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last thing Sirius sees before he passes out is the sight of the cross above the door he folded together last spring’s Palm Sunday, warping back and forth between the dry ecru of the frond itself and the shape of the horrific trio of shrike skulls from far, far away.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wakes up in the bathtub. No water drawn. Bath towels bunched and propped up around him to keep him upright.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The unconsciousness just past had been the thickest and most comforting sleep Sirius has gotten in days, and he wants to rail against the incoming wakefulness like a gale and slip heavily back to its blind comfort. “Please,” he croaks, extending one hand out the cold blue tile across from him—</span>
  <em>
    <span>Please,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he means to say, </span>
  <em>
    <span>send me back, let me sleep, let me</span>
  </em>
  <span>—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hold still, Sirius.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a warm touch then on his shoulder, a warm touch still crusted with wild blood. His shirt is rucked up to his chest, baring his ribs and stomach, and Sirius scrapes at coherence as he swings his eyes to the left. Remus has him fixed with an even stare, his eyes bright and untamed even in the fog of Sirius’ incomprehension, and a scalpel readied over the skin between Sirius’ eleventh and twelfth ribs. “Hold onto me,” Remus bids him, nodding once as though convincing both of them of a staunch decision; “this will be painful.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius sucks on a gasp, prepared to demand </span>
  <em>
    <span>What the fuck do you mean, what will be painful,</span>
  </em>
  <span> but Remus presses the scalpel in and Sirius’ skin gives like silk around the blade to part with the slow drag of incision.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His shout echoes flatly against the tile walls, pain gnashing into his torso. Sirius' mind fogs and stabs the image of the the wolves from his dreams into every annal of his consciousness, ripping and slavering and burning, burning, </span>
  <em>
    <span>burning</span>
  </em>
  <span> as he gasps for breath around agony. Sirius grips Remus' wrist hard, clenched in a vise, with his thumb digging hard into the meat of Remus' palm. The blood there comes off against his thumbprint, smears over his fingers, staining Sirius' skin with wilderness as his body spangles horror. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's alright," Remus says as he slowly carves into Sirius' side beyond the mists of panic, "I'm sorry, I know it hurts, but we I have to do this. I'm helping you, Sirius. I told you I was drawn to you, and I figured it out."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius clenches his jaw so tightly he can nearly hear his molars sing, crying out a long groan through bared teeth as tears build at the corners of his eyes. Remus meets his eyes, molten gold, sympathy spilling over like nectar as Sirius pleads silently with him to make it stop, please, just finish whatever he needs with Sirius' body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"There's something inside you," Remus continues. He shifts the wrist Sirius has a hold on and grips their hands together, knits their fingers into one another and let's Sirius squeeze his hand even more tightly than his arm. "It's been calling to me for weeks, and I need to get it out. I need, </span>
  <em>
    <span>we, </span>
  </em>
  <span>need, to end something—we need to close the loop, Sirius. You feel it too, don't you?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally he finishes slicing, dropping the scalpel to the floor with a light clatter. Sirius takes deep and raking breaths and tries not to whine around his ragged gasps for purchase on sanity. "Fuck—!" he chokes out before he tries and fails not to look down at the incision now weeping blood down his side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Don't you feel it?" Remus insists. He tightens his own grip on Sirius' hand, giving it a little shake before he reaches up and turns Sirius' face by the chin to latch their gazes together. "Please, Sirius, I need to know you understand this too."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius wheezes, addled and plagued with terror, the corners of his mouth flecked with spittle and the edges of his eyes wet with tears, and forces himself to hold fast to lucidity. He feels surety rise up in him, something lurching and viscous and thick as ichor, something from deep inside him feeling ready to spill out, and squeezes his eyes shut. "I—yes, go, do it, fuck, Remus, what—!"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay. I need you to breathe. Whatever I do, you can't stop breathing."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus releases Sirius' chin, moves his hand back down to the open wound, and slips it inside the incision down to the wrist. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius sees white and shouts again, a scream of resistance that comes from somewhere outside his body, and rips his hand out of Remus' grip to hold fast to the lip of the bathtub instead. He can only feel Remus' movement at the clean edges of the incision, pressing in, feeling for something in the wet nest of organs beyond the parted viscera, and it's without contest the strangest and most chilling thing Sirius has ever felt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Stay with me, Father," Remus says as sweat glistens beneath the skim of his curls at his eyebrows. His forehead is furrowed in concentration, his teeth gritted as he concentrates on twisting his fingers carefully through Sirius' guts. "Lead a prayer for us."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Our Father," Sirius gasps automatically, trying at once not to move and rip himself away from the invasion all at once, "who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus nods once, his slowed breathing cutting through his bared teeth in a low rush—a small part of Sirius, the one part left that isn't raging for shelter from pain, wonders distantly if this is how Remus focuses on his emergency calls. "Good, Sirius. Keep going."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day—</span>
  <em>
    <span>aaah!—</span>
  </em>
  <span>our daily bread, and forgive us our tresp—fuck, Remus, I can't do this. It hurts, it fucking hurts, I'm—"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You </span>
  <em>
    <span>can,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius, we're almost there. I know it's inside you, I know this is it. Keep going, please. We're so close."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius lets out a dry sob, his vision smeared over with tears, and nods blindly along with Remus' encouragement even as pain swallows him in white fire. He swallows down a dry, sticky gulp. "...and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation and deliver us from evil—"</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Yes!"</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Gasping on a violent seize inside him, every ounce of his body crying resistance to it, Sirius feels Remus begin drawing his closed fist out of Sirius' body. He squeezes his eyes shut, the pain becoming more than unbearable—hellish, torrential pain, radiating from every nerve ending under his skin—and soldiers on to the end of the prayer; "For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Amen."</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius' eyes snap open as the word resonates for the first time with true depth, lucidity rushing into focus like blue ink into a glass of undisturbed water. The whole room, every corner, the edges of Remus' hair catching light like filament, the lurid red staining the entirety of Sirius' left side, it all feels so much more present in an instant—alive, as though a blockage has been removed from Sirius' soul, and he can't hold back another ecstatic sob of shock because yes, oh, the pain, the pain is still there, but the </span>
  <em>
    <span>relief!</span>
  </em>
  <span> The absolute thrill of relief flooding him at once is overwhelming, he—</span>
  <em>
    <span>oh.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>There in Remus' hand, drawn out from Sirius' insides, lies the seed of every last horror stuck to Sirius' life like poisonous, ironclad burrs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Memories come rushing back on the heels of that relief, cloying and horrible and just as terrifying as they had been as a child—Sirius meeting the members of Forum, being introduced as their </span>
  <em>
    <span>last hope,</span>
  </em>
  <span> donning his own bone mask every full moon to watch the terrifying dances and sacrifices made in the clearing beyond Orion's hunting lodge. Sirius training to perform the rites himself, wielding the staff, learning how to skin and segment animal carcasses in the proper defilement to offer up to the Old Way. Sirius getting lashed to the stone altar in the lodge's basement, the elders chanting, the stone knife carving into his side as they blessed the runestone in Orion's palm—</span>
  <em>
    <span>Please, papa, stop it! Make them stop! I don't want to, I'm scared, please, please stop—</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sirius, look at me. Sirius. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sirius."</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Here. Here. HERE.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius slams back into the present, his chest tight with panic, and tries to focus on the gentle murmur of Remus' raw voice. He hears a faint hissing alongside it and looks down at Remus' hand, held in front of him like a different sort of offering, and watches as it begins dissolving into black ash—slippery and shimmering with Sirius' blood but undeniably that same stone, the rune for </span>
  <em>
    <span>End</span>
  </em>
  <span> carved deep into its one flat side, it has seven thick protrusions slithering their way out of its edges as though it had taken root between Sirius' ribs before Remus had torn it out. Sirius feels emptied, lightened...</span>
  <em>
    <span>released.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>"You were their solution," Remus says fervently, up on his knees now to press heavily on Sirius' open wound with a thick pad of gauze in his free hand as Sirius stares at the decaying stone; "they planted the last of their power in you and intended to let it grow there until it burst."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius doesn't blink until the rock is completely ash, and it seems fairly fitting in the face of incongruent finality that Remus merely wipes off the soot from his trembling palm on the leg of his jeans before moving to help Sirius, guides his own hands to press down on his side along with Remus. He speaks in a drained wheeze; "How?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The dreams only told me so much, but it's over, Sirius. We sealed that ending. You're safe."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not knowing what else to do, Sirius nods. Remus leans in and kisses him again, a kiss of arrival and survivor's passion all at once, and Sirius leans into it fully. He responds as best he can—tongue tangling, teeth nipping, nuzzling, breathing—until he feels the combination of every sensation rear up to drag him back into unconsciousness again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last thing Sirius feels before murky dark swallows him gently with Remus still tending to his skin and bone is freedom, leagues of it, shot through his very heart to the ends of each vein opening now to drink up the ambrosia of dreamless, peaceful sleep. </span>
