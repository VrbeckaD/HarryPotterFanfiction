    <p>“Draco, you know how I feel about Halloween,” Harry said with a sigh, dropping his coat over the back of a chair in their shared flat.</p>
<p>“I was there, so yes, I remember,” Draco said, “In fact, I distinctly remember you being utterly miserable. And It looks like you’re halfway there already.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m just asking you to humour me, briefly,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Harry said.</p>
<p>Draco nodded, pulling open a small chest in the centre of the room and charming the contents to  float around them like they might hang on a wall for display.</p>
<p>“Costumes?” Harry said, plucking at one and turning to Draco, “They’re a bit small aren’t they?”</p>
<p>Draco held out two small vials filled with a pale orange potion, “De-ageing potion. It will make us about eight years old for two hours.”</p>
<p>Harry took one of the potion vials and rolling it around in his palm.</p>
<p>“Go trick or treating with me,” Draco said.</p>
<p>Harry turned to Draco looking torn, “Trick o treating…I’ve never gone before.”</p>
<p>“Neither have I,” Draco said.</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes, “You’re a wizard.”</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes mockingly back, “My parents had banquets and balls for Halloween, which I wasn’t allowed to attend when I was young, and they were so interminably boring I wished I wasn’t when I was.”</p>
<p>“How do you even know about trick or treating?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Granger told me about it.”</p>
<p>“And you want to do it?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>Draco nodded, “Getting to dress up, loads of free chocolate, and no responsibilities whatsoever? Absolutely.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled faintly and then bit his lip looking down at his hands.</p>
<p>“Your parents wouldn’t want you to mourn them forever,” Draco said his voice quiet and gentle.</p>
<p>Harry narrowed his eyes, “You’re using the voice.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes you listen to the voice,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Manipulative fuck,” Harry said with a grin.</p>
<p>Draco took a step closer, “Aunt Andromeda agreed to be our guardians for the night.”</p>
<p>“And Teddy-”</p>
<p>Draco nodded, “He’ll be along. We can be his big brothers.”</p>
<p>Harry laughed, “We all look totally different!”</p>
<p>“It will be fun. I’m sure of it,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Will we lose our memories?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s a very weak variant of the typical de-ageing potion,” Draco said.</p>
<p>Harry grinned, looking properly excited.</p>
<p>“Is that a yes?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, “Yeah, it is.”</p>
<p>Draco let out a huge breath in relief, “Perfect. We have a half an hour to pick out our costumes before we’re due to floo over to Andromeda’s house.”</p>
<p>Harry turned back to the costumes and randomly picked out a rather tacky zombie costume and raised his eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I just got one of everything,” Draco said.</p>
<p>“I can see that,” Harry laughed, tossing the zombie, werewolf, and witch costume back in the chest.</p>
<p>“I’m going to give the whole lot to Teddy afterwards. He’ll like them,” Draco said.</p>
<p>Harry grabbed a skeleton and a bat costume which were just designs printed onto baggy black onesies and held them up to Draco.</p>
<p>Draco stared at him flatly.</p>
<p>Harry laughed, “You’d look cute in them.”</p>
<p>Draco put his hand on the two hangers and slowly pushed them down, “One, I’d be cute in anything, I was exceptionally adorable as a child. Two, I don’t care what you think-”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>“Three, getting to pick out your own costume is the entire point,” Draco finished.</p>
<p>“You do care what I think,” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Is that the only thing you heard?” Draco said, “And we’re dating, of course I care.”</p>
<p>“Then your list is off,” Harry said.</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes, “Fine. Addendum to point two, I don’t care which costume you think I should wear because see point three.”</p>
<p>Harry tossed the two costumes at the chest, “Which do you want then?”</p>
<p>Draco looked up at the array and finally picked a knight costume made of fake pleathery leather and silvery chain mail cloth, “I want to be a knight, like Sir Galahad or Sir Percival.” He transfigured the thin cloth doublet to a dark green emblazoned with King Arthur’s crest, three gold crowns on an azure shield.</p>
<p>“A knight? Not Merlin?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>Draco raised an eyebrow, “Pretending to be Merlin is for children. Then you grow up and find out Merlin had more power than god but rarely used it or was helpful in any way. And he was a perv.”</p>
<p>Harry blinked, “I must have been asleep during that lesson.”</p>
<p>Draco added a half-cape in green and silver to his costume and conjured a matching shield and helmet. “What are you going to wear?”</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath and looked around, taking down and looking at a firefighter costume, a police bobby costume, lingered for a long time on a cowboy costume with a plastic sheriffs badge, but ended up putting them all back in the trunk. Then he found the dragon costume, with printed scales on thin green cloth and small floppy wings and tail and grinned.</p>
<p>Draco sighed.</p>
<p>Harry took out his wand, tongue sticking out in concentration as he made the costume have slightly nicer fabric, stiff wings and full tail but didn’t change much else. It still looked tacky and horrid and knowing Harry, that was entirely the point.</p>
<p>“You’re obnoxious,” Draco said.</p>
<p>Harry laughed.</p>
