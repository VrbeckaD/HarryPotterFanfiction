          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry’s day was going awfully so far. This was by far the most miserable Friday that he’d had this year, having just barely survived double Potions with the Slytherins and having hardly any appetite for dinner. Malfoy, his cronies, and their stupid badges had been making his life miserable for what felt like months. Harry just wanted Ron to be on his side, at least. Then, today wouldn’t have been nearly as bad.</p><p>At the moment, Harry was on his way to dinner, having told Hermione that he’d meet her in the Great Hall, while she went ahead and got started without him. That was his first mistake.</p><p>The second mistake was walking alone in a hallway far too close to the dungeons for a Gryffindor to be without a friend or two.</p><p>Harry’s abysmal luck never failed him, and he turned a corner only to be face-to-face with the awful ferret, Malfoy. Both of them were alone, no less. </p><p>“Potter.” Malfoy spat.</p><p>“Malfoy.” Harry replied, with the amount of venom in his voice equalling that of Malfoy’s.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be upstairs with the Weasel and the Mudblood?”</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be doing the same with your ogre bodyguards, or are they so thick that they couldn’t find the Hall?”</p><p>The air around the two of them was so tense that you could cut it with a knife. Finally, Malfoy bit back,</p><p>“Don’t go around insulting my friends, Potter, if you know what’s good for you.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? What’re you going to do, get daddy to come beat me up? I’m so intimidated, ferret, honestly, I’m absolutely terrified.”</p><p>That seemed to be the limit for Malfoy. He roughly grabbed Harry by the collar and shoved him against the wall of the corridor, positioning himself so that their noses were almost touching.</p><p>“What’re you going to do now, Malfoy, kiss me?”</p><p>With that comment, it seemed that something in the air had shifted. Malfoy did not move but for his eyes, which had moved to contemplate Harry’s lips.</p><p>Slowly, Malfoy closed his eyes and leaned in even closer. He whispered, almost inaudibly, “Do you want me to?”</p><p>Harry had almost no time to react before Malfoy’s lips were on his. Malfoy, the slimy git, was kissing him! Harry then realized, with astonishing horror, that he <em>liked</em> it!</p><p>Harry then closed his eyes and began to kiss Malfoy back. After all, there was no sense in just standing there if he wasn’t going to resist.</p><p>After some time, it could’ve been minutes or hours, they both seemed to remember themselves and push the other away. Malfoy tried to surreptitiously wipe his mouth on his sleeve, and then hissed, “We will never speak of this. To anyone.”</p><p>“For once, Malfoy, I agree with you.”</p></div>
