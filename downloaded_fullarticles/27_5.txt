    <p>Hermione and Luna listened intently to Ginny relate the story of how she had acquired the fabulous silver necklace she was wearing for the incredible price of only five euros. The three women were in Florence, Italy, tucked in an out of the way café where they had stopped for lunch. They were seated outside, enjoying the cool spring air and the sounds of the city.</p>
<p>“No magic at all?” Hermione asked when Ginny had concluded her tale with a giant satisfied smile.</p>
<p>“None!” Ginny replied. “I’m telling you, flirt a little and you’ll get exactly what you want.”</p>
<p>“What would Harry say?” Luna asked.</p>
<p>“He’d say, ‘Good job; what else can you get?’” Ginny replied and then took a bite from her sandwich of foccacia, ham, fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil.</p>
<p>“I feel bad trying to talk down their prices,” said Hermione. “These merchants have to make a living.”</p>
<p>“They do,” assured Ginny. “They wouldn’t lower their prices if they couldn’t afford to. It’s part of the charm of the market, haggling. You really should get into the game, Hermione.”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “I thought ten euros was a reasonable price for my scarf.”</p>
<p>“I got a very similar one for six euros,” chimed in Luna. “And I have money left over for gelato.” She smiled primly and finished her sandwich, one similar to Ginny’s but without the ham.</p>
<p>“Oh, I have money for gelato,” said Hermione with a laugh. “What do you say, Ginny? I saw three gelatorrias between here and the market. Ginny?”</p>
<p>Ginny wasn’t paying attention to Hermione, but was looking intently at something over Hermione’s shoulder. Her eyes were narrowed and her brow furrowed, as though deep in concentration. “Is that …?” she began. Her eyes widened. “Oh! I don’t believe—I think it <b>is</b>!”</p>
<p>“What? Who?” said Hermione, starting to turn. </p>
<p>Ginny grabbed her arm. “No, don’t look!”</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Luna, her curiosity evident.</p>
<p>Ginny looked from Hermione to Luna with such a serious expression on her face that Hermione instinctively put her hand on her bag where her wand was stowed. The three women hadn’t had a single serious moment during their entire two-week trip, enjoying the freedom of a true vacation from work, responsibilities, and life in general.</p>
<p>“I think … there’s a man sitting at a café across the street, just in the corner of the outdoor seating.  I think it’s Snape.”</p>
<p>“Snape who?” asked Luna evenly.</p>
<p>Hermione’s jaw dropped. “Are you sure, Ginny?”</p>
<p>“Nearly.  Have a look now. He’s gone back to reading. Be subtle!”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded. “Any idea where the nearest Water Closet might be?” she asked as her excuse for turning around. She scanned the cafe briefly and then let her gaze fall on the man in question. She nearly fell out of her chair.</p>
<p>It could truly have been no one else. Even without the black wizarding robes, everything about the man screamed <i>Snape</i>. He was sitting with his back to the wall, facing Hermione’s right but with a view of the whole street. His back was ramrod straight and there was a stack of books on the table beside him. His black hair was a bit shorter than it had been when Hermione had seen him last, falling just to his chin. He wore Muggle clothes: grey trousers, a light green button-up, long-sleeved shirt, and a lightweight, black blazer. From across the street, Hermione was surprised to find that he looked very approachable and even agreeable.</p>
<p>The table was set for one, and he seemed to have ordered only a cup of tea or coffee. A square napkin was set out near the edge of the table with what looked like three sugar cubes on it.</p>
<p>Quickly Hermione turned around and looked at Ginny. “It’s him, all right.”</p>
<p>Luna took a turn and nodded to the others. They sat in stunned silence for a few minutes, until the waiter came over to see if they needed anything. Ginny asked for another bottle of water, <i>no gas</i>, and then she and Luna began talking quietly about Snape.</p>
<p>Hermione was deep in thought. Severus Snape’s body had disappeared from the Shrieking Shack by the time Aurors had arrived to investigate. They’d found a copious amount of blood and traces of an unidentified potion but nothing else to suggest what might have happened after Harry, Ron and Hermione had returned to the castle on the night of the battle. No footprints led to or from the Shack, so the Aurors had concluded that Snape had Disapparated.</p>
<p>Considering his condition at the time, the Aurors had further assumed Snape would go to hospital, but when they’d checked, he hadn’t shown up. When two weeks had passed and there was still no sign of him, they had given up the idea he would go to St Mungo’s.</p>
<p>After six months of half-hearted, fruitless investigation, the Ministry had closed Snape’s file and stopped the search. Harry’s testimony on the behalf of the ex-Death Eater had ensured that he would not have to stand trial, and frankly, the Ministry and the Aurors had a list of dangerous Death Eaters still at large and wanted to focus their attentions toward capturing them.</p>
<p>Six years had passed. </p>
<p>There had been occasional murmurings of what were dubbed “Snape Sightings” by the <i>Daily Prophet</i>, but they had turned up nothing. Almost every month, an article was published in <i>The Quibbler</i> with some witch’s or wizard’s theories on Snape’s whereabouts. </p>
<p>Once the dust had settled following the war trials, Snape quickly became the most interesting character of the war. His double-life, working for a madman, his mysterious disappearance, and ill-fated love of the woman who also happened to be Harry Potter’s mother, all made for the most interesting gossip and speculation.</p>
<p>Luna giggled, bringing Hermione out of her thoughts. She looked at her friend. Both Luna and Ginny were looking at her expectantly.</p>
<p>“What?” Hermione said.</p>
<p>“Dare you to go talk to him,” said Ginny, a mischievous glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyes widened. “<i>What?</i>”</p>
<p>“Talk to him,” said Luna. “We’ve already decided that neither of us is up to the task. Though I would like to ask him if he has come across any three-legged Billaboos during his time in Italy. Perhaps once you’ve warmed him up, Ginny and I could join you.”</p>
<p>Hermione glanced at Ginny whose expression clearly said that Luna’s idea was hers and hers alone. </p>
<p>“Why on earth should any of us go and talk to him? What could we possibly gain from that? Besides, he’d probably bite my head off before I got within ten feet.”</p>
<p>“We’re nearly that close already, and he hasn’t done anything,” said Ginny. “It’s a dare, Hermione; it’s not as if he could hex you here. There doesn’t have to be a good reason behind it.”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes. “What’s in it for me?”</p>
<p>Ginny and Luna exchanged a look. “We haven’t really discussed it. What do you want?”</p>
<p>Hermione thought for a moment. Under normal circumstances … at least, normal before the end of the war … the thought of approaching their former Potions professor while he was eating was appalling. She would get her head bitten off and be insulted at best, hexed and completely demeaned at worst. </p>
<p>Now, after everything she knew about him, things she doubted he would want his closest friends to know much less an entire country, the thought was more and at the same time less terrifying. She didn’t think he would actually hurt her, as he had always been on Harry’s side even when no one knew it or would have believed it. But he was still Snape, and he’d never left any doubt as to his feelings toward Harry and her. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there was something about the Italian air, the easy manner of the lifestyle and the bright, sunny day that made her feel brave. </p>
<p>“Dinner, at a four-star restaurant, tonight. You two split my meal.”</p>
<p>Ginny chuckled. “That’s it? Merlin, Hermione, this is huge! You could’ve … I don’t know, required we do your washing for three months or something like that.”</p>
<p>Hermione sniffed. “Do we have a deal?” </p>
<p>“Sure, Hermione,” said Luna.</p>
<p>Hermione took a sip from her water and took a few deep, steadying breaths. “Wish me luck.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>
    <b>ooo</b>
  </p>
</center>Severus Snape was, to the casual observer, peacefully reading the book, “<i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>.” In fact, he was merely turning the pages at regular intervals and taking occasional sips from his coffee, which was Charmed to stay at his desired temperature. His wand was stowed safely in its holster, a slim pocket sewn into the lining of his blazer. At a moment’s need, he could press a button on the thick, gold ring he wore on his right hand, and a mechanism in the holster would release his wand directly into his hand.<p>A Glock 19 9mm pistol with silencer was tucked into a shoulder holster hidden beneath his jacket.</p>
<p>Snape took another sip of coffee, and as he set the cup back on its saucer, movement caught his eye.  He glanced up to see Hermione Granger walking purposefully toward his table. He was surprised but only briefly. She had been an extraordinarily bright student, despite hiding behind trying to have all the answers, and he had no doubt she was a brilliant woman, thus it took very little imagination to see her fitting right in with his line of work. One lone axon in a dark recessed corner of his mind fired, registering that she was wearing a light green, strappy sundress that perfectly highlighted her toned arms and legs.</p>
<p>“Mind if I sit?” she asked, not waiting for an answer before settling into the chair immediately across from him.</p>
<p>He eyed her impersonally and added one of the three lumps of sugar to his coffee. Though he was trained to remain impassive in his work, and his face betrayed nothing other than professional interest, his mind was spinning at the sudden appearance of his former student. The last time he had seen her had been the night of the Dark Lord’s defeat, when he had given Potter his memories. Had she seen them? Would she mention them? Certainly not while on the assignment, he reminded himself. </p>
<p>She was two minutes early; an anomaly, but then she was always the overachiever. Perhaps this was her first field mission. He would have to wait the two minutes before he could continue.</p>
<p>“I fail to see why you even bothered asking,” he replied, bored.</p>
<p>At that moment, the waiter returned and offered Hermione something to drink. She declined. A light went off on Snape’s watch, alerting him that it was time. What was to happen next would be very straightforward, and he would be on a train to Portovenere within the hour. </p>
<p>He would begin and say, “I recommend the rigate arrabiata.” Slowly, deliberately, he swirled the spoon in his cup. </p>
<p>Then she would reply, “Why didn’t you say that when the waiter was here?” </p>
<p>No, not that. </p>
<p>Snape stopped stirring and looked at her intensely. “I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>Hermione looked at him strangely. “I’ve already eaten, and I’m looking forward to gelato for dessert,” she said, and then reached for one of the sugar cubes on the napkin.</p>
<p>Something was wrong. </p>
<p>Snape’s eyes darted first to the empty street and then to the interior of the restaurant. He saw a waiter looking directly at him and pulling something from an inner coat pocket. Snape didn’t hesitate but reached out and caught Hermione’s hand as she withdrew it in hope of depositing the cube into her mouth.</p>
<p>“Hey!” she said, trying to wrench her arm from his grasp.</p>
<p>Snape was on his feet and moving around the table as he heard the door to the restaurant open. Without paying attention to Hermione’s protests, he pulled her forcibly from her chair, out of the small courtyard, and into an alley. </p>
<p>“Just what do you think—”</p>
<p>He clamped a hand over her mouth, pulled her tightly against him, and with a soft <i>pop</i>, he Disapparated, taking Hermione with him.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~o~</p>
</center>“I think I’d like to have a look at those handbags,” said Ginny as she rummaged through her purse for the money to pay her part of the check.<p>“Oh! Ginny, look!” exclaimed Luna, pointing across the street.</p>
<p>Ginny looked up just in time to see Snape pulling Hermione behind him, and then running from the café and into an alleyway. “What’s he—”</p>
<p>Luna was on her feet, reaching for her wand, when Ginny noticed someone else leaving the café. </p>
<p>“Luna, wait!” she cried, grabbing her friend’s arm and pulling her back into her seat. They watched as one of the waiters, a tall man with striking orange hair, ran from the restaurant.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Luna whispered, pointing discreetly to something in the man’s hand.</p>
<p>Ginny frowned, trying to get a better look, but it was difficult because the man ran in the direction Snape had pulled Hermione. All she could discern was that the object was small and black, sunlight gleaming off its metal surface. The waiter disappeared into the alley, the sun shining off his bright hair.  Ginny and Luna fidgeted, uncertain whether to interfere or wait.  Moments later, when the waiter re-emerged, he was obviously distressed. The waiter didn’t return to the restaurant but walked to the curb. He’d only been stationary for a fraction of a second when a black car screeched to a stop in front of him. </p>
<p>Ginny and Luna stood, stunned, as the waiter disappeared into the car which then sped down the street, around a corner and out of sight. </p>
<p>Luna gave Ginny a worried look. “Let’s go.” She moved toward the gate that led from the enclosed eating area to the sidewalk, her hand once again on her wand.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to pay—wait for me, just in case!”</p>
<p>Ginny tossed a few bills on the table, not bothering to wait for change. She followed Luna across the street, and then cautiously they approached the alley. “I’ll go,” Ginny muttered. Luna nodded. </p>
<p>Ginny quietly counted to three, readying herself for whatever she might see, though doubting she’d find anything. The waiter wouldn’t have left so quickly or have been so upset unless the alley had been empty. On three, she spun around to face the alley, her wand discreetly at the ready. The only thing she saw was a stray cat, which looked at her with a bored expression. </p>
<p>“They must have Disapparated,” said Luna, following Ginny into the alley. </p>
<p>Ginny’s mind raced with what had happened in the space of less than a minute. Hermione had crossed the street and sat across from a man who looked like Severus Snape, then she’d been pulled into an alley and now she was gone. Ginny examined the alley closely, looking for signs of a struggle, or to see if perhaps Snape had left something behind. She found nothing.</p>
<p>Hermione was gone.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to Floo Harry,” Ginny said, returning to where Luna was waiting. </p>
<p>Luna nodded. “Back to the hotel, then?”</p>
<p>Ginny paused, glancing around one more time, desperate for something, anything to be different and give her a clue. “Let’s check the table where he was sitting first.”</p>
<p>They spent half an hour at the café, talking to the staff, the owner, anyone who might have seen more, but it had happened so quickly that no one had noticed a thing. One of the staff said Snape had paid for his coffee up front when he ordered and had asked his waiter, the orange-haired man, to leave him in peace. Other than that, no one had any significant impressions of Snape. It was as though he was completely forgettable.</p>
<p>They did learn one useful piece of information: one of the restaurant’s employees had called in sick that morning but said he was sending his brother to work for him. The ‘brother’ gave his name as Rubio and had been adequate in his work, not drawing any attention to himself, also forgettable, except for the hair.</p>
<p>Finally, Ginny and Luna thanked the people in the restaurant, and they Apparated directly into their hotel room from the same alley where Snape and Hermione had disappeared. Ginny spent a few minutes on the phone setting up an international Floo call. Their hotel was primarily a Muggle one, but it also offered wizarding rooms and services, with amenities such as free use of the local Floo network, fireplaces in each room, and broom servicing.</p>
<p>When the required connections were made and payment sent up, Ginny grabbed a handful of Floo powder, knelt on the floor and stuck her head into the fireplace, then tossed the powder in. “Harry Potter’s office!” </p>
<p>A moderately sized, drab office came into view, but Ginny didn’t see Harry at his desk. She called for him repeatedly, her voice climbing in decibels until she was yelling.</p>
<p>After what felt like an hour, but was really only a couple of minutes, Harry came running into his office, glancing around until he saw his wife’s face in the fire. “Ginny!” he called, rushing toward his fireplace and practically flinging himself to the floor. “What’s going on? Are you all right?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Luna’s fine … it’s Hermione. She was kidnapped.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes widened in shock.</p>
<p>“By Snape,” Ginny said gravely.</p>
<p>“Snape?” Harry repeated incredulously. “<i>The</i> Snape?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Severus Snape, former Death Eater, slimy git, all that. Harry, it was very strange, and Luna and I don’t quite know what to make of it.”</p>
<p>“Tell me what happened,” Harry said, Summoning a pad of parchment and quill with which to take notes.</p>
<p>Ginny told him everything that happened, from the moment she recognized Snape until she returned with Luna to their hotel. Harry scribbled furiously the entire time, stopping her frequently to ask questions, or to repeat something, or for more detail. He seemed most interested in the waiter who had run after Snape and Hermione and the black device he had in his hand.</p>
<p>“Was it shaped kind of like a capital ‘L’?” he asked. </p>
<p>“It might have been … it was hard to see, and everything happened so fast.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, looking over his notes. “Well, it was probably a gun.”</p>
<p>Ginny gasped. “Really? You’ve told me about those—Muggle weapons, used to hurt and kill.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” He frowned. “Did it look like Hermione was following Snape?”</p>
<p>“No, she seemed to be struggling against him.”</p>
<p>“Has she said anything about Snape, anything at all? That she’d heard from him or seen him elsewhere?”</p>
<p>“<i>No</i>, Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry tapped the side of his head with the quill as he stared at his notes. “I’m going to have to contact Steve at MI-6 ….”</p>
<p>“Do you think you’ll find anything?”</p>
<p>He chuckled wryly. “I have no idea. There hasn’t been a single peep from Snape since the end of the war, so I’m pretty sure tracking him down isn’t going to be easy. I need to know if he’s still using his wand … maybe we could put a trace on it.”</p>
<p>“He Disapparated,” said Ginny. “But there’s no way to know if it’s the same wand he had before. Luna and I didn’t see a wand.”</p>
<p>Harry was still frowning as he made a few additions to his parchment. “That’s where I’m going to start. I’ll also put in a call to my Muggle associates at Interpol, see if there’s anything on Snape there. I’m sure we’ve got his fingerprints somewhere around here ….” He looked at Ginny and smiled. “Don’t worry. I can’t really see Snape hurting Hermione. Likely, they were running from the waiter with the gun.”</p>
<p>“But you can’t be sure,” Ginny protested. “Is there anything I can do?”</p>
<p>“Make sure that either you or Luna is at the hotel at all times, window open for an owl, in case Hermione tries to contact you. I might need you to check on things for me ….” He drifted into thought once more. “It will be helpful to know what we’re dealing with. If Snape is in the wizarding world, our job will be much easier, but if he’s primarily in the Muggle … not so easy. I doubt he’s using his real name, regardless ….”</p>
<p>“I can’t just sit here, Harry.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve already got as much information as possible—Oh! Fingerprints! Wait …” Harry jumped up and disappeared from Ginny’s view. When he returned, he had a little box in his hands. “This is a fingerprint kit. Get back to the restaurant as soon as we’re done and dust for that waiter’s prints.”</p>
<p>“How?” </p>
<p>“Sprinkle the powder on places he might have touched, then dust away the excess. Our skin leaves behind oil; the powder sticks to it. Once you have the prints, use the film to lift the powder; be careful not to smudge. Then you’ll give those back to me.”</p>
<p>Ginny nodded, and Harry set the box on her head. </p>
<p>“You’d better go so that box doesn’t fall. You’ll want to get the fingerprints before they’re ruined by other employees. I’ll be in touch.”</p>
<p>“Room 323,” Ginny said. “Kiss?”</p>
<p>Harry leaned over and kissed her gently so he wouldn’t dislodge the box. “When you’ve got the prints, Floo me.”</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>“You too, Gin. Having fun? Before this, I mean?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Tears filled her eyes. “I’m worried about Hermione.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry too much, love. It’s Hermione. She can take care of herself.”</p>
<p>“I know. Bye, Harry.”</p>
<p>Ginny carefully pulled her head out of the fireplace and removed the fingerprint kit. </p>
<p>“What’s that?” asked Luna, her eyes full of concern. “What did Harry say?”</p>
<p>Ginny took a deep breath and smiled confidently at her friend. “I’ll tell you when I get back. For now, I’ve got work to do.” </p>
