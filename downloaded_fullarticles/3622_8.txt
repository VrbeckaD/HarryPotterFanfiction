<p>041. Mute</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>From across his gilded, ornate Headmaster desk, Dumbledore summons a bag of crystalline lemon drops, offering some of his favorites to his guest.</p>
<p>Snape motions jerkily and with an already <em>sour</em> expression, waving away the enchanted bag rudely.</p>
<p>"A powerful Silencing Curse, you say?"</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyes gleam in amusement as the other man parts his lips, and then turns a brazen red.</p>
<p>After examining the space around Snape with his wand, Dumbledore concludes, "Do not fret, Severus. You'll regain your voice in another day or so. This is an excellent lesson for yourself about observing restraint and <em>listening</em>."</p>
<p>Snape's chair <em>screeches!</em> underneath him, as he storms out of Dumbledore's office, fuming.</p>
<p>"Do see me again soon, Severus," Dumbledore announces gaily. The tips of Snape's ears redden generously.</p>
<p>The shelved items and portraits rattle, when the entrance-door slams.</p>
<p>He picks up a lemon drop from the dusty, grimy floor, popping it into his mouth and sucking it.</p>
<p>
  <em>Delicious.</em>
