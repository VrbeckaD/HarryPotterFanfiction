    <p>An orphanage, that’s where they dropped him off. An eleven-year-old boy sat at the steps of the large building, the orphanage. The boy had black hair and warm gray eyes. In those eyes where angry tears but they were masking his sadness behind the anger and emptiness that he felt inside. His parents dropped him off calling him a disgrace to the family name. However, the boy yelled back at them as they left. They were going to get his stuff for school when he did something that his family calls wrong. All he did was talk to a muggle. You see this boy was magic and like many all magical kids he will go to Hogwarts, but the boy was unsure that he will even go there now. This boy was named Sirius Orion Black the oldest of the Black’s children, but can he call himself a Black now. Sirius looked around and then to his trunk that sat down next to him. “Do I want to go in?” he asked himself however he was glad that he could no longer get hurt by his mother or father but what about his little brother? Sirius sighed as the door opened to a woman in the doorway. She did not see Sirius right away because he was being quiet however when Sirius moved his arm, he let out a sharp cry of pain. This got the woman’s attention.</p><p>“Oh, you poor boy,” she said as she walked over to Sirius who flinched when she held out her hand, however, she did not see this as Sirius stood wincing in pain as he does so, but she still did not see his pain or that he was in pain. Before he was dropped off here his mother wanted him to learn his lesson. Well, at least that’s how she put it. “Come in,” Sirius nodded as he picked up his trunk with his good arm because the other was broken. Sirius then let out another sigh and followed her inside.</p><p>              Sirius looked around the place that will be his new home. he knows that no one will want a Black, let alone the heir. Sirius sighed as he walked up the front desk along with the woman that Sirius does not trust. “I found a boy sitting on the front steps,” the owner of the place looked at Sirius who was looking at the floor, not looking at him.</p><p>“What’s his name?  Is he is magic or a muggle?” Sirius looked at the man now. Sirius was confused when he did not have a stern look in his eyes like his father, but a nice kind look in them.</p><p>“I’m magic. Pure-blood,” Sirius said in a quiet voice that sounded formal and not like an eleven-year-old.</p><p>“And your name?” he asked Sirius who was looking at the floor again.  Sirius, however, winced slightly at his arm when he tried to put it behind his back. The owner saw this and asked:</p><p>“Are you hurt?” Sirius nodded fearing that if he did not say anything he will get hurt more.  “Well, come with me, young man. how old are you?” he asked as Sirius walked over to him. Sirius sighed and said:</p><p>“Eleven. I got my letter yesterday. I was supposed to…………” Sirius cut off as he sighed and muttered under his breath, but no one heard him. </p><p>“I understand, don’t worry when you get healed you and the other eleven-year old’s will go get your stuff. You said you are a pure-blood? Do you still have access to your vault?” Sirius nodded slowly with a smirk, but he did not see it.  “I’m Nick by the way. Do you want to tell me your name? or do you have trust issues?” Sirius sighed and nodded.</p><p>“I do,” Sirius said bluntly as he winced at his arm again. Nick nodded as he led Sirius into the medical wing.</p><p>              Remus John Lupin sighed as he woke from another full moon sleep. Remus was the same age of Sirius, but Sirius was older by a year. Remus looked to the door when it opened. Nick walked in with another boy behind him. Remus looked at him, he looked scared just like every kid that walks in this place when they realize that their family does not want them anymore. Remus never had that feeling because his parents died only a year ago. “Hello, Mr. Lupin. How are you doing?” Remus smiled a little, but he did not say anything as he could not find his voice at the moment. “This boy will be with you for the time being. He has some trust issues maybe you can get him to tell you his name,” Remus nodded as the boy sat down on the bed as the nurse came out to check on him. Remus, however, felt tired again while he listened to the nurse talks to the boy with black hair. Remus was asleep a few seconds later.</p><p>              “This boy was tortured. Who did this to you?” Sirius sighed and looked at the nurse.</p><p>“My mother and father,” Sirius said with a dry humorless laugh and looked over to Remus who was asleep now.</p><p>“Your mother and father did this?” Sirius let out another humorless laugh and winced at his arm.  “And your arm?” Nick added Sirius sighed.</p><p>“My little brother pushed me down the stairs two days ago. Long story,” Sirius sighed and looked at Nick who nodded.</p><p>“I know you don’t want to because you don’t trust us, but can you tell us your name now.” Sirius sighed and nodded.</p><p>“Fine but I don’t think you’ll like me if I say it. My name is Sirius Orion Black,” Sirius said with a sigh as he looked back to Remus who was still asleep. Nick and the nurse nodded but they did not say anything.</p><p>“Well, you are not like your family, are you?” Sirius was shocked by this as he looked at Nick sharply however Sirius did not say anything all he did was nod and sighed.  Nick nodded and sighed also. “Why don’t you get some sleep alright,” Sirius nodded slowly and laid down wincing at his arm. Nick watched as Sirius closed his eyes and fell asleep in seconds.</p><p>“Poor boy,” the nurse said as she walked over to Remus who was still asleep now.  </p><p>“Yes. I’m going to get Mr. Lupin’s room ready when he wakes up,” the nurse nodded and looked over Remus when Nick left the room.</p><p>“You both will find a home. I know it,” she whispered before she went into her own room leaving the boys to sleep.</p>
