    <p>
  <span>Theseus didn’t let Leta say anything. He could see from the way she walked, she was already half asleep. It was obvious that she only stayed awake because she was being stubborn. Leta kept insisting that she could go to the car by herself but she almost missed a step when they descended the stairs which only made him think that enough was enough and swooped her into his arms. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Theseus!” She yelled half-heartedly. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You are still sick and I can tell your tired, Leta,” Theseus rolled his eyes, almost annoyed at his wife. “You still have a fever and just because you’ve had medicine doesn’t mean you will heal instantly. Don’t fight off the effect of medicine anymore. Just rest, darling.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I guess…..” Leta mumbled, eyes already drooping. “I just want to reach the car by myself at least…. So you won’t be inconvenienced by me.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“There is no inconvenience when it comes to taking care of my wife, Leta.” Theseus replied. He kissed her forehead loving as he adjusted her in his arms. “Sleep, I will be there when you wake up.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Not missing a beat, Leta settled her head closer to his shoulder and her breathing evened out as she drifted off. Theseus smiled, satisfied that Leta had finally stopped being stubborn and let herself be taken care of. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As Theseus left a hallway and walked into to the hospital lobby he could hear the whispers behind his back. Whether it was from nurses or patients he couldn’t tell, but there was no subtlety in their whisperings; he could hear every word clearly. He was not sure why they needed to talk about him and his wife; was it really so strange for a man to carry his wife out of the hospital and to the car? He guessed people were just bored. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus quickened his pace so he could get away from the prying eyes and hurriedly went to the car park. Adjusting his holds on Leta, he pulled his car key out and swiftly unlocked the car. Somehow he managed to manoeuvre the passenger side door open and very carefully, he placed Leta gently in the seat. Leta grunted in her sleep and Theseus couldn’t help but chuckles, shaking his head fondly. He took a blanket and pillow from the backseat, adjusting the pillow behind her head, tightening her jackets and tucking her with the blankets. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus put his hand on her forehead and checked her temperature. A smile appeared on his face, satisfied that it was already beginning to drop. Carefully shutting Leta’s door, he walked around to the driver side, more than ready to leave the car park and go home. He just wanted Leta to rest more comfortably. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Unfortunately, they got stuck in a traffic jam on the way home. Frustrated, Theseus hit the wheel lightly, trying not to wake Leta. He leaned back and let out a long sigh. He could see that they were going to be stuck for a while, which annoyed him. This was going to suck. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus glanced at Leta’s sleeping form. She coughed lightly in her sleep but overall looked peaceful. He frowned at the dark circle under her eyes. They were much too dark for his liking. He really had to talk to Travers about overworking her. Travers might be his boss but he couldn’t just let the man overwork his wife just because Leta was his secretary.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus bit his lip, worried. Leta usually never worked to the point where she would get sick. He knew that it was usually himself that got sick from working himself to the bone. Leta had called him a walking disaster, especially when he had projects to handle or deadlines to meet. He would always forget to eat or was badly sleep deprived. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But Leta was always the one who took care of herself. So it had been surprising to wake up and find her with fever. According to the doctor, she was over-exhausted. The doctor told him to make sure she didn’t go to work until she was recovered and make sure she slept well. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus slipped a loose strand of hair behind her ear, in an attempt to keep it from falling in front of her face. She looked so peaceful that he couldn’t help but feel tempted to pull his phone and snap a photo of her. He resisted, but the fact they were trapped in a traffic jam and were moving so slowly made Theseus’ hand itch with wanting to take at least one photo. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After mentally debating with himself, he finally decided to do it. Just one photo, he convinced himself. With one swift move, he snapped a photo of her. A smile tugged at his lips as he looked at the photo. Not only was it clear, but Leta looked both peaceful and cute. It was as if the weight of the world had been taken from her shoulders and it made her look considerably younger. He had to bite his cheek to repress the hearty laugh that bubbled in him, worried that it could wake her up. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It took some time but eventually, they finally pulled into the car park of their flat. Theseus let out a sigh of relief. It had been driving him insane to be stuck for so long in the traffic jam. The drive between their flat and the hospital normally only took 30 minutes, but this time it had been 2 hours and he had gone a bit stir crazy. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus slipped out from the driver seat and closed the door carefully. He walked around to the passenger side and opened the door. He shook Leta’s shoulders gently. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Leta, darling, time to wake up.” Theseus whispered. Leta blinked sleepily at him, not yet registering where she was. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Thes…? What....?” She muttered, her voice heavy with exhaustion. She tried to rub the sleep from her eyes and Theseus chuckled. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re home. C’mon, just a little bit further and you can go to sleep in the bed.” Theseus told her, offering his right hand. She pushed away from the blanket and took his hand, swinging her legs out of the car. He helped her to stand, reaching out and holding her as she stumbled. “Oops, easy sweetheart.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I am sorry, Thes.” She apologised. She tried to stifle her yawn but to no avail, she let out a pretty big one. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus chuckled and caressed her cheeks. She still felt rather warm. “Nothing to apologise for, Leta. You are still pretty warm and you look very tired. Sleeping in the car for long periods of time isn’t the best idea when you’ve got a warm bed upstairs.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You are right,” She affirmed while massaging her neck. “It was pretty uncomfortable. Definitely not recommended.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know,” He kissed her temple and began to lead her inside. “Time to go home and give you a chance to rest properly.” Theseus kept a gentle hold on her as he led her upstairs. she was still rather sleepy and looked like she would fall asleep the second her head hit the pillow. Leta grumbled that the lift was too long. He could agree with that; It did feel too long. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus immediately brought her to their room but told her to not sleep yet; she still had to eat something. He took her pyjama from their wardrobe and handed them to her as he left to reheat the soup he made this morning. He filled a glass with hot water and put it on the tray. After a bit, the glass of water was joined by a spoon and a bowl of soup. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus brought the trays back to their room and smiled as he saw Leta was trying to stay awake. He put the tray on the nightstand and then sat down on the bed next to her. He caressed Leta’s forehead. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Too sleepy?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mhhmm…..” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, just sleep for now. I will reheat the soup again later.” Theseus replied. He kissed her forehead gently before standing up. He was about to leave when Leta caught his wrist. He raised one of his eyebrows, asking her an unspoken question.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s just- I am sorry and thank you, Thes.” Leta said. Theseus stared at her for a beat and then flick her forehead lightly. She yelped, her voice hoarse. “Thes!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Stop apologising. I am going to take care of you because I am your husband. A husband wants to take care of his wife and will do whatever he can to help.” He pointed out. “Also, remember what I said when I proposed? We are a team and that means we will always be there for each other, especially when you need me like this. You are always looking out for me, so really Leta. There is nothing to apologise about.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus gave her a big grin,  one that stretched from ear to ear. Leta smiled back and nodded. She tugged his hand, Leta asking him a simple question before he could say anything else. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Please stay with me until I sleep.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theseus was surprised but nodded. He sat back down on the bedside and helped her settle under the covers. Leta's hand was still holding his hand tightly. He caressed her the back of it lovingly with his thumb, lulling her to sleep. It didn't take long for Leta to fall asleep, but even though he could leave, he didn’t want to. Leta's hand was still wrapped around his and he wasn’t willing to pull away. A thought flashed on his mind as he stared at their joined hands and a smile found its way on his face.</span>
