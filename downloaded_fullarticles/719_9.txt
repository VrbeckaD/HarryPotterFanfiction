    <p>Harry jerked awake with a gasp, and coughed, blood and dirt mixing on his tongue. He sat up with great care, wincing as his ribs ground together. <em>Shit! How long was I out?</em> He searched for the sounds of battle; screams, spells, crashing. But all was silent. He staggered to his feet, clutching his wand in his unbroken hand, and looked around.</p>
<p>“Oh Merlin,” Harry moaned in despair, shuddering sobs coming up to choke him. He stumbled forward, unable to believe what he was seeing.</p>
<p>His friends.</p>
<p>His home.</p>
<p>Her presence was no longer in his mind. Hogwarts was no more.</p>
<p>Broken bodies lay among the ruins of Hogwarts castle, slumped in twisted parodies of sleep, or else contorted in the terror of the dead and dying. Harry saw a small first year, curled around another, older student. Her eyes were bulging and accusing as Harry took shaky steps forward. His shoe brushed white, luminous hair, and he looked down. Luna lay at his feet, her eyes closed and a smile curled peacefully on her face. Harry made to scream, but all he managed was a whimper. He sank to his knees. <em>Not you too. </em></p>
<p>
  <em>It’s gone. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>It’s all gone. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>It’s over.</em>
</p>
<p>Harry let out a dry chuckle, feeling relief course through him despite the grief and pain. <em>It’s over.</em></p>
<p>A flash of flame alerted him to the presence of another, and he turned to see Fawkes swooping towards him, surveying the carnage.</p>
<p><em>This isn’t true,</em> he sung sadly. <em>This was not what I foresaw- This isn’t true!</em> He let out a screech and settled on Harry’s knee.</p>
<p>“I know,” Harry replied numbly, still staring at Luna. “I wish I could save them, I wish I could’ve-” a picture of Ron burning alive in the Burrow flashed through his mind- “could’ve done something-”</p>
<p><em>That’s it!</em> Fawkes trilled, flame bursting forth from his feathers. Harry stared at him in a mix of bewilderment and anger, but Fawkes continued uninterrupted. <em>A wish! I can grant one wish in my lifetime! It might work!</em></p>
<p>“You-you can bring them back?” Harry asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>
  <em>No. Not even I can do that. But I can send you back in time to your younger body. </em>
</p>
<p>“You-” Harry gulped, gazing around at the devastation. He sighed. “Do it.”</p>
<p><em>Are you sure?</em> Fawkes sung cautiously, fluttering his wings. <em>There could be unpredictable changes to the timeline that even I- </em></p>
<p><em>“</em>I’ll do anything to get them back,” Harry fixed his desperate gaze on Fawkes, who flinched back. “Anything to keep them safe. Anything. Do it.”</p>
<p><em>Alright,</em> Fawkes agreed, looking resigned.<em> Grab my tail feathers and hold on tight. This is gonna hurt like hell.</em> Fawkes let out a screech of defiance, and Harry screamed as fire burned through him like paper. Then the world dissolved, and they both disappeared in a flash of pure white flame.</p>
