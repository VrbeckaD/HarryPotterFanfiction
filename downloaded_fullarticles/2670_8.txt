    <p>Harry hurried up the creaking stairs and into his own room, quickly packing everything in sight into the feather-light bag that was charmed to add more space and weight. Everything he saw, he packed. Their clothes, toiletries, everything. He took extra care in packing his child's food, milk and necessities. The toys and books shrunken into the bag before picking his child up from the bed. Eyes softening as he looked around the bare room before hurrying out the door.</p><p>He had twenty minutes at most to get out of Grimmauld place before The Order arrived for their weekly meeting. Oh, the house wasn't completely empty, there was Hermione who was most likely in the Library and the twins up in the attic to test their products in relative peace. Mundungus who was chosen to stay guard in the house (along with Tonks) was in a drunken stupor whilst the pink haired woman was off entertaining Ginny. It was obvious they avoided Harry like the plague, their eyes always suspicious whilst he walked along the floors of Number 12.</p><p>The teenager hurried quietly along the second floor corridor before slinking into the small staircase that led directly to the kitchen. His heart pacing rapidly as he struggled not to make noise to alert anyone what he was doing. Cradling his son closely to his chest as he breathed slowly into the blanket. He wasn't sure if both Kreacher and Dobby had finished packing the valuables in the house – they also had to do this quietly and without making it seem the house was 'off' at first glance. The money would come in use after he had finished selling the knick knacks to a pawn shop – or whatever the magical equivalent to that was anyway. It was also why he put Kreacher in charge, it was easier to take if the elf deemed them worthless in the eyes of a Black but good enough to sell– of course the most valuable will be kept permanently in Harry's possession. He felt a little guilty that he was essentially robbing his godfather but after a year of harsh and bitter treatment from everyone in the house, he could say that this was a little like revenge.</p><p>He spotted Dobby out of the corner of his eyes, the little creature casually making its way to the Living room in which Mundungus sat and in all probability unaware of the going ons around him. No matter – it will be easier to put him to sleep with no questions asked. As soon as Dobby gave him the thumbs up he bolted towards the foyer, his bag hitting heavily against his back as he reached for the door.</p><p>"Going somewhere little lord?"</p><p>Harry spun around, his heart hammering as he nearly dislodged his baby, calming slightly as the portrait of Walburga Black was unveiled. Her ugly features twisted into a mocking sneer as she assessed him. He narrowed his eyes at her and opened his mouth to speak- what he doesn't know - before he was cut off,</p><p>"It is best if I do not know Potter. That old coot will be arriving sooner than thought."</p><p>She beckoned him closer and despite his reservations he did so, his head leaning closer to the portrait whilst his eyes quickly glanced at the staircase,</p><p>"Closer my dear,"</p><p>He huffed whilst he reluctantly stood right in front of the large painting, his head leaning closer as the woman began to whisper,</p><p>"I suggest Mr Potter, that as soon as you leave my front door you apparate directly to Gringotts – the goblins have been informed of the changes necessary. Give the babe to the elf– it is best if you are separated whilst you hid-</p><p>A load thump vibrated on the ceiling, The black matriarch simply raised an eyebrow at the ceiling, a mere second passed before she fixed her gaze on the 17 year old,</p><p>"I do hope you do not plan to abandon my library, I have ordered that wretched creature to take a few for now,"</p><p>"I thought you'd be more angry at me robbing your stuff?"</p><p>She smirked a him, her eyes still cruel and cold as she - did you really think I did not know what you were up to for the past five months – this is <em>my</em> house, I would rather you take everything of value that belongs in my name lest it be thrown out by Dumbledore bands of blood traitors and mudbloods. My only request is that you keep it safe. They are precious heirlooms passed down for centuries, and it will remain that way."</p><p>He understood immediately what she wanted</p><p>"You want it all to go to Voldem-"</p><p>"-Do not speak the name child!" The woman all but hissed, her eyes darting fearfully at her front door. "You are by all intents and purposes bound to the dark lord. The babe is the only reason in which I am prepared to give you the blessings of being heir to-</p><p>"Blessing of being heir?! I don't-"</p><p>"-I will not let the reputation of the most Ancient and Noble house of Black be tarnished by that no-good son of mine." her expression turned bitter and an ugly look adorned her face before it was cleared,</p><p>"I hope for Regulus sake that you will keep your babe safe whilst evading The Order Mr Potter, they will be looking for you. Though it was you who vanquished Our Lord I hope your newborn is a symbol of the victory the dark will finally show."</p><p>A rather put off expression appeared on Harry's face but before he could say anything he was once again cut off.</p><p>"You are the bearer of the Dark Lord son. He will find you to make claim." It was almost as if she could read his mind as Walburga cut across Harry again, "This is the wizarding world boy! The world revolves around all men, the fathers and the heads of house, a mother is merely a reflection of a good house, nothing more – you do not have a choice of stance in this war." An ugly sneer formed again and Harry thought best to keep his thoughts on his neutral stance silent, though judging from Walburga's expression she vehemently disagreed with what she had just said. She assessed the teenager again, seemingly in thought before speaking abruptly,</p><p>"Ask Kreacher to give you a vial of my blood, it will be sufficient for Gringotts to formally move the accounts. Ah, dear Phineas has just informed me that The Order is prepared to leave the office, I believe it is now time for you to go." Walburga gave a departing sniff before walking out of her portrait. The black curtains closing swiftly after her.</p><p>All Harry could do was stare cluelessly for a second, his mind going overdrive at the though of being the black hair for the sole purpose of having a black at the Voldemort's army of death eaters. He huffed a little before checking on bundle in his arms, the baby was still asleep despite all the running around though Harry could bet on his luck that he will probably awake at the worst time possible.</p><p>"Harry potter sirs, we needs be going now," Dobby nervously looked around, his ears perking up straight as he picked up the sounds of Grimmauld Place,</p><p>"Right, right Dobby, erm, could you let Kreacher know to meet us at-" Harry faltered, he doesn't even have a clue on where to go first,</p><p>"Perhaps sirs should go where mistress wants…"</p><p>"Gringotts?"</p><p>Dobby nodded rapidly, "Dobby could take you but, its not good for baby." Harry supposed that if apparating with an elf was anything like floo powder or portkey travelling, it might just be safer to go on foot. Harry signed at this before squaring his shoulders,</p><p>"Right. We really don't have time for this, we're just going to have to walk it to the Leaky Cauldron– or catch the bus to London."</p><p>And with that he opened the door to Number 12 and made his way to freedom – or well, what's left of it anyway. He was absolutely under no delusions that he will be a wanted man after this – from both Voldemort and Dumbledore. It's just a matter of hiding out of sight, Keeping his baby safe from any crossfires and raising his son away from the upcoming war.</p>
