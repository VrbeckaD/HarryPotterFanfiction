    <p>XxXxX<br/>
Prologue<br/>
XxXxX</p><p>There are many stories and legends in the North. </p><p>One of the most widespread is that of the Lord of Life, and though few seem to actually share the story everyone somehow knows it. No matter what changes come to the land the story persists, constantly shifting, constantly growing, as with all things alive.</p><p>One path that the story passes is from the Head of the House Stark to their Heirs. Their version of the story has stayed truer, though as all stories oft repeated in many voices it bears many differences from the actual truth of the tale. It also bears an element that many other versions of the story do not.</p><p>This is the version of the story that Lord Eddard Stark told all his children, including his bastard, Jon, but excluding his adopted-in-all-but-name hostage Theon Greyjoy. Thankfully, it will be passed to you minus all of their innumerable questions.</p><p>He, as many Starks before him, would take each child as they reached the age to begin learning their duties on a walk through the catacombs of Winterfell, down to the most bottom depths, having them recite the stories of the Starks they passed. Then, in the end, would reveal to them a great door hidden behind a particular outcropping in the darkest corner. This door would not have been out of place in the Great Hall of the Red Keep, the most massive and impressive castle in all of Westeros. Indeed, it was not a door so much as a wall in and of itself, locked with an ingenious mechanism in the sigil of a direwolf howling to a full moon. </p><p>Then, in front of this great, locked door at the heart of many thousands of years of history, amidst the remains of the generations of noble Starks, Lord Stark would tell them what his Father told him. </p><p>Once, in the time before the first men, there was a great warrior and priest of the Old Gods when they were still new, a Lord of Life, a Truth Seer who could divine the hearts of men at a glance. Though he was but a child not yet come into his own, he nevertheless led the people against the tyranny of an Evil Usurper who tried to steal the Throne from his King. The Evil Usurper, whose name must never be spoken, was madder than any seen before or since, and used dark, vile magics to torture and maim people in ways that good children should not even try to imagine.</p><p>This Lord of Life defeated the Evil Usurper using his Truth Seeing and the magic of Life itself learned from the Old Gods, and some say that the first weirwood tree grew on the spot of that victory. </p><p>On the eve of his triumph, as he bent his knee to his King, the Lord of Life received a vision from his Truth Seeing, one which showed the danger of the First Winter to come. The King’s court grew suspicious of the timing, as the Lord warned of many follies that would be made in dealing with the First Winter and the terrors to come.</p><p>The Lord of Life stood strong against their fear and moved to protect the people. </p><p>With a resolution not seen since, he prepared for winter. </p><p>The King, his soul poisoned by his court that had grown corrupt in their fear, was further twisted by the remnants of the Evil Usurpers followers that had escaped justice, and demanded that the warrior magically swear his very soul to the obedience of the crown. The Lord, disgusted by the court and recognizing the King was not himself, swore instead to the protection of the people.</p><p>The Lord then called his followers, from nature itself in the form of great direwolves that towered over men to the simplest of serfs who held their lord dear. Some even say the Children of the Forest came to his banner, while others speak of death in human form that joined the Lord in battle for the soul of his King against the Corrupt Court.</p><p>In the end the Lord was victorious once more, and the King saw the truth of the whole ordeal. This truth came too late, though, for the Lord had been wounded gravely in the fight. The King, despairing over the soon-to-be-death of his most faithful, wept on his throne while cradling the Lord’s fast failing body, and the true members of the court joined him. The Lord of Life, ever kind and honorable, comforted the King and his followers, in that all was not lost, and that he would live so long as the people did, and the King should protect the people in his name to fulfil the oath he took.</p><p>The King and the Court swore an oath on the spot to do just that. They swore not just themselves but their whole lines from that day forth until the end of time. For none of them would forget that the Lord watched them through their people, and would hold them to account. The Gods themselves bowed to the power and strength of that promise, and in their awe at the sacrifice of the Lord, and the true conviction of the King and the Court, caused all the tears wept in the name of the Lord to freeze. The Lord’s body was thus encased in a tomb of ice that never melts as a reminder of the sacrifices one might be called to make in the name of the King and the people.</p><p>Legend held that that body of the Lord of Life, it’s visage that of a boy barely old enough to truly live, covered in ice that does not rested behind a door, hidden by the ages where it waited for the day that the Lords of the North needed a reminder of why they fought for the people.</p><p>The Starks, by their honor, even in the face of dragons that forced them to bend a knee, upheld their oaths to keep that door, this door in fact, hidden. For as guardians of the people, it was their job to open the doors, if that reminder was ever required. </p><p>That reminder had never been needed though, as the King and all the Lords held true to the Promise, and their lines all still fight to this day. And though some have forgotten the details, they still live by the heart of that promise. </p><p>Finally, once the story ended, he would turn to each child and say:</p><p>“And this children, this is the promise. </p><p>We will stay strong, we will stay true, for the people, for Winter is Coming.”</p><p>XxXxX<br/>
Chapter One<br/>
XxXxX</p><p>The night was nearly half over, dark and deep save for the white sliver of a waning moon overhead. The newly arrived royal guests of the House of Stark had all retired to their beds. All slept now in Winterfell, save the Queen’s younger brother who remained awake and reading in his rooms just as the Lady Catelyn Stark warned would happen. The Lord of the House of Stark, Eddard “Ned” Stark, sat in the family catacombs staring at the carved visage of his sister. She was the woman in whose name the Targaryen royal dynasty was brought low by the very King now asleep in Ned’s guest house in the arms of several of his serving maids. The feather King Robert Baratheon had brought to show his respects lay stiff and still, a touch of brown and bronze where it lay cradled in her stone hand.</p><p>Earlier, Ned had felt an urge to take the frail thing and grind it to dust beneath his boot, though he didn’t as he knew it had been offered as honorably as Robert could manage.</p><p>In truth he had so much to consider that the feather seemed such a small trifle when he started thinking it all though. With Robert’s proposals both for Ned to take the position down in King’s Landing at the Red Keep as the King’s Hand, and for Sansa, his precious, naive Sansa, to marry Prince Joffery, he had a thousand possible outcomes spinning through his mind. If he was being upfront about his current stance on the matters, Ned couldn’t say even to himself which answer he should give to either proposition, for all Sansa had begged of her Mother to influence him to say yes.</p><p>There was a reason, well, more than one reason, that he had stayed North and avoided King’s Landing though his old friend sat on the throne.</p><p>Even now with so many more reasons staked on the side that Ned should go to defend the man… The death of the former King’s Hand Jon Arryn, so suspicious already without counting the hurried missive from his wife, who he would have heard out even had she not been Catelyn’s sister. Though truthfully the woman barely wrote Cate, and was full of ill news or snide gossip when she did, so there was something about it that he wasn’t sure of. It smacked of intrigue at the very least. An intrigue that kept him up even though his wife had long returned to bed. </p><p>Ned would normally carefully consider all his options before making any type of decision, and this decision with all it led to he was giving more thought than ever, for there would be heavy consequences any choice he made. </p><p>There was only so far the friendship of a King would go if denied, especially a man like Robert, who for all that he was a good friend, had long been ruled by immediate desires and snap judgements that he held like they were truths from the gods. </p><p>But the risk in accepting was high as well to say the least. Especially as he was not one for pretenses or airs or pretty words, and would be landing himself and his family in a viper’s nest of people that had cut their teeth on such things. </p><p>Frankly, he was pissed at his friend for even considering this as Robert damn well knew his thoughts on the Southern Courts and King’s Landing in particular. He was far more at home in the North where one could focus on what mattered most, as most Northerners were rational and practical people in comparison to the Southern Lords and Ladies.</p><p>Ned, like any sane person, didn’t want to sit on or near a damn Throne. Gods curse it, the only reason he was Lord was because his brother died and he did his duty as a Stark was meant to do. </p><p>His family had given enough to the power plays of the South. </p><p>So much loss his family had suffered, all for the benefit of others who cared about little but themselves. </p><p>It seemed so often that it was a thankless sacrifice, and that was fine more often than not. </p><p>It was the price they paid for their place. </p><p>Yet these choices he made now would not just impact him, even more than any other they would impact the whole of the North. They would impact his family in very dear and personal ways when they had already given so much. </p><p>For he had raised his children well, so while there would be some complaints, especially from Arya if she had to go south and deal with the court’s expectations of a Lady, his children would all do their honor bound duties. </p><p>And in that, something struck him. Maybe it had been a stray thought, or some other wyrd, but in flash of insight, he felt a deep, all consuming urge to move. </p><p>He stood and, almost in a trance like state, walked forward, heading to the deepest depths of the catacombs. He passed all his ancestors of the old, main lines, favored brothers and cousins, heroes and peacekeepers the lot. Rare was the coward in House Stark, and none were buried here. For Starks were the Protectors of the North, and no one that ran when the people needed defending deserved a spot of honor in the catacombs. </p><p>There, hidden in the deepest cave, one that had little tool work and no candles already lit by the servants charged with tending the tombs, was the door. The door that had been popping up in his thoughts so often lately, especially with his old friend come calling on favors and now word of the Lannisters’ possible betrayal. Gods help him… The Lannisters... The Queen and the Kingslayer and the Imp and their Gods be damned father Tywin who had wiped out whole families. </p><p>Should he say yay or nay to the two propositions Robert had laid at his feet, so many things could go wrong his mind wouldn’t stop spinning horrible visions of the sacrifices he and his family would be making.</p><p>Ned went back to the relatively more trodden paths of the catacombs and took a candle from a sconce, returning to the chamber holding the door, and with care he lit the line of oil ringing the room in a cleverly carved canal that he’d tended to himself.</p><p>The room burst into light, displaying the door in all its dark glory. </p><p>Robert had always laughed at the stories and legends Ned shared from the North, especially this one once he’d wheedled it out of Ned when he had been deeper than normal in his cups (though he had at least managed to not mention the damn door itself to the man who might well have wanted to find it and knock it down with his damned warhammer just to see what lay behind it). </p><p>Because this truth was a deep truth, and while they never named it to any but their blood, guarding this door was one of the duties of the Starks. He sometimes suspected that that was why it was in the catacombs. Indeed the thought that the Starks had started burying their dead by it as more incentive to fight for it had crossed his mind more than once.</p><p>Why they protected it, no one knew for certain these days. </p><p>For while his Father and he had, and his children would, he supposed, pass down that this was the tomb of the Lord of Life, who gave his life to save the people of Westeros, it could honestly be a tomb of the first Starks, or other heroes of the First Men from before the Valayrians or the Andals came calling. He snorted, it could even be empty.</p><p>Honestly no one knew for certain these days, though the Starks still did their duty and guarded the door with the rest of the crypts. </p><p>“Father?” Ned turned in surprise at the sound to find both Robb and Jon hovering behind him hesitatingly, their direwolf pups at their feet. Robb was still mostly dressed in his best from the feast in the King’s honor earlier that night, though he’d picked up a set of arms since Ned had last seen him, and Jon was in training clothes and had one of his practice swords strapped to his waist. </p><p>Both had the chill of night air still emanating from them. </p><p>After seeing Arya and Bran off to be tucked into bed like Rickon had been earlier like the dutiful oldest sibling he was, Robb had probably hunted down where Jon was hiding in the yard during the feast. They had likely stayed up talking as was often the case when either of them were struggling with something. </p><p>Or when they just felt like it, as it was oft remarked to him (outside of Cate’s hearing, for she would turn colder than the ice of the Wall at any hint people considered his bastard Jon in the same thought as his true born heir Robb) that the boys were closer than twins sometimes. </p><p>Gods, his boys. </p><p>He’d always meant to leave his children a better world then he had received, but circumstances now threatened all of that. An acceptance would drag them into the dangers of the court made worse with accusations of murder being bandied about, and a denial risked drawing the wrath of vengeful king.</p><p>All his children deserved so much better.</p><p>Especially his oldest boys, both cursed by duty in their own different ways. Even now as they stood before him, their eyes were, not odd, but wide with an almost identical lost look that carved something deep in his heart.</p><p>Truthfully in the low light, the slight differences between the boys were nearly negligible, though Robb definitely had the taller, bulkier build. The redder color of Robb’s hair and the deep black of Jon’s blended equally well into the warm oil light of the door chamber. Even the differences between their pups was hard to tell, though Ghost normally stood out like a sore thumb with his pure white fur. He almost snorted at the thought that his children’s direwolves were much alike them in looks, what with the way that Ghost could be easily picked out from his siblings like Jon from the rest of Ned’s children. Though really Arya’s hair was darkening to the point she’d be showing more of Ned’s Northern coloring than Catelyn’s Southern Tully coloring soon. </p><p>Gods was she starting to look like Lyanna. </p><p>He shook his head, bringing himself back to the present. “What are you two doing down here, boys?” they glanced at each other, but Ned could easily tell that they obviously had no further answer then he for why the door plagued his thoughts this eve. Perhaps they had even felt that same call to the door as he had, minutes ago. </p><p>With a sigh he turned and faced the haunting door once more. The door, for all it appeared plain at first glance, was a dark black stone, inscribed with runes and words that were close to Old Valyarian, but were untranslatable by Ned’s work. He thought little of the fact he had never quite been able to bring a Maester or other scholar down here to check, or even sent snippets of the writing out, as for some reason he’d never even brought Cate down here like he had the children. It had never seemed right to let anyone besides blood family actually see the door. </p><p>Whether the door lead to the tomb of an early Stark long forgotten, or a warrior of legend, it would do little to help his current predicament to stay here gazing at it like a fool. No matter how meditative the firelight dancing on the door seemed. Still the oddness of his and his boys being drawn here was something to consider. Ned hesitatingly reached out and trailed his hand along the seam at the center of the door. There was a lock in the middle, an intricate piece of metal and stone work that was shaped in the form of a direwolf, howling at the moon. He’d never even tried to figure out how to undo it, even as he tried to decipher the writings around it. </p><p>There had always been something that made him shy from the lock and what it might reveal. Now though, now that familiar nagging to not touch had vanished. In fact he could swear it almost seemed as if it had called – was still calling --him. As if the lock itself drew his fingers down the tight fitted crack of the door only to stop as soon as they touched the carving. </p><p>The moment his fingers brushed over the head of the direwolf, the creature’s entire form shifted, twisting faster than Ned could pull back from in his absolutely flabbergasted surprise, and sank its sharp teeth into his hand. Given the sheer absurdity of the situation, he was not quite afraid to admit that he shouted in shock, and was so focused on trying to free his fingers from the living lock that he had nearly forgotten about his boys who loyally ran to his side.</p><p>The direwolf was a fairly large carving of dark metal, and its bite easily swallowed three of his fingers. Yanking proved unsuccessful in freeing himself, and the creature actually seemed to growl and settle on its haunches, as if it simply refused to release him. </p><p>“What in the Seven Hells?” Robb snapped, and Jon made an equally confused noise, making Ned feel just a bit better at the thought of not being entirely crazy and having others see the statue move. The confusion and oddness of the moment was not helped by Ghost and Grey Wind’s barked growls and snarls at their carven kin.</p><p>Jon, before Ned could try and stop him stuck his own fingers into the direwolf’s mouth to try and unclench the jaw, not giving up even as he cut his fingers on the thing’s sharp teeth. Robb tried a more direct approach, smashing the hilt of his sword against the stone above where Ned’s fingers disappeared inside the thing, only to have the creature shift, drawing a pained hiss from Ned and a cringe from Jon. One of the thing’s paws managed to lift off the door and swing at Robb, its razor claws drawing blood from Robb’s ungloved hand. </p><p>Almost as soon as his son’s blood coated the claws of the beast, it suddenly released its hold on Ned, causing him to fall back to the ground from the force he had been applying to try and tug himself free.</p><p>Both boys immediately dropped to his side, though Robb, with his weapon already drawn, stayed kneeling, pointing the blade at the carven direwolf on the off chance it could fully move from the lock on the door. The beast, though, merely shifted further before crouching down and leaping over the moon on the lock, somehow vanishing back into the door itself. </p><p>Ned blinked.  </p><p>As soon as the wolf fully disappeared, the moon moved, turning as if rushing through the phases of the true moon, and as soon as the once full moon had reached the equivalent of a new moon, the doors creaked and shuddered. A powdering of dust fell towards them as the doors shifted, slowly swinging wide open and leaving a dark, gaping chasm before them. </p><p>“What in the Seven Hells?” Robb asked again, this time quieter, truly questioning rather than cursing. Both pups were growling low from where they crouched hunched at his boys’ feet, making the whole thing feel all the more surreal. </p><p>Ned turned from the dark nothingness now revealed to staunch the flow of blood from his fingers as best he could, Jon assisting by ripping a strip from his tunic and wrapping the deep punctures. It was well done, a solid field dressing, and Ned spared the boy a smile and nod of thanks. Jon’s eyes lit and he quickly helped Ned stand when he moved. </p><p>Immediate concerns handled, he turned back to the sight that had not been seen by man (at least to his knowledge) in thousands of years.</p><p>It was too much to resist, even for his normally cautious self. </p><p>Ned moved so he stood right before the hanging doors. He took a deep breath, bracing himself for what he might find. The air emanating from the newly opened space smelled surprisingly fresh and not at all stale like he imagined would come from a place that had been closed off as long. He carefully took a step forward, and as soon as his foot touched down past the threshold, the ring of oil round the walls of the door chamber seemed to spread through the walls themselves into the darkness, lighting an identical ring in the new room as well. The light was not nearly as much as in the room before the doors, but it caught on something, made if sparkle. </p><p>Even more so now, this felt like an exceedingly stupid thing to do, but Ned needed to look. </p><p>He warily took a few more steps forward. </p><p>“Father!” his boys cried in unison, and Ned turned to look at them. They remained outside the door for the moment, both their faces were uneasy, though they almost hid it in a maintained Stark resolve. They were both growing up so fine, he would do almost anything really to make it so that it was his generation that paid the price he could feel was about to come due.</p><p>He somehow knew they would follow and so he turned back to the chamber, ever so carefully moving further into the room in the direction of the sparkles. The lights sprung higher, and the room, the tomb, burst into a bright light, though he could not quite make out the source.</p><p>The sparkle that had caught in the dim light now burst with color, to the point nearly blinded him. The next instant, the light of the room began to settle, slowly, carefully, reaching a level where one could still see at but did not overwhelm. </p><p>The source of the sparkles was better revealed and his breath caught. </p><p>There, at the top of a short series of steps, stood a giant crystal in the shape of a multifaceted teardrop. It easily outdid any crown jewel in sheer aesthetics and shone with a deep bluish brilliance that reflected other colors on the edges like the finest of diamonds. In the center of the crystal, kneeling towards the door though with his head held high, was a boy, barely older than Robb and Jon. He had green eyes that glowed like the brightest of emeralds back lit by fire, and his gaze was challenging, fierce. His hair was black and wild, and his clothes, though of a strange cut, still appeared finely made, a mix of leathers and thick, sturdy cloth. </p><p>He didn’t realize that he had gotten closer to the crystal, almost to the point where he could touch it, before his boys grabbed onto him again with desperate hands. Their faces now were openly scared, and he could see the same draw towards the strange trapped boy in them that he felt, though he saw their eyes dance down to all three of their bleeding hands, and their youth show through. The instinctive recoil at the unknown, at the different, that people almost always seemed to pick up as they grew that he had not finished training out of them yet, though they were naturally better than many. Both boys were strong, and he knew quite well that they would continue to do well in that regard as they grew. </p><p>They had kind hearts, his boys. </p><p>He’d sacrifice anything really, to see them become the great men that he knew they would be. </p><p>As if waiting for that cue, the Direwolf from the lock dropped to the upwards facing point of the crystal, and their blood dripped from its claws and fangs to the crystal, and where it landed the crystal gave a huge, heaving crack.</p><p>Ned, with the rare experience of once having seen the sheer sides of the Wall cave, knew that sound, and grabbed both boys and threw them all back from the strange item that was about to come apart.</p><p>They all stared in awe as the crystal slowly started forming more and more cracks until it looked more fragile than a pond holding onto the last vestiges of ice during a thaw. When it seemed no more substantial than a spider web, the crystal split down the center with another resounding crack and a great heave that shook the room. The crystal crumbled away from the form of the kneeling boy, shattering across the floor like a block of low quality ice on stone. The boy dropped from his suspended kneel to crash into the floor, and though he tried to catch himself, his arms failed him, sending him sprawling. </p><p>The figure laid there on the floor for a breath, two, three…</p><p>Then suddenly the arms slid up to brace their hands against the floor, not hesitating even with the crystal shards laid out like small daggers beneath him, and he pushed up. The boy looked around a moment before his sharp green eyes, no longer glowing but still a shocking shade of emerald that would put a Lannister to shame, focused on Ned and his boys. He stared at them almost blankly for a moment, as if trying to recollect something, before he scrambled back a ways, eventually stumbling to his feet. There was a look on his face, not quite fear, but something close, and his hands twitched as if to go for a weapon, but they stayed up, palms up in a gesture of lack of arms. The boy looked them over more thoroughly, eyeing the blade still in Robb’s grip, and the swords strapped to the waists of Ned and Jon. His eyes flew around the room then, as if searching for something and not finding anything that could even remotely be familiar.</p><p>He finally said something, but his tongue was strange, sounding nearly like the Old Tongue but not quite. He stated something again, and a dark look of frustration crossed his face at their lack of response. </p><p>“We don’t understand you,” Robb snapped at his side, Grey Wind yapping to punctuate his sharp statement, and Ned held a hand up to silence him, but it seemed the recently released young man understood the gist of Robb’s statement even if he didn’t know the words. The young man quickly snapped another phrase, and even though Ned didn’t understand it either, it was obviously a different language and he shook his head no on that one almost instinctively. </p><p>This went on for several minutes and a full host of languages before the boy huffed, crossing his arms in a much annoyed fashion, and both Ned’s boys couldn’t help but laugh. Even Ned had to crack a smile at the sheer comical look of the boy, striking a pose so childish that not even Rickon could pull it off (and his youngest was shaping to be a master of manipulating his older siblings… If he wasn’t so sweet, Ned would be worried). The boy eventually smiled in return, and that seemed to relax him enough that he was less on the frustrated defensive, and it put Ned a bit at ease as well, though this entire situation was strange and unbelievable to a large degree.</p><p>“I am sorry, sir, do you perhaps understand what we are saying?” Ned asked, trying Common once more. The boy shrugged, and Ned sighed. He knew a smattering of High and Low Valarian, and a word or two of a few more languages, but he had a hunch as that first language still sounded much like the Old Tongue... </p><p>And though he was hardly fluent… </p><p>“Do you speak in the Old Tongue?” He asked in it, and the boy narrowed his eyes, tilting his head, obviously hearing the same slight sameness that Ned had heard, but ultimately shook his head. </p><p>Finally the boy raised a finger and quickly raised a hand to the air, quickly tracing a few symbols, and Ned’s eyes widened as in the trail of that finger fire followed. Fire that stayed in the air forming words in High Valarian. How about this?</p><p>Ned was almost so shocked by the fire magic that he failed to acknowledge he could at least read High Valarian at least a little, though truthfully it had been years since he had done it regularly. Still he managed a quick nod, but gestured at the first and last word, indicating he only understood those. The boy smiled before poking the words with his finger and they rearranged. Well, that’s a start. Unfortunately Ned didn’t know any of those and shook his head with a sigh. </p><p>Finally the boy pointed at himself, and said a word, “Harry.”</p><p>Ned smiled in return, well, at least his name made sense, he pointed to himself, “Ned.” He gestured and named his boys, “Robb, and Jon,” as well. The boy nodded, finally at least trusting them enough to settle fully out of his defensive stance and actually start to really look around the tomb room, though he was obviously quite a bit lost, and never really let them out of his sight. Before he could do much though, or Ned could figure out what to say further, trying desperately to remember his written High Valaryan, he heard a call from further up the catacombs. </p><p>“Ned!” Cate’s voice practically screamed, and he heard other shouts as well, all of which sounded worried and harried. </p><p>“The crack,” he turned to Jon and Robb, who had a look of puzzlement on their faces, “when the room shook, the tremors must have carried.”</p><p>“They think it’s an earthquake, and they would have done a headcount and found us missing,” Robb stated. </p><p>Ned nodded in agreement, “most likely. Catelyn knew I was in the catacombs, it isn’t a stretch to think you boys would be with me.” </p><p>He glanced over at the boy who was looking between them and the door the shouts were echoing through with a suspicious eye. This… this wasn’t a tomb, or a grave… on the negative side, it might be a jail cell, but somehow he didn’t think so, either way he didn’t want this boy exposed further until he had the chance to sort it out. </p><p>“Stay here!” he told the boy in the Old Tongue, hoping it would at least be familiar enough before he rushed out the doors and towards the upper reaches of the catacombs, both his boys and their pups on his heels. “We’re fine, Cate!” he called out ahead of them. He didn’t want her or anyone not a Stark by blood seeing the door wide open, the boy and the sea of crystal shards at his feet.</p><p>They came upon the party, with Cate and Rickard at the lead, just a few twists in the catacombs away, and Ned was grateful they had hurried. </p><p>“Ned!” Cate called out and rushed to his side, running her hands over him quickly as if to check for damage. </p><p>“I’m fine, Cate,” he grinned. “My apologies for troubling you.” </p><p>His wife made a quite unhappy sounding noise, and Ned knew he’d never be able to slip back down to see the boy now, as Cate was in a right mood and Rickard was eyeing him something fierce with a suspicion only years of friendship could bring. Someone would need to though, if just to reiterate that he needed to stay hidden, and see if he needed food or drink or anything else after however many years of being in that Crystal. Luckily Robb wasn’t one to be much fussed over by his mother, and Catelyn rarely worried as much for Jon as Ned did. He met the eyes of his boys over Catelyn’s head as he finished going over the lists of what would need to be done in the morning to finish checking for damage from the ‘quake’ while still dealing with their royal guests and the King’s insistence on a hunt and gave them a sharp head tilt back to the catacombs. </p><p>His brilliant boys picked up his hint well enough, and luckily he saw them head to the kitchens first after a few quiet words from Jon. </p><p>XxXxX</p><p>Harry James Potter had no bloody clue what in the name of Merlin was going on. Especially with the guys dressed like particularly out of date wizards or LARPers that didn’t speak any of the top ten most prevalent languages and barely understood written English. Really, things were a little bit hazy, as if he was waking up from oversleeping by a few hours. He struggled to remember what happened before he found himself here, but it felt strangely blank. The last thing that he remembered was sitting in front of a fire sipping Butterbeer, hosting the annual Weasley Christmas/Yule Party that had everyone in attendance as his place was really the only one that had the room for all the extended family. Even Bill and Fleur, who traded years in between their parents, were there that year. Even Neville and Luna were in the house, as Neville regularly tried to ditch out on his family, and Luna loved just being around them all. </p><p>How he ended up in this underground chamber he had no idea. There was something about the shards on the ground that were screaming at his mind, like he should know them. And that they were significant somehow, but examining them didn’t really reveal much, even what precise gem they were as they didn’t register with any of the testing spells that he used once the three men, well the man and two teenagers, had run out of the room like they had Dementors chasing them when they heard the shouts from down, outside, whatever direction they had come from. He could guess well enough that the man had told him to stay put, and given that he wanted to poke around to see what he could find he didn’t mind much. </p><p>He had originally thought that the three people before him were at fault for him being here, but they had seemed just as confused, if not more so, than himself. He also thought their clothes were something out of a ren-faire, and that was saying something for someone who spent a good chunk of their time in the Wizarding World with their distinctly unique fashions. And they’d been armed with swords rather than wands, which said just as much as to their ability to draw him here magically. </p><p>Additionally they spoke no language he’d heard of, though the one the adult used last was, well, close, almost to English. If you squinted. It was worse than American English. Writing seemed hit or miss with English, though why he wasn’t sure. It would be a way to try and communicate if they ever came back – he could try getting the language out of their heads with Legilimency, but he was far from proficient and worried about accidentally hurting them. If they weren’t enemies, that was probably a bad idea. </p><p>He could try a translation spell, but those were iffy without a willing point of reference who already spoke a language you knew and the one you wanted to learn. With one, well, you could be like Barty Crouch Sr. or Dumbledore and speak 500 languages. </p><p>Harry was at 31, though he hoped to get there eventually. </p><p>Still, not helpful right now. </p><p>His holly and phoenix feather wand had been up one sleeve, and he had found the Elder Wand up the other, which was odd as he distinctly remembered leaving it in Dumbledore’s grave. The resurrection stone was also on his left middle finger, which wasn’t as much of a shock, as some enterprising reporter looking for more information on the final fight against Voldemort had stumbled across it one day and killed themselves over the apparition of their dead mother. Harry had luckily been at the scene and collected the ring, keeping it on a chain around his neck after that. </p><p>His invisibility cloak had been hidden on the inside of his coat, just like whenever he had been about to head into a fight. It was disconcerting to say the least. </p><p>Still it left him fairly well armed and able to take of himself, which relieved quite a bit of his stress. </p><p>So he poked around the rest of the chamber, eventually finding a disguised door behind the steps with their waterfall of crystals. It was blended fairly well into the rock, and Harry was shocked as it seemed much like Goblin work. While Harry had eventually managed to come to a truce with the Goblins after the break-in (mainly by repaying them for a ton of damages with interest, returning the Sword of Gryffindor, and lobbying for several other concessions on their behalf), wizards still weren’t their favorite people, and they really only cared for their gold. That there was a Goblin made door in what was either a wizard or a muggle controlled area…</p><p>Harry needed to get it open. </p><p>He was about to try his first spell when he heard feet scurrying in his direction from the door the men had bolted out of earlier. He slipped his holly wand back into his sleeve and turned in time to see the young boys, no older than 20 at the most, rush into the room with the two wolf pups from earlier at their feet. </p><p>The one with the slightly longer curly black hair was holding a plate of food. </p><p>Harry’s stomach growled, and he blushed red, but it caused both the boys to laugh, which gave him enough confidence to move over to them. The black haired boy held the plate out to him and Harry gratefully took it. The food was simple, bread, some sliced meat that was probably beef, a few fingerling potatoes and a handful of grapes, but it still looked delicious. Harry did a quick poison check, having long mastered that one wandlessly.</p><p>Wandless magic was actually pretty useful when you were an Auror. Just like broomless flying. It had taken him a bit, but he’d finally figured out the trick that Voldemort and Snape managed.</p><p>The food didn’t register any poisons that he knew, so he took the plate over to the steps, and gesturing for the boys to join him, sat and dug in. The boys quickly rushed over to drop down next to him, staring at him a bit in awe, and Harry wasn’t quite sure what to think. He was used to it from wizards, but these boys didn’t appear to be wizards. They didn’t even appear to be normal muggles. </p><p>There was a few moments of quiet as he ate, but eventually the boys started chattering to each other. It seemed innocent enough talk, though that was probably just the tone, for Harry to ignore it. He finished the entire plate rather quickly, and as he polished off the grapes for dessert he offered to split them with the boys using gestures and they each took a couple to munch on. </p><p>Once he was done, he set the plate aside and turned to face the boys. Time to try and work this language thing out. The ground beneath them was fairly dusty, and just as Harry was testing being able to draw in it, the taller boy, the one with reddish hair and crystal blue eyes pulled out a scroll of parchment and a quill, which Harry practically crowed over. He quickly snatched it up, and pointing at himself, again spoke his name and wrote it down. The boys quickly followed, and Harry was glad to note that he had correctly understood Robb and Jon early. He gestured, indicating the third man, and repeated the name Ned, which both boys nodded quickly at and jotted down the word that matched how he would spell Ned.</p><p>Okay. Good, he wasn’t completely without hope when it came to communicating. </p><p>He jotted down a quick sentence, where am I? </p><p>Luckily for him Robb seemed to understand enough, and said and wrote “Winterfell.” </p><p>Which was in the end decidedly unhelpful. “England?” He questioned and wrote, and both boys glanced at it, talking back and forth a bit before shaking their heads, and Harry let out a huff. Joy, just what he needed. Places that were completely unknown on top of not speaking the language. </p><p>They traded some words back and forth on the parchment out loud, including the names of the wolf pups, Ghost and Grey Wind, and at the end Harry could fairly convincingly say the standard courtesies, hello, how are you, where’s the bathroom, and the like when the red head yawned, starting off a round for all of them. The boys discussed more back and forth, and then the black haired one slipped out while the redhead wrote out the times of day with Harry, circling the one that Harry basically figured was the equivalent of ‘way too late to be awake.’ </p><p>He was trying to figure out how to ask what had happened to cause him to be here when the black haired boy came back with a pile of blankets, a book, and a map. </p><p>The book turned out to be a rather rough dictionary of the half English writing that they semi-knew with the words next to it that Robb and Jon had been teaching him. But the map, the map caught his attention. </p><p>He didn’t entirely understand the scale quite yet, but the map indicated either two islands or continents that didn’t match any that Harry knew. This was bad. </p><p>Still he managed to swallow his ire and nod his thanks, grateful he could say it out loud. </p><p>Both boys had managed to pass along that he needed to stay hidden, though Harry wasn’t quite sure why. He figured that would need to wait until he understood the language better, or got bored. Either or really. </p><p>Still he created a rather decent nest with the blankets, and as the boys indicated they would be back with breakfast, Harry nodded.</p><p>He did end up slipping out of the nest and following them out a bit while under a Disillusionment Charm, just to be sure that he could. He followed them through catacombs lit with candles to glance out into the yard of a medieval keep, dotted with men in mail armor carrying swords.</p><p>Harry scowled and headed back to the crystal shard room. He’d need to poke around in the day when it was light. This was… Something strange to say the least. </p><p>He walked right past the nest and up the steps to where the hidden door was, and pressed at it just to see if it would open. It didn’t, and Harry pulled his wand out to begin testing the door when there was a tug at his pant leg. Harry glanced down and there was a small, metal wolf looking up at him. Harry raised an eyebrow at it, and it promptly sat up and yipped at him playfully. Harry stared at it, trying to place it, and the creature dropped to a watching stance, eyes staring up at him dolefully, and Harry cursed.</p><p>The color and size had thrown him off. It was burnished almost black and green and with a quick wave of his wand, Harry revealed the golden wolf he had enchanted as toy and companion to watch out for Teddy in his stead whenever he had to go out on a long assignment. Teddy had called it Nymph, after his Mother. The creature yipped again, and Harry quickly broke the shrinking charm on it, and it shook out its enchanted fur just like a dog or wolf would do to its real fur. </p><p>What was it doing here? </p><p>Teddy had kept the wolf close his whole life, even when he’d gone to Hogwarts.</p><p>It then pawed over to the door and with a quick scratch, indicated that Harry should go through. Harry eyeballed the door again, casting a few detection spells to try and figure out what would happen. There was definitely a magical lock on it, but it wasn’t one that Harry really recognized. This was turning out to be a banner evening for him understanding things, really and truly. </p><p>With a huff he stepped back to stare at the door as a whole. If this turned into something ridiculously simple he was going to destroy something. </p><p>If this was all some type of horrible joke...</p><p>No. </p><p>Teddy would never let Nymph loose for a joke.</p><p>And the things he’d seen. </p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>He dropped to his knees, eyeing the door from top to bottom, trying to decide how to open it. Teddy’s wolf circled back around to lay it’s head on his lap and Harry scratched behind its ears slightly. The feel was just a tad different than a real wolf, but for the most part it was comparable. </p><p>Still, it was another part of the puzzle. Teddy polished the wolf every other day, religiously. He’d have never let it get so dirty. Heck, the power he had needed to put behind the spell to clean it… It had been sitting for awhile. And the crystal shards that tugged at his memory, and this door. The people, who seemed shocked by him, but could half communicate… </p><p>Harry laid back and looked at the ceiling of the room. Really it was nothing more than rough rock. This whole cave room thing reminded him far too much of the Chamber of Secrets. </p><p>Maybe… </p><p>Harry sat up and looked at the door. </p><p>“Open,” he hissed at it in Parseltongue. The door didn’t open, but the magic around it shifted. So that was it, a pass phrase, imbued with some type of magic. Hmm… </p><p>“Expecto Patronum,” he called out, his stag patronus trotting out Harry quickly whispered the words he was thinking to it, and it called out in his voice “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” </p><p>Sure enough the door creaked open, and Harry grinned, jumping to his feet and darting to see what was revealed.</p><p>He’d blame freezing the way he did on shock.</p><p>Because hidden behind that door was a treasure trove of magical artifacts. So many that it was impossible to take it all in at a glance. They were lined along the walls and floor and stacked in piles, including several of straight up gold in multiple denominations (it reminded him a bit of the room of hidden things, just slightly more organized). </p><p>He carefully stepped into the room to get a closer look. An entire wall was covered in books all carefully preserved under enchantments. </p><p>There were suits of armor lining the others, swords and weapons of various makes, all sorts of random oddities </p><p>Towards the back, he found rows of petrified dragon eggs as well as several other types of eggs under stasis charms that he couldn’t recognize off the top of his head. </p><p>Near those were dozens of other magical creatures, all under various protections and enchantments in stasis. There were augreys, nifflers, kneezles, more that he vaguely recognized, and towards the very back, twenty thestrals and forty unicorns. </p><p>What in the name of Merlin? He spun around, paying closer attention to the artifacts. There was no consistency. There were some sleeping paintings that he remembered from Hogwarts, a few others from the ministry and several from Museums that he had visited with Andromeda and a little Teddy, others he had no clue. And… Those were the Malfoy family tapestries in that corner, some silver trinkets that had been at Grimmauld place, and there in the corner, a crown and jewel set he felt pretty sure was one he’d seen over in France when he had been visiting Bill and Fleur and their kids once.</p><p>This was like… This was like some type of vault for everything magical with no rhyme or reason! </p><p>Suddenly there were quiet pops in front of him, and Harry had his wand out and pointed on instinct before he realized what he was doing. There cowering before him were two shivering, terrified house elves gazing at his wand with big, trembling watery eyes, their big ears drooping. Harry relaxed a bit and smiled at them. </p><p>“Hello, and what are your names?” </p><p>The two creatures wibbled. “Great Master Harry Potter Sir is as great a wizard as everyone said he is, asking our names first things!” The first one cried.</p><p>“He is, he is!” The other one agreed. Harry, through a gallant effort, managed to not rub the bridge of his nose and sigh.</p><p>“I am Skitter, sir, it is a pleasure to serve the great Master Harry Potter, sir” the first one said. </p><p>“And I am Tamsy, Master Harry Potter sir,” the second followed. </p><p>“It is a pleasure to meet you both, and please, just call me Harry” he said, and they both if anything, looked even more enchanted. “Okay, any chance that you know what is going on?” </p><p>Both of them drooped, looking sad and put out immediately. </p><p>“It was the war, sir, it got really bad,” Skitter said. “Magic was dying, Master Harry sir.”</p><p>Harry felt that like a punch in the gut. “War? Dying?” </p><p>The House Elves nodded, “it was after you went to sleep, Master Harry sir. Though many tried to wake you and failed. The muggles found out about wizards, sir, and things got real bad.” </p><p>Harry fell to his knees. No… </p><p>“Muggles use nuklir weapons,” Nuclear… Harry thought… Nuclear bombs, “and wizards fought and everyone fought. So many died, Master Harry sir. The whole world shifted. Great storms and fire and so much death. Continents rose and fell and the earth itself changed.” Harry wasn’t surprised. There had been several studies done around Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Chernobyl, the testing sites in the United States and the Pacific… Everywhere that the muggles used nuclear power, magic got wonky. And if magic got to close to the power plants, well, those had the tendency to malfunction just like most electronics. Definitely not a good thing. </p><p>Harry quickly cast the radiation detecting spells he’d learned from some American wizards when he’d been on a joint task force dealing with a few terrorists that had gotten their hands on a nindu with Ron and Draco.</p><p>That whole week had sucked… Royally. </p><p>The radiation wasn’t bad actually. Slightly high, but nothing that wasn’t outside of a safe range. He’d have to redo the spells once he got to the surface, but he didn’t think that he would have a problem. </p><p>“Last wizards helped make the bad energy go away Master Harry Potter sir!” Harry glanced at the two house elves and nodded. That made sense, in a way.</p><p>“What is this place specifically?” He asked. </p><p>“This is the Safe-Keeping,” Tamsy grinned. “The last wizards put as much of the old magic as they could here, hoping that the world would heal enough it could be brought out.” </p><p>“Why am I here, do you know?” He asked. </p><p>“Master Teddy had Master Harry Sir’s Crystal brought here, and the Safe-Keeping keyed to something you would know just in cases. Skitter and Tamsy were bound to you too, sir, to save us since there were no more magical residences, sir. We were put asleep until the Safe-Keeping was opened, sir, so that we would be safe and serve you, Great Wizard Master Harry Potter Sir when it came time to bring magic back and save everyone, sir.” </p><p>Harry froze, “no more magical residences? Not even Hogwarts?” </p><p>Both elves shook their heads sadly, and Harry sighed. Okay, he would breakdown and cry over that later. For now he needed to figure out how to survive in this dark new world he’d somehow found himself in, and save as many of the now truly priceless artifacts around him as possible. </p><p>“My memory is a little fuzzy, do either of you know how I ended up in the Crystal?” Both elves looked at each before looking back at him, practically crying already. </p><p>“It was so sad sir! Blood Curses on Master Teddy, and on the Masters and Mistresses Weasley and all, made you kneel sir the evil wizards did!” </p><p>And just like that it came flashing back, like a bad dream… </p><p>Teddy and the others trapped under blood magic, screaming… The crystal swallowing him whole...</p><p>Harry swallowed. </p><p>No. He’d think about it later. Never was good. </p><p>For now, he needed to figure things out. </p><p>He hadn’t known what would happen after he did that, there had been no way to tell… Truthfully he could feel a vague sense of time, but luckily he hadn’t been aware. It really was like going to sleep one night and then waking up, thank Merlin. He had no idea what would happen if his mind had been awake the entire time, he’d be more than a little mad most likely! </p><p>Thinking of, “do you two have any idea how long it has been since I went into the Crystal? Or since the Safe-Keeping was created?” </p><p>Both shook their heads, looking dejected, “it was over a hundred years between the two, Master Harry Sir, but we do not know how long since then.” </p><p>Harry took a deep breath… Okay… He needed some sleep, he’d been up hours before being trapped, had been at the end of his rope, and while his magic was mostly recovered, he was still physically exhausted. Or you know, it could be the stress of waking up when he did. But he needed information. The man and boys that had most likely woken him looked pretty startled, like they hadn’t meant to, but they hadn’t run screaming, called him a monster and tried to burn him at the stake, which was a good thing, but they had tried to hide him, indicating that maybe it wasn’t safe?</p><p>And the house outside the catacombs, hell the catacombs themselves, it was just as medieval as their clothes. </p><p>“Are there any other house elves?” he asked them, and both shook their heads. </p><p>“Not that we know of Master Harry Sir.” </p><p>Okay, it was sad, very, but for now… “How are you two feeling? Well rested, your power okay?” </p><p>Both nodded, “Master Teddy made sure we had good nights sleeps and plenty of rest and food in case we needed to come out swinging to protect you Master Harry Potter Sir.” </p><p>His Godson… “Was anything else set to wake up right when I did? Or when the door opened?” </p><p>Both elves shook their heads no. </p><p>“Okay, great. First thing then, I am exhausted, so I am going to bring the two of you out of this room and close it just in case, and then I am going to sleep. But we need information, are you two willing to be super quiet and sneaky and see what you can see?” </p><p>Both of them got determined little looks on their faces and nodded fiercely. “Okay, here is what I know.” He quickly briefed the two little creatures, and they nodded directly. “Can you read?” He asked them at the end. That had been a problem with some of the older house elves from particularly abusive families, but luckily both nodded. That was one hurdle down. </p><p>He walked them out, shutting the door with a quick Patronus and a Mischief Managed, and then quickly taught the elves what little of the language that he had picked up with his notes from Robb and Jon, and then showed them the dictionary. “As a secondary goal, make a copy of this. Use materials from the Safe-Keeping if possible, if not, try to find something that will not be missed from the house above. Now, your primary goal, while I am sleeping, sneak into the keep above us. While you are up there, pick up what you can of the language while being super quiet and sneaky like I said, no one can see you at all, understand?” They both nodded fiercely, making assurances of how quiet and good they could be. “Fantastic, the ones that woke me are these ones,” he cast illusions of Ned, Robb, and Jon. “Find them first, see if you can tell from how they interact with people if they are good men or bad, and see if you can find who is important to them. Search the house and draw a map as you go, make note of any important rooms, and see how the people are treated, especially if they are servants. Overhear as much as you can while staying safe and hidden, understand?” </p><p>Both nodded, and Harry sent them off with a wave while he settled down onto the blankets that Robb and Jon had left. They did little to soften the hard floor, but Harry still managed to force himself to sleep just fine.</p>

        <blockquote class="userstuff">
          <p>On the languages, the most common language spoken in Westeros is named “the common tongue of the Andros” or Common Tongue or Common, for short. It is, for lack of a better explanation, basically American English with pseudo-medieval stuff thrown in. There aren’t really a ton of rules, as GRRM has stated that he is not a linguist. The world is supposed to be completely alternate, so that is okay because it can basically be assumed to have grown on its own. Since I need the language to have drifted and changed over time, as languages often do, I am basically using the Old Tongue as a time-drifted version of English with a distinctly Scottish and Celtic twist to it, and the Common Tongue as a newer language. High Valaryian spoken is not English, more like a combined version of several European languages, but written it still uses roughly the same letters and English as a base due to the prevalence of English in the modern (old) world due to business.</p>
