<p>Happy Hero</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Swallowing the last of Draco’s stir-fry, Harry sighed. “You <i>can</i> cook.” </p>
<p>“Naturally,” Draco murmured. Finishing his wine, he rose, extending a hand towards Harry. “Although right now, I’m hungry for something else.” </p>
<p>Harry grinned, taking his hand. “Oh?” </p>
<p>They kissed, Harry backing Draco up until he was pressed against the wall. “Guess what I’m good at,” Harry murmured. </p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Dancing.” </p>
<p>“<i>You</i> want to go dancing?” Draco stared at him. “You’re full of surprises.” </p>
<p>“Is that a yes?”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Draco hummed. “You’ll protect me from any other men’s advances, right?” </p>
<p>“Let them try,” Harry growled.</p>
<p>Draco laughed softly. “My hero.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>They stumbled towards Draco’s bedroom, kissing and caressing each other all the way. Once inside, Draco pushed Harry onto the bed, appraising him. “Hm. What do I have that will fit you?” </p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “I’ll just Transfigure my trousers—”</p>
<p>Draco snorted. “Not if you’re going dancing with me, you won’t.” He pressed a quick kiss on Harry's mouth. “Stay here. I’ve just the thing.”</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Harry cried, “Just so you know, I’m not wearing leather trousers! Or a cape!” </p>
<p>“Heroes wear capes,” Draco called back. </p>
<p>“Not this one!” Harry grinned. He couldn’t remember being so happy in ages. </p>
