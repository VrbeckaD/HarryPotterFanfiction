    <p>
  <span>After the war ended all went as you would expect it the funerals, trails, war reparations from Voldemort's followers. As one of the head officers, our share of the reparation was the lion's share. All the dark arts family heirlooms and objects were taken. Our properties and vaults all over the world were raided even the ones, I, as the heir was not aware of, was dug up from the hidden records. My mother and I were spared because of Potter’s testimony on our behalf. The perfect boy who lived even helped reduce the sentence for my father. Due to my father's choice, the Malfoy name is in tatters, people now dare speak ill in our presence. As an Alpha and a pureblood, my prospects in life were going to be glorious, all have come to ruin no proper family is willing to create a family bond with us. Not even the purebloods that had one or two generation dilution of muggle or magical creature was willing to associate with the name Malfoy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fortunately, we still had our seat in the Ministry of Magic, where I had my mother representing our interests. I was too busy figuring out how to manage the huge amount of reparation we would have to pay to the government and families that were harmed by my father’s actions. While I was running about accumulating the funds I found out about the muggle businesses we had, which was a shocker. My father who was always so strict about pureblood traditions and against any and all muggle invention. Owned many establishments that were involved with the development of muggle technology such as television, microchips, computer, telephone, etc. I first spoke to my mother who was as aware of these businesses as I were. She was very upset that all the torture we went through in our own home was for nothing, for the values and principles were truly not believed by her husband. After the reveal of this truth my mother wrote one last goodbye letter to my father, she spoke of him in past tense from then on, as if he were dead. My father did not write to plead with mother only a last letter to apologize. I felt sad for my parents but I had no time to mourn the end of their relationship and the loss of my father for I choose to stand in solidarity with my mother. I had to figure out a way to make back what I was paying in reparation and bring the Malfoy name to its former glory.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I flooed my closest friends from Hogwarts to learn if they were also owners of muggle establishments. It turned out most pureblood families were holders of muggle businesses as Pansy put it, “ it's just good business”. Money and power seemed to be the only values and principles the pureblood believed in, the rest were lies to make it seem more pious than it actually was. I decided I was not going to pay up and not profit from the chaos after the war. I invited my friends to brainstorm a way to get the pureblood names with all that is good and righteous. Months of brainstorming sessions did not bring about any gems that could be used. Until Harry Potter, the Golden Boy announced his Co-Minister of Magic position in the Daily Prophet as if that was a thing. The article stated that he would work with Kingsley Shacklebolt to create a more equal and just Magical society. When asked how he was to achieve this he said by educating the Magical world more about muggle and eliminating the ignorance that muggles were less than the wizarding community. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A eureka moment occurred after reading the article, our muggle businesses will have double profit because we will provide the muggle technologies, books, toys, medicine, etc. that will lift the curse of ignorance. I was really grateful for the ministry seats that were in our families, the votes were in our favor for we held the majority of the seats. I spoke to my mother on how to get this movement going, that would include muggle knowledge and technology within the magical world. She and Lady Parkinson gave us the idea of getting each company to send in proposals on how their technologies can be incorporated into the wizarding society.  These proposals were sent by our magical second in commands so that our name would not be mentioned in these proposals. The proposals were accepted by the Ministry thanks to our advantageous positions in the public and private sectors of the wizarding society. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Within half, a decade all had changed the old Diagon alley had transformed into a Large mall that housed all the traditional shop with an artisan look. The wizarding society decides to go green since they learned from television shows how the planet was being destroyed due to living in excess. Most architecture kept the traditional form but the interiors were brighter using magic to bring in sunlight, the furniture was also modernized to fit the new integrated society. The educational system had also changed, now it includes muggle knowledge such as chemistry, biology, math, literature, and many more. The muggle subjects were combined with the wizarding subjects as potion went with chemistry, physics with transformation, math with Arithmancy, and many more. The Goleys made back and more than the reparation took from them thanks to their publishing company. Thanks to muggle advancement in medicine we no longer had to drink the foul tasting potions anymore,  they came as patches that dissolve on one's heart and spread fast throughout to give the desired effect. Healing reached a whole new level once we saw the molecular aspects of the universe. Wizards and witches already in the profession were encouraged to learn the muggle counter part of their profession with positive incentive. Thus most chose to learn from the muggle view of the world, the changes came about much faster due to this. Wizarding society of Europe seemed more like modern Europe now with the exception of people holding phones that had the floo connection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stupid pureblood ideology had believed the muggles were beneath wizarding kind, were as they had been on equal footing for a while. They understood the world in a different and amazing way that has brought the wizarding world to a whole new level. During this revolution, the purebloods used the new form of media to get their apologies and acts of redemption to the public eye to show that we were accepting the muggle technologies and of them. After a decade I am still seen as a death eater, though the tattoo has been removed, all reparations paid, and active donation to charities. Nothing changed the fact that I was a death eater in the last war, no one cared whether I was a willing or unwilling participant. Over the years I tried to court many omegas for marriage, all end with rejection even the couple of betas. I finally asked my mother to stop and desist these attempts at getting back to the former glory of the Malfoy name via family bonding. I have become more cynical and tired of the world around me, only power and money matters nothing else. I had stopped socializing, the only time I would go somewhere was because it would help me procure more of what was necessary to move forward in my life. Thus, when I found myself bound to Potter was the most advantages move of all.</span>
