    <p>It was strange, for Calista Snape, to have a summer break where she wasn't waiting for exam scores, or mulling over the ones she'd already received, wondering how she could improve the next year.</p><p>Severus had even eased up on her defence lessons, <em>and</em> her Occlumency lessons temporarily, and for the first few weeks of summer, he gave her free reign to do whatever she wanted with her days, within reason; she had her best friend Amelia over three times, and her boyfriend, Gerald  Boot, twice. Once, he even allowed her to meet Gerald, Amelia, and Amelia's girlfriend Endria in London, and they'd all gone to a Muggle library, which she and Gerald had enjoyed, but which Amelia and Endria had both declared boring, due to the lack of books about curses. She and Gerald had agreed that, next time, they'd go alone.</p><p>She and Gerald had received their scores from the Poisons and Antidotes exam, and they'd both been certified; she even received a letter along with her certificate informing her that she'd achieved a perfect score. Severus, practically gloating, had insisted on having it framed, and had shown her an older, more yellowed copy of precisely the same letter addressed to him, fifteen years earlier, when he'd taken the exam in his seventh year.</p><p>Her owl, whom she'd decided to name Lucerna, after the Latin rune for candle, as sort of a play against her father's pitch black owl Nox, quickly became familiar with the route between her home and Gerald's; on the days between when they'd arranged to meet, she was nearly always carrying a letter in one direction or the other, and Gerald's owl Uruz made the trip nearly as frequently; sometimes their letters even crossed in the air, and she'd receive one on the same day she'd sent one out.</p><p>He'd sent one letter entirely in French, and it had taken her almost an hour after dinner to translate the entire thing; when she did finally reach the end, she'd been blushing so fiercely she had to open one of the skylights in her room, to let the cool evening air settle on her cheeks. She'd written her response entirely in Latin runes; partly out of a playful sort of spite, and partly because she'd been too embarrassed to write some of the words she wanted to use out properly. She hadn't <em>quite</em> told him she loved him; but she'd come very, very close.</p><p>Still, as the days and gradually, weeks went by, Calista knew that this light, this freedom, was only temporary; an ethereal glow from the high shelf above the mantle in their sitting room reminded her, every time she walked through, that she was essentially a hostage of her own memory.</p><p>One warm, sticky day near the end of July, Severus brought it up, over dinner.</p><p>"We shouldn't wait much longer," he said, without preamble; she knew precisely what he was talking about, even though the last thing they'd discussed was her course schedule for her final year. "I want to leave you at least a month."</p><p>"To deal with it," she muttered, suddenly losing her appetite. She set her fork down. "To — <em>recover</em>, right?"</p><p>Severus set his own fork down, too.</p><p>"You don't have to do it," he reminded her, gravely.</p><p>"Yes, I do."</p><p>"No. You don't; I made that very clear."</p><p>"I can't sleep," she said, flatly. "And it keeps starting to come back, anyway — flashes of it, feelings… sometimes I wake up and I'm terrified, but I can't remember why. You said I might feel worse, for a little while, if I take the memory back; but you said if I don't, then nothing will change."</p><p>Severus nodded, tightly, confirming his words.</p><p>"Well, that's it, then. I need things to change."</p><p>
  <strong>(¯ˆ·.¸¸.·ˆ¯)</strong>
</p><p>They decided on the last Friday in July; it gave Severus time to contact Albus Dumbledore, and make arrangements to borrow his Pensieve, and the forecast was for a drizzly, grey rain that felt appropriate, to Calista.</p><p>She couldn't eat, that morning or the night before, and Severus had only half-heartedly tried to make her. She'd received a couple of owls the day before, too, but she hadn't opened them. Instead, she'd put them in her room, pressed between two of her favourite books, hoping that the prospect of reading them — one from Gerald, and one from Amelia — would offer her cheer she felt she'd be in desperate need of, once this was over.</p><p>Severus set the Pensieve out on the kitchen table, and the two vials containing her memories beside it.</p><p>"It won't be like reliving it," he promised her, "It won't be that intense; it will be like watching it, instead, from the outside. You won't feel any of the pain again. And I can go with you; I can stand right beside you. You won't need to remember alone."</p><p>She nodded, and forced herself to swallow the hard lump of tension in her throat. "I know," she said quietly; it was why they had elected to do things this way, rather than using legilimency to restore the missing memories.</p><p>"It's not too late—" he began, and she shook her head fiercely, interrupting him. "No. I don't want Gerald here, and I don't want Amelia. I don't want them to know."</p><p>"It might help, to have your friends —"</p><p>"<em>No</em>," she said, fiercely; it was true that Gerald had promised he wouldn't think less of her for anything that Bellatrix had done to her, but Amelia had never made any such promise; and besides, it was one thing to have seen things, but… to have either of them find out that she had the Dark Mark carved into her skin? She wasn't willing to test Gerald's promise with <em>that</em>.</p><p>"No," she repeated, and then: "I'm ready; let's do it now."</p><p>Severus' features pulled down into a grim frown, and his eyes searched her face; but after a moment, he reached wordlessly for the vials, and unstoppered them.</p><p>He poured them in, one after the other; they swirled, deceptively bright and pretty in the stone basin. Severus put his hand on her shoulder, and together, they leaned over the basin, until she felt the tip of her nose touch the cool silver of the memory —</p><p>
  <em>Suddenly, they are somewhere else. They've landed in a dining room, with dark, scroll-patterned wallpaper and a heavy, ornate dining set.</em>
</p><p>Calista's heart began to race, immediately; she knew this room. She knew this place. Beside her, her father shifted, moved his arm so that it lay across her shoulders, solidly. She was glad for the reminder of his presence.</p><p><em>One side of the table has carved chairs, but at the other, there's just a long, hard bench. At the very far end of that bench, a tiny form is crouched, scribbling in a little journal at the table she can barely reach, tangled dark hair spilling onto its surface. It takes Calista a second to realise that the form is a little girl, and a few more seconds to realise that the little girl is </em>her<em>.</em></p><p>"That… doesn't look like me," she murmured, "She's too small." Had she ever been that small? It was hard to imagine.</p><p>"She's only about four or five years old," Severus murmured back, "And she's not cared for, yet. I don't think she eats enough."</p><p>There was something strangely comforting in his words — she's not cared for — <em>yet</em>. It reminded Calista that this girl, this tiny, wretched-looking little thing, <em>would</em> one day be cared for. She almost managed to quirk a small smile, too, at the way he nagged, even here, even <em>then</em>, that she didn't eat enough.</p><p>'<em>Calista,' a cold, familiar voice calls out cajolingly, as a woman appears in the doorway of the dining room, only steps away from where she and her father stand.</em></p><p>Calista started; Severus' grip on her shoulder tightened, slightly.</p><p>"It's only memory," he reminded her.</p><p>
  <em>The woman steps into the room, and the little girl's head snaps up. A fascinating transition takes place; her tiny face, the thin mouth and the long nose and the wide, dark eyes go carefully blank.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The woman doesn't notice, or doesn't care. She steps forward, and plucks the child up by the arm. The girl loses her grip on her ratty little book; it falls underneath the table, and she stretches her free arm out in vain, reaching for it. Her fingers wiggle uselessly in the air.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix walks right past past Severus and Calista, without seeing them, hauling the child along bodily.</em>
</p><p>Calista sucked in a breath as she passed; something struck her, something that seemed absurd and out-of-place.</p><p>"I'm taller than her," she said, quietly, and it was true; the shadow-Calista that stood watching <em>was</em> taller than the memory of Bellatrix. Ironically, she realised that if this were happening <em>now</em>, in real-time - if this wasn't just her own memory, she could have possibly done something to help this poor little girl.</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix tosses the little girl onto the black brocade sofa in the sitting room, and reaches into her pocket.</em>
</p><p>Calista reached into her own pocket too, and wrapped her fingers around her wand, even though she knew she couldn't use it, here. Still, it was comforting just to feel it, beneath her fingers. She reached into her other pocket, and felt the edges of the little diary, the very same one the little girl in the vision had dropped under the table, seconds ago.</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix's pale fingers are wrapped securely around the handle of a cruel, sharp-looking knife; on the sofa, the little girl spots it, and her dark eyes go even wider. She scrambles up, and makes a valiant effort to run away, but she isn't quick enough.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix draws her wand in her other hand, and casts a body bind curse. The girl falls down, almost immediately, stiff as a board. Long fingers reach down, wind themselves between the tangles of the girl's matted hair, and yank her unceremoniously up, depositing her back on the couch without even loosening their grip on the knife.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She slips her wand back into her pocket, and eyes the girl, holding the knife up contemplatively, like an artist holding a brush; as if the frozen, terrified little girl is a canvas.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Calista, Calista. Do you know what good little girls do?'</em></p><p>
  <em>The little girl doesn't respond; she can't. She is still bound by the curse.</em>
</p><p>"They grow up, and learn to fight you," Calista said, with quiet force, but the memory of Bellatrix couldn't hear her.</p><p>'<em>Good little girls stay close to their mothers,' Bellatrix coos, and then she frowns, mouth twisting up petulantly. 'But you are not a good little girl, are you?'</em></p><p>
  <em>The little girl still can't move, but her eyes — her eyes are alive, they burn fiercely with defiance, overpowering even her fear, meeting the woman's cold gaze with a precocious ferocity.</em>
</p><p>"She's a very brave girl," Severus murmured, "No one can take that from her."</p><p>"I think," Calista replied, "She gets it from her father."</p><p>Severus made a noise in his throat. "Perhaps he should be here, to help her."</p><p>Calista shifted slightly, and leaned closer to her father. "He is."</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix is not done berating the child; she runs her finger along the edge of the knife's blade, leaning forward. 'You think I do not see the way you hide all the time?' she challenges, 'You think, perhaps, that I cannot see the itch to run away, every time I bring you outside?'</em>
</p><p>"Why the fuck do you think that is?" Calista whispered, nearly choking on her own words; she felt anger begin to bubble up inside her. It still didn't feel like the little girl was really her, but she felt protective of her, anyway. She wished she could pluck the girl off the couch, and bring her… bring her straight to the man that stood beside her, still stoically supporting her shoulders.</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix licks her lips, and presses her finger to the tip of the blade, testing it. A thin rivulet of crimson liquid drips down the edge of the knife.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Mama sees everything,' she hisses, madly. 'And just in case you forget who you belong to, in case you do try to run away from me…'</em></p><p>
  <em>The woman's face splits into a cold, mad grin. 'Let's make sure you don't get very far before I find you.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She reaches for the girl, grabs her roughly around the neck with her free hand — now the girl's eyes do flash with fear, until she is turned around, her face pressed uncaringly into the fabric on the back of the sofa, hidden from view.</em>
</p><p>Calista felt the scratchy fabric, remembered suddenly the way her mouth and nose had become blocked by tears and snot; remembered struggling to breath, remembered the blackness and the stillness, remembered wondering if she was being murdered, if this was death —</p><p>She felt herself start to shake, and even though her father's grip was sure and strong, she wondered, for the first time, if this had been a mistake. Perhaps it <em>was</em> too much to bear…but it was too late, for the little girl on the sofa, and for the young woman watching her.</p><p>
  <em>Bellatrix slices the girl's robes open with the knife. Her skin is pale, and clings to her bones. There's not much to her at all; a shiver wracks her tiny frame and overpowers it. Bellatrix twists her fingers into the girl's hair again, and lowers the knife to her skin, somewhere just below the middle of her back.</em>
</p><p>Calista made a small noise in her throat; the yelp of a wounded dog. Severus pulled her closer, wrapped both arms around her; she was watching over his shoulder now, her eyes burning with unshed tears.</p><p>
  <em>Very quickly, the lines of Bellatrix's work blur and seep with blood; more than once, she has to wipe it aside, her own hand becoming sticky and stained. Blood drips on the floor, and coats the blade. It takes a long time; too long, and the girl shivers wretchedly all the while. A couple of times, Bellatrix's fingers clench and tighten in her hair, trying to hold her still.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Finally, she yanks the girl up by her hair; the girl makes a valiant, desperate struggle to move and at last, it looks like the body bind curse has broken. She pulls out of her mother's grasp, leaving the woman clutching at a fistful of dark hair. The girl's eyes are wide and round with panic, and she slips on a spot on the floor that is slick and dark with blood.</em>
</p><p>Calista reached her hand out, unconsciously, as if she could take the girl's hand, and draw her out of the memory; she wanted to, had perhaps wanted nothing more powerfully in her life.</p><p>"We can't help her," Severus said, voice strange and hoarse. She tore her eyes away from the terrified little girl, and looked at her father — and if her heart hadn't already felt like it was being ripped violently apart, it certainly did now; his eyes, his expression, were as bleak as the shallow, matte drops of dark liquid on the hard floor.</p><p>
  <em>A horrible, high, heart-wrenching scream pulls its way out of the girl's throat; Bellatrix drops the knife on the ground with a hollow clatter, and slaps the child, hard; somehow, this seems more violent than everything else, even when Bellatrix draws her wand and aims it at the girl again.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Silencio!'</em></p><p>
  <em>The girl falls silent, and a curtain falls across her eyes, a wall of blankess replacing the terror —</em>
</p><p>The vision swirled, pulsing silver and blue. Calista trembled and shivered just as violently as the poor, skinny little girl had done, and even Severus' presence couldn't still her, because he was shaking, too.</p><p>Gradually, the room around them melted away, faded to darkness; but they weren't to be released, yet. Another room began to materialise around them, one that didn't look as familiar, though Calista supposed she might have seen it before. It was another sitting room, this one much plainer and somehow more generic than the one they'd just left.</p><p>"These are the linked memories," Severus managed, modulating his voice. "The ones where you remembered — that — too vividly for me to separate them. They… shouldn't be as bad."</p><p>
  <em>It is night in this room, but the thin, silver light of a nearly full moon streams through the gauzy white curtains that cover the large bay window. The tidy room houses two hulking shapes of furniture, a long three-seat sofa and a shorter one; both of which look fluffy and comfortable.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The little girl is here, still tiny and still pale, in the reflected moonlight. She's curled up on the smaller sofa, asleep, but she doesn't look restful; she frets, quietly, emitting whimpers and breathy little gasps.</em>
</p><p>Calista took a step closer to the sofa where the child was curled up; so did Severus. This time, it was he who reached out, as if to lay his hand on the girl's shoulder. She didn't seem to feel it; his hand passed through her.</p><p>He murmured something; Calista couldn't hear it. She couldn't bring herself to open her mouth and ask him to repeat it.</p><p>
  <em>The girl is growing more distressed by the minute. She begins to stir, curling herself up tighter, as if she is hiding. Her eyes move rapidly behind thin, papery lids; she is dreaming.</em>
</p><p>'<em>No,' the girl mutters in her sleep, 'Mama, no.'</em></p><p>
  <em>Suddenly, there is motion at the other side of the room, from the other sofa. A man is there, and he lifts his head, looking across the room, to where the little girl still moves and whimpers, in her sleep.</em>
</p><p>Calista stepped back, startled; she hadn't even realised the sofa was occupied, that there was anyone in the room besides the little girl, and the shadow-forms of herself and her father.</p><p>'<em>What's wrong? What's happening?' the hoarse, rough sound of the man's voice cuts across the room, but it doesn't wake the girl.</em></p><p>
  <em>The man waits a few seconds, shaking his head, and rubbing the sleep from his eyes. He stands, a bit unsteadily, and then he takes a few steps across the room.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He steps across the beam of moonlight, and his face becomes visible. He looks young, but his hair already gleams with streaks of silver in spots where the light hits it; his face is drawn, haggard, and he looks as though he hasn't slept properly in days.</em>
</p><p>Severus hissed, at the sight of the man. Calista felt a strange little jolt; she remembered that man, though she didn't remember this night at all. She remembered listening to him read aloud, remembered — once — pointing out one of the letters in her name. She'd been too afraid to tell him anything else. That was when she'd gotten the moniker 'Chloe'. She wrinkled her nose a bit, even now. She didn't like that name, never had. It reminded her of the orphanage, now.</p><p>'<em>Poor thing,' the man murmurs, crossing the room. He crouches by the sofa, and lifts his arm, but he doesn't quite reach for the child, not yet.</em></p><p>'<em>Wake up, little one,' he says, quietly; even though his voice is tired and hoarse, it does manage to sound gentle.</em></p><p>
  <em>The girl doesn't wake; she stirs more violently, and her mouth moves again.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Mama bad,' she half-gasps, half-cries, 'Mama, no! Mama, stop…'</em></p><p>'<em>So you </em>can<em> talk,' the man says softly, and he nods, as if he more or less expected this; then he does reach his hand out, and places it lightly on the girl's shoulder —</em></p><p>— in almost precisely the same spot, and the same manner, that Severus had, only a moment before —</p><p>— <em>and he shakes her, gently. 'It's all right; wake up.'</em></p><p>
  <em>She does, now; her eyes snap open, huge and round and dark, and she gasps, half-sitting up, and scrambling backwards, yanking herself away from the man; when she backs herself against the soft arm of the sofa,she starts to veer backwards over it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man reaches out, obviously trying to stop her from falling, but she's quick, and she tumbles over onto the floor, with a soft, muffled thud.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He shifts, pushing a hank of hair out of his eyes, and peers over the arm of the sofa at the girl. She backs herself against the wall, looking terrified but unharmed.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Hey, little one, it's all right, it was only a dream. I want to help; I'm not going to hurt you.'</em></p><p>"She doesn't believe him," Calista murmured; Severus' grip on her shoulder tightened. She glanced at him, and his jaw was set, eyes fierce, as if <em>he</em> didn't believe the man, either.</p><p>
  <em>The child's hands go behind her back, pulling and clawing desperately, as if trying to dislodge something.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man frowns, eyes going soft. 'You're safe here, little bird.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Her eyes are wild, unseeing; or, rather, whatever she is seeing is in her own head. She continues to pull at her back, and to scramble away from the man's attempts to help.</em>
</p><p>The room dissolved again, swirling into a much more familiar one, with close stone walls and subterranean darkness.</p><p>
  <em>Light seeps in from the open door, the corridor beyond; the tall, cloaked shape of a man appears in silhouette, and the door opens wider. Now, in the light of it, the little girl can be seen, hunched against the headboard of the bed that nearly fills the tiny room.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Her eyes are closed, but they move rapidly, again, beneath the thin, sallow lids. She whimpers, again, though this time, she doesn't verbally cry out.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man steps into the room, face creased with concern, mouth pulling down. His skin is pale, almost precisely the same shade as the little girl's; and when he perches cautiously on the edge of the bed, and her eyes snap open, their eyes are almost exactly the same: dark, wide mirrors - they both look afraid, haunted.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Her hands go to her back, just like before, even as she inches away from him.</em>
</p><p>'<em>It's all right,' the man says, uncertainly, as if he doesn't quite believe it, 'Whatever you're seeing, it's not real.'</em></p><p>
  <em>She doesn't seem to hear him, doesn't seem to understand; her eyes dart around the room, and now she's tearing frantically at her back, fingers picking and clawing, managing to draw blood even through the thin fabric of her nightdress.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Stop,' the man says, and his voice is steadier now, certain and commanding. 'Stop it, you're hurting yourself — it's not real, she's not here.'</em></p><p>
  <em>The girl finally seems to see him, and manages a response; she shakes her head frantically, and keeps clawing.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man leans forward, mouth pressed hard and tight in a slash beneath his beaky nose, and he reaches for the girl's wrists, pulling them away from her back. She starts, and resists, but she is very small and she's no match for him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She starts to tremble, fiercely, and the man's eyes narrow, and then widen again. He looks utterly uncertain; he looks as lost, as confused, as helpless as the cowering child does.</em>
</p><p>"Dad," Calista murmured, feeling something break inside her; she'd never seen that look on his face. She found herself wanting to reach out, wanting to comfort <em>him</em>, just as much as she wanted to comfort the wretched-looking little girl. "You look so frightened."</p><p>"I was," he choked out, beside her, "I had no idea what I was doing. I just — wanted to do it right."</p><p>
  <em>He makes a decision; he sets his jaw and his eyes flash, and then he pulls the girl closer, at first by her wrists, and then, when she is right beside him despite her wild efforts to break free, he wraps his arms around her, and clutches her to his chest.</em>
</p><p>'<em>It's all right,' he tells her, 'You're safe now.'</em></p><p>
  <em>She flails and scratches at him; she nicks the soft skin of his cheek, and he grimaces, but keeps his hold on her, repeating his mantra, over and over.</em>
</p><p>'<em>You're safe,' he says, over and over, until it hardly sounds like he's speaking real words anymore; and gradually, miraculously, she seems to hear him. She seems to start, cautiously, to believe him. She stops struggling, though she still shakes violently, still gasps unevenly for breath.</em></p><p>
  <em>And then — slowly, even that subsides, and finally, she is still. A few minutes later, she slumps against him, her head dropping lightly onto his shoulder. The man looks like he is holding his breath.</em>
</p><p>"I think you did," Calista said quietly, "I think you did it — exactly right."</p><p>
  <em>The room swirls and dissolves, reappears again, and the same scene plays out, on a different night; this time, he reaches for her as soon as he enters the room, and it takes a few minutes less for her to stop struggling.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There is a series of nights like this, of the same room fading away and then back into place around them; the man starts to look a little bit less lost, and the girl starts to look a little bit less wild, but little else changes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Finally, the fifth or sixth time the room appears, something is different — a chilling, desperate scream echoes off the stone walls.</em>
</p><p>Calista started; Severus' fingers on her shoulder twitched, but his arm stayed around her, steadying.</p><p>
  <em>The girl doesn't look quite as skinny, or quite as unkempt as before — her hair is slightly tangled, but no longer matted, and her cheekbones aren't quite as prominent. She still looks wretched, in that moment, mouth open, wailing, eyes shut tight.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The hook-nosed man dashes into the room, wand lit. His head whips around, looking for an attacker that can't be seen. He grips her shoulders.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Calista, wake up,' he urges, shaking her gently, 'It's only a dream, wake up.'</em></p><p>
  <em>She doesn't respond, except to continue the awful, desperate sound. He hurriedly aims his wand at the corner, and a candelabra comes to life, bathing the room in soft light, and then he slips his wand into his pocket, and grips her shoulders more firmly.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Calista!'</em></p><p>
  <em>Her eyes fly open again, and they are full of a wild, animal terror; it's immediately plain that the little girl doesn't know where she is, or who's holding on to her. She claws out, blindly, and scratches his face. He shifts his grip, grabs her wrists and holds them securely.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Calista, it's only me,' he says firmly, trying to be heard over her awful racket, 'You're safe. Nothing's here, nothing's hurting you.'</em></p><p>
  <em>Finally, she sucks in a series of gasping breaths, and the screaming shifts, into choked sobbing. Her eyes dart around the room, only marginally less wild.</em>
</p><p>'<em>You're safe,' the man reassures her again, carefully loosening his grip on her wrists. Immediately, they fly to her back, begin clawing and scratching in the same familiar spot.</em></p><p>'<em>The knife,' the little girl whispers, hoarsely; it is the first time in the entire sequence of memories that she speaks knowingly, while awake. 'Get it out!'</em></p><p>
  <em>He reaches for her hands again, this time simply holding them together in front of her, and he leans forward, patiently explains that there is no knife to remove, that she's been dreaming.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It takes quite some time to convince her; he repeats himself, urges her to breathe, to calm down, while she keeps insisting that her terrors are real, are now.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When he thinks she might be receptive, he releases her wrists, and reaches for her, in a familiar motion - but she recoils, pushing her tiny hands against him, intent on driving him away.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Calista, it's me,' he tells her, tiredly, reaching out again.</em></p><p>'<em>G-go away,' she chokes, terror still alight in her eyes; a shiver wracks her body and then she starts trembling, violently; her breathing is still laboured, and it only seems to be getting worse.</em></p><p>
  <em>He tells her, over and over, the familiar mantra: that she is safe, that he won't hurt her, but she tells him, again, to go away, and retreats further, pressing her back against the headboard, wrapping her arms around herself, except in the moments he reaches for her: then, her arms come out, and push and claw at him, refusing to let him come close. Her breathing gets shallower and more erratic, as she tries to suck in a breath, and is interrupted by an uncontrollable sob.</em>
</p><p>'<em>Calista,' he says, voice breaking with concern, 'Breathe. You're going to make yourself sick.'</em></p><p>"It's the memory," Calista told him, her own voice wavering, because she remembered, now; she felt a sick, heavy feeling in her gut, and suddenly she no longer felt detached, like she was watching some other terrified, wounded little girl. She <em>was</em> that girl, and as the truth of that hit her, the heavy, brocade thread of the memories began winding itself into the fabric of her mind, and suddenly she felt too heavy to stand on her own. "She remembers — being pressed into the cushion of the sofa. She — that's why she can't breathe."</p><p>She sagged against her father, and he tightened his grip, held her strong.</p><p>"We're almost at the end," he reassured her, while the girl in the vision tried to explain the very same thing to his younger self that her ten-years-older counterpart had just done:</p><p>'<em>C-can't,' she chokes, 'H-help me! M-make her - make her stop!'</em></p><p>'<em>There's no one else here,' he tells her, with a finality in his tone. 'She's in Azkaban. You're safe.'</em></p><p>
  <em>Finally, this seems to penetrate; some of the terror in her eyes shifts and melts; her eyes shine with unshed tears, but they stop darting around.</em>
</p><p>'<em>She - she's gone?' the girl whispers, visibly desperate for the confirmation. She shivers again, and the man uses the opportunity to edge closer to her.</em></p><p>
  <em>He confirms it. 'Locked up, far away.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The girl stiffens again, as another tremor shakes her frame. 'What if she gets out?'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man reaches for her again, swiftly and smoothly this time, and tucks the little girl against him, gently pressing her head to his shoulder. 'I don't think that will happen,' he says.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She lets him comfort her for a moment, and when her voice comes again, it is muffled by his shoulder. 'What if she does?'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man swallows, and his eyes glitter. He leans over, puts his mouth right near her ear, and speaks very quietly.</em>
</p><p>From where Calista stood, she couldn't even hear him, his words were so soft; but she didn't need to hear the memory-Severus, because the real Severus leaned over, and murmured the same thing in her ear, in real-time.</p><p>"I will protect you," he told her, solemnly. "I won't let her hurt you again."</p><p>Calista shivered, and made a small, inadvertent yelp in her throat again; she clenches her jaw against the threat of tears.</p><p>She looked back at the pair from the memory.</p><p>
  <em>The little girl lifts her head, and regards the man solemnly, eyes wide and voice wobbling.</em>
</p><p>'<em>I was lying before,' she says, 'When I said I wanted to go back.'</em></p><p>
  <em>The man answers her in kind, with solemn eyes and a crack in his voice that hints at a concealed waver.</em>
</p><p>'<em>I'm glad to hear that, since I was never going to send you back, anyway.'</em></p><p>'<em>Never? Even if I'm really, really mean and I never do what you say?' The little girl sounds wary, and there is a naked hope in her face; she hangs onto the man's response, like she's drowning and his words are a rope to safety.</em></p><p>'<em>Not even then,' he tells her, with unmistakable finality, 'Although I sincerely hope, for both of our sakes, that that isn't your plan.'</em></p><p>"Well," Calista managed, forcing a mirthless, stuttered laugh, "I'm afraid it was, for a while, at least."</p><p>"Isn't it still?" he murmured back, teasingly, squeezing her shoulder again.</p><p>
  <em>The little girl isn't finished questioning him. 'Will anyone else come take me?' she asks, 'To a different house, again?'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He brushes a lock of hair off her forehead, reading her face. 'Do you want them to?'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She shakes her head, fiercely. 'I don't like anyone else,' she confides, 'Except… except you.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A funny expression crosses the man's face, and it takes him a moment to respond. 'Well,' he finally says, 'No one else is going to come and take you.'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She seems satisfied with this; she nods, and drops her head back onto his shoulder. She settles herself against him, and for a moment, she doesn't look traumatised; her face is peaceful, and her eyes drift closed.</em>
</p><p>The room swirled around them again, and suddenly, they were back on solid ground, in the dim little kitchen of their Spinner's End home.</p><p>Outside, the rain had intensified, from a spotty drizzle to a steady patter against the windows. The dim, grey light that filtered through hadn't changed; incredibly, it looked like almost no time had passed, and Calista shook her head, briefly disoriented.</p><p>It felt like another day entirely; it felt like it might even be years later than it had been, when they'd first stepped into this kitchen and leaned close over the shallow silver bowl.</p><p>Severus shifted his grip on her, and turned her towards him; for a second, she met his gaze, instantly reading the concern within.</p><p>Suddenly, she wasn't in the mood for it; everything she'd just seen was writhing through her - not just through her mind, but, it seemed, through her gut, through her heart, through her very bones and blood. She dropped her eyes away from his, took a step back.</p><p>"Are you all right?" he murmured, and she knew him well enough to detect the slight edge of helplessness beneath the worry.</p><p>She felt very tired suddenly, and very heavy. Even opening her mouth to respond to his question seemed like an immense task.</p><p>"You knew I wouldn't be," she reminded him, woodenly, shaking his grip off entirely. "You knew that better than I did."</p><p>It was strange; while they'd stood within the vision, she'd repeatedly felt the sting of tears, had been on the edge of letting them fall for what felt like years — but no, it was still the same dismal, grey morning. Now, she felt simultaneously leaden and jittery; like snakes were writhing around inside her body, hissing and threatening to bite, and she could even feel their weight, added to hers.</p><p>"I'm going upstairs," she told him, with finality. He stepped closer; she could hear the swish of his robes, see one foot coming towards her. "I'm going to bed."</p><p>"It's only half past ten," he sounded slightly bewildered.</p><p>"I don't care. I'm tired."</p><p>"Calista…"</p><p>She ignored him, even though some distant part of her knew it wasn't fair. She <em>knew</em> how much he cared, how deeply he felt the same pain, the same awful gaping sadness from the memories that she did, and yet…</p><p>She felt some of the weight fall off, with every stair she took; like one of the little snakes slithered out of her with each individual footfall. She glanced back at the first landing, half-expecting to see them wriggling their way up after her.</p><p>She climbed all the way up to her attic room, and lowered herself onto her bed without remembering the walk, as if she were in a trance. She curled up with her her back flat against the headboard, tucking her knees under her chin.</p><p>Her eyes turned down the length of the room, towards the trapdoor she hadn't had the energy to close behind her, focused on nothing, seeing nothing; not even the heavy, wriggling little snakes of memory that she knew were slowly creeping towards her.</p><p>That was the thing about being haunted; you couldn't always see your tormentors, but that didn't make them any less real.</p><p>
  <strong>(¯ˆ·.¸¸.·ˆ¯)</strong>
</p><p>Severus slept restlessly that night, and woke early, before the sun. He went into the kitchen and opened the kitchen window, wide, so the <em>Daily Prophet</em> could be delivered. Of course, the damn owl was coming later and later these days. It had never been a problem when they'd lived in London, but now that they were in a no-name suburb of Manchester, it sometimes didn't come until nearly lunchtime.</p><p>Since his plans to turn the attic room into a workshop for himself had obviously been disrupted, he used the kitchen when he needed to brew a potion. It was cramped, and the table was the wrong height, and by the time he'd finished a Calming Draught and was bottling it, he had a painful crick in his neck, and was yearning for his workroom at the castle.</p><p>The sun was well over the horizon when Severus set the newly-stoppered flasks away in a cupboard, and set to rinsing out his cauldron in the too-small sink, and <em>still</em> the paper hadn't come. He needed a distraction, something to keep his hands and his mind engaged, so he could resist the temptation to pester Calista, to force her to speak with him.</p><p>He had gone up to check on her several times yesterday, and she'd been the same: closed off, unwilling to talk. She needed time to process the memories before she could really talk about it; he knew that, had even been warned by the Headmaster that the acclimation process would likely be difficult because of the length of time she'd been separated from the memories. And still, his instinct told him to pull her close anyway, so they could comfort each other. After all, the memories might be new to <em>her</em>, but he'd been familiar with them all along, and they ate at him now, acidic and fresh.</p><p>At least she had been sleeping, the fourth and final time he'd gone upstairs, sometime around midnight. She had looked slightly fitful, but not enough for him to wake her. Not enough to alarm him. It was better, surely, than the other times he'd gone up, when she'd only stared through him wordlessly, a mirror of the distant, haunted girl they'd witnessed in her memories.</p><p>He would give her a few days, and then they would <em>have</em> talk. In the meantime, he supposed he ought to make breakfast, and rouse her from sleep so that she could eat, even if she didn't want to talk.</p><p>He glanced out the kitchen window, toward the horizon again as he set a frying pan on the stove. He squinted against the morning sun; there, was that the shape of an owl in the distance, or only a trick of his eyes?</p><p>An insistent knock came from the direction of the front door, suddenly, and Severus nearly dropped the frying pan on his foot in surprise. Who the <em>hell</em> could possibly at the door, at — he checked his watch — nine o'clock on a Saturday morning?</p><p>He grimaced waspishly, and strode for the door. Some Muggle salesman or missionary, no doubt, though why in Merlin's name they'd bother with this decrepit neighborhood, he couldn't say. He swung the door open, and nearly blinked in surprise.</p><p>"Mr. Boot," he said, taking in the familiar sight of a particular teenaged boy on his doorstep, "Calista neglected to tell me she was expecting you to visit, today."</p><p>Had she written to him last night? He hadn't seen her owl leave; but she must have. He supposed that was probably a good sign.</p><p>"Erm, that's because she's not," Boot said, and Severus noticed that the boy's usual careful cheer, the cautious smile he had offered Severus on his last few visits, were absent. Instead, his brow creased with worry, and a frown pulled the corners of his mouth down. "Sir, is she — has she seen it, yet?"</p><p>Severus did blink, now. Since when had his daughter's relationship with this boy progressed to a point where he felt he could simply drop by, unplanned and unannounced?</p><p>"I came as soon as I saw," Boot continued, in an anxious tone, "I know I should have written her I was coming, but I just — I knew it would be awful for her, and I wanted to get here as quickly as I could."</p><p>"Saw <em>what</em>, Mr Boot?" Severus asked, a bit sharply.</p><p>"The paper," Boot said, slightly bewildered, "The <em>Daily Prophet</em> article. She… she hasn't seen it yet, then?"</p><p>"If you're referencing an article in today's paper, <em>I </em>haven't seen it yet," Severus snarled, opening the door wider, and turning away. He strode back in the direction of the kitchen, assuming Boot would follow him in, but not quite inviting him to do so. "The damn thing's always late."</p><p>As if he'd summoned it, an owl swooped through the kitchen window just as he reached the doorway, dropping the paper into the sink.</p><p>"Blasted bird," Severus muttered, snatching the paper out before it could get wet from the remnant water he'd left behind when he'd rinsed his cauldron out. The owl took off, perhaps sensing it wasn't getting a tip for that day's delivery, while Severus unfurled the paper.</p><p>The first thing he saw was a wild, barely recognisable man, staring insolently at him through a mane of lank, matted hair. The second thing he noticed was a headline that froze his blood.</p><p>
  <em>INFAMOUS MASS-MURDERER SIRIUS BLACK ESCAPES AZKABAN, CURRENTLY AT-LARGE: PUBLIC URGED TO REPORT ANY SUSPICIOUS SIGHTINGS.</em>
</p><p>Severus swore, and jerked back into the sitting room; Boot was still lurking, uncertain, on the doorstep, behind the half-open door, and Severus waved him in impatiently, brandishing the paper with a shaking hand.</p><p>Boot slipped into the room, and eased the door shut behind him.</p><p>"The article says they don't know how he did it," the boy murmured, "That's going to terrify her…"</p><p>"Yes, it will," Severus agreed, grimly. He swore again.</p><p>"They'll catch him soon, though," Boot tried and failed to inject a hopeful note into his words, "They've got to, they've got all of wizarding Britain on the alert, and - the article said they're even going to tell the Muggle Prime Minister to print his picture in <em>their</em> newspapers. Once they've got him, they've got to make him explain how he got out, so no one else can use the same tricks."</p><p>"It hardly matters right now <em>how</em> he did it," Severus said, with a worried glance towards the bookshelf that concealed the door to the stairs. Had he imagined hearing her footfalls? "This is — Boot, this is worse than you even realise."</p><p>"I don't see how that could be," the boy said, "I realise it's… abysmally awful."</p><p>"She knew him," Severus told the boy quietly, because he couldn't very well tell the boy the rest of it, tell him <em>why</em> Calista was in no state to receive this news today, of all days. "Sirius Black."</p><p>The name twisted and stung its way out of his mouth.</p><p>"Did he…" Boot swallowed, and his frown pulled down even further. "Did he hurt her?"</p><p>"I don't know," Severus told the boy honestly, "But he's her mother's cousin, and he's the one that delivered her to —"</p><p>He cut himself off; he realised he didn't know whether Calista had ever told Boot that she'd lived in an orphanage for a time, when she was young.</p><p>"You don't think," Boot had paled considerably, "You don't think he's going to help <em>her</em> try to escape, do you?"</p><p>Severus' blood felt like ice in his veins, and yet somehow it was bubbling up, like lava.</p><p>"I'll kill her myself," Severus hissed, "If she escapes — if she comes near —"</p><p>"She won't," Boot said, and his voice was steely despite the fact that it shook, slightly. "I mean — she probably won't escape, but if she does… she <em>won't</em> get near Calista. And he — Sirius Black — <em>he</em> won't get near Calista, either. We… you and I, sir… we won't let them."</p><p>Severus' gaze flicked over the boy, instinctively assessing.</p><p>"Black and Lestrange are a pair of ruthless mass murderers," he reminded the boy, in a tone as sharp and cold as steel, "Infamous for their crimes, as well as for the master they committed them for; I don't imagine you can even comprehend the depravity of some of those crimes. And you claim to be willing to stand between them, and my daughter?"</p><p>Boot didn't waver. He nodded grimly, straightening his spine and squaring his narrow shoulders. "If I have to, yes."</p><p>Severus noticed that the boy's fingers had curled instinctively around his wand; if there was deception or insincerity in his eyes, Severus couldn't find it.</p><p>"Stay here," Severus said, after silence had stretched between them for several seconds. He jerked his head towards the sofa, but he didn't wait to see if Boot sat or not; instead, he drew his wand, and tapped it to the bookshelf to his left, causing it to swing open and reveal the staircase behind it.</p><p>Once he had heard the door snap closed behind him, he started up the stairs.</p><p>
  <strong>(¯ˆ·.¸¸.·ˆ¯)</strong>
</p><p>Calista stared blankly at the inside of her wardrobe, fingers still clutched at the edge of its door, as if it was holding her up.</p><p>She knew she'd been up here too long, since her father had gone back downstairs; knew she'd been standing just here, unable to turn her mind to what she should put on, unable to turn her mind to much of anything, for at least twenty minutes.</p><p>She could only replay what Severus had told her, again and again.</p><p>Not <em>Mr. Boot is here; he's downstairs</em>. Her mind could work its way around that, even if she was surprised and even if today was <em>not</em> a day she was particularly keen to see him - <em>or was she</em>?</p><p>It was the other thing he'd said that was swirling through her mind, and holding her hands and feet still.</p><p><em>It wasn't her</em>, Severus had begun, and she'd known that whatever he'd come up to tell her was going to be awful. Nothing, though, could have prepared her for how awful it truly was.</p><p><em>It wasn't her</em>, Severus had repeated, <em>But there's been — Calista, the first thing I need you to understand is that you are safe, you are perfectly safe. No one is going to hurt you, not while I'm living.</em></p><p>Her heart had begun to pound, but she hadn't been able to make her mouth work, hadn't been able to push any words out of her throat.</p><p><em>I'm afraid</em>, he'd continued, and she'd felt the truth of those two words as if he'd shouted them, <em>I'm afraid there's been a breach — of course he will be recaptured soon, perhaps he has been already, but — there has been an escape, from Azkaban, Calista. Sirius Black has escaped.</em></p><p>He had said a whole lot of other things, after that; that the Ministry was searching every corner, that the Muggles were on alert as well, that security at the infamous prison was being watched more intently than ever, that there was absolutely no reason to believe anyone else would escape, or that Black would be at large for very long.</p><p>It wasn't until he stopped telling her things, until he <em>asked</em> her something, that she'd been able to speak.</p><p>
  <em>Calista, please, say something. Tell me if you're all right; Tell me, do you understand what I'm telling you?</em>
</p><p><em>I'm fine</em>, she'd said, automatically, but fiercely, stubbornly, and then, <em>Go away. I have to get dressed.</em></p><p>He'd fussed and frowned before he'd finally gone, reminding her that Gerald was downstairs too, and that she should come down when she was ready. When he'd finally gone, he'd muttered something about making breakfast, even though Calista didn't think she'd ever eat again in her life; her stomach felt like every single one of the little phantom memory-snakes was inside of it, and they'd given up slithering and wriggling and had gone straight to biting, to sinking their fangs into her, devouring her from the inside out.</p><p>She shook her head, glancing down as if expecting to see blood seeping through her yellow nightdress, but of course — like all the worst kinds of pain — like the Cruciatus Curse itself — the things that were hurting her, that were tearing her apart, were invisible.</p><p>"I have to get dressed," she murmured; it was the last thing she'd said to her father, and she said it again, and again, until the words made sense and finally eased her into action.</p><p>She pried her fingers off the edge of the wardrobe door, and reached into the depths of her massive collection of clothing, pulling out the first thing her fingers landed on. It was a dress, a summery yellow dress in an impossibly light fabric.</p><p>Like all the rest of her clothes, it had come from her aunt. She supposed it was a very pretty dress, but she had never worn it, because she thought the neckline was too low and the hem too short; except for the colour, it seemed like something Olivia Avril would wear, and so Calista had never wanted to.</p><p>She changed into it, felt the airy fabric settle over her, and then she opened the wardrobe door wider, so she could see herself in the long mirror that was hung on the inside.</p><p>She felt something bubble up inside her; when her throat opened up, and her mouth did, and sound came out, she realised she was <em>laughing</em>.</p><p>The dress wasn't really as short or as low-cut as she'd thought. It was actually quite a lovely dress, and the colour was like sunshine, enchanting and uplifting.</p><p>The dress was — and this was why she was laughing — the dress was the visual equivalent of the lie she'd told her father, of the lie she told <em>everyone</em>.</p><p><em>I'm fine</em>. That's what the dress was saying. Calista closed the wardrobe door, and went downstairs.</p><p>
  <strong>(¯ˆ·.¸¸.·ˆ¯)</strong>
</p><p>The first thing Calista noticed, when she pushed open the door at the bottom of the stairs, was the <em>smell</em>.</p><p>Something smelled absolutely fantastic - like garlic, and parsley, and a myriad of other fresh, delicious things. Something smelled so wonderfully enticing that Calista, who had moments ago truthfully thought she might never eat again, was suddenly and violently <em>hungry</em>.</p><p>The second thing she noticed, as she stepped into the sitting room, was that her father was in it, standing at the centre and watching the stairs expectantly, a look of worry twisting his features.</p><p>The third thing she noticed was a low, gentle sizzle; the sound of something cooking. But… if her father was <em>here</em>…</p><p>"Who's cooking?" she asked, "And <em>what</em> are they cooking?"</p><p>"Mr. Boot insisted that he wanted to make breakfast. I told him you… probably wouldn't be in a mood to eat much, but —"</p><p>"<em>Gerald's</em> cooking?" Calista said, feeling her eyebrows go up; then she felt a hollow, rolling storm in her gut, and she was about to blame the imaginary snakes — but then she realised that their aggressive writhing wasn't the sensation she'd felt at all — it wasn't even their phantom fangs, venomous and sharp.</p><p>"I'm <em>starving</em>," she said, and it was true. She went into the kitchen, and — just as Severus had said, there was Gerald, with a cluster of ingredients she hadn't even realised they had in the house spread over the worktop; he was carefully pulling something out of the oven, something that emitted a cloud of fragrant steam when he set it on top of the stove.</p><p>She took a deep breath, and felt her stomach growl again. Well; she had discovered the source of the delicious smell, at any rate.</p><p>"What <em>is</em> that?" she asked, stepping closer.</p><p>Gerald looked at her; she saw his eyes widen, and faint spots of pink appeared on his cheeks. She supposed it must have been from the heat of the dish he'd just taken out.</p><p>"It's — erm, it's a breakfast casserole. A little bit of everything, really. Eggs, potatoes, onions, leeks — oh, and bacon. Normally, I use sausage, but — I remember you said you didn't like it, so I used bacon instead."</p><p>"It smells fantastic." She stepped even closer, and peered into the casserole dish. It looked as good as it smelled.</p><p>Gerald blushed deeply. "It's… nothing, really. I mean — I make it a lot, at home."</p><p>Severus stepped into the kitchen then, sidestepping Calista and opening the cupboard where they kept an array of mismatched dishes. He removed three plates, and three mugs, and only <em>then</em> did Calista realise that there was a full pot of coffee on the far counter, and a pot of hot water for tea on the stove. Severus passed the stack of plates to Gerald, and busied himself filling two of the mugs with coffee.</p><p>In a moment, Calista had been ushered into one of the three rickety, mismatched chairs, with a mug of steaming black coffee thrust into her hand. A fragrant, steaming plate of Gerald's casserole was set in front of her too, and a fork.</p><p>She ate half of it before she even remembered the coffee, in her hand. She realised that Gerald and her father, though they <em>had</em> each sat down with their own plates and mugs, were watching her. Gerald, at least, was trying to pretend he wasn't. She saw him hastily pick up his own fork and look away, when she met his gaze.</p><p>She scowled, and then lifted her mug, draining a third of the cup's contents in one sip. The dark, acrid coffee burned on its way down her throat; somehow, she found it comforting. She took another, smaller sip, and then set the mug carefully down.</p><p>"I don't know how you can drink that stuff like that," Gerald ventured. She glanced across at him, and noticed he had the string of a teabag dangling from his own mug.</p><p>"Coffee is fantastic," she said, "You don't know what you're missing."</p><p>"Oh, I do. Fantastic isn't the word I'd use though," he teased back. He took an assessing look at her, and then nodded. He picked up his fork, and started to eat.</p><p>"This is fantastic, too," Calista said, attacking her own plate of food again. It was; it was possibly one of the most delicious things she had ever eaten. Every bite was cooked perfectly, and very well seasoned. "I can't believe you made this."</p><p>"It's nothing," Gerald said again, but he looked — despite everything, despite the reason for his visit; despite the sinister grey roll of the paper on the corner of the worktop that Calista knew must be the newspaper that had brought him here — he looked quite pleased.</p><p>Between the three of them, they made short work of the casserole. Calista had two large helpings, and another full mug of coffee, and then she felt utterly full.</p><p>There was something, though — with the food, and the coffee, and the sunlight that streamed in through the open kitchen window, soaking into her skin — she realised she was so full that there was no longer any room for any of the vicious, wriggling snakes.</p><p>That didn't mean, of course, that any of her demons had gone away — even the most delicious breakfast in the world, which she suspected she might have just eaten, couldn't do <em>that</em>. But still — the ghosts, the memories, the hurt… they were within her, still, but they no longer felt quite like they were consuming her.</p><p>She picked up her plate, and carried it over to the sink. Severus was already standing, and he plucked it out of her hands.</p><p>"Since Mr. Boot did all of the cooking," he said, quietly. "I suppose I'll clean up. You go on into the sitting room, both of you. I'll be in shortly."</p><p>Calista obeyed, and she felt Gerald's presence behind her, heard the creak of the loose floorboard in the sitting room as he followed her in. Calista heard the faucet turn on behind them.</p><p>Perhaps it was the dimmer lighting — the sun didn't hit the window at the same angle, in this room — or perhaps it was just the snakes returning after all, but Calista suddenly felt heavier, again. She sank onto the sofa, and clutched her hands together, in her lap, in case they decided to start shaking.</p><p>She thought Gerald might sit beside her, and she thought that might be okay, as long as he didn't say anything, as long as he didn't ask her if she was all right — because, for once, she wasn't certain she was capable of repeating the same lie, the one that her dress was already telling him.</p><p>He didn't, though; instead, he crouched on the floor in front of her, so their eyes would have been level if she'd dared to look up at him, and he reached for both of her hands with his.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, Calista," he said, quietly. "I know you must feel frightened, and traumatised, and — frankly, plain awful. I don't know if there's anything I can say or do to make you feel even the tiniest bit better, but if there is, I hope you know I'll do it."</p><p>"I hate that word," she finally said, when she found her voice. The sounds of running water, and of dishes clattering gently together in the kitchen told them that Severus was still busy.</p><p>"Which word?"</p><p>"<em>Traumatised</em>." She practically spit it out, felt it skitter past her lips like a venomous spider, on stiff, pointed legs. Something moved, beyond Gerald's shoulder, and she looked up, instinctively following the motion.</p><p>It was only Yellow; evidently, he'd been napping underneath the armchair at the other side of the room, and he eased himself out from under it now, stretched, and yawned. His pink tongue rolled up, and then he seemed to spot Calista; he closed his mouth, and bounded across the room, leaping up onto the sofa to settle beside her.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Gerald said again, steadily. "I'll try not to use it again."</p><p>"Why not?" she mused, extracting one of her hands from his, and reaching out to stroke her cat's soft grey forehead instead. "It's what I am, isn't it?"</p><p>"It's not the only thing you are," Gerald ventured. It reminded her of something her father had said, when she'd asked him the same question.</p><p>"I suppose sometimes it feels like it is," she said, very quietly. She still didn't want to look at him, so she looked over at the cat again; and then, suddenly, something broke loose in her chest, something that — like nearly everything — she'd been holding onto for a very long time.</p><p>"Do you want to know why I named him Yellow?" Calista asked, in the same hushed tone; her eyes were still fixed on the cat, fingers rubbing behind his ears. He purred appreciatively, and nudged his head against her leg, against the light, shimmery fabric of her deceptively cheerful dress.</p><p>"If you want to tell me," Gerald murmured, evenly. His fingers rubbed against the inside of her palm; she hadn't even realised, at first, that he had been doing that, or that it was actually, strangely comforting.</p><p>"I always wanted a cat," she said. She couldn't even remember, now, how she'd come to be aware of the fact that cats could be kept as pets; certainly, she hadn't learned it from her mother. As far as her mother had taught her, only <em>she</em> could be kept like that.</p><p>"I knew I'd never have one, of course; the way things were… I knew I'd never have anything that wasn't — that didn't hurt. I don't know if I can describe… but then, you already know, don't you? Your father… I don't have to."</p><p>She drew in a breath. Dimly, she was aware that the water in the kitchen had stopped, though there were still various muffled sounds, cupboards opening and closing, chairs being shifted.</p><p>"I guess most children — other children — are different than I was. I guess they have toys, and games, and — and things they like to do. I didn't… I never had any of that. I mean, I suppose I did - there were dolls and things, in my room, though I don't know where they came from, because I can't imagine she bought them for me. Perhaps Aunt Narcissa did; I don't know. But it didn't matter, because I never played with them. I never looked forward to anything, I never asked for anything, I never — I never did anything, except try to hide, and try to imagine that she was going to go away, someday."</p><p>Gerald shifted, perhaps to ease some of the weight off his knees; he did slip onto the sofa beside her now, on the opposite side from where Yellow still purred obviously. He kept one of his hands on her free one, twining his fingers securely between hers.</p><p>"I suppose the only fitting word for <em>then</em> — for everything, for the way all of it was, every day — is horror. For a long time, I think that's all I really knew. And then, when good things started to happen — when someone — believe it or not, it was <em>him</em>, it was Sirius Black — when he took me away from her, to a house full of strangers, and they seemed so <em>different</em> from what I knew… I didn't have the word then, but now I know they were… well, they were <em>kind</em>…"</p><p>Gerald's other hand had slipped behind her back, and was gently tracing careful circles over the delicate fabric of her dress. There weren't any sounds coming from the kitchen, now, though Severus still didn't appear.</p><p>"When things like that started happening, I didn't believe it. I was suspicious; I <em>knew</em>, somehow, that she had planned it, that it was a trick, and that if I fell for it, things would only be worse when she did come back for me. Only, she didn't. That man, Sirius — he brought me somewhere else, after a while — the orphanage, and that was… a different kind of horror, I suppose. I never saw him again, or any of the other people from that strange house. I never saw <em>her</em> again either, but I also never stopped expecting to."</p><p>Gerald's fingers still moved, the left hand rubbing the inside of her palm, and the right continuing to move over her shoulders, and her upper back, in a soothing pattern of motion. Despite everything, it <em>was</em> comforting. A light, trembling shiver passed over her shoulders, and it wasn't fear. It was something nice.</p><p>"My dad found out about me, somehow — I've actually never asked how — and he came to get me, and <em>that</em> was something I believed even less than I believed any of the other kindness I'd seen. It had to be a trick; because the longer I was with him, the more things began to change. He kept telling me that she was gone, that I was safe, and that — that he <em>cared about me</em>, and I can't — I don't know how to explain what that was like, for someone who had never even really understood the concept of caring at all."</p><p>"Oh, sweetheart," Gerald murmured, sadly; Calista blinked. He had never called her that before, at least not in English. Like his fingers against her palm, and his hand on her back, she thought it was, in that moment, at least, comforting. A reminder that there were a great many people now, including him, that <em>cared about her</em>.</p><p>"Eventually, I believed him. About — about caring, but also about <em>her</em> being… gone. Locked up. And then… once I didn't have to worry <em>all</em> the time, once I didn't have to spend every minute in fear… I started to notice things I never had before. I started to… I started to <em>like</em> things. Flowers, and sunshine, and snow. Blueberries, and bacon, and… animals besides cats. Rabbits and owls. Birds. Thestrals. Unicorns, even though I've never seen one. I realised I really liked the colour yellow, I think because of the flowers and the sun… it was the very first <em>favourite</em> thing that I ever remember having. And so… so when I finally got a cat, like I'd always wanted… he was my favourite, and so I named him after the only other 'favourite' thing I had. I named him Yellow."</p><p>Gerald was quiet; when she finally dared to glance at his face, she was startled to realise that he was <em>crying</em>; his brown eyes were dewy, and a tear rolled underneath the rim of his glasses, falling until it reached his mouth; it paused there, suspended on the ridge of his upper lip.</p><p>"I don't think I —" Calista started in a shaky voice, and then she shook her head; suddenly, she felt like she might start crying herself. "No, I <em>know </em>I've never told anyone that, before."</p><p>Gerald sniffed, and he let go of her hand, reaching up to swipe rather roughly at another tear, one that had just dropped from his eye. She noticed that he was nowhere near as gentle, when brushing his own tear aside, as he had been with hers, several weeks ago. It felt like years ago, now.</p><p>"I'm sorry," he managed, a bit breathily, "I don't mean to - I just…"</p><p>"Yeah," Calista said, a bit hollowly; still, she was starting to feel… not better, precisely, but — for the first time in two days, she was starting to <em>feel</em> something that encompassed more than just fear, more than just pain. "I know; it's not really a very happy story."</p><p>"No, it's not," he agreed; even though he reached up again, and brushed another tear away, the first one still trembled, intact, on the crease of his mouth. "It is — beautiful, though. The name, and the reason."</p><p>She was fixated on the tear now, and suddenly the hollowness inside of her started to hum and vibrate with something else, a feeling that was nothing like anything she expected to be feeling… and yet, she <em>was.</em></p><p>She realised that she wanted, desperately, to kiss him; to press her lips against his, to have that single tear dissolve between their mouths. She wanted to remind herself that she wasn't that girl, anymore; that she wasn't alone, and that a great many things in her life, now, were — as Gerald had just described, beautiful.</p><p>"Gerald…" she whispered, and she could both hear and feel her voice trembling. She felt something warm slip down her cheek, and she realised that <em>she</em> was crying, too. And then she felt a faint tickle, at the corner of her mouth, and she realised she had a tear stalled there, too.</p><p>She sucked in a tentative, uncertain sort of breath, and then she glanced towards the doorway; despite the silence from the kitchen, there was still no sign of Severus.</p><p>She leaned forward, and she did exactly the thing she wanted to; she pressed her mouth to his, and she lifted both of her hands up to his face, cupping his jaw. She felt a drop of moisture, underneath one of her palms — and she felt the tears between their mouths dissolve, just as she'd expected; and then, she forgot about the tears, forgot about everything except the feel of Gerald, of their lips together, of the line of his jaw under her hands.</p><p>Suddenly, his hands were over hers, and he pulled them gently away, lifting and holding them a few centimetres away from his face. He pulled back about the same distance, and looked at her, with those soft, brown eyes. For a second, she wondered if she'd been too bold, but — the <em>look</em> in those eyes wasn't telling her so; it was telling her that he was enjoying their kissing as much as she was.</p><p>"Calista," he murmured, "You've had a shock today; you're — vulnerable. Are you certain…?"</p><p>"Yes," she said, despite the fact that her father was undoubtedly still in the next room, and that she hated the word <em>vulnerable</em> almost as much as she hated <em>traumatised, </em>not least of all because they were both true. Still, she was telling him the truth; she felt that, in her bones, and in her heart.</p><p>"Yes," she said, again, when he still didn't look convinced, "Yes, I've had a shock — more than one, actually, and yes, I am — <em>vulnerable</em> — and, yes, I want to keep kissing you. I'm… quite certain."</p><p>She did hear a noise from the kitchen now; it was the sound of the door, the <em>back</em> door, that led to the yard, opening and then closing. And then… silence, again. She waited for footsteps, but they never came. Did that mean that her father had gone <em>outside</em>, then? She supposed he could have a letter to post; they kept their owls caged outside.</p><p>"Well, then," Gerald said softly, and he brought her hands in close again, let them settle back against the sides of his face, "If you're certain…"</p><p>He initiated the kiss this time, but soon, it didn't matter — it was both of them, wanting, and giving, and tasting. It was bittersweet, because part of the taste was the salt of their tears; the ones that had already fallen, and perhaps a few more in Calista's case; but there were other tastes too, and there was the softness of Gerald's mouth, the warmth of his skin, underneath her fingers — and then there was the devastatingly light touch, of his fingertips gently rounding the edge of her ear, and, with the other hand, brushing the contours of her chin, her jaw, the side of her neck.</p><p>Nothing, not even the most heartfelt, wonderful kiss, could drive away her many ghosts, the pain of her memories — but she found that they had shifted, somehow, and that, even though she still felt them acutely — even though they still ached and pulled her towards a dark place — there was room for other things, brighter things, as well.</p><p>There was room for things like sunshine, and yellow flowers, and a cat with an ill-fitting name; there was room for joy, and for feeling things that filled her up rather than hollowed her out. There was room for the protective love of a parent who would truly, gladly set his own life aside for her the betterment of hers; and there was room for a warm, sweet kiss from a boy who had beautiful eyes and an unbearably light touch, and who always opened a book to the index page first.</p><p>
  <strong>(¯ˆ·.¸¸.·ˆ¯)</strong>
</p><p>Slowly, as summer progressed, Calista began to thaw. In the first few weeks after her memories had been returned, there had been many times her eyes had gone blank, empty.</p><p>There had been many times she withdrew, both physically and emotionally; not only from him, Severus, but also from Boot, when he came over - an occurrence that happened at least twice weekly, after his unannounced appearance on the day the news about Black had broken.</p><p>He had advised Boot not to let Calista withdraw, but there were times when she could not be coaxed away from doing it, by either one of them, and there were times when attempting to force it only angered her; both of them, unfortunately, ended up on the receiving end of her ire more than once, that summer.</p><p>Both of them, though, found ways to draw her out; more often, it would happen on sunny days, and after she had eaten a full meal. Boot insisted on cooking nearly every time he came over, and even Severus had to admit, the boy certainly had talent in that regard; Merlin knew, getting Calista to willingly eat a second helping of <em>anything</em> was nearly a miracle in itself.</p><p>The more miraculous thing was that, even though she snapped and snarled at both of them — at Severus quite a bit more often than at Boot, if truth be told — she <em>also</em> opened up to both of them.</p><p>Severus had had the idea to brew potions with her again, as they done when she was small, and as they'd done during most of the past school year. Despite the cramped kitchen, the less than ideal workspace, or perhaps <em>because </em>of it — she talked, almost always while their hands were moving and their eyes were on bottles and recipes. She told him other things she had remembered, bits and pieces of her past. She told him about her nightmares, both past and present; and she admitted that, even though they had gotten worse at first, the dreams were starting to taper, now.</p><p>She'd opened up more to Boot, too; he'd overheard, one day, an idea the boy had had. He'd heard the boy confess that he liked to speak to her in French sometimes not only because — and Severus' lip had curled, inadvertently, when he'd heard the first part — but not only because it was romantic, and made her blush; <em>also</em> because it was easier, sometimes, to say something that seemed embarrassing or difficult to say, if he said it in another language.</p><p>Boot had suggested that, if there were something she wanted him to know but which was difficult to tell him, she might try saying it Latin, which both of them understood; she'd scoffed at first, but then he'd heard them, a few times, and he'd even glimpsed her sending a letter that appeared to be written entirely in the ancient language.</p><p>As she warmed, as she thawed — as she, as she'd put it earlier in the summer, <em>recovered</em> — she began to see her other friends again, too. The Slater girl came over twice, towards the end of the summer, and she'd gone to London with her, Boot, and Miss Folland again.</p><p>He had a hard time saying no to anything she asked for that summer, truth be told; in the earlier part of the summer, it had been because of the horror that lay before her, in the recovered memory, and in the later part of the summer it was partly because of that same horror that lay <em>behind </em>her, and partly because she seemed, somehow, to be coping with the idea of the escapee Black, being at large.</p><p>If <em>he</em> lost sleep at night, tossed and turned with fearful imaginings that the foul, twisted murderer Black would creep up on her and snatch her up, well, that was best kept to himself; because, perhaps <em>most</em> miraculously of all, <em>she</em> didn't seem to be caught up in that fear, even though she <em>had</em>, in some manner, been snatched up by him, many years ago.</p><p>He kept his fear to himself as best he could, because — as terrifying as he found the prospect of Black on the loose — there <em>was</em> something even more terrifying to him, and that was his daughter losing all of the progress she had made, all of the courage and strength she had gained, and becoming that terrified, isolated little girl, again. He'd glimpsed that, in the immediate aftermath of her returned memories, and <em>that</em> was the worst thing he could imagine.</p><p>In the final weeks of summer, despite the looming ghost of Black's prison escape robbing him of much-needed sleep, and tormenting him with visions that he'd wager would rival any of Calista's nightmares, despite two separate nights where her horrors had come back, had caused her to wake, screaming, remembering the knife dream — despite <em>all</em> of that, many more things happened that gave him hope.</p><p>He'd heard her, when her friend Amelia was staying the night and he'd gone up to fetch them for dinner, telling Amelia about the orphanage, and about her magical little diary; she'd told Amelia that she used to use it, sometimes, to write nasty things about the other girls in the orphanage that teased her, and then her friend had instantly and gleefully jumped in, speculating on what they'd write in the book about the Avril girl and a few others at school. The two of them had laughed, and had sounded so wonderfully <em>normal</em> that Severus almost questioned the fact that he'd ever worried Calista <em>wouldn't</em> be able to handle the memory.</p><p>He thought, too, that it was likely the first time she'd told Miss Slater, or any of her friends, much about her childhood, and even though he knew it was hard for her to tell, he thought it could only help for her to have more people close to her that understood, at least on some level, what she'd been through.</p><p>The other Ravenclaw, the Clearwater girl, had come over once with Amelia too, and the three of them had stayed up all night, playing wizard chess and borrowing his books — the less offensive, and less expensive ones, of course, and the fact that he let the two Ravenclaw girls put their talons one even <em>those </em>spoke to just how loathe he was, that summer, to deny Calista anything that might make her happy.</p><p>The thing that had given him the <em>most </em>hope, though, had occurred at the very end of the summer, only three days before term was meant to start again; two days after he'd reluctantly allowed Calista to go to London, alone with Boot, for the entire day so they could see a Muggle play he was interested in for his birthday, and go out to dinner afterwards.</p><p>He had paced the length of the ground level of their flat for the better part of that day, fretting that he'd somehow misjudged Boot - even though he knew he hadn't - or that Black would see them, or that she'd be hurt in any of the hundreds of other ways his paranoid mind could devise.</p><p>He was thinking along those lines again, while he was in the sitting room on <em>that</em> day, three days before term started, trying not to eavesdrop on whatever Boot and his daughter were up to in the kitchen. They'd brought in armfuls of books, and they'd both been copying runes when he'd last ducked his head in, but — they'd gone <em>quiet</em> again, and that normally meant that Boot had his blasted mouth on her, and even if he did like Boot a lot more than he'd ever liked Flint, he'd still prefer for <em>no one's</em> mouth to be on her —</p><p>He'd curled his lip, and bent his head low over his own book, determined not to spy, not to insert himself where he most <em>definitely</em> was not wanted, when he'd heard something completely unexpected, completely heartbreaking, and — that filled him completely with hope, as absurd as it seemed.</p><p>"<em>Interrogabo vos et ego aliquid,</em>" Calista had murmured, hesitantly; he'd barely heard well enough to translate the Latin. <em>There's something I'm going to ask you…</em></p><p>"<em>Ita est?</em>" Gerald had responded: <em>What is it?</em></p><p>Severus had perked his ears, despite himself, despite the fact that he knew whatever they were saying was very likely none of his business, or anything he would want to hear. Still… he leaned slightly towards the doorway, in his chair.</p><p>"<em>Operor vos…</em>" she'd begun — <em>Do you have...</em> and then, in a rush: "<em>Operor vos ullus cicatrices?</em>"</p><p>Severus sucked in a breath, soundlessly. <em>Do you have any scars</em>?</p><p>Boot didn't reply verbally, or else his response was so soft that Severus couldn't hear it. There was a long silence, stretching perhaps thirty or forty seconds, and then he heard Calista's voice again:</p><p>"<em>Habeo quoque</em>," she said, in a very small voice. <em>I have them, too</em>.</p><p>He did hear Boot's response, this time: "<em>Vis loqui?</em>". <em>Do you want to talk about it?</em></p><p>"No," she'd said, a bit more forcefully. "<em>Nondum. Paenitet me.</em>" <em>Not yet. I'm sorry.</em></p><p>There was another long silence, and then — faintly, the sound of quills scratching against parchment.</p><p>It wasn't everything; but it was more than she'd ever said before.</p>
