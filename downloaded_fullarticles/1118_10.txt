          <div class="userstuff"><p>It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order nevertheless l, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was redolent of the deepest loathing and he muttered all along the way out of the room.</p><p>”-comes back from Azkaban ordering pepole around, oh my poor mistress, what would she say if she saw what the house was like now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he’s back know and they say he’s a murder too-“</p><p>“Keep muttering and I will be a murder!” Said Sirius irritability, and then he slammed the door and the old house elf.</p><p>“Sirius he’s not right in the head” Said Hermione pleadingly, “I don’t think he realizes we can hear him.”</p><p>“He’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad orders from my mothers portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul litter shit.”</p><p>“If you just set him free,” Hermione said hopefully, “maybe if you would-”</p><p>“We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the order now,” said Sirius curtly. “And anyway the shock would kill him, why don’t you suggest he leaves this house and see how he takes it.”</p><p>Sirius walked across the room, where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect and cover hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed him. The tapestry looked immensely old, for it was faded and looked through doxies had gnawed it in a lot of places, nevertheless the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back( as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:</p><p>The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black</p><p>“Toujours Pur”</p><p>“Your not on here!” Harry said, after scanning the bottom of the tree closely.</p><p>“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small round charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. “My dear sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home-Kreachers quite fond off muttering that story under his breath.”</p><p>“You ran away from home?”</p><p>“When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I’d had enough.” </p><p>“Where did you go?” Asked Harry, staring at him.</p><p>“Your dads place,” Sirius said. “Your grandparents were really good about it they sort of adopted me as there second son. Yeah I camped out at your dads house during the school holidays, and then when I came of age at seventeen I got a decent place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent amount of gold when he died- he’s been wipped off here too, that is probably why- anyway, after that I looked after myself. I always knew that I was welcomed at Mr. and Ms. Potters house for lunch, though.”</p><p>“But. . . . . why did you. . . . .?”</p><p>“Leave?” Sirius smiles bitterly and ran his hand through his long unkep hair. “Because I hated them the whole lot of them, my parents with there pure blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal...my idiot sisters soft enough to believe them... that’s her.”</p><p>Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of tree, at the name</p><p>Regulus Black</p><p>A date of death(some 20 years previously) followed a date of birth.</p><p>“She was younger than me,” Sirius said, and a much better child and heir, as I was constantly remind.”</p><p>“But she died?” Harry said.</p><p>“Yeah, said Sirius. “Stupid idiot... they say she joined the death eaters.”</p><p>“Your kidding!”</p><p>“Come on Harry haven’t you seen enough of this house to know what kind of wizards my family were.” said Sirius testly.</p><p>“Were-were you’re parents death eaters as well?”</p><p>“No, no, but believe me, they thought that Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the wizarding race, getting rid of muggle borns, and having purebloods in charge of everything. They weren’t alone either, there were quite a few people who thought that he had the right idea, before he started showing his true colors, they thought he had the right idea about that kind of thing. They got cold feet when he showed what he was willing and prepared to do to get power though.</p><p>But I bet that my parents thought that Regulus was a right little princess for joining up at first.”</p><p>“Was she killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively.</p><p>“Oh, no,” said Sirius. No, she was killed by Voldemort. Or on his orders I doubt she was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I heard after she died, she got in so far, panicked, I don’t know about what probably what she was being asked to do or she was scared of going to Azkaban or being killed by an Auror, ether way she tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in you resignation to Voldemort. It’s a lifetime of service or death.”</p><p>“What happened to her child, after she died?” Hermione asked nervously.</p><p>“What are you talking about Regulus did not have a kid?!” Sirius said.</p><p>”It’s says she dose,” Hermione said pointing to a branch that was coming from Regulus’s. “See.”</p><p>Sirius and Harry lean down and look, and sure enough there was a branch coming off of Regulus’s and it said</p><p>Klaus-Black-Hargreevs</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>December 1984</p><p>She was drowning</p><p>She could feel the water in her lungs</p><p>And she fell the inferius tearing off her skin</p><p>Her eyes and lungs burned as the water got in them</p><p>She was going to die here</p><p>“What the fuck,”Sirius said “when did Regulus have a child?!” as he looked at the spot on the tapestry.</p><p>“Lunch is ready.” Mrs Weasley called unaware of what had just happened upstairs.</p><p>Everyone besides Sirius, Harry, and Hermione went downstairs. Sirius was still starring at the tapestry.</p><p>“How did you not know that she was pregnant,” Harry asked hesitantly “is there stuff you can use to hide it?”</p><p>“No there isn’t and Mother wouldn’t have wanted Regulus to hide it anyway, she was pregnant with the Black heir,” Sirius said “I don’t think anyone new because if so it would have been mentioned after she went missing.”</p><p>Hermione bent down and looked at the date of birth. “Oh my gosh,” she said “I think I know what happened, Sirius you said that no one knew that she was pregnant and you can’t hide pregnancies with magic. What if she wasn’t pregnant for long what if it just suddenly happened.”</p><p>“Hermione, what on earth are you talking about.” Sirius asked.</p><p>“Look at the date of birth, and the last name Hargreeves, I’m saying what if her child was a member of the umbrella academy.”</p><p>Harry thought about this, he could remember when they were at the highly of there fame, everyone in his school were obsessed with them, except for Dudley and him. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had said that they were freaks, one time he had overheard his Aunt tell his Uncle that they were worse than her sisters lot. But then one of the members had disappeared and a little while later one of them died and the hype for the umbrella academy was gone, the last time he heard them mentioned was two years ago when there adoptive father died.</p><p>Sirius on the other hand was completely confused. He had never heard of the umbrella academy because he was in Azkaban at the time and even if he wasn’t he still probably would not have heard of them because most of the wizarding world hadn’t, which Hermione and Harry found odd but then again most wizards did not pay attention to the Muggle world.</p><p>“What’s the umbrella academy?” Sirius finally asked.</p><p> </p><p>————————————————————————————</p><p>Klaus Hargreeves was having a pretty good day all things considered. After almost causing the world to end last year his family was trying to be a better family and help everyone work out there problems, starting with making Vanya feel like a member of the family.</p><p>Klaus had also been working on manifesting ghost so that other people could see Ben and his mother, Ben especially because everyone else in the academy wanted to see him (now that they believed him when he said that he could see there brother) and no one was really itching to see his mom, besides him but he could already see her.</p><p>He was also trying to summon Dave and try to talk to him but he hadn’t been successful.</p><p>But like I said he was having a good day he had waffles for breakfast, the academy played the game of life (Ben won which Klaus found very ironic) and then they went bowling. Not to the one that they used to go to, they were banned for life there.</p><p>So yeah, today was a good day but no one could have predicted how much stranger it was going to get.</p><p>December 1989</p><p>She was going to die</p><p>Her head felt like it was going to explode</p><p>She could feel there claws digging into her skin</p><p>She could see as it darker and darker the further down she was dragged</p><p>She was going to die alone</p></div>
