          <div class="userstuff"><p><i>Stupid.</i> He digs his spoon into the convenient tub of ice cream as if trying to stab it to death.</p><p><i>No bloody plan beforehand in case this happened.</i> He swallows the spoonful whole, distracted, glaring at the tub of sugary goodness as if it had personally offended him.</p><p><i>Of course it bloody happened at her grandmother's house.</i> He stabs the cookies and cream flavored concoction with a vengeance.</p><p><i>Of course the dear old muggle refused to leave her side.</i> A particularly large spoonful causes him to start coughing when he doesn't take the time to chew it.</p><p><i>Now she's in a muggle hospital of all places.</i> His rate of inhalation of ice cream increases.</p><p><i>Bloody muggles and their bloody system.</i> His stomach contracts, and he tells himself that it's anger at the current awkward situation.</p><p><i>My wife is in fucking labor and I can't be by her fucking side.</i> He misses the tub of creamy bliss and dents the table by accident.</p><p><i>Those cretins fumbling about her won't let me near her because I can't prove my relationship to her.</i> He shovels another slab of congealed milk into his mouth, fighting off the temptation to blow something up.</p><p><i>We're not muggles, why should we have had our marriage license on file with their government as well as ours?</i> He hurls the spoon at a window, and summons another one from the drawer.</p><p><i>Now they've got their grubby paws on her, we'll never be able to get her to St. Mungo's if there are complications.</i> His spell is too strong, and the spoon smacks him upside the head.</p><p><i>And I'm not present at the birth of my child.</i> Giving up on both magic and kitchen utensils, he sticks his face directly in the tub of ice cream.</p><p><i>Hermione is going to throw a fit when she's back to herself.</i> He licks the last drops up blindly.</p><p><i>We are the MALFOYS, dammit, we are not to be treated this way.</i> His stomach lodges a stronger complaint.</p><p><i>This treatment of a grand old family like us turns my stomach.</i> He drops the empty carton with a groan and a cramping of his stomach.</p><p><i>It just makes me sick how they... no, wait, I think I really might be sick.</i> He staggers in the direction of the bathroom.</p><p>
  <i>Fuck, I forgot I was lactose intolerant.</i>
