    <p>
  <b>Most of my lives, I'm born and raised.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I'm taught and educated in the rules of the world that is now mine.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Normally I get a few years before I'm thrown into Hell.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This life, I'm in the middle of a fucking tornado, and I haven't been in this life more than ten minutes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Fuck my lives.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Behind me stood a forest, of which I somehow knew I had walked from, as I approached the seaside cliff, walking even closer to the doomsday storm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Why I was, seemed to be beyond the hill, shining down on me with a protective gaze, or perhaps malice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I was confused as hell, and I was intimidated by a lighthouse… Though, that damn tornado still managed to beat it in waves.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Said lighthouse stood wearily, lighting up the darkness as a disastrous tornado, the likes of which only Lovecraft could have imagined, raged closer and closer to me, and the mainland.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I had a bad feeling about this… But I also had some bad questions about this all…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rain pelted down like glass from the sky, the weight of it pulling me down towards the Earth, as I tried to move farther from what seemed to be certain death.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I knew Death though, and I knew they wouldn't throw me into this life only to die immediately.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They already said that it took way too much work to put me here, so they wouldn't waste my time or theirs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"Where am I? What's even happening?"</span>
  </em>
  <span> I thought to myself, as I trudged farther through the storm, my hands covering my face as the rain fell like bullets.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unfortunately, before I could reach shelter, the tornado overtook the land, the eye opening to surround me fully.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Out of nowhere, a fishing boat flew through the air with a rage, only to crash into my body.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It almost felt like Uncle Vernon had come for revenge, as I swear that looked like his old fishing tug, the one he'd bought one summer to teach Dudley to fish, and then abandoned on the water.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Despite all I had done in my lives, a damn boat took me out, while I stood still cursing my long dead uncle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>I hate boats.</b>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>"Max? Ms. Caulfield, are you okay?"</b>
  <span> A calming voice called out, awakening me from my sleep.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I was familiar with this sensation however, as my first rest after a new life often left me drained.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I had only learned after meeting Death, that my lives were a product of both them and I fusing briefly to resurrect me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unfortunately, I had no choice in this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Death said I needed to be everyone that they made me, that I was needed in every life I lived… I didn't believe Ariana Dumbledore had needed me…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"Wait… Miss?"</span>
  </em>
  <span> I thought to myself, as I pushed myself up from my rest. I was splayed out on a wooden desk, a prestigious classroom greeting my sight, as I saw a class full of snobbish looking teenagers looking at me expectantly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Um… I'm good, I guess…" I muttered out, as I placed a hand to my forehead for support. Sadly, this only enforced what he had feared.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Welp, I'm female again… Of course this had to be #58… I went from a Spanish Adventurer to a teenage girl… What a step up…”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Don't lie to me Maxine, I see something's bothering you. Maybe Nurse Tella could help you?" The teacher, a tanned young man suggested from the other side of the room, a concerned look on his face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Despite his expression, I had a feeling something was up with him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Also, I've been named Henrietta and Owen before… Both terrible names in their own, but somehow, Maxine is even worse…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I think Max is just a bit nervous Mr. Jefferson, perhaps she shouldn't be a part of the contest?" A haughty blonde girl suggested to the teacher, the gleam in her eyes and grin made it obvious she didn't like whatever girl I had become.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"Great, first day in this life, and I already have enemies."</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I'm sure Max is fine, aren't you Max?" Jefferson asked me, a small smile on his face as he stepped closer to me. Something didn't seem right with him, but I nodded as I gathered my stuff into what seemed to be my messenger bag.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I- I think I'm going to get some water Mr. Jefferson." I said as calmly as I could, as I started running a list in my mind of everything I had to do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thankfully, I could feel the magic running through my veins, confirming I was a witch. Strangely, the magic felt a bit different, but fortunately not as wicked as my magic was when I was Jon.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The rituals had been hellish…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jefferson nodded with a smile as he gestured to the door, and I took full advantage of his courtesy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I felt eyes on me before I left, and saw a depressed looking girl watch me leave with a look that spoke of lonely abandonment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A voice within me told me her name was Kate, and that she roomed near me, and that I was supposed to be her friend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Apparently this was a boarding school.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"Good to know.” </span>
  </em>
  <span>I thought as I walked out of the class, leaving behind the snobs and that weird ass teacher.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>First thing's first, I needed to see myself, and get my fucking head on straight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Priorities, you know?"</em>
  </b>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>"I'm a goddamn Hipster…"</b>
  <span> I growled out as I looked at the nerdy girl in the mirror.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Seems I'm kind of an antisocial bitch as well, considering the absence of pictures of my friends in the bag I carried. If I even had friends that is...</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I wasn't too upset with the photography thing, as I've been a painter and scribe in Rome, so many lives ago.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I had grown an appreciation for the Arts, but not for isolation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"Need to fix that first."</span>
  </em>
  <span> I thought as I tried to access Max's memories, which wasn’t too much of a challenge. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Surprisingly, the memories came easier than they did in most lives, as Parker's memories had been extremely hard to get.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>"Okay… I have friends, that's good I guess."</span>
  </em>
  <span> I thought, as I remembered the boy Warren, who apparently had a crush on me. (At least Max had a suspicion.)</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unfortunately for the kid, I wasn't into crossing sabers, even if I didn't have one in this world.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That girl though, Kate something or other, she had potential, and she was nice, but sad from what Max remembered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was another girl in Max's mind, but apparently they hadn't spoken in years.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Chloe Price was her name.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I should probably track her down, but I had a feeling I'd see her before I could even try.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Welp, I was right.</b>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>While I was resting in the corner of the bathroom,</b>
  <span> trying to get a full grasp on Max's memories and the odd magic that filled my new, unfortunately young body, the bathroom door banged open with a loud crash.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hiding in the corner of the room, and channeling energy into my pupils, I saw a blond guy in a letterman's jacket stomp into the bathroom in a daze. I knew enough about drugs to know he was on something, and I swear something was wrong with him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I couldn't tell properly without a wand, but I knew trauma when I saw it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The oh so many wars had taught me enough.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He leaned against one of the sinks, very similar to how I been earlier, starting to talk to himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"It's cool Nathan… Don't stress. You're okay bro, just count to three… " He muttered to himself with heavy breaths, as I saw the stress eating at him. Something was bugging this kid a lot.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If I didn't have memories telling me that he hated me, I would have tried comforting him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He reminded me of Draco slightly, and I had come to regret not saving the kid from his father's influence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>From what I knew of Nathan Prescott, he seemed way too similar.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before I could intervene though, a punkish girl charged into the bathroom, her eyes narrowing at the sight of him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Apparently she didn't like him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Max didn't like him either, at least from what I had gathered from her mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I was in charge now though, and I say the guy deserved a chance. When he stopped being a dick, that is.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nathan looked at the girl then, the anger burning in his eyes suddenly, as I saw him tense up, a hand drifting to his waist in a way too familiar fashion..</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"So, what do you want?" He growled out, as he seemed to rest his hand on something out of sight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That stance reminded me way too much of when I knew Jacob.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nathan Prescott had a gun.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I may have to intervene anyway…”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two began talking then, as the girl began insulting him and trying to rile him up, as she apparently was trying to buy drugs from him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She seemed to not know that you don't threaten your dealer though…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Their exchange kept going with me watching carefully, until Nathan seemed to have enough, pulling his gun on her, backing her into the wall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You don't know who the fuck I am, or who you're messing around with!" He screamed out, as he tightened his grip on the pistol, pointing it at her stomach.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>From analyzing the trajectory of the possible shot, I knew that a bullet from that angle would kill the girl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The girl panicked then, as he grew more and more out of control, his hair standing on end.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Where'd you get that? What are you doing? Come on, put that thing down!" She demanded of him, though it seemed to be more begging than she would have liked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Something triggered within me then, as a voice that I was beginning to classify as Max's voice screamed inside my mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Apparently this girl was Chloe Price, Max's childhood friend. The one she had seemingly abandoned, yet she still didn't want dead.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Though what remained of Max was extremely afraid, I wasn't.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I had handled much more intimidating foes, and ones a lot more skilled with firearms than this kid.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hell, I had fought and killed literal monsters before.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A kid with Daddy Issues was going to be easy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Deciding that I had, had enough of this, I stepped from cover and aimed a hand at the idiot.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Intending on casting a wandless stunner at the boy, even I was surprised, as instead of the familiar red light, I saw the air start to distort around my hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My vision began to darken then, as everything around me began to fade into a dark blue.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>"What the-"</b>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>"Hell?"</b>
  <span> I found myself asking aloud, shooting up to my feet, as a piercing headache consumed me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My vision was shifting and dark, before focusing in an instant, seeing what was before me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This was… impossible?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"While I would normally condemn you for your language, are you okay Max? You don't look so good." The teacher from before, Jefferson, asked of me with confused eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Apparently Max didn't usually act like me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Also, she didn't usually time travel.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I thought I was just a witch… but what a surprise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I'm a Temporal Anomaly as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>“Well, this'll be fun…”</em>
  </b>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Just as before, </b>
  <span>I had gotten Jefferson to excuse me, and headed back to the girl's bathroom.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Normally I would have stopped to think, maybe try and assimilate Maxine Caulfield into myself sooner, but she seemed to have a much stronger will than I expected for an awkward teenage girl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She demanded we save Chloe, I didn't really disagree.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So, we went to the bathroom, twenty minutes before we had the last time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After a bit of work, I had managed to achieve at least a bit of my natural magic, and managed a Muggle Notice-Me-Not.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now, I waited in the first stall of the bathroom, already knowing that both Nathan and Chloe would check said stalls.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I didn't care, I just had to get my hands on Nathan, and ensure that Chloe didn't run into him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thankfully, I remembered how to apparate.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sadly, I couldn't do it without making noise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A wand did make a big difference.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I didn't mind the wait, finding enough stimulation in categorizing Max's memories and experiences, and growing to hate selfies.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Max Caulfield, better get ready, we're switching to painting."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before I could fight with the mental remnants of the girl, the boy that seemed even more troubled the second time around, charged into the bathroom.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Still unnoticed by anyone possible, I crept from the stall, not wanting him to work himself into even more of a rage, and grabbed the boy around the shoulders.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a grunt of effort, I apparated the two of us from the bathroom.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sadly, I didn't have a clue where to.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Welp, this might be difficult."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>"W-where, what am I?!"</b>
  <span> The boy screamed out, as the two of us found ourselves on a beach, conveniently on the same beach I had, had a vision of.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thankfully, there wasn't a tornado this time, just an angry spoiled bastard.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"On a beach, near some woods. I don't really know to be honest." I said casually, as I tried to mimic my own speaking voice by instinct. The voice that I had often used to take charge, my action hero voice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It sounded odd coming from 18-year old Max Caulfield, who I swear had not even gone through puberty yet, despite the impossibility of it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then again, I just time traveled without a Conduit.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This was a day of impossibilities, and it didn't seem to be ending.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mr. Prescott didn't look too happy to see me, as he pulled his gun on me immediately.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I scoffed under my breath. Can't have that after all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You bitch! What did you do to me?!" He screamed, his eyes both angry and fearful, though he obviously tried to hide the latter. He failed at that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I teleported us. You were about to kill someone. I saved you from what would likely be life in prison, and a very painful one at that." I bluffed to him expertly, as even though I was in Max's body, I thankfully had all of my skills, especially my social skills.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>My once father Ned had drilled diplomacy and politics into me, which came in handy way too often. Especially when I kidnapped people.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nathan just looked in shock at me, as his grip on the gun loosened enough for me to pull it to me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Using my prior knowledge, I began to disassemble the gun as soon as it reached my hands, letting the metal parts of it fall to the sand below.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Within a minute, Nathan had nothing to hurt anyone, besides his mediocre strength.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"How did you… You crazy bitch!" He screamed out, as he charged at me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not wanting to bother, I pressed my palm to his forehead as soon as he got close enough, instantly knocking him out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>While I felt sympathy for the kid, I wasn't going to let him hurt me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>While he normally wouldn't be able to, I had just gotten this body. This new... weak... body.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I still had work to do to ensure my survival, which included exercise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But first, I had to find a safe and isolated place to drop the guy off, and a temperamental girl to re-introduce myself to… well, the new Max to.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before that though, I'm changing my fucking clothes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This cutesy crap wasn't me, and it wouldn't be Max.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If anyone asked about it, I'd just blame the girl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I mean, Chloe seems like a bad influence after all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>“Who am I to blame, if she 'corrupts' me?”</em>
  </b>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Sadly, I didn't really know where Chloe lived.</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Max knew where she used to live, but with her having moved, and them not being in contact in years, it became difficult to find her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Really, I didn’t see her as a priority so much as a distraction. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Putting that aside for later, I decided to head to the dormitory, as that would probably tell me at least a bit of what I should be doing, or at least, should know.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"What classes do I even take?" I asked myself (Or what remained of Max, who now had become a quiet whisper in the back of my mind), as I flipped through the journal I'd found in her bag.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"This is the angstiest crap I've ever read, and I thought Felice's poetry was bad…" I muttered to myself judgmentally, as I flipped through the diary pages, skipping over pages where she'd just drawn or posted pictures she'd taken with her old camera.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Jefferson is supercool and superchill." I read as annoyingly as possible, imagining the stars in her eyes Max must have had when writing this crap.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I swear I could vomit from the memories I had gotten. I remembered her writing this garbage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I need some air…" I breathed out in a huff, as I got out of her room as quickly as possible. The wall of pictures, the Ikea furniture, the freaking plant… "Yeah, I need to throw out a lot of stuff…"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unfortunately, the blonde bitch from the classroom, Vicky or something, and her friends were sitting by the doors of the dorm, preventing me from leaving.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Oh, this is going to go well." I thought to myself, as I saw the blonde lift her head, and look smugly at me with spite in her beady eyes. In another life, I would have found her attractive, in this one, she was just another distraction.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Oh, look, it's Max Caulfield, the selfie ho of Blackwell. What a lame-" She began to say to me, but I just tuned her out. All I really caught was that she wasn't moving, and I really didn't want to get in a cat-fight on my first day of this life.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Any other day, I would, but not my first day. I still needed to regain my strength after all, and that would take time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Which, I seemed to have…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Whatever bitch…" I scoffed as I walked back to my dorm, leaving the stunned blonde and her pals behind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I'd just apparate out, as I didn't feel up to throwing around any more stunners, my magic not even responding to my call, almost as if it had fallen asleep. Fortunately, I had learned to apparate without tapping into my magic. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Maybe it was a gift from Death, considering that I didn't even get to keep the Hallows, but maybe my soul had mutated or some weird crap.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I didn't think I would be figuring it out anytime soon, but I knew I couldn't afford to fight anyone right now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oddly enough though, those time powers of Max's were flying to my fingers whenever I reached for them… Almost eager to help…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There had to be a price to this… The Symbiote had taught me that great power came with a cost, and the seemingly limitless ability to rewind time, with seemingly no consequences, and no paradoxes to boot? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Yeah, totally not going to bite me in the ass..." I muttered cynically, as I snapped my fingers, disappearing from the dorm and the school grounds all together.</span>
</p>
<p>
