    <p>When you get your letter, there is no surprise in your destitute house. There isn’t much of anything, really; your mother leaves it on the dining room table, open but still in the envelope. You’ve just picked it up and read the address (Ms. R Lalonde, the second bedroom on the first floor, Lalonde Manor, Wiltshire) when Roxy runs in, squealing.</p><p>“Rosie, congratulations! Ooh, I’m so proud! Oh, I hope you get Ravenclaw like me!”</p><p>Roxy is a constant chatterer. You truly have no idea where she gets it from, since both of your parents are near-silent figures in your lives. She’s not even the only one with this quality -- she shares it with your twin brother, who truly cannot stop talking no matter how inconvenient it is. Dave is more of a nervous talker, though, usually trying and failing to cover some emotion, whereas Roxy simply says most of the thoughts in her head.</p><p>She chatters on while you empty the envelope and skim over the contents. Just as you saw when Roxy’s letter arrived, there’s a brief note accepting you to the school and a list of things you’ll need. Most of them you either have already or could easily use Roxy’s old ones, but you know Mother will be taking you to Diagon Alley to buy everything brand new. Just another passive-aggressive, money-fueled grab for your daughterly affections. Perhaps you’ll take Roxy’s old robes anyway -- except, no, she’s always been tall and skinny and you are quite the opposite. Maybe her books or something. You can figure it out later.</p><p>“Serenity,” Roxy calls, “will you make us up a dinner? Something special, to celebrate Rosie’s letter!”</p><p>Serenity, your diminutive house-elf, appears with a quiet <em>pop!</em> and immediately bows. “Yes, mistress Roxy, right away!”</p><p>“Thank you, dear!” Roxy turns her attention back to you. “Rose, you should owl Dave and see if he’s gotten his!”</p><p>“I’m sure he has,” you say. “There’s no need to risk an owl when we’re so certain.”</p><p>You are not to owl Dave but for holidays and special circumstances. <em>Extremely</em> special circumstances.</p><p>“Well, come on, it’s a special occasion, why shouldn’t you?”</p><p>“I am not to owl Dave but for holidays and extremely special circumstances. I wouldn’t count such a completely unsurprising event as this.”</p><p>“It’s <em>exciting</em>, Rosie! Aren’t you happy?”</p><p>You consider this. “Yes, but I wouldn’t consider it an unusual enough event to owl Dave about it.”</p><p>“Rose, you know Da -- Br -- ugh, you know our <em>father</em> won’t let him owl you, so you should owl him first!”</p><p>Hmph. She has a point.</p><p>“And anyway, don’t just not owl him to be contrary to me.”</p><p>“Fine,” you say. “You’re right, anyway.” Much as you hate to admit it.</p>

</center><p class="rose">Dearest darlingest brother David,</p><p class="rose">How have you been faring since my last owl? I do apologize for the length of time between my letters, but I know how your “Bro” can be.</p><p class="rose">Today I received a most thrilling missive by owl. Shall I quote the opening line for you? Or perhaps I will simply tell you the sender. It’s quite a famous institution -- no doubt you’ve heard of it. Just a little place called, oh, <em>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</em></p><p class="rose">I don’t know about you, but I am positively delighted to finally be attending Hogwarts. You’ve gotten your letter too, right? I know you, Dirk, and “Bro” are well-hidden, but everyone says Dumbledore knows everything, even where to find students that shouldn’t be found. Besides, Dirk goes to Hogwarts, and he got his letter after you went into hiding.</p><p class="rose">Let me know in your next owl if there’ll be any school supplies you lack, yes? My mother will take me out shopping regardless of the fact that we already have everything on the list, so I’ll be able to bring spares of anything if you need me to.</p><p class="rose">Your dearest darlingest sister,<br/>
Rose</p>

</center><p>Your mother, rather than taking you out shopping for your school things, simply buys them all for you. You wake up a week before school starts to find a pile of books and such stacked on the dining room table, including a new cauldron and several new sets of robes. You know they won’t fit. There’s also a pouch of Galleons with a note tied to it that reads <span class="feferi">For anytihng else you might need :)</span> and is signed by your mother.</p><p>The pile lacks a wand, and you think you’d like a few other trinkets, so you ask Roxy to take you to Diagon Alley when she goes to refresh her own school supplies. She cheerfully agrees, of course, so you bring the pouch of Galleons and a bit of your own pocket money, just to be safe. You’ll have to get a wand, after all, and new robes since your mother can’t guess your size for the life of her, and whenever you go to Diagon Alley you like to have a little extra change in case you see something tempting.</p><p>The wand is first, of course. Roxy takes you to Ollivander’s, a weathered-looking shop run by an old man with shockingly white hair and light eyes.</p><p>“Rose Lalonde,” he says when you introduce yourself. “I remember your parents’ wands well. Acacia and unicorn for your mother, ten and a half inches, and only moderately flexible. Certainly unusual, and quite powerful. Your father had cherry and dragon heartstring, a dangerous combination, thirteen inches and quite rigid. And your sister here, of course -- dogwood, quite uncommon, and unicorn hair, twelve and a half inches and fairly whippy.”</p><p>“He’s just like that,” Roxy whispers to you. Ollivander chuckles slightly.</p><p>“Well, let’s begin, shall we? I’ll just need to take a few measurements first -- which is your wand arm?”</p><p>“Right,” you say. With a flick of his wand, a tape measure unfurls and begins measuring your height and the length of your arm, and then more abstract distances, like the circumference of your ankle and the length of your nose.</p><p>“Let’s try this one,” he says, and passes you a wand. You’ve hardly taken it in your hand when he snatches it back out.</p><p>“No, no, that won’t do. This one.” He exchanges it for another wand, which he also immediately seems to change his mind about. This goes on for some time, and you must be in there for ten whole minutes just standing there grabbing a wand and having to let go just as quickly.</p><p>“Aha!” he says suddenly. “Quite uncommon these days, but I think it might do just right for you.”</p><p>You take the wand, and he doesn’t snatch it from your hand this time, just watches intently. It feels comfortable in your hand, and it’s quite a light color. You give it an experimental flick, and a violet ribbon of light streams out the end and swirls in the air like smoke.</p><p>“Perfect! Silver lime and dragon heartstring, ten inches, and sturdy. Do you know anything about wandmaking, Ms. Lalonde?”</p><p>“No, why?”</p><p>“Silver lime is a wood strongly associated with clairvoyance -- Seers and skilled Legilimens. It was in high fashion perhaps half a century ago, but has mostly faded into obscurity. Dragon heartstring, meanwhile, is a powerful core and a quick learner, though it can be temperamental. A most interesting combination to choose you, Ms. Lalonde. I look forward to seeing your impact on the wizarding world.”</p><p>You are <em>enchanted</em>. Silver lime -- a rare, old-fashioned wood, and it chose you! You’re practically in a daze as you hand Mr. Ollivander eight Galleons and walk out, still staring at your beautiful, pale wand.</p><p>“Ooh, it’s so exciting, Rosie! Where do you wanna go next, Twilfitt and Tattings? Or, you know what, why don’t we go to Madam Malkin’s instead, and then Fortescue’s is right there.”</p><p>You nod, still dazed. Roxy chatters on, and you hold on to the hem of her shirt as she leads you through the dull roar of the crowd.</p><p>Madam Malkin herself is a portly old woman with ruddy cheeks, not much taller than you. She hands you a set of robes to start out with and begins tacking up the sleeves.</p><p>The door on the bell jingles and a tall, skinny girl with an absolute mess of wild black hair walks in alone. Madam Malkin turns away from you for a moment.</p><p>“Hogwarts, dear?”</p><p>The girl nods mutely.</p><p>“Alright, come stand up here so we can get you fitted.” She bustles off to get something and you and the girl are left alone.</p><p>“You’re a first-year too, right?” you ask politely. It would be good to start the year knowing someone besides Dave, after all.</p><p>“Yeah,” she says in a scratchy voice. She won’t meet your eyes, and her hair covers almost half of her face.</p><p>“Well… alright. What’s your name?”</p><p>“You can just call me Vee.”</p><p>“Hello, Vee, I’m Rose Lalonde. Aren’t you excited? Have you got your wand yet?”</p><p>At this she breaks into a smile. “Yeah! Vine and phoenix feather, thirteen inches, and, uh… I think he said ‘surprisingly hardy’?”</p><p>“<em>Vine?</em> I didn’t know you could even make wands out of vines!”</p><p>“He said it was <em>super</em> rare, and it went off as soon as I walked into the store!”</p><p>You gape at her. “That’s incredible.”</p><p>Madam Malkin returns, but you go on with your conversation as Vee asks, “What’s your wand?”</p><p>“Silver lime and dragon heartstring, ten inches, and sturdy. Silver lime is apparently associated with Seers, so maybe I’ll be able to see the future or something.”</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>“What House are you hoping for? My sister wants me to be in Ravenclaw, but I think I’ll probably end up in Slytherin like my oldest brother.”</p><p>“Uhh…”</p><p>Just then, Madam Malkin stands up and tells you you’re done, and you have to pay her and meet Roxy outside before you can say goodbye to Vee.</p><p>Roxy has two ice cream cones in her hands, and you trade her for the bag with your new robes in it.</p><p>“How was your fitting?”</p><p>“Oh, fine. I met another first-year.”</p><p>“Oh, cool! Was it that other girl with the messy hair?”</p><p>“Yeah, she said her name was Vee and her wand is made of vines!”</p><p>“No way!”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>“That reminds me, unrelated to this other girl.” Roxy lowers her voice slightly. “I was chatting with Florean and he said that <em>Vriska Serket</em> is starting school this year too.”</p><p>“Really? But I thought she pretty much disappeared after… the incident with the Dark Lord? All we know is that her parents died but she survived.”</p><p>“I know! But Florean said that the owner of Gambol and Japes told him that he heard Ollivander talking to her and saying her name. He said that something blew up in Ollivander’s shop as soon as she walked in!”</p><p>“She must be <em>powerful</em>. Maybe she really did defeat the Dark Lord.” It’s a heavy thought. It would mean that you’ll be going to school with one of the most powerful Dark witches ever.</p><p>You <em>have</em> to get close to her.</p><p>“Hey, I have an idea for a special treat. Let’s go to The Magical Menagerie and get you a cat! Or an owl, if you’d rather. But since I’ll be taking Mutie, and since you don’t have… you know, maybe you could get a kitten or something.”</p><p>You ponder this for a moment. Roxy’s “you know” refers to your cat Jaspers, who went missing when you were seven and whose dead body reappeared almost two years later. Unfortunately, it became a whole <em>thing</em> with your mother, and she held you a funeral for him, had his body magically preserved, and built a mausoleum to house his tiny coffin. You simply couldn’t be allowed to mourn your dear feline friend in peace — she just <em>had</em> to turn poor Jaspers into a pawn in your passive-aggressive war.</p><p>You know she didn’t actually kill him or anything, but it’s still something of a sensitive topic with you.</p><p>“I think I’d like that,” you say.</p><p>Roxy takes you to The Magical Menagerie, which is just down the alley and across from Gringotts. Inside, there aren’t many owls, since Eeylop’s Owl Emporium isn’t far down the block, but rats scurry through tunnels, cats meander about the shelves, and a single black raven rests on a perch near the door.</p><p>“Welcome to The Magical Menagerie!” says the witch at the counter cheerfully. “Feel free to browse all you like, and if you have any questions just let me know.”</p><p>“Is there, like, a section for cats?” Roxy asks.</p><p>“Sure, there’s a couple around the front here but most of them will be back and to your left.”</p><p>“Thanks!”</p><p>You go to the little alcove of cat cages and sit on the floor, waiting. Already, one of the more sociable cats is approaching you -- a beautiful fluffy Persian nudges your shoulder -- but as much as you love all cats, you’d prefer one with less fur if possible. Roxy sits next to you, taking the Persian in her lap.</p><p>“Seen any you like so far?” she asks.</p><p>“He’s very friendly,” you say, referring to the cat in her lap, “but he’s so fluffy and our robes are black.”</p><p>“Good point. What’s your game plan, then?”</p><p>“Sit and wait for a bit, and see if any particular cats strike my fancy.”</p><p>“Okay. Do you wanna get a little thing of treats?”</p><p>“Not right now.”</p><p>Currently, you have your eye on a little black shorthair watching you from his cage. He sits extremely still, only blinking his ice-blue eyes every now and then. He makes direct eye contact with you.</p><p>“I like that one,” you say, gesturing towards him.</p><p>Just as you say this, a white and orange blur lands on your shoulder, knocking you over.</p><p>“Turkey, no!” cries the cashier.</p><p>“This cat’s name is Turkey?” you say incredulously, as the cat prances around your torso and settles along your sternum. A sandpaper tongue tickles your neck.</p><p>“Did you hit your head? Oh, I’m so sorry, he’s been here for ages but he keeps pouncing on the guests and the other pets!”</p><p>“No, no, I’m fine,” you say. “Um. How much is the adoption fee for… Turkey?”</p><p>The cashier seems shocked that you want this cat who bowled you over and is still, in fact, resting on your shoulders and licking at your neck, but Roxy insists on buying him for you as well as getting you all kinds of supplies for him. You pick out a collar, and Roxy gets a new one for Mutie as well.</p><p>Turkey falls off your shoulders as soon as you walk out of the shop, but you pick him up and set him back up. He’s quite large, and he makes a mess of your hair and blocks some of your vision, but you find that you like his weight.</p><p>“Alright, I think that’s got you covered! I gotta stop at Flourish and Blotts real quick and then we can head back home.”</p><p>You nod, and Turkey falls off your shoulders again.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center><p>The next three weeks before school are unbearably boring. You organize your supplies over and over again, packing and unpacking your trunk and a little train bag until Roxy makes you come out of your rooms to eat. You don’t owl Dave again, but you can’t wait to see him again. The last time you saw him was… what, three years ago? Four? It was just before he went into hiding with Dirk and their “brother,” and Dirk will be a fourth year now. Three years, then. You miss him so much.</p><p>Turkey is a constant presence in your rooms, often falling into the sink or toilet in your ensuite bathroom. You have to bathe him constantly as a result, but unlike any other cats you know, he doesn’t seem to mind much. He likes the water quite a bit, really, and getting him out of the bath is often more difficult than getting him in.</p><p>Three days before September first, a massive, raggedy raven arrives at your door and gives you a letter from Dave.</p>
<p></p><center>

</center><p class="dave">rose</p><p class="dave">we werent even planning to go into magical menagerie when we went shopping but i heard what sounded like screaming and it turned out to be this crazy raven fighting with the shop owner and she immediately flew over and burrowed into my hair so they gave us a discount for her</p><p class="dave">i love her so much her name is antioch and shes really mean to bro so she cant come inside the house but its okay she hunts her own food</p><p class="dave">dirk says roxy said you got a cat named turkey but that cant be right youre the type of person to name a cat belgaroth or some shit youd never allow a cat named turkey to live in your house so im calling bullshit on that one</p><p class="dave">anyway give antioch a pet for me and send her back if you write a letter to go with it she wont come back in time to go to school and i dont want her to get lost</p><p class="dave">dave</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center><p>You send him a letter anyway -- just a quick note reading <span class="rose">See you at school</span> -- and the raven nips at your hand in what you must assume is an affectionate manner, since it only hurts a little bit and she looks like she could do serious damage if she wanted.</p><p>“Antioch is a boy’s name,” you tell her, and send her on her way.</p>
