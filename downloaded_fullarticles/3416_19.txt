          <div class="userstuff"><p>“If things don’t change soon, I swear I’ll tear this country apart building by building.”  <br/>
<br/>
This wasn’t Harry Potter, war hero or Healer Potter; this was nervous, desperate Harry, husband to missing Draco, and nothing else except their son mattered now.<br/>
<br/>
“Mate,” Ron said quietly, “we’ll find him. You know how this works…”<br/>
<br/>
Before Ron could finish, a snowy owl flew in front of Harry’s face and he froze mid-step, hearing the voice his heart so ached for.<br/>
<br/>
<em> “Find Harry. Tell him..." Draco's voice broke. "Tell him I love him. I’m at the Manor. Tell him to bring me home.” </em><br/>
<br/>
In less than a breath, Harry was gone.<br/>
<br/>
“Draco!” Harry’s voice called out as he landed outside the gates and with one shove of magic, crashed his way through the metal and the wards. “Draco!”.<br/>
<br/>
A soft moan floated over the air and Harry’s breath caught as he found his husband and dropped to his knees beside the battered form.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh love,” he said as he touched with gentle healing hands.<br/>
<br/>
“Harry, it’s really you,” Draco rasped out, wincing at the pain.  <br/>
<br/>
Harry pulled his wand and muttered a spell, the relief immediate on the bruised face. “Better?”  <br/>
<br/>
Draco nodded, a ghost of a smile on his lips.<br/>
<br/>
Harry framed Draco’s face with his hands and leaned close. “I’m here. I’ve got you. I love you.” He brushed their lips together with the barest touch.  <br/>
<br/>
A pop and Ron was kneeling next to them.  “Help’s coming. He alright?”<br/>
<br/>
“Tortured but alive,” Harry muttered.<br/>
<br/>
“How is…” Draco collapsed into a wet cough.<br/>
<br/>
“He’s fine, love, I promise. Don’t talk. You’ll be better soon.” Harry sat and lifted Draco into his lap, cradling him carefully since he was the most precious thing he’d ever held. "Everything's alright now. You're home."</p></div>
