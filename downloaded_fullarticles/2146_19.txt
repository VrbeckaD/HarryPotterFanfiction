          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Harry,"</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Harry stared at the chess board. He could see seven different ways Ron could beat him, and so far no way of escaping. As usual.</p>
<p>"Ah… Has Hermione seemed… nah, never mind." Ron sounded… odd. Hesitant? Hopeful? Harry moved his knight, and threw Ron a blank look.</p>
<p>"Has Hermione seemed what?"</p>
<p>Ron's ears were pink. Again, not unusual. He shifted uncomfortably in his chair.</p>
<p>"Well, you know, just…" Ron took Harry's rook with a bishop Harry hadn't noticed, and went even pinker. "… unusually affectionate?"</p>
<p>Harry snorted.</p>
<p>"She's been extremely affectionate lately,"</p>
<p>"Oh," Ron looked like he was trying not to look crestfallen.</p>
<p>"-but only to you…" Harry finished, grinning.</p>
<p>Ron stared at him.</p>
<p>"R-really?"</p>
<p>Harry smirked.</p>
<p>"Put it this way mate, it's not my bed she's been climbing into late at night,"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Ron again, blushing like a fire engine, "So… so you think it means something then,"</p>
<p>Harry blinked.</p>
<p>"I don't understand how you can beat everyone at chess and out think evil villains and make the tastiest biscuits in the known universe, and yet not notice <em>when a girl climbs into your bed."</em></p>
<p>"I noticed," said Ron, "<em>Believe </em>me, I noticed… I just… it's a bit hard to believe, I guess," he paused and stared moodily at the chessboard, "I thought it might just be grief. Stress, you know, trauma."</p>
<p>"Quite possibly." Said Harry, "All the grief, stress and trauma, and who does she choose? There are at least 7 other single blokes in this house. Odd though it sounds, Charlie wouldn't be a bad match for her,"</p>
<p>"<em>What?"</em></p>
<p>"Or Neville- they were always quite close, and he's really come into his own lately-"</p>
<p>"<em>You-"</em></p>
<p>"-then there's Percy, and you know she thinks he's being mistreated, and you know what she's like about that-"</p>
<p>"Argh, Harry, stop it,"</p>
<p>"-or George. And Seamus and Dean practically live here at the moment anyway. Not sure why… but they've still got all their limbs…"</p>
<p>"You- just- ok OK! What do I- should I- what should I do?"</p>
<p>Harry blinked again.</p>
<p>"You could try… being affectionate back?"</p></div>
