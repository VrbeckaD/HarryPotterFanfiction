    <p>Harry looked around the darkened room he was in. He had just ended Voldemort and had been fighting off the remainder of the Death Eaters when he had been grabbed by none other than Bellatrix LeStrange, one of the cruelest and craziest Death Eaters there was. He looked all around the room frantically, trying to find her. “Where have you brought me?” He asked into the room. “What do you want?” </p>
<p>Off to Harry's right, a female voice spoke gently, two words. “A baby.” Harry backed away. “If you think I'm going to fuck you, you're even crazier than I thought you were.” His words were scathing, full of an angry contempt. The mere thought that she would think him stupid enough to give her something like that was flat out preposterous!</p>
<p>“Oh no Harry, we're not going to be sleeping together, you are going to become my baby.” Bellatrix said and this time she stepped closer to him so he could see her. She was dressed in a beautiful black dress, and her normally crazy frizzed hair was done neat with soft gentle curls that just touched her shoulders. Her heavily lidded eyes seemed softer somehow and Harry couldn't help but wonder if this was truly the same witch that had killed his godfather just about three years ago.</p>
<p>Harry shook himself from his thoughts and looked at her like she was crazy, which he knew she was. “No.” He said simply. “There's no way I'm doing this. No way am I going to act like a baby for you!” That's not to say the thought didn't appeal to him; Harry had a diaper and bottle fetish, but to allow himself to do this with the woman who nearly three years ago took the closest thing he had to a parent. No. It wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>“No, I agree.” Bellatrix said as she gently lay a hand on his shoulder and guided him toward a bed. She set down and got comfortable, one leg pulled up under her with Harry basically setting in her lap. “You won't be acting. You will be doing.” She adjusted the way he was setting so that he was for the most part, lying in her lap and she flicked her wand. A baby bottle filled with milk floated in the air and Bellatrix lay her wand, along with Harry's that she had procured during the battle when she had grabbed him, on her nightstand. She took the floating bottle and began to near Harry's lips.</p>
<p>Harry started to squirm, trying to get out of her grasp, but found he couldn't move much. She must have used some sort of restraint spell on him. “No!” He said and clenched his teeth tightly and pursed his lips together.</p>
<p>“It's okay baby boy.” Bellatrix cooed softly as she gently held him to her. “Calm down for momma and take your bottle.” It would take time to get him used to this she knew, but she had patience. “Here, perhaps it would help if momma gave you a stuffie to hold.” She said thoughtfully. “A lot of babies like to hold stuffies when they nurse.” She flicked her wand and conjured up a deer stag stuffie and gently lay it on his chest. The fact that she knew enough to know he would want a deer stuffie, that touched Harry and he had to speak. “How'd you know?” He asked softly, barely moving his lips in case she decided to use that time to slip the bottle into his mouth. </p>
<p>Bellatrix smiled gently at him. “All good momma's and daddy's know what their babies like.” She said in a soft tone. “Now, you just relax and hold your stuffie. What are you going to call him?” She asked in honest curiosity. </p>
<p>Name? He was expected to name the stuffie? Harry frowned. “You want me to name it?” Bellatrix nodded. “All babies name their stuffies.” She explained. Harry sighed, seeing no way out of it he thought a moment. He wanted something easy to remember. “Prongs?” He asked softly.</p>
<p>Bellatrix smiled and nodded. “Prongs it is then.” She said smiling gently at him. “Now baby, just hold Prongs and let's get you to take your bottle.” Still Harry refused it. “Don't wanna.” He said, sounding quite babyish already. He frowned a bit at the way it had come out. </p>
<p>“It's okay Harry.” Bellatrix said with a grin. “Take your time. You'll get used to it. Soon, it will be perfectly natural to you.” Harry doubted that. He turned his head away and squirmed. He didn't want to be her baby. He had things he had to do. He didn't have time for this. </p>
<p>“Now now baby, it's late and you need your bottle before you go night night.” Bellatrix cooed softly, but Harry still refused. He had never been babied before, this was all new to him. Maybe that was why she was being so patient with him. He looked at her a moment. “Why?”</p>
<p>Bellatrix frowned at the question. “Why what Harry?” She asked curiously. Harry took a breath and spoke. “Why are you doing this? Why do you want me for this?” He had to know. He had to understand why she was doing it. What was she after?</p>
<p>Bellatrix smiled and kissed Harry's head. She still held the bottle quite near his mouth, but didn't try to make him take it. “Let me tell you a little story Harry. When I was a little girl, my father and uncle raped me and abused me. The violent rape and harsh abuse made it so that I can never bear my own children.” She kept her voice low and noticed he had cuddled into her lap, holding the stuffie against him and was listening closely.</p>
<p>“It's all I've ever wanted.” Bellatrix continued. “And I know you've never had any real sort of babying, or pretty much any form of love.” She smiled now, he had taken the bottle and was suckling gently as he relaxed listening to her. “This way, we both get what we need the most. I get my baby, you get a mommy.”</p>
<p>Harry listened to her words; they made sense and he hadn't even really noticed that he'd allowed her to slip the bottle into his mouth, nor that he was now quite willingly, suckling it. The only time he realized it was when he had to take his first swallow. He stopped briefly, swallowed the warm milk, looked at Bellatrix then the bottle and sighed a bit. It had tasted good, very good and he found himself wanting more. He took the bottle again, suckling almost hungrily.</p>
<p>Bellatrix smiled and rocked gently, she hummed to him as he held his stuffie and suckled his bottle. She watched his eyes close as he started to relax. She had been quite patient with him, allowing him to adjust as he needed to, and it had paid off. She sighed softly and continued to hum a soft gentle song as Harry slowly suckled his bottle. She really would have preferred breastfeeding him, but that would take time. She would have to work him up to that. </p>
<p>Harry couldn't believe how good he suddenly felt. Perhaps it was the warm milk, or her soft rocking and humming, but he slowly found himself drifting off to sleep as he finished his bottle. Bellatrix grinned and gently lay Harry on the bed. She would sleep with him for a night or two simply to let him adjust, then she would move him to his own personal nursery.</p>
<p>Harry was asleep within moments. He snuggled against Bellatrix, pressing himself against her as he held his stuffie to him. Bella smiled as she watched him for a moment. He had taken it much better than she had figured he would. She had in fact, never once used any sort of restraint on him, it had all been of his own doing. Perhaps something back in the back of his mind, a part he wasn't yet ready to consciously accept, wanted this. His own mind had restrained him. Gently, Bella rocked with Harry in her arms as she too fell asleep.</p>
