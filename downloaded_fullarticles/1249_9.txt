    <p>When Tom Marvolo Riddle is fourteen years old, he murders his pathetic excuse for paternity and the sniveling old fools that birthed him. It’s an easy thing to do, fueled by cold fury-turned-hatred bore from lonely nights and missed meals at the orphanage, from the tense terror-filled solemnity of pre-war London, from harsh jeers and well-placed hexes in his few tender years at Hogwarts. He sheds the guilt with the ease of a snake crawling out of an old skin, embracing his role as murderer wholeheartedly and ripping away part of his soul in a quest for immortality. He passes out from the strain of the ritual and awakes to a bone-deep ache, but he revels in it; a penance for his new status.</p><p> </p><p>His next three come easier.</p><p> </p><p>The quest for immortality continues, through his graduation from Hogwarts, through his denial for the Defense position. He uses his time at Borgin &amp; Burkes wisely, taking a thorough inventory of the dark texts surrounding him. His horcruxes have done their job admirably; his immortality is assured, and he can rest easy at night, without the shadow of death pressing in, threatening to consume him. But the panic always comes back, fueled by phantom sirens when the air gets too still. Even Hepzibah Smith’s treasures can’t placate him. Horcruxes, he realizes, aren’t the answer. He’s already growing gaunt with the strain, his soul stretched too thin and his mind too easily pulled from the cool, calculating methods he had employed before toying with splitting his soul. He needs <em>more, </em>he needs <em>better, </em>and so Tom’s search continues, until he’s pushed so far that he’s gone through war-torn London, gone through the bloody entrails of Europe, gone through the dark shadows of Albanian forests, gone to places buzzing with so much magic he can’t even tell which direction he’s in, gone entirely. Somewhere in the magical depths of a forest no one can name, Tom Riddle disappears.  </p><p> </p><p>He does not return.</p><p> </p><p>The wizarding world moves on.</p><p> </p><p>On July 31, 1980, Harry James Potter is born. There’s no war brewing. Harry grows up loved and the slightest bit spoiled, passed around between his mum and dad, Uncle Moony, Uncle Padfoot, and Uncle Wormy. The cottage at Godric’s Hollow is full of warmth and laughter, but it’s left behind as Harry gets older and begins to take up more space. It was only meant to be a starter home, after all. It stands tall, proud, and well taken care of as it is passed to another new, eager couple, and the Potters move towards new beginnings.</p><p> </p><p>James and Lily Potter live. They argue and bicker and contemplate whether they got married too young, but they also laugh and make up and rekindle the passion they had as seventh year schoolmates. They arrange playdates with fellow parents and meet up for drinks with friends and advance along their career paths, and most importantly, they love their son with all their hearts. Harry is taken to the Dursleys only once, a Christmas Eve when he is two years old, and the visit ends abruptly after only half an hour when the toddler floats a delicious looking bit of pudding to himself. Harry never sees them again.</p><p> </p><p>Harry doesn’t meet Ronald Weasley on the Hogwarts Express, doesn’t save him from dry corn beef sandwiches. In this life, Harry and Ron are already acquainted; Harry was taken into Molly Weasley’s homeschooling group after Lily returns to the Ministry to put her Charms mastery to work and James takes up his Auror assignments. Harry knows The Burrow almost as well as his own home, and he spends his days playing games with Luna Lovegood, Cedric Diggory, and the Weasley kids. He wrinkles his nose when Ginny tries to kiss him in the gardens, too young to properly think about things like kisses, and he eagerly adds his own mischief in with the twins’ pranks.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s five when his brother is born, then nine when his sister arrives, and he experiences all the fondness and annoyance younger siblings bring. His eleventh birthday brings his Hogwarts letter, and this time it’s met with immediate delight, but also some reluctance. He’s wanted to go to Hogwarts ever since he was old enough to comprehend the fantastic tales his mum and dad told him about it, but this time he also has a family he must leave behind. He doesn’t expect the ache of homesickness to be quite so fierce.</p><p> </p><p>He’s placed in Gryffindor immediately, much to the delight of his parents. He’s happy, but it’s not exactly the relief it had been in another life; he’d been assured they’d love him just the same no matter what house he was in. Harry blends into the student body for the most part, only gawked at when he falls subject to a particularly flashy prank from the twins, and looked up to for his Quidditch prowess. He still makes the team his first year at Hogwarts, because Draco Malfoy is a terrible bully no matter how the past changes, and even with parents the young Neville Longbottom is just a bit soft. Harry keeps his grades up as well, mindful of his mother’s stellar academic reputation. Snape, never fond of children in any life, has no reason to take up the Potions post at Hogwarts; he is part of a team of Unspeakables specializing in potion experiments instead, and Harry is left with old Sluggy as a professor. His mum gives him tips on how to brew properly, and his dad gives him tips on how to properly suck up without looking like a prat, and Harry’s overall potions experience is much better all around. He’s not the top of his class—Hermione is still extremely clever, even if Harry was properly raised in wizarding society—but he’s a far cry higher in the ranks than he had ever been when he was placed at the Dursleys.</p><p> </p><p>There’s no troll in dungeons to bind fragile friendships together, but Harry ropes Hermione into his group anyway. She’s bossy and swottish and Ron still says mean things to her, but this Harry is confident enough in his friendships to stand up to his best friend’s insensitivity. He sees her hidden back in the library sometimes, though, quiet and studious and a little bit teary because children are <em>mean,</em> but she always has such a stubborn set to her shoulders that he can’t help but admire her. She’s not at the disadvantage she once was, with the pureblood mania dimmed somewhat without Voldemort to stoke it, but she’s subject to enough prejudice to make muggleborns shrink away from confrontation. Still, Hermione is determined to make people listen to her, accept her, and there’s something about her fierce determination and quick tongue that reminds him of his mother. He offers her a lifeline, in the form of casual conversation and a person to sit next to at dinner. She seizes it. Despite the absences of the troll, their friendship is just as strong.</p><p> </p><p>(Harry is very proud of himself the first summer he brings Hermione home for a visit; she and Lily get on like a house on fire and he knows that he pegged her right. The bond between Lily and Hermione is swift and fierce, and after the first afternoon tea, Hermione is a constant presence in his home at any given holiday.)</p><p> </p><p>This life wasn’t completely without struggles. Expectations poured onto Harry at every angle. His mother’s intelligence and his father’s athletic prowess. His uncles’ clever and inventive pranks. His teachers’ preconceived notions of what kind of student he would be, based on the ones they had taught before. There was no Mirror of Erised in this life, so Ron never told him about the inferiority he felt when compared to every family member, but it was something the two used to whisper about in the dorms, under heavy privacy spells while the other boys snored on. No matter what Harry did, he fell short in one way or another. In this universe he was loved, so loved, but he also resented it in the slightest bit. Pulled in too many directions. Unable to be Just Harry. This Harry was desperate to break out of the mold cast for him, but found himself predictable in every direction he tried to walk in.</p><p> </p><p>This Harry wanted more.</p><p> </p><p>This Harry found it.</p>
