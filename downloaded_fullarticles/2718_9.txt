    <p>
  <span>“It’s not for long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, not long,” he said with a slight smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay. See, it won’t be long. You’ll be back soon, and there’s no reason to worry. You’ll be back,” Draco whispered hoarsely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. I won’t. I’ll be back soon,” Harry said, burying his nose deeper into the soft skin of Draco’s neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco slowly slid his hands up Harry’s back, trailing his fingers in careful circles and pressing the tips of his fingers into Harry’s shoulder blades. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every part of their bodies pressed up to each other. Thighs pressed up against each other gently, their stomachs rising and falling with speech, their chests resting against the other with every breath. Harry’s face was pressed into Draco’s neck, and Draco’s head rested over Harry’s shoulder. Harry’s left hand was draped through a belt loop, and the right was in Draco’s back pocket. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But if I don’t-” Harry said suddenly, lifting his head to face Draco.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will. You’re coming home,” Draco breathed, his eyes red from trying not to cry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head slightly, a lone tear sliding down his face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have to,” Draco’s voice broke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry slumped his forehead against Draco’s, his breath washing over Draco’s cheeks. The one tear rolled slowly down Harry’s neck. Draco watched it unblinkingly, unable to look up at Harry’s face. Draco knew Harry was looking at him, the green of his eyes standing out even more than usual from the contrast of red puffiness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco deliberately brought his fingers up to brush the tear away from Harry’s neck. Harry shivered slightly underneath his fingertips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Aurors will be calling me to the meeting point any minute now,” Harry said faintly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looked up, and just as he had thought, Harry’s eyes were searching his face as if to try and memorize it before he left. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He inhaled sharply, about to pull away maybe, or try to reassure himself before Harry left, but he was cut off with a hard, fast kiss pressed up against his lips. Harry backed away quickly, but the spark had been lit. Draco stepped forward and pulled Harry to him for a blistering kiss. He moved slowly at first, winding his fingers up into the wild curls of Harry’s hair, wrapping them down his sides, running them up and down his neck and the sides of his face. Harry responded immediately, gasping into Draco’s mouth and deepening the kiss into something sad, lonely, lost, searching. Warmth burned up everywhere Harry’s hands touched, lighting his skin on fire up his arms, the backs of his thighs, the small of his back, the downy hair at the nape of his neck. His heart pounded against his rib cage, sending tremors of fear and want running through his nerves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The tears came down. There was nothing holding them back anymore. Fat tears of shame and desperation mingled with the one’s on Harry’s face. This could be the last time he ever touched Harry. The last time he had him all to himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco pressed himself even further into Harry, leaning almost all his weight up against Harry. Draco opened his mouth carefully again, and again, letting Harry swallow his air and whimpers. Harry’s mouth was warm and wet with tears and the taste of his favorite peppermint tea. Draco leaned back to try and catch his breath and Harry surged forward without pause, nearly toppling over Draco with his lips crushing against the corner of Draco’s lips, moving too fast for accuracy. Draco stumbled back with Harry’s weight, and they stumbled across the warm living room to the squishy couch. Draco landed on his bum and sunk against the back of the couch as Harry determinedly crawled up him and onto his lap. His knees wrapped around Draco’s hips to straddle him and he fell forwards onto Draco, pressing their lips together again, and again, and again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco gasped for air, swallowing Harry’s exhales, his chest heaving with the lack of air. Harry shifted his weight back to breathe for a moment and Draco immediately felt too cold, too empty. He leaned up to pull Harry down, kissing him more and more gently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco,” Harry panted. “Draco.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In between every kiss, and in the middle of them too, Harry sighed, “Draco, Draco, Draco.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco danced his hands up and down Harry’s rib cage, fitting his fingerprints in the dents of bones. Their open mouths spun and whispered, and Draco cried. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This might be the very last time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s hands trembled and Harry pulled back. And Harry, he was so beautiful. Looking down at him like that. His cheeks were flushed and his eyes red and bloodshot. His glasses were sitting a little crookedly and his dark curls were standing up on rumpled end. He looked broken, awake, but so lost. He searched Draco’s face, trying to commit every single thing about it to memory. Maybe he believed that he could hold on to this image if he died. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t look at me like you’re already dead,” Draco cried, all of his self restraint gone. His body shook under him with tremors and gasps for air. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I might as well be. You know this is a suicide mission. The tragic end of Harry Potter,” Harry snorted and rolled his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell them I got deathly ill, and you have to stay with me,” Draco looked down at Harry’s left knee. Shame coursed through him. He shouldn’t be asking Harry to stay home, that was just pure selfishness. This was his job.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know I can’t, Dray,” Harry murmured. Draco nodded slightly. “Do you know how beautiful you are?” Harry said after a moment in something that sounded a little bit like awe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s head snapped up in surprise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just look at you,” Harry said softly. “Your face all red from tears, and you’re still the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco shook his head a little. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You, you. You-- I can’t even describe….” Harry caught Draco’s face in between his hands, and leaned closer until their noses were just touching. “I love you so, so much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry continued closer until their lips just barely met, tentative and afraid. A blaring sound erupted from the fireplace, and Harry sat straight up abruptly, his head turning to stare at the fireplace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In one fluid movement, Harry snapped back around, kissed Draco hard, and before Draco could even blink, he was off the couch, picking up his cloak and standing in the fireplace. He stared at Draco and as the flames burned up around him, he closed his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was gone. Gone, gone, gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you,” Draco whispered into the now cold living room. No one answered.</span>
