  <i>July 1998</i>
</p><p>Rosmerta came to the hospital every night. She preferred coming at night, when it was quiet and the only other people around were the healers. The first time she'd come, a few days after the battle, the healers had turned her away. The next time, after an owl from Kingsley, she had been grudgingly allowed into Severus' private room. The plate of homemade shortbread biscuits she'd brought for the staff had helped smooth the way and she had been shown into his room. Paid for, she'd learned later, by Harry Potter. After that, she didn't have any problems visiting at all hours apart from the occasional admonishment that she not disturb the patient. As if anything she did or said could disturb him in his current comatose state.  </p><p>She glanced at the bed, and the wizard in it. Rosmerta was used to his appearance now, but the first time she'd seen him after the battle had shocked her to her soul. He had lost so much blood that his skin was deathly pale. Around his neck had been wrapped a blood-stained bandage. If the matron hadn't warned her about the nature of his wound, Rosmerta would have wondered about the quality of his care. She'd helped Severus take precautionary steps before he met with Voldemort the final time, anticipating the evil wizard's treachery. Even so, the delay in the discovery of his body, and in the administration of the Blood-Replenishing potions, meant that it wasn't certain if he would ever fully recover from his coma. </p><p>Tears filled her eyes and Rosmerta dashed them away irritably. That sort of thinking did no one any good, least of all Severus. To distract herself from those maudlin thoughts, Rosmerta thought instead about how she'd come to know and love Severus Snape.</p>

</center><i>August 1971</i><p>The door to the Three Broomsticks pub opened and Rosmerta glanced up for a moment before returning her attention to the pint she was pulling. In that moment, she noted that the customers who had just entered were a dark-haired witch and a young wizard who could only be her son; that they had been shopping, and that they had seated themselves at a small table near the fireplace on the other side of the pub. And she also noted that the witch had been beautiful once, but she now seemed careworn and weary. Their clothing was neat but a bit shabby, which explained the careful way that she counted her money as they consulted the menu together. </p><p>Rosmerta had just turned twenty-one and she had been working in the pub for two years. During that time, she had discovered that not only did she have a knack for dealing with the public, she was becoming rather a good cook too. And she loved everything about working in a pub. She even enjoyed tossing out the occasional drunken yob using a spell that her boss Henry had taught her. </p><p>When the dark-haired witch approached the bar, Rosmerta observed that her son watched his mother with dark eyes that had already seen too much. She smiled and said, "Been shopping? Is the lad starting at Hogwarts this year?"</p><p>"Yes," said the witch with a smile of pride. "We've just finished at Diagon Alley. I told him I'd bring him here as a treat before we return home. We will have an order of fish and chips—small—a cider and a butterbeer, if you please."</p><p>"Right away." Rosmerta took the order to the kitchen and then prepared their drinks and carried them to the table and set them down.</p><p>She was kept busy with the other punters until the bell rang announcing that their order was ready. Rosmerta fetched the food and an extra plate and carried everything to the table. She had set the plates down and turned to walk away when she felt a hand on her arm. She turned back to their table with a questioning smile.</p><p>"Miss, I'm afraid you've given us the wrong order," the witch said. "This is the large fish and chips. We ordered the small."</p><p>Rosmerta widened her eyes and placed a hand on her neck. "Did you? Oh, dear." She sighed. "It's not the first time this has happened when I'm busy. Well, it's my mistake, so you'll only be charged for the small, of course."</p><p>"I don't know—" The dark-haired witch was torn. Her son shot a too-sharp gaze at Rosmerta, who kept her face arranged in a bland expression, but wasn't sure that the young wizard quite believed it. </p><p>"I can change it if you like, but this will only be thrown in the bin. It's already come out of the kitchen, you see." Rosmerta chewed her lip. "You'd be doing me a favor, honestly. I really don't want my boss to know I've made another mistake with an order."</p><p>"Oh, that's all right, then."</p><p>"Cheers!" Rosmerta hurried away from the table and busied herself behind the bar. She watched surreptitiously as the dark-haired witch divided the food with her son and they dug in. Satisfied, she focused on the other customers. Before long, they were standing in front of the bar. </p><p>"Thank you. The food here is just as good as I remember." The witch nudged her son.</p><p>"Thank you, miss," he said solemnly. "Best fish and chips I've ever had."</p><p>Rosmerta believed him. She smiled and took the money to the till. "High praise indeed. There you are, madam." She handed back the change and winked at the young wizard. "Enjoy your first year at Hogwarts, young master." He blushed and she chewed the inside of her cheek to keep from smiling. </p><p>After they left, Henry came out of the kitchen, drying his hands on a towel. "That was very kind—no you don't have to pay the difference, my girl!" He waved her away from the till, then looked at the door and frowned. "I recognized that witch, although it took ages for me to place her. She was Eileen Prince when she attended Hogwarts. Used to come in here every Hogsmeade weekend, she did. As lovely and lively a witch as you ever saw." He frowned. "Or she was until she married that Muggle tosser Toby Snape and moved away."</p>

</center><i>August 1972</i><p>Eileen and Severus Snape returned to the Three Broomsticks before the start of term the following year. While Eileen seemed much the same, Severus seemed...well, <i>bleak</i> was really the only word to describe his mood. Unlike the previous year, he did not seem to be anticipating going to school. </p><p>As he'd requested, Rosmerta told Henry that the Snapes were there and after a few minutes, he came out of the kitchen. He glanced around the pub, pretended to spot them, and made a beeline to their table. He made a big show of recognizing Eileen, fussed over her son until he blushed, and then insisted that they order what they like because their meal was on the house. When the food was ready, Henry brought it to the table himself. Then he sat down and chatted with Eileen. Severus opened his copy of "Hogwarts: A History" and slouched down behind it, reading as he ate.</p><p>Only Rosmerta noticed when he dashed a tear from his cheek.</p>

</center><i>July 1998</i><p>"Finally got to see you on your own when you came for your first Hogsmeade weekend, didn't I love?" </p><p>Rosmerta had just arrived at the hospital. She had run into her favorite of Severus' healers, Healer Lacie, in the corridor. Lacie had suggested talking out loud to him as a way to stimulate his brain. It wouldn't hurt, and it might help rouse him. </p><p>"You came into the pub so soon after we opened that I had a feeling that you were waiting outside." She chuckled. "And you were."</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*~~~*~~~*</p>
</center><i>August 1973</i><p> He had grown into a tall, lanky youth; all angles and nose with longish, unkempt black hair and piercing black eyes. He ordered a butterbeer, took it to his usual table and sat down facing the door, watchful and wary. She passed it off as just a teenage mood until James Potter and his friends sauntered in.</p><p>Rosmerta was busy serving when she heard it. </p><p>"Snivellus! We've been looking for you."</p><p>"Leave me alone." </p><p>"Aw, are you afraid, Snivelly?" </p><p>"Of you alone, Potter?" Severus sneered. "No chance. But I rather think that <u>you</u> are afraid of <u>me</u>, since you never come at me unless it's four to one."</p><p>There was the sound of a hex firing, a hiss of pain and then mocking laughter. Rosmerta hurried over to the table where she found James Potter, Peter Pettigrew, Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, whose wand was raised and pointed at Severus, in a semi-circle in front of him. All of them were laughing at Severus, who was standing, pale and steely eyed, with his own wand pointed unwaveringly at Sirius. Rosmerta's temper flared when she saw the red weal on Severus' cheek. </p><p>"What in Merlin's name is going on here?" she snapped. She was gratified to see that she had startled the so-called 'Marauders'. Severus, of course, had seen her coming.</p><p>Sirius turned, tucked his wand into his back pocket, and smiled. "Just having a bit of fun, Rosie."</p><p>"First of all, Sirius Black, it's <i>Madam Rosmerta</i> to you," she growled. "And secondly, it doesn't look to me as if Mr. Snape is having much fun." She was inwardly pleased when young Mr. Black's smile faded. He was used to getting by on his easygoing charm, but she wasn't falling for it today. Her glance included all four of them. "Clear off. Next time you come in here, mind your manners and keep your wands in your pockets. If this is repeated, I'll send an owl to your head of house." She kept her hands on her hips and watched as they slunk out of the pub.</p><p>"Thank you, Madam Rosmerta," Severus said, his voice prickly. "But I could have handled them." </p><p>“I'm sure that you could have, but the behavior in this pub is my responsibility, Severus Snape," she replied with a flash of temper as the pub door closed behind the miscreants. She turned toward Severus and gentled her tone. "My friends call me 'Rose'. And I count you as a friend." She didn't miss the expression of surprised pleasure that crossed his face for an instant. </p><p>He lowered his head so that his hair fell forward and hid most of his face. "Um, wow. <i>Icountyouasafriendtoo</i>," he replied, just loud enough for her to hear. "I'm going to get back to my homework now."</p><p>"You're supposed to be relaxing," she reminded him as she returned to her duties. "Next time you come, no homework!" From that day forward, much to her delight, when Severus came to the pub on Hogsmeade weekends, more often than not he read a book.</p>

</center><i>July 1998</i><p>The next night when Rosmerta entered Severus' room, she leaned over, gently brushed his hair away from his face, and kissed his forehead. She had visited Hogwarts that afternoon, and used the library to do some research on comas. Aside from talking to the patient, other suggestions she'd read were things like touching them and introducing scents such as flowers or perfume. </p><p>She placed a bundle of sweet-smelling dried plants and herbs she'd received from Pomona Sprout on the table beside the bed. Professor Sprout had chosen things that would be most commonly used as potions ingredients. Rosemerta laid a hand against his cheek for a moment before she settled back into her chair beside his sickbed and continued her one-sided conversation.</p><p>"But those four blighters just couldn't stop bullying you, could they, love? And so, you turned to some of the others in Slytherin House." She sighed. "Henry died during your Fourth year, so I was more distracted. That silly sod only went and left the pub to me! Of course, I'm glad now, but then—cor. Such a huge responsibility for a twenty-four-year-old witch! It's no wonder I don't remember much about that year, and wasn't as watchful as I might have been...not that you ever brought your Slytherin friends to the pub!" She sighed. "But your Fifth year, well now. I do remember a few things about that one."</p>

</center><i>August 1975</i><p>Severus Snape walked into the Three Broomsticks with a small satchel and without his mother. As he made his way to the bar, Rosmerta thought in passing that his black hair and eyes against his pale skin was a pleasing contrast. The young wizard was not attractive in a conventional way, but there was a magnetism about him that had drawn the gaze of more than one witch as he walked through the pub and stopped at the bar in front of her.</p><p>"Hello, love." She looked from Severus to the door and back. "Your mum not with you?"</p><p>He bent his head so that his hair to fall forward and hid most of his face. "She died last month."</p><p>"Oh, I'm so sorry, Severus." She reached across the bar and laid her hand on his. "I know you'll miss her. Didn't your father die last year?" He nodded. "Where will you stay?"</p><p>"The Headmaster said I can stay at the school," he tossed his hair back off of his face and his eyes dared her to pity him. "Hogwarts will be my home until I graduate and then I'll move into the house on Spinner's End. It's mine now."</p><p>It struck Rosmerta that Severus' voice was much deeper than it had been the previous year, which only added to his charisma... in her opinion. "Aye, that's good of the Headmaster. You are always welcome here too, Severus. Don't forget it, mind. Now," she put her hands on her hips. "What'll you have?"</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*  *  *</p>
</center>The second Hogsmeade weekend of that school year, Severus stormed into the pub, stomped back to his usual table and threw himself into the chair.<p>There were no other customers, so Rosmerta raised her voice and called out: "Oy, you! Mind the furniture!"</p><p>The young wizard rose, thrust his hands into his trouser pockets, and with his head down, shuffled to the bar. "Sorry, Rose," he muttered.</p><p>She gentled her tone. "What's the matter, love? It's not like you to mistreat the furniture."</p><p>"Only just been nearly murdered last night, that's all." He growled. </p><p>"What? Who?" Rosmerta sputtered. "Explain!"</p><p>"Same old song. Dumbledore's favorites having a go at me again," he snarled. "I've been trying for ages to find out where Lupin goes once a month—which I already suspected why, I'm not stupid—so last night Black decided it would be a laugh to show me. Told me how to stop the branches of the Whomping Willow. I found a tunnel and had gone inside. I heard a growl and looked up..." He paused and looked into her eyes. "There was a werewolf at the end of the tunnel. Seeing it confirmed my suspicion about Lupin."</p><p>Rosmerta gasped. "You're joking!"</p><p>Severus scowled. "I wish I was. Like I said, I had already figured that part out, but last night when I saw him...I-I froze. And then—Potter, <i>Potter</i> of all people! He grabbed me and pulled me out of the tunnel." His expression soured. "That toerag saved my life, so I guess I owe him a life debt now." He closed his eyes. "Do you want to know the worst part?" </p><p>Rosmerta watched him breathe in and out several times as he fought to bring his raging emotions under control. </p><p>"The worst part is...Dumbledore swore me to secrecy! I'm the bloody victim, yet I have to keep my attempted murder a secret?" He balled his hands into fists and when he opened his eyes they shone with tears of betrayal. "Well, screw him. How can he ask that of me?." His chin quivered. "I can't. I'll go mad." He closed his eyes again and his tears fell down his cheeks. "So-so that's why I told you," he said softly. "I-I know you can be trusted." When he opened his eyes once more, he had regained control of his emotions. "Rose...I could have been bitten and possibly killed by a werewolf during the full moon and-and all the Headmaster could think of was to protect Potter and his friends."  </p><p>Rosmerta's heart broke for him. "Oh, Severus...I'm so sorry."</p><p>"It's fine. <i>Fine</i>. At least now I know how things stand. And I still have Lily's friendship, so that's something they can't take away from me."</p><p>"Don't forget that you've got my friendship too, Severus. You can trust me to be here when you need someone to talk to. "</p><p>He bent his head, but before his hair hid his face, Rosmerta saw one of his rare smiles. "Thanks, Rose. That means a lot."</p><p>"So, what'll you have?"</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*~~~*~~~*</p>
</center><i>July 1998</i><p>Rosmerta took one of Snape's cold hands and rubbed it gently between hers. Once she'd warmed it a bit, she lifted it to her lips and kissed it gently before laying it back down under the blanket. "We only thought that that was the worst thing that happened during your Fifth year..." She closed her eyes and tears slipped down her cheeks.</p>
