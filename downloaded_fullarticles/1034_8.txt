    <p>The Great Hall was silent enough to let a needle create an echo, if one had fallen on the stone floor. People looked at Professor McGonagall, Hogwarts’ new Headmistress with disbelief and shock on their faces.</p><p>Hermione could not for the life of her understand what the professor had just said, she could not process her words. It was as if the words could not enter her brain and she wanted to laugh at them, convinced that this was just some sick joke. That Minerva McGonagall had lost her mind in the rubble that was left of the school after the war was over and had not found it during the rebuilding of the great castle. <em>Surely she must be joking with us–</em></p><p>A cackling laughter tore through the silence like a knife cutting through thick butter. The source of the cackle sat by the teachers’ table. No one seemed to have noticed the dark figure hiding beside McGonagall’s seat. <em>Had she been there when they arrived?</em></p><p>”Thank you for the kind and warm welcome my dear <em>pupils,” </em>the dark haired woman’s voice screeched in juvenile joy at the apparent disbelief the students showed. ”I’m sure we’ll share wonderful moments together filled with knowledge.”</p><p>Mumbles stirred from the crowd. A young girl started crying and someone shouted that they wanted to leave the school immediately, that whatever was going on was crazy and intolerable. Hermione could not but agree.</p><p>”Silence,” McGonagall used her wand to let her voice thunder through the murmurs, making the students shift in their seat as the buzz ceased. </p><p>The Headmistress gazed over the disgruntled crowd, ”I know this may come as a shock to all of you. I assure you; I had no power in this and if I had any choice, this is not how I wanted this to end. However, the Ministry of Magic have ordered the school to set an example, to integrate those who are lost back into society of the good.”</p><p>Hermione glanced at a pale Harry, who stared at the table with a clenched jawline and gripping his arms to the point where his knuckles whitened. He was furious. Ron and Ginny both looked shocked, Neville had the face of someone who had lost everything. The atmosphere had gone from anticipation and joy to starting a new school year, to distrust and anger. The whole room, every House table, stared at the Headmistress hesitantly.</p><p>Hermione dared to look at the dark witch that would be their new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. <em>Professor Bellatrix Black Lestrange…What world have I come to? </em>Hermione thought that this must be some kind of Twilight Zone, a bad dream, some altered reality she had woken up to. Alas, that was not the case. She met the dark spiteful gaze of the other woman. Thick black curls hung around the pale face and the grin she wore sent cold shivers through her spine.</p><p>”Madam Black is to be re-instated into society, prove herself worthy of redemption. That even the darkest witch or wizard can show remorse and live a normal life–” McGonagall was interrupted by a snort, a gleeful smile spreading across the dark witch’s lips. The Headmistress ignored her and continued talking, ”and live among us an equal. She is to be supervised by me, and four Aurors will keep a protective eye on her and you, as I wish for neither of you, <em>including Madame Black</em>, to be harmed. She will not be unsupervised at any time of the day or night until she has proven herself stable enough to not cause any of you harm. Her wand will only be given to her by one of the Aurors if there is need for demonstration during class, so please walk these corridors assured that Madam Black will never be able to use magic to harm you.  </p><p>”It’s been a year since the war ended, since Voldemort’s rein ended. The war cost us many lives, many witches and wizards that shall never be forgotten. They will forever be kept inside our hearts and minds; their sacrifices will be honoured until we breathe our last breath on this planet. Let this war be a reminder of the importance of an open mind, of our equality. That life, in every form, has rights. Let this war also be a reminder of the importance of forgiveness and inclusion. Every living being has the right to roam the Earth free of harm and violence.”</p><p>Hermione knew the last sentence was directed at Bellatrix, who rolled her eyes defiantly. However, there was a lot of truth in what Professor McGonagall spoke. They should be forgiving. A prison such as Azkaban was not a humane way of dealing with criminals, and she was happy the old ways of dealing with prisoners had ended. The dementors had been annihilated, replaced by real human prison guards. Although Hermione agreed on most of the reformations that had been done in the Wizarding world during the last year, she had yet to understand this one. That one of the most vicious people she had ever met, that still sent trembles of fear through her veins, were free to walk the grounds of this school.</p><p>Bellatrix Black had mutilated Hermione, humiliated her, tortured her. She would never be free of the traumatic memories still haunting her that Bellatrix had caused her. She had believed her last year at Hogwarts would be the start of her recovery, the place where she would be able to cope with the nightmares, the anxiety and fear that still had her gasping for air through tears and gripping the sheets at night.</p><p>It had taken a year for the school to be rebuilt into its former glory. A year of Hermione, Harry and Ron starting to deal with the losses, burying friends and drying each other’s tears. They had lived at the Burrow, helping the Weasleys to rebuild their house back into a home. Both Harry and Ron had been unsure if they wanted to return to Hogwarts, their hearts heavy from the memories they had gathered throughout the years of Hogwarts. The impact of the events had finally dawned upon them, everything had crashed down upon them as if someone had kicked them in the guts.</p><p>Sometimes they had fallen into each other’s arms; Ron and Hermione’s budding love had ended somewhere around Christmas and all they searched for was comfort to get through the nights together. Now they were friends, the heated feelings that once had blossomed between them gone and replaced by a gentle warmth of friendliness. Ginny and Harry however, seemed to have found each other.</p><p>Now, one of the main sources of her insomnia and trauma would stand before her as a teacher.</p><p>The Headmistress still spoke, informing the students of other changes that had been made since the war, new routines and new safety measures that had been applied to the school system.</p><p>Harry still stared down at his plate, not even picking at the food that appeared in front of him during dinner. He was still furious, haunted by the memory of his godfather’s death among many others that the dark woman was responsible for.</p><p>”It’s unfair that she can sit there and enjoy herself this dinner while her cousin rots in his grave because of her…” Ron mutters as he downs another glass of butterbeer. </p><p>”I wonder how the Ministry could do this, could send her here and not to some Department where she can’t harm anyone, let alone harm a child!?” Ginny exclaimed in despair. Neville nodded in agreement. It was very strange that a school full of young helpless children would be put at risk, what if someone got in the way of her relentless rage? The woman was bloody insane!</p><p>”I don’t understand… I want her gone! I don’t care if it’s not humane to let someone be exposed at the hand of a Dementor, I want her dead.”</p><p>”We all do Neville,” Ron said. Hermione did not have anything to say. Something in her stomach told her that this would end badly. Someone would get hurt.</p><p>She had somewhere along the conversation put her hand on her arm, covering what was hidden underneath her Hogwarts robes. Even underneath all the woolly fabrics she could feel the uneven skin against her fingers as if her arm had been uncovered. She could still feel the steel in her flesh, carving uneven letters into her skin, into her soul. Her marked skin was stinging as if the scars were still bleeding.</p><p>Hermione shivered, a feeling of being watched washed over her and she turned around to get caught in the intense gaze of none other than Bellatrix Black. Her eyes were locked with the dark witch’s and she was unable to look away, determined to not look away and let the fear take control.</p><p>Bellatrix’s disgusted snarl turned into a maleficent grin. Hermione could not but succumb to the crippling fear as the other woman mouthed one simple word that made Hermione clench her hand over her scars and fear turned her blood to ice.</p><p>
  <em>”Mudblood.” </em>
