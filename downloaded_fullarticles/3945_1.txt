He rolled his sleeve up to show the Dark Mark on his forearm. "That's a <em>skull, </em> Severus! T hey don't have good connotations, and neither do snakes, and... and we're called the Deatheaters - <em>Death Eaters </em>- does that sound like a name you'd give the good guys? Or does it sound like we're cannibals?"</p><p>"Lucius, I cannot even <em>begin</em> to explain how much of a dunderhead you are..."</p><p>"I have more proof..."</p><p>"Lucius, you don't <em>need</em> proof! We <em>are</em> the bad guys! We follow a man who wants to euthanise most of the world! We torture people who disagree with us for fun and we use <em>Unforgivable </em> curses. What part of <em>that</em> makes you think we are the good guys in the first place?"</p><p>"Well the Dark Lord said... wait <em>D</em><em>ark Lord</em>... we <em>are </em>the bad guys."</p><p>"Oh for gods sake." Severus face palmed.</p></div>
