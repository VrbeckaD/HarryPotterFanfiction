  <b>Chapter One</b>
</p>
<p>Harry Potter rushed out of his cupboard and got started on his daily routine. He had learned from experience that it was best not to dawdle; Aunt Petunia didn't like that. Stomach rumbling, he set down his family's meal at the dining room table (his first task of the day was cooking breakfast).</p>
<p>Storming into the kitchen as per usual was his cousin Dudley, who by each month was starting to look more whale than human. Seeing the glare his aunt gave him as he glanced longingly at the food, he scurried off to work on his next task. Before he was able to leave the room, he was stopped by his uncle's booming voice, which was muffled by his smacking sounds around his unchewed food - something that never hesitated to make Harry cringe.</p>
<p>"Go get the mail, boy."</p>
<p><em> Boy</em>. Harry hated being called that word - even when it was the only name he knew until he started school and learned his real one. "Yes, Uncle Vernon."</p>
<p>Vernon Dursley was definitely where Dudley got his looks. Unlike Petunia's skeletal figure, Uncle Vernon was covered in fat with what had to be a triple chin. Needless to say, nothing about the man was pleasant.</p>
<p><em> No one's gotten the mail for a while I guess</em>, the young boy mused as he sorted through the letters on the way back to the kitchen. Suddenly he stopped dead, his attention caught by a letter with a curious address.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> Harry James Potter </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> Cupboard Under the Stairs </em>
</p>
<p>Looking around to make sure no one had seen, he hurried over to his cupboard and slipped the letter under his cot. Luckily his aunt didn't lock the door it when he wasn't in it. <em> I don't understand... That couldn't be for me. Who would send </em> me <em> anything? </em> He closed his cupboard door as quietly as possible, hoping that no one had noticed. <em> I'll look at it later. It can't be anything important anyway,</em>Â he reasoned. <em> Probably just a prank. </em></p>
<p>Harry slipped back into the kitchen, taking his family's plates and setting the mail down on the table.</p>
<p>"About time! What took you so long?" his uncle barked. Knowing Vernon, Harry knew he wasn't looking for an answer and continued washing dishes.</p>
<p>As soon as her nephew shut the water off, Petunia grabbed his upper arm and dragged him out of the kitchen, pushing him toward the entrance. "You know what to do next, boy."</p>
<p>"Yes, Aunt Petunia." Of course he did. Make breakfast; water the plants and work in the garden when needed; dust the house; pick things up; mop, sweep, and vacuum; etc. He always made sure to find work to do. He'd be punished if he was spotted being "lazy".</p>
<p>Usually his punishments were the same. Being locked in his cupboard for a couple days or going a week or so without food. Sometimes, however, Vernon would pull out his belt if he was having a bad day or if he did something worse. It had been a while since anything horrible happened, though.</p>
<p>When he first started school, he was getting good grades (having been excited to learn and be away from Dudley). Unfortunately, he quickly learned that as Dudley was <em> not </em>a good student, his aunt and uncle didn't like it when he did better in school than their precious child. After a harsh beating, Harry started failing on purpose to appease his family. He did have his priorities, after all, and living was definitely in his top 5.</p>
<p>Harry continued his work, eagerly waiting for night to fall when he could get his hands on that interested letter...</p>
<p>
  <em> Later that evening... </em>
</p>
<p>"Boy! Are you done yet?" Petunia snapped from the hallway.</p>
<p>"Yes, Aunt Petunia! Just finishing up." Harry washed the last plate of the day, feeling almost overwhelmed with anticipation. He almost ran to his cupboard, although he knew his aunt would be suspicious if he appeared too eager.</p>
<p>"Go on! I won't have you keeping me from my beauty sleep."</p>
<p>Harry almost snorted at that. <em> Is that what she calls it? </em>Her horse-like features were not what people would call "attractive". He held back though, opting to crawl into his cot and pretend not to hear. He waited impatiently for her to slam and lock the door. Only when he stopped hearing her footsteps going up the staircase above him did he finally reach beneath his covers and tear open his letter.</p>

  <em> HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY </em>
</p>
<p align="center">Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chief Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) </em>
</p>
<p><em> Wow, </em> thought Harry, <em> this guy sure has a strange sense of humor</em>. Internally shrugging, he continued reading.</p>
<p align="center">Dear Mr. Potter,</p>
<p align="center">We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no longer than July 31.</p>
<p align="center">Yours Sincerely,</p>

</p>
<p align="center">Minerva McGonagall,</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> Deputy Headmistress </em>
</p>
<p>Harry suddenly felt a surge of anger. <em> How dare they! </em>With a newfound fervour, he grabbed a sheet of paper and a crayon (both of which he stole from Dudley's second bedroom when he was picking things up) and began his reply.</p>
<p align="center">Headmistress,</p>
<p align="center">No thanks. I know this is a prank, and I don't think it's funny! Magic isn't real. Everyone knows that! Whoever you are, it wasn't smart to choose something that wouldn't fool anybody!</p>
<p align="center">Please don't contact me again!</p>
<p align="center">Harry Potter</p>
<p><em> There. I'll bet she won't expect that. </em>Leaving it for the morning, he tucked it under his cot and tried his best to fall asleep. In unconsciousness, he dreamt of strange things - things he did not remember upon waking.</p>
