    <p>I sit looking at our herd of thestrals grazing at the edge of the woods of our property. They were each beautiful in their own unique way. I always come to hear to think. I've been coming here since my mom died; when my emotions became too much for me to handle.  </p>
<p>Today I have come here for an entirely different reason. It is the best day of my life; I will be the first in my family to go back to the wizarding world in six generations. My family has a long history of practising necromancy, I will be the first to have both necromancy magic (that has been in my family since Agnotus Peverell and his brothers met and befriended Death) and wizard magic. This allows me to go to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>I grew up knowing about wizards and their prejudice against necromancy and how purebloods hated squibs, this has led to my family being hated by most of the Wizarding world. I am afraid, absolutely terrified to re-enter the world of my ancestors and the prejudice I will experience because of it. While contemplating the reason behind my angst my father called for me to get ready to leave.</p>
<p>"What time are we leaving dad, "my voice sounded anxious even to my own ears as I tried to hide my doubts from my father, knowing that he would know something is bothering me the moment he hears my voice.</p>
<p>My dad asks, "Thestral what's wrong?" He sits next to me and awaits my answer.</p>
<p>"Nothing dad there's nothing to worry about, it's just my nerves acting up again. It will all work out once I get to Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"If you say so but don't try and keep it to yourself, I'm always there for you," my dad says in his all-knowing voice making me feel as though he can see the future and not just the dead. "I will dad don't worry," trying my best to sound reassuring knowing it is useless but trying nonetheless.</p>

<p>We arrived at Kings Cross station about ten minutes before the train was set to leave. We weren't normally this late but neither of us really wanted me to go. It was strange, I felt like I stepped back in time where there were no Diesel trains and back to when steam trains were everywhere. If there was one thing I would change about the British wizarding world it would be their lack of modern technology.</p>
<p>"Well, we are here little thestral the start of your new adventure. Are you ready," my dads voice tears through my inner musings. "I really don't have a choice if I'm ready or not dad," I reply trying to lighten the tense atmosphere the has befallen us, both of us were scared of me going to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>I knew my dad was happy I had the chance to learn magic other than necromancy, but he was frightened of my departure, of being alone in our house with my mom gone. I, on the other hand, was terrified of learning magics that I have never seen before but was excited about leaving. I loved our house with its open plan and forest but ever since mom died it just hasn't felt the same.</p>
<p>"Yes, well it's for the best, I can't teach you magic even with our library I just don't have the knowledge. Just remember not to neglect your meditation because it will negatively influence your necromantic tranquillity which will have dire consequences," dad warned me. "I know dad, but I have to get on the train now or it will leave without me," I said already walking with my back towards the train. My strategic and well thought out escape plan was ruined by an anonymous person bumping into me knocking both of us to the floor. "Oh, sorry miss I didn't see you let me help you," the person immediately started to apologise. I was just about to thank his kindness and give my own apology when I looked up. I have never believed in love at first sight and always laughed when my dad said he fell in love with my mother the moment he saw her but seeing the person before me I knew my heart would never belong to another for as long as I lived. The object of my affections was a skinny boy with overly large clothes and eyes that matched mine. His hair looked as if he just got out of bed and his smile was shy but spoke a thousand words, most of them demanding my love and affection. "Sorry again miss, I-I have to go," he said most likely taking my speechless awe as an unwillingness to forgive his fault. I had to watch the person who I loved quickly made his way to the train I was seconds ago trying to escape to. Even though he went to Hogwarts, the same as me, watching his go made my heart physically ache.</p>
<p>"I suppose you are right you should get going little thestral goodbye and I will always love you, remember to write," my dad broke my love-struck silence. "Y-Yes, goodbye dad love you and I will send Morrigan with a letter as much as possible," I called already running for the train that was about to leave.</p>
<p>I was walking in the train trying to find an empty compartment with each one feeling more disheartened than the last. I passed the one with My Love in but was too scared to even say hello much less ask to sit there so I passed. I passed one where a set of red-haired twins were looking at a tarantula being showcased by a boy with dreadlocks. I even passed one with a bunch of stuck-up pure-bloods not knowing for sure if they were but the stuck-up atmosphere and their contest of trying to get their nose to touch the ceiling gave the impression. About half-way through the train, I gave up trying to find an empty compartment and just trying to find one with the least people in. I finally came across one with one person in it, they were rubbing their owls head they looked to be deep in thought, so I slid open the compartment door and hesitantly greeted trying not to let my nerves show, "He… Hello?"</p>
