  <em>...They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning…</em>
</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Harry had always been relatively comfortable with death. When he first began to go to school, and learned that most had people had parents and not just aunts and uncles, he’d asked Aunt Petunia about it. There’d been no quibbling about his parents being “late” or “departed” or “with the angels.” </p>
<p>Harry still remembered how Aunt Petunia’s lips had crumpled in like she was sucking on a lemon. “They died,” she said with some relish. There was a hint of lipstick on her perfect white teeth, fresh blood as she angled in for the kill with her usual surgical precision. “Car crash. Your father was driving drunk. That’s how you got the scar on your forehead; you’re lucky your father’s carelessness didn’t kill you as well. For that matter, you’re lucky that we that we took you in. Out of the graciousness of our hearts, you know.” She sniffed, wrinkled her nose. </p>
<p>“Thank you, Aunt Petunia,” Harry responded. </p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>In Little Whinging, church fundraisers were prime opportunities to demonstrate ones’ status, and this newest fundraiser, this time for, rather stereotypically, starving children in Africa, was no different. </p>
<p>The preacher rhapsodized on the pain of these starving children, speaking of the pain and suffering they experienced. On the new projector screen, they displayed children so malnourished you could could count their ribs forty feet away. Aunt Petunia delicately wiped her eyes on a monogrammed handkerchief and Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat. </p>
<p>“Starving” was an interesting word, Harry reflected, kicking his small legs. Starving starving starving he thought. It was an unsettling word. Sounded sharp like a knife, or like the hollowness of his own stomach. Tasted kind of like the lump in his throat as he thought about how sometimes he felt so light headed and his rib cage stuck out of his chest and he was always a little bit hungry and his teacher said growing boys were supposed to eat lots of food. </p>
<p>After church there was always a carefully catered array of food spread out for the churchgoers to munch on. Dudley would always run to get there first, so he could stuff cookies down his pockets before anyone else could get to them. He would then spend the rest of the time at church eating his hoarded food, while Aunt Petunia exchanged gossip with the other women, and Uncle Vernon blustered about stocks and politics with the other men. </p>
<p>Harry knew the food wasn’t for him, but he was so hungry, and… they didn’t want the children in Africa to be hungry, right? And he was hungry too... he just happened to be in Little Whinging, not Africa. He wasn’t sure if the logic was completely sound, but he was so hungry, and that chocolate cupcake looked so, so good- he’d never had one before- his hand inched towards it seemingly of its own volition. </p>
<p>Aunt Petunia slapped his hands, and as if she had slapped the words out of him, “I’m starving!” burst out of him. He regretted the words the moment they fell past his clumsy lips. Everyone was staring. He must have said it wrong- or… something. The housewives were starting to whisper behind their hands. </p>
<p>“Pardon me,” Aunt Petunia said with a tight smile. She grabbed Harry’s wrist with her bony fingers. Her nails dug into Harry’s skin and he swallowed a yelp. The overhangs outside were tiny, and Harry had to stand out in the drizzling rain so Aunt Petunia’s makeup wouldn’t run. </p>
<p>“You are not <em>starving</em>,” Aunt Petunia hissed. “We are feeding you good, homemade, nutritious food, using our hard earned money to do so. To pay for a no-good, bratty, hanger-on, <em>freak</em>. You should be <em>grateful</em>.” </p>
<p>“Sorry, Aunt Petunia,” Harry mumbled. </p>
<p>Aunt Petunia examined him critically for a minute, then shook her head in disgust. “Go wait by the car. Do not touch <em>anything</em>, and don’t you <em>dare</em> chip the paint. Don’t make this worse for yourself.” </p>
<p>Harry trudged to the car and stood in the rain. Aunt Petunia was probably right, he thought. He wasn’t that skinny, right? Harry glanced his arm, and slowly wrapped his fingers around the middle of his forearm. His thumb and pinky could touch if he squeezed a bit. Harry was the smallest boy in his class. </p>
<p>Okay, he was skinny. But… that didn’t really mean anything. Aunt Petunia told Dudley people naturally had different sized bones. Maybe Harry just had really tiny bones. Harry’d never been to the doctor, but he bet if he went, they would say he was fine. </p>
<p>He may be hungry, but he wasn’t going to die of it? Right? </p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>Ripper liked to chase Harry around almost as much as Dudley and his gang did. He liked to snap at his heels when he got close, as if specifically to torment him. This always made Aunt Marge laugh, but terrified Harry that one day he would actually take a big bite out of Harry’s heel. </p>
<p>Harry was a couple of months from turning nine when Ripper finally caught up. Harry tripped over his own foot, and went careening out onto the lawn. Ripper flew through the air and tackled Harry, biting into the back of Harry’s leg so hard that for a moment Harry thought his entire leg had been bitten off. Harry screamed like lungs were going out of style. </p>
<p>Aunt Marge lumbered over and pulled Ripper off, saying something about how Harry shouldn’t have been taunting him. Harry couldn’t hear her over the blood rushing in his ears.</p>
<p>“Get into the house!” Aunt Petunia ordered. “Go wash it off. Don’t get blood on my sinks, I just cleaned them.” It had been Harry who washed the sinks, actually. He limped inside as fast as he could.</p>
<p>In one of Dudley’s TV shows, one of the characters had gotten bitten by a dog. He’d started foaming at the mouth and shaking his head around like he was a dog himself. One of the other characters had said something about the dog having rabies. Did Ripper have rabies? Was that why he acted so crazy all the time? </p>
<p>Harry carefully washed his leg, his hands shaking all the while. He didn’t know if the character had died. Aunt Petunia had set him to doing chores before the episode had finished. </p>
<p>Harry bandaged the bite as best he could and tied it tightly. He wanted to tell himself he would be fine, but he kept on thinking of that TV episode. If he died, the Dursleys probably wouldn’t even hold a funeral for him. Even if they did, no one would come to mourn him.</p>
