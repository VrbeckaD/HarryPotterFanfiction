    <p>The moment she enters the bar in her no-nonsense shoes, hair in a tightly coiffed bun and her “Thursday” robes, I know I’m fucked. </p>
<p>Her name has been on my list for more time than I care to admit now. At first, I just thought my aim was off, but frankly, I’ve not had a miss with anyone else in an impressively long time. I’m good. Really good. </p>
<p>But, here she is. Single, still. And wearing those god-awful, drab brown robes she usually reserves for Thursday, her least favorite day of the week. </p>
<p>She nods at the bartender and takes her seat primly as he smirks into the glass he’s drying with a rag. “Another tonight, Granger?”</p>
<p>“So it would seem.” She calls over her shoulder without looking back.</p>
<p>I rub my hands down my face and take a deep breath. This is getting embarrassing.</p>
<p>“Not expecting much success?”</p>
<p>She sniffs, crossing and uncrossing her legs as she leans back into her chair, eyeing the door warily. “Just not particularly excited.”</p>
<p>“I see that.” </p>
<p>She purses her lips as she stares at the door and he goes back to working. </p>
<p>I’ve never been particularly bad at my job before Hermione Granger. I’m not entirely certain what is happening, but I’ve taken aim and missed more than ever before for…too long, now. After a series of terrible dating service debacles, Hermione has turned to the aid of her friends. The problem is, they seem to all have terrible taste. I know this, because before I intervened, they were involved in the most terrible of relationships themselves. </p>
<p>I gaze around the pub and smile, taking pride in my past successes. Stan Shunpike and Millicent Bullstrode are to be wed next week-- a particular stroke of genius, if I do say so myself. They’re currently sharing a plate of chips and he’s whispering something in her ear. Judging by the color spreading across her cheeks, it’s something filthy. </p>
<p>The door chimes ring and I glance up as a tall man walks through the door. Hermione hisses, a sharp inhale, as he walks through the door. She’s mumbling and shaking her head ever so slightly as he swaggers toward her, coming to a stop just in front of her. The grin spreading across his face makes even me raise an eyebrow. </p>
<p>“Hermione!”</p>
<p>“Mr. McLaggen.”</p>
<p>“Aw, doll. I think we can start on more familiar terms than that!”</p>
<p>“Formality suits me.”</p>
<p>He laughs and she cringes. Actually cringes. Visibly. It’s a full body shudder. </p>
<p>He doesn’t seem to notice. </p>
<p>“It’s been a long time.”</p>
<p>“It certainly has.” She concedes as the bartender strides up beside them. </p>
<p>“How can I help you this evening?”</p>
<p>“Just pumpkin juice, please.” Hermione speaks quickly into her lap. </p>
<p>“A firewhiskey.” The man murmurs, staring intently at Hermione. “So, what keeps the famous Hermione Granger busy these days?” </p>
<p>“Work.”</p>
<p>He waits expectantly and smiles even bigger when she says nothing further. “Well, I’ve heard a bit from Neville, of course. You keep a low profile, Ms. Granger.” </p>
<p>I don’t like the emphasis he puts on her name, but at this point I’d pair her with the Giant Squid just to cross her name off of my list. </p>
<p>She doesn’t seem particularly amused either. </p>
<p>“And you, Mr. McLaggen?”</p>
<p>“I thought you’d never ask!” He’s laughing, scooting his chair closer to her around the table, seemingly oblivious as she inches away. “Playing quidditch still, just for laughs, of course. I work for my father’s company-- taking it over slowly. Haven’t had much luck in the romance department though.”</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine why.” She deadpans and I chuckle into my bow. </p>
<p>“Well, lots of travel for starters, hard to settle down and get to know anyone. But, I know you already, don’t I?”</p>
<p>“Do you?” She murmurs, nodding thanks to the barkeep as he sets a glass of pumpkin juice down before her. </p>
<p>I pluck an arrow from the quiver upon my back, wanting to get this over with as quickly as possible, and take aim. </p>
<p>A number of things transpire at once, and though a god I may be, the sight I have not. So it is with as much surprise as to anyone that the scene before me unfolds as the arrow leaves my bow: </p>
<p>The barkeep turns, glass of firewhiskey on his tray, as the chime sounds over the door once again. A tousle of messy hair and glasses barrels through the door towing a man haphazardly behind him as he races toward them, bellowing her name.</p>
<p>“Hermione!”</p>
<p>The man he’s towing trips forward over the threshold and careens into the barkeep. The firewhiskey leaves the tray, launching into the air as McLaggen rises to his feet in shock. Hermione’s chair slips sideways as the barkeep tumbles to the floor. She lands on the ground with a thud as my arrow meets an unintended mark. </p>
<p>I hear a string of swear words fall from my lips and then my mouth hangs agape like a fish.</p>
<p>“Hermione! Neville just told me you were going to be here with him,” he jerks a thumb over his shoulder toward a dumbstruck Cormac as he helps her to her feet. “I had no idea it was him!” </p>
<p>She is straightening her robes and staring at Cormac and Neville who are staring at one another as I cringe and want to disappear. </p>
<p>“Harry--”</p>
<p>But she is interrupted. “Don’t go out with Hermione. I-- I-- I love you.” The man Harry towed in is sputtering as he steps forward. </p>
<p>“Oh, fuck me.” I mutter as Cormac swats at his shoulder where I hit him with the arrow and he locks eyes with the blubbering idiot. </p>
<p>“Longbottom?” Cormac murmurs, a question, as he takes a step toward him.</p>
<p>Longbottom… I pause and look at my list. The name looks familiar and I scan. Longbottom, Augusta, I glance up again. He doesn’t look like an Augusta. I continue down the list and there he is: Neville Longbottom. </p>
<p>“It’s always been you.” </p>
<p>I cross Longbottom, Neville and McLaggen, Cormac off my list quickly and look back down at them all again. McLaggen is holding Neville’s hands now, looking both smarmy and bewildered. Hermione and Harry are staring at them, the barkeep is pulling himself back up from the floor, and I still want to fucking die. This couldn’t possibly be worse. </p>
<p>“Nice job, little brother.”</p>
<p>I close my eyes and stop breathing. </p>
<p>How does a god die? Can I figure it out and be successful before this day continues?</p>
<p>I glance down again and Cormac McLaggen and Neville Longbottom are locked in an embrace. I begin to wonder if they’re still breathing because their mouths are clearly occupied elsewhere and their noses seem to be smushed together in an impossible fit of puzzlework.</p>
<p>Hermione is standing now, a nonplussed look upon her face as she, Harry and the barkeep stare at the scene before them.</p>
<p>“Dating you seems to have a unique affect on people, Granger. I’ve seen more of your dates find their one true love than...”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you.” Her voice is clipped and I dare a glance at my brother beside me. He is rolling on the floor, tears of laughter streaming down his face. </p>
<p>I really hate that man. </p>
<p>“Nott and I ran into Neville and he was blubbering on about Cormac finding love. I’m so sorry, Hermione. As soon as I figured out it was you he set him up with we dashed here. To think, he was in love with McLaggen himself!”</p>
<p>“I seem to have that effect on people…” </p>
<p>I can hear Hermione and Harry as I sit down and stare at my brother.</p>
<p>“What do you want, Tim?”</p>
<p>He’s struggling to his feet and I’m overwhelmed with the desire to kick him. </p>
<p>But, he’s a lot bigger than me.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you that one.” He says, ruffling my hair. “But, if you call me that again…”</p>
<p>“Metus does!” I protest, but I know it’s pointless because he’s not laughing any longer.</p>
<p>“Metus is my twin brother. You are my baby brother.”</p>
<p>I’m chewing my tongue when I respond. “What do you want, Timor.”</p>
<p>“It’s your lucky day, sprite.” </p>
<p>I wonder if I could shoot a poison tipped arrow at him with more luck than I currently have with Granger. </p>
<p>“Concordia has been watching you.” </p>
<p>I cringe. “She has?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. Father and I have been at war and have just returned. You’ve quite a gathering of spectators, brother.”</p>
<p>I wince. “Have I?”</p>
<p>“Metus is taking bets and Concordia is practically beside herself at your failures.”</p>
<p>“It’s not failures.” I grumble. “It’s just one. Just this one.”</p>
<p>“Your multiple failures with this one, are creating quite a stir back home.” He’s laughing again, clapping me on the shoulder. “I’ve come to help.”</p>
<p>I pale. “No.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. Father condoned it.”</p>
<p>“No. Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>“Too late, brother.”</p>
<p>“And what would YOU, God of fear know about love?”</p>
<p>He’s chuckling as he steers me. “My knowledge of love making is second to none!”</p>
<p>“Not love making! LOVE!”</p>
<p>But it is useless, and as he drags me from my cloud, a smile splitting his face, I have no choice but to follow under his iron tight grasp.</p>
