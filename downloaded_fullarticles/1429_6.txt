    <p>"I told you to go back to bed Reyna."</p><p>"And I told you that you can't make me." She retorted, instead paying attention to the Kelpie habitat in front of her.</p><p>"I don't want you to get your hand bitten off too." He stopped her feeding, making her look clearly at him. Bunty had left early for the day after she tried feeding the Kelpie by herself.</p><p>"You know I'm his favorite." She looked at him pointed. "If anything, I should be worried about him biting your hand off." And before he could utter another word, she took off her long cardigan, leaving her in a tank top and slacks. Newt turned around blushing, and failed to stop her from plunging into the water.</p><p>He remembered the day he met her for the first time. Strands of her hair stuck out from her pony tail as she approached him out of breath. Half of her face was covered in a large scarf, and the other half was pink from the harsh winter winds. They had communicated through owls before, but it was the first time they met face to face. She had persistently asked the magizoologist, hoping to assist him in caring for the animals and learning about the different magic species on the way. She was very interested in the care of magical creatures and who better to learn from than Newton Scamander himself. It didn't hurt to have Professor Dumbledore to owl him a letter of recommendation for her. After months of letters back and forth, Newt finally agreed to take her on as his assistant and arranged to meet at his next stop after New York.</p><p>They eventually returned back to London, where Newt was immediately given notice of his travel ban. But it wasn't too hard for the pair, as they had rescued many creatures on their travels and spent most of the day caring for them.</p><p>With so much time spent together, they became close friends. Newt wasn't sure what kind of person, other than persistent, Reyna was, and he was happy to have found out she was more of a homebody like him. Although, he did think she was much more stubborn than he was.</p><p>And with their close friendship and the help of the very descriptive wizard papers, Reyna knew pretty well what had transpired in New York. Newt regretted going into detail about the events because of her constant teasing about Tina and him, once she found out his feelings for the auror. What Newt hadn't noticed, was that the teasing had gradually stopped to the point he was the first one to bring up the topic of the auror.</p><p>Returning from his thoughts, Newt walked up the set of stairs to see the kelpie neighing contently and rub up against Reyna's wet frame. She threw him a thankful smile as he cast a drying spell on her clothes.</p><p>"So, any exciting news? " She asked, petting the kelpie with adoration. "Did the meeting with the council go well? Did they repeal your travel ban?"</p><p>"Credence is alive." He responded, making her pause. Newt had told her he had a feeling they were wanting to talk to him again about the events in New York.</p><p>"Where is he? I thought he died after New York." Her brows furrowed in confusion, slightly worried.</p><p>"He's in Paris apparently, trying to find his family. And they wanted me to find and kill him." He fisted tightly around the bucket he was holding, out of frustration.</p><p>Reyna couldn't understand the Ministry. Yes, Credence may be dangerous, but it was because of Grindelwald and his manipulation on the boy. And since Credence did not choose the path of destruction and wasn't 'evil', the Ministry would be asking Newt to take an innocent life.</p><p>The kelpie, satisfied at her petting, neighed happily at Reyna before diving back into the depths of its water. Absentmindedly she she started out into the water, asking, "Why are they trying to kill the poor boy, and why ask you out of all people? Your response should be obvious, no?."</p><p>Newt had wondered the same thing coming back from the meeting. "Well, my brother thought having the council ask me in person would change my mind somehow." He then thought back to Leta. Perhaps his brother also thought her presence could persuade him.</p><p>"So how is she?" she mumbled, trying to sound nonchalant. She wasn't sure what her feelings were to the man in front of her, yet. After the news of the travel ban, and living in the same house (different beds of course), she wasn't too keen on bringing up Tina or Leta. Not that she had ill feelings towards them, but the look on Newt's face when she brought up either name began to bring her mood down.</p><p>"I suppose she's doing well." She winced at his voice laced with small sadness. Newt didn't delve deep into his friendship with his soon to be sister-in-law, back at Hogwarts, but it wasn't hard to figure out the details of the parts unspoken.</p><p>Personally, she didn't know the woman well enough to have an opinion. But if she were to form one, based on the anecdotes from Newt and the recent engagement in the papers, she wasn't too fond of the Lestrange. She imagined that Leta knew of Newt's feelings for her, and in turn she probably had feelings for him as well. And if both were to be true, it wasn't the smartest decision to be engaged to his brother. But she was just an outsider looking in on their complicated relationship. Newt didn't need to have her two cents on the matter.</p><p>Newt's following words were brought to her attention "-was being followed."</p><p>"Wait, what? Why would they? You already turned down their generous offer." Sarcasm dripping from her voice.</p><p>"Well, perhaps it had to do with the impromptu meeting with Dumbledore. He would like for me to go as well, although for an entirely different reason. He wants me to go save Credence."</p><p>Her ears perked up at the mention of Dumbledore. "You have to go then. You have Professor Dumbledore's stamp of approval." She paused before adding, "And as your right-hand woman, I obviously have to go along with you!" She exclaimed, her mind already wandering off, making a list of what needed to be done before they could leave.</p><p>"Reyna, I can't go. And you definitely are not going." He returned back to counting all the baby nifflers to make sure none of them had escaped again.</p><p>"And why not? A ban has never stopped you before." Crossing her arms over her chest she stood in objection to Newt's response.</p><p>"I don't choose sides. If I were to go to Paris, I would have to eventually choose a side. I cannot do that."</p><p>"Newt, I love that you like to remain neutral and be a peacekeeper. But we can't just do nothing!" She raised her voice a little at him, getting worked up at his explanation. "One side wants to eradicate him. The other wants to use him as a pawn. Going to Paris and trying to save Credence is not choosing either side. We have the opportunity to stop this right now, and I, for one, can't do nothing. If we don't, people are going to die." Newt shook his head at her logic.</p><p>But before it could turn into a huge dispute in front of the niffler cage, a crash sounded upstairs and both looked to each other in confusion.</p><p>"Were you expecting someone?" she asked.</p><p>"Not at all."</p><p>Â </p>
