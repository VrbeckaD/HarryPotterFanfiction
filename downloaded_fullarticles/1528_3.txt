    <p>Vlad was in Hogwarts at last, though not quite the way he had envisioned it.</p><p>It had all started when he had fallen in love with an Englishwoman named Mirena. During their courtship, she had told him of her schooldays at Hogwarts. Vlad had gotten a very good impression of the school and wished for an opportunity to visit it.</p><p>As they discussed marriage and their future together, they naturally talked about which school they would send their children to. Vlad knew that any magical child he had with Mirena would be pureblood and welcomed at Drumstrang. However, that school had an increasingly dark reputation. Vlad knew how dangerous the Dark Arts were and did not want his children exposed to them as far as possible, and had even heard of several parents pulling their children out of Drumstrang.</p><p>Because Mirena remained a British citizen after marrying Vlad, their children would be British as well and eligible to go to Hogwarts if they were magical. They decided to move to Britain after Mirena became pregnant, to ensure their children would be able to attend Hogwarts. This reunited Mirena with her younger twin sister Mina, after living in Transylvania with Vlad during the first few years of her marriage.</p><p>While the move would help their future children get into Hogwarts, wizarding Britain was under a cloud of darkness due to the rise of the self-styled Lord Voldemort.</p>
