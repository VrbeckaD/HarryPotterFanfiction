    <p>“Remus, look!”</p><p>Remus looked up to see a rather large and fat bird perched on a thin branch. The branch was straining under the weight of the bird and looked as if it was about to snap off. The bird, unaware of the situation, twittered happily.</p><p>Suddenly, with a small cracking sound, the branch fell off and the bird crashed onto the ground. Chirping angrily, it spread its wings and flapped around, unable to take flight.</p><p>“Is it injured?”</p><p>“No, it’s too fat to fly. Watch.”</p><p>The bird got up and stalked over to another tree. It hopped onto an extremely low branch and made its way up onto a thicker branch. </p><p>“See, not injured.”</p><p>“You could paint that.”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Tonks.”</p><p>“Wotcher.”</p><p>Tonks was nibbling on a large eraser that was on her pencil. Her eyes were glued to her sketchbook.</p><p>“What are you drawing?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’m still thinking.” </p><p>Tonks spat out some eraser dust from her mouth. “Bleh.”</p><p>Remus couldn’t help but grin. “Perhaps you could draw that expression on your face.”</p><p>Tonks glared at him. “Not helping.”</p><p>“How about that bird, hmm?”</p><p>“What bird?”</p><p>“The fat bird.”</p><p>“Oh, right.”</p><p>Tonks frowned as she began to draw. Remus watched with polite interest and admired the way Tonks’s usually clumsy fingers worked gracefully, drawing arcs and lines and circles with ease. </p><p>“Why do you keep dropping things, even though your hands work perfectly fine?”</p><p>This startled Tonks, who dropped her sketchbook into a nearby puddle. She swore and picked it up, shaking the book.</p><p>“Look what you made me do!” Tonks said, exasperated. Remus looked at the bird, half of it was dark with water and the other part had a few brown smears, probably made by dirt.</p><p>“It looks fine,” Remus lied. Tonks glared at him and stood up, grabbing her things. </p><p>“I think I’ll go now.”</p><p>Remus watched her stride away, with an amused expression on his face.</p><p> </p><p>He was even more amused when he found a package mailed to his house. It was wrapped in newspaper and when Remus opened it, he found a large canvas with a black and white bird painted on with oil paints. The top part of the bird looked as if it was stained with something, possibly tea, while the bottom had brown marks all over it. Remus grinned and went to hang the painting up.</p>
