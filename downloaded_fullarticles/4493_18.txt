    <p>Looking up at the man at her door Nymphadora smiles. "Hello can I help you?" she asked leaning on the door frame. "I just moved in and thought I would get to know the neighbors" the older male said rubbing the back of his neck. "In that case would you like to come in for some tea?" the pink haired woman said as she moved to let him in.Remus smiles and walked in, looking around her apartment. It was kind of a mess, but that gave it a home feeling to Remus against his completely empty home.</p>
<p>	Walking into the kitchen Tonks put her ketel on the stove as she went to get every other thing needed. Walking to put the mugs down the girl tripped over her own feet, falling on the floor and breaking a mug. "Are you okay?" Remus called and walked to check on her. Seeing how she was he rushed over and helped her up, checking for any cuts. "Yeah, I'm fine. This happens all the time" Nymphadora says softly as she pushed hair out of her face. "Thank you for your concern...." She pauses not knowing the man's name. "Remus" he says "Thank you Remus" she said softly. "Also I'm Nymphadora, but please call me Tonks" she says looking away, almost embarrassed by her name. </p>
<p>	Once the two cleaned up and actually had their tea, they ended up talking for a few hours. Well mainly Nymphadora talked Remus was too embarrassed about his past to open up to the girl he just met. Catching the time the girl with pink hair looked shocked. "Fuck, it's late." she said seeing it read '11:17 p.m.' "I've kept you" she looks down. "Sorry I can be quite the rambler" "No it's okay,I enjoyed my stay" Remus said offering a smile to her. Getting up he walked to the door. "I'll see you again soon?" he asked looking at the girl who nodded happily. "Of course, my door is always open to you."</p>
