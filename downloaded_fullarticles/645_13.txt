    <p>In the bustling heart of King’s Cross, a young boy named Harry Potter felt very small and very lost as he searched high and low for platform nine and three-quarters. He was sure it had to be here, between platforms nine and ten, but it was getting closer and closer to eleven o’ clock and he still had not found it.</p><p>He was just about to ask one of the station guards for directions when a gentle tap on his shoulder captured his attention. Harry turned and came face-to-face with a boy around his age and nearly a head taller with short black hair and dark, sparkling eyes. </p><p>The boy smiled. He had a rather kind face.</p><p>“Hello. Sorry, I just thought you looked a little lost,” he said. He spoke with an American accent, something Harry had never heard before in person. “Do you need help?”</p><p>“Well, yes…” Harry hesitated, wondering how he could explain about platform nine and three-quarters without sounding utterly bonkers.</p><p>Unbidden, his eyes wandered towards the trunk on the boy’s trolley cart. It resembled his own, only it had various stickers—dragons, unicorns, and pumpkins—decorating its surface.</p><p>The boy grinned knowingly. “Hogwarts? Are you also a first-year?”</p><p>“Yes!” Harry said, practically sagging with relief. “Do you know how to get to platform nine and three-quarters?”</p><p>“Of course. Follow me, it’s right here.”</p><p>The boy led him to the barrier between platforms nine and ten. He made a sweeping gesture, as if to usher Harry straight towards it.</p><p>Harry stared incredulously. Was the boy having him on?</p><p>“It’s magic,” the boy said upon seeing Harry’s disbelieving face. “You just walk through it.”</p><p>Still, Harry hesitated. He could think of nothing more humiliating than crashing head first into a wall in the middle of a busy station. Going to school with Dudley had taught him that boys would always be mean and nasty when they felt like it, so he was reluctant to trust in this complete stranger.</p><p>The boy sighed at Harry’s blatant wariness, but nonetheless smiled.</p><p>“Okay, then. I’ll go first,” he said.</p><p>He lined up his trolley and, with an easy confidence, pushed it straight towards the barrier at a brisk march. Boy and trolley soon disappeared from sight.</p><p>Wide-eyed, Harry glanced around, but no one seemed to have noticed the boy’s disappearance. If anything, the people passing by seemed to be steadfastly ignoring Harry, when before they had looked at him oddly for loitering at the station with an owl in a cage.</p><p>Deciding to just get on with it, Harry gathered his courage and rushed the barrier at full speed, his eyes tightly closed. A large part of him expected to smash into it, despite the other boy’s example, so he was surprised and relieved when the impact never came.</p><p>Harry opened his eyes and was instantly rewarded with the sight of the most wondrous, bright-red steam engine steadily puffing out clouds of smoke as it readied to embark on its journey. The platform around it was packed with a colorful assortment of magical things and people. Harry greedily drank in the sights and sounds, swiveling his head this way and that to take in as much as possible.</p><p>The boy who had helped him find the entrance stood nearby, sporting a similar expression of wonder.</p><p>“I’m beginning to think I’m dead,” the boy muttered, seemingly to himself. </p><p>Harry did the polite thing and pretended not to hear.</p><p>In unspoken agreement, the two of them made their way down the platform together. They helped each other heft their heavy trunks onto the train, which left both of them sweaty and tired as they collapsed onto opposite seats in the only unoccupied compartment they’d found.</p><p>“I’m Sam, by the way,” the boy said, smiling.</p><p>Sam stuck out his hand and Harry eagerly shook it, wondering if this was how friends were made.</p><p>“I’m Harry. Harry Potter.”</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you, Harry. You’re pretty famous here.”</p><p>“But not where you’re from? You’re an American, right?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Right. Well, I’ve heard of you for sure, but I don’t think you mean the same thing in the U.S. since we didn’t actually have to deal with Voldemort.”</p><p>“My friend Hagrid says you shouldn’t say that name,” Harry said, even though he often forgot that rule himself.</p><p>Sam smiled again. He seemed to do that a lot. </p><p>“I know, but I guess I don’t want to be afraid of a name.”</p><p>Harry nodded. That made a certain amount of sense. Although, on the other hand, he’d seen how unsettled Hagrid had become after just whispering that name. Maybe it was better not to upset anyone with it.</p><p>“Is it very different in the States? Magic, I mean,” said Harry.</p><p>“No, not really. I’m…not the best person to ask about that,” Sam replied slowly, looking unsure for the first time. It was quickly replaced by another smile. “I’ve read a few books about Magical Britain, though. I know how things work around here, for the most part.”</p><p>Hearing this, Harry began to feel like maybe he didn’t belong after all. Aside from what Hagrid had told him, he didn’t know much at all about magic, American or British. Sam, a foreigner, probably knew far more than Harry, who had lived here since birth.</p><p>“I was raised by, er, Muggles. I don’t know anything about the wizarding world,” he mumbled.</p><p>“That’s fine. Really,” Sam rushed to assure him. “All the Muggle-born have that learning curve.” He paused. “We call Muggles <em> No-Majes </em> in the States. ‘No magic,’ get it? Anyway, it’s nothing to be ashamed about. I have a feeling you’ll do great.”</p><p>Harry had to smile a bit at Sam’s earnest expression. The other boy was very easy to talk to. They fell into a relaxed conversation about what Harry had learned so far and speculated on what other wonders lay in wait for them at Hogwarts.</p><p>Suddenly, the floor lurched and Harry realized the train was leaving the station. He and Sam pressed their noses against the glass, watching the platform and its inhabitants get left behind.</p><p>The compartment door slid open and a redheaded boy with a black smudge on his nose stepped in.</p><p>“You mind if I sit here?” he asked. “Everywhere else is full.”</p><p>Harry shook his head and Sam made a welcoming hand motion, so the boy happily took a seat next to Harry.</p><p>Before any of them could speak, the door opened again. Two identical older boys, also with red hair, poked their heads in.</p><p>“Hey, Ron,” said one of the twins. </p><p>“Listen,” said the other, “we’re going down the middle of the train—Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”</p><p>“Right,” mumbled the boy, Ron.</p><p>“Are you first-years too?” the first twin asked, glancing between Harry and Sam.</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, the second one added, “We hope you’re prepared to wrestle the troll.”</p><p>“Remember to mind the teeth. After all, their favorite food is small children!”</p><p>“Do try not to get stepped on! And they stink, so hold your breath!”</p><p>Sam laughed along with the twins, even as Harry and Ron paled.</p><p>“See you later, then. Bye, Ron, other firsties!”</p><p>“We’ll be rooting for you!” </p><p>The twins left, closing the door behind them. The compartment was quiet in their wake.</p><p>“Well, they seem nice,” Sam said after a while. He extended a hand towards Ron. “I’m Sam, by the way.”</p><p>He and Ron shook. Then Ron turned and shook Harry’s hand.</p><p>“My name’s Ron Weasley. Those were my brothers, Fred and George.”</p><p>“I’m Harry Potter,” said Harry.</p><p>Ron gaped at him, eyes wide as saucers. “You’re Harry Potter? Really? Can I see your you-know-what?”</p><p>He pointed at Harry’s forehead.</p><p>Harry obliged and swept his fringe to the side, revealing his lightning bolt scar.</p><p>“Blimey. Did it hurt?”</p><p>“I don’t remember. I was a baby when it happened,” Harry answered.</p><p>Ron nodded, continuing to stare at Harry’s forehead.</p><p>“Well!” Sam exclaimed, clapping his hands together and startling the two other boys. “Ron, why don’t you tell us a bit about yourself? Or your brothers. I’m assuming they’re twins?”</p><p>So Ron tore his gaze away from Harry’s famous scar and began regaling them with outlandish stories about the twins, who were quite the practical jokers. He went on to tell them about the rest of his family as well.</p><p>It turned out that Ron had more than two brothers—five, to be exact, all older than him—and a younger sister as well. This left Ron with all their old things, including Charlie’s old wand and Percy’s old rat. Ginny, his sister, was the only girl, so their parents bought her new clothes instead of requiring her to wear her brothers’ hand-me-downs. Ron seemed a little bitter when he explained that.</p><p>As the cityscapes gave way to the broad English countryside outside their window, Harry was content to simply sit back and listen. Ron had obviously been surrounded by magic his entire life and the things he talked about were wondrous and fascinating.</p><p>At one point, they were interrupted by a kindly woman selling sweets from a trolley. Harry, who had never been able to purchase anything for himself before, leapt up at the opportunity and bought some of everything.</p><p>Sam also approached the cart and it was here that Harry began to realize his new friend was a little…strange.</p><p>“Excuse me,” Sam began, holding up a Pumpkin Pasty to the trolley witch, “do these really explode?”</p><p>The woman frowned in polite confusion. “Whatever do you mean, my dear?”</p><p>Sam grimaced and said, “Um, actually, never mind.”</p><p>He sat back down with a look of faint consternation.</p><p>Deciding not to dwell on Sam's behavior, Harry then insisted on sharing his spoils with his two companions. They steadily made their way through the mountain of magical sweets (though Sam pointedly avoided the Pumpkin Pasties for whatever reason).</p><p>They were in the middle of tasting the Every Flavor Beans, making a game out of it, when the compartment door slid open to reveal a teary-eyed boy with a round face.</p><p>“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”</p><p>Harry and Ron shook their heads. Sam said, “Maybe you should ask a prefect for help.”</p><p>With a mumbled thanks and a miserable expression, the boy left.</p><p>“I had a toad once,” said Sam as soon as the door closed. “I caught it myself in the woods with my bare hands. Named it Dolores.”</p><p>“Why Dolores?” Ron asked.</p><p>Sam shrugged. “Just seems like a very toady name.”</p><p>“Did it do anything neat?”</p><p>“Not that I knew. It died in, like, a day.”</p><p>“Why? What happened to it?” asked Harry, aghast.</p><p>“Oh. Um, I trapped it in a bucket and forgot about it, so it probably starved.”</p><p>Sam smiled sheepishly while Harry and Ron stared at him in horror.</p><p>“In my defense, I was only eight at the time and had no idea what toads needed to survive,” he added.</p><p>Harry and Ron’s horror abated somewhat. Still, poor Dolores.</p><p>The compartment door slid open again.</p><p>“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” said a girl with large, bushy hair. She was already wearing her Hogwarts robes. Her two front teeth were significantly larger than the others, reminding Harry of a beaver.</p><p>Beside her was the timid boy with the missing toad. It seemed he’d found some help, though the girl looked a bit young to be a prefect.</p><p>“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” Ron said.</p><p>“Oh, well,” the girl said with a sigh. “Thank you for your time anyway. I’m Hermione Granger. This is Neville and his toad’s name is Trevor. Could you let us know if you see him?”</p><p>“Sure,” said Harry, but the girl and the boy were already moving on to the next compartment.</p><p>“All this fuss over a toad?” Ron wondered aloud. “At least I won’t have the worst pet at school. Can’t say Scabbers is much of an improvement anyway.”</p><p>Sam’s face took on a rather severe pallor as he stared at the fat, gray rat sitting in Ron’s lap.</p><p>“I’d rather…<em> not </em> talk about your rat,” he said queasily.</p><p>Instead of taking offense, Ron just nodded in a resigned sort of agreement.</p><p>They settled into their previous game of guessing Bertie Bott flavors. Ron, having eaten these sweets all his life, knew many of the flavors on sight and Sam often cheated by asking his opinion. Harry, on the other hand, found he liked taking chances. He gobbled down an ordinary-looking red bean, which soon turned out <em> not </em>to be cherry, as he had thought, but rather chili pepper. It was incredibly spicy.</p><p>When their compartment door opened yet again, a red-faced Harry was still fanning his open mouth, his eyes watering and snot trickling from his nostrils.</p><p>Three boys came in. The one in the middle was staring at Harry with intense scrutiny. Harry recognized him as the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s. </p><p>“So…” The pale boy cleared his throat. “You’re Harry Potter?”</p><p>Harry nodded wordlessly. A tear slid down his face.</p><p>“Well, I’m Draco. Draco Malfoy.”</p><p>Ron coughed, though it sounded more like a laugh. Draco turned to him with a scowl, but then Harry sniffled and panted and wiped his nose with his sleeve, drawing all attention back to himself.</p><p>The pale boy seemed to grow increasingly uncomfortable as Harry continued to leak fluids from his face. The two other boys with Draco, who looked much too large and mean for their age, just blinked stupidly at the peculiar sight.</p><p>“Are—are you all right?” Draco asked, his composure crumbling away.</p><p>Harry shook his head, not trusting himself to speak, for his mouth still felt very much on fire.</p><p>Draco winced and took a step back. “That’s too bad. I suppose I’ll see you around, then, Potter.”</p><p>He left in a hurry with his two bodyguards lumbering close behind.</p><p>Not even ten seconds after their visitors had gone, Sam burst into raucous laughter.</p><p>“You…you thought…it was <em> cherry! </em>” he wheezed out between helpless giggles. “And you scared him away…by crying!”</p><p>Ron soon joined in with loud guffaws, and even fell off his seat to roll around on the floor. As for Harry, he glared playfully at them both, though the effect was ruined when he had to wipe his nose again. It was odd; they were laughing at him, but all he felt was a giddy happiness that seemed to reach all the way down to his soul.</p><p>The laughter eventually petered out. The burning in Harry’s mouth dulled to an acceptable ache. A comfortable silence settled between the three of them as the train drew ever nearer to its destination. Harry looked out the window and marveled at the palette of colors cast onto the clouds by the setting sun. It really was beautiful.</p><p>“I’m looking forward to Hogwarts,” he said without thinking.</p><p>Ron sighed happily. “Me too.”</p><p>“Me three,” agreed Sam with a smile. “Let’s hope we don’t die.”</p><p>Harry figured he was joking.</p>
