    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Hadrian was running. Or in this instance, his new name in this Realm is Reagan. He was running to avoid being eaten by a giant Aspid, and it was closing in on him. But he suddenly came to a stop at a beach not far away from Fonsett Village where he grew up. It was night time, and he was lucky that no one was there to witness this. But he was also protected by his cloak and the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>Reagan, or Rex, that he called, his parents in this world must have run out of ideas when they named him. He was both amused and perplexed by his name. He turned around just in time to avoid the giant gap of the Aspid. A young woman then joined him. The young woman in question was, in fact, a Blade, which made him a Driver in this Realm. The Blade threw one of her Ether Cannon’s to him, and he caught it with ease. The size and weight didn’t bother him; after all, he had practice carrying heavy weapons. After all, his Scythe was not a natural weapon to handle, but then again, no one could touch it but him.  </p>
<p>The two of them put themselves in a position on each side of the Aspid to get a clean shot at it.</p>
<p>”KOS-MOS!” he called out and aimed his Ether Cannon from his side, and KOS-MOS nodded and mirrored his stance on the other side. They both locked on and started firing, and the Monster took damage. The Aspid roared in pain and anger, and Rex was pleased he had silently cast a silencing ward around the beach beforehand. Considering that roar, it would have pulled anyone towards them and wondering what was going on, and he rather not explain himself.</p>
<p>”X-Buster!” he called out and KOS-MOS, and she nodded and followed through with the order and fired the massive attack. The Aspid roared in pain and fell to the ground and started dissolving, indicating that they had managed to kill it. Both of them skidded to a stop on the white sand on the beach.</p>
<p>”That was pretty easy KOS-MOS, I think I need to accept harder Hunts,” he said and lowered his hood, you could now see his face. </p>
<p>”I agree with Master, maybe next time you should see if Mor Ardain has different Hunts,” she said. </p>
<p>Rex nodded and sat down on the beach and gave up a deep sigh. KOS-MOS followed his lead and wondered what her Master was thinking. She knew that he had started growing bored recently because of the peaceful nature of the Hunts, and to be honest, she was beginning to feel it too.</p>
<p>Rex looked at the sky that showed the Aurora Lights this night and laid down on the sand with a thump. This time around, he had become one of the most famous Drivers of Alrest, the Realm he wanted to save. Hadrian had landed in the body of a five-year-old boy that was on his deathbed. He had more or less taken over the body and modified the memories around him that knew him on some level. Rex could feel it. The boy was involved in the War that was about to come to this world. But he wondered how this boy would fit into it. Considering how young this body was, and the fact that the little boy hadn’t survived past the age of five. </p>
<p>This body would be eighteen soon, an adult, but he wondered, really if his presence in this body had modified how it grew, because even though he would be an adult soon, Rex didn't look older than fifteen, and he only had the length of 170 cm, but he was still so slender, and almost had a looking female body, almost like his first one. Many, throughout the years, had mistaken him for a female. So he decided to embrace it. He had never tried to dress like one. Even though he could change his gender at will now, he still preferred his male form.</p>
<p>No one here in this Realm knew of his secret, not even Gramps. He didn’t want to burden him with that kind of mystery. The only one that knew of it was KOS-MOS, but that was because they had resonated with him. But that was a given fact. The Blade of the Driver could see the heart of their Driver. Given the nature of how Blades resonates with Drivers, he was not surprised that KOS-MOS had resonated with him. She could be ruthless when she abandoned her human emotions, just like him. He hadn’t only become Alrest's most reliable Driver, though. He had also become a famous Salvager. After he found out what the Cloud Sea was all about, he wanted to explore as much as possible.</p>
<p>So during the protection of the night, he was Alrest Strongest Driver, named Raziel, and during the day, he was Rex, the famous Salvager, that Salvage on Clouds no one dares to go. Pulling up hauls, no one had laid eyes on since centuries back. He liked his current life and wondered if the original soul of this body would have become both, just like he did. But there was nothing to it. So he rose from the sand and brushed it off. KOS-MOS followed him.</p>
<p>Both of them stood on equal length, but he had some high-heels on, so she was taller than him anyway. He wondered if he would grow more, considering that Rex stopped growing after he had turned fifteen. He still grumbled a bit about it. It was hard to be intimidating when he was this short.</p>
<p>While he grumbled about his height, KOS-MOS was scanning the area to see if any she needed to kill any more Monsters. She glanced at her Driver and gave him a small smile. A smile that he missed. After a decade together, he hadn’t changed much, except in the body. But then again, he still had some growing to do, considering he acted mature when he felt like it. But Rex had always been mature towards those he didn’t know, considering who he was, she couldn’t fault him for it. She looked over him and though that he was a pretty young man in human standards. His semi-long hair that reached his shoulders and his bangs that framed his very much feminine face, it was clear as day that he had inherited his looks from his mother. His eyes were the ones that made him stand out and catch people's attention. One Goldeneye and another Crystal Blue, those eyes were framed with thick lashes, making him look even more feminine. She had heard how many people mistook him for a woman, not understanding why such beauty as ’her’ would want to be called Rex, and not knowing he was a male. </p>
<p>KOS-MOS looked him over to see if he had gotten any injuries but nodded in relief that he was okay. He was wearing something that didn’t help his image of looking like the male he was. But she thought he looked good enough, but then again, he was her Driver, and she couldn’t care any less how he dressed because she still liked him. She agreed with the people. He made a good female. Especially in the outfit, he was currently wearing. It was completely black and very eye-catching.</p>
<p>The top was pure black, and it was a Crop-Top with a Halter Neck. Outside of that, he had a fishnet top on too, down to his hips. On top of that, he had a cape, a cape that had a lining of fur that was pure white around the neck area. The cape went down to the middle of his shins. It was also black and decorated with a silver lining on the bottom. He also wore some shorts, also black. They went down to the middle of his thighs and left only a bit of his legs visible, considering he was wearing knee-high boots.</p>
<p>All in all, she could understand why people thought him as a female.</p>
<p>”We should report our success in removing the threat,” she said, and Rex nodded and pulled his hood up once more to hide his face. KOS-MOS couldn’t help but admire how he looked. His frame was very impressed with all the shadows, almost swallowing him. The Scythe he had on his back made him look like Death. It also intimidated a lot of people when they laid eyes on him.</p>
<p>They both started running through the woods, avoiding the casual path that was there, and towards the next island over, where the people that hired them would be waiting. In just a few minutes, they reached the camp where they were. Rex somewhat cheated and had the Earth Element to help him out together with the Wind Element to reach them faster. They were soldiers that worked for Mor Ardain. But they paid him, and he never turned down those that wanted his help. Even though they were soldiers, he rather not be involved in the War between Uraya and Mor Ardain. He would help individuals, but he would not participate in their War with each other.</p>
<p>He had heard how many though he was double-crossing both sides. But he had clearly stated that he would help them out as individuals, but not in their current War. He would not pick a side; after all, he had lost both his parents in this world to that War. So when they had recruited him as Raziel, the lone and strongest Driver, he declined, and they never bothered him again. He had noticed they wanted to force him to participate, but he also had seen that they didn’t dare to go up against him if he ever rebelled.</p>
<p>They both came to a halt when they reached the place where they were waiting. Rex stepped out of the shadows that had more or less swallowed him to protect him on his command. KOS-MOS right behind him. Making all of them jump. None of them were prepared to see them. Considering it was not often that Rex showed himself. It was always KOS-MOS that did the talking. So all of them made big eyes when they saw him standing there beside her.</p>
<p>”The job is done. Master wishes to know if you will need more of his assistance?” KOS-MOS said with a monotone voice, like always when she talked to strangers. Everyone knew of him, but the fact that his frame was very feminine like, they never really knew his true gender. Many thought he said he was a male to protect himself. But he never talked, so they couldn’t even decide through that. </p>
<p>”Raziel! We didn’t see you there! So the Aspid is removed?” they asked, and he just nodded.</p>
<p>”That was much faster than we expected,” another one said with a surprised voice. </p>
<p>”Master says it was ridiculously easy to remove the threat,” she answered, and they laughed, a bit nervous over that kind of answer.</p>
<p>”Of course, for someone like you, Raziel, it would be easy, but to us, it is a tough beast to slay. We tried to remove it before asking of your assistance, but as you saw, we failed,” a man said. He looked like a leader. Rex just nodded and backed into the shadows once more and let them swallow him. KOS-MOS stayed to receive the reward. After she accepted the reward, he manipulated the shadows so that they would sallow her too before the soldiers could stall them any further.</p>
<p>Both of them walked through the shadows and returned to the beach they had left and waited. They waited on Azurda, or Gramps as Rex liked to call him. Azurda showed up a few minutes later. He landed in the Clouds and swam closer to the beach. Rex turned to KOS-MOS with a smile. </p>
<p>”Would you liked to rest some?” he asked, and she nodded.</p>
<p>”Yes, please. After a month of just Hunting and doing missions, I feel like a well-needed rest is needed,” Rex smiled and picked up his small Cube from his bag that decorated his leg. He let the Cube touch KOS-MOS Core Crystal, and both of them glowed, and a moment later, she disappeared in a light. The Cube in question is a Storage Cube. A nifty item for those that travel around and collecting stuff. Or just people that have to much at their disposal to carry around. Not many could afford one, but it was worth the money. Considering it was the lasses technology of Mor Ardain. 1,000,000 Gold. He had bought on very early after realizing he needed one because he was a Salvager. Money had never been an issue for him since he started making a living out of Salvaging.</p>
<p>”Hello Rex, you had a good Hunt?” Azurda asked, and he smiled and nodded</p>
<p>”Yeah, but I think I will be taking a break, these missions gets easier and easier. I think I’ll stick to Salvagining for the time being,” he said with a sigh and jumped up upon Azurda and laid down. </p>
<p>“You do as you like Rex. I hope that you won't be running into trouble,” he said and started swimming away from the Leftheria Archipelago. Rex laughed at him. </p>
<p>“Trouble finds me, you know that!” he laughed and closed his eyes, and enjoyed the night.</p>
<p>“Where do you want to go?” he asked, and Rex sighed.</p>
<p>“Take us to Argentum Trade Guild, I'm going to spend some time there,” he said with a yawn. Azurda nodded and rose from the Clouds with a mighty beat with his wings, and they took off. The trip spent in silence and Rex was looking at the World Tree. It was getting closer.</p>
<p>Just a few hours later, they arrived at the Argentum Trade Guild.</p>
<p>Rex jumped off Azurda, where he had landed together with the other boats.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the ride Gramps!” he called out. He landed on the dock gracefully. During the ride, he had changed his clothes to his Salvaging Suit, not to raise any suspicion. He walked inside and started to ascent to the second floor, towards the Inn. Azruda just shook his head in amusement and fell in slumber, waiting for Rex to return.</p>
<p>Rex walked up the stairs and saw that it was almost empty because it was so late. He walked towards the Inn. He knew that it was this time of the year that many would be coming to Argentum. The Trading Season would be starting soon, so he decided to stay at the Inn for a while. A few days of doing nothing would be lovely for a change, considering that he had been running around Hunting and doing Missions for over a month now.</p>
<p>He walked towards the small Nopon, Utoto, and smiled at her.</p>
<p>“Rex! Welcome back to Lemour Inn! Are you staying long?” she asked, and Rex nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>“Can I reserve a room for the next two weeks?” he asked with a smile, and she nodded and started writing in the little notebook she always had behind there.</p>
<p>“That be 700 Gold,” she said, and Rex gave her the money. He knew how shrewd all Nopons were with Gold. But considering Chairman Bana of the Argentum Trade Guild is a Nopon, everyone knew that. The Nopon did not become a good trade man just sitting there, or well, Rex thought he was sitting there because he had never seen Bana leave his chair.</p>
<p>He plucked the key from the desk and started walking towards his room. 205. He knew that room. He, more often than enough, always got that room. He thought it was because he was so popular, but he couldn't care less about that. The place in question was the most significant room at the Inn, and it had a big King Size bed in the middle together with a sofa, coffee table, a desk, and a wardrobe. On the other side of the room was a big bathroom, and it had a huge shower and a bathtub that he liked to laze about in. It was a beautiful room, and he never complained about it.</p>
<p>He was dead tired and undressed and threw his Salvaging Suit on the sofa and plucked out a big back T-Shirt that was a lot bigger than himself. It covered him down to half of his thigh. But it was very comfortable to sleep in. So he never bothered about getting something else. He never even bothered to brush his teeth, he could do that later. As soon as his head hit the big soft pillow, he was out like a light.</p>
<p align="center">—⚔️—</p>
<p>When Rex woke up, he glared a bit. He's still tired and waved his hand, the time floated in front of his eyes, and he groaned. It was already midday. He sighed and burrowed down under the covered and pillows. He wanted to sleep some more, but couldn't. He had things to do. So he dragged himself up from the comfortable bed and towards the big bathroom. He pulled off his T-Shirt and threw it on the floor and stepped inside the big shower. It was nice. He hadn't had a bath in a few days, so he needed one. He let the warm water fall on him, and he started washing. It was a mirror on the wall on the side of the shower, and he looked at himself. He needed to do something about his hair. It was a mess. He poured some shampoo in his hair and started to wash it. It now reaches him down to his shoulder-blades. It was still very thick and refused to lay even on his head, and he sighed. He would never get away from the curse his father had given him; it looked like.</p>
<p>When he finished, he stepped out of the shower and dried himself with a wave of his hand and waved his hand once more. This time he had his clothes on. A big hoodie that was black and reached him to his thigh. The hood itself had some fake fur in it and was very soft. A pair of very well-worn shorts that also reach him to the middle of his thighs. The pockets were visible, and he shrugged. A couple of High-heel boots went to the middle of his shins, and they had Crystals and some chains on them. His bag on his thigh was once more there, and he patted it.</p>
<p>He turned towards the mirror on the wall over the sink and sigh. He snapped his fingers, and his hair was dry and now put up in a messy bun on the back of his head. The bangs were framing his face, and some strands of hair were hanging loose. He shrugged and just messed up his bangs and walked out of the bathroom. He snapped his finger, and all his stuff returned to his bag. While he knew no one would dare to go inside this room when they knew he was the one renting it, he still didn't want to leave anything lying around. So now everything was back inside his bag on his thigh.</p>
<p>He walked outside of his room and locked it, and started making his way downstairs. He was craving something sweet. Not that he needed to eat, but he was carving something. So he walked downstairs to the bottom floor. He ignored the looks that followed him when he stepped out of the Inn. He knew he had looked from the male population following him. Those that were standard visitors of the Guild shook their head in amusement when their friends took another look at him, already knowing he was a boy. But one thing they all could silently agree on was that Rex with his big heart and dual colored eyes could turn a man gay.</p>
<p>He walked towards the Honeycomb Sweets that was owned by the Nopon named Bonbon. Rex giggled. These Nopon names got weirder and weirder, according to him.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Rex! Always pleasure to sell Rex sweety-sweety confections!!” Bonbon said, and Rex nodded.</p>
<p>“Thanks, could I get 5 Fruity Rice Balls and 1 Narcipear Jelly?” he said with a smile, and Bonbon nodded and plucked it down from the shelf.</p>
<p>“That be 2,160 Gold in total,” she said, and Rex handed her the Gold and took it, and walked back upstairs. He giggled and sat down at one of the empty tables. It had been a long time since he indulges himself in something sweet. So he started eating it.</p>
<p>He picked up a book from his bag, Tome of Morytha #2. He started reading it and eating at the same time, and the Rice Balls were delicious. He moaned in pleasure and licked his lips. He could feel some of the looks he got, but he ignored it. If they wanted to lust after him, they could, but he wouldn't look at any of them. He still hasn't found the right one yet.</p>
<p>When he's finished eating, he put his book back and walked downstairs again. It was time for a needed Trade that he had been putting off. He groaned. It would take some time to get through all the stuff he needed to trade.</p>
<p>Rex walked up to Melolo and smiled. </p>
<p>“Rex! You are back! Have Rex found something for Melolo?” she asked, and Rex nodded and pulled up his Storage Cube and tapped it. A screen materialized itself in front of him. A display-only he could see, which he was grateful for. He didn't need everyone to see what he had inside there. Melolo pulled up her Storage Cube, and they synchronized them together so that it would be easier to trade the items instead of pulling the items up one by one.</p>
<p>Rex groaned once more when he saw that he had a load of things. It would take a while. He thumped his head on the desk with a whine. Melolo wondered what had happened. </p>
<p>“Is Rex not having enough items?” she asked with a worried voice, but he shook his head. He knew that she was just concerned about not getting anything from him, but he could care less.</p>
<p>“Yes, I do have a lot of stuff I need to trade, but with everything I see here, it will take a while...” he whined. He started looking through all his items and started from top to bottom. </p>
<p>He looked at the item and used the screen. He could decide how many of each item he wanted to trade, so he counted. While the screen did the maths for him, he still wanted to keep some of the items in his bag, so he pushed the screen to save a few of it.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s start with this then...” he mumbled, pressed the item he wanted to trade.</p>
<p>“Fancy Rumble Spring, let see here, I want to trade 900 of those,” he said with a smile, and Melolo nodded and pressed on her screen to accept the Trade.</p>
<p>“Melolo give Rex 270,000 Gold in a total of each Set,” she said, and Rex nodded and accepted and sweat-dropped. He needed to Trade more regularly, if he gets such amount of Gold of the Set that was worth the least amount of Gold.</p>
<p>“Hm, now the Mystery Cross... let's see here. I want to trade 900 of those too,” he said and pressed on his screen, and Melolo nodded and accepted it.</p>
<p>“It will be 360,000 worth Gold for Set,” she said, and he accepted the Gold.</p>
<p>He chewed a bit on his lip and looked through it. He wanted to trade all of it, but he didn't want to be here for long, but in the end, he gave up a sigh. He needed to make more place in his Cube, so the Trading had to be done.</p>
<p>“I want to trade 225 Butterfly Blackring,” he said with a smile, and she nodded and accepted the Trade.</p>
<p>“That be 585,000 Gold,” she said and nodded, and Rex continued to touch his screen.</p>
<p>“Hm… another 225 for the Photon Lens,” he said and pushed the Trade. </p>
<p>“That be another 585,000 Gold,” </p>
<p>“The Butterfly Board, another 225 of those,” </p>
<p>“That be another 585,000 Gold,” </p>
<p>“Hm… Good View Set, 225 of those too,” </p>
<p>“Another 585,000 Gold,” </p>
<p>“Hm… the Fighter's Style, I want to trade 450 of those,” he said and smiled at her, and Melolo gave him big eyes.</p>
<p>“That much! All that be 10,890,000 Gold!” she said and accepted the Trade, and he laughed.</p>
<p>“How about 900 of the Precious Quartz,” he said, and she nodded in eagerness.</p>
<p>“That be worth 11,520,000 Gold!” she said, and Rex just laughed at her.</p>
<p>“Now then, 180 of the Flame Flower,” he said, and she nodded with a big smile.</p>
<p>“That be worth 234,000 Gold,” </p>
<p>“150 of the Mysterious Circles,”</p>
<p>“That be worth 990,000 Gold,”</p>
<p>“150 of the Butterfly Coil Board,” </p>
<p>“That be another 990,000 Gold. </p>
<p>“Luminous Art Set 150 of those too,” </p>
<p>“Another 990,000 Gold,” </p>
<p>“180 of the Unknown Parts,” </p>
<p>“That be 5,472,000 Gold,” </p>
<p>“Another 180 of the Ancient Training Set,” </p>
<p>“Another 5,472,000 Gold,” </p>
<p>“180 of the Zigzag Quartz,” </p>
<p>“Another 5,472,000 Gold,” </p>
<p>“180 of the Cinq Set,” he said with a smile, and she nodded.</p>
<p>“That be worth 28,836,000 Gold!” she said, and they finished the Trade.</p>
<p>“Now, let’s see, Rex traded Sets for 73,836,000 Gold! That is a lot!” she exclaimed in happiness. </p>
<p>“Ah, well, last month, I forgot to Trade, so I have been hoarding stuff lately, and I needed some space in my Storage Cube. But the money will have to go home to the Village. After all, they will need the money more than me,” he said with a big smile, and she nodded.</p>
<p>“Then Rex should speak to Max again,” she said, and he nodded. She was right, while he didn't want to do that. He would always be sending a small amount through Max, but he knew that if there were a significant sum of Gold, only half of it would reach the Village.</p>
<p>He turned around and faced with a crowd of people. Some he recognized and others not. He tilted his head in wonder. He never understood why others were so interested in him and his Trading. It was a man named Garram that helped dock the Titanships to the Guild dock that came forward and put his arm around him. Rex laughed when he saw some glares turned towards Garram.</p>
<p>“Good going Rex, impressive like always,” he said with a laugh, and Rex just giggled and hugged him and tilted his head in wonder. Pretending not to see the jealous looks Garram got when he did that.</p>
<p>“What is?” he asked with his head titled and looked at him with big wondering eyes. But he just laughed and waved him off. </p>
<p>“Nothing Rex, but if you are Trading, are you are staying?” he asked, and Rex nodded with a smile and put an arm around his waist.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I've been running around for over a month now, I need some rest now,” he said with a sigh, and Garram nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>“Yeah, just tell me if you need help with anything, yeah?” he said, and Rex nodded with a smile and hugged him once more and let go.</p>
<p>He started to make his way up the stairs again and continued to the Flight Deck; he loved sitting there to relax and watch over the Cloud Sea. It was very calming.</p>
<p>He was sitting there just taking it easy and wondering how his future would look like. Soon this body would be turning 18. He had decided to let the body age until he felt like the right age to stop. He felt like 25 would be a sweet age to prevent aging. He was still waiting on the War he could feel brewing. The Shadows were whispering how a mighty foe was moving. He closed his eyes and listened to them. Shadows provided him memories of Alrest, the War of the Aegis had been raging in the past, how the foe was looking for the Aegis that sank three mighty Titans into the Cloud Sea. But he could feel a Darkness, a Darkness that had taken over many parts of the world of Alrest. He growled a bit. The man that was behind bringing the two Aegis into this world needed to punish. They did not belong to this world. He had messed with power beyond him and thus making him stuck in stasis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Fate did not like when he interfered, while he was the strongest being out there, because no one could avoid Death, Fate could make life a living hell. So he waited until he felt Fate left this world, and he could take over. He could feel that Fate was fading, and many stopped believing in it, thus making it disappear from this world. So he would be taking over Alrest. He would be restoring Alrest to its former glory. He just needed to wait.</p>
<p>He sighed and laid down on his back and watched the sky with his legs dangling over the edge of the usual place where people could Salvage from. The Cloud Sea was just right under him, and he could jump if he wanted to.</p>
<p>But he closed his eyes and just laid there, enjoying the beautiful weather.</p>
