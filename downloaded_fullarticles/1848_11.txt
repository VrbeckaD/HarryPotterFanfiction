    <p>Pansy scoffs as her eyes land on the walking bush that was once Hermione Granger. Her hair has always been a complete disaster, but the humidity from her cauldron has turned it into a right horror show. Laughing softly to herself Pansy stirs her own potion, watching it bubble as her thoughts drift. </p><p>She’d be the first to admit that teasing the swotty mudblood had been her favorite past time for years, but something seems to have changed over the summer. The frumpy little bookworm has grown into herself. Her legs are long and slender, her hips dip deliciously, and her breasts while not exceedingly large, fit her petite frame beautifully. Lips a perfect pink are pursed as she scrutinizes her potion, her cheeks flushed a sinful red while her brown eyes narrow at the instructions in her book. It’s clear even from two tables away that the girl is flustered, and it somehow makes her even more delectable. </p><p>This attraction isn’t novel to Pansy in the slightest. She’s known she was attracted to the fairer sex for quite a while now. Everyone knew of she and Draco’s relationship during fifth year, but it had only taken one fumbling attempt at sex for both of them to confirm their  homosexuality. Naturally they couldn’t exactly publicise the revelation, and so decided to stay with each other for appearances. It afforded them both a safeguard while they explored the wonders of the same sex. </p><p>Draco had made it clear that he had no intentions to strike up the deal again this year, which suited Pansy just fine if she was honest. Although it was the perfect cover, fawning over him had begun to nauseate her. </p><p>Lowering the heat on her own cauldron as it starts to bubble Pansy steals another glance at the other girl. To say she’s well rewarded would be an understatement. Granger’s oblivious to Pansy’s gaze, she bends to grab another quill from her bag. Her overly long skirts from the past have been traded in for a slightly shorter version that just barely teases at what Pansy is sure is a tight little arse. Biting her lip on a soft groan Pansy commits the view to memory, wishing for all the world she could push the skirt up just an inch higher and confirm her suspicions. </p><p>“Pans, close your mouth you’re starting to drool.” Her best friend Daphne Greengrass says softly, snapping her out of her daze. Daphne had been the second person to learn about Pansy’s sexuality, and she was extremely relieved that nothing about their friendship had changed. Some of her first dabbling had been late at night in their dorm room, but Daphne decided early on it wasn’t her thing. </p><p>“I don’t know what you mean Daph.” Pansy slides a blank expression onto her face, as only a true Slytherin can, when she responds. Daphne shoots her a look that clearly conveys she’s not fooled. She’s always been able to see right through her bullshit. </p><p>“Yeah, and Crabbe and Goyle got O’s on their O.W.L.S.” Pansy chuckles at her friend and shakes her head in reply. </p><p>“Alright class lets see how your potions turned out, shall we?” Slughorn says jovially to the class. Taking her potion off the heat Pansy allows her eyes to flit over the nervously shifting bookworm once again. The movement is endearing in an odd way, and Pansy thinks she’s made a truly stupid decision in that moment. Mudblood or not the girl was undoubtedly fit, and Pansy was dying to see what was underneath that perfectly fitted oxford and pleated skirt. </p><p>“What have we got here Miss Granger.” The portly man leans over the cooling potion before him smiling widely. “Ahh lovely as usual. Full marks.” A wide smile breaks out across her face, tension falling out of her shoulders at the teacher’s praise. It takes everything in Pansy to keep for laughing at the little swot. If she had any chance of getting under Granger’s skirt, she’d have to curb her love of teasing her. At least until she could tease her in the dirtiest ways. </p><p>Slughorn moves to her table, but Pansy offers nothing more than a slight smile as she watches the little lioness pack up her table. Her potion is more than passible, and right now she has far bigger things to worry about than a simple calming draught. With a flick of Slughorn’s wand the potion disappears and Pansy moves to collect her own things. </p><p>As much as she would love to take Granger head on, she’s a Slytherin and that’s simply not how things are done. Cunning and ambition are two of their defining traits and the bookish mudblood was about to discover why. It was going to take some serious scheming to get her just where Pansy wanted her, but then again the things you had to work hardest for always seemed to be the sweetest. Smirking at her own joke Pansy hefts her bag onto her shoulder and waits for Daphne to follow. The first step was confirming Granger’s interest in women, and she had just the way to test it. </p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>“You what!” Daphne’s voice rises as few octaves as she shoots Pansy a disbelieving look. The two girls are sitting legs crossed on Pansy’s bed with the curtains drawn. Affixing an exasperated expression on her face Pansy straightens her legs out over the green silk sheets before responding.</p><p>“I need you to put on those lace boy shorts you love so much, hike up your skirt, and bend over in full view of Granger. Honestly Daph, it’s not rocket science.” Daphne’s blush deepens further into the roots of her blonde hair as she stares at her best friend. </p><p>“And why in Salazar’s name would I do that.” Arms crossed over her chest she locks eyes with Pansy, one eyebrow raised in challenge. Brown eyes narrow in response as Pansy lowers her voice an octave.</p><p>“Three reasons. One, I am your best friend and best friends help their best friend. Especially if it could potentially get them laid. Two, I covered both you and Theo’s arses when you decided to go for a quick shag in the hedge maze this summer.” The other girls eyes are wide as saucers filling Pansy with a quiet glee. She does so love winning. “Three you have a much nicer arse than I have, and any girl that’s even the tiniest bit bent would sneak a peek. I have many glorious attributes, unfortunately I can’t show as much tit as I’d need to, to get an accurate read.” The last comment has the blonde giggling softly. </p><p>“Fine. But you owe me.” Pushing her onyx hair over her shoulder Pansy shoots her a smirk in reply. </p><p>“You’re a Goddess among women Daph.” The other girl shakes her head but smiles wider.</p><p>“Why do you even care if Granger’s a minge muncher anyway. She’s a mudblood.” Pansy scoffs at her friend’s statement. </p><p>“Trust me Daph blood status has nothing to do with how good of a fuck a girl is. Granger’s fiery and entirely too wound up. Perhaps a lesson in proper stress relief is precisely what the swot needs.” </p><p>“And you think she’s gonna let you be the one to give her this lesson huh?” Blue eyes stare in disbelief at her as Daphne lays back onto the bed, blonde hair spread out in a golden waterfall. </p><p>“Only a Slytherin could hope to persuade such an uptight Gryffindor into such a task. Plus I better Granger has a praise kink, and I rather like the sound of Professor Parkinson, don’t you?” A feline smirk spreads across Pansy’s face as she finishes, throwing the other girl into a fit of giggles. </p><p>“Oh , this is going to be too much fun.” </p><p>“No Daph. It’s going to be bloody brilliant.” Both girls share a knowing smirk before Daphne climbs into her own bed. </p><p>“Night Pans.” Daphne’s muffled voice calls from Pansy’s right. </p><p>“Night Daph.” Muttering a Nox before setting her wand under her pillow Pansy tries to clear her mind of everything, but what tomorrow will bring. It isn’t long before she drifts off, a sly smirk firmly in place.</p>
