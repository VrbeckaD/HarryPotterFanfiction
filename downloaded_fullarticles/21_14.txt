    <p>
  <span>He hadn’t meant to end up in this situation, but the men in his life had a way of not caring about his initial intentions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But really? How could he resist? What was it that caused him to hunger so much that he always fell victim? He moaned when the slide of the large veined cock sank deep into the back of his throat until tears began to shine in his eyes. He stared up at the beautiful swimmer’s body of his Alpha wereleopard Micah, whose thighs were clasped on either side of his head. Chartreuse eyes were watching narrowed as hips moved back and forth as deep as Micah could in Harry’s wide open mouth. Micah had one hand braced against the wall, the other clenched in Harry’s hair to hold his head steady. His own body burned with a hungering need, his legs were splayed and bent on the large California King sized bed. He was open with anticipation, wanting more than just a cock going down his throat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His tongue lapped and caressed with every glide, and the moan that escaped his lover spun his own desires until they dropped from his stomach into his swollen cock turning it almost red. Was it any wonder that he would be missed, and someone would come looking for him? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know the meat you should be eating is downstairs. I didn’t buy the good grill for it not to be used and appreciated.” Edward called from his lean against the door jam. The sight that greeted him in the room almost caused him to ignore the grilling waiting below for the grilling happening in front of him.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry tried to tilt his head with the ‘meat’ in his mouth, and rolled his glassy eyes at the pun as a second lover swayed into the room, ice blue eyes roving over him as the door closed again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bad pun… but how could I resist?” Micah grunted as he pulled back a couple of inches, allowing Harry to take in a deep breath before he shoved back in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward’s slightly calloused palm ran the length of Harry’s smooth leg and up his thigh with a squeeze. “You’re weak,” he teased.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And you’re not?” Micah reached tugging Edward closer by his shirt to palm his erection through denim jeans that always sat in a lazy fashion against his hips. Micah grinned as Edward humped into his hand. “We have been waiting for you to find us.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does the Little Raven have to say to this?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He needs to not talk, just suck.” Edward placed a hand on Micah’s firm ass and pushed, causing Harry to groan when Micah went in deeper than normal, bringing tears to his eyes. “Vicious bastard…” Micah gasped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In retaliation, Harry worked his throat muscles, squeezing Micah’s cock as his tongue slipped out underneath causing Micah to groan as he pulled at Harry’s hair only to pull out and cum all over Harry’s face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward’s eyes blazed icily as Harry kept his eyes open. “Bastards!” he growled with a cough, his throat was raw, and he was so hot now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Always at your best on your back, Little Raven.” Edward ran his fingers through the coating as Micah shimmied slowly down Harry’s body and gathered his cock to tease. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or on his knees,” Micah purred as he reached for Edward’s belt with his free hand to unzip him. It was then that Harry raised his arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It all started with these.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span> “Ah…” Edward grinned viciously as he ran his finger along the coal black fur wrapped around a slim pale wrist. “The cuffs.” Harry was surprised when the man’s finger looped into a platinum ring that had been hidden beyond the fur. “Not bad. You took my suggestion, Alpha.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How could I not? The idea of him strung up six ways to Sunday,” said Micah springing Edward’s cock free. “But, now he has a bit of all of us, and it won’t go unnoticed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rolled his top half onto his side, and Edward took him by the hair and guided him to his cock. Harry swallowed with a moan of pleasure. Micah was slowly stroking Harry’s cock that kept pulsing against the skin, as if it was trying to grow larger. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Every time he sucks, he gets harder,” Micah commented, running his mouth lazily along Harry’s head. “I think he could come just sucking us; but that’s less fun for me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry moaned some more as he teased and bobbed on Edward’s cock, and enjoyed the sounds of the deep breaths. Harry ran his hands up beneath Edward’s shirt to caress the rising and falling of Edward’s perfectly firm chest until it was thrown off completely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Looks good covered,” Edward hissed, rubbing a spot of cum into Harry’s cheek, and then throwing him back so that he laid flat on the bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Micah released him so that Harry could move his legs eagerly over the man’s head to lace wantonly around Edward’s strong hips. “Fuck me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s demanding,” Edward noted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I blame you.” Micah licked Harry’s cheek of the drying cum as Edward pulled him closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only one finger had gone into him with a light tease earlier, and so it was no wonder that he cried out when Edward pushed himself in; making small white and black spots appear in front of his eyes. Harry couldn’t stop the squeal as he writhed against the dick that drilled deep. A lace of pain teased at the pleasure coiling along his nerves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I am to blame.” He arced over Harry taking him by the slim waist and slamming into him, he enjoyed the twist of pain mixed with pleasure that swirled in emerald eyes that rounded and grew heavy enough to slowly fall closed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry reached for Micah’s cock that was hardening again, and squeezed him back to life as a tongue dived with a sucking swirl passed his lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward moved harder with more vigor, rocking the bed as Micah replaced his mouth with his cock to fill him up once more. “If you keep getting him hard, we’re never going downstairs,” he snarled with a groan as Harry writhed his hips to keep him going.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like you really care,” Micah grinned. “You have all you need to eat right here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward grabbed Harry’s head and shoved him once more onto Micah’s cock, making him take all the inches he could. “Love that he doesn’t gag anymore.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you…” Micah groaned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I think I’ve loosened him well and good for your fat cock.” He backed out of Harry with a squelch, and he took him by the waist, and flipped him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry released Micah, and screamed when Edward’s hand cracked down hard on his arse. “Bastard!” Harry whined as his hair was gripped, and Edward slipped properly onto the bed, kneeling before Harry. Micah took him by the hips. His arse was dripping lubrication, dribbles of semen coming out and down his leg. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of fucking him right away, Micah knelt down and swirled his tongue inside. Harry’s eyes rolled as he took Edward’s balls in his mouth and began to suck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His sociopath’s groans were so fun to force out, and made his blood boil, and he shivered as Micah adjusted himself and then rocked Harry onto his cock. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ride me,” Micah ordered, spreading his plump cheeks and Harry began to bounce and rock aggressively. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rode Micah’s cock from behind as Edward filled his mouth again. Harry’s cum began to shoot out across the sheets and pillows of the bed. He shook, and lost his balance rocking forward into Edward and reaching up to grip the man’s hips to steady himself as he gorged himself. Micah took over as he clenched his muscles in reflex, and got a string of curses from the Alpha pumping into him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward came second, pulling out and watching as his cock poured out on Harry’s face and into his hair. Micah picked up the pace, Harry’s screams filled the room as Edward lowered until they were eye level and nose to nose. Ice blue eyes pierced him as fingers took him by the throat and choked him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward didn’t smile or smirk, and simply watched every line in Harry’s face until Micah lost himself, falling with his weight on top of Harry, his nose buried into the sweaty cum soaked neck, and he licked the salt with a moaning finish. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perfect, Little Raven.” He smacked Harry’s cheek like a good boy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about me?” Micah teased. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward raised his head. “Do I need to validate you too? The things I do for my investments,” he taunted. “Good Alpha, keep that dick up and you’ll do well.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry groaned out a shaky laugh, and bowed his head toward the pillow and Edward’s knee. Micah huffed. “You are one fucking crazy man.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a good ol’ boy, at least for today.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone needs to wash my face.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, Little Raven, it’s already as washed as you’re going to get,” Edward drawled sadistically. Harry pouted up at him. “You know that won’t work,” he said tapping his cherry red lips with a single finger. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward ignored his plea and instead kissed him roughly. “Perhaps I will offer something. I’m in a mood.” He slipped off the bed as Micah finally pulled out and tilted to the side on the bed with a plop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward returned with a rag just as a soft knock low to the ground sounded at the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you done yet?” Teddy shouted through the door causing Harry to groan and turn red as Micah grinned and took the rag from Edward’s outstretched hand. “The food is almost done, you know!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One second, little wolf,” Micah called back, at least giving Harry dignity by wiping his face, hair, and neck free of cum. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward was already pulling his jeans back together, and nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can come in, Teddy Bear,” Harry said, swooping a sheet over his waist. Micah didn’t bother to do the same, just curled up to Harry’s side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy came running, and Edward caught him before he could dive bomb onto the bed. “Smells salty in here,” he giggled as he wrapped his legs around Edward’s hips when he was lifted in the man’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your nose is getting better,” said Edward, tapping it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yup!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is the crowd missing it’s host?” Micah asked, nuzzling Harry’s neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does that mean?” asked Teddy scrunching his nose thoughtfully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is your Parrain being missed?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yep, he is! But, Uncle Draco is having fun with everyone. He smells like Miss Christine. Are they together?” he asked curiously. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not like us,” said Harry knowing all about Draco and Christine, the weretiger, hooking up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean? Is it because she’s a girl?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” said Micah smiling as Edward sat on the edge of the bed. Teddy slipped off him and kissed Harry on the cheek. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was so glad that Micah had washed him, Micah for his part was grinning. Even Edward had a look of amusement on his face. “Whoa, you smell like each other on the face, Parrain!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well you know…” Harry spluttered turning a deep crimson. He couldn’t lie to Teddy and say it was kisses when it most certainly wasn’t. So, he chose not to say anything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, what do you mean?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re friends.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, that smell like each other?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just for fun.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I see.” Teddy nodded in his childish sage way as though he understood, which he probably didn’t, causing Edward to suddenly attack him with tickles to distract him from questions. It made the boy squeal and twist. “Ahhh… Eeh…!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Watch the foot!” Harry squeaked, catching the small appendage. Micah nibbled down on his big toe making Teddy squeal some more as Edward stopped in case Teddy kicked Micah in the face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You biting my toes off?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could, they’re cute enough,” said Micah pinching the baby toe playfully making Teddy grin widely to show that some of his canines seemed to be growing a bit. He’d only just turned seven last month, and they’d thrown a huge party at the Circus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jean-Claude had closed it down for the night, and had hired some amazing acts. Teddy had been lavished that day. Jean-Claude might have gone overboard, but Harry loved the intensity in which Jean-Claude, his third and final lover, took to Teddy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hell, all of them were taken by Teddy, including those who weren’t his lover. Teddy had a way about him that drew others to him. He was so proud of his little boy. He dragged Teddy closer by the ankle, and pulled him in for a hug. Teddy giggled and nuzzled into his neck. “Smell so much…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does it bother you?” asked Edward, tugging at the bright green hair that he was sporting that day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I love it!” said Teddy, raising his head and looking at Edward with big eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” he asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy hummed and tilted his head as he looked back at Harry. “I…” He averted his gaze as though he were embarrassed or shy. His cheeks went red. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell us,” Edward requested. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, please, I want to hear what you have to say,” said Micah, wrapping an arm around Harry and Teddy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It makes me happy inside,” Teddy said as he pursed his lips thoughtfully. “Like, uhm, a hug I think? I don’t know what I mean. I can’t get the words out sometimes. But I like the way you all smell like each other.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a comfort?” Micah translated. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes!” Teddy exclaimed curling further into Harry who rubbed his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is it a comfort?” asked Edward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cause Parrain is happy,” said Teddy burying himself further into Harry. “He doesn’t smell sad anymore.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry froze at this, and Edward and Micah blinked. “I smelled sad?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t remember being sad…” Harry was surprised by this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy pulled back and shook his head. “No, maybe that isn’t right or is it? Uhm, like you were empty like. You smelled like nothing.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wished he could understand, and looked at Micah for translation only for the man to shrug at him. Edward on the other hand was looking at Harry critically as if he knew something they did not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did I say something?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, but - I’m starting to get decent at Edwardnese.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe that wasn’t the right thing to say because Edward only looked at him. “We should get back to the party. You too, little cub.” He then hauled Teddy off Harry. “Hurry down, my gift will not go to waste.” He snatched his shirt on his way out leaving Harry thoughtful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I said something wrong.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. You said something right,” said Micah biting down gently on Harry’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure about that? Sometimes, I can’t tell with Edward,” Harry sighed. He was tired, and he wanted to sleep, but he knew he had to rejoin the party at some point. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Complicated man,” Micah remarked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Understatement.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Harry brought his arm up. “I wonder what Teddy meant? I swear I wasn’t sad.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think that was the right word. I think he meant lonely,” said Micah. “But I didn’t think I should say it out loud.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lonely?” Harry thought back to shortly before his three men really came into his life, and before Draco started living with him permanently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His house had been completely and utterly empty. Not a soul moved in sight, and at one point Harry would not only talk to himself, but he’d also answer, which was a sure fire sign of insanity heading straight for him. “I guess… I didn’t really think about it at the time.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took some extra motivation to finally get out of bed, and get dressed. HIs arse was burning with familiarity and his mouth felt like a rubberband. He should probably brush his teeth. Most of the house was filled with shifters, and yes they would smell the sex on him, and that was more than fine. Harry was used to it, but it was unfair to blast anyone with cum soaked breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was careful not to let the cuffs get wet, Micah had rubbed some sweat into them a few times since putting them on him today, and Harry didn’t want the scent to go away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, they were downstairs, the backdoor that was rarely ever used was propped open, and the smell of steak, ribs, and grilled chicken floated through the kitchen. Harry saw the French Onion dip sitting on the counter and swiped it to take outside where four decently long picnic tables sat covered in tablecloths that matched the four houses of Hogwarts. Harry had no idea why he needed monogrammed tablecloths when they were going to get filthy, but Jean-Claude, after reading Hogwarts A History, had become fascinated with the castle and monogrammed the fabric that was too expensive to eat on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luckily for Harry, he was pretty damn good at repelling charms. Many of the Rats, Leopards, and a dabble of wolves were in attendance along with the only weretiger in the city. Since it was still daylight the vampires were tucked away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He headed over to the silver grill that had two separate racks tiered on top of each other, and he turned over the chicken on the top rack with practiced ease. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Micah joined some of Harry’s Pard, and was joking with them. Edward was sitting at one end of a red table with Teddy on his knee who was talking to Christine animatedly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled when a tall shadow fell over him, and soon Rafael was standing there over his shoulder. “Let me guess, magic kept it from burning while you were otherwise engaged?” he teased in his rich cultured voice, and he lifted Harry’s wrist to inspect the cuff, careful as he was not to touch it and contaminate the scent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry laughed, no longer blushing so deeply as he used to. “Pretty much.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everyone can tell exactly who you belong to now. I think some of your Pard are looking at you rather sad.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry leaned around to see a couple of them looking dejected. “Erm…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s natural, you saved them and you are now their leader,” said Rafael with a half smile. “You’ve cared about them from day one when Gabriel never once gave a damn.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So glad that bastard is dead,” said Harry, pulling off a handful of well done steaks that only a few people in the crowd liked. Surprisingly, most of the leopards preferred it medium well to well done. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are not the only one. Marcus sends his regards by the way. He appreciated the invite, but Raina has been giving him trouble.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry couldn’t help but scowl. “She is </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> invited anywhere near my house.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rafael picked up the plate for the soon to be rare and medium rare steaks, and Harry slapped them on as he removed the chicken once they were at perfect temperature. “Probably a wise idea.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve had to put my foot down, Zane over there was trying to force Nathaniel into one of those damn films,” he hissed with a shake of his head. Zane was one of the more animalistic wereleopards having suffered greatly under Gabriel for not being pretty enough for his sadistic games. He had forced Zane into his form so often that his leopard fangs remained even while in human form. He had dark eyes and dark hair. Christine had whispered to him that his hair used to be a beautiful red, brighter than Nathaniel’s auburn. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is a tasteless embarrassment for sure.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It wouldn’t bother me if I knew it was a safe and sane environment. No matter how tasteless </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> think it is. I don’t want to take their freewill away like Gabriel did, but as it stands, that is not safe, and no one deserves to be forced into something they truly don’t want to do.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I heard you’ve put most of them in martial arts?” Rafael smirked. “What is that about?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Out of their leopard forms, they can’t defend themselves,” said Harry. “Only Cherry seems to have enough fight in her. I want them to at least stand a chance if they’re attacked, and maybe get some confidence.” He sighed.  “I’m still getting their hands in my trousers every other week!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rafael threw his head back and laughed. “I think maybe that will be a deterrent,” he said pointing to the cuffs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rafael had been one of the first supernaturals that he not only met, but connected with. For months there had been rumors about them dating. Even Teddy had been confused seeing them so close, but really Rafael had become a confidant for Harry’s sanity. A rare thread of normal that was sometimes needed in his life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry pulled the seared steaks off at different intervals, and soon enough everything was finished. The ribs fell off the bone as they had been basted overnight in an air-locked bag. No one missed out on anything as Harry took his place between Micah and Edward. Everyone was talking and having a great time. Harry briefly waved at Dr. Lillian and Louie who were sitting at their table just down a ways with Draco, Christine, and a couple of Pard members. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy had slipped off Edward to sit on Harry’s lap instead to share his plate of food. Harry noticed as he took a bite of his medium rare steak that Hermione seemed to have disappeared. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’s Hermione?” Harry asked Micah. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Micah shook his head. “Richard called upset,” he said with a hint of disapproval that didn’t show on his face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s he doing now?” Harry asked with a roll of his eyes. “It’s been on again, off again since December. What could Hermione possibly do to piss him off so much?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Micah shrugged. “Guy has more screws loose than I’ve seen in a while,” he said lifting one of the ribs with his fingers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they first met, Harry liked Richard Zeeman. He was a good guy. A good natured boy scout who was a middle school teacher, and understandably went out of his way to hide his lycanthropy so that he wasn’t ostracized. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, then the self-righteousness kicked in to a degree that had repulsed Harry, and all at the expense of his pack. It had been noble when he started to try and climb through the ranks to protect the weaker members from Raina and Gabriel’s sadism and horrible idea of pornographic snuff films. But Richard could not do what was necessary to protect him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like kill who he needed to in self-defense. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione had thought to give him another chance after they’d broke up the first time. A breakup that had been because of Harry and the shit Richard had said about Jean-Claude, which had nearly sent Hermione back to the seventeen year old bossy self-righteous brat that she left behind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry liked who Hermione was now; the adult with an adult brain and a better understanding of the world around her. Yet she was still the genius bad arse Muggleborn witch he’d met who could make anyone feel three foot tall if she had half a mind to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even Draco liked her now. Most of the time. Eh, who was Harry kidding? Draco and Hermione had a love-hate relationship like that of brother and sister. Draco had even gone so far as to ask for her help in future surrogacy, and for a Pureblood Prince to do that, it said a lot by how much Draco had grown. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione had been stunned and a bit nervous at the idea, but ultimately, she’d been touched that Draco would blurt out that she was the smartest witch he knew, and he wanted his kid to be smart. Of course, none of that would be happening for years and years to come, but it was food for thought for the future.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco no longer sought the approval of an uptight father who nearly ruined the family name. Yeah, Draco had turned out to be an adult bad arse with a golden heart beneath the fluff and peacockiness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thought they were doing well, and on a good page, but two weeks after they got back together Hermione had come in hissing like an angry cat. She never did tell him why. He figured it was a lover’s tiff, and they reconciled. Hermione could take care of herself, and Harry loved her like a big brother, but he wasn’t about to hover like Ron or the others would do with Ginny. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thought that was dumb, the whole posturing thing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh well, not much I can do about it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t worry?” asked Micah. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hah. If Hermione wanted to, she could lay him out on the floor without breaking a sweat. Now if she asks, that’s different,” said Harry helping Teddy who tried to cut his own steak, and was failing spectacularly. He sat the mangled meat aside for Cocoa later as Edward sliced him a new piece, and proceeded to show him how to cut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon enough most of the food vanished, Harry loved that nothing went to waste. Jason, Stephen, Gregory, and Nathaniel had all come out with trays of desserts causing a few people to groan at the idea of eating even more good food. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nathaniel loved the kitchen almost as much as Harry, and he’d been a huge help when he was around. A few times Harry would have to take out thanks to his busy schedule, and he loved it that at least someone was always here and happy to spend time with Teddy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So glad you guys made and brought the dessert for this,” said Harry looking over at the spare table. “I already have 200 cupcakes to make.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“200?” Christine asked, overhearing. “What for?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For me! My class and the other classes are getting together for a big party,” Teddy chirped happily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So Monday I’ll be driving him to school.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I get to meet all the new teachers for next year,” said Teddy proudly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shoot, I forgot the knife,” said Nathaniel setting the strawberry topped cheesecake down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I got it,” said Harry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not summon it?” asked Stephen curiously. “You do that alot.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry made a noise. “Erm, last time I summoned a knife someone almost got stabbed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone laughed, and Rafael cleared his throat. “Yeah, that someone was me. I suppose I was at fault standing in its chosen path.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So no summoning sharp objects unless I’m alone,” said Harry as Teddy slid off him and he stood. It would also give him a chance to check on Hermione. “Do we have enough plates?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We could use more,” said Gregory. He and Stephen were twins, and would be just as identical as Fred and George had been if Harry didn’t have a feel for who was who. Both were beautiful blue eyed blondes. One was a leopard and the other a werewolf. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Stephen was admittedly his favorite as he’d known Stephen longer, but Gregory had quickly warmed up to him, and with being part of Harry’s pard after the whole Gabriel incident, Gregory thought he hung the moon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to be so fat after this,” Cherry groaned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go for a run then,” said Nathaniel logically. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why? I have classes Tuesday. I’ll just wait and work it off then.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“By then it will have already settled,” said Jason. “Harry has a gym in the basement you know.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry headed into the kitchen, and rummaged through for two good knives, and a stack of paper plates because he was not doing anymore dishes than he had to. Even with the help of magic he was already going to be overwhelmed, and he still had two hundred cupcakes to make. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yeah, Harry’s life wasn’t full at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione?” he called pushing against the swinging door. He had to go up a flight of steps before he heard her thanks to the sound muffling spells Harry had used on the walls. It wasn’t full proof as Harry didn’t like a completely silent house, but with shifters and a little seven year old with acute hearing privacy would be hard to come by otherwise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He found Hermione sitting at the end of the couch with her legs crossed and watching their two mice play in their colorful wheel. Harry pretended not to notice that the chubbier one had part of his tail missing. Last week it had gotten out, and Cocoa, their resident cobra, had been the first on scene.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Harry. Sorry, I’m not downstairs.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay. I set a plate aside for you. Medium well with a side of chicken right? I’m insulted you won’t eat my ribs,” he plopped down beside his childhood friend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thanks to Jean-Claude, she had finally managed to settle her hair somewhat. Even he had been impressed by her hair’s ability to defy him, but he managed to get each curl to separate. Hermione had never been so thankful and now her brown curls lay gently against her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m wearing white today. I don’t want a mess,” she said smiling weakly. “Even with magic it’s hard when your delicious food falls off the bones right onto my clothes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled gently. “What’s going on?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione sighed. “I adore Richard.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But-?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She let out a noise. “Gah, he’s so insufferable.” She threw her hands up and balled them into fists. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m listening.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head. “I thought everything was great, but then he calls me in a tiff, upset because we didn’t invite his Lupa this afternoon, and he was even angrier when we invited his Ulfric!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed, and rolled his eyes. “Sorry about that. It’s my fault then.” He leaned forward forearms against his knees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s not. You have every right to invite who you want!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s the big deal if I invite Marcus? Should the leader not at least be invited? I don’t mind him, now Raina on the other hand, I don’t want her anywhere near my house. She’s still trying to get my leopards into her movies even though Marcus put his foot down about it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione made a face. “I don’t know this woman, but I already don’t like her. I made that clear, and he told me that you’re poisoning me like he did with Jean-Claude.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry barked in laughter. “Poisoning? I don’t need to poison you when she’s made of poison, Hermione. Ask every last person downstairs who has ever met the woman. She makes Bellatrix Lestrange seem like Molly Weasley, homemaker!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione shuddered the moment he said it. “Both are horrible!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exactly, and wasn’t Raina the whole reason why he was rising in the pack? To stop her movies?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s come to the conclusion that they’re not so bad so long as everyone is agreeable.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No one is agreeable, that’s the problem. It’s like what happens when a teacher and student start screwing each other. Too much power on one side in play.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I made that example, and he got even more offended. I guess because he’s a teacher, and thought I was horrible for even thinking it. I called him an arse and hung up. Now I’m just trying to calm down.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you need to come down and have the French silk pie that Stephen made just for you,” said Harry with a pat to the leg. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He does make good pies. Almost rivals yours,” she teased. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Watch your mouth!” Harry scoffed with a huff. “I’ll have you know I am the master of cooking.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, yes we know!” She laughed and rubbed his back. “Come on, that pie does sound good.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“First, your main dinner or I’ll tell your mother you skipped right to pudding that wasn’t sugar free.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mean.” Harry stood and held out his hand to her, and helped her up. “Thanks, Harry. I feel so much better now.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any time! Everyone has tiffs. I should know, I have three complicated men.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione snickered. “I don’t know how you do it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ask me again when I’m in one of your moods.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And your bum isn’t so sore, right?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That too…” Hermione still turned a bright red at the mentions of sex, but she no longer shied away. Just like him, she was becoming a bit more immune. She still thought it was odd, but seeing everyone happy in their own skin went a long way with her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Also, being with a shifter, even if it was a stuffy boy scout, had taught her a lot about her own sexuality. Christine had become one of her few good female friends, and Harry was glad. She needed more than men around her at times. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry and Hermione rejoined the party outside, the crisp May wind rushed over them causing a few plates and napkins to go flying. Harry waved his hand, and they floated back down in their places. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy was now sitting between Louie and Dr. Lillian with his legs swinging and a great big slice of cake on his plate. As if the boy needed more sugar with the rush. At least someone will help him work it off before the end of the night.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry resumed his place in the space left for him between Edward and Micah as Stephen proudly gave Hermione a huge piece of pie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward had been in conversation with Rafael over something, once again the starts and pauses made it difficult for Harry to follow it. Micah was offering one of the Pard members a couple of tips on the driving lessons he was taking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Four of Harry’s members had passed their driving tests, and he couldn’t have been happier. Independence, even a small dose for even the most submissive was always needed to keep them healthy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Honestly, Harry had no idea what he was doing, and often looked to Micah for guidance. But, he must have done something right because everyone was laughing and smiling for the most part. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once everyone was satisfied, and moving around, Harry started preparations for cleaning up. He sometimes used magic, but he preferred the muggle way. For some reason it gave him a sense of balance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was almost six o’ clock, the skies were starting to gray, but the weather was too nice for anyone to want to pack up back into the house. Teddy was being chased around by Draco, Christine, and Rafael with lots of squeals coming from the little one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nathaniel insisted on helping him, but Harry shook his head. “No, that’s okay. I’m going to use magic on the dishes at least. I need everything clean before I break into cupcake baking,” he sighed. “How did I get roped into this?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Being too nice has its consequences,” teased Nathaniel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh huh.” He didn’t flinch when two of the leopards that passed by rubbed up against him. It was a natural thing they did, but it seemed that the cuffs on Harry’s wrists detoured them from slipping their hands in places they shouldn’t be. Even Nathaniel sometimes couldn’t help but rub against Harry, usually at his shoulder with his nose. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry disappeared with everything into the kitchen. A lot of things were following him magically like puppies so that he didn’t have to constantly backtrack. Most of the people were more than used to Harry’s magic by now. A few still watched with a wonder in their eyes worthy of a child on Christmas morning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was surprised to see Edward sitting at the table cleaning one of his guns with a cup of fresh coffee in front of him. His foot was propped on the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had thought the man was outside. Probably had enough of the noise and crowds. Edward wasn’t one for crowds if he could help it. He tolerated them when he had to, but then there were times when he would disappear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Steaks up to your standards?” Harry asked, taking his half full cup and refilling it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not bad, Little Raven, even with your detour,” Edward drawled. “Teddy playing?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know it. He’s energy in a bottle after that chocolate cake. I’m thinking of trying matcha cupcakes, but do you think that’s too advanced for kidlets?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the hell is matcha?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Green tea.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t,” said Edward smirking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed. “It’s good though, and somewhat healthy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kids don’t want healthy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“True, but I bet you’d like them. It’s subtle in flavor. Nowhere near as sweet.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe. Why do you like cooking?” asked Edward out of nowhere. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took Harry off guard, but he didn’t miss a beat as he roved around the kitchen. “I don’t know, I guess it’s because it was the one thing I knew how to do when I forced myself to learn to read at three years old. I’d squirrel away my aunts magazines in my cupboard to keep down on the boredom. I’d be in there sometimes for days,” he said, not noticing Edward’s eyes icing over or the pause in gun cleaning. “I learned quickly that seeking their approval was a bad idea, when I showed my aunt that I could read at three, she put me in front of the stove, and that was that.” He used magic on the dishes as he grabbed some cleaning supplies for the grill. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should hate it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t though. I didn’t like cooking for those arses, but it was the one thing I was confident in, you know? In the house, things like books and imagination were forbidden. So there wasn’t much in the way of entertainment until I started primary school. I always figured that if I ever got away from them when I was a kid and I could cook, I could survive.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It didn’t really help too much when we were on the run for the ministry. Mostly because Hermione wouldn’t let me steal what I needed,” he muttered. “She was so annoyingly self-righteous back then. Oi…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where was Remus in all this?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t know who Remus even was until my third year and we saw him on the train. He told me later that he had been forbidden by Professor Dumbledore from coming around. He said he tried once or twice only to be threatened with imprisonment because of his furry issue. I didn’t know any of this until after Dumbledore had died.” Harry shook his head. “Hell, I didn’t even know I had a godfather until that same year, and he broke out of Azkaban. A lot of stuff was kept from me. It’s why I can’t stand the idea of keeping anything from Teddy. Even if it’s too adult or too messy and crosses a line. I want him to know everything. Andy tried to keep Remus’ werewolf status a secret out of shame. But I refused to let that stand.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Knowledge is power,” said Edward, and as Harry passed by with the green bucket of soapy water ready for cleaning, the man snapped his fingers around his wrist and drew him down onto his knee. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s heart spun inside of a warm vortex, and even when Edward let go to reach for the metal piping that went into one of his guns, Harry remained on his knee. He sat the bucket aside, and watched as those carefully experienced fingers worked through each of the disassembled pieces. He settled back against the man’s chest as he continued to watch. He handed Edward a piece that he knew went next. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know about this future school of his.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can transfer him to Ilvermorny, and I think on the weekends Ilvermorny lets the students go home. I’d have to meet the Headmaster or Headmistress before I make any decisions. I like Minerva McGonagall being the Headmistress of Hogwarts. She is a strict no nonsense woman.” He knew no one would be happy about this idea, and McGonagall was likely to send him a howler for not letting Teddy go to Hogwarts, but tough. Teddy was his, and if Andy had a problem with it, then that was tough. “Beauxbatons would be an option if it wasn’t so far away, the Headmistress is a half-giant who puts up with no nonsense.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward snapped the gun back into place and laid it aside before reaching for his favorite 9mm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever I do, I’ll have to go to the school personally. That is going to be a fun reunion,” he said dryly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps we can make a night of it,” Edward said, and Harry nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Definitely going to need backup. But at least you’ll get to see it. It is impressive, I loved it even with all the issues.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It shaped you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry would agree, and he reached for the pipe cleaner, and used his magic to clear it of the dust and dirt before handing it to Edward. “I better get started on cleaning the grill, thank you for that by the way.” He took a chance and kissed the man’s cheek before turning away as if he hadn’t done so, and grabbed the bucket of water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t bother to look back as he stepped out to the laughter around the tables. Most of the adults had broken into the alcohol that Draco had contributed. Teddy was sleepily sitting on Rafael’s knee with his back reclined to the man’s chest, his cute head tilted to the side with his eyes closed.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Micah quietly relieved him of the bucket. “I got it.” He then snapped his fingers for Zane and Gregory, and the two promptly came over to help. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sure? It’s no problem, but I can’t just leave the gunk on there.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You put all this together, don’t you have cupcakes to start on?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed. “Yeah, but I need to clean before I start otherwise it’ll drive me crazy.” In the distance he could hear the ringing of the phone in the house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hoped to goodness that it wasn’t Dolph. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sure clean a lot,” said Zane unconsciously rubbing against Harry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s conditioning more than anything. If you’re sure I’ll leave you to it.” He kissed Micah and patted Zane and Gregory affectionately before heading back to the kitchen and preparing for a cupcake fest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was surprised when he entered to see Edward assembling the rest of his uncleaned guns. His eyes narrowed as he swiftly put it together. He didn’t even seem to notice Harry had come back through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Something wrong?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward’s head snapped up to look at him. “I have to go. Something’s come up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay. I’ll let Teddy know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry didn’t see Edward’s eyes traveling over him as he turned his back and pulled out a large amount of cake flour. He also collected the vanilla bean, butter, baking powder, chocolate chips, and finally the fresh strawberries that Jean-Claude had gotten for him from Florida. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was thankful for the double oven that Rafael had replaced, but then again he had replaced it for Harry because two of his young wererats tried to thank Harry by cooking for him only to make his stove explode in an impressive Draco-like display. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is Micah going to be with you?” Edward asked in a seemingly calmer tone than his frantic moving motions as he snapped all his guns together. He looked to be in a hurry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably not. I think tonight is where he meets with his pard on the border of St. Louis. They’re not too happy smelling new wereleopards on him, some are thinking he’s abandoning them.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cats with abandonment issues. Where are you going to be tomorrow?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Teddy’s school to drop off the cupcakes,” he said, pulling out the cupcake tins until he had five sat out on the table. “I’ll be with Jean tonight about one o’ clock. Apparently, someone has reached out to him asking for my expertise. He won’t tell me what it is though as usual,” he huffed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was unusual for Edward to truly frown. He wasn’t one for smiling either, he often sported a blank look unless he was using an identity, and so the fact that he was, got the wheels of confusion spinning in Harry’s head. “You better be armed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will always be armed, my dear Death,” Harry teased.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward’s lip twitched. “Good.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned to get out of the fresh eggs, and the copious cartons of cream which he always preferred over milk. He scanned the items sitting on the table before summoning a bunch of bowls. “Why did I think this was a good idea again?” Harry groused for the second time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did you think it was a good idea to make three different kinds when you could have stuck to one? Rugrats don’t really care so long as it’s sugar.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry huffed at this. “There will be enough natural sugars in it without adding so much more on top of it, but really not everyone likes vanilla or chocolate, and strawberry is always a great alternative. Besides, all the other parents copped out, citing they were too busy. I was a bit affronted being the last one asked. I guess because I’m a man, but Teddy just so happened to advertise me as the world’s best cook, which I appreciate, but now here I am. I have to live up to it. Teddy’s reputation is at stake after all.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward snorted. It was then Micah came through with Teddy draped over his front. He was mumbling sleepily with his legs wrapped around the beautiful wereleopard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exhausted?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Completely,” said Micah. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not sleepy…” Teddy murmured into Micah’s shoulder and tried to raise his bobbing head, and looked around. Harry laughed and ran his hand up and down Teddy’s back. “I still live!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Micah chuckled, and Harry grinned as he kissed the boy’s ear. “Of course you do. Say good-bye to Edward.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ooh!” Teddy wiggled down with an energy he hadn’t had a moment ago and rushed into Edward’s knee. “Bye Edward!” he cooed with his arms wrapping around the man’s thighs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward hoisted him up. “I think I have enough time to tuck you in, what do you say?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy squeezed the man around the neck, and Harry’s heart melted watching the two. “Please! Parrain has a lot of work to do. I’m sorry,” he said smiling with all the innocence of the kid that he was.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not sorry,” Harry said, shaking his head. “But, that’s alright.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No because they’re going to be yummy and I’m going to be poplar.” Micah and Harry laughed at his mispronunciation of popular. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll try not to disappoint.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go up and brush your teeth, I’ll be behind you,” said Edward, placing him back down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yep! I will! Come on, Micah!” He called as though Micah were slow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes sir,” Micah flashed his teeth as he chased after the child. “Next time Cherry complains about eating too much, I’m going to have her run after him.” He rushed out, and scooped up Teddy causing the boy to squeal from the hall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like a light switch,” Harry teased. “Sorry if you’re in a rush.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward shrugged pocketing the last gun in a hidden pocket of his usual bootcut jean style. Harry had been surprised when his sociopathic lover had accepted Jean-Claude’s gift of new clothes with various pockets hidden for weaponry, then again if it gave Edward more chance to hide his firepower then the man was not above accepting something. Of course, they were all made of a much finer material that could only be purchased in France, and Harry might have added some resistant spells, but they looked good on him. His same style, but better accommodations, what more could a cold blooded assassin ask for?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Five minutes won’t hurt. I have been bouncing through the Bounty Hunter grapevine, there are some rumors I’ve been checking into since March. I don’t like them, and I got a hit on one of them just now, and so I’m meeting a contact about it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why was Edward explaining himself? He never explained himself. He came and went as he always did, and rarely did he say good-bye. Harry had become used to it, knowing that no matter what happened, Edward was an untamable phantom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’ll be here making cupcakes, what do you think, sprinkles or no?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Every kid loves sprinkles,” Edward said, darting his eyes over the ingredients.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s true, and I still have those homemade ones leftover from Teddy’s birthday cake.” He pulled them out of the cupboard and shook them before sitting them down on the counter, and preparing the racks in the oven before flipping the knobs to their set temperature. “Maybe in late August before school starts we can all take a trip to Britain. I’d like to do it all in one go. I need to set Teddy as the Black and Potter Heir, and I want to give you power of attorney.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know. Just in case. I never want him to end up in my situation. I think about that a little too much for my liking.” He stood nonchalantly, and turned only to flinch when Edward was standing right there staring down at him. “Is that okay? It would kill me to see him forced with someone who would only use him because of his link to me, and Merlin they would,” he said drawing a slow breath when Edward looped an arm around him to pull him closer, and when he kissed Harry the effect of the man’s lips flowed down into his toes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t the usual rough and hard kiss, but it wasn’t soft either, but all the same it had an intensity that drew Harry into him. If Jean-Claude was like the wind with his blanketing aura, and Micah as grounded as the earth, then Edward was the flame that burned so hot that it could turn cold in an instant. And what was Harry? Jean-Claude would liken him to an electric metal rod that slowly sucked and spilled out liquid electricity in all directions; attaching each bolt to the elements. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had started with Micah and Jean-Claude, and a potential Triumvirate before Edward was sucked in, transforming it into a disbelieving Tetrumvirate that no one understood. Everyone was in the dark as though the electricity had blacked them all out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that was okay. Harry could see in the dark, and he liked the eyes that penetrated him, blues and greens of different types from ice, midnight, grass, and sometimes neon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or maybe it was all his imagination and the oven that was turned on behind him was wafting out onto his back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can’t leave Teddy thinking you are sad now can I?” Edward said, his soft pliable lips pressed smoothly onto Harry’s mouth as he sucked at the lower lip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, there was always a reason for Edward doing anything sweet or soft. A good ol’ boy sociopath down to his toes, and no matter what he could or could not feel for anyone, Harry still loved him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But damn if he could ever say it verbally, not like he could with Micah or Jean-Claude. He’d already messed up once tonight. He didn’t want to do it again. “Better not. Your mask might slip.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward’s smirks never really reached his eyes, but it was still there and still gorgeous. He wasn’t exactly imposing like Jean-Claude or the other men, but his stance and everything he did had a point. He did nothing without a reason, and Merlin help you if you discover that reason. He might slit your throat in the dark. But, Harry had become an investment, and he could accept that. He’d been telling himself this since all of it started during that hot sticky July. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward smacked Harry’s cheek lightly before turning his back and walking out of the kitchen. Harry never took his eyes away until the kitchen door swung shut leaving the room in almost frigid and empty. Nevermind that the house was always full. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death at it’s finest. </span>
</p>
