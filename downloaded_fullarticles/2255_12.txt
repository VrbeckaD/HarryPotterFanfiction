          <div class="userstuff"><p class="p1">Albus appeared in the Hogsmeade station. His heart was racing, his cheeks were hot and red. He couldn't believe what've just happened.</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He tried to breathe, he set his hair with his tremble fingers and tried to adjust his coat, acting like nothing had happened. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>Percival Graves</em> was out of his mind, of course he was. He was handsome, no doubt. Charming, gentle and… <em>Married,</em> with two children.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was not a reason to be surprised for Dumbledore, in his entire life he had met so many homosexual men hiding their real nature behind marriage, it was not a news. But Percival has never given him the impression to be one of them, after several years of friendship. Besides, he’s never showed Albus his sexual desire, touching and kissing him as if he didn’t want anything but this.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus touched his lips, still shocking.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Those kisses, those strokes… There was a reason why Albus couldn’t stop him. The way Graves kissed him, touched him and looked at him made Albus remember another man, his unforgettable first love<em>.</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It seemed like Gellert was there.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <b>One week ago.</b> </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Excuse me, mr. Graves, Albus Dumbledore has just arrived. He wishes to talk with you-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Grindelwald suddenly stopped writing the order of the day, a black spot of ink stained the document. The dark wizard, hidden behind the Percival Graves’s appearance, a famous Auror of New York, looked at the MACUSA secretary, stiff.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-He’s in the waiting room- she added, unaware -May I tell him to come in?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No- he answered immediately -Tell the Professor I’m busy and I cannot receive him-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-But Mr. Graves, Professor Dumbledore…-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I said no, Wendy!- Gellert interrupted her, upset.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Yes, Sir- she obeyed, weirded out by his unmotivated rudeness.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">As soon as the secretary came out of the office, Grindelwald/Graves stood up and rushed to the door. He opened it a little with extreme attention and looked from the gap: he saw Wendy coming towards a tall, slim man, turned on his back. He was looking at an horrible paint, and Gellert smiled: only Albus could find that picture interesting. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The dark wizard gazed eagerly at him from head to toe, holding tight the doorjamb. He saw him smiling kindly to Wendy,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>frowning to her seriously while she was telling him he couldn’t be received, and then he saw him nodding and smiling in a sympathetic, nice way.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus was always kind, always nice and smiling, but under his smiles were hidden so many scars, so many pain. He could trick everyone, but not his former love.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>“Do you miss me, Liebling?”</em> Grindelwald thought, looking at him <em>“I miss you too”</em></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus Dumbledore has always been a nice man, polite and kind. No one but him could make other people feel welcome and comfortable, no matter if they’re student or powerful wizard.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But the fact that his suspects were always correct, forced him to live in a perpetual state of disillusion, which made him to reason in every moment of the day, including night.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">In fact, he found suspicious that his friend Percival Graves had accused Newt Scamander and refused to received him in his office. There was clearly something wrong with him, because Albus was absolutely sure about Newt Scamander’s innocence. It wasn’t him or his creatures who had attacked and killed the young senator Shaw the day of the conference, in front of his father’s eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus was so convinced of Newt’s innocence, that he came back to the MACUSA central department, thanks to the headmaster Dippet’s permission.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Certainly, Hogwarts’s students were happy to skip<em> at least </em>Transfiguration. Albus smiled thinking about McLaggen and the other students running free in the schoolyard…</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But, suddenly, he saw something that made him gloomy: there was a newspaper on the small table, with a moving photo…</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus looked at it, unsure. He usually avoided journal like the plague, because he knew perfectly who was the main character of their articles and photos, and he didn’t want to see <em>him, </em>not even in a photo.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But that time he made an exception. Driven by tedium and curiosity, Albus took the paper but, obviously, the pain came. On the front page there was Grindelwald, photographed during one of his rally with a beautiful, young woman. And then article’s title: <em>“Who is Vinda Rosier?”.</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The professor bent quickly the paper and put it on the table as if it burnt.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Congratulations, Gellert” he thought, sadly “She’s stunning”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Professor Dumbledore?- Wendy the secretary called him -Mr. Graves is ready to receive you-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus tried to smile, as always.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Thank you, I’m coming- he replied, without knowing the truth.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Grindelwald was spying on him. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He stared at Albus’s masculine body, at his reddish and straight hair, hidden under his hat, at his beautiful, shining blue eyes… If it’s possible, the Professor was more attractive now than before, when he was just an eighteen years old’s fellow.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But the most interesting thing was his reaction in front of that photo. Obviously, it was Gellert who had put<em> that paper</em> with <em>that photo</em> right there, in order to see how he would have reacted in front of it. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And his response made the dark wizard smile. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But as soon as he saw the Graves’s secretary came to Albus, Gellert/Graves run away from the door, back to Graves’s desk. He felt nervous, stiff and excited, as if he was going to fight a duel instead of having a friendly meeting. And besides, to see and to trick Albus Dumbledore was the most difficult ordeal he’s ever faced. Finally the doorknob turned round, Gellert took a deep breath, clenched his fists, got ready to meet him.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Albus Dumbledore in the Big Apple!- he welcomed Albus, pretending to be Graves -It’s an honor to have you here!-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Percival, my dear friend- exclaimed Albus, cordially -It’s been ages! How are you?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I’m fine- he answered, trying not to tense up for his hug -Except for the constant bad news-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus’s hug was unmistakable, manly and comforting as Grindelwald remembered.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I know, but you’re a rock, Percival- he encouraged the fake Graves -I’ve heard that you rule the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. My congratulations, Madam Picquery has made a great choice, calling you-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">…And Albus seemed to him so tall, so strong and masculine… Or maybe it was Graves to be shorter, <em>maybe</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-It was an honor, a demonstration of confidence in me- replied Gellert/Graves, forcing a smile.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-It was, particularly in these dangerous times- said Dumbledore, more serious.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-But tell me about you. How’re you?- asked the dark wizard, in order to take time.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I’m alright, I supposed- he minimized, smiling nice as always -My students are restless and they keep me awake, but in spite of it, everything’s okay-</span>
</p><p class="p1"> <span class="s1">-They’ve raging hormones…- Gellert suggested, friendly -Just like me-</span></p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus chuckled, amused -I know what you feel, I eat candies to forget!-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The fake Auror stared at him with a naughty grin of complicity… He couldn’t help it. Albus frowned a little, perplexed.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-<em>So</em>, would you like something to drink?- asked Gellert, trying to be Graves again.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No… No, thanks. I’m here for talking about Newt Scamander, the man you’ve accused for murdering the Senator Shaw- said Dumbledore, seriously -I know what had happened to the poor Shaw, his death was a terrible tragedy. Anyway I strongly believe that Mr. Scamander and his beasts are not involved in this crime. And I’m so convinced that I come here from London in order to tell you personally-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-What makes you so sure?- asked Gellert/Graves, disappointed. As always, his former boyfriend love being the hero of the weakest.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-My suppositions are always correct, Percival- Albus joked -I know very well Newton and I can assure you he’s a good boy. He wouldn’t hurt a fly, the same goes for the beasts he greeds-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Maybe you’ve forgotten the Obscurus found in his suitcase-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-But in his suitcase, Percival, not around New York-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-So? Who is the guilty of all these crimes, in your opinion?- Gellert/Graves asked him -<em>Grindelwald, perhaps?-</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">In front of this name, Albus lowered his eyes and got stiff. Small, eloquent reactions that made Gellert smile.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I don’t know- the professor whispered, uncomfortable -But not Scamander-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-You know, Albus, people said you’re the only one able to stop that dangerous rebel- exclaimed Gellert/Graves, referring to himself -People said that nobody, except you, have got the power to fight and defeat him. What do you think about it?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I don’t think about it- answered Dumbledore, tiredly -Can we talk about Newt, please?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Grindelwald is more important than Newt- said the illusionist, harshly -You can’t delay anymore, you’ve to choose what do you want to…-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No, I don’t!- Dumbledore interrupted him, annoyed -I’m not an Auror! I don’t have to choose anything!-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-But…-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No buts!- spoke Dumbledore, with a loud, angry voice.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>“We’re really twitchy today, aren’t we, Liebling?”</em> Gellert thought, amused. Albus’s shoulders were stiff, he noticed, remembering the times when he could rub his whole body… His fingers started to tingle and a inopportune craving inflamed his hips.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Alright, Professor, I do not insist anymore- Gellert exclaimed, trying not to smile.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I beg your pardon- Albus said, tired and uptight -You’re not the first one who ask me about… About fighting him. It makes me feel uneasy- </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Why?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Because I can’t move against Grindelwald- Albus revealed the truth, sadly. He couldn’t imagine what a great news he gave to him -Don’t ask me why-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">To keep acting was very hard for Gellert. He had to pretend to be upset, worried, when all he felt inside was only joy and triumph. But Gellert was a perfect deceiver, in fact he kept acting the Graves’s part without arousing suspects.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Don’t be sorry, I can imagine what you feel- he said so gently that Albus looked at him, impressed -It must be hard to live with this burden. You must feel oppressed, charged with the responsibility of satisfying the people’s expectations. But the truth is, we all use you and your talent because it suits us, because we want to dump all the danger and the responsibilities on you. But you don’t have to be tricked. The wand is yours and the right to choose belongs only to you-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-But I’ve already chosen what to do, Percival. I cannot move against Grindelwald- Albus repeated with low voice, with his heart broken.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-So, don’t do it! Don’t move against him!- Gellert/Graves exclaimed fervently, touching his sad face -It’s your choice! Don’t let people decide for you, only you know what is right, only you know who deserves to be heard, who deserves your love and who really loves you, Albus-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Gellert caressed gently his face, his short beard. The urge to kiss his lips was unbearable.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Thank you, Percival- Albus said, blushing a little under his caressing fingers -Thank you a lot-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-To choose a good ally is the first step towards victory, but it’s also the most difficult thing to do- Grindelwald/Graves added, with soothing voice -Too often we consider friend who actually isn’t. Please, think about it-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus nodded, trying to get away from him and from his hypnotic flow. There was something weird about Percival Graves, something attractive and familiar, <em>too familiar…</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Now I’ve to leave- said Albus, agitated, stepping away from him.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-But you’ve just arrived…-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Hogwarts is waiting for me. It’s time to go- he insisted, putting on his hat. But Gellert took it off with magic and put the flying fedora on his own head.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-How do I look?- he blinked, spiteful.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus smiled, patiently -Certainly better than me-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Impossibile- Gellert/Graves answered, kindly -I’m not that handsome-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-What? I don’t understand if you’re kind or if you’re joking me-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Neither of them. You look good- said Gellert/Graves, in order to make clear his feeling -I really like you-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus stare at him coming closer, wordless. Percival was charming, but what made him really irresistible was the incredible, unteachable resemblance to Grindelwald. He actually looked like the powerful dark wizard. Not physically, Gellert was blonde and pale <em>(and far more handsome, in Albus opinion)</em>, even less mentally: Percival was an Auror, Gellert has always hated Aurors… In spite of that, Percival reminded him of Gellert, and with the astonishment, Dumbledore felt like kissing him. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>“What’s wrong with me? It’s Percival, don’t be fool!” </em>the professor said to himself, anxious.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Gellert/Graves took off elegantly the hat and put it on Albus, then he smoothed the folds of his coat and fixed his collar.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Here. You look perfect-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Thank you- Albus murmured, ashamed and charmed at the same time. Gellert smiled to him.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-You’re welcome, my dear-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Thank you again…-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>“Come on, Al, kiss me”</em> Gellert exclaimed to himself, impatient, while they were looking intensely to each others <em>“Don’t you see I’m at your foots!?”</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>-</em>I… I count on you for Newt- Albus answered, too shyly for being himself.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Of course. Have a good trip, my precious friend, I’ll write to you- said the fake Auror, without smiling.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Thank you. Goodbye-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Bye- answered Gellert/Graves, caressing him with his gaze. After Albus left, Grindelwald took a deep breathe. He turned around to the window, shocked by incoherent feeling. He felt proud for being able to cover his true identity, but at the same time he felt a great sensation of bitterness and regret.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wanted to stop acting, he really wanted to talk to him, to make up with him, to convince him that they’re stronger than fate and stronger than society, which was afraid to their powers linked together. Gellert was sure: together, he and Albus could land on the Moon and even more. If only…</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Suddenly, the dark wizard heard someone knocking on the door. He drank another great dose of Polyjuice Potion from his metal flask and prayed not to meet again the Graves’s former wife or another woman the Auror used to sleep with… The poor Grindelwald never had sex with so many women (and so few men) as in that period, but, <em>thanks to the stars</em>, it wasn’t a woman who opened the door and kissed him abruptly.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>Percival</em> moved his hands around the professor’s body, covered by two layers of clothes. He squeezed his biceps, got down to his abdomen, feeling the Albus’s shy tongue in his own lips…</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Gellert kissed him back and that was something freaky and stunning at the same time. Albus opened his eyes, shocked for the said resemblance, Grindelwald instead closed his, happy for having just him, his <em>Liebling.</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Gellert kept kissing him, trying to put him at ease with smart caresses. He remembered where Albus loved to be touched and what made him cry… But it wasn’t so simple.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Dumbledore was shocked. He felt the true, the reality behind the Grindelwald’s mask, but he couldn’t believe at his own instinct. Because “<em>who knows where is Gellert. Who knows who is the lucky one he spends time with, he trusts and he makes love with. Maybe that Vinda Rosier, of course not me”</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He felt so emotionally fragile that he couldn't trust his own mind: it was no possible to see Gellert everywhere, in everyone’s smile and eyes. It was an obsession. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The dark wizard stopped kissing him, with a mischievous grin on his face</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Tell me the truth, professor- he said on his lips -You care so much about Scamander because you fuck him?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Of course I fuck him- Albus joked, repaid his nerve and his grin. But Grindelwald didn’t like his joke at all. He assaulted him, taking violently his hips and thrust him against the desk full of documents, kissing him angrily and touching him between his legs, blinded by jealousy. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Don’t… We need to stop…- Albus cried, feeling his body getting hard -Or I won’t be able to stop myself anymore-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-We don’t have to stop. I want you-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-But you’re on duty and we’re in your office, someone might come in- Albus gasped, trying to keep the control.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No one’ll come in. Enjoy the moment- Grindelwald smiled with lust, feeling his excitement raising under his skilled fingers “<em>My little, aroused boyfriend” </em>he thought.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus blushed, his stomach was tighter than a knot and his hard pelvis was in flames. Everything of Graves were creepy similar to Grindelwald, not to mention his not caring about rules. But he couldn’t be <em>him</em>, thought Dumbledore, it’d be impossible. Nevertheless, so much repressed desire is impossible to control. Albus has never stopped loving him, thinking of him, dreaming about him… He closed his eyes and started to indulge to his own urge, reliving emotions he though they were gone forever. That man and his smell, his flavor, the way he moved his hands and his tongue…</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Oh, Merlin, you look like…-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Like who?- Gellert/Graves murmured, kissing him in the neck in the same way he used to do when they’re eighteen -Like someone very handsome, I hope-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Handsome is not enough for him- cried Albus.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Uh, impressive. I’d like to meet such an Adonis…- Gellert chuckled. At this point, he didn’t care if his former boyfriend figured out his trick, they both simply needed to make love. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No, you don’t, trust me- Albus replied, his fingers between his short and black hair.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Why? Is he only yours?- whispered Gellert/Graves, pleased.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No, not at all, but…-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-But you still love him. Don’t you?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I do- the professor confessed, sadly. Gellert/Graves stopped kissing and touching him. He almost felt reborn.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>-Do you want him to be here?-</em> he asked Albus near his ear, ready to return in his real form <em>-Do you wish I was him?-</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus looked up at him, Gellert’s eyes were shining.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No, I don’t. I don’t wanna see him anymore-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The delusion hit sharply the notorious dark wizard, but he walked away from this.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I see…- he said, upset -But what if he still loves you as well?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-It’s impossible, he never loved me. But don’t worry- Albus said, trying to smile to him -I’m resigned to my life of solitude and now I desperately need to stop thinking, <em>please</em>-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Get it-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Gellert/Graves turned Albus on his back. He bent him gently over the desk, a position of unequivocal submission, and started to stroke his back until his bottom, unzipping his pant.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Is it okay for you?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus nodded without saying a word. His blue eyes were wide open and stared at the door, his chest leaning on the desk. He wondered if Percival knew to do him a favor, staying behind his back. Without seeing the Auror anymore, it was just like making love with his Gell.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Stop me if it hurts- Gellert/Graves whispered, pulling his pant down -Stop me in every moment you want-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus smiled -At this point it would be too cruel-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I prefer to stop myself than imposing you something unpleasant-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-You aren’t imposing me anything. But my heart and my mind aren’t here with you- Dumbledore revealed, direct, for not deceiving him.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-You’re wrong, they’re here- Gellert answered, kindly -I’m here,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>behind you-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus didn’t answer and stayed calm when he felt his lover pointing his wand to his own body, using the same spell his young Gellert used to cast, when they were going to make love. The professor stayed calm, but his eyes were crying. It was <em>him</em>, everything reminded Albus of him.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I love you- he heard him say.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>“I love you too, Gell” </em>he thought, and he closed strongly his eyes when he felt <em>Gellert</em> pushing into his own body, forcing his intimate walls in a painful, sweet, beautiful way. </span>

  <span class="s1">Perhaps it was only his fancy, the vital need to have the love of his life again, because while Gellert was thrusting, in the middle of the pain and the ecstasy, Albus thought to see some locks of blonde hair, swinging over him.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Or maybe it was just his fancy.</span>

  <span class="s1"> <b> <em>Today, Hogwarts.</em> </b> </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>-Good morning, Professor Dumbledore!-</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>-Hi, Professor!-</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>-Professor Dumbledore… Ehm, I’m afraid I shall be late for class today because…<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ehm, I feel sick…-</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>-Prof! Sebastian is got away again! May I seek it in the kitchens?-</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>-Professor, I’m sorry I couldn’t finish the essay you’ve assigned for today because… You know, yesterday there was Quidditch so… I… I tried to…-</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Get it, Mr. McLaggen- Albus answer patiently to the third year student, getting with him to the Great Hall for breakfast -I grant you one more day, but you must write a masterpiece, all right?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Of course! Thank you, professor!- answered the boy, running fast to his friends.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Don’t run!- Albus scolded him, shook his head. He sit in the professors’ table, near Professor Binns, still alive at that time.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Oh, Albus! Here you’re finally!- exclaimed Binns, his voice was very apprehensive.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Good morning- Albus said, noting his concern -Is everything okay?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-You ask us if everything is okay!?- replied the Professor Merrythought -I can't believe, didn’t you hear what happened in New York, yesterday night?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No, I didn’t. What happened!?- Dumbledore asked her, getting more and more worried.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-It’s about Grindelwald- she said and Dumbledore turned pale -He was captured by MACUSA’s Aurors some hours ago-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Albus looked at her appalled, his heart started to pounding fast.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-But there’s something more- she added -The most incredible and frightening fact is that they caught him while he was pretending to be Percival Graves, the principal Auror of New York!-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <em>-What!?- </em> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-I know, it’s very upsetting. Grindelwald has tricked everyone, drinking a sort of Polyjuice Potion reinforced with dark arts- the professor explained, giving Albus the Daily Prophet -Do you realize? Grindelwald has run the Department of Magical Law Enforcement for months, and nobody even noticed! And the poor Graves? Kidnapped and locked up in a prison!-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But Albus stopped listening to her. He was staring at the photo in the journal, the photo of Graves during his slowly transformation to the beautiful, cruel Grindelwald and viceversa. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Albus? Are you okay?- asked him Professor Binns. Professor Merrythought looked at him, worried as well.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Albus, dear, you’re pale. Would you like some water?-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-No… I’m… I’m okay- he answered, confused -I beg your pardon, I’ve to go-</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He got up and almost ran to his office, in order to write a letter to Elphias Doge, his friend… <em>with benefit</em>. Luckily, his response came quickly.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1" align="center"> </p><p class="p2" align="center">
  <strong> <span class="s1"> <em>If we met two months ago in London? But Albus, I was in Sud Africa two months ago… </em> </span> </strong>
</p><p class="p2" align="center">
  <strong> <span class="s1"> <em>Why do you ask? Should I be worried?</em> </span> </strong>
</p><p class="p2" align="center">
  <strong> <span class="s1"> <em>Love,</em> </span> </strong>
</p><p class="p2" align="center">
  <strong> <span class="s1"> <em>Elphias</em> </span> </strong>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Dumbledore froze with the letter in his hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But some seconds later, another owl arrived to his window. To tell the truth, it wasn’t an owl, it was a falcon, one of this birds of prey really popular in America… The bird knocked to the window with its hooked beak, Albus opened it and saw it had the MACUSA’s bib in its chest… He took of the letter from his leg and read quickly the message.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The handwriting was unmistakable:</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <b> <em>I don’t want to move against you too.</em> </b> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <b> <em>P.S.</em> </b> </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> <b> <em>I’m still here, behind you.</em> </b> </span>
