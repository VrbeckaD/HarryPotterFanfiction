<p>Warning- BDSM play, DD\lg play</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                  Wild Side</p>
<p>Malfoy sat surveying the curly head bent over papers sat on the desk opposite his and thought to himself...he was a lucky fucking bastard. The day Hermione Granger had been dropped literally in his lap like manna from heaven he realized he'd never let her go.</p>
<p>Today she would become his fully... no more half measures...</p>
<p>A Year Ago</p>
<p>"The Department will be helping out one of the junior ministers this month, Malfoy" stated Worthly while shuffling the papers on his desk in agitation,</p>
<p>"Where are the sodding papers." He huffed in frustration as Draco and his partner Zabini stood in total silence waiting for the chief to finish his rant before they could receive their assignment.</p>
<p>"Ah here we go." The man adjusted his spectacles before reading out the official looking memo. "The department of International Trade and Policy requires the assistance of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement's elite Aurors for the protection and safeguarding of one of our junior minster's; Hermione Granger in a diplomatic mission in Kiev.</p>
<p>Draco face turned stony while Zabini attempted not to let his mirth show.</p>
<p>"Is this a joke?" he asked, his voice cold. "You know we have a history."</p>
<p>Worthly already looked disinterested, "Look Malfoy, I don't care. I've always been the kind of man to make my own judgements. Nobody wanted you in this department and yet I hired and trained you because I knew you'd be one of the best because you had something to prove. You're both 30 now, you haven't seen her in what...12-13 years...get over it." And with a wave of his chief's hand Draco was unceremoniously dismissed. "Also, she better not have any complaints about you, she's a lovely girl and you better not push her buttons."</p>
<p>"Push her buttons." Malfoy sputtered disbelievingly, "That woman was born to aggravate me, but I push her buttons!?"</p>
<p>"Why me?" he growled marching out of the office with Zabini by his side, "He has Potter."</p>
<p>"He's away on paternity leave." Blaise reminded him</p>
<p>"Weasley then?!"</p>
<p>"His wife's sick remember he's taking some family days. You really need to learn to pay more attention, Malfoy."</p>
<p>"Anyone then! Finkle, Lupin or even Fisher."</p>
<p>"Everyone has cases asshole, plus it won't be terrible. Have you seen Granger lately?" Whistled Zabini, "Those big gullible eyes and sweet little body, no one would suspect all the power locked into that wee thing. She'd had that shit hidden since school but damn if those tits aren't just perfect."</p>
<p>And Blaise just carried on "When Potter and Weasley heard she was going to Keiv they requested that you be the one to go with her. Next to Potter, you have the highest arrest rate and your witnesses never show up dead. Just think of this like a normal job."</p>
<p>Remember Malfoy, Tuetur Tenebris... the vow you took when you joined the Aurors.</p>
<p>Famous last words, mused Malfoy... just think of this like it was a normal job. Expect it wasn't a normal job was it... it was Hermione fucking Granger who had starred in far too many of his dirty fantasies over the years. How many times had he jerked himself off in his shower after watching her do a press briefing in her sexy as sin muggle clothes? How many times had he wondered if that warm caramelly skin blushed like he had so often imagined?</p>
<p>Except it was dangerous to even think that way about her, there was a reason Draco kept his sex life far- far away from his everyday life. He enjoyed certain things that he was sure would make sweet little Hermione turn tail and run. But damn if his hand didn't itch to spank that sweet heart shaped bottom, she really was perfectly made, he mused.</p>
<p>Not that he needed Zabini to point it out. She was a pocket Venus, those curly locks that they used to make fun of in Hogwarts now streamed down her back to her hips in the most enticing fat, sassy curls that made a man want to bury his hands within, warm coffee and cr√®me skin that made him want to lick her all over; he often wondered totally inappropriate things about her, like the colour of her pussy and if sucking on her nipples would get her wet.</p>
<p>Getting her into bed would be impossible, Malfoy doubted that Hermione 'goody two-shoes' Granger would even consider the idea of him wanting to dom her. But he did and not in his normal way which was quite detached even though his subs rarely had anything to complain about. Thrilling as it was for Draco to dominate a woman, now at the age of thirty he was certainly more jaded than before. The scene was fast starting to lose its appeal to him, he had started young; only eighteen enjoying the anonymity of the BDSM world but the anonymity was chafing on him now. His pleasure short lived and his need for more was taking over any appeal the clubs held for him.</p>
<p>Since he had received this assignment, already vivid dreams rich with detail had become almost tangible. These days he woke up with a perpetual hard on and an image of curly brown hair and soft limbs wrapped around him calling him "Daddy"</p>
<p>Draco was surprised, he had never been into domestic kink and Daddy was a new thing for him, he usually had his subs call him Master or Sir but there was something about Hermione Granger that had brought out his new aspect of his personality; he wanted to consume her completely, being her dom wasn't enough.</p>
<p>Fuck! His cock was hard just thinking about her... he'd have to go to the club tonight.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The same night</p>
<p>"You can do this." Hermione said to herself firmly. She was standing in a dark alley way just a few doors down from the club she had talked herself into going. She was 29 damnit and she had lived off fantasies for the past 8 years. It was time to finally see what she was missing out on.</p>
<p>"Hiya!" she said cheerfully to the bouncer guarding the door, like she had done this sooooo many times before. Her confident strut only slowing long enough for the man to give her a once over.</p>
<p>The big man merely grunted and pointed to a small chart that showed different coloured bands and what they meant inside the club. The words were all new but the tingles they brought were familiar.</p>
<p>Pink- Littles</p>
<p>Green-Daddies</p>
<p>Red-Submissive</p>
<p>Yellow- Observers</p>
<p>Black- Dominants</p>
<p>White- First Timers</p>
<p>"C..could I just get one of the yellow ones." She answered hastily, not bothering to register the words lest she lose her nerve.</p>
<p>The bouncer strapped the yellow band onto her slender arm, and she headed inside.</p>
<p>Ginny had dressed her for this outing, because according to the red head Hermione's fashion sense was closer to 'librarian you fantasize about as a teenager' than 'come and take me hot dominant man' those were the words she used verbatim.</p>
<p>She wasn't wrong but Hermione had always been conscious of the way she was built. She was blessed with an abundance of curves that had come back with a vengeance after she joined university and gained a bit of weight.</p>
<p>Now nearly eight years after university she was coming around to love her little belly pooch that her and Ginny had nicknamed her 'Ice cream baby', her bigger breasts and her arse that she still thought was too wide for her relatively short height of 5'2. The extra weight wasn't budging and honestly, she was done fighting it.</p>
<p>Confidence girl, she reminded herself... you're Hermione fucking Granger, not that any of these muggles would know who that is. The club she had chosen was in the super hip part of town, Camden where she was sure she wouldn't run into anyone from work. Not that most wizards ventured out into muggle London a lot anyway so she was relatively safe.</p>
<p>Like the good little girl, she was, she had done her research and picked this place where she unlikely to find anyone who knew her.</p>
<p>Plus, she had been assured that she looked sexy and she felt it, in a beautiful baby pink dress that hugged the curves of her breasts before flaring out empire style. She knew she wouldn't exactly fit in with the whole leather and metal thing a lot of the women had going on, but she was comfortable none the less.</p>
<p>And Hermione philosophized to herself sagely at her age being comfortable was one of the many requirements of dressing up.</p>
<p>"So, you a little huh?" Hermione jerked back at the unexpected voice in her ear and found a young man grinning down at her.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to her while reciting her inner monologue she had wandered over to the bar, the club was well situated with plenty of dark corners and plush velvet sofas, couples both heterosexual and same-sex sat near each other; chatting, necking and in one very flushed lady's case getting touched inappropriately in what was NOT a designated play area.</p>
<p>Oh my... he was beautiful and very-very young. Hermione resisted the urge to wag her finger at him like a disapproving aunty.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry young man, I don't know what you're talking about." She replied politely before heading towards the bar. She needed a drink ASAP.</p>
<p>"First timer huh." He grinned and followed. "Don't worry I can show you the ropes."</p>
<p>To be completely honest he looked harmless, like a tall golden retriever puppy in human form. But such behaviour would not fly and she was looking for something very different.</p>
<p>"Young man this is entirely inappropriate. I believe that the rules of this club state that you have to be approached by the female first." Hermione stated, trying to shake the annoying presence that was keeping up with her.</p>
<p>"Oh..." he pouted, "You just looked lost. Plus, you're not my type anyway." He winked, "He's more my type." He said lasciviously gesturing towards a tall man that towered over a young blonde woman in one of the play areas.</p>
<p>Hermione turned to look at whom he had gestured, and her world condensed into one fateful moment...</p>
<p>Draco...Draco Malfoy... standing in a muggle BDSM club looking like he had been there several times before. He wasn't dressed in any leather or metal but instead wore a crisp black suit that should have made him look out of place but instead only emphasized his beautifully sculptured muscles. Despite him becoming an Auror, Hermione had only had fleeting glimpses of him and nothing in the world had prepared her for the full impact of an adult Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>Clearly, he had grown out of the thin, wiry built that came with being a Seeker and now towered over those who surrounded him, broad bands of muscle curved around his biceps and his massive chest looked very much like somewhere she would love to rest her tired head.</p>
<p>Big hands held the woman he was with close, Hermione felt her nipples tighten against the silky fabric of her dress. When had Draco Malfoy become so...big, thick thighs like tree-trunks anchored him firmly to the ground and held the woman he was with in their embrace and suddenly Hermione was jealous.</p>
<p>"Beautiful isn't he." Sighed the young man who had yet to leave her side.</p>
<p>"Master Draco comes here every week, he's always with girls but I have hope." He laughed.</p>
<p>"I know him..." whispered Hermione, "We went to school together and haven't spoken in years."</p>
<p>"You should go re-introduce yourself." He urged.</p>
<p>"I don't think so." whispered Hermione, "We weren't friends, and nothing ended on a good note."</p>
<p>What an understatement thought Hermione to herself, can't really tell this muggle boy that hot as hell Master Draco was actually Draco Malfoy whose house she was tortured in, who fought against her in the Great War, who believed that her blood made her less than him.</p>
<p>Not that he hadn't made amends, he was an Auror now. Well-liked and respected, in fact Hermione knew he was known as one of the best, taking on dangerous and potentially life-threatening assignments to prove his worth. He was also friends with Harry and Ron now, but she had kept her distance. Which wasn't exactly hard when you worked in a giant governmental structure, she avoided parties like the plague anyway and Harry and Ron knew well that it wasn't easy for her to forgive Malfoy so they didn't mind keeping the two friendships separate.</p>
<p>For her Draco Malfoy was the embodiment of her greatest fear... being disliked or discredited for something that was entire out of her hands and she didn't think despite what everyone assured her of his changed behaviour that he would change his attitude towards her. With her his hatred was personal; it wasn't just about being a Mudblood, it was all of her he hated. It wasn't something she understood, maybe it was just her personality?</p>
<p>Hermione knew very well that that she wasn't the kind of person everyone took to immediately, I mean it had taken the boys half a year and a troll to even consider becoming friends with her and at work she was demanding, exacting and expected no less from her staff and colleagues than she was willing to give herself.</p>
<p>When they were younger the very same aspects of her personality, she was now psycho-analysing had saved her life, she knew that well but she couldn't help wondering sometimes if she was a different person; one who demanded less would she have been married with a bunch of babies already. These thoughts were few and far in between though.</p>
<p>Despite her loneliness she was really quite happy with her life; a successful career, a group of friends that love and adore her and adorable nieces and nephews she could spoil to her hearts content before handing them off to their parents.</p>
<p>When she was younger, she had had a crush on Draco, like every good girl has on every bad boy but she was sure she had grown out of it until now when she felt a visceral pull towards him. Honestly, she didn't want to, even though he had made amends, he had never apologized to her personally she thought bitterly.</p>
<p>Today is about you Hermione she reminded herself, it's about seeing if anyone other than the men in your Kindle can get you hot even though her reading list was pre-dominantly lighter kink. The leather wasn't really her scene.</p>
<p>"What's your name, young man." she said abruptly swinging towards the blond menace that still stood beside her.</p>
<p>"Matty." He grinned.</p>
<p>"You will show me around this place." she demanded, "And no touching, I'm just here to observe."</p>
<p>"Yes Ma'am." He laughed before leading her around. "Have you ever been to a club like this before?"</p>
<p>"Never ever."</p>
<p>"What's your poison, Miss...?" asked the young man leading her to the bar.</p>
<p>"Granger, Hermione Granger." She felt a little silly extending her hand when people were literally having sex behind her. "I'll take a white wine." Her throat was a bit parched.</p>
<p>Seeing Draco Malfoy hadn't exactly been on the list of things she wanted to happen tonight... losing her long held semi-V card didn't look like it was happening today. Hermione wasn't a virgin but she was about as close to one as you can get, having had one painful, bloody experience with a man in university. A humiliating and sad experience that had caused her to retreat further into her land of fantasies and books. After all the men in her romance novels rarely left her sore and crying.</p>
<p>Doubts suddenly assailed her maybe coming here was a mistake. She rubbed her damp palms against the bell of her pink dress nervously. She wasn't a nervous nelly by any means but sex meant a lot to Hermione. She had never really managed to make herself vulnerable enough to a man to enjoy it; one of the major reasons why her and Ron hadn't worked. Thankfully they had broken it off after two kisses, recognizing that romance just wasn't in the cards for them.</p>
<p>She had longed her whole adult life for a man to take control of her in the bedroom in the kind full and consuming way she had read about in the aforementioned Kindle.</p>
<p>"I um..." she swallowed the lump in her throat, "Should probably leave, Matty. It was a pleasure meeting you but I don't think this is the right place for me."</p>
<p>She didn't know what she expected, berating herself silently. This was all a bit much, the leather, the chains... the MAN.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger, Hermione! Wait." Matty was holding her upper arm in a gentle grip. "What is it, you don't seem like the kind of person to walk away so quickly."</p>
<p>"The leather and the chains, it's a bit much for me personally." She laughed while shaking her head. "You're right, I'm certainly not the kind of person to walk away from something I'm interested in but the problem is I don't think I'm interested in this."</p>
<p>"What were you looking for and can I ask what brought you here?" without her awareness Matty had seated her on one of the bar stools.</p>
<p>"Do you really want to be sitting here talking to me? Don't you want to find a partner of your own, Matty?"</p>
<p>"Nah, no one has caught my eye just yet." He held up his bracelet, red for submissive. "Plus, you're cute and you look lost. I want to help!" he said enthusiastically. "So, what brought you here?"</p>
<p>"It's horribly clich√©d, but I just recently turned 29 and I thought I wanted to see what was out there. But this is sort of overwhelming, I don't think I have it in me to hang like that." She giggled pointing towards a beautiful blonde suspended from hooks on the ceiling.</p>
<p>"I'm not very athletic or the most in shape. But I do like the shape I do have, belly pooch included. More of a reader and biscuit eater than a gym goer."</p>
<p>"Okay but what did you really want to see?" he urged, taking a sip from his hot pink drink that the very handsome bartender put down in front of him without even asking.</p>
<p>"What are you, like a kinky shaman?" she asked suspiciously taking a sip of her crisp Pinot Grigio.</p>
<p>"The people that normally come to such places are sooo fucking jaded, honey." He replied dramatically, "You look sweet, like you just read your first Daddy dom erotica and wandered in here."</p>
<p>"You didn't!" Matty gasped accusingly when he saw Hermione's guilty face, "Pegged you for a little, didn't I! I love it when I'm right." He giggled, "So what a few too many glasses of wine and a couple dirty stories on the Kindle and the plan was born."</p>
<p>"Basically..." blushed Hermione. "I've always been incredibly high strung; the colouring books and diapers aspect doesn't appeal to me but the whole domestic kink in bed... the idea that I can just let go and be small..." she whispered.</p>
<p>"Makes you feel safe huh?"</p>
<p>She nodded, "It wasn't easy admitting I liked it because I didn't think I could retain my independence as a grown woman while still having fantasies like that."</p>
<p>"What made you change your mind?"</p>
<p>"I did a lot of reading, looked at a lot of forums online and I was shocked at how many women are not only interested or active in the lifestyle but they need it. And that I was being singularly narrow minded, that there were aspects of the lifestyle I could pick and choose." Hermione said "And so here I am, venturing out of my safe zone for the first time. I just wanted to have a look at the scene for the first time in real life."</p>
<p>"Finding a Daddy won't be hard for you, honey." Matty assured her, "You're well cute."</p>
<p>"Maybe not today though..." she said finishing the last of her wine... I don't want any of these men she thought with a detached sigh. I want that one over there with the blond hair and the silver eyes... the one I'm not supposed to want.</p>
<p>"Matty." Growled a voice from behind her head, causing her to freeze because she knew those artic tones well, having just put them out of her mind a second ago. "I suggest you find another form of entertainment for this evening."</p>
<p>FOR THE SAKE OF MERLIN! It was like a really cringe romance novel Hermione thought, how had he even spotted her. Merlin, literally the worst timing.</p>
<p>She wouldn't turn, she told herself stubbornly, she wouldn't. He sounded a wee bit angry... scratch that she could hear the rage in his voice and honestly, she didn't have the time to deal with this. They hadn't spoken in like ten years he couldn't just barge in on a conversation she was having.</p>
<p>"No! Stay!" she said to the young man who had started to rise from his seat, it was clear from the blush on Matty's face that her worst suspicion was confirmed. She really should have turn tail and run when she had spotted him, she though miserably.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't recommend listening to her, son." Now she couldn't turn. His voice had dropped an octave and damn if that hadn't sent a tingle down her spine straight into her panties.</p>
<p>The blond traitor in front of her gave a little wave before winking and walking off.</p>
<p>Really there was only one way to deal with this, she huffed miserably. Diving in head first.</p>
<p>"Malfoy." She said, mustering her coldest voice.</p>
<p>"Don't you fucking try, Granger." He growled, spinning the bar stool to face him. Forcing her to look up into his eyes... and holy shit... if Hermione Granger had thought Draco Malfoy was attractive before when she had caught a glimpse of him from afar, the impact of him up-close was nuclear.</p>
<p>Clear grey eyes, shaggy blond hair that had stopped being that sort of freaky silvery colour. The evidence of what must have been Viking ancestry was blatant on his adult face. When they were younger Draco Malfoy had been beautiful, it had often struck her funny how someone with such a malicious soul could look like the embodiment of a Christian angel but an adult Draco Malfoy was all man, no beautiful soft edges here. Maybe it was the Auror training, maybe it was the things he witnessed during his imprisonment and the war but Draco Malfoy had grown up looking very much like his Viking ancestors before him.</p>
<p>Beautiful was no longer the word Hermione would use, his sheer magnetism was incredibly commanding... no wonder he made a great Dom, Hermione thought with a semi hysterical giggle. She didn't think men like him existed outside dirty romance novels written on the internet but clearly, she hadn't been looking in the right places.</p>
<p>His square jaw was clenched so tight and his eyes held the promise of retribution but Hermione felt no fear, instead a gush of liquid heat made its way down her spine and into her panties. Merlin, this was such a total spanko fantasy of hers, strong, dominant man whisks her out of a place he deems unworthy of her.</p>
<p>No! Bad Granger! She reprimanded herself, she was just here to explore... oh I don't know ten years' worth of fantasies and Draco Malfoy was everything she had fantasized about for so long. From his wide chest to his heavy legs encased in dragon hide boots but she could fall into this fantasy every easily. It wasn't every day that you found out your totally unsuitable baby crush, colleague (ish) and until recently enemy was into the same things as you.</p>
<p>Well not the same, Hermione was pretty much settled on the fact that she didn't just need a Dom she needed a Daddy and clearly Malfoy was into some of the harder stuff, she didn't even swear! How was she going to allow some man in leather to string her up!</p>
<p>And the complications... god the complications would be the worst. No no this wasn't the man and this wasn't the place, maybe in another lifetime she sighed.</p>
<p>"Granger quit daydreaming and answer my question, what do you think you're doing here?" he growled out. God what a bastard, Hermione thought bitterly he doesn't even have the decency to look bad when he scowls. Draco's dark golden stubble was such a contradiction on his classically handsome face and again she wondered what that rough beard would feel like on the soft skin of ther thighs.</p>
<p>She should probably answer him.</p>
<p>Malfoy</p>
<p>Fuck...fuckity fuck, fucking Granger. Why in the name of Merlin's holy balls was Granger in fucking Poison it wasn't that well known on the BDSM circuit and one of the rare clubs where Draco played without a mask. Today was the worst day of his fucking life, she looked... Merlin, she looked edible that baby pink dress that looked like it was made for her and he fucking bet if he put both of his large hands around her waist, he could span it no problem.</p>
<p>Just fucking pick, her up and take her out of here said the sly voice in his head. She looks like a fairy in a land of leather and metal. This isn't the pace for her. Ignoring the insidious little voice inside his head he struggled to keep his attention on her face.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here." He repeated softly, enunciating every word through gritted teeth. He didn't want random assholes staring at Granger, she was his damnit. Even seeing her with Matty set his teeth on edge and that kid was as gay as one gets without wearing a permanent rainbow cape.</p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy you do not speak to me like that." The curly haired menace in front of him huffed.</p>
<p>"Granger, are you aware of where you are?" he growled, she looked like a damn princess.</p>
<p>His princess, this was the fucking reason why he hadn't bothered to ever approach her, when it came to Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy was hopelessly...infatuated, in love, aroused, possessed, jealous all of the above and so much more. Merlin knew how many fucking times he had wanked off in his shower to pictures of that full pink mouth closing over his cock and those whiskey eyes looking at him like he was the only man who had had the honour of being inside her candy apple pussy.</p>
<p>He had always thought she'd be vanilla as fuck, clearly princess was looking for a meander down the dark side.</p>
<p>Maybe you could give it to her, whispered the sly voice again. Talk about complicated, Draco scoffed silently. If he had her he would never let her go but what if she didn't want that. Draco didn't just like her... he was fucking obsessed with her, had been for years and his fucked-up desires didn't just involve them being together, he wanted every breath, he was endlessly possessive and not to mention his obvious choice of bed play.</p>
<p>You don't know that I like to make good girls cry do you Granger, hold them down, tie 'em and fuck 'em until they have tears running down their pretty little cheeks because Master's cock is just that fucking good and you're the best fucking girl.</p>
<p>"I am fully aware of where I am, Malfoy." She replied coolly, "As a consenting adult I am allowed to be wherever I damn well please."</p>
<p>"Granger this is a dungeon, people come here to get fucked, spanked and strung up in public. It isn't for you." He tried to explain.</p>
<p>"Ooooh the gall! The sheer audacity." She got up off the bar stool and began to poke his chest rapidly. "I am an adult and..." she lowered her voice dramatically, not that anyone was listening or cared, "A very powerful witch who can look after herself."</p>
<p>"And pray tell me Oh Mighty One where in that poofy confection is your wand hidden."</p>
<p>Draco didn't think that with Hermione's caramelly skin she would blush that easy but the bright red flush that spread across her bosom and went up fetchingly to her cheeks was a shock, "None of your business, Malfoy." She mumbled under her breath before shaking his hand off her shoulder. "Now if you're done manhandling me, I think I'll leave."</p>
<p>"You do that, princess." He said sardonically "And go straight home."</p>
<p>"What could you even do if I didn't." she said challengingly, "You're not my keeper." And she walked towards the door.</p>
<p>Yet... he thought ominously</p>
<p>God even the view from behind was glorious, her body was beautiful... Rubenesque. He wanted to dig his fingers into her soft hips as he drove the both of them to distraction. He had visions of them in his flat, his hand wrapped around her gloriously curly hair while her wet lips formed that enticing 'O' she tended to do when surprised and her eyes glazed over with pleasure.</p>
<p>"Fuck" he swore, he needed to find Matty. The partner who he had abandoned as soon as he'd spotted Granger giggling at the bar had found someone else to play with.</p>
<p>Not that Draco gave a fuck anymore. The things holding him back from fucking Granger and making her his had gone out of the window the moment he had discovered her at a BDSM club. It didn't matter that she didn't like him, Draco would make her because there was no way in hell he was walking around with the perpetual hard on for the rest of his life and he knew that nothing would do other than keeping the feisty Gryffindor... she was his.</p>
<p>Single minded determination wasn't new to him, he had used this particularly intense aspect of his personality to dig himself out of the mire of his childhood, then he had ruthlessly used it to gain everything he wanted all his life, becoming an Auror, fixing things that he knew he had been wrong about when he was a child, regaining Potter and Weasley's trust and forming a friendship with them.</p>
<p>And now it was Granger's turn, he would have kept far away but she had ventured close enough for the predator in him to smell and now that he had her scent... the hunt was on.</p>
<p>Spotting the spiky blond hair, he was looking for he caught Matty by the scuff of his shirt.</p>
<p>"She left huh." He grinned mischievously, "Finally decided to step into the dark side then, don't worry I'll be infinitely gentle with you." He winked placing a flirtatious hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Cheeky little cunt, Draco grinned at down at him. "Not a chance big boy, why don't you give that bartender who's been running around like a panting dog after you a chance."</p>
<p>He pouted before giving Draco's arm another squeeze, "He doesn't have guns like these though. So, why're you here? I thought the two of you knew each other in school."</p>
<p>"We were, but we haven't spoken in like ten years."</p>
<p>"You were a massive knob, weren't you?"</p>
<p>"The biggest"</p>
<p>"What was the deal then? She the nerdy girl you made fun of? Or the poor girl you made fun of? Or the ugly duckling who you used to bully and now she's the swan?"</p>
<p>Draco winced; it wasn't exactly as easy as Matty made it out to be but he couldn't explain the bigotry he perpetuated as a child to a muggle.</p>
<p>"Shit that bad?"</p>
<p>"Worse, but I'm not here to rehash our sordid past, what did she talk to you about?"</p>
<p>"What makes you think she said anything to me?" Matty asked with a speculative look on his face.</p>
<p>"Don't give me that shit, you could sell ice to an Eskimo, you got her to talk. I want to know what she said." He said sternly, the Dom voice worked wonders in most situations.</p>
<p>"She did talk to me but I don't think you're what she's looking for." He wrinkled his nose delicately, "She wants a Daddy... you're more whips, chains and Master. Which isn't a bad thing, just not what she's probably looking for."</p>
<p>A Daddy... no wonder she was in Poison it was one of the few dungeons in London with a domestic discipline scene. He had seen plenty of Little's in here. Draco didn't do that, the whole Daddy/babygirl dynamic was much too intimate to have with most of his play partners but with Granger, he could imagine her calling out to him in her husky voice and his cock rose in anticipation.</p>
<p>"She's not a fan of the age play though."</p>
<p>"I figured she wouldn't be, it's fucking Granger."
