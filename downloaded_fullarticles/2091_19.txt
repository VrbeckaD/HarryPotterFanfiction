    <p>It was nighttime. Four Slytherins sat in the common room, one of them filled with mischief.<br/>
“I bet Longbottom’s a virgin.” Pansy said, breaking the silence.<br/>
“No kidding… That dweeb can’t even hold his wand properly.” Malfoy smirked in response.<br/>
“I bet he’s gay too.” Pansy continued.<br/>
“I don’t know, Pansy. I think he’s just a little slow. I highly doubt he’s into blokes.” Blaise Zabini, who was almost falling asleep lying on the velvet covered couch, joined.<br/>
“Wanna make it interesting?” Pansy’s smile was too wide for Blaise’s liking.<br/>
“I know I’m going to regret this but what do you have in mind?” The boy sighed.<br/>
“Well, I say you seduce him into a confession.” The smile never left her lips.<br/>
“What? Why me? Why not Malfoy? Or, better yet, Goyle?” Blaise was now fully awake.<br/>
“Well, because, first of all, he hates Malfoy. And Goyle? Please, as if he would ever be into him.”<br/>
“Hey! I can hear you, you know!” Goyle intervene.<br/>
“Whatever. So, you in?”<br/>
“Nuh uh, no way. What do I have to win anyway?”<br/>
“The joy of breaking Longbottom’s heart as we all laugh in his face, what more could you want? And, besides, you’re not afraid of falling in love with him, are you?”<br/>
“What? Of course not! That’s ridiculous!” Blaise felt his face heat up.<br/>
“Then it’s settled! Finally, some excitement. I was starting to think we had lost our touch.”<br/>
Blaise groaned. He was not looking forward to this at all.</p>
