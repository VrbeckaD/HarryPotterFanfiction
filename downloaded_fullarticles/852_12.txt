    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The Christmas trees are up in the Great Hall, sparkling with trinkets and ornaments and lit up with tiny little fairies jabbering to each other. All around the castle, the suits of armour have been enchanted to sing snatches of carols whenever anyone walks by, despite the fact that they do not know all of the words and often fill in the blanks with words of their own invention. In the corridors close to the kitchens, the scents of cinnamon, nutmeg and gingerbread pervade the air. Outside, the grounds are sparkling with frost, the lake completely frozen over, and out in the village of Hogsmeade, the snow dusting the roofs of the thatched cottages and the holly wreaths placed on the doors makes the whole town look like a seasonal postcard.</p><p>Surrounded by all this, it is no wonder that there is barely a single Hogwarts student focusing on classes or homework. It’s perhaps a lucky thing, then, that today is the last day of term before the Christmas holidays begin. Classes are finishing early for the day, and most students who are heading home for the holidays have already packed their suitcases and shut their owls safely in their cages, ready to board the Hogwarts Express.</p><p>For those staying in the castle, however, there will be festive end-of-term celebrations on offer in Hogsmeade, and many students are already buzzing with excitement, ready to dump their school bags in their dormitories as soon as classes finish, wrap themselves snugly in scarves and gloves, and head over to the village.</p><p> </p><p>When the bell finally rings at the end of the History of Magic class, signalling that term has ended and the holidays have officially begun, most of the Gryffindor seventh-years practically bolt out of the classroom, barely remembering to call a ‘Merry Christmas, Professor,’ towards their teacher, Professor Robert Peel, on their way out. Professor Peel chuckles in response, shaking his head a little as he walks over to talk to the single student left in the classroom.</p><p> </p><p>Unlike the others, Edward Drummond seems to be in no particular rush as he takes his time packing his books into his bag, smiling to himself slightly.</p><p>Peel grins at him. He knows that strictly speaking, as a teacher, he is not supposed to have favourite students. But where Drummond is concerned - Head Boy, modest, quiet, kind, and intelligent, with a passion for learning and a love for Peel’s subject in particular - it is difficult not to develop a bit of a soft spot.</p><p> </p><p>“Not rushing off to Hogsmeade with everyone else then, Drummond?” he asks him.</p><p>Edward grins back at his favourite teacher. “No, sir. My little sister Rosalie gave me her present early - it’s a book about the history of wizarding politics and Muggle politics in Britain, and the ways in which they intertwine and affect each other!”</p><p>Peel tries to stifle a laugh. He knows that most of his students would find a book like the one Drummond was describing deadly dull, and would read it only begrudgingly for homework. Drummond’s face, though, is shining with enthusiasm as he describes it.</p><p>“I thought I might take advantage of a relatively empty common room to settle down with my book, sir,” Edward continues, beaming.</p><p>He had been nagged rather intently by both his sister and by Florence Kerr from Ravenclaw, his best friend who had known him and Rosalie since they were all small children. Rosalie and Florence were eager to go out and enjoy the festivities in Hogsmeade, and both had pestered him to come. They had been somewhat put out with him when he had opted to spend the time reading his new book instead of going with them.</p><p>Edward feels a tiny bit guilty for turning them down; but then, he reminds himself, he had been looking forward to this opportunity for so long! He had been buried in exam preparation over the last few weeks, but wherever he went, he could not seem to escape the endless noise from other students. The Gryffindor common room had been especially loud, chaotic and overwhelming, heaving with so many people that Edward had found it near impossible to get to his favourite squashy armchair by the fireplace.</p><p>He’s sure the activities in Hogsmeade will be perfectly nice, but everywhere from Zonkos to Honeydukes to the Three Broomsticks will still be absolutely teeming with people and noise. This will be the first time in <em> weeks </em>that the Gryffindor common room will be almost entirely empty, and he can’t wait to finally get some peace and quiet, sitting in his favourite armchair, reading the book Rosalie had got for him while drinking some hot cocoa.</p><p> </p><p>Peel coughs a little awkwardly.</p><p>“Well, I’m glad to hear that you weren’t overly attached to the idea of going to Hogsmeade, Drummond,” he says, “but I’m afraid if you had your heart set on some quiet alone time in your common room this afternoon, I may have to disappoint you after all.”</p><p> </p><p>Edward frowns at him slightly. “What do you mean, sir?”</p><p> </p><p>Peel sighs. “There are a couple of students who have managed to get themselves a detention. The staff don’t want detentions dragging into next term, so it’s been decided that they’ll simply do their detention this afternoon instead, while the other students are out in Hogsmeade. I’m sorry to have to do this, Drummond, but as Head Boy and Girl, you and Miss Hanover will be required to supervise.”</p><p> </p><p>Edward groans. Not only does this throw a wrench in his plans, but supervising detentions is the Head Boy duty that he detests most. Asserting her authority comes easily to his friend Victoria Hanover, Head Girl and fellow Gryffindor - in fact he suspects she rather enjoys the experience - but Edward always feels rather ridiculous trying to enforce rules and tell other people what to do.</p><p> </p><p>“Who is it that’s managed to earn themselves a detention, Professor?” Edward asks.</p><p> </p><p>“George Paget, along with his younger brother from Hufflepuff, Alfred,” Peel responds.</p><p> </p><p>Edward sighs. He is all too familiar with George Paget - he’s also in Gryffindor, and in the same year as Edward, Florence and Victoria. Edward does have to admit that George can be very funny, even hilarious at times; but he also seems to think it is his mission in life to cause chaos. He’s <em> never </em>able to sit still or keep his head down in classes - in fact Edward is fairly certain that more than one teacher has been visited by an urge to strangle him - and Edward had often wondered if the level of noise in the Gryffindor common room was caused more by George Paget than by anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>As for George’s brother Alfred Paget, though, Edward is pretty sure he’s never met him, which makes sense given that he’s younger and in a different House, he supposes. Given that this Alfred has landed himself in detention along with George, though, Edward suspects that he’s probably just as loud and obnoxious as his older brother.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it that the Paget brothers did, exactly?” Edward asks warily.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, some ridiculous nonsense; they enchanted some mistletoe to persistently float around after poor Mr Penge as he went about his cleaning duties. Apparently they also ensured that this mistletoe would repeatedly ask Mr Penge, in a very high-pitched voice, whether he was ‘lonely.’” Peel rolls his eyes. “Hardly a capital offence, but Penge was rather adamant that they should be punished for their actions.”</p><p> </p><p>Edward struggles to keep a straight face, trying and failing to stifle a giggle. Of course it’s ridiculous and immature, but it’s also funny - true to form for George Paget, then.</p><p> </p><p>“I really am sorry to have to ask this of you, Drummond,” Peel says sympathetically, “but it should only take a couple of hours. The Paget boys have been given some extra homework to write; all that will be required of you and Miss Hanover is to sit and supervise, and make sure they’re actually doing work. You could even bring that book you were enthusing about to help the time pass quicker, if you like. So, could you and Miss Hanover please aim to meet the Paget boys back in this classroom, around an hour from now?”</p><p> </p><p>Edward sighs a little and nods, attempting to look more positive than he feels.</p><p>“We’ll be here, sir.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It’s almost the time that Peel told them to be back in the classroom now, and yet Edward finds himself tapping his foot, anxiously hovering as he waits for Victoria to get a move on.</p><p>She’d insisted that she needed to make a ‘quick’ detour to the Charms classroom, to ask Professor Melbourne for some advice on the essay she’d just given in. Edward can’t deny that Professor Melbourne is rather handsome, certainly one of the best-looking teachers at Hogwarts, but he’d somehow forgotten what a ridiculously huge crush Victoria has on him.</p><p> </p><p>He watches as she leans in a little closer to Melbourne as he sits at his desk, twirling her hair around her finger, her eyes trained on his face. Edward shakes his head, wondering if Melbourne really is oblivious to it, or if he’s just making a rather heroic effort to be professional.</p><p> </p><p>“I hope you didn’t spend <em> too </em>long agonising over my essay, Professor,” Victoria was purring, batting her eyelashes.</p><p> </p><p>Finally deciding that he’s been waiting long enough, Edward coughs pointedly, interrupting her. “I’m sorry to interrupt, Professor, but Victoria and I actually need to get going pretty quickly. We have a detention to supervise.”</p><p>“Of course,” Melbourne said. Edward grinned as he heard a trace of relief in the professor’s voice. “I wouldn’t want to keep you from your duties. Merry Christmas, Drummond, Miss Hanover.”</p><p> </p><p>Victoria sighs as Edward holds the classroom door open for her.</p><p>“You’re annoying, you know that, Drums?” she says as soon as they’re out of Melbourne’s earshot.</p><p>He grins a little. “Well, you’re obvious,” he responds, and she swats him lightly on the arm. “Anyway, we <em> do </em>have to get a move on, I wasn’t just saying that to annoy you.”</p><p>“I suppose,” Victoria grumbles, quickening her pace to match his.</p><p> </p><p>After a few moments’ silence, Edward speaks up again.</p><p>“Obviously, I already know <em> all </em> about George Paget,” he says, “so I’m guessing we’ll have no surprises there. But I’m pretty sure I don’t know his younger brother. Do <em> you </em>know anything about Alfred Paget?”</p><p>“Yeah, I know Alfred through Harriet Sutherland,” Victoria responds, “they’ve been friends since they were tiny.”</p><p>“And? What’s he like?”, Edward asks.</p><p>“Oh, Alfred is an absolute sweetheart, but he’s still a Paget,” she answers, grinning,</p><p>“Meaning?”</p><p>“Meaning, don’t trust the angel face.”</p><p>Edward nods thoughtfully.</p><p>“Given how pretty he is, it’s a damn shame neither Harriet or I have ever managed to get him to flirt with us,” Victoria sighs, pouting. “He’s not much like his brother in that regard - I don’t think either Harriet or I are exactly his type.” She shoots a wink at Edward, smirking.</p><p>Edward sighs. He can already feel a headache coming on.</p><p> </p><p>There is no sign of either Paget brother yet when they reach the classroom.</p><p>“Of course they weren’t ever going to get here on time,” Victoria mutters. “See, Drums? There was no need to rush me here so bloody quickly.”</p><p>Edward shrugs, sitting down at the desk at the front of the classroom, and pulling his book out of his bag. “Well, at least we’re here when we’re supposed to be.”</p><p>She huffs at him. “You are <em> such </em>a teacher’s pet, Drummond.”</p><p>He raises an eyebrow at her, silently reminding her of the reason he’d had to pull her away, and she blushes slightly, muttering “Shut up.”</p><p>Edward grins, returning his attention to his book.</p><p> </p><p>Only a few minutes pass, however, before they hear sniggering voices outside, and a smirking George Paget bursts through the door, with a much slighter boy in tow; Alfred, Edward presumes.</p><p> </p><p>“I really must apologise most humbly and sincerely for our lateness,” George says loudly, sinking into a ridiculous bow and shooting a flirtatious grin in Victoria’s direction. “It’s all my brother’s fault, I’m afraid.”</p><p>Victoria rolls her eyes even as she blushes slightly, determined to show George that she isn’t at all affected by his flirting.</p><p>“Sit down and shut up, Paget,” she says.</p><p>“If you insist - ”</p><p>“Now, Paget,” she says firmly, cutting him off. George grins, dropping down into the seat she’s pointing at.</p><p> </p><p>Edward barely notices any of this exchange. Everything else seems to have suddenly turned into meaningless background noise since the moment Alfred Paget stepped into the room behind his older brother.</p><p>Alright, so I <em> definitely </em> have not met him before, Edward thinks. I would have remembered…. <em> that. </em></p><p>Alfred Paget’s hair seems to be spun out of pure gold, catching every single ray of sunlight streaming in through the window. His eyes are such a bright, startling blue that Edward suddenly feels he’s falling through the sky, and they’re framed by sooty lashes longer than any Edward has ever seen on anyone else. Alfred doesn’t appear to be setting much store by the uniform code, either. He has discarded his tie entirely, and he does not seem aware that the top three buttons on his shirt have a purpose; his collar is gaping open, revealing his smooth neck and collarbone.</p><p>Alfred shakes his head a little, rolling his eyes at George’s attempts at flirting, and then looks at Edward, shooting a smile at him from underneath those ridiculously long lashes.</p><p>Absurdly, Edward feels his face start to burn as his heart begins pounding relentlessly. The next thing he knows, there is a loud thump and he jumps at the sudden sensation of pain; somehow, he has managed to drop his heavy book on his own foot. Blushing even more furiously now, he scrambles to pick it up, cursing himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Alf, you know I love you, but you <em> both </em>need to sit down and shut up, I’m afraid,” Victoria says, grinning slightly.</p><p>“I didn’t even…!” Alfred starts indignantly.</p><p>“Come on, the sooner you two actually settle down and do the shit you’re supposed to be doing, the sooner we can all get out of here,” Victoria says in her best ‘stern authority’ voice.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Alfred grumbles, sitting down at a desk next to George and taking out his quill.</p><p> </p><p>Realising suddenly that he’s <em> still </em>staring, Edward hastily opens his book and attempts to hide his still-pink face in it. This is an excellent book, he reminds himself sternly, and he’s been looking forward to reading it for so long. If the Paget brothers are actually going to be quiet and get down to their work, then that might mean he actually has an opportunity to read. He’s not going to waste that chance by staring at Alfred Paget like an idiot instead!</p><p>He’s <em> not. </em></p><p>Edward fixes his eyes determinedly on the page in front of him, but the book may as well be written in hieroglyphics, for all the meaning he’s gleaning from it. How is anyone supposed to focus on anything when <em> he’s </em>in the room?</p><p>While Victoria wanders over to try and ensure George is actually working, Edward can’t seem to stop himself from darting glances over at Alfred every few moments, needing another glimpse. It doesn’t help that every time he looks over, Alfred seems to be looking thoughtfully back at him with those startlingly blue eyes. Edward sighs to himself, trying to force himself once again to look at his book. No use. He can still feel Alfred’s eyes on him.</p><p>He looks up again a little while later, and jumps, slightly taken aback to find that Alfred has got up from his chair and walked over to the desk.</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you,” Alfred says, grinning at him again and causing Edward’s heart to do another backflip.</p><p>“No....you didn’t startle….” Edward responds, trying to remember how to string together a coherent sentence.</p><p>“I’m sorry my idiot brother and I have made you miss out on the Hogsmeade trip.”</p><p>Despite himself, Edward finds himself smiling back. “Don’t worry,” he answers shyly. “I wasn’t planning on going to Hogsmeade today anyway. I was actually going to settle down in the common room with this book while it was quiet. Wild party animal, I know.”</p><p>“Seriously?” Alfred asks. Edward nods.</p><p>“Must be a <em> very </em>interesting book, then,” Alfred says, laughing a little.  </p><p>Edward looks down, cursing internally as he feels himself blushing again.</p><p>“Well, no, I’m probably the only person at Hogwarts who would find it interesting, actually,” he mumbles. “In fact, my sister and my best friend said…”</p><p>“Why don’t you tell me all about it, and I’ll be the judge?” Alfred asks, cutting him off before he can ramble too much.</p><p>Startled, Edward scans his face, trying to figure out if Alfred is making fun of him - but all he sees is warmth, and genuine curiosity.</p><p>“Ok,” he says hesitantly. “Well, this book explores the history of both magical and Muggle politics in Britain over the last three hundred years, and examines the ways the wizarding and Muggle communities have affected each other. I’ve actually just reached the part about the Corn Law Repeal in the Muggle Parliament, in 1846, and the way the contemporary Minister of Magic, Hortensia Milliphutt, reacted to those Laws was just <em> so </em>weird…”</p><p> </p><p>Although he’s a little embarrassed at first, half-waiting for Alfred to laugh at him, before he knows it Edward is rapidly gushing about the book, enthusiastically explaining to Alfred about the parts he finds most fascinating. Florence or Victoria would have probably rolled their eyes at him and told him to put a sock in it by this point, but Alfred Paget seems to be showing no signs of boredom or impatience at all. In fact, he’s smiling slightly, astonishingly blue eyes fixed on Edward’s face as though he’s drinking in every word. Edward can’t help but feel a little thrill of pride at that thought.</p><p> </p><p>“How do you know so much about all this?” Alfred demands, grinning.</p><p> </p><p>Edward blushes again. “Well, I would never claim to be an expert or anything like that...but I guess both Muggle and magical politics kind of run in my family.” Alfred quirks an eyebrow curiously.</p><p>‘My sister Rosalie and I are half-bloods,” Edward elaborates. “Our dad Charles is a Muggle, he actually works as a private secretary to the Muggle Prime Minister at the moment. And our mum, Frances, works at the Ministry of Magic, in quite a senior position, actually. She’s in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement - she actually started this initiative to make sure there are at least three witches on the committee for every Ministry department, because she thought the Ministry was getting a bit too mired in tradition.”</p><p>“Sounds like you’re pretty proud of your parents,” Alfred comments.</p><p>“Oh, I am! Rosalie and I are both really proud of them!”</p><p>“Well, I’m sure they’re <em> extremely </em>proud of you, too,” Alfred says quietly, giving Edward another smile that seems to make his heart melt just a little.</p><p>“Well...I…,” Edward stutters. <em> Dammit, </em> he can <em> feel </em>his face going scarlet again!</p><p> </p><p>He seems to have lost the ability of forming a coherent sentence, again, as Alfred smiles at him.</p><p>He’s saved from making himself look like even more of an idiot, though, as Victoria suddenly appears at his shoulder, arms crossed and trying to look stern, despite the amusement written across her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice try, Paget,” she says to Alfred wryly. “But look, even your idiot brother is being a good boy and doing some work now.” She points over at George, who is scribbling away with his quill, attempting to look like the picture of innocence, though the effect is ruined somewhat by the smirk on his face.</p><p>“You know how much I <em> hate </em>to do this, of course,” Victoria continues, her glee evident in her voice, “but unless Drummond and I have seen you doing at least twenty minutes of actual work by the end of this session, then I’m afraid that, most unfortunately, we’re going to have to report to Professor Peel that you might be needing another detention to get everything finished. Right, Drums?” She shoots a smirk of her own at Edward, who nods reluctantly, struggling to look remotely dignified, which is made more difficult by the fact that his face is still pink and he can still feel his heart fluttering.</p><p> </p><p>Alfred rolls his eyes at her. “I’m on it, <em> ma’am </em>,” he says sarcastically. Edward tries to hide a smile.</p><p>Victoria twirls her wand lovingly in her fingers. “You know, I’ve been studying for the Defence against the Dark Arts final, and I really have been <em> itching </em>to try out this jinx…”</p><p>“Alright, alright, I’m going!” Alfred says hastily, standing up and moving back towards his desk, grumbling to himself. Edward hopes the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach isn’t too obvious on his face.</p><p> </p><p>He opens his book again, trying to focus, but he fares even worse than before, darting glances over at Alfred and wishing he would wander over to the front again. In fact, he’s ridiculously tempted to stand up and walk over to Alfred himself.</p><p>But Victoria, arms folded, seems to have decided that closer supervision is in order, and is standing over both Pagets warningly. She really is surprisingly intimidating for someone of her size, Edward reflects.</p><p> </p><p>For the next half hour or so, there is silence, apart from the ticking of the clock and the scratching of the Pagets’ quills. Fixing his eyes determinedly on the page in front of him, Edwards hears a slight pause in the scratching sound every now and then, and he can feel Alfred’s eyes on him. He can still feel himself blushing.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, Victoria breaks the silence. “Alright, Alfred, and idiot. Now that you boys have taken away our evening, you’re free. Go on, get lost.”</p><p> </p><p>Edward stands up, packing his book in his bag as slowly as possible. He’s desperate to speak to Alfred again, to try and make him laugh. If he’s honest with himself, actually, what he <em> really </em>wants to do is ask him out, and then kiss him senseless, not necessarily in that order. But he really isn’t sure how to explain any of that to Alfred, and certainly not in front of Victoria.</p><p> </p><p>Alfred seems to be packing up rather slowly too, especially in comparison to his brother, who appears to have put his things away in a split second, and is now bouncing impatiently on the balls of his feet. Alfred turns to look at Edward again, and opens his mouth as though about to say something - but George pipes up before his brother can get any words out.</p><p>“Come on, Plumpy, get a bloody move on!!”</p><p><em> Plumpy? </em>Edward thinks in bewilderment, wondering if he misheard.</p><p>Alfred sighs. “Alright, hold your hippogriffs, Gege, I’m coming….”</p><p> </p><p>George practically shoves him out of the classroom, although Alfred looks over his shoulder as he goes, glancing at Edward, who immediately feels his heart do another backflip.</p><p> </p><p>Once the Pagets have gone, Victoria immediately turns to Edward, hands on her hips, shaking her head in amusement.</p><p>“Oh, Drums, Drums, Drums,” she says, still smirking.</p><p>“What?” Edward responds with a feeble attempt at bravado, though without meeting her eyes.</p><p>“Wonderful Head Boy you are. Very authoritative and intimidating; in fact I’m trembling in my boots as I speak.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Edward mutters, though he feels he has a fairly good idea of what she’s about to say.</p><p>She grins. “Didn’t I warn you not to trust the angel face? <em> Obviously </em>Alfred just didn’t want to do any work in this detention, and he clearly saw immediately what an easy mark you were! You were just going to let him get away with doing no work at all, weren’t you? It’s lucky you weren’t supervising this detention alone! I’m using the word ‘supervising’ in its loosest possible sense, by the way.”</p><p>“I...I didn’t.....,” Edward stutters.</p><p>“Oh, come on, Drums, you fell for his flirting hook, line, and sinker.”</p><p>He stares at her, feeling suddenly like a colossal idiot. Victoria sighs, her face softening a little, and claps a reassuring hand on his arm.</p><p>“Oh, don’t worry about it too much, Drums. You’re not the first person to fall for the Paget charm, and I’m pretty sure you won’t be the last, either. Come on, let’s get you back to the Common Room so you can finally curl up with your beloved book. We’ll get you some cocoa; I’ll even let you cuddle Dash for a bit if you want!”</p><p> </p><p>Edward nods reluctantly, barely taking in her words. He loves having Victoria’s spaniel Dash curl up in his lap as he reads, and normally he would leap at the opportunity, as she’s so protective of Dash that she rarely lets anyone else touch him.</p><p>But right now, he is a little preoccupied, cursing himself for being such an idiot. Victoria was right; <em> obviously, </em>Alfred Paget had just seen an opportunity to get out of doing work, and he’d taken it.</p><p>He wishes he could kick himself. Yes, Alfred was gorgeous, but had he <em> really </em>had to make it so blindingly obvious that he thought so? Staring at him, practically drooling....god, Alfred was probably laughing about it with George at this very moment!</p><p>As Victoria locks the classroom behind them, he swallows, willing himself not to cry and make himself look even more pathetic.</p><p> </p><p>Well, he supposes Alfred Paget will just think of him as a gullible idiot from this moment on. But it shouldn’t be <em> too </em>difficult to avoid him, given they’re in different Houses and different years. Edward tries to ignore the ridiculous, hollow sensation of loss. He’ll just have to keep a dignified distance; that’s what a Head Boy was supposed to do, as Victoria had made so clear.</p><p>Honestly, he chides himself, he had gotten along perfectly well without even knowing who Alfred Paget <em> was </em>until a couple of hours ago! He could get along perfectly well without him now. There was no reason to let one person change everything.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>As he wanders along after George, Alfred feels somewhat dazed.</p><p> </p><p>George had told him on the way to the detention that the Head Boy, Edward Drummond, was a huge nerd - which seemed to be true, judging from the way he’d gushed about his politics book.</p><p>But how was it that George had completely failed to mention the fact that Edward Drummond was also utterly <em> gorgeous </em>? He was physically beautiful, Alfred could hardly have failed to notice that; tall and broad, with incredible cheekbones, intelligent dark eyes, and ridiculously curly brown hair that fell into his eyes whenever he glanced down at his book.</p><p> </p><p>But it was more than just the way he looked. It was the adorable way he ducked his head as his cheeks went pink. It was the way his entire face lit up as he explained about his book, his passion and excitement so clear in his voice. Ordinarily, Alfred would probably have wanted to bang his head against the wall if he had been forced to learn about the history of politics in class; yet somehow, Edward Drummond made it seem genuinely fascinating. And there was also the way he seemed to drench the entire room in sunlight, just by smiling shyly. There was nothing calculated about him, no flirtatiousness - he didn’t even seem aware of the effect he had!</p><p>They had never met before, but somehow Alfred felt, from the moment he’d walked into the classroom and set eyes on him, that he just <em> knew </em>him.</p><p>He never would have imagined he would feel this way about someone so quiet, so studious, so well-behaved - a ‘huge nerd,’ to use George’s phrase. But never before had he felt so instinctively drawn to someone.</p><p> </p><p>“That was a pretty good tactic you had there, Plumpy,” George comments in an impressed tone, interrupting his thoughts. “I mean, you managed to get away with doing barely any work! Excellent flirting action, I must say.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm?” Alfred asks vaguely. He’s finding it a little difficult to focus, his mind full of Edward Drummond’s dark eyes and shy smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait a minute…” George turns and puts his hands on Alfred’s shoulders, forcing him to a standstill. He scans his face carefully for a moment.</p><p>“What?” Alfred demands, trying to avoid his brother’s eyes. Apparently, though, he isn’t very successful, as George lets out a crow of laughter.</p><p>“HA! And here was me, all impressed by your strategic plan!! Oh my god, Plumpy, I can’t believe it - you really <em> are </em>head over heels for Edward Drummond, Head Boy, professor’s pet, and nerd extraordinaire!”</p><p>“No...I….don’t be an idiot, Gege,” Alfred mutters. “ I <em> was </em> being strategic…”</p><p>“Your reputation will be completely ruined once this gets out, Plumpy! <em> Ruined </em>!” George crows gleefully.</p><p>“Shut the hell up, Gege,” he mutters, striding ahead and cursing himself as he feels his cheeks burning, George still sniggering behind him.</p><p> </p><p>Dammit, he realises, George is right; he <em> is </em> in deep. He could feel his heart pounding just from George saying Edward Drummond’s <em> name </em> , for god’s sake, and all he can seem to think about is how soon he’ll be able to see him again. What is <em> happening </em>to him?</p><p> </p><p>He stops suddenly as a troubling thought occurs to him.</p><p>If George, who knew him better than most people, had initially believed Alfred was only flirting to get out of doing work...what did Edward think? Surely, Edward didn’t think Alfred had just been toying with him, manipulating him?!</p><p> </p><p>“Gege,” he says, turning back to his brother, his eyes wide. “Do you think he thought I was just screwing around?”</p><p> </p><p>George shrugs, looking a little concerned at the expression on his brother’s face. “How should I know what goes on in Drummond’s brain, Plumpy?”</p><p> </p><p>Alfred sighs. He can’t stand the thought that Edward Drummond might be feeling hurt, or stupid, or embarrassed, and all because of him.</p><p>Well, he thinks, it looks like he’ll be paying a visit to the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall tomorrow morning.</p><p> </p><p>God, George is right. He’s done for.</p>
