    <span>20th of September, 1979</span>

</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Mother and Father,</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We are delighted to announce the birth of our daughter, Hermione Jean Granger, </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>and we do hope you will be able to schedule a visit to come see her as soon as possible.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She is simply the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, life has never looked so fragile. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh, and she is so small, not too small but her newborn clothes are a bit big even. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>When her little hand touched mine, I was a goner, just like you said Mum.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>But enough of me waxing poetic about my princess, Kate says I must remember to thank </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>you for </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>our present.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The changing table you got us has already been a hit, she adores the colour blue it would </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>seem.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Kate had an uneventful birth, luckily, and labour was only eight hours, which we are told</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> is short </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>for the first child, although I believe Kate would disagree.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Her true eye colour hasn’t shown yet, but her bouncy curls are already 3 inches long. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She has her mother’s honey-brown hair. And I’m already talking about her again, ah well,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> it cannot be helped. I can already tell she’s going to be the smartest little lady around. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Love,</span>
  </em>

  <em>
    <span>Dear Michael  and Katherine ,</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We cannot wait to meet our little granddaughter and have just now booked the first available </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>ferry-ride from Paris to London, which is next Friday.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I hope all is still well, she sounds absolutely wonderful and we cannot wait to spoil her rotten. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Your father has already bought her a new stuffed elephant, which I’m sure she’ll love. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Give Kate our best, and be gentle with her, the hard part is over, but she’ll not be pain-free </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>for a while yet. Make sure to have some hot-water bottles on hand when she needs it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We should be arriving at our usual time at 5 in the evening, but we’ll catch a cab to your place</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> so not to put more on your plate, I know you’ll be needing to go back to the practice soon.</span>
  </em>

  <em>
    <span>I thank you kindly for this esteemed invitation, unfortunately,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> I am unable to accept as Hogwarts is due to have a high number </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>of students staying for Christmas Holidays, and I have already </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>

  <em>
    <span>The staff were all very honoured to receive your invitations,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> and I anticipate a high turnout to your magnificent event.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Allow me to also preemptively decline Headmaster Dumbledore’s</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span> invitation, as he is also otherwise engaged during December.</span>

  <em>
    <span>I cannot believe you are deigning to invite my colleagues to this already ridiculous event you expect me to attend.</span>

  <em>
    <span>Consider yourself warned that I will be supremely skulky despite your wife’s inevitable threatening of my limbs.</span>

  <em>
    <span>If you insist on being a cantankerous old man at my gala then I suppose you give me no choice.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We will be announcing you Draco’s godfather, at this so-called ridiculous event, you twat. So you will behave or I will do more than threaten bodily harm.</span>

  <em>
    <span>Consider me chastised. I am of course deeply honoured, although I must protest. The Notts would be much more suitable candidates for you Draco. You know how I am with children, after all- it is not by choice that I teach at this ridiculous school. The only love of my life, Chemistry, is keeping me sane here.</span>

  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You are out dearest friend Severus, regardless of you youthful misadventures. I do wish you would allow us to help appeal your sentence, it is utterly ludicrous to keep your brilliant mind at a school for a decade because of a mistake.</span>

  <em>
    <span>Dear Lucius and Narcissa,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Nevermind my sentence, I will humbly accept it as a blessing if your child is as witty as his mother. Even if I fear to get whiplash from her whirlwind of emotions.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>If you insist I will accept the title of godfather, but I regret that I will not be able to visit more in the coming years.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>My punishment is just, considering others my age will stay in prison for another decade yet.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
