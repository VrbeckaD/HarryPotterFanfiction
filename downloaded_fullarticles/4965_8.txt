    <p>Harry sat leaning against the pillows on his hospital bed, on his lap lay a recent discarded issue of the Dailey Prophet. A lot had occurred since his collapse in the great hall soon after the final battle against Voldemort.</p><p>“Evidently dying and returning to life was more than even his body could take,” Harry thought with a snort of morbid amusement. His body had a serious amount of internal damage too, as well as several broken bones that he was informed needed to be banished and re-grown because they were shattered by one of the many spells his body took during the battle.</p><p>Harry even found out that he had nearly completely drained his entire magical core which resulted in his being in a comma for the last six weeks. The ministry was nice enough however to ensure that their savior, what were they calling him these days oh yeah “The Man Who Conquered,” had guards at the hospital to keep away rogue death eaters, fans and the press. 
Harry thought the monikers was all just a load of Hippogriff dung. He didn’t understand why the wizarding world insisted on giving people such foolish titles.</p><p>“You’re awake I see,” Pomfrey greeted when she entered his private room looking over his chart.</p><p>“How long do I have to stay here?” Harry questioned.</p><p>“You’ve been out of a comma twelve hours Mr. Potter and you’re requesting your freedom already?” Pomfrey asked with laughter in her voice her brow raised at him. This pleased her greatly because it meant that he was truly on the mend.</p><p>Harry snorted replying, “You know how much I dread being confined.”</p><p>“Yes I do young man, but you have been unconscious for six weeks Mr. Potter and you will be here for a while yet.” Pomfrey advised. “You need rest to regain your strength; your magic levels aren’t nearly has high as they need to be before you can be released.”</p><p>“Now your friends have been here asking about your health. I have informed them that you have regained consciousness and that they may visit you after lunch.” Pomfrey informed him.</p><p>Harry sighed he could imagine the fuss Hermione and Ron made when he fell unconscious all those weeks prior. He didn’t think he’d been out of commission that long. </p><p>“Who all has been here?” he questioned.</p><p>“Everyone naturally,” Pomfrey stated as if he should have known, “The Weasley’s have been here asking about your health, Professor McGonagall as well as your other professors, Madame Tonks as been by on several occasions and Mrs. Granger. You have had many inquiries on your well being of course I would not give out any information on your health status.” Pomfrey assured him.</p><p>“Now rest,” She ordered gently before leaving him to rest.</p><p>Without much else to do Harry opened the paper again and began reading about the rebuilding efforts being done around the wizarding Britain. Many establishments were damaged in the Village of Hogsmead as well as, Diagon Alley but Hogwarts took the most damage with the final battle taking place there.</p><p>Finding nothing else of interest in the paper, Harry starred out the enchanted window that showed a view of a rose garden. Some of the events of the final battle were in a sort of vacuum and he couldn’t remember them clearly Harry wasn’t sure if it was due to being unconscious for six weeks or if he’d suffered a concussion from his fall.</p><p>“Knock, knock!” a voice called out from the doorway bringing Harry from his thoughts. </p><p>“Morning Minister Shacklebolt what can I do for you?” Harry asked folding his hands in his lap the news paper once again forgotten.</p><p>“You gave us quite a scare Mr. Potter.” Kingsley informed him, taking the seat across from his bed.</p><p>“I assure you this has come as a shock to me as well,” Harry stated he didn’t think he was as seriously injured as he was to land himself a stay in a hospital ward. </p><p>“I’m sure you are wondering what all has been going on since you fell unconscious in the great hall?” Kingsley questioned. </p><p>“Yes Sir, Madame Pomfrey hasn’t seen fit to inform me of anything since I’ve regain consciousness. I am curious however as to why I haven’t been bombarded by guest.” said Harry. </p><p>“Many of the injured were treated and released while the others were transferred here to further their treatment. You were among the people transferred. You haven’t received any unwanted guest however because you have an auror posted at your door for security reasons.” Kingsley stated.</p><p>“Was that truly necessary?” Harry questioned. </p><p>“Unfortunately yes it is. All the death eaters weren’t captured and we are still collecting them and putting them in holding cells until trials dates can be setup for them. I have been selected as in-term Minister of Magic.” Kingsley informed him. </p><p>“That brings me to my reason for being here.” Kingsley started.</p><p>“What’s this about?” Harry questioned confused as to why Kingsley would need to speak to him about death eater trials.</p><p>“Severus Snape is currently being held under guard in one of the private rooms being treated for a deadly snake bite.” Kingsley stated. “He says you have information that would be pertinent to his release of wrong doing.”</p><p>Harry sighed, “I have memories yes. I wasn’t aware that what little we, I mean Hermione and I were able to do was enough to keep him alive long enough to get him help. Harry didn't  personally like the git, but he  had a healthy respect for what the man managed to do for the order during the war.”</p><p>“After that; things got so…” Harry became silent for a moment before he sighed... “The battle started and I went to meet him in the forest and then the battle started again.” Harry wanted so much to tell him what happened but he felt like there was this huge chasm in his chest.</p><p>“Its okay Harry,” Kingsley stated patting his hand in sympathy. “The battle of Hogwarts was very traumatic for everyone involved. No one would fault you for feeling overwhelmed by it all.”</p><p>“It will probably be a while yet before the trials will start but I’m sure your testimony will be needed at some of them. Don’t worry yourself over that now.” Kingsley stated again patting his hand seeing the panicked expression on his face. </p><p>“Now to the matter of your break-in at Gringotts. As you know that has caused quite a stir. There isn’t much detail as to what you needed from Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault only that you successfully broke in and stole an artifact but a dragon as well Harry.” Kingsley playfully scolded. He found the thought truly hilarious.</p><p>Harry swallowed around the lump in his throat he’d forgotten about their break in at Gringotts. Goblins weren’t known to forgive thievery. </p><p>“You’re going to have to explain the reasoning behind the break in Harry.” Kingsley informed him. </p><p>Harry sighed closing his eyes briefly to gather his thoughts, when he opened them there were two aurors in the room one who now had a dicta quill and pad waiting for his statement.</p><p>“Dumbledore has been researching Voldemort since my parent’s death in October of 1981. He never truly believed that Voldemort was truly gone from this plane of existence. You see Voldemort had taken many steps against death.” </p><p>“He learned of a way to prevent death through research of the darkest of magic. He learned of horcruxes at Hogwarts; he had spoken with professor Slughorn about them as basis of research and Slughorn feared what he would do with the information. Creating a horcrux requires a person to commit a heinous act, to kill another, complete a ritual that would allow them to split their soul and anchor it to an object. As long as the object exists the person would never truly die.” Harry explained ignoring the distressed sounds coming from the two aurors.</p><p>“Did Voldemort succeed at making this horcrux?” Kingsley questioned. </p><p>“Yes sir, he split his soul six times,” Harry continued to explained. “I destroyed the first horcrux when I was twelve. At the time I didn’t know what it was. Ginny came into the possession of a diary that began possessing her opening up the chamber of secrets; it was the diary belonging to Tom Marvolo Riddle.”</p><p>“Each horcrux was something of significance, his personal diary, the loss diadem of ravenclaw, the Hufflepuff cup, Salazar Slytherin’s locket as well as a family heirloom ring and the last being his pet snake which he kept close by him at all times.”</p><p>“I’m sure you heard about the break in at the ministry” Harry sighed. “Umbridge somehow came into possession of the locket of slytherin which was a horcrux and we had to retrieve it at the time we didn’t have a safe means of destroying it. So we had to keep it with us for months.”</p><p>“It was revealed to us in the forest of Dean that the sword of Gryffindor could be used to destroy the horcrux because it takes on properties that makes it stronger.” Harry explained. </p><p>“How so?” asked Kingsley now intrigued.</p><p>“Basilisk venom was infused in the sword of Gryffindor when I killed the basilisk and I used a basilisk fang to destroy the first horcrux in the chamber.” Harry continued.</p><p>“It wasn’t until we were captured by snatchers that we realized that Bellatrix had another horcrux in her vault at Gringotts. She became enraged when she saw us with the sword and wanted to know how we got it. She thought we had stolen it from her vault,” Harry breathed slowly forcing himself to continue. </p><p>“We were only there a matter of hours before we managed to escape taking Griphook, as well as Olivander, Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas who was being held captive in the holding cells with us but we loss Dobby in the process.”</p><p>“We used the hairs Hermione acquired from Bellatrix for poly juice potion; Ron used charms to disguise his appearance, while I used my cloak to cover me and Griphook. We entered Gringotts with the help of Griphook he wanted the sword of Gryffindor in exchange for helping us get into the vault.”</p><p>“But we were headed off when we got to the vault snatchers were already outside firing spells a us and Griphook refused to help us without getting the sword first. So we gave him the sword anything that was touched in the vault began replicating itself in hopes that we would be crushed trying to escape.</p><p>Our only means of escape was on the back of the dragon that they have trained to expect pain when they hear noise I might add.” Harry explained he didn’t like the fact goblins were being cruel to dragons even though they had the ability to burn them all alive.</p><p>“We traveled on the back of the dragon until we reached the river then we jumped. We didn’t go to Gringotts with nefarious intentions. We only went for the cup and that’s all we took nothing more. There was no gold taken from the vault, no precious gems, nothing.” Harry stated, "The magic of the horcrux would have tainted or warped the magic of the vault if it had remained their long enough. I didn't think goblins would appreciate a soul container being stored in one of their vaults."</p><p>“The last two horcruxes were found during the battle at Hogwarts. One being the loss diadem of ravenclaw and the other being Voldemorts pet snake which I’m told Neville Longbottom is responsible for killing.”</p><p>That should be enough to satisfy Gringotts Mr. Potter,” Kingsley stated as the two aurors left the room.</p><p>The next day Harry spent the morning in magical whirl pool that was suppose to stimulate his leg muscles to help rebuild his muscle tissue so that he wouldn’t be so stiff from being in a comma for six weeks.</p><p>From there he was laid out on a rubber table with a towel thrown across his midriff before he was given a deep tissue massage that left his body feeling as strong as a wet noodle.</p><p>By the time afternoon rolled around Harry was tired but greeted Hermione with a cheerful smile when she entered his room.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p> The next morning Harry got a surprise visit by who he thought was Narcissa Malfoy. Andromeda much like her deceased twin sister Narcissa Malfoy ne Black and could be described as exceptionally beautiful but unlike her sister her face didn’t hold the expression of something unpleasant under her nose.</p><p>“How are you young man?” Andromeda questioned as she made her way over to where he was sitting up in bed. Her grandson in her arms sleep, tuffs of blue hair could be seen under the small cap covering his head.</p><p>“I’m as well as can be expected being confined in such a small space.” Harry explained. “How are you fairing?”</p><p>“I’m taking things a day at a time,” Andromeda advised sitting back. “I’m not sure Mr. Potter if you are aware of your position in the current state of things,”</p><p>“I’m not sure if I understand what you mean mam.” Harry stated totally confused.</p><p>“I was sure that Dumbledore would’ve prepared you for your responsibilities.”Andromeda stated more to herself then Harry.</p><p>“I don’t mean to seem obtuse but what responsibilities?” Harry questioned.</p><p>“You are the inheriting heir of the Potter family which means you are the head of family. You are also probably named inheriting heir of the Black family, knowing my favorite cousin as I did.” Andromeda stated.</p><p>“I’m sure you will be receiving information soon from Gringotts now that the war is over and things are returning to some form of normalcy.” Andromeda stated simply.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes as they began to burn his throat closing up from his need to keep his emotions concealed; the memory of his last Christmas with Sirius flooding his mind. </p><p>(Christmas at Grimauld Place 1995 memory) </p><p>
  <em>By Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable, the tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets and a great Christmas tree decorated with live fairies, blocked the Black family tree from view in the drawing room. The skirt around the tree was unseen by the sheer number of presents under the tree. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry woke Christmas morning to Sirius tramping pass their bedroom door singing remarkably off key “God Rest You Merry Hippogriffs,” at the top of his voice heading to give Buckbeak his breakfast of dead ferrets. </em>
</p><p><em>The large table was filled with dishes of sausages, bacon, eggs and home fried potatoes and stacks of toast and two pots of tea on either end</em>. <em>The atmosphere was light with conversation. Harry allowed the different conversations to wrap around him as he enjoyed spending Christmas away from Hogwarts and Umbridge.</em></p><p>
  <em>After breakfast the dishes were cleared and in the sink where they were spelled to wash themselves. Harry remained at the table long after his friends had returned upstairs to their rooms.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He had waited for this moment; he and Sirius were planning to exchange gifts in private. Harry had mentioned the muggle tradition to him. Muggles unwrapped their gifts together as a family. He couldn’t wait to experience many new family moments with Sirius and Remus. They were the closest links to his parents and truly all the family he felt he had. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He remembered being so worried at the shouting he heard from the kitchen. Sirius and Mrs. Weasley had, another disagreement about something.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I heard yelling is everything okay?” he questioned worried that Sirius was in trouble or something. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Everything is fine.” Remus assured him, “Dumbledore doesn’t want you knowing certain things and Molly and Sirius have a difference of opinion.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry could see a hint of sadness around his godfather. “What’s wrong Sirius you seem sad?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m fine pup” Sirius sighed leaning back in an arm chair “I just hate being in this house and I miss your parents.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I couldn’t help but hear Mrs. Weasley,” Harry admitted, “Why would she remind you that I’m not my father?” Harry asked confused. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius sighed, “I’ve been experiencing flashbacks and when I do I’m often confused and it can take sometime for me to get things straight in my mind. It’s one of the effects of being exposed to dementors for so long.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Because you and your father look so much alike she doesn’t want Sirius to confuse the two of you.” Remus added. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“But why would he confuse us though?” Harry asked confused, he and his father weren’t even the same height or build. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“James and I were lovers Harry,” Sirius sighed; he never planned to tell him that. It was before your father and Lilly got together and yes your mother was aware of the relationship. I was very much in love with him, he loved me but he was so in love with your mother it hurt.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I knew I would never love another man other than James. So I stood by him as he married your mom. Then they had you and I fell in love with you the moment I held you in my arms.” Sirius eyes were glassy but distant as if he were seeing something long forgotten. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It wasn’t until you were about three months old that our lives became irrevocably changed.” Sirius stated coming back to himself “James wanted me to have full rights to you incase something were to happen to him or Lilly. He didn’t want anyone making decisions for you that were not in your best interest.” Sirius informed Harry. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Our only option was the Congnationen Hereditatem potion when brewed properly will allow the blood adoption of a child into another’s blood line making them their child by blood, you became my son by blood on the eve of your first birthday. You were then renamed Hadarian James Orion Black-Potter.” Sirius explained. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“This does not mean that your mom isn’t still your mom by blood.” Sirius continued to explain, “by taking the potion you then had three parents’ two fathers and a mother.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry paled his heart raced Sirius was his father, not his godfather. “But how come I still look just like my father?” Harry questioned none of what he was being told was making any sense. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You’re mother was very clever Harry.” Remus admitted, “You are under very heavy blood glamours they will start fading now that you are fifteen years of age and be completely gone once you are 18 years of age.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why do I have to wait until then? I would rather know what I look like now instead of waking up to a strange face one day.” Harry stated. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sirius walked towards the bookshelf in the room removing a statue before the whole shelf moved. Harry mouth fell open in shock he didn’t know there was a secret passage in this room.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus smiled at his expression waiting for Sirius to return with a vial filled with a potion. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Without a word he handed the potion to Harry. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sitting on the large sofa Harry took the potion vial, without further thought Harry drank down the potion and waited for the affects. It was slow going until he felt pin pricks under his skin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry moaned when the first pain hit curling into himself waiting for the potion to take affect. But as quickly as the pain stated it stopped leaving Harry breathless. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>When Harry opened his eyes they were the same emerald green as his mothers, however now instead of having his father’s unruly locks Harry’s hair was now wavy like Sirius hair although it remained black. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Another thing Harry noticed was that he could now see without his glasses removing them from his face. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well I’m I still a James Potter clone?” he asked causing the two older men to laugh. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No you are actually a compliment to all your parents,” Remus simply stated handing him a small conjured mirror. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry noticed his eyes remained like his mothers, he still had his father’s full lips but he had Sirius high cheek bones and thin face structure and nose. He was grateful he no longer had the cursed Potter hair but Sirius hair but Potters inky black color more so than Sirius color. He was even more happy to see that he wasn’t as short as he was previously, he stood 5’10 and hoped to gain another few inches before he reached his majority in the next year. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The changes were subtle only thing noticeable was his height change and Sirius explained that they could explain that away be using a small glamour that he would teach him that he could use to slowly increase his height over the coming year. </em>
</p><p>Harry came out of his thoughts wondering how much of his life was going to change once his true heritage was revealed.</p><p>“Have you thought of where you will stay once you are released from the hospital?” Andromeda questioned.</p><p>“I’m sure the Weasley’s are expecting me to come there once I’m released.” Harry explained, “However I’m not sure that it’s a good idea so soon after the loss of Fred. I’m planning to return to Grimauld Place for the foreseeable future.”</p><p>“You’ll do no such thing young man,” Andromeda stated “I have rented a small brownstone in the West end of London. My home was destroyed when my Ted was forced to flee to escape snatchers. I expect your arrival upon your release.”</p><p>Harry opened his mouth to refuse he didn’t want to be a burden on anyone. Number 12 Grimauld Place was plenty safe and heavily warded. “I appreciate your offer, but, it’s truly not necessary.” Harry assured her.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, I can only imagine the state that house is in with that demented house elf not taking care of it properly. Its not fit to live in, you will need time to fully recover and accept your titles at Gringotts.” Andromeda stated ending any argument he could have come up with.</p><p>Grimauld Place was still awful even with all the work that the Order had done in fixing the place up Harry admitted even if only to himself. Kreacher had neglected the house for too long and it showed. Harry knew he would have to work on getting the house renovated.</p><p>“However that isn’t the reason for my visit.” She continued. “I’m sure that you are aware that you are the legal guardian of my grandson.”</p><p>Harry looked shocked he wasn’t aware of that. “No Mam I can’t say that I was aware of that fact. I know I was named his godfather but not listed as his guardian.” Harry replied.</p><p>My daughter and son-in-law's will list you as my grandson’s magical guardian. Magically you are responsible for his upbringing.” Andromeda advised.</p><p>Harry nodded his head; tears fell freely from his eyes. His heart ached with the loss of Remus.</p><p>Harry looked over at the small child who sleep peacefully, tuffs of blue hair on his head his chest rising slowly has he breathed.</p><p>Before she could continue an owl flew in through his open window landing on the table beside his bed. Harry removed the scroll from its leg before it immediately flew from the room.</p><p>Breaking the seal Harry unrolled the parchment…</p><p> </p><p>Dear Lord Potter-Black,</p><p>Due to the climate at your coming of age we were unable to successfully contact you. This letter is to inform you of your inheritance. As per the instructions listed in the will of James and Phoenix Potter, you are inheriting heir of the Potter estate. As per the instructions listed in the will of Sirius Black you are the inheriting heir of the Black family. Enclosed in the accompanied envelop are your family rings they should be placed on your right ring finger in the following chronological order, red velvet case, gray velvet, blue velvet and last black velvet. Once you have been accepted by the rings a listing of your holdings will appear. We here at Gringotts offer our congratulations on your coming of age. Please contact Gringotts at your earliest convenience to resolve issues presented in the wills.</p><p>Apponox</p><p>Potter Account Manager</p><p>Gringotts London</p><p>Harry opened the brown suede pouch finding the four ring boxes. Opening each he looked them over.</p><p>Harry picked up the red velvet box removing the gold ring with a beautiful ruby in the center what he thought were the deathly hollows was actually the family crest.</p><p>Harry placed the ring on his right ring finger before picking up the next box. The Pyrite family ring was also gold however the stone was a sparkling emerald with cross wands engraved in the center of the stone. The two rings melded into one before he added the Potter and Black family rings.</p><p>Potter head of family ring was titanium the stone of the ring with a sapphire engraved with a Gryphon with a sword in its mouth whom wings were stretched in flight.</p><p>The Black head of house ring was also titanium with a stone of Onyx engraved with a coat of arms engraved with a B and two grim like dogs standing on either side. Harry slipped the cool metal onto his finger already prepared for the flow of magic Harry sighed when his mind seemed to settle.</p><p>When the all four rings combined the images seemed to meld into one image. The Pyrite family crest was at the bottom center of the ring above it was the Peverell crest, the Black crest seemed to separate and the two grim like dogs stood on either side of the Peverell crest. The Potter Crest however was at the top as if standing on the tip of the crest the Gryphon with a sword in its beak its wings stretched as if going to take flight.</p><p>The gold and titanium of the rings blended perfectly. Harry was surprised that the rings didn’t feel heavy on his finger. It was as if he only wore one ring and not four rings blended together.</p><p>It was only a few minutes before the parchment had multiplied and filled with information on his holdings separated by family name. “Sorry about that. It was a notice from Gringotts they had trouble reaching me during the past year because I’d been on the run for most the year. It was about my parents will.” Harry informed her. Harry placed the stack of parchments aside, not wanting to deal with it right then.</p><p>“Not a problem young man, I’m sure you will be meeting with Gringotts to get your estate in order. I’ve taken up enough of your time and should be heading home. We will have time to discuss your place in the scheme of things once you are released.” Andromeda stated rising from where she was sitting.</p><p>Long after Andromeda left, Harry lay staring out the window. He didn’t know what his life would bring now that Voldemort was gone but he was going to meet it when it came.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
