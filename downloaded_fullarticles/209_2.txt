    <p>Sirius knew he had hit rock bottom today when he ended up doing his grocery shopping at a 7-eleven of all places because everywhere else was closed but on the bright side he is about to be done, he just has to pay and be on his way out, so when he gets to the cashier he is about to start paying, but then the lady behind the desk tells him that a boy outside had been eyeing his motorcycle for a while now and that he might try to steal something.</p><p>He turns to look outside and he could only see a young boy, he doesn't even think that he would be tall enough to reach the pedals, let alone steal his motorcycle and the only thing he could take would be his bag which is tied to the bike and almost empty. </p><p>He is about to laugh when he thinks of the one thing inside of his bag. </p><p>Fuck. His wand. </p><p>He gives the money and says to keep the change, takes his bags from the woman's hands and runs outside as fast as he can and as soon as he is out of the door and close enough to his motorcycle he yells “Hey! what are you doing?” </p><p>He was expecting the kid to jump back like if the motorcycle was on fire and splutter some explanation but instead he just puts his hand on top of the seat like if he was just touching the leather to check if it was real or not and he hadn’t been about to open his bag and mug him.</p><p>Well, this ought to be interesting.</p><p>“Just looking.” He has an accent that Sirius can’t really recognize and he says it with such confidence that he almost believes it.</p><p>After a second, he is finally taking a step back and looking back at him, he is younger than what Sirius was expecting, he is tall enough to pass for twelve or maybe a really short fourteen year old but his baby face screamed that he was probably around the age of ten or maybe he was eleven. </p><p>“You have a sweet ride, sir, congratulations,” he says politely as ever, he sounds like some sweet victorian orphan just looking for a loaf of bread from some novel.</p><p>“Thanks,” he responds with a shrug as the kid looks at him like he is studying him like he is trying to look for a sign or something like that. </p><p>“So what are you doing tonight?” he asks tilting his head to a side like a lost puppy dog. “Are you going to a party?”</p><p>Sirius frowns. “No, what would give you that idea?” </p><p>The kid points at the cans of soda and the alcohol in the bag and suddenly he gets what the kid was thinking and suddenly feels very self-conscious about the fact that this kid is seeing him spent his Saturday night grocery shopping at 7-eleven. </p><p>What is he supposed to answer?</p><p>
  <em>No, kid, I’m not on my way to a party, turns out all of my friends are too busy to hang out with me so I’m going to spend it getting drunk with these bottles right here.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Oh fuck it, who cares about what he thinks? He is just a child that he is probably not going to see again.</p><p>“Nope, I’m just grocery shopping,” he says, the kid looks at the rest of his bags like he finds something funny so before he can say anything, he uses the one way he knows can shut him up. “Do you want one of the sodas?”</p><p>“Yes, please,” he responds almost too eagerly as Sirius gives him one and takes it in such a rush that he feels like he was trying to rip his hand as well but the way he says “Thanks, sir” before he starts drinking makes up for it. </p><p>He almost finishes the whole thing in one gulp and it makes Sirius think about giving him the rest of the pack or maybe even buying him a sandwich or maybe something bigger, he could give the kid his shopping bags (he’ll just take the vodka), he could always buy more later.</p><p>However once he sees the kid is done with the soda and cleaning his mouth on his sleeve, all he can think about is asking him, “So you are not from around here, are you?”</p><p>The kid is silent for a couple of seconds before saying, “I guess i just moved here.”  </p><p>He doesn’t know what he is supposed to respond to that so he gives him one of the pudding cups  from his bag before asking, “You move often?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he said before grabbing the pudding cup, “Do you?” </p><p>“I only moved once when I was 16 from my parents' house,” he responds because it’s easier than explaining that he was running away from some crazy shithole full of dysfunctional assholes to a kid who is rapidly empting that pudding cup.</p><p>“Good for you,” he says, and this time enthusiasm seems to be gone and Sirius feels like literal shit because he knows that there are probably thousands of reasons why this kid could be sad but the first thing he thinks about is that he is probably cranky and wants to go to sleep, it's late already and where are this kid’s parents.</p><p> “Where are your parents?” he asks basically on a whim. </p><p>His whole demeanor changes on a second, he looks up at him suddenly suspicious like he was ready to curse his ass to hell, if looks could kill, he would have been dead on the floor before you could say “Avada Kedavra”.</p><p>“What are you? A cop?” He takes three steps back like he is preparing to run and the can of soda is balled up in his hand like he was planning to throw it at him, politeness be damned.</p><p>He can’t even be mad, that was a good escape plan since he thought he had been cornered.</p><p>“Of course not, fight the man–” he said quickly almost humorously before realising that he probably shouldn’t swear in front of a kid, he was still looking at him like he wasn’t sure if he should believe him or not, “I’m not a cop, kid, I’m serious.”</p><p>Ha. Inside joke for himself. </p><p>“Fuck cops,” he adds for good measure and the kid nods looking more relaxed and at ease.</p><p>After a second of silence the kid looks up at him as he turns a charming smile towards him and asks him, “So since you are not a cop done with your grocery shopping, would you be interested in buying something else that might interest you?”</p><p>It sounds like a forty year old car salesman and it makes Sirius want to crack up. </p><p>“Dude, how old are you? you are probably like ten,” Sirius asks and he can tell that annoys the kid but he can’t hold it back, he finds it funny. “Alright, what are you selling? Boy Scout Cookies or some shit like that?”</p><p>“I’m sixteen,” he responds stiffening like he is trying to make himself look taller, so confident that Sirius is tempted to believe him but that baby face says otherwise and then adds mockingly, “Also Boy Scout Cookies? What are you like eighty?” </p><p>“Are you saying that there is an age restriction for your clients?” </p><p>“Are you saying that you want to be a client?” he asked, sounding both excited and exasperated like he had been waiting for this moment since he started that conversation. </p><p>“Sure, what are you selling?” he shrugs, the kid walks in front of him as if turning his back to the 7-eleven’s shitty security camera and once he does that, he knows what he is about to show him before he opens his jacket and he starts telling him all the stuff he is selling.</p><p>There is an awkward silence for a couple of seconds and suddenly he wants to ask him what age he is again and who his parents are and if he needs help, he suddenly looks so much younger that he did at the beginning of this conversation but he doesn’t say any of that because he knows kids like this (he was a kid like this) and he knows he’ll run or he’ll deny everything, he’ll treat him like he is insane and maybe he is, he is the one trying to keep a conversation going with the world’s tiniest drug dealer. </p><p>“I’m not buying weed from a toddler,” he responds cutting the kid off, he looks back at him annoyed and rolls his eyes ready to walk away but stops dead in his tracks as soon as Sirius asks, “Are you hungry?”</p><p>He stays there with his back turned at him like he is frozen for a second and Sirius knows he needs to make a stronger offer or he’ll walk away and he is worried about what might happen to this little kid if he does “Do you want to go to get food? I know this place-” </p><p>He turns around so quickly that he thinks he might snap his neck but instead of giving a confirmation, he sharply says “I don’t do that type of work!! So you better back off!! OR I’LL-”</p><p>“No, I wasn’t asking for that,” he says shaking his head horrified wondering if he had gotten those types of propositions before, “you just look hungry and I don’t like to eat by myself, that’s all”.</p><p>There is a long moment of silence in which he notices that the kid had pulled out his pocket knife but was starting to retract it. </p><p>“That’s all?” he asks like he doesn’t buy it, so Sirius nods for good measure. He is still looking at him like he wants to skin him alive and breathing heavily but his gaze has softened like he is considering it but then he shakes his head, “I can’t, I have work, I have to pay-”</p><p>“I’ll give you money to pay, now come on, it’s at the end of the block,” he insists and the kid is still looking at him like he is not sure about this but he nods and starts to walk behind him. </p><p>“You should take your bag, someone might try to take it,” he advises innocently like he wasn’t trying to mug him twenty minutes ago. </p><p>Still he takes the bag and they start walking in the direction of the restaurant when he realizes something. </p><p>“Wait, what’s your name kid?” </p><p>“Jesus fucking christ, you just want to know fucking everything first where I’m from, my parents, my age and now my name,” the kid responds in such an exaggerated way that it makes him laugh. </p><p>“Yeah and yet you haven’t answered any of my questions,” he responds as he gently nudges the kid in the shoulder. </p><p>“Well, I know nothing about you, how about I make the questions for a change, huh?” he says defiantly looking up at him. “What’s your name?” </p><p>“I’m Sirius”</p><p>The kid rolled his eyes “Fine, I’ll go first, my name is Boris, now what’s yours?” </p><p>He cracks up when he hears that before putting his hand on his shoulder and saying as earnestly as he can manage “No, my name is seriously Sirius”.</p><p>Boris looks at him before doing a side glance like he thinks that name sucks and he is not about to explain the whole details about the Black family and their name decisions because this kid probably doesn’t care about any of that. </p><p>“Damn, did your parents like not love you?” he says after a second and a part of him should be hurt really but he has to laugh and can’t help but nod too, which does seem to startle Boris for a second like he is ready to apologize but Sirius does a dismissive gesture with his hand. </p><p>“Not really but who cares, right?” he responds with a shrug, the kid sort of nods and he  opens the door and lets the kid walk in first “Now let’s talk about important stuff like where do you want to sit?”</p><p>Boris walks towards the table in the back and he follows him, the waiter gives him two menus so that they can decide what to eat and Sirius doesn’t really look at the menu for long, the boy is looking at him like he is expecting something. </p><p>“Pizza?” Boris asks as he leans forward like he has forgotten a word and tilts his head as he asks “Yes?”</p><p>“Yeah, pizza sounds good,” he nods as he waits for the waiter to return, “you know that’s actually one of my favorite muggle foods”.</p><p>Fuck. </p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I said it’s one of my favorite Italian foods.” Boris started shaking his head like he knew that wasn’t what he had said. Fuck. Sirius did the first thing that crossed his mind and took the menu and quickly hid behind it. “Do you want pepperoni pizza or american pizza?”</p><p>“Yes!” he answered quickly with a giant smile on his face.</p><p>“Cool” he smiled as he saw the waiter come back towards them with two glasses of water.</p><p>“Are you and your little brother ready to order?” he asks him,and he almost shakes his head but what is he supposed to say,<em> No, sir, my actual little brother and me are not on speaking terms anymore, this is just some random child I just met, we are just eating together because well he has spunk and I like that, also I'm lonely and he is hungry, no, I’m not a weirdo I swear, I just don’t like to eat by myself and all my adult friends are busy</em>.</p><p>Yeah, he just tells him their order and he leaves, Boris is quiet for a few seconds and he can see him looking at him more detailedly like he is looking for someone or something.</p><p>“Yes?” </p><p>“Do you think we look alike enough to be brothers?” he asks, still staring at him like he could see inside of his soul. </p><p>He wants to say that he doubts it, they are not even the same race, but ends up staring back at him for a couple of minutes and realizes that he wasn’t looking for someone that looked like him, he was looking for someone that looked like his brother. </p><p>For someone that looked like Regulus. </p><p>He pushes the thought away and stares deeply into this kid’s face and huh, maybe he is right, they do look alike, they might have different eye color but they both have dark black curly hair and they do have similar facial features. </p><p>“Honestly yeah, if time travel was real, you could be my love child,” he says as he realizes that and the kid sputters into laughter, it’s extremely violent and strong like one moment wasn’t happening but now it is and it can’t stop like some sort of explosion. </p><p>He can see a couple sitting next to them turning to look at Boris with a judgy look like they want him to keep it down and if they say something, he’ll-</p><p>Well, he doesn’t know what he will do, he just knows that it won’t be pretty and for now he just gives them a warning look that basically screams “I dare you to say something” and eventually they turn back to whatever they were talking about and Boris’s laughter eventually dies down. </p><p> The kid stays quiet for a second before saying “I want to go to the bathroom”. </p><p>Sirius nods but Boris doesn’t stand up from the seat, he is about to explain that Boris doesn’t really need his permission to go  to the bathroom, this isn’t a class and he isn’t his dad, he can just go, when Boris says “You’ll be here when I come back, yes?”</p><p>“Yeah, where would I go?” he asks a little bewildered, their pizza hasn’t even arrived yet. </p><p>“You could leave and I would have to pay the bill by myself”. </p><p>“I won’t, I promise,” he insists but Boris is still sitting there debating with himself if  should go or not, so Sirius says, “I swear on my friends' lives that I won't go anywhere, Boris”.</p><p>Boris looks at him and then back at the table like Sirius had just said nothing which hurts a little bit but he can deal with it, he gets it. </p><p>“I can go with you?” he offers and he is expecting him to decline but then Boris nods and finally stands up. </p><p>So he follows him. </p><p>He walks inside of a stall and Sirius waits outside feeling awkward as ever, they walk in at the same time that a dad walks in holding hands with his son, Boris basically ignores him as he gets inside of a stall. </p><p>The kid finishes before Boris does and the dad has to remind him to wash his hands and the kid hurries to get to the sink, the dad looks back at him as he says “Kids, am I right?” </p><p>Sirius is about to say that this isn’t his kid, not really but again, what is he supposed to say?</p><p>All he answer is a very weak “yeah”. </p><p>A second later Boris comes out of the bathroom and they can finally get back to the table. All he is glad about is that he didn’t have to remind him to wash his hands. </p><p>As soon as they sit down Boris asks a question. “So what do you do?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” He knows what he means but he is trying to play dumb.</p><p>“Like for a living?” Boris asks, strangely focused, “like work?”</p><p>“I work with my friends,” he lies and he feels like that will be enough for him to change topics, maybe talk about his friends. </p><p>“Work like me?” after a second he shakes his head, “Mine? Yes? No?”</p><p>“No,” he responds, feeling bad because the kid is obviously making an effort to communicate with him and he is giving short answers and he sees him looking down at the table, hunched over and decides that, fuck it, he can lie better, so he says, “I lied, I don't work, I live off my uncle’s money”. </p><p>“You do look rich,” he replies with a small shrug looking more comfortable again, “like ...fancy?”</p><p>“My family is known for casual elegance, that’s like one of the few good things about them,” he mentions and the kid snorts. “What about your family?”</p><p>He looks at him like he is checking for something, a sign in and he is opening his mouth about to answer when the pizza arrives and then the only thing he is opening his mouth for is to try to stuff it up with the first slice of pizza he could get his hands on, he is having some issues pulling it apart so Sirius helps him.</p><p>“There you go, kid,” he offers with a smile while putting it on a plate, he notices that the kid is staring at him intently again, he was expecting him to just say thank you and start eating. </p><p>“My full name is Boris Pavlikovsky,” he says in a hushed tone like he was worried someone would hear him, he looks at him expectantly and Sirius doesn’t know how to tell him that he has no idea of what that name is supposed to mean.</p><p>“I'm sorry, I don't-”</p><p>“You don’t watch the news,” Boris says quickly now eating his pizza and speaking at the same time, all he can do is shake his head, dammit maybe he should read those newspapers Moony always has. </p><p>“No,” he responds taking his first slice of pizza and eating quietly even if he was feeling his stomach turn. </p><p>“My dad is in prison,” he admits with a shrug like it’s everyday information, “he is not good, just not a good person, yes?”</p><p>He doesn’t know how to respond to that, a big part of him wanted to answer that it depends on what he did, because legality doesn’t always include morality, but then Boris says, “He killed someone in New Guinea. With a pipe wrench”. </p><p>Hearing about how the man died should have been the most disturbing part but it wasn’t, the thing that horrifies him was how Boris was miming how he had died meaning that there were two options: the first one his father told him about it in detail or the second one he witness it first hand.</p><p>He wants to ask what happened, how it happened and how he can help him  but instead all that comes out of his mouth is a strong “Oh fuck”. </p><p>“Yeah, fuck,” Boris nods in agreement just when the same couple that had turned to glare at them a while ago was just standing up to leave, they stop there clearly horrified at the language from such a young child. </p><p>“Fuck off and leave,” he tells them because honestly if there was any point in a child’s life where he should be allowed to swear, this would be the moment. </p><p>The woman gasps in outrage before telling him “You are a horrible example for your kid, it’s no wonder why he doesn’t have any manners”. </p><p>“You don’t fucking know anything so why don’t you just follow my advice: fuck off and leave before I stand up,” he responds automatically, he could hear Boris trying to muffle his laughter unsuccessfully. The man looks like he is about to say something but then Sirius acts like he was going to stand up and then the man takes the woman by the arm, they get out of the restaurant as quickly as possible. </p><p>He doesn't break eye contact until they are out of sight.</p><p>“Sorry,” he says but all Boris did was finally let out his explosive laughter before shaking his head as if he is telling him not to worry about it and Sirius didn’t know how not to worry about him right now, he waits until the laughter would die down again, “so where are you staying?”</p><p>“Orphanage,” he responds with another shrug, “it’s nice, I mean-I been without a house before so it’s better than nothing, yes?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he responds quickly but it’s like more and more questions pop up inside of his head, “do they treat you well?”</p><p>“No one beats me if that’s what you are asking, I mean the staff is nice but it’s hard to live with so many people, it’s crowded,” he responds as he stuffs himself with another slice of pizza, “and I know I won’t get adopted but it’s better than nothing, once I was in Ukraine and I was living in the street and there was this big black car - anyway that doesn’t matter, the point is I almost got kidnapped so it’s good to just have a place to stay.”</p><p>“You don’t know that,” he says, and Boris looks confused like he doesn’t understand what he is saying. “I mean you could still get adopted, there could be a family who would want you, there has to be, right?”</p><p>“No, I’m too old,” he didn’t sound hurt or desperate, he talked like this was just another fact of life. </p><p>“No, you are not-”</p><p>“Yes, I am,” he repeated, “people want babies”. </p><p>“You are technically a baby” he felt like he was about to start ranting about how he knew that Boris was young as soon as he saw him, he might be tall for his age but he has a baby face, he is clearly young, clearly a child who clearly needs help, a home or just someone.</p><p>“I’m eleven, that’s old,” he said it like it was a death sentence and there was no other way around it, “but that’s okay, it doesn’t matter if no one wants to take care of me, I can take care of myself, that’s why I work”. </p><p>There are a lot of things going through his head after he hears that, the first one is that this kid shouldn’t be working but he knows that won’t mean much because he still has to do it, then also that he is not “too” old, that was his exact age when he went to Hogwarts for his first year and that’s young, extremely young and he doesn’t know how people could look at this kid and think he is too old to be taken care of. </p><p>The rest of the dinner is quiet even if they do end up making comments here and there, he pays the bill and then remembers what Boris told him about how he needs to pay a guy, he doesn’t completely understand his business but he doesn’t give him the money right away, he insists on driving him there instead, he looks annoyed by this, like Sirius is going to ruin his image at work, but at the end, he gets on his motorcycle and they arrive there. </p><p>He had imagined that the person Boris would meet was a scary forty year old man but instead it’s just some teenage girl with long hair with split ends smoking a cigarette, that asks Boris if Sirius is bothering him but after she is reassured that nothing weird is happening, she walks away counting her money. </p><p>“So I guess this is goodbye then?” Boris says as he turns to look at him and Sirius feels some type of dread that starts at the pit of his stomach.</p><p>“How about I drive you to the orphanage?” he offers because the idea of little Boris walking around in the middle of the night with money in his pockets terrifies him. </p><p>“Okay!!” he says as he climbed back into the motorcycle. </p><p>Boris guides him all the way there and it feels like time is going faster and faster by the second, coming closer to that place, a part of him wanted to find a way to convince Boris to stay for a little longer because the idea of sending him back makes him feel physically ill but before he knows it, Boris says “Stop!! it’s here!!” </p><p>He helps Boris to get off the motorcycle and to climb the fence, he can’t believe he does this every time he sneaks out during the night and that he does it on his own, he sees him from the other side of the fence smiling at him like he is getting ready to say something. </p><p>“Hey, take this,” Sirius offers him some more cash through one of the holes of the fence. </p><p>Boris takes the cash and puts it inside of one of his secret pockets that he has in the jacket and looks up at him beaming before saying “Thanks for everything, Sirius”. </p><p>“Hope to see you again, kid,” he says. Boris nods before he runs inside the building, he turns around to wave at him a couple of times but this time it does feel like a goodbye. </p><p>He stays outside for a while, not sure of what he is doing there, he is freezing and he already knows that Boris made it home safe and it’s late so he should head out to his flat, right?</p><p>Right. </p><p>Sirius regrets coming to his flat as soon as he walks through the door because even if he is inside everything still feels cold and empty, he lays on the couch, then on his bed and then onto the floor, first as a human and then as a dog but he still can’t sleep, he starts to look for something to read, only to find one of Moony’s old newspapers and he sees the headline, he doesn’t recognize the name but he does recognize the last name so he starts reading. </p><p>The newspaper doesn’t mention Boris by name but it does mention two things that Boris didn’t mention, the first thing was that his dad hadn’t just killed a man in New Guinea but multiple people in different places, the second one was that the circumstances Boris was living in were horrible enough to get his dad charged with child abuse, they don’t get into the details but all he keeps thinking is Boris saying that his dad wasn’t a good person and that he was too “old” to have another family but he could have another family, he should have another family, someone should step up and take care of him.</p><p>Oh my god. That someone should be him. </p><p>Right? It makes complete sense, he has enough money and time to take care of a kid, Boris is not an infant, he wouldn't have to wake up every night to change his diapers or to sleep train him so this is something he could totally do, he has a perfectly good bedroom that he could use and he can do it, he is an adult and they really clicked tonight so why not? </p><p>He actually doesn’t really sleep that night, instead he looks for his papers and looks for his best suits to wear tomorrow morning, he thinks of how much he is going to have to bullshit on the paperwork and he is already making up a cover story, he is hoping that the people that work there would just want to get Boris off their hands and won’t pay too much attention to some of his more sketchy details. </p><p>When the morning actually arrives, he is already out of the shower, clean and shaved and well dressed, he doesn’t want any reason to be turned down, he doesn’t know why he is so worried about that and there should be no reason for that to happen, he is an adult, a very responsible adult who wants to give a child a home and has the means to do it. </p><p>So that’s what he is going to do. </p><p>He still eats his breakfast because he imagines that the process might take all day so he might as well feed himself, he thinks of bringing Boris some food because he got the impression that the kid is always hungry but decides to ultimately not do it because it might look weird for him to bring food to a kid that he "hasn't met yet". </p><p>Oh fuck it, he'll take him some pudding cups. </p><p>He walks inside of the building feeling confident until the first person he talks to takes one look at him and tells him that they are not looking to hire new people. </p><p>"No, I'm actually looking to adopt," he says expecting for the woman to change her tune but she is still looking at him like he just told her a bad joke "No, I'm actually serious". </p><p><em>Ha. Inside joke</em>.He passes all of his paperwork to her and she looks convinced this time. </p><p>"I want to adopt an older child," she looks up from the papers, "like let's say an eleven year old". </p><p>"Why an eleven year old?" she asks him, confused.</p><p><em>Because yesterday I met an eleven year old that reminded me a lot of myself, and I couldn't sleep thinking about how someone should take care of him and I had an epiphany, that someone should be me</em>.</p><p>“I was eleven when I left my home for the first time” he is technically not lying, he did leave... for boarding school but she doesn’t need to know that, “to put it simply, I never had a good relationship with my parents and I want to adopt an eleven year old because I know that those are the kids less likely to get adopted... and I know better than anyone what it’s like to be a kid that nobody wants so yeah... that’s why I’m here.'' </p><p>That’s all true, like he said he is not lying. </p><p>The lady looks up at him with a heartfelt smile, like she is actually moved and she might cry but quickly composes herself as she takes a second look at his papers. “Alright, please follow me, Mr. Sirius Black”.</p>
