    <p><br/>
The first time they met, Percival Graves was drunk.</p><p>He wasn’t thinking clearly, his hair wasn’t neat like he used to style it and he was wearing a pair of pyjamas he hadn’t taken off for four days straight. It was five months after Grindelwald had been caught and they’d found him in a hidden room of his own house.<br/>
The first face he had seen after three months of imprisonment was that of Seraphina Piquery, because it had taken the president herself to lift the wards and locks Grindelwald had put on the house during his stay in it. He remembered the hurt in her eyes as she looked at him, the guilt, and these days he wondered if she would ever look at him the way she used to again.<br/>
<br/>
After that, he’d been kept in the infirmary at MACUSA for three months to recover. He’d had the best healers trying to mend some of the mess Grindelwald had left of his mind. Now, he was allowed to stay in his own home that had been returned to it’s original state as much as possible, but he was still part of an ongoing investigation.<br/>
<br/>
So he got drunk, because it didn’t matter, and he didn’t wash or shave or do much more than occasionally brush his teeth because his mouth tasted like death. A Graves was supposed to die protecting the ones who couldn’t fight for themselves, and here he was. In the end, Grindelwald had probably plucked state secrets right out of his mind like a little girl picking flowers from her neighbors garden.<br/>
His new wards never went off, remained completely silent, but there was a faint noise coming from the cellar. It was a tapping, scratching kind of thing and Percival wouldn’t have thought too much of it once upon a time, but these days were different. His house didn’t feel like safety, or like home, it felt like a foreign place that had betrayed him the way only something you truly trusted could do. His wand felt the same way. Where it used to give him a feeling of control it now felt like it was nothing but a cold, polished piece of wood that didn’t represent him anymore. Still, he clutched it tightly as he silently opened the door to the cellar and the noise immediately got louder. It was like someone was hitting some sort of metal object, and the rhythm of it made Graves decide that it definitely was caused by a living thing.<br/>
As he ascended the stairs slowly with bare feet, he could see that the tiny window on one side of the cellar had been pushed open, and the hairs on the back of his neck immediately stood up as his body tried to prepare for a fight.<br/>
<br/>
But he wasn’t prepared. Not for the <em>thing</em> hunching in the far corner of his cellar or the way bony hands were urgently banging what looked like one of the cans of baked beans Percival kept down here against a sharp brick edge. It vaguely reminded Graves of a raccoon he’d seen in an alley once on his way home, a thin and starving thing trying to open a box of cookies next to a trashcan. This creature looked just as desperate, fingers slightly uncoordinated and ragged, the dark mop of hair matted and in dirty strands. It didn’t look fully human, parts of the figure were blurring into a cloud of black smoke that moved in a strange pattern. It had it’s back to Graves, and he could barely make out the shape of the ragged, dirty clothes hanging from too thin shoulders but he was pretty sure he could see the knobs of the boy’s spine, the shape of his ribs through the worn fabric. </p><p>Percival found himself wishing he didn’t have that whiskey now, and that his head wouldn’t feel so heavy so that he could trust his own mind, but for the time all he could think was that the obscurial he had read about in all the reports was alive, /in his house/. The boy Grindelwald had used, not unlike he had used Graves’ face. Only that the boy had been innocent, neglected, <em>defenseless</em> up until the point he had lost control of his own strength. Percival had read Tina Goldstein’s report, had picked up on the bitterness between the lines as she described the obscurial’s execution.<br/>
<br/>
Graves didn’t realize that he had completely frozen in place, holding his breath until he heard himself suck in some air, and the faint noise was enough to make the whole situation escalate. The <em>creature</em> - the boy, man, whatever, reared around like he’d been his and for a terrifying moment Percival saw dark eyes go completely white at the sight of him, before everything exploded into black. Graves felt numb and all he could do was to throw up a hasty magical shield around himself as something icy slammed into his chest, knocking his head back against the brick wall with a painful crack. He heard the sound of his wand hitting the floor more than he even felt it leaving his hand and he reached out to catch himself as he was thrown to the ground. His right hand caught on the rough brick wall and some sort of sharp edge cut right through his skin in the middle of his palm. It was the feeling of blood, so very warm when the pressure of solid black smoke around Graves’ was so cold that finally snapped him out of his haze. There was a rush of adrenaline, his instinct to /survive/ kicking in for the first time in months and without thinking, he gathered his magic and hurled it towards the creature pushing him down with no words but strong intent, making the mass retreat a few steps. Percival rolled away before the mass of black crashed into the wall next to the little open window with a force that had the bricks there splintering and the ground shaking. </p><p>„Wait!“ Percival shouted, finding his voice at last. </p><p>To his surprise, the creature stilled for a second at the sound of it, seemingly hesitating, before it moved jerkily closer to the window. It pooled like smoke beneath the ceiling and in the corners, clearly torn between attacking Graves again but also staying as far away as the cellar would allow. It was about to flee, Graves realized as he pushed himself up to his feet.<br/>
 „I’m not who you think I am. Credence, is it?“ he asked, but apparently the obscurus was done listening because it gathered and jerked closer to the little window. Only when it slammed shut did Graves realize that he had reached out with his wandless magic to close it.<br/>
<br/>
The cloud whipped around as if to look at him, size him up, and Graves raised both his hands in a placating gesture, one of his palms still dripping blood.<br/>
„I’m sorry, I can’t let you leave like this.“ Graves decided out loud.</p><p>He felt oddly calm. For the first time in nearly a year, he felt like he could make a decision. Percival had failed his country, his president, friends, and his family name. He should've died before Grindelwald had a chance to pluck any answers out of his mind, he should have died protecting his country and the people he cared about. Even if apparently, he'd never actually let those people get close enough to even notice his replacement.<br/>
Life had just given him a second chance at doing the right thing, getting back as much honour as a man like Percival Graves deserved at this point.<br/>
<br/>
He remembered a story his mother used to tell him and his little sisters, of the great wizard Merlin himself, helping King Arthur and his knights.<br/>
His favourite one had always been of the large dragon, a beast not even Merlin could defeat, and when the battle came to an end and it looked like Merlin would lose, the wizard used old, dark magic -<em>blood magic</em>- to tie his own life to the great beasts, connecting their very souls.<br/>
"If I die, I shall take you with me.“ he remembered his mother telling them in the mock-deep and thunderous voice she had always used to voice Merlin, and it was a line little Percy had repeated over and over as he played pretend with his sisters in the following years. It had stuck with him that Merlin had been so ready to give his life protecting the ones he loved.<br/>
<br/>
Blood magic was forbidden, it was an old thing almost impossible to fully control. It could be used for a lot of evil and it could go terribly badly, he’d heard many horror stories about it back at Ilvermorny. But now he was looking at a mass of black that twitched angrily and was probably about to lash out at him again, and he was blocking it’s way out into a world of innocent no-majs.<br/>
<em>Intent</em>, he reminded himself as he gathered all his magic, feeling it burn in his veins, ready to fight for him for the first time in months. It was all about the intent if you used a non existent spell. The words came without thinking, tidbits pulled together from over a decade ago when he’d learned latin in school.<br/>
His cut hand was still bleeding as he raised it towards the mass before him, and as it lunged towards him he threw himself at it, meeting it halfway.<br/>
<br/>
„<em>Adligare anima!</em>" he heard himself shout and there was a flash of copper and gold, his bleeding hand made contact with something suddenly solid amongst the mass of black. There was searing pain, a distant scream, a shock of ice that burned through every vein in his body.<br/>
<br/>
Then, there was nothing but darkness as he passed out, crumbling in on himself against the damp floor. </p>
