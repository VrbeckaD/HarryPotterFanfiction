    <p>Dinner, A Harry Potter FanFic<br/>Dad...” His Dad was busy having an in depth conversation with Uncle Ron at the end of the table. Fred nervously combed his ginger Afro and placed his comb back in his pocket, carefully. It was his only one, after all. His mother had taken him out especially for it.

All his cousins and his sister gossiped at the other end of the table, all the grownups seemed to be talking to his Dad now, apart from Molly, Hugo and Teddy who were preparing dinner.</p><p>He wondered why it was so hard to speak up, to ask. Four years at Hogwarts had brought him more confidence- but clearly not enough. It was just a picture, probably a mistake right? A practical joke, his Dad was prone to those. </p><p>Procrastinating, he remembered the afternoon before they broke up for the summer. Thomas Dean-Finnegan was with him by the lake and they were tossing rocks when Head Professor McGonagall tapped him lightly on the shoulder, her eyes were sad as she handed him a folded paper, wearing sad smile that matched her eyes she turned, and walked away. Thomas had nosily peered over bit Fred had shoved the paper into his pocket. Away from prying eyes, later that evening on the train home, he removed himself from the crowded Weasley-Potter carriage, to an empty one. He took the pallet from his pocket, a little crumpled but he unfolded it never the less. What he saw was incredibly confusing, the people in the painting seemed confused. They stared at him for some time and then gasped, they began to wave frantically. Fred was in a state of stunned silence.</p>
