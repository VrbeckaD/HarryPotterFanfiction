    <p>Credence stood by the entrance of the café, hesitant to walk inside.</p>
<p>He’d never actually been in a café. Not once in the almost-eighteen years of his life. Until now, he’d never even wondered what it would be like; such things - leisure time, entertainment, going out - were so far removed from his daily routine, he couldn’t imagine going somewhere without a specific goal, just to have a good time.</p>
<p>It’s not like today was different. Today he had a task, too. An unusual one, sure, but still - he came there for a reason.</p>
<p>Technically, it was all Newt’s fault.</p>
<p>Yesterday, they’d walked from school together, talking about nothing in particular. Newt offered him to come over, and Credence agreed. He was hoping Newt would feed him; Newt usually offered tea, at least, and sometimes real food. It was always so good and tasty, too. Not that Credence was coming over just to eat. He liked hanging out with Newt. He didn’t even mind Newt’s weird ideas, despite them getting in trouble for those more often than not. It was fine, though. Because Newt liked him, at least well enough not to call him names, unlike the rest of their classmates.</p>
<p>As they sat down to do the math homework together - Newt was struggling, and Credence helped him out, as usual - Newt suddenly pushed the book away.</p>
<p>"Do you like girls?" he asked out of the blue.</p>
<p>Credence blinked, mortified a little.</p>
<p>"Why?" he asked back.</p>
<p>Newt stood up to pace; sitting still was a torture for him, and his <span>restlessness </span>was the main reason Newt’s grades always suffered despite him being smart and perceptive.</p>
<p>"I dunno. Girls, crushes, dating... Romance." Newt grimaced. "I’ve never been into this tosh myself."</p>
<p>Newt’s family moved to New York only a couple years ago, and his speech pattern resembled a bizarre patchwork of several accents he’d picked up while traveling. He infected others with some of his fancy words, too.</p>
<p>"Well. You know how Jacob Kowalski is always like, oh she’s so hot, so pretty, I want to kiss her and whatnot. And I’m like, alright mate, whatever. But he’s been hanging out with the Goldsteins lately, and... I’ve been too."</p>
<p>"Okay..?" Credence frowned, confused.</p>
<p>Jacob Kowalski was popular. His father was a military officer, and his mother had a bakery. He was funny, easy-going, brave. Obviously, he got along splendidly with a charmer like Newt, and never bothered to talk to a black sheep like Credence.</p>
<p>"So," Newt continued. "We’ve been talking, and I started thinking: maybe girls aren’t so bad after all. They’re... kinda fun, actually."</p>
<p>"Oh." Credence paused. "So, you like the Goldstein sisters?"</p>
<p>"What? Pfffft, no. Well, not like that. I don’t know, maybe? Tina’s kinda cute."</p>
<p>Newt stared, expecting a reaction. Credence shrugged carefully.</p>
<p>"She’s okay, I guess. You like her, then?"</p>
<p>"What, no, of course not!" Newt laughed.</p>
<p>They were silent for a while, back to their books. Naturally, it didn’t last.</p>
<p>"Oi, you want to see something?" Newt called in a hushed voice. "It’s a secret, though. You have to promise not to tell anyone."</p>
<p>Like whom, Credence wanted to snicker.</p>
<p>He was poor. Painfully so. Wearing old clothes - they couldn’t afford new clothes more than once per year, usually for his sisters since they were still growing; all black, because it needed less washing and it was easier to hide the stains they couldn’t remove with cheap laundry supplies. He couldn’t go on school trips or hang out with the others when they went out to eat or play or dance. He couldn’t even afford proper lunches because the tiny amount of money his mother was giving him for lunch, he spent on peppermints to hide his bad breath; which he had because his back teeth were hurting but they couldn’t afford a dentist.</p>
<p>Book-smart, with good memory, Credence was somewhat of a star student. He got mostly A’s and rarely B’s. He was respected for that, because everyone knew whom to ask for help on a test. But as a person? His classmates never liked him.</p>
<p>Out of the classroom, nobody but Newt talked to him. Nobody even approached him. He had no friends. It wasn’t their fault. Nobody wanted to hang out with the ugly kid who has nothing to offer. It was natural; just the way things were.</p>
<p>But Newt talked to him. Newt trusted him enough to share secrets.</p>
<p>So Credence nodded.</p>
<p>"I won’t tell."</p>
<p>With a sly smirk, Newt waved him over to the computer.</p>
<p>Credence watched as Newt searched through the browser tabs - unlike Credence, who kept what little space he could control neatly organized and as free of any <em> personality </em> as possible, Newt always had a dozen of tabs and apps open - before finally finding the right one.</p>
<p>A tab containing photos of Tina Goldstein... at the top of what looked like a dating site profile page.</p>
<p>"What’s this?" Credence asked.</p>
<p>"It’s my fake dating profile," Newt explained. "I’ve registered as Tina."</p>
<p>Credence didn’t get it.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"To talk to other girls, obviously!" Newt laughed. "I figured girls don’t like boys much. I mean, why would anyone like boys?"</p>
<p>Feeling a traitorous warmth creep up his neck to his face, Credence shook his head.</p>
<p>"N-no idea..."</p>
<p>"See," Newt nodded, apparently satisfied with the answer. Credence let out a sigh of relief. "Girls don’t like boys because we know nothing about them. But other girls, they know. They know what girls like, right? And it’s less creepy when you’re a girl and another girl talks to you, rather than a bloke, right. No pressure. They open up. It’s brilliant! I gathered so much intel already."</p>
<p>"But this is a dating website." Credence looked at the title of the page. "Don’t you get messages from guys too?"</p>
<p>"Nah, I’ve specified I’m only interested in girls and my goal is friendship. They only show your profile to people of the gender you specify, unless you go to their page first, then they’ll see you’ve been looking at their profile... I don’t look at guys, though. And if someone gets pushy, I tell him I’m a lesbian."</p>
<p>"And it works?"</p>
<p>"Hm... not as much as I thought it would? Ignoring or reporting them helps, though. Mostly." Newt shrugged.</p>
<p>"Again. Why are you doing this?" Credence asked, still confused.</p>
<p>"Talking to girls?" Newt looked at him as if he said something stupid, then grinned. "Well, it’s fun. It gives me... ideas. Like what a real girl would fancy, you know."</p>
<p>Credence looked at the photos again. Tina smiled, dimples on her cheeks, short hair smooth and perfect.</p>
<p>"A real girl. Like Tina?"</p>
<p>Newt, startled, took a step back.</p>
<p>"M-maybe. I mean, she’s a girl, alright."</p>
<p>Credence looked his friend in the eyes. It was difficult for him to hold eye contact, but he forced himself not to look away.</p>
<p>"For starters, she probably wouldn’t like you using her name and face to pretend to be a lesbian."</p>
<p>Newt laughed for some reason, as if Credence said something funny.</p>
<p>"She wouldn’t, would she!" Newt clasped his hands. "Well, you’re not going to tell her, right?"</p>
<p>Maybe he should. But he promised not to. And it wasn’t really his business.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then it’s all good." Newt shrugged, nonchalant. "Hey, wanna eat something? I’m starving."</p>
<p>That got his attention.</p>
<p>"If it’s not too much trouble..."</p>
<p>"Nah, it’s fine. I’ll go look what we have."</p>
<p>Newt went out of the room to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Credence swallowed. The offer of food made him happy, however uncomfortable he felt accepting it.</p>
<p>He had heard Newt’s parents once, complaining about "another mouth to feed"; it’s not like Scamanders were particularly rich. They were better off than Credence’s family, but then again - most families were. They never said anything to his face, but he knew they weren’t happy with him. Were he not helping Newt with homework, they’d probably tell him to stay away.</p>
<p>He tried not to eat at Newt’s. But it was too tempting - real food, delicious and hot and full of flavor; not the same bland tasteless mush they had at home. Meat! Fruits, vegetables! After a glass of water for breakfast and a peppermint for lunch, the food Newt was giving him tasted like heaven.</p>
<p>Credence was so, so grateful for this kindness. Even though he knew he didn’t deserve it.</p>
<p>The computer display - flat, bright, expensive, nothing like the old CRT piece of junk Credence had at home - was still on. Newt left the browser open on the dating site page. So much for secrecy... Really, Newt needed to learn to be more careful.</p>
<p>Perhaps, there was no shame in looking... just a bit. It’s not like Credence could visit such websites at home, not when his sisters were in the same room. Or his mother.</p>
<p>Besides, it’s not like he was intruding on something private. All those photos - Tina must have uploaded them somewhere, or where would have Newt got them? And the rest was fake, all the preferences made up.</p>
<p>Credence wondered how many other profiles were fake too. That "intel" Newt was getting, how good was it if it was coming from another boy? What if he was learning what boys liked without realizing it?</p>
<p>The thought made Credence blush again. He looked over his shoulder; Newt was busy in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Credence called. "Do you need help?"</p>
<p>"No, it’s fine!" Newt sounded cheerful, as usual. "I’ll be there in a few minutes!"</p>
<p>Shyly, his heart pounding in his chest, Credence reached for the computer mouse.</p>
<p>"May I look around a bit? As your fake Tina?"</p>
<p>"Sure, mate, knock yourself out!"</p>
<p>With Newt’s permission, Credence clicked on a few buttons. Conversations; all girls, a few older women. Emojis. Giggles, hearts, flowers.</p>
<p>It felt weird. Uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He clicked at the new matches button. More girls... wait, no, there was a man. An older guy, probably in his 30s? Not bad looking though. Actually, kinda good looking, three piece suit and steel grey scarf and stylish undercut. Handsome. Elegant. Not the kind of guy who should be needing a dating website to meet women... oh, his profile says men.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Wait, what’s that sound... A new message!?</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Hey.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Oh, blazes. This guy - he messaged him! Tina, that is, he messaged Tina. What should Credence do? Oh no, he opened the message and now it was marked as "read". No, no, that's not good at all. Credence had no reason to look at that man's profile. Not as Tina, not as himself, not as anyone. How would he explain this to Newt?</p>
<p>It was an accident. Obviously. Just an accident.<br/> <br/> "Newt! Some guy's just messaged you. Tina, that is. I opened it by accident. What should I do?"<br/> <br/> "Huh?" Newt poked his head into the room. "Just tell him you're a lesbian and you'll report him if he doesn't leave you alone... Tea or coffee?"<br/> <br/> "What?" Credence blinked. "Oh, right. Just water, please."<br/> <br/> "What are you talking about, it's boody October! Too cold for water. I'll make you some camomile tea if the caffeine's too much for you."<br/> <br/> Embarrassed by his own attempted modesty - he felt like a fool now, instantly remembering Newt had once told him offering tea was a basic etiquette requirement of a hospitable host back where Newt was raised - Credence nodded.<br/> <br/> "Thanks..."<br/> <br/> Newt flashed him a smile and disappeared back into the kitchen.<br/> <br/> Credence looked back at the screen. Another message.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Tina?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Credence sighed. Then he reached for the keyboard.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “I like girls. I’m not interested in men. I’m a gay lesbian.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Excessive, unnecessary. He couldn’t choose the right words, so he sent them all. Well, at least he was as awkward at texting as he was at talking. Great.</p>
<p>The man, seemingly amused, sent him a laughing emoji.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “So am I. Gay, that is.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>That shouldn’t have surprised him. The man’s profile said as much: Percival Graves, looking for men. Why did his breath hitch, then, and why did a flash of hot blood rush through his stomach up to his chest?</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Why are you messaging a girl if you’re gay for men?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Your profile says you’re looking for friendship. Correct? That’s what I’m looking for, as well. I’m actually new to the scene, just came out recently.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Congratulations?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Thanks. What about you, are you out?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Not really.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Credence paused. Then he thought about Tina, her bright eyes and strong chin. She wasn't afraid of anything. She wouldn't hide.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “My family knows." </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Ah. Well, you seem confident. You probably know a few... safe spaces?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>What. How was he supposed to reply to that.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “No. I don’t go to gay clubs.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “God, same! The music’s too loud, and the alcohol... it’s a problem. How are we supposed to meet if all we have are clubs and bars for casual hookups. It’s hard to just meet a person, you know. A friend.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Credence bit his lip.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Yeah. I don’t have many friends either.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Really? What do you do for fun then?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Pausing again, Credence frowned. Should he reply? Should he tell that man about Tina, or maybe about himself? It would be weird. Why was he even talking to that man... why was that man talking to him? To Tina. If he really was gay, what did he want from a girl? Could he be telling the truth? It's not implausible. Possibly?</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “I can tell. If you promise not to laugh.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Another emoji, a smile. Why does a grown man like emojis so much?</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “OK, Tina. I promise.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “I write poetry.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>There, he said it. Why did he say it? He'd never told anyone, not even Newt. Why did he share his secret with a complete stranger? He should have lied. He should have made up some silly story about this fake gay Tina, to make Mr. Graves lose interest. But then again, this really wasn't a good thing to do. To lie about someone like that. Why was Credence doing this, again? It was Newt's idea, and Credence should have never got involved.<br/> <br/> But... it was kind of fun. Liberating, in an odd way.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Poetry, huh. That’s rare nowadays. Would you mind showing me some of your poems?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Credence looked over to the door. Apparently, Newt was still busy cooking - the dishes clanked, the stove roared.</p>
<p>This was a bad idea.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “I could send you one if you want to. But don’t laugh.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “I gave you a promise, didn’t I?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Yeah, well. It’s not like Credence was going to see the reaction, even if the man did laugh - he was far away. He couldn’t hurt him.</p>
<p>So Credence reached for his bag, took out the special notebook and - letter by letter, one heavy word after another - typed out his last poem. Then he hit "send message".</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p><em>The sun was green and brilliant </em><em>like glass of a broken bottle</em><br/> <em> The desert, dry and red</em><br/> <em> Crumbling brimstone</em><br/> <em> Spread</em><br/> <em> Open like a mammoth’s rib cage</em><br/> <em> Dead.</em><br/> <em> Alive, black smoke at sunrise,</em><br/> <em> Across the sky</em><br/> <em> A ghost</em><br/> <em> A cloud, fumes of sighs and prayers.</em><br/> <em> Soul gone, sky remembers.</em></p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>He wasn’t proud of it. It was nothing, a sketch of colorful words smashed together. Unpolished, no particular idea behind the imagery. No meaning.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “It’s good.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Well then, Percival Graves was a liar.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Raw, but good. I like it.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Credence clutched at his own face. His cheeks were burning.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Actually, Tina, you gave me an idea. There is a place, they’re doing a poetry reading tomorrow. Do you want to come? I’d love to hear you read something.”</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “How do you know I’m not going there already?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Credence swallowed. His hands were shaking. That was too bold, wasn’t it? But this man, he was awfully presumptuous. How could he know Tina wasn’t going to that reading if she liked poetry? She might have organized the event for all he knew. Unless he organized it himself... which was also possible, now that Credence thought about it.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Are you?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Of course not. This conversation was silly and dangerous, and this man, Mr. Graves... he wanted something. Something Credence couldn’t give, because he wasn’t Tina.</p>
<p>Or maybe he could. If Mr. Graves was telling the truth, if he was looking for a friend... not, it was naive to believe that. But if he wasn’t honest, that would mean - he was a predator luring girls to... to do something bad with them.</p>
<p>Either way, Credence should do something.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “I’m thinking about it. Where is that reading of yours happening?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “A café. Don’t worry, I wouldn’t suggest a bad place.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “I’m more worried about the company.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “If you’re scared of me, I could invite my nieces along. I have two, right about your age. Would that make you feel safer?” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>That... seemed too weird to be a lie. The absence of one would be easy to explain - fell ill, changed her mind - but two? It would only add to the suspicion. So inventing two nieces made no sense if the man was lying, right?</p>
<p>Ah, what did it matter. It’s not like Credence could actually go.</p>
<p>"Hey, mate! Who are you talking to?"</p>
<p>Oh, crap. Credence completely forgot about Newt.</p>
<p>"Um. That guy?" Credence spun around in the chair to face Newt, and pointed at the screen. "I've told you he messaged me. Us. You. Tina. I just..."</p>
<p>"Ooh, he wants to meet up?" Newt leaned at the desk, almost pressing his nose against the screen. Then he laughed. "God, what a creep! Say yes."</p>
<p>"What?" Credence gasped, taken aback.</p>
<p>Newt smiled, an embodiment of angelic innocence.</p>
<p>"What? It’ll be fun. Make him wait, feed him excuses until he realizes he’s been stood up."</p>
<p>"Wouldn’t that... make him angry?"</p>
<p>"And what’s he gonna do about it, call the police? Hah!" Newt reached for the keyboard and, before Credence could stop him, typed and sent the message.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “It’s fine! Sure thing, I’ll come. Can’t wait to see you in person! ;p” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>Winky face. Winky, goddamn, face.</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “Excited, huh? Well then, the reading starts at five. See you there.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p>
<p>The address was in the next message. Newt replied with the heart-eyes emoji. Credence was way too terrified to argue.</p>
<p>"Why did you do that..." he whispered finally, as Newt finished the conversation with a "<em> see you ;) </em>" and closed the page. "What if he tracks Tina down, the real Tina? What if he’s a bad guy?"</p>
<p>Newt frowned.</p>
<p>"What, like a pervert? Tina does Krav Maga. She’ll kick his arse."</p>
<p>"What about us? Won’t she be mad at us, too?"</p>
<p>"How would she know?"</p>
<p>True. Still, it felt wrong.</p>
<p>"Come on, mate!" Newt smiled again. "Don’t fret over everything so much, it’s alright. I’ve been doing this for a week, nobody’s going to catch us. Chill, yes? Let’s go eat."</p>
<p>And that was the end of that conversation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next day, Newt went to work at the animal shelter right after school. Apparently, he forgot all about the meeting he set up; he didn’t bring it up, and Credence sure as hell didn’t either.</p>
<p>He went to the café, though. Alone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The closer he was getting to the building, the slower he walked. By the time he reached the entrance, he stopped entirely.</p>
<p>He had no intention of actually speaking with the man, of course. Percival Graves... Was that really his name? Who on earth would name their child Percival? At least, Credence had a religious mother. What was Percival’s excuse? Did his parents read one too many Arthurian legends? Then again, the guy was ancient, like... thirty-five? Older than Credence and Newt combined.</p>
<p>To be honest, Credence wasn’t entirely sure why he’d come. Newt was right, Tina could protect herself; Credence saw her wreck a guy twice her size once. So it wasn’t about her, not really.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it was about poetry - embarrassing or not, finding the right words that stuck together was something that Credence enjoyed. It was like gathering puzzle pieces, or solving a math problem. Finding the rhythm and the rhymes - it made things clear, easy to remember. It helped him stay focused while doing chores.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, Credence was merely curious if the man was real. Really real, or a bad guy in disguise, or a teenage girl wearing someone else’s face. Like Newt’s fake Tina.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, he was there.<br/> <br/> It took him a few minutes to muster the courage, but finally - screaming internally, despite there being no reason to panic yet - he opened the door and stepped inside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr. Graves was already there. He looked older than in the profile photo, with more grey in his hair, but it was definitely him. Credence saw him, clear as day, the moment he walked in.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>This whole affair was ridiculous, Credence realized at once. What was he going to do, come over and say hi? "Sorry, I lied about being a girl?" No, coming here was a terrible idea.</p>
<p>He almost turned back on the spot and fled, but then the man looked up.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, <em> no</em>.</p>
<p>Credence froze. A blast of heat rushed through his head, his face catching fire, his ears ringing. Mr. Graves looked right at him, and their eyes met. Credence knew he should turn around and walk away, but his feet wouldn’t move.</p>
<p>Mr. Graves raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>This was a disaster. Did he figure it out? Did Newt tell him something? No, he wouldn’t. And there was no way a stranger could know Tina’s profile was not hers. There was no way Mr. Graves could have guessed.</p>
<p>Stop staring. Look away, pretend it was an accident, a misunderstanding. Just... act normal, for once.</p>
<p>Yeah. As if he could ever do that.</p>
<p>Looking around nervously, desperate for a way out, he noticed a board full of colorful flyers in the corner. Hurriedly he scooted over there, trying to focus his vision on the labels; but he couldn’t help glancing over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Luckily, Mr. Graves paid him no more attention - he was looking at his phone.</p>
<p>Credence suppressed a sigh. He wasn’t upset or disappointed, but somehow he didn’t feel relieved either. A strange bitter taste was creeping up his throat. It tasted like envy.</p>
<p>Another glance towards the food counter gave Credence a better idea of the place. Small, lunch-oriented, no waiters; there were sweets and desserts, a variety of drinks. All in all, it looked more like a coffee shop than a café.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe TV shows and movies gave Credence the wrong idea. Maybe this was exactly what a café was supposed to look like. It's not like he had a fuck-ton of experience in the matter! (Oh no, he used a naughty word. He mustn't. If Ma heard him swearing, she'd scrub his tongue with soap until he threw up blood.)</p>
<p>Credence walked over to the counter to look at the prices. Expensive. Some of the desserts cost more than a month’s worth of school lunches. He could buy ten packs of peppermints for the price of that muffin! That’s like, two weeks of peppermints.</p>
<p>"One coffee, please. Extra large, no cream, no sugar."</p>
<p>Startled, Credence looked over to the register. Yes, it was Mr. Graves; it looked like he was buying himself another coffee.</p>
<p>"Anything else?" the girl at the register gave Mr. Graves a professional, if a bit tired, smile, to which Mr. Graves responded with polite disinterest.</p>
<p>"No, thank you."</p>
<p>He tipped the girl, too. Credence bit his cheek as he saw the amount of money: it was more than he had in his pocket, and it was just the beginning of the month. He’d be lucky to have a quarter of that sum left by the end of it.</p>
<p>Ma was right. He needed to find a real job already, to pull his own weight.</p>
<p>It was hopeless, wasn’t it? Coming here. He could barely afford a glass of water. And to what end? The place was slowly getting crowded; the small wooden stage in the back of the room was decorated with lights and flowers. People were going to enjoy themselves here, to eat and talk freely. Credence could do neither. He should just leave. He never should have come.</p>
<p>"Having trouble making a decision?"</p>
<p>With a startled gasp, Credence turned around. Did that just happen? Was Mr. Graves talking to him?</p>
<p>Apparently, he was, as he was standing in front of Credence with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Credence managed to say.</p>
<p>"I wouldn’t blame you." Mr. Graves smiled again. He had good teeth. "Everything here looks delicious."</p>
<p>"Ah..." Credence quickly glanced back at the food display. "Yes. It does."</p>
<p>"You should go for a strawberry tart. They’re the best in the city." Mr. Graves took a sip of his coffee. "I’d go for it myself, but the doctor said I should watch my sugar."</p>
<p>"Oh. I’m sorry to hear that, sir."</p>
<p>"Percival Graves," the man offered him a hand, and for a second Credence was utterly confused. Then he realized he was supposed to shake it.</p>
<p>"Oh! Um," he grabbed the outreached hand and shook it hurriedly, cursing at himself for starting every sentence with a loud intake of breath. Mr. Graves had probably thought he was a dimwit of some kind. "I’m, uh. My name is Credence."</p>
<p>Why did he give out his real name to that man, again? Wasn’t he supposed to stay away from him?</p>
<p>"Hello, Credence," Mr. Graves took another sip of coffee. Credence licked his lips half-consciously; he felt thirsty. "Are you here for a quick snack, or for the reading?"</p>
<p>"The reading?" Credence breathed out, barely able to hear himself. "What reading?"</p>
<p>"Why, the poems, of course. Didn’t you see the flyer? They’re having an amateur poetry event tonight. Anyone can participate."</p>
<p>Credence laughed nervously.</p>
<p>"Hah. No, I had no idea." God, he was so bad at this. "Are you here for that? To read a poem?"</p>
<p>"No, I’m supposed to meet someone." Mr. Graves glanced at his wrist watch. "They seem to be running late, though."</p>
<p>"Maybe you missed them?" Credence offered.</p>
<p>"I hope not. I’d really like to meet that person."</p>
<p>Well, wasn’t that just wonderful.</p>
<p>"Maybe you saw her on your way here?" Mr. Graves prompted suddenly. "Young woman, pale, short dark hair. Most likely wearing a navy blue coat."</p>
<p>"No, sorry, I don’t look at women much." That... sounded better in his head. "I didn’t see anyone."</p>
<p>"Huh. I guess I’ll just keep waiting." Mr. Graves looked away. "I’m not so sure she’s going to show up, though. Want to keep me company for a while, Credence? I don’t like to eat alone."</p>
<p>That’s... Why? Did he suspect something? He had no reason to, did he? Credence might have been acting nervously, but it’s natural to be nervous around strangers, and there was no connection between Credence and Tina. There was no way Mr. Graves could have figured him out, right? No way.</p>
<p>"I was just leaving, actually. I only wanted... I have to go home. Soon. I have homework."</p>
<p>"That’s okay." Mr. Graves smiled. "You don’t have to sit with me if you don’t want to. I would appreciate the company, but it’s up to you, of course."</p>
<p>Credence hesitated.</p>
<p>"I... guess I could stay for a few minutes."</p>
<p>"That’s very kind of you." Mr. Graves nodded - in gratitude, in approval? Credence had to look away; something warm stirred in his chest. "Say, since you’re doing me a favor by sticking around, could I buy you a coffee? Or something else? It only seems fair."</p>
<p>Credence shook his head, forcing a smile.</p>
<p>"It really isn’t necessary, Mr. Graves."</p>
<p>"Are you certain? You look a little pale. I don’t want you to faint on me."</p>
<p>The sweet pastries in the food display looked tempting. Credence bit his lip.</p>
<p>"If... if you feel that you have to. Then yes. Okay," he whispered, half-hoping Mr. Graves wouldn’t hear him over the background noise.</p>
<p>But he did.</p>
<p>"A latte, then? And a strawberry tart?"</p>
<p>Credence nodded, daring not to look Mr. Graves in the eyes. The man was too nice to him. Why? It made no sense. From his point of view, Credence was a complete stranger. Was he really that desperate for a friendly ear?</p>
<p>Not that Credence was particularly friendly. If anything, he must have appeared reluctant, thanks to his awkward manner. Maybe he should relax a little? Thank the nice man for the treat.</p>
<p>"Here." Mr. Graves presented him with the freshly bought goodies. "Now, where shall we sit? Looks like all the good tables are busy, but that one in the corner doesn’t seem half-bad. A bit dark, but it’s better than being in the spotlight. You agree?"</p>
<p>They walked to the table in the corner. The cashier’s eyes followed them, a little wary; she must have been worried about an older guy harassing him, Credence realized. He gave her a reassuring smile, and she eased up at once, her gaze shooting straight back to the tips jar. There were a few bills and plenty of coins. Credence swallowed an envious sigh.</p>
<p>The table in the corner was small and dim-lit, just as Mr. Graves said. It wasn’t bad, though; in fact, they could see the scene quite well while staying in the shadows - convenient, if only a little unnerving. Credence was starting to relax, though. So far, Mr. Graves seemed a polite and charming man; admittedly, it was a little strange that a handsome, successfully well-off person like him would be lonely enough to seek the company of strangers, but then again - he said he was gay. That could explain a lot.</p>
<p>They sat down.</p>
<p>"Eat, please," Mr. Graves said. "I promise I’m not trying to roofie you."</p>
<p>"Would you tell me if you did?" Credence snickered.</p>
<p>"Good point. Would you feel safer if I had a bite first?"</p>
<p>Credence considered the suggestion.</p>
<p>"What about your sugar?"</p>
<p>"A single bite won’t hurt," Mr. Graves shrugged. "It’s not like I can’t have <em> any</em>. I just have to be careful."</p>
<p>"And this is being careful?" Credence raised an eyebrow. "What if I’m trying to roofie you?"</p>
<p>Mr. Graves chuckled.</p>
<p>"It’s a possibility, I have to admit. It would be a pretty elaborate scheme, and unreliable at that, but it’s not impossible."</p>
<p>They looked each other in the eyes.</p>
<p>"So?" Mr. Graves smiled. "What will it be, Credence?"</p>
<p>In a bout of sudden bravery, Credence grabbed a spoon and, without breaking eye contact, took a spoonful of the tart. Mr. Graves watched him, amused, as Credence brought the spoon to his mouth. He would have kept at it, but... the aroma was heavenly and the tart was delicious. He had to close his eyes.</p>
<p>And just like that, the spell was broken. At once, Credence felt like a fool, ashamed of his own actions.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Graves." he said quietly. "This is very good."</p>
<p>"The best in the city, I told you," Mr. Graves replied.</p>
<p>He didn’t sound angry or disgusted or anything. Credence risked looking at him again - and was startled by the intensity of the gaze Mr. Graves was studying him with. He blinked, and the next moment Mr. Graves relaxed, leaning back in his seat.</p>
<p>"So, Credence. You said you had homework. Are you in college?"</p>
<p>Aaand there they began. The awkward questions.</p>
<p>"High school. I’m a senior. I’ll be eighteen next month."</p>
<p>"Still a minor, then."</p>
<p>Was there a good reply to that? If there was, Credence didn’t know any.</p>
<p>"Do you like poetry, Credence?"</p>
<p>That was even worse. A dangerous question. How could he reply without lying or incriminating himself?</p>
<p>"It’s alright. Some of it."</p>
<p>"Some? Yours?"</p>
<p>"No!" Credence felt hot like a peeled potato chunk in a frying pan full of boiling oil. "I’m not a poet. I’ve never written anything good."</p>
<p>"But you have written something."</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>"I..." he didn’t like lying. He wasn’t good at it. "Everyone tries it some time. I’m nothing special."</p>
<p>"Oh, but I think you are. You are a very special boy, Credence."</p>
<p>Despite his best efforts to keep his composure, Credence took a sharp inhale of breath. Why would Mr. Graves say that? Not even the math teacher praised him like that.</p>
<p>"I don’t think you’re here for a quick snack, or by accident." Mr. Graves looked at him intently. "You’re here for the reading, aren’t you?"</p>
<p>"No..." Credence stared at his half-finished strawberry tart. God, it was so good. Mr. Graves was so good and generous and Credence felt terrible lying to him. "I... I was meeting someone, too. But he didn’t come."</p>
<p>"He?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my friend - classmate. We were going to do homework together." Phew. A plausible explanation, finally. "I help him with math, he helps me with literature. But he had, um. An urgent business to attend to. So."</p>
<p>"So you still need help. Could I, perchance, be of service?"</p>
<p>"What?" Credence stared at Mr. Graves who looked back at him, ready and earnest. "No, it’s fine. We have an essay due this week, I just need him to read it through."</p>
<p>"An essay? On what topic?"</p>
<p>"A novel. Any novel. Free form. It’s fine, really."</p>
<p>"Well, if you’re certain."</p>
<p>They fell silent for a moment. Mr. Graves sipped his coffee. Credence used the pause to wolf down the rest of the tart.</p>
<p>"Say... What color is brimstone?" Mr. Graves asked. He was looking at the stage, not at Credence; following his gaze, Credence saw a blond-haired girl climbing the stairs to reach the mic at the center of the stage.</p>
<p>"Uh..." Credence frowned. "Brick-red? Reddish brown?"</p>
<p>"No, Credence." Mr. Graves’s gaze snapped back to Credence, his eyes suddenly heavy. "It’s really not."</p>
<p>Credence gasped in realization, but it was too late. He wanted to run, but Mr. Graves grabbed his wrist.</p>
<p>"Sit. We’re not finished here."</p>
<p>Biting his lip, Credence followed the command. He dared not look up.</p>
<p>"You’re one of Tina’s classmates, aren’t you? I recognized your face from the yearbook photographs."</p>
<p>Oh. <em> Oh</em>.</p>
<p>"You’re not Tina’s father, are you?" Credence whispered, mortified.</p>
<p>"No. I wouldn’t lie about my name."</p>
<p>Credence sighed in relief.</p>
<p>"I’m Tina’s uncle."</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry! I’m so sorry, sir, I’m..."</p>
<p>"Quiet, you little punk," the grip on his wrist squeezed tighter. Credence trembled. "Now, tell me. Whose idea was that? Using my niece, her name, her photos - did you come up with that?"</p>
<p>"No! No, I’m sorry, please..."</p>
<p>"Do you even understand what you’re doing? Telling people she’s a lesbian! You could be ruining her life."</p>
<p>Credence sniffled.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry. I’m so sorry."</p>
<p>"So you keep saying." Mr. Graves relaxed his grip a little, but his hand was still on top of Credence’s. "Don’t get me wrong, boy. There’s nothing bad about being a lesbian, but the truth is - Tina likes boys. And even if she was gay, outing people without their permission... it’s not good."</p>
<p>"I know. I’m so sorry."</p>
<p>"Credence," suddenly, the hand on his wrist became gentle. More than a touch; a caress. "Look at me."</p>
<p>Still shivering, Credence looked up.</p>
<p>"You’re not a bad person. I can see that." Mr. Graves was frowning slightly, all kindness and patience and concern. "Why did you do such a thing? To one of your friends, no less."</p>
<p>Friends. Right.</p>
<p>"Tina is not my friend. And I didn’t do it."</p>
<p>"It was your poem yesterday."</p>
<p>"Yes. I sent you that," confessing the truth was easy. And pleasant, somehow, even though he knew he was in trouble. "But I didn’t create the fake profile."</p>
<p>"Then who did?"</p>
<p>"I can’t tell you. I promised not to tell anyone."</p>
<p>"Credence..." Mr. Graves sighed. A fingernail scraped softly against the pulsing vein on Credence’s wrist; Credence held back another gasp. It was probably supposed to be intimidating. But it wasn’t. In a strange way, actually, it felt kind of nice.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry, sir. Please, I really can’t tell," Credence was ready to beg.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mr. Graves gave in.</p>
<p>"Very well. I don’t care who started it, or why. Was it a prank, or your way of meeting girls... I don’t care. I only care about my niece. So, this has to end. I need you to delete that profile, Credence."</p>
<p>Credence swallowed.</p>
<p>"I... can’t do that. It’s not mine."</p>
<p>"If you have enough access to chat under it, you have enough access to delete it." Mr. Graves caressed his wrist again, and Credence let out a shaky breath. "You wouldn’t want Tina to find out about this, would you?"</p>
<p>"N...no."</p>
<p>"Good. Frankly, me neither. I don’t want her to have trust issues, even if, perhaps, it would be wiser to be paranoid these days." Mr. Graves smiled with a hint of bitterness. "So let’s make a deal. You delete the profile and tell your friend, or whoever, to never use my niece’s name or face again. As long as everything is promptly deleted, I don’t make a fuss about it, and Tina never learns of your exploits. Sounds good to you, Credence?"</p>
<p>He sighed. How did he get into this mess, again? He should have never poked about on Newt’s computer. Better yet, he should have told Newt to delete the cursed fake as soon as he’d learned of its existence.</p>
<p>"Yes. Thank you, sir."</p>
<p>"Splendid." Mr. Graves nodded. "Now, Credence, would you mind giving me your phone?"</p>
<p>"My phone?" Credence flinched. "Sir, please, my mother would kill me if I lost it!"</p>
<p>"Jesus, boy," Mr. Graves winced, as if the suggestion gave him a toothache. "Not your actual phone. I’m asking for your number. So you could call me when you’re done, or I could call you - in case you happen to forget about this conversation."</p>
<p>"I won’t forget," Credence promised.</p>
<p>"Regardless, I’d like a means of contacting you." Mr. Graves gave him a meaningful look. "Just in case."</p>
<p>Credence reached for the phone in his pocket. It was an old model, cheap and heavy like a brick. It worked without fail, though.</p>
<p>"Here," he highlighted the line in the contacts list. "This is mine."</p>
<p>Mr. Graves swiftly copied the number into his big, modern phone. Credence felt a momentary pang of envy in his throat as he watched; the phone looked like a piece of smooth black glass, stylish and beautiful, nothing alike with Credence’s monstrosity. It suited Mr. Graves, his suit and his cologne and his perfect smile.</p>
<p>Credence sighed wistfully. Maybe, one day he would earn enough money for a new phone too.</p>
<p>Mr. Graves called him on the spot to make certain he got the right number. Then he nodded, satisfied, and hid the sleek phone in a pocket, returning Credence’s back to him.</p>
<p>"Well then." As soon as that was dealt with, Mr. Graves looked at Credence with a renewed interest. "Now that this is out of the way... Would you like to stay for the reading, Credence? I’m afraid, yesterday I twisted the truth a little. It’s actually scheduled to start at six."</p>
<p>Credence blinked. What?</p>
<p>"Do you... want me to?"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn’t I?" Mr. Graves gave him a puzzled look. "Or did you lie about liking poetry, too?"</p>
<p>"No. I do like it."</p>
<p>"Then stay. Listen, learn. Exchanging ideas with other creators can be helpful when you search for inspiration."</p>
<p>Credence frowned.</p>
<p>"What makes you think I’m searching for anything?"</p>
<p>"You’re a poet." Mr. Graves waved his hand, as if it explained everything. "And not a bad one, at that. You have some growth to do, sure, but if that poem you showed me is anything to judge by... you can become good. Quite good, in fact. You just need to find your voice."</p>
<p>"My... voice."</p>
<p>"Something you truly care about. Something you can scream till you’re hoarse about. Something that keeps you up at night, something you can’t get out of your head. Something special. Something that is you."</p>
<p>Special. Did Mr. Graves really think Credence could be... all that? Was he just trying to get on his good side to ensure the fake profile was safely deleted?</p>
<p>In the end, Credence realized, it didn’t matter. So long as Mr. Graves smiled at him, gentle and warm and intelligent, all attention focused on Credence... so long as they could talk like that, about things Credence couldn’t tell even Newt...</p>
<p>He didn’t care how true, if at all, any of it was.</p>
<p>"I’ll stay."</p>
<p>Mr. Graves smiled at him.</p>
<p>"Not all of it is going to be good." He warned.</p>
<p>"Can’t be much worse than mine. Isn’t all poetry pompous and arrogant, anyway?"</p>
<p>"I thought you liked it."</p>
<p>"I do. Not because of that." Credence struggled to explain. "I just like putting words together. It doesn’t mean I’m any good. But it’s something to do when there’s nothing else, you know... you need paper and pens to be an artist, fabric and needles for sewing or knitting, wood and tools for crafting. What you make depends on the quality of your materials. But with words, it only depends on your skill. It’s only as good as you make it. And you can do it anywhere, anytime, without anyone knowing. Things can be taken away, but not words. Not thoughts."</p>
<p>Mr. Graves listened without interruptions. Finally, when Credence finished his speech, he nodded.</p>
<p>"I see. It gives you freedom."</p>
<p>"Freedom." Credence pondered the idea. "I didn’t think about it like that. It’s just... something to do."</p>
<p>"When you have nothing else." Mr. Graves echoed his words. "Does it happen often, people taking things from you?"</p>
<p>"No. It’s not like I have much to begin with." he let out a small self-deprecating laugh. "I wouldn’t want people to know, though. About this, um, poetry thing."</p>
<p>"You’re afraid they’d laugh at you, hurt you?"</p>
<p>"I want to have my own thing. Something that’s just mine."</p>
<p>"But you told me about it."</p>
<p>Credence shrugged.</p>
<p>"I guess. I wouldn’t have if I was planning on actually meeting you face to face."</p>
<p>Mr. Graves raised his eyebrows. It surprised Credence too, telling the truth like that. The words just slipped out, and now there was no way back.</p>
<p>"I see, it’s easier for you to share with strangers. No expectations, no pressure." Mr. Graves tapped against the desk. "But why did you come here, Credence? If you weren’t going to give me the courtesy of telling anything resembling the truth?"</p>
<p>The words stung. Credence deserved it, though, he supposed, for what they did.</p>
<p>"You didn’t have to come." Mr. Graves looked at him, bemused. "Yet here you are."</p>
<p>"I..." Credence looked away. It was too embarrassing to admit. "I wanted to know if you were real."</p>
<p>"Huh. I appreciate the honesty."</p>
<p>Mr. Graves leaned back in his chair. Credence traced the exposed waistcoat with his eyes. Good fabric, great fit. Custom-made, probably, not store-bought. Or did Mr. Graves had such a good body anything would look good on him?</p>
<p>Credence sighed wistfully. Someday he’s going to buy a custom tailored suit, too. Someday...</p>
<p>"They’re about to begin." Mr. Graves nodded towards the scene. "Do you want another latte?"</p>
<p>"No, thanks. I’m good."</p>
<p>That earned him an amused chuckle.</p>
<p>"Yes, Credence. You are."</p>
<p><br/> <br/> He went home at seven thirty that evening. Neither he nor Mr. Graves read anything, and Credence couldn’t remember a single poem that was read.</p>
<p>And even though he knew he was in trouble, for some reason he felt... not quite happy, but. Not unhappy either. He felt warm, and the taste of coffee and strawberries lingered on his tongue.</p>
