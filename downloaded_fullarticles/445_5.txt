</p><p>
  <span>The clenching rush of apparition fades quickly from Draco’s insides after his feet land heavily on the dragon-patterned foyer rug of Malfoy Manor. Without pausing to face him, his mother hurries away down the hall, unknotting her plush scarf and tossing it toward a hook on the wall, which stretches out gracefully to catch it. As she turns a corner and disappears, the only sign she was ever beside him are two snowy shoeprints, melting and nearly invisible. Sighing, Draco shoulders off his damp coat and throws it upon the nearest piece of furniture on the way to his mother’s office. She is just sending one of their owls from an open window when he saunters in, ink well still open on the mahogany desk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mother,” he begins.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is nothing I’d like to hear from you other than regretful silence,” she returns, the cold words coming out smooth and sharp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, please. I’m not a child, you can’t -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’re not a child,” she says, meeting his eyes for the first time since he had been ushered in to see the headmaster, “then I suggest you cease behaving like one. Furthermore, I’ll assume you were </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> about to dictate what I can and cannot do, seeing as I am your parent. A fact I’ve taken little pride in recently.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Father had been there -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you dare.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mother, I -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enough!” Tears now glistening in her eyes, she sucks in a breath and slowly paces toward her son. “You have wasted your final chance. With over twenty student complaints accumulated in two years, I doubted Stellvadour Academy would grant you admission, pulled strings or not. It took you less than a month to get expelled! That must be your quickest expulsion of the four!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seem impressed.” Draco smirks, crossing his arms. He notices the flash of pain on her face, the disappointed fold of her elegant shoulders. Waiting for her to scold him, wanting a reaction, he stares defiantly into her confused eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, his mother presses graceful and quivering fingertips to her frown, staring back in return, searching. After an elongated moment, she reaches out and smooths a thumb over his cheekbone. She smiles sadly with a tilt of her head, and leaves him alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck,” Draco breathes, the tension he’s been holding for hours finally breaking. He catches himself against the desk when his knees weaken. Refusing to allow the prickling tears to fall, he squeezes his eyes shut and tries to quiet the echoes in his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Unforgivable. Delinquent. Hateful. Shocking. Destructive. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“FUCK!” Draco roars, snatching a glass snake sculpture and pitching it across the room, sending shards everywhere. Now, it’s too late, and tears run unstoppable, dripping onto the polished wood between his hands. The satisfaction of arguing he once relished never comes anymore, only this dull, empty ache and instant guilt. With time, Draco’s breathing slows and his mind quiets. Wiping his tears from the desk with a sleeve, he rushes out of the study and up to his bedroom. Shattered glass remains, glittering against the dark stone floor like stars among sky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hours later, Draco is tensely resting by his fireplace, sipping from a large mug of tea mixed with a rather generous splash of firewhiskey from his mother’s “secret” stash. The screech of an owl pierces through the frozen silence outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Must be a reply to that letter she sent when we arrived home.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>In a distant room, ancient window hinges squeak open and his mother’s friendly thanks to the owl echo faintly. A knock at Draco’s door comes less than a minute later. Startled, he hurriedly gulps down the rest of his spiked tea and spells the mug clean.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes?” Draco nearly croaks, his throat still burning pleasantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quietly, his mother enters and settles stiffly into another ornate armchair nearby. Folding the recently arrived letter open and closed in her hands, she sighs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco, darling. I know you don’t like to talk to me about… well, about much these days. So I won’t ask you to. Instead, I’ll simply tell you what I’ve decided, and I hope you’ll be happy with the compromise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>A compromise I didn’t have the opportunity to negotiate? Sounds fair…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s clear you have trouble respecting adults, especially those in an academic setting,” she says, “and frankly, there isn’t a single school of magic that would now accept a seventeen-year-old student with your… in your situation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So I don’t have to finish school?” Draco interrupts, the liquor making him giggle at his own hopeful joke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” she replies firmly, her annoyance clear, “I’ve found you a tutor. He has just received his teaching certification early, and by what I’ve heard, he is as bright as they come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco scoffs. “Honestly, I don’t -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He will be here Monday morning at 9 o’clock.” Her word is final, as is the intentionally loud closing of Draco’s bedroom door when she leaves. He flinches, and his closed eyes release a fresh rush of intoxication. Neck softened by the liquor, he suddenly finds his head lolling back. Plushness cradles the nape of his neck. The comfort seems like a fantasy after such a tense, embarrassing, and disappointing day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s mind wanders, and the cushion against his skin becomes a careful palm. Phantom fingertips slide through his hair, bringing on a pleasant shiver. When his head rolls to the side slightly, pressure against his jaw is a firm thumb. Rough fabric there: the calloused skin of skillful, mature hands. The perception makes Draco gasp, this sudden fantasy fueled by the firewhiskey now coursing quickly in his pulse. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The hand grasping his neck flexes, fingernails scraping against his scalp. Heat spreads across the side of his neck, where a hot breath is released beneath that firm thumb. Teeth, now, playful and sure, pricking the most sensitive skin. Draco arches up, and an arm fills the empty space behind his back. Clamping solidly nearly all the way around his waist, he lets go into the strength. The biting mouth raises on a hot exhale. Draco holds onto the chair, tension ringing, lips parted and soft and waiting. At last, relieving his hunger, soft lips open against his own, taking control immediately. Draco groans at the satisfaction tumbling through him. He’s consumed, trapped perfectly in a capable embrace. A pleading whine echoes from him when the cruel scratch of stubble burns his cheek…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, fuck! No, what?!” Draco shakes himself to alertness and stands up. Was he just fantasizing about bloody </span>
  <em>
    <span>beard burn</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Unconsciously raising a hand to his mouth, he can still feel it there, the delicious scrape creating heat. Draco rolls his eyes at himself and quickly pulls his hand away, willing the fantasy to disappear. His body, however, has a different idea. Firewhiskey and arousal still filling his veins, the prickling need in his gut and accompanying erection is impossible to ignore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Draco whispers to himself, “fine, but I’m not thinking of anything.” With that weak self-reassurance, he strips down to his silk boxers and slides between cool bed sheets. After a deep breath to clear his mind, Draco lets one hand spread flat against his belly. The other plays at his waistband, then skims over the fabric, tracing himself through the silk.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You fucking tease,” Draco says, his fingers gripped tightly in soft hair. The tongue torturing him disappears, and a laugh makes warm air tease across him instead.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, oh, god…” Lost in the sweet agony, Draco hardly realizes his mind had wandered. When he does, he shakes his head and focuses on the feeling instead. Better to just get this over with, then. He slips his hand inside and gasps at the chilly touch. Wishing he’d left his wand nearer for a warming charm, he ignores it and wraps a hand around his throbbing cock. The hand against his belly flexes, pressing down as the other starts pumping. Comfortable in his solitude, Draco groans and throws his head back when a spike of pleasure cuts deep. Moving faster, he chases the intensity of his earlier fantasy. It’s not the same, he can tell there’s more, something missing. Experimenting with longer strokes and then focusing on the head, he whines at the pleasure, but an ache remains. When his other hand, still flat below his navel, slips further and further downward, something happens. Fresh arousal courses over his skin, the hand on his cock speeding up automatically. The curious fingertips had stopped just barely behind his balls. Swallowing thickly, Draco squeezes his eyes shut and can feel an orgasm accelerating upward. He carefully moves those fingers, spreading his knees to make room.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He spreads his knees to make room, confident fingers sliding further back. “I’ve never done anything like this before,” Draco blurts out. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The man laying between his legs smiles, mouth pressed against his hip. He brings his dark gaze to meet Draco’s and brushes two fingers against his hole.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shit! Oh, my fucking god…” Nearly painful in its brightness, an orgasm tears Draco apart, stealing his breath. Exquisite heat crashes in waves, tightening and releasing for what feels like an eternity. Hips raised, Draco shakes until the pleasure fades enough for him to open his eyes again. After catching his breath, heart still thumping in his ears, embarrassment floods in. He notices the obscene spread of his legs, so wide his hips ache with the strain. Quickly, he pulls his hands away from himself and turns onto his side, twisting his ankles together. Cold shame wrapping faster around his chest, Draco buries his head under a pillow and clenches his jaw.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This is not good.</span>
