  <span>We're in too deep, so let go of my hand.<br/>
Can't you see, you mess with my head just because you can?</span>

  <span>"You know we can't keep doing this, Malfoy," Hermione whispered. They were in a secluded area of the library — her haven from her friends when she just needed her time alone to read. Now it was their secret meeting place after curfew. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"How many times have you actually said that, Granger?" He moved closer, prompting her to step back. His fingers were tracing patterns on her exposed flesh, stirring that familiar ache in her belly. "And yet here you are, coming back for more."</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Hermione bit back a moan when Malfoy licked the whorl of her ear, stirring her desire awake. As his tongue slowly made its way down her neck, she gave up all pretense and clutched his back to pull his body closer to hers.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>This was supposed to be a one-time thing. She just wanted to experience what she’d witnessed him doing to another Ravenclaw during one of her rounds. The girl was half-naked, writhing in obvious pleasure as the blond fucked her to the wall. Hermione was not a voyeur by nature, and yet that scene pinned her to where she was hiding, her knickers undeniably wet.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>She tried to forget about the wanton display. This was Malfoy — their trio's sworn school enemy and also a notorious ladies’ man — she had no business fantasising about him, really. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione really tried hard to forget him and yet, no matter what she did, her dreams were constantly plagued by that same scene — one where it was her body pinned to the wall being ravished by Draco Malfoy. Unable to bear the need, she came up with a proposition that would be beneficial for them both — a tumble in the sheets with no strings attached, and a promise that she would try her best to keep her friends away from his path. It was crazy and she never thought he would agree, but now here they were. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>They had shagged like bunnies almost every night for more than two months now — blinded by the insatiable lust. Their eyes would meet while walking along a corridor one minute, and the next they’d be snogging in a broom closet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>She never deigned to bring it up for fear of what it might mean, but Hermione was well aware that Malfoy hadn’t been with another girl since they started doing whatever it was they were doing. In fact, considering how often they met for their nightly trysts, Ron and Harry had started to wonder why she didn’t visit Gryffindor tower as often anymore. She brushed it off and made excuses about her duties. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>A bite on her nipple brought her back to the present. She hadn’t noticed her Oxford had been parted, or that Malfoy's head was latched to her right breast, flicking it with his tongue after that stinging bite. Half of her bum leaned heavily on the table, her legs parted to accommodate his body. He stopped his ministrations, lifted her up and deposited her on the table. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>"Lie down, Granger, and stop thinking — I can hear your thoughts from here.  I've been dreaming about this cunt all day, and I want you to feel just how much I missed it. I can't wait to fuck you again." </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span></span><br/>
<span>Not a moment after she obeyed him, Malfoy hiked up her skirt. The growl that clawed its way out of his throat upon seeing her made Hermione laugh. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>"Traipsing around the castle with no knickers, Granger? My, what a naughty Head Girl! They will never know though, yeah? This—" his finger traced her folds, grey pools focussed on her amber ones, "—is mine."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy's thumb rubbed her clit gently while his middle finger, followed by another one, slid in and out of her core. He fueled her thirst like no other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy, please,” she moaned helplessly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As if understanding her plea, his tongue replaced his thumb, circling her clit, sucking it like a man dying of thirst. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His fingers were relentless, playing her body like a fiddle and slowly working her up to a peak. Her walls gripped his fingers and Hermione could feel she was about to shatter from the immense pleasure she felt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That's it, Granger, come for me, love.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The endearment he’d never used before and his continued assault on her body pushed her over the edge — heat spreading like wildfire through her veins. She muffled her cry of release with her hand and sagged on the table, basking in the bliss of an orgasm only he could coax from her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Granger, I'm not done with you yet,” Malfoy smirked, “After this, I doubt you'd be able to hold back a scream.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Quickly unbuckling his belt, he dropped his trousers and underwear. His cock was standing to attention, the head glistening with fluid. Malfoy dragged Hermione’s hips to the edge of the table, his left arm hiked her left leg up while his right hand aligned the tip of his cock to her opening, eager to be inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He entered her in one thrust — her previous orgasm leaving her slick, pliant, and ready for him. Fuck, it was glorious! Being filled and stretched by Malfoy like this was enough reason to keep coming back for more. He roused an unquenchable hunger that she’d never felt before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck — oh, please don't stop, Malfoy,” Hermione mumbled, delirious and uncaring of their surroundings as he drove his cock into her, his hips undulating, hitting that spot that she couldn't reach with her fingers. She could feel another orgasm being ripped out of her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy must have noticed for he grazed her clit over and over. His thrusts were faster, more uneven and when she came again — screaming as he predicted — he followed soon after. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To Hermione's surprise, instead of slipping out of her, casting a Scourgify and leaving without so much as a by your leave like he usually did, Malfoy gathered her in his arms, cupped her cheek and kissed her thoroughly — leaving her breathless and confused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was still ruminating on this new development when she felt him slip out of her and righting himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh, so it wasn’t different</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She was just being silly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He helped her dress, cleaned her up with his wand, and pressed a chaste kiss on her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was… odd. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she could breathe another word, Malfoy marched towards the entrance of the library. He was but a few steps away when he stopped with his back to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Same time tomorrow, love,” he said, and continued walking away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stood frozen, slack-jawed and utterly baffled. She… she did not mishear the endearment. Merlin! Hermione thought he uttered it in the heat of the moment. And the way he cared for her after — just what was the git playing at?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she recovered enough to talk his ear off, Malfoy was nowhere in sight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She ran.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She ran, running towards the dungeons as fast as she could, catching sight of him at the bottom of the main staircase.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Malfoy, wait!”</span>
  </em>
