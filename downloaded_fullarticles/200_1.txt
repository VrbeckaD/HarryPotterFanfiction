          <div class="userstuff"><p>“You’re in my way” Andromeda blurted out disrupting the silence.</p><p>Ted startled and looked around himself awkwardly. “I can move-”</p><p>“No, no!

Andromeda found herself fixating on the patterns on it.</p><p>“Figuratively?” He was smiling but his voice and eyes were both deadly serious.</p><p>“Mm” Was all she could reply, shuffling her feet and avoiding looking directly at him, her lips pursed tightly shut. She wished this churning feeling inside her would just leave her alone.</p><p>“Well… how can I help?” Came his reply. He seemed to open in that moment. Like she could throw anything at him and he’d catch it, catch her, or at very least try. He genuinely wanted to help her, to know her problems. There was this tiny little crease between his eyebrows that just reeked of genuine concern and empathy. How did he do that? How did he just lay it all out like that? How did he show how he felt and still seem strong? She just couldn’t seem to get the knack for it.</p><p>“It’s fine, really. This is fine” Andromeda brushed him off with a deep sigh. It was all she knew how to do. Even if her mind was an on fire tornado. <em>This is fine</em>.</p></div>
