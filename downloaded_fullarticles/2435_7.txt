  <span>“Bellatrix, where are we going?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Muddy is very impatient today, aren’t we?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I agreed to go out with you after you got pardoned yesterday, I didn’t agree to apparating blindly and doing Merlin knows what.” I pouted, sticking out my lower lip, hoping Bellatrix would take pity on me. “Can you at least take the blindfold off, so I don’t make a fool of myself.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Blindfolds have never stopped you from making a fool of yourself in the past, pet,” Bellatrix cackled, but at least she took my blindfold off. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why are we in Muggle London, Bella?” This day was getting more confusing by the second. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve done a lot of questionable, fun things in my life and the other witches and wizards are hellbent on holding that against me. But, now that I’m a legal woman, all I want to do is spend time outside of the Manor with you, little pet. I wanted this night to be a night to thank you for saving me from Azkaban.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>We turned the corner and we were in front of a very non-descript restaurant called the Griffin.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What is this place,” I wondered out loud, hoping Bellatrix knew what she was doing, as the people coming out looked rather seedy. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nymphadora recommended it for us, she said it was a good muggle place to get a quiet dinner.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I knew that anything Nymphadora recommended was going to end in a headache for me and as we walked in, my hunch was proven correct. We were greeted by blinding neon lights and...boobs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bellatrix Black, what the fuck?!?!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s wrong, pet?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re in a strip club! You said we were going to get a quiet dinner!” My face was turning as red as Ron’s hair and Bellatrix was looking around unfazed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix turned back to me and asked, “what’s a strip club?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Merlin, these women strip for money and dance up on that stage, Bella.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix leaned close to me and whispered into the shell of my ear, “I promise we’ll get a nice dinner in a few minutes I have to try something first.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She moved her hands down my body and squeezed my ass before running up the stairs to the stage. The last thing I saw was blackness as her skirt hit me in the face.</span>
