    <p>Hermione trudged along the corridors of Hogwarts. So many people were dying, she knew of Remus's death. He died a heroic and beautiful death. Hermione saw many others die to.</p><p>Fred, Tonks, Alastor, and all so many more.</p><p>Hermione had a tight and disgusting feeling settling in her stomach. Guilt. She was given patrol duty. </p><p>She had to make sure no more death eaters got into the castle, and watch over the young students that were hidden away in Hogwarts.</p><p>She felt terribly guilty. Whilst everyone was out there, risking their lives, she was here, perfectly safe.</p><p>"We need you to make sure others are safe first, before you put yourself in danger" Harry had told her.</p><p>Hermione kicked a small rock that she came by, how unfair of him. Why does he get to risk his own life, and she doesn't? She sighed, she wished there was a way to fix all of this. Be able to have stopped this war long before it started.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Hermione's eyes widened at the sound.</p><p>Glancing down the long cracked halls of Hogwarts age could see a lime green light bouncing off the walls.</p><p>Hermione ran to the source of it, stopping in her tracks as she spotted the deathly sight.</p><p>Seven death eaters. Seven fucking death eaters.</p><p>Hermione raised her wand, taking a step back as she did so.</p><p>"Well... If it isn't the dirty mud blood," one of them cackled, their voice low and daring.</p><p>Hermione held her wand to him, making sure she was standing tall.</p><p>"Brave little girl, ain't she?" One of them laughed.</p><p>"Oh, very!" One replied.</p><p>Hermione stood still, her face refusing to show traces of fear, even if that's what she really felt.</p><p>The death eaters laughed mockingly at her.</p><p>"Expelliarmus!" Hermione yelled, pointing at the death eater whose wand was aimed highest.</p><p>"you'll pay for that, girly," he growled.</p><p>It was then that Hermione found the painful sensation of dozens of curses hitting her.</p><p>Needles in her legs, her arms on fire, slouching charms on her face.</p><p>Hermione was terrified. Didn't they know why could happen from mixing such dark spells?! </p><p>People have disappeared from time and space, others have been erased from peoples memory, some become distorted with no way back to their original selves.</p><p>Hermione felt two extremely dangerous forms of dark magic hit her chest, stirring some unknown magic.</p><p>"Fuck," Hermione moaned, as she stumbled backwards a bit.</p><p>She heard the laughing log the death eaters fade from her rewards, and blinding light envelop her.</p><p>And suddenly silence. Deathly silence.</p><p>xxxx xxxx<br/>
(even though there's speech Hermione can't hear it)</p><p>"I told you, James," a voice called out.</p><p>"I'm head boy, and I've never seen her before,"</p><p>"Doesn't matter... She isn't very pretty though, is she,"</p><p>"What idiot would fall asleep on the floor?!"</p><p>"This one apparently!"</p><p>Hermione felt a nasty curse hit her, and then felt herself hovering in the air.</p><p>"Who are you?" A voice called.</p><p>Rubbing her saw head, she felt an overpowering sense of nausea envelop her... Leaving her with a sick and numb feeling coursing through her bones.</p><p>"He asked you a question," one of them called out.</p><p>Hermione didn't hear, she pressed her thumb against her temple, attempting to regain awareness of her surroundings. Looking up she saw the familiarity of Hogwarts halls... She must have been flung to a different corridor than she remembered going in, by the way these were all still in tact.</p><p>Someone's hand snapped in her face, death eater? Looking up she was met with the handsome face of a boy she had never met, his black silky hair fell neatly at his shoulders and an amused smile was stuck to his face. </p><p>"Hey lady, 'watcher 'doin?"</p><p>His mouth moved, but Hermione couldn't hear any found come out of it. What was he doing?</p><p>"I think she's captivated by your good looks, Paddy,"</p><p>Now the handsome boy appeared to be laughing but still no sound could meet Hermione's ears - only blissful silence.</p><p>"I 'cah 'ear 'nythin" (I can't hear anything, her voice is mumbled from not realising she isn't pronouncing the words)</p><p>Sirius chuckled looking down at her "What was that dearie?"</p><p>"'Wha 'argh you 'ayin?" (what are you saying?)</p><p>"Sirius, you git! You've probably confounded her," A boy laughed, approaching Hermione from behind.</p><p>"Who 'argh you?" She blurted out "'Wha 'cah I 'ear you? 'Wha 'cah I 'ear at all?"</p><p>"Excuse me? Do you even know English? Retard, honestly," Sirius chided.</p><p>"Sirius!" James yelled although a large grin was plastered on his face.</p><p>Hermione's lip wobbled and began to morph into a pout as she felt tears sting her eyes.</p><p>"I think she's 'gon to cry, Prongsy," </p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Lips 'wobbilin and everything,"</p><p>"Ooh the poor dear,"</p><p>The latest comment was dripped in sarcasm.</p><p>"Boo!" Shoving Hermione's back and yelling loudly, James shocked the girl with the surprise. Hermione let out a shriek and covered her eyes with her hands.</p><p>"Tut tut James, it's down right awful to scare a little girl,"</p><p>"A girl? That's what that creature is? I thought it was a banshee,"</p><p>"Well you can definitely see the resemblance,"</p><p>James grinned at his friend, and they looked back down at the girl expecting a reaction.</p><p>"'Hel,"</p><p>James looked to Sirius to see if he'd been able to translate her mumble words.</p><p>"Help?"</p><p>"'Hel,"</p><p>"Help or hell, honestly woman - what are you saying?"</p><p>"'Plea,"</p><p>James eyes flickered with concern.</p><p>Slowly Hermione removed her hands from her eyes, and looked up at the boys whom were the definition of confusion.</p><p>She pointed at her ears, and looked at them expectantly.</p><p>"Your ears hurt?"</p><p>Her expression didn't change.</p><p>"What's the matter with you?!" Sirius declared.</p><p>Hermione didn't flinch from his loud tone.</p><p>Hermione thought back... These boys obviously weren't death eaters, and yet she had last thought some, their curses must have destroyed her hearing and what had they done to her position this most obviously was not the Hogwarts she knew and loved.</p><p>"James lets just get to the kitchen and leave, this girl is obviously in need of therapy,"</p><p>Nodding his head James followed Sirius down the corridor, noticing the way the bushy haired girl's eyes followed them until they were out of sight.</p><p>Using her hands, Hermione pushed herself up into a standing position, leaning against the wall she took deep breaths. That boy - the one with glasses - he looked like Harry, almost identical... But the eyes were different, hazel not the emerald green she knew he'd inherited from his mother. Not to mention this boy was larger in shape, more muscly unlike Harry's slim seeker build.</p><p>She'd seen the boy before. In photos.</p><p>Taking a large gulp, the signs were pointing to a very bad answer.</p><p>If that man was who she though it was, James Potter, than she was in big trouble.</p><p>Hermione felt even more nauseous than before. The death eaters couldn't have possibly sent her back in time. Or maybe this is where the deceased go, was she dead?</p><p>Staggering forward, Hermione tried to focus her mind on locating the whereabouts of the hospital wing or better yet the headmaster...</p><p>If she was really dead then there could be many headmasters in the headmaster's office but if her other theory was correct, the one that revolves around time travel, then she'd most likely discover Albus Dumbledore behind his desk or in his sleeping quarters.</p><p>Hermione would discover answers later, her feet had led her to the well known hospital wing.</p><p>After steadying her breaths, she pushed the doors open.</p><p>The hospital wing was silent, except for the occasional snore that drifted from the sick students that had taken refuge here for the night.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey was not anywhere in sight, 'probably sleeping,' Hermione had concluded.</p><p>Forcing herself to remove herself form the wall that she had leant on, Hermione stumbled groggily to a bed close to the door.</p><p>Feeling it's comfort Hermione felt a small nudge of safety at being away from war and being in a place where nothing bad came from serene silence.<br/>
xxxx xxxx</p><p>A cold cream melted into Hermione's warm brown skin, healing damages done by the nasty death eaters... Healing all but Bellatrix's cruel choice of a gift or in other words torture.</p><p>Blinking sleepily, Hermione noticed the familiar and comforting outline of Madam Pomfrey, who was bristling above her and appeared to be tutting her tongue. Hermione smiled in a somewhat sheepish matter, but it didn't meet her eyes </p><p>She still couldn't hear.</p><p>"My ears... Madam Pomfrey, I can't 'ear anything"<br/>
(her speaking will transition to clearer the louder she speaks)</p><p>Madam Pomfrey looked down at her, surprise obvious on her face. Madam Pomfrey said something.</p><p>"I still 'cah 'ear you" Hermione mumbled, looking displeased she bit her lip, if this was a curse done by the death eaters there was an unlikely chance of finding a cure.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey seemed to return to herself as she started applying more of the cream to Hermione's legs and torso..</p><p>Hermione watched as the damage began to fade leaving only scabs and bruises.</p><p>"Thankyou," Hermione said slightly in awe, Pomfrey smiled in a somewhat smug manner but that didn't bother Hermione in the slightest.</p><p>Looking around, Hermione could see the light that filtered through the windows, from the study of the sun - Hermione could tell that it was roughly two o'clock, how long had she been asleep?</p><p>Nonetheless Hermione refocused her attention on Madam Pomfrey who was pouring a yellow tinted potion into a plastic cup that was on the table next to Hermione.</p><p>Knitting her brows together, Hermione realised she still needed answers and her predicament was not helpful at all.</p><p>"Dumbledore,"</p><p>Madam Pomfrey looked back at her, eyebrow raised.</p><p>"Dumbledore please," Hermione repeated, much louder "I need to tell him something."</p><p>Madam Pomfrey had a stern face but after Hermione repeated her pleas she gave in, turning around she mumbled some incarnation Hermione couldn't place, a shiny Patronus erupted from her wand. Madam Pomfrey gave it a message and watched it run off, to Dumbledore's office she concluded.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey turned back to her, her face now one of determination and concentration, Hermione watched as she lifted the plastic cup and shoved it into her face saying something Hermione believed to be 'drink'.</p><p>Hermione acquired the drink from Pomfrey and lifted the cup to her lips, it was sour and had the distinct taste of grapes that had been trodden on, trodden on by rats. A sudden tingle went through her and she felt it course through the areas she had been burned, the burns seemed to melt, forming back into her original skin.</p><p>Handing back the cup, Hermione watched as Madam Pomfrey placed it down at her desk before opening the doors for a grinning Dumbledore to enter.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey told him something before he turned to look at her, Hermione didn't bother looking away.</p><p>The headmaster made soft steps as he walked towards Hermione, a well known twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>"Dumbledore," Hermione acknowledged, the man seemed to have stated something in reply but still Hermione could not place it.</p><p>"I've gone deaf, sir," Hermione informed him "I'm sorry to say I can't hear you," her heart sunk to her stomach as the reality sunk in.</p><p>Dumbledore nodded his head in a way of sympathy, Hermione nodded her head gently in a form of gratitude.</p><p>"I was attacked by death eaters before my arrival..." She paused with slight hesitation "I also believe them to be the cause of my sudden arrival," Dumbledore raised an eyebrow out of hinted curiosity "and of course my loss of hearing, something I know the wizarding world had sadly missed in fixing".</p><p>Dumbledore nodded his head in confirmation but also seemed slightly apprehensive, knowing that she was going to tell him something else apart from her new found disability.</p><p>"I was at Hogwarts when the attack happened, fighting a war," unknowingly Hermione's voice dropped lower, as Dumbledore was only just managing to hear it.</p><p>"We were fighting, and I was given parole, the act of checking the castle for hiding students... I hadn't expected to find death eaters 'swell,<br/>
There were seven that attacked me, all firing curses at me, dark and dangerous curses... When I awoke, I discovered two students... Whom I knew as older people - dead people- I assumed that where I was, where I am, is either a Hogwarts for the dead or I'd - travelled back in time, an unlikely theory,"</p><p>Dumbledore paused, most likely unsure if how he could answer either theory.</p><p>"I know I can't hear you so..." Hermione started, Dumbledore raised his eyebrow again "-are you dead?".</p><p>At the question, Dumbledore remained calm, not letting surprise overtake him. Slowly and reassuringly he shook his head and said something that Hermione assumed was him confirming that he, was indeed, alive.</p><p>A smile took over Hermione's face, glad to know she was still alive and breathing.</p><p>"Good, good, and would it still be the nineties?" Hermione asked unaware of the slight concern that fazed Dumbledore's face for mere second.</p><p>Dumbledore shook his head gently, sympathy written through his blue eyes.</p><p>"Oh," the words left Hermione's mouth without her realising, tears pricked her eyes "that's no good..." Dumbledore looked at her and placed a comforting hand on her shoulder "I'm guessing my time travel theory would have been correct then - those boys I saw... They would have been James Potter... And Sirius Black?" Hermione gave a small non-committal shrug of her shoulders "That would roughly put me in the seventies? And James was wearing a head boy badge - I think? And a quidditch captain badge too," Hermione gave a thoughtful mmph. "So being  head boy he'd be in seventh year, which would put me in...  Seventy-six? no no... Aha seventy seven!"</p><p>Hermione looked to Dumbledore for confirmation, he nodded his head accordingly.</p><p>"That's- THAT'S TWENTY YEARS!" Hermione yelled, not noticing her loud voice, as she grabbed her face frantically.</p><p>Dumbledore called her as he held out his hand in a respectable manner, Hermione met his eyes.</p><p>"I'll be back later, rest now, all will be well while at Hogwarts" </p><p>Hermione didn't know what he said but nodded as he left.</p>
