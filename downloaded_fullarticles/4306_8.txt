    <p>“Now remember stay away from the Weasleys and Potters, got it,” Scorpius’s dad Draco said to him before he left. His dad had said it over twenty times that day alone. He knew his dad rule and also that his dad was disappointed in him because he was too nice. Scorpius had never really liked being mean or cruel which was weird according to his parents. He said, “Yes, dad,” and hurried onto the train before his dad could say anything else. He knew if he had stayed his dad would have said, you better be in Slytherin because he had heard it his entire life. In truth he didn’t really want to be in Slytherin. He would be fine with anything but Slytherin.</p>
<p>He slid into an empty compartment and as he was a first year and had no friends yet he figured he would have the compartment all to himself for the entire compartment to himself. He stayed sitting in the same place as the train started moving. He was excited to be on his way to Hogwarts for his first time. For he was sure that this was the first time in his life he would be away from his parents, do what he wants, and break some of his parents rules. As he was enjoying in his newfound freedom he started to worry about what would happen if he was sorted into a different house than Slytherin. How would his parents react? Scorpius had always kidded himself that he didn’t care what his parents think, but who was he kidding. Of course he cared they were his parents.</p>
<p>Just as he was analysing these thoughts to door to the compartment slid open. Standing there was a pretty red headed girl, who was probably a Weasley he thought, and a black haired boy standing behind her. </p>
<p>“Could we join you?” the girl asked. Even her voice was pretty. “Sure,” he answered. The pair came in, put their trunks away in the overhead racks, and sat down. After, they got settled the girl said, “I’m Rose Weasley and this is my cousin Albus Potter. And you are?” </p>
<p>“My name is Scorpius Malfoy,” I replied. It was a Weasley and a Potter. The perfect rule of my father’s for me to break. But, seriously from all my father told me about the Weasleys I’m surprised that she is so beautiful. </p>
<p>We were silent for a moment and then all of us say in unison, “My parents told me to avoid you.” We all chuckled and then I said, “But, you guys seem nice.”</p>
<p>“You do to,” Albus said, “By the way you can call me Al.”</p>
<p>“Ok, Al,” I said, “I guess you guys want to be in Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>“Ya. And do you want to be in Slytherin?” Rose asked.</p>
<p>“Not particularly,” I replied, “Well my parents want me to be in Slytherin, but I don’t feel like I would fit in there. In fact I’d rather be in Gryffindor except for the fact that I wouldn’t be accepted there.” Rose stared at me intensely and Al sat there thinking about something very intensely.</p>
<p>“I thought that you would want to be in Slytherin. Why don’t you want to?” Rose asked.</p>
<p>“I just have never liked being mean or cruel and I don’t like how the Slytherins I’ve seen act. I wouldn’t like to be associated with them,” I tell her.</p>
<p>“I think that’s really brave of you to want to break with tradition like that,” Rose told me smiling. She has the most amazing smile I’ve ever seen. “Are you ok Al,” Rose suddenly asked.</p>
<p>“What? Oh ya. I was just thinking of the sorting ceremony. I’m really nervous.” Al answered.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry I am too,” I told him. Then he  pulled out a pack of exploding snap cards and we started to play. We played and talked about random things the rest of the way except for when the trolley came by at noon. It was fun and for once in his life Scorpius felt accepted. When the train started to slow down Rose stood up and told me, “You are actually really nice unlike my parents said.” He could tell that the three of them were fast becoming friends.</p>
