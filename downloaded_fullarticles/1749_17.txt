<p><br/><br/>I.</p>
<p>    Harry was feeling anxious in the large, overcrowded ballroom of the Ministry charity party. He forced himself to attend them every year, and didn’t understand why he put himself through it. Wealthy people rubbing elbows with other wealthy people to give “publicly” just so they can feel good about themselves. He purposely stayed quiet and rarely spoke to anyone other than a “hello,” “everything’s great,” “yes, the weather’s been nice lately,” “it was nice seeing you too,” “yes, likewise.” All the fake politeness and pointless small talk got on his nerves. He knew that more than half of the swarm were gossiping behind his back as soon as he left the scene.</p>
<p>    He walked outside with a drink in his hand; sitting down on a bench a good two hundred feet away from the mansion. There were others around; strolling the flower gardens decorated with lanterns and floating lights shaped like hummingbirds. It was far away enough that nobody noticed him, and he felt rather good about the distance. He could safely people-watch without interruption. He took a sip of his whiskey and sighed at the beauty of the roses softly lit by the enchanted flying creatures. The blood-red petals looked like pieces of velvet that were delicately cut and constructed by hand; though he figured magic played a big part. </p>
<p>   He heard someone walk behind him but pretended not to notice. As the figure passed the bench, Harry was able to smell the cologne. Strong herbs, some sort of flower and something citrusy. It was masculine but not overwhelming. It had a softness to it that reminded him of a forest you could escape to. To be away from the rest of the world and their egotistical desires. It was peaceful, beautiful, and enticing. He was tempted to turn his head, but he kept to himself; closing his eyes and sipping his drink.</p>
<p>    Once he knew that the individual was past his area by now, he opened his eyes and looked toward the gardens again. Harry saw him. He was standing at the edge of a white marble fountain shaped like a giant scallop shell. Water softly sprayed from the tips and flowed inside the basin. He could make out some of his features. Brown wavy hair down to his shoulders, a prominent nose, and about the same height as himself. He looked sullen and hid his hands inside his black trousers. Harry’s curiosity was very strong. He stood up, a hand inside his own pocket, drink in the other, and walked toward the roses. He was only a few feet from the fountain but didn’t feel the courage to look at it. He was playing with a single knut with his pocketed hand, then, almost instinctively and without much thought, slowly made his way towards the giant shell. He took out the coin and gently threw it in the water. The man spoke. “You’re either going to confuse people, or start a new tradition.” Harry finally looked at him. “Nott?”</p>
