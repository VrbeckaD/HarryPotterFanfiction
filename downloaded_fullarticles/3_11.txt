    <p>
  <span>Harry never wanted to be an auror. He only joined them because of Mad-Eye Moody. He respected him and the older man had taught him a lot. Harry wanted to honor his memory and put his newfound knowledge to use. Also, he did it because it was what everyone expected him to do. He had been fighting for the greater good since he started Hogwarts. At that time he never really had a choice but to fight, if he wanted to stay alive. So, after completing his 8th year at school, he joined up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He also did something else he never really wanted to do after he graduated. He married Ginny Weasley. Molly and Arthur had been so good to him during his childhood and they wanted him and Ginny to be together so much that Harry married her to repay some of the kindness her parents gave him all those years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, after marrying, Harry and Ginny had a serious talk. They decided they had always been better off as friends, and Ginny had no desire to stay at home and raise children. She wanted to pursue a career in Quidditch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When they told Arthur and Molly, they were upset but after they explained the situation between them, Ginny's parents understood. Harry and Ginny were going to remain roommates and that worked well because with Ginny being off training and playing with the Chudley Cannons, Harry had the place to himself most of the time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, buried in paperwork from his team's latest raid, Harry stared off in the distance, the end of his quill well chewed. He would much rather have been outside in his small backyard, planting a garden, or better yet at his typewriter, putting the words of a fantasy novel down on paper.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ever since he was small, locked in his cupboard under the stairs, Harry would think up fantastical stories that would take his mind away from his awful situation. He'd been wanting to write them down for a long time, in hopes that other children would read them and get lost in the worlds he created to get them through hard times as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blinking rapidly to try to clear his mind, Harry took his quill out of his mouth and bent over his paperwork. He glanced at his inbox and saw the corner of a black envelope peeking out from under some of the mail. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Great, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thought. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Another one.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had been getting threats in the mail for almost a month now, each one more ominous than the last. At first, he thought someone was having him on, but they continued to arrive. One or two a week. He read them and threw them in the bottom of his desk drawer, hoping whoever was sending them would get tired and stop. Obviously not.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed and laid his quill down. He then picked out the offending envelope and opened it quickly. Inside was an old wrinkled piece of parchment with a lock of hair attached. Frowning, Harry pulled out the note.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Next time it will be your throat I cut as you sleep.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What the fuck?" Harry mumbled to himself. Whoever had been harassing him had been in his home? While he </span>
  <em>
    <span>slept? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Oh, hell no. This was too much. He had had enough. A wave of anger swept through him so hard, his vision blurred. He would </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>put up with any more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pissed as hell, Harry stood and headed up to see the Minister. He slammed his door on the way out, causing others to stop what they were doing and stare. He ignored them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he finally reached the door to the Minister's office, he knocked loudly then opened the door and strode right up to Hermione's desk, dropping the parchment, hair, and envelope in front of his friend's face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Er...Harry, what is this?" She asked, looking up from the mess Harry had just dumped there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I've been getting threats in these black envelopes once or twice a week for a month now," Harry explained while pacing in front of the desk. "But this one...whoever is doing this was in my </span>
  <em>
    <span>house</span>
  </em>
  <span>!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione held up her hand. “Wait. Let me look at this,” she said, picking up the contents of the envelope. Her eyes widened for a moment then she levelled Harry with a glare that could put Merlin to shame.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry. James. Potter,” she began, “why in the name of Gryffindor didn’t you tell me about this as soon as it started?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stopped in his tracks, looking very much like a deer caught in the headlights.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well...er...you’re Minister and very busy, and I’m an Auror and we expect stuff like this after a raid, but none of it usually comes to fruition….until now...I guess.” Sheepish, he looked down at his shoes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As angry as I am right now that you didn’t tell me this sooner,” Hermione huffed, “we have to do something about this...now.” She was the one to begin  pacing now. “Let’s see….we’ll get you into a safe house, with twenty four hour protection, and then I’ll get the next best Auror team on it right away.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold on, Mione,” Harry said with a sigh. He suddenly felt very tired. “This is probably nothing. You know how I feel about being holed up somewhere.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione stopped pacing and placed her hand on her hip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not ten minutes ago, you rushed in here, madder than hell, telling me you are tired of this. What gives?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Again, Harry sighed. “I was in my office, thinking about why I became an Auror, then I found that stupid thing,” he gestured to her desk, “and I just got so angry. I never wanted to be an Auror. I’ve always wanted to write, but all my life I have had to do what everyone expected of me. I saved the whole Wizarding world, fought to stay alive all throughout school, and even when  the war was won, I was still expected to do shit I didn’t want to. Marry Ginny...become an Auror...keep saving the whole fucking world….and I’m just </span>
  <em>
    <span>tired.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He regarded Hermione for a moment and saw the look of complete sympathy she was giving him. Her eyes were oddly shiny.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I agree with you, Harry,” she said softly. “You’re absolutely right. Is there anything I can do to help?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” he answered. “Don’t curse me when I say this, but I quit. I’m done being an Auror.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione moved around her desk to embrace her friend in a warm hug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I understand, Harry,” she said softly into his ear. “And I promise I won’t curse you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry moved back with a chuckle. “Thanks, Mione.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a moment Hermione moved behind her desk to once more study the note given to Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are we going to do about this?” she asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry, pulling off his Auror’s robes, shrugged. “I dunno. All I want to do right now is sleep for about twenty four hours.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you really think this is just a prank?” she asked, watching him as he folded his robes and laid them in the chair closest to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably,” he answered. “For all I know that hair came from the person who sent that stupid thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have it tested immediately,” Hermoine said. “In the meantime…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna go buy me a nice steak, go home and cook it, have a good meal with perhaps a glass of firewhiskey, then hit the sack,” he grinned. “If you find out anything, owl me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Smiling, Hermione briefly hugged her friend once more. “I’m glad you’re doing this for yourself,” she said. “You know, quitting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” Harry said. “See ya later.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry left the Minister’s office with an actual bounce in his step. He felt so...free. He could do anything he wanted with his life, and in his opinion, it was well overdue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once back in his office, he packed all of his personal belongings, daydreaming about waking in the morning, having a cuppa, and sitting down to his typewriter to spend the day putting his imagination on paper. When he finished, he shrunk the bag, put it in his pocket, and walked out of the room. He didn’t even look back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry actually found himself whistling while walking out of the grocer’s with his dinner. He couldn’t wait to get home and get started. The sun was just setting on the horizon and it was getting darker by the minute. By the time he got home, it would be fully dark. The letter was the farthest thing from his mind as he was suddenly grabbed from behind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s assailant roughly and quickly pulled him behind a row of tall shrubs so no one could see them. “Finally,” the person behind him hissed, his voice low and gravelly. “I’ve been tailing you all afternoon, waiting for the perfect opportunity to get to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Twisting and turning,  Harry struggled to get away from his attacker. He dropped his grocery bag, meat and vegetables spilling out beneath his feet. Careful not to trip, the shorter man used his height to his advantage, swiftly ducking under the other man’s arm and turning around to face him while drawing his wand. What he saw staring back at him stopped him in his tracks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tall man stood towering over Harry in full Death Eater regalia, including mask, wand at the ready. Shocked, Harry could only stand and watched as the figure raised his wand and took a breath to send only Merlin knew what kind of curse his way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the last moment, Harry dodged the attack and Apparated to just outside the Ministry entrance. Wasting no time, he rushed in and high-tailed it as fast as he could to Hermione’s office, barely aware of the people he pushed past on his way. Once there, he barreled into the office and slammed the door behind him. Panting, he looked up to see Hermione setting a cup of tea down on her desk, eyes wide with surprise. Mirroring her actions, her visitor did the same and it was...Draco Malfoy? What?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry, what’s happened?” Hermione asked, rushing over to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry, still panting with his hands on his knees, moved his gaze from Draco to Hermione. “Attacked…” he managed, “outside the shops...Death Eater…” That’s all he could manage before sitting down on the floor, his back against the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were attacked by a Death Eater?” Hermione asked incredulously. “Are you sure?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nodding, Harry swallowed hard. “Yeah. Full robes and mask. He threw a curse but I dodged, Apparated, and came here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione went to her desk, poured a glass of water, then took it to Harry, who downed it in two swallows. “Thanks,” he said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s it,” Hermione told him. “That envelope was not a prank, and now you need to be protected, whether you like it or not.”</span>
