    <p>The soft pop of the house elf’s arrival woke him and by the time Harry Potter had gotten his glasses on, the creature had already popped out, leaving the morning’s newspaper behind as he had requested the night before. The young wizard immediately slipped on a robe and rushed into the adjoining sitting room, calling Draco’s name as he went. He wouldn’t have needed to go looking for the blond if not for the dose of Dreamless Sleep. The stress of the interview would have surely caused a nightmare, which Narcissa had seemed to know as she had offered the potion without even being asked. The taller boy was out of his bedroom in seconds, just as anxious to read the article as Harry was. Neither seemed to breathe as they took in the nearly two inch letters that made up the inflammatory headline.</p><p> </p><p>HORROR AT HOGWARTS! BOY-WHO-LIVED DEFEATS DANGER AGAIN!</p><p> </p><p>The article that followed was full of lurid accounts by various students describing the duel between Harry Potter and the possessed professor. Some of the supposedly first hand accounts were by people neither boy had ever heard of, let alone had DADA with. Even so, combined with what the reporter called Harry’s ‘raw, heroic account’ of events, it all made Harry Potter out to be a larger than life defender of wizardkind that made Draco smirk and Harry blush as they read it. The article also cast an extremely favorable light on the blond Slytherin’s defense of his fellow students and ‘stalwart presence at the side of his best friend, Harry Potter.’ The description of Severus Snape’s role was slightly more indecisive as it referenced the man as both ‘a critical aid to our hero in defeating the foe long thought dead’ and a ‘former Death Eater, turned spy’ in the war.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was less concerned with the compliments it paid the ‘Second-Time-Savior’ and much more focused on the actions of the Headmaster. While the reporter called him ‘well known and respected’ she was not otherwise kind. In fact, she all but called the school’s current hiring practices shameful and the actions of its administration almost – though unfortunately not quite – dangerous to the students it housed. Included were mentions of the ‘strange and slightly worrying’ placement of the Philosopher’s Stone within the school, as well as its full grown Cerberus guard.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was extremely relieved to see that the reporter hadn’t ignored his brief mention of the start of term warning about the third floor and the repeated detentions given during the year to students who explored the corridor. The woman had interpreted it as they had hoped, having pointed out in two places in the editorial the possibly ineffective measures taken to keep the students away from such dangers. In one of the references she even called the situation ‘shocking in its lack of concern for the safety of our children.’</p><p> </p><p>The less than complimentary critique continued in a smaller article on the third page that included excerpts from at least nine different letters that the old man had sent to concerned parents who had owled him in response to their children’s correspondence after the DADA duel. Both boys were quite fond of the title, ‘Missives of a Dismissive Dumbledore.’ It was quite satisfying that the elderly wizard’s own words made it seem as if the Headmaster had not been overly concerned with the fact one of his professors had been possessed by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and attacked a student. Those same words gave the impression that he had lied to parents in order to cover up the event.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I can assure you, madam, that all is quite well here and that any classroom issues are being handled with all appropriate care” </em>Draco read out-loud with a sneer.</p><p> </p><p>“This one’s even better, Draco, look, “<em>The staff here at Hogwarts is quite accustomed to the types of outbursts which can be common amongst the stressful end of year exams.”</em> The two shared incredulous looks that turned more than a little outraged as they read another quote. “…<em>we believe that children should be allowed to verbalize their stress however they choose and such dramatics should not be punished.”</em></p><p> </p><p>“Did he really think he could just deny it ever happened, say it was just a silly story made up by naughty school children and everyone would just believe him because he’s Albus Dumbledore?” Harry’s tone was almost shrill as he stood abruptly and walked to the other end of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s tone was far deeper, with a harsh undertone that showed his growing anger. “Probably.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry paced restlessly for a minute before calming enough to rejoin his friend on the cream silk cushions of the settee. He took a deep breath to gather himself and picked the paper back up, turning it to the front once more. There was another article there, covering the bottom third of the front page and continuing onto the second. He didn’t want to read it, but he knew he needed to. As he did so, he did his best to pay more attention to how things were said than what was said. It had been bad enough having to say it the day before. Reading it, and knowing everyone else in the Wizarding world was likely reading it, was almost too much.</p><p> </p><p>Draco allowed the smaller boy to read it through himself and waited for him to set the paper down before reaching for it. It was difficult to read, almost as difficult as it had been to listen to when Harry had spoken to the reporter. Knowing that his best friend had been ignored and hurt and mistreated by the Muggles had been one thing. Hearing it had been quite another. And he knew for a fact that what had been said hadn’t been close to all of it.</p><p> </p><p>Much like his friend he paid closest attention to the journalist’s tone and the indirect and not-so-indirect suppositions she had made about who and what was to blame for the appalling life Harry had described. The blond was sure that the tale of neglect and near starvation, of constant verbal and physical abuse, had been the very last thing she had expected to hear when she had been assigned to interview the Boy-Who-Lived.</p><p> </p><p>The brunette bit his lip, waiting anxiously for his friend to finish reading the last article. “Well, what do you think?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco set aside the paper and stood. “I think you come across sounding rather reasonable about the whole Quirrell situation, and that everything else in the article is more than flattering. The letters from Dumbledore were a fantastic bonus.” The two young wizards exchanged smiles, though Harry’s was a little strained.</p><p> </p><p>“And the last one could do quite a lot towards making the old fool look uncaring and inept if things go even half so well as we hope this week.” The taller boy briefly squeezed the other’s hand, his voice dropping slightly. “There might be comments, of course, and I doubt the first session or two of the Wizengamot will be focused on anything other than your situation. But some people who read it will hopefully be more focused on the actions that allowed it to happen rather than on you personally.”</p><p> </p><p>The Potter heir took a deep breath, having already known that speaking so publically about his past meant he would have to suffer through a lot of whispers and pitying looks. Maybe being simultaneously lauded as a hero for the DADA duel would help mitigate it. It was possible. Another breath and a nod had both boys returning to their rooms to dress before heading down to join the adults for breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>The Lady Malfoy’s voice drifted into the hall before they reached the dinning room door, the adults having obviously already read through the paper. “Well, it would seem this Sinclair woman is a more than passable writer. It is nice to see that the Prophet’s hiring standards have improved.”</p><p> </p><p>“Indeed,” responded Lord Malfoy with a hint of amusement in his tone that was mirrored in the small smirk evident when the two boys entered the room. “It is certainly fortunate.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco couldn’t hold back a smirk of his own at the reminder. A few months after Harry had moved into the Manor, the Malfoy Patriarch had begun to tailor his political actions and comments in preparation for his eventual alliance with the Houses of Potter, Peverell, and Longbottom. A reporter named Rita Skeeter had written an article about the shift. In it she had implied that the House of Malfoy was growing indecisive and speculated about what could have caused the change, including Lucius Malfoy being senile or being distracted by a Muggle mistress. It had been the last article she’d ever written. Shortly after the article was published, she had inexplicably lost her job and been blocked from any reputable employment in Britain.</p><p> </p><p>The Lord’s smirk only widened when the young wizards joined them at the table. “Good morning gentlemen.” Grey eyes he had once found intimidating met the brunette’s green gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“I believe congratulations are in order, Mr. Potter. You did an admirable job with your interview yesterday. You both came across very well indeed.” Lucius glanced over at this son with a smile, no doubt remembering the way the reporter had said several of their classmates credited the blond with protecting them from the duel. His attention returned to the smaller boy with a nod. “The quote regarding your Proxy selection was especially well worded.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry blushed a little, having been too tired the afternoon before to discuss the interview after their return to the Manor. “Draco and Neville helped me prepare responses on the ride, sir. I just took their advice.”</p><p> </p><p>Another look passed between father and son that had Narcissa and Draco both looking quite pleased as the elder wizard continued. “I believe today’s articles will set things in motion quite nicely. It bodes very well for our plans.”</p><p> </p><p>Green eyes brightened. “Do you think the situation is secure enough to visit the bank?”</p><p> </p><p>Before either adult could answer Harry’s hopeful question, Knobby popped in to announce the arrival of the acting Lady Longbottom and her grandson. Augusta took in the sight of the breakfast still in progress and gave a brisk nod. “Perfect. There is just enough time left for a good cuppa.”</p><p> </p><p>As he watched Neville and his grandmother sit down and serve themselves, the brunette glanced around in slight confusion. Seeing the expression, Narcissa explained the morning’s schedule. “It is a risk, as you know, to leave the Manor before the legalities are fully settled. However, Augusta has managed to arrange a special Portkey to take us to and from the bank. There are few, if any, wards stronger than those around Gringotts. We will all be quite safe as long as we do not stray outside of the bank. Such entrance is not often granted, but the goblins have agreed to extend us this courtesy in order to access your vaults.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t hold back the smile that information prompted. He had been rather impatiently waiting for it to be possible to visit the bank so he could finally open his parents’ Wills since he had first been told about them. In the years since, it had been far too dangerous to leave the safety of the Manor for fear of the Headmaster’s interference before the Malfoys had gained legal custody of him. Which of course, had been impossible to do without alerting the Chief Warlock that he was not where he had been left in the Muggle world. Harry would risk nearly anything before he’d risk being sent back there. So he had waited, and now it seemed the wait was over.</p><p> </p><p>The two other boys had a hard time keeping their emerald-eyed friend occupied enough to allow everyone to finish their tea and scones. They were slightly successful as he found the adults’ conversation more interesting, if no more distracting than his friends’. His attention was caught briefly when the Longbottom Regent informed them that she had already received a half dozen owls on the subjects covered in the three articles. Most had been from reporters wanting a comment about either Neville’s having seen the duel or his relationship with the Potter and Malfoy heirs. One, however, had been from the Ministry department of Wizarding Children’s Services requesting an interview about her knowledge of her daughter-in-law’s efforts to obtain custody of Harry after the Potters’ deaths.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone at the table found that quite interesting – and encouraging – news. Lucius was able to provide equally entertaining information as he finished his breakfast. “I heard from my contact at the Ministry this morning. He owled not two hours after the special early morning edition was sent out to say that Dumbledore had only just left. The old man tried to seize custody of young Mr. Potter for what he termed <em>safety reasons</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The child in question shuddered in his seat at the idea of being completely in the man’s control. The last time that had happened he had ended up in a basket on his Aunt’s porch in the middle of the night. No one missed his reaction, but they didn’t comment on it either, for which he was grateful as the elder wizard continued. “I can only assume that this morning’s paper was not well received by our illustrious Headmaster.”</p><p> </p><p>Everyone smiled at that. “What did he do, dear, when his request was denied?”</p><p> </p><p>They both knew that someone had tried to breach the wards that morning, it was the reason that Lucius was already awake when the owl arrived. He did not say that, however, simply answering his wife in a calm tone. It was nonetheless obvious that he was amused by what he was about to say. The others’ reaction were a bit more mixed when he informed them that Dumbledore had tried to file charges against the Malfoy Lord for supposedly kidnapping Harry Potter from his Muggle relatives.</p><p> </p><p>“My contact assures me that everyone in the office was perfectly shocked and horrified that he thought Mr. Potter belonged with the Muggles and should be returned to their <em>care</em>.” The aristocrat’s lip curled in disgust before he went on. “The wizard in charge promptly explained that I had already been granted emergency custody and that there was, in fact, no legal guardian on file to which Mr. Potter could be returned.”</p><p> </p><p>The wizard’s sneer turned to a satisfied expression so sharp Neville actually worried Lord Malfoy’s lips would start to bleed. “The Chief Warlock tried to tell him that the Dursleys had been removed from the file for Mr. Potter’s protection in case anyone intending him harm went looking for the information. The excuse was not well received. My contact also told me that after the Headmaster’s departure, his superiors had a closed door meeting about the ‘rightful chain of custody,’ which I can assume is when you were contacted, Lady Longbottom.”</p><p> </p><p>After that, the conversation failed to hold the eleven-year-old’s attention. Not a quarter hour after the Longbottoms had arrived, Harry’s patience ran out and he asked as politely as possible if they could leave yet. With an arched brow and a look at her watch, Augusta said that they were only minutes away from the time set to activate the Portkey. Far slower than the brunette would have liked, they all gathered in the entrance hall, cloaks on. Everyone except Augusta had their hoods drawn up to minimize the likelihood of their being recognized.</p><p> </p><p>Minutes later, once his stomach had settled back down into its proper position, Harry realized that they needn’t have bothered. The group was promptly taken from Gringotts’ private receiving room to another private office deeper in the bank. The two guards that accompanied them were the first goblins that Harry had ever seen and he finally understood why the Malfoys had been so adamant that he learn goblin etiquette the year before. The sight of the Potter/Peverell account manager, Brynjar, only reinforced that, especially when Draco whispered to him that the name meant ‘warrior in armor.’ Despite the crisp business suit, it was a very fitting name, in the brunette’s opinion.</p><p> </p><p>For a nerve-wracking few minutes, the Potter heir stumbled through what he could remember from the lessons as an appropriate greeting and a brief discussion of what he wanted to accomplish during his visit. Eventually another goblin brought in several ledgers of files and handed them to Brynjar. One of those files included his parents’ Wills, their last wishes for him.</p><p> </p><p>He took a deep breath and nodded at his account manager to begin the reading. Two scrolls of parchment where placed in front of him and Draco helpfully whispered a reminder of what he was suppose to do. Another steadying breath and a simple spell cut the tip of his index finger, allowing three drops to fall on each seal. The wax holding the scrolls together seemed to evaporate and the two lengths of parchment rolled open. The hour that followed was one of the most informative, and angering, that Harry had experienced since his first lesson with Lord Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>The account manager was in another part of the bank getting some file or other for them to review when the words had finished tumbling through his head and coalesced into an understandable pattern.</p><p> </p><p>“We were right about the Proxies they assigned,” Harry said in a flat, emotionless tone. Draco rose from his seat beside his friend and took a step closer, reaching out to put a hand on his arm, but the brunette continued woodenly. “Though being the Black heir is a bit of a surprise. I’m sure we can use that.”</p><p> </p><p>His being listed as the heir to the Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black had come as a surprise to everyone in the room, including the goblin, who had left the office under the pretense of collecting the Black and Gryffindor documents to go over as well as the Potter and Peverell files. The being most likely was more intent on avoiding the storm visibly brewing in the powerful young wizard. The concerns of wizards were only of interest to the goblins when it directly impacted the bank, the goblin nation, or the finances of either. And while it could be argued that the heir to four great Houses could impact all three, the account manager obviously felt that could be addressed after Harry had been calmed down.</p><p> </p><p>He sounded perfectly calm, of course, so calm it was almost painful to listen to, but everyone in the room knew with only a glance at the shimmer of magic pulsing in time with the brunette’s shortening breaths, that he was anything but calm. The eldest Malfoy chose to ignore that for the moment and go along with his temporary ward’s current need to address everything except the reasons for his rage. “You are correct, we can certainly use it. I must agree, however, that it is quite a surprise to see that Sirius knew enough of the old rituals to have made you his heir. It is a tricky matter to assign a non-blood relative as such and he left his family before that level of magic would have been taught.”</p><p> </p><p>“I agree,” added the last member of the Black family not dead or imprisoned. “Perhaps he took some older texts with him when he left Aunt Walburga’s. I doubt he found that type of book at the Potters’.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, as well regarded as the House has always been, even by the traditional families, the Potters never did truly follow the old ways,” admitted Augusta.</p><p> </p><p>The eldest blond made a sound that would have been a snort if it hadn’t been somehow sophisticated. “No, they hardly ever so much as sat in their Wizengamot Seat.”</p><p> </p><p>“The Potters preferred social deeds to legal ones,” the Lady Longbottom pointed out. “And they were no fans of the established order within the Ministry,” she went on, a pointedly raised brow aimed at the wizard.</p><p> </p><p>The Potter seat would be occupied soon, as would the Peverell, and the Gryffindor, and the Black, the heir to all four Houses corrected silently. His families’ power would be felt in full on the first court session after he turned twelve. He would be able to name his Proxies before the Wizengamot then, and the other Houses would be very clear on where he stood. The thought of how much he looked forward to that day calmed him a little, making him at least appear reasonable when Brynjar returned with the additional files and began to explain the state of his many accounts. They started with those from the House of Gryffindor, then Black, then Peverell. Last were those belonging to the Potter family. The task took almost an hour and was boring enough to further dull the edge of Harry’s anger. Until they reached the secondary Potter accounts.</p><p> </p><p>The first clue that the wizards and witches had as to the content of the next folder was the eager expression on the goblin’s face as he picked it up. “Vault 496 is a subsidiary account of the House of Potter and was opened by Lord Potter in 1979, not long before he and his Lady went into hiding. The funds were to be available for certain prescribed uses related to the war effort, including but not limited to a bi-yearly donation to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and an annual stipend for St. Mungo’s Hospital. All withdrawals were ceased upon the Lord Potter’s death as is usual with any financial transaction that was not indicated by the Lord as ‘in perpetuity.’”</p><p> </p><p>The file was laid open on the desk for Harry to see. Lucius, after a nod from Harry, leaned forward to peruse it as well. It was a list of several dozen withdrawals of varying amounts, starting on 2 November, 1981. “However, in November of 1981, when a previously scheduled withdrawal did not continue, we were given a statement, signed by Lord and Lady Potter, and accompanied by the key to Vault 496. The statement instructed Gringotts that all monetary transfers to the Red Wing Foundation were to continue indefinitely.”</p><p> </p><p>“What is the Red Wing Foundation?” asked the blond wizard, causing a wicked expression to fill the account manager’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“We at Gringotts can not share private information concerning our clients with anyone not expressly authorized. Except directly to said client or their direct heir and only if questioned by said client or heir,” was the goblin’s careful response as he slowly turned his gaze from the elder Malfoy to the smallest wizard in the room.</p><p> </p><p>Green eyes blinked several times before the young wizard understood what wasn’t being said. “What can you tell me about the Red Wing Foundation, Brynjar?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad you asked, Mr. Potter. The Foundation was started on Feburary 19<sup>th</sup> of 1970 by your grandfather, Lord Fleamont Potter, and Albus Dumbledore. The formation of the Foundation was sealed the same day on Lord Potter’s request.”</p><p> </p><p>“Were the transfers made?” Harry asked, the brunette having to work hard to keep from gritting his teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Two Magical Signatures were attached to the document with the instructions for transfer. They passed an initial identity scan. We attempted to send a message to the designated guardian of Heir Potter to confirm the instructions but were unable to find any such wizard or witch on file. Without access to living or preserved Magical Signatures, we were unable to prove the ones on the statement to be false.”</p><p> </p><p>“And the only preserved Magical Signature of enough clarity to use for full verification is that which has been recorded on a sealed legal document such as a Ministry contract or Last Will and Testament, the former of which the Potters did not have, and the latter of which was unopened,” concluded the Malfoy Lord.</p><p> </p><p>“Precisely. Normally, a Will is read automatically upon the issuance of a death certificate by the Ministry, but in this case, a legal injunction had been filed the day before those certificates were signed, which prevented the reading of the Potters’ Wills. Under these conditions we were unable to prevent the transfers. We did, of course, maintain careful record of all such transactions, as you can see. We also kept the original letter under stasis in case the opportunity came to compare it to the requisite signatures.”</p><p> </p><p>All eyes went from the ledger to the recently opened Wills. All of the effort he had gone to in order to suppress the feelings of anger and betrayal began to crumble as James and Lily Potter’s only son instructed the signatures to be compared immediately. Brynjar was more than happy to comply as the deceptively gentle tones of the Lady Malfoy inquired as to the identity of the person who presented the alleged statement.</p><p> </p><p>“Headmaster Dumbledore, the other originator of the Foundation, of course,” the account manager answered.</p><p> </p><p>“And under whose authority was the injunction filed?” asked Lady Longbottom.</p><p> </p><p>“Chief Warlock Albus Dumbledore,” replied the goblin with a sharp grin.</p><p> </p><p>“I do believe Mr. Potter would be most interested in acquiring a copy of all the records concerning the Potter Wills, the injunction against them, the activity of Vault 496, and this Red Wing Foundation,” Lucius Malfoy stated with a smirk as the comparison spell began to flash a dark red. Agreement was given without hesitation, a second goblin being summoned and sent to organize the records in question.</p><p> </p><p>Harry did his best to pay attention, but the byplay between the blond Lord and the goblin barely registered through the fury he had only managed to outwardly contain. Dumbledore was stealing from him and had forged his parents’ Magical Signatures to do so. The thought was infuriating. But it was soon drowned out by another as his gaze followed the red light to the two open Wills. Which made him think about everything that had been in them and what it would have meant for them to have been read when his parents first died.</p><p> </p><p>He had known, of course, that he shouldn’t have been left with the Dursleys. Even if his mother had listed her sister as a possible guardian for him, even a halfhearted check would have shown that he shouldn’t remain. His bedroom was a cupboard for Merlin’s sake. Without even taking into account the way he was treated in public and the disdain his relatives barely even tried to hide in front of teachers and neighbors, any type of home inspection whatsoever would have clearly shown that Number Four was not an acceptable place for him to be.</p><p> </p><p>Yet Petunia Dursley was his aunt, she was his mother’s only sister, so it was possible that the initial placement was not strictly illegal. Discounting the fact that he had been withheld from his godmother, of course, as she was his legal guardian in the Wizarding world. But there was a slim chance that Lily Potter had in some way mentioned her sister as an option to care for Harry. And she had mentioned her. She’d stated, unequivocally, that her son was to not be left in the care of Petunia or Vernon Dursley under any circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>There were, in fact, half a dozen people listed as possible guardians for Harry Potter. Sirius Black and Alice Longbottom, as his godparents, were listed first, of course. Then there had been Remus Lupin, Mary McDonald, Augusta Longbottom, Minerva McGonagall, and even Severus Snape had been listed. There had been absolutely no reason for him to have been left in the Muggle world with relatives that hated him and had no chance of defending him from the Death Eaters that had probably wanted him dead in the wake of Voldemort’s disappearance. All it would have taken was for one of them to track him down and wait for him to walk to school. Or do the grocery shopping as he often did. Or, perhaps, be beaten unconscious by his loving Uncle for being a <em>no good freak</em> as had happened at least twice by Harry’s recollection.</p><p> </p><p>The brunette’s thoughts spun and spun in his head. There had been so many options. So many things that would have, <em>should </em>have happened. If his parents’ Wills had been read, if anyone had thought to question his disappearance or listen to the Longbottoms when they repeatedly brought up that fact, if anyone had just checked on him once, he never would have…. Harry cut off that train of thought abruptly and tightened his grip on the arms of his chair, pointedly ignoring the thought that the old man might have checked in on him at some point and just not seen a problem, or not cared that there was one. His breath began to come a little faster. Then another hand, paler than his own, covered his fingers in a solid but gentle grip, forcing green eyes to snap up and meet familiar grey.</p><p> </p><p>Draco gave him a concerned look and the smaller boy did his best to return it with a reassuring one of his own. The worried narrowing of his best friend’s gaze told him he had failed; badly. But the blond’s action was enough to pull him from the enraging thoughts and return at least part of his attention to the others in the room, just in time for the goblin to finish talking to the adults and turn back to his client.</p><p> </p><p>“Is there anything else you require of me today, young wizard?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry glanced briefly around the room and seeing nothing to indicate another problem had come up while he had been distracted, he shook his head. “No, thank you, sir. You have been most helpful. I look forward to our next meeting, may it prove profitable for us both.”</p><p> </p><p>Brynjar stood with a nod. “May we make much gold together, Mr. Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>Everyone else stood as well and Harry silently thanked the Malfoys for his lessons once again as he supplied the appropriate closing to their farewells. “And may it be at the expense of our enemies.”</p><p> </p><p>The smaller being grinned, flashing rows of sharp teeth, then led them all back to where they had arrived so that they could Portkey back to the Manor. The trip back was as disconcerting as the trip there and the three lordlings each took a moment to regain their balance when they arrived. Once everyone had enjoyed another cup of tea and a short exchange of gossip, the Longbottoms took their leave and Lucius was smirking as widely as Harry had ever seen him.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I believe that was a most productive outing.” As if noticing that his son’s best friend was not feeling as accomplished as he was, Lucius pinned the young wizard with a level stare. “We now have solid documentation to prove that Albus Dumbledore forged papers in order to steal from your vaults, issued a legal injunction to prevent the reading of your parents’ Wills outside the prevue of the Chief Warlock, and that he acted against your parents’ explicit wishes. We have proof that he circumvented several laws in order to retain personal control over you and your placement. This makes him, Mr. Potter, solely liable for any harm that came to you while in that placement. And we will make him pay for it.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded in understanding, taking a deep breath to keep the underlying anger from bubbling back up. “When can we present the case against him?” the brunette asked, though he already knew the answer.</p><p> </p><p>“The next session of the Wizengamot opens at nine o’clock on the morning of the Summer Solstice. It is not so very long to wait, Mr. Potter.”</p>
