    <p>Cold.</p><p> </p><p>That’s all Credence Barebone can think of as his hands tremble and yet another passerby refuses to take a pamphlet from him. He’d been standing on the corner two blocks from the second salmeners church for the better part of four hours. But Ma told him not to come home till the either the pamphlets were all handed out or the sun set. And he hoped the pamphlets were all gone before the sun set.</p><p> </p><p>He would be beaten for the sunset.</p><p> </p><p>At least his new friend was with him again. At first he thought maybe he was hallucinating it from the cold when he saw his friend for the first time. A black fox in the middle of New York City was unheard and credence had never seen a fox in person so when he told his mother about the odd little fox that he saw over a dinner of thin soup. His mother simply said,</p><p> </p><p>“Those rich folk are always bringing in exotic pets from god forsaken places. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was someone’s pet that got loose.” That seemed like a reasonable explanation to Credence and he even told the fox that one day.</p><p> </p><p>“Ma says you’re some rich person’s pet who got loose, is that true?” he asked rubbing his hands to keep warm. He had ducked into the alley way after the wind suddenly picked up one evening to stay warm as best he could. The fox of course didn’t respond, rather its response was a solitary ear twitch. And when Credence held out his hand for the fox to sniff hoping it would at least let him feel its breath, the fox leapt from the trashcans it sat on sending them tumbling with a crash and darted down the alley way and away from Credence.  </p><p> </p><p>That was weeks ago and Credence didn’t dare approach the fox again for fear of scaring it off permanently this time. He now contented himself with gazing at it from afar and wishing he had a thick coat of fur to ward off the cold like the fox did.</p><p> </p><p>After another hour, the sun finally set and Credence with a sigh resigned himself to returning to the church and his punishment his mother had no doubt planned for him. As he made his way back pulling his coat tighter around himself he couldn’t help but feel that he was being followed. He quickened his pace and didn’t look back as the feeling grew stronger, whatever was following him had also awakened the thing that lived inside Credence.</p><p> </p><p><em> </em><em>Fight</em> it whispered to him making his head pound and his blood roar in his ears. So lost in his internal agony, Credence stumbled and fell. He gasped as his knees hit the cold concrete, the pain momentarily overriding the thing inside him. He turned and stopped breathing, a creature dressed in rags glided towards him. Boney hands outstretched making to grab him, the thing inside him shrieked in rage and in challenge and it felt like Credence was being torn from the inside out as the thing tried to escape, tried to fight.</p><p> </p><p>Credence heard someone yelling but barely registered it as he stared at what was to be his end. A burst of light came from behind him suddenly.  It caused the creature to emit a horrible shriek and it recoiled as if in pain. Credence watched as ghostly bloodhound bounded in front of him baying as it the light seemed to emit from the dog. And as the dog approached the creature the light grew brighter. Credence gasped as the thing inside him recoiled in fear from the dog as if it was afraid of it as well. And as soon as it had appeared the creature fled the alley, darting into the sky and vanishing. The spectral bloodhound turned to look at Credence its tail wagging slowly and Credence did what any rational person would do.</p><p> </p><p>He fainted.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Percival Graves wasn’t thinking as he shifted from fox to man. He wasn’t thinking as he pulled out his wand and roared the spell calling his patronus forth. He only started thinking as he stood over the boy he had been watching for weeks laying on the cold pavement and snow began to lightly fall.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit.” Was all he could think of.</p>
