As the Hat was lowered onto his head, Myrtle Warren glanced around the Great Hall. While everyone was watching Tom, no one seemed to be interested in his Sorting. Her lips turned downward in a frown as she looked over at Professor Dumbledore. The man wore a frown as he watched Tom with narrowed eyes.</p><p>Myrtle's blue eyes narrowed as she watched the professor. Tom had told her about this man. Professor Dumbledore had visited Tom at the orphanage, telling him about magic and giving him a bag of money to purchase his school supplies before leaving – leaving Tom behind at that horrible place with those filthy muggles. Surely a man like Dumbledore knew what happened to magical children in some muggle households.</p><p>

      <span> how Tom was treated, but she knew her own treatment at the hands of her parents. Rowan Warren ignored his daughter, unless he had a bad day and needed to vent while Sally Warren called her daughter horrible names and said unforgivable things as she ordered Myrtle around. Then there were her siblings, Reed Warren followed in his father's example by ignoring his little sister and Willow Warren would watch her big sister with wide green eyes. Her hands curled into fits as she thought about her own family. She </span>

  <span> <span><span> Returning her attention to Tom, Myrtle found herself admiring the way her friend held himself. He was seated on the three-legged stool with perfect pasture. Watching him, Myrtle thought back to his words on the Express. </span></span></span>
