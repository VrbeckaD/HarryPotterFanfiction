    <p>Queenie came back, eyes red and puffy. Jacob, opened his eyes and a blank expression came over his face as he rushed off to a different direction.<br/>Now it was your turn.<br/>Rain splattered onto the ground just like your tears did. The past week has been the most amazing, weird, whimsical, bizarre, happy week of your life. You got a break from your dull office job life and found passion and friends for life. And love. But now, in a second, it will all be taken away from you. You won’t have any memory of any of this. But that’s the thing, you had to remember. You couldn’t just forget, just ignore the whole entire world that has been introduced to you. And the people that have been introduced to you.<br/>“I don’t want to forget.” You choked, looking through tear-filled eyes at Newt.<br/>Newt Scamander. A shy, passionate, awkward, loving, caring man. A man with whom you’ve fallen in love with. A true love.<br/>“I know.” Was all Newt was able to say. He took you in his arms, savouring the feeling. The feeling of you, Y/N. The feeling of the woman of his dreams. Because, in an instant, the only person he ever loved and cared for so deeply, was going to be taken away from him.<br/>You sobbed into his teal blue jacket.<br/>“I can’t just go back.” You cried. “I belong with you.”<br/>You couldn’t just part. How can you leave this new world behind? How can you leave Newt behind?<br/>“Before you go, Y/N I need to tell you something.” Newt said, pulling you off of him so he can look at you. So he can look straight into your eyes.<br/>“Before you leave me, I need to tell you. And I know, you won’t remember any of this, but I just need to let it out. Y/N. Throughout all my life, I never had someone, another human to love. I lived a very lonely life before I met you. My parents, my family, they never quite understood me. My brother got all their attention anyway. Then at school, I quickly got isolated because of my so-called weirdness, and I spent my days of education alone. Everywhere I went, my thoughts stayed within me, and the only conversations I was able to have were with my creatures. Of course my creatures are other beings, but well, I never had anyone to answer me. I never had anyone to laugh with, to cry with and to discuss with. I had almost lost hope in friendship, and even more in love. I had seen it before, couples hanging out in malls and everything. But I never knew that I, me, Newt, was going to find love. Then I met you.”<br/>The tears were pouring hotter and faster out of your eyes.<br/>“Then you came along, Y/N. And I got this feeling I never felt before. I was so confused in the beginning, but one day I realized. That day, when I found you alone in my case, just sitting there with Frank the Thunderbird. I knew. I had found love. Because the only thing I’ve loved before were my creatures. And when I realized I felt even more for you, I knew that I loved you.”<br/>He closed his eyes and looked back at you. “And I thought the greatest day of my life was when I met you. But it wasn’t. It was the day you told me you loved me back. That night when I told you my feelings and you said you returned them. That immense joy I felt, so happy that I finally had someone, someone to talk to, someone to care for, someone to love, someone to laugh with, someone to call mine. That night, when I held you and kissed you, made me forget about all my pain in the past. It was like all the loneliness I have suffered through was going to be compensated by me meeting you. I-I love you Y/N. And I won’t ever stop.” His voice cracked at that last part and he lowered his eyes from yours.<br/>You took a step towards him and lifted his chin with your hand, making him look at you again.<br/>“I love you Newt. I don’t have any words to describe it. I wish I had, I wish I had these beautiful big words to tell you what I feel for you, but I can’t. Because what we have, it’s indescribable. I love you.” You told him.<br/>You wished you had words for him. Words to comfort his breaking heart, words that he could remember you by.<br/>“Those three last words are all I need.” He whispered to you.<br/>You looked up and got lost in his eyes. Those starry blue green eyes. You got mesmerised by them, for the last time. His eyes were like home, and you were moving out. Unwillingly. His eyes filled with tears.<br/>You started crying even harder as Newt squeezed you closer to him. He closed his eyes and listened to his heartbeat on yours, wondering if you two would ever reconnect again.<br/>“Hey. Hey it’ll be okay Y/N. It it’s meant to be, we’ll find each other again. I promise. I’ll find you.”<br/>“Time’s running out.” Croaked Tina.<br/>You took a deep breath, getting ready to leave the best thing that has happened to you.<br/>“Y/N. I will never forget you.”<br/>“Goodbye Newt. I love you. So much.”<br/>And on those final words, you closed your eyes. You had always heard that it hurt to look back, so you stepped out into the rain.<br/>Newt watched Y/N slip away. How she gracefully let go of his fingers and left. Tears poured hotter and faster than they have ever done before out of his eyes.<br/>“She’s gone.” He cried out. He collapsed onto his knees.<br/>“Oh come here dear.” Queenie said, sitting down beside him and putting her arms around him. Tina sat down on his other side and patted Newt on the back softly.<br/>“She’ll come back.” Queenie reassured, reading his mind. “Oh I know, there really is no one like her. But seriously, you will find each other again. What if she doesn’t remember you? I have a feeling she will at least a bit.” A smile tugged on Queenie’s lips slightly.<br/>“We’ll find both of them again.” Queenie continued, thinking about her Jacob.<br/>+<br/>It had been half a year since Newt’s little trip at New York. Ever since he went back to England, he had worked his ass off trying to complete his book. Finally, he did.<br/>Now he was on a ferry, heading out to the American city again. With one person on his mind. That person was always on his mind. Every minute of the day back home, he’d think of her. Y/N.<br/>+<br/>“Newt! Oh wow you haven’t changed!” Tina exclaimed, surprised at who arrived on her doorstep.<br/>“Where are all the sudden thoughts about Y/N coming from? Ah Newt!” Queenie reacted similarly, seeing the freckled wizard at her door.<br/>+<br/>Y/N headed to her local bakery, Kowalski Quality Baked Goods. It had been 6 months since that horrible rain storm had happened. And weirdly Y/N had no recollection of what happened before that whatsoever! She resumed going to her job, stopping by the bakery every morning and evening before and after work and befriending the owner, Jacob.<br/>“Hey Y/N!” Jacob waved cheerily at her when she walked through the doorstep.<br/>“Hey Jacob. Ugh I had the most exhausting day at work ever.” Y/N sighed, collapsing in the chair right in front of the cashier counter, her usual spot to have conversations with Jacob. She took off her teal blue jacket and yellow scarf and happily took the pastry Jacob put in front of her.<br/>“Tell me about it.”<br/>+<br/>“C’mon, Jacob’s bakery closes in two hours!” Queenie called after Newt.<br/>“Okay okay, I’m coming! Where’s Tina?”<br/>“Work, for a change. Ever since she’s been back in the Auror position, she’s been so busy!”<br/>Seeing the British all ready, Queenie grabbed his arm and they Disapparated with a crack.<br/>+<br/>“Hey Jacob, business is really going well eh?” Y/N continued.<br/>“Booming! People love my treats!”<br/>“Of course, you’re the only bakery in town that makes these weird animal things.” Y/N chuckled.<br/>+<br/>“There it is. I come see him every day at this hour.” Queenie smiled, staring at the bakery across the street.<br/>The pair started walking towards it.<br/>+<br/>“Ooh 5:29. That lady is gonna come!”<br/>“Oh my god Jacob seriously, you think that lady in pink comes in here every day to see YOU?” Y/N laughed.<br/>+<br/>As they approached the open-windowed bakery, Newt caught glimpse of a (Your hair colored) figure with a yellow scarf and a blue coat beside her. Could it be Y/N?<br/>+<br/>“Okay it’s 5:30, she ain’t here Jacob. You’re so dumb sometimes.”<br/>Jacob ignored Y/N’s comment.<br/>“Who’s that with her?” He asked, looking at the pair outside.<br/>“Hmm?” Y/N asked absent-mindedly and turned around in her chair.<br/>+<br/>Y/N turned around in her chair. Newt’s jaw dropped and his eyes filled with tears. It was her. Her. Y/N. She hadn’t changed, she even looked more beautiful than what Newt could remember.<br/>“Let’s go inside.” Queenie whispered to him.<br/>+<br/>Who is that? Y/N thought. His name was right on the back of her tongue but she couldn’t quite get a grasp on it.<br/>+<br/>Queenie approached the counter.<br/>“Hiya. Can I get two coffees for here please?” She said to Jacob.<br/>He smiled furiously as he nodded.<br/>Queenie took a seat a small table with Newt. He couldn’t get his eyes off her. It was like the first time he saw her, unable to stop looking at her, wanting to drink in every aspect of her.<br/>Y/N smiled at him and turned back around to face her book.<br/>“Hey Y/N, do you mind bringing them their drinks? I still got a couple of order forms to fill in.”<br/>“Sure.”<br/>Y/N took the two mugs and walked carefully to them.<br/>“Here’s your coffees.” She said, putting them down. By accident, her hand grazed Newt’s, and triggered something in the back of her memory. “I’m sorry, um do I know you?”<br/>“I-I don’t- maybe. I’m-“<br/>His name started with a N, Y/N thought.<br/>“Newt. Newt Scamander. And you?” He questioned, feeling so foolish asking Y/N what her name was.<br/>“Newt, I think I heard that name before… I’m Y/N, Y/N Y/L/N. “<br/>Newt smiled, remembering the way Y/N would say her own name.<br/>“Well, I’ll see you around. Newt.”<br/>+<br/>“She remembers you.” Queenie whispered happily to Newt.<br/>“I doubt.” He felt saddened, having the love of his life not even recognize him.<br/>“That’s false, she does recognize you. When you accidentally touched her hand, she had half of your name in mind!”<br/>Newt thought for a little. He decided on one thing. He was going to make you remember. He was here, and now that he had found you, he would never let you go. Ever, again. One time was painful enough.</p>
