    <p>Lana Rosier was in Hogwarts posing as Millicent Bulstrode.</p><p>Malfoy had wondered how exactly his godfather was going to train Rosier if he had teaching duties, but apparently he hadn't given him or the Dark Lord enough credit. He'd noticed Bulstrode acting weird ever since they'd gotten back to school, and he'd known the other girls had noticed it too because even stupid Parkinson had commented on how 'off' the large Slytherin was. Rosier wasn't a good actress, the newness of the situation obvious, and she failed to follow Pansy around and hang off of her every word like Millicent and Daphne had been known to do. She also wasn't eating enough to feed a small army, which in the end became the conclusion everyone in Slytherin came to (the few that'd actually given a damn). They'd all decided that Millicent Bulstrode was on a diet, and that was causing her some sort of hormonal imbalance or something.</p><p>Draco himself couldn't really care less about Rosier or her growing accustomed to being around their classmates without giving away anything. He had more important things to do, like Quidditch practice and such. Plus, she was his godfather's charge, not his. He also somewhat pitied the pathetic creature, having to constantly drink Polyjuice Potion must be <em>terrible</em>.</p><p>"Did you see Millicent out <em>jogging</em> this morning?" Parkinson asked Daphne Greengrass. "All her rolls of fat were jiggling. It was ridiculous."</p><p>"What's with the sudden health regime?" Greengrass wanted to know, making up her face. "She's always been fat and she always <em>will</em> be."</p><p>From where she was painting her fingernails a rich green, Astoria smirked at her older sister's insult. "They don't call her Bull Bulstrode for <em>nothing</em>."</p><p>Daphne and Pansy shared amused looks while giggling amongst themselves.</p><p>From where he sat on what was termed Slytherin's Throne, Draco rolled his eyes in disgust before returning his attention to the scroll he'd charmed to look like his notebook for schoolwork, as a reply began to burn beneath his last letter.</p><p>
  <em>Attn: He Who Must Be Questioned</em>
</p><p>The familiar handwriting wrote.</p><p><em>I am surprised to find how much I am enjoying my new lessons. There is much I did not know about the female arts and my mentor is surprisingly (for me) very knowledgeable in the feminine wiles and how they may be used to our advantage. I must admit that I didn't think I had any wiles to speak of, as before I used to scare away males instead of attract them, but now I admittedly feel more confident and competent. It will be interesting to actually USE this knowledge instead of just studying it</em>.</p><p>Draco's smile melted from his face into a frown, eyebrows nearly touching in his frown.</p><p>
  <em>We were <strong><u>V</u></strong>isited once more. Apparently my progress is pleasing. The first area of learning was the hardest to master but now that I've learnt to deal with those undesirable situations I have been quickly going through my lessons and enjoying it all immensely. She's actually giving me more advanced studies than she'd planned on giving me and has praised me in that way of hers and I don't care if this sounds as if I'm bragging because, well, I am. I'm definitely bragging. There are few people other than Him whom she praises so I am quite pleased with myself.</em>
</p><p>He rolled his blue eyes but his amusement was slowly returning.</p><p>
  <em>There was a...meeting...last night and I was able to meet a new family. The Flints. I met their son actually. I believe you went to school with him?</em>
</p><p>Marcus? What was Marcus doing in a meeting where Aunt Bellatrix would take Chloe?</p><p>Draco didn't exactly know the truth behind why the Dark Lord was keeping the girls, all he knew was that the story everyone had been given was bogus...they were important for other reasons. The Dark Lord protected the girls, hid them, so the fact that he would let Bellatrix take Chloe to meet the Flints, Marcus in particular, disturbed the young Malfoy heir. He remembered that ogre-faced, sharp-toothed boy. Stupid bloke. Had repeated a year.</p><p>
  <em>I believe I will be meeting him again later. She was insistent I get to know him. It is intriguing. What do you know of him? What should I be aware of?</em>
</p><p>Draco's frown deepened as the words continued to be burnt into his charmed scroll.</p><p>
  <em>There have been mentions of a test. Maybe he has something to do with it? Am I to test my...knowledge...on him?</em>
</p><p>He nearly stood at that.</p><p>
  <em>Or maybe he is the one being Considered. Again, what should I know about him?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Chloe Sullivan, She Who Must Be Answered</em>
</p><p>"What do you think, Blaise?" Parkinson turned to where Zabini was seated in silence in his own dark little corner. "Don't you think Millicent has contracted some sort of grave mental illness?"</p><p>"She might have," Zabini shrugged. "Then again, I think <em>every</em> girl in this school is mentally deficient."</p><p>Sensing the slight for what it was, the girls all sent him evil glares.</p><p>Zabini ignored them, returning to his silent ponderings.</p><p>A muscle jumping in his cheek, Draco wondered how he could last till graduation with these people.</p><p>

  <strong>
    <em>Stay far, far away from Flint. Not only is he incompetent, but he definitely has ogre blood in him. Look at those teeth. That's not normal. And he's ugly. Too ugly to be trusted. And have you noticed that he has a faint odor of onions? He's a wizard-he shouldn't be smelling! So all in all I tell you to avoid him and any association with him at all costs. And should you have to 'practice your wiles' on him I believe they are being easy on you. He's so undesirable he'll easily fall for any attention from a half-decent looking female.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>I doubt they'd make him be a 'Considered' as you put it. I get the feeling He doesn't utterly detest you as to do something like that.</em>

    <em>Draco Malfoy, The Boy Who Answered</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>The door to the dungeons opened and Rosier-in-Bullstrode's form appeared, face red yet smiling as she returned from her evening jog. "Good evening everyone!"</p><p>As always, the common room seemed completely disturbed and a little scared of 'Bulstrode's' cheerfulness.</p><p>Zabini just watched her with a frown.</p><p>Rosier was doing a <em>terrible</em> job of not calling attention to herself and assuming Bulstrode's identity. Chloe had mentioned something about tests, and if this test was to see if Rosier could mingle successfully then she was going to fail. Terribly. Just the other day during Potions she'd actually <em>helped </em>a Hufflepuff, and the poor little pathetic boy had seemed terrified, waiting for her help to backfire on him. Everyone was waiting for it...and when nothing happened Draco had been amused to see that that revelation had shaken and terrified everyone even <em>more</em> than if something horrible had happened to the Hufflepuff.</p><p>
  <em>Attn: The Boy Who Answered</em>
</p><p>Chloe's answer was quickly penned.</p><p>
  <em>His teeth ARE somewhat scary.</em>
</p><p>Draco's lips twitched with amusement.</p><p>
  <em>I saw your father today, he came to talk to Her about something. I don't know what about because I was sent to my chambers, but once they were finished with their secret little meeting I was called upon and we had a long chat. I'd forgotten how much I missed messing with him. I don't know if it's because he was the first Wizard I ever met but I feel more comfortable with him than I do with anyone else.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was also good to hear how Lois is doing, especially since you proved useless in that area. Your father informed me all about on her progress and the poor soul looks older than I remember him, and I think that luscious hair of his might be thinning. It worries me. I have never seen anything as beautiful as his hair and it should be defended and protected at all costs. I recommended he start taking daily doses of vitamins A, B3, B5, B6, B12, C, E, and also Biotin and Inositol. Hopefully, with their help, his hair will return to its silken majesty.</em>
</p><p>Draco's eyes narrowed as a hand went subconsciously to his own palest blonde locks, lean fingers running through the silky strands.</p><p>
  <em>Apparently because I've been doing so well I am to get a reward, a gift. I have no idea what it might be but I'm very intrigued and excited! My mind goes over the millions of things that it could be but I know that it couldn't be any of them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Chloe Sullivan, The Girl Who Wonders</em>
</p><p>Rosier returned from presumably bathing, Bulstrode's cheeks red and a smile on her lips as she threw herself down on the sofa and opened up a pink book, beginning to write in it.</p><p>Everyone eyed her worriedly.</p><p>Zabini kept his gaze on her.</p><p>Rosier seemed to feel it because she looked up and her gaze met his. Immediately a blush darkened on her cheeks as she lowered her gaze back to her book and continued to write furiously.</p><p>Zabini's eyes narrowed further.</p><p>Draco wondered whether the other boy was beginning to suspect, though he couldn't see how considering that Zabini didn't know what he did.</p><p>"What'cha doing, Millicent?" Parkinson chanced the question.</p><p>Rosier looked up and smiled. "Nothing, just writing in my diary."</p><p>"A diary," Daphne echoed, shock on her every feature.</p><p>"Aren't you a little <em>old</em> to be keeping a diary?" Astoria sneered.</p><p>Rosier turned to her. "The Dark Lord kept one."</p><p>That shut up the younger Slytherin, who lowered her gaze immediately.</p><p>"I doubt he used his diary for the same purpose you do," Blaise surprised everyone by commenting, shocked them silent just by the fact that he cared about something he wasn't involved in personally. "And I <em>sincerely</em> doubt he <em>blushed</em> while writing in it either."</p><p>She looked hurt.</p><p>That look was so <em>awkward</em> on Millicent's face.</p><p>Bulstrode would have snarled at Blaise and sent a curse in his direction.</p><p>Rosier looked away, unable to keep the hurt from her face. "Why don't you mind your own business, Blaise?"</p><p>Zabini's eyes narrowed further, flashing.</p><p>Bulstrode <em>never</em> called Zabini by his first name.</p><p>She didn't call <em>anyone</em> but Pansy and Daphne by their first names.</p><p>Draco looked between them before snorting, shaking his head as he began to write.</p><p>

    <em>Rosier is here in Hogwarts. She's shite at what she's doing. Zabini is starting to suspect.</em>

    <em>Draco Malfoy, Not Impressed</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>"Why don't we go and bully some first years?" Parkinson wanted to know, standing and gazing down expectedly at her two groupies. "We'll make them cry. I love it when they do that."</p><p>Daphne grinned. "I call dibbs on Hufflepuffs."</p><p>"They're too easy." Parkinson rolled her eyes. "Their very existence is pathetic."</p><p>"Everyone knows people are only sorted into Hufflepuff if they don't have what it takes to be sorted into the other Houses," Daphne agreed, turning to Millicent. "Lets go, Millie."</p><p>Rosier's face showed her deep reluctance. "Can't we do something else? Do we always have to be mean?"</p><p>Daphne and Pansy shared horrified looks.</p><p>Rosier stood and put down her diary. "Why don't we go take a nice walk around the lake? The air will do us all some good. Living in <em>dungeons</em> really can't be good for our health."</p><p>"Okay, that's it!" Pansy grabbed Rosier's arm. "We're taking you to the Infirmary! Something is terribly wrong with you!"</p><p>"But-!" Rosier tried escaping.</p><p>Daphne grabbed her other arm. "It's that or we'll hex you back to normal! You choose!"</p><p>"But I'm <em>fine</em>!" Rosier continued to struggle as the girls dragged her out of the dungeons.</p><p>Draco wondered if he was the only one who noticed that when Zabini stood and made his way towards his dorm, that he picked up Rosier's diary and took it with him.</p>
