  <span>“Do you mind?” Malfoy hisses through gritted teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shoots him a quick look from his hunched position on the upholstered bench, defiantly continuing his fiddling with the piece of string he found a couple of hours ago. Malfoy looks pale, even paler than usual, but his patented glare is just as murderous as ever. They’ve been trapped in here for nearly three days, and Malfoy’s patience is wearing dangerously thin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shrugs, turning his gaze to the view outside their tiny window. St Pancras Station is really nothing special to look at, but after three days, anything’s better than the interior of the compartment they’re currently in — not to mention the sight of his agitated companion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quarantine, they call it. Prison, more like. Locked up in the Eurostar wizarding carriage to avoid the lethal Muggle virus from spreading to the British Isles from the continent. Not that anyone’s bothered to test them for it; having been to Paris is apparently reason enough for keeping them. Just a nice way of saying thanks for finally solving that fucking Polyjuice fraud case that has kept them awake for the best part of two weeks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For fuck’s sake, Potter — stop it!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The piece of string is suddenly snatched from Harry’s hands, the yank forceful enough to burn the skin on his fingers. The sudden outburst still echoes through the confined space as he looks up to meet Malfoy’s stormy eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck is your problem?” Harry snaps. “I’m just as restless as you, you fucking twat. No need to make this shit any worse than it already is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And just like that, Malfoy breaks — slumping down across from Harry, hiding his face in his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It feels like forever before he finally speaks, voice soft and quivering. “I’ve never had a Muggle disease in my life, Potter. My immune system is not prepared for a virus like this, and if I catch it, it’d probably kill me, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’ll be fine, Mal—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it hot in here?” Malfoy blurts. “I feel like it’s…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, Malfoy’s Auror robes are on the floor and Harry’s presented with his bare, perfect torso.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Damn</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry swallows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Four more days.</span>
