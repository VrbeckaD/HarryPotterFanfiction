          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Hermione?”</p>
<p>She looked up from her book and blushed slightly at the sound of his voice saying her name. “Hi, Ron.”</p>
<p>He dropped down beside her. They weren’t’ far off from where they had their first study session a few weeks ago. </p>
<p>He set his book bag down by his feet. He eyed the book in her hands. “Learn anything new?”</p>
<p>Her fingers played with the pages. “An offensive spell.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” She turned, facing him. “When you cast it on an object it fires off or attacks the subject you’re aiming for.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Could you show me?”</p>
<p>She readied her wand and silently cast the small pebbles on the ground to float. “Oppugno.”</p>
<p>The pebbles veered off, hitting the trunk of a nearby tree with so much force some bark flew off.</p>
<p>“Wow, thats -”</p>
<p>She bit her lip. Did that scare him?</p>
<p>“You’re brilliant, you know that?” He grinned </p>
<p>She smiled back. “I know.”</p></div>
