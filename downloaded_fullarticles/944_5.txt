  <b></b>
  <span>In order to entice the shop owners of Diagon Alley to return to their buildings, a campaign had been launched which included several security measures both seen and unseen. Defensive enchantments had been cast all the way up and down the alley in addition to the extensive charms shop owners had been permitted to apply themselves. Hit-Witches and Wizards, in their signature forest green robes, patrolled the alley, marching up and down the cobblestone street importantly, their faces raised and a note of superiority in their expression. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Less visible were the Aurors whom Gawain Robards, their recently reinstated leader,  had patrol in disguise. According to the Head of the Aurors, this assignment was an opportunity for the new recruits to practice their skills of observation and deduction. Which was why, autumn of 1998, newly qualified Auror Ron Weasley found himself drinking copious amounts of polyjuice potion and hanging around middle age witches doing their shopping two days each week. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The worst part about polyjuice, aside from the taste of course, was that more often than not—okay, every time—Ron lost several inches of his signature height. Ron was unaccustomed to many people being taller than him, and it always made him rather uncomfortable. In disguise, people didn’t </span>

    <span>see </span>
  </em>
  <span>him anymore. He had to duck out of the way when people passed, and navigating through crowds was an exercise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Today, however, the street was pleasantly deserted with only a few witches and wizards meandering about. Ron knew from his many assignments here that as they got closer to lunch it would be packed with people running errands on their breaks, but there was no reason aside from a serious superiority complex that the Hit-Wizards needed to pay him any attention. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Move along there,” said a Hit-Wizard as they passed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron, who’d been sitting in the stoop of the defunct Weasley Wizarding Wheezy’s store, didn’t see a reason why he couldn’t be sitting there. He scowled as he got to his feet, but didn’t argue as he stretched and started down towards the Leaky Cauldron. He’d taken to sitting in the stoop of the twin’s shop due to its vantage point of both the Alley and the entrance to Diagon Alley. Not to mention that one day, when George finally wanted to leave his room, Ron didn’t want him coming back to a vandalized storefront. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Feeling the eyes of the Hit-Wizards still on him, Ron ducked into the nearest shop while trying to make up his mind about whether or not to take another dose of potion now rather than waiting another half hour. From the window, he watched the wizards finally pass him and when he turned to duck back out of the store he found the shop owner staring at him expectantly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I help you dear?” she asked in a perfectly friendly voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron blinked, realizing he was in the apothecary. Not wanting to look too suspicious he shook his head and turned to the nearest barrel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er-no, just checking prices,” he said and the shopkeeper frowned at him. “For my wife.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her smile rightened. Ron found it amazingly easier to simply say he was married and that it tended to ender him to the shop owners, a man doing things for his wife. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s sweet of you,” the witch said. “You let me know if there’s anything I can help you find.” And she returned to her weighing of what looked like alligator hearts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron sunk further into the store, pretending to check the prices of various things all the while keeping an eye on the street. The shop door opened again and a man stepped through, his hood still drawn. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello,” said the witch cheerfully. “Lovely weather we’re having.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need these,” he replied rather rudely, thrusting a list at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was something familiar about his voice, but Ron didn’t know from where. The witch didn’t look too pleased to be spoken to in such a tone, but picked up the parchment and went about fulfilling the order. Ron wondered whether he shouldn’t queue to purchase something, perhaps he’d get close enough for a good look. He picked up a vial at random and began to inch closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still feet away, the man turned to look at him and though his face was still shadowed, Ron caught enough of a glimpse to suddenly remember where he’d heard that voice before. The night of Bill’s wedding, after they’d fled to Tottenham Court Road. Ron wondered why he hadn’t recognized him from his stature alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thorfinn Rowle towered over Ron in his disguise, giving him a nasty scowl before turning back to face the counter. Rowle had been one of those death eaters always on the outskirts of their radar while in the war and they’d presumed him dead after no one had heard from him after the events in the forbidden forest.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron froze in place, wondering what to do. The hit-wizards outside would be useless in helping, not to mention the fair crowd that was meandering the streets as they got closer to lunchtime. He wondered if his patrons would be fast enough, only to remember that he was in disguise and that the average citizen had no reason to be sending off a Patronus in the middle of the day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His hesitation had gained the attention of Rowle who’s packages were almost finished. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’ll be fifteen gallons and four sickles,” the witch said, handing over the paper sacks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Throwing his coins onto the counter, Rowle accepted the parcel, eyed Ron mincingly and marched out the door. Without thinking Ron chased after him but hadn’t made it over the threshold when Rowle turned and it was all Ron could manage to throw up a shield, deflecting the spell so it flew through the glass of the window, shattering it and a fire erupted inside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Ron could cast his own spell, before anyone even had the sense to scream, Rowle disappeared with a sharp crack. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He made a withdrawal,” Harry announced when he arrived at the scene a half-hour later. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Hit-Wizards had been quick to arrive at the scene and while it took some time to convince them of his identity, they’d been quick to assist in managing the crowd while a handful of Aurors combed through what remained of the storefront. No one had been hurt, thanks in part to the many protective enchantments that the shop owners had applied, and Ron had personally seen that the witch behind the counter made it to St. Mongos to be treated for shock. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Ron asked, looking up from the vials he’d been sorting through to make sure that none were at risk for explosion. “From Gringotts? Why weren’t we notified?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since when have the goblins been good for anything that doesn’t benefit them?” Harry asked darkly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’ll be even less useful now that they know we’re on the case,” Ron said and Harry grinned at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It happened yesterday morning, took less than a thousand gallons,” Harry explained pushing aside the remains of a barrel, “The goblins didn’t think it was enough to warrant a notification.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not enough,” Ron scoffed, “That’s more than most people make in a month.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry merely shook his head. “Question is, why didn’t he take it all?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Either thought less would go unnoticed or is planning something bigger and thinks he’ll be able to come back later,” Ron answered logically and Harry nodded. “According to the shopkeep he purchased knotgrass and boomslang skin.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What else?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron pulled out the notepad he’d used to interview her, “bicorn horn, leeches and…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They looked at one another and at the same time said, “Polyjuice.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a good thing you were here,” Harry said, composing himself. “I’d hate to think what might’ve happened.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fat load of good I did,” Ron grumbled, “He made his purchase and next time he won’t be so open about it. What I don’t understand is why he didn’t just go to good ol’ Montmorency’s?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe it creeps him out as much as the rest of us,” Harry answered. “Only reason to go that far into Knocturn Alley is if you want to be cursed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And wouldn’t that be terrible,” Ron said sarcastically, they grinned at one another. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They worked quietly for a minute, repairing the smashed vials and stacking them into boxes for Magical Accidents to sort through should they ever arrive on the scene. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was making a legitimate purchase,” Ron said again, voicing the worry that kept bouncing around in his head. “If I hadn’t been there, then I don’t think anything would have happened.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, then it was a good thing you were,” Harry replied without looking up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you mean?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like you said, he was seeing what he could get away with. The bank, Diagon Alley on a Tuesday morning,” Harry replied, “If you hadn’t been here then he would have kept going and this way no one got hurt.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron nodded, not feeling much assured. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did the right thing,” Harry said, catching the look on Ron’s face. “And if nothing else, we know he’s back and he’ll have to be more careful now that he knows that we’re onto him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He won’t though,” Ron pointed out. “He didn’t know it was me, all he knew was someone was following him. And he didn’t stick around to even see if I survived.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe we could trace him,” Harry said, looking excited. “We might still catch him, wherever he went.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron shook his head. “Too many people disapparated at the same time, I asked Jackson about it when he got here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the sound of his name, Jackson, a senior Auror whom Ron was most often paired with, looked up and came over. “Anything?” he asked, looking at the boxes they’d filled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing that looks too risky,” Ron answered, “And we got the fire out before it spread.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank goodness for that,” Jackson said he looked at the growing crowd of people and then back at them. “I’ve got it from here, why don’t the two of you head back to the office and look through Magical Accidents, see there’s any chance they’ve caught wind of him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m happy to stay,” Ron said, feeling responsible for the storefront. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jackson shook his head. “I’m surprised the press isn’t here yet but they’ll make it impossible to leave once they get here. You two know him better than I do, I’d rather you be working on this than talking to reporters all evening.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the mention of reporters, Harry and Ron shared and look and nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Investigate what you can,” Jackson instructed them, “I’ll check in with you later.” </span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>So far in their two and a half month tenure as Aurors, Ron and Harry had been largely been spending their time shadowing other Aurors as on the job training. Being given their own task, even one as menial as going through old reports, Ron had to admit felt exciting. But as an afternoon of following up on Accidental Magic reports turned into a week, Ron found it far less exciting than before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’d been all up and down the English countryside, meeting perfectly normal witches and wizards and finding to the letter what the initial findings had found to be true. The excitement of having an assignment all to themselves, even if they had to report on their progress after every outing, had worn off and Ron found himself looking forward to his shifts at Diagon Alley if only so he didn’t have to answer to every step he took. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’d be nice if he’d show his face again,” Ron grumbled as he and Harry finished plotting out their afternoon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not that I want anyone to get hurt.” He said quickly to the look on Harry’s face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Harry said, shaking his head, “I was just wondering if we couldn’t draw him out somehow.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like set a trap?” Ron asked and Harry shrugged. “We’d have to know what he’s after, and so far it just seems he wanted to stock up on potion ingredients.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry sighed, slumping back into his chair. “I suppose we’ll just have to keep at it then.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This shouldn’t take too long,” Ron said hopefully, picking up their list and scanning it. “We’ll be home in time for dinner.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded, standing up. “The cottage outside of Bath first then?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The cottage.” Ron agreed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The November air of the English countryside was a shock compared to the relative warmth of the muggle office park they’d just visited and Ron was grateful that they found the shelter of some trees to protect against the wind as they oriented themselves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s this one?” Ron asked, peering doubtfully at the small cottage that looked rather rundown and abandoned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“According to the muggles, this place has been empty for years,” Harry replied, checking his notes. “Then, two months ago someone spotted smoke in the chimney and the place disappeared off the map.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was their most promising lead of the day, which was why they’d saved it for last. Magical Accidents hadn’t even had time to look into it yet because according to them, it had belonged to Sacharissa Tugwood and they only suspected one of her relatives' muggle proofing the place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Might as well get it over with,” Ron said without much enthusiasm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry pulled off the Invisibility cloak they’d been huddled under and Ron missed the little protection it’d provided. They passed through the nearly broken gate and up through the overgrown and frozen garden towards the front door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone’s been here,” Ron said, peering in through the windows and found the front room stacked with boxes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he spoke, Harry raised his fist and knocked on the wooden door which swung open under the </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello?” Harry called. “Is anyone home?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no reply and they peered into the darkened front room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should we go in?” Harry asked doubtfully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is supposed to be abandoned,” Ron said with equal uncertainty. He gripped his wand and, with a final nod, pushed open the door the rest of the way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was hard to see, but Ron didn’t risk lighting his wand as he stepped over the threshold. Unlike its unremarkable exterior, the front room gave plenty of indication that the home was occupied. Boxes stacked to the ceiling make the already small room feel rather cramped and the smell of herbs and other potion ingredients was overpowering. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merlin,” Ron hissed, feeling the need to sneeze as he took in his surroundings. He pinched his nose with his free hand and took another hesitant step into</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Think anyone’s home?” Harry whispered from behind him and Ron shrugged. "Homenum Revelio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They waited with bated breath for a moment, but there was no indication of another soul and Ron felt himself relax, lighting his wand and turning to the nearest crate. Harry shut the door most of the way behind him, lighting his own wand and stepping towards the fireplace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s still warm,” Harry announced, holding his hand over the ashes. “Whoever it was might not have been gone for long.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s get a quick look around and then report back,” Ron suggested and Harry nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t know it’s him,” Harry said hesitantly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whoever it was isn’t brewing all this for themselves,” Ron replied, inspecting a jar of a dark liquid which looked suspiciously like blood. “Sneezewort, belladonna? Nothing good can be going on here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Carefully he closed the lid of the crate and looked over to Harry who had leaned in close to read the text of a rather recent looking book. Ron was just about to ask what was simmering in the cauldron when a noise outside cause them both to freeze. Hastily, Ron extinguished his wand, ducking low beside the nearest crate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His ears hadn’t deceived him and Ron watched in horror as the large, cloaked figure entered the gate and walked towards the door. Helplessly Ron looked to where Harry had been only to find the spot he’d been standing in invisible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shit,” Ron hissed, steadying his hand as he cast a disillusionment charm on himself. It wasn’t his strongest spell but he hoped that the darkened room and the shadows of boxes would be enough to hide him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was just in time too. Blinded by the light of the door, Ron sunk further into an empty space as the figure ducked into the room and lowered his hood. The hulking figure froze just over the threshold and he held his breath as the still man surveyed the room as if looking for something. For a second Ron worried Harry had been discovered as Rowle pointed his wand suddenly but his spell merely caused a roaring fire to sprout in the fireplace, bathing the room in a warm light. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was with a false security that Ron watched Rowle lower his hood and hang his cloak on the peg by the door for before he removed his boots he grasped his wand again and muttered “Homenum Revelio.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron didn’t have time to think let alone duck behind the nearest crate as there was a sweeping sensation and his body was outlined. His only saving grace was that Rowle seemed to be as surprised as Ron to have found him standing there. They stared stupidly at one another, Rowle’s eyes widened in surprise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He quickly composed himself, his face twisting into a displeased grin and he snarled, “Weasley.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No longer the unknown friends of Harry Potter, Ron and Hermione had gained their own notoriety in the months that had passed. It was still alarming hearing his name come off a Death Eater’s lips, to be said with such venom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?” Rowle snarled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You had to have known that we were coming,” Ron told him in a voice that was surprisingly even. He knew he only needed to stall long enough for Harry to act. “Blowing up the Apothecary? It was only a matter of time before the Aurors came.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span> “And what? Have they sent you in here as bait?” He let out a horrible laugh and Ron gripped his wand, trying not to show his intimidation. As abrupt as his first spell came his second, “Crucio!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stupefy!” Ron shouted back and ducked out of the way as the curse came flying overhead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should know that the Wizengamont doesn’t take kindly to using unforgivable on Aurors,” Ron said from his hiding place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I heard that they accepted you,” Rowle drawled. “They must be desperate.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron couldn’t deny that the insult stung but forced himself to remain silent, aiming his wand to cast again. From his crouching position, he watched as Rowle stalked around the room, trying to get a better angle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stupefy!” Ron tried for a second time, but the curse missed and crashed into a cauldron, tipping it over and Rowle had to throw himself out of the way as the neon green liquid began to eat through the table it had been resting on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think your backup would have arrived by now!” Rowle taunted and the crate closest to Ron blasted apart. “Or are you trying to prove something here Weasely? Did you really think you’d be able to take me on by yourself?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron clenched his teeth, jumping to his feet. “Incarcerous!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ropes shot across the room, catching one of Rowle’s feet and causing him to stumble. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Relashio!” he shouted as Ron attempted another stunning spell but was blocked even before Rowle could regain his balance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think these schoolyard spells can stop me?” he laughed, again that horrible laugh. “I’ve mastered dark arts even your most twisted fantasies couldn’t imagine!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Crucio!” he screamed again and this time Ron was not fast enough. Caught mid-stride, Ron fell to the floor, unable to stop from screaming out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rowle was sneaking closer, his footsteps echoing through Ron’s crowded mind. Every inch of him felt on fire, like he was being flayed alive when he was finally released there was no possible way he was going to have skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Immobulus!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s voice echoed around the room and finally, Ron was released from the pain. Rowle turned, engaging Harry in a duel and it took all of Ron’s strength to roll out of the way and take cover behind another of the crates. He took several gasping breaths, his ears ringing and even though the room swayed as he stood he forced himself to get to his feet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Incarcerous!” he tried for a second time, binding the man’s feet together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His victory was short-lived and the triumphant smile vanished from his face as Rowle ignored the distraction and cast again at Harry. The stunner hit Harry clearly in the chest and he toppled out of view. Ron refrained from shouting after him, casting his own jinx that was neatly deflected. Rowle seemed to pay him no mind as he continued towards where Harry’s body had disappeared even after Ron had given up his place of safety, casting stunner after stunner, immobulus after immobulus, expelliarmus after expelliarmus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Avis!” he roared as a last resort and it was only at this that Rowle turned in confusion as the birds swarmed his head, pecking his face incessantly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rowle stumbled towards the open door, batting at the helpless conjured birds. “Ahh!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Petrificus Totalus!” Ron roared and Rowle finally crashed to the ground with a resounding thud. </span>
</p><p> </p>
