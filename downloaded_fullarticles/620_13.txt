    <p>'Away' was all Harry needed to be. All he wanted to be. Hogwarts had a great many mysterious and wondrous little corners and places to sit. Places to sit and just stare off in frustrated distance, wondering how to handle everything that had just gone down, how to emotionally process the utter exhaustion that came with opening himself up like this to pure frustration. In history, it would go down as the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. The beginning of the Second Wizarding War, the moment where the world and the Ministry could no longer pretend Harry hadn't been right. Voldemort had returned, and nobody could argue against it. Eleven Death Eats were cuffed and hauled off to Azkaban. But had it all been worth it? Had it been worth Sirius?</p><p>That much, Harry wasn't so sure of, as he sat there, staring up to the sky and trying to make sense of what was happening here, how he could possibly accept the result of that fight. He'd hoped sleep and a day of distance would help him out, but he didn't find it. It had been five days and still these nervous, winding heats haunted Harry. Dumbledore had no more words to say after debriefing him, and sent him off to rest. All his friends were okay, save of course for the fact Sirius was simply gone. But nothing felt okay. In the span of two years, a long-lost father figure had returned to Harry's life, the cool stepfather who would be there for him, and then died again. The first official casualty of a war. He hadn't even left a body. Nothing to mourn, nothing to bury. Just memories.</p><p>And the war's end sat with Harry. That much lingered extra harshly within him as he tried to coolly deal with the reality of what he'd been told. The prophecy said that Harry would defeat Voldemort. Harry, who wasn't even out school yet, barely an adult, barely ready for any of this. He was the one who would have to take down Voldemort; the idea terrified him, left Harry unsure what to say or how to feel about the idea that he could possibly do that. He just fell deeper into his tensions. Ever deeper. Ever harder. He didn't know how to make sense of this. He didn't know what to say or how to stand up for the idea that he was ready for this, that he ever should have been here. Why did this have to be his responsibility?</p><p>So deep in his own thoughts, Harry almost swung a fist behind him when words snapped him out of it. "Do you want to talk?" He turned around in a panic, eyes wide, hand going right to his wand as he looked upon the worried face of Hermione standing there before him. His response did nothing to make her worries ebb, and he couldn't say he blamed her. "If you want me to go, I can go. But it's been three hours since you 'went for a walk', and I thought you might use someone to talk to."</p><p>Harry relaxed, shifting back into the place he was, resting against the wall of the school that had become the only welcome home he knew. Until Sirius. Until Grimmauld Place had provided him something warm and familial. That was gone now. With a sigh, he tapped the space beside him. "Where's Ron?" he asked.</p><p>"In bed," Hermione sighed, taking her seat down beside Harry. "Where else would he be? He said you were fine and that you'd come back when you were ready, and with what Madame Pomfrey gave him for those welts he looked drowsy anyway."</p><p>"He's right, though," Harry said.</p><p>"About you being fine, or about you coming back when you were ready?" Hermione pressed firmer. "Because I don't think you're fine, and I'm not sure you're ever going to be ready."</p><p>A slow, frustrated sigh rumble on Harry's breath, lingering too long. "You're right, though," he said, changing his tune. He looked up to her, and he'd never seen an admission Hermione was right provide so little joy or response. "I don't know what to do, Hermione."</p><p>"I can't blame you. I don't think anyone would." An icy silence followed for a moment, Hermione adding, "But you aren't just anyone."</p><p>"Well can't I be? Can't I ever be? I'm not even allowed to an orphan with a stepfather who cares about him, I have to be the lonely, uncared for Chosen One who gets to watch everyone who cares about him die. It's exhausting." Sitting slumped against a wall wasn't the most productive or expressive place for Harry to be; he wished he could throw something, wished he had some way to express himself and vent his frustration. All he had was to turn his head toward Hermione. "I want to do something."</p><p>"Do what?" she asked. Hermione sounded ready. Open. She looked at Harry with a ready, nervous gaze. "I'm here for you. Here with you. I don't know if it's obvious yet, but whatever it takes, I'm right by your side until the end. You're not alone, I promise."</p><p>"I'm not going back to Privet Drive," Harry said. "Dumbledore says I have to. Says it's the only way to protect me. Something about magic; being around Aunt Petunia makes it so he can't hurt me. But I can't let that be my only protection anymore. Sirius was going to let me stay with him, and I've enjoyed this past summer more even than my time with the Weasleys. I'm not going back to somewhere I am feared and hated anymore. I'll return there for one afternoon to collect my things and maintain the magic for another year, but that's it. I'm not hiding from him."</p><p>"Are you saying you want to go to war right now?"</p><p>"This is already war." Harry felt a stir inside of him. Something strong and direct, something he hadn't expected. Each word he spoke felt like a deepening swell of something confident and ready. "I'm not marching up Voldemort and fighting him right now. But I'm going to do whatever it takes to make sure that he's stopped. I don't know how, but I own 12 Grimmauld Place. I will allow the Order of the Phoenix to keep using it, but I am living in my home and nobody can stop me. After that? I don't know yet."</p><p>"So you're going to play with fire in regards to the only sure magical protections keeping you alive, so that you can go your own way against everybody else's judgment to forge stubbornly ahead with a plan you don't even yet know the details of." The sardonic tension in Hermione's voice was chilling.</p><p>"Sound like a bad idea?"</p><p>Hermione had an answer ready, but it melted away, giving way to another answer, to something more warm and accepting. "It sounds like you're Harry Potter, and that I shouldn't expect anything less of you. We've never exactly known what we were doing with any of this, but we got by, didn't we? Listening to the warnings of people who 'knew better' would have only ever let darkness prevail."</p><p>"Ron would still keep a pet rat out of my parents' traitorous best friend," Harry agreed.</p><p>"I'll follow you wherever you want to go," she said, leaning her head down onto Harry's shoulder. "You've proven yourself by now, and I feel safe with you."</p><p>"After what happened to Sirius?"</p><p>"Sirius knew what he was doing, and he was one person. The rest of us got back in one piece, and I think you're more responsible for that than you realize." Hermione's hand found his. "And I don't just mean safe from physical dangers either." She held tighter onto his hand, smile widening as she pressed in snug against Harry, feelings of frustration and pressure rising slowly. "So if you're going off to do this, then I'm with you, every step of the way."</p><p>"Hermione, are you--" Harry couldn't finish that, cutting off abruptly and turning to Hermione, seeing her staring right at him, and felt an intense need to push taking hold of him. He leaned inward, grabbing Hermione, tugging her close against him and bringing his lips down upon hers, kissing her with a need and a hunger that felt hazy and infuriating. He didn't really understand how to deal with this need and the idea of just letting his feelings take hold of him. He'd never given in quite like this before, but now, Harry couldn't help himself. He turned inward, grabbing her, tugging her in close against him and pulling her into a kiss as hungry and as desperate as he could, allowing pleasure to ignite within him something untamable.</p><p>Hermione had been waiting for this. Hoping. He picked up on it, and now that she saw her chance, she just went for it, pressing her body firmly in against Harry's. She kissed him with deep, hungry intensity and let the tensions take her, pulling her down into the warmth and the comfort of his kiss. It was all the safety she meant, all the safety she needed, and Hermione felt herself filled with all the deep longing and hunger that she hadn't wanted to come here in pursuit of, but it happened, and she didn't exactly feel like fighting it.</p><p>As they kissed, they could both feel the tension in the other, the desperation calling out at long last to everything they had both wanted, a certainty and mutual desire that brought them both a sense of deep relief. Neither had been alone in these feelings, and now it was out in the world, open, ready, inducing a desperate sort of openness that held a special promise. Everything Harry felt was removed from all sense, but in ways that brought on a lot more feelings than he was prepared for; need held him, desperation and frustration bringing about a lot of desires and tensions all at once, and there was absolutely nothing that he wanted more now than Hermione.</p><p>But the kiss broke away too soon. Hermione drew away, frightened by what they had done and by the suddenness of how this had just happened. She didn't look ashamed, simply shaken. "We did that," she said, tense. "Harry, we just--"</p><p>"We just kissed," Harry said. "For a moment, I kind of.. I forgot all about Sirius, too. About everything. It felt nice."</p><p>"Harry, I... I don't want to suggest you forget about Sirius. Or about anything. But maybe, you need a moment to j--"</p><p>Another kiss. Harry initiated again. He needed to. This time, he pulled Hermione onto him, and she went happily, climbing into his lap in pursuit of pleasures and sensations that felt so much more intentional and desperate and hot, but which were all the more welcome for it. Both of them felt so needy and worn down, so desperate for something to hold onto and hold steady by. It drove their needs, drove the urgency of their kiss as they let it happen and let it take them away. Hermione offered up no complaint or hesitation, just kissing Harry as hard as she could, letting herself be wound up and worn down by the idea of kissing and losing themselves.</p><p>"I think I'm ready to go back to bed," Harry said, but as his hands tightened against her, Hermione knew what he meant, knew what he wanted.</p><p>And she welcomed it.<br/>
****************************<br/>
It wasn't Harry's bed that he returned to, as he pushed Hermione down against the covers, his hands now upon her. "Let me lose myself in you," he groaned, seizing at her clothes, grabbing her, seeking all the pleasures he could find in her, finding the truths of their intimacy and the lies promised by just forgetting about life for a moment and giving himself up to Hermione completely. His aggressive and needy kisses proved a desperate push into something hungry, desperate, wild, as intense and as lustful as could be.</p><p>"We've been waiting so long," Hermione moaned, her hands grasping Harry's strong chest, her head dizzy and aching. She had gone so long without him. Without this. The time had come now though, and Hermione was desperate to let this out, to embrace her lusts and her needs as hotly as she could get them. "Harry..." She didn't know what else to say or how to say it. Tugging him into another feverish kiss, Hermione sought only to feel him as thoroughly and utterly as she could, craving his touch and everything that came with it. "Show me all of your love."</p><p>After years of simmer tension and desperation, it was finally done. They had been children when they started. Five years later, they were adults. Ready. Grown and developed and different, and there was no reason to pretend any longer that growing up alongside one another hadn't ensured they were constantly watching the other's development in real time. Hermione was Harry's first crush, and those feelings had never dulled or grown calmer. He was hungrier now more than ever for Hermione, and he felt ready to open up to it and let the pleasures carry him away, let the sensations guide him into pure acceptance and a bliss as wild and exceptional as anything he could have ever fathomed.</p><p>Hands grabbed at Hermione's ample chest through her shirt, feeling her plump breasts, body pressing down against her ample form, her whole figure calling out to Harry, begging and defiant, pleading him to take charge, explore, tame her. Inside of harry lay so much pent up desperation and aggression, a need that was only deeper and hotter expressed by his desire to let everything go, to abandon reason and sense for the purposes of absolute surrender, smoldering desire and need burning up strongly inside of him. He felt her up while he tugged at her clothes, letting something more fiery and hungry bleed through this pleasure, allowing sensations to take hold of him that he wasn't sure exactly how to feel about, but he knew he needed them. </p><p>Hermione shifted in surprise under the desire and the heat of this situation, feeling Harry's hands upon her, so firm, so strong, so shameless. A strong and hungry need took hold of her powerfully, and she was unafraid of opening up to all of it, her own hands caressing along his body, finding pleasure and relief in the warm embrace of just holding him tight, holding him close. "There's a side of you I've always been curious about," she moaned. "And it feels like it's begging to be let out of you now. Show me, Harry. Let the pleasure take hold of us both." Hermione trembled with this need, with a want and a hunger that all felt like too much to deal with. She craved him, and she wanted to know what she was missing out on.</p><p>It was an invitation to let loose. To not feel bad about what he wanted to do to Hermione. How he wanted her. His hands grabbed at her body more aggressively as he tugged her clothes off, showing a bit more ferocity and a bit more unrelenting heat. It was all he really needed, and he felt the want take hold of him tighter, harsher, inducing pleasures was hungry and ferocious as anything he could have ever imagined. The pleasure was there, a swell of ferocious desire and heat that felt like everything he had been waiting to let out, and Hermione's invitation was only more hunger-inducing, inducing fierce needs and lusts that took hold of him tightly.</p><p>Hermione felt like she had to give in to this, had to accept and indulge, reaching for his pants, tugging them down and out of the way, seeking pleasure and embracing all of the most wild wants and needs that held so tightly onto her. Her hands reached for his cock, taking hold of it and finding herself overwhelmed by what she gasped, letting out a hot, wild gasp of something startled, something powerful and hot, unprepared for the pleasure awaiting her as she took him. "Harry," she moaned. Moaning his name was all she felt she could do, as Hermione's fingers fumbled about, grasping his cock, startled and overwhelmed by what she felt, by the size of his shaft, by the idea of letting herself succumb.</p><p>Shifting atop Hermione, Harry moved fiercely, ready to take charge and do whatever he felt he could to make this move, to take what was his. He left Hermione bare, her ample chest bare before his eager gaze as he shifted atop her. Hermione used her grip on his cock to guide him toward her entrance, toward a snug, slick hole waiting for his touch and desperately seeking pure bliss. He shifted forward and tightened up his posture, seizing her tits more firmly, seizing her lips with his, and happily gliding into the slick embrace of a pussy he all too immediately took charge pushing into. Hermione helped give him the initial pull, but once his head pushed past the soft, puffy lips that parted in eager welcoming of his touch, it was all Harry.</p><p>A powerful thrust forward drove him to the hilt inside of her, and Hermione let out a heated cry as she felt him. 'You're like a beast," she said, panting as he drew back and thrust forward again. There was a lot to take in very suddenly, but Harry presses in tighter against her lips and kept her from saying it, his hips working a very steady and aggressive pace that took no time at all to wind up into the aggression that he had spent so long holding back. There was no time to hold back now. No patience for it. Harry spent five agonizing years of his studies watching Hermione grow and fill out, maturing alongside her, developing into a gorgeous woman.</p><p>A woman now giving herself to him.</p><p>Hermione shifted under Harry's touch, moaning into the hungry kisses he paid her, as his thrusts filled her. His cock was incredible, feeling even bigger inside of her than it had felt in her hand, and she hadn't yet seen it, but she was certain he was absolutely gifted. As he pumped in and out of her, he filled her with an intensity that left her dizzy, stretching her out so much more than her own fingers ever could, and Hermione lamented how all of her curious self-exploration paled now in comparison to the thick cock pounding into her, picking up its pace with each careless thrust, each wild push into a deeper, hotter ecstasy.</p><p>"I've wanted to fuck you for years," Harry groaned. One of her hands drifted along his strong chest, and he let her touch him for a moment before pinning the wrist to the headboard, making her yelp ever more aware of his dominant strength. "And I'm sorry it won't be soft, but I can't do soft. I know I can't. Especially not tonight."</p><p>"Then fuck me like an animal instead," Hermione moaned, defiant and sultry as she embraced these unfettered thrills. "Show me the Harry who's spent so long cooped up inside, waiting to be let out. I want to see him. I want to be dominated by him." Hermione always had a sense there was something strong inside of Harry. Not a strength like he needed to carry on through tragedy, not a strength he needed to be a leader and live up to the expectations the world put upon him. A more masculine strength. A more sexual one. Harry felt his emotions, perhaps sometimes in excess, always so strongly existing and responding; his intense passion as a lover stood to reason, and it drove Hermione mad to know she was plunging into such heated, twisting ecstasy as she lay beneath him and saw confirmation of all those desires break out to the forefront.</p><p>Stronger, faster thrusts brought their bodies together in clashing, cacophonous delight, as without a kiss to seal them together, moans rang out more freely, more wildly. The passion reached its boiling point, and everything felt like too much to bear, as Hermione gave up to Harry and all the dizzy ecstasies that he promised her. Their bodies met with wild, bucking motions, refusing to let up as Hermione fell into the groove and did her best to feed into the dominant fervor Harry showed off, her moans growing more desperate and passionate with each shove forward.</p><p>To seal the deal of his longest standing crush with such wild and ferocious sex was the only thing now keeping Harry sane. Just as kissing Hermione had been a good way to forget all of his frustrations, fucking and dominating her brought out a side of him that felt welcome and hot, felt like the missing piece of a disastrous, messy puzzle that he had to do his best to put together. The chaos and frenzy of this situation made for something unwieldy and hot, and he was stuck doing his best to try and satisfy the weird, dizzy cravings upon him, but it was all easier said than done, as he learned his way through a deeper sense of confusion and mystery.</p><p>After all the time they'd spent awkwardly dancing around the subject, now it was done. They were fucking. All their feelings laid out. Reciprocated. Laid out and answered with raw, hard sex, Harry's balls smacking down against her with each hilting slam into her. There was no way to keep anything subtle or ambiguous now, no way to pretend there was much left to do but act on these wild feelings, two adults now ready to make the decisions they had been toying with for so long, and they were completely unashamed of surrendering to all of it, unable to hold back the chaos and the desire of this twisted mess.</p><p>"You know what I'm going to ask for," Hermione whined, clinging to Harry tightly, her free hand squeezing at his back.</p><p>"I don't care, say it anyway," Harry growled. "Beg for it." He knew. His cock throbbed inside of her needy pussy as it tightened down around him, and he was utterly unashamed of keeping up this pace, fucking Hermione with a wild sense of unrestrained ecstasy and wanting to make her lose herself.</p><p>"Cum inside," Hermione whimpered, clutching him tighter.</p><p>"I can't hear you, you'll have to speak up." Harry wanted to milk this moment for all he could.</p><p>Outright screaming now to plead Harry to give her what she wanted, Hermione gave in. "Please, cum inside!" The confidence behind her words shook her; Hermione couldn't believe she was giving in like this, begging Harry to cum in her, but she felt such power in accepting her fate and letting go of herself, and she needed more of it.</p><p>A few more wild thrusts were all Harry needed, but Hermione was right behind him, her pussy clamping down around his cock and everything lining up just perfectly in hose final seconds of pure, throbbing ecstasy. The pleasure was too much to bear for either of them, as Hermione wrapped herself around Harry, and Harry in turn pinned her down to the bed and pumped her full of cum, creampied her with a need to take and to claim; she knew this wasn't just release, knew it him making a statement, and as she twisted underneath him, she was happy to give up to all of it.</p><p>"You're mine," he growled, his glasses askew on his face and his green eyes staring lustfully at her.</p><p>"I'm yours," she agreed. "I knew you had a dominant side, but I never could have imagined... Oh my god, Harry. And the size of your cock..." She was too breathless to form coherent thoughts. "It's so much. I'm so happy."</p><p>"I always had my doubts. Even if you liked me, you're such a strong willed girl, I was afraid you'd find out how I liked to fuck and immediately be repelled by it; I don't know how to turn it down." He let go of her wrist and brought his hand across her cheek slowly, caressing it and staring down at her smile. "Even now, looking at you, all I can think about is having that mouth worship my cock."</p><p>Biting her lower lip, Hermione felt a little dizzy. "I'm surprised I like it so much, too. But I do, and the idea of letting you take control, letting you have me however you want... It excites me. Maybe I like the idea of giving up control, and not being the brainy genius girl who knows everything." She purred, reached down toward their groins and grasping his cock. "Maybe I want a man to hold me down, tell me what to do, and fuck me until I can't think, when I trust him enough to know he's good to me. Maybe I want to worship the cock of the most amazing man I've ever met." She smiled, drawing slowly back away from him.</p><p>Harry had nothing even resembling slowness in mind, and he moved swiftly to tug Hermione into position, leaving her startled and frayed as he lay where she had been, and she was now on her stomach between his legs, coming face to face with the huge cock standing rigid at attention in front of her. "If you want to submit, then prove it. Don't be a tease biting your lip and giving me 'maybes'. Submit to me, Hermione. Worship my cock and praise it with that mouth that's always saying so many strong, smart things. You're a great woman, but even you can't resist, can you?" His words picked up in intensity and harshness, figuring she was into it, pushing his luck and the boundaries all without any real care or control, to confident now in himself.</p><p>"I can't resist," Hermione whined. Her tongue dragged along his massive shaft, and her eyes almost went cross. "Even strong as I am, I want to submit to this monster cock." Deeper Hermione fell, finding a love of just surrendering herself to him, as she licked along his shaft, as she gave up to the idea of completely accepting the desperation and the fervor of her words. Kisses grew hungrier and more direct, more intense, as a deep sense of surrender washed over her, as Hermione found that there was a need inside of her too powerful to ignore or deny. Everything just felt so direct and so powerful, a desperation bringing about pleasure in a form too wild and unbelievable to handle, and it was to their mutual benefit now that she just give in to it all.</p><p>Aggressive licks all over his cock brought Harry an intense delight, as he melted against the mattress groaning in appreciation. "How does my cock taste?" he asked, fingers tangling into the unruly mess of Hermione's bushy hair. "And how does your cunt taste all over my cock?" he had to push further, had to test the limits desperately, seeking more pleasure and more indulgence, wanting to feel all of it. He was in Hermione Granger's bed getting his dick worshiped, and the idea this could truly happen was an absolute delight, a bliss he needed more of as he pushed, explored, tested what he could get away with, delighted to find so far she accepted all of it.</p><p>"They taste so good," Hermione whined, her tongue trying to drag up every drop of her own tart juices in pursuit of this strange situation, a desire only getting better and hungrier as she let it happen. "I need more of it." She hadn't ever thought a cock could stir these feelings inside of her, never thought she could be so conflicted and desperate a mess, but she chased this pleasure on deeper, hotter, further down into ruin and destruction, a sense of senselessness that only grew stronger as she let the pleasures tear her asunder. Harry was always the man that she could have fallen into a submissive devotion to, and his cock simply proved it.</p><p>Her lips wrapped around the head, and she pushed hungrily down, chasing the desire and desperation deeper and messier, pushing into something that felt unruly and a little bit too rough to deal with, pleasures inducing something spectacular, something so powerful and desperate that it almost didn't make a lot of sense. Her head pushed down, forcing so much of the girthy cock into her mouth, and she was startled to find she could even fit it all, pushing on a bit deeper, moaning around his shaft, hands grasping the base to keep it steady as she fumbled about with the idea of letting this all happen, of letting herself give in. The idea of accepting and surrendering seemed so unruly and bizarre, an insanity that she felt unprepared to handle, but in truth it was all she wanted.</p><p>"Deeper. Suck it deeper down. If you really want to worship my cock, I want to feel your throat." He applied force to the back of her head, which was pushing his luck if anything was, but she accepted it, graciously deepthroating Harry, choking him down and struggling to deal with him, but she was do determined that nothing could stop her. Her eyes sank half-closed with sultry delight, a sight that had Harry struggling to keep himself together, finding out just how much pleasure he could find in making Hermione his. "You're gorgeous right now. Setting a dangerous precedent, 'Mione. Now that I know I can take out all my frustrations on you and do the things I've only fantasized about doing, I'm going to put you through your paces."</p><p>The idea there was a way to escalate from this left Hermione dizzy. She sucked faster, greedily slurping him down deep, forcing herself to become capable of handling his big dick no matter what it took. She had to learn, had to obey and fall into line, sucking faster, greedier, appreciating the pleasure of just submitting to his demands, servicing his dick and letting all other thoughts wash away. This was already a distraction for Harry, why not for her too? Letting go of herself and blanking out her thoughts, Hermione let her focus and devotion to Harry's cock speak to all that she needed, and she allowed that pleasure to carry her away, stronger and hotter as she found a deep sense of pure excitement washing through her body, leaving her completely focused now on him and only him.</p><p>Up and down her head bobbed. Once she let the pace and the focus carry her away, Hermione was steady, moving fluidly and with a relaxed throat making fewer noises of struggle. She felt so free and so open now, servicing Harry firmer and more confidently, a heat and a desire bringing about something potent and nigh unstoppable. Harry's hips started upward, thrusting into the loving embrace of her mouth, and that only further served to ignite untamable desires inside her, as he fucked her mouth steadily and fed into this pleasure. The fire was overwhelming, and Hermione's reckless, slobbering pace felt like a deep, reverent ode to a desperation burning inside her hotter than anything ever had before.</p><p>"You're so good at sucking cock," Harry groaned, pushing faster, pressing in against her and seeking absolute ruin. "You're great, Hermione. The perfect fucking woman. Stacked, brilliant, and an absolute delight in bed. Give me more, suck it all down, I'm going to pump my load down your throat and you're going to thank me for it!" The pleasures were too much for Harry. Too much in too many directions and bringing about so many sensations that somehow didn't feel conflicted or torn; all Harry wanted was to fuck Hermione's mouth into submission, and he found that it was all easy to give in to, losing ground to the spectacular thrills of ecstasy that all burned with singular focus. Hermione was his now, and he felt no qualms about seizing what he wanted from her.</p><p>Submission felt incredible. Hermione was delirious, sloppily gagging on the cock thrusting into her mouth, body heaving and swaying in the uncontrollable rush of desires becoming a bigger, needier mess with each steadily rising second. She took this on, feeling an odd pleasure in surrendering to his desires, serving his lusts and his most reckless needs, unable to control her mad spiral downward, unable to keep from giving everything up Harry and his expectations of her, no matter how depraved and wicked they were. Her cravings for more overwhelmed everything else inside of her, and she was left in deep, adoring service now to Harry's cock and her most wild appetites.</p><p>Harry made good on his promise, as his hands tugged at her hair and he forced her down to the base of his cock, one final, primal show of dominance driving him deep into the ecstasy of pumping his load right down Hermione's throat, making her tremble and heave under the frustrations and the pleasures of a situation completely removed from sense or control. Every throb of his cock brought on a messy, gooey gush of seed that splattered against the back of her throat, taught her a twisted sense of acceptance and lust that deepened her appreciation of everything he was doing to her and the ways in which she felt she simply had to burn.</p><p>Hermione dutifully accepted every drop down her gullet, before pulling back and giving him what he wanted to hear. "Thank you," she moaned, biting her lip and allowing the rumbling need inside of her to take utter hold. "It was my pleasure to service your cock. I hope I did a good job."</p><p>"You did a great job," Harry said, taking hold of his shaft and dragging it along her lips, which prompted moans and teasing licks from Hermione. "So well that I think you'll be taking it on a responsibility from now on. Whenever I'm hard, you're going to be taking care of it."</p><p>"You're hard right now," Hermione said, her breath remaining tight and wild.</p><p>"It is," Harry said. "So what are you waiting for? Come sit on it so I can watch those big tits bounce."<br/>
******************************<br/>
Lying in the tense, still emptiness of the afterglow, Harry and Hermione were exhausted, lying in desperate, wasted bliss after hours of raw fucking, just holding on to one another and thinking about the matter before them.</p><p>"Should I have said I loved you before I pinned you down and started thrusting?" Harry asked, breaking the silence with a soft question as his fingers teased through her hair. Well, sort of soft; after the things he'd said and done to her, it was downright sappy by comparison.</p><p>"Mm, I assumed from the moment you kissed me that you loved me, but if you feel you need to say it, I won't complain." Hermione nestled into Harry's neck, resting an arm over his strong chest as she kept herself in tight against him.</p><p>"I love you, Hermione Granger," he said. "And having you here for me tonight has only made me love you more."</p><p>It was something she'd waited a while to say. He got to it at his own pace, and that was all she needed. "I love you too, Harry Potter."</p><p>"It's a lot easier to face what I want to do with you by my side," he said, holding her in close against his body. "I don't know how yet, but with your smarts, I don't see a way we can't win. You're the best ally anyone could ask for." His arm tugged her in tighter, and he let his words express his desires and his lusts as directly as anything could. Harry saw the opportunity now before him more powerfully and potently than anything he could have imagined. "If you have any idea of where to start, I'm all ears."</p><p>Hermione took a moment to think. "What is your plan so far?"</p><p>"As much as I've told you; visit the Dursleys for safety's sake, gather up a few things, and then head to Grimmauld Place. I'm hoping that there's something in the house that might be useful, an old relic or heirloom with some kind of value. Or a book. Anything. We can organize better when we're working out of a proper base of operations. But until then, I want to keep quiet; any Slytherin who hears it might report back, and if I try to confront Dumbledore about it now, it will only cause a scene. I don't want him to have a choice or a chance to talk me out of anything. And once we are at Grimmauld Place, I want to have a proper service for Sirius."</p><p>"That's a good start. We need more, but I like where it goes. I'll want to go visit my parents too, but we should settle in at home first."</p><p>"Home," Harry said, closing his eyes. "You called it home."</p><p>"With you, it will be."<br/>

A plume of choking dust puffed off of the mirror with one big gust, winds stirring through the dingy basement and sending boxes tumbling over, the amassed depths of the Black family storage a cramped and claustrophobic mess of generations' worth of belongings packed away and stuffed into as tight a space as possible. Nobody ever threw anything out in the Black family, just packed it away, just left it to rot in the dismal depths of a basement that nobody paid any mind to. It was where the past was buried, and especially for the last owner of the house, Sirius, the past was something to tear down and ignore, abandon, leave as a lingering reminder entombed away forever from the dismal truth of what he had lived.</p><p>The wind changed all that, sent things crashing about in all directions, clearing space before the tall, gaudy mirror standing firm at the very back of the room, not hung onto a wall but utterly embedded inside of it. It throbbed and thrummed, glowing powerfully as the tarp thrown over it was cast aside and pushed off toward the wall, and everything in the room took on a sickly bright shine, just in time for the mirror to forcibly repel someone from within its glass.</p><p>Raven hit the floor hard, ripped from her meditative trance and shouting in utter panic as she was thrown from the mirror and sent hurdling into a mess of boxes, the pain sudden and her head dizzy as she tried to make sense of what was going on. She didn't know where she was, but she could feel the wrongness take hold, feel the lack of any grounding or even connection to her own powers here; she stumbled up to her feet, only to crush another box and end up sinking into it, falling back over to the floor again with a humiliating gracelessness.</p><p>All the commotion hadn't gone unnoticed by the people upstairs. Wands drawn, Kingsley and Tonks barged down the basement steps in a panic, worried there was some sort of breach and attack on the way amid all the loud clanging and crashing. What they saw, then, was far more curious and confusing than any of that, staring now upon the dizzy wreck of a half-conscious girl with gray skin and a blue cape lying on the floor. Neither auror thought about what they were doing; they simply acted, throwing a stunning spell onto the intruder and making her body go stiff while they fumbled about in search of some indication of what was wrong.</p><p>But the mirror had done its part, and it sat perplexingly clean but unspectacular in every other way, its exposure and the silvery sheen of its flawless surface not even catching the eye of the aurors scrambling about for signs of apparation or some sort of physical ingress.</p>
