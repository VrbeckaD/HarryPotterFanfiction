    <p>CHAPTER ONE<br/>
Draco’s POV</p><p><br/>
I moaned.</p><p>Whoever was giving me this blowjob, he was good. We were in a dark alleyway just behind a gay-muggle bar, I picked up this stranger just 10 minutes ago, and here we are. The guy, giving me one hell of a blowjob, and me, moaning like my life depended on it, when I finally came, the guy stood up and met my sucked on my neck, if possible, I moaned even louder.</p><p>“Want to take this to my apartment?”</p><p>“Oh gods yes” I moaned out. Fuck, I am such a slut, I didn’t even know anything about the guy except for his skills with his mouth.</p><p>I felt myself being led out of the dark alleyway and put into a car¬- a taxi, I think. When we did arrive at the guy’s apartment, my mind was already too wasted to remember the night.<br/>
_<br/>
It was still dark, there was light snoring beside me, the bed was uncomfortable and the guy I recall nothing off was a cuddler. How disgusting.<br/>
Very carefully, I woke up, searched for my clothes and without even bothering to put my pants on, I apparated back to my apartment.<br/>
My hangover and the queasiness of the apparition did not mix well, not to mention the fact that I was only in my underwear, made for a very uncomfortable arrival at my own apartment. Stumbling upon my kitchen, I fumbled looking for the cabinet I put my potions in. When I finally found my hangover potion and drank it, a very condescending and very familiar voice spoke.</p><p>“Well, well, well. Look who finally decided to grace me with his presence.”</p><p>Pansy</p><p>I internally groaned. I was not in the mood for any of her shenanigans.</p><p>“What?” I snapped at her.</p><p>“What do you mean ‘what’? Do you have any idea what yesterday was Draco? Do you even know what today is?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fairly certain it’s Sunday, July 7th, or am I mistaken?”</p><p>I only go out during Saturdays, I didn’t want my hook-ups to affect my job as a senior financial analysis.</p><p>“You knowing the date shouldn’t make you proud, Draco. It just makes you look like more of a bastard.”</p><p>“Pansy, I am just recovering from a pretty huge hangover, would you please get to the point?”</p><p>“How about, instead of snapping at me, you should think very very carefully about what July 6th was.”</p><p>July 6, I thought very carefully what event I might have missed to have such a reaction from Pansy. July, the notable event I know happening this month was the engagement of Blaise and the Weaselette… oh.</p><p>“Oh”</p><p>“Is that it? Oh? Blaise is your best friend Draco, next to me, and you just fucking missed one of the most important days of his life. And for what, a quick fuck?”</p><p>“How’d you know it was quick?” was my only retort.</p><p>“Draco, what the hell is happening with you? I know that the break-up was hard Draco but it shouldn’t be any reason for you to destroy your life.”</p><p>“Shut it, Pansy. This has nothing to do with the break-up. I missed Blaise’ engagement party because I had my cock being swallowed by a guy behind an alley. This has nothing to do with my break-up with Potter.”</p><p>“Keep telling yourself that. We don’t see you anymore, Draco. You go to your job, work 9 hours a day, then go home, eat then sleep, repeat. On weekends, you go to any gay bar you find and drink yourself to oblivion. The engagement party was planned for months and Blaise was disappointed to see that his best man wasn’t even there.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll make it up to him, Pans. Okay? I’ll buy him a fucking gift or something.”</p><p>“NO! We are having a make-up party tonight and you will be attending. We’ve invited friends and family only, so yes, Harry will be there. And since you’re so over him, you will attend the party, act like a fucking normal human being, and make Blaise happy.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you leave now?”</p><p>“I’m picking you up at seven, be ready by then!”<br/>
Pansy was always a drama queen, even being a witch, she couldn’t apparate or floo out like a normal one instead she makes a show of turning her back to me and slamming my apartment’s front door.</p><p>To be honest, I didn’t really care about the engagement party, if they wanted me to attend, they shouldn’t have invited Potter, not after what he did. Did they honestly expect me to interact with him after what he did? It’s been months since our explosive and huge argument that led to him breaking up with me, yet they already expect me to be over it. People who never knew me, I would’ve expected their reactions, the way they think that I am just overacting. But, from my own friends, who knew that I was always half in love with the bastard since I was 14, it was a bit hurtful for them to think that a mere 10 months would be enough to get over a man I loved since I was young.</p><p>It hurts. That’s why I am lashing out at them, missing appointments, dinners, even parties. It’s not childish, they’re the ones who are, inviting Potter and his golden boy toy to every party that they attend, mingling with his friends, knowing just how much it hurts him just to see them.</p><p>I am not attending the party tonight, no matter the consequence; I didn’t want to see him and his boyfriend who was such a perfect fit for him. An upgrade, the prophet said, from death eater to his perfect match. Our savior finds who he deserves. I remember the fucking article, and just below the title were Potter and his new boyfriend, Leo, wasn’t it? The Potter in the photo looked so happy or as Rita Skeeter printed, as happy as he deserves to be.</p><p>I remember the sting of the article. I was still sulking at that time, two months after our break-up, when suddenly there was an influx of owls arriving at my doorstep. Reading the article, I knew why, so many hate messages just popped out. I read them all, all 1076 of them, not a single one positive. No one commented on how Potter, their golden-boy, had just cheated on me 2 months prior, no one even thought of how broken your heart had to be when you open the newspaper and see a well-shagged brunette, behind a clearly satisfied boyfriend of yours.<br/>
No one knew the pain of being shouted at that you’ve been embarrassing your boyfriend for months now, how you were acting so weird, it was disturbing.<br/>
No. Instead, they’ll tell you just how happy they are that their golden boy had moved on, how he deserves so much better than a filthy death eater. Your friends will tell you that if you truly love him, you’ll be happy seeing him happy, cause that’s just how love works. That you weren’t supposed to insult their new boyfriend, that you’re not allowed to make snide comments at him no matter how true, cause you love him and you’re supposed to be happy seeing him happy. What a load of crap.<br/>
I am not attending that fucking party. I’d rather find someone to fuck me rather than watch Potter making lovey-dovey eyes with the fucking love of his life.<br/>
And with that thought, I dragged myself up to my bedroom and collapse on my bed.<br/>
_<br/>
“DRACO! WAKE THE FUCK UP!”</p><p><br/>
It was Pansy again. I heard her voice before I felt my pillows being pulled from under me.</p><p>“What the fuck, Draco? Wake up. It’s already 5 pm and I need you to get ready for the party.”</p><p>“Mmnnotgoing” I mumbled.</p><p>“WHAT?” she was shouting louder now, it made my ears and my head hurt.</p><p>“I said I’m not going.” I answered back.</p><p>“Over my dead body, Draco. Blaise is expecting you to be at his engagement party.”</p><p>“The party was yesterday. I already missed it, no point in going now. Besides, I told you I’ll buy him an apology gist or something.”</p><p>“Draco. WAKE THE FUCK UP OR I’M DRAGGING YOU TO THAT PARTY WEARING WHAT YOU’RE WEARING RIGHT NOW.”</p><p>“Pans, shut the fuck up, okay? If you want me to go to the damned party then don’t invite Potter.”</p><p>“He’s a friend of the future bride, you can’t expect to kick him out of a friends very important day.”</p><p>“He attended yesterday, didn’t he? And I wasn’t there, so how ‘bout I go today and he’ll not be there?”</p><p>“Draco, you’re being ridiculous. I thought you were over him already.”</p><p>“I am, am just not over the fucking humiliation he caused me.”</p><p>“Honestly Draco, you act like you’re the fucking queen, and you wonder why he cheated?”</p><p>I froze upon hearing those words.</p><p>“What?” I said, anger coursing through my veins.</p><p>“You heard me Draco. Whatever Potter did to you, it was partially or entirely your fault. You act like a fucking drama queen, but this past year, you’ve been acting like the whole universe revolves around you and you’re every need. You require Potter to be at your beck and call yet you can’t even offer him a bit of assurance that you feel something for him. We’ve been watching, Draco, how you’ve treated him the last few months before your break-up and if you weren’t so wrapped up into your own world, you would’ve seen the signs before Skeeter even printed out that article.”</p><p>“So what are saying? That you’ve known about Harry cheating on me, and you didn’t bother to tell me.” I was yelling at her now, in the past few months we had a lot of major arguments, this would be the biggest one.</p><p>“NO! I didn’t know but there were a lot of clues Draco! A whole lot of them, and if you didn’t have head stuck in your arse then you would have noticed too.”</p><p>“GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!”</p><p>And she did. And once again, I was left to my thoughts.</p><p>I was still in my bedroom, contemplating what next to do with the wreck that was my life.</p><p>In a moment of weakness, I brought out my wand and whispered, “<em>Revelio</em>”</p><p>Immediately, the ceiling I was looking at disappeared, instead what stared back at me were papers.</p><p>
  <em>We’re so happy for the Chosen One finally choosing the right one.</em>
</p><p><br/>
Articles</p><p>
  <em>You don’t deserve our hero, you death eater.</em><br/>
<em>Fucking shitty death eater, how dare you taint our Savior</em>
</p><p>Letters</p><p>
  <em>He finally found someone he’s happy with.</em><br/>
<em>We’re glad he cheated on you.</em>
</p><p>When I cast the revelio, what it revealed to me was the truth. My truth. The truth I have been collecting for years. Articles, letters, anything that showed me my truth. That Harry Potter, golden boy, savior, and auror, could never be with Draco Malfoy, death eater and scum of the wizarding society. But even so, even with my truth presented in front of me, I answered yes when he asked me out the first time, the second time, third time and so on. I was doing so well in pretending that the truth wasn’t in front of me, if it weren’t for that incident a few months ago, I would have been fine pretending a little longer.</p><p>Ah. That incident, I remember it so clearly, it’s like it was imprinted into my mind.</p><p>Harry was gone on an undercover mission for the past two months, that day was my birthday. After the celebration held by my friends, they all went home, it was already midnight but I was feeling a bit lonely due to his lacking presence. It was then that I made the worst decision ever. I went to a bar.<br/>
During my time there, I just sat and looked at other people, I hated being lonely so I went to a place full of people. Then someone approached me, I recognized him as one of Harry’s coworkers, Jenkins, I think. He was someone that hated Harry, or was always trying to undermine Harry’s work ever since he became an auror. During the workplace party Harry brought me too, I met him and took an instant dislike to the man, he was too boisterous, loud and prideful, even when he didn’t have anything to be proud of.<br/>
Jenkins approached me and tried to talk to me, to which I responded with a string curses directed at him and his entire family tree. He just smirked at me and left. I, on the other hand, proceeded to drink the drink I was holding. Later on just as I left the bar and exited from the backdoor, I walked towards the nearest apparition point, just as I was about to apparate, I blacked out.<br/>
I woke to a whole new different feeling. I was watching through my eyes, but I could not control my body. Jenkins was in front of me, laughing and then he proceeded to explain my situation.<br/>
He had drugged me! With a newly developed drug called ‘Altasia’, it made the drugged one aware of what’s happening yet unable to control their own body, like he would be able to torture me and I would feel the pain however I would not be able to fight back, instead I would only do what my body is told to do, if it was told to moan, it would. I was so scared that I though he was going to torture me, instead he did something worse.</p><p><br/>
<em>“That means if I raped you, you’d only be able to moan in pleasure no matter how rough I would be wouldn’t I?”</em>
</p><p>I was so terrified when he said that, but I really could not move my own body. So when he ravaged me that night, I could feel the pain of his penetration for he did not prepare me but instead rammed into me like the animal he was. All I felt was pain, no pleasure. However when he whispered into my ear to moan, my body did so. He took out a muggle device and started recording me. It was one of the most horrifying experience of my life and all I could do was take it and beg the heavens for Harry to come save me. Unfortunately, my savior was halfway across the world hunting down criminals. When he was done violating me, all I could do was think of revenge, I was exhausted, in pain and all I could was cry inside as my body followed his orders. All I could think off was when I finally be able to press a charge on him and let the aurors do their work. But I celebrated too early.</p><p><br/>
He made me stand, and said a letter, S, I think. Then a hooded figure came into the room, I don’t know where he came from, or how he came into the room, then he made my body held out its arm and ordered it to agree to whatever the hooded figure say.</p><p><br/>
They performed an unbreakable vow so that I should never be able to tell anyone of what happened tonight, not verbally, or through written messages, encoded ones weren’t allowed too. The covered every base as to ensure I would never be able to tell anyone of what happened tonight, if I did, I break the unbreakable vow and die.<br/>
That night signaled the start of the fall of my relationship with Harry. After that night, I was always so fucking scared of going out, of being alone, at random moments when I get a minor panic attack, I would call out on Harry, sometimes even disturbing his work, I wouldn’t allow him to go to work cause I was anxious since he was there, I wouldn’t allow him to go outside because it was unsafe, it was a very very rough time for me. Harry tried to be understanding but it seemed my antics got to him eventually. I wouldn’t go out on dates with him, I wouldn’t sleep with him and I refuse to even accompany him to the burrow or to other sorts of gatherings, I would always insist that they should be the ones to visit us. I was always worried and it seemed that I didn’t give much of my attention to Harry as a few months later, I opened the daily prophet to see Harry Potter and a well shagged man coming out of a hotel room.</p><p>Devastated should be the word to describe what I was. Angry was another one.</p><p>We broke up that very night and his words still echo in my ear. ‘I have been humiliated by you for months. You’ve shown nothing to indicate that you even want a relationship with me, you don’t even want to touch me. You act like a complete arse and indicate no reason as to why we should tolerate you….”<br/>
I can’t remember the rest of what he said, all I know was that after we broke up, things started to fall apart. I started fighting with my aunt and my mother, we’re not on talking terms right now and it seems that I’ve just pissed off the last of my friends.</p>
