  <u>Paraselenae</u>
</p><p> </p><p>It starts, as these things often do, with blood.</p><p>A nosebleed to be precise, nothing too dramatic. Remus doesn’t even realise he’s bleeding until he tastes it: hot, salty, rust-red, creeping into the corner of his mouth. He runs his tongue over his lips, curiously, then touches his face. The fingers come away wet, a dark scarlet.</p><p>“Oh,” he mutters quietly, surprised. He’s quite drunk, he supposes.</p><p>It’s the week before the Christmas break and they’re all squeezed into their favourite wooden booth at The Three Broomsticks - himself and Sirius on one side, James and Peter on the other. The new landlady Rosmerta has decked out the pub more opulently than usual: garlands of glittery holy, mistletoe and tinsel cover the walls, and tiny enchanted reindeer and Santa zoom through the air at regular intervals, a clever but moderately inconvenient air hazard. Almost the whole of Hogwarts from fifth year and above are here, even some of the teachers, and there’s an insidious rumour going around the establishment that a Christmas karaoke might be on the cards.</p><p>“I’m absolutely not taking part unless we get to choose our own songs,” says James passionately, slapping his open palm down on the wooden table to make his point and causing several empty Butterbeer glasses to quake in agreement.</p><p>“Prongs, I hate to break it to you, but I don’t think you wailing along to The Smiths is really going to put anyone in a festive mood, yeah?” says Sirius, a half-mocking smile on his face. He shrugs off his leather jacket, runs a hand through his thick dark hair and positions himself so he’s leaning nonchalantly out of the booth, surveying the crowds of students in a vaguely disinterested manner. Remus knows this trick all too well, in fact he’s seen Sirius deploy it to varying degrees of success at breakfast, in the Common Room, during Defence Against the Dark Arts, whilst watching Quidditch - basically anywhere he can draw admiring glances and possibly make extended eye contact.</p><p>Peter speaks suddenly, his voice slightly shrill, and leans forward across the table to prod him on the arm. “Moony! You’ve got a nosebleed. Blimey that’s a lot of blood.”</p><p>“Oh yeah. Thanks, Peter,” he says, calmly. He’d forgotten, how silly of him.</p><p>He reaches down into his bag and rootles around, trying to find his wand - or was it in his cloak pocket? - when Sirius turns to him, his wand already out. </p><p>“Here, let me,” he says briskly. A simple spell, and the blood vanishes, Sirius smiles briefly in satisfaction. “There, that was easy.”</p><p>James shouts, “Panic averted!” and everyone gets back to drinking and criticising his music taste. It’s fine, really, and everyone is festive and happy and normal. Remus leans against the corner of the booth and finishes his Butterbeer quietly. Perhaps if he drinks enough, he’ll forget why he’s keen to drink this much in the first place. Because he can feel it creeping at the corner of his mind already, can sense the danger of it spilling over into his conscious thought. And he doesn’t want to think about anything much, not tonight.</p><p>Sirius is pretending to be Morrissey now, twisting his North London accent into an awful Mancunian one, giving a heartfelt emotional speech about animal rights and Christmas, about how if James were a true Smiths fan, he would help save all the turkeys from being killed by house elves. Peter is helpless with laughter, caught in between the two of them, spectating. It’s only when Sirius breaks into an awful rendition of <em>There is a Light That Never Goes Out</em> that James swipes at him with one hand, telling him that he’ll never understand the artistry of the lyrics, because he only listens to shouty angry music that doesn’t mean anything, and also that he sounds fucking Scottish and nothing like Morrissey anyway, so why can’t he just shut the fuck up?? And it’s only when Sirius leans back against the booth and barks explosively with laughter for a good five seconds that Remus can see past him to the pub entrance, can see that the door has been blown wide open and a large crowd of Ravenclaws have just entered amid flurries of snow. And of course, in the middle of them, because Remus was never going to escape him for long, and because he’s popular and pretty and basically the life of the party - is Felix.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>
  <em>He wished he knew why that Ravenclaw kept looking at him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was the day before Halloween and he was in the library, researching his project into werewolf subculture. James, Sirius and Peter had taken the secret passage to Honeydukes in their attempt to steal some caramelised mead for the party in the common room on Samhain. He’d told them that the whole idea was stupid and irresponsible and that they were bound to get caught, but they had merely laughed at him, and Sirius had even said, snidely, “Why don’t you put us all in detention then?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>To be honest, he was sick the lot of them right now. James and Sirius were just too unbearably arrogant at times, and he found it greatly irritating the way Peter ran after them like an adoring puppy, as completely uncritical as always. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Well, he didn’t care if they laughed at him - he wasn’t going to fail his NEWTs because of their stupid antics. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Maybe that was why the Ravenclaw boy kept looking at him, because he was hardly ever seen out of the company of his friends? He stole a glance at the boy, who was sitting opposite him at one of the library’s long mahogany tables. He had an innocent-looking, freckled face, sandy blond hair that flopped in a charming sort of way over his forehead, and a well-polished prefect badge that glinted on one side of his chest. Remus rubbed ineffectually at his own dull, tarnished badge, pinned to the front of his cardigan. Seeming to sense Remus’s gaze, the boy looked up suddenly, and their eyes met. A shy smile spread over the Ravenclaw’s face and Remus’s stomach contracted strangely. Blushing, he looked away quickly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He attempted unsuccessfully to lose himself in his research once again, but realised after a few minutes that it was better to concede momentary defeat. Limbs itching and mind buzzing, he grabbed a piece of parchment with a list of references and made his way into the tall aisles of books, trying to concentrate on finding the particular study on werewolf sociology that he needed to complete his essay. Why, exactly, did his insides suddenly feel like a bowl of Flobberworms? He passed the section on dangerous magical creatures and walked to the end of the aisle, eventually finding the slim book tucked away at the very top of the shelf. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Do you need some help?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus whirled around, his wand raised. It was the Ravenclaw boy. He must have followed him into the shelves. Remus’s heart contracted - had the boy seen that he had been researching werewolves? And that he was now searching in the lycanthropy and anthropology section?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh! No thanks, I’m fine,” he said, lowering his wand and trying to keep his voice casual. He decided to play it cool - there was a chance that the boy didn’t suspect anything. Then why was he looking at him so strangely?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I just thought you might need some help,” the boy repeated, giving him a meaningful look. He took a step closer to Remus, smiling shyly. Remus frowned, confused. The boy couldn’t be stupid, he was a Ravenclaw prefect. Did he just have bad hearing?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“My name’s Felix,” said the boy, taking another step forwards. They were standing very close together now, and Remus’s mouth suddenly felt very dry, his limbs awkward and heavy. He opened his mouth to introduce himself, but somehow couldn’t quite get the words out. Felix’s eyes flickered over Remus’s lips, and then over his hand, still clutching the wand at his side. “Are you going to put that away?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus frowned, his heart beating fast. “Why?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Because,” said Felix, stepping right up to him and taking the lapels of his open cardigan in both hands, “it might get in the way.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then his lips touched Remus’s. Remus froze, in a state of shock. He had only ever kissed one person before - Mary McKinnon, at last year’s Quidditch Final afterparty, and that had been a very brief and very drunken experience. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>So, it was definitely the shock of it that prevented him from pushing Felix away, from cursing him into oblivion. And it was definitely the shock that made him stow his wand in his pocket, and let Felix press him back up against the shadowy bookcase. And it was possibly also the shock that caused his hands to grip the front of Felix’s robes, and to kiss him back, tentatively at first, but then deeply, with his eyes closed.</em>
</p><p align="center">*</p><p>
  <em>After that, he knew. It had possibly been easier, he thought, as he sat in the Common Room with James, Sirius and Peter later that evening, half-listening to their conversation - possibly easier, as a werewolf, to pretend that his condition was the only thing that separated him from others, that made him abnormal. Easier to conceal this other abnormality, the creeping knowledge at the back of his thoughts, the thing he tried to suppress when he lay in the dormitory late at night, waiting until he was sure everyone had fallen asleep, clenching and clenching and only then allowing him to touch himself. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>It explained a lot of things: his lack of romantic interest in girls, his strange obsession with one of the beaters on the Slytherin Quidditch team (which he had told himself was merely inter-House rivalry), his shyness at changing in front of anyone in the dormitory. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He felt no shame. It was rather amusing, in a way. Just as he thought he had found his niche within the Wizarding community, within his friendship group, there was suddenly another part of his identity that alienated him from others. He had grown to mostly accept his lycanthropy, with James, Sirius and Peter’s help. But he couldn’t imagine telling them about this other, secret part of himself, not yet. Not when he had had to bear James and Sirius throwing about the word “gay” as an insult for the whole of fifth year, not when Peter had once sneered half-jokingly at the “sissy” nature of his cardigans. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>In the days that followed, Remus grew to think of this new-found self-knowledge almost as a talisman -  a warm, glowing surety inside him. Suddenly his eyes seemed opened to a world of secret signifiers and coded meanings. Those two Hufflepuff chasers, who he’d always considered to best friends, whispering close together in the corner of the courtyard at break. Were they like him? That Gryffindor boy with dreadlocks in the year below, who always smiled at him when they crossed each other in the Common Room. A Ravenclaw sixth year, who wore tailored muggle cigarette trousers and styled his curly black hair - not unlike Sirius’s but longer - with Sleekeasy hair products.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In looking for signifiers in others he started to become aware of the outward signs in his own appearance. How had Felix known, before Remus had even known himself? He spent longer than usual in front of the mirror in the boy’s bathroom every morning now, examining everything from the neatness of his milky brown hair to the cut of his scuffed second-hand jeans. He didn’t really possess the alpha masculinity that Sirius or James projected (or thought they did), but then he wasn’t exactly feminine either. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Maybe the cardigan had given him away.  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>*</em>
</p><p>He sinks lower in his seat, so that his view of Felix is lost. Sirius stops laughing and leans forwards, patting James on the shoulder. “Only joking Prongs. I know you’re in love with Morrissey, don’t worry.”</p><p>James shrugs his hand off, lips twitching. “Watch your mouth, Black. Don’t you dare imitate my future husband in that way ever again.”</p><p>Sirius finishes his drink and purses his lips, blowing across the top of the butterbeer bottle so that it lets out a low, wavering note. “Wouldn’t dream of it. When’s the date, by the way?”</p><p>“January the first. We’re going to have the most infamous interracial inter-magical marriage Godric’s Hollow has ever seen.”</p><p>Peter starts to laugh erratically, suddenly catching onto their sarcasm. “Hahaha! You’re so <em>gay</em>, Prongs. The Smiths are such fags.”</p><p>The word cuts through Remus like a knife - like wolf claws - deep in his stomach. Despite the warmth from his third butterbeer, his mind is suddenly very sharp. Before he can stop himself, he turns to Peter and says in a cold, dangerous tone, “Shut up.”</p><p>Peter looks at him in bewilderment, the glittery Santa hat on his head wobbling anxiously. “What??”</p><p>Remus gazes back at him steadily, trying to temper the sudden anger that makes him long to slap Peter’s confused, slightly fearful face.</p><p>“He said shut the fuck up,” Sirius barks cheerfully, “Because you’re being a fucking dick. Right, who wants more drinks? I find myself with the sudden urge to say hello to the new barmaid.”</p><p>Remus reluctantly agrees to help Sirius with drinks, partly to get away from Peter for a bit, and partly because Sirius begins to literally drag him out of his seat and onto the floor, causing James to laugh uproariously and for the surrounding groups of people to glare at them in annoyance. Once he’s upright and given Sirius a shove, they make their way through the hordes of students to the bar, ducking out of the way of occasional flying Santa and reindeer. Luckily Sirius seems to have a knack for manoeuvring his way to the front - partly through underhand tactics, Remus realises, when he observes him complimenting a Slytherin seventh year on her top and then slipping immediately past her, pulling him along with him.  </p><p>They soon reach the bar, which is festooned with magical fairy lights, and both lean against the wooden counter. Remus can see Sirius trying ineffectually to catch the eye of the new landlady, a young, blonde woman named Rosmerta, but she’s too busy serving a group of rowdy Ravenclaws to notice him.</p><p>And right at the front of the Ravenclaws, leaning drunkenly on the bar, freckled face flushed a dull crimson, is Felix. Remus’s stomach gives a lurch, and he turns quickly away, towards Sirius, trying to hide his face.</p><p>“What is it?” says Sirius, glancing at him in surprise.</p><p>“Nothing,” says Remus tightly. He’s trying to calculate whether it’s possible for him to get a drink without Felix or his friends noticing.</p><p>Sirius frowns, then looks over Remus’s shoulder at the Ravenclaws further down the bar. “Ah,” he mutters, comprehension widening his dark eyes, which are shrewd despite the drink. “Right.”</p><p>Grabbing Remus’s hand, he begins to pull them roughly back through the crowd again, muttering “Accio,” under his breath. People start to complain loudly, including the girl who’s top he just complimented - Remus distinctly thinks he catches the word <em>fuckboy</em>, though he could be wrong - but Sirius ignores them, and simply shoves his way through the crowd more aggressively.</p><p>“Sirius!” Remus shouts, attempting briefly to apologise to everyone who is being pushed aside unceremoniously. “Where are you going?”</p><p>It’s not until they’re almost at the door to the beer garden that Sirius stops suddenly, releasing him. He doesn’t say anything, but holds his hand out, and a bottle of Firewhisky zooms neatly into it, the dark liquid swilling madly around inside.</p><p>“Did you steal that from the bar?” Remus asks, shocked.</p><p>Sirius shrugs. “Yeah. Come on, I need some fresh air, and this will help us keep warm.”</p><p>“But what about James and Peter?”</p><p>Sirius nods towards the back of the pub, and Remus catches sight of their two friends gathering with a group of other Gryffindors around the jukebox. Peter is laughing, blushing intensely, sharing a mince pie with Elvira Bones, and James is leaning back against the jukebox looking rather nervous, in conversation with none other than Lily Evans.</p><p>“Wow, she’s actually tolerating his presence,” Remus murmurs, “I’m impressed.”</p><p>The last time he’d seen them talk to each other in public had been during a memorable evening following last month’s Quidditch match. ‘Talk’ was perhaps a euphemism, as they’d ended up having a blazing row from either end of the Common Room, resulting in several burnt items of furniture and enough gossip to keep Gryffindor house going for a good few weeks.</p><p>There seem to be no bad feelings at present however, as James slots a Knut into the jukebox, gesturing enthusiastically, and Lily crosses her arms, eyebrows raised and an amused grin on her face.</p><p>“I think they’ll be occupied for some time,” says Sirius snidely. “Let’s go before our ears and souls are destroyed.”</p><p align="center">*</p><p>It is bitterly cold outside. The snow flurries have died away, but an icy chill remains, the stars bright in the clear northern sky. The moon is half full, a lambent oval. It’s not Remus’s favourite kind of moon - the phase he is most fond of is that of a waning gibbous - but it will do, he supposes. Sirius leads them across the empty beer garden to a wooden picnic bench against the farthest wall, quickly conjuring a blazing magical fire in the middle of the table to warm them both, setting the bottle of Firewhisky in front of it.</p><p>“Help yourself,” he says, nodding towards the liquor.</p><p>Remus slides into the picnic bench beside him, which is mercifully warm thanks to the fire, and eyes the bottle carefully. The shock of seeing Felix has sobered him up considerably, so he could definitely do with a drink, but this whole context feels a little odd somehow. Shrugging, he unscrews the top of the bottle and takes a swig of the dark liquid, winching as the Firewhisky burns down his throat, settling comfortingly at the bottom of his stomach.</p><p>“So,” says Sirius, taking the bottle from him and casually knocking back a large shot. “How long have you been seeing him, then?”</p><p>Almost regurgitating his share of Firewhisky, Remus turns to Sirius and says, rather wildly and stupidly, “I, er, I don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>Sirius grins knowingly, amused. “You do. How long have you been getting with Felix?”</p><p>Remus’s mind races, and he briefly considers denying the question completely. However, knows that Sirius is far too sharp on these matters to be hoodwinked. “Only a month or so,” he says, and then in a quieter voice, “we aren’t seeing each other anymore.”</p><p>“Ah… I’m sorry,” Sirius says gravely, before taking another swig of Firewhisky. His tone is so <em>serious</em>, so unexpectedly understanding, that Remus turns towards him, narrowing his eyes. Where are the snide comments, the <em>gayyyyy</em> jokes, the explosive barks of laughter? “If it makes any difference,” Sirius continues, “I’ve always thought he’s a massively pretentious dick, so there’s that.”</p><p>It’s Remus who laughs now, raising his eyebrows and taking the Firewhisky bottle. “Sirius,” he says. “No offence, but you think that about pretty much everyone.”</p><p>He takes another gulp, and Sirius grins, shrugging carelessly. “Don’t have much tolerance for people at this place. Apart from you and James. Oh… and Peter.”</p><p>Remus’s eyes widen for a second at the implicit shade, then he begins to laugh quietly. He feels a steady liquid warmth beginning to spread through his limbs, mixing with the mercurial lightness of unmistakeable relief. He’s surprised, but incredibly glad that Sirius isn’t plying him with questions - so, so, grateful he isn’t being weird about this. They drink in companionable silence for a few minutes, side by side, Remus running his thumbnail back and forth across a whorl in the wood of the bench, contemplating. The wind whistles above the tall stone wall of the beer garden, stirring the ivy that clings to it frigidly, and the magical fire seems to blaze higher in response, causing Remus’s cheeks to grow rosy and for him to roll up the sleeves of his jumper.</p><p>“Just promise me this,” Sirius says, touching Remus’s forearm, his voice slightly thick now with intoxication.</p><p>Remus frowns, looking down at Sirius’s hand resting on his bare skin. He’s not sure whether he’s drunk and imagining things, but he has the distinct impression that goose bumps are spreading like an electric current all the way up to his shoulder.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Sirius looks at him intently, his eyes wide and apparently sincere. “Promise me you’ll get with someone fitter in future, yeah? Or at least, with better hair.”</p><p>Remus splutters, casting him a withering glare. “You’re ridiculous.” Sirius smirks, and Remus notices that his fingers are still resting on his forearm. “You’re cold,” he points out, nodding down at Sirius’s hand, eyeing the thin material of his black T-Shirt.</p><p>Sirius doesn’t answer straight away. He avoids Remus’s gaze at first, and Remus can tell from the crease between his thick brows that he is mulling something over. It’s only when Sirius shuffles forwards, and looks at him with a curious, unfamiliar expression, running both his hands tentatively up and down Remus’s forearms, that he says, in such a low voice that Remus almost misses it, “Maybe you can warm me up a bit.”</p><p>The fire crackles, and Remus stares at Sirius, swallowing nervously. <em>Has he misunderstood? Is Sirius taking the piss? Is this an elaborate, underhand joke about the Felix thing?</em></p><p>He has no time to wonder however, because Sirius is leaning close now, far too close, and he’s confused, because everything about this feels so familiar - he knows Sirius’s smell of Kyphi and cigarettes so well, he knows the way he swallows visibly the rare times that he’s nervous, he even knows the shadow of faint acne scars that mark his jaw.</p><p>But he doesn’t know <em>this</em>, the way that Sirius’s lips part softly in anticipation, the unnerving gentleness with which his rough hands cup the back of Remus’s neck. And he has no knowledge either, of the way it feels to have Sirius’s mouth on his own, soft and laced with Firewhisky, or why a sudden shiver runs through him as they kiss, or how much courage it takes to place both hands on either side of Sirius’s waist. It’s fierce and gentle and strange, entirely different from kissing Felix. Maybe it’s the familiarity, or perhaps the strangeness that makes it last so long, but he doesn’t even realise how much time has passed until they hear a shout from inside the pub.</p><p>“Moony! Padfoot! Where are you?”</p><p>Remus jolts away from Sirius, his heart beating wildly. He looks quickly towards the door, and a second later James appears, swaying slightly and shouting urgently, “I think we need to go!”</p>
