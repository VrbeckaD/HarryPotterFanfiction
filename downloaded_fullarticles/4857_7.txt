<p>Worth It</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“There’s no such thing as a free lunch,” hissed Rose. “He’s up to something.” </p>
<p>“Why’re you so suspicious?” Lily asked. “Will you just relax? Is it so hard to believe maybe Malfoy’s just being generous in offering to buy lunch?”</p>
<p>“Yes it is!” Rose huffed, gathering up her things. “You can stay if you like, but I’m leaving. Unlike you, I have morals.” </p>
<p>Lily rolled her eyes as she watched Rose exit the expensive, French restaurant. “Which is why you haven’t got laid in a year,” she muttered. </p>
<p>“I’d love to help with that,” came an amused voice.</p>
<p>Lily groaned. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Flushing, Lily glared at Scorpius, who of course, looked impeccable. “I should go.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t.” Scorpius sat down across from her. “I really would love to buy you lunch.” He looked around. “Where’s Rose?”</p>
<p>Lily coughed. “She doesn’t believe in free lunches.” </p>
<p>“Ah.” Scorpius raised an eyebrow. “And you?” </p>
<p>“I’m not sure if I do or not.” </p>
<p>Scorpius held up his hands. “No strings, I promise. Just a friendly meal between former classmates.” </p>
<p>“No strings?” Lily pursed her lips. “You’ll forgive me if I keep my guard up anyway?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Scorpius grinned. “You wouldn’t be Slytherin if you didn’t.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Lily ordered her free lunch, raising an eyebrow when Scorpius ordered a bottle of wine with his meal. “You will share some, won’t you?” </p>
<p>“Is that your plan, then?” she asked when the waiter left. “You’re going to get me drunk and have your wicked way with me?” </p>
<p>Scorpius’ lips twitched. “Do I look like an idiot? You’re a witch, and a Potter. You have magic <i>and</i> more relatives than there are trees outside. You think I want them all to descend on me and hex me into small pieces?”</p>
<p>Lily snorted. “That’s the only reason you wouldn’t take advantage?”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Scorpius’ face went blank. “I wouldn’t take advantage of you because I like you,” he said quietly. “But, believe it or not, I also wouldn’t take advantage of anyone, even if I didn’t like them.”</p>
<p>Lily bit her lip. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to suggest—”</p>
<p>Scorpius stood up. “This was a mistake. I’d hoped we could have a friendly meal together, but I’ve bolloxed it up. I’ll leave you to eat alone. I’m sorry to have bothered you. Oh, and lunch is still on me.” He smiled bitterly. “You see? There is such a thing as a free lunch.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Stop, please,” said Lily. “I was wrong. I…apologise.”</p>
<p>Scorpius, who’d turned away, froze. Slowly, he spun to stare at her. An eyebrow went up. “Did you just apologise?”</p>
<p>Lily coughed. </p>
<p>Scorpius sat down. “I’m sorry, but I must be hearing things.” </p>
<p>“Shut up,” she said, biting back a grin. </p>
<p>“Oh no. No I will not.” Scorpius smirked. “I’m going to preserve this memory forever. I got Miss perfect ‘I never make a mistake’ Lily Luna Potter to apologise to me. That’s worth the price of lunch.” </p>
<p>Lily rolled her eyes. “So much for a free lunch for me, though.”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>By the time their food arrived, they were arguing good-naturedly, and by pudding, Lily remembered why she’d fancied him all through school. Except it’d seemed <i>he’d</i> fancied Rose.</p>
<p>Sobered by that thought, Lily stopped speaking mid-sentence in her story. </p>
<p>“You can’t leave it there,” Scorpius said. “What did James do?” </p>
<p>Lily took a sip of her wine. “Was this free lunch originally intended to seduce Rose?” she blurted. </p>
<p>Scorpius blinked. “What?” </p>
<p>“You fancied Rose in school.” </p>
<p>Scorpius smiled. “Briefly, yes.” His smile widened. “<i>Then</i> I fancied Albus.” </p>
<p>“Oh!” Lily gaped. </p>
<p>“And now,” whispered Scorpius, clasping her hand, “I fancy you.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“You…you do?” Lily stared at him. Had he always had such amazing eyes?</p>
<p>Scorpius smiled. “Okay, so you should know, I did fib.” </p>
<p>Lily pulled away. “What did you do?” </p>
<p>Scorpius clung to her hand. “I said I wanted this to be a friendly meal, but I was hoping this could be a <i>more than friends</i> meal.” </p>
<p>Lily stopped trying to retrieve her hand. “You…were?”</p>
<p>“I still am.” Scorpius released her hand. “But this can still be a free lunch with no strings if you prefer.” </p>
<p>“Actually,” said Lily, reaching for his hand, “I’m okay with <i>some</i> strings.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“That clerk knows,” Lily said as Scorpius propelled her into the hotel room. </p>
<p>Scorpius grinned. “Probably. We <i>are</i> two gorgeous twenty-somethings renting a room over lunch.” He kissed her. “Does it matter?” </p>
<p>Lily smiled. “No.” </p>
<p>Nor did it matter when she rode him to a brilliant orgasm. As they cuddled afterwards, she chuckled. </p>
<p>“Should I take that as a comment on my performance?”</p>
<p>“Stop looking for compliments! And no, I was thinking maybe Rose was right.” </p>
<p>“About?” </p>
<p>“There really is no free lunch.”</p>
<p>“I hope the price you paid for yours was worth it,” Scorpius murmured.</p>
<p>She grinned. “Definitely.”</p>
