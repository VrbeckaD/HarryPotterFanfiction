          <div class="userstuff"><p>Percy wished, not for the first time, that he could just. Melt into a puddle and die. Peacefully, with his brothers nowhere near him. Or his family nowhere near him. Or like, society in general miles and miles away. </p><p> </p><p>“Mmm, I bet Penelope likes your bone, Perce.” George’s face is that of a Lenny‘s, and Percy would have laughed at that fact if his cheeks weren’t on fire. George takes another bite of his chicken leg, having eaten it to the bone on another part, which was where he got that very “innocent” remark.</p><p> </p><p>“That one wasn’t even that good.” Percy mutters, hardly audible. George only laughs at him. Why him? He especially cannot deal with this while Oliver is by his side. Out of all family dinners to invite him to, it’s the one where Charlie figured out he had a special someone. Of course, he hadn’t figured out who before Percy pushed him out of his room screaming, so they all assumed it was Penelope Clearwater. Tonight is the night where Percy fully accepts there is no God, or at least, not a benevolent one.</p><p> </p><p>Ron, who is twelve might he remind you, smirks and whispers something to Harry. Oh, joy. He had forgotten there was yet another witness to this humiliation. </p><p> </p><p>Fred rolls his eyes. “Oh, Percy, get the wand out your arse! Put it in Penelope’s instead. Tell me, what’s her favorite type of wood? Does she like it hard or soft?”</p><p> </p><p>”That doesn’t even make sense!”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, where was his mother and father now? </p><p> </p><p>There came a crashing from outside. Ah, yes, taking care of the gnomes from outside. They had both left, assuming the children were okay to be left alone for a little while. How very wrong they were.</p><p> </p><p>Percy’s ears burn with the newest addition to the teasing, and he glances at Oliver, who just so happens to be that “significant other” of his. <em> Help</em>, he silently begs, <em>help. </em> Oliver bites his lip as if he’s trying to keep from laughing. Filthy traitor. Then again, he also looks slightly distressed. </p><p> </p><p>“Why can’t you just shut up?” Percy asks. </p><p> </p><p>“I bet Penelope can always shut you up.” </p><p> </p><p>“Ginny, how dare you betray me! And you’re like, eleven!”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry, Perce, I have a plan.” Oliver says.</p><p> </p><p>Percy looks to Oliver in hope. A frail, fragile hope. He smiles, shakily. He’s glad, yes, celebrating even, because this is the awesome beautiful crackhead Oliver Wood we’re talking about. The problem is that this is the awesome beautiful <em>crackhead</em> <em>Oliver Wood</em> we’re talking about.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, and what might that plan be?” Fred grins maniacally, with his stupid I-am-the-god-of-mischief-and-no-one-can-defeat-me complex. </p><p> </p><p>“Percy’s gay.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s silence for one second. One tiny, frigid second where the words sink in and the responses are formulated.</p><p> </p><p>Then Percy lets his head fall onto the table with a dull <em> thunk. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that explains a lot actually.”</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shi-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so he’s the one who likes wands, good to know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Everything makes sense now, I’ve been enlightened, the world has evolved-”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Perce, that true? I feel bad for Penelope, then, how could you do this to her?” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god me too! Gay sibling club unite!”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Gay sibling club unite!</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Percy repeatedly bangs his head on the table. <em> Thunk, thunk, thunk. </em> No amount of Advil can fix this. The worst part is that they probably think it’s just another nonsense joke at his expense. <em> Hhnnnngg.</em></p><p> </p><p>“Why couldn’t you have outed Penelope instead, Olly?” Percy groans. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait, it’s true true? GAY SIBLING CLUB AWAYYY!”</p><p> </p><p>Oliver just smiles innocently at him. Why does Percy even like him? <em> Why? </em></p><p> </p><p>“HOLLUPHOLLUPHOLLUP!” Shouts Charlie, quieting the chaos down so they’ll listen to him in a way only cooler older siblings can. “If he’s gay, then now who’s his boyfriend?”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny’s grin is much too crooked and Fred-George like for Percy’s taste. “Oliver, obviously.”</p><p> </p><p>Percy freezes. He’s 99.99% sure his face and ears have managed to turn redder than his trademark Weasley hair, not an easy feat. He’s well aware that Ginny didn’t actually mean it, or think that it’s true, but they all turn to look at his reaction and he is well aware he’s completely revealed himself. He is so terrible at life as a concept, really and truly. He wants to deny it, begs himself to, but his tongue is stuck to the roof of his mouth and he can’t unstick no matter how hard he tries. </p><p> </p><p>George stares Percy right in the eye. “Well, Perce?” They wait for an answer, something to use against him yet again, and Percy can’t really move. Or speak. Or think. Why can’t he just die of spontaneous combustion already? </p><p> </p><p>He glances at Oliver without moving anything but his eyes, unable to look for longer than half a millisecond. He will <em> not </em> acknowledge that. Or that reaction. Or how pretty Oliver’s eyes are, and how cute he looked when stumbling over his words filled with quidditch analogies trying to ask him out, or anything of the sort. How dare the universe make him live a life like this. </p><p> </p><p>Their waiting, their silence, stretches, and they take in his wide eyes and tense posture and uncharacteristic lack of vehement denial and red face, and evil realization dawns on their faces. Evil, evil realization. </p><p> </p><p>“So Percy, how do you like Oliver’s wand?” Fred asks, elbow leaning on the table next to the plate of mashed potatoes. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, how’s the wood? I find I like the morning type best myself.”</p><p> </p><p>Percy shoots up, pushing back his plate and chair. </p><p> </p><p>“HARD OR SOFT?”</p><p> </p><p>“BENDY OR STIFF?”</p><p> </p><p>They yell that after him as he runs away thinking, <em> I will kill them, I will kill them</em>, <em> I will kill them-, </em></p><p> </p><p>
