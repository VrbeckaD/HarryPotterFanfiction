  <em>
    <span>Wotcher Mad-Eye,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You haven't been writing recently, what's up? You can still write to people at Hogwarts, you know.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You might want to respond, or I just might ignore you permanently. You don't want that, don't you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You might also want to check that bowler hat of yours. I had a feeling that you were going to use it soon. Hope you like it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>With love,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Tonks.</span>

  <em>
    <span>Wotcher Mad-Eye,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You still haven't written, sigh, I'm disappointed in you (tsk, tsk, tsk).</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Did you get both hands chopped off? Is that why you can't write? Might as well send a Patronus, I haven't seen that ugly blob of an animal in ages.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Write soon, or I'll turn your eye violet.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Lots of love,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Tonks.</span>

  <em>
    <span>Wotcher Mad-Eye,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Come on now, say something. Or Lil' Tonksie here might get worried. You don't want that, do you, constant vigilance and all that. Hope you enjoy this new hat, I thought you might like the look.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Seriously though, or I'll somehow get inside Hogwarts and break your door. And transfigure your eye violet.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Tonks.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wotcher Mad-Eye,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Here, look, I'll prove that I'm not some insane lunatic who's trying to hunt you down. Then will you write something?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>- You prefer Scotch over brandy (sometimes you fill your flask with that), which I've never understood why. Scotch is disgusting.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>- You used the Cruciatus Curse on me a total of 43 times, even though that's illegal. Very smooth, Mad-Eye, I appreciate the fact that you think I'm important enough to risk being stripped of your wand.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>- You specifically asked me to morph my hair green during my graduation, because it made me look ridiculous. For some reason, I did it, and you have a picture of me glaring at you while you took a picture of that somewhere deep inside that old wooden writing desk. In your laundry room. For some reason.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Hope that's enough proof for you, now will you write?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Thanks very much.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Tonks.</span>

    <span>Dear Mad-Eye (you prick),</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>HOW THE FUCK DOES THE GREATEST AUROR OF ALL TIME GET DEFEATED AND SUBDUED BY SOME SCRAWNY AZKABAN ESCAPEE?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>- Tonks</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>PS: An afterthought: hope you’re recovering fine</span>
