    <p>Draco was so beautiful, even in his current state. He was asleep, so Harry couldn’t see his wonderful, sparkling, silver eyes. His porcelain, smooth skin was glowing in the faint green light; Harry couldn’t tell where it was coming from. His lips appeared plumper and pinker than usual, probably a trick from being under so much water. His hair, that he spent so much time getting so perfect, was flying above his head, and Harry would have laughed if the circumstances had been different.</p><p> </p><p>As it was, however, Draco was floating asleep under the lake, where the second task of the Triwizard Tournament was happening. Apparently, Harry was supposed to rescue Draco. He really hadn’t expected that to happen, Draco was the last person he expected to be chosen. He had no idea how the judges had even found out about their relationship.</p><p> </p><p>He could pretend that Hermione was the person he would sorely miss, it was true, but he had a feeling that Draco was his intended. Who else would miss Draco? Hermione was Krum’s, Cho was Cedric’s, the little girl was Fleur’s, Draco had to be Harry’s.</p><p> </p><p>He was upset, and worried, and a part of him wanted to just stay down, where Draco couldn’t get upset. He really didn’t know what would happen when they surfaced. Harry did know that Draco wanted him to win, so he couldn’t stay there for much longer. He took a deep breath and began cutting away at the ropes holding Draco in place. He was relieved that Draco had worked out that the champions had to save a live hostage. He still wanted to grab the other hostages, but he was even more worried about Draco.</p><p> </p><p>He swam them up rather slowly, not wanting to face what was going to meet them. He remembered that Dumbledore had taken him slightly aside and told him that everything would be ok. He had asked what Dumbledore meant, but Bagman had called for the start of the tournament and Dumbledore had pushed him over to the starting line. Dumbledore must have been trying to tell him it was ok with him that Draco was the one he would miss most. He appreciated that, but there was no telling how upset the rest of Hogwarts was. There was no telling how upset Draco would be.</p><p> </p><p>There was no telling how upset Lucius Malfoy would be. He was so scared to think what he would do. Draco had only alluded to things over the years that Mr. Malfoy would do to his son. Harry suspected that Draco didn’t even know the full extent of what was possible.</p><p> </p><p>He was worried for Draco. They had been private about their relationship for a reason. As soon as they broke the surface, things would be different.</p><p> </p><p>The water became lighter, and Harry could vaguely hear noises indicating they were near the surface. He stopped his ascent and looked at Draco. He was neutral in his sleep, and Harry wanted to make sure that he remembered him in this calm state of peace. Merlin, he was gorgeous. Things were about to get difficult for them, so Harry leaned forward, hoping for one last kiss in a time of peace. He felt vaguely guilty that Draco wouldn’t remember it, or be able to participate in it, so he kept it light and gentle. Even if it was basically him kissing himself it was wonderful. He never wanted to kiss anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>With a splash, Harry broke the surface, turning quickly to Draco. He coughed and looked around wildly. “Harry!” Draco exclaimed, and swam closer to him. Harry looked up into the stands on the shore. There was cheering, but he wasn’t sure that anyone could see who his hostage had been.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco! Are you ok?” Harry asked, not wanting to get too close to him. Draco didn’t feel the same way, as he got within inches of Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine,” although he was still breathing pretty heavily. “This was such a stupid idea, I didn’t realize how freezing it would be.”</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t—” Harry started, confused. “Did you <em>let</em> them do this to you?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco made a face. “Yeah, against my better judgement. Come on, I want to get out of this damn water.” He started swimming and Harry followed him, trying to figure out what was going on.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco, this doesn’t make any sense. What are we going to say when we get up there? Everyone’s going to know you’re who I’ll most sorely miss. How are we going to explain that?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco was faster than Harry and had gotten a fair bit ahead of him. “Hurry up, will you? I’m freezing my bits off.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we don’t want that,” Harry grinned in spite of the situation. “But Draco, what are we going to do? Should we keep fighting, and just say that I’d miss that?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco kept silent, Harry tried hard to catch up to him, but was only able to reach his foot. He pulled, and Draco yelped. “What’d you do that for?” He demanded as he spun around in the water to confront Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re ignoring me! We need to come up with a plan, this is our only chance to talk!”</p><p> </p><p>Draco glared at him for a couple more seconds before sighing. “I told Dumbledore everything. He’s going to keep me safe during the summer, so we can start telling people about us, if you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stared at him in amazement. “Everything’s ok? We can tell people we’re together?” Draco nodded, a small smile coming on his face. Harry shouted in his exuberance. He hugged Draco tightly, using his legs to keep himself afloat. He pulled back and looked at Draco’s face. “What’s the problem? You don’t look happy?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco shook his head. “I’m just nervous, I guess. Just because Dumbledore says my Father is taken care of, doesn’t mean all our problems are solved. I’m not sure I trust that Dumbledore even knows what my Father is capable of, let alone his ability to protect me from him. I’m his only heir, that’s the most important thing to him, he’s not going to just give up without a fight. Not to mention we’ll have to deal with our friends. Yours are going to be upset enough, I’m not sure mine will still be my friends once they learn about this.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry slowly lost his smile. He could see Draco’s point. He treaded water, thinking. “Well, we don’t have to do anything. We can still keep on, deny everything.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco blinked. “You would do that, for me?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry snorted. “Of course, I would. I’d do anything for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco stared at him for several seconds before a smile blossomed across his face. He kicked forward and grabbed Harry. Harry almost went under, but Draco was strong enough to keep them both above the water. He was slightly distracted, and very surprised when Draco kissed him. His lips were warm, and Harry’s entire body was frozen. When their lips touched, Harry felt heat warm him to every inch of his body. Kissing Draco was amazing.</p><p> </p><p>They pulled back slowly, neither wanting to stop, smiles on both faces. Draco’s hand came down to his and he grasped it tightly. “Let’s do this.” Draco said, and Harry raised his eyebrows.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure?” Draco smiled widened and he nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. I want to be able to kiss you whenever I want.” Draco said, and they set forward to the shore again. The exercise helped warm them a little, but they were both relieved to reach the stands. Hands reached out to help them up, and towels were wrapped around them.</p><p> </p><p>They sat next to each other on the edge of the lake as people talked around them, Madam Pomphrey fussed over them quietly, and the cheering died down as the students realized just who Harry’s hostage had been. The riddle must have been played to them, so they must know that Harry would sorely miss Draco.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t do anything, not yet. They merely sat there, huddled in their blankets, sipping their hot tea spiked with pepper-up potion, leaning lightly on each other, but not speaking or implying their relationship one way or the other. The whispers became louder as more and more people started participating, until they weren’t even trying to keep their voices down.</p><p> </p><p>Cedric was the next champion to emerge from the waters with his hostage, Cho Chang. They were awarded the same treatment as Harry and Draco, given blankets and tea, and a seat next to Harry and Draco.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, Harry?” Cedric asked, looking at Draco. Cho was gaping and didn’t seem to care that she was.</p><p> </p><p>“Still freezing, actually.” Harry said, ignoring his implied question. “You?”</p><p> </p><p>“Same.” Cedric was doing a good job of trying not to stare, look too confused or curious, Harry had to admit, but he wasn’t going to help him out. It might be better if they got the fallout over with, but Hermione would be joining them soon, and she’d just want to know everything Harry would have to say. Harry wanted to repeat the story as few times as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Ron would want to know everything, too. He was up in the stands somewhere, maybe trying to make his way down to Harry. He wondered if he could get everyone together and just tell it once.</p><p> </p><p>“So…?” Cedric started, but didn’t appear to know how to complete the thought. “Um, you know Cho, right? She’s the seeker for Ravenclaw. Not this year, obviously, but next year…”</p><p> </p><p>Harry saved his flailing. “Right, hey, Cho. We haven’t really had much chance to talk, I’m Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>Cho blushed and laughed lightly. “Yes, I’m aware.” She smiled widely at him, and it made Harry a little uncomfortable.</p><p> </p><p>He turned to look at Draco. “Hey, we’ve got all the seekers in the school right here.” Draco rolled his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a dork, Harry.” Cedric and Cho exchanged looks, but Harry just smiled.</p><p> </p><p>“Why does that make me a dork?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco shook his head, taking another sip from his tea. “It just does. You are a dork.” They smiled at each other.</p><p> </p><p>“Ok, look, I’ve got to ask…what is going on?” Cedric asked. He put his arm around Cho, and they both leaned forward.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, it’s a bit of a long story.” Harry started, but was interrupted by screaming. He turned in that direction and received an armful of Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry!” She exclaimed, and Harry leaned back away from her loudness.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Hermione. You ok?” Hermione nodded quickly and kissed him on the top of his still wet head.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’m fine, Harry! I was so worried about you not getting anything in time! But you did it, and you won!” She started cheering, jumping up and down, and Harry found himself on his feet and doing the same. Cho and Cedric started cheering as well from their seated positions, and Krum walked up behind Hermione, clapping politely but looking a bit cross.</p><p> </p><p>“You have beetle in your hair, Herm-ion-ninny.” He said softly, trying to dislodge it. Hermione merely shook her hair impatiently before turning back to Harry. Madam Pomphrey pushed her gently into a seat on the other side of Harry before she did the same thing to Krum next to Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>He tapped her on the shoulder, but she just waved at him before she turned back to Harry. “Who was your person, Harry? Was it Ron? Where is he?” She looked around as if expecting him to pop up waving his hands.</p><p> </p><p>“It was Draco, actually,” Harry said, putting his arm around the back of Draco’s chair.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione blinked, and focused on Draco as if she was seeing him for the first time. She blinked a couple more times, then said, “that’s Malfoy.” Blankly, as if Harry didn’t know. Harry looked at Draco smiling, then turned back to Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>“I know.” He said lightly.</p><p> </p><p>“’Sup, Granger?” Draco said, leaning back in his chair as if he didn’t have a care in the world, Harry knew better.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione and the rest of them were quiet for several moments. In the background, Harry realized that Fleur was back, hugging her sister. Hermione stared at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s <em>Malfoy</em>,” she said, pointing. As if Harry hadn’t heard or understood the first time.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked back at Draco, making sure this was still ok, then looked back to Hermione. “Yes, I’m aware, Hermione. I’d like to wait until Ron gets here to tell you the story.” He was a bit nervous about telling the story in the first place and reminded himself he also didn’t want to have to repeat it for the hundreds of people who would want to know every detail.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione just stared at him blankly, and Harry figured that was good enough for now. At least she wasn’t reacting negatively, even if she wasn’t reacting at all. He moved his blanket to hold it closed with one hand and used the other to stroke Draco’s side. Draco moved his blanket to hold Harry’s hand off the side. The blankets covered their connection.</p><p> </p><p>The silence was strange, as it stretched rather uncomfortably, and because there was noise just outside their little bubble. The students were all talking, the Hogwarts students informing the other schools just why they were freaking out. Fleur and her sister joined them, Fleur speaking in rapid French to her sister.</p><p> </p><p>Draco sat up straighter and responded to something Fleur said, also in French. Harry watched their conversation with an open mouth and heat filling him from the inside out.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know you could speak French,” Harry said, once the conversation appeared to be over several minutes later.</p><p> </p><p>Draco glared at him. “Yes, you did, I told you last year, over the summer, remember?” Harry frowned. Draco rolled his eyes. “I came to visit you at the Leaky Cauldron and we talked about my family being from France, and how I learned the language?” Harry shook his head.</p><p> </p><p>“I remember that, but I don’t remember you saying you spoke French.” Harry said, still trying to remember.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you weren’t paying attention to me, now I have proof.” He flicked Harry’s nose and Harry blinked in surprise.</p><p> </p><p>“You just flicked me.” Harry stated the obvious. Draco nodded, nose in the air. “Why did you flick me??”</p><p> </p><p>“I had every right. I’ll do it again if you ever ignore me again.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to ignore you. Maybe I just forgot, it was a year ago.” Draco nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“I accept your apology. I will not, however, be taking back my flick.” Draco pompously turned away from him, nose in the air, smile twitching. His hand squeezed Harry’s under their blankets.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Harry repeated, blinking his eyes and laying his head down on Draco’s shoulder. He tried to look as innocent and sweet as possible, sticking out his lower lip enticingly. Draco blinked down at him, he could tell he was trying to fight off a smile and was failing miserably.</p><p> </p><p>He started chuckling, looking into Harry’s eyes, and he could tell by his eyes and movements he wanted to kiss Harry. “I can never stay mad at you.” He said simply. Harry wasn’t sure if this was the right time to have a kiss, but he really wanted one. It would get them straight to the point.</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell is going on with you two?” Hermione burst out, and Harry was so surprised to hear her swearing, he jumped up, half unaware that she was there.</p><p> </p><p>He opened his mouth, but Bagman’s voice boomed across the lake before he could say anything. “Ladies and Gentlemen, the judges have made their final decisions, and we are ready to announce the scores. We have decided to award the champions points out of fifty. Fleur Delacour used a bubble-head charm, which worked very well. Unfortunately, she was attacked by grindylows and was rescued by a merperson guard. She was unable to rescue her hostage, her sister, Gabrielle Delacour. We award her twenty points for her spell-casting abilities.”</p><p> </p><p>There was polite cheering for Fleur, but Harry hear her say that she deserved zero.                                                                                                              </p><p> </p><p>“Victor Krum used partial human transfiguration that never-the-less, worked. He returned well outside the one-hour time limit with his hostage, Hermione Granger. We have awarded him thirty-five points.” There was a bit more applause for the quidditch star, and Victor was looking both smug and disappointed. That might have something to do with the fact that Hermione was only briefly taking a break from staring Harry down to look at him.</p><p> </p><p>“Cedric Diggory,” people started applauding just at his name and Cedric stood and waved, grinning, “also used a bubble-head charm. He was able to rescue his hostage, Cho Chang, and arrived back only one minute outside the time limit. We have decided to award him thirty-eight points.” There was applause, louder than the other clapping, and Cedric took a bow, smiling humbly.</p><p> </p><p>“Finally, we have Harry Potter,” and a hush silenced the crowd. “Who brewed a very difficult Aqua-Lung potion, allowing the drinker to breath underwater, and rescued his hostage, Draco Malfoy after only forty-five minutes. We award him forty-nine points.” There was applause, this time thunderous, cries of outrage, and more whispering. Harry wasn’t sure how he heard the whispers, but it was apparent there were lots of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” Draco whispered next to him, and Harry turned to find him closer to him than he would have guessed. It was Draco’s choice if this is how he wanted to do it, and he wasn’t surprised it was the most dramatic way possible.</p><p> </p><p>Draco pulled him closer by a hand on the back of his neck, gently, giving plenty of time for him to pull away. Then, their lips touched, parted slightly, and they kissed, in front of the entire school.</p><p> </p><p>This time, the gasps were as loud as Fleur’s applause, immediately followed by loud talking as the students asked their neighbors if they saw what was happening. Bagman’s loud spluttering echoed around the lake, before he said something or other about when the next task was. Harry should probably pay attention to that, but Draco’s lips were so smooth and tasty. They had his attention, more so than anything else around him.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t really care about Hermione looking like she was about to faint, clutching her mouth, Krum springing forward to support her. He didn’t even notice Ron finally making it to them and freezing with his mouth dropped open. He didn’t notice Dumbledore applauding them and cheering, as it was drowned out by the noise the students were making, talking loudly to those around them. Fred loudly fell from his seat, completely unnoticed by George. Ginny felt tears sting her eyes and found her way out of the stands. Neville, Seamus and Dean all turned to each other and began asking each other if they knew about that, as most students were doing.</p><p> </p><p>Cedric was one of the few who didn’t gasp, just leaned back in his seat, mouth parted a couple centimeters, eyebrows raised, but the corners of his mouth tilted upwards and he finally joined Dumbledore in his applause. Cho pulled him back to whisper in his ear if he knew about them and could believe it, neither of them taking their eyes off the kissing couple. Krum’s eyebrows raised, betraying his only surprise, but he looked pleased, as well. Fleur and Gabrielle both gasped lightly, before turning to each other and giggling into their hands.</p><p> </p><p>Most of the Beauxbatons students seemed to be giggling, while the Durmstrang students seemed to be rolling their eyes and getting up to head back to wherever they went during the day. Bagman had dismissed them at one point, but most students were either staying right where they were to watch the show or trying to get closer to it.</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s friends reacted with the same level of surprise, but also disgust. Pansy Parkinson actually did faint, although that might have been to get some attention back to her; she didn’t succeed. Crabbe stared at them in confusion, as if wondering when the prank would be revealed. Goyle’s mouth opened and he made a noise of disgust. Blaise kept his Slytherin Mask in place with difficulty, although his eyes betrayed his feelings. Theodore Nott coughed, trying hard not to retch all over the book he had brought. Millicent Bullstode looked like she sucked on a lemon, mouth twisting and eyes widening. Astoria Greengrass was one of the ones who gasped, though hers was much higher pitched. Her sister Daphne wrapped her arm around her, aware of her sister’s crush, other hand covering her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Harry and Draco were completely oblivious to all that, however. They were completely lost in each other, the only thing that mattered to them. Harry had wrapped his arms around Draco’s middle, practically pulling him up from his seat in his effort to be as close to him as possible. Draco’s hands had cupped his face at first but had moved down to wrap around his neck and shoulders. They were both on the edge of their seats, mutually being pulled together.</p><p> </p><p>They separated by just enough space to smile at each other, Draco whispering, “congratulations on your win,” and Harry felt like he had won much more than the task. He sat back, one arm still wrapped around Draco, one hand on his knee, and surveyed the damage. He wasn’t sure how long the kiss had gone on, but people should have had a moment to get over their shock and move on. That was not the case.</p><p> </p><p>Mostly everyone was either still gaping or gossiping to their friends. Harry caught sight of Ron and waved him over. He wanted his two best friends to know about them first. They already had to have guessed at least some of it from that kiss, but they’d be the first to directly know.</p><p> </p><p>Ron managed to slowly make his way over, eyes still wide and mouth still open. Hermione was waving off Krum, who was trying to talk to her. She was leaning forward, hand raised as if she wanted to pull Harry back away from Draco.</p><p> </p><p>Harry took a deep breath and looked at both of them, “do you want to go somewhere more private?” They both nodded, eyes still wide.</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed and got up, waved at his fellow champions, and pulled Draco up by the hand. “Do you want to come?” He asked, looking off to the Slytherin section.</p><p> </p><p>Draco looked nervously in their direction as well. “I’d better head off the first wave of disappointment. There may be explosions, and it’ll be best if I’m there to counteract most of the heat. The longer I wait, the worse it will be, and I definitely don’t want to be seen going off with the golden trio.” He grinned at Harry. “Told you I’d think of a better name for you three.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll never understand Slytherin politics,” Harry murmured. “Are you sure you’re going to be ok?” He ignored the ‘golden trio’ thing for the moment.</p><p> </p><p>Draco nodded. “Come see me two hours before curfew?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Harry smiled, and leaned in to kiss him goodbye, like he had dreamed of doing for the last year.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry!” Ron exclaimed, waving his arms around as if he wasn’t sure what to do with them.</p><p> </p><p>Their kiss was just a peck, which was all Harry figured they could take. Their hands stayed clasped as Harry walked further away until they were too far apart, and their arms fell to their sides. “Wait!” Cho exclaimed, getting up as well. “Are you two dating?” She asked the question on everyone’s mind.</p><p> </p><p>It was probably Harry’s imagination, but he could have sworn that everyone in the immediate vicinity leaned forward to hear the answer. “Yes,” they said together. That got the talking going again. Harry turned back to smile at Draco one last time and was instead met with a wall of curious students.</p><p> </p><p>They all wanted to know about Draco, were they dating, how long had they been dating, why hadn’t they gone to the Yule Ball together, how had they started dating, why was Draco his hostage, since when had he been gay, did he want to be gay with someone else, why hadn’t they told anyone, why were they kissing, didn’t Harry know Draco was a Slytherin, why were they together, had Draco used a love potion on him, was Harry crazy?</p><p> </p><p>“Move out of the way, let him through!” Came a voice shouting and hitting people until they cleared a path.</p><p> </p><p>It was Sal, with Mandy hanging back with a pleased expression, holding her arms out to hold people back. Fred and George Weasley came towards the end of the tunnel, yelling as well and throwing what appeared to be dungbombs into the crowd. “Run!” Sal yelled at them, and Harry took off with Ron and Hermione following, hands covering their noses. Harry called his thanks as he passed them and received four smiles in return.</p><p> </p><p>They kept running, Harry wasn’t sure the best place to go. He didn’t want somewhere that would be easy to find, so they could have privacy. He figured being on the grounds were out, since it was still pretty cold, and the common room was definitely out. He couldn’t bear to bring them to his and Draco’s room, as that was space just for them. He did think an abandoned classroom had merit, and he knew of several throughout the castle.</p><p> </p><p>He led his friends, who were being suspiciously quiet, past several doors before settling on a dusty classroom several floors up. He figured that since it was almost lunch time, they wouldn’t be followed or found so far away from the Great Hall.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” he started, not sure how to finish it. He took a seat at one of the student desks in the corner, not wanting to take the teacher’s desk just in case Ron or Hermione read into that symbolism. They took seats as well, staring at him with growing impatience.</p><p> </p><p>The silence between them stretched uncomfortably. “You and Malfoy are dating?” Ron finally asked.</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. Working backwards would work. “Since when have you been friends?” Hermione asked suspiciously, they had apparently gotten tired of waiting on him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry took a deep breath. “That depends.” At their glares, he continued, “I don’t know if you know this, but we met before the Hogwarts Express. And he was a really nice, nervous, little kid, just like me. He offered to be my friend, and I accepted. Then, his Father took him home and told him he could be friends with The Harry Potter. I didn’t find this out until the end of First year, but halfway down Second, I asked if he wanted to continue pretending to be enemies while secretly being friends, and he accepted. We started dating last year.” Ron and Hermione were gaping, not really reacting so Harry decided to give them some time to digest what they had already heard. That was the skeleton of it, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>The silence continued stretching before Hermione slowly closed her eyes and shook her head. “He’s the person you’ve been sneaking out to meet.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s brows narrowed in frustration. “I wouldn’t call it ‘sneaking’ but yes, he’s who I usually hang out with when I’m not with you two.”</p><p> </p><p>“Your mysterious pen-pal as well?” It was barely a question.</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. “Why wouldn’t you tell us?” Ron asked, and Harry detected the anger in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>He sighed. “Because Draco’s Father threatened him. Draco said that bad things would happen to him if his Father found out about us being friends.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you believed him?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course!” Harry was surprised. “Why wouldn’t I?” Ron and Hermione exchanged looks.</p><p> </p><p>“This is Malfoy we’re talking about. What if all this is just some scheme to get you to You-Know-Who?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry snorted. “He’s doing a pretty piss-poor job of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“How do you know? What if he was the one to put your name in the Goblet of Fire?” Hermione asked in her best I-Know-Better-Than-You tone.</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t even consider it. “There’s no way he would do that, he was furious when he found out. I can read him, I know he wasn’t acting. Besides, there’s still the whole age-line thing for him to get past.” Hermione did look stumped at that, but Ron took up the challenge.</p><p> </p><p>“So, he had help. Maybe his Father told him a way around the magic. Lucius Malfoy’s good with dark magic, I bet there’s loads of stuff he can do we have no idea about. Didn’t Moody say it was dark magic that was around the Goblet?” Hermione stared at Ron in awe.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s brilliant, Ron!”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to sound so surprised.” He said turning red. Harry hoped that meant they were done, but his hopes vanished as their moment ended and they both turned to look at him. “Well, Harry? Have you considered that this is all a plot?” Hermione demanded.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head. “That doesn’t make any sense. I know Draco, and I trust him with my life. He would never do anything to hurt me.” At their horror stricken looks, he continued. “But if you want an answer to the question, I was the one to come to him, not the other way around. If his Father wanted to hand me over to Voldemort, or whatever, he could have kidnapped me when we first met. It doesn’t make any sense for him to want to hurt me. Believe me.” He added, at their disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, what about this? Why now?” Hermione asked.</p><p> </p><p>Ron’s eyes lit up. “Yeah! Why are you telling us now if his Father was going to hurt him?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry shrugged. “I didn’t get the full story out of Draco, but Dumbledore said he would offer protection to Draco. I think he’s leaving his family for me.” Ron and Hermione looked at each other, Hermione biting her lip, as Harry thought about that. It really wasn’t fair. He hadn’t truly considered that Draco would essentially be leaving his family all for the sake of Harry. Sure, Lucius was a bastard by the sounds of it, but he was still Draco’s Father, and Draco might not get to see him until he was an adult. Draco genuinely liked his Mother, he probably wouldn’t see her either. It just wasn’t fair. If Harry had more time to think about that, he would have pointed it out to Draco, so he could make a real choice. It wasn’t right that he had to choose between his family and Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t trust him.” Ron finally said, snapping Harry out of his thoughts. Hermione shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t either. I don’t think you should see him anymore, Harry.” Harry’s eyes widened.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not happening. I-I love him.” He told them, only stumbling a little.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said in pity and shock, covering her mouth with a hand.</p><p> </p><p>Ron shook his head. “You’ve never been gay though! You like <em>girls</em>, right mate? What about that Ravenclaw seeker? She’s awfully pretty, I bet she’d go out with you!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head. “I don’t want to go out with her. I want to go out with Draco.”</p><p> </p><p>Ron groaned in frustration, “but she’s a quidditch player! And she’s hot! Ok, fine, what about Lavender Brown? Or Parvati Patil?” Harry shook his head violently, opening his mouth, but Ron continued, “ok, you want to be gay, that’s fine. I don’t care! Just not Malfoy! Hermione, who are some good-looking blokes?” Hermione blinked at him. “I bet she’d let you have Krum, Harry! It doesn’t matter! You’re Harry Potter, you could have anyone you want, you don’t have to settle for Draco bloody Malfoy!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry glared. This was getting offensive. “I’m in love with Draco, Ron, I don’t want anyone else, man or woman. I know this is a lot to take in, but I’m staying with him. This is just something you’ll have to get used to.” Hermione took a deep breath and leaned over to Ron, whispering in his ear.</p><p> </p><p>Harry stared at them, hurt. At least with their annoying looks they weren’t blatantly keeping him out of the loop. He had been feeling more and more the third wheel between the two of them as the years went on. Perhaps that was somewhat his fault. He had branched out and the two of them had gotten closer as a result, but he would never know if that would have happened anyway and he would have been left out even if he hadn’t gone off with Draco and his other friends. Eventually, he'd have to fall in love with someone, even if it hadn't been Draco, Ron and Hermione would need to accept that.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione backed away from Ron, who had gone to tilting his head, staring at Harry again. Harry raised his eyebrows annoyed. The silence stretched on.</p><p> </p><p>“I still don’t think you dating him is a good idea, Harry.” Hermione said. Harry opened his mouth angrily, but she held up her hands and went on, “but we’re willing to let you, for now. We just don’t want to see you get hurt. You understand.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt a rush of emotions, anger at ‘let’, touched at ‘we don’t want to see you get hurt’, and a bit annoyed at her ‘you understand.’ “You can’t <em>let</em> me do anything. If I want to see Draco, I’ll see him, if I want to run down to the Great Hall stalkers, you can’t stop me. I know that you two care about me, but you’re not my parents, and you don’t need to act like it. I can live my own life without your direction.”</p><p> </p><p>Ron glared and opened his mouth, but Hermione put a hand on his arm. She looked annoyed, but her voice was rather sickly sweet. “That’s alright, Harry. Whatever you’re feeling is totally normal.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stared at her in confusion. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“I just mean that it’s ok, and everything’s going to be fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, mate,” Ron said, scratching the back of his head. “You’re still our friend. That’s not about to change just for Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?” Harry asked, starting to feel better. They both nodded, and Harry leaned forward to hug him. They both patted him on the back.</p><p> </p><p>Harry pulled back and wondered why their smiles looked so fake.</p><p> </p>
