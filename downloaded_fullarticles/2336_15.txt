    <p>
  <span>Basilton Grimm-Pitch had resigned himself to being known as “that gay British guy”. But actually, he was excited at the prospect. He was going to be one of a kind when he moved to America for a fresh start. New country, new me, you know? In England, people had always thought he was attractive and mysterious and super straight. And for a while, Baz tried to convince himself that he was, for his father’s sake. In fact, he had dated every girl in the class just to try and prove/make himself hetero, but to no avail. Baz had come to realize that there was no changing the fact, and so in this new country, he was ready to accept his queerness, embrace it, really. So imagine his surprise when one of the first people he meets in America is gayer and possibly more British than he is. Well, the boy was at least posher than Baz. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>.:.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the first day of high school, Baz was strolling through the aisles of the library before class, when one of the books caught his eyes. The spine read “How Beautiful the Ordinary” in small, green font and underneath that, “Twelve Stories of Identity” in a smaller, blue font. He pulled it out of its home on the shelf and was reading the back cover when he felt someone next to him giving him a thorough once over. Glancing up, he let his eyes lazily rake over the girl’s curvy body. From her neatly groomed toenails framed in heels, up over smooth legs that were tucked under her short black skirt, up over her too tight blouse with a few unbuttoned buttons, and then up to her perfectly painted red lips that rested in a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And who might you be?” At first, Baz didn’t register what she had said, let alone that she was even asking him a question. He was too busy watching her flawless lips form the words when he noticed that she had perfectly straight white teeth. Of course, she did. Damn, Americans. His eyes finally met the girl’s and she raised a magnificently well-groomed eyebrow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gay,” he answered shortly before turning back to the smallish book in his hands. Baz could feel the girl’s entire demeanor change. She stopped sticking her chest and arse out, uncrossed her legs and slouched a bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank God,” the girl sighed, with more than a little relief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pardon?” Baz inquired with a slight glance at the girl. She shook her head and Baz watched her short hair follow her movements, then fall right back into place. The back of the girl’s hand was now in Baz’s line of sight. He took it and gently placed a kiss on it, instincts kicking in, as she introduced herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The name’s Pansy. Parkinson.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pleasure,” Baz returned. “Basilton Grimm-Pitch, but everyone just calls me Baz.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I noticed you have an accent, are you from England?” Pansy questioned. Baz grinned widely. Everything was going swell. He came out already, introduced himself without her questioning his name and now they had established he was foreign. This was going much smoother than he had thought it would.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy cut him off. “That’s cool. My best friend is also from England! He moved here in the sixth grade so he still has that cute accent like you do. He’s gay, as well. Even if he won’t admit to it, yet.” She spoke with a large grin on her perfect lips, showing off her perfect teeth.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Baz responded, deflating slightly. Well, that put a dent in things. If people were to ever ask, ‘Hey, you know that gay British guy?’, others would have to respond ‘Which one?’, and well, that just wasn’t very one of a kind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy seemed ignorant to the problem that was consuming Baz’s attention at the moment and quickly grabbed one of his hands in hers, dragging him after her towards the corner of the library. “Come on, you should meet him. I have the feeling that the two of you will get along really well!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a boy at the round table in the corner, enraptured by a book, his glasses barely resting on the tip of his thin nose. The first thing Baz had noticed about the boy was the whitest blond hair that he had ever seen. Then he noticed how pristine the boy looked. His posture was perfect and he was dressed sharply in a crisp, starchy white shirt, a gray argyle sweater vest, and beige dress pants that fell precisely to his sharp ankle bones. And that’s when Baz noticed how skinny and pale the boy was. It looked as if he hadn’t been fed in a while. But ironically enough, he was chewing on the tip of his finger, as if he were very concerned about something in his novel. Pansy cleared her throat loudly and the boy startled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Draco, darling, look! I’ve made a new friend!” she exclaimed happily, nudging Baz towards the table. Draco peered at the pair, made a vague noise of acknowledgment, then returned to his book. Pansy pulled out a chair from the table and made herself comfortable. “He’s a Brit, like you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he now?” the boy, Draco, asked obviously not very interested. Pansy shot a quick glance at Baz and noticed he was awkwardly standing close by. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baz, honey, take a seat!” She motioned to the table and Baz gently pulled out a chair and tried to sit down, his bag still on his back, and the book still in his hands, making the whole ordeal quite awkward to watch. Baz watched as Pansy rolled her dark eyes framed by long fake lashes at him before she turned her attention back to Draco. “He’s also gay, like you!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco snapped his book shut angrily and yanked his glasses off. “Pansy, no matter how much you insist, I am not gay!” Pansy just smirked knowingly, and Draco rolled his eyes, clearly annoyed. Then he finally turned his attention to Baz. Their gray eyes met, a clash of smoke and mirrors. “Nice eyes,” Draco commented, jokingly. Baz flushed slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks. You, too,” he responded quietly, before looking away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baz, huh? Short for Basilton Grimm-Pitch?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baz looked at Draco bewildered. “How did you-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father took it upon himself to make sure I was well informed. He made me learn and memorize influential British figures and their families, in case I were to ever meet one. Never have. That is, until today,” Draco shared folding his glasses, and then placing them to hang off his shirt collar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, why would your fath-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father is a politician. He works the system in any way that he can, and he wants me to do the same.” Draco seemed to hold a bit of a resentful and sarcastic tone about the subject, and a bitter look crossed his face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Did you move here because of your father’s job?” Baz asked, finally able to finish a question. Draco simply nodded. “Same here. My father, as you know, is the founder and CEO of a major oil company, Grexco. They’re opening up a branch here and they want my dad to be here to help set it all up, so he had to move and my family came with.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, that’s fun!” Pansy chimed in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not really, Pans,” Draco chirped smartly, before opening his book again, obviously finished with the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy rolled her eyes, something she seemed to do quite often, before turning her attention towards Baz.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So when did you move?” she asked, trying to make conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Beginning of June. But it’s funny, you know, I’ve been here for two months, and I’ve hardly seen the city,” Baz replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, one day Blaise and I will have to give you a tour.” She perked up. “Say. Where is Blaise?” She seemed to be carefully searching the library.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably off with some slut,” Draco answered without looking up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ooh! That reminds me!” She leaned forward, almost conspiratorially, and dropped her voice to a whisper. “Harry Potter is bi.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I call bull shit,” Draco responded, putting down his book. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no! It’s true,” Pansy assured, a bit too enthusiastically. “He came out this summer! Over Instagram! Posted a real artsy photo with a long caption explaining how he felt and how he discovered himself. And plus, I’ve heard from a lot of people talking about just how good he was at “discovering” his bisexuality. All summer long. With various people. ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well. See? He’s only identifying as bi so that he can whore himself out to anything that walks, like Blaise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone dropped into the chair next to Baz. “You know that I’m straight, Draco.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not even half as straight as all the dicks that you suck,” Draco retorted. The boy let out a hearty laugh before he noticed Baz.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Blaise Zabini. You are?” The dark skinned boy had a well-defined jaw, full lips and kind dark eyes that held a glimmer of mischief and a certain cleverness. Baz let his eyes wander over Blaise’s body. The boy was well built, lean and muscular, and Baz could see the veins running up and down his arms.  That’s a turn-on. He was definitely handsome, that’s for certain, and he was holding out a strong hand to Baz.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Basilton Grimm-Pitch. You can just call me Baz, though.” Baz took the hand and shook it firmly, just like his father had taught him when he was younger. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it’s a pleasure to meet you, Basilton,” Blaise Zabini declared with a wide grin. “Pansy, love, come. I’ll walk to you your first class.” He stood and held a hand out to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What a gentleman,” she muttered with a roll of her eyes. “Give me just a sec. Baz, do you have your schedule yet?” Baz nodded, pulled it out of his bag and held it to Pansy. “Oh, look at that! We’ve got almost all of our classes together!” She passed Baz’s schedule to Blaise and then pulled out her phone, handing that to Baz. “Put your number in,” she demanded. So he did as he was told.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My thanks to your father, Draco,” Blaise remarked, still checking over Baz’s schedule.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why? What’d he do this time?” Draco questioned, looking up from the book he had picked up again sometime over the course of the conversation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All of our schedules are very similar. I’m sure some of that was your father’s doing,” he answered with a small grin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’ll tell him that his meddling is much appreciated, Blaise,” Draco responded sarcastically, as he rolled his eyes, before returning to his book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, we’ll see you all during second period,” Blaise announced. “Till then.” Baz watched Blaise and Pansy saunter off, arm in arm. Draco finally dropped his book into his bag and turned towards Baz.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As much as I love those two, I don’t. They know exactly every way to get on my nerves, which is why I’m excited that you’re here.” He informed Baz, not actually looking all that excited. “But just you wait till you meet the rest of the crew, they’re worse.” There was a pause before Draco asked, “So you’re gay, what’s that like?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baz broke into an easy smile before he responded, “Like you wouldn’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco let out a laugh. “Oh, fuck off. Nevermind then, let’s talk about something else. What extracurriculars are you doing this year?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Orchestra, music theory and football. What about you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Latin, French, and gym,” Draco answered. He paused. “Wait, I’m sorry, but did you say football? No offense, but it kind of looks like you would be crushed the instant you walk out on the field.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, er, not American football! I could never.” Baz assured him. He finally took the backpack off his back and placed it in the chair next to him. “I play... soccer?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That makes more sense,” Draco said, with a breath of relief, as the thought of poor lanky Baz playing rough and tumbly American football made him nervous. Well, the thought of anyone playing American football made him nervous. “So, orchestra. What instrument do you play?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Violin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That suits you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks.” There was a slight break in the conversation before Baz continued. “Why are you taking two languages?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Latin seemed interesting because it makes up so many roots for the English language, so I thought it might be helpful when we take the SAT and all those other tests. French because my mother taught me when I was younger and I have quite the love for the language.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s neat.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lull in the conversation was evident but promptly ignored. At that moment the library doors swung open and a group of rambunctious teens walked in, all laughing and joking with one another. Baz watched the group sit down at a table, but only one of them really caught Baz’s attention. He had the curliest blond hair, not white blond like Draco, but like his hair had been spun from gold. He had a few moles dotted randomly over his face and neck. Baz wanted so badly to kiss them and then discover if there were more anywhere else on the boy’s body. The boy smiled, no, beamed at something someone else said and Baz melted in his chair. That smile was radiant, and Baz would do anything to see it again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh,” he heard Draco spit with such disgust. “I retract my earlier statement. Harry Potter and his gang are much worse than my friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Which one is Harry Potter?” Baz asked, barely able to peel his eyes away from the beautiful boy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The tan-ish looking one. He’s half Indian, caused a lot of trouble with the in-laws, so I heard. He’s made it on the football team this year, but that’s pretty much all he has going for him. I mean, he barely passes in his classes, and he’s quite rude and improper. He’s a bloody idiot, but everyone else seems to like him and his bloody green eyes and his unruly hair.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmm-hmm,” Baz hummed, not really paying attention to Draco’s ranting. “And what about the rest of them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about them?” Draco asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are they?” Baz had to find out the boy’s name. Had to see if his name matched his beauty which was highly improbable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,  well first, the ginger, is a Weasley. He’s the second to youngest of seven. Like geez, papa weasel keep it in your pants. Ron is with Hermione at the moment, which I’m sure Pansy isn’t thrilled about. Hermione Granger is the black girl. She’s the smartest in our class, right above me and Penelope Bunce, who I’m sure you’ll meet later. I admire her brains but she’s just a bit too bossy for me. And the last boy is Simon Snow,” Draco explained, pointing and motioning to people at the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Simon Snow? What a ridiculous name,” Baz scoffed. It really was, but that didn’t mean Baz didn’t still absolutely adore the boy and his laughable name. “What do you know about him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco quirked an eyebrow, but answered, “His father is a maniac and his mother is an angel on Earth. He grew up an orphan and was in foster homes for a while before they adopted him a few years ago. Even though he’s been through a lot of shit, he’s a good guy. He’s very kindhearted and always looking out for others. He was always nice to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Baz could say anything, the library doors opened again and a girl walked in. She was angelic. She looked as if she walked straight off of a magazine cover. The most perfect long blonde hair and a brilliant smile. Her large eyes were a kind brown, but Baz could see something cold just resting on the inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, about time she joined,” Draco commented. “That’s Simon’s girlfriend, Agatha Wellbelove. They’re the Golden Couple. They’ve been dating since the sixth grade.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Baz watched as the girl walked to join the group at the table, everyone else in the library had their eyes on her. She gently touched Simon’s shoulder, and when he saw who it was, he stood with a kind smile and kissed her. Baz turned away then and saw that Draco had been watching him with a knowing expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, come on then. Let’s check out that book for you. Before class, I’ll introduce you to Theo.” They stood and walked to the library's front desk.</span>
