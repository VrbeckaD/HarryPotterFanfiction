    <p>Severus Snape, Minerva McGonagall, Filius Flitwick, and Pomona Sprout all landed with a thud. They quickly checked on each other to make sure that the all arrived safe and sound. Taking a deep breath, they took in their surroundings and realized that they were in Diagon Alley.<br/>"It would appear that Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Draco were successful in their endeavor," remarked Severus speaking first. "I will be saddened by their deaths, but their success will enable us to help the four of them get better lives this time around in THIS timeline. Their power levels were more amazing than ever with everything that was wrong with them physically thanks to Dumbledore and the Dark Lord."</p><p>"Their sacrifice will not go unrewarded," assured Pomona patting him gently on the arm. "Too many people hurt Harry and his friends in the old timeline. This will include the Weasleys, Dumbledore, and the Dark Lord. This is especially so of the Dursleys. We have to stop those that will hurt the group. We have to make sure that they don't get hurt again. What are we going to do? Where do we start?"<br/>"We have to start by finding out what day it is for sure," stated Filius. "Once we do that, we need to be on the lookout for Hagrid and Harry. We can assist the teens better once we know where they are and what is going on and so forth. We can split up and guide the teens. Luna isn't due to start Hogwarts until next year, but we can see about getting her in early. Her birthday is just days after the cutoff. I can petition to have her start anyway."</p><p>"I'll be with Hermione if this is the day we think it is," said Minerva. "Draco will be alright with his parents. We need someone to intercept Hagrid and get Harry away from him. While he is a good guy, his loyalty to Albus is too strong at this time. We need to make sure we get a few things done. The four teens need to be in different houses if at all possible. This will assist in getting the unity that is needed to stop the two old fools from destroying the castle again. Getting a couple more students and their families into the plan will also work."<br/>"Draco will still be in Slytherin," stated Severus. "That's the only house his family has ever been in with the exception of Sirius and Nymphadora. Luna can stay with Ravenclaw as her family is of the bloodline. We just have to make sure that she doesn't get bullied anymore. Hermione can stay with Gryffindor as she is the most intelligent other than Harry in that house. This means that we have to get Harry into a house other than Gryffindor or Slytherin. While he carries the blood of both, we don't want him in the rivalry between the two. It will be easier to help him if he is in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff."</p><p>"We have to make sure that we figure out a way to get him away from the Dursleys while we are doing all of this," hissed Minerva. "They have been beating on Harry since he was left with them. I warned Albus not to leave them and he did it anyway. I ought to beat on Albus and see how he likes it. Harry will need a full medical scan and potions to help his body. If I remember right, he told me that Petunia hit him in the head with a frying pan. This would explain his need for glasses."</p><p>"We are on the right day," said Filius pointing to a newspaper. "We should be seeing Harry and Hagrid at any time now. Pomona, why don't you go to Ollivander and tell him that no matter what, Harry is NOT to get the holly and phoenix feather wand. Tell him that you overheard Dumbledore saying that he will use that wand to keep tabs on Harry. If we have to get one custom made for Harry we will, but I want him to have a wand for him and not one that Dumbledore spelled to keep him in line. Swear an oath that Dumbledore did something to the wand. That will cause him to snap it to keep everyone out of harm's way."<br/>"I'll be back soon with Hermione," said Minerva leaving. "I'm already late. We can have all teens together to do their shopping. Have Lucius and Narcissa meet us at the bank. You are good at working with the Malfoy family, Severus. They might listen to you if you tell them what you know regarding Harry and the other teens. Lucius is a powerhouse in the Ministry of Magic right now. With his help, we can get just about anything done."</p><p>"I can actually use this to our advantage as well," remarked Severus as the two women left. "With Harry coming here, I can intercept him while you work on getting Luna here. This will give me the chance to run a medical scan on him. We can have the goblins of Gringotts help us get him away from both the Dursleys AND Dumbledore. I have no doubt that they will work with us as Harry is the last of the Potters and Gryffindors. At this moment, he is also the only technically living Slytherin. Being the head of three Ancient and Noble Houses will open doors for us if we talk to the right people."</p><p>"Sirius made sure in the last timeline to make Harry his heir," remarked Filius. "I think we can use that to our advantage as well. Talk with Narcissa and get her help with it as she is a Black by birth. We have to do something to help the man even if he was a prat in school. I have to go now to get Luna and get her started here. I'll be back soon. Hagrid is almost here. You might want to move now."<br/>With that, Filius headed out. On his way, he waved to Harry and Hagrid, but didn't stop. He was on a mission and he would see it to fruition. Time was of the essence for everyone involved. </p><p>Severus waited until the two got almost to Gringotts before he made his way to the duo.<br/>"Hello Hagrid," he said smoothly. When he got a greeting in return, he turned and leaned over to speak with Harry. "It is a pleasure to meet you Mr. Potter. Your mother and father were good people who helped everyone. I'm sure you are the same when it comes to wanting to help people. You have the same green eyes that your mother had. Unfortunately, you inherited your father's unruly hair. My name is Severus Snape. I will be your potions professor."</p><p>"It's a pleasure to meet you sir," stated Harry quietly, but politely. Severus quickly noted that Harry was very pale and looked like he wasn't feeling all that well. He also noted that Harry hid slightly behind Hagrid while talking to him. "Hagrid was telling me about some of the professors of the school. He said that you, Professor McGonagall, Professor Sprout, and Professor Flitwick are all Heads of House."</p><p>"That is true," stated Severus watching as the boy grew even paler. "Hagrid, why don't I assist Harry in getting his business done here in the alley? I know for a fact that you have a job to do for the Headmaster. The sooner you get that done, the better it would be. I promise you that Harry will be safe here in my care. I will ensure that he gets all of his supplies and a few other things that will make his time at Hogwarts a bit easier."<br/>Hagrid looked uncertain for a moment, but he knew that Severus was right in that he needed to get his other job done. Severus was a Head of House after all and Harry would be safe in his care. He handed Severus Harry's vault key and a few galleons.<br/>"I was going to buy him an owl for his birthday," stated the large man. "Would you get one for him? Something tells me that he didn't get many presents from the Dursleys. They are the worst sort of muggles imaginable. His cousin actually stole the birthday cake I gave him and ate most of it before I saw him. I have to get a spell reversal person out to fix the fat lump."</p><p>"I will arrange it for you," assured Severus slightly gritting his teeth. Harry was looking worse and worse by the moment. "Off you go now Hagrid! Professor Sprout is heading this way and together we can get things started for our Mr. Potter. Minerva and Filius are also heading this way with their charges, and we can get all the teens their belongings and supplies."<br/>With a smile and a pat on the back to Harry, Hagrid left. Once he was gone, Severus beckoned Pomona over and moved Harry to a spot in the shade. She joined him quickly and started to get concerned when she saw the state that Harry was in. The boy was a white as a sheet and looked about ready to faint at any moment.<br/>"Are you alright Mr. Potter?" she asked. "You don't look like you are feeling too well at the moment. Can we get you something? Please don't hesitate to ask. We are here to help you in every way that we can."</p><p>Minerva and Filius both returned with their charges. Lucius and Narcissa were passing with Draco when Severus flagged them down. It was at that moment that Harry collapsed on the ground unconscious. Narcissa and Severus quickly whipped out their wands to run a scan on him.<br/>"This child hasn't eaten in days," stated a shocked Narcissa. "There are signs that some of his internal organs are damaged and bruised. There are also bones that haven't healed properly. We have to get this child to a healer. Who is he and how old is he? He looks familiar, but I can't quite place him."</p><p>"This is Harry Potter," whispered Severus. This caused the three Malfoys and the two preteen girls to raise their eyebrows in surprise. "He is the same age as Draco and Miss Granger. As for his condition, he is in this state thanks to his muggle relatives. I don't know what we can do legally to get him away from where the Headmaster placed him. I was very good friends with Lily. I know for a fact that she didn't want Harry anywhere near her sister's family. Lucius, I hate to ask, but I need you to use your influence in the Ministry to get his custody changed to one of us Heads of House temporarily. It doesn't matter which one, but it needs to be one of us."<br/>"I'll do everything that I can to get this taken care of quickly and efficiently," assured Lucius. "At this moment, I suggest that you take Mr. Potter into Gringotts and let the goblin healers take care of him. They have the best healers around. Narcissa can pay for his care. We may walk a different step, but we are not uncaring people. A child's health and safety are tantamount to us."</p><p>"Draco, I need you to teach Miss Granger some of the Wizarding customs," said Severus. "She is muggleborn, but highly intelligent from what Professor McGonagall tells me. Miss Granger, I need you to listen with open ears to what Draco is going to tell you. The information will keep you from making mistakes that are common amongst those that are muggleborn or muggle raised. Harry will need this same information."<br/>"You don't have to say anything Miss Lovegood," remarked Filius silencing her before she could speak. "We know of your gifts and we know you are more than aware of what is going on. For now, we ask that you keep quiet about what you know as we don't want the wrong people finding out. We will explain everything as we know it to each of you when Harry is well and can understand what we have to say."</p><p>"Can we count on the Malfoys to help us in this?" asked Pomona. "We will need your family to help us stop the two stupidest wizards on the planet. Between the two, they will ruin Wizarding Britain. We can't let that happen this time. We will also need you to get Sirius OUT of Azkaban as he is innocent of the charges he went to jail for. This is the reason that Harry's care is temporarily needed in one of our hands."<br/>"We will help you in all that we can," assured Lucius as Narcissa nodded. Neither missed the phrase "this time". "We will need to know what's going on soon so that we can better help you. For now, let's get Mr. Potter out of the public eye. We need him cleared of all injuries and such. Have the goblins do a heritage check as well. We can stop some of what is going on as he IS the last Potter. I'll be back soon with help from Cornelius."</p><p>"It would be better if you went to Amelia Bones," stated Filius thoughtfully. "She will be more inclined to do something to assist than the Minister will. He is like an ostrich in that he will bury his head rather than listen to the truth despite it slapping him in the face. He will NOT want to oppose Dumbledore and that's what we need right now. We need someone that will not be swayed by Dumbledore's titles. While there, I need you to talk to Griselda Marchbanks. Luna's birthday is two days after the cut off. We NEED her in Hogwarts now with Harry, Draco, and Hermione. These four teens are more special than we all knew."</p><p>"Not to worry," stressed Minerva as the older Malfoys were looking at the quartet strangely. "We WILL tell you everything. Let's get started and then we can sit and talk. We will keep nothing from you. I swear that we will tell you the truth and nothing less. You deserve to know what we know and what COULD happen if we don't do something to stop it. These four teens will have a better life if I have anything to say about it and my three colleagues feel the same way. This is especially so of Harry."<br/>Nodding, Lucius took his leave. Severus quickly picked Harry up. He grimaced as he realized just how light the child was. He shared a look with the other adults and knew that each of them understood what he meant when he hefted the child so easily in his arms. Hermione and Luna were listening as Draco talked about some of the customs that the wizarding world had. In turn, Hermione told of some of the muggle customs that she knew about.</p><p>Upon entering, the adults did their best to shield Harry from the public eye. Filius approached the counter and spoke to the goblin sitting there. The rest of the group all waited quietly as this was going on. They were doing their best to keep Harry out of view in case someone saw him and reported back to Dumbledore.<br/>"We need to speak with Griphook Stonehammer and Chief Ragnok Silverlance please," he said in the native tongue. "This regards Harry Potter in more ways than one. The sooner we get him to a private room, the sooner we can explain what is going on regarding him and his vaults. We need to speak to them regarding healing, finances, and wrongful withdrawals from his vaults. We will also need to do a heritage test on him."<br/>"Right this way," said the goblin after looked at the unconscious boy in Severus' arms. "This is serious and we will help in all ways that we can. Let's get him some privacy while we work on that. We don't want him embarrassed any more than necessary. It wouldn't do for the press to get a hold of this information. There is something slightly off about you, but I can't quite place it."</p><p>The quartet was led to a plush office. From there, the goblin left to get Griphook and Ragnok. It wasn't long before both goblins were in the office with a healer. The healer took one look at Harry and quickly pushed the king of the goblins out of the way. She started barking orders to the two and they quietly got what she needed. In the goblin world, the healers could take command and give order, even to the king, if the situation warranted it. In this case, the three goblins saw that it more than warranted the healer to take command.<br/>An hour later, Harry was awake and coherent. He was quietly and shyly eating a very light lunch while Severus was talking with the healer. Minerva and Pomona were sitting near him while he ate and the other three teens were talking to him. Filius was talking with Ragnok and Griphook while they waited on word from Lucius. Narcissa was pacing back and forth while waiting. She was a furious woman right now. She wanted nothing better than to go to Harry's relative's house and curse them into oblivion. A soft knock sounded on the door. Lucius came in shortly after. </p><p>Following him was Amelia Bones and Augusta Longbottom with their charges. Susan and Neville were quickly introduced to the other kids and they sat with them and waited.<br/>"Amelia is here representing the Ministry, and Augusta is here representing the Board of Governors," explained Lucius. "What did they find out about Harry and his heritage?"<br/>"Nothing yet," answered Narcissa. "It took about an hour to fix all of his damage. He will be on a potions regimen for the next six months at the very minimum. They were able to fix his eyesight as well. His beautiful green eyes will be visible to everyone instead of those awful glasses they made him wear. He will still have to wear glasses for now as his eyesight gets better, but in about six months, he will no longer have to wear them at all. He will be sore for a few days, but they were able to fix most everything. We just have to strengthen his bones and immune system for now. The four teens seem to be getting along for the most part. Harry is painfully shy, but he is trying."</p><p>"We were able to get a few things done for now," said Amelia handing Harry and the four Heads a rolled up piece of parchment. "As of this moment Mr. Potter, you are now going to be cared for by all four Heads of House of Hogwarts. You will NEVER have to go back to the Dursleys ever again. Young Mr. Dursley will be sent to his Aunt Marge, and your Aunt and Uncle will be arrested for child abuse, child endangerment, and from what your medical report states, possible attempted murder."</p><p>"Do you understand what she is saying Harry?" asked Severus politely. "You will NEVER have to go through what you went through ever again. The four of us will take care of you from now on. This means that if you need ANYTHING, you are to ask or talk to one of us. If it is within reason and within our power, we will provide it for you. At the moment, it is only temporary as we are also going to work on getting your godfather out of prison. He is your rightful guardian, but thanks to certain people, he is unable to take care of you at the moment."</p><p>"This doesn't mean he doesn't love or want you, but it does mean at this moment, he can't," assured Amelia. "He has been in prison for the last ten years for a crime he didn't commit. We will be working on getting him out of jail and healthy again so that he CAN take care of you. What I have arranged is that Severus, Minerva, Pomona, and Filius will be secondary guardians for you even when Sirius IS healthy enough. This way, we have more than one person that you can count on to help you."</p><p>"We all want what is best for you Mr. Potter," assured Augusta. "You should have gone to me before you went to the Dursleys. You would have grown up with my grandson Neville. We will work on making sure that the one responsible for all of this is punished until he can't move. You will be safe from here on out if we have anything to say about it."<br/>"Can you all please just call me Harry?" whispered the young wizard. "I thank you all for caring, but it will take me some time. I'm not used to having people care or want to help me. I will try and make sure that I do the best that I can in school and such. I just want to be able to be me for once and not be treated badly for it."<br/>"How about we cover your heritage now?" asked the stately goblin in a mock conspirator voice making the teens all giggle. "Professor Snape has a list of all potions you are to take for the next six months. For now, let's just go around the room and introduce ourselves shall we? I'll start. My name is Chief Ragnok Silverlance. I am the King of the Goblins of the United Kingdom."</p><p>"My name is Griphook Stonehammer," said the second goblin. "I am the newly appointed manager of the Potter vaults. I will make sure that all of your investments, businesses, money, and vaults are taken care of. I will personally be going to Privet Drive to remove the spells that has prevented your mail from getting to you."<br/>"My name is Severus Snape," said man stated. "I am Head of Slytherin House at Hogwarts. I teach potions. I am Draco's godfather. As of today, I am co-guardian of Harry Potter. I was a friend of his mother when we were students ourselves. I am passing that friendship to Harry and his new friends."<br/>"I am Minerva McGonagall," she said speaking next. "I am Head of Gryffindor House. I am also the Deputy Headmistress of the school. I was James Potter's godmother. I teach Transfiguration. I am now co-guardian of Harry Potter."</p><p>"I am Filius Flitwick," stated the diminutive Professor. "I am Head of Ravenclaw House. I teach Charms. I am unique in that I am half human and half goblin. Like my colleges, I am co-guardian of Harry Potter. Lily Potter was my star pupil."<br/>"I am Pomona Sprout," stated the last professor. "I am Head of Hufflepuff House. I teach Herbology. I am also co-guardian of Harry Potter. Neville Longbottom will be my top student. We will be explaining how we know so much shortly. Once the others say who they are, we will explain what is going on."</p><p>"I am Augusta Longbottom," the stately woman spoke next. "I am grandmother to Neville. I am on the Board of Governors for Hogwarts and I am the acting Head of House for the Longbottom name until Neville comes of age. We are an Ancient House that originates from this country. My son and his wife were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and her married family. I have no ill thoughts towards the Malfoys as they have never done anything to my family personally. I will assist in the protection of Harry James Potter."</p><p>"I am Amelia Bones," stated the next woman. "I am the Head of the Magical Law Department. My niece Susan will be starting school with you all. We are a Noble House that originates from this area. She is currently sitting with you and will join you, if you don't mind, in getting all supplies today. I will be assisting where I can to help out Harry Potter as well."<br/>"She is more than welcome," stated Pomona. "She will be in my house anyway."<br/>"My name is Lucius Malfoy," the aristocratic man spoke up next. "Draco is my son and Narcissa is my wife. We are a noble family that originates from France. Our family has been in Slytherin for generations."</p><p>"My name is Narcissa Hecate Malfoy nee` Black," stated Lucius' wife. "Sirius is my cousin. The Blacks are one of about three families left that are both Ancient and Noble. The Potter family is one and I believe that the Lovegood family is the other. There are more, but they have either moved to another country, or they lost their status somehow."<br/>"I'm Draco Malfoy and Lucius and Narcissa are my parents," stated the blond teen boy. "I promise to be friends with Hermione, Luna, and Harry. I will help with keeping my house from harming any of the three. I will also be friends with Susan Bones and Neville Longbottom."<br/>"I'm Hermione Granger," said the bushy haired girl. "I'm what Draco calls a first generation witch. I love books and love learning. I will make sure to be friends with Draco, Harry, Luna, Susan, and Neville. I'm looking forward to starting school."</p><p>"My name is Luna Lovegood," said the girl speaking next. "My mother died when I was nine in a potions accident. My father owns the Quibbler. I have Seer abilities though not to the extent of a Mystic. I just get brief images of things. I will be friends with Harry, Hermione, Draco, Susan, and Neville."<br/>"My name is Susan Bones," said the blond girl. "I am the niece of the Head of the DMLE. I like to read and will enjoy learning alongside the others."</p><p>"I'm Neville Longbottom," said the other shy teen. "I love plants and am looking forward to going to Hogwarts."<br/>"My name is Harry Potter," he said with a sigh. "The goblins said I have to come back next month so they can remove the darkness from my scar. I don't know much about myself as my Aunt never told me. Until Hagrid arrived, I thought my parents were drunks that got killed in a car accident. I will be friends with Draco, Hermione, Luna, Neville, and Susan. I am what Draco called muggle raised. I am also what is called a half-blood."</p><p>"I'm not so sure about that," mused Severus. "I don't think your mother was a muggleborn. That's the other term for a first generation. You have too many Ancient and Noble titles in your family tree to be a half-blood. We will get to your heritage in a moment. We also have to cover the illegal placement of you with people you weren't supposed to go to. We also have to make sure that any withdrawals from your accounts are taken care of. As this is the first time you have ever come to the bank, your vaults should have been in lockdown since your parents died."<br/>"How many vaults do I have, and who would has accessed them?" asked Harry. "I'm sure that this is information that I need to know. If someone has been taking my money, where has it been going and so forth?"</p><p>"I have been looking at that," stated Griphook. "Some of the money taken, and there has been quite a bit of it taken, has gone to Vernon and Petunia Dursley. They got roughly two thousand pounds a month to take care of you. It is apparent that they never used it one you judging by your clothing that is barely staying on your small frame."<br/>"Is there anything legally we can do about that?" asked Minerva. "They have basically been embezzling funds from Harry and not using it on what it was supposed to be used for. We know what is going on with him and his relatives. We would love nothing better than to beat on the worthless excuses for humanity."</p><p>"We will work on it," promised Griphook with a grin at her ferocity. "The Weasley family has been benefitting from the money as well. This has just started within the last two years. Molly Weasley has been receiving money to help with the tuition of her children. This started when Fred and George Weasley started school. This is something that we WILL take care of as we know for a fact that the school has a fund for children like the Weasleys. There is no reason that is should have come out of the Potter family vaults. They are not related to the Potters and have no reason to take the money. HOWEVER, they are not the ones that withdrew the money so we have to tread lightly."</p><p>"I AM GOING TO RING ALBUS DUMBLEDORE'S NECK," hissed Augusta in fury. "He is behind this. I know he is. There is a fund that will help ALL families that aren't able to pay the tuition. That tuition has increased a little each year for the last twenty years. It's no wonder that some families are having trouble paying."<br/>"Last but not least, Albus Dumbledore has been withdrawing funds to pay members of an organization called the Order of the Phoenix," stated Griphook looking murderous. "The old man has been taking hundreds of galleons out of the Potter vaults for years. The only vault that hasn't been touched is Harry's trust vault. The first payment for his tuition came out a few days ago, but that is supposed to happen. However, there are close to one hundred thousand galleons that have been taken out of the Potter Family vaults that have gone to the aforementioned people."</p><p>"Can you get it back?" asked Harry before anyone could speak. "If he is taking this money from me illegally, can we get it all back? That sounds like an awful lot of money he is taking. What is the exchange rate to pounds?"<br/>"Five to one," answered Hermione promptly. "This means that the Headmaster of the school we are about to attend has stolen about a half a million pounds out of your account. Does he even have the right to have access to the vaults in question?"</p><p>"No he doesn't," assured Ragnok. "You can bet that we will be getting Harry's money back from Albus Dumbledore. As he is the one that has been making the withdrawals, he can pay it back. I happen to know that he has that much money and more being saved in an account under an assumed name. We know our business and that money will be taken from him. Harry's money plus twenty percent interest will be repaid by no later than tomorrow. From there, Dumbledore will be fined for his transgressions and be temporarily barred from the bank. I will see to it that Harry's vaults are rekeyed. I shall send him one key and send another to the Minerva McGonagall. That way one of his guardians has a key in case of an emergency."</p><p>Griphook quickly drew up the documents and passed them to Harry to sign. They explained to him what was in the documents and who was to sign with him. With a nod, Harry quickly signed the paper. Severus, Pomona, Filius, and Minerva quickly signed after him. Ragnok added his own signature to the documents so that no one would be able to dispute it. A copy was given to Harry and Minerva. From there, they moved on to the next part of the business they wanted to get done.</p>
