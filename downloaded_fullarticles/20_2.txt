    <p>      David’s hands trembled uncontrollably as he stood on Platform 9 ¾, clutching a small envelope in his hands. His sister Sarah stood beside him, paying him no mind while she searched eagerly for her friends that she hadn’t seen all summer.</p>
<p>      David remember what his mother had told him about breathing when he felt this way. He sucked a deep breath in, held it for three seconds, then slowly let it out. He did this until his heart rate became somewhat normal. The letter in his hands was still shaking.</p>
<p>      “Sarah, I-” he began, turning to his sister, whose robes were swirling after her as she made a beeline to her squealing peers.</p>
<p>      David’s stomach tightened watching the only person he knew there walk away.</p>
<p>      <em>It’s okay, David. You’ve got this. You’ll make friends on the train. People aren’t going to hate you. That’s crazy. Why would they hate you? You’re-</em></p>
<p>      “My name is Jack.”</p>
<p>      David turned quickly toward the voice. Next to him was standing a boy a few inches shorter than himself with scruffy blonde hair and electric blue eyes. His crooked smile gave David an immediate sense of ease.</p>
<p>      “Oh, uh, David,” he replied, his breathing slowly inching toward normal.</p>
<p>      “Hi David. Are you a first year? You look like a first year.” Before David could answer, Jack kept going. “I’m a first year too. Are you excited to start school? I am. My parents told me so many cool stories about Hogwarts. They’re not here right now. They would come, but they have to work. My mom works for the ministry. Isn’t that cool?”</p>
<p>      Just then, a huge, glorious locomotive came barreling into the station, accompanied by a thick cloud of steam.</p>
<p>      “Hey David, do you wanna share a compartment?” Jack asked, lifting his suitcase off the ground where he had set it down. David couldn’t help but notice that he only had the one suitcase while everyone else had multiple bags piled onto a cart.</p>
<p>      David nodded in response to Jack’s inquiry, relieved that he would have one less thing to worry about. He followed Jack toward the train.</p>
<p>      “My dad is a Hufflepuff, and my mom is a Ravenclaw. I don’t really think I have a preference. My mom thinks I’ll be a Gryffindor, but my dad wants me to be a Hufflepuff. I kinda think he just wants that because of house pride,” Jack rambled as David followed closely, trying to listen, but finding that difficult as his anxiety heightened and they boarded the train. It seemed like David and Jack were the only people there who didn’t have teary families to say goodbye to. David realized just how grateful he was for Jack.</p>
<p>      Jack led David to an empty compartment and the boys haphazardly stashed their luggage away in the overhead. Jack was also still chattering away when they took seats opposite one another.      </p>
<p>      “What about you?” Jack asked, then paused for the first time in a solid 15 minutes.</p>
<p>      “What?”</p>
<p>      “Houses, parents, what house you think you’ll be in?”</p>
<p>      “Oh, my parents are muggles,” David answered, his eyes darting to the floor. “But my older sister is a Gryffindor. She always tells me she thinks I’ll be a Ravenclaw.”</p>
<p>      “No way! That’s so cool. Does she still go to Hogwarts? What year is she?” Jack quizzed excitedly.</p>
<p>      “She’ll be a fourth year.”</p>
<p>      “You’re so lucky! She can tell you all the secrets!”</p>
<p>      David laughed. “I doubt it. She’s a little protective.”</p>
<p>      “Still. Cool. Hey maybe we’ll get sorted into the same house!” Jack exclaimed.</p>
<p>      “Maybe,” David replied. He hoped more than anything that he and Jack would get sorted into the same house. Then he would at least have a friend. Even if the friend was a little annoying.</p>
<p>      A screeching whistle shot through the train, followed by frantic running footsteps up and down the hallway.</p>
<p>      “The train must be leaving,” Jack said, his excitement apparent. On cue, the train lurched slightly and David’s fingers instinctively tightened on his seat. Jack pressed his face to the window.</p>
<p>      David’s thoughts began to race. <em>This is real. This is happening. Oh God this is happening. I can’t do this. I can’t-</em></p>
<p>      “Look! The trees! Davey, we’re going to Hogwarts!” Jack exclaimed, turning to David.</p>
<p>      Looking at Jack’s massive grin, his wild hair sticking out in every direction, and sky blue eyes glittering, the voices in David’s head-just for a moment-went quiet.</p>
<p>      He inhaled deeply through his nose. “Yeah,” he sighed. “We are.”</p>
