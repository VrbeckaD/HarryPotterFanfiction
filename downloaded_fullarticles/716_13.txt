    <p>It’s 11pm and Gryffindor common room is empty, except for one fifth year student sitting next to the fireplace and reading muggle book called “The Lord of the Rings” and drinking hot chocolate. Remus Lupin is a great student, one of the best in their class, just behind Lily Evans. His two best friends, James Potter and Sirius Black are supposed to be back from their detention serving with Professor McGonagall any minute now. It was full moon few nights ago and for our dear friend Remus Lupin it meant that he changed into a werewolf. He was still weak and hot chocolate and books always helped him. Around 11:30pm he heard noise from the outside of the common room, he right away recognized voices of his two friends. As the portrait of the Fat Lady moved, two 16 year old boys entered the Gryffindor common room, followed by not so quiet conversation.</p><p>“I’m telling you, James! It was nothing!” shouted long-haired boy like he was defending himself.<br/>
“Sure thing, Padfoot, if you say so.” A bit shorter boy with glasses said while walking into the common room. “Oh hi Remus! Why aren’t you sleeping?”<br/>
“I wasn’t tired, plus those scars still hurt a bit. How was detention with Minnie?” Remus was happy to see his friends, maybe more happy to see Sirius than James but he kept that to himself.<br/>
“Well I think that she more looks on that like detention for her not for us but okay.” Joked James. “I’m going to sleep now, Sirius, you going?”<br/>
“Nah, I’ll stay with Rem here for a bit, night Prongs.”<br/>
James left to their dormitory, you could definitely hear Peter’s snoring from there. Sirius sat down next to Remus, who was still reading the book. Not even looking up, Remus started a conversation.<br/>
“So what was all that about Siri, your entrance that could’ve waked half of the people here?” Remus asked, as the sound of his teeth touched the glass with hot chocolate followed his words.<br/>
“Nothing important. James thought I was flirting with Melanie and I really was not!” his voice sounded really disturbed. It was quite unusual since he had been with many girls in past two years and Remus couldn’t understand it.<br/>
“So what? You flirt all the time. I can’t see why were you so upset with it.” Remus indeed saw no logic in his anger, but deep down he always hated when Sirius flirted with so many girls.<br/>
“Nothing Moony. Absolutely nothing.” Said Sirius and started playing with his hair, clearly upset. Remus knew he only plays with his hair when he is either really upset or drunk. He clearly wasn’t drunk now.<br/>
“Sirius, really. What’s wrong? Do you want to go out for a smoke maybe?” Sirius did hide his bad habit of smoking from some people, but Remus knew. Of course he knew.<br/>
“I would kill for a cigarette right now but I don’t have any.” He smoked for two years now, his family situation didn’t help him quit at all. He sometimes even denied having family at all. His brother was 2nd year Slytherin but he honestly did nothing wrong to Sirius, he even wanted to talk to him. Their mother, Walburga Black. She was an awful person, always abusive towards her oldest son and she used every chance to take her rage out on him. Sirius sometimes came back from any trip to home all bruised up and mentally unstable. After the first time she used Crucio curse on him, he tried to kill off the pain in cigarettes and since then he didn’t stop.<br/>
“Well luckily for you, I have them. Luckies right?” Remus didn’t smoke, well not always. He usually smoked during the week after his transformation, nicotine was calming him in some way.<br/>
“Yes, how did you know?” of course he knew. He knew what his favorite brand of cigarettes was, he even knew that one won’t be enough.<br/>
“Doesn’t matter Pads, come on.” They got up from the floor and using the teleportation spell that Remus mastered just few days ago, they appeared at the Astronomy tower. Remus got a pack of red Lucky Strikes out from his pocket and handed Sirius one cigarette. Sirius got the lighter from his jacket and lighted their cigarettes.<br/>
“So.. what was that REALLY about?” as soon as he asked that, Sirius blew off the smoke in his face, looking irritated more than before.<br/>
“Well you see, James did think I was flirting with Melanie, which I wasn’t. But I wasn’t pissed about it. I mean I was but not entirely.” Remus was more confused now, his answer said nothing.<br/>
“So what? Please Pads explain it to me, I want to help. If I can do anyt…” and he stopped. Sirius lifted the right sleeve of his shirt and revealed deep scars. They were fresh, like they were cut just a moment ago, some of them were still bleeding.<br/>
“What the fuck Sirius! Why? Did you..” no, he couldn’t, he would never.<br/>
“Walburga.” He just said that and got one long smoke from his cigarette and covered the scars. Remus knew she abused him but he never knew it was that bad. Plus those scars looked fresh and he didn’t knew how it was possible when their spring break was over two weeks ago and Sirius wasn’t home since then.<br/>
“But Siri, those look like they were just made. Do they hurt?”<br/>
“They don't, at least not that much. The bitch put a spell on me, whenever I say something she might not like, the scars start forming.” His white shirt was now crimson red from the blood.<br/>
“Sirius you must do something about it, she can't do that to you.” Remus was now feeling both sad and angry, he couldn't stand looking Sirius suffer like that and he was angry at his mother for doing that.<br/>
“Just leave it Moons, it doesn't matter. I can't do anything about it.”<br/>
“Yes it does matter, I'll find a healing spell for that. What did you do to make them bleed anyway, if you want to tell me of course.” Sirius couldn’t possibly know how Remus felt about him but Remus was always doing anything he can to help him.<br/>
“I can’t, they’ll start bleeding again. I would love to tell you but I can’t” Remus understood. What was so bad to get those scars bleeding he didn’t know but he understood. He just silently came closer to Sirius and wrapped his hands around him. They stood in silence for a while when Remus finally spoke.<br/>
“We will figure it out somehow, I promise Pads. You want another cig?” his voice was silent, almost impossible to be heard.<br/>
“Yes please. Thanks Moony, thank you so much. For everything.”<br/>
“You know I never minded helping you. Is there something else I could do, other than getting you cigarettes?” they fell silent again, Sirius said nothing, instead a small smile spread over his face. They moved to sit at the bench that was there. He knew he had to do something about those scars. They sat in silence for at least half of hour, just looking at each other, lighting cigarette after cigarette when Sirius finally said something.<br/>
“Hey Moony?”<br/>
“Yes?” they were both surprised at how their voices sounded lifeless but warming at the same time.<br/>
“I’m sorry if I was rude to you before, I never wanted that.”<br/>
“It doesn’t matter Pads, I understand. Do you want to go inside?”<br/>
“No, not just yet, I want to look at the stars for a while.” He lifted his head to the sky. Remus felt like he didn’t need him anymore, he felt like he was spoiling the moment. He got up and started going when Sirius stopped him.<br/>
“Stay. Please stay. I want to give you something.” He was confused but he did as Sirius told him to. After few moments Sirius took something out of his jacket. A little black book. “Here. Read it, please.” It was his diary. Remus opened it but didn’t knew if he should read just specific dates. Sirius looked at him, he saw the confusion all over his face. “It will explain everything, go to 9th April. Start from there.”<br/>
Remus turned few pages and started reading the diary of the person he wanted more than anything.<br/>
<br/>
“<em><strong>April 9th 1975</strong></em><br/>
The bitch tortured me again. Today was the worst. All I could think about were his Beautiful eyes, she found out, she was furious. But his eyes. Oh those beautiful things. If he only looked at me like I look at him. The scars are burning now, she meant for them to hurt. I don’t know how she found out, but she did. I need to sleep. Maybe everything will be better when I go back to Hogwarts and see him. Two more days.<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>April 10th 1975</strong></em><br/>
I dreamt of him. Finally I had the guts to tell him how much I loved him. She beat me up again. For no reason now. One more day.<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>April 11th 1975</strong></em><br/>
I got his owl today, I can’t wait to see him tomorrow, finally I’ll be away from her. I’ll be free.<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>April 12th 1975</strong></em><br/>
At the train he was sitting next to me, I wanted to kiss him so much, I had no idea how much I wanted it until I saw him. He was reading one of his books by that Tolkien dude, seems he enjoyed it. I didn’t want to interrupt him.” Few pages were just dates, they weren’t filled with anything.<br/>
<br/>
“<em><strong>April 20th 1975</strong></em><br/>
We were sitting together in Transfiguration, he was so focused on the class, I was focused at him, he was beautiful, his hair got bit longer, but his eyes, oh they stayed the same, as beautiful as ever. I’ve got detention with James tonight, maybe I’ll tell him, I need an advice. After all I helped him with Evans. I need to tell someone. But I can’t tell him, not just yet.”<br/>
<br/>
“Sirius..” Remus was puzzled. He had no idea how Sirius felt about him. No, this couldn’t be true, he thought, Sirius was straight.<br/>
“Yes. It’s about you. I’m sorry if you don’t feel the same way but I had to tell you somehow.” Remus looked at him in disbelief. The person he had a huge crush on for two years was now telling him that he felt the same.<br/>
“Siri…” he was interrupted.<br/>
“Just don’t say anything please, let me cry myself out. I know you never felt like that about me.” Sirius started crying. Real big tears were soaking his, now already wet shirt. Instead of saying something, Remus just sat in the way to look at him in the eyes, those grey eyes were now filled with tears. With one hand, Remus wiped out the tears and moved closer. He moved Sirius' head closer to his and pressed his lips softly on those lips he had dreams about for so long. They weren’t like in the dreams, they were salty from tears but still so perfect. Sirius kissed back, as much as he could, but still crying. Their tongues met now, twisting and wrapping around inside of their mouths. Their teeth even scratched few times but they didn’t stop kissing. Both of them were crying now, but not on sad way like Sirius cried before. Those were sweet tears of joy. Kiss lasted for at least ten more minutes but it was interrupted by Sirius’ silent scream. Remus looked at him, now scared.<br/>
“Siri, what’s happening, are you okay??”<br/>
“The scars, they are bleeding again.” He lifted his sleeve and revealed now seriously bloody arm.<br/>
“We need to go to the hospital wing! Come on, grab my hand.” He teleported them to the hospital wing and searched for Madam Pomfrey.<br/>
“Oh Merlin! Boys what happened? Why aren’t you in your dormitory? And what happened to him?” she was confused but she started cleaning his wounds right away.<br/>
“His mother put a spell on that, he can’t stop the bleeding and they bleed on their own when he says some things, do you know how to get rid of it?” Remus was honestly scared, now more than ever.<br/>
“Of course I can heal him, but you need to go back to your dorm.”<br/>
“Please madam Pomfrey, can he stay?” he looked at her with tears in his eyes.<br/>
“Okay, I need to heal you first” she said few incantations and put bandages on Sirius’ arm and she left.<br/>
“Lay next to me, please.” Said Sirius still a bit shook by everything that happened.<br/>
“Of course.” Remus carefully laid next to him, wrapping his hands around him. At one point Sirius moved a bit, just as much to look him in the eyes. Their lips met again, it was as sweet as an hour ago. Their tongues now twisting around and their now happy smiling faces looked like they found heaven. After a while of kissing, Sirius finally stopped to just look at Remus, his grey eyes were glowing, he felt happy like never before, laying in bed with person he loved for a while. He finally found happiness.<br/>
“I love you, Remus Lupin, and I promise I’ll never stop loving you until I die.” Said Sirius softly, cuddling up while finding a perfect sleep position.<br/>
“I love you too, Sirius, always have, always will.” Remus intentionally didn’t say his last name, he knew he hated it. He wrapped his hands around the other boy and two of them were asleep now.</p><p> </p>
