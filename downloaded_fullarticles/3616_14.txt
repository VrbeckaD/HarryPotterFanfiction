    <p>Two figures appeared with a loud crack on the dimmed London streets, their dark cloaks billowing furiously as they walked. The figures almost blended into the background, as the street was lit with only a few meagre lamps, allowing them a cover of almost complete darkness. </p><p>It was perfect.</p><p>They walked with a hurried pace down the cobbled road, talking in hushed voices as they went, the pouring rain not deterring them from whatever task lay ahead of them. The task must have been extremely important as they were walking extremely fast; their silhouettes blurred against the skyline. It wasn’t until another figure stepped out from the shadows and pulled them violently through a shop door, that the cloaked beings were finally halted.</p><p>“What are you thinking Severus?” The new voice hissed, gripping the neck of the nearest figure’s cloak, pulling their face close to his. “You could have exposed us all!”</p><p>“Get a grip Pertrude, you know we aren’t as careless as the rest.” Severus snarled in reply, batting Pertrude’s hand off his cloak, his face contorting into an expression of disgust at the man’s slimy fingers touching It. His cloak was worth more than that man’s life, so for Pertrude to even lay a finger on it was a downright insult. </p><p>Pertrude winced at the gesture, slinking towards the woman who stood on Severus’ left, her feminine features only slightly illuminated by the candles which floated above her head. </p><p>“Ella my dear, you of all people must understand the risks...” He wrung his hands together nervously, his confidence from earlier quickly dissipating. He looked expectantly to Ella, her blank expression transforming into such distaste, it perfectly mirrored that of Severus’. </p><p>“You, of all people...” Ella began, mocking his previous tone, “should understand the importance of our mission! You pulling us in here and away from the task at hand jeopardises everything!”</p><p>Pertrude, beginning to understand, began to back away, his hands in the air and a terrified expression etched onto his face. He knew all to well that he had crossed a line, a line that many didn’t come back from alive. “Well it was just my misunderstanding, I was only doing what I thought was best for the dark lord.” Laughing nervously, he suddenly found himself pinned up against the wall, two menacing looking wands pointing at his throat. “Honestly, I thought I was doing the right thing! Please Severus! We were friends once, no?” </p><p>Severus growled at this, jabbing his wand against the man’s voice box, spitting down at the man’s filthy shoes. “Don’t even dare make such an accusation, you filthy squib. I never was your friend and I never will be. Learn your place in the world.” Pertrude whimpered, nodding his head furiously. </p><p>“I will, oh dear Severus, I will!” The genuine gratitude in his voice was immensely grating; and as Severus removed his wand from the Squib’s voice box, he muttered a curse under his breath. And he hoped to God it would hurt like hell. </p><p>A blinding red flash erupted within the shop, sending vials and books flying. Ella covered her eyes from the blast, a small smile erupting from her lips as the after affects of the curse slowly wore off. “You surprise me Severus, I didn’t think something so meagre as a thankyou could set that temper of yours off.”</p><p>“Well the dark lord would never have allowed such filth to ruin our plans like he just did. I was going to dispose of him afterwards anyway.”</p><p>Ella giggled, covering her mouth in the most ladylike way possible, making it all that more sadistic. “Glad to hear” she remarked, wondering why their masters even attempted to reason with the likes of Pertrude. She guessed it was because they had connections - but even they wore out their use eventually. </p><p>Suddenly noticing Severus walking away, Ella skippedd out after him, laughing as she caught up. “So, what now?” Severus merely grunted in reply and with a loud crack, the street was empty once more. </p><p> </p><p>——————————————</p><p>The boy awoke with a start, beads of sweat streaming down his forehead. He had had a nightmare - again, another strange one which made so little sense it scared him. Dark shadowy figures were a constant in his life nowadays; they plagued his waking and sleeping hours. It was honestly a miracle he was even alive. </p><p>Hauling himself out of bed, he pulled on a jumper and scarf, before slowly trudging towards the bathroom. He knew he looked awful, the constant torture of nightmares and late nights were getting to him more than they should. But for some unexplained reason, he found looking in a mirror a source of comfort. He guessed it was because it reminded him he was still alive, but he could never be quite sure. </p><p>Gazing into the mirror, he tousled his black hair slightly, not that it needed it, it was just another routinely comfort he had fallen into since arriving here. It didn’t help much, he couldn’t help but feel ‘off’ almost all the time. He presumed the change in environment was affecting him in ways he couldn’t yet comprehend, but it wasn’t the feeling that concerned him the most; it was what the feeling was doing to him.</p><p>Staring even more intently, he remarked his blue- grey eyes, watching for that tiny change that happened whenever he lost control. That flash of gold which appeared whenever he performed magic. </p><p>A glass shattered on the shelf nearest to him. </p><p>It had happened again - he had lost control. It was stupid reallly, to let his emotions overtake his magic, but so much had happened in the last month he no longer felt the powerful warlock who had defeated Morgana’s army in one fell sweep. He felt like a child. </p><p> </p><p>After all, he was one.</p><p>Merlin, the great and powerful warlock of Athurian legend was stuck in his eleven-year-old self’s body, roughly a thousand years in the future.</p><p>Just perfect.</p>
