          <div class="userstuff"><p>I have been in love with Dean Thomas, since our second year at Hogwarts.<br/>
I realized about my love during an afternoon in the winter, Dean and I were played explosive cards in the common room. At that moment, everyone at school was crazy about the petrified, and the threat of the muggle-born. So, Dean did not tell me, but that day I also knew that he was very scared.<br/>
- Seamus, what if we were brothers? Dean told me when was his turn to play.<br/>
- I do not understand, that would be impossible. I said taking the card from him, and stealing his turn. I really do not understand how it would be possible for us to be brothers, he is muggle-born and my mother has never left London magical.<br/>
- You do not know your father and I do not know mine. Dean said folding his arms.<br/>
"And if your father were mine, that means I'm not a muggle, rather a half-blood."<br/>
- Not Dean. I said felt strange.<br/>
- Why not? it would be Cool, besides, I would not have to worry about being, you know, muggle-born. He said with a smile on his face.<br/>
I know why he thinks it might be good for us to be brothers, but I do not like the idea, rather I feel that I hate the idea.<br/>
- I do not think so, I think it would be a catastrophe. I said gotten up the floor, I did not feel well for play anymore.<br/>
-  Why? Dean insisted gotten up too.<br/>
I realized he was upset about my attitude, which made me felt little bad. However, I prefer die before being Dean's brother.<br/>
- I don’t know. I said gone up stairs to our room.<br/>
At first, I thought it was only a phase. I corroborate that this was not the case when Dean start talk about girls; jealousy made my stomach ache, and still burn me inside. Above all, I swear I could give my life for Dean to like the boys too.<br/>
- I already have a date for the Yule Ball, what about you? Dean ask me when we entered the transfiguration class.<br/>
- Nothing yet. I say.<br/>
This whole dance thing makes me very nervous, I do not want to go with any girls, but I'm supposed to. I’m not telling Dean that I like him or that I like some guys, and I think I will never do it.  I'm afraid of losing the friendship that we have. Once, I heard that sometimes the best friends of the Gay guys get scare and put them self away for fear that their friends are in love. Well, I'm already in love; so the best thing for me is stay quiet.<br/>
- What if you invite Lavender? Dean motion lower his voice, Professor Minerva McGonagall start to walk down the hall to review the homework.<br/>
-Why? I ask him curiously.<br/>
I don’t understand why Dean wants me to go to the yule ball. Nevertheless, the idea that Dean wants me there just to see me, is suddenly in my head.<br/>
- I heard that she wants to go with you. Dean says.<br/>
- Thomas, Finnigan. The teacher caught our attention.<br/>
- Hey, you must go, you cannot leave me alone. Dean says even lower.<br/>
- I will invite her then.<br/>
I’m unable to say no to Dean in anything. The true if that all I want right now is been his boyfriend.<br/>
- Great. Dean says putting his hand on my back.<br/>
I love when Dean touches me, innocently clear. Sometimes, I pretend that I do not have enough space on the benches in the dining room, just to get our knees to touch. Also, I ask him to lend me a pen or a parchment, for the sole purpose of let our hands touch a little bit. One time, in a Quidditch game, our team was playing too well, we were both excited, screaming so hard. I swear I was feeling like my throat was swollen. At the end, Harry caught the snitch, Dean turn to look at me, and hug me before I could say a word; that was a very short hug, but it has been the best of my life.<br/>
Anyway, Lavender agree to go to the Yule Ball with me, and I think it's fine. I have known her since my first year, we were always being friends, so I think that we will have a good time. However, I hope she does not want to kiss me. I was listen some girls talk, and they all say they will kiss their partners. It's not that I think that Lavender is ugly, because I know that she is beautiful, it's just that, well you know, I do not like her. I would like my first kiss, which I know will not be with Dean, to be with someone special.<br/>
- How do I look? Dean ask me when he came out of the bathroom. He wears a robe of bottle black, and he looks handsome, his eyes shine.<br/>
- Great. I say without being able to stop looking at him.<br/>
When I look at his pink lips and his long neck, I can only think about kissing him. I want to kiss his lips right now.<br/>
- You look good too. Dean says, turning his back on me and going back to the bathroom.<br/>
I Turn to look at me in the mirror, I must stop thinking about Dean that way, I cannot spend the whole night wanting to fill his face with saliva every time I see him. Moreover, I'm supposed to go with Lavender, as much as I want to deny it, I'm supposed to be thinking about kissing Lavender right now.<br/>
Even though I tried, I could not see Lavender in the same way I saw Dean. It's that because for my eyes there is nothing more perfect than Dean; his dark skin, the way his gestures when he speaks, and how subtle and smooth it is his voice. Therefore, while I was watched him dance with his date I started to felt sick, we should be danced together at that moment or maybe we should be sat, held hands.<br/>
The feel like I'm tired of hiding who I am, I wish I could tell him, so I no longer should pretend that I want to be with a girl.<br/>
- I'm leaving. I tell Lavender when Dean come back to our table.<br/>
- Wait. Dean say, following me.<br/>
- What? I scream him crossing arms.<br/>
I feel angry with him even though I should not, he has not promise me anything, I'm even here because I want.<br/>
- You should not leave Lavender just like that, say goodbye. He says holding me by the hand and pushing me back to the table.<br/>
What the hill does Dean care if I say goodbye or not, what the hill I care about Lavender.<br/>
Dean came back to the room with me, I do not know if he did it because he is tired, or if he just wants to follow me. I threw myself into bed as soon as we arrive, I feel too tired, as if I had been carrying a huge weight all night, and maybe I did; maybe my secret weighs more than I think.<br/>
Dean seat next to me and I don’t say anything, my eyes are killing me and I prefer to keep it close. Then, he put his hand on my back, almost in the butt, he moves it up and down, like a caress. I feel so comfortable, as if I am in a dream, hallucinating rather. When I hear his sweetie voice calling my name, was enough; I turned quickly to look at him, we are very close, that close that almost I could smell his breath.<br/>
- Were you afraid to kiss? He asks me.<br/>
- What? I ask with a hole in the chest, I’m very nervous.<br/>
- Yes, that's why you wanted to leave, because you did not want to kiss her. He says moving in the bed to be more comfortable, I suppose.<br/>
- No, I do not know. I tell him without knowing what else to say.<br/>
The truth is that I was afraid that Lavender would kiss me. However, it is not the only reason for that I wanted to leave.<br/>
- Me too, I just do not feel ready. He says Humidifying his lips, those beautiful lips.<br/>
- I does. I say almost without thinking, right now in my mind, I just can imagine me kissing him.<br/>
- So? Why did you leave? He wants to know while he stands up.<br/>
- I do not like her. I tell him while I am filling my heart with courage. I will tell; I will tell him that I like boys.<br/>
- But, she is very cute. Dean say removing his robe, and standing in front my semi naked.<br/>
In this same moment, I forget what I’m going to say.<br/>
- But ... I babble looking at His belly button, his abdomen, his neck, his skin.<br/>
I am feeling that my words are escapes, my air is vanishing.<br/>
- I guess she's not your type. Dean tell me taking off his pants.<br/>
My God, his legs. Now, I am discovering that I love Dean Thomas's legs.<br/>
- No ... I say while Dean walk to the bathroom, and thanks God, because I do not know if I can hide the bud between my pants for a longer time.<br/>
When he left I running to downstairs, and I put myself into the closet f the common room. Then, I take a breath and I lower my pants, I must confess that I’m already a pro doing this. I am thinking in: Dean's lips, Dean kissing me, me kissing his lips and neck, and Dean touching me. I am thinking in me playing music with every part of his body. My breathing increase, the beating of my heart became so strong that I afraid that someone listen me, but I don’t stop of touch myself.<br/>
At this point, every day it becomes harder to hide what I feel for Dean.</p></div>
