    <p>Iruka Umino had never in his wildest dreams imagined that he would be able to get into the elite Mahoutokoro School of Magic. Only 6,500 students were generally allowed in attendance so it was quite competitive to get in. Although the school itself insisted that placement was random, they could not deny that many students who graduated from Mahoutokoro often went on to do spectacular things for the country of Japan. Certainly it would look great on a resume. </p><p>Iruka didn’t know if it was luck, magic, or credentials that got one in after all, but he was overjoyed to be chosen. </p><p>	When he arrived, Iruka was very impressed with the school. It was magnificent in structure, most of it housed inside its own island’s mountains. The entrance and the main halls were the most visible parts and the only parts that could be seen, even if only by shape from the front of the building. This was where the sorting would soon begin.</p><p>	Upon entering, in two straight lines along with a bunch of other new students, Iruka couldn’t help but keep looking around, wide eyed at the magnificent architecture and all of the new magical objects. Although he was a Pureblood he wasn’t exactly rich and he’d always been amused by magical items. As he looked around he forgot to pay attention to where the lines of students were going. </p><p>Curiously he began to wander around, following from object to object as if he were in a museum, until he glanced over and realized that he was lost and there were no other students his age to be found.</p><p>	For a minute Iruka felt nervous. He was alone in a new school with no one around, older or younger, and he had no idea what would happen to him if he missed his sorting. Would he not be sorted? Would he be kicked out? Would anyone even notice?</p><p>	He stopped for a moment trying to retrace his steps, but realized he’d come quite far and as he knew nothing of the building only ended up back where he started. </p><p>	‘Everyone is probably at the sorting already,’ he thought to himself wringing the hem of his robes and biting his lip nervously, ‘only a crazy person would miss it.’</p><p>	Iruka regretted letting his curiosity get the best of him. Panicking, he began to run through the halls in the opposite direction he’d tried before, his eyes starting to tear as he tried not to imagine the worst case scenarios that piled in his head. He ran to escape them, but still they followed him down the hall and only relented when he let out a sob in front of the door to the library. </p><p>	There Iruka stopped, pressing his forehead against the door’s window, before deciding that crying wasn’t going to get him anywhere, but perhaps there would be some helpful finding spell in the library that he could use. He only hoped it wasn’t too late.</p>
