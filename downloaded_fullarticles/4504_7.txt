          <div class="userstuff"><p>~</p><p>Too Soon, Too Late</p><p>~</p><p>“We’re going to be late if we don’t leave like five minutes ago.”</p><p>“Please. Everyone who’s anyone knows parties don’t really begin until at least an hour after the official start time.” </p><p>“This is Hermione’s party, though. I’m betting she’s expecting us to be on time.” </p><p>“She <i>has</i> met us, right?” </p><p>“I used to be punctual before I started dating you.” </p><p>“Probably because you didn’t have a sexy boyfriend at home.” </p><p>“Wait, what are you—? Why are you undressing? You’re supposed to be putting clothes <i>on</i>, not removing them.” </p><p>“I feel like having a wank.” </p><p>“Right now? Shouldn’t you’ve taken care of that in the shower earlier?”</p><p>“Who says I didn’t? For your information, all Malfoys have high sex drives.” </p><p>“I’d rather not think about the sex drives of any other Malfoys, thanks.” </p><p>“Suit yourself. Anyway, you may as well relax while you wait. Or you could join me.” </p><p>“You…Argh!” </p><p>“You look tense, Harry. You know what’s great for relieving tension? A nice, slow wank.” </p><p>“You’re such as arsehole!” </p><p>“Is that supposed to be an insult? You clearly love my arsehole since you’re always sticking your tongue— Oof! Success! Nice of you to join me.” </p><p>“What was I supposed to do when you were fondling your dick in front of me?”</p><p>“I’m not complaining. Although, to get the most out of this, I’d suggest you get naked, too.” </p><p>“Ugh! Fine. <i>Evanesco</i>.” </p><p>“There. Isn’t that better?” </p><p>“Whatever. You get to explain to Hermione why we’re late. Now roll over.” </p><p>“<i>You</i> roll over. And I have the perfect explanation. Although, are you sure you want Granger to know we were late because you couldn’t resist fucking me?” </p><p>“How can I fuck you if you won’t…? Oh fuck.” </p><p>“That’s how. Now, isn’t this an improvement? Unless you <i>don’t</i> want me to ride your cock?” </p><p>“Shut up and move…Oh, Merlin!” </p><p>“Mmm, Salazar, you feel—”</p><p>“….”</p><p>“….”</p><p>“Bloody hell, that was brilliant.”</p><p>“Of course it was. <i>I</i> was involved.” </p><p>“Oh my God, look at the time.”</p><p>“Goodness. How did it get so late so soon?” </p><p>“We can’t go now! We’re hours late.” </p><p>“What a shame. I guess we’ll have to stay home and fuck instead.” </p><p>“You are such an arse.” </p><p>~</p></div>
