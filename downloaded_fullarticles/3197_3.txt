  <strong>01. It spreads</strong>
</p><p align="center">— D.M.—</p><p> </p><p>A gust of wind passes by a window, slowly touching the glass with utter delicacy. Behind the window there's a room; dark and deserted. <em>Or perhaps not</em>. A breath inhaled so silent, it's almost unnoticeable. It is still early in the morning, yet the warm light of an upcoming sun isn't there. Cool, grey light is filtering through the window instead, shining upon Draco's face and waking him. He slowly opens his eyes to replace the darkness of his dreams with the darkness of reality. A wish to make the sun come out, but the Malfoy Manor remains veiled underneath a dark, velvet blanket.</p><p>Is it possible that the War happened exactly five years ago? What day was it again? Draco doesn't know. All days just seem to follow each other endlessly… <em>meaningless</em>.</p><p>"Lumos," Draco whispers, after grabbing for his wand with his long fingers. The wood feels unfamiliar, just as it has done the past five years. A flicker of light; weak yet bright enough for Draco to see that his arm is still the same. It's itching again, and he knows it'll keep on itching for the remainder of the day. His Dark Mark has become invisible underneath blackened skin, caused by a curse. A curse of an abandoned Death Eater.</p><p>A few months after the war, the curse showed its first sign of spreading — it's first itch. Maybe Draco had even felt it itch right after the Dark Lord had been defeated — Voldemort or Tom Riddle, however one would want to call him. Of course Draco had thought of his arm itching before that time, had thought of it as a gigantic mistake and a regret. But that kind of itching had been something between his ears — something non-physical. <em>This</em> itching, it was different. It was <em>real</em>.</p><p>This first sign of the curse had been revealed to Draco during his trial, <em>conveniently</em>. After being held captive at the Auror's headquarters for around two months, it had finally been time for the youngest Death Eater to defend himself at a trial he had already lost. At least, he thought he had, until a figure entered the room; someone whom couldn't be ignored. There he was, <em>saint Potter,</em> saving Draco once again. Oh, the pity in the boy's green eyes as he'd looked at Draco, sitting there with his hands cuffed, in his wrinkled black suit and with the face of someone who hadn't slept in over ten years. And as Draco'd sat there, listening to Potter defending him, he hadn't dared to lift his head and look into those green eyes displaying all that pity.</p><p>They were supposed the be enemies. They were supposed to hate each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco'd never expected anyone to stand up for him — to defend him in any way. He knew his mother's words were useless, and he didn't even consider his father's for one second. <em>Potter</em>. He should've known he'd come, shouldn't he? Yet Draco had been surprised, especially when hearing all the things Potter had told the Wizengamot about Draco. How he didn't identify Potter at the Manor, for example. <em>It was an act of fear,</em> Draco'd wanted to reply.<em> I wasn't sure.</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>What had Potter tried to reach with defending someone who had been against him his entire life? They had been fighting on opposite sides for as long as they could remember. Yet, the boy'd stood across Draco, declaring words he hadn't been able to process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>While the Wizengamot had had a discussion in whispers about possible punishments and/or a sentence to Azkaban, Draco'd felt a terrible itch on his arm for the first time. It had been more like a stab, really, than an itch. It had been so painful that he had to pull up his sleeve, scratch his skin to just do <em>something</em> about it. It had been then that he had seen it; the black ink of the Dark Mark spreading towards his wrist — the snake's head extending. It'd looked like a dark, rainy cloud had appeared out of nowhere on a sunny day. Or a jar of ink that had fallen over and had destroyed his Charms homework. Mortified by the sight of such developments, Draco had pulled his sleeve back down and bitten his lip in horror. He'd looked around the room in a paranoid fashion, but had been relieved to notice nobody had seen what he'd saw. Until his eyes had fallen upon Potter. Those green eyes, staring right back into his grey ones. <em>He knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>With his hands sweating and his eyes locked in those of Harry's, Draco'd waited for the Wizengamot's verdict. There would be no sentence to Azkaban, they'd concluded, but instead Draco would be magically bound to the Malfoy Manor property for four years. To his mother, the same destiny was called.</p><p>Wizards and Witches had shouted vile words at him as he'd left the Ministry that day, his knees wobbly as he'd tried to shield his mother from several wands that had been poking in their shoulders and backs. The green flames of a fireplace had never seemed so far.</p><p>Perhaps it was only for the best that he couldn't leave the Manor during those years; the hatred towards those who'd fought on the wrong side was still high. People who had changed their opinions and had apologized for their actions were still being haunted with their past; called names on the street. Draco couldn't even imagine what reactions he'd draw out of people if they'd even notice his presence in Diagon Alley.</p><p>His father, Lucius Malfoy, got sent off to Azkaban as soon as the War had ended — even before he could flee from the decaying battlefield of his old school. The pathetic man didn't even a last a week; leaving Draco's mother mourning his death in pure silence for the following years.</p><p>Four years had passed in the blink of an eye, and during those years Draco had spent most of his time in his room — <em>alone</em>. Only during the early morning hours he retreated outside, caught a glimpse of white hair as his mother took care of her roses, taking in the morning dew on their petals. Not many words were exchanged between the two during the day, not even in the morning when they both spent their time in the garden. Sometimes, when his mother felt lonely or grieved Draco's father, she could ramble for hours on end. Draco would nod at her words, but not hear them.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>The curse hadn't stopped spreading further after the trial, but had continued its mission with great urgency. Draco's entire hand had turned a dark shade of black — as dark as a burned piece of coal. He could bet that it sometimes even smelled like burned coal.</p><p>While Draco's still observing his black arm in the light of his previously cast 'lumos', a loud crack resounds through his room followed by the small hunched body of Pibbly, the house elf. She's the only elf his Mother decided to keep after the War; too worried the poor thing would languish away once being abandoned by her owners. Besides; neither Mother nor Draco knew how to cook or take care of a Manor.</p><p>"Pibbly was sent by Mistress Malfoy to bring down master Malfoy for breakfast, master Malfoy, sir," she announced. Her voice always sounds sharp in Draco's ears, and sends a small shiver down his spine every time she opens her mouth.</p><p>With her big blue eyes always pointed at the floor when in the presence of her master, Pibbly has never noticed his arm before. <em>And for the better, </em>Draco thinks.<em> Imagine if she would tell Mother about it.</em> During all those years of the curse spreading further and further, he has never been able to tell Mother about it. He's just afraid to see the look of horror on her face; the dark memories of their past flashing in front of her eyes. <em>No</em>, he can't put her through that again.</p><p>He gives Pibbly a nod and sends her away again. With the greatest effort, Draco manages to get out of bed and dresses in a pair of plain black robes. His mirror shoots him some unwanted comments on how he wears the same boring robes every single day and gives him the advice '<em>to do something about that black hand of his</em>' before he tucks it away in a leather glove he's been wearing for a few months now, to hide the black away. He told his mother it's a kind of trend right now amongst Wizards, and that he's read it in a magazine -- although he hasn't read a magazine in <em>years</em>.</p><p>His mother is already waiting in the breakfast room, hands wrapped around a copy of the Prophet. Draco can't believe she's still reading that crap after all those years of lies and nonsense. These days it's only about what <em>Potter's</em> up to anyway. What type of women he likes, where he buys his tea from, what flavors of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans he has already tried… Not that he would know, he doesn't read the bloody paper anymore, remember?</p><p>"Good morning, mother," he says while sitting down at the opposite end of the table. Pibbly has outdone herself once again, serving way too many dishes for only the two of them.</p><p>"Good morning, Draco darling. Did you sleep well?" She lifts up her grey eyes from the paper and stares at her son with the look of a concerned woman. <em>Aha</em>, that look again.</p><p>"What is it now, mother? Is it because I'm wearing these robes again? Is it my hair? You can cut it again if you want, I don't really care that much about it anymore," he says with a sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She shakes her head. "I'm just… worried about you, Draco. You haven't been outside in five years, you know that?"</p><p>"Actually only 4 years and 3 months, but whatever you say, Mother."</p><p>She sighs and lays down the Prophet next to her tea. She drops a sugar cube in the hot liquid, stirs a few times and lifts up her eyes again. "I want you to come to Diagon Alley with me today, Draco. I think visiting some of those shops will do you good. You can buy whatever you want."</p><p>"I don't <em>want</em> anything,"</p><p>"Well, then don't buy anything. Just come with me, alright?"</p><p>Draco sighs, not willing to give in. Just thinking about all the stared he'd get alone makes him shiver. "Why would you want to go to Diagon Alley anyway? We already own every book worth purchasing from Flourish and Blotts, we don't need new robes from Madam Malkin's because we're not attending any festivities and-"</p><p>"Don't be like that, Draco,' his mother interrupts, sighing once again, "I actually wanted to buy a new owl for you, so you could perhaps exchange letters again with some old friends. I bet they're worried about you… it's been five years.'</p><p>His mother's words are true, Draco has to admit; he hasn't heard a thing from any of his old Hogwarts friends since his trial. It's also not that he has tried to send letters to Blaise, Pancy or anyone else during the past years, has he? And what should he tell them? <em>I'm slowly turning into coal and am extremely lonely, could they please come be his friend again? Thank you. </em>Not to mention the fact that he never really liked owls. Probably because the Eagle owl he had during his time at Hogwarts wasn't very friendly to him; he used to bite his fingers a lot and often return with wrinkled or nearly destroyed letters.</p><p>"I think that's a bad idea, Mother. Besides, I don't believe any of my old friends want anything to do with me anymore. You shouldn't worry so much about me either," Draco says, trying to smile but only managing to get something similar to a grimace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His mother doesn't seem very convinced but relaxes her shoulders a little, as to say that she at least <em>tried</em>. She picks up the Prophet again and Draco peers at the front page, looking at the face of Potter holding up a new addition to the Nimbus brooms family.</p><p>He focuses himself on his breakfast again, an attempt to at least eat <em>something</em>. With knife and fork in hand he's ready to devour a piece of toast when he suddenly feels the itching again; a strong and stabbing feeling running up his left arm. He drops his fork and takes a deep breath, not daring to look up at his mother who hurries over to his side of the table, cautioned by the sound of dropped cutlery.</p><p>"Draco, are you alright?" Her eyes are full of worry as she drops down in a hunched position next to him, laying her hand upon his arm.</p><p>Mortified, Draco pulls his arm away from her and gets up from his seat as fast as he can. His eyes are slowly filling up with tears from the pain. When was the last time his arm hurt this bad? "I'm fine,' he manages to say, 'I think I'm going back to my room. I'm not feeling so well."</p><p>With that said, Draco hurries himself back upstairs, through hallways, around corridors until he reaches his room and slams the door shut with a loud <em>wham</em>. He pulls up the sleeve of his robes and watches how the curse slowly crawls over his inner elbow, spreading like a dark storm.</p><p><em>"Damn this curse!" </em>He mutters to himself, grabbing his arm as to try and make it stop from spreading any further. '<em>Stop it</em>!'</p><p>The pain is indescribable, and he soon finds his eyes watering because of it. Tears are running down his cheeks now, panic slowly making him hyperventilate. This <em>can't</em> be happening. It's not possible that it's spreading upwards now as well. The fear of it taking over his entire body slowly kicks in as he watches it reach mid upper arm, hovering around that area like a cloud full of rain. And then it stop again. The pain drifts away; the cloudy pattern settles as an ink blot, the tears on his cheeks dry.</p><p> </p><p align="center">— H.P. —</p><p> </p><p>A meaningless waste of his life, that's what his work has become. Harry peers over the edge of his cubicle, catching a glimpse of red hair and then the look of a bored man. At least his best friend feels the same way about all this paperwork as he does. He sighs and drops himself back down on his chair, lifting his head up towards the ceiling and looking at the ugly, cool lights of the Auror Department.</p><p>Harry has been working as an Auror for 3 years now, after finishing his 2 years of training together with Ron. A good 6 months after the War, they decided to ask Kingsley if it was possible for them to join Auror training without finishing their Newts. <em>It wasn't a problem</em>, he said, he even was glad that the <em>savior</em> of the Wizarding World and his so called <em>side-kick</em> wanted to join such an important department at the Ministry. Only a week later they were learning about the most complicated curses to protect, defend and capture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>At the beginning it was all very interesting and fascinating; not to mention <em>thrilling</em>. It was all new and something he thought he'd always wanted to be; an Auror. <em>Harry Potter</em>, the Auror. But as the last Death Eaters were captured and most other dark wizards and witches decided to forever hide away in foreign countries, the Auror Department became a boring place to work. Nowadays he only gets called out on a field trip once in 2 weeks and spends most of his time doing paperwork for the Ministry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Not to mention the fact that his best friends had their first child and he's still stuck being the famous, <em>single</em>, wizard who saved the world. <em>The-Boy-Who-Lived-To-Be-Alone;</em> what a joke it all seems. Of course he could've stayed in a relationship with Ginny, but after the war it just didn't feel right. They both had their own big dreams and ideas for the future, and somehow, they didn't match. And secretly, Harry doesn't even know if he even truly loved her. Or at least, not in the right way or in the way he should have.</p><p>So, Harry <em>famous single man</em> Potter hadn't dated anyone in the last 4 years, causing him to feel utterly alone and haunted with front pages of the Prophet and Witch Weekly discussing his non-existent love life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It's weird, that every time he thinks about the word 'love' he either thinks about his own mother or Narcissa, Draco's mother. The love for her son he heard when she asked if he was still alive, it's something that fills his heart with great warmth. He thinks about that almost daily, and with that, <em>of course</em>, comes the face of the blond git. But in his head he's not the Malfoy he knew from during most his time at Hogwarts but a scared boy fleeing from the fiendfyre or his crying reflection in the girl's bathroom mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There hasn't been a sign of Malfoy since his trial, not a word nor a newspaper article. It's almost like he completely disappeared from the world, hiding away somewhere in the Draco constellation. But who knows, maybe he's happier between the stars.</p><p>Harry smirks a little at the thought of Draco <em>sodding</em> Malfoy floating between the stars with a judging look on his face, almost as if it was Harry's fault he got all the way up there. Harry swears he could hear him say '<em>Potter</em>' when Ron's serious face suddenly breaks through his daydream.</p><p>'What are you so happy about?' He asks, eyeing Harry up and down as if he could find the answer somewhere between his Auror robes and his messy hair.</p><p>'Just had a rather funny thought, if you must know,' he answers. 'What are you so serious about?'</p><p>'Well, while you were smirking at your <em>invisible</em> funny thought, Unspeakable Davis passed by to tell me a rather exciting story.'</p><p>'I doubt that Davis would <em>ever</em> have something exciting to say. Either he tells a really daft story or he just says he can't talk about it because he is an <em>Unspeakable</em>,' Harry replies, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms. He never really liked Davis that much. The fellow is full of himself, walking around in expensive robes, chin held up high and not to mention the strong air of some terrible perfume he describes as '<em>too expensive for Aurors of your kind</em>'.</p><p>Ron chuckles a little, holding in a laugh as he probably also thinks about the fellow walking around; thinking he's the Minister himself and all that. 'Anyway, he <em>did</em> have a good story to tell this time. A story worth a field trip, mate!' Ron bolts off his chair with excitement, grabbing his coat and already throwing it over his shoulders.</p><p>Harry also gets up from his chair, trying to figure out just what kind of story that may be. Unspeakables mostly never share a story, unless of course they would need the assistance from an Auror. Well, that would be the case then, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His best friend now hurries over to his side of the cubicle, leaning against his desk. 'So, you do remember how we put away all of the left-over Death Eaters a few years ago, right?' He asks.</p><p>Harry nods. Of course he remembers. 'That's probably the most stupid question you've asked me in 5 years.'</p><p>'Sorry, I just needed a way to start the story… But, did you know that there are not many Death Eaters left in Azkaban right now, as most of them died only a few weeks or months after their capture?'</p><p>'That seems logical; they don't have anyone to obey anymore and they're hated by the whole world. Not to mention the fact that they're encaged in a prison in the middle of a wild sea, surrounded by dark walls and terrible food.'</p><p>'Well, yes… But that's not exactly what I'm aiming at. With not many, I actually mean that there's only one Death-Eater left in the whole prison!'</p><p>Harry thinks about this for a second. How is it that only one Death Eater, out of all they had arrested, has been able to survive for so long? Why couldn't the others stand the macabre circumstances the prison offers? He also tells this to Ron, who just nods and seems eager to continue his story.</p><p>'That's also what Davis said. It's weird, right? That only one is still alive? I know Azkaban is just like what you described, but it isn't surrounded by Dementors anymore so beside from a little hardship, it should be alright to at least stay alive.'</p><p>'So where are you going with this? Is there someone inside Azkaban that murdered all the Death Eaters in secret or something?' Harry starts to lose his nerve. Could Ron please just come to the point? <em>Thank you very much.</em></p><p>'It's not someone…,' Ron's eyes get a bit bigger as he continues 'it's <em>something</em>!' He throws his hands in the air, making a gesture like describing a big balloon, or probably in his mind, some kind of giant cursed cloud. 'Dolohov is that one Death Eater who's still alive,<em> but not so well</em>, in Azkaban. One of his guards recently noticed that there was something wrong with the man's hand; and that's when he asked for an Unspeakable to come and check it out.'</p><p>'Why did he request an Unspeakable and not an Auror? Azkaban is a dangerous place, I'm not sure an Unspeakable could fight against any of it's prisoners without losing a limb.' Harry's also just a little upset that they could've checked it out easily and then have reported it to an Unspeakable, if necessary. It also would've made all this quite unnecessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron shrugs but continues with great eager. 'Davis was that Unspeakable and he immediately saw that the Death Eater was cursed. But it's not a curse that was cast within the walls of Azkaban, no, the curse is spread by the <em>Dark Mark!</em>'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry's heart makes a sudden jump, a stabbing feeling inside his chest. Where did that come from? He doesn't have time to think about it. The only thing he <em>can</em> think about is the only other Death Eater on this planet that's alive besides Antonin Dolohov; <em>Malfoy</em>. He quickly grabs his coat from his chair, throws it over his shoulders and starts heading towards the door with Ron on his heels.</p><p>'Where are you suddenly off to, mate? Are we going to Azkaban to check on Dolohov and his cursed arm?' Ron shouts after him, having a hard time to keep up with Harry's fast pace.</p><p>'No, we're going to Malfoy Manor,' Harry replies, rounding a corner and jumping into the Ministry's rickety elevator.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron follows, confusion read all over his face. He pulls the golden gate closed and stares at Harry for a while before asking <em>why</em>. Harry takes a deep breath and shakes his head. He doesn't know exactly <em>why</em> himself; he just knows that he has to go, has to see if Malfoy is also suffering from the curse. What if he died already years ago and he didn't know about anything? Harry's heart jumps again, leaving him feeling empty and hollow for a few seconds. Then he suddenly remembers, Malfoy looking at his arm with great horror during the trial. It had looked like something was wrong with his Dark Mark, but Harry didn't think anything of it back then.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>'<em>Fuck</em>,' he mutters to himself. He could've known about the curse already 5 years ago!</p><p>They arrive at the atrium and take a sprint towards one of the fireplaces. He pushes Ron besides him in the narrow space and they both grab for some floo powder, pronouncing the words 'Malfoy Manor', loud an clearly.</p>
