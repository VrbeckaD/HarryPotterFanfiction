    <p>Exhaustion dogged her every movement as she ran through the Amazonian forest, desperately trying to evade her pursuers.</p><p>In the last 6 months Nymphaea Scamander had barely slept as she desperately ran from whatever was after her. </p><p>Nym was used to people chasing her. It was a part of her lifestyle that couldn’t really be mitigated or prevented. After all, there were only so many criminal operations you could take down whilst protecting creatures before those very same criminals started to try and deal with you. Permanently.</p><p>The difference this time was that this wasn’t some smuggling ring with a grudge, or a isolated dark Mage or even dark coven. This was an organisation. Whenever she managed to lose or even incapacitate one of the bastards two more would pop up and try to capture her.</p><p> </p><p>She had almost made it past the borders of the forest and the anti-apparation wards they had erected when she was forced to dodge back, and dive or risk being hit by a spell of completely unknown origin.</p><p> </p><p>That’s it.</p><p>Screw playing nice, Nymphaea was done holding back.</p><p>People may believe that she wasn’t on the same level as her big brother, but these bastards would rue the day they thought they could go after a Scamander.</p><p> </p><p>With a controlled twist of her wrist, she transfigured the leaves from a near by tree into poison tipped razor knives. With a sharp and decisive flick she sent them flying in her attacker’s direction.</p><p>If Theseus was here he'd probably be horrified at her for using such underhanded tactics, but she was exhausted and knew that if she continued to hold back and use only honourable measures she would be captured. She had learned quickly during the War what happened to those captured by enemy combatants and she would not risk that fate. Honour and Morality be damned.</p><p>But her blades never reached her target. Blocking them with shocking ease a man materialised from the shadows. He was chuckling softly as the disillusionment spell he had hidden behind faded.</p><p>“Your cheap parlour tricks will not work on me like they did on my followers Miss Scamander.”</p><p>The flush that had coloured her face; thanks to the exertion of running for so long; drained away as she realised who stood before her.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Grindelwald.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>How in Merlins name had her life ended up here!?!</p>
