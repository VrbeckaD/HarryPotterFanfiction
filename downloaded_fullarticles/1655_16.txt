    <p><b>Murtagh</b>: So, eh.....Why did you put us here together?</p>
<p><b>TOA</b>: So that everyone could go mooney over you lot while enjoying the snark. Why don't you start? You are the reason for this idea in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Snape</b>: All right. My so-called Master killed the only girl I've ever loved.</p>
<p><b>Murtagh</b>: My master enslaved me while keeping me away from the girl I love.</p>
<p><b>Maeglin</b>: I was thrown of a cliff because I loved my cousin.</p>
<p><b>Feanor</b>: My father was killed and my creations were stolen.</p>
<p><b>Snape</b>: Oh, woe is me, that is the greatest misfortune indeed.</p>
<p><b>Feanor</b>: Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Murtagh</b>: He was being sarcastic. Anyway, it's clear that we're topping the list on account of the fact that the worst things have indeed happened to us.</p>
<p><b>TOA</b>: Not quite. He tops you all.</p>
