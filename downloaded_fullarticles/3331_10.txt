  <em>BOOM!</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Newt narrowly dodged the incoming jinx, diving to the side and using his momentum to quickly roll back onto his feet and keep running down the narrow corridor of the abandoned warehouse. The entire place had anti-apparition charms in place, meaning Newt would have to devise a new escape plan and <em>fast</em>.</p><p> </p><p>It was his own fault, really. He should have anticipated a higher level of security when he discovered the poachers were holding a live dragon.</p><p> </p><p>Newt registered the high-pitched whistles of another incoming jinx at the last second, and barely managed to duck out of the way. He turned down a smaller adjacent hallway, hoping to lose the wizards chasing him.</p><p> </p><p>Wrong move—it was a dead end. The solid wall of concrete loomed over the magizoologist, seeming to mock him with its immovability.</p><p> </p><p>Good thing Newt was not so easily dissuaded.</p><p> </p><p>His mind ticked through his remaining possibilities: he couldn’t keep running, and he couldn’t apparate away, this left him a single grim option. Newt didn’t wallow on it—worrying meant you suffered twice.</p><p> </p><p>Decision made, the magizoologist bolted into the nearest open door and cast every locking spell he could think of—and hoped it would buy him enough time.</p><p> </p><p>Not a single second had passed between Newt uttering the last charm and when he could hear his chasers firing their own spells at the door—intent on breaking it down.</p><p> </p><p>Newt already knew he would not be able to escape, but there was a chance he could still save his creatures and the newly rescued baby dragon. So, with shaking hands and a heavy heart, Newt gently deposited his case on the ground and took a step back. He didn’t let himself think, just flicked his wrist and muttered the incantation that allowed his beloved case to wink out of existence, easily sliding by the many wards protecting the warehouse, and towards safety.</p><p> </p><p>They were safe. Gone, but safe (so why did it hurt so much?)</p><p> </p><p>The door blew open. Newt didn’t try to fight as his assailants whipped one spell after another to his unprotected back.</p><p> </p><p>He sank into unconsciousness readily, greeting the darkness like an old friend.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The whole world was swaying. Was he on a boat? Newt couldn’t remember. It didn’t feel like any boat Newt had been on previously; the movement steadily going forward, rather than the usual rhythmic back-and-forth of ocean waves.</p><p> </p><p>It was curiosity that pulled Newt from the fuzzy edges of unconsciousness.</p><p> </p><p>The first feeling to bleed back into him was the throbbing pain from each of his upper arms, Newt barely opened his eyes wide enough to see the rough hands gripping him and hauling him along.</p><p> </p><p>Ah. He wasn’t being swayed, but dragged.</p><p> </p><p>The young wizard had enough mind to try and get his legs under him to ease the pressure on his shoulders. He stumbled along as best he could. But not soon after, he was thrust into a lavish office lined by tall bookcases and dominated by a massive mahogany desk.</p><p> </p><p>Newt can’t help but wince as he is roughly pushed to his knees, only realizing as he works to keep his exhausted limbs upright that his hands have been tied excruciatingly tight behind his back. He tries to flex his fingers and finds he can’t feel them at all.</p><p> </p><p>Newt’s thoughts are interrupted by someone entering the office (if the sound of the door opening and closing hadn’t given it away, the immediate hush that enveloped the room did; it was like everyone was collectively holding their breaths.)</p><p> </p><p>Newt keeps his eyes downcast even as the new entrant approaches him and the tips of very black, very shiny oxfords enter his line of sight. Newt ducks his head further down as the stranger continues approaching.</p><p> </p><p>Newt was entertaining the thought of actually scooting backwards in order to create more space between himself and this person that seemed <em>insistent </em>in entering his personal bubble, despite that being <em>so very rude –</em> but then there is a hand gripping his hair and wrenching his head backwards, forcing Newt to look the stranger directly in the face and–</p><p> </p><p>Well it wasn’t a stranger after all.  Newt would recognize those mismatched eyes anywhere. The younger wizard is still processing this new development when Grindelwald starts speaking.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, Mr. Scamander, you’ve certainly been an inconvenience these past few hours.” The man began, a smirk curling his thin lips but not reaching his eyes. “Although, I can’t say I’m entirely surprised, you seem to be making it a habit of meddling in my affairs.”</p><p> </p><p>Newt, who was uncomfortable with eye contact in the best of cases, tries to avoid the older wizard’s gaze despite the man’s firm grip in his hair. Unbothered by Newt’s squirming, Grindelwald keeps speaking.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll make this very simple, Mr. Scamander. Tell me where you sent your case and I will let you be on your way. I am only interested in what you stole from me.” The man states plainly. “Resist, however, and you will suffer the consequences.”</p><p> </p><p>That was hardly surprising</p><p> </p><p>Newt let the silence hang heavy between them; there was no way he would betray the inhabitants of his case.</p><p> </p><p>The silence is answer enough for Grindelwald, as the man is quick to release his grip on Newt’s hair and order his followers from the room. Once the entourage has exited, Grindelwald transfigures a chair into existence and sets it in front of the massive desk. With a simple flick of his wrist, the older wizard transports Newt from his position on the floor and into the proffered chair.  Next, he spells the ropes binding Newt’s wrists together to undo themselves, and made to secure Newt’s arms to the arms of the chair and his ankles to the legs, effectively restraining him again.</p><p> </p><p>Newt can’t help pulling at his new bonds, and finds them unyielding. He feels more vulnerable now than he did kneeling on the floor. Or perhaps it has less to do with his position and more to do with the way Grindelwald rakes his eyes along Newt’s bound form. Slow. Calculating.</p><p> </p><p>Newt swallows past the dryness in his throat, forcing his eyes forward. He expects Grindelwald to take a seat on the massive high-backed chair behind the desk, but instead, the older man rests on the edge of the desk in front of Newt, purposefully brushing their legs against one and other and leaning forward to crowd Newt against the back of his chair; ensuring Newt can look nowhere but him.</p><p> </p><p>“You really must find a better past-time than inserting yourself into my business, Mr. Scamander. I might grow tired of these antics.” Grindelwald speaks the worlds slowly, letting them rumble from the depths of his chest, and allowing the lilt of his accent to caress each word.</p><p> </p><p>Newt licks his lips before attempting to speak, “I can assure you, Mr. Grindelwald, it is not on purpose.”</p><p> </p><p>This gets a deep chuckle from the older wizard. “A coincidence, then? Unfortunately for you, Mr. Scamander, I don’t believe in such trivialities.”</p><p> </p><p>Quick as a snake, Grindelwald has wound a hand into Newt’s hair again, tilting the younger wizard’s head to expose his throat and force his eyes to meet the older man’s mismatched ones.</p><p> </p><p>“In New York, I could have believed that our paths crossed accidentally. But twice? In just as many months? No, Mr. Scamander, this is no mere coincidence.” Grindelwald brings their faces impossibly closer together, relishing Newt’s increasing panic; his staccato breathes, dilated pupils, twitching limbs. The older wizard’s gaze danced across Newt’s features; assessing, calculating—seeking weaknesses to exploit.  Finally, the mismatched eyes settled back onto Newt’s own eyes. Decided.</p><p> </p><p>“There is much I wish to discuss with you, Mr. Scamander. But first, I must insist that you tell me where you hid your case.” Grindelwald voices his demand softly, words spoken inches away from Newt’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>The blood is roaring in Newt’s ears, his survival instincts kicking-in, trying to get his body to fight. He attempts to turn away, back away—anything to add space between him and the older wizard, but Grindelwald does not allow him the courtesy; instead, the man tightens his grip in Newt’s hair, pinning the younger wizard in place.</p><p> </p><p>“The case, Mr. Scamander. Where is it?”</p><p> </p><p>Newt squeezes his eyes shut and holds onto his silence, resolute. He focuses all his energy on keeping his breathing even. <em>I will not betray them. </em></p><p> </p><p>“The consequences of your silence really will be most unpleasant, Mr. Scamander.” Grindelwald whispers against his temple, soft and gentle. “Continued exposure to the Cruciatus Curse is known to drive people mad.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a mockery of comfort, and Newt’s stomach revolts at the forced intimacy. He bites his tongue to keep from whimpering, resolutely holding onto his silence. After a few moments, Grindelwald releases a deep, disappointed sigh, “Very well. I had hoped to avoid this, but you give me no other choice.”</p><p> </p><p>The word is whispered against his skin, no more than a single breathe, but no less destructive because of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Crucio.”</p><p> </p><p>The pain was instantaneous; it felt <em>loud, </em>in comparison to the stillness of the room beforehand. Some part of him reasoned that the loudness was likely also due to his screaming, but Newt wasn’t aware of anything beyond the pain coursing his body like his blood itself had transformed to venom, burning him from the inside out.</p><p> </p><p>There was no respite; it just kept going on, and on, and on. But surely his body must have burned away by now? Surely there couldn’t be anything <em>left </em>of himself. But the pain kept burning through his veins.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually (<em>hours, days, years?)  </em>the pain stopped. Newt collapsed back into the chair, dimly remembering he was bound to it. As Newt collected himself, he becomes aware of the hands still cradling his head, thumbs delicately brushing the tear tracks that ran the length of his face. Felt the blood that runs freely from the chafe marks he had created along his wrists and ankles from his trashing.  The dull pain wasn’t enough to upset his all-consuming relief as Newt fought to even his breathing and erratic heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, it only took a single brush of Grindelwald’s lips against his tear-streaked face to break his newfound calm.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s try this again, shall we? Where have you hidden your case, Mr. Scamander?”</p><p> </p><p>Newt eyes were watering so much that he couldn’t see Grindelwald’s face, inches away from his own, so he screwed his eyes shut. He would not give them up. He would not, <em>he would not</em> –</p><p> </p><p>This time the <em>Crucio </em>was whispered against his cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Newt was better prepared for it, not that it hurt any less. He could register that he was screaming, could feel himself thrash against his bonds, could feel Grindelwald move his hands from their place cradling his cheeks to instead run into his hair and grasp his head, effectively tucking Newt under his chin and against his chest. Holding Newt as he fell apart in his arms.</p><p> </p><p>It was another eternity before Grindelwald showed him mercy.</p><p> </p><p>Newt’s body collapsed after being released from the curse. Falling limply against Grindelwald as his lungs greedily gasps to reclaim the breath they had lost screaming. They sat in silence for some time, Newt catching his breath as Grindelwald kept running his fingers gently through Newt’s hair and cradling his head to the man’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Grindelwald’s hands wandered back towards his face, cradling his jaw, thumbs tracing his lower lip. Newt has enough mind to jerk away from the intimate touch, realizing too late that that could encourage more violence from Grindelwald. But the older wizard couldn’t have been bothered by the reaction, since his thumbs simply trailed back up to Newt’s cheeks instead and gently tilted the younger man’s head so that he could look him in the eyes (much to Newt’s continued discomfort).</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t enjoy this, Mr. Scamander,” began Grindelwald, “Seeing you in pain gives me no pleasure. But your refusal to cooperate leaves me in quite the compromised situation—so, I must insist. Tell me where you sent your case.”</p><p> </p><p>Newt closes his eyes, and tries desperately to keep his wits about him. He would not betray those in his care. He would not give in, he would not. No matter how much pain Grindelwald inflicted.</p><p> </p><p>The older man lets out a deep sigh, disappointed, still absentmindedly running his thumbs across Net’s tear stained cheeks. “It is admirable, your devotion. However, it is misplaced, Newton. May I call you Newton? I think we have passed the time of formalities.” Grindelwald continued without waiting for Newt’s input on the matter. “I mean no harm to the creatures in your care, Newton. I only wish to take back what is mine.”</p><p> </p><p>Newt takes a deep breath before rasping out, <em>“</em>I won’t betray them. Any of them.”</p><p> </p><p>Grindelwald is quick to warp even the simplest of statements, “But who are you betraying? Creatures have no concept of promises… You are only harming yourself. I have already seen the contents of your case, and found nothing of interest.” Grindelwald finishes, absentmindedly. But the hand cradling Newt’s cheek suddenly tightens, and his eyes narrow to slits.</p><p> </p><p>Understanding dawns across the older man’s gaunt features. “Unless… you’ve acquired something new during your recent travels? Something interesting,” the man whispers. It is not phrased as a question.</p><p> </p><p>Grindelwald’s thumbs are caressing Newt’s cheeks again; a rhythmic stroking.  Back and forth, back and forth. “Tell me, what are you hiding in your case, dear Newton?”</p><p> </p><p>Newt just shook his head, helpless to stop the outpouring of please</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m not… I’m not! Please—“</p><p> </p><p>But Grindelwald had no use for the young man’s lies, and simply kissed the words out of Newt’s mouth and replaced them with his own, “Crucio.”</p><p> </p><p>Between the he sobs and screams, Newt shattered under the gentle cruelty. He willingly spirals into a merciful darkness.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Back in London, a very tired Theseus had made his way to his apartment. He settled in his home office, resting his tired bones after another long week at the Ministry.</p><p> </p><p>It takes him several minutes to notice the battered case resting innocently on his desk. Theseus’ blood runs cold at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no… little brother, no…” Theseus quickly grabs the case, settles it on the floor, flips it open and enters the case. He doesn’t make it to the last rung of the ladder before he starts calling out, “Newt? Newt, are you here?”</p><p> </p><p>Theseus makes a quick round of all the larger areas of the case and finds nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Theseus makes his way to the back of the case, where he knows is a little shack with an extra bed. Sometimes, Newt would take a quick nap there (it depended on how messy is own room was at that moment).</p><p> </p><p>Theseus opens the rickety door, and to his surprise, finds a body curled up in the small bed.</p><p> </p><p>Relief floods him as he steps into the little shack, closing the door behind himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Merlin’s beard, Newt! You had me so worried…” As Theseus approached the bed, he noticed a few things: first, the body on the bed had much broader shoulders than Newt, and yet their limbs appeared thinner. Also, their hair was black and cut atrociously short, instead of shaggy and ginger coloured.</p><p> </p><p>In an instant, Theseus had his wand in hand and pointing it at the stranger “Who are you and what are you doing here?” The Auror asks coldly, his ingrained training taking over.</p><p> </p><p>However, the body in the bed stays unresponsive (not surprising, since all of Theseus’ previous yelling hadn’t woken the boy either). The awkward silence that followed Theseus’ unanswered question gives the Auror the time to observe the curled-up figure on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>It was a boy, but younger than Newt and clearly underfed going by the scrawniness of his limbs and the sharpness of his cheekbones. He had likely been abused as well, if Newt was offering him refuge, which is the most likely scenario.</p><p> </p><p>Feeling sound in his analysis of the situation, Theseus re-sheaths his wand, and makes his way to the small kitchen situated at the back of the cabin to starts a pot of tea.</p><p> </p><p>Some hours later, the boy comes to. It’s a slow thing; his long lashes flutter innocently a few times, before opening wide and finally landing on Theseus, who is lounging in one of the kitchen chairs, his cup of tea long finished.</p><p> </p><p>The boy bolts upright in the bed, at first frightened, and then angry. His brown eyes narrowing to slits as he notices that absence of a certain ginger Magizoologist. <em>Clever kid.</em></p><p> </p><p>The boy rolls his shoulders back, and rises to his knees on the bed, trying to make himself bigger, and growls out, “Where is Mr. Scamander? What have you done to him?”</p><p> </p><p>The Auror avoids the questions, instead commenting “You still call him Scamander? You must not have been travelling with him for long, then. Newt always insists on being called by his first name.”</p><p> </p><p>The boy is not impressed at the deflection. Theseus is about to offer the kid some tea, but his figure has begun to blur, dark smoke growing out of his back and creeping up the walls in massive winding tendrils. His eyes flash white.</p><p> </p><p>Theseus’ eyes widen in sudden realization. Because <em>of course Newt would have rescued a damn Obscurus.</em></p>
