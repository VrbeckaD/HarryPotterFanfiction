  <strong>November 2, 1997</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come, goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.”</p>
<p>It was the first most useful piece of advice that his first friend ever offered, and Harry James Potter had no idea how true it was until that fateful day that he found himself standing across from a rather pissed off yay-high Goblin with razor sharp teeth, and narrow yellow eyes. It’s long crooked nose reminded him of the way Professor Snape would look at him when he couldn’t answer a rudimentary Potions problem.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even six months after the war, and despite the world having decided that he was their most esteemed pet of the year, Harry had been dealing with his own issues occurring lately. Ones, he’d rather not confide in his friends about, and so when he was sent an official letter with the Gringotts’ insignia emblazoned on the front you could bet that Harry was not looking forward to more drama in his already packed life. It’s contents did nothing to relieve him from the memories of how they not only robbed the place, but the fact that Harry had cast an Imperius Curse on one of the tellers.</p>
<p>And so, Harry was prepared to make restitution, and had expected to pay out over half the contents of his trust fund when the Goblin said something that took him by surprise.</p>
<p>“We on behalf of the Goblin Nation thank you for your contribution in a war that no one was prospering from.”</p>
<p>“...” Harry’s face must have shown his surprise because the Goblin ground his teeth.</p>
<p>“Our economy sustained a massive hit during the war that even us Goblins felt. Accounts were drained of every last knut, and the Muggleborns and Half-Bloods fled Britain in great haste, taking the last of their wealth with them. A war is only effective if someone is benefiting from it, and we weren’t.”<br/>
Of course, the Goblins would try to prosper in a time of war. Most companies did. He’d often heard his uncle laughing haughtily about how a company went out of business or was bought out by Grunnings after they brokered a certain deal.</p>
<p>Harry had no taste in dealings like that, he’d leave it to his budding friendship with a certain blond-haired Slytherin. “Sir? Sorry, I’m just surprised. I thought I was in trouble.”</p>
<p>“If the economy hadn’t seen a sudden turn-around, Mr. Potter you may very well be,” said the Goblin, yellow teeth flashing in the torchlight. “But, we managed to get back our investors and customers all within the first few months of the end. However, that is not why you were brought here.” It was then, the Goblin that Harry had not yet caught the name of slid a manila folder toward him.</p>
<p>On the front in large perfect gold block letters:</p>
<p>Last Will and Testament of Tom Marvolo Riddle Jr.</p>
<p>Gobsmacked, Harry’s legs nearly buckled as he leaned forward, hands lay flat on the cherry surface of the desk as he stared down at it. “Sir? You’re kidding?”</p>
<p>“I am not.”</p>
<p>“... I don’t understand. H-he never imagined himself dying… why would he-? And me…” Harry could hardly string the words together to properly convey his thoughts out loud, and he pulled away in shock. “W-when did this-?”</p>
<p>“About two years ago.”</p>
<p>“Two years?” Harry breathed. “You mean, he had this drawn up not long after he returned?” If this were true that would mean everything he knew about Lord Voldemort wasn’t exactly the truth. Of course, he never heard anything right from the Megalomaniac’s mouth, but surely Professor Dumbledore wasn’t wrong? “Why would he do that if he was so sure he would succeed and win the war? He would be Britain’s ruler…”</p>
<p>“I can’t begin to delve into the minds of any wizard, especially one such as this one. I have not looked at it. In fact, no one can, not even our brand of magic will allow us to even glimpse it if we tried. It is tied by blood, and only you, Mr. Potter have the legal and magical right to open it. I suggest if you want your questions answered to read for yourself.”</p>
<p>Harry slowly sat in the offered chair in front of the desk, and leaned forward. He pushed his glasses up his nose nervously.</p>
<p>“It seems that the former Dark Lord held a lot of property and assets. The Lestranges, Selwyn, and many other families that were loyal to the Dark Lord gave him everything, including the vault you breeched,” said the Goblin. “It is another reason as to why you are not asked to make restitution for your actions.”</p>
<p>“...” It was a long list, some of them were families that had long since died out. It wasn’t much in the way of gold or monetary wealth, but the items in those vaults. Some were books and ancient scrolls that Harry only heard of through people like Dumbledore and Hermione.</p>
<p>Finally, he reached the last of the file where there was a folded sheet of parchment tucked inside with his name on it. He sat the folder down and unfolded the letter it to see that it was blank. “Uhm…” He laid it flat. “There’s nothing here…?”</p>
<p>The Goblin leaned over to look. “Hm, intriguing. Perhaps, he didn’t get around to writing it?”</p>
<p>“Then why was it folded with my name on it?” Harry sat back thoughtfully, and then his eyes widened when he recalled the diary, and how it worked. “Sir, can I get some quill and ink?”</p>
<p>“You think it is a hidden message?”</p>
<p>“It would be a Voldemort thing to do,” said Harry unscrewing the cap, and dipping the feathered quill, and paused at the top in thought.</p>
<p>My name is Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Just like in Riddle’s Diary, and he waited as the black ink sank into the parchment like water through a drain.</p>
<p>Hello Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>And as those words appeared, a deep green like his eyes, the office in which he sat in disappeared in a familiar swirl.</p>
<p>Harry’s feet touched solid mahogany floors that had seen better days with it’s scratches and loose boarding. He was in a very old manor, the walls had once been white with wooden panels seemed to have turned yellow and were peeling at the seams. The cobwebbed chandelier hung above his head looked as if it had been beautiful once, but time had not been kind considering the black and green tarnish. A fire in the dirty hearth flickered.</p>
<p>“Welcome to my memory, Harry,” said a cool silk voice that crawled like a spider down his spine. Harry turned, and for some reason he expected to see a teenage boy, but instead there he was, in all his grotesque glory. A very tall and formidable Dark Lord with no nose, and bright cat-like red eyes. He looked to be wearing a heavy black robe with a hood attached.</p>
<p>Never let it be said that Voldemort didn’t have a flare for dramatics or theatrics. Behind him were two dark green armchairs with a table that towered with books. Harry was impressed with the detail of such a memory, and instantly became suspicious. “Is this another one of your souls?” he asked dubiously.</p>
<p>“Yes and no,” said Voldemort, and Harry blinked as a slow smirk slid across his lipless pale face.</p>
<p>Despite the grotesque visage in front of him, he raised his gaze to meet those eyes that haunted many nightmares, and was it his imagination or did he see something beyond cruelty? “It is not tangible so much as it is a spirit that I had imprinted. A rather brilliant piece of magic if I do say so myself.”</p>
<p>“Sure you would,” said Harry, unable to help but smirk. Cocky and narcissistic was definitely a Voldemort trait. “So.. you mind explaining why me?”</p>
<p>“That is why I am here. I did not think a letter would suffice, and this way you can ask me any question you deem fit; and because the spirit cannot lie, you will have all the answers you seek so long as there is magic in the parchment.”</p>
<p>“...” Harry thought about what Voldemort had said. “You’re a zombie?” He may not know much about Necromancy thanks to it being illegal, and even speaking about it could cause suspicion. However, Harry did live in a dark house full of illegal tomes and the Black family was, if nothing else, diligent on keeping up with the family library.</p>
<p>“In a spiritual sense. I do not have a body of my own. I lost my right to own a body when I cast it away,” Voldemort said as though he were talking about the weather.</p>
<p>“... I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Of course not, that school is as inept as a squib,” he sneered coldly. “You know nothing. You and your generation are absolutely unprepared for the real world. Just as I was. Sit down Harry and let’s have a chat.” It was bizarre to hear his name being spoken of so easily, and Harry, not knowing what else to do, complied a lot less gracefully than the hulking figure beside him.</p>
<p>“Every spirit leaves behind a magical residue upon their death. I simply imprinted my magic and what soul I had left into this piece of parchment during one of my good days before my death so that it would be stronger.”</p>
<p>It sounded as though he knew he was dying. “Why did you leave a will to me?” asked Harry. Above all else, that was the one question he needed answered.</p>
<p>“Of all people?”</p>
<p>“Many answers to that question, but I do believe that the most prominent is because the moment your blood swam inside of me, I realized exactly what you were, and in this part of the world, Necromancers stick together.”</p>
<p>“... Necromancer? I’m not-”</p>
<p>“But you are,” said Voldemort leaning forward with a smirk. “You, like me, have been gifted with the art of necromancy. It has been a part of us since our birth. It was passed down through the line of the Peverell Family, Ignotus and Antioch Peverell to be exact. It is where the Tale of the Three Brothers come from. It is a necromancer’s story.”</p>
<p>“I thought it was a child’s book?”</p>
<p>“Not always. It was once the tome for all necromancers before it was banned and declared illegal, but the author of Beedle and the Bard, who was also a Necromancer, was smart and managed to transform it into a fairytale for children. Allowing the truth to be revealed to the newer generation without fear of retribution.”</p>
<p>“...” Harry was admittedly completely lost. “I’ve never used necromancy-?” But then he paused when he thought about the few things that had been happening lately. The ones that he had been dealing with before he got his letter from Gringotts, and how he had taken to the Black library in hopes of finding some answers. It wasn’t anything life changing, but there had been instances of odd things that were not the normal magic Harry had been learning that happened.</p>
<p>It all went back to when he was a younger. Harry had been devastated over the school’s pet gerbil because he had been the one who would take care of it during lunch and before school. He had been the one who kept interest after the newness of a school pet wore off, and then Dudley and his friends had gotten a hold of it, and Harry had taken it’s death hard. But, then a few days later the animal had returned. It was wet and soggy as though it had been flushed down a toilet.</p>
<p>Harry would never forget the way the class had screamed bloody murder or the teacher’s reaction when they came in to find it was sitting on Harry’s desk as though it had always been there.</p>
<p>That had been the first time his relatives had referred to him as a freak. Somehow, even though Dudley had been the one to kill it, he had been accused of doing freaky things.</p>
<p>Harry at the time never understood it, and had put it in the back of his mind. It was only now that it was happening more and more that caused him to remember that time.</p>
<p>“But, from what little I’ve read with necromancy being an inherited trait, it has to be used. Its powers demand to be used.”</p>
<p>“Correct, but it is also apart of your magical blood, and unlike the rare Muggles who have none. So you managed to satisfy it just enough every time you cast spells, and then there was my soul latched onto you.”</p>
<p>“You knew about that?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” said Voldemort with a small scowl.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, sometimes? You either knew about it or you didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Answer me a question, Harry, what do you remember most about me?”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Aside from being a bloodthirsty bastard.”</p>
<p>Harry wanted to laugh at this, honestly. To hear Voldemort call himself a bloodthirsty bastard was hilarious. “You were insane.”</p>
<p>“Correct. Your blood gave me some moments of clarity. Ones in which my intellect could survive, however there were more moments in which I would forget all reason and logic. I was a rotting corpse, and the logical part of me - those rare instances when I was cognizant - knew I was dying. I did not have a teacher to tell me that horcrux are the death of a natural Necromancer, but then even if I had I probably would have killed him anyway.”</p>
<p>“No excuses?”</p>
<p>“None, I do not excuse my actions.”</p>
<p>“You tried to kill me.”</p>
<p>“And I still would if I was walking the earth,” he said simply. “You were in my way to what I wanted, although I do wonder at times if things could have been different. Once upon a time I had goals that did not pertain to crucifying an entire bloodline for something it could not help. My lust for power and the hatred I felt for the world was too strong, and with each horcrux I created I believed I was one step away to immortality. I had no idea I was sinking into madness. It’s like being an alcoholic where you black out, and when you come to you’ve no idea what you’ve done.”</p>
<p>“So, you concocted this during a rare moment of clarity? You knew I was going to…”</p>
<p>“Vanquish me? Yes,” said Voldemort.</p>
<p>Harry frowned at this. “I didn’t. Not really. You did it to yourself. You know if you had left me alone, whether you killed my parents or not, I probably wouldn’t have gotten into the mix of it all.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” said Voldemort tapping his fingers on his chin. “But, you cannot reason with madness.”</p>
<p>“You don’t seem mad now,” observed Harry leaning back to look at him. “You seem normal.”</p>
<p>Voldemort snorted. “Really? Is this what you call normal?” He waved a hand in front of his face.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “What do I know when it comes to being normal?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, normal is relative.”</p>
<p>“Literally,” Harry quipped. He couldn’t help but wonder what it would have been like to meet an adult Tom Riddle with a sound logic and reasoning skills. “I probably would have liked this you…”</p>
<p>And to Harry’s shock, the man threw his head back and laughed. “Yes, I was something of a charmer when I was younger, I must admit.”</p>
<p>“Your humble nature is showing,” he snarked causing the man to laugh some more. “So, in essence I am a Necromancer and that’s why you willed everything to me? You knew it was only a matter of time before you truly died? But… why not the Lestranges? I mean, they were your most ardent of followers.”<br/>
Voldemort said nothing for several long moments, and Harry averted his gaze from the thoughtful expression, and looked into the flickering hearth, shadows were cast across the surfaces of the old wood from the fire. “Where are we anyway?”</p>
<p>“Riddle Manor.”</p>
<p>“... I thought I might have recognized it.”</p>
<p>“Recognized it?”</p>
<p>“In my sleep during my fourth year,” said Harry. “I didn’t really understand it then. Why are you here? It looks horrible.”</p>
<p>“It’s the only place for solace for a Dark Lord like me, and to answer your question I chose you, Harry, because you deserve the truth of what you are. You deserve to embrace what you are so that you do not become like me.”</p>
<p>“...” Harry craned his neck once more to look at the Dark Lord who quite frankly looked beaten down and tired. It was like he had a ghost hanging over him.</p>
<p>“It is also my way of repaying a debt that I owe you. You brought me back to life, no matter how short it was, and while it was forcefully taken you still played a part, and the magic recognized that. You will find in the list of items, Antioch Peverell’s vault is listed. You need to look into necromancy and study up because the one thing you don’t want to happen is for your powers to turn against you like it did me because of a foolish mistake.”</p>
<p>“A horcrux? I would never make one of those.”</p>
<p>“No, you wouldn’t. Only someone with a madness and desperation would go to those lengths,” said Voldemort smirking. “I am talking about accidents. Accidents that could land you in trouble. Your powers having an inherent need to be used constructively otherwise you risk the inevitable happening.”</p>
<p>“Like accidentally raising something that’s dead?”</p>
<p>“Or killing something that’s not. Your powers are more than raising the dead, Harry. As much as I loathe to agree with the Ministry or any part of society, necromancy is dark magic. It is a natural dark magic that has not been fabricated; but no amount of light magic casting will see to it ever changing its color.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to raise the dead. I don’t want to see anyone I know once they’ve been snuffed out. I did it once with that ring, but that’s only because I thought I was dying.”</p>
<p>“And yet here you sit, alive and well. Only a necromancer could survive death the way you did. Why my insane half didn’t put it together is beyond reason.”</p>
<p>“Well, you were insane, and didn’t you say questioning madness was impossible?”</p>
<p>“Hm, you do listen, Harry.”</p>
<p>“I assure you, I listen when I have to or when I want to. But, didn’t I survive because it was your soul that you blasted, and not me?”</p>
<p>“No. You see the killing curse takes the soul… the entire soul shreds and leaves the body completely. It happens so instantaneously, and that is why it is used for horcrux creating. It also prevents a corpse from coming back to life because there is no soul left to call upon. It should have taken your entire soul, including the tiny piece I left in you. But, it didn’t. In the end, I suppose you could say that the night I returned from the cauldron we made a Necromancer’s Pact. I’d probably still be a walking shell had I not tried to kill you.”</p>
<p>“Yet, you still would have?”</p>
<p>“Most likely.”</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “I wish more people were as blunt as you. I think I’d prefer this refreshing quality over the thousands of circles I’ve been sent into before.”</p>
<p>“You and most who have encountered a certain barmy old man,” Voldemort scowled. “I lost my faith in all humanity when he refused to take me from that orphanage. I knew then that no matter what, I always had to look after myself.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes, I wish I had gotten that memo. But, I think it’s way too late now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, the self-sacrificing brat that you are,” Voldemort drawled. “Fortunately or unfortunately that self-sacrifice has allowed you to accomplish something that I could only dream of.”</p>
<p>“And what is that?”</p>
<p>“Living.”</p>
<p>As both of them delved into a solemn silence, Harry took to staring into the fire again, and then, “What happens when I leave this memory or whatever it is?”</p>
<p>“All the magic will fade and so will my spirit. You need to know the truth of your powers so that it doesn’t get out of hand. I suggest you learn and quickly. You have a lot of skeletons in your closet, Harry. A lot of dead wouldn’t mind coming back to see you again, and if your necromancer powers are not used, you may very well see them again.”</p>
<p>“... I’ll try. It’s not like I can owl a nearby tutor without being sent to the Dementors,” and then Harry had the thought. “Are Dementors part of necromancy?”</p>
<p>Voldemort nodded. “Yes, how else do you think I managed to command them?”</p>
<p>“Then why do I react so negatively?”</p>
<p>“Rejection. Inherently, you rejected your powers causing you to also reject the Dementors. They were created as retainers for necromancers as they suck out the soul and house it within their bodies, and so when they fade away or die the soul is released.”</p>
<p>“You know a lot.”</p>
<p>“I am a Dark Lord.”</p>
<p>Harry snickered. “I guess so, but you know you could have been a teacher.”</p>
<p>“That dream sailed away long ago, Harry,” said Voldemort. “But, I thank you for that. It is a high compliment.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what would have changed if you would have been allowed to teach? If you hadn’t been rejected?”</p>
<p>Voldemort shrugged. “It will never be, so there is no point in dwelling on it.”</p>
<p>“Of course there’s a point. If you dwell on it, maybe you can prevent it from happening to someone else. Isn’t that what you’re doing with me?” He expected for a moment that Voldemort might snap at him, but then the man smiled.</p>
<p>“You are much smarter than you’re given credit for, Harry. I suggest you start using your brain to come up with your own decisions. Do not let anyone else make them for you.”</p>
<p>Harry raked his fingers through his wild black hair, and scratched a bit at the scar that never seemed to fade. “Yeah well, I learned years ago that if I come off as stupid I get left alone. The smarter I come off, the more problems I tend to get.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>Harry knew that the conversation and his time with Voldemort was almost over as the magic in the air began to tingle, and the room they were sitting in was getting a bit wavy. “Is there anything you do regret? Aside from the horcruxes, and all the obvious not living or winning the war.”</p>
<p>Voldemort tapped his long slim fingers on the arm of the chair. “I think what I regret most was proving that old man right.” He tightened those same fingers.</p>
<p>“During the rare moments of clarity that I’ve gained, I often regret the fact that I never have and never will experience love. I scorned and hated it, but now… the older I am, and being on the other side. I wonder… if love could have changed things.”</p>
<p>His heart ached hearing Voldemort sound so wistful, and that hint of longing hidden in his cold voice made Harry feel so many things.</p>
<p>“Looks like our time is up. I suggest you get started on the Foundation series. You will find the scrolls on top of a gray filing cabinet within the vault.”</p>
<p>“...” Harry stood, and turned to Voldemort who stood with him. “Merlin, you’re a giant.”</p>
<p>“You’re a shrimp, what of it?” Voldemort smirked.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “Yeah, well, there isn’t much sunlight in a cupboard.”</p>
<p>Voldemort frowned at this. “You are more like me than I would have thought…”</p>
<p>“I’ve always known this,” said Harry. “I recognized it during my second year when I spoke to your younger self in that diary. The hat did want me in Slytherin after all.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“But, you know something-?” Harry continued, he felt he had to say it before the magic vanished. His heart was thudding harder now, and his palms felt sweaty. “I think that if you had been the you of now, I could have fallen in love with you.”</p>
<p>It was comical how he could surprise the spirit of the Dark Lord, the man dropped his chin to his chest to look at him better. “You’re kidding?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Harry. “I never kid about serious things. Can you crouch for a moment?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Just do it!” Harry huffed, and Voldemort lowered his head so that they were almost eye level, and to the spirit’s surprise, Harry kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<p>“...” Voldemort glared at him.</p>
<p>And as the strange magical world around him began to fade, Voldemort brushed his fingers along Harry’s cheek. “Thank you, Harry.”</p>
