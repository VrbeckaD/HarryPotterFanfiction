    <p>Draco woke up early that day. He was exhausted and needed coffee desperately. He hadn't gotten much sleep the night before, due to Pansy keeping him up all night rambling on about literature and how romantic it was that Luna kept writing her poems. While he loved Pansy, she could be a bit of a burden once in a while. As Draco slowly crawled out of bed, he was startled by a peculiar sound. It had come from underneath his bed. It mewled again. Carefully, so as not to scare the creature, he bent down to peer under his bed and investigate. There, hidden underneath Draco's bed, was a tiny, white kitten. His heart melted at the sight. It scared him at first, how much he thought this kitten was adorable. He tried to coax it out of it's hiding space, but it wouldn't budge. <em>Damn</em>, he thought. He looked around desperately to try and find something to lure the creature out of it's enclosure and that's when he saw it. A quill, perfect. He swiftly grabbed the quill and started waving it around and finally the cat clambered gracefully over to him. Draco quickly grabbed his sheet to wrap around the creature so that it wouldn't get away. For several moments, he stared, mesmerized, at the living, breathing, animal in his arms. It was gorgeous, with snowy white hair and a little black nose. He knew he couldn't just keep calling the cat "it" so he had to come up with a simple name that suited her well. Livia? He'd read somewhere that meant white in some language. Eirwen, maybe? No. Aella? Yes, Aella. It fit her perfectly. Satisfied with his decision, he made up his mind to transfer her to the Room of Requirement for the time being until he figured out what to do with her. He only had the faintest thought that maybe the small cat had come to him for a reason before he rushed to Potions to begin the day.</p>
