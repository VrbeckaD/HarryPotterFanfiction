    <p>Draco Malfoy was not a morning person. And yet, Pansy had somehow roped him into taking an 8 a.m. English Lit course with her this semester. So there he was, bleary eyed and yawning, hugging an extra large black coffee and making faces at Pansy.</p><p>“Oh, calm down, grumpy.” Pansy said with a laugh. “You love English, you’ll forget that it’s early in the morning.”</p><p>“This sucks.” Draco grumbled. “Honestly, it couldn’t get any worse.”</p><p>Boy, was he wrong.</p><p>A few minutes later, as Draco drained the last of his coffee, the door to the class swung open with a bang and a flurry of loud voices. Every person in the class turned towards the noise. When Draco saw who it was, he groaned loudly.</p><p>“Are you serious?” he said.</p><p>Pansy laughed. “I never understood- what’s your problem with Harry Potter anyway? He seems like a nice enough guy.”</p><p>Draco sighed. “They treat him like royalty around here! And for what? Having a pretty face and being able to run and throw a ball into a net? It’s ridiculous!”</p><p>“Okay?” Pansy said, skeptical. “Have you ever even talked to him?”</p><p>“That’s the thing-” Draco insisted. “I don’t need to talk to him to see that.”</p><p>Sure, from all appearances, Harry Potter looked nice enough. But Draco knew the truth. Behind that gorgeous, toned, star lacrosse player exterior, Harry was nothing. He was just a vapid frat boy, a dumb stoner. </p><p>Harry looked like a mess. His hair stuck up in random tufts, he looked like he’d just rolled out of bed. His eyes were bloodshot, no doubt he was high or drunk, or at least still feeling the effects of it from the night before. He was dressed completely inappropriately for the mid-fall weather, in baggy basketball shorts and a tight tank top that left nothing to the imagination. Draco cursed internally. It was infuriating how good he looked. Draco stared at Harry as he laughed obnoxiously loudly with his jock buddies. The look of disdain was apparent on Draco’s face. As Draco studied Harry, Harry placidly looked over the students in the class, stretching his arms above his head.</p><p>“Seriously?” Draco said, turning to Pansy. “Now he’s just showing off.”</p><p>“What? Are you enjoying the view?” Pansy asked.</p><p>“No!” Draco scoffed, embarrassed.</p><p>When Draco turned back around, Harry was looking right at him. When Harry saw Draco looking, he smirked and waved. Draco averted his eyes immediately. Just then, the professor walked into the room and commanded everyone to take their seats.</p><p>Harry scanned the room and then made his way up through the seats. Draco prayed that he and his buddies would just keep moving. He had no such luck. There were tons of open seats in the hall, and Harry could have taken any of them, yet he decided to sit directly behind Draco. Draco cursed his luck. </p><p>As the lecture started, Harry and his friends kept talking loudly. Draco was starting to get annoyed. He turned around swiftly in his seat and gave Harry a piercing look.</p><p>“You know, I get that you guys can just coast through here because of your sports or whatever, but some of actually care about our education.” he said.</p><p>The gangly, freckled redhead sitting next to Harry raised his eyebrows, amused.</p><p>Harry smiled. “What’s your name?” he asked.</p><p>“Why does that matter?” Draco asked.</p><p>“Satisfy me.” Harry said, leaning forward. </p><p>A look of confusion and disgust passed over Draco’s face. "Are you serious? Who says shit like that?"</p><p>“Can’t a guy be curious?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Draco.” he said, exasperated.</p><p>“That’s an interesting name. Pretty unusual.” Harry said.</p><p>“Yeah, what’s your point?”</p><p>Harry ignored him. “Yeah, very interesting name. Comes from Latin. It means dragon, but I’m guessing you already knew that, didn’t you? Here’s what I bet you didn’t know- take away the o, you get drac. And drac also means dragon in Catalan. But it also means devil in Romanian. So, tell me, are you a dragon or a devil?”</p><p>Now, Draco was mad. What was this guy trying to prove? That he knew some languages? </p><p>“Okay, who do you think you are? What exactly-” Draco started, only to be cut off. </p><p>“Excuse me!” the professor said loudly. “You, there, in the middle of my class, with the long blond hair! Am I interrupting your conversation with my teaching? Pardon me.”</p><p>Draco was speechless. “Uh, n-no sir.” he stammered.</p><p>Harry and his gang of lacrosse goonies stifled their laughter unsuccessfully.</p><p>Draco turned to Harry with venom in his eyes. Harry shrugged. </p><p>“You’re a real ass, you know that?” Draco said.</p><p>“Yes, I do.” Harry said with a wide grin.</p><p>This was going to be a long semester.</p>
