  <p><br/>
The Stone, chrysalis to the soul of our star,<br/>
cradle to the King Destined to serve as vessel of its light.<br/>
Gods and men alike awaited the coming of the Chosen as they fought to fend off darkness' blight.<br/>
For he and he alone would possess the power to purge our star of its scourge.<br/>
Once the sacred Ring is replete with power,<br/>
the True King will complete his ascension.<br/>
Only then can he banish the blight upon our star.<br/>
By the power of the light alone is the Chosen King made manifest.<br/>
With the Glaive of Kings, the Stone of Legend, and the Ring of Light in hand,<br/>
the Chosen's power will surpass that of even the gods themselves.<br/>
By that selfsame power, with the True King as its vessel, the darkness shall be purged from our star, and dawn shall return to our world once more.<br/>
</p>

<p>Hello Prince Tom!</p>
<p>My name is Harry James Nox Fleuret! Mom and my Messenger, Albus, told me that it would be a good idea to start a correspondence with you, since I’m supposed to help you when I grow up to be your Oracle! But Mom said that won’t be for a looong time. I’m only ten right now! How old are you? </p>
<p>What do you like to do? I love playing outside in the garden and visiting the townspeople! I don’t get to leave Fenestala Manor much because of the Empire, but when I do, my caretakers let me play with the other kids in the town! It’s so fun! Do you get to play with other kids? What’s it like living in Insomnia? I’ve seen pictures of the city and its so big! There’s so many people! It's nothing like my home here in Tenebrae! Here, there is green everywhere you look. The vines, trees, and flowers are all over Tenebrae. But Insomnia has sooo many buildings! Everything is so close together. Is that nice? I would love to be able to just drive around all over the city! There aren’t enough roads here to drive, which sucks! </p>
<p>Am I supposed to talk to you about Oracle and Royal stuff? I guess we’re both supposed to be kings of our lands some day, but I once heard my Mom say it’ll be different here because the Empire is watching over us. She says they aren’t doing anything to us because she’s the Oracle and it helps them? I didn’t really understand what she meant, and since I wasn’t supposed to be there, I couldn’t really get closer. Anyways, this year Albus says I’m supposed to start my studies to be the next Oracle. I’m super excited but am not looking forward to all the lessons. Booooring! It must be so much worse for you though! You’re going to be king of such a huge kingdom! Must be a lot more work, huh?</p>
<p>This letter is getting so much longer than I thought! I’ve never written this much. My tutor would be so proud, haha! Mom said when I turn 13 I can get a cell phone! Then I’d be able to just text you instead of having to use Umbra. I can’t wait to grow up! Can’t you, Prince Tom?</p>
<p>Your Friend,</p>
<p>Harry</p>

<p>Hello Prince Tom!</p>
<p>Thank you for replying!! I was beginning to worry you wouldn’t. But why do you sound all formal? C’mon this is supposed to be super not formal!! I’ll drop the Prince from your name if you drop the Lord from mine!! It's just sooo weird to be called that! Only our guards and newer staff call me Lord Harry!</p>
<p>You’re twelve?! That’s so cool!! Do you have your own phone? I heard everyone in Insomnia has a cell phone! I’m so jealous! So does that mean you’ve already started learning about being the future king? I’m not jealous about that part. That sort of stuff is the worst! I know we’re both supposed to be kings, but come ooooon! Can’t they wait until I’m older? </p>
<p>Is reading all you really do? What! You don’t play or anything? How?! I can’t stand being stuck inside all day looking at dumb old books! No offence! And don’t say its cause there’s no place to go to play in Insomnia!! I’ve seen the pictures of the parks! Promise me you’ll play outside at least once before you write me again!! </p>
<p>It may seem like a normal city, but Insomnia is so different from anything I’ve seen! It’s so modern and full of people and life!! You’re so lucky, Tom! Not that I don’t love my home and people here, but to be free from the Empire would be… nice. Mom thinks I don’t notice how the Empire’s presence has grown, but I have, I’m not that stupid. </p>
<p>I have to go now.</p>
<p>Your friend,<br/>
Harry</p>

<p>Hey Tom!</p>
<p>Soooooo, Mom told me your birthday is coming up! Why didn’t you tell me?! And don’t say it’s cause I didn’t ask! That such a dumb excuse and you know it! Aren’t you supposed to have some big party? Or wait! Do they throw you some sorta ball?? Those suck soooo much! They’re always so boring and full of other boring people! Mom forces me to stay until I end up begging for her to let me go back to my room.</p>
<p>But cool!! You’re gonna be a teenager! I bet everything is gonna be soooo different now! Is there any sorta special celebration in Insomnia for turning thirteen? All I’ll be getting is extra tutors which sucks!! Please tell me you’ll at least have something way better than that. </p>
<p>Anyways, I’ll be sending you a gift soon! I hope you like it! Umbra will deliver it on your birthday, so look out for him! Write me as soon as you get it!</p>
<p>Your Friend,</p>
<p>Harry</p>

<p>Hi Tom!</p>
<p>Mom just told me you and the King will be visiting in a few days for my birthday celebrations!! Why didn’t you tell me sooner?! Oh my Astrals, I have to make sure I have everything is ready for you! I can’t wait to show you around my home! It’ll be so much fun, I promise!</p>
<p>Also… Albus has told me a lot about what I must know when I become Oracle. There is something you need to know too. A prophecy. I can’t tell you here, in a letter, but when we finally meet, I can tell you about it then.<br/>
I’m so excited, Tom! See you soon!</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>Harry</p>
