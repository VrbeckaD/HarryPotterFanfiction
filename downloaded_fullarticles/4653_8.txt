    <p align="left">            Hermione Granger peered at the black and white campus map she had printed at the library earlier, wishing she had paid for color. Even with the extra cost, it would have been worth the hassle of trying to decipher grey letters labeling the grey boxes representing the various buildings. She squinted at the tiny letters again--if only she could just cast a locator charm and be done with it.</p><p align="left">            If that was the library, which she had just left, then this had to be the humanities building. But the history wing was clearly labeled in the building across the quad and economics ought to have been housed nearer to history than psychology. She irascibly pushed another sweaty curl out of her face and back into her bun where it belonged. After all those grey, damp days in July and August the first day of the new university term had to be sunny and blisteringly hot.</p><p align="left">            “Is this someone’s seat?” a distinctly flustered Hermione asked the mop of sleek dirty blonde hair resting on the other half of the desk.</p><p align="left">            The mop shifted and two lithe pale arms emerged from a chartreuse cable knit something on the chair.</p><p align="left">            “It depends on your definition of possession, I suppose.” lilted the girl’s voice as she stretched her arms, feline, across polished wood. Her head shifted slightly, exposing the barest inclination of a face behind the feathery hair.</p><p align="left">            “Does an object belong to its creator? Its buyer? Its user?”</p><p align="left">            The barest inclination of a familiar face.</p><p align="left">            “Or perhaps it belongs only to itself, and we are merely granted temporary dominion over it.”</p><p align="left">            And the lilting of a familiar, and completely unexpected voice.</p><p align="left">            It couldn’t be—</p><p align="left">            Before Hermione could stop herself she had reached over and brushed the asymmetrical bangs away from where she assumed the girl’s face was.</p><p align="left">            Luna Lovegood grinned with careless radiance.</p><p align="left">            “How funny seeing you here, Hermione.”</p>
