    <p>If there's something in this world you can count on, it's the punctuality and earliness of Hermione Granger. This day was no different. She had arrived at Kings Cross station quarter past ten, walked through the barrier to platform 9 3/4 ten minutes later and was now sitting comfortably in her own compartment on the Hogwarts express. Deeply immersed in her thoughts she didn’t notice how someone slid the door open until she was spoken too. </p>
<p>“Can I sit here?” said a voice she knew all too well. Except she did not instantly recognise it. The voice of Draco Malfoy was always an unpleasant sneer perfectly matched to his mocking face. In a way she had always been a little bit impressed by how he could match his voice and face like that. Then again a Malfoy only ever showed four emotions. Anger, hate, boredom and gloat. It took her by great surprise to see him there, looking like always while also appearing completely different, because when she met his eyes now she was not met by either of these emotions. Exactly what she saw she could not identify, but the lack of hostility completely threw her off guard. Having seen him like this on every other occasion after the war what made that even weirder. Why was she still expecting him to call her mudblood or try and curse her? She knew it had been long since he acted like that, with his trial and the rather long restoration of Hogwarts. She figured a part of her would probably always react badly too his presence. It was not until a few moments later, when the situation had become truly awkward, that she realised she had not answered. </p>
<p>“Err, yeah sure.” It came out hoarsely and she had to clear her throat. “I highly doubt there are no seats available in a compartment with purebloods though.” She added a little sassier. As she said this her brains started to come back to her and she became very confused. Why did Malfoy ask to sit in her compartment when the train was more or less completely empty? Did he have ill intentions? His face looked almost ashamed when he heard her comment, but he didn’t say anything. She unconsciously rubbed her arm where her “mudblood” scar was located. As she touched it she shivered and the flashback came to her. Like always she saw herself lying on the floor in the Malfoy manor, screaming as Bellatrix permanently deformed her. However, being used to this kind of memories by now, she quickly pushed them away, once again returning to her surroundings. </p>
<p>Malfoy’s eyes lingered on her for a few moments before he put his trunk up on the shelf and took a seat. It being completely silent in the compartment Hermione listened to the sound of the platform slowly filling up with students instead. She heard laughter from friends reuniting, cries from mothers not entirely ready to say goodbye to their children, trunks being shoved on board and owls screeching in their cages. She looked at her wristwatch and realised it was only 10.43. Deciding that she was not going to sit there in a quiet compartment doing nothing with Malfoy the entire trip she reached for a book she had packed in a smaller bag. Although right when she picked it up Malfoy once again opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Have I ever apologised?” it was a question, but they both knew the answer.</p>
<p>“Apologised for what?” just as he had done she asked a question without needing the answer. There were a million things she could have thought of that he needed to apologise for, and she had heard him confess to this himself during his trial. Regardless she wasn’t just going to let him get off easy. Not that she suspected anyone else had done so. </p>
<p>“Everything. Calling you those slurs, helping you-know-who, not helping you at the manor... I am truly sorry.” He looked genuinely regretful and his voice faded as he neared the end. She could see the shame in his eyes and sighted. </p>
<p>She had already made peace with his position in the war. After everything she had come to know about him. After seeing the way his father treated him, the way Voldemort threatened him. After listening to his entire trial and hearing the testimony of Harry, she no longer blamed him. Even though she didn’t condemn what he had done, nor would ever forget. Regardless of how much she had thought it was behind her, she had to push back tears hearing him apologise though. Hermione however was not someone to let people see her cry, and this time was no exception.</p>
<p>“It’s okay.” was all she ended up answering and silence once again fell in the compartment. She wasn’t sure it was though. Even though she had left her resentment behind her she did not know what you could or could not be forgiven for. It was a war after all, people, her friends, died in it. She looked up at the face of a boy with all the wrong influences and wondered what she would have done if she had his circumstances. Once again sighing she fell back into her thoughts as the train started moving. This was going to be a long year.</p>
