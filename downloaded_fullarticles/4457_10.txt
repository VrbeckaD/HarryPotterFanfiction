    <p>Jan 3rd, 1998</p>
<p>  It is January 3rd, the Carrows won’t let anyone go home, and I still haven’t found a way to get out of this while bringing my friends with me too. I-I cannot carve anymore anymore runes into the sheer foundations of my commons without finding the Lodestone of Hogwarts and seeking understanding from that. I’ve been switching robes between a Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff to keep well away from the bloody murderous idiots that seem to have taken this this Regime up gleefully.</p>

<p> Professer Snape, he he he doesn’t seem like he cares but he does. He cares for his snakes and so lets me and Maggy, the only other muggleborn in my house, hide away in the other other houses without, y’know, reporting us to mcdeathtoeverything waging war against scarboy and the others. I haven’t gotten sleep, I need it, but I also need to find the Lodestone like yesterday. Please Hogwarts. Throw me a a bone. Delphi is somewhere. I dont I dont know where she is. Whered River go, too? I know, I know that Riley’s fine. I saw her the other day in the library with with Professor Jinn. I wonder what they were talking about-- they seemed tired and grim, but mostly tired. I hope that they get some sleep, it helps. With concentrating on stuff and the like, y'know? Me? Whatever. </p>
<p>I'll update tomorrow.</p>
