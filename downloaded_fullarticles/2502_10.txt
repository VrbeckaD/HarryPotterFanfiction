    <p>Our story begins in the Potter household, two years after Voldemort nearly killed Harry's parents.</p><p>Lily sighed. "Look at him, Prongs. When did he get so big?"</p><p>James said, "I know, it seems like only yesterday he was only talking baby<br/>
language."</p><p>Lily smiled. "Now look at him. He can talk for fun."</p><p>Harry toddled over to them and grinned. "Daddy, mummy."</p><p>James beamed, "That's right, Harry. We're your parents."</p><p>Harry started, "Padents."</p><p>Lily stated, "Close enough."</p><p>James looked first at Lily, then at Harry, and told them both; "This is what life's all about. Family."</p><p>P.S. I will explain more about how they both survived in future chapters!</p>
