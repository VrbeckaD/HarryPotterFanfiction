    <p>He never called it talent or a gift, or any name that gave an idea of something positive. Clairvoyance has always been a burden. If he had been offered the opportunity to one day simply wake up and be free of that ability, he'd have accepted it without a second thought. With his condition proven, some would argue that he shouldn't be in his right mind to give up that natural “advantage”, but what could they know about what it was like to be aware of the future? It's not always good, there are things that nobody wants to be aware of. Especially if you can't tell anyone what you saw.</p><p>Hugo was never the author of any prophecy - like the one made by Sybill Trelawney about his uncle Harry - but he had other ways of expressing clairvoyance, for example, premonitory dreams. These were almost always too confusing to interpret. In addition to dreams, it could also come in quick flashes; scenes that occurred first in his mind and then immediately unfolded in front of him, in less than a minute.</p><p>And apart from these, there was another way that produced slightly more interesting visions: touching. It didn't mean that every time he touched someone he could predict their whole life, or anything like that. It rarely happened. In fact, only twice in that boy's entire life. But both were striking, after all, he wasn't expecting anything like it.</p><p>The first time, Hugo was with his uncle Charlie walking around The Burrow. Although he didn't show up often, Charlie was his favorite uncle, his stories about Romania's dragons were always the most exciting. Hugo couldn't tell now what story uncle Charlie was telling him that day, maybe he was repeating one of the ones Hugo liked best. He just recalled that, at a certain moment, he said something silly that every child says and his uncle laughed, ruffling his hair like the older ones like to do to remember the little ones of their size.</p><p>Suddenly, the boy was gone. It was a brand new place and it was very, very hot. Everywhere he looked, there seemed to be flames of fire being expelled by dragons. Dragons! Really! He could barely contain himself in excitement, even if there was no reasonable explanation for being there.</p><p>That was when he saw Uncle Charlie, being helped by others to transport one of the dragons, a Peruvian Viper-tooth, which was very angry and restless. His excitement was soon turning into a bad feeling, a feeling that something bad was going to happen. And that's exactly what happened. The large reptile pulled the thick chain that held it tightly and hurled everyone who held it to the ground. Uncle Charlie was the first to stand and tried to calm the animal, but it was in vain. The Viper-tooth tipped its head back, as if it were gathering its breath, and a burst of fire came out of its mouth. His uncle jumped to the side to dodge, but he couldn't help but be hit in the left forearm. Hugo was unable to see the burn properly, Charlie was cradling his injured arm with the unharmed one and struggling on the floor in pain.</p><p>So, just like that, Hugo was at The Burrow again. The whole thing had been pretty scary, mainly because he was no more than eight years old. He was trying to understand what he had just seen and also how Uncle Charlie could be well and happy by his side if, for a moment, he was writhing in agony.</p><p>"What is it, Hugo? What's with that face?"</p><p>The boy looked at him, wondering whether to say it or not. He had had his little premonitory flashes by now, but nothing like that strange sight. He wasn't even sure it was real, he didn't know anything about seer abilities at the time. And although Hugo trusted his uncle, he was afraid of the reaction he might have. As far as he knew, it wasn't just any wizard who went around having visions.</p><p>He decided not to speak, but made his uncle swear that he would wear fire resistant gloves when he was dealing with the dragons. Charlie was a little suspicious of the sudden request, still saying that in all those years, despite several scars, he had never been seriously burned.</p><p>"Well, a little precaution can't hurt me."</p><p>A few months later, Uncle Charlie came to thank him, saying that one of the dragons had almost burned him, but thanks to the long protective gloves nothing had happened. Just like he said, 'it was almost as if you knew'.</p><p>The only other time this happened was when Hugo predicted that his cousin Victoire would have a baby, one day, when she went to greet him with a kiss on the cheek. Hugo was thirteen now and he wasn't scared when it happened, he was already used to the fact that he wasn't completely normal. This time, Hugo didn't say anything, because in that vision, she and Teddy Lupin seemed quite happy. At the end of his third year at Hogwarts, the baby was born.</p><p>These two were the most exciting predictions he had ever had. And yet, Hugo would rather not have them. Wasn't it enough to be a Weasley without red hair, did he still need to have some bizarre ability? Not only that, Hugo knew that few would take him seriously if they found out. Why would anyone believe, anyway? It would seem like just an attempt to get attention amidst such a large family, with such important members. <em>But it's true!</em>, you would think. Well, yes, however, even Hugo had to admit that if he were anybody else and he heard that statement coming from Hugo Weasley, he would more quickly consider it a typical need for attention of the youngest in a family than a actual thing. For Merlin's sake, his own mother might have been the first to deny that, considering her well-known opinions on Divination.</p><p>And because of that, his life was exactly the opposite of what it would have been like if he had exposed himself at the first sign of abnormality. His family's shadow had become a comfortable place, a kind of shelter. As long as he was there, nothing could happen to him.</p><p>Obviously, this didn't prevent him from predicting the future, but Hugo almost always ignored what he saw, as if, sooner or later, clairvoyance would give up on him and look for a wizard more interested in it to manifest itself.</p><p>This tactic worked ... for a while.</p>
<hr/><p>When he woke up that summer day and realized that everyone was already downstairs, he got suspect. Hugo was not always the first to get up, but never the last, he had serious tendencies to wake up before eight even when he could sleep more. It didn't take long to hear the sound of something being fried in the pan, accompanied by the unmistakable smell of bacon. Now, everything was much more suspicious. Although bacon was one of his favorites, his mother was openly against eating such fatty foods, especially in the morning. The same disapproval was given to sweets, which he assumed was a consequence of her being raised by muggle dentists. What could be happening?</p><p>He went down the stairs, the smell of the food growing so intense that he had to make an effort not to run toward to the kitchen. He stopped at the door. Upon seeing him, the three people present there stopped what they were doing. His parents smiled at him and his sister Rose seemed to judge him for some reason.</p><p>"You're up, dear!" Hermione turned off the stove, holding the frying pan. "Right in time! Sit down, sit down."</p><p>He did as she asked, the eggs and bacon were put on the plate in front of him. He murmured a “thank you” then picked up a fork and was ready to start eating, when he noticed that all eyes were still on him. Shyly, he asked:</p><p>"Are you all right? Did I do something?"</p><p>His father Ronald cleared his throat, pretending to pay attention to his own breakfast. Then he started talking innocently, waving casually to the center of the table:</p><p>"There's something for you, it seems to be important." Ron failed miserably to pretend not to be interested in whatever the correspondence was.</p><p>Hugo looked more closely at the table and there, leaning on the vase of lilies, sat a letter addressed to him.</p><p>"It's from Hogwarts." His mother couldn't help but walk around the kitchen to get to the chair next to Hugo. "Your letter was late, remember? It arrived earlier today."</p><p>Hugo frowned.</p><p>"But why are you so excited? It's just this year's book list."</p><p>He heard Rose let out an impatient sigh and looked up at her, seeing her closing her book at the end of the table.</p><p>"Can you open it quick? I can't believe they woke me up for that ..."</p><p>"You had your moment, Rose. Now let your brother have his" Hermione said.</p><p>Hugo must have been missing some very important detail, for he had no idea what was going on there.</p><p>That was when he had his first vision of the month.</p><p><em>"I'm sorry, dear,"</em> said his mother, her voice followed by the characteristic echo, with a frustrated expression.</p><p>His father was not much better.</p><p>
  <em>"But we can still go out for an ice cream at Diagon Alley, as your mother and I had planned before."</em>
</p><p>Rose snorted.</p><p>
  <em>"Please, Dad, he's not five. He doesn't need any consolation ice cream."</em>
</p><p>And he was back in the present. Before they could realize he'd been out for a second, he opened the envelope.</p><p>There, just as he said, just the book list. When his parents saw his lack of reaction, they looked suspicious.</p><p>"Here, let me see. Hermione took the letter and looked at it carefully, examining the verse. She checked the envelope, as if looking for something. "What? No appointment for prefect? No badge... It's not possible, the letter was late, it was like that with Victoire in her fifth year, they had a setback and... Oh, such a pity. I'm sorry, dear."</p><p>"But we can still go out for ice cream at Diagon Alley, as your mom and I had planned before," said Ron.</p><p>He knew what was coming next. Rose snorting in three, two... </p><p>"Please, Dad, he's not five. He doesn't need any consolation ice cream."</p><p>Oh, so that was it, he had not been appointed Gryffindor's prefect. For Hugo, there was no surprise there, it'd make a lot more sense to call Perry Finch-Fletchey or Quincy Allen. However, it seemed his parents really had hopes that he would be chosen.</p><p>Of course, what pride it would be to be able to say that they had not just one, but two prefect children at home. Rose had received the Head Girl badge three days earlier and the news had made everyone very excited.</p><p>He smiled, trying to reassure them.</p><p>"But it's fine, right? I won't lock myself in the room and cry, if that's what you fear." Actually, he couldn't be less worried about that. Just to imagine that some “lucky guy” would have to reconcile the responsibilities of prefect and his studies for O.W.L.s, it sounded like a blessing that wouldn't be him.</p><p>"Really?" his mother seemed to have difficult time believing him.</p><p>"That's right, son, there's no shame in being disappointed. But it doesn't matter to us, we are still very proud of you. You know that, don't you?"</p><p>Hugo looked at both of them, a strange sensation taking his stomach. He wasn't upset, but he was beginning to think that maybe he <em>should</em> be. Rose pretended not to care about the whole scene anymore and concentrate on her book, but he noticed the stealthy looks she was giving them.</p><p>"I know" Hugo's voice lacked so much confidence that it sounded weird, he even questioned for a second if it was coming from him.</p><p>Damn, now he was upset.</p><p>He tried to ignore the uncomfortable feeling in him and the looks of pity, and turned to the breakfast plate, although his hunger had subsided considerably. He felt his mother squeeze his shoulder affectionately and his father ruffle his hair in an attempt to loosen up.</p><p>The food was good. He wondered if it'd taste better if the content of that letter had been different.</p>
<hr/><p>"That bad?" Rayna Griffith, his friend and housemate, asked compassionately.</p><p>They walked through Diagon Alley, on the way to Broomstix shop, where she wanted to buy new dragon scale gloves. From what she had told him, she had saved for three months to have the amount needed to buy them, so she was obviously excited to finally get them. Hugo hadn't seen the girl since the end of his fourth year of classes, so accompanying her seemed like a good idea.</p><p>He shrugged, feeling much better now than he had the week before when he received the letter.</p><p>"Well, I didn't know they were expecting this, but on second thought, I should know. I mean, both were prefects, Rose is Head Girl... I guess I was supposed to be too, right?"</p><p>Rayna raised her eyebrows and he knew she disagreed.</p><p>"Well, I don't know, Hugo. I like your parents a lot and I really believe their intentions were good, but maybe without them realizing it, sometimes they put pressure on you.</p><p>Something about that idea didn't sound right to his ears.</p><p>"It's not real 'pressure'. These are harmless expectations, it's totally different."</p><p>"But you felt bad, didn't you? In fact, I dare say you still feel a little bit."</p><p>"It was something of the moment, seriously. Do you think I am one of those guys desperate for approval?"</p><p>"I didn't say anything... Anyway, we better change topics. Hey, isn't that Quincy Allen? Let's ask him if he got the prefect badge."</p><p>Hugo looked in the direction Rayna was referring to and spotted Quincy talking to some older wizards - or maybe just doing a monologue, it wouldn't be the first - with his usual superior attitude. He was not very inclined to go there and possibly hear him brag indefinitely.</p><p>"It doesn't matter, Rayna. Leave it."</p><p>"Well, now I got curious. If you don't want to come, stay here and I'll be right back."</p><p>Rayna was curious, and sometimes even too much for her own good. At least, it wouldn't be Hugo's ears that would be sore.</p><p>The boy took the time to analyze the alley. It was very busy that day, several parents seemed to have left to buy school supplies at the last minute, some children passed by carrying cages of their newly acquired owls, the adults just behind with piles of books and bronze pots. It had been four years since his first year, but it seemed like forever. He had been as excited as the kids who now passed him. That was Hogwarts, after all. However, the beginning of classes was no longer so thrilling. If the ever closer O.W.L.s had anything to do with it? It was quite possible.</p><p>Standing in the middle of the traffic was a bad idea, of course it was, but Hugo ignored the obvious fact for as long as he could.</p><p>Until he was the target of a small accident.</p><p>When he saw the boy running towards him, he had time to dodge him, but not the person who was chasing him.</p><p>"Magnus, that's enough!" the girl said, but he noticed her way too late.</p><p>Hugo fell with his back against the floor, feeling the weight of a body putting pressure on his diaphragm and expelling all air from his lungs.</p><p>That oxygen-free instant was followed by a freezing cold. Suddenly, icy drops of rain fell on his face, even though the sun had warmed his skin a second earlier, not a shadow of a cloud in the sky.</p><p>He tried to stand, his whole body shaking and his joints stiffening. When he did, he recognized the surroundings: Hogwarts. But how...? His train of thought was interrupted by a grunt. His focus shifted to a spot a few feet away and he opened his eyes wide, certain that he was in a very real and disturbing nightmare.</p><p>A girl was lying there on the grass, a growing pool of blood appearing under her head. Her bulging eyes were on Hugo, but they didn't really see him. She opened her lips, as if to say something or take a long breath.</p><p>Whatever her intention, she had no strength to carry it out.</p><p>"NO!"</p><p>Still in shock, Hugo turned to see who was shouting. And so it ended.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, Hugo realized he still couldn't breathe, not really. The girl who had run into him got up without wasting time. </p><p>"Thanks for nothing, idiot."</p><p>Catching air, at least enough to sit up, he narrowed his eyes at her. Short black hair with straight bangs and green eyes full of scorn. He knew who the girl was. If she recognized him as well, she didn't care enough to offer a hand. She walked away, one of her legs limping, after the boy from before.</p><p>It took Hugo a few minutes to compose himself and to comprehend what had happened. He had just had one of his rare visions through touching. The big difference between these views and the others was that they were never about him.</p><p>And this was about Elise Nott. Hugo saw her die.</p>
