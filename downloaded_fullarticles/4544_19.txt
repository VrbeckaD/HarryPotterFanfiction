    <p>Sirius Black woke up to the smell of chocolate and cinnamon. The smell was all around him and his entire body was warm. It reminded him of Christmas - the way that it was always warm indoors and someone was always brewing hot chocolate or apple cinnamon tea. It reminded him of the holidays, but most of all it reminded him of:</p><p>“Remus.” Sirius murmured quietly as he wrapped his arms around those of the other boy.</p><p>Remus Lupin was curled around Sirius’s body. Their legs were tangled and their arms encased each other in a hug. Remus’ thick sweater rubbed against Sirius’ bare back as he stirred, and Sirius turned to face him.</p><p>“Remus.” He repeated, dragging his hand up to place it on Remus’ shoulder.</p><p>Remus’ eyes flutter open, and Sirius smiles. “Wuh?” Remus grunts, fighting to keep his eyes open.</p><p>“You’ve got to go back to your own bed, Rem.” He glanced at the pale sunlight beginning to shine through the curtains of his four-poster bed.</p><p>Remus let out a sound of dislike and shook his head. Sirius smiled again and rubbed his boyfriend’s shoulder.</p><p>“C’mon.” he whispered, “You know what James would say if he caught us.”</p><p>Remus buried his head into the pillow. “Don't care.” he muttered, moving to snuggle closer to Sirius. “Just want you.”</p><p>“Don’t make me hex you, Rem.”</p><p>He stirred again, this time his eyes fully open as he looked at Sirius. “Weren't you the one that begged me to come over here last night?”</p><p>“Well, yeah.” Sirius rolled his eyes and leaned forward to press a quick kiss against Remus’ lips. “But you know James. He wouldn't talk to us if he found out.”</p><p>Both boys had one certain memory embedded into their brain. They were all playing spin the bottle in the common room. A large group of Gryffindors piled in a circle around a spinning bottle of butterbeer. Marlene had spun it and it landed on Peter. They both giggled, as they were friends, but kissed each other softly before pulling away and looking at James. The entire time that the bottle was spinning, he was looking at Lily. Everyone knew that he was hoping that this childish game would give him an excuse to kiss Evans. When it stopped spinning, however, it had landed on Gilderoy Lockhart. James shook his head violently.</p><p>“No way, I’m not kissing him.” James declared as he sat back.</p><p>Evans rolled her eyes. “C’mon, James it's just a game.”</p><p>“I'm not kissing a bloke.” His voice grew stern and he stood up, “You all have fun with your sodomy and such. I'm going to bed.”</p><p>Sirius was snapped back to reality when Remus had leaned in to press his lips against his cheek. “Don't think too much about that.” he whispered against Sirius’ skin.</p><p>Sirius let his eyes flutter close. “It's hard not to.” he whispered, and pulled back to look at Remus. “Please just go, though. I don't want to risk anything.”</p><p>Remus looked at him sympathetically before nodding. He threw the covers off of him and kissed Sirius’ forehead, then turned to the edge of the bed and slipped through the curtains.</p><p>Sirius could see his silhouette move across the room. Tall and lanky, but still poised and all his. He could hear the rustling of blankets as Remus found his way into his own bed. The sound made him upset. They shouldn't have to leave each other in the morning when they spent all night together. The consequences of James finding out about them, however, were much more upsetting.</p><p>Sirius flipped to lay on his back. He laid there for what seemed like an eternity, staring at the ceiling. He wished for nothing more than to walk across the dormitory and crawl into bed beside Remus. He wanted to be able to be held by his boyfriend without there being an outburst. He wanted to be able to hold his boyfriend’s hand in the corridors without people making faces. He wanted to be able to kiss his boyfriend in the open without people calling him a blood traitor. Their secret relationship was eating Sirius alive. He just wanted to be able to show affection during the day.</p><p>But it was the secrets that kept him going. It was running his hand up Remus’ thigh in the back of charms class. It was holding pinkies under the table in herbology. It was knowing each other’s favorite morning drinks. It was hugging each other in the common room when everyone else had gone up to bed. It was Remus pulling him into the Prefects bathroom at three in the morning for alone time. It was cuddling each other to sleep at night. It was being pulled behind a tapestry because one of them couldn't stand not having a quick kiss. It was holding Remus from behind while he brushed his teeth. It was giving Remus a look - the look - when someone mentioned how neither of them had girlfriends. It was their little secrets that allowed him to be okay with staying quiet. Of course Sirius wanted to flaunt his relationship around. He knew that it wasn't a good idea, though. Even in the wizarding world there was sexuality prejudices.</p><p>A faint beeping sound echoed throughout the dorm. Sirius let it continue on for a minute before saying, “Oi, James. Turn that damn alarm off.”</p><p>James stirred in the bed next to him and the beeping stopped. “Not my fault,” he muttered sleepily. “blame Evans.”</p><p>Sirius rose an eyebrow. “How is Red to blame for that?”</p><p>“I charmed my watch to wake up whenever she does” James responds cooley. “It's her fault for waking up so early.”</p><p>“Isn't that a little weird?” Sirius asks, sitting up to pull his curtains back.</p><p>James was sitting up in his bed, reaching towards the bedside table for his glasses. “Not if I happen to be in the common room seconds before she is. It's not weird if we walk together to the Great Hall.”</p><p>James pushed the covers off of him and swung his legs over the side of the bed. Both Peter and Remus (whom Sirius wasn't sure if he had fallen asleep again) had woken up and were now staring at James. Remus was shaking his head slowly.</p><p>“I just don't think that's the best way to charm a girl.” Remus said.</p><p>James stood up, running a hand through his already messy hair. “And how would you know, Rem? When was the last time you charmed a girl?” Remus hung his head, but not before he caught Sirius’ eye. “I’ll see you guys at breakfast. Don't wait too long, though, I’ve got a wicked plan for today.”</p><p>With that, James exited the dormitory. Peter rubbed sleep from his eyes and looked across the room at Sirius. Remus did the same, although the two looks at the boys were giving him were quite different from each other.</p><p>“What do you think he’s got planned?” Peter asked with a tilt of his head.</p><p>Sirius shrugged. “Probably something that involves wooing Red in the middle of Honeydukes.”</p><p>Peter’s eyes lit up at the mention of the sweets shop. “I forgot we were going to Hogsmeade today!” The boy seemingly ripped the covers off of him and knelt down in front of his trunk. He began to change out of his pajamas and into robes. “Do you think they’ve restocked the Cauldron Cakes?”</p><p>“Probably.” Remus responded, and Peter’s eyes lit up once again. “It’s been a couple months since we’ve had a Hogsmeade weekend.”</p><p>“We’ll just have to go to Honeydukes first.” Peter declared and stood up. He looked at Remus, and then to Sirius, who were both still sitting in bed. “Are you two coming down for breakfast?”</p><p>Sirius nodded. “Yeah, you go on ahead though.”</p><p>“James is probably making a fool of himself.” Remus added. “You should go drag him away from Lily.”</p><p>Peter nodded and turned to walk out of the dormitory. “Don’t wait too long or all the food will be cold.” He called out before disappearing.</p><p>Sirius and Remus stared at each other for a couple of seconds in silence. They were alone. It rarely happened, but when it did it was bliss. </p><p>“You gonna get dressed?” Remus asked, and Sirius remembered that he was only wearing boxers.</p><p>He gave the other boy a smirk. “Only if you are.”</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes and threw the covers off of him. He was completely dressed already, but Sirius knew that he slept in day clothes. He didn’t know why, of course, but it didn’t bother him. Remus liked to be covered up. Khakis and sweaters were all he wore. That is, of course, until Sirius managed to take them off.</p><p>Sirius reciprocated the gesture of throwing his blankets off of him and sinking down in front of his trunk. He pulled out jeans and a Weird Sister’s t-shirt. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Remus gingerly taking out clothes from his trunk. Khaki pants and a sweater - just like what he always wore. Sirius quickly pulled on his clothes, but continued to watch Remus stare down into his trunk.</p><p>“You alright?” He asked when he had finished changing.</p><p>Remus looked up at him. “Hm?” He asked, a hint of sadness in his eyes. When he realized what Sirius had asked, he nodded quickly. “Oh, yeah, I’m great.”</p><p>Sirius closed his trunk and got up to stand next to Remus. “You don’t look alright.” He said, and sunk down next to the boy on the floor. “What’s going on?”</p><p>Remus’ thumbs ran across the fabric of the clothes in his hands. “Nothing.” He said softly.</p><p>“Rem,” His voice was a whisper, and Remus looked up at him. “What is it?”</p><p>“Nothing.” He repeated, although the look of sadness returned. </p><p>Sirius placed his hand on top of Remus’. “You don’t have to tell me,” he said in the same whisper. “But you know that you can.”</p><p>Remus hesitated, but nodded. “Yeah.” he said with false belief. “I’m just thinking a lot.”</p><p>“If it’s about the O.W.L’s you really shouldn’t be worrying about those yet.” Sirius gave him a playful smile and looked down at the clothes still in Remus’ hands. “C’mon, Peter and James are waiting.”</p><p>“I can’t.” He muttered soft enough to where Sirius almost couldn’t hear.</p><p>Sirius smiled, trying to brighten his mood. “Come on, Rem. I’ll help you.” He reached to the hem of Remus’ shirt and pulled it up.</p><p>Remus quickly pushed his hands away, but not quick enough. Sirius saw Remus’ stomach in full lighting for the first time. He saw the deep, white scars that littered his skin. He saw the angry red ones that were trying to heal. He saw how thin Remus actually was, and he was much more boney than what Sirius had only felt.</p><p>“Re-”</p><p>“Don’t.” Remus said sternly, looking at Sirius with pleading eyes.</p><p>Sirius reached for his hand, but he pulled away. Sirius looked at him, concerned. “Rem, you know I’m here for you.”</p><p>Remus swallowed, but didn’t nod. “You won’t be soon.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>His eyes dropped down to look at the clothes still clutched so desperately in his hands. “J-just don’t tell anyone.” He looked at Sirius. “Please.”</p><p>Sirius felt his heart sink down into his stomach. He knew at once that someone was hurting Remus, or Remus was hurting himself. He wanted to help his boyfriend. He wanted to do everything he could for him… but if Remus asked him not to tell, he wouldn’t.</p><p>“I wish you could stay tonight.” Sirius said, drawing his hands back into his lap. “There’s a full moon and the Prefect’s bathroom is always lit up during one. It’s really nice, if I’m being honest. But you always leave when there’s a full moon.”</p><p>Remus swallowed hard again, and this time he sat the clothes in his hands back into his trunk. “It’s the only time that I can see my mum.”</p><p>“I know, but,” Sirius shook his head softly. “I know she’s sick, I just want to spend one full moon lit night with you.”</p><p>Remus opened his mouth as if he was about to speak, but closed it instead. He sat there, silent, before Sirius reached out to place a hand on his knee.</p><p>“Can I ask something?”</p><p>Remus looked at him curiously, but nodded.</p><p>“How’d you get all those scars?”</p><p>The look of sadness returned and Remus shook his head. “I don’t wanna say.” he muttered, turning to his trunk. “You’d think I’m a monster.”</p><p>Sirius scooted closer to his boyfriend, wrapping an arm around his waist. “You could never be a monster.” he said, resting his head on Remus’ shoulder. “A monster in bed, maybe, but never a monster.”</p><p>Remus choked back a laugh and pushed Sirius away from him. “Shut up.” he said, a blush creeping up on his cheeks.</p><p>“Okay, well maybe you’re not a monster in bed.” Sirius said, smiling. “I wouldn’t know because all you wanna do is snog.”</p><p>Remus looked at him with a hint of a smile. “Can you go so I can change?”</p><p>Sirius ran his tongue across his teeth, still smiling. “Only if you’ll reconsider doing more than just snogging in the Prefect’s bathroom when you get back from your mum’s.”</p><p>Remus paused, but then rolled his eyes. “Fine. I’ll consider it.” Sirius began to stand up, “But no promises!”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Sirius walked away, but paused before exiting. He turned back around to look at Remus. “I’ll wait in the common room for you.”</p>
