    <p>It was 6pm on a bustling Friday night in Diagon Alley, and Draco Malfoy was fucking tired, fucking hungry, and fucking ready to get home to his boyfriend-- that was, his bed, where he planned to spend the majority of his weekend burritoed in blankets and eating delivery. If there was one thing the Muggles had perfected, it was the art of having good meals appear on their tables without the use of magic or cooking themselves. Fucking geniuses, the lot of them. </p><p>Finally reaching the front of the line at the apothecary, Draco offered a tired smile to the curly-blonde witch on the other side of the counter and pushed his pile of potion ingredients toward her.  "Afternoon, Hilary."</p><p>"Hi, Draco. Free this weekend?"</p><p>"No, actually, swamped," Draco lied, as he did every weekend, and suppressed an eye-roll. For the eighth time in as many weeks, he contemplated getting "I'M GAY" tattooed across his forehead, but it probably still wouldn't do any good. Hilary was nothing if not persistent; she attempted to convince him to come out for drinks every time he came to pick up his weekly ingredients.</p><p>"Oh," she said, looking quite put-out. "Well, if you change your mind--"</p><p>"Yes, yes, I know where to find you." Draco dropped four Galleons into her hands, gave her a strained little smile, and grabbed his bag. "Bye, now." </p><p>Quickly, Draco moved to the apothecary door and swung it open. So focused was he on his escape, he didn't notice the small child in front of him. At least, not until it was tangled in his legs and they tumbled to the ground, it with a squeal, Draco with a yelp, and both of them with a resounding <em>thud</em>.</p><p>"Ow," a small voice whimpered, as Draco groaned and sat up, rubbing his elbow. He looked over, frowning slightly.</p><p>"You okay, kid?" he asked hoarsely, and the kid looked his way, rubbing their head. </p><p>"Yeah," they said, in the same small voice, blue eyes wide and a little teary behind a raging mess of bright red curls. "Sorry, mister."</p><p>"Don't be sorry," Draco said, struggling to his feet-- damn, he thought he had been sore before-- and extending a hand to help the kid to their feet. "Where's your parents?"</p><p>"I dunno." The kid took his hand and clutched it well after they were on their feet. They looked scared. Of course, Draco had to have found a fucking lost child in Diagon Alley. On a fucking Friday afternoon, when the whole place was jam-packed with wizards. Just fucking great.</p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p>"Ruthie." </p><p>"Who are you here with, Ruthie?"</p><p>"M-my dad... And my brother... He's goin' back to Hogwarts and they were getting his books and I got bored... So I went for a walk to find the owls... an' now I'm lost." Ruthie's lower lip trembled, her freckled face pale. Draco sighed. </p><p>"So you last saw them at Flourish and Blotts, then? That's this way. Come on, I'll help you find them."</p><p>"I'm not s'posed to go places with strangers."</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes-- now was not the time for the little girl to be worried about strangers, as she had apparently taken it upon herself to go traipsing down a street full of them.</p><p>"Okay, well if you don't want my help, you can find them yourself then..."</p><p>"No, no!" Ruthie squealed, tightening her grip on Draco's hand enough to make him wince. "I guess you're not a stranger, 'zactly... my daddy'll understand, anyway."</p><p>Like a charm.</p><p>"Okay, miss, let's go." Keeping his grip on her hand, Draco set off down the busy street, sweeping her out of the way of bustling witches and wizards hell-bent on mowing her over. Within moments, it became apparent that her tiny legs would not be able to keep up with his pace; her feet were dragging and she was already panting. Suppressing a sigh, Draco stopped and lifted her into the air, planting her firmly on his shoulders.</p><p>Ruthie squealed again, louder and more shrill than any of the previous times, and Draco cringed. Once she was settled, he reached up and grabbed both her hands to keep her steady.</p><p>"All right. If you see your daddy, tell me, okay?"</p><p>"Okay! You're really tall, mister!" </p><p>Ruthie sounded absolutely gleeful. Draco managed a small grin before carrying on down the street. He hoped he didn't know whoever Ruthie's father was-- with his luck, Ruthie would be one of the Weasley clan. She definitely had the hair for it, anyway. </p><p>"There he is!!" Ruthie wiggled one hand out of Draco's grip and waved it over her head. "Daddy, Daddy! Over here!"</p><p>Draco turned to look, and his blood ran cold. </p><p>Oh, no. Ruthie wasn't a Weasley. No, this was much worse.</p><p>"RUTHIE!!"</p><p>Fucking Harry Potter skidded to a stop in front of him, eyes wide and glasses lopsided on his panicked face. Behind him, panting, was a young boy with blond hair and twice as many freckles as Ruthie, looking just as scared and relieved.</p><p>"Potter," Draco said, numbly, pulling Ruthie off of his shoulders and holding her out. "She was outside the apothecary."</p><p>Potter took his daughter and crushed her to his chest before setting her down and checking her over thoroughly. "Are you all right? Are you hurt?"</p><p>"Nope! This nice man knocked me over, but I'm okay! He helped me find you!"</p><p>Potter put his hands on Ruthie's shoulders and pulled her closer against his legs as he straightened up. He seemed to have just noticed who Draco was-- his eyes widened slightly, and he shifted a bit.</p><p>"Malfoy," he said, with a small cough. "Thank you. I... Thank you."</p><p>"She wanted to see the owls," Draco said, rather lamely, and felt his cheeks color a bit. </p><p>Potter sighed and ran a hand across his face. "Ruthie, I told you we would go see the owls before we left."</p><p>"You were taking too long!"</p><p>"That doesn't mean you can go running off without telling me! God, Ruthie, you scared me to death!" Potter looked up at Draco again, tired and relieved. "Thanks for bringing her back, Malfoy, really."</p><p>"No problem, Potter," Draco said, wondering why the fuck he wasn't making any of the nine or so scathing comments he had in his head, about how the precious Chosen One couldn't keep track of his own kid. Maybe it was because Potter already looked close to tears. Or maybe it was because this was the first time Draco had seen Harry Potter up close and personal in nearly ten years, and Draco was shocked and more than a little annoyed at how goddamn attractive he had become. Of course, Potter had been attractive enough back at school, but now...</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>"Well... um... Christ, where are my manners? Malfoy, these are my kids, Gilbert and Ruthie. Gil, Ruthie, this is Draco Malfoy. We were, um... we knew each other back at Hogwarts."</p><p>Draco almost snorted at Potter's less-than-subtle avoidance of the word"friends," (they had been much more than friends, that last year at Hogwarts, and Potter goddamn knew it) then nodded at the two children. "Hello."</p><p>"Nice to meet you, Mr. Malfoy," Gilbert said politely, while Ruthie just beamed. </p><p>"He's SUPER tall, Daddy!"</p><p>Potter flushed bright red and tightened his grip on Ruthie's shoulders. "I see that, peanut. Can you tell Mr. Malfoy thank you for helping you?"</p><p>"Thanks, Mr. Malfoy!" </p><p>Draco smiled down at the little girl and ruffled her mass of curls gently. "You're welcome, princess. Say hello to the owls for me, okay?"</p><p>Looking back up at Potter, Draco smiled again, softer. "Glad I found her, Potter. See you around."</p><p>Draco turned to go, but Potter caught him lightly but the elbow and held him fast.</p><p>"W-wait!"</p><p>Draco, mind suddenly flooded with memories of the last time Potter had grabbed him like this, almost kept walking. But after a moment, he turned, one eyebrow slightly raised. "Yes, Potter?"</p><p>"Can... I..." Potter was still flushed bright red, but now his eyes were pleading. "Can I buy you a drink, later? As a thank you?"</p><p>Draco considered him for a long while-- just say no just say no just say no-- then tugged his arm gently from Potter's grasp. </p><p>"I'm free tomorrow afternoon," he said, slowly. </p><p>Potter grinned. "Oh, okay! Um, meet you at... the, um..."</p><p>"The Silver Goose," Draco said, still just as slowly. "Five o'clock. Don't be late."</p><p>"Right!" Potter grinned wider. "See you then! Let's go, kids."</p><p>He led them back down the street. Ruthie turned and waved wildly, a toothy grin splitting her freckled face. "Bye, Mr Malfoy!!"</p><p>Draco waved a bit then watched them disappear into another shop before he turned and headed away as well.</p><p>Jesus fucking Christ, what the everlasting fuck had he gotten himself into?</p>
