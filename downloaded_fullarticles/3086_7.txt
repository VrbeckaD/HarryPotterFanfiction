    <p>It says something, they think, that the first mortal being to summon Death since the spread of Christianity does so unknowingly. Lily Evans is desperate, and dying, and most of all, extremely clever. The call she sends out into the void is probably meant for a more benevolent god, but really, very few of those exist anymore.</p>
<p>So Death steps out of the shadow of a dying woman’s breath and crouches down to see her face. Glassy eyes meet theirs, but there's enough intelligence there that they can tell, without a doubt, that this will be interesting.</p>
<p>“My life for his,” the woman says, struggling to breathe, but with every pained exhale they can feel the timer slowing down. Magic is keeping her stable, repairing the damage that only they can see.</p>
<p>The Killing Curse is supposed to be immediate. This time, it's obvious it failed.</p>
<p>Death finally takes a look at where the woman is desperately pointing. The crib in the centre of the room, still and silent, already tells them what they need to know.</p>
<p>“He won't have long. You do not have much to bargain with,” they say, touching a finger to her heaving chest. Already the seed of cancer has been planted there, in the form of a lightning burn.</p>
<p>“Whatever I have, I give to him,” the woman says, unconcerned it seems by the idea of the half life she begs for him.</p>
<p>It is not in Death’s control to give someone life. But they can switch around someone's death easily enough, and it matters very little in the grand scheme of things whether one mortal dies or the other. But it is not something they do often. It tends to have consequences.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>The woman sighs, a long, drawn out affair.</p>
<p>“I love him, of course I do. But if love were enough I would not need your help. They think I don't know, that they are being subtle in their planning, but I figured it out. They think my son can end the war. That it's—fate.”</p>
<p>Death hums.</p>
<p>“Fate has very little to do with the lives of mortals.”</p>
<p>The woman laughs. It’s only slightly unhinged.</p>
<p>“Still, he needs to be alive to make that choice. The Dark Lord is gone for now, but the war is not over...and maybe I am selfish, to put such a terrible weight on the shoulders of a child, but—”</p>
<p>“You are tired. You have been tired for a while,” Death finishes.</p>
<p>“I thought magic would make everything better. That I had finally found a place to belong. I was wrong,” she agrees, eyes roaming the nursery like she will find salvation somewhere in the smoking wood.</p>
<p>“I love him, I do,” she repeats. It has the cadence of something practiced.</p>
<p>Death has met many mortals during their long existence. Sometimes it is not the body that dies first. Life is a slow death, and it hits everyone differently. At least they have the option to stop it.</p>
<p>“Very well,” they say, rising slowly, “but let it be known that whatever consequence comes with such a deal will not be light. A thing that is dead cannot ever breathe life easily, afterwards.”</p>
<p>Lily Evans nods, a wry smile on her lips, and breathes her last breath. Across the room a child starts crying.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Harry Potter is an easy child. Quiet but cheerful, he requires very little looking after. Which is good, because there is not much his guardians would like to do less than look after him.</p>
<p>His cousin gets more attention, more food, more toys, but Harry is content with the hand me downs and leftovers he’s given; able to take even the most broken of gifts and find something of use for it.</p>
<p>He doesn’t cost the Dursleys much, in the end, but they hate him anyways.</p>
<p>That might be because although Harry is an easy child, he is also a rather odd one. Despite their repeated punishments concerning his invisible friends he still talks to thin air, plays games with people who aren't there, and knows things he shouldn’t. And at night he sometimes mumbles gibberish, which the Dursleys solve by locking him in the stairwell closet where no one can hear him.</p>
<p>He also doesn't seem to care about anything. He laughs off his cousin’s bullying, his bad grades, the Dursleys’ attempt to brand him as a delinquent. And he doesn’t let his family’s efforts to stifle him stick.</p>
<p>There’s a very good reason for that.</p>
<p>“Just because you can’t die doesn’t mean you should court it,” Death says with a sigh, sitting on his bedspread. Harry laughs, but it’s choked and smothered by the series of coughs that follow.</p>
<p>“Not much I can do about that, s’not like the Dursleys are going to feed me more anyways,” he says, skinny shoulders shrugging. He’s sick, but it’s the kind of sick that comes more from exhaustion and bad nutrition, not a virus. But like Death keeps reminding him, it won’t kill him.</p>
<p>“Then you must look elsewhere for sustenance.”</p>
<p>Harry sighs and starts picking at his overly large shirt. It feels starchy and uncomfortable under his fingers, but he has a hard time imagining anything else.</p>
<p>“You know how hard it is to buy things as a kid? S’not like I have money anyways, but adults always start asking where my parents are, or if I should be in school, and with Dudley bumbling about in the cafeteria it’s not like I can go there either.”</p>
<p>Death stares at him silently, the stare of something that hasn’t had to blink in a millenia, and taps one long finger on the bedspread. Harry snorts, but smiles at the mannerism.</p>
<p>“Oh sure, I was able to repair the sheets, but I can’t just conjure up food the same way.” He pauses. “Can I?”</p>
<p>Death shrugs.</p>
<p>“Maybe, but you are probably too young for it. No, I was thinking of a more mundane solution. Money isn’t an issue if you have goods to sell, and you are proficient enough at sewing magically you would have quite a bit to sell.”</p>
<p>That’s another thing his family hates, and it’s probably why they don’t mind letting him be sick and out of view of the neighbourhood. Harry is magic, and his magic goes into anything he touches and infects it. Or so his aunt likes saying.</p>
<p>Harry himself thinks it’s more like a symptom instead of a sickness. Something strange happened when he died, and it shows in everything he is. Magic pours out of him like he’s a sieve, and there’s no way for him to control it. Death says it’s because magic is a thing of life, and he no longer quite fits that. So it tries to escape.</p>
<p>Sewing helps. He can coax it into repairing the various holes and rips in his hand me downs, and by using a needle and thread he can at least direct the magic instead of letting it go wherever.</p>
<p>“So what, I should sew a bunch of blankets and...what? Where would I even sell them?”</p>
<p>Death shrugs. It has very little interest in the markets of mortal means, and as far as it is concerned the use of an arbitrary capital is silly and slightly sad.</p>
<p>“At least you would be using enough magic that it wouldn’t spill out onto other things, like insects.”</p>
<p>Harry shudders. He doesn’t want to see any more twitchy, half-dead roaches ever again. Seeing ghosts is one thing, necromancy is so far from ideal he feels his insides roll just thinking about it.</p>
<p>The sound of banging feet on the roof of his cupboard rings out, raining dust into his hair, and he sighs.</p>
<p>“Guess I’ll have to think of something,” he says, stretching his limbs and brushing the dust off. “Thanks, anyways. You don’t have to keep me company like this all the time.”</p>
<p>“It’s no problem,” Death says. “You’re the only half-dead son I have.”</p>
<p>Harry smiles, and then wakes up.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Death isn’t really his mother. Death is Death, and even though Lily Evans is dead that doesn’t change the fact that she’s not Death.</p>
<p>But Death shows up in Harry’s dreams with red hair and green eyes, a female body, lips curved upwards. Death has stars in her shadow and fire in her eyes, but she looks human enough. Sometimes Harry can even forget the glimpses he sees of otherness, the elk horns bleached bone white by time and the smell of wet earth slowly decaying.</p>
<p>Death doesn’t say anything about the times that even Harry has to look away from her face, the way it bends and twists in the light like it’s wax slowly melting. Death doesn’t turn away from him when he cries at the unfairness of his limited time, of his limited life. Death shows him that living is always worth doing, but it’s not the end.</p>
<p>When asked about an afterlife, Death laughs and laughs and laughs.</p>
<p>Religion has nothing on a thing that existed before humans did. Death could try to explain what happens to life when it passes her realm, but there’s no good way to shrink it down into words that humans would understand.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if that means there isn’t a god,” Harry says to Jimmy.</p>
<p>Jimmy is an old man, wrinkled and grey with time. Even in death he looks like a stiff breeze would knock him over. Harry very deliberately doesn’t look at the gaping wound where his left arm should be.</p>
<p>“The question humanity has been asking for centuries,” Jimmy says with a smile that has more missing teeth than good ones. Jimmy died in an explosion, some sort of gas main thing, but he always laughs at the irony that it happened on home soil and not while he was watching his brothers get exploded in Vietnam.</p>
<p>“It seems dumb, I don’t know why Ms. Darlene needs to know it,” he complains, kicking out his feet idly. Ms. Darlene is his History teacher, and they’re going over the rise of Christianity in class right now. She seems particularly fervent about it.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you say that, then?” Isabella asks from behind him, leaning over to see his homework. Isabella is even older than Jimmy, though she doesn’t look it. She always says she died from scarlet fever but that doesn’t explain the hole in her chest. Harry sometimes wonders if she even notices it’s there.</p>
<p>“She won’t like that,” he says in thought, but with a smile slowly forming. It’s not like he’s attached to his grades considering what happens when he does better than Dudley. He’s quite content learning what he wants outside school and doing the bare minimum in class.</p>
<p>“All the better then,” Isabella says, drifting away a little. Jimmy snorts, before he too fades.</p>
<p>Harry has gotten good at realising when the ghost leave because they want to, and when they are making way for something bigger. A chill sweeps them all, bringing about it the smell of rain and disease.</p>
<p>A dark swirl that is more emotion than thought settles on Harry’s side, and he sighs.</p>
<p>“Hello again,” he says. “Are you going to tell me your name today?”</p>
<p>The cloud shivers, but all he can hear from it is the sound of distant bells. Some ghosts are like Isabella and Jimmy, concrete and present. Some are like Harry’s cloud: wispy things with no shape that have forgotten most of their life already.</p>
<p>Sometimes he sees them following a single person, and it’s those people he knows to stay away from. Nothing good attracts the sort of formless emotion that the clouds are.</p>
<p>(He tries not to think about what that says about himself.)</p>
<p>“Well it’s not like I was going to get much done, anyways,” he says with a sigh, standing up and dusting himself off. “What do you got for me?”</p>
<p>Another shiver from the cloud and then a tug pulls him away from his bench. He follows it obediently, hand in his pockets and shoulders slouched. It’s warm out, even with the cloud’s chill, and he’s been able to sneak breakfast this morning, so all in all he’s feeling pretty happy with life right now.</p>
<p>It’s not a far walk before the cloud stops, forcing Harry to slow as well. They’re in a neighbouring park, closer to the richer side of the suburbs. In his drab, large clothing and his messy hair he looks completely out of place next to the shiny metal and pastel plastic. Luckily there’s only one person there, and they aren’t paying any attention to him.</p>
<p>“That’s them, then?” He asks, already moving forward. The rolling cloud shivers again, black strands curling around his hands.</p>
<p>The girl is maybe a few years older than him, but the great gulping breaths she’s taking make her seem much younger. Harry has never really understood the illusion that vulnerability is young, but it doesn’t change the fact that it takes him a second to recognise her as an upperclassman.</p>
<p>“Hey,” he says softly when he gets close, “in and out now, you’re going to hyperventilate like that.”</p>
<p>Both the girl and the cloud shudder.</p>
<p>“Fuck off,” she says with trembling lips, and Harry smiles. He sits down next to her, close enough that he can feel the cloud reach out for her, but far enough that he’s not crowding her.</p>
<p>There’s silence for a bit, interspersed with the girl’s crying, before she finally lifts her head.</p>
<p>“What do you want, then?” she says, wiping furiously at her face.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Harry returns, crossing his legs. The girl glares at him.</p>
<p>“Not to be pestered by some brat while I’m having a breakdown in the park, that’s for sure,” she snorts. She doesn’t leave though. Harry finds very few of the people the cloud finds for him leave.</p>
<p>“My parents are going to disown me as soon as the school gossip gets around to them, my uncle just had a heart attack and now I have no place to run to, and to make things worse I think I’m going to fail math,” she says in a rush, rubbing even harder at her face.</p>
<p>“That’s not all, though,” Harry says with certainty. The girl takes deep gulping breaths, but leans back a little out of her slouch. The blood she’s been hiding glints in the sunlight.</p>
<p>“It’s stupid. I didn’t even mean it,” she says angrily. “I fell though. After all that talk of being stronger and getting back at them, of living. I got so angry I didn’t even see the car. And now they’re going to say I killed myself, that I was troubled.”</p>
<p>Harry nods. He knows a lot about adults labeling him based off of things that aren’t even true.</p>
<p>The girl settles a little after all that, breathing stabilising into something normal. The cloud at his side shivers, something similar to a sigh. She snaps her head up.</p>
<p>“Who the fuck is that?”</p>
<p>The cloud ripples with feeling, expanding for a second before condensing into a single point. It drifts slowly to the girl, hovering over her cupped hands. From somewhere far away a sound not unlike a voice rings out.</p>
<p>Harry stands up, his job done. He leaves the two ghosts to their grief, to their reunion. This is something the living have no part of.</p>
<p>(What is a soul, Death asks, and what is a ghost? What is an obscurus and what is a child? What is a wizard and what is a muggle? They are the same thing, in the end.)</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Harry is almost eleven. Which means almost eleven of his mother’s years have passed.</p>
<p>Death doesn’t have much to say about wizards, besides that his mother was one, so he doesn’t know a whole lot besides the fact that they exist. And that they will eventually come for him.</p>
<p>He’s not sure how much he likes the thought. On one hand, no more Dursley's, on the other hand, what he does know about wizards make him hesitant. He’s not sure he’ll end up being a good one: his magic is so unstable it’s almost laughable.</p>
<p>Harry has never seen any wizarding ghosts. It’s a strange thought to have. He wonders if they just don’t become ghosts when they die, or if there’s just so few that it’s never happened near Privet Drive. He already knows he won’t be a ghost. Won’t even pass on to wherever Death’s realm leads to. Jimmy says it’s because Death is possessive, but Death only says it’s a side effect of his mother’s deal.</p>
<p>That’s ok though, he doesn’t think he’ll mind staying in Death’s realm. It’s a strange place, with glowing fae lights and giant trees casting shadows on the green earth. It’s a place that’s strangely vibrant, for being dead.</p>
<p>And Death itself is not bad company, despite the oddness of mannerism.</p>
<p>“Boy!” his aunt yells, and he looks up from the book he’s reading to see her pursed lips. Petunia’s lips are almost always pursed when looking at him, so he doesn’t pay much attention to it.</p>
<p>“Throw that trash away and do your chores, I don’t have time for your laziness today. Dudley’s birthday is soon, and I need to make sure the house is spotless.”</p>
<p>Harry smiles and very deliberately doesn’t mention that the boy won’t care. Dudley could live in a pig stye as long as it had food and toys.</p>
<p>He tucks the fantasy novel into his oversized pockets and stretches out of the sprawl he has twisted himself into.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he says, laughing a little inside at the way Petunia’s eyes twitch. She’s never appreciated either compliance or rebellion. Nothing is ever good enough for dear Aunt Petunia. It’s a good thing Harry doesn’t care at this point.</p>
<p>Harry’s chores are less than what Petunia would like him to have, but his magic makes using him for certain things a gamble she isn’t willing to take. He ends up mostly relegated to the garden, where there’s less things for him to break and the high walls keep him from nosy eyes.</p>
<p>Harry doesn’t even mind the garden, likes the feeling of dirt on his hands and the smell of growing things. But it’s a pain when it’s hot out and he can’t go back inside, sweat budding against his back and turning his grip slack.</p>
<p>The garden is also more interesting. It’s where he made his first re-animated insect, where he talked to his first snake, where he saw his first ghost.</p>
<p>Mimi is a cat, caramel coloured with white patches, and she twines around his legs while he works, wispy paws daintily walking over daisies and morning glories. He thinks she gets lonely with no one to pet her, so he doesn’t mind the heat if it means running his hands through her soft fur and being able to listen to her rough purr. Unlike a lot of his human ghosts she has no obvious injuries, and he hopes that means it was natural.</p>
<p>When he’s gone there won’t be anyone to keep her company, and that more than anything tears him up a little. Animals don’t understand why you leave them. He won’t be able to say goodbye.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Mimi,” he says with a whisper, “should I take you with me?”</p>
<p>She butts her head against his palm and purrs, tail swishing back and forth. He smiles at her.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s what I thought.”</p>
<p>A few days later Dudley turns eleven, and continues to show his complete disregard for anything that isn’t himself. Petunia and Vernon continue to spoil him far beyond logical parental love.</p>
<p>Harry meets a nice snake who wants to go to Brazil, meets a few more ghosts (none of which want to go to Brazil) and finally finishes the last batch of sewing projects he had planned. He’ll need to wait before he can find anymore fabric to work with, but so far he has a few blankets, some pillow coverings, and a few stuffed animals. The only one he knows for sure will sell is the small cat toy for Miss Figg.</p>
<p>He hasn’t reanimated any insects, but he has somehow taught one of the petunias in the garden to wilt when it sees its namesake.</p>
<p>All in all, he isn’t expecting the letters.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Harry isn’t stupid enough to show his family the letter. Anything sent to him would get shredded pretty quick, and he can tell just based off of the address that this is something magic-related.</p>
<p>He stuffs it into the lining of his pants and wanders back with the rest of the letters and papers, ignoring his cousin’s jeers. He’s able to snag a plate of toast and eggs before being shooed out the door to do his chores. That’s fine, no one ever bothers him when he’s in the garden, and he’s able to take out the letter without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” he hums in thought, absent-mindedly petting Mimi with one hand. The paper is thick, slightly rough, but it’s the words that really pique his interest.</p>
<p>“School, huh?” He rifles through the papers, eyes skipping over the rather sparse introduction until he gets to the equipment list.</p>
<p>“Oh look, they say you can bring a pet. Wanna come to a magic school with me?” he asks Mimi, before his attention gets pulled away again. A ghostly hand is poking out of the hedge, and he quickly gathers the paper together before standing up and peeking over the edge.</p>
<p>The girl from the park is staring curiously at the bushes, inserting an arm and pulling it out again. The cloud is hanging over her shoulders like an affectionate cat.</p>
<p>“Oh it’s you,” she says when she sees him, withdrawing her arm nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” he asks, pulling himself further up.</p>
<p>She shrugs.</p>
<p>“It feels different,” she says, “like, you can feel the pockets of air between the brambles.”</p>
<p>Harry thinks about that, curiosity tugging at his mind again. None of the other ghosts he’s met have ever talked about sensations they’ve got left, but then again most of them have been dead a while. After a while it would probably become background noise for them.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” the girl asks, nodding towards the packet of paper in his hands, and he has to fight the urge to hide it.</p>
<p>“School acceptance letter,” he says instead. “It’s a little weird.”</p>
<p>She stares at him for a second.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you in like, elementary? What kind of school needs an acceptance letter?”</p>
<p>Harry silently hands it over, watching as she fumbles with it for a second before her hands go completely corporeal.</p>
<p>“...seriously?” Her face is scrunched up as if she thinks he’s trying to prank her, but Harry just shrugs. Magic isn’t so weird when you can see ghosts.</p>
<p>“Well,” she says, eyes scanning the page, “I’m both surprised, and disappointed. I mean, if wizards are a thing, you would think they would have better name for things. Mugwump? Sounds lame.”</p>
<p>Harry laughs.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>There’s no way he can reply back to Hogwarts. Surrey doesn’t have owls, and he’s not even sure how he would catch one and convince it to fly to Hogwarts in the first place. And of course there’s nothing as simple as a mailing address on the envelope.</p>
<p>Harry tries wishing really hard for his reply to magically be sent, but that doesn't work either. None of the ghosts he knows have any ideas, although Jimmy does have some good stories of working in the post office.</p>
<p>Harry figures that either wizards are really dumb, not giving him any way to respond, or there's more coming and he'll figure it out later. Maybe both.</p>
<p>Death, on the other hand, has better ideas.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>It's not that Death can't be on the mortal plane. By value of being Death, he is always there. But he finds most mortals and their lives boring, so he mostly doesn't bother. Even dear Harry only gets visits in dreams.</p>
<p>When he does appear in the flesh, he does so in the forms of animals. There's no point in trying to figure out a human form, with its cultural mores and complicated histories, when normally a hawk or a dog will do just as well.</p>
<p>So he settles himself down into the shape of a snowy owl and lets Harry tie his letter to one leg.</p>
<p>He teleports to Scotland, to the village just under the old magic school, and takes to the sky for the rest of the voyage. There are other owls in the winds, but they are smart enough to avoid him. Birds are good at sensing the predators in their midst.</p>
<p>Humans aren’t quite that clever.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Although the months leading up to September first are filled with owls and letters and home visits, McGonagall rarely receives any mail aside from the few returning student’s concerns. There’s an automatic system in place for those who are accepting their spot as first years, and another one for the refusals.</p>
<p>It’s not unheard of that a muggleborn family will send last minute questions, but even then it’s rare enough that she feels her eyebrows rise at the sight of the stiff necked owl sitting on her desk.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful snowy bird, eyes sharp and piercing, and tied to its foot is a scrap of white muggle paper.</p>
<p>
  <em>Dear Hogwarts,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I’m replying about my acceptance letter, but I have a few questions before I can give my reply. As far as I know my family isn’t magical, so there’s no one at home I can ask.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>How much is tuition? I’m guessing it’s not publically funded.</em>
  <br/>
  <em> How and where does one buy the equipment on the list?</em>
  <br/>
  <em> How do you get to the school.</em>
  <br/>
  <em> What sort of curriculum is in place for non-magical studies.</em>
  <br/>
  <em> Are there magical ghosts?</em>
  <br/>
  <em> Can I bring my cat, Mimi, who is a ghost?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Thanks!</em>
  <br/>
  <em> Harry Potter</em>
