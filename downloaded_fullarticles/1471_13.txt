          <div class="userstuff"><p><em> How dangerous, </em> </p>
<p>He thought, his quill stilling in his hand.</p>
<p>
  <em>To finally, have something worth losing. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He glanced to his right,</p>
<p>A freckled boy with a wide smile,</p>
<p>An innocent boy with a smile so bright.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> How scary, </em>
</p>
<p>He mused in silence,</p>
<p><em> To have someone to rely on. </em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He turned to his other side,</p>
<p>A girl with frizzy hair.</p>
<p>A girl with intelligent filled eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> How destructive. </em>
</p>
<p>He reflected while looking at his essay.</p>
<p>
  <em> To have some know your secrets. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He looked over his potions book.</p>
<p>There was a blonde boy in front of him.</p>
<p>One that was outgrowing his chubby look. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> How freeing. </em>
</p>
<p>He deliberated.</p>
<p>
  <em> To be able to feel vulnerable.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Behind him was a hopeful girl.</p>
<p>One with colorful earrings.</p>
<p>One who lived in her own world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> How peaceful. </em>
</p>
<p>He admitted leaning back in his seat.</p>
<p>
  <em> To have someone to help you up. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another girl with shoulder-length hair,</p>
<p>Leaned forward and poked him. </p>
<p>She laughed when he tossed her a swear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> How unreal.</em>
</p>
<p>He speculated.</p>
<p>
  <em> To not be stepped on. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> To not be used. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> To have respect.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> To have someone care when he bruised.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> How utterly amazing, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> To be worth someone’s time. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> How utterly amazing, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> To be worth something. </em>
