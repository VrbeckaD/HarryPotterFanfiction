  <em>
    <span>Diagon Alley. August 1989.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was far too early for students to be crowding Diagon Alley and yet here they were, sweaty and screaming, scrabbling from one store to the other with sticky hands and smearing their disgusting paws across Severus Snape’s robes as he shoved his way down the street. Several squeaked and stumbled back the moment he turned his gaze on them. A few ran all the way back to their parents. Older siblings snatched younger ones from his path and whispered warnings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, his teaching career had come to fruition.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t look him in the eyes,” a child - Merlin, was that what fifteen-year-olds looked like now? so small? so unsure? - “Remember that Hufflepuff first year that went missing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No first years had gone missing in the last decade. Probably. Severus rarely concerned himself with the goings-on of other houses unless he could deduct points, and he could hardly do that to a student no one could find.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” the younger kid said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their sibling hustled them away. “Exactly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus snorted, drawing his robe more tightly around himself despite the autumn warmth, and plunged deeper down Diagon Alley. The shops grew less vital the farther from the Leaky Cauldron. There were no ice cream parlors full of sloppy children or common bookshops stuffed to the brim with out of order books he had read by thirteen. He slipped down Tangent Alley, a sliver of a street that formed a thin half-circle and connected two ends of Diagon Alley. A few dim side streets no longer than a storefront connected the outer edge to Knockturn Alley. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was still slightly too close to his old path and bitter friends, but some things were worth the danger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He rarely journeyed here, or to any public places anymore, and chose instead to order his ingredients books from the same suppliers he had been using for years; however, there had been whispers in the potion’s world that someone with sense had removed the curse preventing reading from an old copy of Pedanius Dioscorides’s sixth and seventh volumes from </span>
  <em>
    <span>De Materia Medica</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Severus had only ever seen them mentioned in indexes and footnotes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harrowing Acquisitions,” he muttered to himself, upper lip pulled back. “Trite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The storefront was only wide enough for a narrow door and window. A manuscript with no cover and worn vellum pages illustrated in writhing red ink rested on a dark purple pillow, two ceramic tea cups of pale green sprouted oleander that bloomed and withered back into the bottoms, and several Sumerian bullae were on display. Severus pushed open the door and sighed when no bell rang. Instead, he straightened slightly at the teeth-shivering sensation of an alarm spell sensing his presence. The cloying scents of ink and old paper filled his nose.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning,” said the girl at the counter, not even glancing up at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Annoyance already aching behind his eyes, Severus said nothing. He swept across the small store in five strides and found no tomes or translations even related to </span>
  <em>
    <span>De Materia Medica. </span>
  </em>
  <span>The small front room contained only a single bookshelf that housed texts from the 1400s to today and covered everything from animagi to capnomancy. He paced back across the room and scanned the store again. A door behind the inattentive girl must have led to a storeroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned the page of her book and marked it with a thin red ribbon. "Are you looking for something specific?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Obviously.” Severus resisted the urge to roll his eyes - an unfortunate habit he had picked up somehow from his students - and stepped up to the counter. He corrected his posture ever so slightly and let himself loom over her. He was well aware of what he looked liked, billowing robes, black eyes, sneer, and all. It was only fair he use the face he had been cursed with to his advantage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl hesitated for a moment, long fingers pulling the ribbon from her book, and carried on reading. Severus took a shallow breath and took one last look around. On the counter near her elbow was a thin flyer in glittering purple ink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If interested in volumes six and seven of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>De Materia Medica</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” it read, “please discuss with C. Harrow directly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus tapped the flyer. “Is this available for translation?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl pointed to the sign on the wall behind her head. It was identical to the one he had read outside.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>Harrowing Acquisitions</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>acquisition ◐ identification ◑ translation</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Obviously,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enough,” he said. Her presence and the very strain of existing had wedged themselves like an icepick behind his eyes. “Where is the proprietor? Harrow?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She finally looked up, though she did not meet his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am Cecilia Harrow, the only Harrow in England and the proprietor of this shop,” she said and laid the ribbon across her page. “If you know of another, you are welcome to ask them for assistance, though I doubt they will be particularly helpful considering the copies are in my possession and not for sale.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus narrowed his eyes at her. She couldn’t have been older than twenty, yet he could not recall having ever taught or attended school with a Harrow. Her name was far more recognizable than her face. Dark brown eyes were set above a small, narrow nose and then hidden behind a large pair of circular golden glasses. Her white skin, like his, was pale, but unlike his had a healthy warm undertone. A braid of rich auburn hair was tossed over her shoulder, a few stray strands framing her oval face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, he could not place her at all. Curious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How much for a translation?” He sneered. “No references required. I am familiar with the terminology and systems of the time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One did not become a potions master without understanding the nuances of foundational texts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ten thousand per volume,” she said and slid from her stool. She couldn’t have been more than five foot four and utterly unassertive looking. “The translation will still require some localisation to make it coherent, and the payment covers my time and expenses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That price would not ruin him considering his salary and the little else he spent it on, but it was indulgent in a way that made his stomach turn. But how often did one get to read such tomes? Perhaps Dumbledore could be persuaded that it was a necessary translation for the school library.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely not,” said Severus, removing his hands from the counter as if he were ready to leave. “I am asking for a translation, not ownership of the books themselves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are, potentially, acquiring the first ever translation for a fundamental medical text from 78 AD.” She closed the book - manners were truly slipping through the fingers of society with each passing year - and met his gaze. “Frankly, I have been providing inquiring minds with time to observe the text and access to translations of specific sections. These texts belong in a museum or St Mungo’s.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Except I am not simply an inquiring mind and you haven’t gifted them to any such places yet for safe keeping,” Severus said, staring down his nose at her with all the fury he typically reserved for know-it-all Ravenclaws who required taking down a peg or two hundred. “I am one of the premier potioneers in England, if not the world, and the current Potions Master of Hogwarts. You are someone with no name recognition in a store that appears to have been set up yesterday. If the volumes are authentic and the translation passable, then I will pay five thousand each.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My name is quite recognizable given I am the only one here, and the store was opened last week,” she said, spinning a thin golden band on her first finger. “The volumes were authenticated. You are welcome to peruse them and attempt translations yourself for one thousand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He arched one brow. “That is hardly worth one sickle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So your translation would be substandard?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He scowled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I attended Beauxbatons and am quite unfamiliar with you,” she said after a beat, “but if you do require proof of my abilities, you are more than welcome to contact the school. Otherwise, I require ten thousand galleons per volume to begin working. Several of the illustrations are quite cursed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that was interesting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Original curses?” he asked, headache waning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unclear as of yet,” said Ms. Harrow. Her eyes narrowed. “Are you interested in observing the curses? They will have to be removed prior to translation and documented for history’s sake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps.” He laid one hand back on the counter. “Why not sell them to a private collector? You may collect your ten thousand and the tomes may collect dust.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hardly think anyone willing to pay that much would fail to provide secure and clean containment,” she said quickly and drew a rather stiff walnut wand from her robes. She paused midway through a spell. “That was not sincere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t even grace that with a response.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She scowled - the first expression to cross her face - and cast a charm he didn’t recognize under her breath. “Do you wish to deal with me or not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He most decidedly did not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to see the curses before they are removed and then I wish to purchase a translation in English,” said Severus. “However, your notes on the translation and the tomes are kept by you for five years. What is the point in purchasing these notes if everyone else can purchase them as well?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ms. Harrow's head titled slightly to the side and her glasses caught the light. “I place the originals and my notes in the store’s vault and in three years I turn it over to the museum for study and display for nine thousand galleons. You may observe the curses and witness me removing them should you be able to stomach the work. I will not be held accountable for any injuries you gain during the course of the curse-breaking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His! His alone for three years to study. Finally he would have something to do that wasn’t grading endless essays or brewing pepper-up potions. Merlin, he could feel his mind rotting last year. This would be a balm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Deal,” he said. “I will have half of the money transferred to the store’s account before the end of the day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wrote to Beauxbatons that evening, if not to prove to himself she was skilled, then to prove to her he didn’t trust her abilities at all. It was only fair for eight thousand.</span>
