  <span>Draco closed his eyes and turned his face up towards the sun, breathing slowly in the mid spring morning. He sat on Harry’s favourite bench for a while, soaking up the light, his walking cane resting next to him on the stone seat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a while he placed his palms on the cold stone and pushed himself up, his old bones creaking in protest as he reached for his cane with a heavy sigh. He didn’t have the patience to dawdle on that bench when Harry wasn’t next to him to remind him how his bones needed to be in the sun every once in a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco made his way slowly on the stone path into the garden to Harry’s flower beds. The lilies were already blooming and they were as beautiful as ever. Harry never said but Draco knew he loved how there was always a vase in the parlour with fresh lilies from the garden. Draco had mastered preservation charms to make sure he wouldn’t have to cut more than necessary.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pulled out a tiny pair of pruning shears and picked the most beautiful blooms, arranging them in the crook of his arm, taking the short walk back to the house carefully balancing the flowers. It was a practiced routine, after so many years Draco wasn’t going to stop just because Harry had a new address.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sun was high over him as he laid the bouquet on the simple grave, resting his hand on the tombstone, dark and sun warmed. He knew that after eighty-five years together he wouldn’t be away from Harry for long, he was 110 after all, and his heart was calling him from the other side. Until then though, he would sit on their bench and take care of his flowers, but without Harry, the sun just didn’t have the same warmth.</span>
