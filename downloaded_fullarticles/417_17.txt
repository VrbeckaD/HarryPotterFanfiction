    <p>The sunset was fading from orange to deep purple as the Hogwarts Express made its way to school. Yoongi propped his head on the cool window, his deep sigh creating a small puff of fog.</p><p>“What’s on your mind?” Namjoon asked peering from up the the book he had been reading. </p><p>“Nothing.” He lied.</p><p>“Look, I’ve been reading and rereading this page for the last 20 minutes. I get distracted by you sighing over there like the world’s on your shoulders and I have to start over.  So just spill it.” Namjoon closed the book and placed it in the empty seat next to him. “I’m all ears.”</p><p>“It’s just something my father said to me before he saw me off this morning.” Yoongi had been replaying the scene over and over in his mind.  He usually enjoys the train ride to school: a day of reading, sleeping, sweet food and catching up with friends. This year he could not do any of that, instead Yoongi wasted the entire trip staring out the window, wishing that he was someone else.</p><p>“What’d he say?” </p><p>“He said it’s time to grow up, don’t disappoint the family.”</p><p align="center">⚘⚘⚘</p><p> </p><p>Yoongi had been waiting on the platform for his father for the past 20 minutes. It was ten fifty and the train would be departing soon.  His father was late for this meeting for the first time in 6 years. Yoongi couldn’t blame him, his father was the newly appointed Executive Vice President of the Council of Magic and therefore was extremely busy. Yoongi tried to tell himself that it didn’t bother him, his father had been busy all summer moving offices and training staff. So Yoongi was becoming adjusted to his father’s gradual absence  from his everyday life.</p><p>“Yoongi!” his name rang out in his ears. He turned to find his father briskly walking towards him from the opposite end of the platform. Yoongi watched as his father made his way to him. The other parents taking notice of him, grazing over him  with brief smiles with mismatched disapproving eyes. Yoongi’s father was dressed in a dark grey suit styled with an emerald tie. A golden Council badge attached to his lapel he looked regal and dignified, gripping a black leather briefcase. He was an amusing contrast to his son who was dressed in ripped jeans and an oversized brown sweater.  </p><p>“Mom couldn’t make it?” Yoongi inquired before his father could finish his approach. </p><p>“She is overseeing the house move today but sends her apologies,” His father smiled down at him. </p><p>“Right. That’s happening today.” Yoongi said as if he had forgotten. He had left Ianburg two days earlier under the excuse of last minute school shopping in Diagon Alley. Yoongi thought it would be easier to leave than say goodbye to his childhood home, he wanted to be mature about all the rapid changes in his life. This was not the time to fall apart.</p><p>“I didn’t get a chance to pack my room and-” Yoongi started feigning disappointment but his father cut him off.</p><p>“It has already taken been care of do not worry. I am sorry we do not have long to speak.” His father shifted uncomfortably on his feet and adjusted his already perfectly set tie. “Yoongi, this school year is very important for you and for me. The Council will be looking for me for answers and for both our sakes I need to give them the right ones.”</p><p>Yoongi knew in an instant what answers his father needed. What studies would he pursue this year? Is he receiving counseling for the right career? Yoongi grew immediately frustrated with this situation. Of course  his father would want to have this <em> discussion </em>on a crowded platform ten minutes before the train departs. Yoongi’s father never passed up an opportunity to remind him that his enrollment in Hogwarts was a means to an end. It was an attempt to repair the public relationship between the Council and Ministry. To remind him that he is the first child of a Council member to enroll at Hogwarts, a Ministry-run institution,  in over 500 years. Yoongi the olive branch. Yoongi who was meant to study to become an ambassador to the Ministry and study magical law, magical history and relations. Yoongi was instead focusing on mastering divination and arithmancy.  </p><p>“The Council is not pleased that you are...off track,” his father’s grip tightened around the handle of the briefcase. “ Remember, the Ministry was also less than satisfied with the results of your OWLs.”</p><p>“ You think I’d forget!” Yoongi blurted a little too loud. “ You made me read that letter the Ministry sent at dinner aloud for the entire family!” Yoongi could feel his face getting hot but he didn’t know if it was due to present anger or past embarrassment. </p><p>Yoongi was seated at the dinner table with his family, it was the Saturday of the week of his return from school. They were enjoying the fifth traditional dinner in celebration of another year completed at Hogwarts. For Yoongi, this dinner was more exciting than his birthday. What made it special was that his mother cooked his favorite meal, his older brother returned from his envious Council job and Yoongi was permitted to sit next to his father. His favorite aunt was also in attendance along with his father’s two elder brothers. His father had just finished reading out his final marks, all perfect of course, and comments from his professors. Next his father announced that he also received a special letter from the Minister of Magic.  He slides the dusty gold envelope towards him to read. The pit in Yoongi stomach that he had when dinner started grows into a chasm when he sees that the ministry's golden seal is already broken.</p><p>“Stand up,” his father says gesturing him to face the other family members, Yoong’s hands shake as he unfolds the letter.</p><p><em> To Deputy Secretary Hyunseok Min </em>: Yoongi scans the first line and gives his father a hesitant look.</p><p>“Go ahead and read it. It is alright,” his father reassures him.</p><p>Yoongi reads:</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>When Yoongi was finished, there was a stifling silence at the table. All that could be heard was the crackling of the low fire. The sound echoed in his ears as he stood still staring at the letter. Eventually his brother pulled him back into his seat. Yoongi spent the rest of his special dinner pushing the food around on his plate as his father and uncles conversed around him. Yoongi remembers all of the details of that night as if it had just happened.</p><p>“You needed to know that your actions have consequences. Our family is dep-”</p><p>“We’ve already had this conversation, I don’t want this path the Council has chosen for me anymore.”</p><p>“Yoongi, I asked you 6 years ago and you have already made the commitment to the Council.” His father let out a sigh through his nose and flared his nostrils. Yoongi could tell he was getting frustrated but pressed on.</p><p>“I was barely eleven! I was a child. You wer-are my father. I looked up to you and I would have agreed to anything you asked. Father you knew this.”</p><p>“Well you are not a child anymore. It is time that you fulfill your obligation to the Council.” His father planted a stern look on his face that would have scared Yoongi as a child but now just made him roll his eyes. “Try to understand Yoongi,  maybe if I had been wiser then things would have been different,” His father hesitated, “for both of us.”</p><p>Yoongi’s father took a step forward and put his hands on Yoongi’s shoulders. His father was a bit taller than him and Yoongi found that the gesture made him feel small and his father looked into his eyes. His father’s dark brown almond eyes were soft and for a moment Yoongi saw the father he knew as a child. </p><p>“Yoongi, it is time to grow up and fulfil your obligations to the Council and to our family. You cannot go on like this, you must think about your future. This is all I am asking of you right now. Think.”</p><p><em> Think </em>. Yoongi found the words he had readied in his mind dry up under his father’s words. The anger within him dissipated with a sigh and turned to resignation. What was there to think about? The train’s warning whistle blew startling Yoongi from his father’s grasp. </p><p>“Now. Now” His father smiled. “Let’s not have the train take off without you.” He stepped back widening the gap between him and his son. </p><p>“Yea.” Yoongi said weakly turning his back to his father to ascend the steps to board the train.</p><p> “Oh! Before, I forget.” His father reached into his briefcase and pulled out a small package wrapped in light yellow cloth. “Your mother packed this for you. It is supposedly your favorite.” Yoongi’s father extend the package towards Yoongi but didn’t release his hold on it. </p><p>“Thanks.” Looking down at the package attempting to tug if free from his father’s hands.</p><p>“Yoongi.” His father commanded. </p><p>Yoongi looked up from the package.</p><p>“Remember what I said. <em> Think. </em>”</p><p>“Think.” Yoongi replied and his father released his hold on the food. </p><p>“Goodbye dear son.” His father smiled satisfied.</p><p>“Bye father.” Yoongi ascended the stairs as the final whistle blew and the train started forward with a jolt.</p><p> </p><p align="center">⚘⚘⚘</p><p> </p><p>Namjoon’s eyebrows were knitted together and his fists were gathered under his chin with elbows set at his knees. He was quiet and still. He always became like this when he’s trying to process too much at once. Yoongi just waited for him to respond.</p><p>“I thought your father had given up on the whole Ministry Ambassador job?” Namjoon asked the tension left his body as he reclinced into the seat.  By Yoongi’s third year at Hogwarts he had grown tired of studying history and laws and discovered he had a talent for divination. He was excited to start his position as the divination club’s new captain but the conversation with his father made him uneasy. </p><p>“This promotion seems to have brought him back to reality.” Yoongi rolled his eyes. Yoongi can clearly remember when his father received his promotion offer mid summer and as his father read the letter aloud Yoongi felt his life begin to hurdle towards the inevitable.</p><p>“Maybe the promotion was to get you back on track?” Namjoon asked carefully. He knew Namjoon would never make and unfounded accusation aloud. Yoongi was too caught up with events this morning to even consider that a possibility.  Was it that obvious? If an almost sixteen year old could see the Council’s ploy could everyone? Does his father know? </p><p>Yoongi was pulled abruptly from his thoughts by the compartment door slamming open with a bang. </p><p>“HEY! JIMIN!” A fourth year Taehyung called from the threshold to the third boy sleeping next to Yoongi. All three boys in the compartment were simultaneously startled by the noise. Jimin’s body jerked awake and his legs went flying up, the rubber of his shoes nearly grazing Yoongi’s face. </p><p>“Yea, yea. I’m up. I’m up.” Jimin sat up pouting, his messy hair swirled around his face. Taehyung’s mouth transformed into a big, boxy smile at the sight.</p><p>“We’re gonna be arriving soon so uhhh get dressed,” Taehyung said</p><p>“Thanks for waking me up.” Jimin replied rubbing the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>“It’s all thanks to this!”  Taehyung raised his arm to show a black watch with a glowing blue face. Jimin and Yoongi’s eyes grew wide. </p><p>“Is that a muggle watch?” Jimin inquired grabbing at the Hufflepuff’s wrist. Taehyung nodded in response. “Whoa, it’s got so many buttons! And the light is so pretty, did you enchant this?”</p><p>“No! Look!” Taehyung pressed a raised black button on the watch’s side face and the light went out. Beneath the light was the time displayed in block numbers against a shimmering dark green backdrop, 06:20.  </p><p>“WOW” Yoongi and Jimin exclaimed. There appeared to be a bit of magic in the muggle world after all.</p><p>“Where did you get that from?” Yoongi asked.</p><p>“Well,uhh” Taehyung hesitated and nervously fluffed the back of his hair, “ Hoseok gave it to me, he bought it for me over the summer holiday.”</p><p>“Oh.” Yoongi replied. Of course the day couldn’t get worse, he wasn’t even at school yet and had to hear that name.</p><p>“I-i mean Hoseok only got for me because I kept going on and on about his last year. Pretty sure he only gave it to me to shut me up.” He stammered.</p><p>“It’s okay Taehyung. It’s still really cool. Enjoy it.” Yoongi said plainly. Not wanting to linger in the moment too much he rose out of his seat to retrieve his school uniform and robes.</p><p>“We should probably start getting dressed.” Namjoon needlessly suggested, softening the air in the compartment. As Taehyung stepped inside to close the door and long,slender hand prevented the door from completely closing. A handsome face came peering through the crack. It was Head Boy Seokjin. </p><p>“Min and Kim” He called his eyes scanning the tight room, “Kim Namjoon. Prefect meeting in 10 don’t be late. Please and thank you.”</p><p>“10 minutes. Got it.” Namjoon responded and began to quickly pull off his shirt. Seokjin rolled his eyes and slammed the compartment door shut. Yoongi saw a flash of Seokjin’s wand as he drew the room’s curtains. </p><p>Namjoon and Yoongi got dressed to Taehyung’s  minute to minute countdown on his muggle watch and headed to the front of the train with less than one minute to spare. Namjoon was still tucking his shirt in as they opened the door to the head compartment, obviously the last to arrive.  Yoongi gave an apologetic glance to Seokjin and settled in a window seat in the back.</p><p>“Now, that we’re all here. We can get started!” Seokjin said with a charming smile. Yoongi noticed the audible sighs from some of the prefects. Seokjin was  the most popular student at Hogwarts . Yoongi knew that Seokjin did use his looks and charms to his advantage and it worked well for him. Maybe he should have been placed in Slytherin  he pondered.</p><p>Seokjin began the meeting but was rushed because the Head Boy and Head Girl meeting ran over and they were set to arrive at school within the hour.  Yoongi tried to focus on the meeting but his mind was now on Namjoon’s question about his father’s promotion. He dreaded the prospect of the other students whispering around the castle about his family again. </p><p>Then a thunderous round of applause snatched Yoongi from his thoughts. Seokjin was introducing the new fifth year prefects. </p><p>“Up next is Hufflepuff House. New this year we have Roseline Harpstring and Hoseok Jung.” They both stood and turned to wave at their peers. Yoongi’s head turned sharply towards Namjoon who was already staring a him. </p><p>Namjoon was wearing the same worried look on his face. Yoongi was beginning to think Namjoon would look at him like that for the entire year.</p><p>“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.” Yoongi mumbled. Of course the day was getting worse. “ It can’t get worse.” he said to Namjoon almost breaking out into frustrated laughter.</p><p>“Just look at it this way, there’s the feast then you can go to sleep. Tomorrow's a new day and you can start again.” Yoongi was almost comforted by his friend’s words. Just then the hairs on the back of Yoongi’s neck prickled he knew that he wasn’t  out of trouble yet.</p><p>“Last piece of business.” Seokjin called raising his fists. “ We need two people to help reset the Prefect Common Room for this year.” Various goans rumbled through the crowd. “ Any volunteers ?” the Head Boy asked and peered hopefully around the room. </p><p>“Thought so! That’s why I prepare this. Chance!” Seokjin produced as small red velvet pouch from his robes. He then tapped his wand twice and two bits of parchment paper rose from the depths. Yoongi watched as the two papers floated down into Seokjin’s palm. It was a quaint bit of magic and Yoongi caught himself beginning to smile. </p><p>“Let’s see who we have here,” Seokjin held the paper up,” Hoseok Jung.” Seokjin then held the second paper up, and Yoongi stomach churned. “Yoongi Min.”</p><p>Yoongi pressed his palm into his forehead, he had been pushed over the edge. He held in a silent scream that burned his chest, he felt as if he was going to explode.</p><p>Seokjin then dismissed the meeting requesting the two “volunteers” to stay behind to await further instruction. Yoongi's mind was racing, he tried to find a way out of the task. </p><p>The train came to a halt, they had arrived at Hogwarts.</p><p>“Namjoon,” He looked toward his friend, “ Can you please volunteer in my place? I don-”</p><p>“No way bro!”  He replied, waving his hand, “ I’ve got remedial potions class first thing and I wanted to do some studying before hand.” Yoongi sighed, it couldn’t be helped. Namjoon barely received an A on his OWLs for potions and needed to improve for the NEWTs. Yoongi would never ask his friend to skip out on his studies. </p><p>Yoongi just sighed.</p><p>“I’m sorry. Look, meet me in the library after the feast. I’ll let you rant it out.” Namjoon turned and filed out of the room with the rest of the prefects. Yoongi’s  mouth dried as he watched the door shut behind him.</p><p>Seokjin had busied himself piling parchments into his school bag as he called Yoongi over. Yoongi joined Hoseok who was already eagerly awaiting instruction.  </p><p>“Ok you two. The Prefect Common Room has been moved to the fourth floor down the hall from the ancient runes lecture hall. The furniture is all  there but from what the headmistress told me the house elves made a mess of it. So, it will need a bit of tidying up and maybe some slight repairs.” Seokjin ran his fingers through his hair. Yoongi noticed the bags that had begun to form under his wide eyes.</p><p>“It should be simple enough! Shouldn’t take long either,” Hoseok said too cheerfully for Yoongi’s tastes. “ That is unless….”  Hoseok trailed off slowly turning towards Yoongi, which cause Seokjin to also glance up at him searching for a reason for the silence.</p><p>“Ah! That’s right...charms aren’t really your forte Yoongi.” Seokjin looked at him with a mixed expression that was mostly pity.</p><p>Yoongi could feel himself getting hot. First his father this morning now Hoseok bringing up his OWLs again. Last year Yoongi received an A his charms OWLs. It was the lowest grade he’d ever gotten at his time at Hogwarts and being the top student of his year everyone knew. </p><p>“Don’t worry Jung.” Yoongi laughed wanting to sound unaffected. “ I’ll try not  to mess up that new orange mop of yours.”</p><p>Hosoek smirked and smoothed his bangs out his face with a long, delicate finger,”Glad you noticed. It’s an enchantment, I learned this summer. It’s been holding the color for weeks.” </p><p>“Whoa! Really?!” Seokjin said with a big smile.</p><p>The way Hoseok emphasized the “chant” in response made Yoongi’s blood boil. He did not want to explode in front of the head boy instead he channeled his energy into Hoseok’s annoyingly bright orange hair hoping to set it on fire with his mind. </p><p>“Hey. Yoongi are you okay? Your face is  really red.” Seokjin’s smile turned into a grimace. Yoongi turned away from the other two boys. He wasn’t going to give Hoseok the satisfaction of seeing his face red and twisted up with anger. “If you can’t do it, I can ask one of the new prefects. You know how eager they are to show off.”</p><p>“I. Can. Do. It.” Yoongi said through gritted teeth. Seokjin really was suggesting that a fifth year would be better for the task. Yoongi felt himself reaching a tipping point and needed to exit the room before he said or  did something that he could not take back. Something that would further ruin his reputation.</p><p>“I guess I'll see you first thing then.” Hesoek said, Yoongi could hear the smirk in his voice. </p><p>“Hmmm” was all Yoongi could muster before he grabbed his bag from the seat near the window. He left ignoring the goodbye Seokjin gave to him as he slammed the door shut. </p><p>Yoongi exited the train onto the empty platform, the cool September wind blew against his hot face. Yoongi just had to make it through tomorrow morning. So much for starting fresh, Yoongi laughed to himself as he headed towards the waiting carriages.  He hoped this year at Hogwarts would not push him over the edge. </p>
