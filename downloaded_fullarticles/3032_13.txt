    <p>Midnight had arrived, and two wizards were slowly walking the length of a weathered old bridge in London, the water beneath the bridge rushing and rolling with a cold and fierce intensity.</p><p>One man, with a slight grimace and distasteful expression, ran a hand delicately through his white-blonde hair that stood so perfectly on his head, and glanced down worriedly at the rushing waters.</p><p>"You do realize what the political and social repercussions of turning down my offer would be, don't you, Malfoy?" asked his companion, a grizzled older man with a jagged scar running down his face. He practically radiated malice, with strands of his grey-streaked hair falling around his scarred visage, and his hands held behind his back, snug against his billowing tan coat.</p><p>"Quite," Draco Malfoy replied, pulling his traveling cloak around him tighter. "I work for the Ministry now, Lestrange. What happened in the past shall remain firmly in the past."</p><p>Lestrange stopped abruptly in his tracks. "Oh, of course, the precious Ministry," he sneered. "We brought down the bloody Ministry, and it would still be within in our grasp if it wasn't for that damned Potter and his Order of the Phoenix."</p><p>"Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix," Malfoy corrected coldly. "Besides, that was only with the Dark Lord by your side. It's been four years since the Battle of Hogwarts. Our war is over... And we didn't win."</p><p>The moonlight came down harshly on Lestrange's mangled face, and Malfoy had to suppress a shudder in spite of himself. He stiffened up, drawing himself up straighter and staring the older man in the eyes. He knew it would be something like this the instant Aldophus Lestrange, his aunt Bellatrix's brother-in-law, asked him to Apparate with him out onto the old Nottingham Bridge. All he ever got from Dark wizards and his father's old cronies were invitations to join a insurrection against the Ministry.</p><p>Of all people, Malfoy was the last who could risk going over to the Dark side again. The entire wizarding world's eyes were upon him. The few times he had run into Harry Potter or the Weasleys in Diagon Alley, he had felt their eyes follow him the entire time, as if daring him to step out of line.</p><p>"The Dark Lord is dead," Malfoy stated loudly and firmly, forcing ice into his words. "It's over, and you need to accept it and get over it. Your brother is dead. Your sister-in-law, my aunt, is dead. It's over."</p><p>Lestrange's black eyes sparked angrily as they narrowed with undeniable fury.</p><p>"You always were a brat without enough ambition and too much cowardice, boy," he spat, his sharp canines glinting as he hissed.</p><p>Malfoy's eyes hardened as he whipped out his wand in a flash. As he held the smooth wood in his hand, he briefly thought about the two years he was forbidden a wand by the Ministry. He knew, and despised the fact, that the only reason they had returned it was that Potter had inadvertently vouched for him.</p><p>Lestrange drew his own wand, as well, but warily. "When we have once again returned to power, you will regret defying us."</p><p>"I'll take that risk," Malfoy said dryly. "Goodnight, Lestrange."</p><p>He turned away with a swirl of his cloak and began walking away, preparing to Disapparate, when he heard Aldophus begin to speak. Unfortunately, it was the last thing he'd ever hear.</p><p>"Avada Kedavra!" Lestrange recited, and a green light flashed out of the end of his wand faster than one's eyes could follow, and struck Malfoy square in the center of the back.</p><p>The blood drained from his face as his body crumpled, and fell right off the very edge of the bridge, and down towards the rolling black waters, cloak billowing and hair as still as ever. He disappeared with a splash, and the waters continued rushing.</p><p>Lestrange let out a ragged sigh, before tucking his wand within his robes again and glaring upwards at the sky, the moon reflecting the wickedness and cold lack of remorse in his eyes.</p>
