    <p>The story of Harry Potter- was one well known to all wizarding children by the time they were five. Draco was no exception to this rule. Sure, his father rolled his eyes when they read the picture book- muttered scar head under his breath but his mother- she spoke in soft and captivating voices. Acting out the downfall of the dark lord. At the hands of a child just- like- him.</p><p> </p><p>“one day I’m going to meet him, and we’re going to be best friends right mama?” tiny Draco asked- spinning around the room a ball of bright blonde energy- far too hyper for his father’s liking but it suited his mother just fine.</p><p> </p><p>She smiled up at him from her book she read on the sofa; “yes Draco dear, in fact you should be attending Hogwarts the same year if I’m not mistaken.”</p><p> </p><p>He grinned from ear to ear. Harry Potter would be his best friend if it was the last thing he did. “mama- read me the story again!” he demanded- hurling himself onto her lap- bouncing with excitement.</p><p> </p><p>“you really love this book, don’t you?” she asked with a chuckle, settling down to read it once again.</p><p> </p><p>“I love it- and I love Harry and one day he’ll love me too.”</p><p> </p><p>His mother gave him a pat on the head and began reading from his picture book for what could only be the thousandth time.</p><p><br/>
*** </p><p> </p><p>By the time Draco was nine- everyone in his entire life was sick of hearing about Harry Potter. In Draco’s mind they were already best friends. It was only a matter of time before they met and would get into all sorts of mayhem together. When his mother bought him his first broom he had of course asked for one for Harry as well.</p><p> </p><p>“what will he ride when he comes to visit over the summer mother? Those muggles surely won’t have gotten him one.” He had argued in the store, “its what best friends do right mother?”</p><p> </p><p>She had folded, not wanting to remind him that he had never in fact met this boy and he may not be as wonderful as Draco imagined him to be. There were years yet for him to discover that the world was a cold and unforgiving place. She would shield him from that pain as long as possible.</p><p> </p><p>The brooms sat in the cupboard side by side. Waiting for the day that Harry Potter himself waltzed into Malfoy manor to claim his.</p><p> </p><p>A day she highly suspected may never happen. But she didn’t have it in her to break her own son’s heart. Not when she knew the world would do it enough for him.</p><p> </p><p>They trained in the garden- Narcissa herself had been a top-notch seeker in her day. They zipped back and forth- chasing after the golden snitchet. Grinning in the grass as her son grew smarter- grew sharper and faster.</p><p> </p><p>She had no doubts he could take on the best of the best when he reached the right age. Though all he seemed to care about was playing beside Harry.<br/>
</p><p>“mother; do you think I could be a beater?” he asked one day as they practiced flying; he held his lanky arms in the air and poked himself in his small arm.<br/>
</p><p>“you’ve got more of a seekers build love.” She replied smiling at the idea of passing the gauntlet on through the family.</p><p> </p><p>“but I don’t want to be a seeker!” he countered.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t going to pretend it didn’t hurt- after all he was a natural.</p><p> </p><p>“there’s nothing wrong with being a seeker dear- I myself played for Slytherin when I was in school.” She began,</p><p> </p><p>“yes, mother I know. But if I’m a seeker Harry and I will have to be separated- Beaters are always together. Like twins.” He said with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>she laughed- finally understanding where this was going.<br/>
</p><p>“well we had better have the elves start giving you some more protein- get some meat on those bones little one.” She replied-</p><p> </p><p>His face lit up.</p><p> </p><p>She wondered how long it would be like this.</p><p>***</p><p> When Draco was eleven years old- he almost shook right out of his skin.</p><p> </p><p>But he didn’t; because Malfoy’s don’t do that. Malfoys are calm and professional. Father said so.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy’s do not act like deranged little spaz’s.</p><p> </p><p>So- Draco stayed very still. Insides bursting to break free- excitement on his tongue. But silence on his lips.</p><p> </p><p>“mother. Do you think he will be there today?” he asked- attempting his very best impression of his father.</p><p> </p><p>Back straight- mouth pursed- conveying a level of indifference he had yet to master- but at the very least could attempt to fake.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not sure dear- muggles aren’t always too fond of coming to magical London.”</p><p> </p><p>His face screwed up in confusion. Why someone wouldn’t want to experience magical London was an anomaly to him.</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing he didn’t love about diagon ally. The lights, the shops, the people. He wasn’t cooped up in the house anymore. There was magic in the air and he could feel It. It was the most beautiful place he had ever been in his entire life.</p><p> </p><p>“well- next year we will just have to bring him. Those stupid muggles can just stay home.” He huffed- frown turning deeper into a scowl.</p><p> </p><p>“of course, dear.” His mother replied, and it earned her a small smile in return.</p><p> </p><p>“let’s go get a wand mother- it’s the most important thing after all.”</p><p> </p><p>She followed him; after all today was all about him.</p><p> </p><p>The first time Draco met Harry Potter- was an utter disaster. At least the first time he knew it was Harry Potter because that first time didn’t count- he didn’t know it was him. Of course, he didn’t put his best foot forward.</p><p> </p><p>Now- thinking about it; he wasn’t sure he put the best foot forward the second time either. Considering how it all turned out.</p><p> </p><p>He had imagined this moment a million times and never once did he think he would end up feeling so utterly rejected and alone by the end of it.</p><p> </p><p>He went through the sorting ceremony in a bit of a daze- surely the hat would put Potter in Slytherin where they both belonged, and he could apologize when they got to the common room and everything would be back on track.</p><p> </p><p>“better be- GRYFFINDOR” the hat yelled</p><p> </p><p>And his heart sunk deep into his stomach.</p><p> </p><p>If four-year-old Draco could see him now- he firmly believed he would be punched in the face repeatedly with tiny fists for how badly he had fucked this all up.</p><p> </p><p>His father would never forgive him for being friends with a bloody Gryffindor.</p><p> </p><p>His whole life plan was crashing down around him amidst the cheers of the Gryffindor tables.</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter hated him- and that left him with just one option.</p><p> </p><p>They had to be enemies.</p><p> </p>
