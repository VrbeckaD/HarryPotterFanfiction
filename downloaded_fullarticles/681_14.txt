    <p>It was early, too early in my opinion. I was walking the streets of London the sun peeking out behind the ancient buildings and shining it’s bright rays straight into my sensitive eyes. I squinted as I arrived at King’s Cross, I held my luggage case close to my side as all the busy bodies hurried past to catch their trains. I looked up at the high ceilings still unsure of whether or not someone was playing a practical joke on me; even if I had seen what they called magic maybe I was just imagining it? </p><p>I walked towards the platform 9 and stared confused as to where in hell the ¾ was. I scratched my forehead, sliding my sleeves lower on my hands and biting my lip. I walked towards the wall between platforms 9 and 10 going to rest my legs to try and figure out what the hell I was doing when my body fell straight to the ground as I leaned over.</p><p>“Ow what the hell?” I groaned pulling my body up from the wall I had literally just fell through. I looked up picking up my luggage and seeing the large red train labeled ‘The Hogwarts Express’ I gulped. This was definitely real and I was definitely here. I looked around seeing a familiar face of someone I went to my muggle school with. “Jen!” I yelled running up to her. “I’m not batshit crazy!”</p><p>She gave me a look before opening her mouth “BRUHHHHH this shits crazy!” She said in shock. </p><p>“Yeah I’m convinced both of us might be going crazy.” I said a little too loudly as everyone in the station turned to look. I coughed nervously holding my luggage and hoping on the train with her and finding the first available cabin.</p><p>I closed the door before letting out a sigh of relief and sitting with my knees pulled to my chest. Just as my anxiety began to calm I heard the cabin door slam open and a blonde boy groan at the sight of us. “This ones taken too?!” He complained about to shut the door.</p><p>I opened my mouth and let out a small muffled “You can join us.” Before looking away. He smirked looking over at me before placing himself next to my curled up body. “I’m Catie and this is Jen.” I whispered with a small smile. </p><p>He looked over before announcing “I’m Draco Malfoy,” He started “I’m sure you’ve heard of me, every magical family knows the Malfoy name.” He said smugly. </p><p>“Nope never heard of you.” I said flatly, he almost looked offended. “Look I just learned magic exists, I lived my whole life like a normal person.”</p><p>“So your a mudblood?” Now he looked disgusted. </p><p>“Hm I don’t think so? My parents weren’t shocked when they found out I was a witch almost like they knew something I didn’t.” I explained. “I don’t ask questions.”</p><p>He gave me an almost concerned look before opening his mouth and muttering a small “I’m sorry.” Almost inaudible.</p><p>“Well,” Jen started “Both my parents were confused when I got my letter.” </p><p>“So you’re a muggle-born or as stated earlier a mud-blood.” He said seeming as to almost look down upon her as if she was less than.</p><p>“What a shitty derogatory term.” Jen started. “You’re not better than anyone because you were raised with magic.” Her originally small smile replaced with a noticeable frown.</p><p>“Well my father says only purebloods deserve to learn magic.” He said back at me with the same tone.</p><p>“Well your father needs to shove that shit right back in his ass where it came from.” I said finally spoke up. Now the blonde haired boy looked furious as he stood up. </p><p>“You lot are just a bunch of disgusting Mud-Blood.” He said the malice sliding of his lips with ease as he left slamming the door behind him.</p><p>“We may have just pissed off a very important person.” Jen stated as our door opened again.</p><p>Before I even turned my head to see who it was I began to speak angrily “I thought I scared you off already!” I shouted as I saw a blonde haired girl standing in the doorway.</p><p>“I don’t think so, but what the hell did you do to piss of Draco Malfoy?” She asked.</p><p>“I told him to shove his pureblood opinions back up his father ass where they came from.” I explained as if it were the most normal thing to say. I watched her stifle her laughter as she took a seat next to Jen.</p><p>“I like you guys.” She chuckled. “Do you mind if I stay here?”</p><p>“As long as you’re nothing like that asshole.” I stated as she closed the door. </p><p>“So what house are you guys hoping for?” She asked.</p><p>“House?” I looked confused.</p><p>“You know Gryfindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw.” she explained. “Gryfindors are the brave, Slytherin the sly and cunning, Hufflepuff are kind and loyal, and Ravenclaw are the intellectuals.” </p><p>“Well I’m sure as hell not a Hufflepuff.” I joked leaning my petite body against the metal wall. I could feel my knees touch but my thighs never did while I pressed my legs to my chest I could feel my ribs. Jen and the girl I didn’t quite catch her name chatted away while I stared out the window as the as the train started moving.</p><p>Just as things were calming down the door slid open and a quite tall slim boy stood in the door, he had headphones around his neck as he looked around at us. “Mind if I join you?” He asked. I signaled at him to come in and close the door. He did so taking the last available seat next to me. He had almost afro like hair and a large jacket covered his thin physique, a little like me. I brought my body closer to the window almost in an uncontrollable attempt to get away from him. I rested my head against the window enjoying the presence of everyone in the room. They all talked and laughed as my eyes closed and I fell asleep to the sound of their chatter.</p><p>I woke up to the sound of my name being called, we had arrived. I had almost been dreading it as the train ride went by, most people my age were going to college and getting on with their lives and here I was about to go to magic school? It all sounded so crazy. I sounded crazy. I opened my eyes yawning at the sight of the people around me. We all gathered up our stuff before exiting the train and into the trollies. I saw draco malfoy chatting up a small group of three, they looked like they wanted nothing to do with him. My new friends and I took the cart farthest from the front (considering most were full by the time they got me awake.) I held my arms at my chest in the chill of the night. “Got it’s chilly.” I said, my body was away riddled with chills no matter how many layers I had on. </p><p>After the ride we had to take some boats before we were finally at the large castle like building. I stretched my body as we climbed out of the boats and made our way to the great hall where we would be sorted into our houses. I cracked my neck as we all made our way to the front of the large dining room, my new friends and I found ourselves more anxious as ever as the woman we learned to be named McGonagall introduced the ceremony. They began calling names in no particular order.</p><p>As names were called I learned the group Draco had been chatting up were all in Gryffindor and went by the names of Hermoine, Ron, and Harry. Before the hat even touched Draco’s head he was called into Slytherin. I gulped as I heard my name, I sat in the chair and allowed the hat to be placed upon my head.</p><p>“Cunning and wise.” He started, “yet loyal and daring, yes you are very much like Mr. Potter.” </p><p>“Isn’t that lovely.” I muttered sarcastically.</p><p>“You are quite the slytherin but there’s something bigger that over takes your sly nature.” He pondered, “HUFFLEPUFF.”</p><p>“The fuck!” I immediate shouted, which I didn’t mean to say aloud of course, making all eyes turn and stare. </p><p>“Ms. Moore I remind you to watch your language!” McGonagall Scolded. </p><p>“Sorry Ms. McGonagall.” I said standing back up and taking my seat as my friends got sorted one in each house actually. Jen was a Ravenclaw, Angel a Slytherin, and Oliver was a Gryffindor. ‘How iconic of us’ I chuckled to myself. My entire house already virtually hated me for the scene I made. But I mean honestly I was an asshole. I was a great student and I always thought of myself as a great friend but I was a total asshole, I talked back to my teachers, sure I did my work flawlessly but not without giving them a hard time. Especially if I thought the lesson was pointless. </p><p>We were finally showed are dormitories and I just couldn't wait to lie down and fall asleep. Even if I had slept a couple hours ago, the only thing I wanted to do was sleep some more. </p><p>I took a shower and as I was heading back to my dorm I found the door to be locked. People already hated me which nothing new, but this was ridiculous! I was wrapped in only a towel I had my dirty clothes in hand as I stood outside the common room in the cold dungeon. I contemplated just going back to the bathroom and putting my dirty clothes on until I felt a warm hand on my cold body. I turned to look at who it was and there stood Draco. “What do you want? Come to laugh at me because my own house already hates me?” I said a frown forming on my face and tears developing in my eyes. </p><p>“What happened?” He asked pulling my wet body into his warm sweater clad body. </p><p>“My stupid fucking house told me the wrong damn code and now I can’t get in.” I sobbed, I did not need this emotional distress on top of my already shitty life. I didn’t even know why I was opening up to him, for all I know he’ll probably use it against me.</p><p>“Come to my dorm, I’ll get you some clean clothes and you can sleep on my bed for the night.” He explained. </p><p>“And how do I know you’re not gonna do something horrible once you have a poor naked girl in your room?” I asked squinting my eyes at him.</p><p>“No offense Moore but you’re not exactly my type.” He joked. “But for now pretend to be, wouldn’t want people knowing you got locked out by your own house.” </p><p>“Fine.” I said quietly, maybe Malfoy wasn’t so bad, or maybe what I said knocked some sense into him.</p><p>He pulled off his green jumper and handed it to me, “Put this on for now.” He said his pale chest and abs revealed to the empty hallway. “The Slytherin common room is going to be full of people, we’ll want you to be covered up some and if you’re wearing my sweater it’ll help a little.” He explains as I pulled the Green jumper over my head, it reached my mid thigh but I kept the towel around my waist in fear of someone seeing my ass. He wrapped his arm around me as we walked into the common room. </p><p>Angel looked over at me walking in with Draco, no one asked questions or said anything about the blatant rule breaking of me being in a different common room. “Catie! How are you? Why are you here?” She asked quietly after approaching us. </p><p>Before I could open my mouth Malfoy spoke for me, “She’s staying with me for the night.” He stated before pulling me along into his dorm. He had an almost king sized bed in the middle of the small room and a large dresser on the opposite side to the bed and a couch that lay just in the corner. He dug into his drawer and pulled out a pair of unworn briefs tossing them at me. “Hope you don't mind my underwear.”</p><p>“As long as their clean.” I jokes pulling them on under the towel. I finally dropped the towel his underwear laying loosely on my hip bone, his jumper was almost twice my size as my hands completely disappeared in the sleeves. </p><p>“I know I said you’re not my type, but damn do you look hot in my clothes.” He joked back to me.</p><p>“Don’t get any ideas Malfoy.” I stated, poking his chest. “I’m tired.” </p><p>“I’ll take the couch, you’re my guest so go ahead and take my bed.” He said a faint smile gracing his lips.</p><p>“We can sleep together you know?” I said as he gave me a look. “I don’t mean like that you perv! But it might be nice to not sleep alone for once.” I said muttering the last part under my breath.</p><p>“Fine I’ve been persuaded.” He smirked hopping onto his bed as I flopped down next to him immediately sinking in. </p><p>“Thank you Draco.” I smiled at him as I felt his hand run through my long brown hair. </p><p>“Take it as an I’m sorry for being such a dick on the train.” He joked before pulling me into his chest where I found myself falling asleep to the calming smell of peppermint.</p>
