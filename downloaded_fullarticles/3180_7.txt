    <p>The knowledge comes to him instinctively one morning as the colours of spring fade into the heat of summer. It’s in his scent and the tension underneath his skin, the feeling of <em>different</em> and <em>off</em> and <em>change</em>. He lies in his bed and breathes, counts to a hundred then backwards down to zero. It’s useless in that there is no panic from which he’s trying to calm himself, and that in itself is the most shocking part of this revelation.</p><p>Percival rises to sit upright and looks to the side wall where a window would be if he were a less paranoid sort. Instead, it’s his reflection in a mirror, hair disheveled and the beginnings of a scruff on his jaw and up his cheeks. He drags his legs over the side of the bed so that he’s facing the mirror fully, then lifts the edge of his pajama shirt to reveal his stomach. It’s exactly the same as yesterday, and the week before—smooth and pale, the abdomen not as muscularly defined as it used to be when he was younger yet still lithe in that way his biology allows in order to attract a mate. When he touches a hand to it, it’s soft skin over a flat plane and nothing more.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>The shirt drops back down and Percival stands to stretch, groans as joints and stiff muscles protest. He then turns towards the bathroom and thinks about the day ahead while scratching at his throat where the two, three kiss-shaped bruises have long since faded.</p><p>He spares a brief thought to a certain alpha who must be thousands of miles across the sea on some other continent then starts getting ready for work.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>They don't notice, not at first, because his scent is still very much his own and no one really expects it. Everyone who knows him also knows his strict medicinal intake to prevent such accidents even in the midst of enjoying his heat with a safe, willing partner.</p><p>Indeed, his brilliant preventative measures which seems to have backfired spectacularly this one time for some reason.</p><p>But while it does bring up the question as to why and how, it isn’t so difficult to accept that it has happened. He doesn’t believe that it necessarily has to do with him being ready since he would not have his supply of prescription in that case; rather, it’s more that this isn’t a circumstance that can be helped through worrying or regretting.</p><p>A memory slips to the forefront of his thoughts, a soft, confident voice pleasing to his ears explaining that worrying means suffering twice.</p><p>Settling into his chair behind the desk and shuffling the papers into organized piles for the day, Percival snorts to himself even as a smile unconsciously forms.</p><p>As time passes, he learns that it isn’t the easiest situation to finds himself in. Thankfully, he isn’t alone—the support of his subordinates is quite the pleasant surprise. It must be the pheromones that are affecting them to a certain extent, he realizes; however, truth be told, he can’t complain about the gifts of coffee alternatives, soft nesting material and even softer words of encouragement.</p><p>That isn’t to say others don’t talk.</p><p>An unmated, impregnated omega with no father of the child in sight is as scandalous as it gets in this day and age. Yet they are words that barely scratch the surface of his character and reputation, built as they are on the foundation of his irrefutable works within the DMLE. No one can complain that he doesn’t do his job when he performs above and beyond anyone else, not letting his condition hinder it, and planning and training ahead in order to have the department running smoothly in his future absence.</p><p>So through all this, though he may not have been ready to be pregnant, he is more than ready for the child’s arrival.</p><p>She's a tiny thing, blinking curiously at him with his brown eyes that she inherited and a tuft of copper hair softer than anything he has ever touched. She wrinkles her face and cries in hunger; so he puts her to his chest to feed her and breathes in the unique scent that is both similar and not to his own.</p><p>She is his.</p><p>The fact nearly floors him and Percival closes his eyes against the sudden sting of tears.</p><p>What he doesn't cry, his close companions do in his stead once they are allowed to visit.</p><p>“You may only have one father, but you are fortunately rich in aunts and uncles,” he tells her later as she falls asleep.</p><p>And as he listens to her breathe quietly, deeply, sign of life evident against his hand on her small back, he wonders about her name.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>To be honest, she isn’t objectively the best thing that has ever happened to him as many other omegas who mated young and grew large families have once said. But what she is—<em>who</em> she is—is someone he loves not knowing he had the capacity to do so.</p><p>When he talks, his girl gurgles nonsense in return. She stares with wide eyes as he sings her lullabies that don’t work as they are supposed to, cries tears in frustration and anger because he can’t understand her at times. Her laughs are something of a rarity, a quiet giggle at most, but she’s very generous with her smiles. They’re gummy and wide and utterly trusting, eyes curving beautifully in a way that makes Percival wonder at times. He doesn’t smile like that, and so the only explanation is that she takes after the other father in this way. As he strokes her soft red hair in her sleep, scents her and kisses her cheek, something nags in his mind about this same hair that belongs to another. How instead of Percival curling protectively around this child, it had been that person who covered his back with warmth and protection at one point.</p><p>Though he knows they won’t cross paths again, Percival thanks him silently because he has been given a gift he never thought he would ever want from an alpha.</p><p>A gift who becomes a constant presence in the back of his mind.</p><p>The first time he leaves her with someone else to go on a mandatory field mission, he fights viciously and efficiently, even more so than usual. He doesn’t handle the apprehending of the perpetrators personally and is actually concerned with the scent he bears from the scene of battle. Percival almost doesn’t go her when he returns; the chasm between the reality of his work and the ideal of her safety is almost one he cannot bring himself to cross. But as soon as she sees him, his daughter twists to escape the auror’s arms, reaches her small hands to him desperately. She comes to him and crosses that chasm herself to join where he is on the other side.</p><p>And as she whines and tucks her head against his neck, sniffles, Percival vows that this reality of violence and hurt will be made better with his own two hands that hold her so that she can face a future that she deserves.</p><p>He realizes that part of that extends to his work habits. His days from then on are filled with her fussy whining that tells him to stop looking down at the reports and feed her, change her diaper, hold her close. And she won’t let go when he does, grasps tight onto the fabric of his shirt with surprising strength so that most of the time he ends up sitting back at his desk with the bundle tucked against him.</p><p>The aurors had frozen and gawked when they entered his office to such a sight, but they quickly become accustomed to it. Some even offer to take her but she huffs and pouts and glares before turning away to lay her head firmly on his shoulder which secretly pleases him. With such comforting warmth in his arms, Percival blinks awake every once in a while with her drooling onto his chest and a blanket wrapped around the both of them from whoever had found them asleep.</p><p>His daughter smacks her lips cutely and sighs. Percival has a document scrunched in his hand from sometime during the impromptu nap.</p><p>He thinks his life is pretty good.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The most shocking part of this journey—Percival later discovers—was not his own casual attitude towards a life-changing event, but rather—</p><p>“You.”</p><p>The foreigner shifts, remaining by the doors of his office through which he just entered, glances at Percival then away. “It's Newt, but I suppose that will also do.”</p><p>Percival's memory isn't the greatest regarding his heat partners, more bodies to satisfy his needs than anything else. And they blur together after a while. This one, however, tugs something in his mind—unassuming stance, pretty, freckled face and awkward limbs, dull and battered suitcase against a bright blue coat. Then the man makes tentative eye contact and smiles a little uncertainly.</p><p>It clicks.</p><p>His eyes automatically go to the couch side wall where she sleeps and by the time he turns back, he sees the other doing the same. And he watches as this, this alpha go from perplexed to absent curiosity then thoughtfulness. The man sniffs. When the gaze drags slowly away from her and meets Percival's, his heart skips.</p><p>The look is knowing, just as Percival also knows.</p><p>Despite how he now recalls gentle hands and kind words, <em>warmth</em>, Percival braces for the outrage of an alpha whose child was birthed without his knowledge, tenses for action should he try to take her. To his surprise, those green, green eyes skitter away once more.</p><p>“I'm not here on official business, Director Graves,” the alpha starts and Percival stares, waits. “Not sure you recall anything about the book I was writing, but it's pretty much done now. Final draft reviewed and edited, and now I'm simply waiting.”</p><p>It isn’t an explanation Percival is following but Newt doesn't say anything after that. So after a minute of an awkward silence, Percival asks, “What is your point?”</p><p>“I...” Newt trails off, glances up again. “I thought about returning home for a bit while waiting. I—I also thought about, well, you.”</p><p>Something constricts in Percival's chest. “My heat, you mean.”</p><p>“Yes—no. <em>No</em>. I mean, that's a part of it, I suppose,” the alpha hastily corrects, fidgets with the handle of his suitcase. “But mostly you. You were, ah, quite lovely, even outside of. That. I'm not exactly one for attachments—to humans, at least—and certainly not for carnal relations for the sake of it.”</p><p>Percival almost can't believe what he's hearing and he remains still as the alpha starts taking small steps towards him before stopping.</p><p>“But I found myself thinking of you from time to time during my travels. I think I was—am. Attracted in some manner—”</p><p>“'Some manner',” Percival says with much scepticism, crossing his arms as he leans back in his chair. “What exactly does that mean?”</p><p>“That I wanted to know more, that I wanted to see you again if possible,” Newt answers without hesitation. Then his eyes slide over again towards Percival’s child. “How is she?”</p><p>“Wonderful,” Percival replies a bit more honestly than he had intended.</p><p>The other questions aren’t posed, like <em>is she mine, how old is she, why didn’t you say</em>, the unreasonable ones with obvious answers an alpha might ask to stake claim and display territoriality.</p><p>It's obvious enough: the scent of the stranger (but not so stranger) spreading in his office space, the one that had surrounded him completely and seeped into his skin in the duration of his last heat—the final piece of the puzzle that is his daughter’s scent. It's obvious, because they had parted ways not promising a next time, not expecting to ever be within proximity of one another ever again. Because Newt was a foreigner who had been passing through at the time for some vague business and got caught up in trouble that had him being marched straight to Percival to be dealt with. And after wasting days fixing the issue, Percival had found the shy but earnest alpha who has a special love for magical beasts (the cause of the issue) pleasant enough to offer as the date of his cycle approached.</p><p>To which Newt had replied stammering while flushing to the roots of his hair and matching the colour of it.</p><p>Percival remembers he had found it rather hilarious and cute.</p><p>He also tampers down any reaction to the memories that come unbidden of being fucked full to his satisfaction despite his initial doubt about the alpha’s... performance; they had been quite compatible, if he recalls correctly. And now, he isn't quite sure to whether to attribute the passive observation and tone of voice to admirable levelheadedness on Newt's part or a carelessness of sorts.</p><p>It has him asking, “What do you want to know?” in response to the man’s earlier reply.</p><p>Newt’s eyes snap back to his and they’re wide with surprise and bright with hope, and something strange stirs inside him at the sight. It gets worse when Newt smiles tentatively yet happily, mouth stretching wide and eyes crinkling at the corners.</p><p>Mercy Lewis, he’s either always this cute or Percival has some deep introspection to do.</p><p>“I. I was wondering, if you wouldn’t mind sparing an hour or so after you’ve finished for the day to—I don’t know—share a drink? Of the non-alcoholic variety,” he adds, nodding towards the still asleep baby. “And...” The alpha bites on his full lower lip, gaze shifting away uncertainly. “If it’s alright to ask for her name.”</p><p>Warmth abruptly blooms inside of him, the show of interest in the child and subtle acknowledgement of her being Percival’s. Not aggressively demanding but deferring to him as of yet her only father and primary caretaker.</p><p>The baby fusses then as she wakes from her nap and distracts Percival from his answer. He goes to her immediately and picks her up, leaning her up against his chest and shoulder comfortably and running a hand over her back, then again as needed. She sniffs and settles as she recognizes his scent, and only then does Percival turn back towards the other man who looks on like he’s enraptured by them. One hand is no longer on his suitcase but rather hovering in midair before clutching at his coat as though he changed his mind halfway.</p><p>It takes a moment before Newt draws his eyes up once more.</p><p>“Meet me outside by the entrance at six,” Percival says as he decides and cradles his daughter close to kiss the side of her head. “And I will tell you then.”</p><p><em>Will you wait,</em> he’s silently asking. <em>Is it worth it?</em></p><p>Because the point is not waiting another four hours, but allowing Percival to control the pace by answering but also delaying.</p><p>For a good half-minute Newt simply stares, maintaining his distance in a show of significant respect to him. Then at last, he nods wordlessly.</p><p>“At six, then,” he says, soft. “I hope you to see you there.”</p><p>And there’s nothing deceptive in the request, isn’t a command disguised as one. Percival exhales long and slow.</p><p>“Have a good day,” Newt waves awkwardly, gives an even more awkward smile and bows out of the room.</p><p>The door clicks closed and Percival huffs a surprised laugh, finds himself also smiling a little.</p><p>“I think it’s time to meet your other daddy, sweetheart.”</p><p>Artemis babbles at him in response.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Bonus/epilogue/whatever:</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>The worst part of everything is that Theseus finds out. Theseus who is his counterpart in the Ministry of Magic and Newt’s brother.</p><p>”I should have known,” the man says, sat opposite Percival and Newt in Percival’s living room. “I was surprised when I first heard it because you’ve always been strict about protection—”</p><p>“<em>Scamander</em>.”</p><p>“—but us Scamanders are well-known for our virility, you see. And I think Newt must have truly liked you to lose his virginity this way—what are you doing, brother?”</p><p>“Removing you from the premises.”</p><p>“But I haven’t seen my niece yet. Newt. Wait, for goodness’ sake!”</p><p>“We’ll let you know when she wakes, Scamander. In the meantime, please go sew your mouth together so that you can’t speak when you return.”</p>
