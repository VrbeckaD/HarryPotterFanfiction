  <u><b>December 19th.</b> </u>
</p><p> </p><p>Seven months. Seven months two weeks and three days. </p><p> </p><p>It was like a storm cloud following her; or a bright neon sign with the numbers flashing in her face. As she sat in the newly repaired astronomy tower, staring out over the spansive Hogwarts grounds, she signed heavily, her breath visible in the cold December air. </p><p> </p><p>“You really should cast a warming charm at least. You’ll catch a cold out here.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione didn’t acknowledge the intruder right away. Truth be told, if it wasn’t for the puffs of fog her breath was creating, she wouldn’t have even registered how cold it was. Well, maybe the fact everything was covered in a blanket of snow was another clue. She had been feeling suffocated in the very halls that had once felt like home and had come up here to get away. She should have realized Harry would come to check on her. </p><p> </p><p>“I just needed some air,” she said simply as she continued to look out at the view the tower provided. </p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed and moved to her side. “What’s really going on? You’ve seemed down ever since Hagrid started bringing in the Christmas trees. I thought you loved Christmas?”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know it’s been over seven months since the final battle?” Harry stiffened beside her, but she pushed on, “Seven months, two weeks, and three days. All this time has passed, and my parents still have no idea they have a daughter.” Hermione’s breath hitched at admitting it out loud. “How could I have not found time in seven months to go to my parents and restore their memories? I’m a terrible person.” She finished in a whisper as tears began to spill from her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Harry pulled her against his chest and just let her cry for a moment, rubbing her back as she let it all out. He was honestly at a loss for words. They had spent the first two months after the battle just laying to rest the fallen. Grave after grave. Head stone after head stone. They built a memorial; that’s what took the most time. Every name of those that fought Tom Riddle, down to the last elf, was carefully carved on wide polished sections of dark granite. After much deliberation, the stone was placed just outside the Hogwarts gates that led to Hogsmeade; that way the public had a quiet place to remember their loved ones, pay their respect, or show their gratitude to the brave people that fought the darkness.  </p><p> </p><p>After the memorial’s unveiling, he and Hermione had jumped right into helping rebuild Hogwarts. It had taken so much damage they were worried Hogwarts wouldn’t be ready come September 1st. The volunteers had managed to get the major repairs done and the school was able to accept students on time. However, many volunteers, and even students, could still be seen throughout the day assisting in smaller repairs. The quidditch pitch had only been finished the last week of November, delaying the traditional first match up, Gryffindor versus Slytherin.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone had expected Harry to take Kingsley’s offer to join the Auror Academy right away, but after the memorial unveiling… he just couldn’t do it. Even Ron had changed his mind and decided to help George out at Weasley Wizard Wheezes. In the end, Harry had decided to stay with Hermione and signed on for the make up year so he could take his NEWTs. Come September, their days were once more filled with classes and continued repair work.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione, you’re not a bad person,” Harry finally murmured into her hair as he placed a kiss to the top of her head. “I’m so sorry we haven’t gone to retrieve your parents. You say the word and we will skive off school and go get them. Or I can even ask Kingsley if he can spare a team to retrieve them. Tell me how I can help.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s tears had stopped but she took comfort in Harry’s embrace. “That’s sweet, Harry, but I should be there when their memories are restored, and we shouldn’t leave school. They need us here.”</p><p> </p><p>“But what about what you need? You can’t pour anything from an empty cup, Mi. The train leaves for the winter hols in a couple days, if you want to spend the two weeks going after your parents we will. McGonagall will understand.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione finally pulled away and wiped her face as she sighed again, “I would love too, but I know it’s probably going to take longer to find them. I would hate to start searching, only to get close and have to come back to school, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded keeping one of his arms around her shoulders. “How about I ask Kingsley to pull some strings and locate them for us, so that the second we have some time, we can shoot out there and get them. Until then, we take a holiday of our own. I don’t know about you, but I could use a break from this castle.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione chewed her lower lip. “I suppose I could use a break from the castle too,” she said, remembering what brought her to the tower.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s take a muggle holiday. Leave our wands behind and disappear until New Years,” he suggested.</p><p> </p><p>“Leave our wands? I don’t know, Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>“We need a break, maybe from magic too. We can take a timed portkey to bring us back.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry admired Hermione’s profile as she turned over his proposal in her head. After a long minute Hermione turned back to him with a small smile. “Okay, I’m in. A muggle holiday. Let’s do it.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry cheered and spun her around, eliciting a giggle from her. “Harry Potter, you put me down this instant,” she said between laughs.</p><p> </p><p>He set her down with a laugh of his own. “I’ll go write a letter to Kings now. You let McGonagall know the new plan and I’ll set everything else up. Just leave it to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione worried about Harry’s abilities to plan a holiday, but agreed nonetheless. It was one less thing she would have to stress about.</p><p> </p><p>After lingering maybe a moment too long in each other's embrace, Hermione asked hesitantly, “Do...Do you think we should invite Ron?” </p><p> </p><p>Harry stiffened once more and some of the levity left his expression. “Do you want me to?” he asked seriously, studying her face.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione and Ron had fizzled out faster than anyone had expected. Their relationship hadn't even made it to the memorial unveiling. They had parted amicably as it was discovered they just weren’t well matched romantically, but there was still some lingering awkwardness. </p><p> </p><p>“I..Is it bad if I say no? I think part of me knows it won’t be much of a get away if Ron were to come with us. You know how he is…”</p><p> </p><p>Harry seemed to relax as he nodded. “I agree. To be honest, I’d rather not play chess ever again if I can help it.”  </p><p> </p><p>Hermione grinned at his joke and the friends returned to the warmth of the castle to ready themselves for a little time away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <u> <b>December 21st</b> </u>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hermione was right to doubt Harry’s holiday planning. An International portkey later, they had arrived in New York. That part wasn’t so bad. Hermione had been to the Big Apple when she was about eight years old with her parents. They had even come at Christmas to see Time Square decked out for the holidays.</p><p> </p><p>The problem she was having wasn’t with Harry’s choice of destination. No. The problem was the broomstick he was holding and urging her join him on. She <em> hated </em>flying. </p><p> </p><p>They were currently outside the local American Ministry, where their international portkey had spit them out. After a quick check to assure their passports were in order, the personnel had provided them a departure point outside to take leave to their next destination. This had confused Hermione until she saw Harry pull his Firebolt from the bag she had charmed for him. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on, Hermione. You know I’d never let you fall. I would have gotten a car, but there isn’t a road all the way to the place where we're going.”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought this was supposed to be a <em> Muggle </em> holiday?” She retorted as she gripped the strap of her bag tighter. “Why can’t we get there by <em> Muggle </em>means?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed. “We can, but its a two mile hike. While that normally wouldn’t be too bad, it snowed yesterday. I didn’t think you would want to drive there and hike through the snow uphill for two miles.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione considered this, and said stubbornly, “You know, that wouldn’t have been a problem if you had let me bring my wand. I could have done warming charms and cleared the path to the door with magic.”</p><p> </p><p>“We agreed this would be a vacation from all that. The holiday I promised is just a short broom ride away. Come on, ‘Mi, trust me. I swear I won’t do any dives or go higher than necessary,” Harry reassured her as he held out his hand for her to join him. With fear in her eyes, Hermione hesitantly took Harry’s offered hand as he helped her onto the broom in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>“Now, just hold tight to the broom, my arms will be around you the whole time. Try to lean in the same direction I do and try not to lean too much forward, or the broom will speed up,” Harry instructed as he put his arms around her and gripped the broom handle right in front of her hands. He pulled them up a bit further in the air until their feet were no longer touching the ground. “Ready? Here we go.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry guided the broom higher and the city began to fall away. Giving a quick look to the compass on the tip of the handle, he turned the broom lazily to the right and set off. </p><p> </p><p>After about ten minutes, Harry’s warm breath near her ear startled Hermione, “You can open your eyes. You’re going to miss all the good views. We just cleared Manhattan if you want to look back.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione shivered involuntarily and realized just how <em> close </em>Harry was to her right now. Keeping her eyes shut tight she asked, “How did you know my eyes were shut?” Feeling him chuckle behind her she continued, “I saw the city when I was eight. Just tell me when we are ready to land. Where are we going anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry had refused to give Hermione <em> any </em> details about his plans before they had left. All he would say is that he had taken care of everything, pack warm, and make sure her passport was available. Feeling as down as she was about Christmas, she had secretly been hoping he would plan to take her somewhere tropical, with no hint of snow or anything remotely resembling  traditional Christmas festivity. Her hopes were dashed when he said to pack warm. Still, she was happy to get out of the castle...If only she were on the <em> ground </em>. </p><p> </p><p>“If you’d open your eyes I could show you. There are some pretty historical landmarks around here you might want to see,” Harry teased in a sing-song voice.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione sighed frustratedly and peeked from behind her eyelashes. <em> Holy Merlin </em> they were high! Shutting her eyes tight again she said, “I can’t. Too high.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head at her but decided to narrate their way along so she didn't completely miss out. “Well, as pretty as the city was, it has nothing on the scenery in front of us. The Hudson river is below us, the banks are covered in snow. If I remember the map right, New Jersey is on our left and New York to the right. The trees almost look like the were dipped in glitter, with the sun hitting them and shining through the ice.” Harry quieted for a moment as they sailed along.</p><p> </p><p>“The only thing I see right now that doesn't look frozen are the cars on the motorway and the river. The coolest part are the buildings. The red brick. The stain glass window churches. Even the large red barns with their snow-covered roofs. There are so many neat things to see.”</p><p> </p><p>Something occurred to Hermione that made her pop her eyes open, which she immediately regretted. “Harry! We didn’t disillusion ourselves! What if the Muggles see us? We’ll be spending Christmas in the American slammer!”</p><p> </p><p>“I took care of—Hold on. Did you really just call the jail here ‘the slammer’?” Harry asked while trying not to laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione, who had been unable to reshut her eyes, was too frozen in terror, or maybe it was awe, to retort back at him. As much as she hated to admit it, Harry was right; It really was an amazing view. <em> But Holy Hell they were high. </em>Hermione’s hands were losing feeling, either from the cold or from holding the broom in a death grip.</p><p> </p><p>“How much farther?” she asked in a quivering voice.</p><p> </p><p>Harry gave her a squeeze to reassure her. “Maybe ten more minutes, I didn’t want to move too fast and scare you. I can just make out the edge of the estate. Not long now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I appreciate the gesture, but I really need to be on the ground now. How about I close my eyes again and you go as fast as you think is safe for us and just get me off this broom?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry hesitated. “You sure? It's really not much farther at this speed.”</p><p> </p><p>She closed her eyes tight once more she said, “Yes. I’m ready, just get us there.” </p><p>Hermione didn't feel a change happen right away, but after a few beats, Harry's arms tightened around her and he pressed closer to her, causing them both to lean forward just enough for the Firebolt to pick up speed. She felt the wind whip around her and she swore she could practically hear Harry’s smile. Thinking of this even got her to grin herself, momentarily forgetting her terror.</p><p> </p><p>She felt the wind slow just as Harry said, “We’re here.” He lowered the broom to the ground. She waited until her feet were firmly beneath her before she opened her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>She slid off the broom and immediately rounded on Harry. “I don’t know if I should hug you or punch you, Harry Potter! The was absolutely terrifying, but thank heavens you’re a competent flyer. I swear, next time I’m doing the hike through the snow. I don't care if it’s uphill both ways.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry let her run out of steam with an amused expression. When she finished her rant she finally looked around a bit. All she could see was...woods. </p><p> </p><p>“Uh Harry...Where are we?”</p><p> </p><p>Instead of answering, he gripped her shoulders and spun her around. “<em> That </em> is where we’re staying.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s breath caught. Nestled in the wide clearing, Harry had landed them in was a small log cabin with a wrap around deck. She could just make out the smoke swirling lightly from stone chimney. White icicle style Christmas lights hung around the perimeter of the roof, completing the picturesque scene.</p><p> </p><p>“Want to see what’s inside?” Harry asked, holding up a set of keys.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione nodded eagerly and they set off for the front door; Harry, stowing his Firebolt back in his bag as they walked.</p><p>“How ever did you find this place?” she asked as she admired the carved wood railing surrounding the deck.</p><p> </p><p>Harry barked a laugh. “Actually, Kings owns it. He said we could use it as a thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>He paused thinking for a moment and then continued, “Actually, I should say his wife is letting us use the place. She’s a writer and I guess she used to spend a few months here every year to get away and work on her books. Apparently this is where he sent his wife during the war. When Dumbledore died, she moved here. She’s not the best with a wand and he was worried he wouldn’t be able to protect her.”</p><p> </p><p>“She wasn’t worried she’d be found here?”</p><p> </p><p>“They have pretty special wards, plus, none of Riddle’s Death Eaters were ever found in the states. The ministry here comes down pretty hard on the pureblood agenda. I heard even Grindlewald gave up on trying to operate in the states back in the day,” he answered with a shrug as he put the key into the lock and opened the door.</p><p> </p><p>They pushed inside and stomped the snow from their boots. Looking around, Hermione immediately loved it, even if it was on the small side. To her left sat a cozy living room with a couch and comfy looking armchairs surrounding the fireplace. The fireplace in question already had a fire burning that looked like it had been started some time ago. A small stack of wood sat in an iron holder with the fire poker hanging on the side. The mantle had a few candles and not much else. A coffee table, standing lamp, and fluffy cream colored rug completed the living room.</p><p> </p><p>The cabin was completely open, no walls separated the living area from the kitchen and dining area. In front of them was a staircase that Hermione assumed would take them up to the bedrooms. </p><p> </p><p>“You want to look around down here or head up and pick our rooms?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione peered around and said, “Rooms I think. We can drop our bags and look around after.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s face split into a wide mischievous smile. “Race you!” He laughed as he took off toward the open staircase. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione was giggling as she tore off after him. “No fair, Potter! You had a head start!”</p><p> </p><p>In the hallway at the top of the stairs were three doors. The first one Harry pulled open ended up being a storage closet. “Looks like these two must be the rooms. How about we pick a door and that will be our room. No peeking.” </p><p> </p><p>“Is this whole trip going to be a string of silly games?” Hermione asked teasingly; the smile the short race had caused still on her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe. Anyway, pick a door. No peeking!”</p><p> </p><p>She rolled her eyes at his antics and chose the door over the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Harry walked over to the other door across from hers. “On three yeah? One. Two. Three!” and he and Hermione both twisted open the doors and peered into their new abodes. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione squealed in delight. The room she had chosen had a huge king sized bed and another door she was sure was the en suite. The bed was piled with pillows and had a thick warm looking quilt spread across it. The thing Hermione was most excited about though, was the wide, low window with a small fainting couch in front of it. The view of the snowy hill behind the cabin was picturesque. After a quick look into the en suite she moved back into the hallway to see how Harry had fared and nearly walked right into him.</p><p> </p><p>“Whoa, Harry! Sorry.”  She stumbled back a bit off balance and he grabbed her arm to help steady her. Once she was stabilized he slowly dropped his hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Where’s the fire?” he joked.</p><p> </p><p>“Hush you. I was just coming to see how you like your room.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione noticed a slight pinched look cross his face before he schooled his expression and grinned. “It’s fine. Great even. No tradesies. How about you? Do you love it?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione eyed him suspiciously but answered him anyway. “The room is quite lovely, the view is amazing.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled happily and ushered her back downstairs and into the kitchen. “You hungry at all?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not really, between the portkey and the broom ride I’m not feeling up for food. I’d kill for a cuppa though.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, amused and set about finding the tea. As he moved towards the cupboard he noticed a handwritten note taped to the refrigerator. </p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <em> Harry &amp; Hermione, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I hope you made it safely and enjoy my little slice of heaven. The kitchen is fully stocked and the bed has been freshly made. If you so choose, the hot tub on the deck in the back is an exquisite experience this time of year.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Your nearest neighbors would be the Tremblay family. Martin Tremblay was nice enough to come up and get the fire started for you. If you need anything they are the next house off the road (the bright yellow house, you’ll be able to see it from the street.) </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Harry, I know Kings gave you the low down on the snow mobile but please use caution, it can go really fast. There are trails all over there if there ends up being enough snow to use it. If not, the ATV is under the brown tarp. The keys for both are hanging by the door. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Above all, the community here is full of the nicest people. I highly recommend checking out all the local festivities. Martin’s wife, Charlotte, is usually involved in a number of the holiday planning. I suggest touching base with her to get the low down. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> There is enough wood cut for a couple days but if it stays cold you will need to chop some more. The wood sections are on the side of the house and the ax is in the cargo box next to the wood pile. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Lastly, I set out some boxes of Christmas decorations. You can buy a tree in town or you’re welcome to chop one down (we have a permit, so no worries.) The stand is with the decorations. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I think that’s it! I hope you both have a wonderful holiday. I can’t wait to hear all about it when you return.  </em>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <em> All the best,  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Mrs. Shacklebolt </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry read it carefully and then passed it to Hermione and set back to finding tea. He was just putting the kettle on when Hermione said, “This is going to sound crazy, but do you know Kingsley’s wife’s name?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry searched his memory for a mention of her but Shack usually called her ‘his old lady’ or ‘the Missus.’ “You know, I don’t think he’s ever told me her name. And when I saw her at the memorial unveiling we didn’t talk much. I already knew who she was so we weren’t really introduced.”</p><p> </p><p>“Me either. I wonder if any of the books she wrote are here…”</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later they both had steaming mugs in their hands as they took stock of the first floor. The kitchen was a home cook’s wet dream. Harry was pretty sure the whole cabin had been designed around the kitchen. The cabinets were a warm cream color and the granite counter tops were a deep midnight blue. The double oven, stovetop, fridge, and utility sink were all stainless steel. One side of the counters were also an eat-in-bar, with four pine stools lined up against it. The mahogany hardwood floors carried throughout the entire cabin.  </p><p> </p><p>Leaving the kitchen they saw a sliding glass door that led out to the deck. Hermione could make out the snow covered hot tub the letter had mentioned. She shivered just thinking about being out in the cold in a bathing suit.</p><p> </p><p>In the back corner, not far from the sliding glass door, were bookcases. She wondered how she had failed to notice those when they had first walked in. They were the same mahogany as the floor and stretched from the floor to the low ceiling. With two in each wall, they capped the corner. Books were practically spilling from them as it was clear their owner had long ago ran out of space and continued to try and fit in more tomes.</p><p> </p><p>Harry left Hermione to peruse the shelves to put another log and the fire before it died. She joined him on the couch minutes later. “Well, I must admit you did quite well with this place.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is that a good job I hear? You know, I’m surprised. You haven't asked where we are since we landed. I expected you to want all the details of my plans.”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean there’s more than just the cabin?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “Of course there’s more. I could have found a snowy cabin back in Britain.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione looked at him impatiently when he stopped speaking. “Well? Out with it, you. Where are we? Why here?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled again and decided not to draw it out any further. “We are on the edge of Tarrytown...also known as—”</p><p> </p><p>“Sleepy Hollow,” she finished for him. </p><p> </p><p>“How is it you know everything?”</p><p> </p><p>“It was made famous by the writer Washington Irving. Well, actually kind of invented by him. I read Rip Van Winkle years ago. Irving is hailed as the founder of American literature. He’s quite famous in the literary world.”</p><p> </p><p>“True, the town also makes quite a fuss about Christmas. They have a tree lighting and a bunch of other events. Should be fun.” </p><p> </p><p>Hermione saw Harry’s excited face and tried not to rain on his parade but…”Harry I’m not sure I want to make a fuss over Christmas this year. I just want to relax and forget everything for a bit. Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry took Hermione’s hand. “Look. I get it’s difficult for you to not have your parents here. But you once loved Christmas time. I’ve never really gotten to experience it and I was hoping we could both really dive into it this year.” </p><p> </p><p>Harry looked down at their hands and continued, “All my Christmases were either at Hogwarts or spent in a cupboard pretending I didn't exist. The only Christmas I’ve had that even came close was that year with Sirius at Grimmauld Place, but even that was a bit wonky. Sirius was stir crazy, the Weasleys were...well, the Weasleys. I love them but they don't really shout traditional Christmas. Maybe that was traditional for wizards..but you know what I mean. Then last year we were nearly murdered by a snake on Christmas Eve...I would really like this year to be different.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione warred with herself, part of her was shouting for an immediate Christmas activity while the other half of her stood on Mount Crumpit and sneered at the thought. </p><p> </p><p>“Harry I...I hear you. Can we talk about it in the morning? I’m feeling super jetlagged. I’d love to read for a bit and head off to bed.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sid his hand out of hers and nodded, not meeting her eyes. “Of course. I think I’m going to stick by the fire for a bit longer. See you in the morning, ‘Mi.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione chewed her lip and with a last concerned look at Harry, she hurried up the stairs to her room. She closed the door behind her and leaned against it. She hated feeling like she was letting Harry down but she wasn’t completely sure she could handle being festive when part of her wanted nothing more than to hide as far away from the memories those activities would surely stir up. </p><p> </p><p>Standing there for a long minute she decided maybe a relaxing bubble bath would help her unwind and headed into the en suite. The bathtub was deep and a nice oval shape. She  noticed it when she had peeked in earlier. It looked very inviting. After the steaming water was filled with thick bubbles, she piled her hair onto her head in a messy bun and slipped into the lavender scented bath.</p><p> </p><p>~*~*~*~*~</p><p> </p><p>Downstairs, Harry pulled a slightly crumpled, folded paper from his pocket. He read it over and sighed. After awhile he stuffed it back into his pocket and patterned into the kitchen. After a look around the various cupboards and drawers to familiarize himself with everything, he began pulling out bowls, flour, spoons, pans and other various bits from the pantry and fridge.</p><p>Soon he was lost in his own little world.</p><p> </p><p>Over an hour later he pulled the last pan of cinnamon streusel pumpkin muffins from the oven and set them on a rack to cool. Finally feeling completely knackered he went back upstairs to change into pajamas and get some shut eye.</p><p> </p><p>Once in the room he picked, he grabbed his bag and began rifling through it. As helpful as the expanded bag was, it was dreadful to use and find things in. After realizing his pajamas simply weren’t in his bag, he roughly tossed his bag to the ground in frustration. He <em> knew </em> he had packed them, where could they have...Harry smacked his forehead. He <em> had </em> packed them...in <em> Hermione's </em> bag. She had come up to fetch him when they were getting ready to leave. She had reminded him to bring them and he had stuffed them into her bag in the rush to leave.</p><p> </p><p>Not wanting to wake her, he decided he would just sleep in his t-shirt and boxers tonight and get his pajamas from her tomorrow. He stuffed his jeans and socks back into his bag and hung his coat over the nearby chair. With a quick look around his “room” he quietly slipped back out into the hall and back down the stairs. Putting a couple extra logs on the fire, he laid on the couch and covered up with the small throw that had been draped on the back.</p><p> </p><p>Despite the less than ideal sleeping arrangement, he’d had worse and was soon asleep after staring into the fire as the flame began to lick the freshly added wood.</p><p> </p><p>~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p> </p><p>The nice long bath had Hermione feeling much more relaxed. She then took a quick shower to wash her hair. After wrapping herself in the delightfully plush towel, she set to see if they had a blowdryer in this place. It looked like it was fully outfitted with Muggle appliances so it stood to reason.. <em> Aha! </em> She found the object of her desire in the bottom drawer of the vanity. </p><p> </p><p>She carefully brushed, dried, and braided her hair into a single plait down her back. When she finished, she hitched up her towel and went into her room. Finding her bag, she fished out the book she was reading and set it to the side, then began unpacking her clothes into the empty wardrobe. When she came across her sleepwear, she slipped them on and continued to upack. </p><p> </p><p>She was nearly done when she pulled out a bundle of fabric she didn't recognize. Shaking the bundle free, she discovered it was a man’s pj set. Realizing it was Harry’s, she set them aside to take to him. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione put the last of her things away, took her toiletries bag to the bathroom, brushed her teeth, and then scooped up the now properly folded nightwear and set off to Harry’s room.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed the hall and knocked lightly on his door. When he didn’t respond she knocked a bit harder. Deciding he must already be asleep she figured she could just slip in and leave his clothes by his bag. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione pushed the door open quietly and was shocked at the room it revealed. Harry was not in it and it was most definitely <em> not </em> a bedroom. It looked like an office. Opposite the door was a  window with a large desk sitting under it. The office chair had Harry’s jacket draped over it and his bag was beside it. The wall to the right had a half book case that looked much neater than the one down stairs. Where the other was filled with fiction, the one here seemed to be all reference books for writing: Dictionary, thesaurus, baby name meaning books, an atlas, encyclopedias, English writing books, travel books. <em> She must have done most of her writing here, </em>Hermione thought as she looked over the modern typewriter atop the desk. </p><p> </p><p>Looking around the small room she realized there wasn’t even a loo attached. Wondering where Harry could be, she decided to check downstairs. <em> Where else could he be </em> after all she thought.</p><p> </p><p>The smell of cinnamon baked goods hit her as she descended the stairs. She didn’t see him in the kitchen but did spy a set of amazing looking muffins. </p><p> </p><p>Turning to the still glowing fire, she found Harry asleep on the couch, his feet and a good portion of his legs sticking out from the bottom of the small blanket.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Merlin. This boy and his chivalry,” Hermione said under her breath as she decided what to do. She just stood there, staring at him, as she considered her options. Without magic, she had no way to make another bed for him. She cursed him for talking her into leaving her wand behind. Her options were let him sleep on the couch, give him the bed and sleep on the couch herself, or let him share the bed with her. </p><p> </p><p>She sighed as she realized there was only one option.</p><p> </p><p>“‘Mi, I know I’m handsome, but watching me sleep is a bit manic, don’t you think?” His voice startled her as he spoke with his eyes still closed, cracking one eye open he continued, “Joking aside, what’s wrong? You okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione gave him a look. “No, it is not fine! Why didn’t you tell me you didn’t have a bed? I should have realized when the letter said ‘the bed’ and not ‘beds.’ I can’t believe I didn’t catch that. I was too focused on the fact that we didn’t know her first name.” She huffed once more and gave him a look that said “Start talking.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat up sleepily and put his glasses back on. “What would that have solved? I don’t mind kipping on the couch. I want you to have a good time on this holiday. Finding out I messed up right out of the gate and got us a place with only one room would have looked bad. But I swear Kings said this had everything we would need. I never thought to make sure it had two beds, he knew both of us were coming,” Harry shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione stared at him for a long moment and said, “Alright, here are your pajamas; they were in my bag. Come on, lets get some sleep. I’m wiped out.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked at her questioningly as he caught the night clothes she tossed to him. “What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t act daft. I’m not going to let you sleep on the couch with a blanket that doesn't even cover you when there is a king sized monster of a bed upstairs. We’re both mature enough to share a bed.” She gave him a look that she hoped said ‘no arguments’ and turned on her heel to head back upstairs. A heart beat later she heard him shuffle off the couch and follow her up.</p>
