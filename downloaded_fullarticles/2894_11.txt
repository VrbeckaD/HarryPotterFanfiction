          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story begins a year after the first wizarding war ended. Gideon Prewett and Edgar Bones are discussing their surnames.</p><p>Edgar stated, "I hate mine. I mean come on, my surname is Bones."</p><p>Gideon said, "I bet you've been made fun of for it lots, Ed."</p><p>Edgar grimaced. "Many, many times."</p><p>Gideon smiled. "I like my surname, it's not too common and not too weird."</p><p>Edgar agreed, "I like your surname too, Gid."</p><p>Gideon grinned. "I just had an idea. If we ever get married, you can take my surname."</p><p>Edgar smirked. "Are you proposing already?"</p><p>Gideon chuckled. "So, what if I am? I love you and you love me, why don't we tie the knot right here and now?"</p><p>Edgar asked, "Are you being serious?"</p><p>Gideon got down on one knee and politely inquired, "Would you Edgar Bones do me the honour of becoming my husband?"</p><p>Edgar replied, "Yes."</p><p>Gideon got up again and told him, "I'll get you a ring as soon as I can afford one."</p><p>Edgar reassured him, "I'd wait an eternity for you."</p></div>
