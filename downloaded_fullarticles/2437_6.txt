          <div class="userstuff"><p>As the Boy-Who-Lived enters that magical room</p><p>In search of Ravenclaw's lost heirloom</p><p>They are excited and hopeful that he has returned</p><p>To help fight for the freedom they have certainly earned</p><p>()</p><p>But, alas, no. He is not here to fight.</p><p>He seeks something else in the castle tonight</p><p>So the girl with dreamy eyes and pale blonde hair</p><p>Helps him find what he needs in the Eagle's Lair</p><p>()</p><p>But then - no! He is seen!</p><p>By the Sister - triumphant and mean -</p><p>She touches her mark!</p><p>And they know he's now summoned, the Lord of the Dark</p><p>()</p><p>Now comes the one with stern face but kind eyes</p><p>She binds two she hates, but the other one flies</p><p>She gathers the teachers, and her students soon after</p><p>Just as the Dark One arrives and attempts to barter</p><p>()</p><p>But they have all come, his friends and his allies</p><p>Those who are kind, and courageous, and wise</p><p>Of Emerald Green's loyalty, that is put to the test</p><p>As they all unite so he can continue his quest</p><p>()</p><p>He runs through the castle, to speak with the ghost</p><p>Then the battle begins, the thing he fears most:</p><p>His loved ones in danger, but they do not stop -</p><p>There is the Giant, the Brother, and the plants that they'll drop</p><p>()</p><p>Meanwhile, the two lovers have sought the means to ruin</p><p>The remnants of the soul that they've been pursuing</p><p>Amongst chaos and carnage, the three reunite</p><p>And they go to the room where they used to play, and to fight</p><p>()</p><p>But inside that room the three meet old foes</p><p>How to put out the fire, nobody knows...</p><p>And then a thunderous blast tears their world apart</p><p>Fulfilling the fear of the mother's Boggart</p><p>()</p><p>The boys want the revenge that is satisfying and swift</p><p>But the Girl reminds them of their task, and of the Boy's gift</p><p>"We're the only ones who can end it!"* she cries</p><p>Look into his mind, see where he lies!</p><p>()</p><p>They dodge past giant spiders and flying crystal balls</p><p>As The Army and The Phoenix fight-to-kill in the halls</p><p>But is it too late for the girl of purple flowers</p><p>Who's fallen victim to the wolf and his shape-shifting powers?</p><p>()</p><p>Then come the monsters who obliterate joy</p><p>And he cannot fight them, not just him, not one Boy</p><p>So to his aid come one each from houses blue, yellow and red</p><p>To help him find happiness; "we're still here, still fighting!"* she said</p><p>()</p><p>They run to the tree, stilling it's strike and it's smack</p><p>So they can get to the Lord and the snake in the shack</p><p>Where they witness the slaying of that Saddest Servant</p><p>They bottle his memories, but they lose the serpent</p><p>()</p><p>They return to the castle where the fighting has stilled</p><p>Those left alive look for the ones that are killed</p><p>His two friends leave him, to console and to mourn</p><p>With the red-haired family, now united but torn</p><p>()</p><p>And then he sees them laid down, both have given their lives:</p><p>The best teacher he had and his brave young wife</p><p>And the Boy cannot stand it and escapes from the Hall</p><p>To the headmaster's home at the heart of the school</p><p>()</p><p>Where he uses the power of the Pensieve</p><p>To witness the memories he can barely believe</p><p>For the one he had grown to loathe and despise</p><p>Had actually been loving and good all the while</p><p>()</p><p>And from the words of the one that he used to hate</p><p>He finds out the true nature of his fate...</p><p>With twisting stomach and heavy heart</p><p>He knows he needs go right back to the start</p><p>()</p><p>On his way, he gains a pledge from his friend</p><p>Consoling himself, knowing he can now make amends</p><p>For the pain that they've all had to bare in his name</p><p>He walks in to the forest, from where his summons came</p><p>()</p><p>The stone brings his loved ones from behind the veil</p><p>And with their words in his heart he knows he won't fail</p><p>With acceptance comes tolerance of the fear and the dread</p><p>So he faces the Dark One, who strikes him down. Dead.</p><p>()</p><p>And he visits the place, he knows not where</p><p>And he learns of the rest from the one with white hair</p><p>And he chooses to return to those that love, and that live</p><p>Knowing there's much more to learn, and much more to give</p><p>()</p><p>The Dark Ones do not know that he lives on</p><p>Deceived by the Mother, they celebrate that he's gone</p><p>They return to the castle, to announce their triumph</p><p>His body held tenderly in the arms of the Giant</p><p>()</p><p>Cries of disbelief and despair cut through the air</p><p>Most painful of all from the girl with fiery red hair</p><p>He stays still as stone, keeping up his deceit</p><p>Whilst the Other Boy suffers the burning hat and it's heat</p><p>()</p><p>Then chaos reigns again, as more allies arrive</p><p>And he waits for the right moment to reveal he's alive</p><p>There are Thestrals and elves, giants and centaurs</p><p>And they all have their part to play, to settle their scores:</p><p>()</p><p>The boy born to those who gave their minds for the Light</p><p>Takes heed of the task he'd accepted that night</p><p>He takes up the sword and the serpent is slain</p><p>For if that is not done, all else is in vain</p><p>()</p><p>Deep within the wronged mother, fire and fury is in bloom</p><p>That seems to be born out of her very womb</p><p>And she fights and she curses in that great, ancient Hall</p><p>Finishing the dark witch in one almighty brawl</p><p>()</p><p>And suddenly: stillness. They all turn and stare</p><p>As the Boy faces the Dark One and all is laid bare:</p><p>He shouts that it must be him, and then explains why</p><p>Neither can live while the other survives*</p><p>()</p><p>The sun bursts through the glass, bright and blinding</p><p>As there is a crash and a flash as spells are colliding</p><p>And the Dark One's wand soars right through the air</p><p>Into the hands of the Chosen One, as they still stand and stare</p><p>()</p><p>And then there are cheers of jubilation and joy</p><p>Finally it's all over, thanks to this one wizard boy!</p><p>And it's the dreamy-eyed girl that again comes to his aid</p><p>Knowing what he needs, she acts out her charade</p><p>()</p><p>And with the two he trusts and he knows the best</p><p>He returns back to that office, for one final test</p><p>What to do with the Hallows, is the advice he seeks:</p><p>One is lost, one he hides, and the other he keeps.</p></div>
