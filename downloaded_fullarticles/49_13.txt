    <b>Chapter 1 - Color My World</b>
  </u>
</p><p>Teddy looked down at his hands the day James Potter turned up on his studio doorstep. His hands that never changed, try though he might; his fingers with prints that refused to morph and re-form, and broad sideways nails that he could never fill with color unless he got paint on them. Palms half hidden beneath the fraying edge of his worn mustard-yellow jumper, he opened the door. His thumb rubbed along the frayed sleeve hem as James swept him up into a tight hug.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Teddy asked, breathless and surprised.  </p><p>“Is that anyway to greet your favorite person in the world?” James replied with confidence as he swept into the studio behind Teddy, a brown leather backpack slung over his shoulder and a matching suitcase floating at waist height trailed behind him. “Make that your favorite person in the universe?”</p><p>Teddy laughed, the sound almost foreign to his ears. “I’m just surprised is all. No one mentioned you were coming.” And he had received an owl from Harry yesterday.</p><p>“Well I wanted it to be a surprise, didn’t I?” James asked with his trademark grin that Teddy hadn’t seen in a while. “Would it be okay if I stayed with you for a few days?” he asked, moving further into the room. Teddy knew he wouldn’t say no, so he just nodded his head, shutting the door behind them both.</p><p>Teddy stood in the front sitting room of his studio, observing James as he surveyed the space with rapt curiosity. When he’d first set up his front room, Teddy had painted the walls a calming shade of yellow with grey moldings - old habits from his days at Hogwarts never died he supposed. A plush grey rug covered the concrete floor to ground the space, and a select number of his personal works lined the walls. Comfortable olive leather chairs sat along the front wall, and a section in the back for intaking clients with an older computer atop a dark wooden desk in the corner. James took a vested interest in the machine and rushed over, dropping his bags to the floor.</p><p>“Teddy! You have a vintage iMac? What is this, a 32-inch screen?”</p><p>“Merlin, James, you act like you’ve never seen a computer before,” Teddy teased as he walked over, “but yeah, it is. I have upgraded the hardware some, and charmed the old systems to work with updated software, but I’ve mostly been experimenting to see if I can create magical portraits digitally in Photoshop. It's a bonus that she keeps all my records and bookkeeping - way simpler than doing it by hand. So how long are you in town?”</p><p>James looked up from his inspection of the machine and tossed himself into the desk chair and spun around. “I’m actually not sure at this point,” he grinned and stopped the chair to look Teddy square in the eyes, “I’m working on a story. I know that everyone expected me to keep up the Quidditch thing, especially after this last winning season, but you know how that story goes. I guess I just felt like it was finally time to follow my heart and buck the expectations of ‘what-would-Harry-Potter’s-son-do’?” He made air quotes with his hands and kicked his feet up on the table. Teddy’s eyed the movement and the legs were quickly lowered and swept under the chair with a slightly apologetic smile. </p><p>Teddy let out a soft sigh, his shoulders dropped as if the air was suddenly heavy. He’d followed James’ Quidditch career after his Hogwarts graduation when the Wynwood Dragons offered him a contract. Though a star in his own right, James had played second string for multiple positions, easily covering for different players when they were injured or out of the game. He recalled the papers proclaiming James to be the “Wonder Boy of Wynwood” more than once.  </p><p>But James had wanted to be a first string Chaser for as long as Teddy could remember. He had complained multiple times over the past year about how unfair his Captain was being to keep him covering positions he had no desire to play. James’ general open unrest with his options had made Teddy well aware of the fact that he wasn’t long for the team and it had not come as a major shock to him when it was reported that the “Wonder Boy of Wynwood” had quit to become a journalist.  </p><p>While the rest of the world wondered if James had lost his mind or suffered one too many Quidditch injuries, Teddy knew that James had always loved writing as much as Quidditch. He had been happy to see James following his other passion. The whole affair had prompted him to hand sketch a ‘Congratulations’ card and owl it off, which, in turn, had prompted James to reply by sending him a picture of it framed on the wall of his new office. The accompanying note on the back of the image had read: “to remind me ‘the coolest person in the world’ is happy for me.”</p><p>Teddy was secretly thrilled James still said things like that. Even though they were in their 20’s now. Even if it probably wasn’t exactly true.</p><p>“Do you want something to drink? Water or tea?” Teddy asked. He really needed to buy more hot chocolate - he’d used up the last of it today not knowing James was going to turn up on his doorstep. “You must still be adjusting, what with the time change and all.” London to New York was still a five hours time difference, even if traveling by portkey got you from point A to point B in record time.</p><p>“I don’t suppose it’s too much to hope you have coffee?” James asked sheepishly.  </p><p>“We can get some on the way to my flat,” Teddy replied and headed to the back of the studio where he kept a small kitchenette, complete with an instant water heater for tea and a mini fridge. Heating and cooling charms were an option, of course, but his skills with those spells made the water taste funny so Teddy avoided them. Refilling his water bottle from the sink, he called back to James, “I have one more appointment with a client today, but then we can head out. In the meantime, make yourself at home.” </p><p>He could practically feel the bright golden yellow smile that James was no doubt sending his way.</p><p>From his very first memories, Teddy always had a sense when it came to colors. When he was three and a half, he was given his first coloring book. Harry had brought it over, along with a box of crayons, and set it down on the kitchen table. Teddy had quickly grabbed for it and pulled out  a blue crayon that his young magic reached out to turn turquoise, much to the delight of Harry and the scowl of his Gran. That bit of accidental magic had resulted in a crayon that was multi tonal blue, the two waxes mixing and resettling themselves back together.  </p><p>Teddy recalled opening the book to a page with a wolf howling at the moon and beginning to draw. The lines on the page hadn't felt right in places, so he'd started making new shapes all his own and putting color wherever it had felt right, using both hands interchangeably, excitedly spreading color across the page. This had prompted his Gran to spell the book so Teddy could only color inside the existing lines, an action that left a frown on Harry’s face. If he closed his eyes Teddy could still remember that look, and how later Harry had used it when he was upset or distraught at one of his own children.</p><p>Since Gran wouldn’t let Teddy draw what he liked in the book, he’d moved onto coloring the walls of his bedroom. They had been so white and plain and boring anyway. He’d added colors, so many colors, unconsciously changing his hair to match the color in his hand and humming along to the notes only he could hear as he did so. As if each color had its own frequency. At times he had used two crayons, one in each hand, to add color even faster. Once he had finished, he’d fallen back onto the floor. Looking up at his masterpiece, he'd been happy with the colors that had mingled together to cover the boring, awful, sanitary white. </p><p>He’d lain there satisfied until his Gran had called for him down the hall. “Teddy!” He could remember her shock as she’d cracked the door open and found her perfect white walls destroyed. She’d frowned and without a thought spelled all his colors away, picking him up in her arms. “We don’t color on the walls,” she’d said with a stern look on her face, causing Teddy's hair to morph from turquoise to a mousy brown. When he’d started to cry, she had pulled him close to her chest. “Your mom would be so proud,” he’d heard her mutter as she had rubbed his back.</p><p>For his fourth birthday, his Gran had given him a special gift - a pair of white pajamas with a box of markers. “These are special markers,” he could remember her telling him. “They will let you color the fabric however you want.” Teddy had leaped into her arms and hugged her tightly, before turning his attention to his new gift. His other gifts, coloring books and brand new crayons from Harry and Ginny and a blank sketchbook and some quills and muggle paints from Hermione and Ron, had all paled in comparison to his Gran's permission to draw on something that was uniquely his to make colorful. His hair had turned a bright turquoise, as it did when he was happy, and he had started making plans right then.  </p><p>He'd been in the middle of describing his plans with youthful exuberance, in the way only a newly four year old could, when his Gran had laughed and said, "Could it at least wait until after cake?” Teddy had conceded - it was cake after all! But later, after the chocolate sugar high had long worn off, he had colored the back of the PJs with a pink and red rainbow and the brown shape of a wolf howling at the moon that he’d carefully drawn above the rainbow. Humming along he happily had made the collar and cuffs green and the rest of the boring white all kinds of wonderful colors with his new markers. He couldn’t figure out why his Gran had such a sad look on her face when she had spelled all the colors into place.</p><p>By the time he had turned five, his love for colors had evolved from simply the look and feel of the colors on the page to drawing shapes and sketching out people. Teddy had found an old photo album of his parents and had started to draw them as best he could in his sketchbook. He could remember not being very good, but had kept practicing his shapes. He'd been determined to draw until he could give his Gran a piece of art that made her eyes light up with happiness.</p><p>By seven, Teddy had begun to consider himself an artist. He could recall spending hours most days lying on the floor in his room drawing and redrawing old photos of his parents, wondering if they had been artists too. It was around this time that Teddy had realized he was more right hand dominant than left, although he still believed he did more things with his left hand than most other people did. Alongside that realization had come another that had stirred up his anxiety making him feel uncomfortable. </p><p>Unlike with his hair and the rest of his body, his hands refused to change. Nothing below the wrist on his right hand and the knuckles on his left hand would change, no matter how hard he’d tried. And he had tried. He would concentrate on changing his fingerprints, his finger shape, the color of his nails, but the only change that ever came was the ink-stains they had picked up by the time he was done drawing. It worried him, but he’d kept this part of himself hidden whenever he talked about his plans to become an artist, which he could remember talking about often to whoever would listen. For his part Harry had encouraged his godson’s ambition, while Ginny would look on slightly disappointed. Hermione and Ron would buy him the best art supplies, even if Hermione would smile apologetically at his Gran with each new delivery. His Gran would just smile and shake her head to indicate it was all a phase and Teddy would grow out of it.</p><p>But Teddy never did grow out of it.</p><p>“Oi - Teddy!” he heard James call, snapping him back to reality, "Someone's here to meet with you!"</p><p>Teddy made his way back to the front of his studio just in time to hear a woman proclaiming “...Harry Potter’s SON! Oh - my daughter will be so jealous I got to meet you, she saw you on the cover of Witch Weekly a few issues back and cut out your pictures for her wall. I think you might be her lock-screen picture too - oh, I probably shouldn’t have mentioned that. I’m just excited to meet you. I never expected to see you in New York, today must be my lucky day! Do you think we could take a selfie? Oh, my daughter will just die...” she trailed off as she turned to dig into her purse, her long bright blue robes matched her eyes and were embroidered with colorful geometric patterns and that parted to reveal the long black maxi dress she wore underneath and a princess-cut sapphire hung around her neck. She smiled, a lilac purple to Teddy, as she pulled out her phone and held it out towards James. </p><p>Teddy looked on, slightly horrified, but James just smiled and came around the desk, taking the phone from the woman. “What’s your daughter’s name?” he asked, flashing a carefree smile.</p><p>“Marie,” the woman replied, a little breathless, as she stood very close to James’ chest.</p><p>“Well, Marie,” James said staring into the phone, “I met your amazing mum today and though to capture this for you,” he smiled down at the woman pulling her into the frame, her shoulder length brown hair bobbing as he pulled her in and waved at the screen. “Nothing but the best for my biggest fans,” he gives the camera a final smile and hands the phone back to the woman, massage complete. </p><p>Moving forward, Teddy decided this was the moment to interrupt before any more harm was done, not that James seemed to be too flustered. Indeed he looked, amused? </p><p>Taking two steps further into the room he cleared his throat, “Hello Mrs. Roche, I presume? I am delighted you could meet with me today.” Teddy hoped his client didn't hate him for ruining her moment with James, but she had booked her appointment for a reason - to discuss her potential portrait order. </p><p>But then he also knew that it wasn't always top priority for everyone else, as he had been told enough times when he was still dating Victoire, “You focus too much on your art - it’s not everything. But it’s all you ever care about.” Even though years had passed, those words still played in the back of Teddy’s mind.</p><p>By the time he and Victoire had started dating, his art had become paramount in his life and thus a point of contention, in a long list of many, between them. Teddy hadn't been able to deny how much of himself was devoted to his art, but he also couldn't accept the idea that he couldn't have a relationship alongside his desire to color the world. He'd reply again and again that whoever was with him had to understand that "his little drawings" were his first love. But she would never list, and their relationship never stabilized. By the summer after his 18th birthday they had had a pretty ugly parting at one of the Potter-Weasley gatherings. Teddy felt Lily might have been more affected by the breakup than even he had. </p><p>"But- But I've seen it!" she’d cried, “I saw you marrying into the family.” Teddy had given her a hug, stroked her hair, and told her that he and Victoire just hadn’t been working out for a while. </p><p>And truly his heart hadn’t been Victoire’s anyway, he thought privately. After all, as she’d cried many times over the years, “his heart belonged to his art.”</p><p>Mrs. Roche, still slightly keyed up from the experience of meeting James, tucked her phone into her purse as James backed away. She blushed and looked at Teddy, who was at least ten years her junior.  “Please,” she insisted, holding out her right hand to shake his, “Call me Stephanie, Mr. Lupin.”  </p><p>Teddy reached out with his hand and gripped hers in what he hoped was a firm handshake.  Her nails were long, pink, and freshly manicured. A diamond of considerable size on her wedding ring caught the light as she dropped his hand and continued, “You are an incredibly difficult man to get a session with so the pleasure is all mine.”</p><p>Teddy nodded and motioned for her to have a seat. Many of his clients waited two or three months to get in for his initial consultation. These days Teddy could afford to be selective about his clients - he didn’t grant a sitting to just anyone. That was what the consultation was for: to separate those whom he wanted to have his name attached to from those he’d rather not immortalize on canvas.  </p><p>“Well, Mrs. Roche - Stephanie,” he smiled logging onto his computer and pulling up her intake form, “It says here you’re looking for portraits as graduation presents?”</p><p>“Yes, my daughter Marie is going to be graduating from Ilvermorny in the spring,” she said.  “She applied for the Magical Exchange Program and got an exclusive spot working at Beauxbatons as their Transfiguration aid. She’s been really taken with French you see, has been studying it from a young age, and she, well my husband and I, thought this would be an excellent opportunity for her to figure out her next steps towards a career.”</p><p>Teddy smiled - he held a soft spot for supportive parents.</p><p>“Anyway, with the distance I thought it would be nice to have a piece or two commissioned, one of my husband and I for her to take with her, and one of her for us. I know it’s a more old-fashioned request, but we’re, well, older-blood, Mr. Lupin, going back a few generations now. And tradition is important. My parents had my portrait commissioned before I graduated and I always thought there would come a time in my life where I would want a second one done, and your reputation precedes you.” At this point she trailed off looking up at Teddy’s face, a slightly hopeful expression lingering behind her eyes.</p><p>Teddy glanced at the notes he had from her application form on his computer. It basically told him the same story but he always liked to hear from his clients directly in their own words. He knew he would be moving forward in any case: the majority of his commissioned pieces were portraits of those near-death, whether it was simply old age or an illness. With most wizards preferring the instant nature of photography, especially with how widespread phones had become with the wizarding population, as a way to capture their likeness these days, the opportunity to paint a forty-something couple and their seventeen year old daughter held great appeal. It could be a fun project and an interesting challenge, an opportunity to expand his portrait portfolio.  </p><p>Teddy’s love of portraits had begun the moment he’d stepped into the halls of Hogwarts as an eleven year old artist. By the time his Hogwarts letter had come, he’d filled countless sketchbooks with colors, shapes, and people and had tucked away his latest, half-full sketchbook at the bottom of his school trunk, even though his Gran had encouraged him not to. He’d been going through a phase of drawing wolves and dogs, and Harry had gotten a strange, faraway look in his eyes when Teddy had shown him before boarding the Hogwarts Express. </p><p>At Hogwarts, Teddy might have had concerns about being sorted into Hufflepuff. He might have had concerns about making friends or doing well in his classes. But mostly Teddy had concerns about the Hogwarts portraits. They were everywhere, all over the school, and they fascinated him. He had grown up with moving photographs but this was a new thing entirely.  </p><p>Teddy knew that the Blacks had moving portraits but couldn’t really remember seeing one growing up as Harry and Ginny had long ago scrubbed Walburga Black off the wall at Grimmauld Place, so Teddy would spend hours sitting in the halls and corridors of Hogwarts asking them questions and redrawing them in his sketchbook. He would ask them all kinds of things like “did they remember getting painted?” and “what did being a portrait feel like?” More often than not, they had no good answers for him about the magic behind their creation, especially the non-human subjects.</p><p>At some point, Teddy realized, his life had become a never-ending quest to uncover the magic of portraits.</p><p>His gaze moved back to Stephanie but not before catching James in the corner looking at him with something unreadable that Teddy briefly wondered might be encouragement.</p><p>“How about I do you one better?” he ventured. “How about if I create two linked portraits, that way all three of you could move back and forth between them anytime your likenesses desire?” He felt his own excitement building as he offered, watching the woman’s face light up.</p><p>“Oh! That sounds wonderful, Mr. Lupin! I hadn’t even considered it a possibility.”</p><p>“Well it certainly is,” Teddy chuckled, feeling James’ golden smile from the corner of the room.  He wasn’t used to having people sit in on these consults and watching him work, and James was proving to be a good distraction. He refocused and continued.</p><p>“If you would like to proceed, I'll need the three of you to all come in collectively for the first and last of the three sessions. For the portrait sittings your daughter can come separately if she chooses. All the sessions can be booked on my WizNet site or through owl if you’d prefer. Most of my clients are on WizNet now but I still like to offer the option. The first session will be for color matching and paint assessment: I will collect the samples I need and have the paint custom mixed with the appropriate spells. The second session will be the longest of the three; you will sit for the portrait being created. I try to make this as painless as possible but,” he waved his hands, “these things take some time. The third session will be the final spells for memory transfer and integration as well as the portrait linking spells. Do I have your permission to take some creative liberties with the backgrounds or were you looking for something more traditional?”</p><p>Stephanie turned around to glance at James who shot her a fast, winning smile. Teddy felt like he might melt into the floor. He was not trying to show off but James had that effect on him sometimes. The moment was brief, however, and quickly Stephanie was looking right back at Teddy. “Whatever you think will work best,” she said folding her hands in her lap.</p><p>“There is the final matter of payment,” Teddy informed her. He’d never been a fan of this part of the process but he knew his skills were worth the cost. Reaching down he opened a file drawer, pulling out a piece of pre-printed parchment that outlined his contract and a Seal-the-Deal Quill to mark his fees down on the appropriate lines.</p><p>“Many of my clients prefer to pay out over each session, and if that’s your preference as well we can come up with an installment plan rather than paying all up front in one sum. The total for all the sessions is listed in both Dragot and Galleons just - here.” He paused and passed the parchment over to Stephanie who took it with a nod. “Payment will be due at the first session along with this contract. I look forward to seeing you and meeting your family.” Smiling warmly, Teddy stood up and held out his hand.</p><p>Stephanie rose to her feet as well and reached out to shake it. “Thank you Mr. Lupin.”</p><p>“Please, it’s Teddy,” he implored, walking around the desk to escort her out of his studio. She didn't follow and, instead, sidestepped over to James.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, thank you so much for your time earlier,” she said as she held out her hand to him, “My daughter-”</p><p>“I hope it makes her happy,” James smoothly interrupted, ignoring Stephanie’s outstretched hand and instead reaching around her to wrap her in a slightly awkward hug. He whispered something in her ear that made her giggle like a schoolgirl and look over at Teddy with renewed reverence.</p><p>That particular look of James’ was known by the entire Potter-Weasley clan as specifically just for Teddy. When they were both much younger, James would sit and watch Teddy for hours at family gatherings while he drew in the corner. Young James had long ago declared Teddy to be the “coolest person ever” and the boy’s face would light up at Teddy’s shapes and colors. Teddy would find himself with bright turquoise hair, unconsciously humming the frequency of each shape to his audience of one. Ginny, often with a look of awe, had commented on many occasions about how in Teddy’s presence, James would settle down with the most serene of expressions. Once, when Ginny had told Harry about her observations, Harry had just smiled and said that Remus had had a similar effect on him.</p><p>That look of James’ had been like a dose of pure confidence, like a painter's Pepper-Up potion. There had never been any doubt when it came to how James saw him - Teddy could tell that he had always been an artist in James’ eyes. That had been the dominant thought in his mind as he had made the decision to seek an apprenticeship with a Wizarding artist. He’d taken the best of his work and had compiled it meticulously, selecting the pieces he’d felt had the most movement and showcased the best range. He’d known others envied him for the future that was expected of him - he’d been scouted for Quidditch and as Head Boy he’d have a good shot at any regular job he could want. But neither of those had felt quite like the future that he had wanted for himself and so in the back of his mind the anxiety had remained. </p><p>And so when Teddy had found himself on a rare sunny day in March up in the owlery ready to mail off his works to several Wizarding artists he’d come across on WizNet, it had felt like fate that James had found him there. Teddy had considered sending digital files rather than making physical copies, but he had wanted to stand out and figured that mailing a physical portfolio with a handwritten cover letter would produce better results. He had just sent off his first application and was preparing his second when James had wandered into the owlery, sliding up alongside him, his own letter sealed in his hand, he had prodded Teddy with his elbow. “Whatcha doing?” he’d asked, eyeing the stack of papers on the table.  </p><p>Teddy hadn’t replied right away and so James had budged over to look at his stack of multiple portfolios, the top piece depicting the Shrieking Shack glowing eerily beneath the full moon with the Whomping Willow in the foreground. Even back then it had been an older piece of Teddy’s but one he had been happy to lead with. The movement of the tree and the monochromatic blues had spoken to him in a melancholy sort of way. He’d looked up to see James staring at him, his normally golden smile dulled slightly. He’d reached out and patted Teddy’s arm before putting the piece down and pulling him into a hug. “Your work is amazing,” he’d whispered, “they’d be stupid not to take you.” Teddy had quietly filed those words away in his heart. Later, after he had received three letters of acceptance back, he'd contemplated his next step carefully. He’d considered sharing the options with James but hadn’t wanted to bother the first year - he’d had adult decisions to make and an artist to reply to.</p><p>Teddy walked over to James as the studio door closed behind Stephanie. “Sorry about that. You didn’t have to stay for that. I’m sure it was really boring,” he said, hoping to avoid any discussion over the uncomfortable display that had happened between him and Stephanie. “If I had thought about it, I could have Apparated you to my flat or something.”</p><p>James shrugged, waving him off, “Oh, c’mon Teddy, you know I have always liked to watch you work.” The smile he gave was his brightest yet.</p><p>Later, Teddy decided, he really needed to ask what was going on with James.</p><p>
