    <p>Tina is half awake when something catches her eye. A shadow against the background of the tent. The sun had not risen yet, so the tired Auror decided it was a trick of the light. Closing her eyes and snuggling closer to Newt, she lets sleep claim her again. That is until the tent becomes unnaturally hot, in an almost smothering way. It is enough to wake her again, and instinctually check around their tent.</p><p>The blood in her veins goes cold. A distinct black fog floats on the ground, inching closer to them. Unmistakably one creature- Lethifold.</p><p>Only sparing a moment in pushing Newt behind her, Tina moves to sit up in the bed, shielding him and aiming her wand at the dark cloak trying its best to surround and consume them. Getting unnervingly close to their sleeping cot.</p><p>She has never produced a corporeal Patronus before. Thankfully, she never needed to use it until now.</p><p>It takes a moment, with the heat of the Lethifold making sweat dripped down her back. Where Newt is pressed against it. But she finds the moment, the one memory that she can recall being the happiest. Allowing that joy to overtake her body now, bringing a smile on her face despite the danger she is in. Bringing forth the wonderful, warm, and lovely feelings of that moment to give her the power now.</p><p>“<em>Expecto Patronum!<em>” She yells.</em></em></p><p>A white light comes from her wand, then it gets increasingly brighter. So intense that Tina has to squint in order to see. Though the slits though she makes it out, the brilliant glow forming into something more than a blur of white. Slowly the shape of a Thunderbird takes shape as it charges the lethifold with fluid movement s of its wings.</p><p>

  <em>When familiar apartment comes into view, Tina picks up her pace excitedly. Eager to be so close to what had grown to feel like home.&lt;/em&gt; </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Returning to New York had been made her feel even more alone then she was prepared for. It was not a surprise, considering she had no sister there. The people who cared for and surrounded her for the last several months being across an ocean. One freckled, red-haired magizoologist in particular. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Almost as soon as she was in New York, Tina wanted to return to London. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> So she had spent the last few weeks doing what needed to be done. Packed her things, after realizing Queenie had already come to take her own belongings. Squaring her debt to Ms. Espisito. Putting in her resignation letter in and her transfer papers to the Ministry. Theseus had been persistent in her always having a place on his team. Which she would gladly take him up on when returning. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> On the final day, with her last paperwork approved, Tina had left through a portkey to London as early as it opened. Back to London, to Newt, a better opportunity to do good with her work. Now so close, Tina can’t stop the grin breaking across her face.</em>
