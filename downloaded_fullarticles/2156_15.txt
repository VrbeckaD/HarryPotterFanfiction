    <p>~ Prologue~</p>
<p>Two girls sit outside on the steps of a home, they are young, around ten years old. One girl has long brown hair and brown eyes with the other having shoulder length hair and blonde hair. The brown-haired girls name is Amelia Mercado, she lives with her parents and her younger sister named LeAnn Mercado. The blonde girl of the other hand, is named Kiara Spicer, she lives with her mother and her older brother, Finnegan Spicer. The girls have been sitting on the steps for about an hour, they’ve been silent the entire time and anxiously looking at the sky.</p>
<p>“How much longer to do you think it’ll be” Amelia asked glancing over at Kiara</p>
<p>“I don’t know, my mum said that it could come at any time” Kiara said glumly</p>
<p>The two girls silently groaned and then continued to silently sit on the steps, until the heard a door behind them open. The two girls turned around to see a boy around the age of eleven. The boy was wearing blue jeans and a Gryffindor crest t-shirt.</p>
<p>“Ki come inside, mum has made lunch” the boy said, looking at Kiara</p>
<p>“Got it Finn!” Kiara yelled out to him, but he just nodded at walked back inside the house</p>
<p>“Do you want to eat with us Mils?” Kiara asked, but Amelia shook her head</p>
<p>“Mum said that dad is coming back from his auror mission today around this time” Amelia explained to her</p>
<p>“okay, then I’ll see you after lunch” Kiara said<br/>
-----<br/>
They both stood up and gave each other a hug. Kiara walked into the opened door behind her that Finnegan walked into while Amelia walked next door to her house.</p>
<p>Kiara walked into her house and into the kitchen. When she walked in, her mother, Raine Spicer and her brother Finnegan had already started to eat lunch and her plate placed at the table.</p>
<p>“Has your letter arrived yet dear?” Raine asked Kiara</p>
<p>“Not yet” Kiara grumbled, sitting in front of her plate</p>
<p>“maybe you’re not a wizard after all” Raine jokes, but it just made Kiara feel even worse</p>
<p>Noticing the sad expression on Kiara’s face, Finnegan sighed, making Kiara glance over at him.</p>
<p>“I haven’t gotten my letter yet so I’m sure the letters haven’t been sent out yet” Finnegan said to her</p>
<p>“Yes dear, I was only joking, the letters will arrive soon” Raine said, placing her hand on Kiara’s shoulder</p>
<p>“don’t worry mum I know” Kiara says, giving her a slight smile</p>
<p>After the exchange, the three sat in silence. As she ate, her mind began to wander about what her Hogwarts life would be like. What house would she be in? Gryffindor like her mother and brother or maybe she’d be in a different house. The thought of different houses made her think of her father, she has never met her father so she definitely never knew his house. Her mind began to fill with thoughts about her father.</p>
<p>Before she could dive into more of her imagination, she heard the sounds of an owl outside. She quickly jumped up from her seat and opened the front door.<br/>
--------</p>
<p>Amelia raced back to her house and rushed into the front door. She ran into the kitchen to see her mother, Sloane Mercado, making lunch as LeAnn was sitting at the table waiting for Sloane to finish cooking.</p>
<p>“Is he back yet?!” Amelia excitingly asked her mum</p>
<p>Sloane looked over from the pot to look at Amelia and gave her a sad smile.</p>
<p>“He is still out darling, but I’m sure he’ll be back very soon” Sloane explained to her daughter</p>
<p>Disappointed, Amelia took a seat next to her sister and laid her head on the table and gave a long sigh.</p>
<p>“Mum said that he’d be back soon no need to be upset” LeAnn complained</p>
<p>Amelia took her head off the table and glared at her sister. LeAnn was a year younger than her and a total brat. Like Amelia, she had brown hair and brown eyes. Seeing Amelia’s glare, she glared back, forcing them into an all-out glaring war. Before they could declare a winner, two plates of food were placed in front of them.</p>
<p>“Come on girls, you can continue you glare off later, now eat your lunch” Sloane told the girls</p>
<p>The girls obliged and began to chow down on their food like it would get up and run away. Seeing this, Sloane gave a quiet sigh, but smiled and began to eat her lunch. The girls ate in silence till the sound of footsteps could be heard walking towards the kitchen. LeAnn and Amelia lifted their heads from their plates to see their father, Nikolas Mercado, standing at the doorway of the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Dad!” LeAnn and Amelia yelled at the same time and ran up to him and attacking him from a hug on each side</p>
<p>“Girls, girls” Nikolas laughed at them and rubbed the tops of their heads, messing up their hairs</p>
<p>Before anyone could say anyone else, Amelia suddenly heard the sound of an owl and paper being dropped. She suddenly leaped out of her father’s arms and traced out the kitchen and opened the front door.<br/>
------<br/>
Kiara opened the door and what she saw made her heart stop. On the front door mat was two letters, two Hogwarts letters. Kiara quickly grabbed the letters and raced back to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“They’re here!” Kiara yelled once she made it back to the kitchen</p>
<p>“no need to yell” Finnegan mumbled and grabbed his letter out of her hand</p>
<p>“that’s great sweetie” Raine said, taking the three plates they had been eating and taking them to the sink</p>
<p>Kiara glanced at her letter, and examined it closely. She looked at her name and address written in ink. She was about to open the letter till she remembered something.</p>
<p>“I got to go open this with Amelia!” Kiara said and raced back out the kitchen door, not waiting for an answer from her mum</p>
<p>Amelia opened the front door to see a Hogwarts letter on the front door mat. She quickly grabbed it and turned around to see the rest of the family standing behind her.</p>
<p>“It’s my Hogwarts letter!” Amelia said excitingly, showing off the letter to the rest of her family</p>
<p>Sloane and Nikolas engulfed Amelia in a big hug and congratulated her. Sloane gestured for LeAnn to join the hug, to which she rolled her eyes and slowly walked over and joined in. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Amelia escaped the hug to see Kiara with her Hogwarts letter as well.</p>
<p>“Did you get your letter too?!” Kiara excitingly asked</p>
<p>“yep” Amelia said smiling, showing off her letter to her</p>
<p>“Quick let’s open them” Kiara said, grabbing Amelia’s hand and dragged her into her living room</p>
<p>The living room was very quaint; the room had one big sofa, a love seat, a big fireplace, a coffee table, and various flowers and plants everywhere. Kiara and Amelia sat together on the sofa and ripped opened their letters.</p>

<p>Amelia, finishing reading the letter, placed the letter silently in her lap. Amelia looked over to see Kiara had placed her letter in her lap as well. The girls then heard the sound of footsteps. They looked up and saw that their parents, LeAnn, and Finnegan were all staring at them.</p>
<p>“So is it everything you hoped for?” Finnegan asked the girls</p>
<p>Kiara and Amelia looked at each other, like they were communicating telepathically. Almost simultaneously, Kiara and Amelia looked back at Finnegan with huge smiles on their faces.</p>
