    <p>He’s not always kind.</p><p>When he comes in it’s always a shock – he’s always right <em>there</em>, barely uses the door – but I know that he puts away his coat – cloak. His cloak. It gives me a few seconds but I don’t know where to look. I grab what hold I can on the leather straps and pull myself upright. I feel my blood pulsing along the scars on my right hand, all the way from where my fingers are now clawing.</p><p>But he’s not Ma. He must see that I’m contrite, that I’m worth to be forgiven. He must see it, I know he will.</p><p>I cannot breathe.</p><p>I tried not to chafe, not to fight him. He’s right, he must be right o God he’s here.</p><p>I stare at his shoes. Nice shoes, I’d polish them if he’d let me. Dragon skin. I straighten up, wait for his footsteps, eyes away.</p><p>He’s not coming in.</p><p>No, no, no, it’s been all day, I’ve been so good, and it hurts, Mr., please, it hurts. My eyes flit up and he’s already turning back and he can’t Mr., please, don’t leave me.</p><p>His mouth twists.</p><p>I feel myself sag.</p><p>Mr., please, I didn’t mean to –</p><p>He pulls the door shut.</p><p>I want to die.</p><p><em>Hush, </em>he said. <em>Don’t cry</em>, he said. I won’t, for him. Ma said the same, but she wanted me to, kept hitting until she saw tears. <em>Weakling,</em> she said. <em>Crybaby. </em></p><p>Chastity loved it.</p><p>But he is here now and he won’t come in and I’m trembling so bad it feels like the room is shaking but I will not cry and suddenly there’s cursing and running footsteps and the door bursts open and he yells something (<em>Finite?) </em>and everything stops.</p><p>Now he does walk toward me, and I want to crawl away, but it hurts so good when he grabs my neck that I feel myself harden. “You do that again,” he whispers, “and I’ll Petrify you. That means you cannot even blink, have I made that fucking clear?”</p><p>I look up at him. “Y…yes, Mr. Graves.”</p><p>“MACUSA would have you liquefied within the hour for that stunt,  do you understand?”</p><p>I don’t understand a word of that, but I decide to nod. “Yes, Mr. Graves.” I look down. “I am sorry.”</p><p>“Then be quiet.”  </p><p>And he lets go and I <em>can’t</em> and</p><p>“No, please, I’ll be good, please, Mr. Graves, I-”</p><p>The rest of my words choke into nothingness, but he stays and he smiles and his hand’s on my face and another’s on my crotch and his breath’s on my ear and: “You can’t be good yet, Credence. Patience.”</p><p> I…</p><p>I think I’ve come.</p><p>And he stills and he laughs and he grabs my ass and he turns and he <em>goes </em>and I sob in his silence.</p><p>‘Patience, Credence’...</p><p>I have hope.</p>
