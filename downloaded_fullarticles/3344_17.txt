    <p>“Who wants pop tarts for breakfast?”  “ME ME ME!!!!!” squeals a small boy, who jumps up and down on the landing, wearing is favourite dinosaur pyjamas. “better hurry ‘cause I’m really hungry. I might eat them all!” Calls a sing song voice</p>
<p>“Uh oh…they’re in the toaster…..mmmm smells good!” “NO! Daddy no! I want pop tarts too!” the little blonde boy bolts down the stairs and into the kitchen. “Leave some for me Papa, you pig! He giggles </p>
<p>Draco lifts his son up onto the counter “I call chocolate!” grins a 5 year old Scorpius <br/>“Damn you, you little toad! Fine I’ll have the strawberry jam.’ Giggles the little blonde boy.</p>
<p>				******************</p>
<p>“Ah, those were the days” sighs Draco, talking to himself as he cooked up pop tarts while a banging and crashing could be heard from upstairs. It was the 31st of August, and Scorpius was packing his trunk for his first year at Hogwarts. He had received his letter no too long ago. Both father and son were excited and happy. <br/>Finally! He was going to Hogwarts, like Draco had, like his beloved wife Daphne had, and his father and mother before him… and now his little dragon (no wait he’s not 5 anymore. He’s ‘Scorps’ now). </p>
<p>“You ate all the pop tarts dad? You’re a pig” “Hey I left you some, you hungry git” they both laughed. “I still can’t believe you’re off tomorrow “Draco smiles “I know! I Know! Isn’t it awesome?.” Yeah, Draco thought. It was. Gods know how much things will have change since…. The Second wave of the Dark Days.</p>
<p>The two had already been to the wonderful cobbled streets of Diagon Alley, with it’s bright coloured window displays, the little shops, Madame Malkin’s, where he had first met that annoying Potter, the familiars menagerie, Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, The Ice cream parlour… It all came flooding back to him. All those great memories, now he could share with his son. </p>
<p>Draco smiled, watching is son scoffing down his breakfast. “Gotta go check my-“ “Your trunk will still there for the rest of the day . Calm down!” “But…” “Sit down and eat like a human, not a troll.” Scorpius heaves a big sigh. The boy now sat at the table, using his hands to munch on the tart, still slurping his pineapple juice. “That’s more like it!”</p>
<p>31st of August went quickly, a lot of dashing about the apartment. The two lived in a cozy yet lux apartment in London. It was just the two of them now.</p>
<p>It had been a long and difficult transition into the muggle world after the War on Hogwarts. The name Malfoy was tarnished, His guilt driven father, Lucius, had spent time in the newly rebuilt Azkaban prison after finally coming to his senses and turning himself in. Narcissa, Draco’s mother came to visit as much as possible, Draco often in tow. To see his once proud and arrogant man become a shell of his old self, it was heartbreaking, even though his father was horrible and manipulative, he was still his father, still the same blood that runs through his veins. Since this sentence, Draco had become more compassionate toward his father, now free from prison and back at home with Narcissa. Draco had left home once he felt things were stable with his parents, and moved out into the new world. He’d got back in touch with some of the students he went to school with. He’d married Astoria Greengrass, not because of status, he married for love. </p>
<p>But love can be cruel. Astoria had a curse put on her family way back when the wizarding world was ruled by Voldemort. She was frail and sickly, yet they had a son together, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. A beautiful healthy baby boy. It wasn’t long after, one year to be exact, that the curse ended in taking dear Astoria’s life, leaving a broken hearted Draco and his tiny toddler Scorpius, or as his parents called him, little dragon. The two now had taken up residence in London, still in contact with his family and Astoria’s as well.</p>
<p>Now comfortable with his new life, he was dogged with memories. Some were of smiles and good times, but the worst memories kept rearing their ugly heads, more so now that his son was going away, leaving him alone. How do people deal with it? Not seeing their loved ones for weeks on end, hoping to what ever god (if any) that their daughters and sons would be would he make able to handle a whole new life in a place they’d never been to. Would Scorpius be okay? Would he be safe? Bullied by students over those horrid rumours (Totally untrue.)</p>
