  <span>“Just think about it Harry. I mean Ginny will most likely be staying at home because she hasn’t had the best time carrying your spog- it would just be you, James, and most likely Teddy this year. Has Ginny even said anything about costumes for him yet?” Ron attempted to argue his point at Harry over a Butterbeer at the Leaky Cauldron after their most recent Auror shift.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re right Ron, she’s had an awful time this go round- it would be James and I and maybe Teddy if I can convince Andy to let me take him on a school night. We haven’t discussed costumes because I know she wanted to make one but it might just be best to buy one this year…” Harry was deep in thought as he took a contemplative sip from his bottle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just think about it; leather pants and jacket, draw on a goatee, we can always Charm his eyes a different color and I’m sure there is a potion Hermione could make to grow out his hair. It would be perfect!” Ron threw his hands up in the air then crossed them over his chest. He couldn’t see any better option than for his sister’s oldest child to be dressed as his namesake to goTrick-or-Treating around Grimmauld Place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could always incorporate both sides of him into the costume, buy a dog ear headband and a fluffy black tail… You’re right! It would be perfect! I gotta go see Ginny to make sure she’s okay with it- but I don’t see why she wouldn’t go along with it.” Harry threw some Galleons on the table as he drained the last remnants of liquid from the bottle hoping against all hope, despite his assurances to Ron, that his wife would allow him to dress their son up like this.</span>

  <span>“Oh, isn’t he just precious!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll be quite the catch when you get older young man.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>

  </span>
  <span>“His costume is adorable!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The adults giving out candy said much of the same, time and time again, as they knocked on the doors around Grimmauld Place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His little boy was dressed in black jeans that were frayed at the knees, a Queen shirt, with a black leather jacket over him to block out most of the chilly autumn air. The final  touches to the ensemble included black dog ears on his head attached to a headband that was covered by his shaggy black hair, though if the ears moved the Muggles would just assume they ran on batteries; a black tail attached to the back belt loop on his pants, and a small black goatee that was painted on by his mum, Ginny. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Most of the Muggles would assume that little James Sirius was dressed from the 70s or 80s era, but to those that knew- all he could be was the one and only- Sirius Black…</span>
