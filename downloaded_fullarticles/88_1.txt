    <p>Her feet drag beneath her, weighing her down into the damp earth. She’s exhausted, but she knows she has to keep going. The forest would come to an end soon, the world erupting into a large field, open and exposed. Hermione Granger knew the Forest of Dean well... But not well enough to know it’s hiding places. </p><p>It had been months that she had been hiding. In fact, it had almost been a year. A year since the war had ended in sadness and heartbreak. It was true--Harry Potter was dead and gone. So was Ronald. And most of her friends. As far as she knew, everyone from before was dead. However, she couldn’t dwell on the past. She had very little time left before she was captured. But she had a plan--fight. Fight them hard. </p><p>She raced through the flora, dodging outreaching branches and hopping over the large roots of old trees. Sunset had fallen upon the forest, the last light of the day that the girl was chasing. Stopping for a quick break, she summoned water into a stainless steel bottle, her wand swirling around the metal. As she drank, she crouched to the ground, staying as low and as hidden as possible. It wouldn’t be long before they found her; this she knew. </p><p>Standing once again, she wiped off her sweating palms and gripped her wand tighter. Suddenly, a voice stopped her. </p><p>“Don’t move.” </p><p>Holding up her hands, she instantly felt the pit in her stomach. Then, she felt a fist dive into it. Hunched over, she nearly lost her last meal. </p><p>“Please,” she whispered, turning about to face them. She came face to face with someone she hadn’t seen in quite some time. Her stomach turned over, an icy chill tracing down her spine. Antonin Dolohov. He gave her a wide smile and extended his wand towards her. </p><p>“Expelliarmus!” She cried, a vibrant blue light shooting out from the tip of her wand. Dolohov flew backwards, his wand cascading upwards. Hermione took off, running faster than she had in her entire life. Her foot caught the spindly root of a tree and she came crashing down to the ground. Then, she was dragged. He had grabbed a hold of her ankles and pulled her along the rough, muddy surface. </p><p>“Dolohov!” She screamed, thrashing about. “Let me go!” </p><p>“Silence!” He shouted, flipping her onto her back. His wand was pointed at her, directly at the center of her forehead. </p><p>That was the last thing she remembered.</p>
