    <p>Edward kicked the Flame Alchemist's door open, not bothering to knock. He stomped to Mustang's desk where the man waited. It seemed that every step he took, the towering stack of paperwork on the Colonel's desk trembled. Edward slammed the envelope in his hand on the desk.</p><p>"Try not to destroy my furniture, Fullmetal."</p><p>"Shut up, Mustang! What's the meaning of this?" Edward continued in a mocking voice. "Dear Mister Elric, You are to teach Alchemy at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry don't kid me, I know shit mail when I see it!"</p><p>"The Fuhrer has requested you to teach there, Edward. On behalf of the headmaster, named-" Mustang glanced at a paper in front of him, just one of many on his desk. "Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. What a mouthful."</p><p>Ed gritted his teeth. "The Fuhrer has requested me, specifically?"</p><p>"That's right." The hidden message was obvious in Mustang's eyes. The Fuhrer, or rather the Homunculus wanted Ed out of the picture. If Ed has calculated correctly, the Promised Day was ten months away. A goddamned school year was nine months, putting Edward out of commission until the last month.</p><p>They were stuck. Mustang was being watched just as much Edward was.</p><p>"I'm bringing Alphonse with me."</p><p>"I'm afraid you can't do that, Fullmetal."</p><p>"Why the hell not?!"</p><p>Roy Mustang tapped the envelope. "You are to go alone, although I'll see what I can do. Remember, you're teaching at a school for magic. You can take this opportunity to go through their library. It may give you some clues about the Homunculus. Hell, it may even have something to do with Alchemy."</p><p>"Alchemy hasn't been in England for what, almost a hundred years! It's going to be like teaching idiots!"</p><p>"Your students will range from ages eleven to eighteen, and you have full authority as Professor Elric."</p><p>Edward paused, musing with an evil grin on his face. "I go to his school of magic, I hold power over those older than me, I can check out their library....I'll go, Mustang."</p><p>"Wait. I need to brief you on London's...status."</p><p>"Spit it out, Colonel!"</p><p>"Their country has...an enemy, who just happens to be a wizard with dark magic. There are many precautions put in place to protect London from being attacked. One is called the Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore will update you on it later."</p><p>"What?! I have to teach Alchemy, and protect Hogwarts? Bad joke, Mustang."</p><p>"We could always court-martial you for disobeying direct orders from the Fuhrer."</p><p>"That's an even worse joke."</p><p>"That's not all. You are to protect a Mister Harry Potter if the scenario arises. Before you explode, let me explain. This Harry, so he's called, has been in contact with the Dark wizard I mentioned earlier. Many authority figures want to keep a close watch on him."</p><p>"The hell? I have to teach, fight, and babysit?!"</p><p>"Not at the same time."</p><p>"<em>Argh</em>!"</p><p>So the Fuhrer is hoping I'm going to be killed in London, so I can't fight on the Promised Day?</p><p>"Another thing. In London, they speak English. I don't suppose you've brushed up on it?"</p><p>"Damn you, Mustang!"</p><p>"I expect biweekly to monthly reports, Elric. Make them detailed."</p><p>Edward rubbed his face. "Why me?"</p><p>"More complaining and I suspect Major Armstrong or I may have to accompany you."</p><p>"...I'll get packing."</p><p>Edward's swears echoed down the hallways of Central.</p><p>---</p><p>"Stupid Mustang!"</p><p>Edward angrily threw another pair of pants into his travel bag.</p><p>Alphonse took the rumpled pants out, carefully folding them, then putting it back in the bag with a pat. "Now, brother, look on the bright side of things. You're going to a school that teaches magic! Plus, you could make more friends-"</p><p>"Don't need friends" Ed groused as he rifled through one of the many books in his room. "I'm thinking...Al, what books should I bring with me? Imagine the people I'm teaching these to are complete idiots."</p><p>"Don't be mean, Ed. They're what, eleven? You should go easy on them-"</p><p>Ed dumped six books in the bag. "Whatever. Now, those books are for the basics, I should get some more...."</p><p>Alphonse tidied up the books, making sure none of them were scuffed. "You'll write to me, right?" He asked in a hopeful voice. Ed patted Alphonse's shoulder, the highest part he could reach without climbing.</p><p>"Don't worry, Alphonse. I'll write to you as fast as I can." He lowered his voice. "This school is made of magic and teaches magic, yes? I'm going to take a look at their library-see if I can find anything related to the Philosopher's stone. Maybe we'll even find a way to defeat that creepy Father Homunculus."</p><p>"Be careful, brother."</p><p>"Sure, sure."</p><p>"Ed?"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"How do you say 'hello' in English?"</p><p>"...I don't know."</p><p>"Better start studying."</p><p>"Please don't remind me."</p><p>"Oh, I almost forgot. You should bring your uniform, too."</p><p>"I'm not wearing that piece of crap!"</p><p>"Now, I'm sure there are a few formal events there, right? You want to look your best..."</p><p>"Alphonse!"</p><p>---</p><p>Edward glanced at his silver pocket watch. He was waiting just outside of Central. He actually didn't bring much essentials with him, most of the space in his bags were filled with books.</p><p>
  <em>Dumble-whatever his name is late. </em>
</p><p>And it's damp. Indeed, it had rained the night before. The air was moist and the grass was wet.</p><p>
  <em>Makes my joints feel weird. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Maybe I should have gone to Winry's before going to London.</em>
</p><p>A hand tapped him on the shoulder. "Are you Edward Elric?"</p><p>Edward froze. He hadn't heard any footsteps. How did he get behind him? Warily, Edward turned around. In front of him was an old wizard, with a long beard, longer than any Edward had ever seen. He wore dark blue robes and half-moon spectacles. He fit the label of <em>wizard</em>, all right.</p><p>Old fart looks like he just woke up and tied a bathrobe around himself.</p><p>"Dumble-dumblee-Dumbledore?"</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. "Yes, that's my name." At Edward's blank stare Dumbledore said "Can you understand me?"</p><p>"Not much." Edward's own English was rather harsh and garbled.</p><p>"Allow me." Dumbledore took out his wand, muttering a spell.</p><p>"There, how do you feel?"</p><p>"I feel completely normal, what do you-" Edward gasped. He was speaking perfect English, with barely an accent. "You can do that? With magic?"</p><p>"Yes, we can. The spell is only temporary, so I still recommend you study English." It was only then that Dumbledore decided to study Edward's face.</p><p>"Are golden eyes and hair popular in Amestris?"</p><p>Edward started. "Hm? Oh, um, not really, some people have blond hair but I don't think there are many people with golden eyes."</p><p>"Did you inherit them from your father?"</p><p>Edward's mouth turned downwards. "My bastard father doesn't have anything to do with this. What are you playing at?"</p><p>---</p><p>
  <em>Ninety-something years ago, Hogwarts Castle</em>
</p><p>Dumbledore watched as Van Hohenheim packed up all his belongings. Even though the man had taught at Hogwarts for almost a decade, Hohenheim had few possessions.</p><p>"Leaving so soon? I thought you'd stay for a little longer."</p><p>Hohenheim smiled. "I've stayed here long enough, Albus. Armando has already approved."</p><p>Albus chuckled. "Without you, who will reign me in when I go for drinks?"</p><p>Hohenheim said dryly, "I'm pretty sure it was you who reigned me in."</p><p>"Sad that both of us never managed to get a lady."</p><p>The blond-haired man sighed regretfully. "Eh, there's always time in the future. Don't fret too hard on these things, Albus."</p><p>Albus patted the forty-something year old on the shoulder. "You're only a few years older than me, Hohenheim, but you talk like an old man."</p><p>Hohenheim huffed. "Wait till you get your first grey hair, Albus. I'll be the one laughing then."</p><p>Albus chuckled. "We'll miss you, Heim. You taught the students well. They'll miss you even more than me."</p><p>Van Hohenheim put on his coat. Strangely enough, during Hohenheim's time teaching, he rarely donned the normal robes that most professors wore, but preferred the tailored suits that he always wore. Albus had never seen him out of a muggle dress shirt and tie.</p><p>"I learned all I needed to in this place, Albus. Keep it safe, alright?"</p><p>Albus hefted Hohenheim's bag. "Yeah, yeah. I'm staying here, Heim. Hogwarts is my home, always has been, always will. I'll wait for you if you decide to come back."</p><p>The two friends walked down the old pathway. "I'll apparate you to the train station."</p><p>"That would be much appreciated."</p><p>
  <em>Waiting for the train, at King's Cross.</em>
</p><p>Albus stared in wonder at the train across from their station. "I never did get over my curiosity of trains. Very smart of muggles. Are you sure you'll be fine?"</p><p>"Yes, I will. Don't worry about me, Albus. I am a muggle, after all."</p><p>Albus stared at Van Hohenheim. After nine years of teaching alongside him, he still didn't believe Hohenheim was entirely a muggle. Alchemy could be learned by anyone, but there had been certain...events that led him to believe Hohenheim was more than human or wizard. He claimed he was forty-six, but the haunted look in his eyes suggested otherwise.</p><p>"Send me some letters, will you?"</p><p>The two men shook hands.</p><p>"Bye, Hohenheim. Maybe I'll visit you in Amestris."</p><p>"Maybe, maybe. Well then, good luck with you, Albus."</p><p>"Farewell, Hohenheim."</p><p>---</p><p>
  <em>Present</em>
</p><p>Dumbledore waved a hand. "Nothing, nothing. Just an old man's thoughts. Now, we better get going."</p><p>Edward looked around, expecting a carriage to appear. "Where?"</p><p>The old man chuckled. "I forgot you do not know what apparation is. Please hang on to my arm."</p><p>Edward suspiciously clutched Dumbledore with his left hand.</p><p>And they disappeared.</p><p>The two reappeared, in front of a building. The first thing Edward did was let go of Dumbledore and breathe in deeply, hands on his knees. He felt horrible.</p><p>The hell was that? One second we were standing in Amestris in Central, then there was darkness and then-</p><p>Ed looked up. They were in front of multiple large buildings, in fact. He glanced down the streets, where lights flickered on on lamposts that looked so very different from Central's.</p><p>"Where <em>are</em> we?" Edward managed to slur out, amid his dizzy mind.</p><p>"Sorry about the apparation. It's always the hardest at first. We are, to put it simply, at our destination." Dumbledore handed a slip of paper to Edward, thin and slanted handwriting on it.</p><p>Shit, I forgot I had to learn how to read and write in English.</p><p>"Oh, yes." Dumbledore waved his wand again, and the words on the slip of paper translated into Amestrian. "There you go, Mr. Elric."</p><p>The paper read, <em>The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. </em></p><p>"After you memorize, destroy it in whatever way you wish."</p><p>Edward looked up from the piece of paper. "So we're at number twelve-" he frowned. "There's a mistake. The two buildings here are labelled eleven and thirteen."</p><p>"That's where magic comes in, Edward.</p><p>Immediately buildings eleven and thirteen moved to the side, and it was as if another building sprung up, with the number twelve on the front.</p><p>Edward's mind spun. "Wha-what-" he stammered. "No, there's the Equivalent Exchange, there must have been brick underneath the ground, and you...transmuted it? No, you didn't move your hands, but-"</p><p>"I'm afraid you must come to terms that magic and alchemy are vastly different, Mister Elric. You will know this in due time at Hogwarts."</p><p>Dumbledore held out a hand, which Ed reluctantly shook. "This is the Order of the Phoenix. We are an undercover movement working to stop Voldemort, a notorious Dark Wizard from rising to power. Welcome, Edward. Harry Potter resides in twelve Grimmauld Place."</p><p>Dumbledore leaned forward. "Have you been notified of his status?"</p><p>"Just that I'm supposed to protect this twerp."</p><p>Better get this mission over with so I can go back to Central.</p><p>Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "Something along the sort." He glanced at his own watch. "It's late, but I expect most people are still up. I'll see you at Hogwarts, Professor Elric."</p><p>Edward blinked, and Dumbledore was gone, seemingly without a trace.</p><p>
  <em>He's gone. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Professor Elric. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>That has a nice ring to it. </em>
</p><p>Edward sighed. He set his bags down and knocked, using the door knocker that was in the shape of a twisted serpent.</p><p>
  <em>What a weird door knocker. </em>
</p><p>The door opened to reveal a thin man. He had a kind face, but it was offset by thin scars across his face. He wore muggle clothing, to Edward's relief.</p><p>"I'm Edward Elric. The new Alchemy professor."</p><p>The man blinked down at him. "Really, we weren't expecting you to be this-"</p><p>
  <em>Call me short. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Or small. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I DARE you to.</em>
</p><p>But no, the man finished the sentence off with "-young. Please, come in."</p><p>He helped Edward with his bags. "You can call me Remus, Remus Lupin."</p><p>"Your name is from Latin?"</p><p>Remus looked, surprised at Edward. "Yes, how do you know?"</p><p>"Eh, Alchemy interlocks with Latin a lot, so I thought to learn-" Edward gagged, realizing he just finished his sentence in Amestrian.</p><p>
  <em>The spell wore off. </em>
</p><p>He pointed at his throat to Lupin. Luckily, Lupin understood. "Oh, no worries, just let me renew the translation charm."</p><p>"Thank you, Remus."</p><p>'No problem."</p><p>They reached a door, in which Remus opened. "Everyone?"</p><p>There was a fair amount of people, with looks that Edward had never seen before. Flaming red hair on a portly woman, for one, to a young woman with purple hair.</p><p>There were two other people with scarlet hair, the same as the woman. An older man, and someone who probably wasn't past twenty. They might be related. </p><p>The young man had scarlet hair that was longer than Edwards, which Edward looked at enviously. He also had a fang in one ear, which Edward could only think of as <em>badass</em>.</p><p>"Remus" greeted the woman with red hair. She looked to be around middle-aged, with kind eyes. She glanced at Edward. "Who are you, dear?"</p><p>Ed clicked his heels together. "My name is Edward Elric, ma'am. Pleased to meet you."</p><p>She laughed, a warm chuckle. "How polite! No need for formalities, dearie. Why are you here?"</p><p>"I'm the Alchemy professor."</p><p>Her laugh stopped halfway. "You?"</p><p>Edward tugged on his braid self-consciously."Yep."</p><p>"But you're a child!"</p><p>Edward grimaced. "I'm not a child! I've been a State Alchemist and the military for three years!"</p><p>The red-haired woman gulped. "You, a professor and part of the order? That's horrible! No, no, you shouldn't burden yourself with the Order but if you're also teaching-" She heaved. "-a child soldier? If your military has child soldiers, then-</p><p>"Molly."</p><p>The red-haired woman, evidently named Molly, stopped to look at a tall man with shoulder-length black hair. His eyes were sharp as he addressed her.</p><p>"Molly, I'm sure Amestris has different beliefs in this sort of thing, if the boy's a professor that means he's a professor, easy enough-"</p><p>"But still!"</p><p>She stalked away. The young women with purple hair peered curiously at Edward. "Can you, er, do alchemy?"</p><p>"Yeah, watch." He set down his travelling bag. He clapped his hands and slapped them against the wood table. There was a flash of lightning, and where the table was stood a small armoured figure made out of wood, protruding from the table.</p><p>"Wow!" The woman bent down to take a closer look at the mini-Alphonse figure Edward had created, when she bumped over an umbrella stand.</p><p>Crash! She fell onto the ground. Edward made to help her up. But that wasn't the worst of it. As soon as she fell, there was another scream. It was bloodchilling, echoing throughout the massive place.</p><p>"Filth! Scum! Byproducts of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers-"</p><p>Edward clapped his hands over his head, wincing as his automail arm hit his head a little too hard.</p><p>Where is that sound coming from? It seems to reverberate against the walls, maybe a hidden speaker? But that would require wire-</p><p>He saw that the man with black hair, the one that had spoken up for him had leapt out of his seat, racing for a portrait down the hall. Curious, Edward followed him, amid the cruel shrieking.</p><p>When he went down the hall, he was in for a shock. The portraits were moving and screaming, all of them, with the most lifelike tendencies. It was like they were trapped on the other side of a window.</p><p>
  <em>They're moving? Did someone transmute a soul to that-?</em>
</p><p>The loudest sound was coming from a life-size portrait of an old hag woman. She was extremely ugly, to put it simply. She was screaming at the black-haired man, who was trying to close the curtains surrounding her portrait.</p><p>"I-said-shut-UP!" He roared, closing them with a final tug.</p><p>It was as if that had quelled her screams, leaving only echoes. Just then, a group of teenagers walked down. In the lead was a gangly-looking boy that looked too skinny. He wore a pair of circular glasses in front of emerald green eyes. Behind him was a girl with bushy brown hair and three boys and another girl, all with the same scarlet red hair as the woman back in the room.</p><p>The man swept his hair from his face and addressed the boy in front, "Hello, Harry. I see you've met my mother."</p><p>
  <em>Harry Potter? The skinny kid I see in front?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That's whom I'm supposed to keep an eye on?</em>
</p><p>The redhead behind Harry said "Oi, Sirius, who's the midget behind you?"</p><p>That was all it took to put Edward into a rage. He snarled, striding up to the boy. It wasn't fair, that the redhead was so ridiculously tall and Edward had to tilt his head back to look him in the eye. He scrunched the front of the boy's shirt.</p><p>"I. AM. NOT. SHORT!"</p><p>The boy put up his hands. "Sorry, sorry! Yeesh, mate."</p><p>Two more redheads popped in front of him. Good God, were the redheads everywhere? But these looked a lot more similar than the others, so they must be twins.</p><p>"But I still think, the real question is-"</p><p>"-<em>who</em> are you?"</p><p>It was discerning, how they finished each other's sentences.</p><p>"I'm Professor Elric," Edward said slowly. "The new Alchemy professor at Hogwarts."</p><p>They stared. But before anyone could say anything else, the tall man (who was presumably named Sirius) ushered them downstairs. "Come on, the meeting's done, let's go down for dinner, shall we?"</p><p>Edward agreed with that. He was starving.</p><p>The kitchen was a cavernous room with rough stone walls. The red haired woman and man were already in the kitchen, preparing food. But what made Ed's mouth drop was how the vegetables were floating in the air, dunking themselves into the sink and washing themselves, supervised by the man.</p><p>Edward tapped Sirius on the shoulder. "How are they doing that?" He asked, voice full of wonder. "They aren't doing anything but the food is still floating, how are they-"</p><p>Sirius chuckled. "You see her wand?" He saw a thin stick being held by the scarlet haired woman.</p><p>
  <em>Oh, yeah. Her name is Molly. </em>
</p><p>"That's all magic. Every part of it."</p><p>Edward gaped.</p><p>"Fellow looks like he hasn't seen magic a day in his life" muttered one of the redheads. Edward whipped around, golden eyes flashing. "Shut your goddamn trap."</p><p>They made a quiet group as they took seats around the kitchen table.</p><p>The skinny one, Harry Potter started talking with Sirius. It seemed Harry was upset about something and Sirius was consoling him. They were talking too fast for Edward to completely understand it, but he caught the words dementors, Ministry of Magic, Voldemort, and Phoenix.</p><p>Then Sirius said something about cleaning up the place when there was a loud crash.</p><p>"Fred-George-NO, JUST CARRY THEM!" Molly shrieked. A large cauldron of what appeared to be stew, a flagon of what looked like a brown drink, and a breadboard with a knife came speeding towards them. Ed, Harry, and Sirius dove to the ground. Ed winced, as his automail leg hit the ground before his real leg, making a <em>thump</em> that did not feel good.</p><p>"FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!" screamed Molly. "THERE WAS NO NEED-I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS-JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY LITTLE THING!"</p><p>The twins began cleaning up the messes, one saying "sorry, mum, we were just trying to save a bit of time!" While the other yanked the knife out of the table.</p><p>
  <em>Their names are Fred and George. It's a wonder how their mother can separate them.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So it appears some people aren't allowed to use magic, but the twins are allowed. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I guess magic has some disadvantages. </em>
</p><p>"Boys-" began the red haired man, probably their father. "Your mother's right, you're supposed to show a sense of responsibility now that you've come of age-"</p><p>"— none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!" Mrs. Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again.</p><p>
  <em>It's kind of funny.</em>
</p><p>"Bill didn't feel the need to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn't Charm everything he met! Percy —" She stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden.</p><p>
  <em>That lady has a lot of kids, some who don't like her, that's for sure. </em>
</p><p>"Let's eat," said Bill quickly. "It looks wonderful, Molly," said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate for her and handing it across the table. For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food.</p><p>Edward dug in, ravenous. The food was a different style compared to Amestris food, but it was still well-made. Edward could feel a few people's stares at his head but he ignored them, focusing on his food.</p><p>
  <em>Don't give a crap what people think of me. Just eat, get the freaking job done, and leave. </em>
</p><p>Then Mrs. Weasley turned to Sirius and said, "I've been meaning to tell you, there's something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just be a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out."</p><p>"Whatever you like," said Sirius indifferently.</p><p>"The curtains in there are full of doxies too," Mrs. Weasley went on. "I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow."</p><p>Edward heard a lot of things in a few different conversations. Once, when he looked up from eating he saw the same girl that had been around the table earlier, changing her hair from pink to purple. While Ed was still gawking about her hair colour she began changing her face, from a pig snout to duck lips.</p><p>He didn't understand a thing about anything.</p><p>
  <em>That's got to change. </em>
</p><p>Edward stood up, his automail leg creaking slightly.</p><p>"Oi!"</p><p>Everyone stared at him. Edward went on. "First, thanks for the food, really tasty. But now-" Edward rubbed his gloved hands together. "-someone, please tell me what the hell is going on."</p><p>Stunned silence. "...Dumbledore never told you?"</p><p>Ed shrugged. "He only told there's an order, and-"</p><p>I suspect the Potter boy would not appreciate me saying I'm supposed to protect him.</p><p>"-that I'd be teaching at Hogwarts starting September first. So, first thing's first. Who is Voldemort?"</p><p>The atmosphere of the room changed dramatically. The adults sat up straighter, the teens exchanging uneasy glances.</p><p>Remus leaned forward. "Tell me, Edward, what do you know of a Wizarding War?"</p><p>"When?"</p><p>"The War ended around fifteen years ago."</p><p>Edward narrowed his eyes. "No, I don't know of a Wizarding War fifteen years ago. Amestris had just entered another Civil War at that time."</p><p>"Amestris is known for causing strife amongst its neighbors, is it not?"</p><p>Edward shrugged. "More or less. But what does this have to do with Voldemort?"</p><p>They cringed at the name. "Voldemort is an evil wizard who has fought for the Dark for as long as anyone can remember. He wants power, and that is the thing out of his grasp."</p><p>"So what does this have to do with Harry Potter?" He glanced at the boy as he said it. Harry scowled back. "Voldemort killed my parents" he began with little preamble. "when I was a baby." The red-haired woman patted his shoulder. "Now, Harry, you don't need to explain such a sad event-"</p><p>"It's okay, Mrs. Weasley. Well, so Voldemort tried to kill me too, but he failed, and he lost his powers. But now he's back." Harry glanced around the table. "That's the short version."</p><p>
  <em>This voldy-who sounds a little bit like the Fuhrer. </em>
</p><p>Molly's name is Mrs. Weasley, so I guess they would be Ron, Fred, and George Weasely. Weird name.</p><p>"So what am I supposed to do?" He looked around the table, staring at the adults in the eye. Lupin shifted. "Well, there were a few things we had in mind, but we didn't know you were going to be so young. Most of our delegations are for the adults, you see."</p><p>Edward ground his teeth.</p><p>
  <em>You're too young, you're too small.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was like they didn't want him to do anything. </em>
</p><p>Molly stood up.</p><p>"Nearly time for bed, I think," she said on a yawn.</p><p>"Not just yet, Molly," said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry. "You know, I'm surprised at you. I thought the first thing you'd do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort, but it appears Elric beat you to it."</p><p>"I did!" said Harry indignantly. "I asked Ron and Hermione but they said we're not allowed in the Order, so —"</p><p>
  <em>I guess the stupidly tall redhead is named Ron and the girl with bushy hair is Hermione. What weird names.</em>
</p><p>"And they're quite right," said Mrs. Weasley. "You're too young."</p><p>
  <em>If I had a nickel every time someone said that to me, I'd be richer than the Armstrongs.</em>
</p><p>She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched upon its arms, every trace of drowsiness gone.</p><p>"Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?" asked Sirius. "Harry's been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He's got the right to know what's been happen —"</p><p>"Hang on!" interrupted George loudly. "How come Harry gets his questions answered?" said Fred angrily.</p><p>"We've been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven't told us a single stinking thing!" said George.</p><p>" 'You're too young, you're not in the Order,' " said Fred, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother's. "Harry's not even of age!"</p><p>"It's not my fault you haven't been told what the Order's doing," said Sirius calmly. "That's your parents' decision. Harry, on the other hand —"</p><p>"It's not down to you to decide what's good for Harry!" said Mrs. Weasley sharply. Her normally kind face looked dangerous. "You haven't forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?"</p><p>"Which bit?" Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though ready-ing himself for a fight.</p><p>
  <em>Ah, so I'm not the only person who isn't fond of the old man.</em>
</p><p>"The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know," said Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.</p><p>
  <em>"needs to know." Yeah, right. </em>
</p><p>Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George's heads turned from Sirius to Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open. Lupin's eyes were fixed on Sirius.</p><p>Edward watched with hungry eyes, cataloging every single detail for further use.</p><p>"I don't intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly," said Sirius. "But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back" (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name that Edward simply did not understand, what was the use of being scared of a name?), "he has more right than most to —"</p><p>"He's not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!" said Mrs. Weasley. "He's only fifteen and —"</p><p>I'm technically a member, right? And I'm fifteen. What's the big deal?</p><p>"— and he's dealt with as much as most in the Order," said Sirius, "and more than some —"</p><p>"No one's denying what he's done!" said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. "But he's still-"</p><p>"He's not a child!" said Sirius impatiently.</p><p>
  <em>Damn right he's not. </em>
</p><p>"He's not an adult either!" said Molly, the color rising in her cheeks. "He's not James, Sirius!"</p><p>"I'm perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly," said Sirius coldly.</p><p>"I'm not sure you are!" said Mrs. Weasley. "Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it's as though you think you've got your best friend back!"</p><p>"What's wrong with that?" said Harry.</p><p>"What's wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him!" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. "You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!"</p><p>
  <em>So Harry's father was named James, and Sirius was good friends with him. Yeesh, everyone's so loud.</em>
</p><p>"Meaning I'm an irresponsible godfather?" demanded Sirius, his voice rising.</p><p><em>And he was a </em>godfather<em>? No wonder these wizards acted like they didn't have brains. </em></p><p>"Meaning you've been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and —"</p><p>"We'll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please!" said Sirius loudly. "Arthur!" said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. "Arthur, back me up!"</p><p>Arthur, or Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say, "Dumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters —"</p><p>"Yes, but there's a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes! Well," said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, "well . . . I can see I'm going to be overruled. I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry's best interests at heart —"</p><p>"He's not your son," said Sirius quietly.</p><p>"He's as good as," said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. "Who else has he got?"</p><p>"He's got me!"</p><p>"Yes," said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. "The thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after him while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it?"</p><p>
  <em>The hell is Azkaban?</em>
</p><p>Sirius started to rise from his chair.</p><p>"Molly, you're not the only person at this table who cares about Harry," said Lupin sharply. "Sirius, sit down."</p><p>Mrs. Weasley's lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into his chair, his face white.</p><p>"I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this," Lupin continued. "He's old enough to decide for himself."</p><p>
  <em>Finally, someone said it!</em>
</p><p>"I want to know what's been going on," Harry said at once.</p><p>"Very well," said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking. "Ginny — Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I want you out of this</p><p>kitchen, now." There was instant uproar. "We're of age!" Fred and George bellowed together. "If Harry's allowed, why can't I?" shouted Ron.</p><p>"Mum, I want to!" wailed Ginny.</p><p>Then, of course, someone had to reign Edward into it. The twins pointed at Ed.</p><p>"He's younger than us-"</p><p>"-he's staying, no one is objecting, it's not fair!"</p><p>Lupin interjected. "Mister Elric is a professor, I'm sure he is older than he looks, he wouldn't be here otherwise-"</p><p>Ron interrupted. "Oh yeah?" He jabbed at Edward. "How old are you?"</p><p>Edward bristled. "I'm fifteen, what about it?" He barked.</p><p>The table was still, if only for a moment."</p><p>"You're fifteen?"</p><p>"You aren't even done school!"</p><p>"How are you supposed to teach!"</p><p>"That's horrible!" Wailed Mrs. Weasley. "I thought you were young, but fifteen is underage! How did you get a job?"</p><p>"I just did." Edward shrugged. "What's the big deal with letting them listen?"</p><p>"NO!" shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. "I absolutely forbid —"</p><p>"Molly, you can't stop Fred and George," said Mr. Weasley wearily.</p><p>"They are of age —"</p><p>"They're still at school —"</p><p>"But they're legally adults now," said Mr. Weasley in the same tired voice.</p><p>Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face. "I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron —"</p><p>"Harry'll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!" said Ron hotly. "Won't — won't you?" he added uncertainly, meeting Harry's eyes.</p><p>" 'Course I will," Harry said. Ron and Hermione beamed.</p><p>"Fine!" shouted Mrs. Weasley. "Fine! Ginny — BED!"</p><p>Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall Mrs. Black's earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only after he had returned, closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke.</p><p>"Okay, Harry . . . what do you want to know?"</p><p>Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing him for a month.</p><p>"Where's Voldemort? What's he doing? I've been trying to watch the Muggle news," he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name, "and there hasn't been anything that looks like him yet, no funny deaths or anything —"</p><p>Edward scoffed. "You stupid? They wouldn't do that. They need to get more cover."</p><p>Harry glared at him. "Oh yeah? What do you know?"</p><p>Edward set a glass of water down "Way more than you, that's for sure."</p><p>"You're a foreigner, you don't know anything about our country!"</p><p>Edward slammed his (thankfully, his left hand) on the table. "Bull!"</p><p>
  <em>Your villain has awakened, but he doesn't have any power. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Our bad guys, the Homunculus, they've had hundreds of years to prepare. </em>
</p><p>"But anyways" Sirius said hurriedly, "Harry, you've put a dent in his plan. He was going to kill you last year, but you survived, you lived to tell us! So now he's laying low, afraid of Dumbledore."</p><p>Edward spat out his water. "Dumbledore? That old coot?"</p><p>Sirius and Lupin laughed. "Edward, we'd appreciate it if you didn't call him that" Lupin said amiably. "Dumbledore's one of the most powerful wizards in the world. It's nice to have him on our side."</p><p>"So, what are we doing about it?"</p><p>"First off, we need to inform people that Voldemort has returned," Sirius said grimly. "But it's hard. The Ministry refuses to believe he's back."</p><p>Useless government.</p><p>"But you're telling people, aren't you?" said Harry, looking around at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. Edward took another drink of his water. "You're letting people know he's back?"</p><p>They all smiled humourlessly. </p><p>"Well, as everyone thinks I'm a mad mass murderer and the Ministry's put a ten-thousand-Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I?" said Sirius restlessly.</p><p>
  <em>Only ten thousand? I bet I would rack up more money if I was on the run.</em>
</p><p>"And I'm not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community," said Lupin. "It's an occupational hazard of being a werewolf."</p><p>Edward gaped.</p><p><em>Werewolf</em>?</p><p>A werewolf, he knew from fantasy stories, was a man who turned into a wolf during the full moon. But the skinny and tired man, with scars on his face, looked so harmless.</p><p>Now that he thought of it, a description of a werewolf sounded suspiciously like a Chimera...</p><p>"Wait a minute," Ed said, rounding on Lupin. "You-you're a werewolf?"</p><p>"That's it," Lupin said in an easy voice, although his eyes were hard. "Is there a problem?"</p><p>"Are you a chimera?"</p><p>Lupin looked taken aback. "I beg your pardon?"</p><p>Edward muttered to himself. "No, there haven't been any alchemists in London, there would be no one to perform the transmutation, but a werewolf...to capture a wolf, but then the human-"</p><p>"Can we continue this conversation later, please, Edward?"</p><p>Ed nodded.</p><p>I'll need to write notes.</p><p>"But anyways, Tonks and Arthur will lose their jobs if they talk like that, the Ministry's been cranking down really hard lately..."</p><p>"One thing we know for sure, is You-Know-Who's planning something bigger this time."</p><p>
  <em>What's with the name?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Of course he's planning something bigger. He's fallen once, he's going to get more power this time. Why are wizards so dense?</em>
</p><p>"What?" Asked Harry. "Something worse than the Avada-Kedavra-?"</p><p>"That's enough!" Mrs. Weasley clearly had had enough of the conversation. "I want you in bed now, all of you. That includes you, Edward."</p><p>Edward twisted his mouth.</p><p>
  <em>It's late anyways. Better sleep now. </em>
</p><p>"...Yes, ma'am."</p><p>"Please, just call me Mrs. Weasley."</p><p>He followed the group upstairs, slinging his bag over his back and carrying his suitcase.</p><p>"Edward, dear, there's an empty guest room opposite from Harry and Ron's room, you can take that one." Edward nodded his thanks.</p><p>"Ron, twins, get Edward acquainted with his room, I need to go downstairs for a second-" she bustled downstairs. Fred (or George?) lifted Ed's suitcase.</p><p>"Blimey, mate. Heavy as bricks."</p><p>Edward scowled. "Be careful with them. That's the material you're going to be taught this year."</p><p>The twins chuckled. "You seem okay, Mister Edward."</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p><p>Ron opened the door. The room was covered in dust, but with a flick of a wand the twins cleaned it up. In the bedroom was one bed and one desk. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>"It's a bit bare, but it's good." Ron glanced at Ed. "Bathroom's on the right. Lock your door at night, there's a house-elf on the loose."</p><p>Edward didn't know what a house-elf was. He figured it could wait till tomorrow, but he made a note to lock his door.</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>He waited until they had retreated into their own rooms that Ed relaxed. He locked his door like Ron had suggested, and flopped onto the bed.</p><p>it squeaked, and hidden dust rained onto the floor.</p><p>
  <em>What have I gotten myself into?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It's late, I should go to sleep. I'll write to Al tomorrow.</em>
