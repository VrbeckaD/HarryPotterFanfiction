        <em>- The Sorting Hat, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong> <em>April 1990</em> </strong>
      </p>
      <p>It’s an easily observable fact that history is written by those with power, you think to yourself. It’s why you never hear about Dumbledore’s dalliance with a certain dark wizard back in 1899, or never come to know the history of the Gaunt family unless you hunt around through stacks of parchment more yellowed than Argus Filch’s teeth.</p>
      <p>To the generation that cropped up after 1980 - and to many who had been around at the time, and should have known better - the first war against Voldemort could be summed up easily: a resistance group of valiant Gryffindors, aided by a smattering of Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, and internationally-educated wix, against a psychopath and his army of followers.</p>
      <p>The side of good, The Order of the Phoenix, was a unified front, full of heroic and courageous individuals that did everything they could to stop the machinations of Lord Voldemort and his sycophants, never once stooping to his level in their battles.</p>
      <p>Albus Dumbledore, a paragon of white magic, made sure of this.</p>
      <p>After so many died, at least once Voldemort had been essentially killed by a child, many were turned into venerated martyrs. Because it was safe, memorials to resistance members popped up across all of Wizarding Britain. It seemed like everyone had known at least one of those bold individuals.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Gideon Prewett. Fabian Prewett. Marlene McKinnon. Benjy Fenwick. Peter Pettigrew. James Potter. Lily Evans-Potter. Alice Fortescue. Frank Longbottom.</em>
      </p>
      <p>And more, besides. Bright, young, full of life, and taken too long before their time.</p>
      <p>Getting sorted into Gryffindor became a point of pride, since so many of their number had fallen in battle against an unspeakable evil.</p>
      <p>And while Slytherin maintained much of its old-money prestige, due to the affluence and influence of its old members, there were always whispers in the hallways about that lot.</p>
      <p>Because where had Slytherin house been during Voldemort’s reign of terror? Heeding his call in the silver masks of Death Eaters, naturally. Torturing and slaying muggles, muggleborns, and anyone suspected of assisting them. Even the ones who did nothing, did exactly that. Nothing. Never once raised a word of objection, or a wand in retaliation.</p>
      <p>The house of ambition and cunning? Really, now?</p>
      <p>Unless you asked an affluent pureblood wix, raised from birth to end up there, and oftentimes indoctrinated with delusions of inherent genetic superiority, Slytherin was comprised of elitist cowards at best, and dark wizards at worst.</p>
      <p>If you have information suggesting otherwise, you've learned to keep your mouth shut.</p>
      <p>What would be the point in arguing?</p>
      <p>People tend to write history into the format most convenient for the era, and last decade is no exception to that rule. </p>

  <p>On your way to work, you pass a memorial to Dorcas Meadowes, newly restored, and surrounded by candles that have been lit with gentle pink flames.</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="layoutArea">
    <p></p>
    <div class="column">
      <p>Idly, you remember that today would have been her birthday. Thirty-five, is it? She’d been around four or five years above you in Hogwarts, a Hufflepuff prefect who’d given your terrified eleven year old self directions back to your dormitory with a smile.</p>
      <p>Later, she had been a reasonably talented duelist as well, but not talented enough, not nearly enough.</p>
      <p>You step through the entrance into the Ministry of Magic, and walk as briskly as you can to your department with your busted knee, an old injury that never quite healed properly.</p>
      <p>“Morning, Augustine!” someone calls as you pass.</p>
      <p>You wave in the vague direction of their voice. Damn these hallways and their echoing, eternally confusing you with these acoustics.</p>
      <p>Alastor Moody spies you across the lift and nods at you, a gesture you return with a genuine smile. You keep meaning to have a cup of tea with that man, even if he tries to find an excuse to get out of it. You keep meaning to have a cup of tea with a lot of people.</p>
      <p>Once you’ve reached your office, located in the broom regulatory control division of the Department of Magical Transportation, your assistant mock-salutes you, everything but his face obscured by an impressive stack of paperwork.</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on this poor kid’s soul.</p>
      <p>“Working hard, or hardly working?” you ask.</p>
      <p>“I dunno, you tell me, Mr. Greengrass.”</p>
      <p>You ease yourself down into the chair at your desk, stare down your own respective pile of parchment paperwork, and sigh loudly. As an afterthought, you decide to brew a cup of tea and read the Prophet before you even think of tackling any of this nonsense, most of it involving teenagers flying their brooms into muggle territory, and the resultant incident reports.</p>
      <p>You dash off your signature on perhaps thirty of these documents before your vision starts to blur with the banality of the exercise.</p>
      <p>You unfold the Prophet on your lap and start reading. Chances are, the minister won’t decide to check up on your division today (or ever, for that matter).</p>
      <p>It takes you maybe fifteen minutes to read the whole paper cover to cover.</p>
      <p>However, something in the obituary section gives you pause - a report of the accidental death of one thirty year old Pandora McCann, survived by her husband and young daughter.</p>
      <p>You recall Dorcas Meadowes’s memorial, a few blocks away. Yes, people you have known have died, more of them than you’d wished.</p>
      <p>Pandora, though? The pint-sized Huffepuff girl with a knack for luring Death Eaters into empty buildings, allowing them to nearly corner her, and then dropping the entire ceiling down on them with a well-placed Reducto? Insisting she was of age when she joined the Order, with the documentation to prove it, even though she looked fourteen at best?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><div class="page" title="Page 4">
  <p>Her death strikes you as being a patent impossibility, some sort of mistake. People like Pandora don’t <em>die</em>.</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="layoutArea">
    <p></p>
    <div class="column">
      <p>(<em>Neither do any of the others who have,</em> you remind yourself.)</p>
      <p>As it turns out, her accident had involved some self-created spell gone awry, and if that doesn’t sound just like something that would happen to her, you don’t know what does.</p>
      <p>You recall a Slytherin prefect giving a fourth-year Pandora detention for devising an irrigation charm more effective than Aguamenti and inadvertently flooding half the dungeons. She’d merely stood there blinking, as the water rose around her, and students ran past her. She seemed vaguely fascinated by the entire thing, even as an upperclassman from her house yanked her to relative safety on the staircase above her. </p>
      <p>
        <em>(The day after that stunt, this girl walks up to you in the dungeons, her hair messily arranged into several braids piled atop her head, her blouse untucked, and her hands cupped together carefully around something or another. You have no idea what she’s doing down here. There are several people from your house just jumping at the opportunity to curse her. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They’d likely threaten to hex her anyway - Pandora being the kind of girl who'd never see it coming - but in this case, for once, they'd have a legitimate reason.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>“You’re one of their prefects, right?” she asks you. “Slytherin, I mean.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You nod, and answer in the affirmative. Not the one who gave her detention, though, you add.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>“Oh, well, I sort of knew that already. But I thought I would give you this anyway, since I’m quite sorry for what happened.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>She opens her hands, and a monarch butterfly emerges, taking flight, and landing on your left shoulder. Upon further examination, you realize that it isn’t alive in the traditional sense, even as one of its antennae twitch, and its wings fold in.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It’s a perfect facsimile of a butterfly, carefully crafted from parchment and various shades of ink.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You mean to ask her exactly what possessed her to hand this to you of all people, how the hell she did it, and what the hell it even means, but once you turn 'round again, she’s already gone.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>Pandora McCann. How ironic that she survived the war with Voldemort, when so many others did not, only to die of something wholly unrelated.</p>
      <p>You recall Dorcas again, and a wave of sorrow slams into you like the Knight Bus. Not because of her memorial, sitting against a lamppost, clear as day, but because of the people you know <em>who did not get memorials.</em></p>
      <p>Too precarious for some, the ones whose families never heard of their extracurricular activities - because it was safer then not to know - and then never found out the truth the after the fact. Still believing their loved one to be out there somewhere, hiding, maybe. Perhaps that's kinder than reality.</p>
      <p>Too shameful for others, to the ones who grew up in the upper echelon of the wizarding world, where blood status was everything.</p>
      <p>Why would any self-respecting member of wizarding society erect a memorial to a blood traitor? To them, the Dark Lord may have been overzealous in his methodology, but as for the goals of the Order of the Phoenix? Equality with mudbloods and rights for half-breeds? Utterly preposterous.</p>
      <p>You don’t know how many pureblood parents must have begun disowning relatives left and right upon learning which side their child was really on.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><div class="page" title="Page 5">
  <p>And yes, there were a few such people being disinherited.</p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="layoutArea">
    <p></p>
    <div class="column">
      <p>Not every pureblood wore a silver mask. So much of what you know to be fact is diametrically opposed to What Really Happened in the eyes of those who write history.</p>
      <p>
        <em>(The first war against Voldemort could be summed up easily: a resistance group of valiant Gryffindors, aided by a smattering of Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, and internationally-educated wix against a psychopathic madman and his army of Slytherin followers. </em>

        <em>That side of good, The Order of the Phoenix, was a unified front, full of heroic and courageous individuals that did everything they could to stop the machinations of Lord Voldemort, never once stooping to his level.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(Where had Slytherin house been during Voldemort’s reign of terror? Heeding his call in their silver masks, of course.

      </p>
      <p>Sometimes it’s easier to believe their truth, because then, maybe, certain things never occurred. Certain people never died or went insane. Certain atrocities were never committed in the name<br/>of the Greater Good. You were just Obliviatedat some point, then implanted with false accounts of your young adulthood.</p>
      <p>However, Kingsley Shacklebolt nods a little too wearily at you in the hallways at the Ministry, and Alastor Moody gives you a gruff grunt of recognition when he sees you, and you know, you know in your heart of hearts, that you are not the one misremembering these events.</p>
      <p>Not all of Salazar’s children were evil.</p>
      <p>Not all of Godric’s were good.</p>
      <p>Morality is seldom as binary as anyone likes to admit.</p>
      <p>Find a time-turner strong and precise enough to return you to the tail end of the 1970s, and you could prove it, even if such a device doesn’t exist, and all you have are your memories.</p>
      <p>Recollections of young men and women who raised their wands against bigots in masks, who had, months ago, been their roommates amid the green and silver bed hangings in the dungeons.</p>
      <p>You can’t recall every single student who went that route, just the mere fact that they existed.</p>
      <p>Four stick out in your head, as they always do, those you came to consider your dearest friends - <em>Calypso Shacklebolt, Corona Yaxley, Julius Flint, and Leonard Travers.</em></p>
      <p>You are the last of that quintet, the only one to be both alive and, relatively speaking, in your right mind.</p>
      <p>Each of you had little to gain, but much to lose by resisting the Dark Lord. Still, you joined the battle against him - not entirely aware of the consequences; who could have been? - but prepared to face them nevertheless.</p>
