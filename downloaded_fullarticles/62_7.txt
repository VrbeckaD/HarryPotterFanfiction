    <p>Inuyasha looked at the group heading towards the CDC from the camera's and frowned softly who would come to the city like this. He looked at the tan skinned baby playing with a pale skinned toddler and smiled softly. He said ''Yuki are you being nice to your brother'' the white-haired toddler nodded at him and Inuyasha nodded and said ''Good boy.'' He looked at Jenner and asked ''Are you going to let them in Jenner?'' Doctor Edwin Jenner looked at the screens by now the leader of the group was begging to be let inside.</p><p>He answered ''I might as well I don't want to see them eaten by the dead''</p><p>Inuyasha nodded and said ''I'll have Harri bring in the medical supplies'' he picked up Yuki and rubbed Naru's head and the infant looked up at him and giggled cutely.</p><p>Harrison looked up when Inuyasha entered the room with Yuki he said ''Where's Naru?''</p><p>Inuyasha answered ''With the doc he's going to need your help drawing blood he's about to let in another group.''</p><p>Harrison nodded and turned and a caramel skinned infant around the same age as Naru was strapped to his chest but the infant was a girl. He said ''Come on Kiara let's go my love'' he walked out of the kitchen and Inuyasha took his place.</p><p>Harrison walked past the game room and saw Kouga packing some books into a trunk. Kouga looked and smiled at his mate and said ''You guys okay''</p><p>Harrison nodded and said ''Fine I just need to get some needles to help Jenner.''</p><p>Kouga nodded and took Kiara she cooed at her father and Kouga rubbed noses with her and said ''Come on my little pup want to stay with Papa'' Kiara babbled at him with joy and Harrison left the room.</p><p>Rick's group followed Doctor Jenner into the room and saw a playpen in the corner with an infant inside. The baby looked at them the woman walked over and Jenner said ''Please don't I would rather not have Harrison upset if someone touches his son without his permission''</p><p>A teenager walked in with long black hair that was in a high ponytail he had green markings on his face underneath his eyes he was very feminine he looked like a female without the breasts. He handed the item's in his hands to Jenner and he walked by them and picked up the infant inside the playpen he grinned at the baby and said ''Hello cub'' and kissed his nose. He looked at the group holding the infant with dark green eyes the same color as the teens. He said ''Hello.''</p><p>Flashback to 4 years ago</p><p>Harry Potter stared at himself in the mirror he had green markings underneath his eyes. He was glad the Dursley's were on vacation so he was alone in the house. He sighed in relief he had a feminine looking body he looked like a bloody girl now. He walked into his room and saw a letter on his pillow.</p><p>He walked over and opened it and saw that it was a letter from his mother and he read ''Dear Harrison, This is your mother I'm so sorry if I'm not there to tell you this in person I just wanted to tell you that you should have gone into a creature inheritance apparently I was stolen at birth by the wizards and they sent me to live with muggles and blocked my inheritance when I was a child and I couldn't get the block off without it killing me so I decided not to risk my life or yours I found out about it when I was pregnant with you.''</p><p>There were tear drops on the paper she continued her writing getting shaky ''Your father is James Potter but he wasn't my mate he wasn't the one I was meant to be with Severus Snape was the man that was supposed to be your father Harrison I'm so sorry I was under a lot of spells starting from when I entered Hogwarts to now I never thought about it I had been in love with Severus and then magically I came to hate him I just assumed him calling me mudblood was the last straw but…Never mind I don't want to trouble you but Harrison get out of the wizardry world as soon as you can go to Tokyo, Japan to the Higurashi shrine and just allow your magic to lead you to the world where you will truly be happy I promise you this. I'm your mother it doesn't matter who your father is but I love you with all my heart please follow my instructions tell no one about this don't trust anyone in the wizardry world.''</p><p>Harrison packed his things and said ''Okay Mom I will do as you wish.'' He stole money from the Vernon and Petunia's master bedroom. He left the house and hailed a cab leaving the household he was never going back.</p><p>Flashback Ends</p><p>Harrison was knocked out of his flashback when Jenner said ''This is my assistant Harrison he's been learning under me since he and his family arrived at the beginning.''</p><p>He looked at the small group there were six males four woman and two children Harrison said ''This is my son Naru I also have a daughter Kiara she is with her other father.'' Harrison sat his son back inside the playpen and sat next to Jenner and waited for the first person to sit down.</p><p>Rick didn't know what to think about this boy he looked around 19 or 20 years old. He looked at the others and they were looking at the young teenager with the same gaze as him. A boy in a red Japanese robe with a sword strapped to his side and a pale skinned toddler on his hip. He had waist length thick sliver white hair. He said ''Harri dinner is ready Sesshōmaru and Kouga are already there.''</p><p>Harrison nodded and said ''I'll be there in a moment tell Kouga not to eat everything.''</p><p>The other teen nodded and said ''He won't eat everything from you don't worry'' Harrison nodded and went back to work on helping Jenner.</p><p>Sesshōmaru sneered at the human's sitting at the table getting drunk. Inuyasha placed a hand on his alpha's hand and Sesshōmaru heard ''It's fine we don't have to worry about them if they think it's wise to get drunk then let them.'' Sesshōmaru nodded stiffly and looked at Harrison and he was feeding the twin's and Inuyasha was feeding Yuki. Kouga was drinking a whole bottle of wine like it was water it wouldn't get him drunk at all now Harrison's fire whiskey that had some real kick. Kouga looked up and grinned and Sesshōmaru sighed softly at his fellow Alpha.</p><p>Everyone looked when the man who stood up, he looked around 23 or 24 he had purple markings on his face he had white waist length hair he sneered at the new group and said ''Come Kouga Inuyasha and Harrison we need to rest for our departure tomorrow.''</p><p>They all stood up and picked up their plates and took them into the kitchen and left the dining room. Lori huffed and said ''Well they are rude.'' Jenner walked in and told them about the shower's and where they could stay and he to wished them goodnight and went to the classroom to transfer data for Harrison's group to a flash drive so they could have the information he had on the virus.</p><p>Harrison laid down with his mates Inuyasha and himself were in the middle of Koga and Sesshōmaru the pups were sleeping in a basinet that Harri had extended so the three could fit in there comfortably. The two boys were on both sides of the baby girl protecting her in her sleep while she had her fists against both boys cheeks like she was punching them.</p>
