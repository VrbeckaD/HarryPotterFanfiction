    <p>“9 and 3 quarters… 9 and 3 quarters…” Yusuke muttered as he moved along past the platforms. “Where the hell is it?”</p>
<p>His irritation was growing as he once again passed platform 10 and reversed his course. Only to find himself back at 9.</p>
<p>“It’s not here,” he muttered in frustration. That blue-haired, oar riding lunatic didn’t know what she was talking about.</p>
<p>“Move your ass, wimp.”</p>
<p>Yusuke turned to see a brown-haired young woman shoving an orange-haired boy toward a brick wall.</p>
<p>“Hey!” he protested. “I’m working up to it, ok—”</p>
<p>Before he could finish what he was saying, he vanished through the wall.</p>
<p>Vanished.</p>
<p>Yusuke rubbed his eyes, then checked again. Yep, the orange-haired boy was gone. Now the brown-haired woman was shoving a trolley toward the same wall. Yusuke watched, both fascinated and sickened, as she disappeared through the wall.</p>
<p>Yusuke checked his position. There was platform 9… there was platform 10… this wall looked to be about three quarters of the way between them.</p>
<p>Well, that fit with all the weird shit Yusuke had seen over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Yusuke shoved his own trolley toward the wall, deciding that if he was wrong, the trolley would take the brunt of the impact for him.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and pushed the trolley forward. At the last moment, he almost pulled it back. Almost.</p>
<p>It slid into the wall as if it wasn’t even there. Yusuke closed his eyes and counted his steps as he kept walking forward.</p>
<p>He knew as soon as he’d passed through the wall. The sound of loud voices assaulted his ears.</p>
<p>“Hey! Watch it!”</p>
<p>Yusuke gaped at the orange-haired boy as he stumbled out of the way of his trolley.</p>
<p>“Don’t just fucking stand around looking like an idiot!” Yusuke retorted, even though he actually had no idea if that was really what the boy had been doing. Truthfully, he was feeling rattled and berating the young man gave him an outlet for his feelings.</p>
<p>“Maybe you should watch where you’re going!” the orange-haired boy retorted.</p>
<p>“Hey, buffoon! Get your ass on the train! It’s leaving in a minute!”</p>
<p>The brown-haired girl had returned to harass the boy, distracting him from Yusuke.</p>
<p>Realising that the woman’s warning also applied to himself, Yusuke hurried onto the train. He made his way straight down to the back of the train and secured himself an empty compartment.</p>
<p>He shoved his belongings into the rack and lounged on the seat, staring out the window at the people on the platform.</p>
<p>“Puu?”</p>
<p>Yusuke glanced at the occupant of the cage on the floor at his feet. The strangest-looking blue bird he’d ever seen stared forlornly up at him, eyes large and pleading.</p>
<p>“No, Puu, you have to stay in the cage,” Yusuke informed him.</p>
<p>The bird huffed indignantly. “Puu,” he muttered.</p>
<p>According to the lady at the Magical Menagerie shop, Puu was a phoenix chick. Yusuke wasn’t so sure. The bird was fat and blue. What kind of a phoenix was fat and blue? The bird looked more like a mutated Furby to him.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the woman had said that the chick had been there for quite some time. No one wanted him. Yusuke couldn’t help but feel sympathy for him so he’d bought the bird.</p>
<p>Besides, he was cheap. He’d cost practically pocket-change.</p>
<p>Yusuke’s chocolate-brown eyes returned to the platform. The train’s whistle cut through the air, announcing its departure. Yusuke watched the family members left behind waving and shouting to the students who were on the train, knowing that none of them were there for him.</p>
<p>His mother was back home, having refused to have anything to do with magic.</p>
<p>Guilt nudged Yusuke in his gut, making him feel sick as the train pulled out of the station. Once he’d finally gotten hold of one of the letters she’d been so determined to hide from him, thanks to that blue-haired woman, Botan, he’d discovered that he was a wizard. The letter had been an offer of enrolment at Mahō Gakkō, his country’s most prestigious magic school.</p>
<p>Yusuke had initially been excited at the prospect of learning magic. And furious at his mother for keeping that from him.</p>
<p>But his mother had remained adamant that he wasn’t to go. As usual, Yusuke had ignored her wishes and decided to go anyway. The blue-haired girl had been all-too-eager to help him. She’d taken him to the wizarding shopping district, Diagon Alley, and helped him purchase his school supplies.</p>
<p>He’d thought that money would be an issue, until he’d been told that his deceased father had left him a sizeable inheritance that was tucked away deep in the vaults of Gringotts Bank.</p>
<p>So here he was, on a train scooting across the countryside to a remote boarding school that claimed to teach magic.</p>
<p>If Yusuke actually had any friends to tell, they would never believe him.</p>
<p>Yusuke turned away from the window at the sound of the compartment door sliding open. A boy peered through, a faint, confused frown on his face.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” he said as he spotted Yusuke. “Have you seen a kitten in here?”</p>
<p>“Nah. Sorry,” Yusuke said. “No kittens.”</p>
<p>He had difficulty guessing the boy’s age. Surely he couldn’t be any younger than fifteen, since that was the minimum age the school required. They wanted their students to have a decent academic grounding in normal studies like mathematics and language before they began to learn magic.</p>
<p>The boy looked like he could be younger than fifteen, though. His face was elfin, his emerald eyes large. His hair was red and fell past his shoulders.</p>
<p>Another thing Yusuke noted was that he was also already wearing his school uniform, even though they were just passing the city limits now.</p>
<p>The boy’s pretty face dropped in disappointment. “But, I was sure…” he muttered, before the compartment door slid shut.</p>
<p>Yusuke turned his attention back to the window. Mountainous countryside flew by. He’d never spent longer than a night away from his home. Yusuke was beginning to feel uneasy about the whole thing. Maybe his mother was right. He should have stayed home, stayed on familiar ground.</p>
<p>He’d have to start all over again at this new school. He’d have to earn the respect of the other students once more. Learn how to get around the teachers.</p>
<p>“Hey, ah…”</p>
<p>Yusuke turned back to the door to see an unexpected sight. The orange-haired boy from the platform hovered uncertainly there, a cat carrier hanging from one hand. The boy smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>“You’re the boy from the platform, right?” he asked. “The one who nearly ran me over.”</p>
<p>Yusuke rolled his eyes. “It wasn’t hard,” he said dryly.</p>
<p>The boy was big for his age. His face was full of sharp lines and angles, his eyes set small and dark. But his awkwardness lent him a sort of charm that offset his brutish looks.</p>
<p>“Hey, you—” the boy started, his face turning purple. But he was cut off as a slim figure slipped deftly around him.</p>
<p>The redhead from earlier. Jade eyes glinted with good humour at Yusuke.</p>
<p>“Never mind, Kuwabara,” he said. “It’s too early in the year to harbour bad feelings for someone.”</p>
<p>“You should tell that to that little shit, Hiei,” Kuwabara muttered. “Just because his dad’s some hotshot in the Ministry… thinks he’s better than everyone else…”</p>
<p>Ignoring Kuwabara’s disgruntled muttering about the mysterious Hiei, the redhead bowed politely to Yusuke.</p>
<p>“My name is Minamino Shuichi,” he said. “First year. This is Kuwabara Kazuma, also first year. May we join you? The other compartments are full.”</p>
<p>Yusuke wasn’t sure he wanted the company, but this was a chance for him to learn about the world he was stepping into. He shrugged and made room on the seat, moving closer to the window.</p>
<p>“Sure,” he said. “I’m Urameshi Yusuke.”</p>
<p>The redhead settled his slim form beside him as Kuwabara stowed the cat carrier and sat across from them, stretching out his long legs. Like Yusuke, Kuwabara had not yet changed into his school uniform. Minamino sat primly next to Yusuke as he dug around in his bag, eventually surfacing with a thick volume.</p>
<p>Yusuke glanced curiously at the title.</p>
<p>“A History of Mahō Gakkō?” he asked.</p>
<p>Minamino turned toward him, lowering the book. “Yes,” he said. “I found it at Diagon Alley. I thought it would be a good idea to learn about the school before term starts.”</p>
<p>Kuwabara blinked, displaying startled eyes as he leaned forward. “Are you Muggle-born?” he asked curiously.</p>
<p>Minamino nodded, a smile flitting briefly across his face. “Yes,” he said. “My mother was quite shocked by the letter. She believed it to be a hoax at first. I take it that you are from a wizarding family?”</p>
<p>Kuwabara nodded. “Yeah,” he said. “Both my parents are wizards. They work for the Ministry and they travel a lot. My sister graduated from Mahō Gakkō a year ago.”</p>
<p>“What about you, Mr. Urameshi?” Minamino asked, directing his clear emerald eyes at Yusuke.</p>
<p>“It’s just Yusuke,” the black-haired boy said. Minamino talked like he was older than they were. His formality seemed unnatural to Yusuke. “And, I guess I might as well be Muggle-born. My dad was a wizard but I never knew him. My mum never mentioned anything about magic until I got the letter.”</p>
<p>“Who was your father?”</p>
<p>Kuwabara’s question made Yusuke’s mouth grow dry. “His name was Raizen,” he admitted.</p>
<p>Kuwabara’s eyes widened. “But he was…” he trailed off, looking as though a brick had landed on his head.</p>
<p>The reaction wasn’t unexpected. Yusuke had encountered it several times during his shopping trip at Diagon Alley. It seemed that his father was well-known in the wizarding world. And not entirely for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Minamino began flipping through the book, his gaze intense as he skimmed the pages. Finally, he paused, fingertip pressed to a page.</p>
<p>“A Death Eater,” he said quietly. “Who betrayed the Dark Lord in order to marry a Muggle girl.” He glanced sideways at Yusuke. “And was killed for that betrayal. The mother…”</p>
<p>“Wait? Why is that in there?” Yusuke demanded, incensed. He made a grab for the book in Minamino’s hand, but the redhead held it out of his reach.</p>
<p>“The mother was also killed,” he continued. “The Dark Lord tried to murder the boy as well, but the spell bounced off the boy and hit the Dark Lord instead, killing him.”</p>
<p>Kuwabara stared at Yusuke with wide, shocked eyes. “That’s you?” he asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>Yusuke was practically leaning over Minamino’s lap in an effort to get the book. Minamino’s long arm extended out, keeping it away from Yusuke’s flailing hand.</p>
<p>“Calm down,” he said. “It’s not a big deal.”</p>
<p>“Like hell it isn’t!” Yusuke snapped. “They can’t just put that in there for any nosy bastard to read—”</p>
<p>“Those events are a matter of historical importance to the wizarding world. A turning point for them. The end of the long and destructive reign of a tyrant,” Minamino lectured, his voice still infuriatingly calm.</p>
<p>“That woman wasn’t my mother,” Yusuke snapped. “They can’t even get their fucking facts right.”</p>
<p>He moved off Minamino, glowering at him as he pressed his back to the window. “The woman the Dark Lord murdered was my aunt,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“Huh,” Minamino said thoughtfully as he brought the book back to his lap. “Someone should perhaps inform the author of this book so they can correct the error.”</p>
<p>Yusuke really, really wanted to punch him in that moment as Minamino stared down at the book in his hand, his brow furrowed.</p>
<p>What an asshole.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t really matter, does it, though?” Kuwabara asked. “Most people aren’t even going to bother reading that book.” At Minamino’s pointed look, he stammered, “Ah, no offence. But…”</p>
<p>The trio fell into an uneasy silence as Yusuke glowered at both of them. Minamino was staring down at his book, face flushed as he rubbed his fingertips along the cover. Kuwabara’s eyes were skating from side-to-side as if he couldn’t work out where to rest them.</p>
<p>The door to the compartment slid open.</p>
<p>“Snacks, boys?”</p>
<p>Kuwabara shot to his feet at the friendly greeting from the young woman pushing a trolley along the corridor.</p>
<p>“Yes. Definitely,” he said, fumbling in his pockets.</p>
<p>Minamino’s eyes remained down, his posture rigid. Yusuke began to feel guilty. Maybe he’d overreacted.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportunity to perhaps salvage the situation, he shoved his hand into his pocket and offered Kuwabara a handful of coins.</p>
<p>Kuwabara blinked at him in confusion.</p>
<p>“I’m not really familiar with that stuff,” Yusuke said, gesturing to the colourful and unfamiliar packaging of the sweets. “Just pick what you think we’ll all like.”</p>
<p>Minamino glanced up, brow still furrowed.</p>
<p>“Not for me, thank you,” he said stiffly. “I have no wizarding money with me right now.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Yusuke said. “That should be enough for all of us, right, Kuwabara?”</p>
<p>Kuwabara nodded as he counted out the coins Yusuke had handed him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s plenty,” he said. “Thanks, man.”</p>
<p>Nothing like a little money to buy friendship, Yusuke thought wryly. Now he’d have to try to not fuck it up again. He couldn’t afford to use money to placate everyone if he continued to piss them off at his usual rate. Even the vault in Gringotts didn’t hold enough currency for that.</p>
