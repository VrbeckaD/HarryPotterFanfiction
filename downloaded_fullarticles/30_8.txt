  <b>1992 | Marauder Mansion, Borough of Islington, London</b>
</p>
<p>Cheerful laughter resonated through the halls of a magically concealed building where a grim home once stood. A red rubber ball came from around one corner, bouncing off the parallel walls before rolling to a stop. A large black blur suddenly sped by and lunged to trap the bouncy toy within the grasp of its jaws. It was Sirius, though his current form was more so known as Padfoot. He faced the end of the hallway and sat back, patiently waiting for his companion. This happened to be Ashley, his precious Bambi, who praised him like he wanted her to for winning their game of fetch. She laughed and gave him a belly rub when he flopped down on his back. Feeling satisfied, he eventually stood and padded away with her trailing behind him. He bounded into the living room area where he was met with an exasperated Remus. The werewolf had warned the Animagus time and time again that he was to play outside where there was proper space. However, Remus visibly lost his frown, it being replaced by a soft smile, when he caught sight of their ever so lovely cub.</p>
<p>"Bambi, what have I told the two of you?" He chided, attempting to school his expression.</p>
<p>"To not play inside... Sorry, Remy. We got a bit bored." Ashley grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>"...How can I ever stay mad at you?" Remus sighed, fondly gazing at her.</p>
<p>He watched the fascinating way her eyes lit up with joy as she beamed. That response was always so fascinating; no matter how much it happened around him. If he was asked to name his most favorite feature of Ashley's, it'd be them, her eyes. Oh, those brilliant eyes of hers. They spoke volumes of her emotions. When she was happy, they brightened tenfold than their typical glow. When she was sad, they dimmed in color with no spark to be found. When she was mad... Now, <em>that</em> was definitely a sight that never failed to enrapture those who were fortunate (or if the anger was aimed at them, <em>unfortunate</em>) enough to witness the phenomenon. Killing Curse green eyes, already intimidating with its odd, bright shade, gained a threatening blaze in them paired with a murderous look that could wither the confidence of even the fiercest Death Eater, maybe Voldemort himself. And just imagine during that, her aura radiated with the power nobody would expect from such a young girl. It made <em>Moony</em> shiver, even though he was well aware that his cub would never hurt him any way, shape, or form. Her eyes made her an open book for everyone to read. Well, everyone who paid attention to their changes, that is.</p>
<p>"Remy?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"When are we leaving?"</p>
<p>Right... Remus knew he forgot <em>something</em>. The three of them, along with the rest of the Weasleys plus Mitchelle, were to travel to the Romanian dragon sanctuary where the second eldest Weasley child worked. After that, Ashley and Mitchelle were spending a whole seven days staying at the Burrow. Both Sirius and Remus had wanted to complain but they didn't want to stop their Bambi from spending time and having fun with her friends just because they would miss her terribly. It was only one week after all, what was that compared to the rest of her life (not counting her six years left at Hogwarts)? She lived with them, and she would always come home to them.</p>
<p>"Not for a while longer. Have you got everything you need for the week?"</p>
<p>"Yep, all packed."</p>
<p>It had been a hassle to get everything ready but Ashley had managed. Her wardrobe size had increased drastically. She had more clothes that she could ever want, and they all were newly bought. She also had new glasses which resembled her past ones. This was all due to the minor accident she had while talking with her soul-bonded. She had let her secret slip about her transfigured hand-me-downs. That had inspired a very...<em>colorful</em> rant from Sirius. Ashley had learnt many useful words that day, words that had unquestionably described the Dursleys and Dumbledore fully.</p>
<p>After his speech, Sirius had dragged her and Remus to Muggle London to shop, inviting Alyssa and Mitchelle to join them. Remus had attempted to reel Sirius in but the werewolf himself had wanted to spoil the Potter Heiress just as much. There was nothing she could have done to stop them though she hadn't really complained much, to be honest. She deeply appreciated their efforts of making up for the lost years. She also couldn't deny that she had fun on the trip. It was...comforting to do something so <em>simple</em> for once.</p>
<p>Shopping with Alyssa and Mitchelle wasn't a new thing to Ashley. It had been an activity they'd enjoyed in the past. The case was, there was all so much excitement with their new world. It was overwhelming at times; Ashley hadn't <em>completely</em> adjusted even though it seemed like it. After all those months, there were still so much of the unknown, and she didn't like not knowing. Granted that the domesticity of being with Sirius and Remus eased her heart and mind, but there were still days where she'd wonder what would have happened had she not made that one wish. Admittedly, she tended to think about a lot of 'what if's. However, she couldn't find it in herself to regret her actions. They led her to a life where she was wanted and loved. It was a pretty damn good upgrade from her life back in her old reality.</p>
<p>"Bambi, it's time to go!" Sirius called out, minutes after the afternoon meal.</p>
<p>"I'll be right there!" Ashley replied.</p>
<p>She shrunk her trunk, stuffing it into her trusty satchel, before glancing upwards at her bedroom's ceiling where her familiar was casually resting. Wordlessly, she waved her fingers and let her magic wrap around him. She caught him as he fell in his larger-than-usual form. They were going to be surrounded by family and friends; it was fine if Moko was visible. Neither individual, especially Ashley, would mind if the community found out she was a Parselmouth anyway. Well, as long as she wasn't featured on tabloids which would paint her in a bad light, which was highly unlikely. The Lovegoods were undoubtedly on her side and her deal with Rita included keeping her reputation pure and untainted.</p>
<p>With Moko lying across her shoulders imitating a scarf, Ashley made her way out of her room and down the stairs to the fireplace. She approached her soul-bonded and took hold of a handful of Floo powder. Floo was their only way of quick transportation since the sanctuary had anti-apparition wards erected around the area to fend off smugglers and hunters from getting in. Thus, the sanctuary's Floo channel was temporarily open for the scheduled visitors.</p>
<p>Remus was the first to step through the green fire. Ashley and Sirius followed closely. Stumbling through the other side, they brushed off the excess ashes on their clothing before observing their surroundings. They were in an office where Charlie stood waiting for them. There was also another man beside him who Ashley assumed was the head of the sanctuary. He introduced himself as Matthew and she had gotten his position right. He dismissed the lot of them with Charlie who led them outside to the rest of their company. Greetings were exchanged before a tour of the whole area was given. It was quite a long tour, the sanctuary was a <em>huge</em> place, but it was so worth it. The children were awed by the different dragons that could be seen all around.</p>
<p>
  <em>I wonder where my little hatchling is...</em>
</p>
<p>Speaking of which, there she was, Norberta, and she was no longer the little hatchling Ashley knew. Much, <em>much</em> larger than the last time the Potter Heiress saw her, Norberta was almost the size of a full grown dragon of her species. Surely in a few weeks time she would be. Ashley all but ran to her, dragging Sirius and Remus along with her. Charlie would have stopped them if he hadn't known that they were the people the fussy dragon recognized as her family.</p>
<p>"<em>Mother, you're here!</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Well, I did promise that I'd visit again.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes, yes, I know! But I still missed you, mother...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I missed you too, hatchling. I'm sorry I can't come as often as I want to.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Why can't I just go home with you and your mates?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I-well...</em>"</p>
<p>Ashley was pretty sure that sneaking a dragon home was highly illegal. Although, so was associating with the Dark Lord. Breaking laws certainly wasn't the problem. Sirius and Remus wouldn't mind. Well, they actually would, Remus more so than Sirius, but per Alyssa's words, they were wrapped around Ashley's little finger. They would do anything to keep her happy, and it helped that they were fond of her hatchling. Norberta's size could be easily fixed by a simple <em>Reducio</em>. But then there was the subject of her diet which consisted of large mammals and water-dwelling creatures. She could be fed fish but Ashley doubted she would like feeding on <em>just</em> fish every day. It was better, safer, and healthier if Norberta stayed at the sanctuary. Plus, Ashley was bound to head back to Hogwarts and she couldn't let herself be caught with a dragon on school grounds.</p>
<p>She explained her reasoning with Norberta who grumbled but gave in. Ashley, Sirius, and Remus spent the rest of their given time with the dragon. The entirety of the group joined them since Norberta was, so far, the most domesticated in the sanctuary, even if she was a bit moody without her mother around. The other dragons still had tendencies to burn the keepers. Charlie didn't want to risk anyone's lives for their own amusement. Although near the end of their visit, he had allowed them to experience a hatching. The Golden Trio had already seen the event once but it was still undeniably remarkable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they had to leave after that. Charlie had to go back to work, along with Bill and Arthur. As painful as it was, Ashley separated from her soul-bonded and followed the Weasleys to their humble abode. The moment she came through the Floo, she felt someone grab her hand and pull. It was Alyssa, and she tugged her and Mitchelle outside the Burrow. Ashley gasped at the beautiful countryside that greeted her and hurriedly dug into her satchel for her camera. It was an item she never left home without, along with her wand, her charm bracelet, her mirror, her Gringotts pouch, and Moko, of course. She captured pictures of the grassy land visible beyond the boundaries of the Weasley home and turned to do the same with the actual house.</p>
<p>Even with the riches they had procured, the Weasleys stayed unpretentious. The Burrow still looked the exact same way except for the necessary rooms that had been added. Ashley hadn't seen those the last time she'd visited, nor had she been really paying attention, too caught up with celebrating Christmas, to actually notice the new renovations to the tower-like home. Molly and Arthur preferred to spend their money on their children instead of fixing something, their house in this case, that wasn't really broken. They loved their home as it was. And so, the only changes were that each of their children, except for the twins, now had their own rooms, even Bill and Charlie for when they came to stay (as rare as that was). Less than a dozen pictures later, Molly called the three girls back inside. She announced that, as expected, they would be sharing Alyssa's room together.</p>
<p>"Go ahead and get settled, dears. I'll call you down for dinner. In the meantime, why don't you have some brownies?"</p>
<p>Molly then offered a plate full of chocolate brownies that just smelled absolutely <em>divine</em>. Ashley nearly drooled and in the corner of her eyes, she took note of the twins' similar reactions mixed with a healthy dose of envy. It was highly reasonable. Molly wasn't one to boast but the twins were. They explicitly told the whole Gryffindor House that their mum's baking were the ambrosia of the gods. Ashley hadn't tasted the brownies yet but she was about ready to agree.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Aunt Molly." She thanked, seeing as her friends had already left her behind.</p>
<p>"You're very welcome. Run along now." Molly urged, before heading back into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"How come you get brownies?" The twins whined.</p>
<p>"I'm her favorite." Ashley jested.</p>
<p>"Fair enough, but you're our favorite too."</p>
<p>"And...?"</p>
<p>Fred and George pouted expectantly at the Potter Heiress, frequently glancing at the plate held between her hands. She giggled and conceded two brownies to their mute begging. They cheered and finally let her past, but not without giving her identical hugs. She happily accepted them and proceeded to search for her current sleeping quarters. She didn't actually know where Alyssa's room was but she figured the room with the most noise was it. She was right.</p>
<p>Upon entering, she froze at the sight that greeted her. She crossed her arms and leaned against the doorframe, waiting for her friends to notice her presence. Once they did, they scrambled to hide the evidence of what they had been caught doing. They both smiled innocently, wearing different poses that Ashley figured were their attempt at acting normal.</p>
<p>"Were you using your mirrors to chat with your soul-bonded?" She deadpanned, making sure to keep her amusement at bay.</p>
<p>"No..." Mitchelle and Alyssa chorused, suddenly refusing to make eye contact with her.</p>
<p>"<em>Emergencies</em>, I said." Ashley scolded half-heartedly.</p>
<p>"It <em>was</em> an emergency!" Mitchelle defended.</p>
<p>"Really?" Ashley raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Okay, no," Mitchelle backtracked, "but it's <em>convenient</em>!"</p>
<p>"You have <em>owls</em>." Ashley countered, letting her smile show so that her friends knew she hadn't been upset.</p>
<p>"Let's change the subject, shall we?"</p>
<p>"Oh alright, fine."</p>
<p>Ashley plopped down on the bed that was set up for her, placed on Alyssa's left near the door, and shed her satchel. She retrieved her trunk and flicked her wrist to enlarge it, levitating it to the end of her bed. She listened to the idle chatter in the room as she placed her charmed mirror on the nightstand and removed her boots. She brought her legs up on the mattress and found a comfortable way to sit, laying Moko down on her pillow, before joining her friends' conversation. They avoided the topics of anything related to their hidden agenda regarding Voldemort since they all knew they had no progress to talk about. They had already discussed their plans about gathering the Horcruxes but aside from that, they had nothing. The Tree of Life was still a mystery they hadn't yet solved.</p>
<p>Nobody could blame them. They literally had one book to rely on, and it held no specific instructions on how to find the bloody tree. Ashley had tried everything. She approached the goblins, she scanned through every single book in the Black library, and she had even sent a letter to Rita Skeeter to search for any useful information. In the end, Ashley came up with nothing. It was infuriating, to say the least, but what did she honestly expect? She was on the hunt for something that was considered a myth. <em>Of course</em> it would be difficult.</p>
<p>
  <em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em>
</p>
<p>The tapping noise echoed through the room and startled the three girls. Confused, they simultaneously gazed at its unanticipated source. A black-banded owl was perched on the windowsill, pecking incessantly at the glass pane. A moment of silence passed as the three girls decided who was going to face the owl and get the letter. Ashley volunteered and stood up, hesitantly making her way to the window.</p>
<p>"Were...any of you expecting letters?"</p>
<p>"Not me."</p>
<p>"Not that I know of, no."</p>
<p>"Then who the hell...?"</p>
<p>
  <em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em>
</p>
<p>The owl seemed to glare at Ashley as it impatiently waited for the window to be opened. She blinked and slowly complied, taking the parchment from the owl's beak. Then, an odd thing happened. The owl hissed at Ashley, <em>hissed</em>, and flapped its wings in an irritated manner. She swore she had just been insulted. Wide-eyed, she apologized for keeping the owl waiting. It hissed one last time before flying away and leaving her flabbergasted.</p>
<p>"Did... Did that owl just hiss?"</p>
<p>"Uh, yeah, I think so."</p>
<p>"...What does the letter say?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, let's find out."</p>
<p>Ashley unfolded the piece of parchment paper as she settled on Alyssa's bed, squished in-between the redhead and Mitchelle. Ashley let her eyes wander over the words as her friends read over her shoulders.</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>Potter,</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>Diagon Alley, 12:00 noon, tomorrow. It's time we discuss things.</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>- <b><em>T.R</em></b></p>
<p>Well, Ashley certainly hadn't expected <em>that</em>. She wasn't stupid, she knew who T.R was. But why would the Dark Lord want to talk to her? That...was a dumb question, she knew exactly why. Voldemort probably wanted an update on how her plans were going. Her answer would be that it was...going. Alyssa and Mitchelle proposed that they should accompany her but she declined. It would be a hassle if all three of them went. Also, Molly would notice. It was better if Ashley went by herself. She could apparate away if it was a trap. She'd been practicing a lot back at the mansion since apparition was needed. She wasn't the best at it, there was a big chance she would splinch herself, but she was willing to take her chances. It wasn't likely that Voldemort would hurt her, not that much, at least.</p>
<p>Well, it seemed like a trip to Diagon Alley was in order.</p>
