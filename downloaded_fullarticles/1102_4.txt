    <p>Severus Snape was a tormented man, with a dark past and an uncertain future. He watched his friends die, on both sides of the war and made many mistakes. There was no light inside the bleak and dark interior, swirling in stony cold black holes that seemed to suck the life out of everything.</p><p>Until Harry Potter.</p><p>He had let his bitter thoughts brew for ten years, expecting to be able to release them on a young, arrogant, spoilt James Potter Jnr. He was ready to hate the boy, hate him with a passion.</p><p>But he had her eyes.</p><p>He had those bright emerald eyes that plagued every dream, every nightmare, and every happy memory. He had <em>her</em> cheek, and <em>her</em> nose and<em> her</em> temper even if he didn’t know it. He had all her good qualities. It took him a year, multiple life threatening situations and a letter that wasn’t meant to fall into his hands for him to realise – he had severely misjudged his character.</p><p>He began to look closer, after that, watching the interactions and looking for the signs. He didn’t want to find them, but he did; The flinches when someone shouted, the seeking of approval even when he didn’t need it, the measly meals and the way he couldn’t take a praise as though he didn’t think he deserved it and how he wouldn’t meet his eyes. The signs of abuse.</p><p>It was only however it was only at the end of his first year did Severus collect enough evidence and enough of his own courage to step in. The boy looked as though the world was ending when Severus brought him to his private quarters to see Madam Bones, and for a moment Severus <em>felt</em> as if the world was ending when someone recommended<em> him </em>as guardian.</p><p>But that was how it ended, with Harry Potter becoming the ward of the potions master.</p><p>It was kept a secret from the press and the students of Hogwarts – even his own Godson didn’t know, mainly because Lucius was bound to hear of it if he did and Severus didn’t want to risk their lives.</p><p>They had their ups and downs, screaming and shouting, hexes and slamming doors, crying and hugging, laughing and actually having fun.</p><p>But there was one moment that Severus would always remember, with its own fair share of good and bad, was the time he called him Dad.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"....Does everyone understand?"</p><p>It was a cloudy evening in the middle of January, the wind was icy against their faces and rain clouds were rolling in. They clutched their brooms hard as another gust of wind threatened to knock them down. As usual, the only team mad enough to be out in this weather was the Gryffindor Quidditch Team and that was all thanks to their fanatical team Captain - Oliver Wood. </p><p>The Dementors had been taken back to Azkaban after Crookshanks the cat had captured Peter Pettigrew in the Great Hall, forcing the rat to transform in front of everyone, twenty four hours later Sirius Black was cleared of all charges. Twelve Years in Azkaban for an innocent man meant he was holed up in St Mungo's whilst they assessed his mental and physical stability as thoroughly as possible, this meant the only visitors that had been allowed to see him were Remus Lupin and Albus Dumbledore. </p><p>Because of the lack of Dementor's, nobody hesitated to get back into the normal swing of things, which of course resulted in a fights every few weeks on who would get the Quidditch Pitch. As December and the cold weather swept in only Wood was mental enough to take them out, at least until McGonagall had physically had to ban the obsessed boy from the stadium until after Christmas. This in itself was a bad idea, mostly because Wood spent the majority of the holidays holed up in his dormitory planning hundreds of different tactics. </p><p>Every other member of the team really wished that ban had gone on for longer. </p><p>The rain began to trickle down as they perfected their moves, pushing through the icy water running down their necks and drenching their clothes. This meant there were bound to be problems, for one Fred almost crashed into the stands - twice - Alicia was struck in the face with the Quaffle and even Oliver himself was struggling to stay on his broom and yell orders through the chattering of his teeth. At ten in the evening he finally relented, looking close to tears as he landed and scowling up at the sky as though it had betrayed them. </p><p>Harry sighed, pushing wet bangs from his eyes and letting out a small huff of relief when he entered the changing rooms, letting the warm air wash over him like a blanket. He made his way across the slippery floor, trying and failing to keep as much mud out as possible. Oliver had already disappeared to the showers and Angelina wasn't far behind, a shivering mess. Fred and George collapsed down upon the benches, their faces set in a grim line and attempting to pull their shirts over their heads clumsily. </p><p>"We need a..." The rest of Fred's words were muffled as he began his battle with his Quidditch Robes so George finished for him "A team meeting without Oliver" He stood and reached over to help Fred, yanking the red and gold uniform from his damp stature and almost slipping backwards as he did so. </p><p>"Agr-r-reeed" Katie nodded, interrupted by a large yawn, rubbing her eyes, dark brown hair falling across her face as she blushed with embarrassment. For once however it seemed the Twin's were too tired to make a joke, though the young chaser knew it wouldn't last long. </p><p>Harry was only half listening as he stripped down and changed, shivering as he peeled is sopping clothes from his body and was left vulnerable to the draft seeping in through the crack beneath the door. Slowly one, by one they all left, Oliver giving him a dejected smile that was more like a grimace and Angelina shaking her head, attempting to shake the water from her hair. He took his time, making sure to knock as much of the mud from his boots as possible so Filch wouldn't murder him and only breathing a sigh of relief once he was back in his dry clothes.</p><p> He flung his kit over his shoulder and grabbed his broom, shivering as he stepped out into the cold night, it was just his luck he had left his hoodie slung over the back on an armchair in the Common Room, he had been too busy trying to get his Transfiguration homework done. Oliver had been working them so hard since he had been allowed back on to the pitch he barely had time for homework if he didn't want to stay up till three in the morning every other day. </p><p>It was still raining as he hurried up towards the castle, ducking under every bit of shelter he could find and using his already soaking robes as a shield as best he could. It was nice to get back into the castle, to the light and the familiar stone walls with no worry about the rain. He made his way towards Gryffindor Tower, avoiding Filch and Flitwick as he did so. Technically he wasn't meant to be out this late, though her was some leeway for Quidditch Practice as it was known to overrun, especially close to the new season, however he knew it must be at least 11 by now, if not later and he doubted that would be accepted. </p><p>His shoulders sagged in relief as he reached the Fat Lady, murmuring the password and climbing inside. His once dry shirt was now damp despite his intuitive use of shield, but he didn't even notice as he stepped inside the common room. There was a crackling fire in the hearth, sending waves of warmth across the common room and the light of the flames danced across the red walls in a sort of soothing way, that was comforting even on the days you were sick of seeing red or just having a bad time.</p><p>He barely noticed as he slid down into the armchair, his Quidditch Robes toppling from his arms and onto the floor by his feet, instead choosing to pull his favourite bottle green hoodie from behind him over his head, ignoring the t-shirt sticking to his torso and his hair still dripping with rainwater, choosing to kick off his shoes and curl up, hood offering a sort of barrier to the outside world and he lay there, watching the flames dance carelessly in the fire. </p><p>He could just make out the quiet pop signalling the arrival of a house elf, eyes opening and closing drowsily with each passing moment. Harry knew he should go up to the dorm but he really didn't want to move and he could just make out a hazy figure picking up his robes. He gave a sleepy smile "Th'nk y'u" He mumbled, face half pressed into the inside of his hood, unsure if the small creature had heard him but it was too much effort to speak any louder. He left himself drift off, arms wrapped around his body, adorably sunk back into the pillows with thick woollen socks he always wore after practice.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry awoke in time with the birds, eyes fluttering open slowly regaining his senses. He was still in the armchair, curled up in a similar position to that he remembered falling asleep in and he raised his hand to his face, rubbing his eyes. His body was stiff and achy, nothing unusual really as he sat up, pushing himself out of the chair and running a hand through his bedraggled state called he called hair. The fire had long since gone out, leaving him somewhat chilly in the dark room and he stumbled up to the dormitory.</p><p>He crept inside, well aware the rest of the boys were asleep and pulled his hoodie off and t-shirt off, shivering at the sudden exposure. He yanked off the rest of his clothes leaving them in a pile beside his bed and climbing beneath the sheets, not bothering with pyjamas. He rolled over, giving a side glance towards his watch which lay balanced on his bedside table with the clock face towards him. He could just make out what it read - 5:30am. </p><p>He sighed, grimacing as he noticed how stiff his hair was, silently berating himself for letting it dry without at least brushing it. Despite climbing into bed he knew he was less likely to go back to sleep, it was an annoying habit he had picked up at the Dursley's and couldn't get rid of. His eyes however seemed to have a different plan to his brain and began to close, forcing him into a light sleep, waking up at every noise for the next two hours. </p><p>"Time to get up guys"</p><p>If he could be bothered, he would've thrown a pillow at Dean and his annoying chirpy attitude, but he didn't need to, grinning slightly at the muffled oomph that followed and guessed it was either Ron or Seamus. The quick friendly scuffle that followed confirmed his thoughts, as the two best friends rolled around between their beds until the Irish lad pinned his friends to the ground. Harry didn't need to look to know this, they did it almost every morning and the rest of their year in Gryffindor had a bet going -how long would it take before they admitted their ever growing feelings for each other. So far, Hermione and Neville were the only ones out of the running and this bet had been going since first year. </p><p>He forced his eyes to open, glaring at the ceiling for a moment before sitting up, rubbing his eyes. His redhead best friend yawned loudly and stumbled out of bed, peering blearily around for a moment, taking in his surrounding before groaning and flopping back down. </p><p>"I hate Thursdays" He moaned, lanky body have sprawled off the edge of the bed, hair sticking up in all directions. Nobody bothered to ask why, there could be any number of reasons for him to hate Thursdays different from last week and they didn't want to hear the list, though to be fair to his best friend, they all did that. </p><p>"Only one more day till Friday" Harry replied lightly, attempting to sort out his hair without looking in the mirror. Ron sat up and raised an eyebrow out him. </p><p>"What time did you get to bed? You look like you've barley slept at all" Dean and Seamus wandered out, still mucking about, and attempting to hop around putting their socks and shoes on before they got downstairs. Neville disappeared into the bathroom, leaving them alone for a few moments. </p><p>"Dunno, midnight maybe?" He shrugged nonchalantly, starting to get dressed. It wasn't the first time and it wouldn't be the last he had stayed up that late and with the way Wood was working them there was bound to be some sleepless nights coming up. Ron frowned, following his friends lead and tugging his trousers on. </p><p>"Did you get McGonagalls homework finished?"</p><p>He froze, hands stilling over his tie before he collapsed back down on the bed. Goddammit. </p><p>Ron winced, blue eyes torn between exasperation and sympathy and he began stuffing all his things into his bag. </p><p>"She's going to kill me" He groaned, absentmindedly pulling on his shoes and running a comb through his hair. Ron disappeared from the room in search of the Charms homework he was given an extension on yet still ended up doing that night before and Harry slipped into the bathroom as Neville watered the small plant on his bedside table Hermione had gifted him with for Christmas. </p><p>Harry glanced in the mirror, making sure his hair looked less like a birds nest and grimacing at the dark smudges beneath his eyes. Severus was bound to notice, and that usually meant trouble, especially when he thought Harry had neglected his needs. He rubbed his eyes, scrubbing his face with one hand and yawning, before splashing water across his face. He watched the droplets of water trickle down his face, like trailing patterns twisting and falling. </p><p> </p><p>"Morning boy's" Hermione smiled, sliding on to the wooden bench with her book filled bag making a clunk as it hit the floor beneath the table and began helping herself to some pancakes, drizzling maple syrup calmly ignoring the stares she was receiving from her best mates. She glanced up as he replaced the jug of syrup back in it's original spot and paused, finally taking in the shock on their faces. "What?"</p><p>"Have you got rocks in your bag or something??" Ron exclaimed, fork halfway to his mouth, sausage long forgotten. Harry snickered and took a sip of apple juice. As breakfast continued he began to notice an uncomfortable annoyance in the back of his throat as he swallowed, but easily ignored it, instead focusing on Katie who lay half asleep in her bowl of cereal. He reached over and gently shook her awake, watching her head come shooting up with wide eyes.</p><p>"No more Quidditch!"</p><p>It was slightly slurred as she stared blearily around, rubbing her eyes and blinking comically. </p><p>"Katie maybe you should get a Pepper Up Potion from Madam Pomfrey" Harry chuckled lightly as concern washed over his emerald eyes and the girl he had come to see as a sister nodded slowly, looking somewhat out of it all. </p><p>"I'll take her to the Infirmary" Angelina offered, wrapping an arm around Katie's shoulders and guiding her out of the hall. Alicia leaned over, ignoring the squeak from a startled Colin Creevey as she almost put her arm in his plate and murmured "Team meeting tonight at seven, don't tell Ollie"</p><p>Harry did feel bad for the young Captain, who was just trying to do what he thought would help them win and seeing he resigned face and how all the happiness would fall from it every time there was a bad practice made him feel worse knowing he was part of the reason for the other boy's sadness. Hermione waved her hand in his face, making him jump momentarily as he was startled from his thoughts and noticed everyone standing up. She rolled her eyes yet watched him narrowly</p><p>"What time did Wood have you out till?"</p><p>She asked as they headed from the hall, towards their first lesson - Charms. Harry shrugged nonchalantly as Ron relayed what he had told him that morning, only really half listening, searching through his bag to make sure he had the admittedly unfinished piece of homework for McGongalls lesson after Charms. </p><p>"...You can't let him be the reason you’re up so late!"</p><p>He tuned in as Hermione finished her rant, catching Ron staring blankly ahead, obviously he wasn't listening either. Harry opened his mouth to reply when a sharp voice cut in, making all three and the surrounding students jump. </p><p>"Potter, a word" He swallowed, ignoring the scratchy feeling from before and followed his guardian into an unused classroom, wondering what he had done wrong now as he locked the door. Severus stared as his ward, arms crossed over his chest in a rather menacing position. </p><p>"What have I told you about staying up so late?"</p><p>Harry sighed to himself, inwardly rolling his eyes, so this was what it was all about. </p><p> "Sorry Sir, Quidditch overran-"</p><p>"That's not the point Harry. You know how I feel about that" Severus said, frowning. They still had appearances to keep, just encase some fifth year unlocked the door or took down the silencing charms. </p><p>"I know but-"</p><p>"Your health is more important than some silly game"</p><p>"I know it's just-"</p><p>"I don't want it to happen again, understood?"</p><p>"What the hell do you expect me to do?! I'm not going to miss practice because you think I'm some toddler with an eight o clock bedtime!"</p><p>He snapped, temper rising sharply, letting the words explode from his mouth. Snape looked taken aback and raised an eyebrow. </p><p>"Sorry, I didn't mean to snap, I'm just...." Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, turning his gaze to the wall and letting his shoulders slump slightly. </p><p>"Tired?" Severus finished lightly though there was a flash of annoyance underneath. He understood as his ward got older he would become a moody teenager but he had at least hoped it wouldn't start for another year or so. </p><p>Harry dropped his eyes to the floor with a half-hearted shrug and Severus pinched the bridge of his nose, he could feel a headache coming on and he hadn’t even started the morning lessons.</p><p>“Look, head to class, we’ll talk about this later”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry clutched the slip of parchment tightly as he made his way up the steps, footsteps echoing in the silent corridors. His bag bumped lightly against his leg as he sped up, well aware if he were to be caught by Peeves now he would never make it to Charms class and that would cause even more problems.  </p><p>
  <em>“Heh’tchoo!”</em>
</p><p><em><br/> </em>He stopped, freezing in place as he sneezed, blinking in shock and raising his elbow to his face, feeling a persistent tickle.</p><p>
  <em>“Heh-Kchc! Hechch! He...he...Hetchoo!”</em>
</p><p>He shook his head, sniffing and rubbing his nose lightly, lips twisting in a downward frown as he stared around the corridor.</p><p>“This place needs dusting” He mumbled, easily chalking it up to his surroundings, after all once he had walked into a broom cupboard and spent the next hour with a cloth pressed to his face as he searched for something, to avoid breathing in the obvious thick layer of dust settled over the shelves and brooms.</p><p>He hurried on, not giving it a second thought as he made his way into class, giving the small Professor the note from Severus and taking a seat. Malfoy grinned at him from across the classroom, this sneer that suggested he knew everything; it was that sort of smirk that riled him up even if Draco really knew nothing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Is that Detention tonight then Potter?” Was the first thing he heard when they finally escaped the rather stuff classroom. Hermione rolled her eyes and Ron shot the blonde boy a glare, something that amused Harry as he strode past, falling into step beside them.</p><p>“He’s such a prat” Ron growled, a smug laugh bouncing off the walls behind them, encouraged by the other Slytherin Third years.</p><p>“I don’t know what he’s so smug about anyway,” Harry shrugged, smiling slightly, a warm feeling settling in his chest. Because of Dudley he had never known friends before Hogwarts, yet he found he didn’t need whole gang like his cousin or Draco Malfoy, he just needed a couple that gave a damn when nobody else did. “I don’t have detention”</p><p>Ron stopped short, jaw dropping and blue eyes widening. “H-H-How did you do that?” He spluttered, almost tripping over his bag, which had slipped from his arm and collapsed on the floor in front of him. Hermione giggled and rolled her eyes as Ron’s ears turned red from embarrassment and he hastily shouldered his bag.</p><p>“Honestly Ron, Snape can’t give Harry detention for doing nothing wrong”</p><p>“Mione, this is Snape we are talking about”</p><p>They continued to bicker about Snape’s attitude and agenda as they made their way to Transfiguration, and Harry listened silently, somewhat oddly comforted by their normality. After Severus became his Guardian, everything changed; he saw a new side to the Potion’s Master he had never seen before and they had opened up to each other in ways they never thought they could. A part of him ached to defend his father figure, yet he knew he couldn’t compromise Severus, especially if Ron and Hermione didn’t take it well, that’s why they were careful to act like they hated each other during school. Sometimes that was a good thing, it meant they didn’t have a hundred and one awkward explanations, nor did Harry have to worry about the reactions of the student population. Other times it was irritating, the man made it so easy to get mad at him that they often ended the evenings in arguments, slipping into their old attitude as if they really did hate each other. When that happened it was hard, hard to know if he was really wanted or if it was just because Severus had a thing for his mother.</p><p>He shook himself from his thoughts and made his way into Transfiguration, sliding into his usual seat next to Ron and pulling out his partially finished essay. He was really hoping she had forgotten, after all as Deputy Headmistress, Head of Gryffindor House and Transfiguration Professor she had a lot of work to do.</p><p>“I hope you all have your homework, I do not want to be assigning detentions”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Brilliant. Just Brilliant. </em>
