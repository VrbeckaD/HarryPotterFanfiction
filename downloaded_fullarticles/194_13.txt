  <em>"McLaggin!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The handsome young man turned, startled at first but quickly sported a grin to rival the cheshire cat at the sight of who called his name.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Yes Granger?" He said, cockily.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione fought back a frustrated sigh, "How would you like to come with me to Slughorn's party?" She asked.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Finally come to your senses eh?" Cormac grinned. "Well, I accept." </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Thank Merlin for that, it wasn't so bad.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Meet me there at 8pm sharp, oh and, wear something nice will you?" </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Aaaannddddd he ruined it. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione merely nodded and left, fearing that she would say something scathing to scare the man off. At least it was sure to make Ron mad.</em>
</p><hr/><p>And that, was how Hermione hoped it would go. Time would only tell, potions didn't end for another hour and after that she had double charms. Her chance wouldn't come until later that night, which was fine by her. The more she could put this off the better. Even thinking about having to spend an evening with that man made Hermione want to throw up. Did she really have to do this? Was making Ron jealous that important to her? A small, evil part of her brain shouted <em>yes! </em>as loud as it could, while the rational side took over. </p><p>
  <em>There's no way you can go through an entire evening with that git, he'll grope you countless times over until the night is up. Besides, being petty just isn't you!</em>
</p><p>Grudgingly, she had to concede the point. But who to take? </p><p>"Ms. Granger?"</p><p>Startled by Slughorn's voice, she nearly knocked her entire potion over on the floor, a few snickers from the Slytherin's could be heard in the corner of the classroom. </p><p>Blushing, she answered, "Y-yes, sir?" </p><p>"Well I was merely asking about the benefits of adding cowbane to your potion?" The professor said. </p><p>
  <em>Oh no! She wasn't paying attention to what she was doing at all! </em>
</p><p>"Er, well you see Professor, my head must have been elsewhere, I honestly don't know what I was thinking." Hermione said, trying to explain herself.</p><p>"Indeed." Slughorn said sadly, a trace of disappointment in his voice. </p><p>Well that put a damper on her mood a bit, but her spirits lifted slightly at Harry's concerned look. </p><p>"Are you alright?" He asked, emerald eyes swimming with worry. </p><p>Smiling a little despite her screw up, she nodded at him. </p><p>And then it came to her.</p><p>She should ask <em>Harry. </em>Yes, that was perfect. Sweet, kind Harry. Surely he'd say yes. Purely as friends, of course. Besides, Hermione figured taking <em>any </em>boy would royally piss Ron off, so it was a win win. She would have an enjoyable night with a friend, and make another jealous. </p><p>Her smile grew just a tad, and Harry turned away to focus back on his potion, which of course was flawless thanks to the Prince's help. The rest of the day was a blur for Hermione until dinner, but when it came, it brought an unusual feeling to Hermione. </p><p>She was <em>nervous. </em>Hermione was rarely nervous, so when it did happen, it threw her off like nothing else could. This was <em>ridiculous, </em>it was only Harry. </p><p><em>A Harry who's certainly grown in all the right places. </em>A treacherous part of her mind said.</p><p><em>Shut up. </em>She told it. </p><hr/><p>Dinner was eventful to say the least; there was nothing particular out of the ordinary, the Great Hall was as noisy as ever, Ron was currently stuffing his face, all was normal. And then it happened, out of the corner of his eye, he spotted one Hermione Granger marching towards the table with a look of determination on her face.</p><p>No, towards <em>him</em>. </p><p>What did he do to deserve this?</p><p>She stopped right in front of him, which caused a few of the other Gryffindors to shoot odd looks at the two of them.</p><p>"Harry," she began sweetly. (Since when did Hermione talk like this?) "With Slughorn's party coming up, and seeing as neither of us have a date, I was wondering if you'd like to accompany me to it?" </p><p>He noticed her sweet facade falter slightly when he didn't answer immediately, "That is, if you want to of course, I know you hate these sort of things, I just figured you'd rather go with someone you know, seeing as you have no Quidditch practices scheduled or a meeting with Professor Dumbledore, which I couldn't help but notice, of course." She rambled, bright red by the end of her rant. </p><p>"Of course." He joked, a small smile on his lips. "I'd love to go with you Hermione, it beats having to actually ask someone I barely know." </p><p>Hermione let out a sigh of relief, shoulders sagging. "Oh thank Merlin, I thought for a moment there you'd say no." </p><p>Harry just looked at her with a raised eyebrow, "Say no? Who in their right mind would reject you?" </p><p>The raven haired boy would never know it, but his words made the other girls stomach do a flip. To his question, she did not have an answer, merely another blush, and a mumbled "Thanks."</p><p>A little stunned at the events himself, Harry barely registered the clap on his back from Neville, a "Nice going Harry." accompanying it. He shot a glance at Ron, and at his furious look, Harry merely shrugged. It's not like he <em>wanted </em>to make Ron mad but, Hermione and him had been fighting a lot this year, and the party could be a nice change of pace. Besides, Ron was already going out with Lavender, who was trying (and failing) to recapture her boyfriends attention. He had no reason to be mad at Harry.</p><p>He had a feeling that his meeting with Dumbledore tonight would not compare. </p><hr/><p>"Well Harry, what do you make of it?" </p><p>The young man thought for a moment, eyes never leaving the pensieve. </p><p>"Tom wanted the locket, thought he'd find it there." Harry began. "Once he got what he needed, there was no use to keep Morfin around, so he framed him. Nobody would think twice about it either."</p><p>"Indeed," Albus Dumbledore nodded. <strong>"Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for the murders he had not committed."</strong></p><p>Harry couldn't help but agree with the Headmaster, what Riddle did was cruel, but unsurprising.</p><p>The night went on, the professor explained how he obtained the true memory, why Morfins went black at the end, and how badly Riddle truly set the man up. Finally, Dumbledore gave Harry the important task of securing Slughorn's true memory of what he told a younger Riddle all those years ago. </p><p>"I am unsure whether it would be best to catch him off guard or ease him into it." He told Harry in regards to obtaining the memory. </p><p>"Well, sir, he has a Christmas party coming up and I'm attending. Maybe then?" The younger wizard suggested. </p><p>"Ah yes," Dumbledore mused. "He likes to do that. Yes that could be a possibility, if not to get the memory then to at least get closer to him." He paused briefly before speaking again. "Forgive me Harry but don't you need a date for that particular event?" </p><p>Harry rubbed the back of his neck in slight embarrassment, "Yes sir, but I've already got one."</p><p>"Ah, Miss Weasley?" The older man guessed. </p><p>"Err no, reckon she'd be going with Dean. I'm going with Hermione." Harry explained. </p><p>Albus was confused, as what Harry was saying now conflicted with statements from a previous session, but he wisely didn't speak on it.</p><p>"Miss Granger then? I'm sure that will be an enjoyable evening." He mused. "A word of advice, the mistletoe often appears when one least expects it, I would keep my eyes peeled if I were you."</p><p>Harry blushed but said nothing else, merely nodding in acknowledgment. </p><p>They said their goodbyes, and Harry departed back to his common room. </p><p><em>Oh to be young and in love </em>He thought, a smile on his face. </p><hr/><p>
  <strong>AN</strong>

  <strong>Usually I put these in the notes but when starting a multiple chapter fic I'm still a bit unclear with the notes, having previously had an issue where the end note stuck around on each chapter. For that reason, I'll put it here. </strong>
</p><p><strong>A couple of things, I know that this meeting in the book doesn't happen until the 6th of January, however, as with all my other stories I'll be taking some </strong> <b>liberties with the timeline and certain events. This is meant to be a pretty self contained fic, no huge plot, just two idiots falling in love. So with that, hopefully my shifting of the timeline is excusable. The bolded line that Dumbledore speaks is directly from the book itself, I thought it was quite good, too good to pass up. Plus I'm a tad lazy. Hopefully I didn't mess up any British terms (from the few that I used), I am Canadian, so I wouldn't really know with 100% certainty I'm using them correctly. From what I gathered from the books and other fics, I might be doing decent lol. Finally, I hope the characters are, well, in character. It's hard to know with Harry, or any of the HP characters, for me at least. Hope you all enjoyed and reviews are always appreciated!</b></p><p>
  <strong>P.S I can't totally remember if a date was even required for Slughorn's party, but if it wasn't, I'm making it so. Heh. </strong>
