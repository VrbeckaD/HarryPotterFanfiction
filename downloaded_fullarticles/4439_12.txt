          <div class="userstuff"><p>It’s windy today.</p>
<p>And yet, I’m not cold. I think and nothing else. Even though most people think I’m not capable of it.</p>
<p>Vincent’s got a fever. This morning he told Draco he didn’t really feel like getting up.</p>
<p>He always put up an air of dignity for these occasions. He’s afraid of Draco, of what he may think of him.</p>
<p>I know he just wants to skip Transfiguration, that he doesn’t feel like losing points just because he’s incapable of executing even the simplest spells.</p>
<p>And yet, he pretends to be sick a couple times a month, and for those two mornings he avoids to bear useless humiliations.</p>
<p>Like he, as well as I, could really escape.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten used to this life a long time ago. I’ve got used to feel uncomfortable everywhere, with whomever I am.</p>
<p>I turn to face Hogwarts, my face upwind. The frozen lashes barely touch me, lost as I am in this sort of uneasiness.</p>
<p>This place means everything for most of the people there. I, instead, constantly feel as, once out of here, I won’t have anything to remember, nothing worth keeping in my mind.</p>
<p>From time to time, maybe, I would’ve thought about those days spent behind Draco, like Vincent and I were supposed to catch him, was he to fall.</p>
<p>Everytime someone introduces us or talks about us, we’re tagged as Malfoy’s lackeys. Nobody ever said we’re hid friends, and rightly so.</p>
<p>Draco didn’t think about us like that either, and we knew it all too well. What I’ve been wondering about as of late, is whether or not I consider him a friend.</p>
<p>Is it really a friend someone who didn’t think you are?</p>
<p>Is it really a friend someone convinced you exist just to satisfy his whims of spoilt teen-ager?</p>
<p>I’ve realized that maybe he needs Vince and me more than we need him.</p>
<p>Vincent Crabbe is my friend, and I’m his. This is what we have, and this is enough for us.</p>
<p>All the rest... the war, the Dark Lord, Draco’s tribulations... they’re just a life we see a mere reflection, that doesn’t belong to us, but that we look on as unpaying bystanders.</p>
<p>The only regret I’m gonna have one day, I already know, it’ll be that I’ll have behind me more of other people’s life to tell about than my own.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t matter that much. I stay here in the background with my friend, always lowering my eyes and waiting to get out untouched from this madness, for which I can’t do a thing, not against not in favour of it.</p>
<p>Vince and I watch.</p>
<p>I feel the wind calming down. And my thoughts fade with it.</p>
<p>When I’ll feel it blow again, impetuous, maybe then it’ll be time to act.</p>
<p>Or to wait for others to act on my stead, as usual.</p></div>
