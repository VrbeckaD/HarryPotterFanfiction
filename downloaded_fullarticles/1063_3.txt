          <div class="userstuff"><p>Effervescent.</p>
<p>Wet warmth, your fingers in my mouth,<br/>
my hands tangling in your hair..<br/>
tightening.</p>
<p>Skin as pale as porcelain,<br/>
marks vivid where I’ve claimed you,<br/>
made you a gift of blossoming<br/>
blue, purple, and red.</p>
<p>How you beg.<br/>
Your eyes say it for you<br/>
after I’ve silenced the rest.</p>
<p>Gray as storm clouds,<br/>
and shining with tears like rain.</p>
<p>It’s a blessed release,<br/>
and I’ll grant you a thousand,<br/>
thousand more.</p>
<p>Tender mercy with these<br/>
roughened hands, scar<br/>
livid on one clenched tightly,<br/>
reminding.</p>
<p>We must not tell lies.</p></div>
