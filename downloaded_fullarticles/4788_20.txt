          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco was stuck. Writers block had set in and he was completely uninspired. He had no idea what to do and his publisher wanted a draft soon. Signing a four book contract had seemed like a good idea at the time but the clock was ticking and Draco was stuck. With the perfect timing he always seemed to embody Harry strolled into the room. "Hey babe, how's the book going" Draco sighed "terribly" <br/>"Right then, come on lets binge watch all the marvel movies we can make it through before we fall asleep. Thor Ragnarok is coming out soon and we need to be prepared"<br/>Draco hesitated, he did really need to try work on his novel. But he soon relented "Well I do like Loki" <br/>Harry grinned, dragging Draco towards the lounge. Dropping Draco off at the comfy couch Harry headed towards the T.V. <br/>"Iron man first" he asked, holding up the case. Draco nodded, already feeling sleepy in the couches comforting embrace. <br/>Harry settled next to him, a bowl of popcorn on his lap as the movie started. </p><p>Draco always loved waking up after movie night. Sure sleeping on a couch was really uncomfortable, but he always woke up before Harry and got to see him sleeping, nuzzled into Draco's side with his hair even messier than usual, somehow. He always looked so peaceful and Draco coveted these moments. <br/>How on earth did he manage to get so lucky.</p></div>
