    <p>“Harry?”</p><p>Harry finished wiping down and wrapped the towel around his waist, before turning to the fire. “Hey, Gin. Saw a bit of the match, good job on the four goals.” He could see her smile through the flames. </p><p>“Thanks. This came for you at the Burrow. Mum sent it along.”  She tossed the package through.</p><p>Harry snatched it out of the air, causing Ginny to smirk, before sitting it on the table next to his dinner. </p><p>“You sure you want to continue your break from the Cannons? Ron would love to have you back for another season.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “Two seasons and a World Cup appearance were plenty. With the money he made, the Cannons can afford three players to replace me.”</p><p>“Oh, Harry, no one could replace you.” Ginny batted her lashes, which looked even more absurd through the flames. </p><p>He knew she was joking, but it still made him uncomfortable. “How’s Draco?”</p><p>“Basking in my fame, wealth, and good name.” She smiled genuinely. “And a fantastic shag.”</p><p>“That part I already knew.” Harry laughed pulling on his clothes. “Tell him hello for me, and thank your Mum.”</p><p>“I will. Enjoy your time off, Harry. Let us know when you’re back in the area.”  She disappeared from the flames.</p><p>He and Ginny never managed to get back together officially after the Second War. Instead, he had a brief fling with Malfoy, who was indeed a fantastic shag, and dated Neville who was just as sweet as you’d imagine (and also a fantastic shag). Ginny dated Neville briefly, but took up with Cho at an after-party when the Harpies won their division. Neville, as far as Harry knew, was still dating Hannah Abbott since they both worked at Hogwarts--Neville as the Professor of Herbology, while Hannah worked with Madame Pomfrey in the Hospital wing. </p><p>He glanced at the Prophet. It was another article about how pretty Ginny and Malfoy looked together. Next to it was the picture of Harry from his resignation press conference after Skeeter accused him of wanting to live off his reputation. He’d come pretty close to hexing her mute, but refrained by gritting his teeth and pointing towards Luna for the next question. Harry, in the wizarding photo, looked both angry and kept trying to leave the frame. The caption below it, written by Skeeter, of course, read: HARRY POTTER, JILTED AND HEARTBROKEN. He wasn’t sure who Rita Skeeter thought he was pining over, Ginny or Draco. Nevermind that he hadn’t dated either of them in years, and was pining for neither. He supposed they sold more papers with the three of them on the front. </p><p>Harry pushed the paper to the side, and sat at the table, picking at his dinner.  The meat rolls were tasty, but he didn’t care for the sauce. He glanced at the package Ginny had given him. He declined all mail at his flat, preferring to go to an Owl Post center to mail things out, and Gringotts to pick up deliveries. Occasionally, people from the Order would send him things at the Burrow, but that didn’t happen more than twice a year. </p><p>Since his retirement, he’d been camping near the Forest of Dean. With the protections he and Hermione had developed in the search for Horcruxes plus the additional spells he’d learned after, the tent was as warm and safe as the Gryffindor dorms. Well, now that he thought about it, probably safer. Chuckling, he flipped the package in his hands. The brown wrapping paper looked familiar, but he didn’t recall exactly where he’d seen it.  Placing it back on the table, he drew his wand from its holster. It took him twenty minutes to cast every detection charm and discovery spell he could think of--the package was clean.  </p><p>He tried to open it, but the paper wouldn’t budge. He tried a cutting charm. That didn’t work. Next, he tried a muggle pocket-knife. It snapped at the handle. Picking up his wand again, he tried Alohamora and Bombarda. Nothing happened. He fingered the edges of the package. </p><p>‘Berk. Open me properly’ was printed all over the front of it. He grinned, thinking maybe George and Ron had magicked up the wrapping paper like the Marauder’s Map.</p><p>“I solemnly swear I’m up to no good.” He tapped his wand against the front.</p><p>The writing changed to ‘That’s more like it’ and split apart to reveal a long narrow box.  He wiped his hands on his jeans nervously. Sometimes George and Ron sent him the oddest things to test out. Their knockout nellies had sleep charmed the entire locker room for four days. The Cannons hadn’t missed their match (George and Ron weren’t heathens!) but they had slept until three hours before the match started. George claimed that being well-rested helped them beat Puddlemere United, so Ron couldn’t complain too much. Harry was just happy to see George pranking again.    </p><p>He took a deep breath and opened the box. The first thing he noticed was the dark red velvet, the exact shade of Gryffindor’s banner covering the bottom of the box. The Elder Wand was at the bottom of the box with the Resurrection stone sitting right at the tip. </p><p>Harry blinked. </p><p>Harry blinked some more. </p><p>He’d snapped the wand.  He had. He threw both pieces into the water. After. Snapping. The. Elder. Wand. Which was entirely whole and still nestled innocently on a Gryffindor-red crushed velvet cushion. He looked for any kind of message. There wasn’t one. The only clue he had was the insulting wrapping paper. He closed the box, replaced the paper loosely over the top, and whispered “Mischief Managed” before tapping his wand lightly on the paper. The package rewrapped itself tightly and dropped back onto the table.</p><p>Harry stood, and then stumbled over to the fireplace tripping over a chair in his haste. He tossed in some floo powder and spoke very clearly.</p><p>“Department of Mysteries, Hermione Granger’s office.”</p><p>“I can’t possibly get away for another two days.” She stopped speaking towards the phone on her desk. “Oh, it’s you. What do you need, Harry?”</p><p>“I received a package today. Ginny threw it to me from the Burrow.” </p><p>“She’s already back from the tournament?” Harry’s face was warm, but his vision wasn’t impaired much by the fire-call. He saw Hermione shake her head. “No, never mind. What about the package?”</p><p>“Is this call secure?”</p><p>“You’re literally the only person on the planet that can use it from the outside, Harry. I’d say it’s secure. Now what is it? I have four different cases open, and sixteen experiments going right now.”</p><p>“Someone sent me the Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone.”</p><p>“Step back.” She flicked her wand behind her, throwing four silent spells around her office, before grabbing a handful of floo powder. “I’ll be right there.”</p>
