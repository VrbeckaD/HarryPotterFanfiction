    <p>Healer Luella Smith stared down at the baby in front of her. She shouldn’t even be contemplating such a thing. It went against every oath that she had taken as a Healer.</p><p>The infant was barely a month old by Luella’s estimate, and an innocent. But there was no promise that he would remain that way if the ones he shared blood with were allowed to raise him.</p><p>Besides if Luella’s idea was successful she’d be solving two problems.</p><p>Lily and James Potter were good people. She had been a few years ahead of them in Hogwarts, and in a different house. But she’d still met them, knew them. They were kind and loving, and stood up to protect others from the dark forces terrorizing their country. Luella admired their strength and courage.</p><p>It just didn’t seem fair that such a loving young couple would lose their first baby while Death Eaters would get to keep theirs.</p><p>Luella was working all alone in the pediatric and maternity ward that particular night. The rest of the staff had been pulled away for an emergency after a raid on a Death Eater’s house. The St. Mungos staff hadn’t heard which one. They needed all of the available Healers to counter all of the horrifying curses that had been cast upon the Aurors.</p><p>Luella hadn’t minded being left alone to tend to the maternity and pediatric wards. There had only been two women in the ward and only one newborn. Alice Longbottom had already given birth to a healthy baby boy the previous day, and Lily Potter’s labor had seemed to be going well. Then the baby was actually born, and it quickly became apparent that there was something horribly wrong with the newborn. Luella had to remove the newborn to another room of the hospital in order to treat him much to the distress of his young parents.</p><p>Luella had done everything that she could but nothing she tried worked, and the Potter baby didn’t make it. She had been contemplating how she was going to tell the Potters when a bloody Auror in robes that stunk like smoke burst in to shove a wailing baby at Luella.</p><p>The panicked Auror had given her a quick description of events. Aurors had found the baby in the Death Eater home they had raided. They had no idea who the baby was, and a quick test proved that the baby wasn’t registered in the St. Mungos’s registry. It simply meant the infant hadn’t been born in St. Mungos or been taken to the hospital since his birth. It wasn’t completely uncommon for the older pureblood families to forgo St. Mungos, thinking themselves better than the wizarding hospital, and instead employing their own private Healers. They would have to send for records from the Ministry or even Gringotts if the child’s Death Eater parents hadn’t deigned to register their child with the Ministry.</p><p>It was sitting in the room with two infants, one alive and one dead, that Luella had gotten the idea.</p><p>The more she tried to ignore the idea the more she realized how much it could actually work, and how many problems it would solve. She had lost so many friends and family to this war. Working as a Healer had given her an up close and personal look at the damage that was caused by these Death Eaters. All of the unnecessary death and destruction sickened her. If she could stop another child growing up to become a loyal muggle-hating, follower of You-Know-Who then she would.</p><p>It was easy enough to slip down into the old potion storage rooms where they kept the illegal potions and their antidotes for emergencies. Even if they were illegal wizards and witches still made them, and inevitably they would end up hurting themselves or others in the process. St. Mungos was one of the few places permitted to legitimately store illegal potions. The hospital kept the potions for research purposes. It was also important to have them in order to train their Healers to identify the effects and appearances of the potions. Luella, as a Healer of St. Mungos, was allowed access to the potions.</p><p>Unlawful blood adoption cases cropped every couple of years or so, and it was important that the healers be able to recognize what the potion looked like both in and out of a child’s blood so that the effects could be reversed.</p><p>Luella took one of the vials of the Familia Sanguini Potion. No one would even notice it missing. Things had been far too chaotic in the last year for the staff to be keeping meticulous records. She accessed blood samples that had been kept on record in St. Mungos for Lily and James Potter from their previous visits. Three drops of blood from each of the new parents were added to the potion in order to complete it. Once the potion turned the proper deep plum color, Luella fed it to the infant. </p><p>She felt a pang of guilt as he watched the baby’s transformation take place. But she comforted herself that she was doing the right thing. Luella was saving this child from becoming a murderer like his parents most likely were, and she was saving a wonderful young couple from the awful heartache of losing their first child.</p><p>With the process complete she scooped up the child, and brought him to the Potter’s delivery room. The child was older than a newborn but Luella was certain the Potters wouldn’t notice the difference. They hadn’t gotten a good look of the infant before she had taken the baby away. Besides, this would be their first child, and they wouldn’t know what to expect a newborn to look like.</p><p>Lily Potter was sobbing her eyes out while her husband was attempting to comfort her despite his own tears.</p><p>“Look who I’ve brought to see you,” Luella announced, smiling.</p><p>Lily gasped as her eyes landed on the baby.</p><p>“Is he…?” James questioned.</p><p>“Perfectly fine, just a bit of a scare. He got some fluid in his lungs during the delivery. But he’s perfectly healthy. No need to worry now,” Luella assured as she laid the baby in Lily’s arms.</p><p>“Thank you, he’s perfect,” Lily whispered as she cradled the baby close to her chest.</p><p>The Potters’ overwhelming happiness, and joy was more than enough proof to her that Luella had done the right thing. They would be good parents. They would love and raise this baby, and teach him right from wrong. Instead of growing up to be a Death Eater with hateful and spiteful ideals, this little boy would grow up into someone kind and intelligent like Lily, and playful and brave like James.</p><p>The wizarding world would be a better place because of what she had done.</p><p>Nonetheless Luella accepted their thanks, and answered all of the questions they had before leaving them alone with their new son. She returned to her office and filled out all of the proper paperwork. Luella recorded that the unknown child found in the Death Eater raid had perished from the damage sustained from the fire, and Harry James Potter had been born on July 31<sup>st</sup>1980 with minimal complications.</p><p>No one questioned the validity of her reports, and they were quickly filed away to become fact. The hospital and the Ministry itself was in far too much turmoil to spare Aurors and resources to follow up on things like the death of a unknown Death Eater’s child. So there was no autopsy, and the babe was buried without anyone the wiser. Even if there was an inquiry there was no one else who could refute Luella’s own words.</p><p>When St. Mungos was attacked a month later, Luella Smith was caught in the crossfire. She didn’t survive, and took her secret to her grave.</p><p>No one would discover the truth for many years to come.</p>
