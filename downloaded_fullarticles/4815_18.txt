    <p>“I will be activating clause 13,” said Astoria Malfoy calmly across the long expanse of the dining table.</p><p> </p><p>Draco froze in place, his fork half raised to his mouth. He very slowly placed his fork back on his plate. Despite the sumptuous food on offer, his appetite disappeared in a flash. His life was over. All because of that cursed contract.</p><p> </p><p>The Malfoy line had only just survived the fall of Voldemort. On the night of the Battle Of Hogwarts things had gotten so out of control for the family that whichever side won that night, the Malfoy's knew that they would suffer.</p><p> </p><p>It had taken three unbreakable vows, most of their considerable fortune and the most draconian marriage contract ever written to keep the family out of Azkaban.</p><p> </p><p>The once proud house of Malfoy was now little more than a vassal to the Noble House of Greengrass.</p><p> </p><p>“Really, my l-love,” Draco stammered, “I don't think that's necessary. If you'd just give it a little more time, I'm sure-”</p><p> </p><p>“I have waited quite long enough. Besides for all your excellent breeding, dear Draco, your father only managed to sire you. One child. The Weasley's managed seven; your mother was one of three for goodness sake. And it appears that Potter is going for some kind of record with poor Ginny. No. I have waited long enough Draco, if it were going to happen without assistance, it would have by now. I am activating clause 13.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco raged internally. With the stiff wounded pried only a pure-blood could manage, he brought his serviette up to his mouth and excused himself from the room. He could feel Astoria's mocking gaze follow him across the large room.</p><p> </p><p>He stalked angrily through the halls of Malfoy Manor. Of course, it was Malfoy Manor in name only these days. Ever since he had been forced to sign that marriage contract, it had been for all intents and purposes, under Greengrass control. As his father said, it was the only way to preserve the pride of the Malfoy line.</p><p> </p><p>After the war had ended and the dust had settled Draco found himself all but excommunicated from the Pure-blood social strata. No woman of pure blood wanted to be associated with the Malfoy line, traitors and known Death Eaters as they were. He might have had some luck marrying an ambitious half-blood, but that would have ruined them in a worse way.</p><p> </p><p>The only family that would give them the time of day was the Greengrass's. Astoria had looked Draco up and down once with a calculating look on her aristocratic face. She had proposed a deal to the heads of the two families. It would all be written out in her marriage contract.</p><p> </p><p>The Malfoy’s would seed the manor and control of their finances to Astoria who would act as regent to the family until a Malfoy heir was of age. The Malfoy’s would be reintegrated into high society by the Greengrass's over time. The Greengrass's would gain influence and acclaim for 'rehabilitating a fallen house', and the Malfoy's could maintain their pure-blood line.</p><p> </p><p>The heads of both houses had agreed to it almost immediately. What that meant for Draco was that he could swan about in public acting the unapproachable epitome of pure-blood society, but at home, he belonged to Astoria.</p><p> </p><p>As per the contract, all of this was kept well away from the public eye. No one knew, for instance, that Lucius and Narcissa had been evicted from the main house and were living in an old Coach House on the far side of the property. No one knew that Draco was little better than a house elf.</p><p> </p><p>It was the burden he carried for his line. That was until she mentioned clause 13.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Astoria sat alone at the table, her petulant husband having stormed off in a huff some five minutes ago. She was unconcerned by his anger. She was mostly unconcerned with anything he did. Unbreakable Vows were funny like that.</p><p> </p><p>She tapped her silver spoon on the caramelised crust of her Crème brûlée, then brought a single perfect spoonful to her red lips. She so relished these little rituals. She sat and savoured her favourite desert thinking about who she would approach for help.</p><p> </p><p>None of the pure-bloods would want to take partake in it. Besides, that might infringe on the contract. She had to keep this out of high society or risk the wrath of that beautiful piece of paper. No, blood would not be the deciding factor here. What she needed was to compare three important factors.</p><p> </p><p>One, the donor must be... potent. She needed someone who had proven themselves virile. Draco would at least be grateful for that; the more virile the donor was, the less Draco would have to endure.</p><p> </p><p>Two, the donor must be magically powerful. Their magic must suffuse all parts of their being or else the potion would never work.</p><p> </p><p>And three, it must infuriate and humiliate Draco.</p><p> </p><p>She let out a little sigh into the large silent hall. Her only regret in life was that she had not 'examined the goods' before making her purchase. The Malfoy wealth was all well and good, but Draco was to put it gently; underwhelming.</p><p> </p><p>His lovemaking was rather dull and quite passionless. He wasn't particularly inventive either. On top of all that was his poor little cock. The thing was smallish, ugly and pale. Draco didn't exactly wow in the stamina department either, and his... emissions were always small and watery.</p><p> </p><p>Thus clause 13.</p><p> </p><p>There was only one man who fit the bill. She would have to pay a call to Ginevra!</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Ginny would normally have burnt any letter with the name Malfoy on it as a matter of principle, but it arrived at just the right time. She was standing outside her home having just rounded up the children and sent them off to Grandma via Portkey when an elegant owl swooped down and dropped a letter in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Reflexively she snatched it out of the air, the ingrained reflexes of a professional chaser overriding her sense of caution. She read the first two words on the outside of the letter, 'spa day' then her eyes landed on the sender.</p><p> </p><p>Astoria Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>In a flash, Ginny had her wand out and was performing ever detection charm she'd ever heard of, including a couple of rare ones that Harry had uncovered.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing. It was just paper.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps it was the fact that it was the off-season, meaning she was slightly bored. Perhaps it was the mention of the spa day. She always got a little frazzled by the kids. Perhaps it was the raw curiosity, but Ginny Potter read Astoria's letter and perhaps, changed everything.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>She was bliss made flesh. Harry's massages had a certain earnest charm to them and what it almost always led to was the most fun anyone could have off a broomstick, but this was on another level. The professionals at Sopwell House knew exactly what they were doing.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny floated weightlessly in a room lit by a few gently flickering candles, their warm golden light bathing everthing in a beautiful soothing haze. Steam hung heavy in the room, and gentle music washed over her. Spells and skilled hands and lotions and ointments and heat packs and a constant stream of wonderful things had wrung every bit of stress and tension from her smooth, strong body.</p><p> </p><p>Astoria hadn't said much when she first arrived, saying that it could wait until after. She had gone so far as to offer Ginny her wand, a demonstration of complete trust. The old traditions stated that Ginny could snap Astoria's wand if she so chose, and face no repercussions. It had gone a long way to easing Ginny's troubled mind.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, they had been pampered and tended to for hours on end. Astoria proved to be a wonderful companion, asking after her children and seeming to relish the stories. She asked insightful questions about Ginny's Quidditch career without being at all sycophantic. Astoria was gracious and surprisingly empathetic, and her patient ear did as much to sooth Ginny as the massages did.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, they were levitated into a new room and slowly dipped into a hot mud bath.</p><p> </p><p>“So you're no doubt wondering why I contacted you. I'm sorry for all the waiting, but I felt you deserve the pampering free of any other worries,” said Astoria finally, her bright grey eyes locked on Ginny who sat languidly on the far side of the mud pool.</p><p> </p><p>“Anytime,” said Ginny with a yawn.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm also sorry if what I say causes you any distress. I promise you I am asking as a... well I am being as genuine as I can be, I know you Gryffindor's prize being upfront about things so here goes. I want a baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny opened her eyes at this and sat up a bit straighter in the pool, the smooth dark mud clinging to her lightly freckled skin as she did so, “I know I've had seven of them, but if you're asking how that happened, I can't tell you. Harry and I just got lucky.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hardly lucky. You've had two sets of triplets, Ginny. Even Molly didn't manage more than twins,” Astoria sighed dramatically, “I know you don't care for my husband, and truth be told some days I don't either, but I need to produce an heir if I am to redeem the Malfoy line. I think it a worthy goal, and could do much to heal the community in the years to come, but somehow we just cannot manage it.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny was on guard now, “What does this have to do with me” she asked, a frown forming on her delicate face.</p><p> </p><p>“To tell you I need you to sign a document promising you won't tell anyone else. It's a stipulation of my marriage contract that it remain private. I leave it up to you to decide but I promise you, it's juicy.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny struggled with it for a full minute before giving in. Astoria smiled and summoned one of her elves. The elf held up the contract for Ginny to read but it was a straightforward one. If she signed, she wouldn't be able to share what they talked about in this room on this specific date with anyone without Astoria's permission. Even if she did do it, Astoria could still cancel the punishment if she deemed it accidental.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny signed.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Ginny, I promise you won't regret this,” Astoria took a deep breath in a began, “As I said, Draco has been unable to sire a child with me. My marriage contract is rather... specific. I tested myself and a sample unwittingly provided by Draco at St. Mungo's and they reported that it's Draco that is the problem party. This allowed me to enact clause 13.”</p><p>“What does that mean,” asked Ginny, now curious.</p><p> </p><p>“I have almost total control over Draco until he manages to father a child with me. With the power of the document I can force him into doing anything I want so long as it furthers the goal of my getting pregnant.”</p><p> </p><p>“What does this have to do with me?” Ginny asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I intend to make Draco take a fertility potion. It's part of a larger ritual, but it requires a... donation both powerful and potent.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny just looked incredulously at Astoria. She would have stormed off long ago if it hadn't been for the delicious feeling of the mud bath.</p><p> </p><p>“What that means,” said Astoria hurriedly, “well... I thought it through and came to the obvious choice of Harry. I wanted to talk it over with you first. Before you say no let me explain, all you would need to do is collect a sample from Harry, I would perform a small ritual and then Draco would be forced to drink it.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny's face went from horrified to blank.</p><p> </p><p>Astoria continued, “I know how much you despise Draco, his family did you a great wrong. I thought that the idea of a little revenge would be attractive to you. Please, Ginny, I'm asking you to help me and humiliate Draco.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you for the spa day, Astoria. It's been interesting,” and without another word, Ginny stood up, the mud contouring to her body like a second skin and left without a backwards glance.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Ginny returned home to find the whole family setting the table for dinner. Harry had somehow managed to wrangle them into helping, and they all chattered excitedly about their day. Harry was at the stove helping James, their first son who was standing on a chair, stirring a great big pot. The trio, Lily, Dora and Luna were her three beautiful girls from her second pregnancy, and they were busy washing up dishes and handing them to the terrors.</p><p> </p><p>The terrors were from her third pregnancy, two identical boys, and a girl.</p><p> </p><p>She fondly called them the terrors because the two youngest boys were like Fred and George reincarnate, save for their hair which was like Harry's. Fabian and Gideon were going to level Hogwarts to the ground one day, and they would do it with the help of their birth sister, Ariana who was just as cunning and twice as wicked.</p><p> </p><p>Their seven children, who fought and squabbled just like any siblings, were working in perfect harmony. The girls were doing dishes, Ginny saw that Harry had lent them his wand, and they were trying to Scurgify each dish, passing the wand between them. When one managed to cast the spell correctly the dish was handed off to either Fabian, Gideon or Ariana who took them and placed them on the table with a solemn dignity Ginny had rarely seen in her three youngest.</p><p> </p><p>And Harry, her wonderful, handsome, brave Harry was surrounded by family. His family. He'd never looked Happier.</p><p> </p><p>Ariana spotted mum first, and the spell broke. Everyone but James, who was 'too old for all that stuff, mum' rushed over to great her. She was happy to be home.</p><p> </p><p>But long after everyone else had been put to bed and even Harry was snoring ever so softly in that terribly cute way he did, Ginny lay awake in bed.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>“So what changed your mind?” Astoria asked, three weeks later.</p><p> </p><p>The two of them were sitting together, in a quiet café just off Diagon Aly, over a light lunch.</p><p> </p><p>“Family. When I got home that night, I saw Harry with the whole family. As much as I detest your husband, that doesn't mean that you don't deserve a chance at that happiness.”</p><p>“And humiliating Draco had nothing to do with it?” asked Astoria with a raised eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine yes. I have some clauses of my own,” Said Ginny flatly.</p><p>“Naturally”</p><p> </p><p>“I want a pensive memory of him drinking it.”</p><p> </p><p>Astoria threw back her head and laughed in a most undignified fashion, “Is that all. I was going to owl you one either way. How could I keep something so delicious all to myself? I'd burst. Anything else?”</p><p> </p><p>“I want you to humiliate him as much as possible while you do it. For the memory.”</p><p> </p><p>“Done”</p><p> </p><p>Astoria again called her house elf, and the went through the contract line by line until they were both happy. Astoria also included limitations stating that they could only use Harry's donation for this one ritual and any leftovers, which Astoria promised there would be none, would be destroyed.</p><p> </p><p>The signed and shook hands and departed.</p><p> </p><p>“I eagerly await your next owl, Ginny. And thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Once again, Ginny was the only person awake at the Potter house. Harry had exhausted himself playing with the children all day, being pulled this way and that as the horde competed for his attention. Such were the delights of their time off with the family.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny couldn't sleep, she was too tense, too excited and honestly too guilty. She really shouldn't be doing with without asking, but this was revenge. This was Weasley family business, and she was sure that Harry would understand.</p><p> </p><p>But he would never need to know. She silently cast a sleeping spell on her husband. He wouldn't wake up for another hour no matter what she did.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled back the covers and unbuttoned Harry's pyjamas. Even in the relaxed state of sleep, Harry looked fantastic. His abs were shadowed wonderfully in the moonlight that shone in through the window, and his broad chest raised up and down as he breathed contentedly. At twenty-eight, he was a work of art.</p><p> </p><p>Next, she unbuttoned his pants and pulled them down just enough to free her favourite toy. She reached out and took hold of his cock. It was warm and soft to the touch. She played with it lovingly for a long while, tracing her fingers over it and then squeezing it gently just to feel it. She wrapped her fingers around the middle and slowly pulled down, drawing his skin down and revealing his glans to the moonlight.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't long before he was rock hard. Merlin, he had a beautiful cock. Her tiny hands could comfortably fit more than twice over on its impressive length, and it was thick and solid as stone the whole way up. The head of his penis flared out wonderfully; she shuddered at the many memories of it scrapping in and out of her. She drew it close for a moment, and pressed her face into the underside where its broad base lead into his huge sack. She breathed in deeply, savouring the incredible musky smell.</p><p> </p><p>Even after all this time, just the smell alone was enough to get her wet. She cupped his large balls in her hands, before running her tongue from ball to tip. It tasted salty and musky and undeniably male.</p><p> </p><p>She spent a long while just kissing and licking the gorgeous length of meat that was dwarfing her small hands. She rubbed it all over her face and traced the many veins with her sensitive fingers returning to the top to greedily suckle at the constant stream of clear pre-cum that oozed from its fat purple head.</p><p> </p><p>Astoria had instructed her to simply jerk him off into a bottle, but Ginny had worked herself into a fever pitch, and there was no way she was going to let her man cum anywhere else but deep inside her. She would let it drip out into a bottle later. It pleased her to know that Draco would be drinking her run off.</p><p> </p><p>Rubbing her pussy in vigorous circular motions, Ginny moved to straddle Harry, the forbidden nature of what she was doing turning her on, something fierce. She was dripping wet, her bright red pubic hair was slick, and her fingers slipped between her pink lips readily. She straddled Harry and aimed his glistening cock head at her hungry entrance and slowly sunk onto his thick, rigid cock.</p><p> </p><p>She pumped her small frame up and down, her lips dragging in and out in an obscene fashion as she lifted up, his girth stretching her out wonderfully.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't long before the huge cock inside of her, the frantic work of her hand on her clit and the sheer delightful wrongness of it all sent her crashing into a shuddering orgasm. She spasmed helplessly on Harry for a long while, all else forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>Slowly she returned to earth. She caught her breath and got to work. She moved at the pace that always worked on Harry, squeeze her groin, making herself as tight as she could. Sure enough not a minute later she felt Harry swell. As she looked down, she saw his balls contract into the base of his thick shaft and then bulge before she felt a warmth flood her insides.</p><p> </p><p>Harry's heavy balls weren't just for show, he produced copious amounts of cum and Ginny loved it. When they had first started fooling around, he had sneaked into her room at the Burrow in the dead of night, and she tasted his cock for the first time. She had been completely unprepared for the torrential downpour of cum he could produce as he plastered her with his seed. They had been forced to sneak into the bathroom and spent a long while cleaning off.</p><p> </p><p>Even sleeping Harry didn't disappoint. She sat contentedly on him for a long moment before summoning the bottle over to her. She leaned back and slowly pulled off her husband. As soon as his broad head popped free, she placed the wide head of the bottle against her opening. She felt great dollops of his seed pour out of her, dripping in large, viscous waves, like honey dripping off a knife. She squeezed herself again and yet more of his beautiful cum leaked out of her.</p><p> </p><p>The large bottle was nearly full, and she delighted at the quantity. Astoria would ensure that Draco swallowed the whole damn thing. He wouldn't even be able to pinch his nose and knock it back like medicine. No, he'd have to endure every thick mouthful she had harvested from her mate. She felt primal. She felt vengeful. She felt powerful.</p><p> </p><p>She capped the bottle with a flick of her wand and wave between Harry's legs. His cock had flopped to the side, its length glistening with their mingled juices, revealing the hypnotising texture in explicit detail.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny held the bottle and began to touch herself again. As it turned out, vengeance was the greatest aphrodisiac as she brought herself to orgasm three more times that night, just looking at the bottle.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Astoria Malfoy was having a particularly good day. She sat in her finely upholstered study in a high-backed chair at her desk, a heavy old antique that Lucius once used. She sat quietly and sipped her wine as the small fireplace crackled pleasantly and gave off a warm orange glow.</p><p> </p><p>She took up her quill and dipped the tip into the well, and wrote out another letter thanking Lady Parkinson for her help at the Wizengamot. Pansy had been such a deer to Astoria these last few years. Frustrating as it was, Draco had managed to hold onto his seat in the Wizengamot, part of upholding the pride of his line. Astoria hadn't been too concerned with it at the time as Draco was supposed to consult with her over his activities, but the arrogant berk had never done so.</p><p> </p><p>So Astoria, being the pragmatic Slytherin that she was, found ways of amusing herself at Draco's expense. Draco would campaign heavily for a law or decree, and Astoria would undermine it from the shadows.</p><p> </p><p>Draco had many enemies and few allies at this point, and Astoria delighted in rallying them against her ignorant husband. Ever since sending that first letter to Ginny, Astoria had been shaping things so that Draco's work would always be toppled by Harry. He would come home after a long day campaigning, his blood boiling, muttering dark thoughts about his rival that had somehow manage to push through another law protecting muggle-borns or repeal a piece of legislation that favoured pure-bloods.</p><p> </p><p>There was an art to this. The build-up was, to Astoria, as pleasurable as the payoff.</p><p> </p><p>So there she sat in her fine study, its walls lined with precious books as she amused herself with tormenting the Malfoy heir. It was only made better by the arrival of an unfamiliar owl.</p><p> </p><p>Smiling a wicked smile, Astoria untied the small package tied to the owl's leg. In it was a small bottle, and a short note. She read the letter then tapped her wand on the bottle. It returned to its former size, about that of a wine bottle. It was filled all the way to the cork with a white liquid.</p><p> </p><p>Yes, today was a particularly good day.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>The Pensive memory had arrived a week ago, but Ginny hadn't had any free time to watch it. Instead the small vile had been burning a hole, buried in her sock drawer. Now the house was empty. Harry, together with Ron and Neville had taken all the kids to Shell cottage for a day at the beach.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny couldn't go because she had to prepare for a meeting with the managers of the Harpies which meant she had a few hours between when the all the Potter children departed and her meeting began.</p><p> </p><p>Now, finally, she would watch the memory. She stole into Harry's study and poured the silvery memory into the Potter family Pensive and leaned in over the bowl.</p><p> </p><p>She floated down into the memory to find Astoria standing in front of a mirror, in a large bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Ginny and welcome to my memory. I received your letter on a most suitable occasion. I'm not sure what you know about it, but on the night it arrived Draco had just lost another Wizengamot session to your Husband. Draco couldn't stand the idea of Muggle parents being able to visit their children; he can just barely tolerate the muggle-borns themselves. You should have seen it, weeks of work for an appeal, scrounging up the votes and trading promises and in comes, Harry Potter, speaks for all of half a minute and the hall votes Draco down.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny knew most of this, but Astoria's delighted schadenfreude over her husband's defeat warmed her soul. Harry had heard about the appeal at the last minute and Portkeyed to the ministry from several countries away and given a short but moving speech about Hermione being petrified and her parents being unable to visit. He glossed over the fact that Hermione's parents never even knew she was in trouble, but Harry wasn't above a little manipulation despite his distaste for politics as a whole.</p><p> </p><p>“So I thought I would rile him up, get him absolutely steaming over potter then make him drink it.”</p><p> </p><p>The Memory faded to black, Astoria smiling a truly wicked smile into the mirror.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny floated down into a large dining hall to see Astoria sitting primly on a large comfortable armchair while Draco paced back and forth in front of a grand fireplace. Draco was obviously agitated, and Ginny listened with no small amount of satisfaction to his impotent raving.</p><p> </p><p>“Months of work. Months! I had to make deals with half the neutrals. Every single one of them demanded a win or lose trade, so now I'm stuck voting for the neutral block for half the bloody year for a Motion that didn't even pass!”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny saw Astoria smirk behind Draco's back, “It's a pity Potter was there,” she said, baiting Malfoy expertly.</p><p> </p><p>“Potter! Potter! That jumped up half-blood doesn't even deserve entrance to the Ministry let alone a standing session of the Wizengamot! He's worse than Author Weasley for Merlin's sake. Months of deals and setbacks and he just swaggers in at the last minute and talk about Granger of all people, and everyone just nods their heads, and that's fucking that!”</p><p>“The public adores hi, dear, not to mention, seven children. The house of Potter is back in a big way, and everyone knows it.”</p><p> </p><p>“He should stick to fucking his whore then and leave leading this country to real men!” spat Draco.</p><p> </p><p>“Speaking of real men, I think it's time,” Astoria announced.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” asked Draco, still distracted by his outrage.</p><p> </p><p>“I Astoria Greengrass hereby enact Clause 13 without provision. So mote it be.”</p><p> </p><p>Both Malfoy's glowed for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>Draco paled to the point his face took on a bluish tone, “What have you done?” he demanded.</p><p> </p><p>“None of that dear, it upsets me when you yell. No talking until I say otherwise,” said Astoria, her voice dripping with condescension.</p><p> </p><p>Draco's face flushed a blotchy red, and he furiously tried to speak only to find himself gagging on his tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Astoria crossed her arms thoughtfully, “yes this is much better, I think it will help our chances of preserving the Malfoy line if you stay quiet from here on out. Now for the sake of our audience, oh, by the way, Draco dear I will be sending a pensive of this to a dear friend of mine... where was I, oh yes, I have complete control over your actions so long as it pertains to preserving the Malfoy line. Of course, Lucius was never the best at contracting, the Goblins did it all for him you know, pity about them falling out isn't it? The wording is terribly vague, why it gives me all sorts of leeway. For instance, I think it would help me preserve the Malfoy line if you referred to me as Mistress from now on, I want you to agree to this dear husband.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco fought not to say anything for a long time, and veins began to bulge up and down his neck. Finally, the dam burst and he collapsed breathless to the ground, “Yes... mistress” he managed to say in between huge gasps of air.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, that does all sorts of things for me, why I feel more fertile already. I think it would help preserve the line if you took off all your clothes. Then you can go ahead and fold them into a neat little pile for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco glared at his wife for a long moment before his limbs started to move, as if by themselves. Methodically he stripped down completely revealing his pasty white body.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny was saddened for Astoria to see that Malfoy had lost the leanness of his youth. Now he was just pudgy and unfit. While she pitied Astoria, she revelled in the feeling of superiority. Her Harry had never looked better. She could get lost in his chest, and his abs delighted her in new ways every day. She loved that Harry's body wasn't the overly sculpted type she saw in so many old works of art, but the result of years of hard work and good living. Harry was built for purpose, there was nothing delicate about his build these days, it was all practical.</p><p> </p><p>All man.</p><p> </p><p>She delighted that Draco paled, quite literally as it turned out, in comparison. Clearly, blood wasn't everything. Ginny watched on avidly as Draco folded his clothes. She suspected it might be the first time he'd ever had to do it.</p><p> </p><p>“Very good Draco,” crooned Astoria, “Now just put them over on the couch there, you won't be needing them again tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco did so, his eyes full of murderous intent.</p><p> </p><p>“And your wand, just leave that there. Wands are for wizards Draco. I think I'd like to hear you say you agree; I feel it would really help preserve the line.” She finished with a cruel chuckle.</p><p> </p><p>Draco's face twitched, his hand balled into fists but all he could do was stand naked in the middle of the room. Finally, he broke again, the pressure of the Vow becoming too much to bear.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes... Mistress, wands are for wizards.” Draco practically chewed each word, imbuing them with a seething hatred.</p><p> </p><p>“And from now on Draco dear, you're little more than transport for those shrivelled little raisins you call balls. What are you?”</p><p> </p><p>This time Draco managed to take one step forward, no doubt wanting to lunge at his tormentor. His feet disobeyed his command, and he toppled to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny heard a crunch and suspected that he'd landed on his nose and broken it.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you Draco, I really don't like having to ask again, it might even be a breach of contract.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco let out a scream of pain. His voice was shrill and horse. His cry ended in a fit of heavy coughing.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny wondered if it was the pain of his nose being broken or the magic of the contract that was hurting him more. She'd never felt more excited. This was amazing. She drank in every detail, each second a balm for all the insults and bullshit her entire family had had to endure at the hands the colossal prat that was Draco Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>“Mistress, I am little more than transport for my tiny balls, please make it stop!” Begged Draco as he lay face down on his own carpet.</p><p> </p><p>“That's right you are,” said Astoria in a sing-song baby voice. She stood up from her seat. She stepped over Draco and walked over to the bar and took hold of a large familiar bottle.</p><p> </p><p>“Now Draco,” she said walking back to the centre of the room, “You don't like this do you?”</p><p> </p><p>“No Mistress” groaned Draco.</p><p> </p><p>“I understand,” she said in a cold imitation of caring, “If you drink this it will all be over, it's going to cure all your problems. Remember that little ritual I talked about, well all you have to do is drain this bottle.”</p><p> </p><p>She sat down on the floor and tucked her legs under her. Then she Rolled Draco over to reveal his bloody, terrified face.</p><p> </p><p>“Sit up a bit Draco,” she instructed patting her lap.</p><p> </p><p>Dutifully Draco lifted himself up and rested his head on her lap. To Ginny, the pose looked like Draco was some giant baby about to suckle at his mother's teat. Ginny moved closer and sat facing Astoria, Draco lying perpendicular between the two kneeling girls.</p><p> </p><p>Astoria manoeuvred Draco about until his head lay in the crook of her arm. She was about to bottle feed her husband so it suited.</p><p> </p><p>“Now Draco, I know it will help the line if you drink this whole bottle, once you start I want you to keep drinking until nothing is left, no matter what is that understood?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. Mistress,” said Draco, his tone suddenly timid.</p><p> </p><p>Astoria deftly removed the cap from the bottle and held the tip under her nose. Ginny smiled as she heard Astoria mutter, “That lucky bitch”.</p><p> </p><p>Draco motioned to his throat, clearly wishing to say something. Astoria smiled warmly at her compliant husband.</p><p> </p><p>“Go on Draco; you can ask your Mistress a question.”</p><p> </p><p>“What is it... Mistress?” he asked fearfully.</p><p> </p><p>“This is one of the most powerful fertility potions ever invented. Well technically it's not a potion, but it's an essential part of the ritual that you and I will be taking part of. Once you drink this, we'll be one step closer to having a little baby Malfoy running around the manor. All you have to do is drink the whole thing, don't stop for any reason.”</p><p> </p><p>And with that, she brought the bottle to Draco's pale lips and upended the bottle.</p><p> </p><p>The white viscous fluid slowly made its way up the neck of the bottle, and it pooled in a great drip before finally touching the top of Draco's tongue. More and more of the sticky, hot fluid filled his mouth. Finally, while staring wide-eyed up at Astoria, he took a single swallow.</p><p> </p><p>“That's good, Draco, keep swallowing. Now that you've started you can't stop for any reason. Not even when I tell you,” she leaned in, and Ginny did too, eager to finally hear the words, “Not even when I tell you, you're drinking Harry Potter's cum.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco's eyes widened even more, and his chest started heaving. His body trembled and spasmed, but the magic of the contract held him still. Ginny could hear him screaming internally as he made a futile bid to push the emptying bottle of cum out of his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Astoria smiled triumphantly and started to stroke Draco's neck, eventually the sensation forced him to swallow, and his face flushed a deep, shameful red. Hot tears fell down his face as he was forced to swallow again and again.</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny promises me this was just a single load from Harry... while he was sleeping. Can you believe that? I see now why they have seven children already. His balls must be so big. So full,” She laughed, “About as full as your pretty little mouth I'd say.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny had entered a savage, vengeful nirvana and she was nothing but pure cruel ecstasy for a long, long moment. She exulted in the complete degradation of one of the men she hated most in this world. This was for Katie and Ron and Dumbledore she thought, you fucking slime, you worm, you cum guzzling faggot whore!</p><p> </p><p>Draco swallowed the last of his rivals seed, its thick hot texture staining his tongue for all time.</p><p> </p><p>“So good,” crooned Astoria, “Ginny will just love this. Stick your tongue in the bottle dear; you missed a bit” She said laughing. “I'm sending her the memory of this as she was so kind as to collect this donation... from Harry potters... big... heavy... balls.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ginny ascended out of the memory; her groin was liquid fire. She needed her man; she needed him now. Brandishing her wand, she cried out, “Expecto Patronum!”</p><p> </p><p>The bright glittering form of a rearing horse burst from the tip of her wand cantered around the room before trotting up to her, nuzzling her gently in greeting.</p><p> </p><p>“I need you to take a message to Harry, can you do that for me,” asked Ginny. She'd gotten into the habit of asking her Patronus politely ever since she'd seen Luna do it. Ginny liked to think that she had an easier time casting the intricate charm because of her small act of kindness.</p><p> </p><p>The horse just whinnied agreeably.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, you need to get home right away, it's an emergency,” she said, and her Patronus gave one shake of its mane and was off.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny hoped that framing her message as an emergency, and in her mind, it really was an emergency, would allow Harry to leave whatever situation he was in without being questioned too much.</p><p> </p><p>Less than five minutes later an extremely puffed Harry Potter crashed through the front door, wand raised, eyes wild.</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny! Ginny, are you ok? Are the kids ok?” he yelled, his voice frantic with worry.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny could have slapped herself. Of course, Harry would react this way. He'd no doubt immediately thought Ginny and the children were being attacked like his parents.</p><p> </p><p>“I'm fine Harry; I'm so sorry I just...” Ginny blushed, lost for words, “Oh goodness, I've really put my elbow in the butter this time.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry crossed the distance between them in an instant and surrounded her in a hug. She melted into the embrace, guilty at how he was now reassuring her.</p><p> </p><p>“Is everyone ok?” he asked, his deep voice vibrating through his warm chest.</p><p> </p><p>“Everyone's fine, I just needed to see you.” she finished, her voice small. Her adrenalin had spiked when Harry had charged in, and now that he was holding her, the fire in her belly started to grow again.</p><p> </p><p>“Needed me, what for?” he asked, his voice full of concern.</p><p> </p><p>As an answer, she reached her hand around his neck, ran her fingers through his hair and pulled him into a searing kiss. She put everything she could into it. She wanted him to feel everything he meant to her. She wanted him to feel like that first amazing kiss after she'd won the Quidditch match when out of the blue, the man of her dreams had kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>But it wasn't enough. She wanted to taste him, smell him feel him. Right here and now, she needed to be his, for him to take her. She wanted to strip away the Auror, the celebrity, the father and leave nothing behind but a raging bull that only she could sate.</p><p> </p><p>She started ripping off their clothes as fast as she could.</p><p> </p><p>“What's gotten into you, Gin?” asked Harry, as he tugged his robe off.</p><p> </p><p>“You, in a minute. Then everything will be all right.”</p><p> </p><p>“This was your emergency... a- a booty call?”</p><p> </p><p>“Please Harry it's been sooo long since we've just fucked like this... like animals!” said Ginny as she fought with the zip of her jeans.</p><p> </p><p>“Like teenagers you mean,” said Harry smiling. He placed his warm hands on Ginny's, and she stilled. He took hold of her zip and slowly pulled it down.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want, Gin?” he asked, eyes locked with hers.</p><p> </p><p>“I need you to fuck me as hard as you can, any way you can.” she said as firmly as she could.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked uncertain for a fraction of a second before a familiar look came over his face. It was that blazing look he'd had the first time they'd kissed.</p><p> </p><p>He roughly pulled her jeans down to mid-thigh, making her lose her balance slightly. As she almost stumbled, he grabbed her by the waist and spun her on the spot. He bent her over, her chest lying flat on the kitchen table.</p><p> </p><p>“Please Harry, please I need it please fuck MEEEEEEEEE” Ginny's begging was cut off as Harry knelt down behind her and pressed his face into her sex, his tongue dancing on her hot flesh.</p><p> </p><p>“Merlin Ginny, what's got you so wet?”</p><p> </p><p>He buried his face right into her. His rained kisses and licks all over her now drippy slit then pulled back and breathed in deeply. Ginny felt his large hands kneading her ass, and then he pulled, and her flower bloomed in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>She felt his breath, cool on here boiling skin as he came close and with agonising slowness, he drew his tongue from the bass her spread lips all the way down to her clit, which he began to circle relentlessly.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny was in heaven; he was worshipping her cunt with his face. It felt like they hadn't done this in years. But it wasn't enough. She wanted him to be rough with her, to ache with the presence of him, to feel him using her as only he ever would. She needed to give herself wholly to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Please Harry, please fuck me, just fuck me, please I need it, please, I'm ready I can take it, as hard as you can, please fuck me, fill me... please I want to feel you stretch me, bury yourself in me.”</p><p> </p><p>She chanted this into the polished wood of the kitchen table, her hair a wild tangle, her hand grasping to the wood for dear life.</p><p> </p><p>Harry abruptly stood, and she sensed him shuffle then the heard the sound of a zip, followed by rustling. She froze when she felt him rest his length on her, lying hot and weighty between the cleft of her ass, making its way up to her lower back.</p><p> </p><p>“You want this?” he teased.</p><p> </p><p>All Ginny could do was breathlessly chant please over and over. Finally, he drew himself back, his thick shaft sliding over her skin until the tip was pressing against her cunt. She waited for him to push into her.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, he just held still as she squirmed and mewled underneath him.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny had never been a patient woman, least of all now. She was done asking; she was done playing. She grabbed hold of the table and began to push back onto him.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed and pushed and pushed until she finally came to rest against his hips. She knew she'd be tender after this, having completely forgone the usual ceremony of taking him bit by bit, but damn it; she wanted to ache of him.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was speechless. Who was this succubus and what had she done with his wife? Not that he was capable of complaining right now. What with their busy careers, seven kids and finding time to be social, it had been years since he'd found Ginny in a state like this.</p><p> </p><p>The last time had resulted in Fabian, Gideon and Ariana.</p><p> </p><p>And the way she'd impaled her self on his hard cock was doing all sorts of wonderful things to him. The creature in his chest roared its approval, urging him on.</p><p> </p><p>Harry leant over Ginny, placing his hand over hers which was flat on the table. With the other, he bunched up her mane of red hair and began to relentlessly thrust into his gorgeous wife.</p><p> </p><p>For Ginny, Harry's plunging length both soothed and stoked the burning fire in her core. He dove into her in long slow, relentless thrusts, then pivoted back, rolling his hips so the tip of his amazing cock dragged itself along the roof of her tunnel.</p><p> </p><p>Each stroke he pulled out all the way until just the broad head of his cock threatened to burst from her stretched lips, passing over that spot. And Each stroke made Ginny shudder more and more.</p><p> </p><p>This is what she needed. This is who she needed. Only her Harry could make her feel this way, and she loved it, love him.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny drew one of Harry's large, calloused hands to her soft red lips and started frantically kissing it, her mind desperate to show how much she needed him. She Lifted off the table slightly to look at him, only for his free hand to push her back down.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” was all he said, his voice deep and husky, “Bad girls who scare their husbands get fucked from behind on the kitchen table. Isn't that right?” he asked, hilting himself deep inside her, and pressing his hips hard against her ass.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny couldn't speak, his dick had knocked the wind out of her, all the came out was a deep, satisfied gurgle.</p><p> </p><p>Harry started to move again, faster and harder this time. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Ginny knew that her thighs would be bruised black and blue from being smashed against the edge of the table, but she didn't care, all that mattered right now was feeling her man.</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny you're so wet, you're so hot, and I'm so close. Please,” he panted, “please cum for me. Show me how hard you can cum!”</p><p> </p><p>He started to swell inside her, a sure sign that he was moments away from filling her completely with his beautiful thick cum! She flashed back to Astoria force feeding the very same cum to Draco, the cum that she had coaxed from the heavy swinging balls that where right now slapping onto the back of her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny Potter came hard.</p><p> </p><p>“Hhnnnnnnnnnggggggggghhhhh!” groaned Ginny, almost biting her tongue as her jaw clenched, her everything clenched. She couldn't breathe, she couldn't move all she could do was squeeze.</p><p> </p><p>Her cock stuffed cunt bore down on the steel hard rod inside it for a long moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Merlin Ginny,” Gasped Harry, “you're so fucking tight, gonna’ cum!”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny managed to gasp in some air and then she felt Harry pulse deep inside of her and the pressure building inside of her finally burst.</p><p> </p><p>She cried out animalistically, the veins in her neck bulging, her nails scraping deep into the wood of the table, Harry's squeezing her waist tight as he pushed every last millimetre into her.</p><p> </p><p>Clear, sparkling fluid surged out of Ginny, coating Harry's balls as they constricted hard against Harry's broad shaft as he coated her cervix in his seed. And all Ginny could do was howl in pleasure, her world blurry and warm and breathless as endless ropes of cum were pumped deep into her sex.</p><p> </p><p>She could hear Harry groaning loudly behind her, and she started to shudder, the stream of girl cum started to splatter down her thighs in time with her full body shakes. And still, Harry was groaning and pulsing and pulling at her hips with all his strength.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, after an age, their eruptions slowed to a trickle and Harry who'd been taut as a bowstring, collapsed on top of her, breathing hard into her ear.</p><p> </p><p>Between breaths, he mumbled, “love you,” over and over.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny was lost to the world. Everything was perfect. The warmth of her core, the profound wetness of Harry's cum within her, the weight of him on top of her and the familiar smells of home, mixed in with liberal amounts of their scents.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shifted behind her, trying to stand up, but his footing slipped on the puddle that Ginny had made on the polished wooden floor. He fell backwards and instinctively held onto Ginny's hips, his still hard cock, almost picking her up off the table, and together they collapsed back onto the ground, Ginny still stuffed chock full of her husbands cock.</p><p> </p><p>Harry let out a groan as he recovered from the shock, causing Ginny to laugh. This, in turn, caused Harry to moan in a very different way and soon they were kissing, Ginny lying on top of Harry, Her head resting on his shoulder, her hand idly playing with her folds.</p><p> </p><p>They stayed joined at the waist for a long time, both catching their breaths, kissing and occasionally laughing as Harry ran his hands lightly up and down Ginny, while she stared contentedly up at the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>Harry suddenly tensed underneath her, his abs pushing into her back, “Oh no, your meeting!”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny thought for a moment, then relaxed back into her husband, “Bugger it, there's no place I'd rather be.”</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Later that night, after several cleaning spells and a long bath together, Ginny and Harry sat at the table with their seven wonderful children enjoying dinner together. The serenity of their parents seemed to have infected the children, and none of the usual squabbles tested the peace of the house that night as they listened attentively to what everyone had done that day.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny was in paradise, she leaned into Harry's arms and savoured the moment. At times like these, she was tempted to try for another child; it would be wonderful to have another baby around the house.</p><p> </p><p>She sighed contentedly. Seven, seven was enough for anyone.</p><p> </p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Late that night Ginny was roused from pleasant dreams by a sharp rapping on the bedroom window, blearily she looked up to see the familiar sight of a Malfoy owl, holding another letter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
