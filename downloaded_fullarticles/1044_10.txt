    <p align="center">"Double, double toil and trouble;<br/>Fire burn, and cauldron bubble."</p>
<p align="center">William Shakespeare, <em>Macbeth</em> 1606</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="left">On New Oxford Street in central London, a short walk east of the Centre Point Tower, there is a run-down building of six crumbling storeys.  Its brick façade is pollution-stained.  Shutters cover most of its windows.  The doors have shed much of their flaking paintwork and sport heavy, rust-flecked padlocks.  To one side of the doors, a large sign informs of ongoing renovations within.</p>
<p>This building was once a department store.  If Westminster City Council's Planning Office is to be believed, there is every intention that it will become one again.  The fact that the renovation works are currently running six decades behind schedule seems to be of little concern to anyone.  Nor does the absence of (now presumably geriatric) builders on site appear to cause alarm.  The applications have been filed and processed, the permissions granted, and each letter has been inked upon the prerequisite paperwork with suitable attention to detail: i's dotted, t's crossed.  If anything, the unchanging nature of the place is a comfort.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people walk along New Oxford Street each day.  They are a disparate lot, these passers-by: all ages, shapes and sizes.  All types of background, too.  Some walk this stretch of pavement on a daily basis; some will never come here again.  Each one, however, has something in common with the rest.</p>
<p>It is a feeling that all is as it should be.</p>
<p>And so they keep on walking, sparing no more thought for the building, nor for its sixty-year refurbishment hiatus.</p>
<p>In fact, this building has existed in central London since the seventeenth century.  The dilapidated store-front is only its most recent disguise.  Along with the Ministry of Magic in Whitehall, Hogwarts Castle in the Highlands, and perhaps Gringotts Wizarding Bank in Diagon Alley, it is one of the institutional cornerstones to British magical society.</p>
<p>It is St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.  And its doors, should you know where to look, are always open.</p>
<p>It is a strange beast, St Mungo's.  On the surface, it is a shining example of good-sense and organisation that neither the Ministry nor Hogwarts could ever hope to match.  Each floor of the hospital has its own specialised department.  A Welcome Witch or Wizard sits at a reception desk on the ground floor, directing both patients and visitors with a well-practised scowl.  Spell damage, artefact accidents, creature-induced injuries, magical diseases: all varieties of magical maladies are treated here, self-inflicted or otherwise.  There is even a ward dedicated to the long-term care of witches and wizards who have sustained irreparable damage.</p>
<p>In addition to the departments on its upper floors, St Mungo's has several sub-levels.  For instance, three floors beneath St Mungo's reception you will find a set of tiled rooms and corridors lit by floating glow-globes that emit a hollow kind of blue-white light.  This area provides the more unfortunate services necessary to the running of any hospital, magical or otherwise: namely, the morgue and its associated examination rooms.</p>
<p>Above the morgue, acting as a buffer between life and death in a more literal sense than is strictly necessary, is St Mungo's long-term storage level.  While situated on a single floor, accessed from a single landing on the main stairway, the topography of the storage level becomes ever more eccentric the further in you go.  Magical extensions have been applied, often repeatedly, to some of its sections.  Its dimensions would make no sense at all to Muggle architects.  Tape measures, plans drawn meticulously to scale, the so-called laws of physics: none of that is of any help here.</p>
<p>The long-term storage at St Mungo's has become something of a legend in its own structural lifetime.  The chambers on this level vary wildly.  Some are the size of a generous wardrobe; some would house the average cathedral with space left over.  They accommodate numerous environments, magically enchanted for the items stored or nurtured within.  A couple are airless, requiring those who enter to cast a Bubble-Head Charm.  Some rooms are frost-rimed, some cloying and humid, some drier than a particularly parched sidewinder on a baking hot day in the Namib desert.  One room is kept in perpetual and absolute darkness; navigating its confines requires the casting of <em>Insono-Chiroptus</em> to avoid bumping into things.</p>
<p>Within the chambers can be found a truly mind-boggling variety of ingredients both living and harvested, along with stores of prepared potions.  One room fizzes with magical potential, filled as it is with enchanted items infused with complex spellwork.  Some of these items are unique; not even the illustrious International Artefacts Archive in Alexandria can claim their equal.  Others are as commonplace as Sneeze-Away Hankies, Anti-Corn Socks or the numerous types of undergarments infused with diminishing and dispelling charms.  (Male wizards, usually at a certain point in puberty, tend to get creative with spells like <em>Engorgio</em>.  The results are inevitably disastrous, though, thankfully, treatable.)</p>
<p>The hospital's small but renowned library is also on this level.  Among its collection of texts, scrolls and periodicals are items which predate the Muggle printing press by several centuries.</p>
<p>Above the long-term storage level, one brief flight of stairs down from the hospital's reception, you will find cloakroom facilities for the hospital's staff.  On this floor there is also a suite of rooms intended for meetings and teaching, one of which is officially the best-equipped teaching laboratory in the UK, according to a 1995 poll conducted by <em>The Practical Potioneer</em>.  (Admittedly St Mungo's had minimal competition, and won mainly because its laboratory is not freezing cold, ill-lit and poorly ventilated.  Or, indeed, a dungeon.)</p>
<p>Usually, this laboratory is used to teach apprentice Healers the intricacies of the most widely used healing potions.  The year 1998, however, did not qualify as 'usual'.  (The culmination of an earth-shattering war between the magical forces of darkness and light had, oddly enough, disrupted quite a few routines.)</p>
<p>Thus, in the late summer of that year the teaching laboratory at St Mungo's was co-opted into a different service.  It was made available to those former Hogwarts students who, for various reasons, were unable to return to school to finish their NEWT level Potions qualification.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>The lessons were scheduled to begin in early September and would run for a single term.  It was expected that the entirety of the final year curriculum would be covered; the course of study would be intensive.  Two afternoons each week were timetabled for brewing, and an additional two hour tutorial would accommodate theory and coursework discussion.</p>
<p>To the astonishment of everyone, not least the man himself, Severus Snape agreed to take the classes.</p>
<p>This was – as it turned out – just as well.  While Horace Slughorn would remain at Hogwarts for one more year to allow Headmistress McGonagall the time to search for a replacement, the elderly Potions professor was increasingly infirm and, as such, unable to contribute to the 'War Year Revisional Project': the rather pompous title this collection of courses was given in its Ministry paperwork.  (Less formally, the classes were known as the 'Lost Sevenths' since the participants were those students whose seventh and final year at Hogwarts had been made discommodious by the presence of Death Eaters, beatings, torture and, in some cases, an absence from school entirely due to the imminent threat of being murdered.)</p>
<p>Since the war had ended, a good deal of information had emerged about the role Snape had played in the plan to bring down Voldemort.  Snape's acquittal of all charges before the Wizengamot had been far from triumphant.  (A more accurate description would be 'painful' or perhaps 'wince-worthy'.)  The trial itself, however, had been well attended and the press had been meticulous in its coverage.  Snape's seventeen-year commitment to the cause had been exposed, along with his loyalty to Dumbledore and his numerous personal sacrifices.  Post-trial, the sideways glances Snape drew were no longer those of alarm and suspicion, but instead offered respect and, sometimes, a smidgeon of sympathy.  At least in the over-forties set; those who had been taught by him would never completely lose the sense of discomfort they felt in Snape's presence.  It would seem that no matter how heroic a man's deeds, they will never supplant the memory of callous sarcasm, cruelly-engineered punishments and a permanently deep-set scowl.  Given that Severus Snape's tale of redemption had become a <em>cause célèbre</em>, the man himself no doubt viewed his less celebrated legacy as something of a silver lining.</p>
<p>While Snape had undergone a very public metamorphosis from 'sinister killer' to 'heroic force for good' (or, perhaps more accurately, 'morally-conflicted antihero') this proved a double-edged sword for the man himself.  In an interview given to <em>The Quibbler</em> under protest, and motivated primarily by a desire to punish the <em>Daily Prophet</em> for a series of unpleasant articles published over the years, Snape even claimed to have preferred the suspicion to this newfound sympathy, which he described as "the uninvited pity of those who fail to appreciate context."</p>
<p>The <em>Daily Prophet's</em> reporting on Snape's trial had been surprisingly balanced.  Given that Harry Potter's correspondence with the newspaper's Editor-in-Chief was not public knowledge, most put this development down to the way Rita Skeeter had resigned from the publication.  The odious reporter had spent a single unsatisfactory month as the arts correspondent: a brief tenure that had culminated in a confrontation with the Centaur poet, Pavel, after the debut of his latest six-hundred verse epic: <em>Ode to the Clustering Pleiades</em>.</p>
<p>Skeeter, it seemed, did not find star-gazing nearly as compelling a topic as Pavel did.  Though many would sympathise with her position (especially by the time the recitation reached its three hundred and thirty-second stanza), most would have thought twice before interrupting the performance.  Yet Skeeter had stood on her chair and announced to the room that she was fed up to the back teeth with protagonist Aldebaran, and found his hopeless devotion to the Seven Sisters about as touching as a tension-headache which, by the way, she was well on the way to suffering if Pavel didn't shut the hell up right about <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>The room, unfortunately for Skeeter, contained a number of very large, muscular and short-tempered Centaurs.  To claim that Pavel's be-hooved fanclub was unimpressed by Skeeter's attempt at constructive criticism would be an understatement.</p>
<p>Upon her discharge from St Mungo's, her pride the only wound left untreated, Skeeter promptly declared that she was finished with the <em>Daily Prophet</em> and, indeed, with the "whole bloody country."  She moved on to a short and uncharacteristically sweet term at <em>The Prattler</em> (one of America's more squalid magical tabloids) before disappearing into much appreciated obscurity.</p>
<p>But we were talking about Severus Snape.</p>
<p>Few people in Wizarding Britain had been actively concerned about the notion of Snape once again taking up the reins of tutelage.  There were, nonetheless, a great many raised eyebrows.  Severus Snape was admired for his intellect, his magical skill and his dedication to Albus Dumbledore, but for most it would be a stretch to claim to like him.  And in the light of the aforementioned information that had emerged during his trial, many people were convinced that he despised teaching <em>and</em> children in more or less equal measure.</p>
<p>This view was not inaccurate.</p>
<p>It did not bode well for that small group of Lost Seventh students who were sitting NEWT level Potions.  It certainly went some way to explaining the not insignificant number of students who considered the Hobson's Choice that was a return to Hogwarts vs. Professor Snape and chose, instead, to make the short hop across the Channel to Beauxbatons.</p>
<p>There were, however, a handful of students who looked favourably on the Snape option.  Perhaps their attitude was swayed by a preference for the devil they knew.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>In St Mungo's hospital there worked a Healer named Montague.  She had become particularly invested in the Lost Sevenths project for two reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, she was married to a Muggle-born wizard.  During the war, in the interests of self-preservation, their family had retreated to a small coastal village in the Republic of Ireland.  Healer Montague – Gloria, to her friends – had thus been invested, very personally, in the outcome of the war.  Having been unable to do more than keep her own nearest and dearest safe, she felt indebted towards those people who had made the country a place where, once again, her family could live unthreatened.</p>
<p>Secondly, she had met Hermione Granger.  They had become acquainted on the day Augustus Rookwood had infiltrated the hospital disguised as a staff member, murdered a young Auror and attempted to murder both Miss Granger and Severus Snape.  Gloria Montague had been impressed by young Miss Granger.  During subsequent meetings – Miss Granger being required to attend the hospital twice a week in order to keep a cursed injury from deteriorating – the subject of her reluctance to return to Hogwarts had come up.</p>
<p>At this point, Gloria had realised that St Mungo's could help.  She had taken her idea to the board of the hospital, and had spoken up in favour of making St Mungo's facilities available.  In spite of the odd voice of protest, she'd proved to be an irresistible force in this regard.</p>
<p>It should be noted that few people who knew her <em>ever</em> took Gloria Montague on in debate.</p>
<p>It was Healer Montague who was tasked to show Severus Snape the potions laboratory St Mungo's had generously provided.  Gloria summarised the facilities as he looked around, paying her little attention.  He presented the room with his finest sneer.</p>
<p>"The ingredients grown and stored on the long-term storage level below will be made available to your classes," Gloria said.  "Some of them will be rather better than the ones you've been accustomed to using at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>Snape grunted.  And continued to sneer.  And naturally enough, Gloria thought little of it.  There were many who considered Snape's sneer a permanent feature, no more worthy of attention than an eye or a nose.  In any case, Gloria was not the type to be ruffled by curled lips and disdainful glares; she had a Muggle mother-in-law.  From Tunbridge Wells.  Who wore twinsets with pearls.  As such, Gloria Montague had long developed a shield to even the most potent of sneers.</p>
<p>"There will be a limit on some of the more valuable ingredients you can requisition, of course," she added.  "The restrictions will be made clear to you by the duty Storekeep."</p>
<p>Another grunt.</p>
<p>Gloria was polite enough not to roll her eyes at Snape's less-than-courtly responses.  "Your wand will be registered with the long-term storage level, allowing you access.  You'll be expected to collect the materials yourself, and to return any unused.  While the board has agreed to this loan of the hospital's facilities, it would prefer to avoid any substantial addition to the workload of its staff.  I think you'll agree that's fair enough."</p>
<p>A grunt.  A curt nod.  Nonetheless, it seemed that Snape was not impressed with the hospital's largesse.  Indeed – perhaps because his sneers had failed to disconcert the Healer – he resorted to a verbal explanation.</p>
<p>Specifically:-</p>
<p>He had <em>liked</em> the dungeons at Hogwarts.  Yes, fine, they'd been a terrible place to brew, but they had suited his preferences.</p>
<p>He <em>liked</em> low levels of light.  Gloria asked whether this was because it made it much easier to lurk, but Snape would only concede that dimness allowed one to hide a multitude of sins.</p>
<p>He <em>liked</em> the cold.  Gloria guessed, accurately (and, for that matter, rather bravely, because she guessed out loud) that this was because Snape could easily stick his own hands in his sleeves or under his arms as he stalked the classroom.  It was only the students who suffered the uncomfortable extremes of temperature while they worked.  After listening to Gloria's theory, Snape corrected only the word 'worked', for which he substituted the words 'savaged delicate potions ingredients with their ham-fisted attempts at brewing'.</p>
<p>Clearly annoyed by Gloria's continued composure, Snape raised his voice and informed her that, most of all, he <em>liked</em> the notion of thick stone walls, buried underground, that even a powerful blasting curse could not breach.  Up in the towers, even at Hogwarts, you were exposed.  Not in the dungeons.  They were safe and secure and had offered him the choice of three hidden exit passageways avoiding all main thoroughfares.</p>
<p>"Always," he told Gloria Montague, "leave yourself a back-door."</p>
<p>Gloria gently suggested that he might want to talk to someone about these issues he had with vulnerability, and sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Severus Snape was not placated.  The opposite, in fact.  He proceeded to tour the potions laboratory, gesturing here and there.  This well-appointed teaching room, with its wide counter spaces and work stations complete with wandless running water, cauldron stands and charmed ventilation ducts, offended him greatly.  The illumination globes were bright and neutral.  The temperature was magically maintained at just below a comfortable 20 degrees (rendering Snape's preferred teaching robes far too heavy and uncomfortable).  The stools at the work stations were upholstered.  Cushions!  Snape told Gloria that he wouldn't be surprised to learn that the students who used this room were also offered house-elves to do all their work for them.  And perhaps a cup of tea and a novel to enjoy while they did it.</p>
<p>Gloria asked him if he was quite finished.</p>
<p>Snape glared at her and told her that he had the strongest sense that there was pandering afoot.  Also that he resented, profoundly, the notion that this newest generation would be learning how to brew Polyglotia in an environment that was so unhampered by the difficulties he had navigated when he'd learned the same thing.</p>
<p>(Severus Snape had never actually heard someone say, "The youth of today don't know they're born!"  But he would have had tremendous sympathy with the sentiment if he had.)</p>
<p>After an uncomfortable pause which, oddly, seemed to bother Snape far more than it bothered Gloria, Snape acknowledged that, yes, he was quite finished now, and thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>Because of course, potions classrooms were not ten-a-penny.  There was no lengthy list of alternative options to choose from.  (Nor was there a <em>short</em> list, for that matter.)  St Mungo's help was therefore gratefully accepted.</p>
<p>And for Severus Snape, as well as his small group of Lost Sevenths, an offensively functional laboratory in the basement of the hospital remained a preferable location to one that was even in the vague vicinity of Hogwarts Castle.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>Fortunately, Snape was a man accustomed to grinding his teeth at injustice and then simply getting on with things.  He'd had lots of practice.  So he prepared his lessons and worked out the timetable and took small consolation where he could.</p>
<p>For instance: Healer Montague was quite right.  St Mungo's ingredient store was highly prized among potioneers in Britain and, indeed, across Europe.  Gaining access to such a resource was pleasing.</p>
<p>Then there was the issue of cauldron maintenance.  St Mungo's did not, in fact, have house-elves.  Nor did Snape have any intention of doling out detentions; not when this would eat into his own free time.  Given that each work station came complete with a nice big sink, his students could bloody well see to the cleaning and oiling of their own set of potion-brewing tools, thank you very much.  If they were serious about their craft then these skills had to be learned, even if time and facilities had rarely provided the opportunity at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>His former Slytherins would be furious.  He was quite sure some of them had never, in their whole lives, washed anything that was not attached to their own body.  For that matter he could name some whose bodies were, he suspected, far from well acquainted with soap and water.</p>
<p>So that would be entertaining, at least.</p>
<p>And then there was the intensive nature of this whole exercise.  A moment of weakness had prompted him to offer these lessons.  The months to follow would no doubt be taxing, but for a man who'd committed to a cause that had required almost two decades of investment it wasn't such a burden.  By Christmas the course would be finished, and he would never have to teach again.</p>
<p>In spite of himself and his own cynical nature, Severus Snape had experienced something of a paradigm shift in recent months.</p>
<p>When he'd regained consciousness in hospital following the Battle of Hogwarts, he had been dismayed to find that he was still expected to go through the rigmarole of drawing breath.  But then had come several annoying weeks of uninvited company, and coaxing, and challenge.  Remarkably, as he'd progressed through the early stages of his recovery, he'd found himself resenting that company less and less.</p>
<p>The need to focus on his trial, and then the anticipation of resuming his teaching duties, meant that such things had been put to one side for the time being.  Annoyingly, the withdrawal had left something of an absence in his life.  It was not unthinkable, however, that once his Lost Seventh obligations had been discharged, the annoyances and challenges might perhaps resume.</p>
<p>Snape would have rather been dipped in jam then hurled at a wasps' nest than admit it, but he was cautiously looking forward to that time.</p>
<p>Optimism.</p>
<p>He'd often wondered what it felt like.</p>
