    <p>Draco’s slow, sucking kisses – his lips parted just enough for Ron to feel the heat of his mouth – always made Ron shiver. Those same kisses on the head of his cock left him mindwiped and moaning.</p><p>Draco parted his lips and slid smoothly down. Ron’s hips bucked and he grabbed for Draco’s soft hair – the little tease was <i>not</i> allowed to pull back now – </p><p>Draco spluttered, then let his teeth graze Ron’s cock. It was a warning, and Ron wasn’t as stupid as all that. He let go of Draco’s hair, and his boyfriend sat back with an acid glare.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>“I’ve told you not to pull my hair, Weasley!”<p>“You used to like it.” Ron tried, and failed, not to hitch his hips towards Draco’s lips. His cock was slick and aching from Draco’s mouth, and Draco was still kneeling between his legs giving him that angry look, and he <i>knew</i> what that did to him – </p><p> “So what? You’re making me lose my hair! You’re always pulling it when I go down on you, or when you want to feel all butch – not to speak of your stealing my comb, which can’t be good for it – ”</p><p>“For goodness’ sake – ”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>Ron caught sight of Draco’s still-straining erection, and lost his patience.<p>Draco was still ranting, his white-blond hair falling over his pink, screwed-up face. Ron slid his hand into Draco’s hair. </p><p>“Stop it! You’re such an oaf. We can’t all be naturally possessed of a full head of flaming hair –”</p><p>Ron slid his hand back, and fisted it at the nape of Draco’s neck, twisting his hair in his grip. Draco’s head was forced back, even as he tensed his neck to scowl at Ron. “Would you – ”</p><p>“Shush,” Ron said, putting a finger to Draco’s wet, open lips.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>Ron’s voice was hoarse with need. “You’re going to stop telling me how it’s my fault that you’re balding.” Draco’s face lit with outrage, but Ron put his hand over his mouth. The sight of his big, square hand over Draco’s pointy face was fantastic. “You can tell me off later. You got me hard, you little prick-tease – ” He used the hand at Draco’s neck to haul him forward until his wide grey eyes were inches from Ron’s swollen cock – “so you’re going to suck me off. And I’ll pull your hair if necessary to make you do it.”<center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>Draco’s face went slack as his pupils swallowed up his eyes. Ron felt a swelling of lust and triumph at the evidence of how he could affect his ever-so-composed boyfriend. Draco lowered his eyes and his head, and swallowed Ron’s cock once again.<p>Uh, it was amazing. Ron rocked his hips steadily, sawing his cock over Draco’s plush lips, forcing himself further in. Draco’s tongue worked its magic. He was sucking harder now, his mouth working around Ron’s shaft.</p><p>“Come on, stroke yourself,” Ron got out in a pained growl. </p><p>Draco shuddered helplessly and dropped his hand between his legs.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>Draco was rough with himself; his strained, flushed face broadcast his need. He sucked Ron ever harder as he stroked himself – so desperate. Like he needed the weight of a cock in his mouth; like the rising sound of Ron’s groans was his only route to orgasm.<p>Ron’s hands were both in his hair now: he couldn’t resist using that beautiful soft hair, the mark of his august family, as reins to fuck his mouth. The sounds he was making were guttural, uncontrolled. Draco moaned around his cock.</p><p>Ron pulled back as he came: he wanted Draco to taste it.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>He was still shuddering with aftershocks as he reached down, planted two hands in Draco’s armpits and hauled him up into his lap. Draco spluttered, half-protesting in his confusion.<p>Ron shushed him, wrapping his left arm around him just above his arse to keep him upright. The other hand went to Draco’s swollen cock.</p><p>Draco’s swollen mouth dropped open with a hiss at Ron’s experienced touch. “Oh – ”</p><p>Ron smiled. <i>No more protests now</i>.</p><p>Draco wrapped his arms round Ron’s shoulders and straddled him, rocking his hips into Ron’s grip. Ron stared up into his face, unable to look away.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>Draco’s face was blotchy, his mouth reddened and half-wrecked with Ron’s mistreatment, his eyes screwed up as he panted under Ron’s hand. Ron kept stripping his cock, efficiently making Draco fall apart.<p>Draco groaned, the sound loud and disjointed as if he were in pain. Ron leant forward and closed his mouth round one hard nipple, and Draco was done for. His body jerked as he shuddered with orgasm, and Ron held him up, stroking him through. He kept on for a moment too long, smiling at Draco’s hiss from the touch on his oversensitive cock, before letting him go.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~</p>
</center>Draco squirmed nearer, and they stayed there, overheated bodies pressed heavily together. Their chests moved still closer as they panted.<p>Eventually they made their way up the bed to lie together. Ron stroked Draco’s hair, and a frown appeared above Draco’s closed eyes. Ron kissed his sweaty forehead.</p><p>“It won’t make you lose your hair,” Ron said. “Besides, I don’t mind if you do. As long as you have enough for me to pull it… and if one day you do go bald, there’s always pulling you around by your cock.”</p><p>“How sweet.” Oddly, Draco sounded like he meant it.</p>
