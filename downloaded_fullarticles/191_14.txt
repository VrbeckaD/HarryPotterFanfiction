    <p>"Dismissed. Thor, stay behind."</p><p>Loki bowed, and exited the throne room with a sigh and a fierce command not to speak out.</p><p>Odin had called for Thor and Loki to privately advise him on the updated trade agreement with Vanaheim. Loki had been so excited to be asked on that day, hoping that with his 750th birthday, he'd finally get a say.</p><p>To Loki's frustration, though, his suggestions were dismissed out of hand. In fact, Odin and Thor hadn't even seemed to realize what day it was.</p><p>Not to mention, Thor's idiotic demands were actually given thought. For Thor, his father had taken time to explain why they couldn't demand better trades. Honestly, the oaf barely seemed to understand that Vanaheim was their <em>ally</em>; they were to be negotiated with, not blatantly commanded.</p><p>"Loki!"</p><p>Oh, great, here came the oaf. Loki forced the hurt and frustration off his face and turned to face Thor, a small bit of hope flaring in his chest. "Brother, how can I help you?"</p><p>"We are planning a great Hunt, Loki, and you must come! There is sure to be a decent fight or two. Perhaps you can finally slay a beast!"</p><p>Loki's face fell, and Thor missed the flash of pain and disappointment that he quickly covered up with a scowl. "Thor, I have already bested many a creature," Loki pointed out.</p><p>Thor rolled his eyes dismissively. "Yes yes, using your tricks," he said. "This time, brother, you will face down a beast like a real man! It will be glorious!"</p><p>Right, that decided it. There was no way Loki was going to get himself stuck with a bunch of Thor's friends just to be bullied and ridiculed the whole time. Norns knew he'd made that mistake before.</p><p>"As much as I'd love to, Thor," he said, letting a bit of sarcasm seep into his voice. He knew it would be missed anyway. "As much as I'd love to, Thor, I think I will have to decline. I have other plans."</p><p>Thor pouted at that. "Come on, brother! Whatever you're doing can't be as important as a Hunt!"</p><p>"First of all, Thor," he said a bit sharply, "Just because the Hunt is important to <em>you</em> doesn't mean that there aren't other things I'd rather be doing, or that my things aren't as important as your Hunt. Second of all, I really am going to have to decline, Thor, although I of course wish you good hunting."</p><p>"Fine, brother. But we'll make a man of you yet!" And Thor went bounding off. No "Happy Birthday," no "Enjoy your plans," not even a polite "See you later!" Instead Loki was left with an empty corridor and an unwitting insult.</p><p>That was what had always hurt most, Loki decided. The casual, unthinking, <em>uncaring</em> way Thor insulted Loki, as if Loki's so-called failure was just a fact of life. It hurt, for his talents to be ignored and his presence dismissed. "Dismissed," Odin had said, before he asked Thor to remain.</p><p>Loki shook off his thoughts and retreated to his quarters. There, he quickly packed a small bag and vanished it into his pocket void. He almost teleported then and there, but a last-minute thought had him jotting down a quick note. He summoned a servant and gave it to them, "Give this to the Queen, please." He figured the slight delay in deliverance would give him just enough time to slip out. The servant hurried away, and Loki blinked out of Asgard.</p>
<hr/><p>Only a few minutes later, from within the Queen's chambers came an exasperated sigh.</p><p>
  <em>Mother,</em><br/>
<em>I've gone to check on some other realms. They're sure to have something exciting going on. I won't be gone too long, promise.</em><br/>
<em>Love you,</em><br/>
<em>Loki</em></p><p>
Really, the boy couldn't give her a bit more information? Frigga sighed again. She was sure Loki would be fine; he could defend himself physically and magically, and he would surely know how to handle himself, especially since he'd taken independent trips before. Still, he couldn't have at least told her which <em>realm</em>?</p>
<hr/><p>Far away, Loki Odinson appeared on Midgard, smack in the middle of a bustling lane full of shops and businesses. Loki's smile made a brief appearance as he read the name: <em>Diagon Alley</em>.</p>
