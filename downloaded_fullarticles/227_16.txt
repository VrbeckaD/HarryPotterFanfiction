    <p>“Finish your broccoli,” Draco said not looking up from his plate.</p><p>Harry waved a stalk of the offending vegetable, “At least eat a bite.” </p><p>Draco glared over at Harry, “Don’t undermine me, Potter.”</p><p>Harry widened his eyes and shrugged.</p><p>Albus and Scorpius looked from Harry to Draco. James rolled his eyes. Lilly giggled.</p><p>Draco shook his head, half rolling his eyes, “Three bites of broccoli,” he conceded.</p><p>“Or no dessert,” Harry added.</p><p>Draco grinned, “Exactly.”</p><p>Albus and Scorpius groaned in unison,“Buuut DAAAA-AAD!”</p><p>Harry gasped in mock shock, “Did you just call me butt-dad?”</p><p>“I think they did,” Draco said, trying to hide a smile.</p><p>“You’re awful,” Scorpius lamented.</p><p>“I thought your name was Harry?” Draco asked, “You’ve been Awful Buttdad all this time?”</p><p>“I’ve been living a lie,” Harry said flatly.</p><p>“This is the worst,” Albus grumbled, “I can’t wait till we go back to the Hogwarts and we don’t have to hear any more of your jokes.”</p><p>Draco smirked, “We’ve only made four jokes in our entire lives and they’re all sitting right in front of us.”</p><p>“I’m done.” James dropped his fork loudly on his plate, stood and left the table.</p><p>Harry snorted and burst out laughing.</p><p>Draco smiled broadly, holding up his hand. Harry high-fived him.</p><p>Albus dropped his head on the table, “This isn’t worth dessert.”</p><p>Scorpius elbowed him as he quickly ate as much broccoli as he could stuff in his face, “Quick,” he murmured, his mouth full.</p><p>“Lilly thinks it’s funny,” Harry said.</p><p>Draco said, “She has very good taste.” </p><p>Lilly laughed.</p><p>“Lilly is eight,” Albus muttered.</p>
