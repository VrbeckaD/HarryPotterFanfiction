    <p>They are both so calm, Simon barely realizes that he was just barely saved from blackmail. Martin just stands there, like the idiot he is, empty handed and impatient, as if he thinks that Bram is rude for interrupting him, while Bram frowns at both of them, clutching at Simon's letters as if they don't hold each and every one of Simon's secrets. As is they're a tangible thing, a thing outside of Simon's head, a thing visible enough to – well, ruin his life, probably.</p><p>"What's going on in here?" Bram asks, conversationally, as if he's genuinely interested, as if he's not aware of Simon's – situation. Of the position that he is in. About thirty seconds ago, and four minutes into Martin laying out his sordid proposal, Bram had turned up from behind a wall of books near the back, mouth pulled into a tight line, wand raised. So, he had witnessed all of this, which is just… great. It's great.</p><p>Simon has dedicated a very moderate amount of thought to Bram Greenfield up to this point. A guy who Sometimes joins Garret at their lunch table even though he is a Ravenclaw (and Garret is a Gryffindor, and really is only there for Leah, who's a Slytherin – truly, this is an interhouse chaos), a guy who doesn't talk much, doesn't smile much, but is probably smart, and possibly has a nice smile. Simon does not know enough about him to realize if he's in danger, still. If he's better off dealing with Martin alone, or if this is a good thing. Secrets, in general, are the epitome of self-sabotage. One does not wish for help. One wishes to be left alone.</p><p>"The fuck are you doing?" Martin asks, brilliantly, because Martin is one of those people who does not know when to stop, ever. Like, if he was a storm, a tsunami, human kind would be extinct by now, and he would stand there, wondering where everyone had gone to. "We were talking."</p><p>Bram's smile is this insincere twist of his mouth, as if he would rather be anywhere else, really. He probably does. Simon's closeted gay crisis and blackmail extravaganza is probably the worst party in town – Simon is most definitely not having any fun. "This conversation seemed to be progressing toward hostile territory," Bram interjects, almost apologetically. "Regarding a particular stack of parchments who belongs to one of you but the other has taken hold of. As a prefect, I saw fit to get involved."</p><p>Simon blinks at him. Because, yeah, that is one way to put it.</p><p>Martin shakes his head. The three of them are in the library, but right at the back, where there are children books, books written by muggles (just one shelf, of course, who's been repeatedly vandalized), books about gardening. Nobody ever comes here for anything but impure intentions. A muggle born student had tried to smuggle a computer there once – the device exploded. There are still scorch marks on tiles to Simon's right. Undoubtedly, it is a shady place to be. Why is he there again? Oh, right. Blackmail. "This is not what you think." Martin tells him calmly. "I was returning Simon's notes to him."</p><p>Bram raises an unimpressed eyebrow. This is the most expressive Simon has ever seen him. He seems… tense. That is, he squares his shoulders, tilts his chin up, and he's not looking at Simon, his eyes are focused somewhere around Martin's forehead. Simon has heard stories about this – Bram the prefect, calm yet determined, always helpful, always fair. At present, Bram's fingers are clutched around Simon's letters, and Simon wishes that everything would catch fire, except that Bram is an innocent bystander, and does not deserve to be caught in the crossfire of Simon's drama. Except that he wants the letters back.</p><p>"It seems as if you were refusing to return Simon's parchments to him." Bram tells him quietly. And Simon hates this, the mechanics of bullying, the fact that he is not only being blackmailed about his dear diary content, but about  –</p><p>Well, yeah.</p><p>He is truly an idiot. Who forgets his best kept secret at the freakin' library? Not a great secret keeper, that's who. This is how You-know-who used to find people, probably. Because of people like Simon, who were morons.</p><p>Martin shakes his head. "I just borrowed it. He can have them back." He shrugs, as if there was nothing shady about the situation. "I don't care anyway, I mean, I told him that I don't –" He swallows. "It's nothing like that. I was only asking him for help."</p><p>Simon opens his mouth to respond, then closes it. Bram's presence paralyzes him somehow, rendering him useless. He's at a risk of being exposed. He cannot be too careful – clearly, he wasn't so far. And while Bram had the best of intentions, surely, Simon had wanted that particular door to his closet shut. </p><p>So he barely hears Martin when he says: "Anyway, he can have all of it back, I took pictures already."</p><p>"Pictures?" Bram asks.</p><p>Simon's heart stops dead.</p><p>"You know, of the material. I told you, I was only asking him for help." He's smiling slightly, but it doesn't reach his eyes. "Think of it as a cooperation between houses, yeah? A covenant between a Hufflepuff and a Slytherin."</p><p>Bram stares Martin down, mouth slightly agape, but there is nothing to be done, really. Bram might be a fair, kind, and benevolent prefect, but life wasn't – life fucking sucked.</p><p>"So we'll talk later, Simon?" Martin asks him, and after a few beats of silence, Simon realizes the bastard is actually awaiting a response.</p><p>"Fuck you," he tells him, dumbfounded.</p><p>Bram just stairs at him, as if Marvin had shed light on some deep-rooted suspicions Bram has had about the worst of humanity. Simon wonders – he wonders what he knows. What he's heard. "Right, well, I'll be off then –" And Martin leaves, tripping over a copy of Anne From Green Gables on the way out, because why the fuck not.</p><p>"Fifteen point from Slytherin," Bram trails after him, weekly, staring at his hands.</p><p>Which, fuck that, Simon's turmoil is worth more than – it's worth at least – he wants to smash Slytherin's stupid green hourglass to pieces over Martin's stupid head. But whatever. So much for peace and unity amongst houses. Some much for Simon's peace of mind.  </p><p>"Simon –" Bram starts, and Simon wishes, with every fiber of his being, that Bram would not – he wishes for a memory spell. For a Time Turner. For Blue, to be here, and maybe fix this for him. To share this new and horrible thing that had befallen him.</p><p>"I wish I knew how to apparate out of here," he blurts out, which was a relatively honest thing to say. That is, <em>I wish that I could disappear. </em></p><p>Bram blinks at him. "You can't apparate in or out of the castle's grounds," he said slowly, as if afraid of imparting more bad news to Simon.</p><p>Simon does not care. Simon's hands are clenched into fists, and he's currently shaking. "This is bullshit." He manages.</p><p>"I think it's for security purposes –" Bram begins, voice gentle, before realizing what Simon meant. "Oh. Yeah." He swallows. Then, carefully – "Was he – I mean." He bites his lower lip. "What does he want from you?"</p><p>That's when Simon's shoulders sag. He lets himself slide slowly down to the floor, back against a fairly unstable bookshelf, and sighs. Whatever, you know? If he was going to fall, he might as well have witnesses for the injustice. "He wants me to set him up with a friend of mine," Simon explains, just barely. Because it's so ridiculous. Because who does that? Harry Potter has beaten Lord Voldemort on the grounds of this very castle, and Simon is being blackmailed over a pen pal. "Abby."</p><p>"Oh," is Bram's eloquent response. His fingers are pulled briefly to his prefect badge, tapping it once, twice, falling back down.</p><p>Simon's chest constricts in sudden panic. "You can't report him." He swallows. "You won't, won't you? I don't know what you heard. But this isn't just about me, and I'm not ready to – I can't let him…" he trails off. Speaking about himself without coming out of the closet has been complicated, for the past month. There are certain words lodged down his throat, and he can't breathe through them sometimes. He couldn't think sometimes, with the same sort of words pushing against the back of his head, inside his lungs, his heart –</p><p>Had nothing to do with this. This is not that sort of situation, not anymore.</p><p>As Simon lifts his gaze to stare Bram down, sort of like a terrified cat would, he wonders whether Bram feels sorry for him. He wonders why he, himself, did not think to use the Accio charm, while Bram had. He remembers, briefly, Leah, tilting her head to the side while skimming through their third-year homework. 'So what it means,' she announced, 'is that witches and wizards did nothing while muggles burned supposed-witches and homosexuals on the stake, just because they, themselves, could get away with it.' He thinks about a witch, laughing her way through cool flames, while besides her, a person was honest-to-god burning in hell fire. About how one of them had a choice, and the other didn't. He feels sick. "Fuck," he says. "Fuck."</p><p>"Simon –" Bram starts.</p><p>But Simon is done with conversations alluding to his supposed sexuality, ill and well-meaning alike. He is done with this stupid library, where Madam Pince is willing to block absent whispers about school work but is unable to spot with goddamn blackmail. He is just done.</p><p>"I have to go," he says, startling Bram, then moving, moving, pushing rapidly past him. He thinks Bram was calling after him, but he's not sure. It doesn't matter, really. What matters is that he has a problem.</p><p>"Simon!" Bram is definitely calling after him, and Simon doesn't get it, what it is that people want from him. He stops, turns around. "What?"</p><p>"Your letters," Bram says, before shoving the stack of parchments into Simon's hands. He seems relieved, almost, as if something about the combination of ink and paper and Simon's secrets was catching.</p><p>Simon is such a fucking idiot. "Thanks," he tells Bram.</p><p> Then he's once again leaving. He wished that he was a better flyer, that he had a broom, so that he could put any distance between himself and this castle, himself and the ground. He wishes that he had a time turner, so that this wouldn't have happened, or an invisibility cloak, so he could disappear. Magic is useless to him, he thinks bitterly, running down the halls of Hogwarts' school of witchcraft and wizardry. It won’t help him with this one.  </p><p> </p><p>He sees his secret everywhere. In the tilt of Leah's head at the dinner table, or in the way Abby hugs him as they say separate for their different common rooms, the way one obscure ghost passes right through him on his way down, substancesless and cold, sending chills down his spine. Hogwarts is not a place where your private thoughts and feelings are safe, and Simon is more exposed than ever. He should have asked Bram not to say anything. Begged, even. He should not have just left like that. But he didn't, and he had, and now he can't bring himself to fix this.</p><p>There is an added weight to his sexuality now, accompanied by blackmail. Suddenly, it's shameful, even though he swore that it wasn't. Being blackmailed, surely, is shameful. Allowing himself to be – instead of leaping cheerfully out of the closet without a care in the world, and fuck you very much, Martin. Surely that's the right thing to do. But Simon is an Hufflepuff, and sometimes it seems to mean that he can't be loud in any way that matter. He wonders what Bram thinks of him. He wonders what Blue would have done.   </p><p>He does not fall asleep that night. Instead, he hides beneath the covers of his bed, rereading Blue's previous letters, memorizing, as if preparing for the day when he'll have no choice but to burn them, even though he knows that he never will.</p><p>Simon had never, in his life, wished to be straight, but he does wish to have nothing to hide. Secrets are the catalyst of shame. They make things bigger then they have any right to be. And Simon is not ashamed, but Martin must think that he is, Bram Greenfield must think that he is, and Simon is not about to spring out of any closet to prove them wrong, so there you go.</p><p>At least Bram didn't appear to be a homophobic dick. Cute Boys who are homophobic dicks truly represent everything that's unjust in the world.</p><p> </p><p>Morning came at him like a hammer, the notion of the following day and everything it might bring looming over him, making him wish he could turn around and sleep through his sixth and seventh years. He never wished to leave Hogwarts before, but now – really, he just wants his iPod. He would give away almost everything right now, if he could just have that.  </p><p>He dresses slowly, taking special, useless care with his robes, with his black-yellow tie. Would a Gryffindor tell Martin to stuff it, or are closet-cases a recognized phenomenon in each of the four houses? He supposes that they are. Though a part of him wishes that he had in him the recklessness to just jinx Martin into all hell, maybe punch the guy right in his stupid, righteous, blackmailing face. That's what a none-Hufflepuff would have done, surely. But no, he's <em>nice. </em>He's <em>good-natured.</em>  He <em>volunteers</em> to help Professor Sprout off hours and knows the House Elves by name.</p><p>He sighs, running a tired hand through his hair, before retrieving his backpack and making his way to breakfast without waiting for or talking to anyone. It's like, 6:30 AM. Because this is how Simon rolls. The great hall, of course, is almost entirely empty, except for – oh well, that's just great. Simon wished he could talk to Leah. Even without telling her anything, she has this way of – understanding the world, of pointing out injustices to him. With her, he understands that some things are not his fault. He wishes to see Nick or Abby, so that they could make him laugh, except – the hell is he supposed to do with Abby now?</p><p>But instead, there are only a few scattered insomniacs, Professor Sprout, since her plants require care that does not adhere to human sleep schedule, and – Bram Greenfield, sitting by himself at the Ravenclaw table, staring at his oatmeal as if trying to understand the point of it all. So that's… great. That is just fantastic. Simon is not scared of Bram Greenfield, of course. That would be unfair. Simon is just – generally scared.</p><p>Should he sit next to him? It would be weird if he didn't, probably, they usually sit together, as a strange, interhouse group (ironically, it was Leah who initiated the arrangement. They were in their second year, and one of the girls in her room had told her that she can't befriend a Hufflepuff. And so she's been sitting with Simon at his table ever since. It all kind of escalated from there). They never actually spent any time alone, though, excluding the previous day. What would they even talk about? Are there any other topics of conversations for them besides Simon's sexuality? Does Bram even want Simon to sit next to him?</p><p>Except who walks into the great hall next, if not the great blackmailer himself, jerk supreme, one of the villains from Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 6, Martin Addison. And since Simon was not about to be caught alone by him again, not so soon, anyway, he accepts his fate and makes his way resolutely towards Bram, who lifts his head just in time to see Simon marching in his direction. Bram's eyes widen, then, his mouth opening up, just a bit, as if to say something, but Simon can't stop, not until he's safely seated at Bram's right, half hidden by dark curls and wide shoulders. "Morning," he exhales, sending one last look towards the Slytherin table. God, if Leah knew, she would eviscerate the guy.</p><p>But instead, it's Bram who knows, and is currently following Simon's gaze, eyes darkening slightly, before returning to his eggs. "He won't approach you here," Bram promises, and Simon thinks – well, that at least his secrets are in the hands of someone who's soft spoken, who's able to hold things in.</p><p>"Yeah," Simon agrees. "That's the idea." Then, understanding how that must have sounded, he adds: "Not that I don't like sitting with you – ah, I mean, we always sit together, right?"</p><p>Bram gaze reveals nothing as he slowly nods. "Sure." Then, politely, "Would you like some coffee?"</p><p>"God, yes." Simon says immediately. "Barely slept, you know? I –" He then stops himself, embarrassed. Somehow, a part of him feels as if he's not supposed to show how nervous he is about Martin. As if as a Gay Wizard, he should have been prepared for this sort of situation, or at least accept its likelihood and not whine about it like a child. Like, maybe he should have gotten a blackmail insurance. He swallows, then changes the subject. "How come you're up?"</p><p>Because even though Bram doesn't look as… spent, as Simon must look, he seems – well, drained. Fatigued. He shoulders are slumped in a way that makes his entire body pull inwards. Simon sort of want to make him smile, but doesn't feel qualified at the moment. He feels – panicked, and self-centered, and sad. He wishes he could talk to Blue, except he can't actually tell Blue about any of this. He wishes, still, to have his iPod with him. </p><p>Bram shrugs. "Had to study before practice." Right, Quidditch. Sure. Simon considers asking to tag along so he could watch the practice – gazing admiringly at a cute boy flying expertly around the field in a futile attempt to catch a golden orb might actually make him feel better. But both of his best friends are players for the rival teams, and Simon knows that his presence won't be welcome. House unity only goes so far.</p><p>Bram, currently, seems to be struggling with something, his eyes boring into his cup of pumpkin juice as if it can hold a conversation. "Simon…" he starts, and his voice rises and falls like a radio signal, "it's, uh, none of my business." He swallows thickly. What he's doing seems to almost physically pain him, but he soldiers on. Simon can't help but feel impressed. "Have you decided…" he trails off, then shakes himself, and continues, "about what Martin wants from you."</p><p>Simon bites his lower lip, hard. This is why he did not want to sit here, with some hetero dude judging him for hiding, for helping Blue hide. "I'm not sure that –"</p><p>"I'm not judging, I swear!" Bram cuts him off, and it's the most decisive Simon has ever heard him. "I'm just wondering. It can't be easy." He seems to come to a decision. "If you want to talk about it…"</p><p>Simon shakes his head. "It's not just about me," he forces out, "if I'm outed. I can't just do what I want here, I don't –"</p><p>Bram's eyes are wide, and he opens his mouth to speak, but Simon can't, anymore, he can't. "Please," he says, "please don't tell anyone. I know it's a shitty thing to do, what he asks – I know, but please."</p><p>"Woah, Simon, no," Bram raises his hand so quickly it hits Simon's glasses, knocking them of his nose and into a bowl of oatmeal. "Shit. Sorry, I'm sorry."</p><p>Simon, on his part, can't help but laugh, just a bit, as Bram fishes his glasses and cleans them with a napkin, before handing them back to him. "It's okay."</p><p>"I won't tell anyone." Bram says, then, and there's a gravity to his voice, and Simon believes him, truly, he does, but he still feels like shit. It won't go away, probably it's not going to. Probably, Bran can make an Unbreakable Oath to him, and Simon will still be feeling like shit. On pure impulse, Simon turns to look Bram in the eye, almost knocking his coffee of the table with his elbow, and watches as Bram breathes, slowly, through his nose, the way his chest rises, then falls.</p><p>"What would you have done?" he asks quietly, as if that's the secret, as if that's what matters here.</p><p>Bram opens his mouth, then closes it. This was a terrible idea. </p><p>"Forget it, you don't have to – "     </p><p>"No, I – give me a second –"</p><p>"Simon? Merlin, what are you doing up?" It's Garret, annoyingly cheerful, making his way towards them, with Nick in toe. "Is Greenfield's masochism actually catching?"</p><p>Behind him, Nick casually raises a single eyebrow. Simon just shrugs. "Couldn't sleep."</p><p>Garret seems unfazed by this. "We're here to spy on your practice." He tells Bram happily, taking a sit to his left.</p><p>"Naturally," Bram answer, deadpan. He sends Simon A Look – an apology? Whatever it is, Simon attempts a smile – <em>don't worry about it man</em>, and <em>please forget I ever asked you for advice regarding the blackmail situation I'm in, man</em>, and then turns to Nick, who's tie is draped around his neck like a scarf, and who asks to borrow Simon's owl for something later today.</p><p>"Ah," Simon starts awkwardly, "Bieber is actually out right now." And has yet to return with a reply. Not that Simon is anxiously waiting, or anything.</p><p>Bram has to leave for practice, then, stumbling his way out of his chair to the protest of everyone (they are just a bunch of Gryffindors and a Hufflepuff sitting at the Ravenclaw table now, after all) and Simon waves him goodbye.</p><p> Blue does not contact him for the rest of the day.</p>
