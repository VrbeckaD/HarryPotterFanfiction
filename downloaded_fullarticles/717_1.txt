  <u>PROLOGUE</u>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Draco explored the Room of Hidden Things, ablaze with Fiendfyre fury. He walked the burning path, but didn’t feel the lick of pain. He wandered at a deliberate pace, explored the aisles with slow steps.</p><p class="p1">He knew he had time.</p><p class="p1">In the distance, he heard a blood-curdling scream. Crabbe was gone. The fire consumed everything; objects of all sorts were blown into the air, but Draco didn’t hear much, as though he was trudging under water.</p><p class="p1">Finally, he stopped, looked up.</p><p class="p1">He saw himself, atop a tower of blackened desks, clutching Goyle to his chest. He remembered when he thought, for a fleeting moment, that it would be fine to let it happen.</p><p class="p1">To rest.</p><p class="p1">He watched himself let go of Goyle. His friend was soon engulfed by flames, a frozen smile on his face.</p><p class="p1">And then <em>he</em> came.</p><p class="p1">He descended from the skies, his face scrunched up in concentration, his mad hair flapping, and came to an abrupt halt before him.</p><p class="p1">Harry Potter.</p><p class="p1">Draco leaped off his crumbling tower and landed lightly on Harry’s broom. His saviour smelled of fear, sweat, smoke, and the sea.</p><p class="p1">Now he felt it.</p><p class="p1">The blinding terror.</p><p class="p1">Draco tightened his grip around his enemy’s waist, his fingers digging into Harry’s flesh. The flames were everywhere, bearing the faces of monsters he knew.</p><p class="p1">He knew he was dreaming. Dreams were all that was left.</p><p class="p1">Good dreams, bad dreams.</p><p class="p1">This dream.</p>
