    <p>His limp body curled against the wall, shaking in pain and frustration.  So damn close, he thought, trying to string together a rational and coherent mental sentence.  Severus Snape dragged his hand up the corridor wall and pulled himself forward, grunting as blood trickled through his hairline, streaking the contours of his nose, filling the crevices of his lips, a patchwork of dry skin that had clearly been almost regrown before it was brutally ripped off yet again.  </p><p>His calf muscles spasmed, and he grabbed a nearby sconce before he fell, panting in exhaustion.  Having apparated an entire floor above the dungeons, the farthest he’s ever been off after a particularly taxing Commune, Severus was desperately trying to avoid any patrolling staff, or worse, snooping students, in such a compromising position.  The nerves on his left forearm pulsed, as every individual pump of his heart sent blood forcefully through the swollen veins; his impeccable black robes were missing two buttons, his right sleeve was shredded, and blood and bodily fluids soaked the hems of his cloak – to whom they belonged, either himself or another, he was unsure.  </p><p>A second contraction ripped through his back, and he whimpered in pain, inching forward.  Please, please, please, he repeated like a mantra, please, please, please, please.  Two more hallways, just two more.  He had express permission to apparate both to and from Hogwarts on Commune nights; Dumbledore had modified the wards, linking the barrier to the color of his mark.  It was understood this was the only possible method of transport, as any Muggle means would have been too suspicious in the state Severus was sure to be; Dumbledore trusted Severus would be capable of apparating directly into the dungeons, where he could be tended to as needed.  </p><p>Only, Severus thought grimly, Dumbledore overestimated my talents once again.  Had he been clearly thinking earlier in the evening, or expecting a summons, Severus would have realized the 38 third-year Fitness Potions he tested earlier in the day were of much concern; equivalent of a solid 2-hour workout, and doubled with the Cruciatus Curse, his leg muscles were rendered essentially useless.  Despite sampling only a drop from each dose before delivering the lot to Madam Pomfrey, who used them as an alternative to compulsive dieting (The things one will do in the name of societal attractiveness! she thought), the combined effect had taken its toll, unbeknownst to Severus, who now clutched the walls in a rather desperate fashion as his thighs refused to cooperate.  </p><p>“Professor?” asked a female voice, echoing down the corridor.  “Professor Snape?”  Severus froze in trepidation, trembling against the stone wall.  Please, please, not a student, not a stu- he thought. Dainty footsteps drew closer with increasing pace, before breaking into a sprint, deftly striking the floor.  Severus heard a gasp as the intruder stopped, breathing on his back.  </p><p>“Oh God,” a female voice whispered, tinted with something like pity – no, revulsion, thought Severus.  </p><p>“O.k. Professor, I’m going to sit you down.  Stop moving!” the voice chided.  </p><p>Severus felt two hands gently grasp his upper body, and, supporting his weight, turned his body.  Of course it had to be Granger, he groaned. </p><p> “Miss Granger,” he rasped, surprised he was able to talk at all around the saliva, mucus, and blood still filling his mouth, “Re-return to…a-at…once.”  </p><p>His voice began to flicker as it grew progressively weaker, and, to his utter mortification, he slid down the wall, coming to rest almost entirely on Hermione.  He could see her face clearly; forehead streaked with ink, hair loosely tamed by a red-and-gold bandanna, brown eyes brimming with tears.  </p><p>Beautiful, he thought, before catching himself, disgusted.  She is a student! You are old enough to be her father, he reminded himself.  </p><p>“Oh, Professor, you need to stop doing this to yourself,” whispered Hermione, staring into the coal-black eyes that rested on her lap. </p><p>Like the ocean, she thought, deep and beautiful and mysterious.  </p><p>God, how she wanted to run her hands through his hair, feel him shudder in relief, whisper at him until he cracked, until his lids bled oil, and he felt safe enough to shake with the feeling she watched him bury, daily, beneath smirks and insults.  She wanted to tell him it was okay to feel, that he deserved to feel; that, if he wanted, she would listen.  She wanted to remind him that touch could be comforting, not just painful; that words could help instead of breaking you to the point you wanted to shatter yourself, and no longer needed anyone to push you over the edge.  She wanted him to realize she noticed when he missed lessons and they were faced with a half-competent substitute teacher who could never truly express why ingredients were added in a particular order, or find beauty in a half-boiled shrivelfig, and that she charted those absences, crying into her pillow as she remembered Malfoy Manor, and imagining his pain.  </p><p>Hermione glanced once more at the tortured face, and, taking a deep breath, began to speak.  </p><p>“Professor, you don’t deserve this.  Having to face Him, sometimes twice a month, having to face V-Voldemort?  Because that’s where you go, isn’t it?  It’s not family, or business, or some potion-related excuse Professor Dumbledore has cooked up, it’s torture.  He does God knows what to you, and you are expected to take it, bravely, as if you needed to prove something, then somehow get back here, and teach the next day, covered from head to toe in glamours, which will make even the nicest person irritated, exhausted, and inexplicably angry.  You get picked on and ridiculed by my peers, who are too clueless to realize anything, and try to make your classes hell; they don’t even care enough to avoid explosions!  I can’t even imagine your duties as a staff member, not to mention the laborious amounts of grading I am sure the student population must generate.”  </p><p>Here she paused and took a breath.  </p><p>“You are selfless to a fault, brilliant,” she blushed, “and, without a doubt, the bravest man I know.  You deserve so much better,” she repeated, voice cracking.  </p><p>“I am so, so, sorry.”  Hermione Granger, the toughest witch of her year, who had faced so many of her prejudiced peers and teachers head on, who had campaigned for and tried to free an enslaved magical species while completing more coursework, ahead of time, than the founders themselves had ever undertaken, who had withstood torture and interrogation by the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange herself regarding some of the most sensitive information the Order possessed, began to cry, cradling the head of the bleeding Potions Master.  </p><p>“I am so, so, sorry,” she whispered over and over, gently brushing the black locks of hair off his face.</p><p>“Miss Granger!” said a surprised voice.  “What on earth are you doin- Severus?”  </p><p>Hermione whipped around and came face to face with none other than the Headmaster, himself.  </p><p>“P-p-Professor, he needs help, please, sir, I don’t know what to do for him, he is in tremendous pain!” Hermione said frantically, tears freely running down her face, blurring her vision. </p><p>“We need to get him to Madam Pomfrey! Quickly!” Dumbledore said worriedly, wordlessly levitating his body, and directing it down the hall.  </p><p>If Hermione would have looked down, one last time, she would have noticed a single tear tracing the creases of Severus Snape, the unshakable, terrifying Potion Master’s face.</p>
