<p> Sorry for sloppy work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ch.1 A new world</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A group of five were fighting a large fire creature known as <em>Mom-bomb</em>, headed by a man with purple hair, yellow clothes and a yellow sword tight in his hand.</p>
<p>This was the leader of the group, a <em>Paladin</em> or <em>Holy Knight</em> named Cecil Harvey.</p>
<p>Beside him, wearing white form fitting clothes that showed a modest amount of cleavage with a pair of heeled boots, was Rosa Joanna Farrell, a <em>White Wizard</em>. She was aiding her hurt friends and beloved by casting <em>Cure2</em> and <em>Heal</em> spells whenever she could.</p>
<p>Beside her, a young girl of fourteen with green hair and her own form fitting blue clothes and yellow sandals on bare feet had just used her inner power of <em>Call</em> to, well, call a beautiful and completely naked woman who had skin as blue as water but exuded an icy chill around her and her 12" cock stood at attention. She held a staff in her hand and pointed it at the monster, which was then covered in sheets of freezing wind.</p>
<p>The girl's name was Rydia and the thing she had called was named <em>Shiva</em>. "Thank you, <em>Shiva</em>." Rydia told her, curtsying in the skirt she wore.</p>
<p>"You are welcome, Rydia." <em>Shiva</em> bowed to her <em>Caller</em> before disappearing.</p>
<p>A man wearing orange karate gi with blue shoes was beside her and had braced himself for a mighty blow that they would all receive...this man's name was Yang and he was the <em>Grandmaster</em> of his kingdom.</p>
<p>"WATCH OUT! IT WILL EXPLODE!" Said the fifth member of the group, a timid <em>Prince</em> that also traveled as a <em>Bard</em>, his name was Edward and he immediately ran for cover while Rosa cast <em>Protect</em> on them all before bracing herself with them.</p>
<p><em>*BOOM!*</em> The <em>Mom-bomb</em> went off, thankfully no one had been hurt...</p>
<p>Suddenly everything went white and they disappeared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>In Mysidia...</em>
</p>
<p>A boy and his twin sister were bickering because the boy was a conceited-<em>I mean</em>-oh who am I kidding? Palom was the worst child in <em>Mysidia</em> and they all knew it but him, his sister, on the other hand, was the best apprentice the town ever had!</p>
<p>Palom studied <em>Black magic</em> while Porom studied <em>White</em>, they were fourteen years old and had mastered quite a few spells, each. Palom wore green clothes, orange shoes and an orange cloak while his twin wore orange clothes, orange shoes and a green cloak.</p>
<p>A white light suddenly enveloped them and they, too, disappeared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>In other locations...</em>
</p>
<p>A man clad in black armor, along with his five toughest servants, which included a <em>Dragoon</em>, disappeared, as did an <em>engineer</em>, his daughter, a middle-aged woman and another man, this one with long, white hair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>At this time in another universe...</em>
</p>
<p>A boy with untidy black hair, round wire frame glasses and a scar on his head in the shape of a bolt of lightning was in the middle of banging his head on the table as his best friend was trying to get him to stop.</p>
<p>This boy's name was Harry Potter and his name had come out of the Goblet of Fire, a magical artifact that binds a select few in a contract to compete in the <em>Tri-wizard</em> tournament.</p>
<p><em>"Harry, for fuck's sake! Stop it!"</em> Hearing this did get him to stop, only to stare at the bushy haired girl in shock.</p>
<p><em>Hermione never swore!</em> He thought, seeing her blush as her petite hand with red nail polish flew up to cover her mouth.</p>
<p>"Hermione Granger! I'm surprised at you!"<br/><br/>She flinched "Good thing you don't know my middle name is Jean...<em>dammit!</em>"</p>
<p>"Hermione Jean Granger, a beautiful name!" The boy said, honestly, earning another blush from his best friend.</p>
<p>"Thank you." She smiled. "I've always loved it."</p>
<p>"If it makes you feel any better, mine's James." Harry grinned, then gulped audibly when she adopted a look in her eyes unlike the twinkle in their Headmaster's but just as effective...it told him she would use this knowledge to her advantage in the future.</p>
<p><em>Shit, now I've done it.</em> He internally cursed.</p>
<p>"Harry, please exit to the side chamber with the other champions." Albus Dumbledore requested.</p>
<p>"Er, yes sir, sorry for the delay."</p>
<p>"Apology accepted." The aged man said without a smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before Harry could walk further than the podium, a flash of light brought a large group comprised of many adults and three teens Harry's age.</p>
<p>A man with purple hair stood up, causing Harry to draw his wand, along with the many other people while the door of the side chamber opened up to reveal the other three champions of the tournament.</p>
<p>"Who are you lot?" Harry asked, wary of the strangers.</p>
<p>"Please, we mean you no harm, I am Cecil Harvey of the kingdom of <em>Baron</em> and a few of these people with me are my friends, I do not know who some of them are, though."</p>
<p>"What's <em>Baron</em>? There's no such place in the world." Hermione asked.</p>
<p>"I see...we are not in our world anymore, it seems." A young woman dressed in white with large tits said, frowning.</p>
<p>"Inter-dimensional travel? I never knew that was possible." Harry said, lowering his wand, as he could see these people did not intend to do them harm.</p>
<p>"Clearly it is, boy." Another man said, he wore what Harry recognized as an engineering suit.</p>
<p>At the word <em>'boy'</em> Harry seized up in a flashback and flinched.</p>
<p>Noticing his reaction, yet another man dressed in orange walked up and knelt on one knee. "Are you alright, young one?"</p>
<p>Harry sighed, he did not want to get into it at the moment, especially with strangers. "Yes, I'm fine." He lied.</p>
<p>The man seemed to know Harry was lying but let it go, it was not his place to press. "I am Yang, Grandmaster of karate." Yang stood and bowed.</p>
<p>"I am Rosa, a <em>White wizard</em>, also of <em>Baron</em>, as is Cid, who is the master engineer for airships." She said, pointing to the one wearing the engineer clothes, who had a look of concern on his face.</p>
<p>"I'm Rydia! I'm a <em>Caller</em> from the village of Mist." A girl with green hair and blue clothes spoke up.</p>
<p>"I'm Palom, the greatest <em>Black wizard</em> in Mysidia!" A boy said, standing next to a near exact double of him.</p>
<p><em>*Rydia used ICE-1*</em> The boy yelped as a green circle surrounded the girl and a sheet of ice swept past him.</p>
<p>Harry snickered even as he wondered how she did it without a wand and what manner of <em>Ice</em> spell she used.</p>
<p>"Sorry about my twin brother, I am Porom, also a <em>White wizard</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>White wizard</em>? <em>Black wizard</em>? Do you mean light and dark and what's a <em>Caller</em>?" Hermione asked.</p>
<p>"No, miss, most <em>White magic</em> focuses on healing and defensive spells, all <em>Black magic</em> focuses on offensive and a <em>Caller</em> is someone who, well, calls creatures to us." Rydia explained.</p>
<p>"I see, my name's Hermione Granger, pleasure." She curtsied.</p>
<p>"I'm Harry Potter." Harry smiled, thankful that they didn't know who he was. "That <em>Ice</em> spell was like nothing I've ever seen before!"</p>
<p>Rydia blushed at this, suddenly ashamed of herself. "Sorry, I just don't like conceited people." She said, looking at the twin she had attacked.</p>
<p>"Hey, it isn't my f-<em>fffghghf</em>." Porom had chosen that moment to cover her brother's mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't piss off someone who can kick your ass with magic if I were you, dear brother, especially if she is a <em>Caller</em>!" She said, earning laughs from all, including Rydia, who blushed again. "Feel free to ignore him...better yet, threaten him with more magic, I am sure <em>Ice </em><em>level 1</em> is not the only <em>Black magic</em> spell you know."</p>
<p>"No, I also learned<em> LIT-1, FIRE-1</em> and <em>Venom.</em>" Rydia ticked off on her fingers and with each spell, Palom's eyes widened more and more.</p>
<p>He tried to say something through the hand still on him but it was muffled.</p>
<p>"He said he's sorry for what he said and won't do it, again." Porom said, removing her hand.</p>
<p>"You understood that?" Cecil asked.</p>
<p>"When you spend as much time plugging up his mouth and throat as I have, you learn to." She answered with a giggle as Palom glared.</p>
<p>"I guess that big mouth of yours always gets you in trouble." Cid chuckled.</p>
<p>The other strangers all introduced themselves and what they could do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Later, Cecil and Rosa were escorted to their new quarters after learning of a dangerous tournament for those seventeen years old but somehow Harry had been entered and he had not done it.</p>
<p>Of course they all believed the story right away, the fear was clearly on his face.</p>
<p>They promised they would do anything they could to help him and Harry had sighed in relief.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The morning of the next day proved to them that they had, indeed, been transported to a new world...</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A/N:</strong>I got the name <strong><em>Shifting fantasy</em></strong> from my girlfriend but the last part was my addition.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed the chapter and I'll start chapter 2 when I think about how to.</p>
<p>This will go along the lines of my very first fic, <em><strong>Lord's challenges</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I know Cecil wasn't a <em>Paladin</em> at that point, but I never really liked him that much as a <em>Dark Knight</em>.</p>
<p>I also know Rydia didn't learn the more advanced <em>Calls</em> until she became an adult, I just wanted her to know them all early on.</p>
<p>I also also know that no <em>Calls/Summons</em> or any of the numerous things they're called were naked in any of the games but I wanted to change that for most of them(<em>Ramuh/Indra</em> will not get naked.)</p>
<p>And finally, I know Rydia and the twins are way younger than they are here, I just needed them aged up for this.</p>
