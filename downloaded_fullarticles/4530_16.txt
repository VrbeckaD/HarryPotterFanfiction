    <p>
  <span>A woman carefully maneuvered through the dark underbrush of the forest with slow, deliberate steps. Every few minutes, she would stop and glance behind her, listening intently for something, but when she didn’t hear anything, she would continue on her journey. The woman stayed in the shadows, never stepping into the light even though the only source of light was from the pale moon above.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, there was a loud screech from the treetops, and a bird flew away with a loud flutter of wings. The woman gasped quietly in shock before stepping deeper into the shadows in an attempt to hide. The forest was eerily silent. No birds were chirping. No animals were rustling about in the undergrowth. There wasn’t even a wind blowing through the leaves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a few minutes of this absolute silence, the woman stepped out into the moonlight for the first time that night in order to check if the coast was clear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman glanced around the forest with wide, fearful green eyes. Her skin was extremely pale, almost to the point that she looked ill, contrasting greatly with the large smudges of dirt on her arms and face. Her hair hung around her face in a mess of wild curls and tangles. She wrapped her plain black cloak tighter around herself, concealing a once priceless but now torn and stained emerald dress beneath it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should not be here, milady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman jumped and spun around to face the person who scared her. An old woman stood behind her, a brown cloak hanging from her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, I need help,” she begged the old woman. “I have nowhere else to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The old woman looked at her impassively. “I’m sorry, but we cannot help you. It is too dangerous for us to harbour you. If the king found you with usー”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He would kill us all,” the younger woman said, cutting the other off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” The old woman snarled. “He would not! He would kill my entire clan, but you would go back to your life of luxury in the castle, Lady Morgana.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not if he knew I was with child.” Morgana said quietly as she pulled her cloak back to reveal her large, protruding stomach.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The old woman froze before shaking her head. “Everyone knows the king favors you. Even if he knew you were with child out of wedlock, he would allow you and the baby to live.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana’s face hardened. “Not when he realizes the child has magic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The old woman’s eyes widened. She looked at the younger woman appraisingly before stepping aside. “Come. Follow me. I’ll take you to our camp.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana smiled in relief. “Thank you! You have no idea how much I appreciate this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not doing this for you, milady.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana’s face fell. “Why are you doing this then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have the ability to protect yourself, unlike your child. The baby is innocent and shouldn’t be harmed because of something it can’t help. How long have you been pregnant?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Eight months. The baby should be due in a month or so. I wanted to come to you early in case you refused to help me so I would still have enough time to find other druids who might be willing to aid me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The old woman nodded sagely. “Smart plan. But may I ask how you’ve been hiding your pregnancy in the castle? You have only been missing for a month. You must have been showing long before that. How were you able to hide it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana nervously fiddled with her cloak, hiding her stomach more out of habit than necessity. “At first I was able to hide it by claiming the feasts were finally beginning to affect my figure, but by the fourth month I had to resort to concealing spells and loose, flowing dresses.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, the forest opened up into a large clearing full of tents. Morgana glanced around the clearing with thinly veiled awe, having never seen anything remotely like it before. The tents were almost in the formation of a small village, small alleyways, and roads dividing the tents. Small, sparkling orbs of light and brightly colored lanterns lit the way between the streets. Joyful laughter caught the lady’s attention causing her to turn towards the sound. A group of children was running around the camp playing hide and seek. Morgana’s lips formed a soft smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come along, milady. I’ll take you to my tent. We will have the privacy to speak freely there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana nodded and hurriedly followed the old woman through the streets to one of the tents in the middle of the clearing. “Are you one of the leaders here?” She asked hesitantly as she ducked into the tent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The old woman blinked in surprise. “I’m sorry; I haven’t told you anything about myself, have I? My name is Yseult, and yes, I am the leader of this community.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult motioned for her to sit on the small cot. Morgana carefully sat down on the cot, trying to find the most elegant and comfortable way to sit with her large stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So why have you come to us druids for help, milady?” Yseult asked as she pulled up a chair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana lifted her head high, trying to seem strong, but a glance to her tightly clenched hands told Yseult that the girl was extremely nervous. “I need somebody to help with the delivery when the time comes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult cocked an eyebrow at her. “Is that all? Why not go to some midwife in town? Why come to us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The child has magic; I couldn’t risk a midwife finding out and telling Uther about us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Forgive me, milady, but how do you even know the child </span>
  <em>
    <span>has </span>
  </em>
  <span>magic? The baby hasn’t even left the womb yet. Even if it does have magic, it shouldn’t be manifesting yet,” Yseult said incredulously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana glared. “My child has magic; I can </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel </span>
  </em>
  <span>it! I can feel it pulsing against my own and changing with every flicker of the baby’s emotions!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult nodded carefully. “I’m sorry if I’ve offended you, but you have to understand, I had to know. A child having magic when it is first born is extremely rare, but a child having magic in the womb? Unheard of.”   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana relaxed a little at the woman’s words before sighing. “ I also have another reason for coming here.” Yseult cocked her eyebrow at the girl but didn’t say anything. Morgana continued hesitantly. “About a month ago, I was一” Morgana struggled to force the word out, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>poisoned</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I was given the antidote in time to save my life, but I need to know if my baby will have any adverse reactions because of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Poisoned</span>
  </em>
  <span>?!” Yseult exclaimed in shock. “What kind of poison was it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um, hemlock,” Morgana said before continuing quietly, “My sister said it was hemlock.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult paled when she heard the type of poison, accidentally missing the sentence that followed it. “I’m going to get a healer to check on the baby. I’ll be right back.” With that, she turned and practically ran out of the tent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana awkwardly sat on the bed for a few minutes before Yseult scurried back into the tent followed by a gentle looking man with salt and pepper hair. Immediately, the man began to examine her as he introduced himself. “Good evening, Lady Morgana. My name is David; I’m the physician here.” The man motioned to Yseult standing behind him. “Yseult told me you were poisoned during your pregnancy. Do you mind telling me how long ago that was?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “About a month or so. I would have been around seven months pregnant then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The physician began to examine her pupils to see if they were larger than normal before grabbing her hand and staring hard at her cuticles. “How long did you go without the antidote?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Umm..” Morgana paused, “ Maybe three of four minutes? I’m not really sure. It felt like an eternity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I?” David asked, gesturing to her stomach. Morgana nodded before hesitantly pulling her cloak back to reveal her stomach. David carefully began to feel her stomach. “Has he been very active since then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that moment, the baby gave a sharp kick. The physician chuckled. “I guess that answers that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana giggled quietly. “Yeah, he’s a kicker.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shrugged. “I’ve always thought of him as a he. That’s not odd is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not. But just know the baby might not be a boy. It could be a girl.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And it could very well be a boy,” Morgana said stubbornly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>David looked as if he was going to start arguing with her before Yseult silenced him with a look. “A mother knows, David.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The physician huffed, but continued his examination. After a few minutes, the man hummed quietly. “As far as I can tell the baby is healthy. You, on the other hand, are not. You’re running a dangerously high temperature, you look like you aren’t sleeping and haven’t eaten well in several months.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana looked at the man worriedly. “What...what happens if I can’t fix it? I’m not exactly in the best of positions to stay healthy these days. With all the stress and...my sister...” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult looked sharply at the young witch but didn’t say anything. Instead, it was David who spoke. “If your health continues to decline, you may lose the baby.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana paled drastically. “What? No! I can’t lose the baby because of this! I can’t- I can’t fix this! This is something I can’t change!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>David’s eyes widen at her sudden outburst. “Milady, you need to calm down! Please, take deep breaths, calm your heart rate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Calm down? Calm down!” Morgana began to hyperventilate. “You just told me I could lose my </span>
  <em>
    <span>child</span>
  </em>
  <span>! You cannot expect me to </span>
  <em>
    <span>calm down</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly she gasped and bent over, clutching at her stomach. “Milady?!” Yseult and David cried rushing to her side. “Milady, what’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think,” Morgana began faintly still clutching her stomach, “I think my water just broke.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>David’s eyes widen before turning to Yseult and ordering her to get his supplies. He turned back to Morgana and gently pushed her down onto the bed. “I need you to lie down, Lady Morgana. Are you in any pain? Does anything feel wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana seemed to be in shock, though. “I can’t be having the baby now. It’s too early.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Milady,” David exclaimed before growling frustratedly, “Lady Morgana!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana snapped back to reality. The physician continued now that he had her attention. “Now, do exactly what I say. If we do this right, both you and the child will completely fine, but only if you </span>
  <em>
    <span>listen to me</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana nodded determinedly and a fire entered her eyes. “I’ll do what you ask.” Her eyes narrowed. “But know this, if </span>
  <em>
    <span>any </span>
  </em>
  <span>harm comes to my child, I will make you </span>
  <em>
    <span>beg</span>
  </em>
  <span> for death. I will tear you apart limb from limb if so much as a hair on my baby’s head is hurt!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>David nodded somewhat cautiously before cocking an eyebrow at her. “Now if you’re finished, I believe we have a baby to deliver.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>After a long and gruelling four hour labor, a beautiful baby boy was born to Morgana Le Fay. The physician gently wrapped the little boy in a soft blanket before handing him to his mother. “I guess you were right,” David said with a smile, “It was a boy after all.”</p><p>
  <span>Morgana smiled a proud, exhausted smile. “I told you he was a boy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you going to name him?” Yseult asked quietly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A far off look entered the witch’s eyes. “Hadrian,” she eventually said, “Hadrian Myrddin Le Fay. That shall be his name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you mind me asking the origin of his name, milady?” Yseult asked curiously. She had never heard of the name Hadrian nor Myrddin before. It was also odd that the lady was giving her last name to the boy instead of giving him his father’s name. “Are they from a different language?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana nodded, never taking her eyes off her son. “Yes, Hadrian is Swedish, Myrddin is Welsh, and Le Fay, of course, is our own language. Myrddin is after his father and Le Fay after me. This way he is connected to his father and me while still having his own name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The little boy in her arms yawned suddenly, causing Morgana to coo at the sight. His eyelids scrunched together before blinking open to reveal large, startling emerald eyes. “He has my eyes!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the sound of her voice, Hadrian smiled brightly up at her. “And his father’s smile,” She said in a more subdued, sad voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult motioned for David to leave the tent. “We’ll leave you two alone for a bit,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? No,” Morgana said looking up, startled. She looked back down at the boy before forcing out, “I still need to talk to you about something.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The physician paused by the tent flap, but Yseult shooed him away. “Now, what is it you wanted to speak to me about, milady.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana looked down at her child, not knowing where to start. “I… I was hoping your camp would be willing to take him in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult straightened immediately. “Are you saying what I think you’re saying?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He can’t stay with me; it’s too dangerous!” Morgana cried desperately, “If Uther finds Hadrian, he </span>
  <em>
    <span>will</span>
  </em>
  <span> kill the boy. And as much as I love my sister, I don’t think she would have my child’s best interests at heart. She would use him to fight against the king. I can’t allow her to endanger my son.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about the boy’s father?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s the one who poisoned me,” The older woman gasped, but Morgana ignored her and continued speaking. “And I will </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> leave my child in his hands. Not with Hadrian’s life at stake. He has already proven himself to be a </span>
  <em>
    <span>traitor</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult seemed at a loss as to what to say. Eventually, she asked, “If the father tried to kill you and Hadrian, why did you name the boy after him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because he has一</span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> a good heart. He was a good man, always standing up for what was right. And I’m hoping Hadrian will turn out a little like him in those regards, only I hope Hadrian will stick to his morals better than his father did in the end,” Morgana gave a watery laugh, “Or maybe I’m holding onto some foolish hope that he actually loved me! That he would welcome Hadrian and me back with open arms if I showed up out of the blue. That there was a reason for him trying to kill me, other than hatred.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana snorted softly and rubbed her eyes harshly. “Either way, I want Hadrian to at least have a little piece of his father even if it is in name only.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult looked at the mother and son before sighing. “If you think it is best to leave the child here, we will take the child. I know a couple who have been trying to have a child; they would gladly take him in. But are you sure about this? You would leave your child to live with strangers?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It wouldn’t be all bad,” Morgana claimed. “ Hadrian would grow up in a loving, peaceful community. He would be far enough away from Camelot to be safe from the king. He would grow up knowing he is safe and loved.” She sniffed quietly. “And it wouldn’t be like I was abandoning him. I would come and visit when I knew it was safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   Yseult nodded sadly. She had had a feeling that Morgana would not be deterred from her decision. “You should stay for the night, Lady Morgana. Take some time to recover. Spend some time with your boy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana shook her head sadly. “I have to go. I never meant to spend the full night. Morgause will notice if I’m missing for so long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She very carefully stood up on shaking legs. Yseult hurried to her side to help support her. “Milady, I really must insist! You’re too weak to make it to wherever you’re going! You can barely stand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana seemed to straighten and stand through willpower alone. She gently handed Hadrian over to the old druid. “I will be fine, but, please, look after Hadrian while I’m away. I’ll try to come by in a month or so to see him, but I’ll only come if I know it’s safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult handed her the baby back. “At least take the time to say your goodbyes. After all, you don’t know when you’ll come back. I’ll be outside when you’re ready to make your departure.” With that, the old woman turned and strode out of the tent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hadrian stirred in her arms, sensing the slight tension in the air. His eyes began to water and tiny little sniffles disturbed the quiet. Morgana began to rock him gently in her arms. “Oh, don’t cry, Hadrian! If there was any other choice I’d….” Morgana trailed off before shaking her head. “This is the only way I can ensure your safety, darling. In fact...” Morgana quickly unclasped the necklace around her neck and clasped it around Hadrian’s neck. It was a simple necklace with a plain silver chain and a symbol of the Triple Goddess dangling from the middle. Her sister had given it to her after placing all the protective spells she knew on it because of the little….incident with Merlin. Morgana placed her hand on the necklace and channeled her magic into the small charm, strengthening the protection spells to their capacity. Hadrian giggled quietly when his mother’s eyes flashed a bright, pure gold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There! Now I’ll know you’ll always be protected! Even when I’m not around to protect you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child’s sniffles returned with a vengeance with those words and increased until Hadrian was crying. Morgana held him close and began to sing the only lullaby she knew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hush now, my baby. Be still, love, don’t cry. Sleep as your dreams set you free. Sleep and remember, my last lullaby, so I’ll be with you in your dreams.” Hadrian seemed to be slowly calming down so she continued, “Darling, you’re safe here and safe may you stay for I have a dream just for you. Grow little baby. I’ll be back someday. I’ll come back for you….”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana smiled when she saw Hadrian drift to sleep. She kissed his head gently, ignoring the wetness in her eyes, before exiting the tent. She gently handed Hadrian over to Yseult. “I really must go now.” She looked up at the old druid pleadingly, “Make sure he always, </span>
  <em>
    <span>always, </span>
  </em>
  <span>wears this necklace. Never let him take it off. A High Priestess of the Old Religion has cast protection spells on it, so it should keep him safe, but only if he </span>
  <em>
    <span>wears it</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What if somebody takes it from him,” Yseult asked worriedly. Although she loved her fellow druids dearly, she knew there were a few who would be willing to steal from a child if it meant protection from the king.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Morgana shook her head. “It’s charmed so that nobody can take it from him, but he can willing take it off if he wants.” Morgana sent Yseult a small glare. “Just make sure he never takes it off. He won’t be protected if he does.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yseult nodded determinedly. She would not let the small child in her arms be hurt even if the king himself tried to kill the boy. Morgana smiled sadly before turning on her heel and leaving the small camp. She paused when she got to the forest line and looked back before looking up at the stars.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, Triple Goddess, protect my child. Protect my Hadrian.” Morgana wiped a single tear from her cheek and fled into the darkness of the forest. </span>
