    <p>A.N Major Spoilers for the new Fantastic Beasts Film, do not read if you don't want to know what happens in the film</p><p>Harry rolled out the way of a curse waving his wand and sealing the door as Hermione's spell shut it. They cast the spell simultaneously that would strengthen the door. Turning they raced after the limping figure that was making his way as quickly as he could to the room that they needed, all of them ignoring the thundering boom that echoed around them as the assault began on the door already.</p><p>They sealed the next set of doors in much the same way, and the next, and the next. Anything to give them the time that they needed, anything to give them just those extra few minutes, ignoring the exhausted ache in their limbs, ignoring the pain of their wounds and tug on their magic that told them they were close to depleting themselves.</p><p>Finally, they staggered into the last room and sealed the doors, before turning to see Dumbledore standing casting the spell already, the words tumbling rapidly from his lips, his magic weaving together in a dancing show of lights.</p><p>They could hear the sounds of fighting coming from where they had just come from, they could hear the booms and explosions of the Death Eaters trying to take down their wards and get to them. The Order were doing their job and holding the Death Eaters off for as long as they could.</p><p>They would be dying.</p><p>They knew though when they started this mission over an hour ago, every single one of them had known. It was a suicide mission.</p><p>This was their last, mad chance, their last hope. The last hope of the Wizarding World.</p><p>They had been fighting a battle they hadn't realised they had been fighting. Grindelwald had been playing Voldemort as his puppet from prison and by the time they realised it, it was too late. Grindelwald was free right after Harry had killed Voldemort, and he had taken up the Death Eater forces for himself.</p><p>They had been revealed to the Muggle world within a matter of days. And war had started, a new witch hunt, only more deadly. Bombs had been dropped, guns had been tested against magic. It was apocalyptic.</p><p>They were going to wipe each other out.</p><p>The Order had been torn between defending the Wizarding World in Britain and trying to defeat Grindelwald's forces who were just making everything worse by egging on the muggles despite the fact that it was rapidly becoming apparent that they could not beat them, not with the new development in muggle technology.</p><p>MACUSA had been wiped out with an atom bomb.</p><p>They were all losing hope.</p><p>And then had come the plan. One last stupid, desperate, foolish plan. A plan that was likely never going to work. But it was all that they had.</p><p>And so they had stormed Hogwarts. Every single member of the Order had shown up for this last fight despite knowing that they would not return from it.</p><p>And the plan was simple. Harry, Hermione, and Dumbledore had to get through to this specific room, the rooms that had been Dumbledore's when he was a teacher at Hogwarts in 1927. And here, they would cast the spell.</p><p>The spell that would send Harry and Hermione back in time, back to 1927. It was an ancient and archaic spell, a spell that in knowledge had only been used twice. It had killed the castor once. The other time, well they had no way to know what had happened.</p><p>But they had to do something.</p><p>Dumbledore gasped and staggered back as the spell was completed and a shimmering, white light flickered in place, roughly the size of a narrow doorway a foot in the air. Dumbledore looked worse for wear, he was bleeding heavily from a head wound, one arm was hanging awkwardly and he looked drained. But his eyes were steady and determined as he turned to look at them.</p><p>"Are you ready?" He asked.</p><p>"Ready," Harry nodded adjusting his bag a little higher onto his shoulders.</p><p>"Ready," Hermione nodded hefting her own bag higher and faced the spell door.</p><p>"Right, wear this, show it to my younger self, it should go to helping him believe you," Dumbledore undid a chain from around his neck and fastened it around Harry's with a small grimace of pain.</p><p>"Ok, and we need to gather together Newt Scamander, Tina Goldstein, Queenie Goldstein and the muggle Jacob Kowalski, and the man who knows himself as Credence Barebone," Harry nodded.</p><p>"Harry…." Dumbledore captured his arm. "I wanted to apologise. I made mistakes, mistakes that have caused you great hurt and sorrow, and if you manage to change everything so far, that will not have changed for you, the you are now. I just wanted you to know, I am sorry,"</p><p>Harry stared at the man a little stunned. Things had been tense between the two of them over the last few years, he had not truly expected to ever receive this apology from the Headmaster.</p><p>"Thank you, Sir," Harry nodded.</p><p>There was a boom right outside the door and the three of them shared a panicked look. Dumbledore turned to the door and raised his wand muttering more charms to seal the door as Hermione and Harry turned and added their own spells to the doorway to allow them to pass through.</p><p>Just as they finished the spell the door cracked threateningly, a deep groove forming in it.</p><p>"Remember, once you are there and start changing things, history will no longer be as you remember it, you will have set a new path so you can't rely on it following the same patterns that it did the first time around. You are going to have to work hard and fight hard to win this war the first time around," Dumbledore shouted."Now is the time to go!"</p><p>"We're ready!"</p><p>"Then go! And good luck!" Dumbledore shouted cheerfully making Harry and Hermione snort as they turned to face the doorway.</p><p>Meeting each other's eyes they nodded and clasped hands tightly, each taking a deep breath as they faced the doorway. One more breath and they took a step back before racing for the doorway, gaining as much speed as they possibly could in the short space they had, and throwing themselves through the doorway. Everything going black as soon as they passed through the doorway.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Albus and Minerva were sitting having a nice cup of tea as they discussed their students, and pointedly ignored the topic of Grindelwald.</p><p>Albus appreciated Minerva's friendship and steady companionship. Both of their inclinations lay elsewhere, and both had had their hearts broken by another, both of them determined not to allow their hearts to be broken again.</p><p>Grindelwald and Rosier had played the both of them like a fiddle.</p><p>Albus went to take another sip of tea only to start dramatically when there was a flash of white light which turned into something like a narrow doorway floating around a foot off of the ground. He and Minerva had barely had time to get to their feet when two people flew through the light had in hand as though they had been summoned and landed with dull thumps on the floor. The moment they were through, the light flashed brightly before disappearing, leaving no visible trace of it ever having existed.</p><p>"Erm….if this is an attack, it is a poor one. I believe they are unconscious," Minerva stated with her dry wit even as she pointed her wand at the two of them.</p><p>They had both landed on their fronts, both spawled in an ungainly and slightly painful looking position.</p><p>They were male and female, that was obvious from a quick glance. The female had long bushy chestnut brown hair that had been battled into a high ponytail, the male had raven black hair that lay to his shoulder and was pulled back in a low ponytail.</p><p>Both were muscled and well built if looking a little on the thin side in an unnatural way. They were both also wearing dragonhide trousers and battle robes, designed specifically not to get in the way while dueling. They also had large backpacks on.</p><p>Albus and Minerva exchanged a glance before they stepped forward, and levitated one of the intruders each, flipping them over once they were far enough off the ground. What they saw made them both draw in a deep breath. Both the intruders were injured in various ways, curse marks, cuts, bruises, the female had a nasty burn on her arm, the male had what looked like ligature marks around his had obviously been through hell to get here.</p><p>Albus quickly started casting diagnostic spells on the two of them as fast as he could while Minerva stood guard, just in case, quickly transfiguring two stretchers like beds underneath them. He hissed out a breath between his teeth as he took in the damage that the two unconscious intruders had sustained. Someone had seriously been trying to kill them, not to mention their magic was nearly completely depleted, not an easy feat for any witch or wizard.</p><p>"We should...Albus?" Minerva asked confused as Albus suddenly dodged towards the male, ignoring the safe distance they had been keeping, and dug something out from under his top. She leaned forward for a better look before drawing in a deep breath. "Is that…?"</p><p>"It is impossible! I have it, right here!" Albus shook his head reaching under the collar of his shirt and holding up an identical locket. With a confused shake of his head, he quickly opened the locket around the man's neck and stared down completely confused at the lock of hair sitting safely inside the locket that he knew intimately.</p><p>"What is going on? I do not understand? No one but you and I know about the locket, correct?" Minerva asked.</p><p>"Correct, Aberforth knows I have it, but he does not know I keep it so close, and he would not betray her memory by telling anyone about our sister's locket, no matter how much he hates me,"</p><p>"This is strange," Minerva frowned confusedly after casting a spell on both lockets. "The spell says that it is the same locket, but the one that he is wearing is older,"</p><p>"Who are they?!" Albus frowned looking at the two of them.</p><p>"I truly have no idea. We are not informing the Ministry about them are we," Minerva stated rather than asked.</p><p>"Of course not, Theseus is wrapped up with things right now and I do not trust any of the other morons there," Albus said cheerfully.</p><p>"Come on then, let's make them comfortable and heal what we can," Minerva rolled her eyes, but she still moved towards the female and started casting to heal the damage she could find after setting the backpack to the side. The two of them would have been tempted to search through the packs, but the spells upon them would take hours for them to crack.</p><p>Albus moved to start healing the man, no older than 24 looking at his young features, but even unconscious and with his eyes tightly closed Albus could tell he had been through a lot. Tiredness and weariness were clear upon his face. He had seen and done too much. That was clear.</p><p>His skin seemed naturally pale, though it was sallow now, at least what he could see through the blood, bruises, smoke and burns.</p><p>He summoned a burn paste and quickly but carefully started applying it the burns that he could see, frowning at the sheer amount of them. He was nearly done when the young man sucked in a deep, gasping breath of air as the greenest eyes Albus had ever seen snapped open and looked frantically around the room. His hand reached out and caught Albus' wrist where it was extended to put more paste on his cheek, his fingers gripping surprisingly tightly considering he had been out for the count not that long ago.</p><p>"Mio...ne?" He rasped out before grimacing. Albus one handedly summoned a glass of water and held it to the man's lips, helping him drink as he gulped down the water desperately.</p><p>"What did you say?" Albus asked gently once the glass was empty.</p><p>"Mione? Where is she?" The stranger sounded a little better this time, enough to understand him.</p><p>"Mione? The woman you were with? She is right there," Albus motioned and the man twisted, grimacing in pain but relaxed when his eyes fell on the young woman.</p><p>"Professor McGonagall?" The man asked sounding a little baffled.</p><p>"Erm, yes that is me, Minerva McGonagall," Minerva answered unsurely still hovering over the woman, Mione, healing her.</p><p>"Huh," The man nodded and dropped down onto the stretcher with a pained groan.</p><p>"Do you think you have any internal injuries?" Albus asked concerned leaning over the man. He wanted to ask about the locket, but he focussed on how hurt this man was right now, his green eyes were squinting in pain, and he was still gripping tightly onto Albus' wrist as though he didn't realise he was doing it. However, as Albus leaned over him he squinted up at him, tilting his head as though to look at him better.</p><p>"Dumbledore?" He finally asked slowly, unsurely.</p><p>"Yes that is me, Albus Dumbledore," Albus nodded. "Do we know you?"</p><p>"Not yet," the man snorted.</p><p>"Pardon?" Albus asked feeling completely lost now.</p><p>"We're here to help. We need….Newt Scamander, Tina and Queenie Goldstein, Ja...Jacob Kowalski and...Cre….Credence...here...need them here…." The man mumbled, clearly losing his grip on consciousness again.</p><p>"Ok, are you hurt internally?" Albus pressed.</p><p>"You need to get them here!" The man managed to pull himself back, tugging Albus closer.</p><p>"I will, but I need to know…"</p><p>"M fine…" The man grumbled.</p><p>"Of course you are, that is why you look like you have gone ten rounds with the giant squid. Alright, can I at least get a name?" Albus huffed.</p><p>"You're...sassier," The man snorted amused, actually managing a painful sounding laugh when Albus looked at him affronted. "Harry, 'm Harry,"</p><p>"Harry," Albus said the name with a small nod.</p><p>"You'll...call them?"</p><p>"Yes of course," Albus smiled. He started badly when with an amazing feat of strength the man, Harry, seemed to manage to yank himself back into consciousness and heaved himself into a sitting position, even though it was obviously incredibly painful for him.</p><p>Albus found both his wrists captured this time and as he tried to cast a wandless stunning spell it bounced off of a wandless shielding spell the man, Harry, managed to cast despite how little magic he had.</p><p>"You need...to listen! We are here to help...if something is not done soon...things….will get really bad. Really….really bad...things will be set...into motion...everything is at stake. I….will explain properly...but you need to….swear to me, please," Harry grit out, his green eyes intense as they looked at Albus.</p><p>"I...this could be a trick, you could be getting me to bring them here to hurt them," Albus explained softly. "I can't risk my friend and the people he cares about without something more to go on. There is a war taking place, would you risk her, Mione, with someone you don't know, who raises more questions than anything else?"</p><p>"No…" Harry admitted dropping suddenly backward before he caught himself and heaved his weakened body upright again.</p><p>"Look, get some sleep, rest, heal and when you wake we can discuss things, and if I am happy, I will call them here," Albus tried pressing Harry back to lie down, and thought he had won when Harry was horizontal again and had closed his eyes. However, when he tried to remove his wrists from Harry's grip the pressure tightened and green eyes snapped open.</p><p>"I'm sorry about this, but there isn't time," Harry said. He closed his eyes and sucked in a deep breath, and Albus gasped as memories were suddenly smashed through his Occulamency barriers and exploded across his mind.</p><p>Wars. Cities and towns burning, the Ministry invaded and taken over….the fountain representing the suppression of muggles and muggle-borns. Children dead, Hogwarts on fire...burned...destroyed...Muggles murdered and displayed as trophies for all to see. Buildings collapsed, bridges destroyed. So many lives lost…...the war lost….one last hope, one last chance….Harry and Hermione had to get back….</p><p>Albus sucked in a deep breath and staggered backward as Harry's grip on his wrists released when the young man passed out from magical exhaustion.</p><p>"Albus!" Minerva hurried to his side helping to ease him into a chair. She pressed her hands to his shoulders and peered at him with open concern as she watched him rubbing his temples to try and push away the migraine fighting to make itself known, instead trying to focus and remember what he had seen in the flashes that Harry had been able to shove into his head.</p><p>"I don't understand what he showed me," Albus frowned.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Minerva asked, summoning a cup of tea for him and pressing it into his cold and trembling hands.</p><p>"What he showed me….it was the future, a terrible future! But...he is not a seer, it was not a possible future, it was not as a seer perceives the possibilities of the future," Albus rambled going back to rubbing his temple one-handedly. Grindelwald had shared with him the visions he had, he had shown Albus some of them, shared them with him. They always had a slight fogging around the edges that spoke of things that had not happened yet.</p><p>There was something so real about it like it was a memory.</p><p>"I think...this is going to sound utterly mad and you will be booking me into St Mungo's," Albus huffed.</p><p>"Go on," Minerva pressed.</p><p>"I think they're from the future," Albus uttered the words and felt a little foolish for saying it. When he glanced at his friend, however, she was looking pensive.</p><p>"It would explain the locket," She shrugged.</p><p>"The things he showed me, Minerva...Hogwarts was completely destroyed," Albus rubbed at his temples again.</p><p>"I think...ask them to come here Albus, as he asked. I will carry on working on them while you call," Minerva said firmly standing and making her way to Harry and starting to carry on healing where Albus had left off.</p><p>Albus stared at him where he was lying unconscious for a few more moments before he made his way to the fireplace and started making the fire calls to summon the others to the castle, wondering how to phrase it without them thinking he had finally lost it.</p><p>Once he had an agreement that they would come to Hogwarts asap, he took a step back and moved back to Harry's side, allowing Minerva to carry on her work with Mione.</p><p>It took nearly an hour for the two of them to finish healing the two possible time travelers as best they could. Finally, they both stepped back, feeling a little exhausted themselves as they looked at the two sleeping steadily on the stretcher.</p><p>"Well, they have been through a lot," Minerva stated sitting down in the armchair she had vacated upon the appearance of the two of them.</p><p>"That is an understatement," Albus snorted.</p><p>They sat in silence sipping from their cups of tea for a good five minutes before Minerva interrupted the silence. "So, from the future huh?"</p><p>"Future," Albus nodded.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
"Harry!?" Mione sat up with a gasp startling Albus and Minerva. The two of them had been sleeping for nearly three hours now, the two of them had pottered around and had ended up sitting marking their papers together while they waited for the two of them to wake up.</p><p>"Hello, it's ok, take it easy," Minerva and Albus hurried over to her.</p><p>"Harry is right there," Albus motioned to her other side, and with wide brown eyes, she craned around to see him, relaxing once she could see he was ok.</p><p>"What….happened?" Mione blinked at them as she lay back down with a groan.</p><p>Minerva grabbed a glass of water and transfigured a straw, easing it into Mione's mouth. She gulped down four glasses of water before she finally placed her head back onto the pillow.</p><p>"Is he ok?" She asked turning to look at him again.</p><p>"He is fine, he woke up for a little while but tired himself out. You have been asleep for around 3 and a half hours, he 3," Albus explained.</p><p>"Did he tell you anything?" Mione asked.</p><p>"He gave us your names, Mione and Harry and…." Minerva drew off when Mione snorted.</p><p>"My name is Hermione, only he calls me Mione," She explained with a faint smile.</p><p>"Oh right, Hermione then," Minerva smiled slightly.</p><p>"He also said that I needed to bring some people here," Albus said softly.</p><p>"Newt, Tina, Queenie, Jacob and Credence," Hermione listed.</p><p>"Yes," Albus nodded.</p><p>"Have you called them?" Hermione started trying to sit up again.</p><p>"Yes, I have, Harry….convinced me," Albus grimaced at the memory of Hogwarts in flames.</p><p>"What did he do?" Hermione squinted at him.</p><p>"He clearly thought that I was not taking him seriously, he showed me some things that convinced me it was worth taking the risk," Albus said tactfully.</p><p>"Showed...Oh, come on Harry!" Hermione groaned dropping her head back with a thump.</p><p>"Five more minutes Mione…." Harry grumbled from his stretcher.</p><p>"What did he show you?" Hermione asked.</p><p>"Hogwarts burning, children dead, muggles and muggle-borns dead, cities and villages on fire and full of the dead...the future," Albus tried.</p><p>"Always jumping the bloody gun," Hermione grunted forcing herself into a sitting position. She placed her hand on the stretcher to steady herself before she looked around the rooms. "At least we made it," she sighed.</p><p>"So you are from the future?" Minerva asked.</p><p>"Yes, we are," Hermione settled herself and looked intently at the two of them.</p><p>"Right... a bit of whiskey in your tea Minerva?" Albus coughed making his way to his drinks cabinet.</p><p>"Just a tad...tad more...tad more...that's it thank you," Minerva smiled before gulping back her tea. "Ah that hit the spot,"</p><p>"Quite so," Albus gasped placing the bottle back down. "So, the future?"</p><p>"You're taking this well," Hermione said dryly.</p><p>"Oh, we have visitors from the future every other Wednesday," Minerva waved her off.</p><p>"Point," Hermione snorted. "Look, I get this is big and scary and probably quite confusing. The spell we used...is a spell that was chosen in pure desperation. It was a completely stupid plan that had 99% chance of failing, but...we had lost desperately was all we had left. And for whatever reason, it actually worked we're here,"</p><p>"And what are you hoping to achieve here? You obviously came to this specific point in time," Albus asked.</p><p>"To you specifically actually," Hermione shrugged. "In our timeline, you defeat Grindelwald and he is imprisoned in Numergard as a sort of ironic punishment. However, he had provisions put in place for something like that happening, though I think mainly he was prepared for a siege and not actual imprisonment, either way, he was able to keep working from prison. Eventually, his followers found a young wizard, at 17 he was already a murderer and well on his way to becoming something...horrendous. Grindelwald took that and helped him, helped him become who he was destined to be quicker. And as the Heir of Slytherin, this young wizard managed to pull to him many followers, who thought that muggle blood did not belong in the wizarding world, who wanted to wipe out 'mudbloods' completely.</p><p>We thought we had won, Harry defeated the dark wizard and we thought that was it. And then the overall plan was revealed, Grindelwald broke out, and took up the place he had been crafting for himself for decades. And they wiped us off of a board that we hadn't even realised that we were playing on," Hermione sighed.</p><p>"The things he showed me, that's what happened?" Albus asked shakily.</p><p>"Yes," Hermione nodded.</p><p>"All those children? Hogwarts? Everything?"</p><p>"I am sorry, yes. This was our last chance. Come back try and change the track of things, just enough to stop things happening. And hopefully adding us to the mix with be enough to change things,"</p><p>"But, if you know what will happen, it should be easy to do right?" Minerva frowned.</p><p>"No, sadly that is not how time works. The moment we start changing things, history, or time, will take a completely different direction, everything that happened won't happen in the same way, if at all, because we have changed the pattern," Hermione tried to explain.</p><p>"So….it is like a jigsaw? All the same pieces but because they are being put together in a different way, there is a possibility that it will make a different picture though similar," Minerva put together.</p><p>"Yes, quite," Hermione nodded.</p><p>"So you're going to…" Albus started to say.</p><p>"We're going to make as many changes as we can, as quickly as we can, and then we're just going to have to go along for the ride making sure that Grindelwald doesn't win this time," Harry spoke up from where he was lying awake and clearly listening.</p><p>"Harry? How are you feeling?" Hermione asked peering over at him.</p><p>"Like I have been kicked around," Harry groaned.</p><p>"That would be the magical exhaustion," Albus said dryly.</p><p>"Ah, that would explain it," Harry nodded.</p><p>"Water?" Albus offered</p><p>"Rather have some of that whiskey," Harry grinned nodding to the bottle sitting on the side.</p><p>"Not sure that that would be a good idea. Give it an hour or two and we will see," Albus snorted. "And you're sitting up," He sighed hurrying forward to help Harry sit up.</p><p>"Harry!"</p><p>"Oh stop fussing I am fine," Harry huffed. Albus quickly gripped him and propped him up when he nearly dropped back down. "Mostly, fine,"</p><p>"Are you feeling alright?" Albus frowned.</p><p>"I'm ok, just tired and kicked in. Did you do as I asked?" Harry asked him gripping his wrist again.</p><p>"Yes I did, what you showed me was enough to take a risk on," Albus rubbed at his temple again, the visions of flames and death still filling his senses.</p><p>"I am sorry for that," Harry said squeezing his wrist before releasing it. "That must have been a lot, I am sorry,"</p><p>"It got the job done," Albus cleared his throat.</p><p>"That is something that you're good at," Harry nodded.</p><p>"Pardon?" Albus blinked at Harry's tone.</p><p>"Harry!" Hermione hissed.</p><p>"What?" Harry asked confused.</p><p>"He's not…" Hermione paused glancing to Albus who was looking between the two of them confused.</p><p>"I know that Mione," Harry said sharply.</p><p>"Do you. He's…."</p><p>"What did I do?" Albus asked slowly, looking between the two of them.</p><p>"Nothing," Harry snapped swinging his legs over the side of the bed and stood, and then promptly nearly fell over again. Albus hurried forward and steadied the younger man, looking up at him confused.</p><p>"What did I do to you? Do I do to you?" Albus shook his head.</p><p>"It doesn't matter," Harry shook his head.</p><p>"If I hurt you, past, present or future, it matters to me, it matters because I need to know whether I can trust you, and if you want me to trust you I need to know what I did,"</p><p>"Future you is much more subtle with your manipulation," Harry said dryly. He blinked when Albus ducked his head a little actually looking embarrassed at being called out on it.</p><p>"Manipulation is an art form I suppose, to be honed and learned. Is that what I did to you?" Albus pressed on though.</p><p>"Yes," Harry answered sharply staring down into blue eyes that were so familiar and yet so different. He tilted his head and took in the difference. Albus' beard was only just growing in, this must have been when he really started growing it out, it was fairly full but still very close. White was starting to show in his beard and hair, streaking it and making him look mature despite his much younger face.</p><p>His eyes were the most different though, still a bright sky blue, but they weren't heavy with knowledge and sorrow, they didn't hold the visage of having seen too much, had to bear witness to a lot of horror and hatred, pain and despair.</p><p>They had still seen a lot, they had watched his sister die, they had watched not knowing who had cast that fatal spell. They had had to watch the man he loved become a monster. But they still held an innocence to them.</p><p>"I am sorry," Harry stepped back and released Albus' arms, realising that he had been holding onto the man too tightly and that he had been staring at him too intently. "Hermione is right, that man is not you,"</p><p>"You disliked me, future me?" Albus frowned, rubbing his arms as though they hurt.</p><p>"No, I did not dislike him,"</p><p>"Do you answer everything so shortly!?" Albus huffed clearly becoming frustrated with him.</p><p>"I learned not to give you too much rope for you to run with," Harry smirked a little.</p><p>"So, you did...do dislike me?" Albus scowled, a red flush appearing on his cheeks with his annoyance. It was interesting, actually being able to fluster and shake Albus Dumbledore. He really was so much younger.</p><p>"I do not dislike any version of you Dumbledore. The you from...my timeline, I respected and...liked in many ways. However, I did not trust the way he spoke things into riddles, the way he manipulated others in ways that he saw fit because he believed utterly that his way was the only way. I do not trust a man who thinks that he has all the answers, and the Dumbledore from my timeline realised too late that he did not have all the answers,"</p><p>"So you ask me to trust you when you do not trust me? You're asking me to trust you with the lives of the people I care about," Albus narrowed his eyes onto Harry.</p><p>"I don't know you," Harry shrugged. "We can earn each other's trust as we go. You're...you're not going to become the man that I knew, the Dumbledore from my timeline, who he is won't exist anymore because our presence here will change things. You may become a similar man, but that is not who you are now,"</p><p>"Very wise," Albus blinked.</p><p>"Not judging someone by what you think you know about them, that I learned from my version of you," Harry smirked.</p><p>"So, we work together to try and beat Grindelwald, and learn to trust each other along the way?"</p><p>"Exactly," Harry nodded. "And just...don't try and manipulate me, I don't take well to that," Harry warned.</p><p>"Oh dear Lord, please do not start again," Minerva sighed as Albus opened his mouth to respond with narrowed eyes. The two men turned to see Minerva and Hermione sitting in the chairs in front of the fireplace, teacups in hand and watching the two of them with amusement in his eyes.</p><p>"Are you quite done," Hermione asked. "That did not require a response, Harry, it was a rhetorical question,"</p><p>Harry snapped his mouth shut and rolled his eyes with a pout.</p><p>"So, aside from a brief knowledge of what will happen, is there anything else that you brought with you that could help defeat Grindelwald and his followers?" Minerva asked.</p><p>"Oh yes! We brought back a collection of books with spells, charms and various potions that have been developed in the last 80 odd years, advanced knowledge that we will have that Grindelwald will not," Hermione motioned to their bags.</p><p>"We have a list put together by...our Dumbledore of all of Grindelwald's followers, so we will know every single one of them can stop people being turned, can stop people being blackmailed into it," Harry added.</p><p>"Hang on, you haven't mentioned me in the future….where am I?" Minerva frowned.</p><p>"Oh you were super dead, you went out completely kick arse though! You wiped out like a 20 Death Eaters with you," Harry grinned, before blinking when Albus and Minerva just stared at him.</p><p>"Erm, I should probably take this point to point out that Harry and I have been fighting our war since we were 11, the last seven or eight years of our life has been pretty intense fighting. Our...outlook on things is probably a little twisted, but it is the best way that we could come up with to survive," Hermione coughed.</p><p>"I...erm…" Minerva seemed at a loss for words.</p><p>"Pretty much everyone that we cared about was either dead when we jumped through that gateway or were going to die pretty soon considering they were blocking the way to give us time to cast the spell. We came back here to make sure that every one of them didn't die. We risked the chance of this failing us and ripping us to pieces in a very painful way to take the chance to stop it all happening. You died in our timeline, we won't let it happen in this one," Harry said surely.</p><p>"Thank you, but I am quite capable of taking care of myself, should anything happen to me, it will not be on your head," Minerva smiled.</p><p>"Oh I know you can take care of yourself, 20 Death Eaters," Harry grinned. "We also have something that should be on interest to you," he added looking directly back at Albus</p><p>"The blood pact?" Albus gulped.</p><p>"Other you's notes on how you will break the pact," Harry said and then squinted to make sure he had gotten that right.</p><p>"It is breakable then?" Albus' hand moved to rest over his waistcoat pocket - which Harry absently noted was actually very stylish and fitted, he wasn't sure when the man turned to the lured and….distinct robes he wore in Harry's time. This was much better, well easier on his eyes, colourwise.</p><p>"Yes it is breakable," Hermione said shooting Harry a look.</p><p>"Good, good," Albus closed his eyes for a second before opening them again. "Do you have anything else?"</p><p>"Oh, I am the owner of the Elder Wand!" Harry added drawing his wand and holding it up for them to see. Minerva and Albus both stared at him completely stunned.</p><p>"You have…"</p><p>"Yup, two Elder wands in one place. Reckon this will be a little of a shock to him," Harry grinned.</p><p>"How did you…" Albus blinked at him.</p><p>"Well, in my timeline you defeated Grindelwald, so you became the owner of the wand, a high school student disarmed our timeline Dumbledore, I disarmed him, the wand became mine. I tried to give it back to you, but it wouldn't work properly for you, and things were a little strained between us so neither of us suggested a duel to give it back to you. So Elder wand, mine. I also have my original wand," Harry drew his phoenix wand.</p><p>"That feels...familiar," Albus frowned a little tilting his head.</p><p>Harry and Hermione shot each other a quick look while the two professors were looking at the wands.</p><p>"She's not a great fan of the Elder Wand, but it helps having the two," Harry explained.</p><p>"He's ambiwandrous," Hermione snorted.</p><p>"Professor we came as quickly as we could," Newt bustled in.</p><p>"What was the….is that the Elder wand?!" Theseus gawped at the wand Harry was still holding up.</p><p>"How did you get it?!" Tina stared at him awed.</p><p>"Who are you?" Jacob blinked.</p><p>"Oo! You're from the future!" Queenie chirped staring at Harry and Hermione with wide eyes.</p><p>"What?" Tina, Newt, Theseus and Jacob turned to look at her.</p><p>"Ugh I'm sitting down for this explanation," Harry groaned hobbling over to the stretcher and dropping onto heavily, Albus a few steps behind with his arms held out just in case.</p><p>"So, this is Harry and Hermione, from the future," Albus confirmed.</p><p>"I think I need to sit down for this explanation," Tina said absently as she stared at Harry and Hermione alternately.</p><p>"Oh, I can take care of that," Minerva waved her wand and quickly had enough chairs for everyone.</p><p>"So, from the start…" Hermione sighed.</p>
