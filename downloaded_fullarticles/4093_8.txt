Everyone is relieved, then worried, when he goes silent.</p><p>ii. For a while George uses Fred’s wand. He thought it would feel the same as his own; it doesn’t. He learns more about the ways in which Fred was different than he did when Fred was alive. </p><p>iii. Everyone expects George to name his first son after Fred. He can’t. Fred was his own man. George can’t tangle his brother’s personhood with his child’s.</p><p>iv. George never gets a prosthetic ear. Sometimes he thinks about it, but he can imagine the look on his mother’s face when she sees her dead son, so he doesn’t. </p><p>v. Years later, at his wedding, George has no best man. All his best friends split the best man’s responsibilities between them. </p><p>vi. Sometimes George has dreams so realistic he wakes up forgetting. He starts to tell Angelina what he and Fred got up to before the dream dissolves. </p><p>vii. George orders Fred’s favourite foods at the pub when he’s feeling lonely, even though he never liked tripe. He leaves half for Fred.</p><p>viii. On the bad days, George can’t look at himself in the mirror. Angelina charms the mirrors to ignore him. </p><p>ix. Harry tells George that spirits can become ghosts or move on. George can’t decide which would be more heartbreaking; Fred staying as a ghost or moving on.</p><p>x.
