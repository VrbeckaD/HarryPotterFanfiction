  <em> 1st September 1991 </em>
</p><p>Hermione Granger, 11 years of age soon to be 12, was the first to arrive at platform 9 and 3/4, eager to board the train and start her new adventure.</p><p>Hermione had received her letter inviting her to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry just 3 weeks before and it was the start of a completely new life. For witches and wizards born into a magical family, it was normal to receive a letter inviting them to attend a school of magic. These families prepared for that day from the moment the children could walk and talk. Non magic families are different; they cannot prepare for the unknown, not fully. Children born into these kinds of families are not aware of their abilities. They may experience a few unexplainable situations throughout their childhood but nothing to confirm it; not until they receive their letters which gives them roughly three weeks to prepare for a whole new world. It can be both daunting and exciting, which was the situation in Hermione's case as she was Muggle born.</p><p>When she received her letter inviting her to start school on September the 1st, she couldn't believe it. Once it had finally sunk in, the excitement soon followed. Hermione had purchased every book both on and off her list that she could possibly need and read them all before the 3 weeks were up. There wasn't a chance she was going to arrive at a new school only half prepared, she had years of history to catch up on. Hermione sat beside her parents, waiting for the train to pull into the station. Her suitcase was at the ready and her pet of choice, a small ginger kitten that she'd named Crookshanks, was curled up sound asleep in his cage.</p><p>The roaring sound of the Hogwarts Express releasing steam as it chugged into the station caused Hermione to nearly stop breathing. She turned to her mum, wide eyed and pale as the realisation that she was soon going to have to leave them dawned on her, it was such a bitter sweet.Â </p><p>"You'll be fine sweetheart. You've prepared yourself for this, it's exciting! You're going to have so much fun!" Mrs. Granger said to her daughter with a smile on her face.</p><p>Hermione stood to give her mum a hug goodbye before turning to her dad who was slightly less enthusiastic about this new adventure Hermione was about to take off on. Still proud of his daughter nevertheless, "We will write to you every day if need be, study hard and enjoy yourself," he said with one final squeeze before he finally let her go.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes as she nodded, stepping back to grab her suitcase. With one last sigh, Hermione grabbed the handle on her case and made her way to the train, waving to her parents before she went to find a carriage. An advantage of being early meant that she got the pick of her seat. Most, if not all, were still empty as she made her way into one towards the front of the train. Hermione sat at the window with Crookshanks still sleeping under the foot well and took a book out of her suitcase before putting it in the overhead, waiting patiently for someone to join her in the carriage. After around 20 minutes the train started to get busier. More and more students were outside saying their goodbyes to family members and finding their carriages. Hermione was so engrossed in rereading Hogwarts: A History that she hadn't realised two people had joined her carriage, or how long they had been there.</p><p>"I heard that the Slytherin common room is in the dungeons which takes you under the black lake," one of the boys said.</p><p>"I heard it's in the forbidden forest and you can see all of the creatures at night peering in through the window," the other said.</p><p>"Don't be stupid Blaise. The Dark Forest is nowhere near the castle," the first boy responded, after which he noticed Hermione was peering over her book. "So, you finally noticed we are here then," he said to Hermione.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I was in a world of my own," she said while blushing and closing her book.</p><p>The boy smirked in return, "Figured as much. That's Blaise and I'm Draco, Malfoy." Draco introduced them both to her and held out his hand for her to shake, something told her about the way he said his last night, that she was supposed to know who he was.</p><p>She obliged and shook his hand, smiling at them both, "I'm Hermione." Blaise shook her hand but eyed her skeptically and didn't say anything.</p><p>"We were just talking about what the Slytherin common room probably going to look like. What do you think?" Draco asked, curiosity lit up his face as he waited to hear Hermione's theory.</p><p>"I hadn't really given it much thought if I'm honest. I tried not to get too attached to any particular house in case I didn't get sorted into it."</p><p>"You have a say in what house you are sorted into. We aren't supposed to know that but my father said that if you really don't want to be in the house the hat thinks you should be in, you won't be forced into it. You just think about the one you do want, and it listens. Can you imagine being sorted into Hufflepuff?" He shuddered as he said this, Blaise laughing quietly alongside him.</p><p>Hermione gave a small smile, although she didn't agree, she didn't know what house she wanted to be in. But she was going to leave the decision down the the hat either way. "There isn't a single Malfoy that wasn't in Slytherin so it's a done deal really. The same goes for Blaise too,"</p><p>Hermione nodded, listening to Draco whilst Blaise continued to watch her suspiciously. "Are there really ghosts that roam the castle?" Hermione asked Draco, his eyebrows raised in disbelief.</p><p>"Of course there are. Haven't you ever seen a ghost before?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head and it finally dawned on her that there was a whole world she didn't know about that, in less than a few hours, she would officially be apart of.</p><p>"What did you say your name was again?" Draco asked her. In that moment the door for the carriage slid open and a small round boy stood in the entrance way. Both Draco and Blaise turned their nose up at the boy and watched as he stood panting in the doorway.</p><p>"Has anybody seen a toad? I've lost mine," the boy breathed.</p><p>Hermione shook her head as Draco and Blaise sniggered at him and turned away like he didn't exist.</p><p>"I will help you to find it if you like?" Hermione offered the boy, his face lit up in response. As Hermione got up to leave the carriage Draco stood up with her.</p><p>"Are you coming back?" He asked her.</p><p>She nodded with a puzzled expression, leaving the carriage as he slowly sat back down.</p><p>"What was that about?" Blaise asked Draco as the carriage door closed.</p><p>"What d'you mean? Nothing," Draco responses defensively.</p><p>Blaise smirked and took advantage of the embarrassment Draco was feeling, "Does someone have a crush already?" Draco hit Blaise in the arm and picked up Hermione's book, "She's a little odd don't you think? And she didn't say her last name, which means she's probably a Half-blood," Blaise said.</p><p>Draco ignored him and skimmed over the book. Hermione had made notes on all of the pages, she'd clearly studied this book before starting school. Maybe Blaise was right.</p><p>Hermione went down from carriage to carriage asking everyone about the missing toad which nobody had seen. She was beginning to get fed up when she opened the door to a carriage that had two boys still dressed in their own clothes; not like the ones back in her carriage who were already in their school robes. One of the boys held his wand in his hand whilst a rat lay sprawled out across his lap, with its head head rummaging around in a box of sweets. He looked up once he noticed Hermione standing at the door.</p><p>"Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost his," she asked while looking around the room at the mountains of sweets, her eyes landing back on the red haired boy's wand, "Oh, you're doing magic? Let's see then," she asked.</p><p>The boy cleared his throat and held his wand high, "Sunshine daisies, butter mellow.. Turn this stupid fat rat yellow," he flicked his wand and a yellow light shone inside the sweet box but nothing further happened. Confusion swept over his face as he looked at the other boy beside him.</p><p>"Are you sure that's a real spell?' said Hermione, "Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me. For example." She cleared her throat and positioned herself in front of the boy with glasses. "Oculus reparo," she spoke clearly and flicked her wand. A quick spark of grey smoke shot out of the end and within a second, his glasses were fixed and clean, like new. "Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter! I'm Hermione Granger, and you are?" She asked the boy who still held his wand above his rat.</p><p>"Ron Weasley."</p><p>"Pleasure," she smiled at him and stood up to leave, "You two should get into your robes, I should expect we will be arriving soon." With that she left and headed back to her own carriage, something about Harry and Ron made her slightly more comfortable than Blaise and Draco, after only spending a few short minutes with them. Even if Ron did have dirt on his face without realising.</p><p>As Hermione entered her carriage she noticed Blaise was sleeping and Draco had his head buried deep in her book. He hadn't noticed her walking back in and sitting down when she spoke, "Now who's in a world of their own?" She asked Draco.</p><p>He jumped at the sound of her voice and closed the book, "Sorry. I got bored and the notes are quite interesting. Did you make them all yourself?" he asked whilst passing the book back to her.</p><p>Hermione nodded as she took it off him, "I like to read. Sometimes I have thoughts or ideas about something I've read and I don't want to forget them so I write them down. Plus I like the idea of my future children being able to read what I was thinking whilst I was on that particular page," She said.</p><p>"I like to read too. We have a huge library in the manor, it's probably my favourite room. It's got hundreds of books, thousands even. What's your favourite book?" Draco hadn't realised that he had probably asked Hermione the most difficult question she could ever imagine to answer.</p><p>"That's not an easy question to answer, I don't feel like I've found my favourite book yet."</p><p>"Well I have plenty of recommendations if ever you need any," as Draco finished his sentence, the train came to a halt at the Hogsmeade station for students arriving at Hogwarts.Â </p><p>Hermione was immediately filled with worry and excitement. She had only ever seen photos of Hogwarts but now she would be seeing it for real. Draco woke Blaise by hitting him in the stomach causing him to wake with a scowl. Hermione shook her head as he did it and grabbed her suitcase ready to head out onto the platform. The first years took an enchanted boat ride to the castle which showed the land at its best angle, Hermione thought it looked magnificent. She sat in a boat along with the boy named Neville who she met on the train and another who from, what she could gather, was Irish as he spoke about the creatures that were in the lake beneath them.</p><p>As they all arrived at the castle they were accompanied up a set of stairs where they waited outside a set of large doors. Everyone excitedly talking amongst themselves about what may be on the other side.</p><p>"So it's true then," Draco's voice quietened down the group of students as people turned to see him clearer. "Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts."</p><p>"Harry Potter is here?" One student whispered.</p><p>"I heard he had a scar across his face," Another whispered, all the while Draco was moving to the front of the group to stand in front of Harry.</p><p>"This is Crabbe, and Goyle," he gestured to the two boys he had been stood next to, "And I'm Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," Hermione heard him introduce himself once more, his name still not ringing any bells to her ad it was clear to see from the expression Harry wore, he too was none the wiser. As he introduced himself Ron who stood beside Harry made a small chocking sound followedd by an eye roll, just loud enough for Draco to hear. "Do you think my names funny? There's no need to ask yours, red hair and hand-me-down robes, you must be a <em>Weasley.</em>" Draco hissed and turned his attention back to Harry, "You'll soon learn that some Wizarding families are better than others. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there," He held out his hand for Harry to shake.</p><p>Ron's cheeks flushed as he glared after Draco's, "I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself Thanks," Harry responded.</p><p>In that moment a tall slim woman, wearing a dark emerald green dress appeared and tapped Draco on the shoulder, he glanced around to see who it was and moved back to his original place in the group but not before scowling at Harry as he did.</p><p>"My names Professor McGonagall. Welcome to Hogwarts. The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room. The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. I shall take you through now," McGonagall finished and lead the group of students through the double doors and into the great hall.</p><p>As the students walked through the hall towards the front, all of their faces lit up as they looked around at all of the enchantments. The ceiling looked like the night sky as floating candles surrounded the room.</p><p>"It's not real you know. It's made to look like the night sky, I read about it in-" Hermione started to tell a girl next to her when she heard someone finish her sentence,</p><p>"<em>Hogwarts: A History </em>," she turned to see that the voice belonged to Draco who was smiling at her as she headed to the front. How could the boy she met on the train be the same boy who spoke to Harry with such disgust towards Ron?</p><p>The students gathered around the front of the hall before a stool that the infamous sorting hat rested on. McGonagall stood at the front and gathered everyone around, "Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words," She moved aside and everybody's eyes shifted to an elderly looking man at the centre of the table, with his long beard tucked into his belt.</p><p>"I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also our caretaker, Mr Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds, to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you," he finished and took his seat once more.</p><p>McGonagall turned back to face the group and held up her scroll, "When I call your name, you shall come forth. I will place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses.. Hermione Granger."</p><p>Hermione paled slightly as her name was called out first. She headed up the small steps to reach McGonagall who held the hat up for her to sit under it. Once she sat down the hat was placed on the top her head and she could feel it move instantly.</p><p>"Ahhh, right then, hmmm," the hat spoke out. Hermione squirmed beneath it as it moved around on her head trying to decide on her house, "Gryffindor!" The Gryffindor table erupted with cheers and applause as Hermione hopped off the stool and ran over to join their table. She caught site of Ron who rolled his eyes and not far from him, Draco who looked slightly disappointed at the result.</p><p>"Draco Malfoy," McGonagall called next, he made his way through the group up to the top of the stairs and sat on the stool.</p><p>Before the hat had even touched Draco's head it shouted, "Slytherin!" The Slytherin table erupted with cheers as a few members stood up to clap.</p><p>"Ronald Weasley," Ron slowly made his way to the stool, his nervousness showing on his face.</p><p>"Ah! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!" The hat shouted, the Gryffindor table clapped and cheered, a few more students with features that resembled Ron's stood up to pat him on his back as he sat down at the table.</p><p>"Harry Potter," McGonagall spoke and the entire hall, teachers and all, went silent. Harry made his way up to the front and he could feel all eyes burning into him as he sat down with McGonagall placing the hat on his head.</p><p>"Hmm difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind either and talent! Oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?" The hat spoke whilst Harry mumbled the words not Slytherin, it continued, "Not Slytherin ay? But are you sure? You could be great y'know. It's all here, in your head, and Slytherin could help you on your way to greatness, there is no doubt about that. No?.." Harry continued to whisper to himself as the hat still struggled to choose, "No? Well.. better be... Gryffindor!"</p><p>The entire table stood up, clapping and cheering as Harry made his way over to take his place next to Hermione. Once everyone was sorted into their houses, Dumbledore stood up and called the feast to an official start. Plates and plates of food from all around the world appeared in front of everyone. Ron did not hesitate to get stuck into the meal. Before Hermione had a chance to process the amount of food, Ron already had a plate and mouth full.</p><p>"Harry, show us your scar," A red haired boy called over.</p><p>"Ignore Fred. He's one of my annoying brothers," Ron said to Harry through a mouth full of chicke.</p><p>"Annoying perhaps, but handsome? Most definitely," Fred's identical twin brother added.</p><p>"And that's George."</p><p>Harry laughed at the boys and pulled back his hair slightly to show his scar to the twins.</p><p>"Wicked," they said in unison.</p><p>"Does it hurt?" Hermione asked Harry who shook his head in response.</p><p>Everybody continued to eat their meals and get to know their new housemates. Hermione glanced around the room at the other house tables and spotted Draco on the Slytherin table, who was looking at her, his eyes averted the second she noticed.</p><p>"Ron?" He made a grunting noise in response to her, but no other indication that he was actually listening. "Draco Malfoy, why was he so horrible to you? Do you know him?" She asked.</p><p>Ron actually swallowed what was in his mouth and cleared his throat before he spoke. "Our dads work together at the Ministry. He's not a very nice person from the sounds of things. The whole Malfoy family are arseholes if I'm honest. All a bunch of Pureblood extremists. Not one of them turned out okay. Draco will be the same. There isn't a witch or Wizard that turned bad that wasn't in Slytherin," he added before picking up some more food.</p><p>Hermione glanced over at Draco again and observed him briefly as he watched his friends, Crab and Goyle, who were shovelling more food into their mouths than Ron. After the feast finished the prefects guided the first years of their houses back to the common rooms. The Gryffindor common room was comfortably small. There was a fire lit in the corner and a few bookcases filled to the brim with books all shapes and sizes, and desks on either side. There were various kinds of light brown seats scattered around the room, with walls coated in a deep shade of red and flashes of gold throughout, Hermione smiled to herself as she approved of the common room she would be tied to for the next seven years.</p><p>~X~</p><p>The Gryffindor students made their way to their dorm rooms, where all of their belongings they had brought with them were already positioned next to their beds. The first thing Hermione wanted to do was to unpack her books and set them up on her nightstand. When she reached her bed she noticed there was a book already on the table, she assumed, was something that everybody received on their first day, a guide to the school for Muggleborns perhaps. After glancing around the room she realised this wasn't the case as she was the only one with a book beside her bed.</p><p>The exterior of the book was a deep blood red colour. There were no pictures or writing, no title, just a fabric cover. When she opened the book she found a little note inside that read <em> 'First recommendation, enjoy.'Â  </em>with nothing further. No signature from whoever sent it, although Hermione had her suspicions. She turned the first page of the book and read the title '<em>Darkness Falls' </em>, with no indication to the author. Hermione put down the book before she became too drawn in by her curiosity and continued to unpack the rest of her things.</p><p>~X~</p><p>The Slytherin common room was quite the opposite to Gryffindor's. The walls stood tall with shades of emerald painted across the room and silver drapes hanging over them. The sofas that were dotted around were black leather and cold, which seemed to be the running theme of the Slytherin common room. After being shown around the common room the first years were guided to their dorms where they found their belongings. Less eager to unpack than the Gryffindor's, most of them returned back to the common room once the tour was over.</p><p>"How are you <em>still</em> eating?" Blaise asked Goyle who shrugged whilst he stuffed more cake into his mouth.</p><p>Draco joined the group a few moments later and almost as if out of natural instinct Crab moved out of his seat to stand up and let Draco sit down.</p><p>"Where've you been?" Blaise asked Draco.</p><p>"I had something to do, never you mind."</p><p>Blaise huffed at his response and turned to face the rest of the group to make introductions for Draco, not that many where required, "Draco this is Daphne Greengrass, obviously you remember Theo, not sure if you're properly acquainted with Pansy. Guys this is Draco Malfoy," he finished.</p><p>"Draco Malfoy, as I live and breath. Pansy <em>Parkinson, </em>my father has told me lots about you," Pansy spoke first, not a hint of shyness emitted from her. She was very outgoing and cared little for what others thought about her, that much was clear.</p><p>"I imagine he has. Rufus Parkinson, I assume?" He asked, gaining a nod from her. "Nice to finally meet you."</p><p>"Agreed. He speaks very highly of your family, he's even mentioned once or twice about a family agreement regarding our future." Pansy drawled, looking around at the group rather than at the person she spoke to, it was clear to Draco that she enjoyed attention.</p><p>"Is that so?" Draco questioned, he'd often heard of Pureblood families arranging marriages for their children, he'd even over heard his father once or twice mention the Parkinsons names in reference to that very topic, but he never paid much attention to it.</p><p>The rest of the group were discussing what lessons were going to be like having to share with other houses as Draco's mind wandered to the book he'd sent to Hermione, curious as to whether or not she was reading it or if she had even noticed it was there. A small smile appeared on his face when he imagined that she probably completely bypassed it when unpacking her other books, to wrapped up in her excitement.</p><p>~X~</p><p>Hermione finished unpacking and becoming accustomed to her new room, turning towards her bed, she climbed up and tucked herself in. After over an hour of excitement in the girls dormitory, everyone quieted down, mentally preparing for tomorrow's lessons. Hermione switched off her lamp and snuggled down beneath the blanket. After a moment her eyes adjusted to the dark room and she found herself looking at the book on her bedside table. Hermione felt her eyes becoming heavy, just before she drifted off completely, she wondered how Draco had managed to sneak the book into her room.</p><p>Â </p>
