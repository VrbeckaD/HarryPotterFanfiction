  <span>It had been many years since that fateful night that the Potter twins lost their parents and were ‘dumped’ on the doorstep of the Dursley’s though if you were to look around the perfectly normal house and see all the photos that adorned the walls you would never of known that there were </span>
  <em>
    <span>three</span>
  </em>
  <span> children living in the three bedded house that was situated along privet drive, looking exactly like the other houses on the street.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>You would never know that two young occupants of the house were anything but </span>
  <em>
    <span>normal</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>You would never know that despite there being three kids in the house one of them was a spoiled child with two bedrooms all to himself, whilst the two remaining children shared a tiny broom cupboard under the stairs. Though you’ll never hear them complain though at times they wanted to, they held their tongue to their checks and bared with it, cracking down with the list of chores they were given that would of took them all day if they had been all on their own, they’d cook and grand feast for their </span>
  <em>
    <span>family</span>
  </em>
  <span> whilst only having a slice of bread for themselves, if they were lucky and their relatives were in a good mood they’d be given a slice each.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And whilst this was completely and totally unfair, the twins didn’t say anything, they had learnt not to. They were just thankful they had each other, though they often wished the other wasn’t there to suffer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a summer day in June when they began questioning everything, and it started with a shrill voice and heavy knocks on the cupboard door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Up! Get up you two! Now!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both twins jerked awake with a start bashing foreheads in the process causing them both to groan in unison.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you both awake yet?!” Their aunts shrill voice calls out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Almost.” Harry replies back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well hurry up!” She snaps back, the door doing nothing to muffle her annoying voice. “I want you both to cook a full breakfast and not to burn anything, I want everything perfect for my Duddy’s birthday.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They both let out another groan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What was that?” She snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing.” Both twins said, rubbing sleep from her eye’s June looked over at her brother, apparently they both had forgotten about their darling cousins birthday. Both began getting dressed, a task that was slowly becoming more difficult the older they got, as the bigger they grew the less room in the cupboard they had and they were sharing with what already dwelled in there, June watched as Harry pulled a spider of his socks.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once the pair were dressed they made their way down the hall and to the kitchen. The table was hidden beneath all the presents Dudley had gotten June looked at her brother, watching him look at the presents with an air of sadness. It made her angry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was the eldest and felt responsible for making sure Harry was happy. It was one of the only questions their aunt had answered out of the questions they asked. Juniper was the older by 10 minutes, and she took it to heart. One time their </span>
  <em>
    <span>uncle </span>
  </em>
  <span>had backhanded Harry so hard he had fallen to the floor letting out a cry and when the man went to kick him June launched herself at him screaming bloody murder. She remembered the time well they were four. All around them the windows began to shake photo frames broke up. Her aunt had to pull her off and then both twins were thrown into the cupboard where June cradled Harry against her humming to him as he clinged to her trying to control his sobs. Neither twin was ever hit again after that. Though they were still made to do chores. One day June knew they would be free of this place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Due to their mistreatment both kids were a lot smaller for their age and thanks to their cousin they were quite fast too. As twins though they didn’t look that much alike, the only thing similar was the bright green eyes, where Harry had short messy black hair June had short wavy red hair, they both had pale porcelain skin but June was covered in a light dusting of freckles, both had thin defined faces however June seemed to have more sharper cheekbones. Another thing was her brother had to wear glasses and June did not.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the June began cooking the bacon and making the pancakes Harry began getting out the plates utensils when the sound of a baby elephant walking could be heard overheard followed by the sound of an even bigger elephant sounded over head, the twins exchanged looks both focusing back on the task at hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The door slammed open and their greedy cousin came in, ignoring the twins and heading straight for the presents.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon after their uncle came in, “Comb your hair.” he  barked out to Harry as he started flipping the bacon when he sister was mixing choc chips into the pancake mix. Both twins exchanged looks, June rolled her eyes bringing a small smile to Harry’s face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They both ignored when Dudley started whining that he didn’t have enough presents, though they silently seethed.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed it just wasn't Dudley's day as not long after their aunt got a call from Mrs. Figg. Normally on Dudley’s birthday they took him and a friend to all these different and exciting places and left the twins with the neighbour, a nice but boring lady that often talked about her cats. Whilst Dudley’s mouth fell open with horror, Harry’s heart leapt with joy at the thought of not having to go to Mrs. Figg's, June felt panic settle into her stomach… what if their family decided to just lock them in the cupboard all day or worse bring them and leave them in the car, at least if they were left here there was a chance to escape the cupboard. As if hearing her thoughts her aunt stated that they weren’t being left in the house in case they destroyed to which their uncle replied he wasn’t going to leave them in the car for that exact reason, they decided to just bring them much to Dudley’s dismay as he began ‘crying’, though he stopped as soon as his rat face friend arrived.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a very sunny Saturday and so they had gone to the zoo, at the entrance they bought Dudley and his friend Piers two large chocolate ice cream, and both they could hurry away the lady saw the twins and asked what they want, so they ended up getting a cheap ice lolly each Harry a lemon flavoured one and June a strawberry, and they both thought they were really good.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The twins were having the times of their life’s, they made sure to stay well out of their cousin and his friends way. When they had lunch at the zoo restaurant and Dudley throw a tantrum about how his knickerbocker glory wasn’t big enough, the twins got to share it when their Uncle got Dudley a bigger one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>June knew this was all to good to last.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After lunch they went to the reptile house, whilst there Dudley and their uncle began to bang on the glass to make a snake move when they moved on the twins apologised and weren’t surprised when the snake spoke back, after all it happened all the time when they did the gardening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>:Sorry about that.: </span>
  </em>
  <span>June began.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>:He’s our cousin and he’s always that rude.: </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry stated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The snake just nodded to them in understanding they were both shoved to the side though when their cousin and his friend saw the snake moving for them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And that when it happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The glass vanished.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And the screaming began. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The twins laid there in shock, watching as the snake slithered out to them. :</span>
  <em>
    <span>Thanks amigo’s, I’m off to Brazil.:</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>:Anytime.: </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry said still shocked</span>
  <em>
    <span>.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>:Good luck.: </span>
  </em>
  <span>June said also still shocked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the snake was gone they both looked back to where their cousin and his friend had fallen into the habitat they watched as they stood up and tried to get out only to start screaming when the glass was somehow back in place. Their aunt began crying banging on the glass as if it would somehow open. The twins couldn’t help but laugh, they soon stopped when their uncle looked at them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once back in the house their uncle threw them in the cupboard with not so much as a word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened earlier?” Harry whispered to June with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I dunno it was almost like…” She trailed off turning her gaze to her brothers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like magic.” They both said looking at each other. But that couldn’t be true could it? Magic wasn’t real, was it?</span>
