    <p>“Ready, dear?” Ginny’s mum sniffed in a trembling voice. Though Ginny almost didn’t notice her mother speak—she was too busy glaring at the black-robed Death Eater guards at the entrance, checking the students for their tickets. She turned when she spoke, softly gasping at her mother’s tear-filled eyes.
	</p><p>“Oh, Mum,” said Ginny, breaking down and pulling her mum in for a tight hug. 
      </p><p>  She allowed her to relax, for things to stay that way, for ten seconds, then reluctantly pulled back and grabbed her mother by the hands. 
</p><p>	“Mum. I love you. Stay safe, keep the boys behaved and please—please don’t cry for me. It’ll be very soon until I come back for Christmas. I promise,” said Ginny reassuringly.
</p><p>	“Oh Ginny… I love you,” Mum whispered, tears trickling down despite Ginny’s words, and pulled Ginny in for an even tighter hug. 
   </p><p>     “I love you too, Mum.” Ginny mumbled, wiping her eyes. 
   </p><p>      The train whistle rang. Ginny and her mother jumped back at the loud clatter. 
    </p><p>    “Oh, Ginny dear, here’s your trunk, and write to me as soon as you get there!” her mother rushed out. She hurried to help Ginny with her trunk. Together they ran to the train entrance, where a Death Eater was waiting impatiently.
     </p><p>   At the entrance of the train, the man asked for her ticket.
     </p><p>   “Watch where you’re going! You’re late. Ticket?” He asked rudely, not even bothering to look at Ginny. 
     </p><p>   “I just got my trunk,” Ginny clipped out, just as equally rude. 
    </p><p>    She entered the train and hurried down the hall to where they had planned to meet. Luna and Neville were already there. 
    </p><p>    After a quick rejoice, the train started to move. Ginny peered out the window, relieved to find her mother still standing there, and waved a last farewell. Her mother caught Ginny’s hand, and she tried to run over to her. 
     </p><p>   A Death Eater blocked her mother’s way. The last image she saw of her mother before she left was her hand upraised in a last wave, angling her body as far from the Death Eater but somehow as close to Ginny as possible, tears in her eyes. Ginny waved back, and watched as her mother slowly disappeared from view, the train picking up speed. 
      </p><p>  Ginny sighed. <em>It will be fine</em>, she consoled herself. <em>Christmas would come soon. </em>
</p><p>-+-+-+- 
 </p><p>       “Great welcoming committee. They made me feel really welcome,” Ginny muttered, crossing her arms. 
    </p><p>    “Did you run into the same moron?” Luna chirped curiously.
    </p><p>    “Was he wearing black?” asked Ginny, before she could think.
    </p><p>    “No, he was wearing bright pink,” Luna tittered with laughter.
    </p><p>    “They gave us trouble, too. They took away Luna’s Quibbler and told her that if they saw her with it again, she would be banned,” said Neville, ignoring Luna. 
    </p><p>    “I think they were warned about us.” said Luna, gazing out the window, though without the usual airiness in her voice.
      </p><p>  “Why?” asked Neville, as if he didn’t already know.
    </p><p>    “Because they know we’re friends with Harry,” pouted Luna. <em>More than friends at one point</em>, thought Ginny darkly.
    </p><p>    “Yeah. They made me open my trunk, and crumpled all my papers,” complained Neville.
    </p><p>    Ginny rolled her eyes. “What, like our parents would let us pack anything other than papers.”
    </p><p>    “Any news about Harry, Ron and Hermione?” asked Luna spontaneously. 
    </p><p>    “No, not since the wedding,” Ginny muttered, unconsciously crossing her arms and frowning. 
     </p><p>   “But if the Boy Who Lived was caught, wouldn’t You-Know-Who post it all over the place?” suggested Neville hopefully. 
    </p><p>    “But what’s the importance in the death of a blood traitor, or a muggle born?” Ginny added with a cold tone in her voice.
    </p><p>    “Ginny,” Luna murmured, placing a hand on her knee. “We can’t think of what it could’ve been, or it may truly happen.” 
   </p><p>     “So… do you guys really think he’s been caught?” asked Ginny, true fear leaking into her voice.
   </p><p>     “No. Harry knows what he’s doing, and so does Ron. And plus, Hermione’s with them. With her, they’ll make it out of anything. I know I have,” Neville reassured again.
   </p><p>     “Ginny, Neville’s right. With Hermione with them, they can make it out any tough situation. Without her, they’d be dead by now,” said Luna, the airiness in her voice returning. Ginny laughed without amusement, though her arms uncrossed. 
   </p><p>     “What about the Carrows, and Snape?” asked Neville nervously.
     </p><p>   “Oh, them?  Dumbledore’s Army, of course,” said Ginny, with an air of confidence.
     </p><p>   Neville bit his lip. “Ginny, what if the original members don’t want in?”
    </p><p>   Then it will be just the three of us,” replied Ginny stubbornly.
     </p><p>   “Yes, but would Dumbledore’s Army now be against the Death Eaters, or the Slytherins? Last time, it was against Umbridge and the Ministry. The Inquisitorial Squad was basically under the Ministry too, and that was made up of Slytherins,” Luna slightly rambled.
    </p><p>    “Good point. And there will be new students and new professors,” said Ginny. 
  </p><p>      <em>And headmasters, too.</em>
    </p><p>    “Okay, um, how ‘bout we lay low for a bit and get a taste of the new people. Then we’ll know if we really have to have D.A. up again,” suggested Neville. “But looking at the security here, I think we will.”  
    </p><p>    “Yeah. We’ll see if we really need to do something about the professors before we start. And, y’know, for now, I think it should stay between the three of us. I don’t want to get people’s hopes up,” agreed Ginny. 
      </p><p>  “OK,” Luna shrugged, finalising the idea. 
     </p><p>   The three friends then fell into a troubling silence, all lost in their own thoughts the entire way to Hogwarts. 
</p><p>-+-+-+- 
    </p><p>    Ginny stretched her legs out in front of her, and yawned. The ride in the carriage was restless and bumpy, disrupting her hopes of getting a nap. On the journey, they had made attempts to talk, but it always led to more worrying, so Ginny stopped the chatter and resigned to gazing out the window, much like Luna. 
    </p><p>    The train bell clanged once again, signaling the end of their journey.
     </p><p>   The three meandered out of the train, all stretching from the long trip.
   </p><p>     “Neville!” called the familiar voice of Seamus Finnigan. 
    </p><p>    Ginny watched as Neville’s head shot up. “Seamus!” he called out, joy clear in his voice. The two boys ran at each other and locked themselves in a hug as if they haven’t seen each other in years. 
     </p><p>   “Padma, Parvati!” called out Luna, bouncing on her heels.
   </p><p>     “Luna!” The group of girls ran to each other and hugged. 
     </p><p>   Ginny squinted, and saw another figure. Trailing behind them was Lavender.
     </p><p>   “Lavender!” called out Ginny happily.
       </p><p> “Ginny?” Lavender ran up to embrace her. Ginny smiled, and returned the hug. 
       </p><p> “How was your summer?” asked Lavender, breaking away reluctantly.
    </p><p>    “Fine. Yours?”
    </p><p>    “Good. Mum almost didn’t want me coming back, though, with everything going on,” said Lavender. “Good thing she didn’t change her mind!”
    </p><p>    Seamus’s voice cut into their conversation. Ginny glanced over, seeing them already walking away.
     </p><p>   “Come on, we’ll lose all the good seats!” he shouted.
    </p><p>    “Coming!” Lavender called back.
   </p><p>     “Let’s go,” Lavender said, pulling on Ginny’s arm gently. Ginny quickly followed, and they walked into the Entrance Hall. 
     </p><p>   But once Ginny had entered, she knew something was wrong. There wasn’t the usual warm chatter. She couldn’t hear any laughter. And the place felt cold and uninviting, as if the Headmaster didn’t want people coming in. Ginny looked at her friends, startled. From the looks on their faces, they felt the same. <em>What have they done to Hogwarts?</em>
      </p><p>  As they trailed down the hallway, footsteps echoing off the walls, Ginny could tell there was definitely something wrong. The Great Hall didn’t give off the warm glow and feeling it used to.
     </p><p>   Ginny shivered, but it wasn’t just the cold. 
     </p><p>   She noticed her friends’ footsteps slow, and looked to see what was wrong. Her eyes met the cold, unforgiving ones of Severus Snape, Headmaster of Hogwarts, killer of Albus Dumbledore. 
     </p><p>   <em>How dare he stand in his place</em>, fumed Ginny. 
     </p><p>   Seamus leaned in. “Let’s get to a seat before he kills us,” he whispered, not entirely joking. It was then that Ginny realized that they were still standing in the middle of the Great Hall. Ginny hurried after her friends to an empty row of seats. 
  </p><p>      As she sat down, Ginny quickly scanned the staff table. 
  </p><p>      There was Snape, in the middle, sitting in the Headmaster’s chair, looking as smug as ever. 
   </p><p>     Hatred coursed through her body. It felt disrespectful to be sitting under a Headmaster who deserved absolutely no right to replace Dumbledore. 
     </p><p>   Of course, no one could. But especially not Snape. 
     </p><p>   There was an empty seat to the left of him, and Ginny assumed that, with the new Headmaster, Professor McGonagall would not be Deputy Headmistress anymore. A man, who Ginny thought was Professor Carrow, was sitting on the right side of Snape, symbolising the right hand man. <em>Great, now’s there two idiots leading the school. </em>
     </p><p>   His sister was beside him, smirking. <em>Nevermind, three.</em>
    </p><p>    Professor Sprout was beside the empty seat for Professor McGonagall, with a worried look on her face. Professor Flitwick was beside her, facing the other direction. 
   </p><p>     From the corner of her eye, Ginny caught the cold stare of Snape. Ginny quickly looked away, shivering—his eyes seemed to burn ice-cold heat into her. 
   </p><p>     She decided to look around, trying to get her mind off Snape. As hard as she tried, Ginny couldn’t hear the quiet hum of chatter around the Great Hall. She couldn’t even feel the warm feeling of home around her. Ginny hated it, and from the looks on the students’ faces around her, she could tell that the rest of them were just as scared. 
     </p><p>   Her thoughts were interrupted as the doors of the Great Hall opened, and marched in Professor McGonagall, the first years nervously trailing behind her. They came down the hall and meekly lined up, as Professor McGonagall instructed. She pulled out the Sorting Hat and placed it on the old, rickety stool. 
      </p><p>  Ginny listened in anticipation, wondering what kind of song it would sing out this time. 
     </p><p>   The hat slowly opened it’s “mouth” as the first-years stared in wonder. With a breath, it began to sing (but perhaps with a more ominous tone than usual, or maybe it was just Ginny’s mind wandering along the worst situations possible.)

</p>
<p> Is it going to be the house of Godric Gryffindor? 
</p>
<p>Those who will be brave and reckless forevermore. 
</p>
<p>You and Slytherins don’t get along, 
</p>
<p>but that is the house where you may belong.

</p>
<p>If not Gryffindor, then perhaps Ravenclaw.
</p>
<p>Doing those amazing spells while others stare in awe.
</p>
<p>With a quick and intelligent brain,
</p>
<p>doing unique magic while others do plain.

</p>
<p>Maybe you’ll be more Hufflepuff,
</p>
<p>Meek but loyal, with lots of love.
</p>
<p>Sweet, modest, and dedicated,
</p>
<p>a lot of them are underestimated.

	</p><p>Ginny was lost in thought, and tuned out the rest of the song, until a firm, familiar voice pulled her back to reality. 
	</p><p>“When I call your name, you shall place on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” said Professor McGonagall. The first years nodded, and Ginny could almost see them trembling. 
</p><p>	“Abagot, Elizabeth!” 
</p><p>	Ginny felt a pang of sympathy for the girl; it was always the hardest to be sorted first, and it was even harder in times like these. A pink-faced girl with swishing blond braids slowly walked up to the hat, and placed it gingerly on her head. After what seemed like hours, the girl seemingly moving her lips with no sound, the hat shouted: “GRYFFINDOR!” Ginny clapped loudly along with her fellow Gryffindors. At least one thing wasn’t changed; housemates still clapped for each other. 
</p><p>	She saw a few second years welcome the girl into their ranks. Ginny suddenly felt a pull of pity. All these young witches and wizards, and their first year at Hogwarts would be the hardest yet. They wouldn’t be able to enjoy it like she or her brothers did. They would never see Hogwarts as she did. Not now at least. Not with Snape as Headmaster. 
	</p><p>As Ginny was lost in her thoughts once more, the Sorting flew by. Before she knew it, Professor McGonagall had reached the end as she called out:
</p><p>	“Zimmer, Anthony!” A black-haired, blue-eyed boy walked up confidently to the hat and eagerly jammed it on. The hat just skimmed his head when it shouted,
	</p><p>“SLYTHERIN!”
	</p><p>The Slytherin table on the other side clapped and hooted. Anthony walked, again with confidence to the Slytherin table and sat down. <em>Great. Another Malfoy,</em> thought Ginny, seeing the clear resemblance. 
	</p><p>Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and stool and took her place at the staff table, beside Snape. 
	</p><p>Snape had now stood up. He spread out his arms with a blank expression on his face, as if he was brainwashed. Maybe he was, thought Ginny grimly. He addressed the students.
	</p><p>“Welcome back to Hogwarts. If you have eyes, you can see that I am the new Headmaster. Do not expect me to be as easy on you as Dumbledore. All those grown lazy and undisciplined would be smart enough to change their ways into my expectations, or unnecessary consequences will be severe. 
	</p><p>“Meanwhile, we have some staff changes. Welcome Professor Amycus Carrow, and his sister, Professor Alecto Carrow. They will be teaching Muggle Studies and Defense Against the Dark Arts. They will also be in charge of discipline; all Professors will send their detentions to Professor Carrow here.” 
</p><p>	Ginny directed his attention. Amycus Carrow had a hunched back, pale and doughy face, with tiny dark eyes. Even Ginny could see his smug grin. His sister looked a lot like him. The Professor Carrows stood up to acknowledge their arrival. The students and staff clapped, but with a muted excitement. Ginny noticed that a few of the teachers clapped only once or twice, much like Ginny. 
	</p><p>Snape spoke again, “And there will be dementors patrolling all grounds and all entrances in and out of here. All of the entrances.” Snape’s eyes locked with Ginny’s. She quickly looked away, away from his piercing eyes, away from his voice, which seemed to cut into her like a blade. 
</p><p>	“There will also be an earlier curfew. For all students,” Snape said. “By 7:30, I want all students to be in their common rooms. If you are caught by any of the professors here, you will receive detention. As I have said before, this rule applies to all students, all ages, all houses. There will be no exceptions. For anyone.” 
	</p><p>Snape met eyes with every student in the room. Ginny felt that he didn’t need too. His speech was rooted in her mind for all eternity. 
	</p><p>“There will also be no Inter-House Quidditch Championships. But the Inter-House Championship will continue,” added Snape, as though that made it up. <em>No Quidditch? And an earlier curfew? Bloody Snape. As if you haven’t ruined Hogwarts already. </em>
	</p><p>There were so many downsides to the early curfew. It would be harder to sneak out, with curfew so early, and without Harry’s invisibility cape, Ginny didn’t know how they could do it. 
	</p><p>“And now you may tuck in,” said Snape, and with the Headmaster’s say, the food appeared on the tables. <em>And where’s the Hogwarts song? We always have a song… until now. Why does Snape have to ruin everything? </em>
	</p><p>Ginny snapped back to reality by the slight sounds of forks and plates colliding; she hadn’t realized she was hungry. And once again, the hall was silent. Ginny didn’t dare talk; Snape had already singled her out with his eyes once. She didn’t need it again. 
	</p><p>Ginny quickly finished her dinner and hurried to whisper to Neville that she was going to bed. Ginny rushed to the portrait of the Fat Lady and it was only when she got there, that she realised she didn’t know the password. 
	</p><p>An idea buzzed through her head, and Ginny thought that it was worth a try.
</p><p>	“Hello, may I enter?” Ginny asked politely to the Fat Lady.
	</p><p>“Do you know the password?”
	</p><p>“I should, I’m a prefect, Professor McGonagall just didn’t have time to tell me,” Ginny replied, with a false air of importance. 
	</p><p>The Fat Lady narrowed her eyes at Ginny. “You’re that Weasley girl, aren’t you?” asked the Fat Lady. 
	</p><p>Ginny nodded, not sure where this was going. 
	</p><p>“Well, if you could answer some of these questions only the Weasley girl can answer, I’ll consider letting you in,” said the portrait. Ginny once again nodded, not sure what to say. Well, this could’ve went worse, I guess. 
	</p><p>“Let’s begin-” The Fat Lady said, until she was interrupted by a familiar voice.
	</p><p>“What are you doing, Miss. Weasley?” a firm, no-nonsense voice startled her. Ginny whipped her head around and saw Professor McGonagall standing behind her.
	</p><p>“Uh, um, Professor—” Ginny stuttered. Professor McGonagall raised her eyebrow.
	</p><p>“I presume that you don’t know the password?” asked Professor McGonagall.
</p><p>	“Um, yes. Sorry about that Professor. I just really wanted to unpack my things and go to bed, you know,” Ginny stammered. 
</p><p>	“Yes, yes, of course,” Professor McGonagall sighed. Up close, Ginny realised that she seemed rather tired. There were bags under her eyes and her posture wasn’t at all like usual. It looked like she was holding herself together, as if she had been hurt. 
</p><p>	A thought hit Ginny. A terrible one.
</p><p>	“Are you hurt, Professor?” asked Ginny timidly. 
</p><p>	Professor McGonagall shot a look at her, and immediately stood up straight, forcing away any expression on her face.
</p><p>	“No, I’m fine. Why do you ask, Miss. Weasley?” She said with thin lips. 
	</p><p>Ginny knew better than to lie straight to Professor McGonagall’s face.
	</p><p>“Well, it seemed as if you were hurt,” ventured Ginny.
	</p><p>“I thank you for your concern, but I am perfectly fine.’ Her tone implied that this would be the end of the discussion. “As you have asked, the password to the common room is “periculum”. Now move along Miss. Weasley, you don’t want to be caught around here at this time.” said Professor McGonagall. 
	</p><p>She left Ginny standing there, staring at the portrait. Ginny wondered why Professor McGonagall had said that: “you don’t want to be caught around here at this time.” 
	</p><p>Then she realised why. Ginny checked her watch (which her mother gave her years ago) and saw that it was 7:15. Fifteen minutes until curfew.
	</p><p>Ginny quickly spoke the password to the Fat Lady, and hurried in. Once she entered the common room, she felt, again, as if something was wrong. It was like the Great Hall. There was no warm feeling of home. 
	</p><p>There was no one in the common room, either. It slowly dawned on Ginny.
	</p><p><em>Snape</em>, Ginny raged, <em>he did this on purpose. He did this so he could get students in trouble.</em> 
</p><p>All the students still in the Great Hall had to know that curfew was soon. Very soon.</p>
