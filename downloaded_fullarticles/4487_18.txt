    <p>Maria Zabini was a cold woman. By pureblood standards her demeanour would be nigh on perfect. Though, were it not for Blaise’s father, she would never have been in with social circles of the Malfoys and the Blacks. And were it not for Blaise, she would still be.   </p><p>She had never wanted to be a mother. Blaise knew this because she told him so several times, voice filled with soft disdain when he asked her if she hated him. She could never had got rid of him, either. He was a pureblood, the heir of the House, and she would be nothing without him.    </p><p>Maria had once been beautiful - so she said, her soft soft hand trailing down his high cheekbone, lightly tracing his regal nose, stroking around his big hazel eyes and gripping his defined chin hard enough to bruise and with nails sharp enough to draw blood. Blaise believed her, then, and had never again asked what she looked like under her dark veil.    </p><p>From a young age, as far back as he could remember, Blaise had been terrified of Maria. Always Maria, never Mum or even Mother - and once he had said so to her, too. Her laughter was vicious and cold and had immediately brought tears to his eyes.    </p><p>Seeing his frightened little face, she had reached out and he had flinched. She didn't hurt him though, merely took him by the arm and led him to a room he had never been in before.   </p><p>There were several paintings, placed neatly in mere centimetre intervals, but he dared not take more than a passing glance at them. Instead, he looked straight ahead at a blank stretch of wall and hid his trembling hands behind his back.    </p><p>"You are free to look, Blaise," she said, voice devoid of malice but still held no warmth. Never for him. "Just mind you do not look too long. One could say there is... Madness upon these walls."    </p><p>Blaise hadn't wanted to look. It had sounded scary and he didn't want to look at more Madness. The dreams hadn't started back then. At least, not the ones that foretold the future.    </p><p>He did have one dream, though, a recurring one. This one was only of the present and only showed one scene: his father, of whom he was the spitting image, staring blankly with dead eyes though he lived. The only emotion he showed was when he screamed and screamed and screamed before falling silent once again, a statue carved of pain and sadness.    </p><p>And he knew it was real, too. For it was more memory than mere dream and though Blaise had only seen his father the once in the flesh, he visited him a thousand times afterward. It always hurt and it never stopped hurting as he wished it were Maria instead.</p><p>Maria hadn't let him say no. For she only had to touch his chin with a finger for him to obey.  And Blaise had looked, tears streaming down his face, desperately trying not to make a sound of his despair.    </p><p>The paintings were of him, all of them, as he was then. Barely six years old and already stoic and weary. He could tell, though, that they were not him. Not in any fabric of reality.</p><p>Face upon face of a happy Blaise had looked down on him. And as he looked, details came filling in. Blaise and his father, chatting by the warmth of a fire. Blaise and a little girl, a sister, laughing and playing. And - here Blaise choked out a sob - Blaise and a beautiful woman with a warm smile and even warmer eyes. Maria. But not as Maria. That woman had never been Maria to That Blaise; only ever Mum.    </p><p>Blaise remembered the way it had felt like a piece of him had broken, twisted away from him and rotted away into blood and ash. There had been whispers, soft fluttering words that grew that tiny bit louder each time he had strained his ears to listen. And he knew, though only later just how much, he would have gone Mad had he heard what the whispers were trying to say.</p><p>It was afterwards - when she had steered him out of the room, no doubt disappointed she could not get rid of him so easily, lest she wished to be destitute - that she had explained to him what she had shown him. And just what exactly she so viciously had stolen from him.    </p><p>"That, you horrible child, was a little something from my own family. Of course it’s meant to be impossible to use against one’s own kin. Perhaps simply blood connection is not enough?  Hmm… It worked rather marvellously, though, don't you say?"    </p><p>Questions had always had horrible consequences around Maria but at that moment Blaise felt nothing but morbid curiosity fuelled by anguish. "What was that room?"   </p><p>"That," Maria had whispered, leaning close enough for Blaise to see red lips through her veil.  "Has no name. For what name would ever befit it? Tell me, what did you see?"    </p><p>Empty as he had felt, Blaise could not conjure up the appropriate words. Maria had seemed not to care. She knew, already. She always knew him best, how to hurt him like no one else.     </p><p>"You saw something that will never, ever be. That which you wish with your entire soul could be." There she had stopped and taken a deep breath through her nose as though she smelt something heavenly. "And in its power is the very little fact that any of those desires would have been possible were you not yourself. Cruel little thing, you are. Destroying even your own desires."</p><p>She had left him then, content that she had destroyed him enough for that very moment.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p>   </p><p>When the dreams started a month later after that, Blaise had woken up with a scream, the first since nearly a thousand years it seemed, and the first of what would have been millions.</p><p>Only, Maria had been there soon, too soon to have been anywhere near sleep.    </p><p>She had said, "Happy Birthday" in the way she always did: sharp barbs coated with honey, coating his throat with guilt. Then her hand was once again gripping his chin and, though he could not see them, her eyes bored into his own.   </p><p>For the second time, it seemed, she asked him what he had seen. And for the first time, Blaise had firmed himself against his fear of her and lied.</p><p>“It was just a silly dream. I apologise for disturbing you.”</p><p>It was clear that Maria had been disappointed, once again, by his words but he could not find it in himself to care about that. He had been more concerned and confused about the pained green eyes peeking through the slits of a cupboard under the stairs.</p><p> </p>

  <em>1987</em>
</p><p><em> I keep having dreams about a boy. He’s my age (I think) because he wrote his age on a picture he drew. It wasn’t a very good picture but neither are Draco’s. I can colour in the lines and also my writing is marvellous. But I think the boy may be more </em> <em>like me than Draco. His Parents hate him just like mine do. I don’t think my dad hates me but that’s just because he doesn’t know me. I think if he did, he would hate me just like Maria does. The boy also has sad eyes but they’re green and mine are brown. I think I would have sad eyes too but I’m not allowed to cry anymore. I don’t mind it that much because crying hurts and Maria likes it when I hurt. Anyway, they’re just dreams, aren’t they? I’ve always been alone.</em></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> 1988 </em>
</p><p><em> I'm scared. When I sleep I see things. I never used to dream before and the ones I have are ugly and sad. I'm always feeling sad but it's like I'm someone else in the dreams. It doesn't feel like </em> me <em> but it always hurts too much to be someone else. Maria says I feel too much but I always thought it was a good thing. Isn't it better to not be cold all the time? I'm not like other seven year olds. I feel I'm much more clever and understand things other children, like Draco, wouldn't ever. But I still feel so much and lately it's almost too much. If it didn't irritate Maria so much I would cut off these feelings. </em></p><p>
  <em> It's not supposed to be like this, is it? I wonder if I could, just once, know what happiness felt like. Would my dreams stop me suffering to show me?</em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> 1989 </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’ve continued to dream of the sad eyed boy. At this point, I believe they may be real. I can’t explain how I believe this but, in a sense, it feels magical. I fear I may be cursed. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’ve dreamt of something happening with Draco and, afterwards, the very thing happened in real life. It had been an insignificant event but I don’t believe in coincidences. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’ve dreamt of a great many things, most of which are horrible, but mostly I dream of the boy. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Freak, they call him, but that’s not his name. His name is Harry. Right now he is sad and lonely (like me) but I have Seen what he becomes. He will be wonderful and great and kind and I wonder if we would be friends. The dreams don't show me what my future holds. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> He’s much smaller than I am even though I’m only five months older. But I don’t think that’s his fault. His relatives – and, as I’ve come to understand it, not his parents - are awful to him. They make him work in the garden all morning long and, afterwards, he’s to clean the rest of the house. And then they barely feed him a scrap of bread before locking him in a tiny cupboard under the stairs. He’s small enough to fit right now – but for how long? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I know he doesn’t die there with those muggles but I still worry for him. I try not to listen to what Maria says but I think she might be right about muggles. They’re really disgusting to treat a child like that – a magical one, no less. I’ve not yet seen much of their future but I hope it’s horrible.</em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> 1991 </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Harry really is magnificent. He spoke to a snake! And I don’t mean simply talking like one would to a pet but he truly spoke to the snake in a way that it understood. It really is strange how I could understand the meaning behind the hissing as though I were a parselmouth myself. I doubt that Harry understood the significance of it, nor did he seem to realise that he had performed magic afterward. I don’t know how he could not put together the fact that he is special. In every case of him performing accidental magic – and quite powerfully, at that – he never quite grasps that it stems from himself. For all that I think he is wonderful he really can be quite daft. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Once again, I do think those hideous muggles are responsible. I See what they’ve attempted to do – as if a beating were to render him a squib! The idea is appalling and, now that I’ve finally Seen what becomes of him, it sickens me that the whale has a few years in him left. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Seeing that lard of a cousin trapped behind the glass had been amusing but I do wish it hadn’t come at the expense of Harry’s health. He is strong but I sometimes wonder that his misery is just another way to punish me, as well. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I had, after all, never proven that Maria had not cursed me with this wretched Sight. Its hurts too much. </em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em>1991</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Today I saw Harry for the first time outside of the dreams. He really is tiny, even more so beside that half-breed, Hagrid. In any other case I might have been appalled at the sight of the oaf but I have Seen him and, surprisingly, he is a kind man. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I do find it somewhat suspicious that he was to escort Harry for the first time into the Wizarding World. He is, after all, only a Groundskeeper. And though he wields his illegal magic through that ridiculous umbrella of his, he is hardly qualified to protect Harry. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I have come to the realisation that my Harry is, in fact, the Harry Potter. The one to defeat the Dark Lord. This is astonishing to me if only for the fact that I have missed the obvious clues to this – lightning bolt scar! – and not because I believe Harry incapable. I know he is special but then I wonder if many others would pick up on this were it not for his fame. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Harry prefers not to be taken much notice of. I fear he may wilt under the pressuring eyes of the wizarding public. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> It’s times like these that I begin to doubt the truth of the future I’ve dreamt. Surely Harry is too soft to take on the danger I’ve seen him face?</em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Blaise awoke early, as he usually did, on the first of September. Although the lightened sky peeking through his curtains held an average hue, and the birds chattered as though it were any other day, he felt a faint excitement beginning to thrum through him.</p><p>His trunk was packed to his usual perfection and his plain black robes hung crisply upon the front of his wardrobe. Blaise eyed them, sparing a brief thought to what colour the lining would hold by the end of the day, before shaking it off and rising to get ready.</p><p>By the time he made it to the breakfast room, a golden light had filtered through the high arched windows, highlighting his favourite foods lined up along the glossy table. Blaise's stomach rumbled at the enticing scents wafting in his direction, then twisted sharply at the darkly veiled figure sat at the head of the table.</p><p>Even after years of being made to interact with Maria, although more rarely as of late, he couldn't help the bitter sting of fear she always managed to fill him with.</p><p>Despite this, his mask of indifference held firm through his practice, and he was able to seat himself with minimal discomfort. He voiced no greeting and none was forthcoming from Maria's end, either.</p><p>Maria did not always join him at mealtimes; he more often ate alone, with the occasional company of a house elf when he was younger and she didn't care enough to intercept it.</p><p>When she did it was almost always borne because she wished to be extra spiteful that day. It did not surprise Blaise that she felt that way today; he could already feel the tiny spark of happiness within him wither away.</p><p>Still, he ate, even as the taste barely made it through his numbed tastebuds and his stomach clenched almost painfully. He barely glanced up throughout the meal, almost able to convince himself that the regal woman was simply an icy shadow upon his fair autumn day.</p><p>The sharp edge of that darkness was very real, however, as he was reminded when he stood to take his leave as soon as he could.</p><p>“Sit,” the smooth tone halted him from standing fully and, clenched jaw halting his spontaneous need to defy, Blaise stared expectantly at the veiled woman.</p><p>“You leave today,” she said unexpectedly. Blaise hadn't thought she deigned to care but she wasn't done yet.</p><p>Generally, Maria was satisfied if he merely nodded along meekly but today the silence stretched on until Blaise managed a quiet, “Yes, Maria.”</p><p>His raspy voice had him licking his lip nervously and he cursed himself for his weakness. The rough sound was indicative of just how long he had gone without talking; he would have to remedy that before conversing with anyone on the train.</p><p>“I've waited a long time for this day,” said Maria, no inflection in her tone, not even the barbed iciness she reserved for reminding him how unwanted he was. “I expect you'll remain at Hogwarts come winter break. I'll be busy.”</p><p>Blaise ducked his head, despite his best efforts to remain unaffected. He was not saddened - he had not planned on returning if he could help it - but he still felt a deep anger in his chest, along with an irritating warmth of shame in his cheeks.</p><p>Maria would likely be ‘busy’ working her charms on her latest conquest through copious usage of glamour charms. Not that his being there would have made a difference - her constant reminders of, ‘You drove me to this,’ as she made off with the fortune of an unlucky man, made certain that he was nothing more than another reason for her spite.</p><p>“As you wish,” said Blaise, the words bitter but necessary. He couldn't wait to escape the stifled air of that room, that house, <em> her. </em></p><p>“It's a pity that they enforced that idiotic rule of no boarding during the summer,” she went on to say, still in that monotone even as she waved her hand airily.</p><p>“Indeed,” said Blaise, words following it up that he desperately wished he could stop, “I imagine we both might have benefitted were that not the case.”</p><p>Maria stilled and Blaise froze. The words in themselves were innocent enough, <em> polite </em> even, but it was the fact that he <em> said </em>those words that rankled Maria. In her eyes, he was nothing but a weak little boy, a burden that she sought to ruin as much as she could.</p><p>She was usually satisfied to see him meek under her barbs, and as minimally conversant as she wished him to be in any particular moment. Blaise couldn't always determine what her whims were to be at any time; but, more often than not, he was wrong in what he thought he should respond with.</p><p>It would have been enough to agree with her and leave it at that, but he had been, to her, <em> insolent. </em>He knew he had made a mistake as soon as he had felt the words coming, and the dangerous note to the ensuing silence doubled the rate of his heartbeat.</p><p>Before Blaise could utter a quick apology, a retraction, <em> anything, </em>Maria was in front of him. So close to her, he felt shrunken. He was considered tall for an eleven year old but she always served to remind how small he actually was.</p><p>For a handful of seconds, they were at a standstill, and then, strangely, she walked away without a single curse. Blaise breathed a sigh of relief and, beyond the painful lump in his throat, he felt fine. Which was suspicious, in itself.</p><p><em> Perhaps</em>, he thought, frowning, as he stood up and brushed himself off, <em> she had felt merciful on the day of his departure. </em></p><p>An elf was to escort him to the station, as there was no way his dear <em> mother </em>would take the time to do so. And Blaise would never have thought to have her, either.</p><p>Rocco, the ‘babysitter’ elf (which Blaise didn't <em> need </em> , he was <em> eleven </em>), stood in the front foyer, ready to apparate them to the station. No words were exchanged between them, beyond a respectful ‘Little Master’ from Rocco and a polite nod from Blaise.</p><p>If there had been, perhaps Blaise could have saved himself a lot of trouble.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>King’s Cross Station was full of frantic parents and excitable children, the crowds giving way to the gleaming scarlet train. Rocco had delivered him at the designated apparation spot, promptly disappearing again, after a quick farewell (on his part) and a mutter about chores. What a so called babysitter elf had to do when there were no longer any children around, Blaise had no idea.</p><p>It was just as well, Blaise thought, nervously eyeing the looks of concern and quiet pride upon many adults’ faces. It was bittersweet, stood there alone, a spectator on the outside of every pocket of family exchanging their goodbyes.  </p><p>The air of excitement still held true to being contagious, though, and Blaise had to bite the corner of his lip to suppress the giggle bursting to be let loose from his chest. With a pat to his pocket to make sure his shrunken trunk had not been forgotten, he set off to find himself a place to sit on the train. Aborted laughter aside, he couldn't help the slight upturn of lips and less than appropriate speed of his walk.</p><p>Considering the time was only just past the mark of nine, it was surprising the amount of compartments rapidly filling up. Even so, Blaise took his time strolling along the slightly dusty carpeted passageway, his head turning left and right as he took in the students already seated.</p><p>Blaise couldn't deny, not to himself at least, that he was hoping to come across a too small boy with scruffy hair and broken glasses. He didn't yet know whether he would say anything to him but just the thought of seeing him was enough to bring his giddiness back to full force.</p><p>His mind buzzed with thoughts, things he might have asked him, had he the courage; was Harry as excited to be going to Hogwarts as Blaise was? Was he as <em> afraid </em>? Did he, too, have the incessant fear that everyone would hate him as much as their families did?</p><p>Blaise wrinkled his nose - well, perhaps he wouldn't ask that last one. He <em> wanted </em> to, though. Harry was a big part of every Wizarding child’s world, none more so than Blaise's, he liked to think. Everyone would likely want to be his friend, but Blaise almost <em> needed </em> to be his friend.</p><p>At night, when he felt especially lonely, he would close his eyes and dream. They weren't always pleasant, but when he saw Harry he at least didn't feel so alone. He only wished Harry could feel that connection too.</p><p>As the twenty minute mark came and went, he felt that hope dwindle away. And so, he took the next empty compartment he saw and took it for himself. Still alone with his thoughts, he took the seat by the window, staring out at the families who had come later.</p><p>The congregation of people seemed larger, a big group of poorly dressed red haired children seeming to draw attention. Their loud chatter was audible even through the closed window, the woman who looked to be the mother the loudest of all. Blaise wondered what having such a big family was like. To have a mother who spoke stern warnings with that undertone of warmth… But no, he didn't have that; it was better to put it out of his head.</p><p>Just as Blaise settled down with the first book he could find, the door to his compartment slammed open. He jumped slightly at the unexpected noise, looking up and ready to deliver a cutting comment at the brute.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes; it was two brutes, stood behind a rather smaller boy, with a greater presence and a smirk to rival their size.</p><p>“Blaise,” said Draco, strolling in casually while his bodyguards, Crabbe and Goyle, did their jobs and guarded the door.</p><p>They weren't exactly friends, Blaise and Draco (and definitely not with those troll statues), but they had grown up together, somewhat. Being that their mothers had been friends before Maria’s… <em> exile, </em>they had seen quite a bit of each other. As such, they addressed each other by first name, regardless of the lack of familiarity behind the act.</p><p>“Draco,” Blaise tried to say, but the word got stuck in his throat. He frowned, tried again, with the same result. Draco had been too busy making himself comfortable on the seat opposite, with all the pomp of some king. Blaise wanted to mock him for that - it was just the two of them, who did he think he was impressing? - but the same block pushed his words down.</p><p>Draco then, finally, noticed his silence and raised an eyebrow. He liked to think it made him all distinguished like his <em> father </em>, but the befuddled quirk to his mouth ruined it.</p><p>“Kneazle got your tongue?” said Draco, then, slyly, “You're not nervous, are you?”</p><p>Blaise rolled his eyes. Of course he was nervous, and Draco wasn't fooling anybody with his nonchalant act. Blaise was probably less nervous than Draco pretended not to be; he, at least, knew a little about what to expect. And, Draco had more to worry about disappointing his parents.</p><p>When Blaise, once more, tried to respond, he began to get an idea about what was happening. He idly touched his throat. It had to be Maria's doing. He should have known she hadn't simply walked away this morning without some sort of triumph.</p><p>It was ridiculous. He almost wanted to laugh, but didn't want to see how well that turned out with no voice. Had she really…?</p><p>Looking at it closely, the real motive was obvious: Blaise’s humiliation. He dared to speak out of turn, and so she took his ability to talk. How long it would last, he wasn't sure. But probably enough to make it appear he was spurning whoever spoke to him.</p><p>He wasn't stupid. Her goal, as always, was to isolate him. Take away his chance to make connections outside of her twisted one. It was a miracle that Mrs Malfoy had managed to bring her son into contact with him at all.</p><p>But, this time, she had underestimated him. She had always cared about social circles more than he did. It did manage to annoy him, however.</p><p>Draco was now miming theatrically, his hands grasping at his throat. When still no reaction was garnered from Blaise, he fell against the back of his seat with a huff.</p><p>“Honestly,” said Draco, rolling his eyes. “You're just going to ignore me? The entire train ride? Am I supposed to talk to <em> those </em>two?”</p><p>He gestured to the two silent boys with a dismissive flick of his head. There was nothing for it, Blaise shrugged helplessly.</p><p>“Are you alright?” said Draco finally. The furrow between his fine blond brows suggested concern, but Blaise didn't know if he believed it. They weren't <em> friends. </em></p><p>Blaise eyed him, reconsidering, for the first time wondering: why <em> weren't </em>they? All points suggested that they should be, but there was a small voice at the back of his head that drowned that thought out.</p><p><em> He never noticed</em>, it said. <em> All those times at your house, and he never </em> noticed. <em> The way you flinched whenever Maria entered the room, the way he admired her veil and laughed at her finely structured insults towards you. He went on and on about his perfect parents while you remained silent and he </em>never noticed.</p><p>It was, perhaps, unfair. Draco was a self absorbed child, at the centre of his parents’ universe - but a child all the same. Would Blaise had taken note if he hadn't lived it, seen scenes similar from Harry's life? He didn't know.</p><p>And, all the same, would Blaise have wanted to? Did he want Draco to know?</p><p><em> No, </em> he realised. He didn't want anyone to know how <em> shameful </em>he was. Maria knew, he knew, and that was it.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Later, after a somewhat sullen portion of the trip, Draco suggested they go walking along the train.</p><p>Blaise had looked up from the chess game he had silently acquiesced to, narrowing his eyes at him.</p><p>He had a good idea as to why Draco had so casually decided he needed to stretch his legs. He had, in the times he wasn't pouting dejectedly when Blaise failed to respond, talked non stop about Harry Potter.</p><p>He had went on; one minute lamenting that Harry probably had the majority of their year already clamouring for his attention in some other compartment, the next ‘wondering’ (re: desperately hoping) if he would end up in Slytherin - ‘he <em> had </em>defeated the Dark Lord’.</p><p>It was a little annoying, more so since he couldn't tell Draco to shut up, he didn't <em> know </em>Harry.</p><p>He also really wanted to go with Draco, to maybe see Harry this time. But he couldn't. Draco was likely to run his mouth, brag about things that Harry had no interest in. He would rather stay away from that train wreck, especially if he wouldn't be able to caution Draco.</p><p>So, he shook his head, and watched Draco shrug and take off without him.</p><p>
  <span>Blaise shrugged back, even if it was mostly to himself, and turned to continue the chess match. As he debated whether to employ Draco’s advantageous moves against himself, he couldn't help the twinge of regret in his chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It doesn't matter</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he told himself, </span>
  <em>
    <span>he'd be seeing Harry for the next seven years. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a hollow thought. </span>
