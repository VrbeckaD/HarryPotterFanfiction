  <em>
    <span>Fuck. Fuck. Shit, fuck.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t watch another jumping, he couldn’t. The kid looked around his age and hadn’t even done anything, his only mistake was wearing that jacket in their part of town. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Reg, mate please, stop,” Sirius tried to pull his brother’s arm back but was a futile attempt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>                </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What, have you gone soft now, Black?” sneered his cousin Bellatrix. She smiled deviantly as Regulus landed a particular punch that made the kid’s nose start to bleed. Sirius winced at the sight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You deserve this, you little shit. Thinking you can walk in our territory,” Malfoy grinned as he kicked his stomach. Sirius couldn’t take it, he threw himself over the kid, preventing his gang’s tyrade. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Get out of the way, Sirius,” Regulus growled. Sirius stayed put holding his arms out defensively over the kid. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“You’ve done enough,” Sirius glared up at Regulus defensively. The two glared at each other for a moment before Regulus pulled back his fist and punched Sirius, hard. The boy staggered back, still glaring at his brother. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you, Reg,” </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Same to you, brother mine, or so you keep forgetting,” Regulus knew that Sirius hated being apart of their fucked up family, Sirius wanted nothing more than to kill his brother right then and there. He hated him and his parent more than anything, but had to stay with them due to being not of age. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Huh, where do you think you’re going, cunt,” Bellatrix snarled when the kid attempted to leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let him leave, how much more time do you need to waste beating up 16 years olds, Bella? Is it some sick fantasy of yours because Rodolphus refuses to fuck you?” Sirius added mockingly, Bellatrix leapt forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t think I won’t tell your little mumsy about this, Black. How does it feel to be that much of a disappointment?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As if I care what they think, they can-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sirius,” Regulus said warningly. Sirius gave one last glare before pushing away his brother and going to the kid. Before anyone else could do anything he hoisted him up and dragged him away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knew that they wouldn’t come after him now, it wasn’t worth it. Once he and the other boy were at a safe distance, he gently sat him on the floor and sat down in front of him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You alright?” Sirius asked. He pulled out a small kit from his bag and taking a small cloth, he began to wipe away the blood on his face. Christ, even after getting jumped, he was beautiful. He had curly brown hair that was hidden behind a dirt-covered beanie. His eyes were a golden brown and he had a splash of freckles dusted on his cheeks and nose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The fuck do you think you’re doing?” he snarled. Sirius was a bit taken back by the tone, considering he had prevented the kid being roughed up even further.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Um, saving your arse, do I even get a thank you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You saw my family, they’re shits”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid shrugged and tried to stand up, wincing at the pain in his back. “You can barely walk, let me help you, it’s the least I can do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“I, er- ok?” the kid limped over to Sirius. He looped an arm around his shoulders and hoisted the kid up so that he was leaning on Sirius. The kid relaxed a bit once the pressure was off his foot. He was a bit taller than Sirius, and smelled faintly of ink and tea. He wore a jean jacket with </span>
  <b>‘The Marauders’</b>
  <span> printed on the back, and a wool jumper underneath that, paired with trousers that were a bit short on him. Curly brown strands peaked out from a black beanie, that was now dirt covered and stepped on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My place is over this way,” Sirius began to walk with the kid in the direction he had pointed in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You got a name?” Sirius asked. He thought it was time for him to stop referring to him as ‘the kid’.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” he said, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m Sirius,” he responded, almost sticking out his free hand on impulse, but managed to hold back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, like the star?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” They remained quiet for the better part of the walk. With Remus’s directions they eventually reached a small house. There were two people on the porch, Sirius was thankful that it was dark and that they would most likely not be able to see his gang jacket from there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, for the help you know. I still don’t know why you did that though,” Remus said, stopping before they reached the gate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like I said, my family are shits, I can’t stand the way the hurt people as if it’s nothing. God knows they’ve hurt me enough,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Er, sorry about that, I shouldn’t have gone into your lot’s part of town anway,”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“No, trust me, they’re just that shitty,” Remus laughed and Sirius thought he liked that sound. He watched as Remus walked up to the porch and was greeted by the two other boys. Running a hand through his long black strands, Sirius turned and walked away.</span>
