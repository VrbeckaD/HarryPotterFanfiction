    <h1>Chapter 1 : The Boy Who Lived</h1>
<p>Albus Dumbledore was not a wizard who would normally be sad. In his opinion, there were very rare things that are worth being sad for. The death of James and Lily Potter was certainly one of them. That could be the reason why Albus looked so grave when his Deputy Headmistress appeared.</p>
<p>"Albus, is it true ?" Minerva asked.</p>
<p>"That, Minerva, depends on what you mean by <em>'it' </em>." said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Minerva could see there was not that twinkle he usually had in his eyes, and he didn't offer her a lemon drop the moment she arrived - putting these subtle signs together she could conclude herself that Dumbledore was indeed sad. She knew very well that he was a man who was untouched by things most of the people find sad, so if Albus is sad, what she heard must have been true. Still, she had a faint hope that it was false. Lily was one of her her favourite students ever and James, as troublesome as he was in school days, had grown up to be a responsible and good man. They shouldn't have died.</p>
<p>"You know what I'm talking about Albus, " Minerva sobbed. "James and Lily - people say You-Know-Who killed them both - is it true ?"</p>
<p>"I wish I could say it isn't Minerva, but then I would be lying." Perhaps 'Yes it is' was too simple reply for the mind of the wise old Headmaster, so he gave a winded answer.</p>
<p>"And what about their child ?" Minerva inquired.</p>
<p>"Harry survived, Minerva. I've sent Hagrid to fetch him. We'll send him to live with his relatives. Lily's sister lives somewhere in Surrey." Dumbledore replied.</p>
<p>"But why with muggles ? He has his godfather Sirius Black. Did they get him too ?"</p>
<p>"Sirius is alive, Minerva. But the whole world knows he was the Potter family's Secret Keeper. He betrayed them and sold them out to Voldemort."</p>
<p>"But you said that at the last moment they switched from Sirius to Peter. And I'm sure Sirius would never betray James. Either of them would die rather than betray the other."</p>
<p>"But the whole world thinks Sirius was the Secret Keeper. And that he killed Peter when he confronted him, along with 12 muggles who were in the surrounding."</p>
<p>"What ?" Minerva couldn't believe. "Sirius would never kill anyone innocent. I know him much better than you do, Albus. And since Peter was the Secret Keeper and surely he betrayed the Potters, it is possible that he was a Death Eater. He could have killed those muggles."</p>
<p>"There is no evidence, Minerva."</p>
<p>"You liar, Dumbledore. You have evidence but you don't want to reveal them. How could you let an innocent man be sent to Azkaban for crimes he hasn't committed. His best friends, who meant the world to him, were killed - and their son, his godson was attacked with the same intention. Sirius is a victim, Albus. You don't care ?"</p>
<p>"Minerva, if Sirius was a responsible person, he should have chosen to take Harry to safety rather than running after Peter. He won't be a good guardian to Harry. Harry will be in constant danger every moment. How can Sirius keep him safe if he cannot control his emotions and tempers?"</p>
<p>"ALBUS DUMBLEDORE ! DON'T YOU TELL ME THAT THOSE DAMN MUGGLES WILL KEEP HARRY SAFER THAN SIRIUS BLACK." Minerva roared. "And Potters' Will clearly mentioned that if anything happened to them, custody of Harry would go to Sirius, Remus, Longbottoms, Bones and Weasleys in that order, and also <em>specifically </em>said that in no circumstances should Harry's custody be given to Lily's sister and her husband."</p>
<p>
  <strong>This is quickly getting out of hand. But I am Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the conqueror of Grindelwald, and the wisest Headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen. I have to deal with this another way. After all, when does the ability to perform wandless nonverbal memory charm come useful if not in such situations ?</strong>
</p>
<p>"You were saying something, Minerva ?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes Albus. It's really heartbreaking that James and Lily were betrayed by <em>Sirius Black</em>. They trusted him enough to make him their Secret Keeper. James and Sirius were almost like brothers. It's so hard to trust people these days."</p>
<p>"It's sad indeed Minerva. I guess war does that even to good people."</p>
<p>"It is a little odd though that James and Lily didn't write a Will, given that they were hunted directly by You-Know-Who."</p>
<p>"I don't blame them, Minerva," sighed Dumbledore. "21 is an age when people write Wedding Vows, not Wills."</p>
<p>"You're right."</p>
<p>
  <strong>Huh, that was quite close. I should be very careful around Minerva.</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    ………. xxxxx ………….. xxxxx …………… xxxxx ……………</p>
<p>Hagrid came with the boy. Dumbledore examined the boy. He had a lightening shaped scar on his forehead. Voldemort's Killing Curse didn't kill the boy but left a physical mark, and Voldemort vanished. There was something going on. Dumbledore was not sure what, but he had a theory, a guess. And Dumbledore was good at making guesses.</p>
<p>"Hagrid, you understand what to do, right ?"</p>
<p>"Yes Professor."</p>
<p>"Good. Now you may leave with the boy. I'll apparate to the location in proper time of your arrival."</p>
<p>"As you say, Professor." Hagrid obliged obediently.</p>
<p>Hagrid started the flying motorbike, which belonged to the innocent man who was being sent to Azkaban despite Dumbledore, the Chief Warlock of Wizengamot, having the evidence of his innocence. In the motorbike, Hagrid was taking the godson of the said innocent man to the place where his parents had specifically forbidden him to be given to in case something happened to them. Poor Hagrid had no knowledge of the truth behind the deaths of James and Lily, two people whom he loved so much.</p>
<p>When Dumbledore reached Privet Drive, Minerva was already there in her Animagus form.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Why is Minerva here ? Did she know I was coming here ? I should have asked that stupid blabbering giant not to tell anyone. When will he ever learn to keep his mouth shut ? Ok, I'll have to act normal. Deep breath --</strong>
</p>
<p>"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p>Minerva came back to her human form. "How did you know it was me ?"</p>
<p>"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."</p>
<p>"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here."</p>
<p>"Yes, I noticed the celebrations too. You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news. I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."</p>
<p>"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years."</p>
<p>"You-Know-Who is really gone, Dumbledore ?"</p>
<p>
  <strong>Should I tell the truth ? I guess not. People do not need to worry before it's time.</strong>
</p>
<p>"It does seem so."</p>
<p>"You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?"  It was plain that whatever 'everyone' was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was searching his pockets for another lemon drop and did not answer.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. "They're saying after he killed James and Lily, he tried to kill their son, Harry. But -- he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded glumly.</p>
<p>"It's -- it's true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?"</p>
<p>"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know."</p>
<p>
  <strong>And I'm not telling anyone my guess. Or the exact truth, which I'm sure I will soon discover.</strong>
</p>
<p>"Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?"</p>
<p>"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now."</p>
<p>"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. "Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!"</p>
<p>"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter."</p>
<p>"A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name ! And you know what they are starting to call Harry ? 'The Boy Who Lived' ! "</p>
<p>
  <strong>'The Boy Who Lived' ! Well, it's catchy, and it's much shorter and easier than 'The Boy Who Probably Got Special Powers From Voldemort And Might Even Be The Container Of One Of His Horcruxes'. And it also doesn't reveal that Harry probably got special powers from Voldemort and might even be the container of one of his horcruxes. Merlin! How come these ordinary witches and wizards think of a better nickname for the boy than I, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the conqueror of Grindelwald, and the wisest Headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen ?</strong>
</p>
<p>"Exactly, " said Dumbledore. "Being famous as a kid would only spoil him. That's why it is better for him to live here, growing up without knowing any of it until he is ready to take it."</p>
<p>Hagrid came with the boy in the flying motorbike, and Dumbledore placed him at Dursley's doorsteps with a note folded in his hands. As Hagrid returned in the same motorbike, Dumbledore and McGonagall apparated to Leaky Cauldron. It was filled with people who had come from all over the country, they all were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived !"</p>
