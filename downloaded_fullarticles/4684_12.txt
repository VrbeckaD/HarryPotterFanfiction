    <p>Sirius Black had been staring at a particular corner of the Gryffindor commons room for over an hour now.</p>
<p>"Hey Moony?" Sirius asked suddenly.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Is this real?" Sirius was still staring at that corner, eyes unfocused.</p>
<p>Remus set his book down. "Is what real?" he asked slowly, not quite understanding.</p>
<p>Sirius gestured to the room widely with a sweeping motion of his hand. "This."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is real. This is real, Sirius."</p>
<p>"Promise?"</p>
<p>"I promise."</p>
<p>Sirius took a shuddering breath in, out. "Okay. Can I- can I hold your hand? Feeling that might help. You don't- you don't have to, but..." Sirius trailed off once Remus grabbed his hand.</p>
<p>"Warm, flesh and blood, totally real hand right here," Remus promised.</p>
<p>Sirius' grip tightened on Remus' hand like a lifeline. "Thanks," he muttered.</p>
<p>"Anytime."</p>
