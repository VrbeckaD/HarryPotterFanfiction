    <p>Steve was a half-blood, that’s what they called you if you were half-and-half, like milk. That’s how he thought of it, anyway. He was lucky, his mother was a pureblood, and that in itself had pulled him out of the muggleborn purge, he wasn’t one of those targeted back then. Very lucky indeed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Still, it seemed, with the majority of kids going to Hogwarts pureblood (the students numbers were down dramatically), those few half-blood, or Merlin-forbid, muggleborn, even </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> got strange looks. In Madam Malkin’s with his mother, because Twilfitt and Tattings was far too expensive, a boy with red sunglasses blindly banged into him, and his huge father huffed something about ‘blood traitors’. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That was what they called his ma. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She was a ‘blood traitor’ to them, those purebloods, she’d married a man with not a drop of magic blood in his veins, and a boy. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He didn’t mind all that much, the boy’d apologised for his father’s words and Steve had supposed most people weren’t like that big man. Besides that, he thought hopefully about Hogwarts and wondered how many others there were like him. Not many, according to his ma, but he refused to think of it like that. Surely there’d be </span>
  <em>
    <span>some</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the Black Order hadn’t killed all of them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There were definitely some, he was sure of it, thinking of the boy with the long hair and the wide-eyes and his three chattery sisters, they had to be muggles. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Nobody else stared at flying pumpkins with that much awe.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Carol Danvers didn’t like the eyes that followed her everywhere she went. It even made her thankful that her parents banned her from leaving the house, because at least inside the Minister of Magic’s extraordinarily large mansion, nobody stared. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Of course, it was understandable. She’d killed one of the most powerful wizards in magical history on her fifth birthday, very nearly six years ago, but all the same, she definitely hadn’t done it on purpose. Her parents had been killed and she, then a very screamy, angry toddler, had let out an explosion of rage and magic that’d destroyed the Mad Titan in a few seconds. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>In Diagon Alley ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>the Savior</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ followed her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They all whispered, wide-eyed, about the golden-haired little girl and her fearsome powers, though (she heard them say it) most thought she was a bit short to be a Savior. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That was the name that her father (he wasn’t really, but she’d grown to call him that) had given her the day he’d adopted her, though frankly, she wasn’t sure how much she liked it. She didn’t like the idea of being their hero, the saving grace for all muggleborns. Technically, she was a half-blood, and as much as she heard ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>savior’</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she heard other words too. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Words like slurs, nasty words, words that stuck in her head in the car back to the mansions, words that made her feel like a monster, guilt-ridden and ugly.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The angry girl in the robe shop who argued with her blonde sister kept staring at her as her butler paid, but in her pale green eyes there wasn’t any judgement, just curiosity. Carol reckoned she didn’t know </span>
  <em>
    <span>who</span>
  </em>
  <span> she was, or else she’d be whispering or pointing. The girl was dressed messily, her shirt covered in holes and her jeans all torn up at the knees, and she didn’t look like she belonged in Twilfitt and Tattings.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>All the same, she stared back at the girl with a brow raised, before leaving behind her butler and smoothing out her skirt as she passed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Jessica Jones had tripped over her shoes plenty, the word ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>blood traitor’</span>
  </em>
  <span> following her all around Diagon Alley. She was an orphan, her parents and brother had died last year following a long-chased hunt from the Mad Titan’s favourite killer, Zebediah Killgrave. His face still followed her wherever she went, asleep, awake, it didn’t matter. He was always, </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span> there. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Jones family were pureblood, or they had been before they’d been wiped out, and she was the last of them, uncomfortable at the attention gained. People knew who she was because her parents had been blood traitors, or at least, they’d been nice to everyone, and that’d gotten them killed. Something about their death stung more than anything else, they’d never done anything wrong. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She hated the word </span>
  <em>
    <span>traitor</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It made them sound as though they’d gone against something, some ancient law, and they’d done nothing. It made her sound as though she’d done something. She’d done shit all.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The family that’d adopted her weren’t really nice and she didn’t like them much, but they were rich, and she stood in Twilfitt and Tattings with Trish, who’d insisted on getting herself new robes for her second year at Hogwarts, whilst she was being fitted for her own first-year robes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Trish’s robes had the pretty embroidery of the Slytherin house all along their cuffs and linings and she stared enviously at the nice patterns before staring at herself in the mirror. Skinny and pale, she looked miserable in the oversized robes, avoiding the fitting lady’s clumsy pins stabbing into her skin. She looked stupid.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Across the robes shop, a small girl with wavy golden-blonde hair stood whilst her suited guardian payed for a heap-and-a-half of robes, and she stared directly at Jessica. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Jessica stared back, scrutinising the girl. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Maybe she was a blood traitor after all, but her parents had taught her to </span>
  <em>
    <span>never</span>
  </em>
  <span> judge anyone as anything other than human unless proven otherwise. </span>

<p>
  <span>Bucky Barnes chewed on his lip and wondered why people kept hissing ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>mudblood</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ as he passed. He and his ma and his sisters were out on a mission in Diagon Alley, trying to tick off everything on the list of requirements with wide eyes. His ma carried a look of mild bemusement with her wherever she went, and now, staring at the array of owls and cats (“No.”) she frowned. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Eyes seemed to follow him coldly. He didn’t have a single clue what ‘mudblood’ meant but it didn’t seem nice and he found himself ignoring their stares and hoping they’d just go away, because it stung.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It stung even though he didn’t know what it meant, and in his mind that meant this word was far more unpleasant than he knew; the fact that it brought a cold shiver down his spine told him so. It was a bad word.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He hoped they wouldn’t say it at Hogwarts, because then maybe the bad feeling that came with it would go away, he wasn’t sure anyone wanted to be a </span>
  <em>
    <span>mudblood</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Besides, maybe they’d have flying pumpkins at this school of magic. </span>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Natasha Romanoff grew up around people telling her ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>mudbloods</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ were below her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She was a Romanoff, she was a pureblood, she was everything they were not and they could </span>
  <em>
    <span>never </span>
  </em>
  <span>be anything like her. Her elder sister Melina took to that easily, </span>
  <em>
    <span>of course</span>
  </em>
  <span> Melina would because she was the perfect Romanoff child. Her younger sister, Yelena, less so, she was still as sharp and sometimes cold as her elders, but she was more trusting, genuine, she didn’t understand why she couldn’t make friends with the muggle boy on their street. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Unsurprisingly, Natasha did. She didn’t like it, would much rather be better, be happier, but it seemed her father insisted on this social hierarchy, and so she’d made friends with the muggle boy on their street in secret. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Her and Yelena both liked Clint, he was funny and loud and sort-of stupid but in a nice way, and they both </span>
  <em>
    <span>liked</span>
  </em>
  <span> him. He was going to Hogwarts this year too and she wondered whether she’d see him, ignoring her younger sister’s petulant whines. Yelena wanted to go to Hogwarts </span>
  <em>
    <span>with all her heart, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and Natasha had no doubt she’d be in Hufflepuff for all her wide-eyed kindness and aggressive loyalty. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She didn’t know where she fit. What if it was Slytherin? What if she went to the bad house where all the bad people went? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Melina was in Ravenclaw, but she was sure her older sister’d only gotten there because she’d tricked the hat or something, she wasn’t sure she could do that. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She hoped she wasn’t going to end up like her father.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Muggles weren’t even that bad, even Clint when he farted, they were nice, his mother always invited her and Yelena over for tea, so where Melina lacked in that compassion, Natasha reckoned they both had it in the bag. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She only hoped the hat saw that.</span>

<p> </p>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Platform 9 and ¾ was </span>
  <em>
    <span>full</span>
  </em>
  <span> of students, and families. Though there weren’t more than two hundred and fifty students attending this year (his ma had found the numbers through a friend from the ministry), it still seemed full, and Steve gawped around with his eyes so wide. He was absorbed in all the noise, the magical life, it was so extraordinary. There were even whispers of the ‘Savior’, though he was surprised that a girl like that would be attending Hogwarts given the fact she was one of the most famous witches ever. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He noted all the different kinds of students on the station, three sisters, the youngest of which was sulking as the two older girls (one dark-haired and the other redheaded) stepped onto the train, the pumpkin-boy from Diagon Alley detaching himself from three young sisters, a skinny girl who was glaring miserably around, and a girl with golden hair and wide brown eyes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They were all magic, that fact alone blew his mind.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The train was already filling up as he clambered on, and after a few moments of wandering down the stuffed carriages, he found a relatively empty compartment. The person sat in it was a tall-looking boy (he wasn’t sure because he was sat down) with dark skin and dark hair, who looked up when he slid the glass door open. His t-shirt had a superhero on it, a guy with a shield jumping in the air. </span>
  <span><br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello. Can I sit here? Everywhere else is full.” Steve sounded rather awkward, and stared at his sneakers. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The boy nodded, grinning. “Sure.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He then noticed the way, it seemed, the compartment was cleared, all stuff moved around as though there were more people to come. “Are you waiting for someone else? I can go, if-”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Shaking his head, the boy gestured. “My friend is coming, but it’s fine, there’s enough room.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Your friend?” Steve’s arms shook under the weight of his trunk as he yanked it into the compartment, and smiled gratefully when the boy helped him lift it onto the rack. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She’s bringing her friend I haven’t met, but my friend Sharon’s coming. Her aunt is a really cool witch, Peggy Carter.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No way-”</span>
  <span><br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah way! She’s super cool and Sharon’s really cool too.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Whoa.” Steve’d heard of Peggy Carter, the first female auror, one of the best defensive witches in the world, and just generally, pretty awesome, and he’d never realised she’d have relatives at Hogwarts. “I can’t believe you’re friends with a Carter...that’s so cool.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Me neither. ‘M Sam Wilson, you?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Steve Rogers.” He took the boy’s hand and they shook, before both plunked down on the opposite seats. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Nice to meet you, Steve.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You too.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And that was how Steve and Sam became friends, something they’d stay for years.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sharon came bustling in just as the train set off, and she brought two others with her, the redheaded girl from the station and a boy with sandy-blonde hair who tripped over his own feet and fell into Steve’s lap. He was an ‘extra’, as Sam called him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hullo. I’m Clint.” He’d mumbled, standing up. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The redheaded girl was called Natasha, she was a pureblood, and her older sister Melina was the Ravenclaw prefect, the taller one with the dark hair, but she was small and pretty. So was Sharon, but in a different way, blonde and sort-of nice to look at. Clint was loud and crude and silly and he made sparks explode from his wand to make them all laugh.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Steve found himself crammed between the blonde boy and the redheaded girl, Sharon and Sam sat opposite them, and he found himself laughing, fascinated by almost everything they said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Natasha was from one of the most ancient magical families, she had a little sister called Yelena who ‘totally had a crush on Clint’ (according to Clint himself), and she was very smart. Clint was a muggleborn who had a large amount of knowledge on Hogwarts due to Natasha, and he was funny, and he’d managed to wrangle a dog to the school on account of the fact that he was deaf. Sharon was an only child and she liked reading and wrestling and she was very, </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> ambitious. Sam was amicable and kind, and he liked birds. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t want to be in </span>
  <em>
    <span>Melina’s house</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Natasha said, on the topic of houses. “She’s annoying and I don’t want to have to spend anymore time with her than I already do.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Clint laughed loudly. “She’s very mean.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sharon turned to Steve. “Once, she called Clint a ‘fat little hobbit boy’ because he was playing tag with Yelena.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He found himself laughing, then turned to the blonde boy. “You’re not fat.” He said it earnestly, and Natasha roared with laughter. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The blonde girl grinned. “Thank you, Steve.” Looking around the rest of the group, he continued. “Y’know, I think we should make Steve a permanent member of our group.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sam scoffed. “Scuse me, but I hope you know he was here before you!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“By like ten minutes!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I want to be a Gryffindor.” Sharon interrupted the blossoming argument with stars in her eyes. “Like my aunt.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Of course she would, anyone would want to be in the same house as Peggy Carter. That just seemed logical, for you’d want to be like one of the wizarding world’s biggest heroes if you could. Steve did too.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who’s your aunt?” Clint leaned over Steve like a lazy dog, and grinned at them, his own dog, Lucky, asleep on Natasha’s lap. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There was a long discussion about Peggy Carter mainly led by Natasha and Sharon, the pair of them grinning as they explained her long list of heroics and why she was so important to the wizarding community and especially witches, even if the Minister of Magic had tried to send her away twice, and Steve was sure Clint’s little brain was blown. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So she fought off a dragon without her wand?” He exclaimed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sharon nodded. “She tamed it!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Whoa.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What about you, Steve? What house do you want to be in?” Natasha asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He thought about it, then shrugged. “Don’t mind...so long as there’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone</span>
  </em>
  <span> else I know.” They all nodded at that, some lost sense of comradery. It was a most likely chance that they’d be spread across the houses between the five of them, so he probably wouldn’t be with any of them, which kind-of sucked, but as Sharon would remind him, ‘we all share classes’ anyway. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sharon kicked the three boys from the compartment for about ten minutes when she and Natasha changed into their uniform, and they stood outside in the corridor. Looking down, there were other boys in a similar position, pumpkin boy from Diagon Alley was stood alone, waiting for whoever was in his, down the other way there were another three boys, the boy with the red glasses whose father had spat at him and two friends. One of the boy’s friends elbowed him and the boy waved in their direction, Steve waved back. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You know Matt Murdock?” Sam hissed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who’s Matt Murdock?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“The blind kid you’re waving at.” The taller boy shook his head. Behind them, Clint was staring out of the window with his mouth open absently. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s blind? How’d he know I was there?” Steve gawped, wondering about all the different magical ways they could possibly fix eyesight, it was something his ma always talked about but he wasn’t sure it existed. He stared down at the blind boy with wide-eyes, the boy was laughing quietly and chattering with his two friends, a tall boy with dark skin and short hair, and a small blonde boy with curls and a very loud voice.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“His friend told him.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh. His dad called me a ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>blood traitor’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>in Madam Malkins.” He frowned. “He said sorry for his dad.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sam nodded. “I like Matt. He’s nice.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After finally zoning into the conversation, Clint turned and blinked between them. “What’s a ‘blood traitor’?” He asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s someone who’s pureblood who either aligns themselves with or sympathises with muggles. My ma’s pureblood but she married a muggle man, so I’m a half-blood. They called my ma one because she’s done activism or something.” Steve tried his best to explain, and the blonde boy blinked between them some more. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s a bit mean. On her, I mean.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah it is.” He agreed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sharon stuck her head out of the compartment door and nodded to the three of them. “You can get changed now, me and Nat are done.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Look! I got a Peggy card!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Natasha waved her chocolate frog card around at them all and they all took turns staring at the little photo. Steve grinned down at it, watching the little tiny photo of Peggy Carter wave up at him. She saluted and laughed and when Clint, awestruck by the moving character, screeched at the top of his lungs. “IT’S MOVING! NATASHA, YOU NEVER TOLD ME THEY MOVE!” He flailed his limbs and dropped the card, shrieking some more. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Steve was near tears, wheezing between the pair of them as they yelled at each other, and Sam shook his head, offering him a chocolate frog whilst Sharon wiped tears away. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He peeled the package back and devoured the chocolate in one go, before peering down at the card. On it, there was a young girl with golden hair and wide-brown eyes, who stared sadly up at him. The title below read </span>
  <em>
    <span>Carol Danvers</span>
  </em>
  <span> and he realised all too soon that </span>
  <em>
    <span>she</span>
  </em>
  <span> was the same girl he’d seen on the station.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Whoa! I didn’t know she had her own card.” Natasha, freed from her wrestling match with Clint, was leaning over his shoulder. </span>
  <span><br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Isn’t she the youngest person to </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> get one?” Sharon asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Clint stared at the card in confusion. “She looks sad.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You would if you’d seen your parents be murdered in front of you. I don’t think the Minister lets her out of his sight, y’know, I’d be sad if I’d been stuck inside </span>
  <em>
    <span>forever.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” The blonde boy looked startled at Sam’s (rather harsh)  words, still staring at the sad girl on the card.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What did she do?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She killed the Mad Titan.” The words hung over them solemnly, and Steve tucked the card into his robe pocket, wondering whether Carol Danvers would mind seeing her face everywhere she went.</span>

<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Trying to get a boat across the lake together proved difficult, with there being only four seats on each one and five of them, so Steve found himself pointing Clint to one of the boats whilst the other three settled on another with the pumpkin boy (who was staring around in wide-eyed awe at </span>
  <em>
    <span>literally everything</span>
  </em>
  <span>). Their boat already had two girls in it, one of whom he vaguely recognised from something or other, who looked vaguely sullen and miserable, and the other one was the girl on his chocolate frog card.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re Carol Danvers!” He exclaimed, plonking down opposite the girl. She looked as though she’d already heard this a million times and he flushed, staring down at his sneakers. “Sorry, I just-”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“It’s fine.” The girl said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She was on the smaller side, with hair literally gold in the light from Hogwarts’ glowing windows, and her eyes were dark and brown, sad-looking. The card </span>
  <em>
    <span>definitely</span>
  </em>
  <span> matched. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Her friend stuck out a thin hand. “I’m Jessica Jones.” Her other arm was in a cast graffitied all-over, and he spied a neat signature courtesy of the Saviour on the top, wondering whether they’d just met or they already knew each other as he introduced himself.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Steve Rogers.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Clint Barton.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There was a mumble-jumble of hand-shaking that resulted in the boat rocking and a low giggle issuing from them as the sandy-haired boy nearly toppled overboard. “Steve’s got a chocolate frog-thingy with you on it!” He said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t know I had a card.” Carol blinked down and Steve produced it. “I look very sad, don’t I?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They all laughed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Caught up in all the laughter, Steve nearly missed out upon the beauty of the lake. It was a huge stretch of black water, something moving deep in its depths, and the lights of golds, reds and fires from the school made it look like a night sky. His eyes widened as he looked from the huge craggy building to the strange water, it was extraordinary. He’d never seen anything like it. The small swarm of boats (there were only six or so) seemed insignificant against the spread.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Across the water, the other boats drifted this way and that, and he spotted the others some distance away. Natasha and Sharon were screeching, elbowing each other and ignoring the douses of water from the two boys, Sam, and pumpkin boy. The other boy seemed to be getting on well, and Steve wondered who he was.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m a pureblood.” Jessica was saying, though she didn’t seem proud of it. “But my parents were ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>blood traitors</span>
  </em>
  <span>’, so it doesn’t matter anyway. The others think I’m as bad as muggles-or the way they view muggles anyway.” Though she didn’t seem to mean any harm, Clint frowned at his shoes. “Not that there’s anything wrong with muggles, anyway, they’re fine!” She added hastily. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“One of the girls in Diagon Alley called me a ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>mudblood’.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> the sandy haired-boy mumbled.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was the first time he’d seen Clint anything other than joyous, and awkwardly, offered him a pat on the back. “That’s just a mean word. It doesn’t mean anything other than a nasty way of saying muggle.” Then, Steve turned to Jessica. “My ma gets called a ‘blood traitor’ all the time.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>For some reason, Jessica and Clint got on quite well, guffawing over something he didn’t catch, and he watched the world for a few seconds before realising that Carol was doing most of the arm-work with the rowing, and he guiltily joined in, to which she grinned gratefully.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The stars in the sky hung over them like a strange blanket as they entered Hogwarts, and Steve was busy staring at all the fancy gargoyles frowning down at him with their tongues out when he walked crash-bang into another boy. “Oh-sorry!” He blurted, stepping back. Mcgonagall paused in her speech, before turning a blind eye and carrying on, gesturing grandly around.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You better be, freak.” The boy spat, before turning away and stalking off. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“That was lucky.” Before Steve could so much as respond, Natasha was at his heel, watching the boy hiss between his friends. “That’s Brock Rumlow, his father’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> horrible. Sharon said her aunt fought him back when the Mad Titan was alive, I’m surprised they’ve even let him come to Hogwarts.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh.” He blinked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It seemed to Steve as though he was starting to realise he didn’t know </span>
  <em>
    <span>half</span>
  </em>
  <span> as much about Hogwarts than he’d thought, everyone else knew everybody. At least he’d sort-of made some friends, he supposed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The redheaded girl shrugged. “You won’t be in the same house as him, so you needn’t worry anyway.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ahead of them, the Transfigurations professor had finished, and the small lump of first years followed her up the stairs and into the Great Hall. He understood entirely why they called it the ‘Great Hall’, for he was stood with his mouth wide open, gawping at all the bright lights. The student numbers were depleted anyway, but he stared around at them all. All four tables seated about forty to fifty children, wearing the greys and blacks of the uniform peppered with stripes of the house colours. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Headmaster, a man named Thaddeus Ross, made a great big long speech about magic and the safety of students, on and on, and Steve zoned out, snickering at Clint. The short boy had unhooked his hearing aids and was stood, staring at a pretty Ravenclaw girl dreamily. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Then, all haziness was cut off by the first name on the rather short list of first years being read out by Mcgonagall.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“BARNES, JAMES!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was pumpkin boy (at least Steve had a name for him now), who stumped over nervously with wide eyes, then plunked down on the three-legged-stool. The hat, animated and jovial, fascinated him, and he watched as it slipped over the boy’s head and he was decreed a “HUFFLEPUFF!”. The yellow and gold house cheered for him and he grinned and sat amongst them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“BARTON, CLINTON!” Clint, still without his hearing aids, was staring at the Ravenclaw girl, and Steve elbowed him in the side. He jumped, tripped over his feet to raucous giggles from the other students, and was on the stool for all of ten seconds before he joined James Barnes at the Hufflepuff table. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Beside him, Natasha grinned. “I knew he’d end up there.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She looked proud.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“BRUNHILDE, VALKYRIE!” was set in Ravenclaw and grinned at nobody in particular, running a hand through her long curly hair.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Then, Sharon was called up and she sat, straight-backed and smiling. Across the hall, people were whispering, and he didn’t blame them, her aunt was </span>
  <em>
    <span>really cool</span>
  </em>
  <span>. After a moment’s contemplation, she was the first “GRYFFINDOR!” of the sorting, and their cheers were thrice as loud and boisterous as the Hufflepuff’s table. He even heard someone cheer ‘We got Carter!’ and laughed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There was a moment of silence, collection, then “DANVERS, CAROL!” was called up. The silence turned from a normal one to a low, hissing whisper, and it filled Steve with a nervous sort-of dread. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Carol made her way up to the stool with her head hung low, hair turned like glowing fire in the candlelight, and she stared at her shoes as she sat down. Mcgonagall plunked the hat onto her head and it mumbled, loudly, words caught on the air. “Brave”, “brash”, “impulsive”, “loyal”, all different things but all good ones. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He wondered why people stared at her so, and it seemed as though her sorting lasted forever. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“A hatstall!” Natasha whispered. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Someone who spends more than five minutes waiting to be sorted.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh.”</span>
  <span><br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It’d definitely been more than five minutes, probably ten, by the time the hat finally made its decision. “GRYFFINDOR!” She seemed relieved, and made her way to the red and gold table. If they’d been happy about Sharon, they were over the bloody moon about getting Carol Danvers. A small chant of “</span>
  <em>
    <span>saviour, saviour, saviour!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> was echoing around the hall until the next name was called up. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“JONES, JESSICA!” The thin girl made her way up to the stool from the back of the crowd of first years, and Steve watched as she slumped down, pale eyes wide and afraid. He wasn’t sure how someone so fragile in appearance could look so fearsome, but even afraid, her arm in a cast and her eyes downcast, she looked scary.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Though she didn’t take as long as Carol, she was still sat there for a few minutes before; “Oh, yes, I see where you belong, Jones, you’re a RAVENCLAW!” and she grinned half-heartedly, making her way over to all the blue and silvers clapping politely. People knew her, someone hissed </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘blood traitor</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ over at the Slytherin table.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A few people he didn’t know went to various houses, and eventually, another name he recognised was called up. “MURDOCK, MATTHEW!” found his way up with his stick, and sat with his hands crossed on his lap as the hat fell over his eyes and red glasses. “Brash, cunning, maybe a little bit of ambition in you, boy, you could go anywhere...but, no, you’re a SLYTHERIN!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The snake house all clapped, a few whistles, and Steve couldn’t help but notice the rather downcast expression on Matt’s face as he sat amongst them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His friend, Daniel Rand, went to Gryffindor and sat opposite Carol, and then he realised it was his turn. “ROGERS, STEVE!” boomed out across the hall and he worried his way through the thinning group of first years, shaking in his boots. The hat, like it’d been for Matt and Jessica, was far too big, and it fell over his eyes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh? Rogers, huh...I remember your mother, Sarah, nice girl, big dreams, kind heart, she was a Hufflepuff.” He knew that, of course he knew that. “But you’re not like her, are you?” The hat’s way of sorting was rather invasive, and frankly, he thought, he wanted this over with. “You want to be special, you want to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone</span>
  </em>
  <span>. See the reason Carol Danvers is in Gryffindor is because she doesn’t want to be, you do. You have ambition, Rogers, and that means I’ll put you in SLYTHERIN!” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His gut sunk. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Down in the remainders of the crowd, Natasha looked surprised, Sam was scratching his head in bemusement, over on the Hufflepuff table Clint was gawping, mouth wide open, Sharon was hissing loudly in Carol’s ear. All of them looked confused. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He felt confused, he felt hurt. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mcgonagall was patting him on the shoulder, pointing him towards the table, and he stood, passing her back the hat and walking, shakily, to Slytherin. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Eyes passed but nobody really blinked, he wasn’t like Carol or Jessica or Sharon, he wasn’t important, nobody cared. Matt, eyes blindly flickering around, moved aside so he could sit down and he did, staring at his shoes. “Hullo, Steve, I’m Matt.” Then, when he didn’t respond, he carried on. “I’m sure Slytherin won’t be </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span> bad.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ahead of them, Natasha was sat on the stool, and Steve watched the short redhead be sorted, almost as soon as the hat touched her flaming hair she was declared “SLYTHERIN!” and hopped down. Steve let out a sigh of relief and moved sideways a little, squishing into Matt. The blind boy scooted up and Natasha slid in next to Steve, grinning. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m glad I’m not alone.” She whispered. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Me neither.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Matt blinked. “Hi, I’m Matt.” The short boy offered a hand sort-of between them and they both took turns shaking it, Natasha introducing herself. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Natasha Romanoff.” Then, she glanced over and spotted someone at the Ravenclaw table, who was scowling over at them. “Melina doesn’t look happy.” That, he realised, was her older sister, the prefect she’d been so negative about on the train journey, the dark-haired girl was frowning across with her arms folded. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She looks scary.” He said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She is.” Natasha countered, as that Rumlow boy that’d barged into him was sorted into Slytherin too. “Merlin, there are a lot of us, aren’t there?” She muttered, as the boy sat (away from them, Steve noted) with a group of older boys. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A couple more people were sorted, then finally it was just Sam left, and he went straight to Ravenclaw. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Food exploded onto the table after a speech that felt like it lasted forever, and Steve, though still rather put-down, was distracted by a rather large plum-pudding that appeared on a magnificent golden plate in front of him. He could see pumpkin boy (James? Was that his name?) and Clint loudly arguing over a leg of chicken over on Hufflepuff whilst the big guy he’d seen with Matt watched them reproachfully. On Gryffindor, Sharon was chatting amicably with Carol and the curly-haired Daniel Rand, the three of them laughing jovially, and at Ravenclaw he spotted Jessica and Sam discussing something and gesturing about with the long-haired girl, Valkyrie. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He supposed it wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>all that bad</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Slytherin common room, however, was another matter entirely. It was down a damp set of stairs, leading down a damp corridor to a damp wall that opened at a series of taps expressive, everything was </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> damp. Natasha bid him and Matt adue at the turn of the dormitories and the pair of them stumped down yet another set of damp stairs to the first year boys’ dormitory. It was small with four large four-poster beds, and he sat himself on the one nearest the door, guiding Matt to the one next to him, whilst Rumlow took one furthest away from them. The other boy plunked down on the other side. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“This place isn’t very blind-friendly.” Matt mumbled, lying down in a starfish shape on his bed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>All four beds had large silk hangings in green and silver, and Steve had chosen the one nearest the under-lake window. The reflections from the water outside turned the whole room a pale green, and he had to admit, it looked very pretty. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There were still too many stairs. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“True.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What colours are the hangings?” The blind boy reached out a wobbly hand and grasped some of the silk, wafting it about. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Slytherin colours.” Steve responded, then remembered a very key fact about Matthew Murdock. </span>
  <em>
    <span>He was blind.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Green and silver. The whole room’s sort-of green, because we’re below the lake.” He hurriedly added, supposing that describing the room wasn’t going to do much but it could do something. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Matt nodded. “Is it pretty?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sort-of. The colour is, but I think there’s mould on the wall.” He noted, staring at the green stuff growing on the stone walls. “It might be paint. But I think it’s mould.”</span>
  <span><br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The blind boy wrinkled his nose. “Ew.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Ew, indeed.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Across the dormitory room, Rumlow was puffing up his pillow with a savage anger, smacking his closed fists into it, and as he beat the living daylights out of his goose-feathers, he glared across at them both. Matt sat up, and stared around. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Who we staring at?” He questioned. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No one.” Steve said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>-</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Slytherin wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>awful</span>
  </em>
  <span> just yet, he decided, after his first night at Hogwarts. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He’d sent his owl, Captain, back over to his mother with a letter noting his house, and spent some of the night wriggling and writhing and worrying that she’d send one back disowning him, but however, with the morning post came a letter from Sarah Rogers detailing how ‘it didn’t matter where you go, you’re still my son’. That confirmed some positivity, and then there was breakfast itself.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Slytherins seemed to gather on one end of the table, and he, Matt and Natasha sat on the other end, with a rather motley collection of first years. With Sharon had come Carol and Daniel Rand, who was chattering cheerfully with Matt, and then with Clint, pumpkin boy, who told them all they could call him ‘Bucky’, Sam had made friends with Jessica and Jessica had made friends with Valkyrie, and the two girls were sat with the Saviour. All of them garnered a rather funny collection of raised eyebrows and whispers, but Steve didn’t mind. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was too busy laughing as Jessica made Sam’s porridge float over his head and Danny and Matt had an argument over the best kind of soup.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you have first?” Sharon turned and asked him. “Carol and I have Defense Against the Dark Arts.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His timetable was rolled up in his sleeve and he pulled it out. “Same.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She grinned. “Awesome! I think we have it together and then Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff have it after us.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Shar-oon?” Clint whined from across the table. “Why’s everyone staring?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He’d noted the odd looks, but now it seemed, as the rest of the school gathered in the Great Hall, it was silent but for them. They, chattering and laughing, were an odd collection, and though he’d not thought of it like that, he supposed it was true. “Inter-house unity and all that bollocks.” Jessica was the one who spoke, tucking her hair behind her ears and glancing about with pale green eyes. “Since the war, people have been separated. Guess nobody’s actually </span>
  <em>
    <span>tried</span>
  </em>
  <span> to not hate each other.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Valkyrie spoke, the first time Steve’d heard her do so. “I think there’s like an unspoken rule or something…”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sam nodded. “Melina says we’re not supposed to talk to you guys-”</span>
  <span><br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As if on queue, the Ravenclaw prefect slid into view behind the three Ravenclaws, her dark hair slicked back into a ponytail and brow raised. “Now, I don’t know if any of you have come into contact with Tony Stark-” by the looks on Carol and Sharon’s faces, they definitely had. “-I’m telling you this. Inter-house unity is banned as of now. All sit at your own tables.”</span>
  <span><br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Frowning up at her sister, Natasha spoke. “That’s not true, Mel-”</span>
  <span><br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Leave!” Melina hissed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mel-eena!” in the same stupid pronuncation that Clint used on Sharon, a short boy (older than them by a few years at least) was stood, grinning over at them. “Stop being a spoil-sport and let the midgets have their fun.” He chided. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The prefect looked as though she was about to blow her lid. “Tony-”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They’re just kids, Melina. Leave ‘em be.” </span>
