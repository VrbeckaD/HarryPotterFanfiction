    <p>Draco Malfoy is in his element, and Harry Potter can't tear his eyes away. The usual state of affairs for a Wednesday morning at work, then.</p><p>"So we believe when the perpetrator attempted to <i>Reducto</i> the wall behind me and Auror Potter, Auror Potter's disarming spell—when combined with my localised <i>Protego</i>—had an adverse reaction which caused his spell to backfire upon him. And <i>that's</i> how he ended up in that tree." </p><p>Malfoy nods at Harry—a minute, self-satisfied dip of his chin—and smiles brightly at Robards from across the desk.</p><p>Robards does not return the smile. </p><p>"Auror Malfoy, are you trying to tell me that you and Auror Potter—two of my most senior members of staff, vastly experienced in both defensive and offensive spells, and well-versed in simple containment charms—managed to bungle your bog-standard spellwork so spectacularly that you caused a civilian to be projected into a Bashing Beech during a routine premises search?"</p><p>Malfoy's eyes widen innocently, his silvery lashes starry and distracting. </p><p>"Civilian?" The word is laced with disdain, though accompanied by a smile that keeps Malfoy <i>just</i> on the right side of insubordinate as he continues.</p><p>"Guv, Salicorn <i>did</i> try to stick me with his Potions knife when Auror Potter and I entered his workshop. So spare me the innocent-until-proven-guilty line. And I don't wish to speak out of turn, but Auror Potter and I are <i>highly</i> accomplished wizards. We can't help it if our combined casting is a bit much for the criminals to handle."</p><p>Even Robards' lips are starting to quirk a little bit now, but his voice is dry.</p><p>"Ah yes, I'm glad you mention the workshop, Auror Malfoy. Because it is very surprising to me that you managed to hurl Salicorn into a tree when you were all indoors, fifty feet away from the surrounding vegetation. And of course there's the small matter of the workshop being left in, shall we say, a state of disrepair, following your raid. And though the prisoner doesn't exactly have a lucid memory of the arrest, he definitely recalls what he described as some sort of...unusual weather pattern?"</p><p>Malfoy is really enjoying himself now, Harry can tell, and he lets a tone of pure outrage enter his voice.</p><p>"Well, guv, as I recall it <i>did</i> seem a bit cool for this time of year. I had to wear my winter-weight uniform, do you remember, Potter? As to the rest, we can only assume that it was Salicorn's own <i>Reducto</i> rebounding that caused the roof to be ripped off the workshop, thus facilitating the perp's sudden ejection out of the scene of the crime. Auror Potter and I were certainly far too preoccupied with following Auror-approved arrest protocol to cast any spells that might explain the damage. You <i>have</i> had <i>Priori Incantatem</i> performed on our wands, I assume?"</p><p>Robards nods, eyes narrowed, and Malfoy dusts his hands off decisively and rises to leave. He's the picture of professionalism and decorum in his pristine uniform. The brass buttons that run in a line down his surcoat from throat to thigh are impeccably polished, his boots are buffed to a mirror-like sheen. He's perfect.</p><p>"Well, in that case, I take it that's all for today? Auror Potter and I are very busy on this case, and I'm sure you don't want this small matter holding things up any further, especially since you have our wand log to prove we followed protocol to the letter."</p><p>Malfoy manages to sound both brisk and slightly disapproving, which is quite a feat considering that Robards is not only their boss, but is starting to do that thunderous, intimidating thing with his eyebrows. Harry had seen trainees turn pale at the mere sight of an eyebrow twitch from Robards, let alone the full-on glower. However, Harry and Malfoy have been on the receiving end of the glower so often that it's lost its currency a bit. They're made of sterner stuff, which is lucky, because Robards isn't done with them yet.</p><p>"Of course, Auror Malfoy. I wouldn't want to interrupt the valuable work you're doing. I would just like to hear Auror Potter's take on the incident."</p><p>Now he turns to Harry, and the glower morphs into a suspicious glare. </p><p>Harry has been Malfoy's partner for five years now, and they were trainees together for three years before that. If there's one thing he's learned, it's that he should <i>always</i> go along with Malfoy's plans. Even when they seem dangerous, or a bit mad, or even completely pointless (and Harry is still surprised by how many of Malfoy's plans are a combination of any of those things), they tend to work out in the end. Harry has stopped worrying about it, and just goes along with it, for the most part.</p><p>Robards is still glaring, and Harry knows from long experience that the only way through this is to brazen it out. He shifts in his chair, slouching down even further, legs spread, and nonchalantly crosses his arms over his chest. His jeans are so well-worn that the weft over the knees has the texture of damp parchment. His boots are battered, laces fraying. He's wearing his work robes at least, for once, but he has slung them on haphazardly and left them open over his shirt (and it's one of Malfoy's least favourites today - the gold Prada one with purple stitching down the front that Harry adores but always causes Malfoy to look pained). </p><p>Harry doesn't even need to glance to know that Malfoy is looking him up and down, and rolling his eyes in resignation. Harry doesn't care - he didn't join the Aurors for the uniform after all. As Harry loves to remind Malfoy, he wasn't wearing an elaborately embroidered pelisse with gold frogging and Ministry insignia on the lapel the day he defeated Voldemort, was he?</p><p>"Well, Potter? I'm waiting. Do you have anything to say about this incident?"</p><p>"I do," Harry replies, and pauses. </p><p>Robards waits, expectantly, and Harry just lets the pause hang in the air. Robards' eyebrows are starting to quiver now, and Harry is wondering if he could actually push Robards over the edge one of these days. He decides that today is not that day, though—he and Malfoy have a criminal to catch, after all.</p><p>He gives Robards his best smile—the slow-dawning, distracting one; the one that Witch Weekly described as 'sun and steel, intimate yet devilish' in the last charity photoshoot he had done with them—and leans in confidingly to answer, "What Malfoy said."</p>
<hr/><p>Robards does shout a bit after that, but it's half-hearted at best and it's nothing that Harry and Malfoy haven't heard before. It's not long before they're dismissed, and they leave Robards muttering to himself about <i>bloody impudence, if it wasn't for their solve rate, still don't know how he ended up in that blasted tree</i>.</p><p>They're both sniggering by the time they get out the door, and when Harry intercepts Robards' robust door-shutting charm, and pulls the door gently shut instead of letting it slam as Robards had intended, Malfoy has to actually lean against the wall, shoulders shaking, until he gets his giggles under control. </p><p>"Bloody hell, Potter—no wonder he's so desperate to reassign us to different partners. You're a bad influence on me."</p><p>"I think you more than hold your own in the pissing-Robards-off stakes, Malfoy. Though I admit, today the eyebrows of doom were definitely focused more on me." </p><p>It's like old times, Harry thinks for a moment, like it used to be before <i>the wind thing</i> happened and changed things—made them careful of each other in a way they never used to be. </p><p>"Ah yes, the eyebrows had a life of their own today. I think you've broken him, Potter," Malfoy wheezes, and that sets them off again, until Harry is holding himself up against the wall too, and a group of trainees scurrying past looks at them curiously.</p><p>Malfoy pulls himself together, with some effort.</p><p>"Alright, the trainees already think we're absolutely barking—let's get out of here before they come back this way and we lose every bit of authority we have," he says.</p><p>Harry nods, even though he knows that the trainees are so terrified of them that there's absolutely no chance of that happening any time soon. Malfoy made McClintock cry during duelling class just last week, and in their first defence practical, Robertson had run away when Harry sent an <i>Alarte Ascendare</i> her way. Actually dropped wand and scarpered. Malfoy had spent the rest of the class pissing himself laughing about it, the prick.</p><p>They shove themselves off from the wall and stroll down the corridor towards their office. Their shoulders bump once, companionably, and then Harry feels Malfoy tensing slightly, drawing himself back almost imperceptibly. He chances a sideways look, and knows by the rigid line of Malfoy's jaw and the taut muscle in his cheek that Malfoy is <i>remembering</i>. </p><p>Malfoy slides Harry a glance, and Harry looks away, feeling a treacherous flush rising. Beside him, Malfoy sighs—a noise of gentle exasperation so very <i>Malfoy</i> that Harry's heart gives an inconvenient leap.</p><p>"Potter," Malfoy says carefully, and Harry knows what's coming. "We need to talk."</p>
<hr/><p>Their office is warded to the hilt—because Harry still gets stalkers and obsessive fans, even ten years down the line from the Battle of Hogwarts, and Malfoy is a paranoid fucker (and with good reason, too, judging by how often people have tried to kill them). Malfoy drops the wards, and they settle into their respective chairs with sighs of satisfaction. </p><p>Their office is tiny, desks shoved up against each other, a twirly chair and set of bookshelves each, a tea table, and one lone hard-backed seat for interviewees. </p><p>Harry's side of the room is spartan, his books neatly arranged and his photos framed and charmed to display as blanks to any strangers. Malfoy's side is decorated in his particular brand of organised chaos. Files teeter precariously, viciously expensive leatherbound books from the Manor library are shoved into the shelves haphazardly, alongside Malfoy's charity shop pulp crime novels and half-drunk cups of tea. His photos are stuck up on the wall with Spellotape—Lucius and Narcissa smiling at each other over a garden table, Pansy, Blaise, and Theo piled onto a couch in the Slytherin common room, Neville blowing a kiss and then laughing uproariously, and Malfoy and Harry after their first big solve. </p><p>In the photo, they're white-faced and a bit shaky-looking (and so they should be, considering the reserves it took to keep a <i>Protego</i> up around the Knight Bus for so long) and so, so proud. They have their arms slung over each other's shoulders, and are holding each other up, smiling at each other and then turning their grins on the camera. Harry loves that photo, and though Malfoy has never mentioned it, it's been pinned up on the wall of every cubicle they've ever shared over five years of working together, and now on the wall of their first ever office after their promotion to Senior Aurors. </p><p>Malfoy sets their kettle to boiling with an imperious twist of his wand, and two cups jump to attention when he jabs at them threateningly. As usual, the teabags sail through the air at a snap of Malfoy's fingers. Harry has been drinking tea since he was nine years old (sugary tea is a great comfort when you're tired, cold, and hungry) but <i>no one</i> can make a cuppa like Malfoy.</p><p>When they're both settled and have taken the first sip of tea, Malfoy raises an eyebrow at Harry, and Harry knows it's time to talk. He sighs (inwardly—he suspects Malfoy's not as fond of his sighs as he is of Malfoy's) and opens his mouth to preempt Malfoy. It doesn't work.</p><p>"Alright, Potter. What the fuck is happening with your magic?"</p><p>Malfoy's voice is as crisp and business-like as ever, but Harry can tell that he's properly concerned. The delicate crease between his brows is deepening, and his eyes are narrowed thoughtfully. </p><p>Malfoy leans forward, elbows on his desk, hands wrapped around his mug. His voice is low and confiding. "Potter, this can't keep happening. You <i>heard</i> Robards back there. Salicorn noticed there was something up with the weather. If it keeps happening, someone's going to join the dots. You'll be taken out of active duty. You'd wither up stuck behind the desk here. And I'd have to find a new partner. Can you <i>imagine</i> who they'd land me with? This is exactly what I was afraid of, and why we can't...well, you know."</p><p>The look on Malfoy's face at the thought of a new partner is one of pure horror, which Harry supposes he should take as a compliment. He wonders when he stopped thinking Malfoy's face was sneery, and started delighting in all the subtleties and nuances of his expressive features. Probably around the time he fell in love with Malfoy, he supposes. </p><p>When Harry replies, it's only half a lie. "Look, you know why it happened. He was really going for you with that knife, Malfoy. Guys like that don't play around—he knew exactly what he was doing. But I've been looking into it, actually. And I'm pretty sure I have it under control," he says, as vaguely and reassuringly as he can manage. </p><p>Malfoy doesn't buy it for a second. Now <i>he's</i> doing the unimpressed eyebrow raise. "<i>Clearly</i>, you don't have it under control. Potter, you conjured a cyclone in that raid! By accident! I'm not sure how I can be more clear about how you definitely do <i>not</i> have this under control. You blew the roof off that workshop. Literally <i>blew it off</i>. You're only lucky Salicorn got snagged by that Bashing Beech! Who knows where he'd be by now if it hadn't grabbed him as he blew past. Fucking Kansas, probably."</p><p>When he puts it like that, Harry can see how it does sound a bit bad. Obviously it's not really ideal to have some sort of freak wind-conjuring ability spring up out of nowhere. And it's definitely not ideal that it's wild magic, and totally out of Harry's control. And it's absolutely, positively not ideal that it seems to be triggered by Malfoy. Harry can feel himself blushing from his throat to his cheeks. Things are bad enough already, with Malfoy knowing how Harry feels about him. Malfoy knows, and he's turned Harry down. They've agreed to just forget about the whole thing. So why does Harry's stupid magic have to keep reminding them both?</p><p>"I've been reading up on it," he tells Malfoy. "It's called meteorolomancy, apparently. <i>Very</i> rare, a sign of great power, according to the book I found." He's trying to distract Malfoy now, and it works for a minute as Malfoy rolls his eyes energetically and starts muttering about <i>smug wankers</i> and <i>great power my arse</i>. But Malfoy's too much a lifelong Auror to fall for that trick, and Harry had known he'd never be able to set Malfoy off course for long.</p><p>But Malfoy has brightened up a bit now that research is on the cards, and he unerringly plucks a heavy tome from one of the dangerously leaning piles on his desk and starts rifling through it.</p><p>"Right, Potter—well, at least we know what we're dealing with now. We can start looking into it, and see if we can pinpoint the cause. Nice to see you've learned to crack a book since Hogwarts. Though I presume you've got Hermione on the case too?"</p><p>And this is the part Harry has been dreading. Because obviously he <i>should</i> have gone to Hermione the first time this weather lark happened. She would probably know exactly what it was, but even if she didn't, she'd have the whole library of Lux College, Oxford to help with her research. But going to Hermione for help would mean telling her everything, including how the whole thing started, and Harry's barely able to unspool it in his own mind—the thought of explaining it to anyone else gives him a chill of mortification. Not to mention the fact that Malfoy would probably be horrified. </p><p>"I've been in touch with Hermione," he says reassuringly, and it's not a lie because he Firecalled her just the other day. He just…hasn't mentioned the wind thing yet. "I wasn't sure how much to tell her about, you know, the first time?"</p><p>Malfoy's head snaps up at that, and Harry's only consolation is that the flush he can feel spreading treacherous and telling over his own face is mirrored on Malfoy—and with his pale skin, when Malfoy blushes, everyone knows it. It's so pretty on him though, Harry thinks ruefully, and then wonders if he may in fact be losing his mind. Because Malfoy, razor-sharp and lethal at work, reserved and self-contained in his personal life, would probably hex anyone who tried to call him pretty. </p><p>Malfoy's mouth is moving though he's struggling to actually get any words out, and it seems to be a bit of an effort when he finally speaks. </p><p>"Potter—Harry. I understand that this is awkward. For us. I mean. For you. And me. Us in that sense." And even though he's humiliated, Harry manages to feel a <i>bit</i> amused at Malfoy's uncharacteristic incoherence. </p><p>Harry's amusement seems to snap Malfoy out of it, and he fixes Harry with a frosty, unimpressed glare before he continues.</p><p>"Look, Potter. We know what <i>triggered</i> this mad wind magic of yours. For the moment, let's put aside all the...physical—shall we call it, attraction?—between us."</p><p>He grimaces. "I suspect the critical aspect of this was the—urgh, Potter, trust you to make us have to actually talk about this—emotional connection between us. It somehow caused this power of yours, which had presumably been dormant until that first night, to kick in when I got injured in the Potions lab raid. So, some sort of protective instinct?</p><p>"The problem is, it's getting worse. We're Aurors,  Potter—I'm going to be in danger quite a lot. And it's going to cause us problems if you unleash the bloody <i>Mistral</i> every time some half-baked petty criminal tries to Stun me."</p><p>Harry knows all this already, has gone over it relentlessly in the deepest, quietest moments of nights when he can't sleep for worrying about what this whole thing means for him and Malfoy, and their partnership. </p><p>He's loved Malfoy for ages—that was fine, or manageable at least. Because he's <i>had</i> Malfoy up until now, not in every way of course (and he has to shake himself and stop his eyes dropping to Malfoy's mouth, as he thinks about all the ways he wants him), but he's had Malfoy's attention and time and trust for so long now. It was enough, up until now. </p><p>The difference, Harry thinks, is that he's never come close to losing Malfoy before. As a team, they're reckless, and they go in hard, but they've always had talent and luck on their side. Harry had never seen Malfoy really hurt, never looked at his partner and truly imagined him gone, before that night. </p><p>The concept of loss was what had triggered this whole thing, when Harry's power had gathered and rushed in to fill the gap he had finally had to contemplate. And now he's experienced that fear, Harry is worried that he'll never be able to rein it all back in. But he has to get control of this, he tells himself. Otherwise, at some point he's going to literally blow the whole thing down around their ears.</p><p>He takes a fortifying slurp of tea, leans forward, and nods at Malfoy. </p><p>"You're right. It's not under control—yet. But I promise I'll get it sorted. There's never been a problem that Hermione can't fix. Chin up, Malfoy. We can't afford to get bogged down in this, not with three more assault cases coming in. Let's just concentrate on work for now, and I'll go and chat to Hermione next week and we'll come up with something. Deal?"</p><p>Malfoy looks sceptical, but he's nothing if not pragmatic. "Fine," he nods, "but keep the bit about all the sex to yourself please, Potter. I don't want to think about Granger stealing my moves to try them out on Weasley."</p><p>He smiles sweetly at Harry's look of horror, and then happily sets to reading the newest set of case files, humming softly to himself. He always did like to get the last word in.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <u>The First Time</u>
</p><p>It's almost midnight, and Harry and Malfoy are outside an illegal potions lab. They've been working on a Potions case for six weeks now, and they've finally had a break-through. </p><p>It's <i>definitely</i> the lab that's making the highly addictive, extremely unstable Felix Felicis rip-off that causes euphoria, risk-taking, and manic behaviour in its users, and has lead to fourteen hospitalizations and two severe injuries.</p><p>It's also <i>definitely</i> the headquarters of the neo-Death Eater cell that's using the potions money they glean from vulnerable addicts to fund their recruitment and Dark Arts research.</p><p>Harry and Malfoy should <i>definitely</i> wait for back-up. They're <i>definitely</i> not going to. </p><p>Harry just likes to take care of things himself, and Malfoy has a reckless streak when it comes to fucking up Death Eaters. He would never say, and Harry would never pretend to understand, but he still feels he has something to prove when it comes to dealing with the bad guys. </p><p>They hardly even need to discuss things anymore—they've had five years of sharing cubicles and offices, more than that again of long nights of drinking together, and weekends spent first studying and then playing catch up on cases. Harry never imagined that he could know anyone the way he knows Malfoy.</p><p>They're so quick, now, at planning ahead—it's the work of a moment to decide on a strategy, Malfoy's hot breath at Harry's ear, and the cool weight of his fingers at Harry's wrist an anchor and a distraction. They already know how many they're dealing with, and they go in fast and dirty, like they always do. Either of them alone could probably have taken this lot—together, with the vicious crackle and pull of their combined power, they feel unstoppable.</p><p>Harry takes the heavy-duty spellwork, and slams up a <i>Protego</i> so strong that he can hear the vials of Fortuna Fortis clinking in their crates. Malfoy is cool as a breeze, rattling off the spells to incapacitate, bind, and subdue without a blink. He's smiling in triumph, teeth bared, and his sleeves are rolled up to the elbow, as always. His Mark is a confrontation all on its own. He's beautiful.</p><p>It's too quick, really. They have all five of the Potioneers Stupefied and Body-Bound ready for transport in under two minutes, and they're left panting and grinning at each other in delight at their sheer good luck. Now they just have to call the job in—get the magitechs sent out to log the details of the crime scene, and have some juniors get started on the inventory for their report. The hard part is over, which is why the knock at the door of the lab comes as a surprise. </p><p>They've drawn and are in position within a heartbeat, and this time Harry spells the door to open while Malfoy wields the shield charm. </p><p>It's customers, clearly, two of them looking for their next fix, fumbling for coins as they enter. Harry unfurls a Body-Bind on the first one before they even look up from their coin purses. The second pulls his wand but Harry's totally sure of Malfoy's shield and he just concentrates on trying to get a clear line of sight on the man. </p><p>It's then he hears a noise that's so unexpected he takes a second to realise what it is. It's the obscene crack of a gunshot—a sound that should be so recognisable from telly but, in real life, is just unbelievable. Harry sees Malfoy's shield waver and zip down into nothing, and when he glances sideways he sees Malfoy's face is white with pain and fury. </p><p>Malfoy's clutching his shoulder, and blood is blossoming under his clenching fingers, offensive and vulgar against his elegant hands. And as he takes all this in, during that split-second where disbelief turns to rage, Harry realises that the addict wasn't holding a wand, but a gun, and has shot Malfoy—shot Harry's partner, shot Harry's best friend—with a Muggle weapon. And even while he's cursing their shortsighted wizarding arrogance, to only ward against magical attacks, he can feel his magic gathering and roaring through his chest. </p><p>The gunman is standing, staring at his weapon, as though shocked at what he's done, but Harry barely spares him a glance in his frenzy to get to Malfoy. He collects all of his raging magic and flings it out of himself wandlessly, channelling all his anger and protectiveness into...something. He's not even sure what he does—he's already moving to where Malfoy is swaying, but managing to stay on his feet—but he can feel his wandless magic tugging at the atmosphere like a summoning, a wordless prayer. </p><p>There's an audible whoosh, a rush of force, and Harry can actually see the magic swirling out of the air around his fingertips towards the man. It plucks the gun from his shaking hand, as easily and sweetly as a child collecting daisies, and then in a gesture of casually brutal violence, it twists the gun back in on itself until the metal squeals in protest. </p><p>Harry meets the man's eyes, sees him shaking his head in incomprehension. </p><p>His own eyes narrow, and he stretches his hand out until the tendrils of power flurry back to him, kissing his upturned palm. Then he pushes them all away, sends them roaring and whistling towards the gunman until they sweep him up and slam him into the wall of the lab. When he slides unconscious to the floor, the wind subsides, retreating back to Harry and ruffling his hair gently before blinking out as if it had never been there in the first place.</p><p>Harry's by Malfoy's side now, easing him to sitting, and his wand is hot and cumbersome in his hand as he fumbles at Malfoy's shirt. He inches it off Malfoy's shoulder, quelling the desperate urge to just rip, heal, save. Malfoy deserves more care. </p><p>Malfoy is so pale, and in so much pain, but Harry nearly sobs in relief when he checks the wound and sees it's a clean in-and-out. The bullet has bitten through the fat and muscle of his upper arm, but there's no shrapnel or debris left, and the bullet has gone out the other side. Suddenly, Harry's legs are going from under him, and he kneels with Malfoy's blood-tacky hand pressed to his cheek, and a prickle of relieved tears in his eyes. </p><p>Harry performs the <i>Episkey Magnus</i> in a broken whisper, and his <i>Tergeo</i> is gentle and hesitant. Malfoy winces, stretches his arm and rotates the shoulder, and nods decisively. "It's good." And then stronger, because Harry is looking distinctly shaken, "You fixed it, Potter. I'm all better."</p><p>Then he pushes himself up to standing again, still too pale and too slow, but very much himself and blissfully, gloriously alive. He offers a hand to pull Harry up, and when he gets Harry standing, he holds him there. Malfoy's hand in Harry's is an anchor, a mooring point. Harry couldn't move if he wanted to, but he doesn't want to. Not when Malfoy's hand is strong and warm in his, the elegant tendons of his wrist flexing and tensing under the brush of Harry's fingertips. </p><p>Malfoy leans in, and he doesn't stop looking at Harry, and his fingers tighten. "How did you do that, Potter?" Harry flushes, and stutters a bit, because he hasn't a clue how he did it, and he can't think clearly when Malfoy is so near, eyes blazing, smelling of almonds and burnt sugar and something a bit sharp and peppery which Harry now realises is blood.</p><p>And even though it's Malfoy—even though he's standing so close that it makes Harry want to dip his tongue into the hollow at the base of Malfoy's throat and lick a greedy trail all the way up to his mouth—he's still Harry's best friend and partner and Harry tries very hard not to lie to him. So he tells the truth.</p><p>"He hurt you. He hurt you and I was scared that you would die. And my magic just went mad when I thought about it—about losing you. I don't know how I did it, though." </p><p>Malfoy is very still, and he's totally clear-eyed and intent, but when he speaks, he sounds hesitant. "It was...dangerous, Potter. You could have killed him."</p><p>And for a split second, Harry can feel again the cold lick of terror down his spine when he thought Malfoy might be dead, and he needs to make Malfoy understand.</p><p>"I'd do it again, if I had to, if I knew how. I wouldn't even have cared if I had killed him. I'm scared that I felt like that, but I did. He doesn't get to hurt you like that. Fucking hell, Malfoy, there was so much blood."</p><p>Malfoy smiles at him, then—Harry's most favourite of all Malfoy's smiles, the beatific, serene one that only appears when he's really pleased about something. And Malfoy's hand tightens around Harry's wrist, and he just tugs at Harry, lightly and insistently and decisively. And it's as easy as that—and Harry is full of wonder, at how something he's worked himself up to wanting for so long can be so simple—and they're pressed together, cheek to cheek and chest to chest. </p><p>Malfoy leans back slightly so that he can see Harry, but he keeps him tethered, as close as he can get him.</p><p>"You misunderstand me, Potter. You think I was criticising you?" His voice is a low rumble of desire and amusement and warmth, all jumbled up into something that's both breathtakingly new and gorgeously, reassuringly familiar. His mouth is moving against Harry's skin, now, his stubble a whisper against Harry's cheek. If Harry moved an inch to the side, he'd have Malfoy's mouth on his. He feels weak with wanting it.</p><p>"I'm glad you did it. He tried to kill me. I don't want to die at work. I don't want to die bleeding onto the floor of a filthy potions lab. I don't want to die, Potter. I have too much that I want to do." And his voice is so low and filthy and full of promise on that last bit that Harry finally—finally!—gets the courage to turn his face into the kiss he's been waiting for. </p><p>When he had imagined this—and fucking hell, how many times did he imagine this?—he had pictured a lot of slamming Malfoy into walls and frantic rutting and ripping of clothes. He supposes that he had never imagined that it actually, really, might happen, especially like this. It's not aggressive. It's not a release of tension, but more of a gradual exploration of a growing need. Harry wants it desperately, but it's fond and comfortable too. He can take his time with it, he thinks. It's not what he had imagined. He could never have imagined this. </p><p>That said, Harry is halfway to hard already, and has been from the first brush of Malfoy's mouth on his. He's only human after all, and this is <i>Malfoy</i>. In the dim recesses of his mind, the only part of him that can think anything other than <i>yes, fuck, more, your mouth, Malfoy</i>, he knows he shouldn't be surprised that Malfoy kisses the same way he does everything. He's totally focused, those extraordinary mercury grey eyes narrowed in concentration when he pulls Harry closer, only fluttering shut at the last second, as their mouths meet. </p><p>Harry's used to having Malfoy's full attention—ever since they were eleven years old, he and Malfoy have been each other's obsession—but he could never have dreamed of being the focus of Malfoy's desire like this. Malfoy can't stop touching him, and the look on his face is raw and hungry. Harry knows that look—he feels that look.</p><p>An unexpected pleasure is hearing Malfoy narrate their kiss. Malfoy never shuts up—he never wants to, and never knows when to—and he's talking now, even with Harry chasing his mouth down greedily as if to swallow every sound he makes. </p><p>"Harry Potter, fucking hell. I'm kissing you. You're kissing me back? Bloody fuck, you're kissing me back." A swipe of his tongue, hot and insistent, and Malfoy gasps, a soft, subdued sound that makes Harry's heart clench. "Potter, let me...yes, just there"—his teeth scrape along the ridge of Harry's jaw, and then for a blissful moment his thumbs flick over Harry's nipples through his shirt, and Harry's hips slam forward totally unbidden, and he growls with pure lust. "You like that, Potter? Just wait until I get my mouth on you. I want to taste you…" and then he's sliding his mouth down Harry's throat and sucking a mark into the velvety skin below Harry's ear, sloppy and desperate and voracious.</p><p>And then Malfoy winds both hands into Harry's hair and holds him there with a tug, just on the oh-fuck-that's-hot side of painful, and he looks at Harry and laughs. </p><p>Harry laughs too—a bold, delighted sound that bubbles up and is pushed out of him by the feeling that his heart is jumping up into his throat—because he hadn't dared to hope that this could ever be so sweet, and so easy. And it is—nothing about them has changed, except all those years of friendship have shifted over a bit to allow room for the unfurling of this overwhelming sense of pure want. It's glorious.</p><p>"Harry, can I tell you what I thought when I saw you blasting that guy without even thinking about it?" Harry nods, shuddering at the tightening of Malfoy's hands in his hair, and then Malfoy pulls his head back and licks a hot line down his throat and then—blissfully, finally—lets himself slide to his knees in front of Harry, hands trailing decisively down Harry's flanks until they grasp at the dip of Harry's hipbones. Malfoy continues speaking, his thumbs pressed into Harry's skin just above his waistband. </p><p>"I thought, that is the <i>hottest</i> thing I have ever seen." His mouth descends to press heatedly at the bulge in Harry's jeans, and his hands tighten in warning on Harry's hips, holding him still. "I thought, I'm going to fuck him after this." And his voice is muffled now as he starts to properly suck around the tip of Harry's cock through his jeans, and Harry feels a bit like he might go mad with lust at the sound of it. He's wet through, just from Malfoy's maddening mouth and the slick of his own precome. And just when he thinks that he might even be able to come like this—helplessly, messily, in his jeans, with Malfoy giving him not quite enough friction, and seven unconscious criminals not ten feet away from him—Malfoy pulls his mouth away. </p><p>His face is serious when he looks up at Harry, and with his wet mouth and Harry's stubble burn pinking a trail along his jawline, he's devastating. "You conjured <i>your very own wind</i>, Harry. Your magic is...gorgeous."</p><p>And then he starts to slide the buttons of Harry's fly open, and his smile when he sees that Harry isn't wearing any underwear is so wicked and approving that Harry's cock actually pulses, and leaves him panting. Malfoy tugs his jeans down, swears a bit, then palms his wand to vanish Harry's shoes (and he'd better be able to summon those back later) and once Harry's jeans are down, all bets are off. </p><p>Malfoy pushes Harry back, so he's leaning against the cluttered lab workbench, and he hooks Harry's knee over his shoulder, his Cleaning Charm rushing through Harry in an inquisitive tingle. Then he's finally sucking Harry off properly, wet and slow and noisy. With one hand, he shoves his trousers open and begins to fist his own cock, but he slides his other hand under Harry's thigh where it rests on Malfoy's shoulder and then begins to roll Harry's balls gently. And then he moves his hand back along Harry's leg to lift it higher, to open him right up, and he licks all the way back to Harry's hole. </p><p>Harry can't help anything he does then—he thrusts recklessly at the delicious intrusion of Malfoy's tongue lapping at him, and he groans so brokenly that it's very almost a sob as he rolls his hips to press harder into the answering push of Malfoy's tongue. He barely has the presence of mind to finally fling up a privacy charm—because even if the criminals are Stupefied, they're still right there—and then there's nothing but his own helpless groans and the obscene noise from Malfoy's mouth, and Harry's hands scrabbling for purchase on the lab table behind him.</p><p>Very soon—too soon—Harry has to push Malfoy away in desperation, and he turns to bend himself over the lab table. He thinks it's clear that he wants Malfoy to fuck him, but just in case he tells Malfoy so, very clearly and urgently, and it's a happy side affect that Malfoy gets all open-mouthed and frantic and nearly falls over in his haste to stand up. So it happens that Malfoy has to try his Freshening Charm twice before it takes, and they're both laughing when Malfoy spins Harry back around to face him, and hefts him up onto the table. "Like this, okay?" he murmurs, and Harry bats his eyelashes and tells him it's very sweet that he wants them gazing into each other's eyes, and Malfoy snorts and tells him to fuck off, but then he's slathering on his conjured lube and his cockhead is nudging at Harry and easing in, opening him up so gently and slowly. </p><p>And in fact they <i>are</i> gazing into each other's eyes the whole time, and Harry can see the desperate flare of heat as Malfoy presses in, inch by tantalising inch. And Malfoy can see the moment when Harry passes from <i>full</i> to the need for more, so he knows exactly when to start the proper thrust and grind of his hips, his hand working Harry's cock until Harry comes furiously all over them both. It's probably embarrassingly fast but Harry doesn't give a shit. He has never come so hard, and Malfoy seems to like it, judging by the fact that about twenty seconds later he comes inside Harry while sucking Harry's spunk off his own fingers. It's <i>blindingly</i> good. </p><p>It's not even awkward afterwards, when Malfoy eases himself out and then just stands there with his arms around Harry, holding him up. Harry feels a bone-deep satisfaction, as he leans into the bracket of Malfoy's arms and buries his head in Malfoy's neck. Malfoy's voice is an amused murmur in Harry's ear when he says, "You realise we've contaminated an active crime scene with our DNA now?" And because he follows it with a kiss right on Harry's ear, and then buries his face in Harry's hair (and Harry thinks that might even have been a hair sniff) Harry feels brave enough to reply, "Nah, it's just your DNA contaminating the scene, so I'm alright. I think you managed to lick most of <i>my</i> DNA off me." And Malfoy's soft cock actually twitches a bit and he groans only half-jokingly, and pulls Harry in for a kiss that's far filthier than you'd expect from two people as shagged out as they are. </p><p>Malfoy finally pulls himself away and grumbles about gross unprofessionalism and industrial-strength Scourgifies, and Harry laughs at him and asks if he fancies getting dinner after, and also another shag later? And Malfoy actually blushes at the dinner suggestion and says he's not that hungry, why not just skip straight to the fucking, and Harry can't really argue with that. </p><p>But the clean up isn't going to do itself, and they've got a lot still to do, so they dress and clean themselves and get going. They work as efficiently as ever, for the most part, but they can't seem to stop touching each other in passing—their hands brushing for slightly too long, Malfoy's firm touch at the small of Harry's back as he moves around him, Harry running a finger slowly down the graceful ridge of Malfoy's spine as he bends to count the crates.</p><p>It's distracting, is what it is, and Malfoy eventually pokes Harry in the chest with his wand and tells him to keep a distance or they'll never be done. "And you'll have to keep your hands to yourself in future, Harry. We can't fuck on the job again. Aside from anything else, I think it might be the thing that would tip Robards over the edge, if he ever found out." Harry laughs and chances tugging Malfoy in for a quick, last kiss, and because he hasn't got an ounce of self-control now he's finally allowed to touch, he's got Malfoy's earlobe between his teeth when he answers. </p><p>"Okay, but we should really make the most of this, though—Robards is going to reassign us once he knows we're together anyway, so we won't be working the same cases anymore." And even as he says it, Harry feels a twist of regret. He'll never have a partner as good as Malfoy again. And because he's wondering who else he could bear to work with  (not many people), and he's also rather distracted by the lickable line where the shorn silver of Malfoy's hair meets the skin of his neck, it takes him a few seconds to notice that Malfoy has gone rigid and unresponsive.</p><p>He pulls back, confused, to see Malfoy looking pale and troubled. "Why would Robards have to know about this, Potter? It's not as if it's any of his business. I am <i>not</i> working with a new partner."</p><p>"Well, it is his business, actually. It's against policy to allow people in a relationship to partner up. You <i>know</i> this, Draco. You've got the Handbook memorised, for fuck's sake. He has to reassign us once we tell him."</p><p>"Why is why we <i>don't tell him</i>, Potter. That way, we get to keep working together <i>and</i> I get to find out what it feels like to have you fuck me next time. It's win-win."</p><p>But Harry is already moving, the crawl of dread propelling him away from Malfoy, and he jams his hands into his pockets to keep them from reaching out, from trying to take more than Malfoy wants to give. </p><p>"Sorry, Malfoy—I…I don't understand. I was hoping we could...I mean, I would like it if you would be my...oh, fuck it! I have...feelings for you"—and bloody Malfoy smirks at that, like Harry knew he would—"I can't do casual. Not with you, anyway. If we're doing this, I'm all in."</p><p>Malfoy is snorting inelegantly now, and his voice is cool when he queries snidely, "Since when have you been such a stickler for the rules? I didn't see you rigorously upholding the Auror Code of Conduct when you <i>let all the Eeylops owls out of their cages</i> two weeks ago."</p><p>Harry scrubs at his forehead in frustration. "That was a tactical move to interfere with the criminals' escape route! <i>And</i> I managed to round almost all of them back up by the end of the day. And you can't exactly talk - while I was uncaging the owls, you were stealing two of the brooms parked outside, to head the thieves off before they could reach the Apparition point!"</p><p>"Justified commandeering for the purposes of apprehension. <i>Posse comitatus</i>, Potter," Malfoy replies smoothly. </p><p>"We're getting off the subject, Malfoy. Look, even if we decided to keep this quiet at work—and I'm not exactly averse to that, because I don't want this to stop—don't think I don't have plans for your desk in the office—I don't <i>want</i> to keep this a secret. Not from our friends. I don't want some secret affair that burns itself out in a frenzy. I want everything. I want things to be easy, and to be able to enjoy it. You. Enjoy...us. I won't hide this away. And you know with me, that's going to mean the press will be all over it too. We can't hope to keep this from Robards.  We shouldn't even try."</p><p>Harry is in love with Malfoy, but Malfoy can still be a bit of a prick when he wants to be. He sounds exactly like Lucius when he replies, disdain dripping from every syllable. "Yes, I can see how that will work out delightfully for me, Potter. Castigated by the press, no doubt. Reassigned at work, having to work with some dull-witted, rules-obsessed, Robards-worshipping lackey—because don't think he'll miss his chance to try and put reins on me if he can, Potter. And then you and I don't work out, and we end up hating each other, and I'm out in the cold on all fronts. Not bloody likely!"</p><p>"Well, it's hardly likely to work out if you're going into it presuming the worst! For fuck's sake, Malfoy. We've been best friends for years now—oh, don't roll your eyes at me, you utter cock, you know it's true—so why would we end up hating each other? Isn't it worth a shot?"</p><p>Malfoy is silent for a beat, and he swallows hard. Then he comes closer, crowding into Harry in such a way that Harry has to steel himself not to respond physically (and really, he has to get a grip. They literally only fucked once and he's already getting Pavlovian urges to <i>touch</i> whenever Malfoy is nearby). Malfoy places his hands on Harry's shoulders, and his voice is very, very gentle. It's worse, like this—Harry knows what to do with vicious Malfoy, but when Malfoy is soft and quiet he only wants to lick into his mouth, and hold his hand, and stroke his hair. </p><p>"Harry, maybe this won't make sense to you. But I worked hard—<i>work</i> hard, every day, even now—to get where I am in this job. You know I barely made it into the Auror Academy, even with my excellent NEWTs. They didn't want me, with my mark and my name and my accent and my fucking, fucking father in Azkaban. I slogged my guts out to get here—you know, you were there. And yes, I started out trying to prove myself, trying to show everyone that I'm not a blood purist and an ideologue and an evil twat anymore, basically. But along the line, I started to love it."</p><p>He eyes Harry with a quiet sort of desperation. </p><p>"I love my job, Potter. I love it, <i>and</i> I earned it. It's the only thing of worth that I've ever done. I cannot—I <i>will not</i>—give up everything. This is my success story, Potter. You and me, our partnership, our solve rate—it works. <i>Please</i>. Don't let's ruin what we have."</p><p>And that's it, then, Harry thinks. Because he would have Malfoy, if he could—he'd take and take, ravenous for anything that Malfoy could offer him—but he won't ask for more than Malfoy is willing to give. And Harry has his principles too. Love is not something he has ever taken for granted, not after his parents were stolen from him. And living with the Dursleys, without a gentle touch or a soft word or a sense of being <i>part</i> of something—well, Harry realised early on that being loved was not a right granted to everyone. So when he does love, it's a fierce and powerful thing. He doesn't compromise with the people he loves, the people who have become the family he never had. He doesn't lie to them, even by omission. He can't imagine trying to hide a relationship—and such a relationship!—from the people he considers his family. </p><p>Malfoy is watching him warily, and he brings his hands up to meet Malfoy's where they still rest on his shoulders. "I understand. I don't like it, but I do understand. But how do we go back to...<i>not</i>...doing this? Now you know that I—urgh—like you...that way?" </p><p>What Harry doesn't say is, how am I supposed to act as though I don't want to wake up next to you every morning, and to be the one to see you safely to sleep every night, and to know you from the inside out? How am I supposed to stop touching you, now I know what it feels like to have you moving in me? How am I supposed to sit facing you across our desks, when I know what the inside of your lower lip feels like under my teeth? </p><p>But Malfoy knows, of course—he always knows what Harry isn't saying. His smile is very sad, and desperately sweet, when he answers.</p><p> "We just do, Potter."</p>
