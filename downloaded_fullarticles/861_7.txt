<p>Hermione was both excited and nervous as she read the invite for what seemed to be the fifteenth time. Oddly enough, both feelings brought butterflies to her stomach, albeit they seemed to be from different sides of the pond and were at war with each other. Ugh, she felt like she was about to hurl out her very light lunch from earlier. She was a grown woman damn it, she should be over the nervousness that came with the unknown and unpredictable!</p>
<p>Unpredictability.</p>
<p>She hated that word. Well, not the whole word. Or the meaning of it. More like, just the tail end of that word. The ‘predictable’ part.</p>
<p>That was what Ron had told her when they had broken up.</p>
<p>“Hermione, our relationship has just become so predictable! You live for work"...</p>
<p> <em> Oookay. </em></p>
<p>.."you always have the same unflinching opinions"...</p>
<p><em> Wow, big word there </em> Ronald.</p>
<p>…"you dress the same constantly"...</p>
<p><em> It’s called </em> business attire <em> Ronald. </em></p>
<p>…"and you never do anything with your hair!"</p>
<p>
  <em> Ouch. </em>
</p>
<p>His words struck her like a slap to the face. She knew that they were over long before the breakup, and she had been dreading and planning to have <em> the talk </em> with him about ending their relationship (which really could be classified more of an intimate friendship) but when he had beat her to the punch with such a bulls-eye psychoanalysis, she had seen red and laid it pretty thick on him as well. A lot of ugly truths were said that night, but their friendship had overcome it eventually. Although the words lingered still to this day. She still lay in bed at night, thoughts swirling around in her head, words that she’d heard from Ron, and really from every person she considered being close to her heart – Harry, Ginny, even Neville and Luna had said it dismissively: Hermione, you’re so predictable.</p>
<p>So tomorrow night, at the reunion, she was going to be anything but. She was going to be a wild card, unpredictable to the core. She was going to go against her nature, go with the flow, defy all logic. Who knew, maybe it was going to be exactly what she needed to hurl her into the adventure she craved.</p>
<p>Ginny and Narcissa, (yes Narcissa Malfoy) with whom she had become great friends, were going to help her with clothes, hair, and makeup. After the war, when Harry had spoken at Narcissa’s trial and helped her escape an Azkaban sentence, and both Hermione and Harry had done likewise with Draco Malfoy, she and Narcissa had started meeting for tea every Tuesday at Malfoy Manor. Ginny had started coming along after a while, and the three ladies had become very close friends. Draco Malfoy, or really just Draco now, had slowly become her friend too, the catalyst being when he had crashed their tea party one late Tuesday afternoon. The same afternoon that the three ladies had decided to be extra mischievous and, unbeknownst to Draco, had poured some Green Fairy Absinthe in their teas (many giggles were shared over the Absin-<em>tea</em> they were drinking). Draco had thoroughly enjoyed the uncharacteristically delicious tea (he was more of a coffee drinker when afternoon came around), had gotten very drunk and honest, and had apologized to the “beautiful Hermione, so brilliant!” many times for everything he’d done. Yes, Draco Malfoy was just Draco now, and he was an amazing man, and a very dear friend indeed.</p>
<p align="center"><b>. . : </b> <b>\</b> <b> : . .</b></p>
<p>Draco Malfoy considered himself the luckiest unlucky man in the whole of Wizarding Britain. He had been a straight-out little shit when he was younger, then, - being handed an impossible task, he had struggled so much with it, that he had been shaken to core. Being raised to believe in a certain way of life, only to start seeing it for how wrong it was just when all options of freedom of choice had been taken away from him. He was lucky that his cowardice had stopped him from doing anything really stupid, allowing him to eventually get to that freedom of choice when he had been exonerated from his crimes, very much thanks to Harry Potter and Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>
  <em> Hermione Granger. </em>
</p>
<p>After his trial and his freedom, he had started to see her in a different light. She had started coming over for tea every Tuesday, getting together with his mother and the youngest female Weasley, now known as Potter. Every time he saw Hermione, he was struck with how beautiful she was. What he had previously seen as a rat’s nest for hair, he now saw as beautiful and unique curly hair that had life to it, much like the wonderful creature whose head it was attached to. Her intelligence shone through in every debate they’d had before the three ladies usually shooed him out of the tea parlor. Her eyes blazed and held him captive every time she patiently listened to him when he was making his point of view in whatever they were disagreeing on this time. He actually didn’t disagree with her that much at all, but he loved their dynamic so much that he couldn’t help but to play the devil’s advocate nearly every time.</p>
<p>One fateful Tuesday (which he now refers to as <em> The Turning of the Fairies Dance) </em>he had come to the realization that he fancied Hermione Granger very much, and in his bad luck of drunken confessions, their comfortable companionship had become a close friendship. Yes, a very lucky unlucky bastard he was indeed. Since that night, he had tried to get closer to Hermione, flirting with her, trying to gauge how she felt about him, but at every turn he had been stopped in his attempts, either by silly things such as an owl swooping in with an emergency at The Ministry where she worked, or Ginny stubbing her toe on an antique boudeuse sofa in the large tea parlor.</p>
<p>He had amassed countless missed opportunities to get her attention, and to make her see that their friendship was meant to become more, but tomorrow night was going to be the turning point. As he read the invitation to the fifth-year reunion at Hogwarts for the fifteenth time, he felt the warring feelings of nervousness and excitement building up in his stomach. There would be no more missed opportunities for Draco Malfoy. Come tomorrow, his dear friend Hermione would simply become - <em>his</em>.</p>
