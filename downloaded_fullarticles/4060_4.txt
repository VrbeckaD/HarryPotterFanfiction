  <span>Getting off the train was exciting.  There was a big man, whom Harry said was Hagrid.  Ron had some trouble signing that to me. It was kinda funny how much he stumbled over the words and letters.  I’m just glad he tried his best. It was a sweet act and it is cherished. Harry took my hand and lead me up the steps as Ron seemed to be talking Harry’s ear off.  Harry would laugh and everyone seemed very joyous. It was a great feeling. It felt very warm. Harry pulled me and Ron to the front. A frizzy-haired girl followed and, from what I could get from Ron, kept talking about the history of Hogwarts. Sounds like someone who really loves books.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You lucky are deaf’ Ron signs.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I know, but sometimes I wish I could hear…’ I sign back looking down.  Harry put his hand under my chin lifting my face to look at his. He said something and I looked at Ron.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>'Harry says, You wonderful just like this' Ron was smiling and nodding. I looked back at Harry and gave him a small smile telling him I understood.  He looked like he was about to something else when he suddenly turned around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Standing there was a boy with sleek blonde almost white hair.  He was about my height. I hid behind Harry’s scrawny figure not wanting to be teased for being deaf.  I peeked at Ron to see him turning red and looking down and at his robes. I looked at Harry and there was an elderly woman walking down towards us.  The boys looked at her as she said something and then looked back at Harry. As he was looking he looked down and saw me. His eyes widened slightly but not enough for others to notice and his eyebrow raised.  It was like he recognized me. I quickly hid again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, we were walking again.  Ron and Harry were on either side of me.  There were 6 kids standing in front of us.  As we walked up the stone steps, I could feel the heartbeats of everyone walking and through the doors opening wide.  My eyes widened at what I saw. I was a great Hall for dining. It was magnificent. So beautiful and welcoming. Harry squeezed my hand and I looked at his awshook face.  
              Looking at I Ron he signed, Beautiful. Nodding in agreement, I looked around at all the faces of older kids. I bumped into the person in front of me and they glared back at me.  People started pushing past Harry, Ron and me. I don’t know what was happening but they sat in a chair and a hat was set on their head. Ron was called. His face was really pale. When he jumped off the chai, he went over to a table where some people looked like him.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>All the sudden Harry was pushing me up the stairs to the chair.  What the hell was he trying to get me to do? I sat up on it and the old wrinkled women put the dinghy hat on my head.  I heard a voice. Like an ACTUAL voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You must be deaf.  Don’t worry. I won’t hurt you and I am really real so there’s no reason to freak out.  Relax your body, child.” I tried to relax, but I couldn’t very easily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“W-who are you..?  How can I hear you? “  I asked in my mind</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m a magical singing hat.  You didn’t hear me but I have some tunes.”  I was very sure the hat would be smirking if it were human.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, what house should you be in...You seem eager to please. And very cunning.  I hint a dangerous feeling to you...very dangerous…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pardon me, sir, but how can I be dangerous? I am a deaf boy. I can not hear or talk very fluently.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is a question for the Headmaster.  Have Harry take you and Ron to the Headmaster's office.  He can help you. You better go over to the table with the Blonde boy now.  That will be your house now. Don’t talk to anyone. Just keep to yourself. I promise you will find out about my ramblings.  Now go, child. And Good luck.” I climbed off the chair and walked over to the table. I could feel the clap and cheer when I sat down. They vibrated the whole table with them.  I did as the hat said and no one bothered to talk to me anyways. Whenever I looked up, thought the blonde headed boy would be watching me. What was his problem? Honestly…</span>
