  <p>We were school rivals. I sometimes wonder if we would have stayed just that, had things been different. Petty, malicious, sneering and turning our heads the other way, each with our little following, our juvenile grudges. We were pushy, full of insecurities and naive simplicity, and thought we were bigger than the world. </p>
  <p>My jeans and hoodies, scraggly ruffian look, quick temper, and impulsive bravery. You, with your pristine pale features, aristocratic bearing, haughty lips and bloodline pride. Me - an orphan and castaway. You - a doted on only child. An outsider rebel and an insider to a dark society wrapped in secrecy. </p>
  <p>We both belonged above the crowd, projected the persona people wanted to see. Both forced to live with the molded weight of expectations...our destinies. Content with our paltry schoolboy feuding, we were nevertheless forced to unwanted extremes. Play areas became battlegrounds, and lessons, sparring matches. Our words were our weapons, but they weren't enough. </p>
  <p>War was waged in the school corridors. We wanted fist fights and mean-spirited practical jokes, cutting sarcastic banter and gloating upper-hands. The war gave us death, and torture, gave us heavy guilt and panicked split-second choices. </p>
  <p>It gave us us darkness and heaviness, scream-inducing nightmares and clawing for survival, choose-us-or-choose-them mentality, loved ones or strangers, pushed us to the brink of an uncrossable divide. The war forced us from school rivals to arch enemies, neither of us wanting the roles we played and neither of us feeling we had a choice. </p>
  <p>Our destinies. </p>
  <p>You were marked for darkness. I, to fight against it. We had few ways to channel our burning frustration, our simmering anger at our authority figures, at people, at the war, so we used each other as outlets for the violence we felt – not ever realizing how similar we were. </p>
  <p>I screamed into the sky, let loose through hurtling air. You let silent tears trail in a dusty room by an old wardrobe. Our hands shook holding our wands. We were left with the choice of murder or unthinkable consequences. </p>
</div><div class="column">
  <p>We were the weapons of a new generation, puppets for a bitterness carried from another age, defined by the choices our families made before us. We both knew what we had to stand for the moment we entered the wizarding world - figureheads left over from a war that wasn't ours. </p>
  <p>I had to die for my cause. You had to kill for it. </p>
  <p>Somewhere along the line, we ceased to be school rivals. Suddenly, we were just pawns, and the game wasn't a game anymore.</p>
  <p>You might have wanted to punch my face in, but instead got to see me tortured and degraded, wanting death - but never begging for it. Never begging. </p>
  <p>I was relentless in my mockery of your position, but froze when faced with you on a cold stone floor, bleeding out in a hundred different places, water and red pooled around your pale white, eyes torn with anguish.</p>
  <p>We never wanted any of that. </p>
  <p>The realness of it spoiled our shallow judgements, our superior contempt and easy ridicule. We wrestled with being seventeen, with life and indecision, with love and honor and bravery and the meaning of these words we throw around, like family or right thing to do. We did what we needed to do to survive, and rationalized our decisions after. </p>
  <p>I hid my numbness behind reckless emotion - you hid your emotion behind your facade. I despised a fame that put me places I didn't want to be - you coveted a fame that would take you where you wanted to go. </p>
  <p>We were legacies. Falling apart in broom closets and bathroom stalls. Trapped in the legends of our names. We were children. We were used. </p>
  <p>But I wonder, were we really opposites?</p>
  <p>Or only two sides to the same coin?</p>
