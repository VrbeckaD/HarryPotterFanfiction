    <p>This is it, she thought with mixed feelings of despair and relief. The green light engulfed her and she fell back, her arm still flying the intricate pattern of the next spell she was trying to cast. The petty side of her really wishing to get one more shot in before her world went dark.</p>
<p>Death was dark, it was heavy and as she hit the ground she felt the pain going through her head and pelvis disappear to nothing. It was like being underwater.</p>
<p>She had seen it coming. She really had. The Deatheater was fresh onto the field, not injured and fast. Bloody fast. She had briefly wondered where they were all coming from before rushing to protect Harry. Her freshly cut hair was slicked to her head with a mixture of sweat and blood. Curses leaving her lips at speeds that probably sounded like rubbish to anyone listening. Her dislocated shoulder swung her arm like a pendulum, with each swing pain shot up her arm and swam to her spine in agonizing tingles.</p>
<p>He fought her with more energy then she could muster even with the amount of adrenaline in her body. It had been 48 hours of complete hell. Rain and rain mixed with snow had pelted them. She had killed more people than she ever thought possible, wounded more. She didn’t remember what it was to be warm. To not have pain. It had been too long since she had a real roof over her head and more than a mouthful of food. She kept glancing at Harry, determined to bring him through to the end of this all.</p>
<p>Still, nagging thoughts lingered, how would their futures really turn out after all this fighting and grief? Even if the light won, what would be left to win? It seemed like everyone had already been lost. Even Harry, who above all odds managed to be a shining beacon of light to those who had lost all other hope, walked with eyes dulled and hopeless.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter now, she had failed. She remembered green and she remembered dark. It was so quiet that it was almost maddening. She felt nothing… She felt… itchy from trying to feel what was no longer there. Wasn’t there supposed to be peace after the end?</p>
<p>The sound of thunder shocked her to opening eyes she was sure she no longer had. It felt like the world shook, and suddenly, she was cold again.</p>
<p>She could feel the ground below her was hard. She shook her head as she heard exclamations from further away and the sound of running feet on cobbles clanged through her head. She opened her eyes and squinted through bright sunlight at what appeared to be Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>“What the fuck” she muttered blinking. Diagon Alley was destroyed, and yet here it was fully standing, clean, bright, and just like she remembered from her first time seeing it when she had been eleven.</p>
<p>“Hold still! Merlin where did you come from?” a deep voice came from above her.</p>
<p>She looked up and frowned, sucking in breath. He sounded familiar. She watched as he preformed the usual diagnosis spells, his voice getting more and more surprised sounding as more and more of them came up positive.</p>
<p>“how are you conscious right now?” he muttered under his breath when he was finished. He knelt beside her, leather jacket creaking slightly as he did to get a good look at her, bringing with him the scent of exhaust, leather and aftershave. She met his eyes then, confusion becoming disbelief as her amber eyes met gray.</p>
<p>It was Sirius Black. She had no doubt in her mind. But he was young. Younger than she had ever known him.</p>
<p>“I’m dead then” she stated, running a hand through her grimy hair and grimacing as her opposite shoulder shot pain through her spine.</p>
<p>“It’s… Not like I had imagined it. I hope you remember me or this is going to be awfully awkward”</p>
<p>Recognition sparked in his eyes and he did a double take, his eyes roving her, “H-Hermione? What the fuck are you doing here? How did you get here?”</p>
<p>“You remember me then?” she asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head no and at the same time stood, “we need to get out of the street, do you think you can move? I’ll get us to my apartment.”</p>
<p>“apartment in the afterword? Really?”</p>
<p>His shoulder rose and fell, “I will do my best to explain in a second. Lets take care of that shoulder and...” he waved his wand, and her shoulder burst with new pain, she shuddered and he gave her an apologetic glance before he tentatively grasped her hand and they apparated to a dark apartment.</p>
<p>Before she could even comprehend he was handing her potions from a cupboard, “you have to drink these,” he was saying, “especially this one” he handed her two stoppered bottles of blood replenishing potion.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand, I shouldn’t need these should I?” she stated holding them cradled in her hands.</p>
<p>“What do you remember? What year was it?” he was already asking her more questions and she could barely follow what he was trying to ask.</p>
<p>“What do you mean what year was it? It was 2006”</p>
<p>He wordlessly handed her a copy of the daily prophet.</p>
<p>April 17, 1979. “This doesn’t make any sense.” she stated.</p>
<p>“I’m aware.”</p>
<p>“How do you know me if we haven’t met yet?”</p>
<p>“I remember everything. Azkaban, you, Harry, Ron, Buckbeak. Having to live in that rotting old grungy house. Running to the ministry to help. Getting hit by a curse and falling into that archway. Everything”</p>
<p>“but we’re in the past.”</p>
<p>“I’m aware.” He ran his hands roughly through his shoulder length hair and stared at her, deep in thought. She looked back at him, appreciating how healthy he looked, how alive his eyes were. She felt like she had been surviving for so long that she had lost all concept of how life should be. It made her happy to see him looking normal. It was a strange juxtaposition.</p>
<p>He swallowed, “drink up” he stated his voice hoarse.</p>
<p>She nodded and winced as she brought the first potion to her lips, hands shaking with unspent adrenaline. He watched her, concern creasing his eyes.</p>
<p>“you were-?”</p>
<p>“in the middle of a duel.” she finished for him nodding before wincing as she took another potion. “They had fresh wizards. I don’t know how, there was no one left.” she closed her eyes as she felt the potions start to take effect. Her wounds tingled and stung.</p>
<p>She jumped when she felt a hand on her shoulder, her eyes meeting silver ones full of concern.</p>
<p>“You should sleep.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I could sleep if I tried. I’m not wired that way anymore.”</p>
<p>“you should try.”</p>
<p>She shook her head and downed another potion, getting up on shaky knees to pace the small room. He watched her warily.</p>
<p>“Guessing the war isn’t going very well.”</p>
<p>“Not really. I think we probably lost tonight.”</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, and she watched him summon some crystal tumblers and a bottle of fire whiskey, he poured them silently and handed her a glass that she took with shaky hands. She took the shot in one go, and sank to the floor again, blinking. The bottle shot forward wordlessly and she poured herself a double. Her magic sparked around her and she wiped them away tiredly. It was a bi product from the prolonged intensity of magic she had been using only hours before. It was like her body was detoxing from the sudden lack of spells.</p>
<p>“how long?”</p>
<p>“4 days”</p>
<p>His eyebrows shot up.</p>
<p>“It was supposed to be the end. Again.”</p>
<p>“and Harry?”</p>
<p>She shuddered a sigh, “he’s so tired Sirius.” tears pricked her eyes and she blinked them back, filling her glass again. She shot it back again and met his eyes.</p>
<p>“This is real?” She stated questioningly.</p>
<p>He spread his arms wide, “as far as I can tell.” he sighed and took a seat beside her. “I’ve not heard of any joint delusions ever being reported.”</p>
<p>A spark jumped off of her and landed on his jacket, he wiped it away wordlessly. Wise enough not to mention it. She was too tired to care.</p>
<p>“When did you get here?” her voice cracked but she took another sip of whiskey.</p>
<p>“Six months ago this time.” He took a deep breath, “I thought, well hell, I thought a lot of things. I thought maybe this was heaven honestly. Everyone is alive. James and Lily…” his voice trailed off and he looked at her, sitting broken on his floor. “But the war is still going on, we’re still fighting and I don’t know if I can go through it all again. The longer I’m here the more I think this might be hell? I don’t know if I can survive Azkaban again, let alone Peter betraying us and...”</p>
<p>They both watched as three patronuses flew through the window, “Mate, you never came back with lunch, what gives?” the stag stated.</p>
<p>“You ran into another bird didn’t you? She better be bloody worth it” the wolf huffed.</p>
<p>“I’m just fucking hungry” the rat snickered.</p>
<p>“I bet he’s not… any more” the stag quipped.</p>
<p>“check in though, when you come up for air” the wolf concluded with a snort.</p>
<p>They both sat in silence for a second.</p>
<p>“So… We don’t go through it again.”Hermione rasped at last getting up and walking towards the fading figures.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“We change it” Her hair sparked again as she reached towards the stag, her lips pulling into a resolute line as it dissipated from sight.</p>
<p>A smile lit his face and it was so genuine she almost took a step backwards. “Now you’re talking love, but how?” he got to his feet as well.</p>
<p>She stretched her shoulder, wincing as it made a pop. “We fight. And we fight now.”</p>
<p>“...But what about the future? Your future?”</p>
<p>“It’s a shit future Sirius. If this is the past we have a chance to save them.” Her deep brown eyes burned with intensity, and she ran a shaky hand though her grimy hair. “I can’t fucking watch that again, and they all deserve better than they got. If I can change it I will.”</p>
<p>His smile faded and he looked pensive, his gray eyes narrowed in thought.</p>
<p>“You should sleep love, then we can talk about this.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, “I already told you Sirius, I can’t sleep.”</p>
<p>He wrinkled his nose, “then a shower at least?”</p>
<p>She nodded, shuddering as she rubbed a grimy hand through her grimy hair.</p>
<p>He motioned for her to follow to the bathroom and handed her a large, clean smelling fluffy towel. The sight of the towel alone was enough to have tears pricking her eyes. She pushed them back, refusing to recall how long she had survived without the creature comforts that she had once taken for granted.</p>
<p>He left her to her own devices and she peeled off the scraps of fabric that had been scourified a couple hundred too many times and stepped into the near boiling water that filled the bathroom with thick steam.</p>
<p>The first thing she felt was pain, sharp and familiar, then heat. Her body recoiled naturally until she eased into the torrent of hot water. Her wounds throbbed and she looked down to see coils of black and red cascading down her feet and around her legs.</p>
<p>“Merlin...” she whispered squeezing her eyes shut as the memories she had been suppressing took advantage of her moment of relaxation to flood her vision.</p>
<p>She held her hand to the wall and leaned, with her good arm as she fought the urge to sob. She focused on breathing. One breath, two three four, second breath. Her heart fought against her rib cage like a caged bird, hammering doubly in her ears. “Fuck Hermione, figure it out” she berated herself, gulping another steam choked breath.</p>
<p>Ron falling, the death eater on top of him casting again already, Harry pushing bodies out of the way to get to him on time, tearing her eyes away as fear froze her. Casting an expelliarmus, and hearing the death eater Ron had been fighting beginning an Avada. Spinning against her will, Molly had lunged between them, the light leaving her eyes behind a green glow. Harry devastated fell to his knees. Not feeling as she cast a protection spell around him. Ron was howling.</p>
<p>Two three four… Hot tears fell, mixing with the shower water. Disgust welling in her chest she viciously scrubbed her hair with the masculine, clean smelling shampoo. It felt good to be so clean, and she felt guilty to feel so good. Huffing, she doubled her efforts.</p>
<p>Soon her limbs started to feel heavy. Her knees shook under the weight of her own body. She closed her eyes and saw stars. She had reached her limit. The potions she had forced down had only bought her time. Her knees gave and she she fell forward, using the last of her strength to catch herself from hitting the gilded faucet. Her world spun and she felt the contents of her stomach come up. First the fire whiskey and potions and then just great heaves of nothing. The vision around the corners of her sight darkened and then there was nothing.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>She woke up suspended in cool arms that smelled of leather and aftershave. Panicking she tried to roll, but her limbs felt like concrete.</p>
<p>“You’re alright love, relax” the deep voice rumbled through his chest and she turned to look, her vision darkening again. He had a white Ramones T shirt on, and it had damp water spots on it, she could see the darkness of a tattoo and skin underneath. He adjusted her gently and the darkness gripped her again.</p>
<p>The next time she awoke she was in a bed. The mattress below her was soft and it cradled her in a way she forgot existed. She squeezed her eyes shut and tried to imagine that maybe she was dead. When she opened them she found herself snuggled under a home made looking quilt. Her feet were in pools of sunshine coming from the near by window. Maybe he was right, she mused as a bird called from outside the window. Maybe this was heaven.</p>
<p>Her head ached and she stretched slowly, her joints cracking and popping. Her muscles protested as she slid out from under the blankets. She was dressed in a black t shirt that had tattered spots on the hem and a pair of obviously transfigured shorts. The clothes smelt delightfully of detergent and what she was beginning to recognize as Sirius. Aftershave, leather, exhaust and just the faintest whiff of mint and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Moving quietly out of habit she crept down the small wooden hallway and towards the sound of the pages of a book being flipped roughly. In a room down the hall she found him perched on a stool, his shoulder length black hair pulled back in a pony. His bottom lip jutted out in concentration and disdain as he leaned over the steaming cauldron and referenced back to the old tomb in his hand. Snorting he stirred twice and added some chopped knotgrass and changed direction of the stir to counter clockwise.</p>
<p>The potion turned a cheery yellow and his lips curved upwards in satisfaction. He snapped the book shut and rolled languidly to his feet, stretching. He was still unaware of her presence and she took the time to take in just how much younger he looked. His hip bones jutted out from under his t shirt as he stretched upwards. Lean muscular arms reached towards the ceiling. Aristocratic high cheek bones were obscured by the tendrils of black hair escaping his pony tail and his goatee was trimmed and neat. Chunky cast rings adorned his fingers, a lion head with a ruby in it’s mouth glinted in the sun light pouring from the window and tattoos covered his arms.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat and stepped into the room, unable to shake the small smile on her face at this image in front of her. He turned around and smiled back at her cautiously.</p>
<p>“Are you finished abusing that poor book now, or should I wait?” she asked, announcing her presence as she crossed her ankles and leaned against the door frame.</p>
<p>“You’re awake! Did you sleep? You sure went down like a sack of bricks.” He commented looking amused. “I was even worried for a second there until you let out this monstrous snore” he added cheekily.</p>
<p>Hermione huffed and crossed her arms, “I do not snore.” she stated scowling. His eyebrows shot up</p>
<p>“But to answer your first question, yes I did sleep.” she amended.</p>
<p>He turned and ladled the potion into a glass, “Good, I was afraid you were going to set the bed on fire, and not in the good way.” he stated wiggling his eyebrows. “I made you this, it should help to even out your magic, and hopefully replenish some of your energy.”</p>
<p>Hermione took the offered cup dubiously.</p>
<p>“I’m not all shite at potions you know, as long as I stay focused.” He commented, taking in her expression.</p>
<p>She took a preemptive sniff and was pleasantly surprised when it smelled of honey and crushed mint. She took a sip and was immediately warmed.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely not the worst potion I’ve ever had” she commented finding a stool and perching on it. She placed the glass delicately beside her and ran her hands through her chin length hair.</p>
<p>“Worst one?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I think it will always be polyjuice for me. What about you?”</p>
<p>“Animagus potion, hands down.”</p>
<p>Hermione wrinkled her nose and took another sip of potion. Silence stretched between them and she was very aware that he was taking in her posturing even though he hid it by stoppering vials of the fresh potion.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath. “I meant what I said Sirius.”</p>
<p>He looked up at her, his eyes questioning.</p>
<p>“About the future.”</p>
<p>He shook his head, “you could never be born you know.”</p>
<p>“I’m already here. There really is no alternative that I can see. Even if I somehow managed to get back to the right time line...” She took a deep breath “I can’t stand to see my friends hurt anymore. Harry and Ron… they were barely recognizable. Everyone was dead or scarred. Not to mention, I’m dead in that time line so there really seems to be no other option.”</p>
<p>“I need to know everything.”</p>
<p>She nodded, wincing as she realized the prospect of having to talk about all that she witnessed “I’ll tell you.” It was becoming a very real thing that she had just been picked up and plunked into a world where she no longer had a place to be. She took a deep shuddering breath and reached for her wand in her shorts pocket, letting the familiar feeling of the wood in her hand comfort the hammering of her heart in her rib cage.</p>
<p>His eyes darkened with concern and he plunked back down on the stool. “I think I can get my hands on a pensive if I play my cards right.”</p>
<p>She took another deep breath, “yeah, that would probably be the best way.” She bit her lip, tapping her wand against her opposite hand, thinking.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to find a place to stay, and I need books...”</p>
<p>She looked up with a wince when she felt a warm hand on her shoulder, utterly startled, “Hermione.” Grey eyes met hers.</p>
<p>“Obviously you’re staying here. Don’t be daft. One breath at a time.” His eyes moved to his hand on his shoulder, “Merlin you’re skinny” he muttered. He stepped back, shoving his hands in his jeans pockets and forcing a smile. His dark hair glowed with just a touch of red as it hit the light pouring from the window.</p>
<p>“You’re not high and dry here, alright? You never will be. I have an extra room that you’re welcome to, and anything you need. I’ll introduce you to James and Lils, and you already know Moony, even if he doesn’t know you” he smirked.</p>
<p>“I know it’s not the same but...” his voice trailed off and his shoulder raised and fell.</p>
<p>Hermione tried to smile but it faltered. “I don’t know if I’m ready to meet them just yet.” she took a seat on the stool beside his and let her eyes wander the room, trying to focus on anything but what she was saying. “I don’t even know myself any more. I think I just need some time alone to… re calibrate?”</p>
<p>Sirius took a second and then nodded, “I think I understand.”</p>
<p>“Thank you”</p>
<p>Hermione looked down at the floor, thoughts still buzzing. Then it hit her. “Shit!” she stated standing, “When did you say it was again?” she asked</p>
<p>“April, 1979, why?”</p>
<p>“Regulus.”</p>
<p>His eyebrows raised, “Reggie? The fuck does that little traitor have to do with anything”</p>
<p>She met his eyes, chin raising. “Everything Sirius”</p>
