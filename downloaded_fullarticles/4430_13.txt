</p><p>Draco, bright red from his blush, looked up and locked eyes with Harry across the bull pen. </p><p>Harry who was watching him with a smug grin. He threw a kiss.</p><p>Pinching his lips, Draco turned over the paper.</p><p>
  <i>Red and white stripes<br/>The color your skin turns<br/>When I've spent all night<br/>Spanking you for misbehaving</i>
</p><p>Ha! Take that, Draco thought. He sent it over with an evil smirk and unwrapped one of the candy canes. He looked up through his eye lashes and found his note being fought over. Harry looked embarrassed.</p><p><i>Serves him right</i> Honestly, what was he thinking of, sending that note in the morning mail? Draco shook his head and went back to his paperwork.</p></div>
