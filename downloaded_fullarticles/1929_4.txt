  <p>Bellatrix Black. She was born 11th october 1951 to Cygnus Black III and Druella Black née Rosier. It was a truly delicious scandal. The Blacks' young 13 years old boy left the 20 year old Druella pregnant. The ladies smiled behind fine tea cups while making sharp remarks of how lucky the dear Druella had been. Marrying in such a good family.</p>
  <p><br/> After the prior dreadful scandal that put her maidenhood to question, no respectable pureblood family scion had come forth for an engagement proposal. It was such a pity at first, Druella's good looks not being bred, the ladies tittered. But who could have known, saccharine smiles dripping poison carefully hidden behind the china whispered, that the Black boy would be stupid enough to actually leave her pregnant.</p>
  <p>Of course the whole affair was kept quite hush hush but the little baby bump was quite obvious. White was a dreadful color when you tried to hide something.<br/> The whore and the boy groom. It was frankly hilarious.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Pollux was livid when he found out about it. Cygnus brought his bride-to-be to the family manor, breaking the oh so happy new. He immediately questioned Cygnus in his office, leaving Druella in the foyer to be entertained by Irma. Pollux locked eyes on his son. Cygnus looked like a kneazle bringing corpses of small animals to it's master, you could see smug satisfaction shining in the boys' eyes. Well, thought Pollux, feeling proud are we now.</p>
  <p>His hands were shacking with anger. Pollux went for the tumbler with the firewhiskey and poured himself two generous fingers. After finishing his drink in quick mouthfuls all the anger was drained and what was left was resignation.</p>
  <p>The family curse showed young in Cygnus. Blood breeds true in the end and the Black madness touches all Blacks. They are all doomed, he thought gloomy. Pollux would have to go with Cygnus to apply for emancipation and then go to the goblin bank and have the inheritance paper drawn up. Pollux decided to give him the Chatsworth estate. It had been closed off for quite some time and Alphard already said he didn't want it. It was perfect that way.</p>
  <p>As for money, Pollux didn't plan to give him that much, a few thousands galleons should tide Druella and Cygnus over until the small businesses they will inherit from the Rosier side will kick in. And at that point they should have nothing to do with the Black family.</p>
  <p>Pollux could feel the anger trickle little by little and in the end they had a shouting match complete with threatening wand waving and vows of never speaking again. Merlin, thought Pollux, Cygnus didn't even have his OWL levels yet.</p>
  <p>Irma had no opinion over the whole thing. It was what it was. In the end she'd get a grandchild and it wasn't like her and Pollux were particularly wiser regarding the proper age for such things.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The wedding took place, the biggest event of the year of course, and anyone worth knowing in the pureblood society was present. Of course including the whole of the Black family. Even darling Dorea with her Potter husband had shown up. The pregnancy was easy but Druella was never able to bring herself to love it. All she could think of was her loss and the bitter taste of resignation.</p>
  <p>She was strong armed throughout the whole ordeal and she could feel the acidic taste of bitterness on the back of her tongue. Druella may have been dripping in finery, silks and jewelry but all she could concentrate on was how stupid she had been.</p>
  <p>Allowing Cygnus discover the pregnancy before being able to abort was the biggest mistake of her life. Well not truly, meeting Cygnus at all took the first place. Druella had no idea how she didn't realize she was manipulated. She thought she was playing the game when in all honesty she didn't even see the board.</p>
  <p>Druella just spent the rest of the wedding viciously sick with the low boiling anger and shame, not paying attention to the ceremony or the party. After the first few faux pas she was silently herded in a seat at a table somewhere off side and left to stew.<br/> Cygnus looked throughout it all so infuriatingly smug that Druella was left at the end of it all with a bone deep weariness.</p>
  <p>She was looking forward to the end of the whole debacle and for Cygnus to slink off back to Hogwarts. Hopefully she would get some blessed isolation that way and she could make carefully subtle overtures to insert herself back into the pureblood society. As far as things were standing she was a bit of pariah. A parvenu, if not in fact then in spirit.</p>
  <p>They all were acting so condescending towards her purely out of jealousy. Marrying higher and marrying younger. A pox on all of them, Druella sneered towards her thoughts. If she could somehow shove off this on someone else she would. But now that the pregnancy was made known to the rest of the family she had no chance.</p>
  <p>Her and Cygnus' little game was small pebbles in comparison to what the head of the family would do if she killed a member. Druella felt a shiver while thinking about the rumors of a special dungeon in the ancestral manor. While a bit ridiculous it was said they had a dark artifact that would keep the victim exactly on the edge of death without allowing it to pass over.</p>
  <p>It was frankly disgusting and a portent of what her future life could be like. She had to make friends to survive. They wouldn't dare let that kind of distasteful rumors wag around so she would be granted some amnesty. Druella felt her breathing shortening and her heart beating harder and harder.</p>
  <p>She called out to Ditta, her maiden house elf, and retired to the house after sending word of her having a bit of a dizzy spell caused by all the excitement. All bogus. Merlin, she could not wait for all of this to end.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A few months after the wedding, sitting in her new bedroom at the Chatsworth estate, Druella realized she was being purposefully avoided by the other witch ladies. Druella watched her owl return with yet another of her letters.</p>
  <p>Druella was beyond the stage of anger and she was downright terrified at the moment. This all spelled bad tidings of what her future would be like. She would have no choice but to rely on Cygnus and that was a harder fact to swallow than even when she first found out about the pregnancy. Her family was just a side branch of the Rosier but even if it weren't so, the main line wouldn't offend the Blacks just for a foolish girl. From their part she could be boiled and eaten away with. What did it matter to them indeed.</p>
  <p><br/> The gorgeous estate and the money did nothing to improve Druella's mood. Cygnus was back at Hogwarts, in the process of obtaining his OWLs and NEWTs grades so he could obtain the board member seat from the family. Just more power he wanted to obtain so he could restrict her options.</p>
  <p>That was an amusing thought though. Options. As if she had any, now with the latest revelations of being frosted out by the ladies in good standing. Curse the Blacks, they were all a plague on earth. And now Druella would give birth to another one.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><br/> The months passed just so and the her due date came closer and closer. At that point it was something of a relief. Druella would remember the birth even more vividly because it was the day she saw her omen of death. Right as she was reclining in the sun alcove by the window breathing some of the october air, a handsome black augurey perched on the window sill crying sadly at her. Right on cue the contractions started and the house-elf apparated and whisked her off to St. Mungo's.</p>
  <p><br/> The birth was difficult, lengthy and painful. Sitting on the hospital bed and hearing the tiny wails Druella felt empty. It was the beginning of the end of her life.<br/> And so Druella remembered 11th october as the day when she started to hate Bellatrix.</p>
