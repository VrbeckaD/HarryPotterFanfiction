    <p>They say that any epic work, a work that tells of heroic doings and dangers, ought to begin with an invocation to the muses. As I am a historian and an alchemist rather than a skald of any kind, the reader must forgive me my shortcomings in not relaying this invocation in verse. Not one of us wants to see me attempt poetry of any sort. I also find it ridiculous that anyone would be so foolish as to call upon a power that one knows nothing about. The muses surely have better things to do than be invoked every other day by some new artist, who probably won't even finish the work they have set out to do. Nevertheless, I found myself bound by practices far older than even I am.<br/> <br/> So, with that grain of salt, allow me to say that I pray to whatever muses or gods may exist that I may prove worthy to the task before me. This is, of course, relaying the history of the greatest age that wizardry has seen in a thousand years, what most scholars are now referring to as the Crucible Era. It remains to be seen whether this will lead us in to a second Golden Age of Wizardry, but most signs indeed point to such an occurrence.<br/> <br/> This era was ushered in mainly by the journeys of three individuals and their friends: the Dark, Light, and Grey Lords, risen from obscurity and into living legends once more. The Grey Lord's account is most prevalent for several reasons, and due to this, it is the account with which we will begin.<br/> <br/> Surely the Three Lords, however, must have had the gods guiding them. Someone must have helped them out along the way, for however else would we have managed to come out to where we are today?<br/> <br/> I think at this point in our people's history, a little candor and transparency might be appreciated. In that case, I would like to reveal my methods of data collection to you as well as my biases. Not only do I know Lord Harry James Potter, Earl of Griffon's Nest, as well as the other two Lords, but I greatly like him and consider him a personal friend as well as a protégé. In that way, you can see that our histories are intertwined. At points, this is my history as much as it is the history of the return of the Three Lords and the restoration of true magic to English wizards, after we very nearly lost it in the years prior to the Three Lords' return.<br/> <br/> By piecing together Pensieve memories and personal accounts from all three Lords, I have made my attempt to form a history true to how they saw it. I would like to point out that history is, as told by the word itself, nothing more than a story which most agree did happen. Whether that history is "truly" true or whether it has been unduly influenced by each Lord's own biases is up to later generations to decide….<br/> <br/> -- Nicolas Flamel, <em>The Return of the Three Lords: A History of English Magic</em>, p.1-2</p>
