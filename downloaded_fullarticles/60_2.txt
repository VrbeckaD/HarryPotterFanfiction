    <p>So basically, quarantine got me fucked up, and the past year I've been thinking about and planning this entire story and a possible spin-off if I ever finish this. I'm rewriting the first chapters because the first one is okay and the second one kinda sucks. Some of the tags on this work don't apply to the new one. I have the ending planned out and a lot of the middle and basically be prepared for a lot of bad writing and me trying to remember what it was like to be actively suicidal (also projecting my addicts personality onto Draco so I can live like an alcoholic vicariously through him)</p>
