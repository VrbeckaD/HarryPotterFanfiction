  <em>Ooh, you used to be a mean kid</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mm, making such a deal of life</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ooh, you were wishing and hoping and waiting</em>
</p><p>
  <em>To really hit the big time</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But did it happen, happen?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No, you're speeding too fast</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Slow down, slow down, you'd better slow down</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Slow down</em>
</p><p>~</p><p>Somewhere outside Kershope forest, along the border of Scotland, a milkman was starting his rounds. It had been an especially scorching week for July, but John was grateful that the humidity hadn’t set in yet for the day as the sun rose. John Armstrong exited his lonning in his van onto the B road heading towards Newcastleton, lined with dry stone walls, wilting bracken and the odd farm steading. He was enjoying a particularly animated version of O Fortuna on Classic FM, while he steered with one hand and drank his tea in the other, speeding past yellowing fields of wild grass and waking sheep.</p><p>About a mile ahead, lying amongst the bracken a lone wizard, recently turned werewolf, was battling to stay conscious after a traumatic first transformation. Images of mossy trees and the torn ligaments of a deer’s left haunch flashed in his mind while the scent of iron, pine and new leaves jarred his senses. He jolted upright and tried to lift his arm, inducing white hot pain through his shivering body.</p><p>Quickly glancing down, he saw his arm was limp, a crusty gash ran up his forearm to meet his dislocated shoulder.</p><p>Taking deep breaths to calm himself down, he took in his surroundings. Realising he was without his wand he felt vulnerable, exposed and acutely aware of his isolation. The forest was out of the question, too freshly stained with horror, but the scene before him was equally unfamiliar.</p><p>All of a sudden, the wizard heard a faint rumbling in the distance as the Armstrong’s family van truckled along the scarred country road. The wizard knew that this muggle was his greatest chance of getting home. So ass to the wind, he hauled his battered and blood splattered body towards the dry stone wall.</p><p>Inside the van, the were drums sounding and the choir was screeching at full volume, when John noticed a gory, dislocated arm swing over the wall a few yards in front of his van. Throwing his tea in the air, swearing profusely as the scalding liquid seeped into his workmen’s jeans, he gripped the steering wheel with both hands and promptly veered off the road into the ditch.</p><p>Horrified, he locked the doors and revved the engine to escape the shrubbery, when he found his eyes locked with a rather red pair of teenage ones. The boy had landed in the ferns below and was yelling a series of strange obscenities before panting and lying still. John was frozen in his seat with shock, watching the boy’s shallow breaths condense in the morning air.</p><p>What had been a rather good start to the morning had turned into something from a cheap, paperback gothic novel. Dazed, he slowly opened the van door, heaved himself off his seat and went to check on the boy.</p><p>Bending down to feel the clammy forehead of the teen with the back of his hand, John asked</p><p>“Y’ alright?”</p><p>A groan was his answer.</p><p>“Let's get you off to the GP then laddie.”</p><p>Peering up at John with one eye open, a brief look of confusion took over the boy’s features. After looking at him for another two seconds John added, “Maybe I should lend you a jumper?”. He received a slow nod of the affirmative nature and John went to the van to get his spare fleece.</p><p>Slowly easing the teen into a sitting position, he edged the fleece over his head and supported his weight with his arms. He then lifted the boy to his feet, and was grateful to see the fleece had preserved his modesty until his knobbly knees. A few shaky steps and they were in the van and off to the GP’s house with four pints of milk and a medical emergency.</p><p>-</p><p>The young werewolf slowly became aware of his surroundings as he squinted his eyes in the harsh white light. He was lying in a narrow bed with crisp, white sheets pulled tightly over him and the sharp smell of chemicals overwhelmed him.</p><p>He felt like death incarnate as his head throbbed along to the pounding of his heart and his hair clung to his sweaty forehead.</p><p>Apart from the bed he was currently in, there was little to no furniture and the white door of his room was firmly shut.</p><p>The walls were bare and painted a creamy shade of white, the carpeted floor was a sickly green sort of colour, and a large window to his left let natural light filter through mesh curtains.</p><p>Blinking as his eyes adjusted to the brightness of the room, he suddenly felt keenly embarrassed and exposed, and glanced down to see that he was indeed still wearing the fleece he’d been put into earlier that morning. A wave of shame overwhelmed him as he thought of someone seeing him so vulnerable and defenceless.</p><p>Peeling back the covers, he eased himself out of the creaking bed. A pile of muggle clothes were left on a chair and he hurriedly put them on. He then made his way towards the closed window and saw that he was on the ground floor, so he pushed open the window and left the clinic.</p><p>There isn’t much to Newcastleton, there never was and never will be, but in ‘92 Eir Timmings opened a music store called The Glass Onion, and that’s where the wizard found himself. Timmings looked like the late Kurt Cobain, complete with shaggy hair, Dr Martens and a Harley Davidson. His height caused him to be permanently hunched over to duck the beams in the shop. The Glass Onion smelt of damp musk due to Eir’s consistent use of dope in the upstairs apartment, and occasionally on a quiet day, behind the till.</p><p>Eir was opening the shop when he saw the kid outside, just staring listlessly at the hand painted sign. It struck him that he must have looked like that once too, and went outside to offer him a cup of tea.</p><p>“Y’alright, lad? Want a cuppa?”</p><p>The wizard stared at the muggle before muttering a yes and following Eir inside. The wizard ignored Eir who was trying to question him, as he looked astonished moving through the shop. The record player was blaring some tunes and the wizard interrupted Eir to ask what was playing.</p><p>“You don’t know this song? It’s ‘With A Little Help From My Friends’ by The Beatles! It’s a fucking classic, man!”</p><p>The wizard looked at him and decided it was best not to ask how it was being played, afraid of the indignant tone. Eir wondered what kind of a person would’ve managed to escape Beatlemania and decided that the boy couldn’t leave his shop without some musical education.</p><p>“Where are you from? You sound funny.”</p><p>The wizard looked appalled at Eir’s direct attitude for a moment, before answering that he indeed was not a local.</p><p>“You haven’t run away have you? Look I know parents and life can get bad but running away or getting hooked on smack is never the answer.”</p><p>He gives the young wizard a pointed look. At this point, the boy just nodded not understanding ‘smack’ but was stunned that this slightly grubby man knew he was struggling. No one ever seen through him like this before.</p><p>“What’s your name then lad? I’m Eir, the owner of this fine shop. Curator of music and brownies.”</p><p>Quietly the wizard introduced himself, “I am Draco Malfoy, could you show me some more music?”</p>
