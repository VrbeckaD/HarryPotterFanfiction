    <p>They were prisoners of war. Sons and daughters of all those who opposed the Dark Lord.</p><p>They were being punished because they bore the weight of the sins of their fathers and mothers. Their skulls were mounted around their quaint cage as a constant reminder not to disobey.</p><p>Memories of them were faint, and yet daily they were reminded that they carried tainted blood, and would never be good for anything but sacrifice. A sacrifice to the pure, and that they must consider it an honor that the Empire even finds good use for them.</p><p>Harry Potter was one of the many children in the orphanage. Day and night, they are constantly told to accept their fate. It was not bad at all, and those who have long given in wholeheartedly accept this thinking and simply live their lives to the fullest even though they were living in a <em>dream</em>.</p><p>It was a veritable paradise, cut off from the rest of the world. He lived in a castle. Around them, there were hills, and a lake. There was even a forest, and occasionally they were allowed to use a broom that could never ever leave the walls.</p><p>It was never cold, and never too hot. Sometimes it rained, but they were usually filled with sunny days that made it perfect for running around and playing. They had large rooms, personal servants and fed the best food. They were given gifts, and clothed in a very comfortable white garment.</p><p>And yet there was a constant reminder.</p><p>There were high walls, and above them, invisible walls that they could cross. Stationed around the walls were soul sucking monsters, dementors, and he’s seen what happened to children who ever dared to run away. They were kissed, and they were alive, in the worst sense.</p><p>They slowly deteriorate, and their bodies rot, and they were left in the open.</p><p>As an example.</p><p>Like the skulls mounted on the walls.</p><p>It was a paradise.</p><p>Their guardians are taking care of them, like precious jewels. They are spoiled rotten, their beds soft and silky, their baths warm. They are never sick for too long, and they are never without a companion. It was easy to forget that it was all a farce.</p><p>It was mercy. Lord Voldemort declared it, and mandated the children must never forget. It was etched in the passages of the castle,</p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em>For He was Merciful and thus You Live</em> </strong>
</p><p>They can have what they want, except perhaps for freedom.</p><p>They learn magic, but only the basic magic, enough to do the small things like make his bed, or shine light in the darkness.</p><p>But Harry hated it, every single moment of it.</p><p>He could remember, in the vaguest sense, that his parents died of green light, and the monster that they call God, that they praise so highly, was their murderer, and Harry was alive, when he should have died..</p><p>Harry Potter had no scar. He is eight, and so full of dreams.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>They were saying goodbye to Hermione who has officially graduated from the orphanage. She was smiling and proud as their masked guardians said, “She will be useful to the Empire.”</p><p>All the two hundred children within the hall chorused, “Long live the Empire.”</p><p>Hermione gathered her stuff. A lone brown bag, and a bear. Everyone was trying to hug her and tell her that they’ll miss her. It was unheard of that someone so young would be taken so early but Harry knew Hermione was special. She was the brightest witch of their age, and was exceptional even if at first, she tried to hide it. Their guardians often lamented her “breed”.</p><p>But not Harry.</p><p>He already had the chance to cry his heart out the day before, because Hermione was his best friend, and he’d rather not cry when she’s about to be taken away to god knows where.</p><p>They never return, and from the stories he’d heard from the older children, it’s best not to ask where they go.</p><p>Harry took one last glance, and nodded at Hermione who looked as if she was about to burst into tears. She clearly didn’t want to go. He walked the opposite direction, heading for his next class.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Harry, what are you doing?”</p><p>Harry looked up and saw his best friend look at him from across the table.</p><p>“I’m drawing,” Harry pushed up his glasses and hid his drawing from view.</p><p>“Let me see!” The boy leaned from across the table.</p><p>“No Ron. It’s private.”</p><p>“Show it to me. Come on, Harry.”</p><p>Harry shook his head, and grabbed his things. He started running away. Ron chased after him and saw one of the professors, “Professor Avery! Harry’s hiding something! I saw it.”</p><p>Ron blinked when the professor leaned down and murmured, “Show me?”</p><p>Harry saw this, and ran away. He ran with all his might, opening the large doors and started heading to a spot by the forest.</p><p>It could have been several minutes, and he was exhausted, but it was as if there was this boundless well of energy that just made him to want to run away, even when his breathing was coming in short gasps and his heart wanted to burst out of his chest. It was beating so fast. He kept running.</p><p>He didn’t really understand it, why he tried to hide such a small thing. It was just a drawing of him flying over a wall. What was so bad about that? It wasn’t like a drawing would get him to trouble but he just wanted to keep it to himself.</p><p>In his haste, he tripped on a branch, and closed his eyes, wondering if he’d fall.</p><p>He fell, head first, into something not quite hard.</p><p>Arms, wrapped around him, and Harry looked up, expecting one of their guardians but he what he saw made him double back.</p><p>A tall hooded man with haunting red eyes. Harry felt a chill travel through his spine, and he involuntarily froze, as if he was face to face with a predator.</p><p>“Are you alright?” His voice was soft, and lilting.</p><p>Harry nodded slowly, wary of the stranger. The stranger took off his hood and Harry felt breath leave him as he looked at a face of an adult man and not just a decapitated head, tracing his features, from the curve of his nose, the angle of his jaw, and smile. His face was pale, and his smile was kind. It was disarming for Harry who’s only interactions with adults were that of masked Death Eaters pretending to be their guardians.</p><p>True kindness was unheard of.</p><p>“You dropped this,”</p><p>His crumpled drawing came floating into view and straightening itself. The stranger slowly turned it to face Harry and Harry felt guilt and embarrassment.</p><p>Harry tore it in midair. “Don’t… don’t tell anyone.”</p><p>The man smiled at him, removed his glasses and began wiping his face with a conjured handkerchief.</p><p>“I’ll keep it a secret if you promise to answer my questions. Don’t cry.”</p><p>Harry blinked at this, blind, and wiped at his eyes noticing for the first time that his fingers were damp, “when did… I…”</p><p>“Child, what’s your name?”</p><p>Harry gathered himself, and fought through the tightening of his throat, “Harry. Just Harry.”</p><p>Harry felt compelled to say it, and it was out of his mouth before he could stop himself, as if the earlier discomfort was gone.</p><p>“Harry, you have very pretty eyes. Has anyone ever told you that? Come, walk with me. I will show you something special.”</p><p>His glasses were placed gently onto his face.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>He walked hand in hand with the strange man. Harry felt as if his head was stuffed and it was a pleasant feeling, as if he was walking around with a large comforter wrapped all around him.</p><p>Pretty soon, they were suddenly face to face with the steps of the wall. “Are you sure this is okay, mister? We’re never allowed to go here.” Harry took a step back, unsure. He was ready to run and shout for help.</p><p>“Call me Tom, Harry.”</p><p>The man held out his hand, and Harry felt his head hurt, unable to pull away. There was something wrong. Terribly wrong.</p><p>“Tom, can we go slower… I’m tired.”</p><p>Tom looked at him, red eyes narrowing, “then I’ll have to carry you.”</p><p>Harry blinked at this and nodded. He didn’t know why he could trust this man so easily. They’ve been warned never to trust strangers, and Harry asked out loud, “Tom… are you part of the rebellion? They told us not to trust strangers… but you don’t seem like you’re… bad. You wear the dark mark on your cloak… so maybe–” “It’s nice to know your guardians are still useful for something. Harry, I’m not a traitor. Far from that. We’re almost there.”</p><p>“Where are we going?” Harry yawned, and pressed his head closer to the crook of Tom’s neck.</p><p>“You wanted to see what is beyond the wall right? I am simply taking you there.”</p><p>Harry immediately felt scared, “No. Stop. That’s not allowed… They’ll punish me… Please don’t take me there.”</p><p>“Relax.”</p><p>Harry suddenly felt boneless and scared because he could hardly move.</p><p>They climbed three floors, and beyond, there was a mirrored room, where Tom wrote a series of runes. Harry could only watch, a prisoner in his own body as a large arc opened and shimmering platform appeared.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Once they stepped into the middle, Harry felt as if he would throw up, when everything around him compressed.</p><p>They appeared in the middle of a large platform. They were at the top of the wall, and dozens of men and women dressed in dark robes immediately began kneeling on the floor.</p><p>Tom waved a hand and they stood up.</p><p>“My Lord. Welcome back.”</p><p>A woman with curly black hair greeted.</p><p>At this he slowly brought Harry down, until Harry found his feet on the floor.</p><p>Harry felt a spell wash over and all of a sudden he found that he could move again, but he dared not to. He was intelligent enough to know who this person was.</p><p>“How is this year’s harvest?” Tom asked, in a bored tone.</p><p>“From the seven farms, we found one that is suitable for breeding and service to the empire. Twenty-one will serve as feed to the magic vault. Would you like to meet them?” The man gestured behind them, and twenty-two children were all wearing the white dress robes of the orphanage. Hermione was unconscious inside a glass tank. Her hair was floating around her and she looked as if she was dead.</p><p>Harry almost ran to her, but there was suddenly a hand, tightening around his shoulder. Harry felt his knees go weak. Questions were threatening to burst out of his throat but he knew he shouldn’t say anything. These men and women began talking as if they were nothing but mere cattle.</p><p>The rest of the children were bleeding on the floor as various metallic contraptions were slowly being pierced into their skin.</p><p>“Good. Come, Harry.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>There was an endless abyss on the other side of the wall. It was all an illusion.</p><p>Harry stood on the edge of a round platform, and either side of him was darkness. A fall of that height would definitely kill him.</p><p>Before him, the Dark Lord smiled cruelly and dared him, “I can grant you your wish, Harry. Here’s a broom, and beyond you, freedom. Come on, take it.”</p><p>The broom floated beside him.</p><p>It was cold, ice hit his face and he was freezing, with no cloak, or anything to keep him warm. His hands were drying up, and he felt the tears come once more.</p><p>“I let you go. Am I not kind, Harry?”</p><p>Harry curled on the floor, his teeth were chattering and he tried to hug himself.</p><p>“Please… don’t… don’t… kill me, My Lord… I’m s-sorry.”</p><p>Harry was shaking, and the Dark Lord frowned, “Harry… I told you to call me Tom, remember?”</p><p>Harry hiccupped, “Tom… I don’t… -w-want to… leave. Please…”</p><p>“What is this? How merciful do you want me to be, Harry? We have provided everything, to keep you safe, clothed, warm and fed. Is it not enough that I am now granting you freedom? Do you need help? I can push you off. Will that perhaps, make you happy?”</p><p>Harry could feel the winds howl but the words cut across the noise, echoing in his head.</p><p>“No… no… was… wrong… sorry… please… don’t…”</p><p>Harry looked up, and all he could see was the white flurry of snow. He felt heavier, as if he was being weighed down with it, and it was just so. Cold.</p><p>“don’t…”</p><p>Slowly, Harry accepted that he was just some stupid child who desired freedom too much when he knew he didn’t deserve it. He thought about all the people he’s met. He thought of Ron, and his guardians who cared for him in their own way.</p><p>Yes… he’d been ungrateful because in comparison, he was never hurt so severely.</p><p>He knew death.</p><p>He saw it with the animals. He saw it with the children foolish enough to try to escape.</p><p>He knew that being out in the cold… will kill him. There was no other way.</p><p>“Please… Tom,” came his small whisper.</p><p>Tom smiled, and spread his arms out wide, “Then come here, Harry.”</p><p>Harry could feel his vison waning, but he began the slow crawl, towards the Dark Lord.</p><p>“Good boy.”</p><p>When he reached the Dark Lord, the man caressed his face, combing through his hair before wrenching it upwards, “Know that I will never let you go.” There was a wand that ripped the top part of his robe. The man gleefully cast, “Mosmorde.”</p><p>That was the start of a nightmare.</p>
