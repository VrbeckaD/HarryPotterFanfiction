    <p>“You know you don’t have to act like an asshole?” Amy asked when her friend joined her after turning down a Slytherin girl. “You could have said no instead of talking about how someone that amazing like Beca Mitchell won’t date someone that ugly like that girl who by the way was quite pretty”<br/>
“What is wrong with you Amy? I don’t do dates. Everyone knows it and it’s fucking annoying when they keep asking me out” Beca snapped “Potions now, right?”<br/>
Amy nodded, they went down stairs and saw Slytherins and Gryffindors waiting for the teacher. The two girls joined Cynthia and started talking about the quidditch match that was going to happen next Friday. Beca was really excited about it. She loved quidditch, she was the seeker,  the best their team had in few years, like everyone was saying. How couldn’t she be the best when her father was quidditch captain when he was at Hogwarts? What else she was great at? Yeah, charms of course. She was at the top of the dueling club. It was her talent, the brunette was better even than older students. The door opened and it roused Beca from her thoughts.<br/>
“Welcome, students.” Said professor Slughorn, letting them in. After everyone had taken their places, he spoke again “Today we’re gonna do draught of peace. Open the book at page 113 and good luck”<br/>
Beca tried her best but after an hour her potion still hadn’t turned turquoise. The teacher noticed it “Did you add a moonstone?” he asked with sad smile. Fuck. She HAD to forget about something. “Maybe someone could help you with this? Miss Beale?” The redhead turned her head as she heard her name. The meaning of the words just came to her and she was terrified about teachers idea. Why me.<br/>
Why her? There are many of slytherins but Slughorn had to choose fucking half-blood.<br/>
Chloe came slowly to Beca’s Cauldron. She quickly added something and the color changed.<br/>
“You are welcome” said the girl with a fancy smile. Her friend, Aubrey, laughed and Beca looked at her angrily.<br/>
“What are you laughing at? What is so funny about me? Or maybe you laughing at Beale? Yeah, I laugh at her sometimes too. Her nose is just so big and it looks odd.” The slytherin girl said, making sure the teacher won’t hear her.<br/>
“It’s funny that you suck at potions. You fail everytime.” The blonde responded and Beca raised her eyebrows. Nobody was allowed to talk to her like that. On her face showed up a rude smile.<br/>
“Don’t you dare talk to me this way, you mudblood” unfortunately, her voice was louder than she expected. The whole class heard her. Aubrey blinked back tears.<br/>
“What did you just said?” Chloe shouted “You fu-“ suddenly the teacher shut her down.<br/>
“Miss Beale, Mitchell and miss Posen, come with me”<br/>
“Professor, that wasn’t my fault. They start-“ Beca panicked. She can’t get suspension. Not again. Not because of it.<br/>
“Quiet. I don’t care whose fault it was. You don’t discriminate people because of their blood. Hogwart is a safe place to everyone. As I heard, it wasn’t first time you called someone like that.” Girls never saw their teacher like that, he was angry, very angry. He was ignoring the Gryffindor girls, talking only to Beca. “I don’t have a choice. You are out of the team.”<br/>
WHAT<br/>
“No, please, you can’t do it. We won’t win the cup without me. You KNOW it. Each and every slytherin will hate me. Just because I called a mudblood a mudblood?” She was crying. It wasn’t happening. Someone wake her from this nightmare. She got kicked out from a team? She won’t be able to play quidditch? This game was the only reason she liked it here.<br/>
“Stop it. As long as you won’t feel guilty about it, you are not welcome in the team.”<br/>
“I will apologize to her” Beca turned her head in Aubrey’s direction “I’m sorry. I really am. I didn’t mean it” she looked back at Slughorn “see? We are good. I can clean toilets. Every toilet in the castle. But let me play. I will do anything”<br/>
“We aren’t negotiating, Miss Mitchell. Our lesson is over” Now he was speaking to all of them “Go to your next classes” he noticed that Beca was opening her mouth so he looked at her “Our conversation is over. Good bye Miss Mitchell.”<br/>
-<br/>
Next day was terrible for Chloe. And it was only the beginning. Everyone in Slytherin heard about the fight between her and Beca. They lost their seeker and they were blaming her for it. During the breakfast someone spilt a juice on her.<br/>
“Tergeo” said Aubrey, pointing her wand at Chloe’s robe. “Idiots. You should be careful. I wonder why don’t they put their hate on me. It’s mostly my fault.”<br/>
“I guess they don’t know the whole story. Or they are just scared that the Headmaster will punish them same as Slughorn punished Beca.” Redhead said and started eating scrambled eggs that she just put on her plate.<br/>
After 10 minutes she left the Great Hall. Classes were starting in 2 hours so she made her way to the meadow to prepare herself for transfiguration. She sat in her favorite place, where she could observe everything. The weather was quite warm, sky was clear, there was no single cloud on it. Nearby was a couple, making out on the grass. She was looking at quidditch pitch, where she spotted someone flying fast around the goal posts. This distraction caused changing a worm into circular rock. She laughed. Yeah, this looks a lot like an apple.<br/>
-<br/>
“You are not allowed to play quidditch, you’re gonna get into troubles.”<br/>
“I was kicked out of the team. I’m not banned from flying” said Beca when she was near her friend. “How could he do it. It’s not fair. We can’t lose the cup this year. Throw!” she shouted and Amy threw up a small ball, which was quickly catched by Beca.<br/>
“Nice. These Gryffindors will get what they deserve.”<br/>
“I bet it. I don’t know what I can do about it. Maybe I’ll tell my mother.” She came down from her broomstick. “She knows the Minister, there must be something he could do about it”<br/>
Amy did a strange face.<br/>
“What?”<br/>
“Nothing… Oh alright. Maybe you should try to be nicer?”<br/>
“Excuse me? You don’t want to say that I should treat everyone better? People suck, Amy, you know that. You and Cynthia are the ones that I trust and nothing is gonna change it”<br/>
“You should get over her” Amy said quietly, not sure how the brunette will react.<br/>
Beca looked at her. She was angry because her friend just started talking about something that she shouldn’t be talking about. Her girlfriend. Her exgirlfriend. The one she loved so much.  The one she was left by at the end of the summer. Alex. She was two years older than Beca. They met before the start of the second year thanks to their parents and fell deeply in love. Alex was the student of Ilvermony so they were staying in touch only by owl post. The distance was too hard for Alex so she was the one who decided this relationship has to end. From this time, Beca started to treat people even worse than she already had. She couldn’t trust people anymore.<br/>
“Don’t talk about her. It’s over and I do not love her. Yeah, she had hurt me. A lot. But it’s over. Let’s go.” She started walking to the castle. “And Amy”<br/>
“Yeah?” The blonde girl looked at her apologizingly.<br/>
“Don’t talk about Alex ever again” she poked her friend a little and they both laughed.<br/>
-<br/>
After their classes, Beca headed to the dueling club. It was fun to watch people trying hard to beat her. The rules should be changed because no one who was older than Beca could challenge her. Really stupid rule. Of course, from time to time, Beca was challenging someone older than her, but she was still the leader of this club.<br/>
“Hey, Mitchell!” someone shouted.<br/>
“What do you want?” she asked the girl. She seemed older than her and was wearing a Gryffindor robe.<br/>
“You want to challenge me? Or are you afraid?”<br/>
“You can try. I challenge you” Beca laughed, folding her arms. She just noticed two girls standing next to her opponent. They were smiling. “Nice. Posen and Beale. Came to see your friend failing?”<br/>
Gryffindors didn’t respond to this. They just found places to sit and watch the duel.<br/>
Beca and the other girl were ready.<br/>
“Mitchell, stay here and you, Beaser go there” said the judge, pointing at two different sides of the ring.<br/>
Beaser? She doesn’t know anyone with this name – Beca was thinking.<br/>
“You start when I will count to 3”<br/>
1…<br/>
2…<br/>
3!<br/>
“Stupefy!”<br/>
“Protego” shouted Beca. “Rictusempra!”<br/>
“Protego!” Beaser responded quickly “Expelliarmus!”<br/>
The spell missed the brunette. Someone laughed. It was Amy.<br/>
“Aquamenti”<br/>
From The Gryffindor’s wand was shot a stream of water that hit Beca who shouted “What the hell?!”. This time it was Chloe and Aubrey who laughed.<br/>
“Rictusempra!” another spell hit the brunette.<br/>
“Finite“ Beca said after she fell on her knees laughing very loud “Levico-“<br/>
“EXPELLIARMUS!”<br/>
It happened. Beca’s wand just flew out of her hand. There was silence in the class for a moment. Suddenly the whole room was filled by the scream of joy. Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors ran on the ring and started to congratulate the winner. Beca was standing here shocked, looking at her wand that was laying on the ground, she picked it up and pointed at the girl who defeated her.<br/>
“Don’t do it Beca.”<br/>
It was Amy who took her friend’s hand and pulled her out of the room. Fortunately nobody noticed what Beca tried to do.<br/>
“Leave me alone” she mumbled.<br/>
“Come on. It’s just the dueling club!”<br/>
“It’s not just the dueling club! First Quidditch, now this! It was the last thing I was good at! I’ve got nothing now”<br/>
Amy was staring at her speechless. Beca freed her hand out of the grasp and left the castle. It was dark outside. She should go to her bedroom but if she would do it she would have to talk with Amy and Cynthia about her feelings. She wanted to be alone so she headed to the lake, where she sat and started throwing the rocks into the water. Her mind was filled with thoughts. Who will I be when I don’t have anything. I won’t be so cool without the team and club. Nobody will adore me like they always did. Maybe I could try something else.<br/>
“Hey” Beca jumped, she didn’t expect anyone being there. Who was it? It was so dark she couldn’t see the face. She knew this voice, was it someone she heard in common room? Nobody else would talk to her so she decided to act like she knew this girl.<br/>
“Hey, what’s up?”<br/>
“I should be the one asking you that. I know you lost a duel today”<br/>
“I don’t want to talk about it” Beca said harshly.<br/>
“I know you are not like that. I’m here for you. I won’t judge you” the girl responded softly. Her words sounded true, like Beca could really trust her.<br/>
“I am not like what?”<br/>
“You are not that… evil. Like everyone think. Your parents. They were at work all the time, right? Your mother is an Unspeakable and your father is a teacher at Durmstrang”<br/>
“At Ilvermony, yeah. How do you know that?” she ignored the first part.<br/>
“Everyone knows it, you’re kind of popular kid” The stranger laughed. Her laugh was cute. What? Why was Beca even talking to her? Opening to her?<br/>
There was a moment of comfortable silence between them.<br/>
“I’m nobody when I’m not in a team. When I’m not the leader of the dueling club. I’m nothing” Beca started talking, her voice was shaking, with every word her tone was higher, like she was about to cry.<br/>
“Stop talking like that. You’ll come back to the team.”<br/>
“No, I won’t. I don’t know what could I do to come back”<br/>
“You should try everything if you really love it. Just listen to your heart. Don’t be the person everyone expect you to be. Be the person you truly are.” The girl wanted to place her hand on Beca’s but by the accident she placed it on her thigh. The most surprising fact was that Beca didn’t push her away.<br/>
“You don’t know me”<br/>
“Maybe if you wouldn’t act like an asshole it would be easier for me to get to know you”<br/>
“What are you doing here anyway?” she asked the girl, ignoring her words.<br/>
“I’ve seen you leaving so I followed you. I could go if you want me to”<br/>
“No” Beca herself was surprised by this answer “I mean… You can stay”<br/>
“Just a couple of minutes. I promised my friend I will be back soon”<br/>
Girls were sitting next to each other for couple minutes until the other one had to go. Beca was still looking at the lake, holding her knees and having a head on it. She was thinking about the mysterious girl. There were only few things she knew about her. She was from Slytherin. She was watching her duel. And the most important, she cared about Beca.<br/>
-<br/>
She woke up late so everyone from her bedroom were already up. After dressing up, she went to Great Hall to eat breakfast. In the hallway she met a girl who greeted her nicely, placing her hand on Beca’s back.<br/>
“How are you after yesterday?”<br/>
“I’m fine” She looked at the girl. She was tall, her blonde hair was brushed and pulled back in a ponytail. She saw her yesterday in the dueling club. And she was from Slytherin. It had to be that girl from the night. “I didn’t ask for your name”<br/>
“I guess you didn’t have a chance, right? I’m Emma”<br/>
“It’s nice to know your name and see you in a daylight”<br/>
“You too” the girl looked surprised and laughed a little bit, what wasn’t noticed by Beca “I guess”<br/>
“What are you doing today?” the brunette asked, walking into Great Hall and heading  to Slytherin’s table “Sit next to me?”<br/>
“I’m meeting my friends.” She smiled “And yeah, with pleasure”<br/>
“Hey guys” Beca said to Amy and Cynthia.<br/>
“Hey buddy”<br/>
“Who’s your friend?”<br/>
“This is Emma…” she looked at the blonde and did the thinking face.<br/>
“I’m Emma Woodhouse, hey”<br/>
“Be careful not to put her in flames, Beca” said Amy, who stopped eating her breakfast and everyone looked at her interrogatively. “What? It was funny”<br/>
“No, it wasn’t. This brilliant kid is Amy. I’m Cynthia. Nice to meet you”<br/>
After breakfast four of them went to the common room.<br/>
“So Emma, what year are you at?”<br/>
“I’m at fifth year. I’m the prefect so I’m not surprised you didn’t know me.”<br/>
“What do you mean?” asked Amy.<br/>
“That you don’t care about who got the power”<br/>
“Prefects are powerless”<br/>
“I don’t think so. I could punish you for offending me”<br/>
“But that would mean taking away points from your own house. It’s really stupid”<br/>
“Yeah, but Professor McGonnagall trusts me so if you would do something that would deserve a punishment I would do it with pleasure, even if that would cost us some points” Emma sat up straight.<br/>
“Stop it guys” Beca laughed, a little bit afraid that Amy could do something to her friend. “It’s Saturday tomorrow”<br/>
“Hogsmeade!”<br/>
“I forgot it would be your first visit in Hogsmeade!” Emma said with excited tone.<br/>
“Want to go somewhere with me?” Beca proposed. The two friends looked at her shocked. Was she asking someone out?<br/>
“Yes, cutie. But for now I got to go. I have to meet my friend Austin. See you!” the girl waved at the others and left the room.<br/>
“What the fuck was this Beca?” shouted Amy “How long do you know each other? 2 hours?”<br/>
“We met yesterday. Come on it’s not a big deal. I want to have some fun”<br/>
“Please, try not to hurt her. She seems nice” said Cynthia, giving each of her friends a sheet of paper. “We got to do our homework for comc”<br/>
“It’s Friday. We can do it later” Amy complained, opening new pack of chocolate frogs “Look! I’ve got Salazar Slytherin! Come here you little bastard” she said to the frog, which wanted to escape.<br/>
“We are going to Hogsmeade tomorrow and at Sunday we need to practice potions because, to be honest, we really suck at this”<br/>
“Good to have you. We would be kicked out at first year if we didn’t know you”<br/>
“I know” Cynthia shrugged and started writing something on the paper.<br/>
After finishing their homework, which took them 2 hours, they went to their bedroom and talked until they all fell asleep.<br/>
-<br/>
The next day, every 3rd year student was up early. They didn’t even eat the breakfast because they wanted to eat as many candies from Honeydukes as possible. Everyone allowed to visit Hogsmeade was already waiting on courtyard. Beca was spotted by Emma, who kissed her cheek as a greeting. The brunette forced a smile.<br/>
“Hey babe, where are we going? Maybe Madam Puddifoot?”<br/>
“No, firstly we have to go to honeydukes. Then you can do whatever you want” Amy cut in, looking at Emma angrily.<br/>
“Alright, I need to go to Scrivenshaft’s anyway. I need new quill. Meet me later!”<br/>
“She is so nice” Cynthia said, after the blonde left them “She even ignored you being a dickhead”<br/>
“Hey! Honeydukes first! Let’s go!”<br/>
When the girls did the shopping at the candy paradise, Beca said goodbye to her friends and went to the teahouse. She walked in and the smell of mixed fruits hit her. The room wasn’t crowded. She wasn’t sure if Emma was already there so she headed to the table in the corner. She walked past few older students and sat with her back to the door so nobody would see her. She didn’t wait long until the blonde joined her.<br/>
“Can I sit next to you?” Emma asked.<br/>
“Do you have to ask for my permission?” Beca raised her eyebrows and then she smiled. Of course she had to asked for permission, because everyone knows Beca Mitchell didn’t like to be this close with people. “Sorry, this was a little bit rude. Come here”<br/>
“What can I get you, m’dears?”<br/>
“One coffee and-“<br/>
“Two coffees” Emma smiled “Thank you”<br/>
Girls were talking and getting to know each other for an hour. Emma even was laying on Beca’s shoulder for a moment. They nearly kissed but the brunette sneezed, what made them both laugh.<br/>
“You have cute laugh, you know?”<br/>
Beca smiled “Thank you” She wanted to give the other a compliment too but she couldn’t think of anything that wouldn’t be lame. “It was a nice time but I got to go meet Amy and Cynthia at Three Broomsitcks”<br/>
“My friends are there so I’ll walk you, okay?”<br/>
Beca nodded in agreement. As they walked they’ve seen a bunch of people sitting at the bar. This was really loud place because everybody loved to come here. Girls said goodbye to each other, the brunette awkwardly avoided being kissed in the cheek by Emma. She was afraid that someone would notice it.<br/>
“We already ordered you some butterbeer!” said Amy “so how was it?”<br/>
“Fine”<br/>
“That’s it? No making out?”<br/>
“We were just talking. I need to get to know her better” Beca answered taking sip from her cup “This is really delicious”<br/>
“I can’t hear you because of fucking Beale” she pointed at girls talking loudly near their table. Beca just noticed Posen and her friends.<br/>
“Hey, Beale. Could you just shut the fuck up and go somewhere else? You are ruining the view” she shouted throwing at her squashed napkin. Chloe looked at her with sad smile.<br/>
“Sorry Bec” she said and took her shocked friend away from the Slytherins.<br/>
Amy and Cynthia were goggling at her friend. Beca was just looking at the place, where moment ago stayed the redhead. Suddenly she stand up, spilling her butterbeer.<br/>
“I- I need to go. Sorry. I need to- to do something at the- castle” she stammered. She left the pub quickly. This voice was banging in her head. Owner of this voice was with her at the lake. It was Chloe.<br/>
“Hey are you okay?” Beca felt delicate hand touching her back. “I saw you leaving alone. Something happened?”<br/>
“No, Emma. I’m okay. I just need to meet Amy at the castle” she said absently staring at the space ahead.<br/>
“But Amy is here” the blonde said but the other girl didn’t hear her or just ignored her words. She was heading to the castle, thoughts spinning in her head.</p>
