    <p>While Neville Longbottom sits in the Headmaster's office after accidentally losing the week's passwords for Gryffindor Tower to Sirius Black, berating himself under his breath for everything from stupidity to cowardice, Helga watches on sadly. The boy is alone, as it is one of Albus Dumbledore's eccentric habits to leave a student alone in his office the first time they are there, as a test. Neville is looking furtively at the Sorting Hat, slouched on a shelf across from his seat, and it doesn't take legilimency (or the knowledge that details of Harry Potter's adventure in Salazar's chamber last year have spread all over Gryffindor Tower by now) to see that the poor thing is questioning his Sorting. He had argued so fiercely to be in Hufflepuff…</p>
<p>
  <em>I would have taken you, dear child, Helga thinks, I would have taken you in an instant and you would have been happy with my badgers.</em>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a war coming, even if most of the wixen world can not yet see it, and it has always been the Founder's policy in such times to pad Gryffindor and Slytherin—the house of warriors and the house of diplomats—with those students who had an inclination for either. Helga and Rowena don't necessarily believe Salazar and Godric have the monopoly on war, diplomacy or even leadership, but they agree that both houses have a similar tendency towards wanting to be at the center of all happenings that can be useful for organizing large movements. In essence, it is easier to persuade ambitious Slytherins and impetuous Gryffindors to go to war than thoughtful Hufflepuffs and impartial Ravenclaws. (If only the two houses didn't just as often decide to go to war against each other…!)</p>
<p>Poor, timid Neville Longbottom has enough Gryffindor in him to have been a victim of this policy; even without it the Hat could very likely still have placed him there, but Helga stubbornly holds that he would have been happier in her house. She wishes it was far more common for students to be placed where they'd be happiest rather than where they'd be pushed towards "greatness" or whatever nonsense line the Hat was using these days. Children should not have to go to war.</p>
<p>Albus is still tarrying outside the staircase downstairs, speaking with a portrait. Neville is still mournfully contemplating the Sorting Hat, stopping occasionally to mutter "stupid, <em>stupid</em>" under his breath. Wanting desperately to comfort the child, Helga finds herself seized by an idea. It is one that her gut tells her is the right thing to do, and one that her mind tells her will not please the other Founders one bit, so she acts immediately.</p>
<p>It only takes a little bit of coaxing from the Hat to persuade Neville to put it on—and then Helga is whispering a centuries-old secret into the boy's head.</p>
<p>
  <em>Yes, my dear, it is true that a Gryffindor can summon Godric's sword from the Sorting Hat, but so could a Slytherin, or a Hufflepuff…</em>
</p>
<p>Some wixen before this have guessed, certainly, but no one has ever been outright <em>told</em>. Helga wonders what Neville will do with the information, and feels in her gut that he will not disappoint her in the slightest.</p>
<p>
  <em>…and remember, Neville dear, that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.</em>
