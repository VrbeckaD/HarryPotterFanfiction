    <p>Lady Death was old. She has lived ever since the first being died and has seen many more die as the years past. She was tired of it, as one could never get used to death even if they are a god or goddess.</p>
<p>But out of all the deaths she has watched, she hated seeing children die the most. Sometimes, it was because they were sick. Others because of suicide and some from being abused and neglected. The reasons varied all the time but it was still a sad sight to see.</p>
<p>Children were the future. They had a whole life ahead of them, one they would never be able to live.</p>
<p>When Lady Death felt the familiar tug to a human on the verge of death, she closed her eyes in acceptance as she felt that it was a child. With a heavy heart, she let herself be pulled away.</p>
<p>The child was small. After years of seeing abused and neglected children, she could see signs of malnourishment and realized, with a small pang in her heart, that this was no different. She placed her hand on the child's head, allowing her to view the memories of the child's life.</p>
<p>His name was Harry James Potter. He was the twin to Arthur Potter and the son of James and Lily Potter. He was only seven.</p>
<p>As she viewed his early life filled with happy memories with his family, she wondered what went wrong. A lot of families started out happy just like this one but tragedy would strike and someone would change. She wondered who is was.</p>
<p>Realizing that this was going too slow, she sped the memories up and realized the problem.</p>
<p>Albus Bloody Dumbledore and his prophecy. The prophecy itself was true but he made a mistake. Arthur wasn't the Boy-Who-Lived. It was Harry and because his family wanted Arthur to have a good life because of the burden he supposedly had, they started to neglect, and sometimes even hit Harry, who only wanted some affection and love from his family.</p>
<p>Lady Death's heart broke for the boy, as it did with every situation similar to this one. He would be welcomed into her kingdom with kindness and he would live a much happier death than his life that Lady Death was sure of.</p>
<p>"Go with my blessing, young one, and may you find more happiness and love in your death than in your life. The Kingdom of Death welcomes all who are good and no one shall harm you there. Rest well," she said, placing a kiss on the boy's head.</p>
<p>With that, Harry's soul left his body and traveled to Lady Death's Kingdom. Lady Death smiled sadly at the body of the boy and stepped back, her work done.</p>
<p>'<em>He could have been great,'</em> she thought, <em>'But alas, Fate had different plans for him. But who knows? Maybe he can still be great.'</em></p>
<p>And with that thought on her mind, she went to find the next soul.</p>
