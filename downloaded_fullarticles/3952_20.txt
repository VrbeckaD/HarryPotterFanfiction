    <p>
  <em>A tall woman stood next to a glassless window. Her brilliant emerald eyes looked down at the mortals with a tired expression. The morals worked on their agriculture after her youngest gifted it to them. The images of their happy and blessed selves were now nothing more than a memory. No longer would they be in the presence of the Titans and Godlings. No longer would food appear for them whenever they were hungry. No longer would there be any need for laws and justice, because they were too happy to committee a crime. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>It was as if the world has turned upside down. It did, in a way, years ago.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The woman shook her head in disappointments. Her children have achieved much, but they still had much growing to do. The way they treated each other and the mortals left much to desire. She had an idea of where such attitude came from, but was skeptic at the thought. Yet, that same thought made her sigh in sadness, a second later.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The woman walked away from the window. She made her way to a golden bowl filled with water. Even though she tried to, the woman couldn’t stop the annoyed look that made to her face at the sight of the bowl. As a mother, she loves her children with her whole being. Yet, there was a moment when the feeling of annoyance fought its way to the surface. For a woman that didn’t care for expensive or grand things, her children thought otherwise. At least her parents, siblings and husband got the message and didn’t get her such things. What use could there be for a golden bowl, when one made out of clay could do a fine job?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>With a sigh, this woman tried to push the negative thoughts away. Today was not her day. Not even after attending to her lions have lightened up her mood. She shouldn’t have left her bed after all.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The brown headed woman looked into the water at her reflection. Her brilliant emerald eyes were no longer bright, but instead dull. The skin on her face has sunken in a bit, from the lack of want for food. Her curly brown hair no longer shined, but rested on her head in a mess and lifeless form. Her lips drew in a firm line at the image, before she sighed. With slight shakiness, her hands cooped up the water before splashing it on her face. A sigh of relief escaped her as she rubbed the back of her neck and made her way to sit down on her long couch.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She was tired of everything. Life has not been kind to her family, no thanks to her monstrous father. It appeared that his curse lived on, among many others that were never spoken or known. This got her thinking of something. That line of thinking was the reason behind her sleepless nights. What if her father has gone the extra mile, and also cursed everyone else, not only her husband? What if on top of the known curse, he chanted many more? It would make sense and brought to light a lot of things. One of them could explain the odd behaviour behind her husband’s.</em>
</p>
<p><em>As she thought about it, there was knocking at the door. A confused frown was thrown to its direction. </em>Who can it be? No humans come here. The kids, as far as I know, are too busy doing their own things. Oh, I hope it’s not Zeus with another baby. <em>She resisted the urge to sigh again. She has been doing that a lot, hasn’t she? Without a word, she got up and opened the door. Her eyes widened in surprise.</em></p>
<p align="center">-ooOOoo-</p>
<p>You know, you would think that after the Second Wizarding War, everything would go back to normal. Well, it did, unless one was Heather Lily Potter. Of course she couldn’t catch a break. For the Saviour of the Wizarding World, Girl-Who-Lived now Woman-Who-Lived, with a few other titles, nothing was that simple. Oh no. Heck, her friends even thought up of a reason behind her Potter luck. Ron pointed out that it could be that an ancestor of hers pissed off the wrong person or being and got cursed. Hermione scuffed at the explanation. Heather thought about it and decided that it made a lot of sense. Why else would she have to go through a hell on Earth? Only for it to be her maternal family, ‘adventures’ in Hogwarts and the loss of those that were close to her?</p>
<p>
  <em>Sigh</em>
</p>
<p>Well, at least she has her friends, the Weasley family and Teddy. Out of all them, it was her Godson that kept her from hexing every moving target- ahem, reporter or politician. Heather thought that they were bad from her Hogwarts years, but it was nothing compared to after the war. No thanks to them, she couldn’t go finish her last year of school. Instead, she had to be under lock and key with nothing but books, Winky and Teddy for company. Behind her bedchamber doors, she could add weird dreams and nightmares of the war onto the list. But, she had to go far to keep her and Teddy safe, while also to keep the reporters and politicians out. This was done in three ways. Disconnect the Floo Network of her fireplace. Have Hermione put in runes to stop people from getting into her home in any way shape or form. And put on the Fidelius Charm, with her as the Secret Keeper.</p>
<p>Today was a miracle, Heather decided.</p>
<p>Even though she had to leave the house to get some business done, she was not bothered once. Sure, people stared at her, but they didn’t bother her. Not even those damn reporters appeared to take pictures of her or ask her personal questions. And no auror appeared to escort her to the Ministry of Magic to talk with the politicians. It may have to do with it being New Years’ today. One step away from the war. One step closer to the future. At least, that was what they said nowadays.</p>
<p>This New Years’ was to be celebrated at the Weasley’s new house. After their old one was destroyed during the war, Heather got them a new, bigger but still modest house. They refused, saying that they could get a new one. The new one wouldn’t be as big, but they would try and work with it. Yet, the black headed young woman didn’t have any of that. They were the family that she always wanted. They laughed, comforted, cried and fought together through a lot. For the young witch, this gift didn’t cover how thankful she was of the red headed family. They took her in when she was a confused and scared orphan that was thrusted into a world that she knew nothing of. Heck, to prove further how grateful she was, she opened a few bank accounts filled with money. These bank accounts were divided between the Weasley family, friends and Teddy to use. She had too much money that sat around collecting dust. May as well use the money.</p>
<p>So there Heather was, late at night in the new Weasley Manor. An eight month old Teddy slept in her arms. The noise didn’t bother him one bit. She was glad for that, because the last Potter didn’t plan to let him go any time soon. She hadn’t been able to do so for months, after the brutal murder of his grandmother, Andromeda. If Heather didn’t get there in time, he would have died as well by the hands of the leftover Death Eaters. Even though she no longer wanted to be an auror, her skills still beat those Death Eaters black and blue until reinforcements arrived. If they didn’t, she may have killed them. They took away Teddy's grandmother and almost killed him too.</p>
<p>Shaking her head, the Woman-Who-Lived paid attention to her best friends' conversation. Heather was happy that they decided to come for the party. She hasn’t seen them for a few months, and it was not the same when they wrote letters. Hermione has decided to go finish off her last year of Hogwarts. Ron didn’t want to do that, so instead head started on his career and entered the Auror Program. That program asked of the new recruits to stay in a boarding house. It was so that the new recruits learned how to work with each other in an easier and faster way. It was only when the recruits passed the final exam would they be allowed to live somewhere else.</p>
<p>The war has been hard on all three of them, but in different ways. Heather lost many loved ones and died herself, once. Ron and Hermione have both lost loved ones and whatever leftover innocence and naïve that they had. Due to that, they chose to go down their own roads. Hermione studied harder than ever to get into the Law Department at the Ministry. Ron wanted to protect his family and friends, rather than sit around and read books. So he used his newfound political power from being a War Hero and got into the program. He used whatever free time that he had study hard in the needed subjects for the program. What surprised Heather was that Hermione approved, rather than drag Ron to Hogwarts. Heather, well… she decided to become something like Hagrid. She wanted to work with animals, both magical and non-magical. They brought her peace when she had her PTSD moments. Her best friends, after they found out the reason, supported her 100 percent. They, themselves, understood as they went through the same thing.</p>
<p>Leaning against the chair in relaxation, Heather rubbed Teddy’s back with her thumb. Her emerald eyes looked up at the clock and saw that it was 11 PM. 1 hour to go.</p>
<p>“Still can’t believe Malfoy was let go.”</p>
<p>Ron grumbled in annoyance. It was due to when he heard from his girlfriend that the blond also returned for his last year.</p>
<p>“Ron, it was Malfoy senior that was the real problem, and he’s behind bars for life. Malfoy has changed a lot after the war. He’s not calling me a Mudblood or anything anymore.” Hermione countered his comment with thoughtfulness. Her brown eyes stared at the air as she remembered the last few months. “He has kept to himself for the most part.”</p>
<p>“I still don’t trust that ferret.”</p>
<p>“I have to agree with Ron on this,” Heather added in with carefulness. She was right to do so, since Hermione threw to her a look of disbelief. Before she could protest, the witch continued. “but I have to agree with you too, Mione. His mother has helped us during the war. And this war has changed a lot of people. I mean, look at us. We’re not the same as we were a year ago. It’s not that hard to believe that Malfoy changed. It’s… I don’t know how much we should trust him. We could trust him as an ally, but not as a friend.”</p>
<p>“Of course not as a friend! Bloody-” Ron stopped when he received a pair of glares. He gulped, not wanting to be hexed by cursing in front of a child by accident. He corrected himself, “I will not accept him as a friend, but you are right. We can keep an eye on him, but he can be a useful ally.”</p>
<p>The young women watched him with shock awe. They leaned closed to one another and whispered not too quietly.</p>
<p>“Did he just say that he’ll consider <em>Malfoy</em> as an <em>ally</em>?”</p>
<p>“I <em>know</em>. I think our dear Ron is growing up.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>The red head protested at their comments with a mock offended look. This caused the two young women to burst into laughter. When they calmed down a bit and looked at the only guy of the group, they resumed their laughter to the point of tears. Ron tried to appear that he sulked in his seat with his arms crossed over his chest. Yet, it failed as there was a twitch in the corner of his lips.</p>
<p>Once the young women calmed down, the trio realized that the laughter woke up someone. A small whine escaped Teddy at being woken up from his sleep. He calmed down when his godmother slash mother figure rubbed his back. A pacifier was given to him, to which he sucked on with no protest. The couple watched their friend in silence until the baby boy calmed down. When he did, Ron asked her:</p>
<p>“How are you and Teddy doing?”</p>
<p>“We’re doing fine.”</p>
<p>Heather answered back in half-truth. Her eyes looked at them with tiresome. She received looks mixed with skepticism and worrisome. Hermione lectured her:</p>
<p>“Heather Lily Potter, don’t lie to us. How many times do we need to remind you that ‘fine’ is not an answer?”</p>
<p>The black headed witch gave the other one a look. It was received with a look of warning. She bit back a sigh but answered:</p>
<p>“It’s… it’s tough. I still have a lot of nightmares from the war. I also still have those weird dreams. Then I have to take care of Teddy while I’m studying, and it doesn’t help that he’s starting to crawl everywhere now. He sometimes has nightmares. I can only guess they are of Andromeda’s murder. And I’m also cooped up in Sirius’ house, which brings back even more memories.” Heather paused for a moment before she explained a bit more in a rushing manner, when she realized how she must sound to her friends. “I mean, I am happy to have Teddy with me. I’m not as depressed as I used to be, before I had him. Winky also helps a lot, with the cleaning and we’re checking for any and all dark objects. I-It’s just…”</p>
<p>“You’re tired”</p>
<p>Hermione answered for her, now looking as worried as her boyfriend did. Ron breathed out in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Blimey, Heather, if you told us, we would have been there for you. You know that my mom would love to look after Teddy for a bit, for you to catch some sleep. We could have even come over the weekends to help you with the house or to hang out.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I didn’t say anything.” Heather protested. “All of you have your own things to do, your own problems.”</p>
<p>“But Heather-”</p>
<p>“No Hermione, you know that I’m right. You don’t just have your NEWT exams to study for. You also need to focus on getting into the faculty that you want. And Ron just doesn’t have time with the program. And everyone else either has their own things to do or still try to recover from the war. Yes, it’s hard for me, but I’ll live through this. I have been through much worse. Merlin, Tom has been the worst thing that I’ve had to face. Looking after a baby, studying and cleaning a house are nothing. I just need to get used to it.”</p>
<p>Heather smiled at them in assurance, but her friends didn’t buy it. Still, they didn’t argue. All three of them were stubborn, but the Woman-Who-Lived took the crown if they competed. Ron decided to change the subject to something that bothered him.</p>
<p>“Heather, you said that you still have those weird dreams of yours. Have they changed much?”</p>
<p>Hermione nodded in agreement, wanting to know as well. She has been the first to discover those dreams, in their second year as they roomed together. It took a lot of convincing from her end, to have Heather agree to tell Ron about these dreams. He was the only one that grew up in the Wizarding World. For all they knew, it must make sense on some level to him. But it didn’t. To this day, it still puzzled the Golden Trio.</p>
<p>Heather thought about the most recent dream. She voiced out her thoughts:</p>
<p>“Yes… and no? I mean, they are almost the same. But I had a recent dream that was a bit different.” The two nudged their heads for her in encouragement to continue. “It’s still the same woman. She was in the same stone house and everything. She looked a bit different, more tired, skinner, and a bit… sick, I guess? But that’s not what I find different. What I find different are her thoughts and the dream went a different direction.”</p>
<p>“When you mean that her thoughts were different…”</p>
<p>Hermione asked of her, to which she was answered with a nod.</p>
<p>“They are more depressed, almost in a… snappy kind of way, I guess?” At this Heather frowned. She looked down at Teddy, who closed his eyes and appeared to have gone back to sleep. The only difference this time was that he had a handful of her shirt in his small fist. She relaxed a bit when she saw that he went back to sleep. “She always appears gentle, so full of love and care, so I was surprised to see her like that.”</p>
<p>“Well, when one is depressed, they tend to change.”</p>
<p>Ron voiced out something that he learned at the program. Funny enough, the Auror Program had all kinds of classes, like Psychology, for the recruits to take. Heather nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“Yes. She snapped at something as simple as a golden bowl, which was given to her by her children.”</p>
<p>“That… is odd.”</p>
<p>Hermione blinked in confusion.</p>
<p>“Yeah, and she continued to call people humans. I heard her thoughts mention that her son has ‘gifted the humans’ agriculture. And she mentioned the name of Zeus, hoping that he didn’t bring another ‘baby’.”</p>
<p>There was heavy silence between the Golden Trio, as the couple stared at her in shock. Ron was the one that voiced in surprise:</p>
<p>“Heather, I hope you’re not talking about Zeus as the King of the Gods.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know!” She snapped at him, not meaning to. Just the sleepless nights started to get to her. “I’m telling you what I heard. And she mentioned her father and curses. She was thinking of someone else, too, but didn’t mention them by name. She was really sad and skeptical about something related to those three things. The last thing I remember was her opening a door, before I woke up.”</p>
<p>The red headed wizard took no mind in her snapping. He had seen her do much worse. Instead, he looked at her with a look of wonder. Heather got to admit one thing. Being in a relationship with Hermione and gone through war has sharpened his mind, which was scary sometimes. That same girlfriend cupped her chin and thought out loud about what they were just told.</p>
<p>“I think Ron is right, saying that she was talking about Zeus as in the one from Greek mythology. You mention that he was her son, which could only mean that you’re dreaming of Rhea, the mother of the Greek Gods. If we go in this line of thinking, then her ‘father’ is Ouranos. I don’t know of any curses. But, if I’m guessing right, then she must be talking about his warning of his son’s children overthrowing him. Like how he overthrew his father. Ouranos’ son that overthrew him was Cronus, who she must be thinking of.”</p>
<p>“Woh, woh, woh. Hold it right there. Dear Merlin- Mione, how do you know all of this stuff?”</p>
<p>Ron stopped his girlfriend as he stared at her with wide eyes. She scoffed at him.</p>
<p>“I’ll let you know that when I was in primary school we talked a bit about Greek mythology. I just took a book from a library for some light reading to know more.”</p>
<p>Ron and Heather gave each other the look ‘of course’. Why did they bother question her intelligence and resources? It was always the same- to-the-library! Merlin, they almost missed those days. Those same days when they had mysteries to solve which resulted in almost death. Yeah, no, they didn’t miss them, if they thought about them this way. The female of the two voiced out what they all were thinking:</p>
<p>“If it’s true, then why am I dreaming of her?”</p>
<p>That was a real brain scratcher, to which Ron made a point by doing. Not even a moment later, Ginny, Ron’s younger sister, showed up with a big grin.</p>
<p>“What are you three doing sitting around? It’s almost time for the toast!”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to actually drink Firewhisky, are you?”</p>
<p>Ron eyed her as he asked. He didn’t like the idea at all. His sister rolled her eyes at him.</p>
<p>“So what if I am? It’s just a small glass-”</p>
<p>“It’s too strong for you-”</p>
<p>“You’re starting to sound like mom!”</p>
<p>“Well, you just turned 17!”</p>
<p>Both Hermione and Heather sighed as they watched the two siblings bicker back and forth. The two witches got up and left to where the rest of the guests and Weasley family were. The godmother placed a quick silent spell on her godson, so that he wouldn’t be woken up by the rising noises. She didn’t want him to cry on his first New Years’. While the Brightest Witch of the Century talked with some of the guests, the Woman-Who-Lived watched the clock.</p>
<p>
  <em>11:59</em>
</p>
<p>“Okay everyone! 10 seconds until midnight!”</p>
<p>Someone shouted over the crowd, which made everyone turn to the clock with excitement. They all chanted at once.</p>
<p>“10!”</p>
<p>“9!”</p>
<p>“8!”</p>
<p>“7!”</p>
<p>“6!”</p>
<p>“5!”</p>
<p>“4!”</p>
<p>“3!”</p>
<p>“2!”</p>
<p>“1!”</p>
<p>George brought out some fireworks.</p>
<p>“Happy New Years!”</p>
<p>
  <em>Pop!</em>
</p>
<p>The fireworks went off.</p>
<p>“George Weasley!-”</p>
<p>Molly started to lecture her son. Everyone else continued to cheer and drank their preferred drinks. Then, something odd happened. Heather watched in confusion and horror as everyone around her stopped moving. They stood like statues, frozen in time. When she looked at the clock, she saw that the thin hand that struck 12 has gone back a second and stayed like that. A feeling started to rise inside of her. It was almost like her magic, but something else. It was something older, stronger, yet familiar. Heather gasped, as if the air was knocked out of her. She collapsed onto her knees, her grip on Teddy almost loosened. Her body shook as the feeling rose higher and higher, until everything went black. The last thing she heard was the party resuming, and then someone screamed her name.</p>
<p align="center">-ooOOoo-</p>
<p>On the other side of the world, 12 figures raised their heads when they felt a familiar power.</p>
<p>One of these figures breathed out in relief:</p>
<p>“At last, she has returned.”</p>
<p align="center">-ooOOoo-</p>
<p>Somewhere deep inside the Earth, hidden from all living things, stood a tall man. He walked out of his cell’s door and over the creature that he knocked out. He chuckled as he made his way down the halls to his freedom. A moment later, he stopped and turned his head up towards the ceiling. Though, it was not what he was staring at. He stared at something that was far behind this long familiar ceiling. The smile no longer stretched across his face. He, too, felt the power. An old feeling, from millenniums ago, which tortured him during his long sentence, returned. His hands clenched into tight fists, one of which was around his golden scythe. He breathed out:</p>
<p>“Rhea”</p>
