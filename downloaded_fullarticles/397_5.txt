</p><p align="left">Charlie Weasley asks if I fancy him in Care of Magical Creatures. The question causes me to stumble over a tree root and he reaches out a hand to steady me. The prat is grinning when I look over at him. </p><p>“Why would you ask me that?”</p><p>“Because you’re honest enough to answer.”</p><p>He has me there; I only lie to authority figures when I need to get out of trouble, but I’m always straight-forward with my friends.</p><p>“Err, you’re a great guy, but no… I’m sorry if I gave you the impression that I did.”</p><p>Charlie pats me on the back. “No worries, mate. I’m actually relieved that you don’t because now I can invite you to the Yule Ball.”</p><p>My brow furrows. “Okay, now you’ve lost me. Care to explain?”</p><p>“Well I had to make sure you only saw me as a friend. I wouldn’t want to lead you on if you were expecting a relationship, you know? Most of the school is taking this very seriously and it freaks me out because I’m not into all that love stuff. I mean don’t get me wrong, it’s fine for other people – it’s just not my thing. Am I making any sense?”</p><p>“Yeah, I understand what you mean.”</p><p>“Good. So how about it? Will you be my 100% platonic date to the ball?”</p><p>I smile at him. “Of course I will.”</p><p>“Thanks, (Name), you’re saving my life! Four girls have already asked me and I had to turn them down. I felt bad about it, but going with one of them would be really awkward – especially if she tried to kiss me.”</p><p>He looks so scandalized at the prospect that I almost laugh.</p><p>“Sure, Charlie, I’m glad I can help. This is good for me too because the guy I fancy is already going with someone. I’ve been pretty depressed over it to be honest.”</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?”</p><p>I knock him with my shoulder. “You already did by asking me to the ball.”</p><p>He smiles. “So who is this bloke? Do you want me to tell him off for you?”</p><p>The image of Charlie scolding his older brother makes me chuckle. “I’m not telling you who he is.”</p><p>He drapes his arm around me. “Aww come on! I promise not to embarrass you.”</p><p>I shake my head. “You definitely would.”</p><p>His brown eyes widen. “It isn’t Barnaby, is it? Because he told me today that he’s going with a Hufflepuff.”</p><p>“Nope, not him.”</p><p>“Andre?”</p><p>“Wrong again.” <em>He’s just going to keep listing off people, and if he says Bill’s name, I know I’ll give it away by blushing. I can’t let that happen… I’ll have to tell a lie.</em> “You don’t know him, Charlie.”</p><p>“Ah, so he’s an older student, huh?”</p><p>“Yes, and that’s all I’m going to say.” I shrug away from him. “Now stop distracting me; we need to feed our bowtruckles.”</p><p>“Fine, but I’m not giving up. I’ll figure it out eventually.”</p><p>“We’ll see about that, Dragon Boy.”</p><p align="center">

</p><p>The Great Hall looks like a winter wonderland. Snowflakes spiral down from the velvety blue ceiling and the paneled walls sparkle with frost. Round tables lit with blue-flamed lanterns are set against the walls, leaving plenty of space in the middle for the dance floor. Ben is up on the elevated stage where the staff table usually is. Muggle music blares from an old-fashioned gramophone. I can see him going through stacks of records – some of which I loaned him – as he tries to pick the next song.</p><p>Tonks hurries over to me and Charlie. “Hey, you two! I love your dress, (Name). Very head-turning!”</p><p>“Thanks, I like yours too.” She is wearing a turquoise off-the-shoulder dress with a short, ruffled skirt and chunky black heels.</p><p>‘Ceremony’ by New Order starts playing and Tonks grabs my hand. “Come and dance with me!”</p><p>Charlie joins us for a Billy Idol song. All of us are laughing and acting like dorks, but it’s so much fun. ‘Material Girl’ comes on next and me and Penny sing along to it. Charlie partners me for a slower song that I don’t recognize. He keeps me in stitches with his jokes about the nearby couples.</p><p>We’re at the refreshment table when I hear Bill’s voice. “Oi, Charlie, who’s that with you?”</p><p>I turn around and his eyes widen when he sees me in my strapless dress. The bodice is fitted and the sweetheart neckline shows off my chest. His appraising stare makes me blush.</p><p>“You’re a knock-out, (Name)!” he says, grinning.</p><p>“Umm, thank you.”</p><p>Charlie slips an arm around me. “Hey, that’s my date you’re ogling, William.”</p><p>“Are you jealous, little brother?”</p><p>“You wish!”</p><p>Bill smirks. “Then you won’t mind if I ask her to dance, will you?”</p><p>“Nope, but your date might.”</p><p>“Alyssa doesn’t care – she’s danced with a few other blokes.” Bill meets my gaze. “How about it, (Name)?”</p><p>“Sure, I’ll dance with you.” My stomach is fluttering and my cheeks are still warm. </p><p>“Great! I’ll come get you for the next slow song.” He actually winks at me before heading back to his friends.</p><p>“Uh, Charlie, what just happened?” I ask in disbelief.</p><p>He laughs. “You caught my brother’s attention, that’s what.”</p><p>We carry our cups of punch back to the table.</p><p>“What’s the matter?” Rowan asks me. “You look out of it.”</p><p>“Bill just asked me to dance,” I whisper.</p><p>“Ah, you lucky girl!” she shrieks. “I better go and find Ben… he brought his Muggle camera with him. You’ll want to remember this moment!” Rowan hurries off before I can even protest.</p><p>Charlie shoots me a strange look from across the table. “What was that all about?”</p><p>“Oh, uh, Rowan wants to make a song request.”</p><p>I can tell that Charlie doesn’t believe me, but Penny distracts him with a story. I don’t even know what she’s saying… I’m too nervous to pay attention. The next song isn’t a slow one and I excuse myself to use the restroom. Girls are lined up in front of the mirrors. I manage to squeeze myself in so I can reapply my lipstick and fix my hair.</p><p>“Very pretty, dear,” the mirror says and I smile at my reflection. <em>You can do this,</em> I tell myself, taking a deep breath.</p><p>Bill is waiting for me outside the Great Hall. He’s taken off his outer robes and he looks quite fit in his tailored trousers, white shirt, and waistcoat. My heart skips a beat when he smiles at me.</p><p>“Has the song started yet?”</p><p>“No, but it will soon. I put in a request.” He offers me his arm and I take it. “You look really beautiful tonight.”</p><p>“So do you,” I blurt.</p><p>Bill chuckles. “Thanks.”</p><p>As we walk back into the Great Hall, ‘Breathe’ by The Cure starts playing.</p><p>“I love this song! How did you know?”</p><p>“I ran into Rowan and I asked her if she knew any of your favorite songs.” Once we’re on the dance floor, Bill places his hands on my waist. A magnetic tingle passes through my body as I wind my arms around his neck.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?” he whispers in my ear.</p><p>“Hmm, that you’re a good dancer.”</p><p>“Is that all?”</p><p>I smile up at him. “How are you at Legilimency?”</p><p>“Completely terrible.”</p><p>“Then I guess you’ll never know.”</p><p>His eyes sparkle with amusement. “I do believe you’re flirting with me, Miss (Last name).”</p><p>“That’s my line, Bill Weasley.”</p><p>He chuckles. “You’re way too cute tonight, you know that?”</p><p>“Thank you, I try.”</p><p>I move closer to him until our bodies are touching. I had daydreamed of this scenario so many times, but my imagination could not replicate the heady scent of his spicy cologne – nor could it capture the sensation of being enveloped in his protective embrace. I close my eyes as we sway to the music. A feeling of euphoric contentment comes over me; this is exactly where I’m supposed to be. And then the song ends and I have to force myself to let go of him.</p><p>Before I can even process what is happening, Bill cups the side of my face and leans down to kiss me on the cheek. “Thanks for such a lovely dance, (Name).” He gives me a shy smile before leaving the dance floor.</p><p>Sensory overload has put me into a state of shock and all I can do is stand there until Rowan comes to get me.</p><p>“Oh my god, oh my god! I can’t wait to develop these photos!”</p><p>I’m smiling like a love-struck fool now. “Rowan, I don’t think I can walk on my own.”</p><p>She puts her arm around me, laughing. “I’ll help you back to the table.”</p><p>I have never felt happier than I do right now.</p><p>“You lied to me, (Name),” Charlie says, snapping me out of my daze. “I know that Bill is the bloke you fancy – and don’t try to deny it either because it’s written all over your face.”</p><p>I look at him, eyes wide. “Please don’t tell him, Charlie. Promise you won’t! I’ll die if he finds out!”</p><p>“Shh, calm down. I’m not going to tell him; I promise.”</p><p>I let out a sigh of relief. “Thank you. And I’m sorry for lying… I was afraid you would say something.”</p><p>“Nah, I know how to keep a secret when it’s important.”</p><p>“You’re a good person, Charlie.”</p><p>He flashes me a crooked grin. “I know.”</p><p>I swat him on the arm. “But you’ve gotta stop with these surprise attacks… my heart can’t take it.”</p><p>“Sorry, sorry,” he says, laughing. “But hey, if it makes you feel any better, I think Bill fancies you too.”</p><p>“No way! It was only a bit of flirting.”</p><p>“I know when my brother has a crush. He was just as starry-eyed as you.”</p><p>I feel my hopes rising. “You really think so?”</p><p>“Absolutely.”</p><p>I’m floating on air again.</p><p align="center">

  <strong>Bonus scene:</strong>
</p><p>Charlie had tried not to get involved, but his brother wasn’t making a move on (Name), and he had heard from Penny – who had heard it from Liz – that a 5th year Slytherin was going to ask her out for Valentine’s day. It was now time for him to intervene.</p><p>“Hey, Bill, I’ve got to talk to you about something important,” he says after dinner. “Come with me for a bit.”</p><p>Bill grumbles, but he follows him through the front doors. “What is it, Charlie? It’s bloody cold out here.”</p><p>“I know you fancy (Name).”</p><p>His brother nearly chokes on his piece of Droobles gum.</p><p>“Why do you think that?”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll list the reasons. 1, you were so obvious about it at the Yule Ball. 2, you gave her your sweater. 3, you’re always asking me how she’s doing. 4, you stare at her during meal times. Need I go on?”</p><p>“Please don’t,” Bill groans. “You’re right… I like her a lot.”</p><p>“Then ask her out!”</p><p>“But what if she only sees me as a replacement older brother?”</p><p>“You know, for such a smart bloke, you can be really thick sometimes. (Name) doesn’t think of you that way.”</p><p>Bill’s expression grows hopeful. “How do you know? Does she fancy me too?”</p><p>Charlie slaps his brother on the back. “I can’t answer that; you’ll just have to trust me. Oh and by the way, a Slytherin chap is planning on inviting her to the next Hogsmeade weekend. Don’t let him beat you to it.”</p><p>“If you’re having me on, I swear I’ll pound you.”</p><p>He laughs. “Like you could! I might be younger than you, but I’m still stronger.”</p><p>Bill grabs him in a head lock. “Take it back, Charles.”</p><p>“Alright, alright, I take it back!” Bill releases him and Charlie rubs the back of his neck. “Bloody hell, you’re pretty strong for a bookworm.”</p><p>“Yeah and you’d better not forget it again!” His expression turns serious. “Are you being straight with me about (Name)?”</p><p>“Yes, William. Just tell her how you feel.”</p><p>“Alright. I’ll ask her to study with me on Saturday.”</p><p>Charlie snorts. “Studying? Oh, that’s real romantic.”</p><p>“Look, I’ve got to lead up to it… I can’t just suddenly ask her to be my girlfriend – I have to set the right mood.”</p><p>“And you think you can do that in the library?” Charlie asks sarcastically.</p><p>“Well yeah, we’ll be sitting close together at a private table. It will definitely work.”</p><p>He rolls his eyes. "If you say so."</p><p>Bill pulls out his brother’s ponytail. “Mouthy brat! And get your hair cut already – I’m sick of you copying my style.”</p><p>“Hey, I am not copying you!”</p><p>“Sure you aren’t.” He grins. “Thanks, Charlie. I owe you one.”</p><p>“Damn right you do.”</p><p>Bill musses his wavy hair. “Come on, little brother, let’s go back inside.”</p>
