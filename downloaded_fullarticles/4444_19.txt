    <p>The first time they met wasn't in a bar or in the lobby of some upscale hotel. It was actually quite silly, truth be told. </p><p>Tony Stark had just been doused by an angry woman. No on purpose, as she was aiming at her dear and possibly ex-boyfriend, but her aim was just that bad. For once, Tony had been an innocent by stander just wanting a Latte Double Espresso with more than half of it chocolate syrup and candy caramel topping. Had wanted. he was currently sticky with something that smelled creamy and he knew that it was going to curdle in this blistering summer heat and leave him smelling absolutely <i>vile</i>. </p><p>The owner of the place was soon brought to the front, hair tied in a french braid and thin-rimmed glasses sitting on his nose. The woman was banned along with her beau, the floor cleaned to a nice polish, and Tony given clothes of soft and well worn cotton until he was clean and his clothing laundered by the proprietor. If he hadn't been so shocked by being innocent for once, he might have objected to being nearly stripped and forced to shower. </p><p>Only as he was leaving did he notice that the man had nice eyes. </p><p>Green.</p>
