    <p>“Hello, Lily. It is good to see you.”</p><p>Hearing the familiar voice, the young witch turned from watching little Harry playing in the garden. James was inside reading letters and getting updates from the order on the state of the war and wouldn't be done for another hour or two. She had time to speak with her friend in peace.</p><p>“Titania. It’s good to see you too, I was starting to think you wouldn’t come.”</p><p>The Fairy Queen smiled sadly, showing off just a hint of pointed fang. Her wild ringleted tresses shone golden in the mid-summer sun, kept out of her pail face tucked behind pointed ears. Forest green eyes streaked threw with gold and silver held the weight of centuries, the only part of her otherwise youthful appearance to show her great age.</p><p>“Ah, my good friend, after all this time you still choose to doubt me? I am wounded by your lack of faith!” the Fae exclaimed dramatically clutching a hand to her chest.</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes at her friend’s antics but was unable to hold back a chuckle. “Enough of that. Now come meet Harry. I can’t believe he’s nearly a year old and I haven’t had the chance to introduce you yet!”</p><p>Lily and Titania had been close friends for over five years now. The fiery witch had saved the Fairy Queen's life during her second year at Hogwarts from the torment of a group of older students when Titania had been lost and injured in her tiny fairy form. Ever since the Queen began to watch over Lily and soon started visiting her whenever she was feeling lost or upset. Before they knew it the two of them were quickly becoming friends. The visits became more often and the pair grew close. The only person closer to Lily was Severus and that was until their argument fifth year. They rarely went more than a month or two without seeing each other. </p><p>“I know, I know.” The Fae woman sighed. “There’s been unrest among the kingdoms lately. Some of those among the Fae Rulers who seek more power wish to align themselves with this Dark Wizard of yours. My allies and I are doing all we can to prevent their interference.” There was a moment of silence before she shook herself. “Enough about that. I didn’t come here to talk about the war. Show me the child.”</p><p>“You make that sound vaguely threatening.” Lily drawls as she bends down to scoop up baby Harry into her arms. “Hey there Pumpkin. There’s someone I want you to meet.”</p><p>Very slowly Harry turns big green eyes on the interesting new stranger with the strange sparkily looking clothing and the funny slanted eyebrows. After a moment’s further inspection, Harry removes the hand from his mouth which he had previously been chewing on and reaches it out to grasp at a wayward strand of wheat-coloured hair; having apparently decided the new person to be ‘safe’. Titania lets out a giggle and extends her arms to Lily who obediently hands her son over.</p><p>“Hello there Harry. It’s so good to finally meet you face to face.” coos Titania as she holds the entranced child against her hip.</p><p>Harry, wanting to explore his new environment promptly begins grabbing at her face and pulling on the points of her ears. She winces but lets him continue with his investigation, even making funny faces and sticking out her tongue to blow a raspberry at him till she has him giggling and squirming in delight. Lily watches as her long-time friend, the woman who grew to be like an older sister to her, plays and laughs with her son, her baby boy, and in that moment she makes a decision.</p><p>“Titania.”</p><p>The Queen looks up at her name, the smile on her face fading at the sad look to her friend’s eyes and the determined set to her shoulders.</p><p>“Lily?” the name becomes a question. She can see that her friend has something important to say. She can only hope that the sinking feeling in her gut is wrong this time, even though it never has been before.</p><p>“In repayment for the Life Dept I am owed, I wish for you; Fairy Queen Titania of the High Fae to protect my son; Harry James Potter from harm and ensure his wellbeing until the time in which the Dark Lord Voldemort is defeated and he is no longer a threat.”</p><p>With those words, Titania let out a gasp as the ancient magics of the Fae surged threw her, binding her and the contract. </p><p>“So it is said so it shall be done.” Resites Titania as she lets the magics settle and sink into her skin. Closing her eyes she takes a deep fortifying breath. “I hope you know what you’re doing Lil. With this, I no longer owe you anything, I won’t be able to save you when he comes for you.”</p><p>A sad smile stretches across the auburn-haired witch’s face, her watery bright green eyes search out their match in the face of her son. She nods once, her gaze never drifting from the tiny head of messy black hair. </p><p>“I’m sure.”</p><p>Finally, she looks back up at the darker green eyes of her friend. They both stare for a minute, neither daring to move as a silent conversation of over a thousand words happens between them. Then still not breaking eye contact Titania gives a single silent nod, barely a dip of her chin but it is enough. Both of them have made their choices and both are committed. One of them to die at the hands of the enemy and the other to watch and do nothing, to go on and protect that which the first shall leave behind.</p><p>For it was, in fact, Lily Potter’s sacrifice which protected her son from Voldemort’s killing curse that fateful Halloween night, though not in the way Albus Dumbledore would come to one day assume.</p>
