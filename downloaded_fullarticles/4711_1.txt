    <p>Dumbledore walked through the grey steel hallway, passing dozens of doors that held the other prisoners. Britain's Institute for the Criminally Dangerous and Insane was a place that was not for the faint of heart. Even hardened veterans sometimes couldn't handle being in a place such as this for long. Screams of anger and pain echoed all throughout the building, sending chills down everyone's spines. The guards walked closely, weapons at the ready in case a prisoner should be extremely difficult. Dumbledore ignored them as his intended client was in isolation at the far end of the building. The head guard used his key card to open the locked metal door before aiming his gun in front. He entered slowly, making sure the prisoner had not escaped its cage.</p><p>Dumbledore walked behind leisurely as the guards entered to change shifts with the current guards. In the large storage room, a large square cage sat in the center of it. And inside was a young man, no older than nineteen, hanging upside down from the torn bed sheets tied to the top of the cage.</p><p>He watched sadly as the young boy he had watched grow, who he once considered an unofficial grandson, was now a prisoner in this dark and dangerous place. All because he was manipulated. It made his heart hurt that a bright young man, full of potential, had been reduced to this.</p><p>Harry James Potter was once going to be something great.</p><p>It was easy to see that the young man had not had a bath in days. His usually soft wild black was greasy and his clean skin was covered in old sweat, dirt and tattoos. His uniform that once was just a white shirt and white shorts were reduced to rags.</p><p>"Hello, Harry." Dumbledore said gently as he sat down, the chair in front and a few feet away from the cage.</p><p>No matter how Harry came to be the man he is now, Dumbledore would always have a soft spot for him. He watched routinely as Harry opened his vibrant green eyes, (the same as his mother Lily) and untangle himself from the bed sheets.</p><p>He sauntered up to the bars and gave a wide smile. "Hello Albus."</p><p>"I see you have found something to entertain yourself." Dumbledore smiled softly. He knew he had to slowly ease into their session because even before Harry became this way, Harry hated talking about his own problems, deeming them unimportant. And now that he was dangerous and easily provoked, one had to be careful with how they tread. "You know, climbing on the bars is forbidden." he chided gently.</p><p>Harry pouted. "But its sssooo boring in here! When can I play? I want to play with the guards. <em>He </em>would have loved to see me mess with the guards."</p><p>"And who is <em>He?</em> " Albus asked conversationally. Though everybody in the room knew who Harry was referring too.</p><p>The King of the Underworld - Lord Voldemort.</p><p>"My Puddin."</p><p>Dumbledore stroked his white beard in thought. "And why would he like you to play with the guards?"</p><p>He had to be careful with his questions. They needed to know how to defeat the man and Harry's unknowing willingness to give information, needed to be handled delicately.</p><p>Harry sighed dreamily before giving a smirk. "He said he loved it when I got playful and violent. It made him horny and he just had to have me."</p><p>Dumbledore did not outwardly show what he was thinking. He had much practice at keep a neutral face when dealing with patients and their sometimes surprising information. It wouldn't be the first nor the last time for Dumbledore, knowing that some people were aroused by violence. And apparently, the King was no exception. But they needed to know his weaknesses.</p><p>"Did your...Puddin' become aroused when another would do the same thing? Does he have others like you?"</p><p>Harry's easy grin slid off his face before contorting into an angry snarl. "I'M THE ONLY ONE! HE DOESN'T NEED ANYONE ELSE! HE SAID HE ONLY NEEDED ME!"</p><p>"I'm sorry for making you angry Harry, but I needed to ask because you are in here and he is still free outside. How do you know that he hasn't taken another lover? He could be betraying your love and trust. Do you deserve that?" Dumbledore implored. He had found a trail and he was going to exploit it as much as possible until it was no longer useful or another trail came along.</p><p>Harry didn't answer but Dumbledore could see the warring emotions in those emerald green eyes.</p><p>Just a little bit more, just a little more doubt.</p><p>"Harry." Dumbledore began sadly. "That man does Not care about you. He manipulated you. He took you away from your friends and family. Your parents were devastated when they saw you on the news as a wanted criminal along with <em>Him. </em>Your mother cried for days and your father and godfathers were just as upset."</p><p>He was laying it thick but if he could show that his family still cared, he would possibly choose to stop their pain and leave the King. Then their would be one less person under his influence.</p><p>"And your dear friends, Ronald and Hermione. They miss you very much. They are always thinking about you, hoping that one day you will come back to them. So you see Harry, you have people who love you unconditionally and want you back home safely."</p><p>The young man said nothing for a few moments. His head was bowed and hands clutching the bars so hard his knuckles were turning white. Then he whispered something so quietly, Dumbledore had to ask again for him to repeat his words.</p><p>"I said, You're wrong." Harry raised his head and green eyes held his resolve.</p><p>Dumbledore inwardly deflated, Harry still believed that the King loved him.</p><p>"Am I?" He questioned.</p><p>Harry moved away from the bars and Dumbledore was worried that Harry wouldn't speak to him anymore until their next session.</p><p>"You don't know my Puddin' Albus. He may not have told me that he loved me everyday of every hour but he showed me with his actions, as did I."</p><p>"Then tell me how I'm wrong." Dumbledore suggested. He had his notebook and pen in hand, ready to take notes on the inner workings between the Queen and King of the Underworld.</p>

  <em>Music was booming, bodies dancing provocatively, and lights flashing were standard things to see when one entered a Night Club. For most, the customers were just having a fun night with friends, lovers or looking for a one night stand to make their night even better. For others, it was a time to conduct shady business, making it just look like acquaintances or business partners just enjoying a night out. </em>
</p><p><em>In the top VIP rooms, a tall handsome man with aristocratic features, curly dark brown hair and the coldest blue eyes one had ever seen, sat regally upon a sofa, sipping his drink while waiting. His white dress shirt had the first few buttons undone with black slacks that complimented his long legs. The music was more of a soft </em>thump, thump, <em>in the background of the room.</em></p><p>
  <em>"Hello, Handsome." </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man didn't acknowledge the new arrival and waited until his bodyguards motioned for them to sit. He finally turned to acknowledge the woman sitting seductively across from him. Fleur Delacour was known to be one the most beautiful women in all of Europe. A French model who was trying to use her allure to have the meeting go as she wanted.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bu the thing that she didn't know was the King only fell one person's allure and that wasn't her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Miss Delacour, What brings you here?" he asked straight to business.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The woman smiled seductively. "I haz heard dat youz got out of ze Azlum."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Indeed."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She pouted a little when Lord Voldemort wasn't reacting the way she had hoped. Most powerful men would boast to her how they accomplished their task and why she should stay with them to be protected. She even wore one of her best seductive dresses. It left nothing to the imagination. If she could just get Voldemort to just look at her, like most men when she came into their vicinity, everything would go as planned. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Fleur Delacour had one goal in mind, to seduce the King of the Underworld and become his Queen. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>No matter what.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You are zo amazing. Such an amazing man like youz needz a woman by he'z zide, No?" Fleur got up sensually. Her dress riding up just so, a little tease of what was underneath. Cold blue eyes watched her disinterestedly and Fleur knew she had to act quick or it was her death.</em>
</p><p><em>She straddled his hips and ran her hands up and down his toned chest. He wasn't signaling his guards or ordering her to stop, so she assumed he liked it. "I can be yoursz Queen." </em> <em>She grind down a little on his hips and was about to start to kiss his neck before he harshly grabbed her hair.</em></p><p>
  <em>Cold blue eyes glared at her and Fleur felt fear crawl up her spine.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His deadly smirk did nothing to ease her fears.</em>
</p><p><em>"You presume too much, Miss Delacour. I already have my Queen and he wouldn't like that you are trying to take his place. He can get quite... </em>dangerous<em> when angered." Voldemort purred darkly.</em></p><p>
  <em>"He?" She asked confused. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lord Voldemort only smirked before letting go of her hair. She didn't have time to soothe her aching scalp before she was harshly pulled off the man's lap and thrown onto the glass coffee table. The sides and corners digging harshly into her body, no doubt going to leave dark bruises. She looked up to find another male dressed in tight black pants and a deep blood red long sleeved shirt, glaring at her with vibrant green eyes. From his looks, she concluded that he was most likely a teenager, maybe between the ages of sixteen and eighteen.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Keep your paws off my Puddin!" the young man snarled.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>This made her angry. Who does this little boy think he is? The King would never go for someone scrawny looking when he could have someone like her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You are juzt zome little boy. Go home to yourz Maman." Fleur sneered back. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The boy sneered before an idea popped in his head and smirked before sitting down on the King's lap, giving her a smug smile before turning to kiss Voldemort. The kiss wasn't chaste at all and the boy was moaning loudly while Voldemort groaned in appreciation. When they finally stopped, saliva was connecting between their mouths. And the older man immediately went to work on kissing and sucking on the boy's neck while the boy just smirked cruelly down at Fleur.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"You are nothing. My Puddin doesn't need some whore for his Queen. He has me." </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Fleur snarled, ready to claw his eyes out with her sharp nails. She moved to attack.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>BANG!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She was dead before hitting the floor.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry placed his Puddin's gun back in its holster, glad that the woman was gone.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Take the body away and don't disturb us." Voldemort ordered his guards, before going back to kissing his Queen's neck. "You were so sexy. I love it when you get angry, Baby."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Why did you let her touch you? Am I not good enough for you anymore Tom?" Harry hissed angrily. He hated that the woman dared touch his Puddin but also that he didn't stop her. It made his heart hurt and burn with jealousy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Voldemort grabbed Harry's face, using his other hand to rub his knuckles against soft skin.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"That whore meant nothing to me, Baby." The older man urged. "You're the only one for me. I admit I let her touch me because I wanted to see you teach her a lesson. To see your beautiful eyes glow in anger."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry pouted. "Promise?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Voldemort said nothing but brought a small package from his pocket and handed it to his Queen. Harry looked at it questioningly. At his lover's nod, Harry tore into it. He gasped in surprise. Harry delicately held a golden locket with a green snake representing an 'S'. He knew this locket.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Wide and surprised green eyes turned to soft blue eyes. "Puddin?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"With this necklace, I promise that you're the only one for me."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Oh! Puddin!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The kiss was rough, possessive, but also soft and full of love that only Harry was allowed to have from his. lover. No one else had held Voldemort's heart until now. They would be together forever, ruling the Underworld.</em>
</p>
<hr/><p>Dumbledore gazed into green eyes to see the love and devotion to the King. Though many said it was a lost cause, he still held some hope that Harry would come to his senses and see that Voldemort was manipulating him the entire time. Because Lord Voldemort does not love. He had considered it a weakness and to let Harry become that weakness was unlike the man.</p><p>He sighed, then gazed sadly at the young man. "I had hope that you would see that he is manipulating you even now. But it seems that our session has come to an end."</p><p>Dumbledore stood from his chair before giving a brief nod goodbye. "Until tomorrow Harry."</p><p>He was almost at the door when Harry called out, "Albus!"</p><p>"Yes, Harry?"</p><p>Harry grinned darkly and it sent foreboding chills down his spine.</p><p>"My Puddin knows Albus."</p><p>"Knows what?" Dumbledore asked.</p><p>"He knows about you and Grindlewald. He knows! He knows~!" Harry sing songed the last part.</p><p>Dumbledore froze. How could he know!? He made sure that his past regarding that man and himself was gone, even ridding those who would have known and told others. If anyone ever found out about his past dealings with Grindelwald, he would be ruined.</p><p>"Hahahahahahah! There's no escape Albus! My Puddin knows! Hahahahahaha!"</p><p>Dumbledore was quick to leave the room, still hearing Harry's laughter following him even though he had long since gotten far away. The laughter haunting his every thought on what the future would hold.</p><p>One thing was sure, Lord Voldemort was not to be underestimated.</p>
