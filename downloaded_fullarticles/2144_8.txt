    <p>
  <span>It was the sight of the child running out into the street that did it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the normal scheme of things, Draco was fairly apathetic in character—or he had been recently. Life seemed to stretch out ahead of him in a long list of items on an agenda. Now, without his father to constantly remind him of how he was expected to behave, he felt all the more at a loss. There would never again be a Lucius Malfoy to tell him how to behave, and Draco couldn't even summon up enough sadness or relief over his father's passing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the other hand, he still had another parent to remind him of social niceties and his filial duties. If Draco was on edge, Narcissa was even more wound up and would inquire after his welfare constantly. For example, when he returned from the washroom, his mother deemed it necessary to check him over to make sure he hadn’t been Polyjuiced and replaced by a body double or suffered any unforeseen injury. Things had changed after the war, and they were never going to be the same again, and Draco had no idea how to make things better. His father had turned out to be a poor giver of advice, but now Draco was devoid of even that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It turned out that Draco had exchanged one puppeteer parent for another, and Narcissa Malfoy was doing her best to step up to bat. This was the reason for his soon to be announced engagement. Narcissa's recent priorities in life had comprised of constant hinting about the brevity of life, not to mention hauling out all of Draco's old childhood items in a massive cleaning spell. There was also the sudden influx of books and magazines on topics such as “How to Find the Perfect Spouse for You Using Astromancy” and “The Safest Cleaning Spells for a Child-Proofed House” that had finally convinced him; his mother had officially lost the plot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, his resolution to remain clear of the fray had never been as strong as Narcissa's good intentions. Draco was piss-poor at defying his parents even when there had been good reason to do so. Without any strong convictions, Draco found himself swept along by the tide of Narcissa’s activities.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A casual set-up led to a few offhand dates, which alerted his mother into arranging a dinner party, which subsequently evolved into regular afternoon tea sessions and finally an al fresco picnic for close friends of around twenty. Draco had been convinced that most of them were hired from another country since he couldn't recall a one of the attendants, but soon there were dinners and proper Pureblooded dates such as visiting the magical karstic caves in a guided tour or listening to an underwater concerto. Extremely exciting stuff, or maybe they would have been if he had actually been attending. Draco might have tuned out for a majority of said events, which is why he woke up one day to be confronted with the reality that he was getting engaged to Astoria Greengrass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was not to say that Astoria Greengrass was a boring cream puff of a witch. Yes, she was beautiful in that perfectly coiffed manner, in which not a strand of hair was out of place, not even when attending the underwater concerto. The folds of her dresses always fell just so, her hands were often tucked in her lap like two interlocking Vs, and her feet were always slanted under her chair off to the side. Even so, she always listened intently to his conversation, and if he dismissed a topic out of hand, she would make a token argument before diplomatically backing off, acquiescing to the haughtiness in his narrowed eyes—which he sometimes affected just as an experiment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn't think she was stupid. If she were, she would have pressed some of his buttons at some point. The fact that she didn't at all showed that she was observant and cunning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco had figured out what was happening with Astoria just a little too late. When he had been a boy of eight, he had come to the realisation that other little boys had mums who weren't as well-put-together as his. His mother was the most beautiful woman in the whole world, and he told her that. “I want to marry someone just like you,” he had told his mother.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Narcissa had laughed and been very touched. The story was repeated to his father at dinnertime, and his fond father had said to his mother, “The boy has good taste.” They had laughed. Draco had gotten an extra serving of mille-feuille. It had been a good day. All that was before the soul-crushing time he had at Hogwarts, where his pretensions were squashed for all time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His mother had maybe taken his avowal a bit too much to heart. Over the next few years, she continued to question him on particulars: did he prefer blonde hair or brunette? did he prefer tall or short? quiet or outspoken? By then, Draco had been thirteen and schooled by a few years of Hogwarts politics. So, he had told his mother that he preferred someone </span>
  <em>
    <span>exactly</span>
  </em>
  <span> like her. Blonde, tall, Pureblooded, demure, fashionable, quiet, etc., etc.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Astoria Greengrass was indeed all of that. She was such a copy of Narcissa that, when they ventured out, she was taken for her daughter. The fact was, Draco and Astoria had even been taken for twins on one of their dates. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco had been so immersed in his own miseries that he had simply acquiesced to all of Narcissa's demands rather than make a giant fuss (and have to do whatever she wanted anyway). He never realised he was dating Astoria until her mother brought up “picking a date” over tea. Draco had sputtered and glanced over at Astoria, who blushed and focused her attention on her tea before glancing up at him through her eyelashes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If he had been in love with someone else, maybe he could have said something. He wasn't, and there was nothing to say. He was inexorably on the road to marriage, followed by—if his mother's astromancy calculations were accurate and he doubted it—three blond children. Oh joy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco supposed it wasn't the worst thing in the world to have children. He had enjoyed bossing around the younger students at Hogwarts since he had never had any siblings or even cousins with whom to play. He had never meant his underclassmen any permanent, malicious harm, though many people probably saw his actions in a different light. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So when Draco saw the little girl toddling out into the street, he raced after her. A brief thought of consequences of such an action and the negative attention it would draw to him flashed across his mind. He was probably quick enough to grab her out of the street.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He almost was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Unfortunately, Muggles were idiots and this one swerved from the path Draco had predicted—up the curb and towards him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco managed to wrap up the little girl in his arms before he tumbled head over heels onto the pavement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Life was grand.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he woke, it was to find a wizened face staring down at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“St. Mungo's?” He winced and shielded his face from the light shining from behind the witch's head. Other than that, he felt incredibly well-rested, as though he had been sleeping for two days. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He tried to sit up and the face above him receded, along with surprisingly small shoulders above equally short arms. Draco groaned as the aches all over his body started to manifest. “Are you sure you gave me pain relief potions?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The light was at a manageable level now, hidden behind some buildings. Draco blinked and took a look around, his arms paused in mid-air. He was not in St. Mungo's, after all, or even in a bed. The ground was hard as rock beneath him. To his left, not three feet away, was the bonnet of a familiar blue car with a person-sized dent on top. Draco hoped that he wasn't the one to have made the dent, but the aches all over his body said otherwise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That wasn't the only strange thing about this scenario, however. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was no one rushing up to inquire after his welfare. Granted, he had been persona non grata for a few years after the war, but now even the silence felt unnatural.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He pulled himself up onto one arm and gingerly swivelled his upper body around. Other than the little person standing in front of him in the middle of the seaside road in Honfleur, France, not a thing stirred around him. He slowly turned his head back around to look at the only other moving person in this scenario.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn't give you pain relief at all,” she said, not moving from his line of sight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Or was she a witch? Draco eyed her warily. He was almost the same height as she was sitting down, and from the look of her nut-brown wrinkled skin, she wasn't a child. She had long, curly hair all down her back. Suddenly, he realised where he had seen her before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He connected the rest of the dots in this scenario. “I tried to rescue you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wasn't a little girl at all, but some sort of a witch who had halted all the people and things in their immediate surroundings. A very powerful witch, then. Or… something else?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco felt for the wand in his sleeve and slowly lurched to his feet, turning unsteadily on his feet as he took in the normally busy wharf. Aside from the soft breeze stirring a few flags and the leaves on the trees fluttering, nothing moved. The entire plaza was at a standstill. His head still felt woozy and he cautiously felt all over his scalp for any tender areas or swollen bumps. Nothing. It was as though he hadn't even been knocked to the ground, even though the memory of it still existed in his mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The car that had driven up the curb was stalled, and the driver had been halted as he attempted to exit his car. His head was ducked, half in and half out of the open door, one hand on the steering wheel and the other braced on top of his car door. His eyes were open and still; his mouth open to voice some unspoken exclamation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A waitress from the nearest cafe had put out one hand, the other hand on her mouth. Her eyes, too, were open and unmoving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All around them were similar other people, frozen in the time that he had jumped out in the street to save the little girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco's lips flattened into a grimace as he turned his attention to the person he had saved. The only thing young about her was her small frame. From behind, she could easily have been mistaken for a little girl. But her face was wizened and lined and her eyes shrewd and focused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Am I dead?” Draco asked. There should have been more things going through his head if he had died. Curiously, though, all he felt was a strange sense of detachment. Maybe he really had died. Surely, he should have felt something more than simply resignation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You're a witch.” His statement lifted on a questionly lilt as his eyes took in her strange little figure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can call me whatever you want. You tried to save me. You did a good thing, so I shall repay you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco glanced back at the little woman, frowning in bemusement. There was something unsettling about her, in a way that even Draco wasn't accustomed to. She wore a little pink dress that, on her small frame, would definitely have confused most people about her age. As he watched, something shifted in her face and, though she didn't move, she suddenly looked substantially younger, like the little girl he had initially taken her for.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco took a wary step back, keeping his eyes on her. “Maybe you can repay me by being more careful in the future.” He frowned as a thought struck him. “You're British.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were in the north of France and she had had a British accent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As if she knew what was passing through his mind, she smiled at him. “Do you even see my lips moving as I talk?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was right. Now that she had pointed it out, he realised that her lips remained in an enigmatic, unmoving curve while the words simply materialised in his head. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Legilimency</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thought and threw up a wall of mind defense, drawing out his wand at the same time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He felt rather than heard her sigh. “No need for that,” she said or maybe she didn't; he was too busy defending his brain. “I saw your sadness and I am at liberty to help you change one thing in your life—if you so desire.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he watched her through narrowed eyes, her image flickered and she turned, once again, into the young eight-year-old girl. He shook his head and blinked hard to dispel the unsettling changes happening in front of him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her words were that of a genie offering tantalising wishes and then he realised—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You're a chronostarii,” he said, rocking back on his heels. “A time witch.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wasn’t sure if he believed it. Time witches were so rare; most were thought to have died out a long time ago. But legend had it that they existed; ageless, childlike, solitary, able to bend time to their will. It accounted for almost everything that was happening before him right now. It was possibly the most interesting thing that had happened to him in recent history; yet he felt as excited as if he had been served with chicken for dinner instead of fish. He massaged the back of his head with his other hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shrugged, as though not much concerned by his need to understand her. “What is one thing you regret most?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There were still many things that Draco regretted by now that he had no idea where to start. His wand arm wavered in resolve and fell to chest-level. If he had the time to ponder his regrets, he'd have a list, or no, a scroll. For a moment, the image that leapt into his mind was a cloud of riotous brown hair and a pair of slim, nimble hands and deft fingers as they sent a flurry of books flying through the air—</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Done,” the chronostarii said and gave him a curious look. “Not what I expected but refreshing nonetheless.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pardon?” he said, brows scrunched together in confusion. “Just a minute, I haven't said anything yet! What—”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She just looked up at him with a strange little smile, which alarmed him more than he could say. He couldn't say anything anyway, because the scene around him suddenly started to dial back in time. He found himself in midair with flailing limbs and saw the Muggles on the street re-enter momentum. The world snapped back into movement like a rubber band, but he continued to float through a series of images, yelling at the top of his lungs all the while. Things flickered in and out of focus and he felt the sudden pull behind his navel like the sensation of a Portkey. During all this time, he continued to see two long, almond-shaped eyes the colour of amber before he popped out of the reality of Honsfleur.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was never saving another person again.</span>
