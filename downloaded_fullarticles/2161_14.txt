    <p>‟Grindelwald, <em>bon sang</em>, wake up!”</p><p>Even in the middle of the night, in her silk chiffon Parisian nightgown adorned with floral lace and a cream silk ribbon around the waist, Vinda Rosier was as fashionable as ever. Her hair were lightly braided and her cheeks were still flushed from sleep; a deep sleep she had unhappily just been roused from.</p><p>You see, she and Gellert Grindelwald, her work partner, were away in Albania for three weeks on a secret mission for the British Ministry of Magic.</p><p>The two were, as was customary on such occasion, sharing a room in a middle class hotel.</p><p>Tonight, they were sleeping in two different beds, but they sometimes had to share one, which wasn’t a big deal to any of them.</p><p>Gellert had been happily married for the last 12 years to his soulmate, Albus Dumbledore, while Vinda was happily seducing women here and there.</p><p>After grabbing him and shaking him by the shoulders for the third time, Vinda let out a small victory cry as her companion finally woke up.</p><p>‟Wha-what?” Gellert was squinting and was sweating profusely. His curls were sticking out and he seemed five years younger than he really was.</p><p>The French witch sat down next to him and patted him on the arm. ‟<em>Mon chéri</em>, you were yelling so much, I thought we were being attacked or something.”She sighed. ‟Did you See something?”</p><p>Gellert let out a sigh of relief as he settled back down on the mattress and allowed her more room next to him. ‟Nein, just a nightmare. An horrible one at that! ”</p><p>Vinda rolled her eyes as she slipped under the covers. ‟What was it about?” She stole one of the blonde’s pillows and turned on her left side to face him. ‟Were you being killed?”</p><p>Gellert dramatically shook his head. ‟No, worse.”</p><p>‟Your husband?Your kids?”She smirked. ‟You turned bald?”</p><p>Gellert closed his eyes as if this conversation was just too horrible to go on. ‟No, far worse.”</p><p>Vinda quirked an eyebrow at him. ‟<em>Bon</em>, pray tell, what was it about? ”</p><p>‟I was having another sprog.” A dramatic pause. ‟ A third one.”</p><p>‟<em>Merde, t’es pas encore en cloque</em>!?” She slapped him on the arm and groaned out loud. ‟When you had Aurelius, I had to work with Travers for two damn months and I don’t think I could stand it this time around.”</p><p>‟Don’t worry, there’s not even a slight chance of it happening ever again with the potion I’m taking daily.” He smirked at her. ‟My subconscious is just messing with me.”</p><p>‟<em>Merci, Merlin</em>!” She let out a breath of relief. ‟Now, shut up will you? We should try to catch some more beauty sleep. After all, we’ve got some serious ass kicking scheduled later on today.” With the crisis now solved, Vinda yawned and turned her back on Gellert as he snorted some more and closed his eyes to get back to sleep.</p><p>Little did he know that his worst nightmare was about to come true. <strong>Times two.</strong></p>
