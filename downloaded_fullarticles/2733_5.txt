    <p>He wasn't sure if he actually believed in god or if he just wanted somewhere that wasn't at the Dursely's. But, sitting here and listening to the pastor talk of god and all the good that god gave his children was a bit of a relieve even if sometimes he caught himself floating into the clouds. "My son, keep sound wisdom and discretion; Let them not escape from your sight and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck, then you will walk on your way securely and your foot will not stumble, if you sit down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet."</p><p><br/>"I didn't figure you on a religious person Potter." He started at the voice, turning he spotted Snape. Who sat down next to him, what was Snape doing here? "I would say the same to you sir." Snape chuckled, clearly amused at the comment. "I use to come here every Sunday with your mother Potter, it's an old habit that I've found to be useful for contemplation." He wasn't quite sure how to take that, his mother and Snape went to this church when they were younger...Did that mean that Snape had lived nearby then? "I didn't know you two were friends." Snape looked down at him, those dark eyes locked as if onto his soul. "We were for a long time, but I pushed her away like a fool." But why was the man telling him all of this? "I'm not sure what to say." There was a slight upturn to Snape's thin lips, "You don't have to say anything Potter." They sat there for a while just listening to the pastor, If there was any man on the world who kept wisdom and discretion in his pocket and didn't allow others to see just what kind of person he really was it was this one. It was rather nice sitting next to the man, he wasn't yelling at least-but why would he show himself now rather than before?</p><p><br/>When service let out he smiled at a few of the others as they said their hello's but found himself drifting over to Snape who'd gotten a cup of coffee and had sat at one of the tables in the sunlight, and with a start Harry realized that Snape was in muggle attire, A dark suit jacket over a crisp white button down, dark suit pants and black dress shoes. He never thought that Snape would be wearing muggle clothes, but it didn't look bad on him. Snape's brow rose as he sat at the table with his cup of tea. "I suppose you would like to ask me some questions mister Potter." He nodded, but maybe not the one's Snape thought he would be asking. "When did you and my mum start coming here?" Snape let out a breath, like he was relived or something "Our first summer at Hogwarts." That was interesting in it's own right, but there was so much he could ask about it all. "Did she believe in god?" Snape smiled, an odd sight for him one that he didn't think he'd have ever seen "I think she wanted to, because she always wondered why god made people so different." So that was a maybe? They talked about his mother for a bit longer before he got up the courage to ask the question that had been burning in his chest.</p><p><br/>"Have you known I was coming here the whole time or?" Snape shook his head, eyes bright with something akin to amusement. "No actually I didn't spot you until last week, how long have you been coming?" Oh, but Snape was a good liar though... "Since the summer of my Third year." Since before the crazy started to happen too much. "Ah, I'm surprised Black didn't try to talk to you here." No name calling? They were in the house of god, it would be considerably rude to bad mouth someone here. "I am too actually."</p><p>Snape glanced at him as they walked out of the church, "I know it's not my place Potter, but your relatives are abusing you aren't they." It wasn't so much a question as rather a comment. "It's not like their hitting me anymore." Snape's eye's which Harry had realized in the sunlight was a dark brown rather than black. "You shouldn't have to do that. Defend them." Was he? "It's not like I have anywhere to go Professor, I go to church and I stay out of the house when I can." Snape sucked in a breath like he was about to say something that wouldn't be taken well. "If you ever need somewhere to go, you can always tell me Potter-I won't let them keep hurting you." And he was blown away; "You know I have to stay." Snape tilted his head downwards, it was the truth and they both knew it. "Even if it's for a night, just to get away." He nodded; "If it ever gets that bad, I'll tell you."</p>
