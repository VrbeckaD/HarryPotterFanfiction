    <p align="justify">The shrill sound of her alarm woke Hermione and she groaned, groggily fumbling for her wand on her bedside table. She aimed a well-practiced blast at the wretched thing jumping around on her desk on the other side of the room. Twisting her hair and jabbing her wand into the bun, she sighed, before throwing back the covers and distractedly patting Crookshanks on the head, who was just as disgruntled as she was by the sound. Blurrily she rubbed her eyes and dragged herself out of bed as she flicked on the lights. She tripped towards the bathroom, tiles cold on her feet once she crossed the threshold. She splashed water on her face, blinking at the prominent black bags under her eyes as she patted her face dry with a towel. A simple <em>reparo</em> charm fixed the shattered clockwork on her desk, and she reluctantly made her way to the kitchen to begin her day.</p><p align="justify">Sighing, she remembered her disastrous date the night before, wondering dully whilst she went through the motions of making tea if she should <em>oblivate</em> herself so she never had to think of it again. <em>A Ravenclaw</em>, she remembered thinking, <em>Our first date was only brief, but maybe this time we will have an intellectual conversation about the news or recent discoveries in properties of the number seven, a unprecedented breakthrough since Bridget Wenlock first described its importance for arithmancy.</em></p><p align="justify">She snorted into her tea, whilst Crookshanks wound around her feet. Apparently, arithmancy had been one of her date’s interests, although when she tried in vain to address the topic in a desperate attempt to salvage what was left of the conversation, the man all of a sudden had not known what to say at all.</p><p align="justify">“There, there.” She said, pouring Crookshanks’ food into the red bowl on the floor, scratching him behind the ears, “Neither you nor me thought it would end so badly, hm?”</p><p align="justify">And ended badly it had. After showing up ten minutes late, her date had proceeded to launch into a tirade about how one of the recently passed ministry bills that allowed certain witches and wizards, including some death eaters, the possibility of parole was the worst idea in the history of the wizarding world and how, as a ministry employee, couldn’t she fix that?</p><p align="justify">She glanced out of the window framed by sunny-yellow curtains in an attempt to hold off her building irritation, but her eyes only met the flickering of a streetlamp in the darkness below. Unsuccessful, she returned to her bedroom whilst clutching her mug.</p><p align="justify">She worked for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Unless the death eater her date was referring to was an angry goblin or a fully transformed Fenrir Greyback, there was little she could do to make sure they stayed incarcerated. More than anything, she had already had a lengthy discussion of the matter at the weekly Weasley dinner, and was loath to reiterate all her points. Ron and Ginny had fumed, Harry and Percy had agreed with her, Mrs. Weasley had tried to keep the peace, and George had been heart breakingly silent.</p><p align="justify">The new bill would allow witches and wizards that only joined the ranks during Voldemort’s second rise to power to have the possibility to be pardoned on parole, given certain considerations. The list was long, but included things such as their reasons for joining, evidence of coercion, and if they had ever actually killed anyone. Some individuals had been forced to join the Dark Lord as a last resort, the ministry had argued.</p><p align="justify">Hermione sighed, pulling on her clothes for the day, whilst trying to drink her still scalding tea. She brushed her hair into something that resembled a ponytail, chugged the rest of her tea, and quickly, but meticulously, brushed her teeth. Her parents were dentists, and some childhood lectures were always remembered.</p><p align="justify">The truth was, the wizarding world was horribly short on people at a working age, Azkaban was bursting at the seams, even minor dark arts uses could land someone in there for a week, the crime rate was stagnant at best, and there simply weren’t enough resources anywhere. Five years later, their world was still reeling from the aftermath of the damage caused by the second wizarding war.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Clearly, they haven’t learned from the first time! What, all the death eaters who ‘pretended’ they had been under the imperious curse, but as soon as he-who-must-not-be-named came back, immediately crawled back to him?” The Ravenclaw had said.</em>
</p><p align="justify"><em>“Voldemort is definitely dead this time.” Hermione had countered,</em> “<em>Shouldn’t people who were forced to make decisions to protect their family be allowed to have a second chance? Many people went along with what he did because they were scared. That includes many ministry employees, and just because they never openly opposed his rule, are now set to be in Azkaban for the next ten years. I don’t think anyone truly believes they deserve that.”</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em>“So? They still made their decision. They could have just refused to go along with his demands. Or fought back! Things would never have gotten so bad if people hadn’t just focused on themselves and tried to ignore everything before it ended up in bloodshed.”</em>
</p><p align="justify"><em>“Oh? And where </em>exactly<em> were </em>you<em> during the wizarding war?”</em></p><p align="justify">
  <em>He had sniffed, “I was in hiding of course. I didn’t compromise my values and side with he-who-must-not-be-named.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Not everyone had that ability to make that choice!” Hermione had been livid.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Everyone makes their decisions, it’s not our fault they made the wrong one.” Her date had looked at her imperiously, “For the apparently brightest witch of your age, your ideas are pretty stupid.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">After that, blood boiling, Hermione had left. Her hand curled into a fist now just thinking about it, and she took a deep breath to unclench her death grip on the mug. She unceremoniously dumped the purple ceramic into the sink and waved her wand so it started washing itself. Disagreements, discussions, even arguments, she could stand. An insult to her intelligence, the only thing she could always pride herself in, she could not.</p><p align="justify">After her relationship with Ron ended, Hermione had decided that in a partner she would also look for a more intellectual connection, so they could have something to talk about. Now, at the age of 24, she wondered if she should just go for physical attraction and wait with the intellectual stuff until she was 30.</p><p align="justify">Groaning, she pulled on her shoes and flooed in to work.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Opening the door to her small shared office, Hermione sighed. A large window dominated the wall opposite to the door. The indoor fern hanging in front of it was dying a slow death by dehydration and miserably serenading the sun as it crept over the horizon. It was barely seven o’clock.</p><p align="justify">The cause of her sigh had been the desk on the right side of the room, which was cleaned spotless. Not a single piece of paper remained; all of those had been moved to her desk on the left were they were precariously balanced on the edge, and she had spent the whole of the last week trying to work through the stack of parchment. The filing cabinet next to her desk was stuffed full, the top drawer no longer closing as she squeezed her way past it to get to her chair. The ancient piece of furniture creaked as she sat down and fought the urge to burst into tears when looking at the mountain of paperwork that faced her.</p><p align="justify">Her seventh partner this year had resigned at the start of the previous week, giving no reason as to why. Hermione knew exactly why; the work they did here was thankless, and most of it was chasing down some obscure magical creature that had broken some kind of law it didn’t even know existed. The rest of the work was chasing down witches and wizards, sometimes muggles, illegally handling or trading magical beasts, and that was even more exhausting than trying to find a bowtruckle on a tree.</p><p align="justify">The continuous reassignment of partners did little to help with the overwhelming workload. “If someone stayed around for more than a few weeks, that would be really great.” She muttered to herself, popping the lid off her ink pot.</p><p align="justify">Her previous partner had been shockingly disorganised, and trudging through the files left behind highlighted a number of overdue cases she had never thought to mention to Hermione. She ploughed through them. Reports of neighbours illegally keeping a hippogriff in a shed, and a mysterious case of muggles being severely depressed after consuming honey. There was also a centaur shooting arrows at a wizard that decided to step on his land, a case which was, quite frankly, considerably above her paygrade.</p><p align="justify">Her quill scratched across the parchment, and she rolled her shoulders as she finally finished sorting the last of the reports in order of priority. Waving her wand, she sent it flying towards the pile on the floor, and pulled out a heavy book, a revised edition of one of Newt Scamander’s most comprehensive books. She needed make some headway on one of the most overdue cases, this one specifically about what she was sure was a probable glumbumble infestation in the local beekeeping facility in the Thames Valley.</p><p align="justify">She did not hear the knock that sounded on the office door, and she did not hear the whining of the door as the hinges complained when it was opened. She <em>did</em> hear the rather loud cough from her supervisor, and her head snapped up.</p><p align="justify">“Miss Granger? Can I introduce you to your new partner-in-training?”</p><p align="justify">Their eyes met, and he looked oddly elated and like he was going to throw up at the same time, before the expression quickly vanished and was replaced with a disdainful sneer.</p><p align="justify">Hermione could only stare, shocked.</p><p align="justify">It was Draco fucking Malfoy. </p>
