    <p>Bellatrix Black is many things. She is a survivor. She is a warrior. She is a fanatic and a mad woman and a murderer. She is the dark side of the moon. She is the ember of fire glowing in the center of a dead volcano, slowly growing hotter, brighter, waiting for the time to be right. </p><p>  She is also very drunk and stuck up a tree. </p><p>  “How in Merlin’s gunky wisdom teeth did she get up there?” Ron says, head tilted back.</p><p>  “I climbed, you cunt,” she says. She wavers, hand against the rough trunk of the tree, an eye slipping closed. </p><p>  “Can’t you climb back down?” Harry calls up.</p><p>  “What does it look like, Harry?” Hermione says, glowering. </p><p>  Sheepish, he swallows. “I mean, she got herself up there.” </p><p>  “Did not!” Bellatrix says with a hiccup. </p><p>  There is a thump and the trio look down to see a bottle of firewhisky lying in the leaves pooled at the base of the tree. It is, unsurprisingly, empty.</p><p>  “Blimey,” Ron says. “She’s not going anywhere like that.” </p><p>  “We could levitate her down,” Harry suggests. </p><p>  “You point one wand at me and I will eat your guts, Potter!” Bellatrix screams. </p><p>  “That’s it,” Hermione says, wearing her best determined frown. “Hold my coat.” </p><p>  “You’re sure, Mione?” Harry says. He winces as she shoves the garment into his arms. “She looks a bit...vicious.” </p><p>  “Fuck you, Potter,” Bellatrix mumbles. </p><p>  Bellatrix sits quietly as Hermione shimmies and climbs her way up the tree. She peers down as the girl looks up at her with those ridiculous doe eyes, clinging to the trunk of the tree like a kitten in a storm. </p><p>  “May I sit next to you?” she asks. </p><p>  Bellatrix snorts. Only Hermione Fucking Granger would feel the need to ask for permission to sit on a tree branch. Only Hermione Fucking Granger would give two stinking shits about a former Death Eater’s feefees. </p><p>  “I suppose,” Bellatrix drawls, doing her best nonchalant impression. Really, she watches the girl as carefully as her buzzing vision will allow. It would be such a shame if she were to slip and snap that pretty little neck. </p><p>  Hermione hauls herself up onto the branch, balancing as she tucks herself between Bellatrix and the tree. Idly, Bellatrix wonders what the girl would do if she touched her, passing her cool fingers over the smooth muscles of her forearm, maybe a bit higher, over her shoulder, round to the back of her neck. </p><p>  Probably fall out of the fucking tree, the idiot. </p><p>  Hermione shifts, flashing an uncertain smile. “Why are you out here?” </p><p>  Bellatrix frowns, looking from their tree branch to the house below them. Every window is aglow, the faces inside happy and laughing, the voices boisterous, their energy sparking. They make her feel rankled and trapped, like an animal cornered in the back of a burrow, hounds snapping at its face. </p><p>  “I don’t like the crowd,” she says simply. Because words hurt her, reveal too much. </p><p>  “Oh,” Hermione says. </p><p>  Bellatrix looks at her from the corner of her eye, casual like. She’s pretty, for a mudblood. Her eyes are large and dark, her lips make a cute little bow. The way she draws her brows together as she frowns is nothing short of a poetic masterpiece. The moonlight on her skin is sex. </p><p>  “The booze was shit, anyway,” Bellatrix says, distracting herself.</p><p>  Hermione sniffs her, giving a soft laugh. “Couldn’t have been too awful.” </p><p>  “It’s piss water. Swill. Bile mixed with troll puke.” </p><p>  “You have very strong feelings on the matter.” </p><p>  “Also, the meatloaf was dry. And that girl Draco brought….The nerve of her, stepping out of the house looking like that. I’ve seen sexier house elves.” </p><p>  “She’s very nice.” </p><p>  “She’s a tart.” </p><p>  Hermione gives her a knowing look, her smile sly. It’s a strange expression to see on a girl who looks so innocent and it intrigues Bellatrix, makes her lean forward, bringing their faces close together. She expects the girl to flinch away, to flush and slip off, like mist through her fingers. Instead she stays perfectly still, meeting Bellatrix’s eyes without a sign of wavering. And damned if the little trollop doesn’t smirk. </p><p>  My, my, Bellatrix thinks. What do we have here? </p><p>  Gryffindor courage indeed. </p><p>  “Oi!” comes a shout from below. “My bollocks are freezing off!” </p><p>  “You’re as flat as a Ken doll, Ronald,” Hermione snaps. “Shut it!” </p><p>  “What is a Ken doll?” Bellatrix asks.</p><p>  Hermione explains and Bellatrix’s face freezes. She coughs. She sneezes. And then she cackles, her head thrown back, her hair dark on her shoulders, her lips sinfully red. </p><p>  Steady on, Granger, Hermione thinks. She licks her lips, her mouth suddenly dry. </p><p>  “We really should be getting down,” Hermione says. “They won’t go anywhere until we do.” </p><p>  Bellatrix groans. She looks down and the ground seems impossibly far, as if she’s staring down from a broomstick, fluttering in the clouds. </p><p>  “Must we?” </p><p>  Giving that small smile again, Hermione places a hand on her thigh. Bellatrix tries not to look down at it, tries to ignore the stupid giddy butterflies flying happily in her stomach. </p><p>  “I could cast a feather-light charm on you,” Hermione says. “And carry you down. On my back.” </p><p>  “I didn’t know you wanted me on top of you,” Bellatrix purrs. “We’ve only just started chatting after all.” </p><p>  Hermione rolls her eyes. “You’re not as charming as you think you are.” </p><p>  “Are you sure?” </p><p>  “Yes.” </p><p>  Bellatrix huffs. “I’m sure you’re mistaken.” </p><p>  “Yes or no, Bellatrix?” </p><p>  “It’s always a yes to you, Granger.” </p><p>  Ah, there it is. A flicker, some undefinable emotion. It is brief, but it is there, a candle flame flicker. She wants to cup it in her hands, breathe it to life. </p><p>  Holding her wand, Hermione murmurs the incantation. “Come on, let’s get this over with.” </p><p>  Carefully, trying not to look down, Bellatrix maneuvers herself so that she is pressed against Hermione’s back. She wraps herself around her, eagerly pressing into the warmth of her body. </p><p>  Hermione lets out a croak, tugging at her arms. </p><p>  “Sorry,” Bellatrix murmurs, loosening her grip. </p><p>  “It’s fine,” Hermione gasps. She pauses. “Bellatrix, what is that in my back?” </p><p>  “Calm down, Granger. It’s only my wand.” </p><p>  “Big wand.” </p><p>  “Very.” </p><p>  “Right.” Hermione shifts, trying to acquaint herself with the body pressing into her, as close to her as her own skin. “Why are you wearing combat boots?” </p><p>  “You never know when you’ll have to dole out a good curb stomping.” </p><p>  “At a party? With friends and family?” </p><p>  “Especially those kind.” </p><p>  Hermione laughs and Bellatrix feels her chest swell with pride. She wants very much to make her laugh again. Every day, maybe. </p><p>  “Hold on. But try to keep your bony arms away from my neck.” </p><p>  “They’re not bony! They’re very supple and soft, I’ll have you know. Except the biceps. Those are pure, fire blasted iron.” </p><p>  And down they go, Bellatrix clinging for dear life to Hermione’s back. She tries not to acknowledge the trust she is putting in the young woman. Instead, she focuses on the way she moves, the feel of her muscles coiling and releasing. The way she smells, like dust settled after a cool rain, like lemongrass and plain black tea. </p><p>  Hermione’s feet hit the ground and the idiots are clapping, Potter and Weasel flushed with the cold air. </p><p>  “Well done, Mione,” Potter says, smiling that stupid dazzling smile of his. “Can we go back in now?” </p><p>  Hermione removes the charm from Bellatrix and the dark haired witch takes an abrupt step forward. The boys flinch back, faces panicked. </p><p>  Bellatrix giggles. She retrieves the empty firewhisky bottle from the ground. “Recycling,” she says by way of explanation, and off she bounces. </p><p>  “Merlin, she terrifies me,” Ron says. </p><p>  “Yeah,” Harry says. </p><p>  “I think she’s cute.” </p><p>  Heads whipping around, both boys stare at Hermione, their expressions shocked. </p><p>  “What?” Harry says. </p><p>  Hermione gives a distracted smile. “Hm?” </p><p>  “Didn’t know you fancied witches,” Ron says, his face suddenly red enough to start a nuclear meltdown. </p><p>  “That’s because you’re about as observant as a deaf man with no sense of smell and onions for eyes,” Hermione says. </p><p>  Harry winces. Ron looks three seconds from a heart attack. </p><p>  With a deep scowl, Hermione twists on her heel and stalks towards the house. </p><p>  Both boys exhale. </p><p>  Inside, Hermione weaves through the press of bodies and voices, intent on finding the liquor table. Bellatrix had the right idea. There is no surviving these things sober. </p><p>  Bellatrix. </p><p>  Her stomach knots and she bites her lip. When did that happen, she wonders. Was it last Christmas when Andromeda placed a Santa hat with a sticking charm to Bellatrix’s head? She spent the entire night frowning adorably, every step causing the bell at the end of the hat to give a cheery jingle. </p><p>  Or was it summer holiday when she came out to the pool wearing practically nothing and her legs were so fucking long and the line of her throat was just perfect. </p><p>  Maybe it was that night in October when she found her curled up in a chair in the library, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, her face inches from a book that looked suspiciously like a bodice ripper. A very graphic bodice ripper if the brief flash of words Hermione saw was anything to go by. But then, she hadn’t seen much, Bellatrix screeching like a banshee and chasing her from the room, screaming about all the ways she would rip her hair out. </p><p>  She wasn’t sure when, but somewhere in there Bellatrix Black had become very interesting. Interesting enough to think about at the end of the night, just as she dropped off into sleep. And certainly interesting enough to think about first thing in the morning, stretching and yawning, her name like a bright thing behind her eyes. </p><p> She’s nearly there, eyes on the salvation of a very nice looking bottle of wine, when cool fingers wrap around her wrist, pulling her. She opens her mouth to speak, but a hand presses over her lips. A whirl and a door slam later and she’s in darkness. </p><p>  The sound of the party muffled, Hermione raises her hands. Carefully, she touches the face pressed close to her own, traces the nose, the lips, the sharp line of a jaw. The chin, the throat, down cool fabric until her fingers brush what is very likely to be a corset. </p><p>  “Bellatrix.” </p><p>  “Hello, Granger.” </p><p>  “What do you think you’re doing?” </p><p>  “Seducing you.” </p><p>  She begins to retort, but her mouth snaps shut. She blinks in the darkness.</p><p>  “Oh,” she says. </p><p>  “That’s it? No witty come back? No inspired diatribe?” </p><p>  “I’m not really sure what to say.” It’s a first for her. </p><p>  Fingers smooth over her sweater, running over her stomach, dipping lower, toying with the button of her pants.</p><p>  “It’s not what you should say, but what you should do,” Bellatrix whispers, her teeth at her earlobe. </p><p>  “Are you saying - “ </p><p>  “Merlin’s infected bowels, less talking, more snogging, Granger.” </p><p>  And then they are kissing, Bellatrix’s lips tracing over her own, her hands curling in her hair, fitting their mouths together. Bellatrix’s tongue touches hers and she’s sure her chest will explode, her eyes will melt right out of her skull. And then she deepens the kiss and fuck, she understands everything. The songs, the books, the poems - all that garbage about longing and passion and fucking and love, she knows what it means now. It’s no longer an abstract idea to her, it is a real thing, clutched between her hands, wrapping around her tongue. </p><p>  It’s Bellatrix Fucking Black. Tasting like firewhisky and promises, tasting like sex and love. </p><p>  Their lips part, Hermione chasing, Bellatrix laughing as she presses her into the wall, denying her. </p><p>  “Now, now, Granger. Best not to be hasty. Good things come with patience, don’t you know?” </p><p>  “You’re one to lecture me about patience.” </p><p>  A quiet chuckle. “Would you like to have dinner with me?” </p><p>  “Dinner?” </p><p>  A sigh of exasperation. “Yes, woman. Dinner. We eat, have good conversation, perhaps more of this mouth to mouth action, I sacrifice a few orphans. The usual.” </p><p>  “Erm - I - “ </p><p>  “Fine, you’ve convinced me. I’ll leave the orphan bit out. Say yes.” </p><p>  Hermione stutters. </p><p>  Warm breath touches her lips, moves, teeth nipping at her pulse. </p><p>  “Say yes, pet.” </p><p>  Hermione swallows and prays she doesn’t die. </p><p>  “Yes,” she says. An exhalation of breath, an admittance. </p><p>  She can feel Bellatrix smile. “Lovely. Wear nice knickers. Lacey ones.” </p><p>  Hermione gapes and then Bellatrix is gone, the closet door open, letting in the light. </p><p>  Ambling by, Harry Potter comes to an abrupt halt. He peers into the closet, looking down at the girl puddled on the floor.</p><p>  “Mione! Are you okay?” </p><p>  She looks at him. She grins. “Bellatrix Black just snogged me.” </p><p>  “Damn,” Harry says. “How was it?” </p><p>  “Fucking hot.” </p><p>  “Put it here.” </p><p>  They bump fists. </p><p>  Harry considers. “Malfoy is gonna have an aneurysm.” </p><p>  “Fuck Malfoy.” </p><p>  Harry snickers. “So was there tongue?” </p><p>  “Close the door, Harry. Let me tell you - “ </p><p>  He shuts the door and they light their wands and Hermione tells him everything.</p>
