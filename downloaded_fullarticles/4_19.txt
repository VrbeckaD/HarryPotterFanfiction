    <p>“So how’d you two meet?” the Weasley aunt before you asked. What was her name again? Agnes? Cordelia? Honestly, you couldn’t keep up with all these relatives!<br/>You laughed, clinging on to Fred’s arm and giving a sweet smile. It was a standard question, so standard that it was cliché, and you’d been asked it at least three times already this evening.<br/>“We went to school together”<br/>“But we didn’t start dating until a few months ago,” Fred added.<br/>“I wandered into his joke shop on a whim and we ended up talking through the night until morning”<br/>It was the story you’d been telling people all evening as you made your way around the reception at Ron and Hermione’s wedding. It wasn’t wrong, you and Fred had known each other since the first week of school and you hadn’t actually started dating until a few months ago, but as a story it left a lot out. It satisfied the prying aunts, uncles, cousins and distant relations, who all heard it and started cooing about ‘young love’ and ‘sweethearts’, but you knew it ignored so much. So many years of missing the obvious and dancing around each other.</p>
<p>Fred Weasley had taken his time asking you out and it had been both infuriating and adorable.<br/>He could have done it when the two of you were still at school. When he was all winks and cheekiness and you still got him confused with his brother half the time. When you were trying to keep out of trouble and get your head around your homework and he was doing his very best to get you into it with him, in between showing off at quidditch practice and pretending not to know your name. While the two of you were low-level friends, hanging out because your best friend was friends with his best friend’s crush or whatever it was. Yeah, it wasn’t inconceivable that he could have asked you out then. And if he’d caught you on a good day you might even have said yes.<br/>He hadn’t, though, like you hadn’t asked him, and upon reflection you decided that was the right decision. You’d just been children, changing and figuring out how to be. Everything that had happened since then would have torn you apart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He could have done it during the battle for Hogwarts. The words could so easily have slipped from his lips as he stood, dripping wet in the wake of your Aguamenti spell which had just washed away the man, now unconscious against a wall but who, seconds earlier, was a heartbeat away from killing the twin with red hair and a twinkle in his eye he’d always reserved just for you. If he’d asked you to be his then the chances are you would have splashed across the corridor, taken his dripping face in your hands and kissed him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’d actually asked you months later, on a rainy Thursday afternoon when the world was settling back into something that looked like normality. No one but Fred had been in the shop but the bell had rung signifying the door had opened and there you were, dry despite the rain and staring at him. Your name fell from his lips and Fred wasn’t sure if he walked or apparated to your side but he hugged you so tight you couldn’t breathe. He shut up the shop early, no one was coming in anyhow, and you went for a butterbeer which became two which became dinner which became drinks at his place and you’d talked from sunset to sunrise and after. Because honestly you’d been dancing around each other for years without ever knowing it and now you couldn’t bear to let each other go.</p>
<p>So, yeah, you’d met at school. But that wasn’t really it at all.</p>
