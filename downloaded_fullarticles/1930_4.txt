    <p>Sirius Black stood in the principal's office, shuffling on his toes. He had been sent to the office a lot of times. He and his friends, James and Peter were the biggest pranksters in the school and being sent to the principal's office wasn't new for him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But today, he wasn't in the office due to any prank, it was because the principal wanted Sirius to help the boy sitting besides him. The boy had curly brown hair falling over his forehead, amber eyes that kept flickering around the room, and freckles across his cheeks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The boy, Remus Lupin, as the principal had told Sirius, had crutches as he had been through an accident. There were also some scars on his arms, neck and face, probably due to the accident, Sirius thought. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius had seen Remus in classes many times, but he hadn't noticed him before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Remus Lupin may have to be with crutches for two or three weeks,” the principal told Sirius. “I hope you will help him for the time being.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I surely will,” Sirius agreed. He turned to Remus and smiled, who gave him a small relieved smile in return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So, is it okay to ask how you got into an accident?” Sirius asked as they left the principal's office and were walking to the class. Sirius was holding both his and Remus’ books.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus sighed. “I was in a car with my… with one of my friends and we collided with a truck and…  I don't really remember much after that.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius winced inwardly, regretting asking the question. “Your friend, is he?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He is okay. He was also injured, but he is fine now,” Remus murmured. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That's good,” Sirius said. They walked silently for the rest of the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As they entered the classroom, James and Peter were sitting on their usual seat. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey, Sirius!” James greeted him. He frowned as his eyes settled on Remus. “Who's this?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He is Remus Lupin,” Sirius said. “And I am going to help him for some weeks as he is injured.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>James turned back to Remus and smiled. “Alright. I am James Potter and this is Peter Pettigrew.” He nodded towards Peter, who gave an encouraging smile to Remus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It's nice to meet you,” Peter said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It's nice to meet you as well,” Remus said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They sat down on the seat behind James and Peter. “How many days of school did you miss?” Sirius asked as he handed Remus his books. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Over a week,” Remus replied. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can help you catch up with studies during our free classes,” Sirius offered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You… You don't need to do that… It's not,” Remus began.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It's fine. I want to help you,” Sirius cut him off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thanks,” Remus gave him a fond look that made Sirius’ heart flutter, though yet he had no idea why.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After just some classes, Sirius came to the realization that he loved spending time with Remus a lot. Remus was probably one of the funniest and sweetest persons Sirius had ever talked to. He couldn't quite understand how he had became friends with Remus so fast and what drew him to the other boy, until James asked him about it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They were sitting in the maths class. Remus didn't take this class with them, so Sirius was a bit anxious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“James, are you sure he will be doing fine in the class alone?” Sirius asked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sirius, you've asked me the same question a hundred times now,” James replied. “I am sure he is fine. And Evans takes the class as well. From what I think, they are good friends, she will help him.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Alright,” Sirius muttered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I hadn't thought you would get along with him so fast,” James commented. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius shrugged. “He's really nice… He's funny and sweet.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sounds like someone has a crush,” James teased. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius might have responded with some snarky remark if his mind wasn't so busy thinking over James’ words. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Could he have a crush on Remus? He did like Remus a lot. The other boy had something about him that drew Sirius towards him. Thinking of Remus now made him realize that he did actually have a crush on Remus. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fuck! What was he going to do?</p>
