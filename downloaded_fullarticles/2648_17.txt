  <br/>
</p><p>Graduation day over. The sky over Quidditch Stadium, where the ceremony had been held, was painted in hues of red, purple, and orange as the sun set.</p><p><br/> Hermione stood proudly at the top of the stairs before the Grand Entrance of Hogwarts. She smiled as flashes of her fond memories whizzed by. She had three reasons why she was grateful. One reason was the fact that she was able to help Harry defeat Lord Voldemort last year. It was hard and trying year to find something hidden by Lord Voldemort. The second reason was the fact that she was able convince the boys to come back and complete their education with a danger free Hogwarts. Her last reason was graduating with top honours and being accepted into the most prestigious wizarding college for Transfiguration.<br/> </p><p>She walked into the castle and slowly made her way towards the Gryffindor Common Room to get ready for her final dance as a student. She smirked as different memories popped up as she walked by a certain bathroom or classroom.<br/> </p><p>“VICTORY”<br/> </p><p>She passed through the common room’s portrait and went up to the Head Girl's room to jump into the shower. She couldn’t believe that she was getting dressed up for the last time. Hermione first chuckled and then grimaced at the memory of the Yule Ball. She had wanted to go with Ron but Victor Krum asked her first. A smile graced her face thinking about her current boyfriend, Ron. They have been together since the end of the Final Battle. Her face lit up as she thought about how much Ron had grown. He still had his moments but he’s still a sweet man.<br/> </p><p>There was a knock at the door.<br/> </p><p>"Come in!"<br/> </p><p>"Are you ready yet?" as Ginny Weasley breezed into the room.<br/> </p><p>"No, I still have to do my hair. I am surprised that you aren't with Harry."<br/> </p><p>"Too early.”<br/> </p><p>Harry and Ginny got back together shortly after all the funerals, official dinners and interviews in regards to the Final Battle. They agreed to take their time and rediscover themselves and their friends. They went through a lot in the past year and it was going to take a while to adjust and become whole once again.<br/> </p><p>"Besides he is helping Ron put on his new dress robes. At least, these are better than the last one he wore." The girls giggled and gagged over the ghastly ruffled dress robes that Ron wore at the Yule Ball.<br/> </p><p>"That's good. He was never really good at tying the bow part of the robes but then again neither was Harry," chuckled Hermione. She remembered the many times that she had to do both of their ties over the years.<br/> </p><p>Ginny laughed as well.<br/> </p><p>Hermione came out of the bathroom to see Ginny for the first time. "WOW, Ginny. You look stunning in your dress.”<br/> </p><p>Ginny was wearing a forest green dress with spaghetti straps on her shoulders with a V shape back that went down to the small of her back. The dress’s length was just below the knee and billowed out at the skirt. She was wearing 6" pumps to match with emerald earrings and necklace set that Harry gave her at Christmas time that were his mother's. His father brought the set for his mother.<br/> </p><p>"Thanks Hermione!"<br/> </p><p>Ginny whistled at Hermione when she finally caught a look at her, "Hermione! You look absolutely beautiful. My brother won't know what hit him when he sees you."<br/> </p><p>Hermione gave Ginny a Cheshire cat smirk. Hermione was wearing a deep red dress with gold straps and trim. It brought out her gold flecks in her hair, which was pinned up with a gold lion hairpiece. She was wearing a Garnet and gold necklace and earring set, presented to her by her parents for Graduation. As Hermione ran her hand along the necklace, she recalled her memories of her parents’ disappointment and the slow recovery of their trust with her. The necklace was their first gift since they reunited. On her feet, she had on a pair of gold 6" heels so she can dance better with her taller boyfriend, Ron Weasley.<br/> </p><p>"Thanks, Ginny. I really appreciate the compliment before we see your brother," Hermione teasingly grinned.<br/> </p><p>Ginny laughed at her brother’s expense of forgetting to compliment Hermione when she is all dolled up.<br/> </p><p>"Ginny? Are we ready to go to have some fun?"<br/> </p><p>Ginny could only breathlessly jerked her head as they walked out of the room. They went down the girls' staircase that led to the common room.<br/> </p><p>"I hope the boys are ready for us," remarked Ginny as she followed Hermione.<br/> </p><p>Hermione dipped her head in reply since she was busy making sure that everything was in place. As she approached the bottom of the stairs, she looked up at hearing voices. She froze in her tracks at the bottom of the stairs.<br/> </p><p>Ginny bumped into her not realizing that Hermione had stopped. "Hermione? Why did you stop for?" When Hermione didn't respond, Ginny gently pushed her toward the wall to see what was going on.<br/> </p><p>"RON!"</p>
