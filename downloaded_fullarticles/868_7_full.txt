    <p>Hermione smiled as the door closed behind Harry, his parting reminder of next week's Sunday brunch at The Burrow forcing her to nod, if only to keep from blurting out that she couldn't possibly go now that she was sleeping with Arthur.  She knew it didn't make any sense to think that way, but she did.</p><p>Strong arms wrapped around her, Arthur's chest a convenient place to let her head rest.  </p><p>"Knut for your thoughts," he said, feeling her relax against him, pleased with how the breakfast had turned out, given the unexpected revelations.</p><p>Hermione shook her head, sighing.  "If I say anything, it will come out wrong," she replied, "and..."  She couldn't even bring herself to say it.  She did not want to ruin a stressful morning that had ended up better than she had expected, but she did not want to keep silent either.  As she thought about it, she realized how ironic it was: she did not want to keep silent about her desire <i>not</i> to tell everyone else.  Arthur leaned down, and it was his voice in her ear that made her reconsider.</p><p>"Are you ashamed, Hermione?  Of what's happened between us?  Or is it that your friends -- my children -- have found out?"  That his soft voice could so gently gut her was also ironic: he would never hurt her, and yet his kindness hurt most of all.</p><p>"Not ashamed," she finally said.  "Just...being selfish, I think.  Everything is so new, and now that they know, it's not just between us.  It's not just us, but them, too."  Harry and Ron knowing was fine -- she knew more about their lives than their wives, probably, and she always had.  Probably always would.  No, it was Ginny and Lavender, two veteran gossips, and she could just picture the shock on the Weasley siblings' and wives' faces when the latest about Hermione was told.  </p><p>
  <i>"Oh, Bill, I saw Hermione today.  Guess what?  Dad is shacking up with her.  Pass the potatoes, please," Ginny would say in her usual way.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Yeah," Lavender would add, "and she looked like a well-laid witch.  Guess Arthur is pretty gifted.  Then again, why else would there be seven of you if he were rubbish in the sack?"  Veteran gossips always speculate, even when they shouldn't, of course.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Bill, Charlie, and George would be suitably shocked and promptly invade, while the witches they had married would begin planning the wedding immediately, because It Was High Time Hermione Got Married.</i>
</p><p>No, that was untrue and unfounded.  None of them would say or do such things, but it felt like it could happen.  She changed the subject. </p><p>"Lavender looks ready to pop," she said, changing to the safe topic of Weasley children.  No matter what year it was, there was pretty much guaranteed to be a pregnant Weasley witch and at least one sprog running about.</p><p>Arthur stiffened briefly, stepped from behind her, and drew her over to the couch.  Hermione settled beside him, picking up the sudden change in demeanor.  Whatever was going through his head, well, it wasn't going to be a pleasant conversation.</p><p>"Hermione, there is no easy way to ask this, but do you want children?"</p><p>Hermione blinked.  "What?"</p><p>"Do you want to have children, to be a mother?" he asked, restating the question with slightly different phrasing.  </p><p>Hermione was still confused, and she didn't answer right away.  "Why?"  When she saw how he clenched his jaw, she clarified.  "Why do you ask?"</p><p>He closed his eyes and took a breath, obviously holding on to his patience.  "I have seven children, Hermione, now all grown and most, if not yet all, with children of their own.  I am not interested in starting a second family, not at my age, and certainly not now."  He would never stop counting Fred and Percy, even if they were gone.  He was their father when they were alive, he was still their father now that they were dead, and that was the end of it.</p><p>"Oh!  That makes sense then."</p><p>"And I have forgotten the Contraceptive Charm at least twice since that first night."  He grimaced.  “Including that night.”  There was a reason he had seven children, after all.  Every time one of his children married, he told him – at his daughter's wedding, he had told Harry, not Ginny -- that no matter how hot they were, there was always time to cast the Contraceptive Charm, yet here he was, confessing to forgetting his own advice at least thrice.  It was a miracle she hadn't told him they were having triplets.</p><p>"You...didn't know, then?  No, of course not," Hermione answered her own question.  "If you had known, you wouldn't have asked.  I can't have children, Arthur, so the Charm is useless."  She took a breath, knowing he would ask, so she answered before he could.  "Fifth year, at the Ministry, I was hit with a kind of slicing hex from Dolohov.  The short version is that I have a chance of getting pregnant so low that it is essentially zero, and, even if I managed to get pregnant, I would never carry to term, or even past the second month."</p><p>"The scar on your abdomen," he said, looking at her eyes carefully as his shoulders visibly relaxed and the lines around his mouth and eyes eased.  At her nod, he flashed a brief smile.  "I love my family, Hermione, but I honestly never intended to have seven children.  I don't regret having them, but stopping after two or three had been the plan Molly and I had."</p><p>"I take it that didn't quite work out," Hermione said facetiously.</p><p>Arthur snorted.  "Let's just say I learned <i>why</i> there is always time to cast the Contraceptive Charm, even when there isn't.  And stop laughing," he added, grinning himself.</p><p>Hermione couldn't help it.  She laughed at the image that popped to mind, one of a younger Arthur staring at his wand and saying, "I know you're only a stick with a magical core, but help a wizard out here!" as he got the news from Molly for the fifth time.</p><p>"I'll stop that mouth," he said, pulling her into his lap and kissing her soundly.</p><p>A few moments later, Hermione was ready to settle in for a good snog, but Arthur pulled back.</p><p>"You are a wicked witch," he murmured, brushing her unruly curls back from her face.</p><p>"Now that is an accusation I am prepared to refute," she returned, wondering if she should be insulted or happy.  She decided on happy.  She was, after all, happy with him.  </p><p>"Mm," he replied, dropping a kiss to her shoulder and changing the subject back to his original topic.  "I know you cannot have children, but do you want them?"</p><p>Hermione looked up at him, her answer on her lips, then paused when she saw how serious he was.  She answered in kind, her voice softly factual.</p><p>"I'll never feel life growing inside me, never be called 'Mum,' never know what it's like to hold my child.  I'll never, ever be a mother, Arthur, and whether I want to be or not is irrelevant."</p><p>Arthur started to reply, thought the better of it, and simply sat there with her safe in the circle of his arms.  After a few minutes, he spoke again.  </p><p>"Why did you say you were being selfish?  Having others know changes nothing."</p><p>Hermione started to answer, then shook her head.  "I guess not."  She kissed his jaw and he turned her to straddle his legs.  She was small enough and he tall enough that the way her legs folded under her raised her sufficiently to look in his eyes.  He had beautiful eyes.</p><p>"I had plans for us this morning, witch, but you scarpered."  He nuzzled her neck and she sighed happily, tilting her head to the side.  Breakfast had turned in to extended coffee and conversation, so it was nearly noon.</p><p>"And what plans would those have been, Arthur?  Did you want to go out?"</p><p>He chuckled softly against her skin and began to unbutton the blouse she had changed into between serving plates and coffee and eating breakfast.  He had the notion that, had it only been herself, Ron, and Harry, she wouldn't have bothered, but the wives were there, so she took more care to be proper.  But that was not pertinent to his task at hand.</p><p>"I had intended," he said, nipping her ear and kissing across her jaw, "to stay in."  A subtle emphasis on the last word made her shiver, then her eyes widened.  Did he just make a very naughty, very suggestive pun?  It was a delicious thought, but at the same time...</p><p>"You want to...<i>now</i>, Arthur?" she asked, unaccountably nervous.  She shied back when she asked, and Arthur frowned slightly.</p><p>"What is it, Hermione?"</p><p>"I...There are...We just haven't..." Her tongue was tripping over itself.  If tongues could trip, and it felt like hers could because it was getting help from both of her feet, which she was certain she had managed to stuff in her mouth the last few seconds.</p><p>Arthur smiled and kissed her again.  "Our schedules have run us ragged lately.  We've a long weekend, and no meetings for the next three days.  Unless you're not interested?" he asked, leaning back to see her eyes.  She had the most expressive eyes, especially when she was with only with one person.  In a group or meeting, she wore a mask almost perfectly.</p><p>"It's not that," she insisted, biting her lip.  "I'm not...pretty anymore."  At his raised eyebrows, she explained.  "The scar from Dolohov is the biggest, but there are dozens of others..."  Her voice trailed off as her eyes grew dark with something he couldn't name.  </p><p>"Perfect skin isn't what makes a witch beautiful, love," he murmured, pulling her close.  He moved back and kissed her again, opening her blouse, this time without her objections.  He saw the first scar high on her neck, a gift from Bellatrix and one he had seen and kissed many times.  He kissed it now.  Another, on her shoulder, a hex scar from before the Battle of Hogwarts.  He kissed it too.  As he found and kissed each scar on her shoulders and above her breasts, he whispered, "Even scars can be beautiful, when they're honourable."</p><p>He kept kissing her scars.  When he reached the hateful scar carved into her forearm, she tried to tug her arm from his grip, but he shook his head and kissed every letter, even the long trailing cut from where the "d" had been dragged under the word to add more emphasis to the spite of Bellatrix's actions.  She held perfectly still; he moved on to another scar, this time on her bicep.  After a few more minutes of this gentle worship, she worked the buttons on his shirt open, tugged off his undershirt, and began to do the same to him.  </p><p>She didn't notice that tears were falling from their eyes by the time she sank onto him in the light of day, making this the first time they weren't in the safety of their bed under the cover of night.  Their soft sighs and moans and whispers didn't register in her conscious mind as they kissed and caressed one another.  All she knew was that, when she felt him sliding deep, his magic held her as tightly as his arms, and her magic sparkled and danced around them.</p><p>Nothing else mattered.  Not even the pleasure that left them gasping and trembling in its wake.</p><p>***</p><p>Sunday saw them ready to Apparate from the magically screened balcony of their apartment to The Burrow, both dressed properly with a change of clothes in Hermione's new handbag.  Like her old beaded bag that had been relegated to her closet, this bag had been the recipient of several useful charms, among them an Undetectable Extension Charm.  </p><p>"Are you ready to face the thundering herd?" he asked, lips twitching at Hermione's insistence on being nervous.</p><p>"No," she replied.  "We could stay here...in bed?" It was an offer that, any other day, he would most likely have accepted.  She was pants at bribery, but she thought it was a worthwhile try.</p><p>Arthur chuckled, pulled her into his arms and spun on his heel, not letting her stall any longer than three changes of clothes, two too-lengthy discussions (her with herself, thankfully) of which shoes would be best, and an otherwise inexplicable inability to choose a change of clothes for the inevitable afternoon sports and child-created messes.  Her startled yelp was enough to make him laugh heartily when they arrived in the wide front lawn near the vegetable patch.  Hermione growled at him -- actually growled! -- and punched his arm.  Unfortunately, that only made him chuckle longer, if more quietly, than he would have laughed.</p><p>Hermione was irritated at his unbridled optimism that everything would be fine.  She was more irritated at his amusement when she couldn't make up her mind this morning, and this was just the last straw.  She started to stalk off, but was stopped by his hand taking hers.</p><p>"Forgive me, love," he murmured, taking the steam from her.  "I know Harry and Ron already told them, and, if there were any objections, I would have seen them immediately on Tuesday morning in my office."  He walked beside her, pulling her hand up to the crook of his arm and folding his other hand over hers.  "There's no reason to be nervous."</p><p>"How do you know?" she demanded, still not quite ready to look over at him.  As much as she didn't want to admit it, he was probably right.  Ron and Ginny would come to see her immediately if they had objections to anything she was involved in, but the older brothers would go to beard the lion in his den.  </p><p>"Because I know my sons," he said softly.  "I know that George and Charlie most likely nodded and said something to the effect of 'good on them,' and that Bill is the one who would be in a temper, if any of them were.  George would be happy because he hates for anyone to be alone anymore, and Charlie is still in the wine-and-roses part of his marriage to Sophie.  I know that Ginny probably hugged Harry within an inch of his life, and I really don't want to think of how else she would have shown her happiness that we found one another."  Hermione grimaced her agreement.  She knew a bit too much about Ginny's affectionate ways of showing her appreciation of events to her husband, both from Ginny and from said husband.  "And I know Ron probably took a long walks on the beach at Shell Cottage, with and without Lavender.  My boys've come to me several times over the years with their problems, big and small, and they have never hesitated."</p><p>"They don't tell you everything," she objected.  She, like everyone else close to the family, understood that whenever Arthur referred to his boys in such an instance, he was speaking of all of his children, not just those who happened to possess the physical characteristics of the male half of the species.  Ginny knew, and didn't mind at all.  In fact, she often teased Charlie and Bill that their littlest brother was going to hex them into next week “if.”  </p><p>He stopped walking several feet before they reached the porch and turned her to face him.  </p><p>"Ron did.  He told me about the Horcruxes, that you three were leaving Hogwarts to go hunting them, and that the last time we might see any of you alive was at Bill's wedding."  Hermione stared at him, stricken.  "He also said he had his will written out and behind the Cannons poster in his room, along with Harry's behind his Sixth Year Gryffindor  Quidditch team picture, and yours in a copy of Muggle adventure stories you'd given him two years before.  I never said anything about it to Molly or the boys, but, when he told me where to find the documents, he asked for a Blessing."  He didn't wait for her question, but explained.  "An old tradition when a child, usually a son, is leaving to go against what has been expected of him, such as finishing school and staying out of a war.  I gave him my Blessing, and he carried Blessings to you and Harry as well, since you weren't supposed to know that I knew what you were planning."</p><p>"I never would have guessed..."  Hermione was caught between stunned and helplessly grateful.  For all he could seem the bumbling idiot, Ron was sharp when it counted.</p><p>"You weren't supposed to.  The first time he touched you and Harry at the same time, the Blessings transferred."  He smiled softly.  "I like to think that in some way, I helped to keep you safe while you were so far from all of us."</p><p>Hermione didn't stop to think where she was or who might see.  She lifted onto her toes and kissed him soundly, her arms wrapping tight around him.  He returned both the embrace and the kiss, separating only when a cheerful voice called from behind them, "Oi!  That's enough of that!  Y'might blind the witchlings!"</p><p>"Oh, George," Hermione huffed at the interruption, sounding for all the world like Molly in that moment.</p><p>The man's smile grew a little wider, and the woman at his side, Angelina Johnson-not-yet-Weasley, wife in all but her last name to George, laughed as the little girl she held slept on.  </p><p>"We're running late," Angelina said before the usual verbal fireworks between Hermione and George could erupt.  "And you <i>know</i> how Fleur gets."</p><p>Everyone nodded and continued walking around the house and to the back where several trestle tables waited, making two long stripes against the browning early-autumn grass.  </p><p>"Almost too cool to do this outside," Charlie said, coming over to hug his father and Hermione.  "But at least Sophie is happy," he nodded to his tiny wife of nearly a year, who, like Lavender, was ready to pop at any moment.  A flash of worry crossed his face, then was gone again.</p><p>"Are the children bundled up enough?  Playtime will warm them up, but sitting for the meal they might get too chilled."  There was something in Arthur's voice and the way he let go of her hand that told her he needed to speak to Charlie alone.</p><p>"I'll go help Fleur," Hermione said, smiling up at the dragonkeeper.  She left father and son to talk, wondering now how the rest of the family would take it.  </p><p>Logic and knowledge of the family helped her figure out most of the reactions.  Sophie was new to the family, having married Charlie barely a year ago, so she'd not been there to see any of them as children or teens.  George had always had a kind of soft spot for her -- at least that's what he'd claimed when she had asked why he and Fred had never picked on her as much as they had the others.  She knew Ron, Harry, and Ginny, Lavender were fine with everything; Angelina would corner her privately if there were any real concerns, but she would have done it much sooner; and Fleur was that odd Parisienne mixture of practical and romantic, so she didn't expect any difficulties there.  It was Bill that worried her -- and who she nearly ran into at the kitchen door.</p><p>"Oh!  Sorry about that!" she exclaimed, stepping quickly out of his way.  He had a line of full serving plates floating behind him and she knew from experience that particular levitation spell did not like to be kept still.</p><p>"No problem," he replied, grinning at her over his shoulder.  "Back in a jiff.  Fleur's working on the pudding course."</p><p>"Right," she murmured as the eldest Weasley child moved quickly down to the tables, at least half of the dishes Fleur and the other Weasley wives had prepared floating docilely behind him.</p><p>Inside, Fleur had Ginny icing gingerbread biscuits, Lavender casting warming charms over the second half of the Sunday dinner, and Angelina stirring together peach juice and a light, sweet tea that was to be served cold, along with the ubiquitous pumpkin juice and Butterbeer, hot tea and coffee.</p><p>"Oh, good.  Eet iz someone who knowz 'ow to fineesh zee icing on zee cake," Fleur said, holding up an icing knife and pointing to a monstrous three-layer cake that was only half frosted.  "I need to get zee rest of zee meal out to zee tablez, and Laven-dear iz aching in 'er feet."</p><p>"I'll be fine, Fleur," the witch in question objected.</p><p>"Oui, but you will not be fine eef you do not go out and zit down, n'est-ce pas?"</p><p>"You're as impossible as Ron sometimes!"</p><p>"But at least she has a nifty Parisienne accent!" Hermione chimed in, stopping the grouchy Lavender from taking any more of her aches, pains, and near-full-moon temper out on her sister-by-marriage.  </p><p>Lavender gave Hermione a disgusted look and started to leave.  </p><p>"Here," Ginny said, handing her a spoon heaping with chocolate icing.  "You know it helps."</p><p>"It's also why I'm as big as a fucking whale," Lavender snarled back, pushing the spoon away.</p><p>"And you'll lose it all in six weeks after the sprog is born."  Two small, red-headed children ran through the kitchen to the back door.  Ginny hissed more softly, "So stop being a world-class wolf bitch and eat the fucking chocolate."</p><p>"World class?" Lavender asked, lips twitching.</p><p>"At least," Hermione agreed.</p><p>"Definitely.  You could, ah, <i>complain</i> for England," Sophie teased.</p><p>"Fine.  But I'm never going to forgive any of you for the weight this adds," the wolf-bitch in question replied with a giggle.</p><p>"Oh, but you'll forgive Ron.  Now that's just wrong," Hermione complained.</p><p>"Yeah, but remember," Sophie checked for little ears before continuing; none were present.  "Ron gives her orgasms."</p><p>"And that's why I forgive him," Lavender said, smugly.</p><p>"Please do not ever mention Ron and orgasms in the same sentence ever again," Hermione said, making a face.  She may have kissed him, even twice, but the thought of sex with Ron -- of Ron having sex with anyone, despite the evidence that he actually <i>had</i> -- well, it was enough to put her off her food.  "And do not <i>even</i> start, Ginevra Potter!  The same goes for Harry."</p><p>"But talking about George, Charlie, and Bill is all right?" Angelina asked, trying not to laugh.</p><p>"Yes," Hermione said, smiling as she frosted.</p><p>"You only bloody lived with Harry and Ron for a year, all alone -- are you still insisting that nothing happened?" Ginny demanded.</p><p>"For the last bloody time, I have never had sex with Harry or Ron, salacious rumours and lies printed by a certain Rita-Fucking-Skeeter notwithstanding!" Hermione snapped.  Of the many ways that her good mood could be ruined, rehashing that particular point with anyone was in the top ten, maybe even the top five.</p><p>"For which we -- and by 'we' I mean Ron and myself -- are very grateful," Harry said, walking into the kitchen and kissing Hermione on the cheek.  "It'd be like getting it on with our sister, so <i>no</i>, Gin, and please drop it.  Permanently."  There was enough of an edge to his voice that Hermione gave him a concerned look.  "Later," he mouthed.</p><p>Ginny opened her mouth to reply, then closed it, her lips thinning.  Harry went on through the kitchen, not stopping for more than a perfunctory kiss on his wife's cheek and saying no more.  Another look at Ginny saw the hurt and anger in her brown eyes, but more than that was confusion.</p><p><i>Lovely,</i> Hermione thought.  <i>They're fighting.  Again.  What could possibly be wrong this time?  They agreed that three in five years was more than enough in the way of children and that Gin needed the break physically as much as mentally.  Harry's career is going well -- Arthur mentioned he was up for a promotion soon.  It can't be the children, since they're ridiculously healthy and already showing all the signs of being fully magical.</i>  </p><p>"Cake's done," she said, drawing attention back to their tasks and away from the man who consistently confused family and friends with his odd reactions and moods.  The only people who understood, who didn't take it amiss when he snapped and snarled when he received what others would call good news or grinned when the worst information was passed on, were herself and Ron, and neither of them would be able to settle in and talk until after sunset when most of the children were tucked into their cribs and pallets, if then.  She resolved to meet Harry at lunch tomorrow, if he didn't catch a case and she wasn't neck-deep in a new, urgent project.</p><p>"So are the biscuits," Ginny said, tossing the frosting knife she was using in the sink, not bothering to lick it, one of Hermione’s favourite parts about cooking desserts.  Hermione didn't groan.  She would have to talk to Ginny, too, and she was the only one who could when it came to Harry and his moods.  None of the other wives really understood.  </p><p>Bill's condition was like Lavender's, so while Ron's wife and Fleur understood volatile natures, they were used to an instinctual sort of volatility, not the learned kind that the so-called Golden Trio had.  Sophie hadn't been in England during the war, but had learned to deal with the slow-burning, dangerous temper and seemingly suicidal career of her patient dragonkeeper; and Angelina had her hands full with George, who seemed to consider himself the left-over twin.  All of the men had problems and difficulties with ordinary things, but none of them, not even Hermione –a witch who had pitched her own impressive fits over the years -- quite matched Harry's unpredictable temperament.</p><p>As Hermione carried the cake out to the tables, she thought about Arthur.  From what she could tell, and it wasn't much, he hadn't changed over the years she had known him.  He was as kind and gentle as always, with a deceptively strong will hidden under that gentle, sometimes goofy demeanor.  He was a man of substance, not show.  More, he took her as she was, with all of her quirks and oddities, including her scars and nightmares and obsessive need to <i>find out</i> if she didn't <i>know</i>.  </p><p>She set the cake on the table and turned to find her seat next to Arthur, who was no longer at the head of the table here at The Burrow.  </p><p>"Everything alright, love?" he murmured to her as she sat.</p><p>"If it's not, it will wait until tomorrow," she replied.  "Harry's in one of his moods again."</p><p>"Ah."  </p><p>"If I can't catch him alone or with Ron tonight, I'll see him at lunch tomorrow," she continued, spooning a helping of potatoes onto her plate.  "Besides, he's doing well enough for the moment, and so's Gin."</p><p>Arthur looked down the table at his daughter and son-in-law and noticed the signs of stress between them, how they avoided too much interaction.  He knew those signs well enough from the early years of his own marriage.  Loving Molly didn't mean they never fought, never had to cast silencing spells over the kitchen while the kids slept because they were so loud, never meant that a few times they had made the ghoul in the attic would cower in his dusty corner.  Some of the fights they'd had were epic in scope, volume, length, and broken crockery.  By the time the oldest were able to remember, though, they had learned to settle their battles without histrionics.</p><p>"I can try to see what's bothering Gin," he said, having long ago adopted the affectionate, if alcoholic, nickname for his only girl.  </p><p>"See what Harry has to say first," she replied, wondering, not for the first time, how this man had lived with the dragoness named Molly.  She knew he could be stubborn, but he was usually so sweet about it that she didn't mind or even notice.</p><p>"Mm," was all he said in reply before turning to engage Bill in a quiet conversation about his work at Gringotts.</p><p>Hermione let the usual bustle and sound wash over her as she ate.</p><p>The strangest thing about this Sunday feast was that -- despite the problems and potential for problems despite her new relationship with Arthur; despite the sheer number of small children merrily creating chaos and messes with their lunches -- this place, this time, felt like home.</p><p>Hermione looked around, turned in time to catch Arthur's eyes, and smiled.  </p><p>After nearly twelve years adrift in the magical world, twelve years since she received her Hogwarts letter and started losing the Muggle life she had known, she had come home.</p>
