    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Louis wakes up with a crick in her neck and her cheek stuck to a page in the book she'd fallen asleep reading the night before. The sun is shining in through the gap between her window curtains, leaving a strip of light directly across her face. She blinks several times, grimacing with a groan as she pulls her face away from the page and frowns down at <em>Advanced Potion Making</em>. Her face is tacky where it was pressed against the paper and Louis wipes her cheek with the sleeve of her sweater, groaning again as she smacks her lips and yawns.</p><p>She carefully gathers up the pieces of parchment strewn across her bed and folds them all in half, sticking them in the middle of <em>A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration</em> which was underneath her old Potions textbook. Tucking both of them in the crook of her arm, she climbs off her bed and sets them on her desk before she sits down and rolls out a new piece of parchment.</p><p>
  <em>Professor McGonagall,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I know you've asked me to stop calling you Professor, but old habits die hard. Thank you for your last letter, I really do appreciate you taking the time to write me back.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your list of applicable texts is more helpful than I could've hoped for. There's only so much research I can do in a small town like Rosemoor before people start asking questions. Would it be alright to write you again once I've obtained the books, in case I need further help?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I do wish I'd been able to accept your offer while I was still at Hogwarts, but you know how mums can be.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Thank you again. I really, really appreciate it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Louis Tomlinson</em>
</p><p>Louis rolls up the parchment as she gets up from her desk, tucking it into the top drawer for safe keeping. She makes a mental note to go to the Owl Post Office in town later today to send off her letter to Professor McGonagall, and just as she closers the drawer in her desk, she realizes something.</p><p>She strains her ears for a moment, listening for signs of life in the house. It's oddly quiet. She twists around to check the time on the clock sitting on her nightstand and mutters a curse under her breath. It's almost nine in the morning, which means the lack of noise in the house probably equals trouble.</p><p>Louis rushes downstairs without even bothering to change her clothes, finding the living room completely empty. She races through the dining room and into the kitchen, where she finds her sister Lottie sitting at the kitchen table with three purple candles lit around her Divination textbook and her eyes closed.</p><p>"What did Mum say about lighting candles in the house while she's out?" she asks in her best, most authoritative big sister tone.</p><p>Lottie cracks one eye open to look at Louis, a snicker slipping out as she closes it again.</p><p>"Mum said it was fine."</p><p>"Lottie."</p><p>"Fall asleep on a book again?" Lottie asks, changing the subject as she continues to keep her eyes closed. Louis presses her hand to her cheek and Lottie snickers again.</p><p>"At least I've got N.E.W.T.s in <em>practical</em> subjects," Louis retorts, glaring at her sister even though Lottie can't even see it.</p><p>"And what are you doing with those N.E.W.T.s?" Lottie replies, remaining calm and collected.</p><p>Louis glares harder, and then bends down and blows out all three of Lottie's candles at once for revenge.</p><p>"Hey!" Lottie cries.</p><p>"What?" Louis asks, smirking. "Didn't see that coming?"</p><p>Lottie groans angrily as she gathers up her book and candles, hissing a little as the hot wax drips onto her fingers. She mutters under her breath as Louis crosses the kitchen floor to grab an apple, feeling rather proud of herself for keeping her sister in line.</p><p>"That fire wasn't even my fault!" Lottie snaps as she leaves the kitchen, stomping loudly up the stairs.</p><p>Louis takes a large bite out of her apple and rolls her eyes, tapping her finger against her chin as she wonders where the rest of her sisters have gotten to. She turns around and goes up on tiptoe to look out the window behind the kitchen sink, just barely able to see out into the garden through the twisting vines that cover much of the house.</p><p>She spots her mum at the far end of the garden and rocks back on her heels. She glances back at the door through which Lottie exited minutes earlier and spares a thought to wonder whether she'd actually gotten permission from their mum. Louis winces a little but shrugs it off quickly enough, taking another large bite from her apple as she walks to the back door and heads outside.</p><p>The stones of the garden walkway are cool under her bare feet, still a bit wet with morning dew. She shivers as she hops from one to the other in an effort to get to the ones in the sun as quickly as possible. She's about halfway to her mum when another head pops up in the middle of the lettuce patch and Louis nearly falls on her face as she stumbles out of fright.</p><p>"Don't do that!" Louis scolds as Fizzy nearly topples over in her fit of laughter.</p><p>"Jumpy, are we?" Fizzy wipes at her eyes. "What're you doing out here, anyway?"</p><p>"Looking for Mum," Louis replies. "Lottie was burning candles again."</p><p>"Mum said she could," Fizzy says as she gets to her feet, brushing the dirt off of her knees.</p><p>"Did she?" Louis winces again. "Shit."</p><p>"Ooh, what'd you do now?" Fizzy grins. "Is Lottie going to hex you?"</p><p>"No, Lottie is not going to <em>hex</em> me," Louis says with a huff. "She wouldn't dare risk getting expelled from Hogwarts. Plus, Mum would be furious, you know that."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah." Fizzy rolls her eyes and drops back down to her knees, turning her attention back to the lettuce patch and losing all interest in Louis.</p><p>Louis pulls a face at her sister's back and then continues down the path until she reaches her mum at the back of the garden, picking herbs. She looks up at Louis with a smile as she approaches, and Louis smiles back.</p><p>"Morning, Lou."</p><p>"Morning," she replies as she passes by her mum and makes herself comfortable underneath a nearby tree. She leans back against the trunk and eats her apple, watching her mum harvest herbs with the utmost care.</p><p>"The rosemary is blooming nicely," Jay says, looking at Louis over her shoulder as she takes off her gloves.</p><p>"That's good," Louis says, her mouth full. She swallows quickly when her mum gives her an unimpressed look and she puts on a bright smile. "Where are the twins?"</p><p>"Down by the shore, hopefully getting what I asked them to," Jay replies as she gets to her feet, picking up her basket as she does so. "If they're going to spend all day there anyway, they may as well be useful while they're down there."</p><p>"Fat chance," Louis says as she gets to her feet and starts following her mum back towards the house. Fizzy pulls a face at Louis, but only after their mum's already passed by. Louis throws her apple core at her.</p><p>"Oh, will you go into town, later?" Jay asks, turning around before she reaches for the handle to the back door. "Bernard called, our order's in."</p><p>"Yeah," Louis says, quickly turning away from Fizzy and jogging to catch up. The letter tucked away in her desk upstairs springs to mind. At least now she won't have to make up some other reason to leave the house. "When d'you want me to go?"</p><p>"Maybe after you've changed," Jay says as she looks Louis up and down and gives her a smile. "Did you fall asleep reading again?"</p><p>Louis flushes. "Maybe."</p><p>Jay hums as she steps through the door and back into the kitchen, glancing around for a moment as Louis follows her inside.</p><p>"I thought Lottie would be in here with her candles."</p><p>Louis winces for the third time that morning. "I… might have done something."</p><p>Jay sighs. "Oh, Louis."</p><p>*</p><p>By the time Louis gets out of the house a few hours later, with her letter tucked away safely in her pocket, she's definitely glad to be doing so. She apologized to Lottie for blowing out her candles, but she could tell that Lottie wasn't really ready to forgive her just yet.</p><p>It figured that when Louis actually tried to step up and be a good role model and follow the rules it would blow up in her face. In retrospect, perhaps she should've been a bit nicer to Lottie. It'd been over a month since the incident with the fire in the dining room, and they still hadn't actually figured out what had happened or who'd done it. Lottie swore up and down that she had nothing to do with it, but Louis still wasn't sure if she believed her.</p><p>Perhaps a bit of time away from her sister was a good idea.</p><p>It was a bit of a trek, getting from their house to town, but Louis didn't mind. She preferred walking to Apparating, given that she'd never really gotten over the sick feeling that sometimes accompanies Apparition. Even though her sisters thought she was mad and were always going on about how they were going to Apparate <em>everywhere</em> once they were able to, Louis didn't care. Some things, she thought, were better without magic. </p><p>For instance, she liked the seclusion that their house afforded them, even if it wasn't particularly necessary in a town full of fellow wizarding families. If they lived in a Muggle town, their house would need a hundred different charms and spells to keep their wizardry private. But here they could just <em>be</em>.</p><p>Louis had spent her whole life in this town and it was small enough that she knew just about everyone, and they all knew her. When it came time for her to go to Hogwarts, she wasn't nearly as nervous about it because she already knew multiple other children around her age and older that would be going there as well. If anything, it helped her make her home at Hogwarts just as easily as her mother had made their home in the town.</p><p>Louis' mum was known throughout the town as a healer, and considering the closest wizarding hospital was St. Mungo's all the way in London, it was far easier to just trek up the hill to the Tomlinson house for cures for minor illnesses. It set a rather high standard for Louis and her younger sisters, having a mum who was so talented. Louis remembers all too well how, when she'd gotten her letter from Hogwarts, some townsfolk started to ask her if she was going to follow in her mum's footsteps and become a healer herself. It was a lot of pressure to put on an eleven-year-old.</p><p>While Jay's strengths lay in the magic of healing, Louis had a predilection for Transfiguration. She'd done alright in Potions, she'd even been accepted into the N.E.W.T. level class by some miracle, but she'd never had the intent of using it to become a Healer.</p><p>When she was at Hogwarts, Louis became close with Professor McGonagall despite not being in the Gryffindor house. After showing a natural talent for Transfiguration in her first year, Professor McGonagall had sort of taken Louis under her wing (or paw, so to speak), and helped her discover how gifted she really was.</p><p>But, apart from taking over Professor McGonagall's post at Hogwarts, Louis hadn't known what her talents could translate into as far as a wizarding career. So, three years later, she still has no idea what she's doing.</p><p>Unlike Louis, both Lottie's and Fizzy's talents derive from what one might call the more traditional side of witchcraft: divination and herbology, respectively. Lottie can neither read minds nor correctly predict the future, but it certainly doesn't stop her from trying. And as far as Fizzy is concerned, she'd probably sleep in the garden if their mum would let her.</p><p>As for the twins, Daisy and Phoebe, their talents have yet to reveal themselves. But, according to Jay, they're growing ever closer to the age at which most young witches learn where their talents truly lie. Louis just hopes it's nothing too destructive or intrusive, to be quite honest. The twins are rambunctious enough as it is without bringing magic into the mix.</p><p>She smiles widely at the several townsfolk she passes on her way to the center of town. They all smile in return, and a few even greet her by name. The first stop on her agenda is the Owl Post Office so she can send off her letter to Professor McGonagall and it stops burning a hole in her pocket.</p><p>Lucky for her, the wizard who runs the Owl Post Office isn't necessary to complete a transaction. He's mostly there to clean up after the owls, which is a rather disgusting job in Louis' opinion. But then again, without him, the whole place would be absolutely covered in owl dung and smell even worse than it already does.</p><p>She picks a tawny barn owl and deposits a few Knuts into the small bag at its feet before she ties her letter to its leg. The owl hoots once before it takes off, flying out of the opening in the roof. Louis leaves the shop as quick as she can, taking a deep breath of fresh air the moment she's through the doors.</p><p>Her next and last stop is to the market a few doors down, and she's looking far more forward to this than she was the Owl Post Office.</p><p>Louis strides into the shop and immediately heads for the counter at the back, happy to see that there's no one else waiting in line so she can waltz right up. She takes her wand out of her pocket and points it at the bell hanging above the counter, charming it to ring over and over even though it's entirely unnecessary. Judging by the look on Harry's face as he turns around, he knew it was her before the bell even stopped.</p><p>"Harold!" she says with a wide, toothy grin. "How's my favorite shop boy?"</p><p>"Tired," he replies with a soft sigh. "And you banging on that bell doesn't help."</p><p>"But you know I love to ring the bell," she says. He rolls his eyes as she juts out her bottom lip in an exaggerated pout, twirling her wand between her fingers. "It's one of my simple pleasures in life."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah." Even when Harry tries to sound exasperated with her, he can't manage it well enough to be convincing. Louis knows she's just too charming for anyone to stay mad at her for too long (her sisters notwithstanding, of course).</p><p>It also helps that they've been friends since they were tiny, and even back then Harry couldn't stay mad at her for very long. Even being sorted into separate houses at Hogwarts wasn't going to ruin their friendship. (Although it nearly came to blows when Harry tried to talk Louis into taking Muggle Studies with him. That was a terrible idea that resulted in a fight where they didn't speak for three whole days.)</p><p>"Louis!"</p><p>Louis turns at the sound of her name to see the shop owner, Bernard, coming towards her with a warm smile nearly hidden under his moustache. She smiles in return, leaning back and resting her elbows on the counter behind her.</p><p>"Come for your order?"</p><p>"Yes!" she answers. "<em>Someone</em> wasn't being very helpful." She nods her head towards Harry in an exaggerated manner, but the smile doesn't fade from Bernard's face so she knows he isn't taking her seriously.</p><p>"I'll be sure to reprimand him," Bernard says, playing into her joke as he walks past her and opens the door to the right of the counter. "Dock his pay, at the very least."</p><p>"Ought to give him twenty lashes too, so he really learns his lesson." Louis turns back around and flutters her eyelashes at Harry, who's glaring at her as he tries not to smile.</p><p>"Will you ever stop trying to get me sacked?" he asks with a huff.</p><p>"Probably," she replies. "Y'know, when it actually works."</p><p>"Then what'll you do? You'll have no one to flirt with but Bernard."</p><p>"Excuse me, Harold. I am not <em>flirting</em> with you."</p><p>"Sure, you're not." Harry winks in the most ridiculous manner and Louis can't help but laugh.</p><p>"You're an idiot," she declares just as Bernard comes up next to Harry with a bag in his hand.</p><p>"Here we are," he says as he sets it down on the counter. "Shall I go through it?"</p><p>"Nah," Louis says as she reaches out for it. "I trust you. Besides, if anything's missing, I know where you live." She winks in an exaggerated manner as both Bernard and Harry laugh.</p><p>"Tell your mum I said hello, will you?" Bernard asks. Louis nods.</p><p>"I will. S'pose I'd better get going, before Mum sends one of the others to look for me." Louis rolls her eyes.</p><p>"Run along, Louis." Harry waves his hand at her and Louis swipes at it. "Some of us have work to do."</p><p>"Shut up, Harold. Bye, Bernard!"</p><p>Louis tucks the bag under her arm as she strides to the front of the store and through the doors, getting halfway through the town centre before she catches the edge of a conversation that piques her interest.</p><p>"No, I'm telling you, it's the truth!"</p><p>"It can't be, why would <em>that kind</em> of witch come to our town?"</p><p>Louis had already slowed down to eavesdrop, but the tone of the woman's voice has her coming to a full stop. She carefully turns her head to the left to see a group of older women near the market, and not a single one of them have noticed that Louis is nearby. In an effort to not be conspicuous, Louis ducks behind a nearby tree and strains to listen to their conversation.</p><p>"I didn't say I knew <em>why</em>," one of the women is saying, "I'm just telling you what I've heard."</p><p>"Well, where'd you hear it from?" another woman demands. "Because I don't know if I trust your information, not after--"</p><p>"That was entirely different," the woman from before cuts in. "How was I to know that--"</p><p>"Now, please, don't start that again," a gentle voice interrupts and Louis peeks around the tree trunk to double-check that her ears aren't playing tricks on her. She thinks she knows that voice and as she spots its owner, she finds out she's right: it's Harry's mum, Anne. "Do you have any actual proof that she practices the Dark Arts?"</p><p>"Well, no," the first woman replies, sounding a little ashamed. "But I have it on good authority that--"</p><p>"I'm sure you do," Anne says smoothly, "but until we actually see it for ourselves, then we shouldn't speculate."</p><p>The other women all murmur in agreement and Louis turns away, leaning back against the tree trunk. <em>A witch who practices the Dark Arts?</em> Louis shakes her head, telling herself it can't possibly be true. If anyone knew about a newcomer to their small town, her mum would, and she would've at least told Louis about it.</p><p>Louis takes a deep breath before she sets off, walking at a quick pace with the intent on getting home as soon as possible. She's not sure if her mum will know everything about this supposed new person, but surely she's got to know <em>something</em>.</p><p>*</p><p>Louis is in such a rush to get inside the house by the time she makes it back from town that she struggles to get the latch of the gate open. She fights with it for a good thirty seconds before she pulls out her wand and points it directly at the latch.</p><p>"Alohomora, you absolute piece of shit!" she shouts, kicking the fence open once the latch comes undone. She points her wand over her shoulder and charms it closed, the spell using far more force than necessary to slam it closed behind her. Louis curses angrily under her breath as she sprints towards the front door, thankfully having far less trouble opening it than she'd had with the gate.</p><p>"Mum?" she calls. "Mum!"</p><p>"Kitchen!" Jay calls back. Louis changes course, having been headed for the stairs, and runs into the kitchen where her mum and all four of her sisters are gathered.</p><p>Lottie's got another candle burning while Fizzy's at the sink next to their mum, and the only evidence of the twins' presence is their legs sticking out from under the table. Louis ignores all of them as she drops the bag she's brought back from town onto the tabletop, the force of it sending a shockwave across the top and nearly knocking Lottie's candle over.</p><p>"Lou!" she shrieks as she scrambles to grab it before it falls, glaring at Louis' back when she gets no reply.</p><p>"What's got you all worked up?" Jay asks, glancing at Louis while she and Fizzy continue washing the vegetables Fizzy had gathered from their garden.</p><p>"There's a rumor in town," Louis says all in a rush, "about a witch," Louis drops her voice to a softer tone, even though there's no way her sisters won't be able to hear her, "who practices <em>dark magic</em>!"</p><p>"Oh?" Jay asks, her tone showing only mind interest. She doesn't even turn her head.</p><p>"Oh??" Louis huffs. "Mum, did you know??"</p><p>"Of course I knew," Jay answers with a soft laugh. "And don't be silly, she's--"</p><p>"Why didn't you tell me?" Louis interrupts.</p><p>"Who is she?" Fizzy asks.</p><p>"Where's she coming from?" Lottie adds.</p><p>"Mum," Louis says loudly, the whine evident in her voice.</p><p>"Now, stop that." Jay huffs. "I was going to tell all of you when it was your time to know." She stares Louis down as she adds, "it's nothing to be worried about."</p><p>"But <em>Mum</em>," Louis starts.</p><p>"But Mum nothing," Jay says, cutting her off. "I don't know why you're all up in arms about this, Louis, you don't even know her."</p><p>"Exactly!" Louis cries. "What if she's going to come into town and mess everything up?"</p><p>"Who's messing things up?" Daisy asks as she pokes her head out from under the tablecloth. Phoebe appears a moment later with the same curious look on her face, and Jay turns to the both of them with a smile.</p><p>"No one, loves." She turns back to Louis. "She doesn't practice dark magic, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Who's been filling your head with these lies?"</p><p>"Nobody." Louis crosses her arms and huffs. "Just… y'know, heard about it in town."</p><p>"Oh, come now." Jay reaches out and pulls Louis against her, and Louis slumps a little. "What did I tell you about making mountains out of molehills?"</p><p>"That I should do it as often as possible?" Louis says dryly, and Jay pinches her.</p><p>"Cheeky," Jay replies as Louis frowns and rubs at the spot where she was pinched. "That mouth of yours is going to get you in trouble someday, you'll see."</p><p>Louis scowls and re-crosses her arms as she leans back against the counter while her mum turns back to the washing. She taps her foot impatiently for a few seconds and turns her attention away from her mum and towards the kitchen table. Phoebe and Daisy have once again disappeared under the tablecloth to do who knows what, while Lottie sits with her legs folded under herself and her eyes closed.</p><p>It takes all of five seconds for Louis to cross the room and quickly blow the candle out, taking off for the stairs at a run as Lottie screeches her name. Louis manages to get up the stairs and down the hall into her room without Lottie catching up. She slams her bedroom door behind her and presses her ear to the wood to listen for Lottie's footsteps, but she doesn't hear a thing.</p><p>Relieved and smugly pleased with herself, Louis crosses the floor to her bed and lays down. She turns her head towards her desk, her eyes immediately drawn to her Potions and Transfiguration textbooks stacked there.</p><p>She wonders if the owl's reached Professor McGonagall yet. She stares at the pages of her Transfiguration textbook, particularly at the spot where the parchment stuck between them expands the binding. Inside is a list of all the books she needs to do what she's been dreaming of since her sixth year at Hogwarts, and just <em>knowing</em> it's within her reach burns wildly inside her chest.</p><p>Louis turns her head away from her desk and towards the window. She watches the clouds go by, the sky slowly changing from late afternoon sun to early dusk. Her thoughts wander to the gossip she'd overheard in town, and then to her mum's non-explanation. She can't help but feel frustrated by the fact that her mum really didn't tell her much of anything, but there's a small part of her that feels guilty over it.</p><p>She can't really be annoyed at her mum keeping secrets when Louis is doing the same thing. If her mum found out what she was trying to do, well… there's no telling what might happen.</p><p>Louis sits up, pulling her knees up to her chest. She feels ridiculous for having blown everything out of proportion downstairs all over a silly rumor. She'd heard hundreds of rumors at Hogwarts and never let a single one affect her like this.</p><p>Still. Nobody mentions dark magic anymore unless they have a reason to. It's been fifteen years since the Battle of Hogwarts, and the wizarding world hasn't had a single incident of dark magic since Voldemort was defeated. It all just seems to have disappeared overnight.</p><p>Louis didn't really remember much of that, given that she was only about six years old when it happened. The castle had mostly been rebuilt when she started school, although there were a few parts that students weren't allowed to go into and several commemorative plaques throughout the halls filled with the names of students and adults alike who'd lost their lives in the fight.</p><p>After all the turmoil everyone had been through, it didn't make sense to Louis why anyone would willingly practice dark magic.</p><p>She shivered at the thought. Even though her mum had said the very idea was ridiculous, Louis couldn't seem to let it go. What if her mum was wrong? What if this witch <em>did</em> practice dark magic and her mum just didn't know?</p><p>Louis doesn't bring the subject up again for the rest of the night, but there's a tension in the house that's never been there before. At first Louis thinks it's just Lottie being angry at Louis over her candles, but she's had Lottie be angry at her plenty of times in the past, so it can't be just that. Louis itches to pull her mum aside to talk about it properly, just the two of them, but she never manages to find the right time.</p><p>Two whole days pass before Jay brings it up again, and while Louis has been waiting the whole time for this moment, she certainly didn't expect it to happen the way it does.</p><p>"You want me to <em>what</em>?" she asks, positive that she's misheard her mum.</p><p>"I want you to take this welcome basket over to Nick."</p><p>"<em>Nick</em>?" Louis repeats incredulously. "What, we're on a first name basis with this--"</p><p>"Louis," Jay says in a warning tone.</p><p>"<em>Woman</em>," Louis finishes, obviously having switched out whatever word she was going to use. "I just… Mum, I don't understand."</p><p>"I don't expect you to, but you're going to do this and you're going to be polite about it." She thrusts the basket into Louis' hands and crosses her arms with an air of finality. There's no way Louis is going to be able to talk her way out of this.</p><p>Louis sighs heavily and looks down at the basket, filled with a number of homemade treats along with a few jars of her mum's own products. She recognizes them instantly, mostly from the days she's spent selling them at the local market in town, and she can't actually believe her mum's about to share them with this outsider.</p><p>"Mum!" she cries. "What if--"</p><p>"Louis," Jay repeats in the same tone. "I don't want to hear it."</p><p>"But Mum--"</p><p>"Lottie! Fizzy!" Jay calls, cutting Louis off before she can say another word.</p><p>Louis groans loudly, sinking into a chair with the basket still in her hands as her two sisters come into the kitchen. Lottie's mostly forgiven Louis, but it doesn't mean that she's not still a little bitter towards her.</p><p>"What's going on?" Fizzy asks as she looks back and forth between Louis and their mum.</p><p>"I want you two to go with Louis," Jay says. "Make sure she doesn't pitch the basket and I expect all three of you to give Nick a nice, proper welcome."</p><p>"Do we have to?" Lottie asks with a soft groan.</p><p>"Yes," Jay answers. Lottie sags a little but Fizzy just shrugs, seemingly indifferent to the whole situation.</p><p>"When're we leaving?" she asks. Jay looks at Louis and smiles brightly.</p><p>"No time like the present."</p><p>*</p><p>The welcome basket isn't overly large but it's a little awkward to carry for longer than a few minutes, which makes Louis extremely thankful that she's one, an adult wizard and two, has her wand with her. She charms the basket with a simple spell and it floats along beside her, but it doesn't lift her mood by any means. She's still extremely annoyed that her mum's made her, Lottie, and Fizzy some bizarre welcoming committee.</p><p>Louis can't help but think about how if she'd been allowed to go on her own she would've Apparated to Nick's front doorstep, dropped off the basket, and then gone down into town to visit Harry for half an hour or so. Then she would've gone home to her mum's and everything would've been fine.</p><p>Lottie and Fizzy walk ahead of Louis, chattering amongst themselves as Louis drags herself along. She's in a rotten mood because of all of this and the fact that she's getting absolutely no empathy from her sisters certainly isn't helping. She stops dead in her tracks and the basket hangs in mid-air beside her. She crosses her arms over her chest and glares at her sisters' backs for nearly thirty seconds before they even realize she's not keeping up.</p><p>"What're you doing?" Fizzy calls.</p><p>"I'm not going!" Louis shouts, just barely resisting stomping her foot.</p><p>"Mum said we have to," Lottie says in return. Louis can see her rolling her eyes even with the distance between them.</p><p>"Aren't you two the least bit suspicious of all this?" Louis asks, staying firmly in place as her sisters walk back towards her.</p><p>"Not really," Fizzy answers honestly. "Should we be?"</p><p>"I don't know," Louis says, huffing. "Probably?"</p><p>"Why?" Lottie asks. "That's stupid."</p><p>"You're stupid," Louis snaps. Lottie sticks out her tongue at Louis, who mimics her.</p><p>"I'm telling Mum," Fizzy says. "You're both idiots and at this rate, we'll never make it to Nick's before dark."</p><p>"Good," Louis says. "We shouldn't even have to go. It's stupid."</p><p>"You're stupid," Lottie says in a mocking tone. Louis glares at her but Fizzy's quick to get in-between them before they start bickering properly.</p><p>"The sooner we go, the sooner we can leave," she says. "All Mum said was that we had to drop off the basket and give Nick a proper welcome, she didn't say we had to stay."</p><p>"That's… true," Louis admits. She sighs softly.</p><p>"Just say hi, welcome to the neighborhood, and then piss off." Fizzy smiles.</p><p>Louis' mouth quirks with a smile. She should probably chastise Fizzy for the language, but their mum's not around so she can't find it in her heart to really care.</p><p>"I still don't get why you're being weird about it," Lottie says. "It's just a new witch--"</p><p>"That's just it, Lottie!" Louis interrupts. "A new witch, who we know nothing about! You don't get dark magic rumors started about you for no reason, y'know!"</p><p>"Or it's just a bunch of bored ninnies making it up! Mum wouldn't send us if she didn't think it was safe!" Lottie argues. "Since when do you think Mum doesn't know what's best for all of us?"</p><p>Louis scowls. It's not that she doesn't trust their mum. This whole thing is just unprecedented, is all. She knows loads of witches and wizards move all around the world all the time, but nobody ever comes to <em>their</em> town. Some small part of Louis foolishly thought that nothing would ever change.</p><p>"Doesn't mean I have to like it," Louis replies quietly.</p><p>"She's probably some crotchety old woman," Fizzy suggests. "Bet she'll have a million cats."</p><p>"Or toads," Louis adds, cracking a smile. "Or <em>warts</em>!"</p><p>"Lou," Lottie says as she tries not to laugh. "That's disgusting."</p><p>"Just saying." Louis smiles smugly. "She's probably awful."</p><p>"Then you two will get along famously," Lottie replies. Her smile is so large that Louis can't even find it in herself to be angry for the insult.</p><p>"Alright," she says with a resigned sigh. "Let's get this over with. Sooner we get there, sooner we can leave."</p><p>"That's what I <em>said</em>," Fizzy says with a huff. "Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"</p><p>"Because you're the middle child," Louis says as she flicks her wand, making the basket bump into Fizzy. "That's why."</p><p>"That's rubbish," Fizzy grumbles as she shoves the basket away.</p><p>The three of them walk together in a line for the remainder of the trek to Nick's cottage. It's tucked away on the other side of town, on the edge of the woods. There's a fence surrounding the property that looks a bit like the one that's around their house, but all it's protecting is patches of dirt and grass that have obviously seen better days. There's no lush garden like what Louis' mum has done, and even though there's a sensible voice in Louis' head that argues that it's highly unlikely for Nick to have done anything with the property in the few days she's lived there, even <em>with </em>the help of magic, Louis still counts it as a strike against her.</p><p>"Are we going up?" Lottie asks as she eyes the fence warily.</p><p>"You go first," Fizzy says, nudging Louis in the small of her back.</p><p>"Why me?"</p><p>"Because you're the oldest," Fizzy says.</p><p>"Because you've got a wand," Lottie adds. "And the basket."</p><p>Louis groans. "Fine. But stay close, alright?"</p><p>They open the gate and walk up the steps leading to the front door, but Louis hesitates before she even reaches for the doorbell. She's mostly weighing her options, debating whether to just leave the basket and run off or actually see what this new witch is like, but there's also a tiny bit of fear that she can't quite shake. Even if the rumor isn't grounded in truth, Louis can't stop herself from thinking the worst.</p><p><em>Just do it</em>, she tells herself. <em>Just ring the doorbell. It'll all be over soon.</em></p><p>"C'mon, Lou," Lottie whispers. "Sooner we do it, y'know."</p><p>"I know," Louis whispers back. "Just…"</p><p>"What?" Fizzy asks.</p><p>"If she invites us in, we'll say we have to get home," Louis whispers quickly, looking over her shoulder at both of her sisters. "Yeah?"</p><p>Both Lottie and Fizzy nod in response and Louis turns back to the door. She takes a deep breath before she rings the doorbell, and waits. A few seconds pass by without so much as a sound coming from the other side of the door. Louis glances back at Lottie and Fizzy again, but they just stare at her as though she's supposed to know what to do in this situation.</p><p>Louis sighs as she reaches for the doorbell again, pressing it for longer this time. The door swings open before she can pull her hand back and suddenly, Louis is staring down a sight she didn't expect.</p><p>Nick isn't old, not at all. She's a few years older than Louis, but not by much. She's also impossibly beautiful, even if she looks a bit disheveled as she stands in her doorway. Nick looks at the three of them with confusion written all over her face but then her eyes drop down to the basket in Louis' hands and a smile breaks out across her face, and Louis can't breathe.</p><p>Nick's even <em>more</em> beautiful when she smiles.</p><p>"Hiya," she greets. "Are you the welcoming committee or summat?"</p><p>Louis can't speak. She's completely forgotten how to form words at all. She wasn't prepared for this. This whole time she'd been imagining Nick to be around her mum's age or far older, she'd never even entertained the idea that Nick would be <em>young</em>.</p><p>She feels an elbow jab at her back and she lurches forward towards Nick, who immediately tries to catch her. Louis thankfully catches herself and whips her head around to glare at Lottie, who gives her a look in return that is probably meant to mean <em>what are you doing??</em></p><p>"Can you… speak?" Nick asks nervously. Louis turns back to her and tries to speak, but before she can even get one word out, Lottie's beaten her to it.</p><p>"I'm Lottie," she says. "This is Fizzy, and <em>this</em> idiot is Louis."</p><p>She jabs Louis in the back again and this time, Louis steps on her foot.</p><p>"Our mum sent us," Fizzy pipes up.</p><p>"Oh!" Nick says, her face lighting up. "Jay, right? Y'know, your mum's the reason I moved here."</p><p>"Really?" Lottie asks.</p><p>"Absolutely! Y'know, they still talk about her at St. Mungo's a lot. Always going on about how talented she is, and how they wish she hadn't moved away." Nick's mouth twists for a moment but her smile reappears as quick as a bolt of lightning. "But, I s'pose she couldn't necessarily be a full time healer somewhere like St. Mungo's and raise you three, eh?"</p><p>"Five, actually," Lottie says. "We've got two more sisters at home."</p><p>"Oh, really?" Nick laughs. "That's certainly a full house, innit?"</p><p>She looks at Louis again with a smile, and Louis barely manages to smile in return.</p><p>"Well," Nick clears her throat. "Would you like to come in?"</p><p>"Actually, we--" Lottie starts, but Louis stomps on her foot again, much harder this time.</p><p>"We'd love to," Louis chokes out over Lottie's cry of anguish.</p><p>"But you said--" Fizzy starts.</p><p>"Don't be rude, Fiz."</p><p>Nick steps back to welcome them in and Louis crosses the threshold quickly, leaving her sisters to follow behind her in a confused daze.</p><p>There are boxes everywhere, bits of packing material strewn about amongst half-unwrapped belongings. Nick leads them into the kitchen, where it seems she's spent most of her time since it's the most put-together. Louis directs the basket with her wand until it sets itself down on the kitchen table and Nick peeks at the contents, her smile growing ever-larger as she looks through it.</p><p>"This is amazing," she says. "Please tell your mum thank you. I'll have to get you lot something in return."</p><p>Both Lottie and Fizzy look to Louis for a reply, but Louis isn't useful in the least. She still can't take her eyes off Nick.</p><p>"Did you help with these?" Nick asks, looking to Lottie and Fizzy as she picks up one of the jars of their mum's mixtures.</p><p>"That's Mum's thing," Fizzy explains as she shakes her head.</p><p>"Did you work at St. Mungo's?" Lottie asks.</p><p>"I did." Nick hums softly. "I was training there for a while, but I, umm… left."</p><p>"How come?" Fizzy asks, despite Louis scolding her.</p><p>"Didn't work out for me," Nick replies. "Wasn't a good fit, y'know?"</p><p>"Mum thinks I might be a good healer, since I'm good with plants and stuff," Fizzy says. "But I dunno. I just like growing things."</p><p>"Nothing wrong with that," Nick replies with a smile. "What about you?" she asks, turning to Lottie. "What do you like to do?"</p><p>"I'm really into Divination," Lottie answers before Louis can stop her. "I'm hoping one day I'll be able to read minds, even though Mum says it's unlikely."</p><p>"You never know," Nick says as she nods her head. "Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it couldn't."</p><p>"That's what I said!" Lottie replies excitedly. "Mum thinks--"</p><p>"Lottie," Louis says sharply, causing her to go quiet. Nick gives her a strange look and Louis quickly avoids eye contact. She should've known better than to accept Nick's invitation, what with Lottie and Fizzy being two of the nosiest witches she's ever known.</p><p>"Sorry, have I said something wrong?"</p><p>"No, it's just..." Louis clears her throat. "Y'know."</p><p>"Umm…" Nick laughs a little, as do Lottie and Fizzy, although their laughter is much louder. "Don't think I do, actually."</p><p>"You'll have to forgive her," Lottie says, nodding her head towards Louis. "She got hit in the head with a Confundus Charm a while back, hasn't really been right since."</p><p>"Really?" Nick says, her voice going slightly worried. "There usually aren't any lingering effects unless the caster did something wonky to the spell, have you--"</p><p>"I'm fine," Louis says quickly. "Lottie was only joking, weren't you?" She looks at Lottie pointedly, who rolls her eyes and sighs loudly in return.</p><p>"Yes, sorry, Louis wasn't Confunded, she's just a wanker."</p><p>"Lottie!" Louis snaps. Fizzy giggles wildly and Lottie just smirks at her.</p><p>"Oh," Nick says with a soft laugh. "Good sense of humor, eh?"</p><p>"Did you live in London?" Fizzy asks, entirely ignoring the current topic of conversation.</p><p>"I did," Nick replies.</p><p>"What's it like?" Fizzy asks.</p><p>"Is it wonderful?" Lottie adds, sounding a bit dreamy. "We've only ever gone to Diagon Alley with Mum, but I'm desperate to go there on my own."</p><p>"Well," Nick chuckles, "it's crowded, and full of Muggles, but overall I quite liked it."</p><p>"Why'd you move here?"</p><p>"Fizzy, don't be rude!" Louis hisses.</p><p>"It's alright," Nick replies, smiling. "I moved here because I wanted a change of scenery."</p><p>"What're you going to do now that you're not a Healer?" Fizzy asks curiously.</p><p>Before Nick can answer, Louis interrupts to ask where the loo is. Both Lottie and Fizzy turn to look at her with matching looks of total confusion, but Louis doesn't look at either of them.</p><p>"Yeah, it's, um…" Nick points towards the doorway they'd come through minutes before, "down the hall, on the right."</p><p>"Thanks," Louis says quickly as she hurries out of the room, leaving her sisters entirely bewildered by her behavior.</p><p>Louis can breathe easier once she's out of the kitchen, away from her sisters and Nick. She's reminded of the time when she accidentally ingested Amortentia at school, ages ago. Harry had been trying to give it to one of their classmates (a hilariously failed experiment on his part) to see whether she fancied him, but Louis had ended up drinking from the goblet by mistake and subsequently fallen in lust with Harry for a few hours.</p><p>It was the most embarrassing few hours of Louis' life, once it had worn off and she'd realized what had happened. She didn't speak to him for a full week afterwards, making it a worse fight than the Muggle Studies one.</p><p>But she wasn't slipped any love potions this time. Her heart's pounding, her hands are shaking, and she can hardly say three words around Nick without feeling like a total idiot. This isn't a love potion, it's a <em>crush</em>, and it's worse than Louis ever imagined it could be.</p><p>She's got half a mind to just Apparate home and hole up in her room until the end of time, but she'd absolutely never hear the end of it from Lottie or Fizzy. The only way she's going to get out of this is if she holds her head up high and pushes through like it's nothing at all.</p><p>Louis has no idea how she's going to do it.</p><p>A few minutes pass before Louis finally forces herself to open the door and return to the kitchen, but she's momentarily distracted by the bookcases she hadn't noticed while walking down the hallway before. Unlike the other rooms she's seen of Nick's house, the bookcases are stocked full and, upon further inspection, are even <em>alphabetized</em>.</p><p>Out of pure curiosity, Louis looks for one of the books that Professor McGonagall had recommended to her for research. She can't quite believe it when she spots it on the third shelf, right next to <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>. Louis reaches for it but stops herself before her fingers even brush the binding.</p><p>Would it be rude to ask to borrow a book so soon after meeting Nick? Would Nick even lend it to her if she asked? Louis drops her arm and turns away from the bookshelf, the cogs in her mind turning faster than they ever have as she tries to figure this out.</p><p>Nick has one of the books she needs, and for all Louis knows she may have the rest. But being around Nick is positively embarrassing, and they've only just met. Louis can't imagine her crush getting any better if she spends <em>more</em> time with Nick, so how is she supposed to get Nick to lend her any books without becoming more friendly?</p><p>It's a dilemma and it's making Louis' head hurt.</p><p>When Louis returns to the kitchen, she finds the three engaged in a conversation even more lively than the one they were having when she left. She hovers in the doorway, unsure of herself for the first time in absolute ages.</p><p>Fizzy's the first to notice her, and she rushes over to drag Louis further inside.</p><p>"Nick was just telling us about this pub in London where…" Fizzy rattles off a half dozen details about some Muggle pub while Louis sneaks a look at Nick, who's got her face in her hands but her smile is wide enough to be seen through her fingers.</p><p>"I swear, I'm not a bad influence," she moans. "Not usually, anyway."</p><p>"It's alright," Louis says, quickly looking away when Nick pulls her hands away from her face. "It's usually me, so it's nice to have someone else to pin the blame on for a change."</p><p>Nick laughs at that and Louis feels her cheeks burn and her heart skip a beat at the sound. She has to get out of here immediately.</p><p>"I think we ought to be getting home," she says, clearing her throat as she takes a step backwards. "Mum's probably waiting for us."</p><p>Lottie and Fizzy let out matching annoyed groans. It's a far cry from how any of them were behaving before Nick invited them inside, but Louis is determined not to think about that too hard. She definitely doesn't want to think about how quickly Lottie and Fizzy seemed to get attached to Nick, either.</p><p>"Already?" Nick says as she follows the three of them out of the kitchen and back to her front door. "Well, you're always welcome to drop by. I'll, umm…"</p><p>Louis opens the front door and turns around, letting Lottie and Fizzy step through first, and her eyes meet Nick's.</p><p>"I'll see you around, yeah?" Nick says, a bit softer. She smiles at Louis and Louis' heart flips again.</p><p>"Yep!" she replies, far louder than necessary. "Say bye, girls!"</p><p>"Bye!" Lottie and Fizzy chorus as Louis steps over the threshold and pulls the door closed behind her. She doesn't breathe normally until they're through the gate and halfway down the road.</p><p>"That wasn't so bad," Fizzy says, half-skipping as they head back the way they'd come.</p><p>"Told you it wouldn't be," Lottie says, giving Louis a pointed look. "Told you there was nothing to worry about."</p><p>"Shut up," Louis mutters.</p><p>"Nick's nice," Fizzy adds. "I like her."</p><p>"Good," Louis says distractedly. She tamps down the tiny voice in the back of her mind that says <em>so did I</em>.</p><p>"She said she'd help me with Potions!" Fizzy goes on. "And she said she'd tell me more stories about St. Mungo's and stuff."</p><p>"She's got some books on Divination she said I could borrow any time I like," Lottie says, a little smug edge to her voice. "<em>She</em> doesn't think Divination is a waste of time."</p><p>Louis makes a mocking noise back at Lottie, and tunes them out for the remainder of their walk back to their house.</p><p>Nick had already offered her sisters so much, and for what? A few minutes of mindless chatter? Louis didn't know what to think. Maybe Nick was just so desperate to make friends in Rosemoor that she was willing to settle for Louis' younger sisters. She probably would've said yes if Louis had brought the book in from the shelf and asked to borrow it.</p><p>Louis curses her past self for not even giving it a try. She'd never been this timid in her life, why was it happening now? Why was it only happening with Nick?</p><p>*</p><p>Louis refuses to leave the house for a full week after her embarrassing display at Nick's. Lottie and Fizzy haven't shut up about Nick since they met her, and it does absolutely nothing to help with Louis' mental anguish. (Not that she's told anyone she's slowly losing her mind, that is.)</p><p>Instead of facing her problems head on, Louis hides away. She only ventures into town once, in the very early morning, to send an owl to Flourish and Blotts in Diagon Alley requesting the prices of all the books that Professor McGonagall suggested to her.</p><p>Her heart sinks ever lower two days later when she receives their response and finds that she'll never be able to afford all of the books. She's going to have to go back to Nick's and hope that she has more than just the one Louis saw on the shelf. And she's <em>really</em> going to have to hope that she hadn't ruined everything with her behavior towards Nick the last time.</p><p>It's also getting harder for Louis to keep this secret from her mum. The added stress of her encounter with Nick isn't doing Louis' mental stability any favors, and she worries day in and day out that she's going to slip up.</p><p>So Louis does the only thing she knows will give her some sense of clarity and peace: she practices brewing potions. She keeps a small cauldron in her room, despite her mum asking her not to, and she picks out ones from the later chapters in <em>Advanced Potion Making</em> that can be particularly tricky if you're not paying close attention.</p><p>It helps to get her mind off of Nick, but only until she runs out of her stash of ingredients in her room.</p><p>Louis thinks she's all alone in the house when she ventures down to the kitchen for tea and a few more ingredients for her next potion. The house is completely silent, which is what leads Louis to believe that her mum and sisters are all outside in the garden. The stairs creak under her feet as she makes her way down to the kitchen, keeping a careful eye out for any signs of her family members.</p><p>She's in the middle of rummaging through the cupboards, the kettle warming up on the stove, when her mum walks into the kitchen and foils Louis' plans of going unseen.</p><p>"What're you looking for?" she asks, startling Louis and nearly making her drop the container in her hand.</p><p>"Just, umm…" Louis clears her throat. "Meadowsweet."</p><p>"Think we're out, at the moment." Jay comes closer and gently closes the cupboard door and Louis' eyes drop down to her own hands. "You alright, love?"</p><p>"Just practicing, is all." Louis doesn't look up.</p><p>"Been practicing a lot, lately." She hums softly. "Hardly seen you."</p><p>Louis makes a soft noise of discomfort. She doesn't know what to say, how to explain what's going on inside her head. Whatever's taken up residence in her mind since meeting Nick has made an absolute mess of things, and she's worried too much will come spilling out if she tries to explain it to her mum.</p><p>"How about," Jay says as she tucks her hand under Louis' chin and tilts her face up, "you and I go into town together to get some more Meadowsweet, hmm?"</p><p>Louis cracks a smile and Jay laughs. "Just us?"</p><p>"Just us," she agrees.</p><p>As they walk from their house down into town, Louis expects her mum to steer the conversation back to why she's been holed up in her room for the last week, but she doesn't. Instead, they make idle chit chat about Louis' sisters and what they've been up to while Louis has been hiding herself away. It distracts Louis from her worries and before she knows it, they're in the centre of town amidst the hustle and bustle of everyone else running errands around them.</p><p>They're stopped time and again, because Louis' mum knows <em>everyone</em>, and after the fourth time, Louis starts to wander off on her own. She strolls aimlessly through the farmer's market stalls while her mum chats, until she turns a corner and freezes. No more than ten feet ahead of her is <em>Nick</em>.</p><p>She gets so flustered in two seconds flat and immediately tries to turn around to leave, but she doesn't quite make it around the stall next to her and ends up running into the corner and causing a commotion when she knocks into it. By the time she's cleaned up the mess, Nick's spotted her and is making her way over. Louis can't hide, she just has to stay still and wait for it to be over.</p><p>"Louis!" Nick smiles brightly as she switches her multitude of bags over to one arm so she can extend a hand to her. Louis stares at it for a full ten seconds without moving, and Nick ends up drawing it back when no effort towards a handshake is made.</p><p>"Hi," Louis replies, clearing her throat. This is already going even more poorly than the last time she saw Nick and it's <em>horrible.</em></p><p>"I didn't get a chance to say a proper thank you the other day," Nick says, apparently not being put off by Louis' lack of enthusiasm. "Y'know, for the basket."</p><p>Louis nods, keeping her mouth firmly shut. There's a fluttery feeling in her chest that she's trying to ignore as Nick smiles at her. Louis looks away, scanning the market for her mum, hoping that maybe she'll go back to feeling normal if she stops looking at Nick.</p><p>She finally spots her mum and breathes a sigh of relief as she carefully starts to edge around Nick, making sure she doesn't knock into anything this time around.</p><p>"I've got to be going," she offers as an excuse. She doesn't expect Nick to turn with her, nor does she expect Nick to <em>join her</em>.</p><p>"Oh, that's your mum!" Nick says delightedly. "Now I can thank her, as well!"</p><p>"No, I can-- you don't have to--" Louis groans as Nick shuffles over towards her mum, her multitude of bags rustling against her so loudly that it's impossible for Louis to keep her mum from seeing Nick.</p><p>She grumbles to herself as she follows Nick over, hoping that maybe her mum's finally talked out and they'll get to go back home soon. Judging by the smile on her mum's face, it's a lost cause.</p><p>"How wonderful to see you again!" Jay says as Louis comes to stand next to her. "I see you've run into my eldest, Louis."</p><p>"Yes!" Nick replies with a bright smile. "I was just telling her thank you for that lovely basket you sent over. It was so nice of you, I really appreciated it."</p><p>"The least we could do," Jay says, waving her hand at Nick before it settles on Louis' arm. "Been picking up a few things?"</p><p>Nick laughs. "Just a few," she jokes as she jostles her bags. "Didn't mean to go overboard, really. I'll be needing a big spell to get this all home, I expect."</p><p>"Louis could help!" Jay offers, and Louis chokes on nothing.</p><p>"<em>Mum</em>--"</p><p>"Oh, she doesn't have to," Nick says, but her mum's grip on her arm tells Louis that she doesn't have the option of saying no.</p><p>"She'd be delighted to," Jay says.</p><p>"Absolutely," Louis replies through gritted teeth. This is her punishment for hiding in her room all week, she just knows it. Louis almost wishes her mum had just interrogated her instead.</p><p>"I'll pick up the Meadowsweet," Jay says as Louis dutifully relieves Nick of some of her bags, "and I'll see you later at home."</p><p>Louis doesn't say a word as Nick and her mum say their goodbyes. Behind Nick's back she gives her mum a mutinous look that's met with a smile, and Louis curses under her breath.</p><p>If she didn't know better, Louis would almost think her mum was trying to play matchmaker.</p><p>"Meadowsweet?" Nick asks, striking up conversation once they've left the farmer's market. "Been helping your sister with her potions?"</p><p>"What?" Louis blinks as she thinks for a moment before she remembers that Fizzy had talked about it with Nick before. "Oh, umm, not exactly. Just been… doing a bit of boning up, I guess."</p><p>"Oh, alright," Nick says. Louis turns away and grimaces. <em>Boning up? You couldn't think of any other way to phrase that, you idiot??</em></p><p>"I've always loved the smell of it, don't you?" Nick goes on. "It's one of my favorite herbs to work with."</p><p>"Uh-huh."</p><p>Nick falls silent after Louis' reply, turning her head away and looking at the road ahead rather than at Louis. They're both quiet for a while, and Louis uses the time to try and think of something to say that wouldn't put her foot directly into her mouth, but suddenly Nick pauses in her stride and lets out a long sigh.</p><p>"I haven't actually done any spells in ages," she admits. "It's, umm, part of the reason I left where I was living before."</p><p>Louis' mind goes blank as she stares at Nick.</p><p>"I just… well, I messed up." Nick laughs in a self-deprecating way. "Fell in love with the wrong person, got mixed up and…" She looks at Louis. "Well, I'm sure you can figure out the rest."</p><p>Louis just keeps staring at her. She doesn't know how to process this information. The only thing her brain can come up with is a tiny army hellbent on destroying whoever broke Nick's heart, and that's certainly not helpful.</p><p>"You don't have to, like, mention it to your mum or anything." Nick clears her throat. "I'm not here to be any sort of competition or anything, I just, y'know, needed a fresh start."</p><p>Nick starts walking again, but she barely makes it a few steps before Louis speaks up.</p><p>"What're you going to do?" she asks.</p><p>"What d'you mean?" Nick looks back at her and Louis swallows harshly. She can feel her cheeks turning red under Nick's gaze.</p><p>This was <em>so</em> much easier when Louis thought she'd been put under some sort of spell.</p><p>"You've got all this stuff," Louis says. "What're you going to do with it?"</p><p>Nick laughs softly as she looks down at her bags. "Dunno. Maybe I…" She shakes her head. "Thought it couldn't hurt to keep some things on hand, just in case."</p><p>She smiles at Louis and it sets off that fluttery feeling in Louis' chest again. They're silent for the rest of the trip back to Nick's cottage, and Louis finds that even as Nick's thanking her for her help, she still can't say a word.</p><p>When she gets back home, Louis immediately goes up to her room and closes the door behind her. She falls onto her bed and closes her eyes, the image of Nick's smile dancing across her eyelids as her heart pounds in her chest.</p><p>She half-wishes she'd accidentally ingested Amortentia for a second time. At least it would wear off in a matter of hours rather than sticking around for who knows how long. But this isn't a spell or a potion, it's real, and Louis has no idea what she's going to do.</p><p>*</p><p>The following morning, Louis is woken up by an owl tapping on the glass of her window with its beak. She jumps out of bed to open the window and accept the tiny letter wrapped around its leg, and doesn't even bother closing the window again once she's seen who's written her.</p><p>
  <em>Louis,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Of course you can write to me again. I do wish I could be of more help to you in the physical sense, but this will have to do. Have you acquired the books I suggested? I do believe they're all available at Flourish and Blotts, though it's been a while since I've set foot in Diagon Alley.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I will ask you to be mindful of your mother's wishes. I'm sure you remember as well as I (or perhaps better) the Howler she sent in your fifth year. Remember that you would've been under my supervision then. She may be even more reticent to support this process now that you're on your own, your age and skills notwithstanding.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But, if you still wish to become an Animagus, then good luck. It's well worth it, that I can tell you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Best,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Minerva McGonagall</em>
</p><p>Louis reads the letter through several more times before she tucks it inside of her Transfiguration textbook with the others. She climbs back into bed and pulls the covers up to her chin, letting her thoughts run wild.</p><p>Professor McGonagall has a point, after all. They had been through this once before, when Louis was in her fifth year and had decided she wanted to become an Animagus. She can still remember the excitement she felt writing home to her mum for permission, as was necessary since she was still underage and at school.</p><p>She doubts she'll ever forget the Howler her mum sent back.</p><p>Louis pushes the memory away, taking a deep breath and letting it out slow as she tells herself that this time will be different. She's an adult, she has Professor McGonagall's blessing, she can do this.</p><p>All she needs is a little bit more time, and a few more books.</p><p>Thinking about the books she needs leads her thoughts to Nick. She finds herself wondering what Nick's up to, rationalizing her curiosity by telling herself it's a necessary connection. She already knows Nick has one of the books, it's only logical for Louis to wonder about the rest.</p><p>But then… her mind starts to wander off course. She wonders if Nick's tried brewing a potion in her new kitchen. She thinks about all the boxes scattered around Nick's house and wonders if they've all been unpacked. She can't help but wonder why anyone would give up a career as a Healer, especially when they haven't got a family of their own to lean on for support.</p><p>Guilt washes over her when she thinks about how her mum must've been whispered and gossiped about when she first moved to this town. On her own with a young daughter, having left behind her career and everything she knew just to get a fresh start.</p><p>Louis shuts her eyes, groaning softly as she rolls away from the window and buries her face against her pillow.</p><p>No wonder her mum told her to be nice to Nick.</p><p>She slips out of the house mostly unnoticed later that morning, making her way across town towards Nick's cottage. Even though it takes far longer to walk, she doesn't trust herself to Apparate without getting Splinched. Her heart starts beating faster the closer she gets, until she's standing around the corner from it and her legs are threatening to give out from under her from nerves.</p><p>She tells herself that she's nervous because she's trying to be sneaky, and that's not always gone well for her in the past. She hesitates further by the fence surrounding Nick's cottage, twisting her hands around the wooden pegs and tugging on them. She accidentally pulls one out of the ground after tugging too hard, and she curses under her breath before whipping out her wand to put it back.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she spots a curtain fluttering in one of Nick's windows and she quickly drops down to the ground to avoid being seen. As she presses her forehead against her knees, Louis starts muttering to herself.</p><p>"What're you even doing? This is stupid!"</p><p>She straightens up after a minute or so, brushing the dirt from her legs as she glances at Nick's cottage again. A breeze blows by and the curtain flutters once more, and this time Louis finds it irritating rather than nerve-wracking.</p><p>"Idiot," she mutters grumpily before turning on her heel and heading back home.</p><p>The following morning, she does it again. And again the next day, and the next, continuing on through the week even though she never gets further than Nick's fence.</p><p>On the fifth day Louis spends hanging around the fence, everything changes.</p><p>A loud crack startles her so completely that she falls onto her backside with a shout, and suddenly she's staring up at Nick who's appeared beside her.</p><p>"Ooh, sorry! Didn't mean to scare you."</p><p>"Didn't mean to scare me?" Louis says, her usual timid demeanor around Nick giving way to her anger over being surprised. "You Apparated within an inch of me and you didn't mean to <em>scare</em> me?"</p><p>"I always forget about the crack," Nick says as she extends her hand down to Louis to help her up. "Don't really like to Apparate much. Makes me all queasy."</p><p>"Then why'd you do it?" Louis asks grumpily as she gets to her feet, brushing the dirt from her bum.</p><p>"Had to make sure you wouldn't run off before I could get to you," Nick answers with a smile.</p><p>"What d'you mean?" Louis asks, even though she absolutely already knows the answer.</p><p>"Don't think I haven't noticed you hanging around," Nick says with a smile.</p><p>"I haven't," Louis says quickly, but it doesn't stop Nick from continuing on.</p><p>"Been wondering if you were gonna actually come up to the door or not."</p><p>Louis flushes and looks away.</p><p>"D'you wanna come in?" Nick asks in a careful tone. "Have a cup of tea?"</p><p>"I… um…" Louis looks at the house, then at Nick, and then around at the empty road leading back to her mum's house. There's absolutely no reason for her to say no, especially now that Nick's actually <em>caught</em> her outside.</p><p>Louis has been trying to gather the courage to go up to the door for days, and now here she is being handed an opportunity to go inside, practically on a silver platter. If there were ever a time for Louis to stop being scared, it's now.</p><p>"Yes," she forces herself to say. "That would be… nice."</p><p>Nick smiles widely. "Excellent."</p><p>*</p><p>Louis follows Nick's steps from the door towards the kitchen in a hesitant manner. Her house is far more put together than it was the last time Louis was here, and Louis wonders offhandedly how long it took Nick to get everything just right.</p><p>The kitchen is meticulously organized; rows and rows of jars line the countertop and through the glass panes of the cupboards Louis can see more of the same. She can't help comparing Nick's kitchen to her mum's back at home, wondering if her mum was this organized once upon a time. She imagines it's hard to keep one room orderly with kids roaming about, let alone an entire house.</p><p>Maybe she'll enlist her sisters to help tidy up the house for Mother's Day or something. Louis thinks her mum would like that.</p><p>"What sort of tea would you like?" Nick asks, her voice snapping Louis out of her own thoughts.</p><p>"Umm… whatever you're having is fine," she answers timidly. Louis tugs at her sleeve as Nick turns her back, rummaging through one of the cupboards until she finds what she's looking for. Louis twists the fabric of her sleeve between her fingers as she stands on the opposite side of the kitchen counter from Nick.</p><p>It's a surprise to Louis to see that Nick doesn't use magic to make tea, considering it's what most witches and wizards do. Louis' mum prefers to make it the Muggle way and to see Nick doing the same comforts her in a way she hadn't known she needed.</p><p>"Sorry it took so long," Nick says as she sets a mug down in front of Louis. "I just think tea tastes better when you don't use magic."</p><p>"My mum says that too," Louis replies with a small smile.</p><p>"Really?" Nick smiles brightly. "Small world, then."</p><p>Louis nods, hiding her growing smile in her mug. The tea is still far too hot for her to drink, but at least holding the mug gives her hands something to do.</p><p>Silence falls over the two of them, the familiar tension of two near-strangers both trying to find something to talk about. Louis tries not to look at Nick but she keeps catching a glimpse of Nick's smile out of the corner of her eye and it's terribly distracting.</p><p>"So…" Louis looks up at the sound of Nick's voice, and Nick laughs a little. "What's got you hanging around my fence?"</p><p>Louis flushes and immediately looks down at the mug in her hands. "Would you…" Louis pauses to give a little awkward laugh, "would you believe me if I said I didn't know?"</p><p>Nick laughs louder. "I would, actually. Can't say I wouldn't do the same if I were you."</p><p>Louis should relax at that, but instead she remains just as nervous as before.</p><p>"I'm glad you decided to come inside," Nick goes on, her voice going a little softer. "Been a bit lonely around here, if I'm being honest."</p><p>"Lonely?" Louis repeats without thinking. She regrets saying it the moment the word's left her mouth and she wishes she had a Time Turner to fix her slip up.</p><p>"Yeah, y'know." Nick shrugs. "I don't really know anyone in Rosemoor. It's a bit scary, moving somewhere new."</p><p>"I wouldn't know," Louis says. "I've lived in Rosemoor all my life. Apart from Hogwarts, of course."</p><p>Nick smiles again. "Hogwarts, eh? Did you like it there?"</p><p>"Yeah," Louis replies, "it was brilliant. It's a bit sad now, watching my sisters go off to Hogwarts while I stay home. But… y'know. I had my time there." Louis shrugs. "It's their turn now."</p><p>"I've heard all sorts of stories about Hogwarts," Nick says. "Sounds like a pretty amazing place."</p><p>"You didn't go to Hogwarts?" Louis asks, confused.</p><p>Nick shakes her head. "Nah, I went to Beauxbatons. Dunno why my parents decided to send me there, of all places, I don't even bloody speak French."</p><p>Louis' eyes widen. She's never known anyone who went to Beauxbatons. She'd only heard stories about it from older students whose family members had gotten to meet students from there and Durmstrang during the Triwizard Tournament.</p><p>(The Triwizard Tournament had been permanently retired after the death of Cedric Diggory, mostly due to the protest led by Cedric's parents. They rightfully blamed the Ministry for his death because if it hadn't been for the tournament, Cedric would probably be alive today. The outcry was so substantial (especially after Harry Potter himself went public with his support of Cedric's parents, that the Ministry was forced to decree that it was, in fact, too dangerous for underage wizards and subsequently banned any future tournaments.)</p><p>"What was it like?" Louis asks, leaning forward on the kitchen counter. "Did you really have a Giant for a Headmistress?"</p><p>Nick's eyes crinkle as she laughs loudly in delight, and Louis' heart flutters. It's entirely possible that Nick's laugh is the sweetest sound she's ever heard.</p><p>The hours seem to fly by as Nick regales Louis with stories from her years at Beauxbatons and the time she spent in London. It all sounds so exciting to Louis, who's only ever been to Diagon Alley to buy supplies for Hogwarts. She can't stop her mind from daydreaming of what it must have been like to live in London, which leads her down the path to imagining what it would be like if she had met Nick there instead of in Rosemoor.</p><p>Nick doesn't explicitly say what made her come to Rosemoor, and even though Louis is <em>dying</em> to ask, she keeps her mouth shut. She reasons that it's none of her business, no matter how curious she may be. Besides, there's a certain piece of information that Nick lets slip that is a thousand times more important to Louis than whatever brought Nick to Rosemoor: <em>Nick likes girls</em>.</p><p>At first, Louis thinks she must've misheard Nick as she's telling a story from when she lived with her former girlfriend. Plenty of women refer to their best friends as their girlfriends, so Louis doesn't let herself get her hopes up just yet. But the further into the story she gets, the more it becomes clear that the bond between Nick and this girl wasn't just friendship.</p><p>Louis' heart pounds as she hangs on every word Nick says. All this time she'd been thinking she had imagined all the looks that Nick had given her, that the smiles had been nothing more than Nick being friendly.</p><p>She thinks back to when she first heard about Nick's arrival and how angry she'd been. If only she'd known then.</p><p>"Anyway," Nick says, "I've been going on and on and I'm sure you're well sick of listening to me."</p><p>"I like listening to you talk," Louis replies with a shy smile.</p><p>"Well, if it's alright, I'd like to hear you talk now," Nick says as she rests her chin in the palm of her hand. "Tell me all about Louis Tomlinson."</p><p>And so she does. Louis tells Nick about her mum and sisters, about their kooky little house and how some days her sisters drive her up the wall but somehow they're all still thick as thieves. She talks about the odd jobs she's had all over Rosemoor, and how none of them have lasted for more than a month.</p><p>(It isn't necessarily her fault. Louis just has a difficult time dealing with insufferable people.)</p><p>She mentions Harry, of course, and she <em>definitely</em> notices how interested Nick becomes when he's brought into the conversation. But just like she kept her mouth shut when Nick brought up an old girlfriend, Nick doesn't ask her point-blank about whether or not Harry is or has ever been her boyfriend.</p><p>So Louis takes matters into her own hands and tells Nick the Amortentia story.</p><p>"I'm telling you, he's lucky I didn't revoke his best friend status on the spot," Louis says proudly as Nick howls with laughter.</p><p>"Not your type, then?" Nick asks slyly.</p><p>Louis makes sure she's looking Nick right in the eye when she says, "definitely not."</p><p>There's a softness to the air surrounding them in the minutes that follow. They both remain silent for a while, exchanging soft smiles as they enjoy each other's company. It's reminiscent of the silence they shared just a few hours ago, but this time there's no trace of awkwardness. The nervousness between them now has a different connotation, and Louis is aching to see where it goes.</p><p>Unfortunately, she catches a glimpse of the time and her heart drops. She's been gone for nearly five hours. She hadn't told anyone she was leaving the house in the first place, having thought she wouldn't be gone for very long.</p><p>Her mum's going to kill her.</p><p>"I have to go," she says suddenly, taking a few steps back from the kitchen counter. Nick stands up straight and watches Louis with careful eyes, as though she's worried she's gone and done something wrong.</p><p>"Are you--"</p><p>"It's just…" They both laugh a little as they talk over each other, but Louis is the first to recover. "Been gone a while. My mum might be wondering where I am."</p><p>"Better run along, then." Nick's hands fidget at her sides and Louis' eyes are drawn to the movement. She looks up at Nick's face again and wishes she didn't have to go.</p><p>"Could I… umm, would it be alright if I came by again sometime?" Louis asks.</p><p>Nick smiles broadly. "You're welcome anytime, Louis."</p><p>*</p><p>To her sisters' surprise and her mother's content, Louis starts spending more time with Nick. She goes to Nick's house nearly every day of the week, though the time spent there varies from an hour or two or almost all day long. Louis insists that she's helping Nick settle in (although Nick's now been in Rosemoor for over a month), but given the looks that her sister and mum share behind her back, they don't necessarily believe her.</p><p>The truth is that all Louis and Nick do is talk. There's absolutely no funny business occurring while Louis is there, even though she's dreamt of it half a dozen times or so. It's impossible for Louis to tell whether Nick is even interested in any funny business and she certainly doesn't have the courage to ask, which leaves her rather frustrated in more ways than one.</p><p>Still, she keeps going back. She wants to spend as much time with Nick as she can (even though Harry has started sending her owls mourning her absence and saying if she'll just come down to the shop <em>once</em> this week he'll let her harass him to her heart's content). And as long as Nick lights up whenever Louis appears at her door, Louis will keep on doing so.</p><p>Nick tells her more stories from London, from Beauxbatons, and even further back. They share secrets over cups of tea and biscuits, giggling at past incidents of foolishness and swearing to never repeat what's been revealed. Louis tells Nick things that she's never even told her sisters or her mum, all except one.</p><p>And it's one she desperately wants to talk about. (Apart from wanting to kiss the living daylights out of Nick, that is.)</p><p>It's partially due to the fact that whenever she's around Nick, her brain goes a bit haywire. She forgets about anything that isn't in the here and now, which usually means that she spends most of her time staring into Nick's eyes and trying to come up with new ways to learn even more about her than she already knows. Even if Louis tells herself a hundred times to stick to a plan before she goes over to Nick's cottage, once she's there everything goes immediately out the window.</p><p>Regardless of how immensely frustrating it is, Louis can't seem to stop herself from continuing to do it.</p><p>She decides to write to Professor McGonagall, thinking perhaps she'll have some good advice. Before she starts her letter, she re-reads one of Professor McGonagall's previous letters in which she mentioned Louis ought to seek out someone who's particularly gifted in potions. In Louis' opinion, who better than a healer? (Her mum notwithstanding, for obvious reasons.)</p><p>
  <em>Professor McGonagall,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I've made a new friend who used to be a healer at St. Mungo's and I'm thinking of asking for their aid in my goal to become an Animagus. In one of your previous letters you suggested I should find someone who's particularly gifted in potions and, excluding my mother and my younger sisters, this new friend of mine is all I've got.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>What I'm not sure of is how to go about asking. It's a rather sensitive subject for me personally, and even though it's not illegal (unless of course I don't report myself to the Ministry upon reaching my goal, which I don't intend to forget to do) I do worry about the possibility of failure and dragging someone into said failure and the consequences that may result from it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Am I just overthinking it? Should I just be brave and ask anyway?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The worst thing that could happen is they say no. I was right terrified asking you, and you said yes, so perhaps I'll get lucky again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Louis Tomlinson</em>
</p><p>After finishing her letter, Louis pauses for a moment and reads over her scribbles. By the time she's reached the end she's absolutely horrified by the stream of consciousness written on the page and decides she can't possibly send this to Professor McGonagall after all.</p><p>She crumples up the parchment and flicks her wand, setting it alight and watching it burn to ash right before her eyes. She sweeps the remnants into the small bin under her desk and then grabs a fresh sheet of parchment, deciding instead to give Professor McGonagall a short update on her progress (or lack thereof).</p><p>
  <em>Professor McGonagall,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I haven't been able to acquire the texts yet, but I've got a friend who may be able to help me. Hopefully the next time I write you, I'll have something better to report. Setbacks aside, I'm still very much dedicated to the success of this project.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Louis Tomlinson</em>
</p><p>"Much better," Louis says to herself. She blows gently on the ink, willing it to dry quickly so she can roll up the parchment and take it down to the Owl Post Office without delay.</p><p>Louis goes bounding down the stairs, intending to run out the door and down into town, but she comes to a skidding stop when her mum appears at the bottom. Louis holds the parchment behind her back and smiles at her, hoping that for once her mum won't see right through her and ask what's going on.</p><p>"Where are you off to in such a hurry?"</p><p>Louis gulps. "To see Harry," she lies quickly.</p><p>"At the market?" Louis nods, and her mum smiles. "I'm sure he'll be happy to see you. I spoke to Anne yesterday and he's been missing you a bit, these last few weeks."</p><p>"Yeah," Louis says as her cheeks go red. "I thought, y'know, I should go and see him so he doesn't throw a fit or something."</p><p>"S'pose you should," she replies, laughing softly. "Surely Nick can survive without you for a day."</p><p>"<em>Mum</em>."</p><p>"I'm glad you've befriended her, and not just on my behalf--"</p><p>"<em>Mum!</em>"</p><p>"Alright, alright." She steps back and lets Louis step off the last stair. "Off with you. Give Harry my best, will you?"</p><p>"I will," Louis says, pausing to kiss her mum on the cheek before she sets off through the front door and down the front walkway.</p><p>After her stop at the Owl Post Office, Louis goes into the market looking for Harry. It's been so long since she's actually seen her best friend that she doesn't know if he's working today or not. When she sees a familiar mess of brown curls, she's half relieved and half annoyed. If he wasn't working then she could've just gone on to Nick's like she was planning.</p><p>Then again, if Harry hadn't been working and Louis hadn't seen him, then word probably would've floated back to her mum and she would've known Louis was lying. Louis sighs a little and then puts a smile on her face as she skips over to give Harry's curls a good tug.</p><p>"Ow!" Harry spins around, his face softening when he sees Louis. "Lou!"</p><p>"Hazza," Louis says, her smile becoming more natural as Harry's widens. "Been a while, hasn't it?"</p><p>"More than," Harry says with an indignant huff. "You've all but abandoned me."</p><p>"I did not. I've just made a new friend, is all."</p><p>"Friend," Harry repeats with a huff. "Is that what you're calling her?"</p><p>Louis turns bright red and smacks Harry's shoulder once, and again when he starts to laugh at her.</p><p>"Alright! I'm sorry!" He says, holding his hands up defensively.</p><p>"You bloody well should be," Louis replies. "Me and Nick are just friends, thank you very much."</p><p>"Alright, alright, if you say so." There's a glint in Harry's eyes that gives Louis the urge to smack him again, but she holds it back for the time being. If he really deserves it later on, she'll let him have it.</p><p>"So..." Louis says after the silence that follows. Harry is just smiling at her, like he always does, but Louis can't help feeling awkward.</p><p>She's missed Harry, she <em>has</em>, but there's an itch under her skin that won't go away. She wonders what Nick's doing at that very moment. Is she waiting for Louis? Has she made a pot of tea in anticipation of a visit that might not happen today?</p><p>"Louis? Did you hear me?"</p><p>Louis blinks and realizes Harry's hand is in front of her face. She pushes it away with a grimace, which only makes Harry's smile wider.</p><p>"Shut up," she grumbles.</p><p>"And you think I've got my head in the clouds," Harry mumbles.</p><p>"You do," Louis says, having heard him perfectly well. "Going in about Muggles the way you do, I wouldn't be surprised if you fall in love with one someday."</p><p>"I will not," Harry says, his tone slightly petulant. "Muggles don't come to Rosemoor, you know that."</p><p>Louis opens her mouth to give a snarky reply when she hears a voice say her name behind her and she turns around to see none other than Nick Grimshaw standing at the end of the aisle.</p><p>"Nick!" Louis says brightly. Her face goes red immediately as Harry starts snickering behind her back, but she tries to cover the sound by clearing her throat loudly. "Doing some shopping?"</p><p>"Just a bit," Nick says as she brandishes the bag at her side, smiling as its contents rattle around inside. "You?"</p><p>"Just popped in for a visit." Louis nods her head towards Harry. "He's been lost without me."</p><p>"Hey," Harry protests.</p><p>"Sorry about that," Nick says, laughing, "Harry, right?"</p><p>"Yeah," he replies, extending his hand while giving Louis a pointed look. "Lou's best friend. It's good to <em>finally</em> meet you."</p><p>"<em>Harold</em>," Louis hisses under her breath.</p><p>"It's alright," Nick says, her smile never faltering. "That's probably my fault, innit?"</p><p>Harry and Louis answer at the same time, the former with an affirmative while the latter denies it. Nick covers her mouth as she chuckles, putting on a very serious face once she's recovered.</p><p>"Think I should let you two get back to…" Nick waves her hand around, "whatever it was you were doing."</p><p>Louis swallows her protest as Harry tells Nick goodbye, giving Nick the biggest smile she can manage (which, is to say, not very big at all). Even though she's spent the last several days in a row with Nick, she can't help but feel like she'd much rather go home with her in this very moment than stay at the shop with Harry.</p><p>In the hour or so that follows, Louis loses her luster rather quickly. Where conversation used to naturally flow between her and Harry, now it's stilted and slightly awkward. Harry's trying far harder than Louis and it's dreadfully obvious that her mind is somewhere else completely.</p><p>When Harry's shift ends, the two of them leave the shop and Harry unexpectedly pulls Louis into a hug. She stays still for a moment before hugging him back and gives him a curious look when he pulls away.</p><p>"What was that for?"</p><p>"Just wanted to," he says. He lets out a soft breath and then clears his throat. "Mum's waiting for me, I should probably…"</p><p>"Harry--"</p><p>"It's alright," Harry says as he gently knocks his knuckles against Louis' chin. "Just… y'know, don't be a stranger."</p><p>Louis twists her mouth to hide the fact that her bottom lip is threatening to tremble, and pulls Harry into a crushing hug. She shuts her eyes and thinks to herself <em>I don't deserve you</em> while she squeezes him as tight as she can.</p><p>She watches as Harry leaves, turning the corner to head for his mum's house and leaving Louis standing alone in front of the shop. She turns towards the road that leads back to her own house but hesitates. Her eyes wander over to the one that leads to Nick's cottage and before she knows it, her feet are moving her over that way instead of going home.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later she finds herself on Nick's front steps, waiting with bated breath for her to open the door.</p><p>Louis' heart fully skips a beat when the door swings backwards and Nick's face lights up at the sight of her.</p><p>"Well, isn't this a lovely surprise?"</p><p>With absolutely no forethought whatsoever, Louis rocks upwards onto her toes and presses a kiss to Nick's cheek. A flush blooms in her own cheeks as Nick's hand reaches up to touch the spot where Louis kissed her.</p><p>"I thought…" Louis pauses and clears her throat, laughing a little as she does so, "I thought I'd stop by on my way home."</p><p>"From the market?" Louis nods. Nick clicks her tongue and her smile turns a little wicked. "I'm not exactly on the way, am I?"</p><p>"Shut it," Louis mumbles as she ducks her head, hiding her face from Nick. "Can I come in?"</p><p>"Of course," Nick says, stepping aside at once.</p><p>There's a moment of hesitation as Nick closes the front door once Louis crosses the threshold. Just as Louis is about to make her way towards the kitchen, Nick reaches out and catches her wrist with a gentle grasp.</p><p>"C'mere," Nick whispers, "for a sec."</p><p>Louis hums curiously as she steps closer into Nick's space, twisting her wrist around so she can tuck her hand into Nick's. Both of them stare down at their intertwined hands until Nick cups her other hand against Louis' cheek, bringing her attention upwards.</p><p>"Nick--" Louis starts, but her breath is stolen in a heartbeat. Nick presses her lips to Louis', soft and timid, pulling away after a few seconds.</p><p>"I just--" Nick begins, but Louis kisses her again before she can get all of her words out. They stand there in Nick's living room, kissing each other over and over until they're both breathless.</p><p>Their kisses taper off naturally, and soon they're left just gazing at each other with matching fond looks and a ridiculously happy laugh escapes Louis' mouth.</p><p>"Hi," she whispers.</p><p>"Hi," Nick whispers back, laughing along with Louis. "D'you fancy some tea?"</p><p>Louis chokes back another laugh and Nick closes her eyes.</p><p>"I mean, I just thought--"</p><p>"I'd love some tea," Louis says. "And then more snogging."</p><p>Nick bites her bottom lip and nods. "That, umm, that sounds like a good plan."</p><p>"Meet you in the kitchen," Louis says, pecking Nick's lips once more before she slips off down the hallway.</p><p>On her way back from the toilet, Louis catches a glimpse of Nick's bookshelf and the letter she just sent to Professor McGonagall pops into her mind. <em>It's now or never</em>, a voice in the back of her mind says as she watches Nick go about making some tea for the two of them, and she steels herself to ask the question that's been burning for days.</p><p>"Nick?" Louis says tentatively.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Have you, umm," Louis jabs her thumb behind her towards the bookshelf in the hall, "have you read all of the books on that shelf?"</p><p>Nick hums. "Most, definitely. I dunno if I've gotten to all of them," she says as she pours hot water into two mugs. "Why d'you ask?"</p><p>"Just curious, is all." Louis looks down at the kitchen table and nearly loses her nerve. "I've-- I'm just interested in learning new things."</p><p>"What, like, independent study?" Nick asks as she pushes one mug towards Louis.</p><p>"Something like that." Louis glances up at Nick and is immediately worried by the look on her face. "What?"</p><p>"It's… well, magic is dangerous, innit?" Nick shrugs. "Anything could happen when you're messing about on your own."</p><p>"Well, yeah, but isn't that how new spells are discovered?" Louis argues. "By witches and wizards messing about on their own?"</p><p>"Is that what you're trying to do? Discover a new spell?"</p><p>"No, I'm just--"</p><p>"Because if you are, I don't think it's a good idea."</p><p>"I'm not," Louis says firmly, trying to keep her voice level. She's never been angry with Nick before but with the way this conversation is going, it's beginning to happen. "I just… want to learn new things."</p><p>"Academic, like?" Nick asks. "Not practically?"</p><p>Louis shrugs, noncommittal. She looks down at her mug again and tries not to feel so defeated. She half wishes she could go back to fifteen minutes ago, when they were kissing and everything was perfect. Now it's like her fifth year all over again, only this time instead of her mum sending a Howler, it's the girl she fancies treating her like a child.</p><p>"Hey," Nick says softly as she moves closer to Louis. "You can borrow any book you like, I just… I want you to be careful."</p><p>Nick reaches out and covers Louis' hand with her own. When Louis looks up and meets Nick's eye, a warm and fuzzy feeling spreads from her heart throughout the rest of her body and her anger melts away. She leans in for a kiss, feeling relief when Nick starts kissing her back without a second thought.</p><p>It's in that moment that Louis knows what she needs to do. She needs to prove to Nick that she knows exactly what she's getting herself into. Nick needs to see all the research she's already done, and the letters from Professor McGonagall herself.</p><p><em>Maybe</em>, she thinks, <em>just maybe, with Nick's seal of approval, I can finally do this.</em></p><p>*</p><p>The summer is quickly drawing to a close with every passing day. The countdown for the first day of term at Hogwarts for her sisters has begun, and with it comes an opportunity for Louis. It's a tradition for the six of them to go to Diagon Alley as a family to collect all the supplies the girls will need for the upcoming school year, but this time around Louis is planning to stay behind.</p><p>She begs off early in the morning, telling her mum that she's not feeling all that well and it's probably better for all of them if she just stays at home in bed. Lottie and Fizzy both think she's absolutely mad to miss out on a trip to Diagon Alley, whereas their mum seems rather suspicious of the whole thing.</p><p>Louis all but holds her breath while her mum makes a decision, hoping against hope that she'll allow her to stay behind. She is a grown woman, after all, not a child who can't be left on her own. But in order not to press her luck, Louis keeps her mouth resolutely shut.</p><p>"Alright," Jay says. "You don't have to come, since you're feeling poorly."</p><p>Louis lets out a sigh of relief but quickly covers it with a cough, hoping her mum didn't notice, and tugs her duvet around her tightly.</p><p>"Have fun," Louis tells the twins as they pass her by on their way towards the fireplace. "Bring me back something from the Weasely's."</p><p>"Or you could come get it yourself," Lottie says in a sarcastic tone. Louis coughs pointedly and glares at her younger sister.</p><p>"Alright, c'mon," Jay says as she takes the small pot of Floo Powder off the mantelpiece. "Lots to do today, stop tormenting your sister."</p><p>"She started it," Louis and Lottie say together. Fizzy snickers loudly and the twins giggle.</p><p>When their mum turns her back, Louis and Lottie stick out their tongues at each other. Less than a minute later, her family disappears through the fireplace and Louis is left with a blessedly empty house.</p><p>She drops the duvet from around her shoulders, letting it pile at her feet on the floor and leaving it there as she goes into the kitchen. The family owl, Penelope, is lightly snoozing near the window but stirs when Louis pulls one of the chairs out at the kitchen table and it scrapes along the floor.</p><p>It's all planned out in her head. All she needs is for Nick to say yes.</p><p>
  <em>Fancy some tea at mine today? I've got something to share with you. Come by whenever you like.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>x Louis</em>
</p><p>She waits a few seconds for the ink to dry before rolling up the parchment and attaching it to Penelope's leg. Penelope hoots indignantly at being woken up by the chair and now being expected to deliver Louis' message.</p><p>"It's not that far," Louis says. "You'll be back to napping in no time."</p><p>Penelope nips at Louis' finger but takes off from her perch a few seconds later, soaring into the sky and heading off towards Nick's cottage. Louis watches for a little while before she remembers herself and the load of work she's got to accomplish before Nick turns up.</p><p>She rushes out of the kitchen and towards the staircase, grabbing her duvet from where she left it before bounding up the stairs two at a time to her room. The letters from Professor McGonagall are right where she left them, in a neat pile tucked away in her desk.</p><p>Louis gathers them all along with her other research on Animagi and a few of her Hogwarts textbooks, trying her best to carry everything back downstairs without dropping any of it. The living room, albeit messy, is the best place in Louis' opinion to fully display everything for Nick to be able to peruse it all.</p><p>She's got a bit of work to do.</p><p>There are scattered toys belonging to the twins everywhere, various piles of dirt with odd labels in Fizzy's handwriting on each and every windowsill, and countless remains of Lottie's candles left to burn down to the wick. Louis sets to work clearing off the biggest table first so she has some space to spread out her research. All the rest is tidying up so Nick won't think she comes from a family full of absolute slobs.</p><p>Louis doesn't realize how much time passes as she's cleaning up, but suddenly she hears Penelope's familiar hoot and she realizes two whole hours have passed since she sent her off to Nick.</p><p>A large, bright smile spreads across her face as she goes running into the kitchen to meet Penelope. She feeds Penelope a treat as she carefully takes Nick's reply off of her leg, her heart racing as she unrolls the scrap of parchment.</p><p><em>Sorry</em>, it says. <em>Can't today.</em></p><p>Louis' face falls and her heart plummets to the pit of her stomach. She doesn't understand. Never in a million years had she expected this to be Nick's response. At the very least she deserves some sort of explanation.</p><p>"Don't go back to sleep," she tells Penelope as she rummages around the kitchen for another scrap of parchment.</p><p>Penelope hoots angrily as Louis sits down at the kitchen table with her new parchment and scribbles out another message.</p><p>
  <em>Why not? Is everything okay?</em>
</p><p>Louis pauses for a moment, biting her bottom lip as she wonders whether she should just come clean about the whole thing now. It could entice Nick to come by, but it could also scare her off entirely. Louis shakes her head and rolls up the parchment and goes back over to Penelope.</p><p>"Don't give me that look," she mutters as she ties her note to Penelope's leg. "Make sure you get a reply, alright?"</p><p>Penelope hoots once before she takes off again, leaving Louis alone. She sinks down into her previous chair at the kitchen table and waits with her head in her hands. Her head positively spins with the whirlwind of thoughts inside her mind, each one wondering how today has already gone so wrong when it started out so well.</p><p>Somehow this was a reality she hadn't prepared for. Every outcome she had thought out in her mind beforehand had counted on the fact that Nick would come over. Louis had tried to plan for every possible reaction Nick could have to learning about Louis' desire to become an Animagus, but she never thought she'd be shot down without even a chance to explain herself.</p><p>More time passes, the morning fading into the afternoon, without Penelope's return. Louis starts getting anxious as she watches the time tick by, knowing that her family will be coming back in the early evening.</p><p>This wasn't how it was supposed to go. Nick was supposed to be here by now. What could possibly be keeping her away?</p><p>By the time Penelope finally comes back, Louis has all but given up hope.</p><p><em>Just can't. Sorry</em>.</p><p>Louis crumples up the parchment, tossing it aside and covering her face with her hands. They muffle the scream that follows, but Penelope is startled by the noise regardless. She flaps her wings angrily and hoots, but Louis doesn't say a word.</p><p>She storms back into the living room and takes her frustration out on the carefully curated piles of parchment and texts laid across the table.</p><p>How could Nick do this? How could she spend so many days in a row talking to Louis, laughing with Louis, sharing <em>secrets</em>? Did it all mean nothing? Was Nick just waiting for Louis to get too close, too comfortable? Was she waiting for Louis to let her guard down, to let Nick in and start to fall for her? Was it all some elaborate plan to break Louis' heart?</p><p>Louis falls to her knees amidst the chaos she's created, pressing the heels of her hands against her eyes to keep the tears from coming. She's so angry, so frustrated, and so upset. She wishes she'd never gotten her hopes up the way she did, that she'd never let Nick Grimshaw into her heart. It all feels so foolish now, so childish.</p><p>"No," she says breathlessly, pulling her hands away from her face. "No, she's not going to get off this easy."</p><p>Louis Disapparates, reappearing seconds later in front of Nick's cottage.</p><p>"Nick!" she shouts as she runs up the steps. "Nick!!" Louis pounds on the door, continuing to shout Nick's name.</p><p>But there's no answer. Louis goes around to the closest window and tries to peek inside, but as far as she can tell, nobody's home.</p><p>"Nick!" Louis shouts again, back at the front door and pounding on it until her fists ache. "You… you can't. Why… Where'd you go?"</p><p>Her voice grows weaker with every word until she's got nothing left. She sinks to her knees and tears start streaming down her face, feeling nothing but defeat. It's a while before she's able to pull herself back up and walk away from Nick's cottage, but she doesn't get far at all before her despair turns into something else entirely.</p><p>Unspeakable rage fills her being, and Louis doesn't stop to think before she's pulling out her wand and aiming it at Nick's cottage.</p><p>It wasn't her intent, she definitely didn't plan this, but within minutes she's sent over a dozen hexes at the building. The windows shatter, the roof is littered with holes, and there's practically nothing left of the front door.</p><p>Louis stops suddenly, breathing heavy as she surveys all the damage she's done. Within seconds, she's filled with regret and absolute horror. How could she have done such a terrible thing?</p><p>And that's when she hears Nick's voice behind her. She whirls around, hoping against hope that she's misheard, that Nick isn't actually there to see the horrible thing she did. But Nick's right there, looking back and forth between Louis and her ruined cottage.</p><p>"What… did you do?" Nick says with a thick voice.</p><p>Louis half expects her to pull out her wand and retaliate; she certainly couldn't blame Nick if she did. But all Nick does is stare at her with absolute confusion.</p><p>"I… I'm sorry," Louis whispers so softly that Nick probably doesn't even hear it. There's nothing else she could possibly say that would make this better.</p><p>Ashamed, she Disapparates again. This time, she reappears down by the shore behind her house. She sits down by the water and pulls her knees up to her chest, burying her head against them as she silently starts to cry all over again.</p><p>
  <em>What have I done?</em>
</p><p>*</p><p>Louis trudges back up to the house after dusk has fallen, feeling very sorry for herself. She hasn't yet figured out how she's going to properly apologize to Nick, if Nick ever speaks to her again. Louis knows that Nick would be well within her rights to never want to see her again after what she's done, but she hopes that her rash actions haven't ruined everything.</p><p>The kitchen is dark when Louis opens the back door, but there's light coming in from the living room. It's not until Louis crosses the threshold that she realizes her mum and sisters must be home by now, and she remembers the mess she left in the living room.</p><p>"Mum?" Louis calls, her voice cracking slightly. She shuts her eyes and prays that nobody will answer, that she's still alone in the house.</p><p>"In here, Louis." Just by the sound of her voice, Louis can tell she's in a heap of trouble.</p><p>Jay is alone in the living room. As she stands in the doorway, Louis can't decide if she's relieved that her sisters aren't around, or if that's a mark of just how much trouble she's in. There's a roaring fire going in the fireplace and her mum stands in front of it with her back to Louis.</p><p>Louis swallows hard. "Mum…"</p><p>Jay spins around and Louis' eyes drop to her hand. It's trembling but Louis can still plainly see her letters from Professor McGonagall clutched in her mum's grip.</p><p>"I can explain."</p><p>"Can you?" Jay asks, her voice shaking with anger. "Go on, then. Explain to me how you could ever possibly think this is something I'd want you to do."</p><p>"Mum, I--"</p><p>"I told you no, Louis," Jay interrupts. "When you wrote to me from school, I told you no. I was very clear about how I felt, but--"</p><p>"But that was then!" Louis cries. "I'm older now, I'm more experienced, I can--"</p><p>"You can't!" Jay shouts. "I told you no!"</p><p>"But Professor McGon--"</p><p>"I don't care what she said! You're my daughter and you're not doing this!" Jay whips around and chucks all of Louis' letters and research into the fire before Louis can stop her.</p><p>"No!" Louis cries out as she runs forward, nearly reaching into the flames before Jay grabs her.</p><p>"This is for your own good," she says in a calmer tone, clearly trying to diffuse the tension that's filled the room.</p><p>Louis wrenches herself out of her mum's arms and starts shouting, "I'm not a child anymore! Don't you know that?!"</p><p>"You're my child, Louis! And I don't want you or your sisters to put yourselves in harm's way!"</p><p>"You don't know--"</p><p>"I do know!" Jay shouts. "I've seen it happen!"</p><p>For a moment, Louis is speechless. Jay sniffs loudly, clearing her throat as she rubs at her eyes.</p><p>"There was a girl I knew at school," she says, turning back towards the fire as she speaks. "All she'd ever wanted was to do… to be…" Jay takes a deep breath and shakes her head. "Professor McGonagall told her that she wasn't ready. That she wasn't a strong enough student to do it, but it didn't matter. She tried it anyway."</p><p>"What happened?" Louis asks softly.</p><p>"What do you think happened?" Jay says, turning back to Louis. "McGonagall was right. The girl almost killed herself in the process, and ended up in St. Mungo's for the rest of her life only half-human." She chokes back a sob, covering her mouth with her hand.</p><p>"But, Mum…" Louis starts carefully, "I'm not like your friend. Professor McGonagall thought I could do it when I was in school, so--"</p><p>"No," Jay interrupts firmly. "I don't care what she says, you're not doing it."</p><p>"Mum--"</p><p>"I said no, Louis. Now I've said it twice, and you need to stop this."</p><p>"That's not fair," Louis says, her voice turning desperate. "You can't forbid me from doing this, you can't!"</p><p>"As long as you live under my roof, you'll live under my rules," Jay says, her anger returning. "And I say no."</p><p>"Well, then, I won't live under your roof!" Louis shouts.</p><p>"Louis, you don't--" Jay starts, but Louis doesn't hear the rest of it.</p><p>She's already Disapparated.</p>
