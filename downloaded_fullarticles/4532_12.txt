<p>3. I will not force Cho to have a deep heart-to-heart talk about Cedric Diggory.</p>
<p>4. I will not tell Muggle-born first years that Death Eaters are your friends.</p>
<p>5. Due to the fact that "abracadabra" sounds very similar to a certain Unforgivable Curse, I am not allowed to say it.</p>
<p>6. Killing Muggles for the fun of it is called murder, not recreation. There is a very fine line, and I must respect that.</p>

<p>8. I will not grab the arms of random Slytherins and parade them around the Great Hall yelling "DEATH EATER! DEATH EATER!"</p>

<p>10. I am not to start Quidditch matches at inappropriate times and places.</p>
<p>11. The nickname "Dracy-Poo" is not funny.</p>
<p>12. Okay, maybe a little bit.</p>
<p>13. I will not sabotage Hermione in Potions.</p>
<p>14. Or in any other class.</p>
<p>15. I will not give Snape a Mandrake as a birthday present.</p>

<p>27. I will not take pictures of Slytherin girls and market it as "Voldemort's Secret"</p>

<p>36. I will not give out Puking Pastilles in Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>37. I will not sing "We're off to see the wizard!" for any reason.</p>
<p>38. I am to assume yelling "BAM!" every time I Apparate is distracting and not allowed.</p>
<p>39. I will not sneak butterbeer in from Hogsmeade and give it to the house-elves. Especially not Winky.</p>
<p>40. I will not cause a mass breakout from Azkaban.</p>
<p>41. Or St. Mungo's, for that matter.</p>
<p>42. Or anywhere.</p>
<p>43. I will not put up a Guess Dumbledore's Age booth when he goes out.</p>

<p>60. If Muggles wanted me to give them a ride on my broomstick they would have said.</p>
<p>61. I will not perform daily showings of Potter Puppet Pals in the Gryffindor common room.</p>
<p>62. Especially if that is not my House.</p>

<p>65. I will not accuse Ron of being in love with Fleur Delacour just so I can watch his face turn red.</p>
<p>66. If I hear Snape singing "When I Was Your Man" in the shower, I will not spread rumors that he's singing about (gasp!) Harry's mother.</p>

<p>68. I will not bring in Voldemort as the new DADA teacher.</p>
<p>69. Even if he doesn't kill anybody.</p>
<p>70. There are many good answers to put down when applying to the Ministry of Magic and they ask "Who was your greatest influence at Hogwarts?" Anyone who died before I was born is not one of them.</p>

<p>79. If Snape takes away my House points, I will not tell him what he can do with his wand.</p>

<p>81. Even inside my head.</p>
<p>82. If I write a scathing review of Hogsmeade on the Wizarding equivalent of the Muggle website TripAdvisor, I will not be allowed back.</p>
<p>83. I will not tell Professor Trelawney that I see myself killing her, even if that's exactly what I see.</p>
<p>84. I do not have a blobfish Patronus.</p>
<p>85. Those things are really ugly, so I do not really want one.</p>
<p>86. Muggles are not allowed to "drive under the influence". Wizards are not allowed to "fly under the influence"</p>

<p>90. Especially not first-year sacrifice.</p>

<p>92. Even if she IS a little loony.</p>
<p>93. I will not enchant the Sorting Hat to Sort everyone into a fictional fifth House.</p>
