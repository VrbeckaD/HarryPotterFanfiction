    <p>    Something was seriously amiss at Gray’s End. Outside the street was quiet, no cars jostling over the cobblestone streets in the shady corner of the quaint village, no neighbors milling about on their lawns or having a late evening walk. There were no signs of life, even though it was summer’s end and the days were longer, sunlight lingering with a grand auld stretch so that the children filled the streets well after their normal curfews.<br/>
</p><p>
Inside the cottage at 27 Kildare Place Daphne Stone sat in the kitchen, gazing out the window into the empty streets, a sense of forboding knotted in her stomach. This knot was nothing new, not with the news stories that came in every day, each one worse than the next, but it had tightened today and sat uneasily and unbudgingly behind her navel. Normally she would be out on the front lawn right now, watching Moira play with the other children in the neighborhood—ok as long as she was careful, which she always was, but Daphne still liked to keep an eye on things. Just in case. It was so east to forget sometimes, especially for children. On usual nights Rion would be there, too, sitting on the front steps reading the paper or briefs from the office, glancing up every so often to see what Moira was doing, that grin that had been so absent in recent years lighting up his tired face, giving her a flash of the carefree boy she had fallen in love with. It was moments like that which Daphne looked forward to the most. The little things that almost made you forget reality. Almost.<br/>
</p><p>
But tonight there were none of those moments. Just hours ago she’d been at the hearth, desperate, that feeling in the depths of her gut telling her something was wrong. Rion had insisted—still at the office, neck deep in crises happening in the southern counties—that it was just her imagination. That even if someone did want to hurt them, it was next to impossible. Not with the precautions they and the Ministry had taken. No way, and he’d be home soon. They could talk about it together.<br/>
</p><p>
Still.<br/>
</p><p>
The thought had persisted, gnawing at her, until she found herself crouched again in front of her fireplace, whispering fervently as Moira played with a toy boom behind her, toes skimming the carpet. Daphne choked back tears as her worries spilled out of her. The reassuring voice from the other end soothing her worst fears and offering a momentary solution, which she had accepted with a grateful smile on her tear-streaked face.<br/>
</p><p>
When Rion came home he found her sitting there at the table, still staring out the window, as if in a trance.<br/>
</p><p>
“Daph?”<br/>
</p><p>
She looked up, startled, daze broken. He set his briefcase on the counter and gave her a peck on the cheek. She wondered when he’d gotten so old. Or rather, when he started looking so old. The youthful, haphazardly enthusiastic boy, eager to take on the world, that she’d married 9 years ago had vanished in recent years, visiting occasionally but always sliding back behind that somber mask and prematurely greying hair.<br/>
</p><p>
“How were things at work?” she asked, knowing the answer already.<br/>
</p><p>
“We lost Dervish today. In a raid in County Carlow, near the McTavish Manor.” His face stayed striaght as he said it. They’d known Dervish for over 15 years, since they were kids at school. “Everyone else got out, but Wigglesworth is going to lose an eye with the curse she got hit with. Nothing to do for it.”<br/>
</p><p>
Daphne listened without comment, but reached out and grabbed her husband’s hand. He had turned away, but continued to talk, repeating the same horrors he did every night but with the names of different friends and acquaintances filled in, like some kind of macabre MadLib. It made her glad she’d quit working after she had Moira. They didn’t need the money, not with what her parents had left her and with what Rion made at his job. It meant she had time to keep an eye on Moira and her studies, and to be of a help elsewhere, when needed.<br/>
</p><p>
“Where’s my little one?” Rion asked, eyes lighting up for the first time since he’d gotten home.<br/>
</p><p>
He watched his wife bite her lip, registered the guilt in her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>
“Daphne, where is she?”<br/>
</p><p>
Daphne broke down, tears streaming from her dark eyes, flowing over the dark half moons beneath them.<br/>
</p><p>
“I didn’t know what to do, Rion.” Her voice was pleading. “Something bad is going to happen. I can feel it. I know you said to wait and I tried but I couldn’t I—” her voice broke off, and her husband’s anger subsided, guilt overtaking him for even questioning her doing what she felt was best for their daughter.<br/>
</p><p>
“Hey,” he said, face softening as it always did at his wife’s tears, crouching so their faces were level, taking hers in his hands. “Hey. Look at me. It’s ok. You did the right thing. You trusted your instincts. If nothing else, she’ll have a sleepover with the kids.” He kissed her hand. “I’m sorry I was angry. I just don’t like us to be separated, not with…everything. It makes it feel like we’re less in control.”<br/>
</p><p>
They left it at that, not discussing the day’s events any further as they sat down to dinner. That was the rule in the house. If you let it, it would overtake you. Boundaries had to be set. Life had to go on as normal as possible, or else they'd all go insane.<br/>
</p><p>
“I was thinking about going to visit your aunt for a few weeks. Just to take a little break. Maybe let Moira stay with her for awhile, until things get under control. Fergal is ok with it, I checked—just to be sure,” he added, when Daphne gave him an annoyed look. “It might be good to—”<br/>
</p><p>
He cut off, distracted by a loud blast at the front of the house.<br/>
</p><p>
“Stay here,” he hissed, pushing her under the table, the lights in the room vanishing with a silent wave of his wand. She watched as he slipped away toward the noise, forcing the feeling of panic to subside, to become manageable.<br/>
</p><p>
Muffled voices echoed from the main room, two of them too low to make out, just mumblings, one cutting high and sharp and feminine above the rest.<br/>
</p><p>
“…none of your friends here to help you this time, Stone.”<br/>
</p><p>
A chill ran down her spine. She knew that voice. And she knew what it meant.<br/>
</p><p>
Daphne grabbed her wand, ignoring the voice in her head telling her to hide, to run, that if she went now she could escape. Holding it out in front of her as she crawled across the wooden floor towards the voices, she let out a silent prayer of thanks that Moira had been sent away. That she was somewhere safe. If she went to her now they might follow her. She wasn’t going to let that happen.<br/>
</p><p>
“Crucio!” rang out out in the woman’s voice, gleeful laughter overcome by screams of anguish.<br/>
</p><p>
Daphne stood, all rational thought leaving her head, and charged in. The figures were in cloaks, black hoods drawn to hide their faces save for the woman’s, snakelike tendrils of hair floating around her pale face, eyes wide with rapture turning now to Daphne.<br/>
</p><p>
“Well, if it isn’t the teacher’s pet, all grown up,” the woman said, flashing a grin. “I always hoped it would get to be me.”<br/>
</p><p>
Daphne steeled herself, looking at the crumpled form of her husband on the ground, sweaty hand clutching her wand. He looked at her with the same golden eyes he’d passed on to their daughter, imporing her to leave.<br/>
</p><p>"Wait." The hooded figure next to the woman stepped forward, placing a hand on her arm. She snarled at him, jerking it away, but her loomed over her, not backing down. "The Dark Lord wants her alive."</p><p>

The woman's face contorted, and took a step toward Daphne, spitting at her feet. "You might be a traitor, but you're a smart traitor. And as much as I'd love to kill you here and now, my master sees a value in you." She gestured to the man. "Grab her."

</p>
<p>
She steeled herself. She knew what she had to do. She'd known for years that this moment would come someday, that she'd have to pay for her foolishness, her misguided loyalty. She would face it now with a fight to the end. It was the least she could do.<br/>
</p><p>
The man stepped to her, and she raised her wand.<br/>
</p><p>"Stop her!" the woman shrieked, lurching forward, wand drawn in a panic. But it was too late.</p><p>

Daphne's head filled in that fleeting moment, memories overtaking her. Her childhood room, the scent of her other baking drifting up the stairs. Elizabeth hexing her to make hair grow out of her nostrils when she ruined her favorite robes. The first time she saw Rion, dangling over the edge of a rowboat, peering curiously into the murky water. When she finally got to hold Moira for the first time, the fear and hope that simultaneously consumed her as she watched her grow. How at least she was safe now.<br/>
</p><p>
She pointed her wand at herself. And then the thoughts ceased.<br/>
</p><p>
The house filled with a flash of emerald light and a howl of anger, then another blinding light.<br/>
</p><p>
Everything went silent.</p>
