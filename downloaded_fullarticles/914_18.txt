    <p>
  <span>The Hogwarts Express was bloody beautiful. This thought had seized hold of the eleven-year old’s mind and refused to be put aside. If the train was that marvelous, she could only imagine what the school itself looked like. She hoped it lived up to her mother’s nostalgic stories.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Natalie!” her mother’s warm voice pulled her out of vivid daydreams and back to the loud, crowded platform. Natalie Borealis looked into her mother’s moist gray eyes, almost mirrors of her own. “Remember what I told you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t let anyone tell you who you are,” the girl repeated, a proud smile growing on her face in spite of the history behind the line. Natalie knew her mother had been cast aside and shunned by her own parents. The Malfoy family was deeply wounded when their sweet, vivacious daughter, Theia, fell in love with a muggle man and eloped off to the emerald fields of Ireland. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s right,” Theia matched Natalie’s smile. Her daughter had inherited the platinum blonde hair, gray eyes, and aristocratic features of the Malfoy family, along with Theia’s own innate knack for magic. Her husband’s passion for what he put his mind to had clearly been passed down to their daughter as well; Natalie’s gray eyes possessed latent embers waiting to be ignited. Theia knew the girl did not need to be cautioned about the potential difficulties of Hogwarts. “Be nice to your cousin, no matter what he says.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Abraxas?” Natalie curiously asked, she had never met her cousin due to the divide in the family after Theia’s marriage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” her mother said, “he’s a few years older than you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be nice,” the girl grinned. She gave her mother one last hug before dashing off to board the scarlet train. At last. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The aisle of the Hogwarts Express teemed with students, all dragging their heavy luggage while they shouted greetings to their friends after a long summer away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Natalie carefully pushed her way through the melee, searching for an empty compartment. A crease of anxiety crossed her forehead when it seemed all the compartments had been taken. Sighing her distress and feeling the train begin to move out of the station, she tugged her trunk and the cage holding her new kitten, Selene, towards the nearest compartment with the least amount of people.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you mind if I sit here?” she pulled open the door to the compartment which fit her criteria and asked the lone boy gazing out the window with a yearning expression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned and looked at her blankly for a moment before nodding his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” she murmured, entering and settling her belongings before taking the seat across from the boy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silence reigned in the compartment as the train chugged out of the station and began steaming off towards its destination. Both occupants remained quiet, neither wishing to begin a conversation, although each fully aware of the rules of societal norms which dictated they should speak to the other. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“First year?” Natalie finally gave in to the social pressure she had always found frustrating. She asked a question she already knew the answer to; it was obvious the boy was also a first year. The uncertainty and excitement brewing in his dark eyes was a dead giveaway, and his equally dark hair had been meticulously groomed to ensure he made a good impression. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” it was only one word but it seemed it had been carefully thought out and diligently crafted. “You?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Natalie said, realizing he already knew this too. She stuck out her hand. “I’m Natalie Borealis. Pleasure to meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom Riddle,” he replied, taking her hand in his. Her handshake took him aback; it was much stronger than the petite girl looked capable of. He found himself admiring and envying it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two grew quiet after the introductions, and it was clear to both of them that the other was perfectly content with taciturn observation. The lack of conversation between the pair was somewhat awkward, but neither was willing to reinitiate conversation, because they knew they would be unable to sustain it for very long. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their agreed upon silence was broken by the compartment door sliding open. Two young students, one boy and one girl — possibly their same age and year — stumbled in, both red in the face and panting for breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyone sitting here?” the boy gasped out, looking between the two already sitting. “We just caught the train, and there are no more empty compartments.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Natalie shook her head, moving over towards the window to make room for the pair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks!” the boy gave her a grin and the new duo stepped in to join them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Rebecca Macmillan,” the girl introduced herself after they had taken a seat. “First year.” She had curly brown hair, sparkling blue eyes, and was rather tall for her age. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I’m Logan Wernfeld,” the boy said, “also a first year.” He had dark, messy hair and impish brown eyes that made him look very much like an elf.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Natalie Borealis,” Natalie gave the pair a forced smile. She could smell trouble on them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tom Riddle,” Tom said, annoyed they had chosen his compartment to sit in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re also first years,” Natalie felt obligated to toss this fact out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, good!” Rebecca exclaimed, jumping up and down in her seat and making Natalie and Tom wince at her overbearing exuberance. “What house do you think you’ll be in? What’s your blood status? How hard do you think Potions class is going to be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>These were all questions Natalie did not wish to hear, nor answer. Her mother had been in Slytherin, thus she knew the most about that house. But she was not sure which house she would end up in; worried her blood status might compromise being in the same house as Theia Malfoy. This was also why she did not wish to reveal her blood status; she knew her extended family was ashamed of her mother’s marriage. It was a touchy subject, and a quick glance told her it was the same for Tom Riddle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Keep asking what people’s blood status is and you’ll end up in Slytherin,” Logan joked, elbowing Rebecca in the ribs. She screamed and went to slap him over the head. Their antics saved the other two from having to answer her interrogatives, much to their relief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the train ride continued in the same fashion. Rebecca Macmillan bouncing around like a wild animal, Logan Wernfeld antagonizing her, (it was clear the two were already great friends), while Natalie Borealis and Tom Riddle watched them coolly, hiding their irritation and occasionally exchanging glances, as though to ensure themselves they were not alone in thinking the other two were downright obnoxious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once they disembarked, Natalie found herself sailing across a glassy lake in a self-propelled boat with Tom Riddle, Rebecca Macmillan, Logan Wernfeld, and two other girls who introduced themselves as Shelby Cox and Kendall Stevenson. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the view of the castle came into sight, even Macmillan and Wernfeld were awed into silence, something which was greatly appreciated by those in the boat with them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why did she even think the train was beautiful? Natalie found herself marveling this as she gawked at the tall towers of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It was a glorious sight, and immediately seared itself into her memory for the rest of her life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Scrambling out of the boats and walking up to the castle was like a dream. As the doors to the Great Hall opened, Natalie’s breath caught in her throat as she stared, spellbound, up at the enchantment of the night sky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was hardly aware of the group of first years around her, being shuffled down the hall and to the front of the table, where a ragged old hat sat on a wooden stool. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then it started singing. Natalie snapped her attention away from the ceiling and to the hat as it loudly and rhythmically proclaimed the glories of Hogwarts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When it at last grew quiet, “Abbott, Sarah” was called forth from the crowd and shyly went up to take a seat on the stool and have the hat placed upon her head. Natalie quickly noted that the sorting was to be in alphabetical order and felt her anxiety ease, for she would be sorted sooner than most of the others. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Borealis, Natalie!” the tall wizard with an auburn beard announced and she felt herself stumbling forwards. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Next thing she knew, she was sitting on the stool with her feet swaying above the floor, the hat on her head. Her gray eyes scanned the crowd staring up at her; she caught a flash of blond hair in a group of black robes with green trim and wondered if this was her cousin. But the thought was put out of her mind when the hat began speaking in her ear.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Ah, Theia Malfoy runs off with a muggle and this is the result? How curious. . . .”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Natalie didn’t know if this was a compliment or an insult, but frankly, she found the opinion of a hat about her lineage was of little concern to her. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You’ll care about my opinion of which house to put you in,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> it chuckled and she froze, her hands grasping the seat of the chair in astonishment as the old hat read her thoughts. </span>
</p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Your potential lies waiting for you to decide which direction to take it, Natalie,” </span></em><span>the hat laughed in her ear. “</span><em><span>If you can control it. . .</span></em> <em><span>you’ll be best in </span></em><span>SLYTHERIN!” The sorting hat shouted this last word for the whole hall to hear. A jolt of shock and relief flew through her before the hat was plucked from her head and she made her way towards the applauding green table. </span></p><p>
  <span>Natalie wedged herself into one of the open spaces reserved for new first years, ignoring the piercing stare coming from her cousin, Abraxas. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was soon joined by a Quinn Bulstrode and a Melania Crouch, while Shelby Cox was sorted into Hufflepuff. Eric Dawson, a slender blond-haired boy was also welcomed into Slytherin, so was Pamela Selwyn, Tom Riddle, and several others with pureblood last names. The two annoying students who had made Natalie’s train ride a headache were sorted into Gryffindor, and Kendall Stevenson joined Shelby Cox at the Hufflepuff table, to her delight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the sorting wrapped up and the tables became laden with heavenly food, shy conversations began between several of the first years at the Slytherin table. Quinn Bulstrode and Pamela Selwyn already seemed to be friends, while Eric Dawson struck up a conversation with a boy named Adolphus Lestrange, and Natalie realized that these two were, also, already friends. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She, however, was more interested in the food before her than in the people around her at the moment. Indulging herself in the delicious meal, she listened to the conversations occurring, most of which seemed to be centered around classes tomorrow and what the professors would be like. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Move, first years,” a voice had Natalie averting her eyes up and to her right. A figure with bright blond hair and blue-gray eyes approached her. Abraxas Malfoy settled himself into the seat beside Natalie Borealis and spent a long moment staring at her as if attempting to read her mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, </span>
  <em>
    <span>cousin</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” he finally said, and the eyes of the other first years around them flew over to watch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Abraxas,” Natalie nodded in his direction. “Nice to finally meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, don’t sound too happy about it,” sarcasm rolled off his tongue easily. “I, for one, am astonished that my blood-traitor cousin managed to get herself sorted into Slytherin. I suppose you must have hoodwinked the hat, somehow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whispers broke out around them; Bulstrode and Selwyn seemed the most excited to discover this piece of information. A member of the Malfoy family being a blood-traitor? That was practically unheard of.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Natalie let out a small cough, well-aware that by now, half the Slytherin table listened in to their conversation. “Just like how my father allegedly hoodwinked my mother into marrying him?” She effortlessly returned his sarcasm. The intonation of her voice made the statement so ludicrous-sounding, all watching burst into laughter. Abraxas realized it was at his expense and his pale skin flushed a molten crimson as his taunting backfired on himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She beat you with that one, Malfoy!” another Slytherin boy sniggered, clapping Abraxas on the back good-naturedly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oi, what’d you say your name was?” an older Slytherin called from down the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Natalie’s eyes widened at the amount of attention she was suddenly being given by Slytherin house. It had just been a simple remark. Her gray eyes appeared colorless against the rosy blush that rose to her face. She had been at Hogwarts for barely an hour and already people wanted to know her name. She wasn’t sure if she should be proud, or terrified.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Natalie Borealis,” she replied in a low voice, and someone had to repeat it for the asker to hear it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Play Quidditch at all? Do any of you young ones play Quidditch?” the same boy then questioned, eliciting groans up and down the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop </span>
  <em>
    <span>recruiting</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Crockett! They’re babies!” someone complained, and the older boy named Crockett looked angry at this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m captain of the team this year and if you’ve got a problem with me looking to replace last year’s graduating class, you can bring it up with Professor Slughorn!” he declared with a scowl. “And besides, first years are allowed to try out if they’ve got permission from their parents.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When I’m headmaster, I’ll ban firsties from playing,” a Slytherin boy with a silver “P” badge shining proudly on his robes proclaimed. “Remember what happened to Tyrell Hooper?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re never going to be headmaster, you buffoon,” Crockett barked a laugh, which was echoed by several others. “And Hooper was a blithering idiot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By now, Natalie’s eyes bounced back and forth around the table, trying to keep track of who was speaking and who seemed to be friends with whom. Her fellow first years did the same. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite the insults and laughter at the expense of others, Slytherin house seemed like a tight-knit group of students who, while taking shots at each other when together, would have each other’s backs no matter what. She was eager to immerse herself into this brotherhood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The attention of the table wavered as dessert vanished and members began departing the Great Hall. Natalie Borealis rose to follow them, but found herself stopped by a hand on her shoulder. She glanced back to spy her like-featured cousin glaring at her, his face a mask. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” she asked him, and though it was not meant to be rude, he took it as such.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Real polite to your family, aren’t you,” he sneered, then gestured for her to follow him. She grudgingly did so, walking beside him within the crowd of Slytherins into the depths of the castle. “I suppose you get that from your father. . . it’s to be expected.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or it’s from the other side, because you’re certainly no more polite than I am,” she argued, wondering where her cheek was coming from. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, I’ve got it bad enough having a blood-traitor as a cousin here at school with me,” Abraxas’ tone dropped as they approached the dungeons. “I don’t need you sassing me in front of everyone at dinner, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, okay,” she mumbled. She couldn’t figure out his attitude towards her. Did he hate her? Was he choosing to tolerate her? Did he pity her?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So don’t do it, do we have a deal?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure,” she said, wondering if he heard the laced sarcasm within her words. Natalie wasn’t certain what this deal entirely consisted of, but if it meant he would not bother her in front of everyone at dinner, she would not attempt to argue the terms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excellent,” Abraxas muttered, and vanished within the crowd of Slytherins streaming into the common room. Natalie, bewildered, followed them in. She briefly gaped with awe at the luxurious, enigmatic Slytherin common room before falling into step with the other first years girls her age and searching for their dormitory. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Natalie was rooming with Quinn Bulstrode, Melania Crouch, and Pamela Selwyn, the three girls she had sat with at dinner earlier. Now, they properly introduced themselves to each other. Natalie did not miss the wrinkling noses in response to her last name. She chose to ignore this, opting instead, to select the bed closest to the glass which peered out into the murky green depths of the Black Lake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she stared into the swirling waters, she was overcome with an exhilarating feeling that the next seven years were going to be nothing short of magical. </span>
