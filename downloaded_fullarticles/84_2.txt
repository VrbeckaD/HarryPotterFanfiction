  <em> “Aurors, Get down!” </em>
</p><p>A loud explosion rattled a small building that lay center of England's most crime-filled city, blue light shattering windows and its neighborhood resonating with an echoing <em>boom</em>.</p><p>Two parties dueled for some time, throwing spells back and forth to no avail, most of them missing their target and ricocheting off walls in a destructive manner.</p><p>“Fuck!” The head of the Black family shouted, ducking the beam of red light aimed in his direction.</p><p>Rolling himself behind a tall desk, the man couldn't help but regret rushing to this rickety shop without James. It was the day after Yule and his friend was at home with his family - what was left of it anyway - having dinner while his son was home from Hogwarts. Sirius was sure that this lead would be another bust, a criminals intel was never trustworthy and they had received plenty of false leads before. But, as he dodged another curse heading for his exposed side, he couldn't help but inwardly curse his luck.</p><p>Crouching, wand held firmly in his right hand, he surveyed his surroundings. The place was certainly fitting for an illicit potions dealer, though he admitted that it must have seen better days.</p><p>The stale air matched the old wooden flooring and peeling wallpaper, not that there was much left of it of course, the last explosion blew a good chunk of the walls to bits. Broken windows left the floor scattered with bits of glass and splintered wood. Sirius honestly worried about how sturdy the foundation of the place was now, considering the circumstances.</p><p>The room now stood silent, dust quickly settling down the atmosphere. Glancing to his right, he eyed another auror - Kingsley Shacklebolt - who now hid behind a fallen table, nursing an injury to his wrist. Said auror met his eyes, nodding behind him at something out of Sirius’ sight. One of the assailants then. He had long ago put together that there must be more than one, offending spells coming from separate locations led Sirius to suspect that there must be at least two.</p><p>The clinking of shattered glass brought him out of his thoughts and he blindly cast a stunning spell in its general direction, by the answering thump, he had hit his target. He inwardly cheered.</p><p>Sirius waited.</p><p>Surely the other would act out in defense of their fallen ally? Or perhaps they would at least pull their fallen’s unconscious body out of the aurors’ reach? Several moments passed, yet not a sound was heard, no acts of revenge or rescue were made. Sirius began to wonder if their pursued had escaped without his notice. Furrowing his eyebrows, he strained his ears for any giving sound and just as he was about to peak over the busted desktop he heard it. A barely audible whisper, it was rushed and he couldn’t make out the words, but it came from behind the wall in next to the stairway to his left.</p><p>“Shit” Sirius cursed in his head</p><p>The stairway was just on his left, he barely had coverage from as he just confirmed, two more assailants. He was surprised they hadn't seen him by now. The auror knew that he needed to quickly move to the other side of the desk without drawing any attention to himself.</p><p>Turning towards Kingsley, he signaled their location and in a swiping motion the plan to move to more coverage. The auror nodded, wincing in pain as he shifted to the side and Sirius wanted to groan. Their odds weren’t looking as well as he had hoped.</p><p>Sirius set his hands on the dirty floor to support himself and began to carefully crawl to the other side of the structure. He winced as his knuckles pressed harshly against a shard of glass, rendering his wand hand bloody. He waited one moment, then two and pushed his body to the other side, letting his back rest heavily against the desk he cringed as the movement caused glass phials to fall off the tabletop. The sound of them shattering seemed to echo throughout the quiet room, and lightning quick, a bright flash hurdled past him, obliterating the already crumbling wall across from him instead. Quickly peeking his head over his cover he aimed and shot a blasting curse at the wall his attacker hid behind, he ducked back just in time to see a raven-haired figure jump out of the way of the falling debris.</p><p>Sirius froze. There was only one man behind that wall, where was the other?</p><p>
  <em> “Reducto!” </em>
</p><p>The quiet incantation was Sirius’ only warning before the curse was flying towards him, he used the split second before the curse hit to cast a wordless ‘ protego ’ in hopes that it would be enough. The spell obliterated his shield on impact and left Sirius flying backward, wand forced from his grip, he distantly heard it clink onto the wood floor. He landed heavily on his back, knocking his head on the floor afterward yet it's blow still had him groaning out in pain. His own voice sounded distant to him over the ringing of his ears.</p><p>He heard the voice of his companion sound out with a disarming spell and he forced open his eyes that he didn’t realize he closed to see him dueling with their assailant. The man was tall, with greying hair and muggle clothing - an odd sight in a place like this.</p><p>Pulling his eyes from the criminal’s direction, he surveyed the ground for his wand as he forced himself off the ground, wincing in pain as he did so. Seeing that his wand had rolled into some odd liquid, he scrunched his nose and fetched it from the ground and hurriedly wiped it on his robes.</p><p>“The other one Black!”</p><p>Whipping his head up he stared past the dueling forms to see the raven haired man - no - boy passing through a void in the wall, making his escape. He examined the boy through what used to be a window as he ran past. Shiny black curls that were swept back from the wind, an angular jaw, high cheekbones, and hooded eyes - the sight made Sirius’ stomach lurch with an odd sense of familiarity.</p><p>Shaking himself out of his stupor, he stumbled after him, absentmindedly dodging a curse heading towards him, likely meant to shake him off the boy’s path. Emerging from the crevice in the walls he ran down the cobblestone street just in time to see the boy turn a corner. Wincing at a pain in his side, he glanced down, slightly shocked to see his abdomen soaked red, the stain spreading further by the second.</p><p>Clutching his stomach, Sirius turned the corner and skidded to a halt to see the boy facing him at a dead end, behind him a tall apartment building with small children playing outside.</p><p>They met each other's eyes.</p><p>“Looks like you break the Statute of Secrecy or let me go, your choice,” The boy spoke, his voice was light and casual despite the cold expression painted on his face.</p><p>The boy’s arms were loose and at his sides, a wand being twirled between his bony fingers, face expectant. And those emerald eyes, they were unmistakably one of a kind. The contrast from those eyes to the pale skin and midnight-black hair was astonishing, and maybe he was reaching, but he had only ever seen such a mix in one person.</p><p>Harry.</p><p>“Well?” The boy prompted, seemingly growing impatient with Sirius’ lack of response.</p><p>Said man’s mouth opened and closed, overcome with shock and unable to settle on words.</p><p>“Are aurors really so… slow? Or just plain incompetent?” The boy asked mockingly, “I wonder if I just, walked right past, would you continue gaping like a scruffy fish out of water?” He took a step forward, testing the wordless man almost recklessly.</p><p>Sirius couldn’t help but find amusement in the dry attitude.</p><p>“I… you just look a bit like someone I used to know.” The man finally explained, attempting to gain his bearing and stop embarrassing himself senselessly.</p><p>The boy’s lips tilted downwards.</p><p>“Ah, perhaps it's both then. Well, what's your choice?” He asked, ignoring Sirius’ reply.</p><p>Sirius’ mind blanked.</p><p>“About what?” He asked warily</p><p>The boy sighed and crossed his arms.</p><p>“Do you want to duel in view of these innocent muggles or let me pass?” He asked, pronouncing each word slowly as if speaking to a child.</p><p>The auror felt heat creep up his neck.</p><p>Sirius shook his head and stepped towards him, only resulting in the boy taking a step back.</p><p>“I don't want to duel you.” Sirius told him, speaking truthfully.</p><p>The green-eyed boy raised his eyebrows in surprise.</p><p>“You… I mean, how old are you?” Sirius stumbled over his words, the boy’s heavy gaze throwing him off.</p><p>The boy shifted, and leaned his weight on one side.</p><p>“Certainly too young for the likes of you. Sorry to disappoint.” He replied with the slightest of hesitation.</p><p>Sirius’ stomach dropped.</p><p>“ No! <em>No,</em> not - that's not why I wanted to know!” He stuttered, panicked over the thought of being perceived as some old pervert.</p><p>The boy seemed amused, a coy smile playing on his lips.</p><p>“What? Don't you think I'm pretty?” He pouted playfully, jutting out his lower lip, bright eyes downcast.</p><p>Sirius stuttered more and held his hands in front of him, unsure what to do.</p><p>“That's not what I mean, it's just - I'm old. And not, how do I explain this.. You look like my godson who went missing as a child. My name is Sirius, Sirius Black.” The auror finally got out, hoping that the boy could even make any sense out of the words.</p><p>The boy's face went blank again. Gone were the playful demeanor and the teasing smiles, instead brash coldness replacing it.</p><p>Before Sirius could blink the boy whipped his arm up and sharply swished his wand in a spell, aiming directly towards the aurors’ face. And without the chance to move even an inch, the spell forcefully collided with his head, knocking him down onto the stone pavement.</p><p>Any attempt he made to get up or defend himself were made useless when his body refused to answer his commands. Every inch of him tingled and no amount of will would shatter the tight binding of his every muscle. Even his attempts to open his mouth to speak were without result. Sirius knew the curse, of course - petrificus totalus - it wasn’t necessarily dark, but it effects could be potentially lethal. Overpowering the spell could cause permanent paralyzation, and Sirius only hoped that the boy had the mind, or the mercy, to not do so. It was then that his mind decided to remind him where exactly the boy had been running from and what his part may have been in Sirius’ investigation. Reasons why he obviously shouldn't have so easily let his guard down around him. Sirius wanted to hit himself. Repeatedly.</p><p>Suddenly the boy came within his view, standing directly above him, looking down at him with that horribly expressionless face and those glowing, green eyes.</p><p>“I'm not your godson, so please forget such ridiculous ideas. Attempting to arrest me will only result in further failure and humiliation, so rid yourself of those silly notions as well.”</p><p>And with those two, harsh sentences, the boy stepped over him and disappeared from his sight, light retreating steps distantly registering in his mind.</p><p>Sirius wanted to scream or sigh at the very least. How could he be so stupid?</p><p>It felt like centuries before an auror found him, but was really only an hour. The playing children had long ago run off upon seeing him laying, bloodied on the ground. He was reminded of just what kind of town this was when said kids did not return with help.</p><p>His body icy from the cold weather and practically delirious from blood loss, Sirius repeated the previous events over and over again in his mind -searching for any viable evidence that that boy could really be Harry. He looked around the right age, and despite his small figure, his face looked quite mature. And those eyes. He didn't remember them being so… expressive when he was a baby. They had been bright, and happy as a little boy. Just a shade deeper than Lily's. But these eyes... they were certainly bright - practically glowing - but no longer were they so happy, nor innocent. They were eyes of a man who had suffered. Though Sirius hoped, that in his barely conscious state, he was just seeing things.</p><p>
  <em>What a day.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>James sprinted past the stark white walls of St. Mungos. It was only minutes ago that he received a patronus from an auror, informing him that his best friend had been hospitalized after a confrontation with their supposed illegal potions dealer. The patronus was brief in its wording, only mentioning where Sirius was and why, there was absolutely no word of his condition.</p><p>“Sirius!” James called out his name as he busted through the double doors of his room, eyes frantically searching for his friend.</p><p>There! Against the left wall on one of the blindingly white beds lay his scruffy friend looking worse for the wear, but thankfully still alive.</p><p>“What's with you? Looking like your best mate landed himself in the infirmary  - oh wait!.” Sirius japed, a forced smile painting his face.</p><p>James sighed in relief, shaking his head he moved to stand at the man's bedside.</p><p>“You joke like a forty-year-old, post divorcee father in suburbia.” He retorted, a shaky grin growing on his face.</p><p>“Well at least I don't dress like one.” Sirius threw back, glancing him up and down with disgust.</p><p>Quiet chuckles escaped the two without permission.</p><p>James sat on the edge of the injured man's cot, warily shoving a leg but of his way. Seeing no sign of discomfort on Sirius’ face, he made himself comfortable.</p><p>“You're okay?” He asked</p><p>Sirius nodded.</p><p>“Yup. Healers got me all stitched up.” The man gestured to his seemingly healthy state.</p><p>“You're not getting off this one without an explanation, mate.” James told him when an uncomfortable silence grew.</p><p>Sirius shifted and glanced down, his eyebrows furrowed. James took this time to examine how beat the man looked, more mentally it seemed than anything. Dark bags were under his eyes that James knew weren't there the day before. His cheeks pale, and his eyes seemed… lost.</p><p>“I didn't hear anything about casualties, did we lose one of ours?” James tried again, his voice softer this time.</p><p>Sirius shook his head and opened his mouth to speak, only to close it again.</p><p>“No one died. I just… saw someone. I-I don't know how to say this..” Sirius drifted off, finally gaining the courage to meet the other's eyes.</p><p>James bit his cheek in anticipation, if only he could hear the thoughts that the other couldn't seem to articulate.</p><p>“I-I saw him James.. I saw Harry,” Sirius told him with some struggle.</p><p>James froze. His body tensed, his back straightened, his jaw clenched.</p><p>“Don’t.” He said, turning away from the man beside him, “Just…<em>don’t.</em>”</p><p>Sirius leaned forward, hand reaching out into empty air, “James, I mean it! I really saw him, I really saw-”</p><p>“Just stop!” James shouted, turning back to him, confliction written over his face.</p><p>James stood, debating walking right out the door.</p><p>Sirius sat up on the small bed, letting his legs hang off the edge as James had done before. He glanced down at the tile floor about to stand before seemingly thinking better of it and staying seated, clenching the stiff sheets under his hands.</p><p>“James. I wouldn't bring this up if I wasn't positive. You know this. I wouldn't put you through that again.” Sirius’ voice was quiet now and his eyes did not leave the marble tile.</p><p>Despite his will, James’ eyes stayed on the other man, his eyebrows further furrowing upon seeing the honesty and resignation on his face.</p><p>James knew that Sirius’ words were honest, at least in the other man's eyes, and yet he couldn't believe them. He couldn't let himself believe them. He couldn't let the hopelessness and pain grasp him once again as they always did when Harry was in his thoughts. He couldn't let the guilt eat him away until there was none of him left. <em>Again.</em></p><p>“Don't do this to me,” James begged, his voice barely audible.</p><p>Sirius looked up, a frown deeply set in his face.</p><p>“I'm not doing anything to you, Prongs. We need to discuss this, I found Harry .”</p><p>James shook his head in denial, “It's not him, Sirius. It was never him.”</p><p>James reached up under his glasses and rubbed harshly at his eyes, breathing deeply.</p><p>Sirius stood.</p><p>“It was him. It had to be. He had Lily's eyes. Harry’s eyes! His hair, his face, his nose, everything matched! And when I told him who I was, who he looked like, he got all.. defensive and ran off!” Sirius ranted, absentmindedly touching his forehead, “Not before cursing me a nasty one though.” He added.</p><p>James’ hands dropped.</p><p>“He cursed you?”</p><p>“He… yeah, he did.” Sirius mumbled</p><p>“Care to elaborate?” James asked after a moment's pause.</p><p>Sirius looked hesitant, “Like I said, I told him that he looked like Harry and he just flipped. Threw me the paralyzing curse before I could blink, told me that he's not who I thought and left.”</p><p>James crossed his arms, “He said that he's <em>not</em> Harry.” He said slowly and clearly.</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes.</p><p>“He was lying.” He said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, “Why else would he react in such a way? I’ve had some time to think about this, Prongs, I’ve thought over everything and you know that I wouldn’t bring it up if I wasn't sure.” Sirius pleaded.</p><p>James began to pace, “You're certain that there is a real possibility?” He questioned.</p><p>“It has to be,” Sirius told him, dropping himself back onto the bed.</p><p>James chewed on his lip, “Lily cannot find out. I refuse to put her through this again.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Sirius picked at a loose thread on the sheets, “You know she hates when things are kept from her.”</p><p>“It's necessary,” James told him before his next step faltered.</p><p>James turned to the sitting man, “Where did you say you found this kid again?”</p><p>“I didn’t..” Sirius replied, pressing his lips together.</p><p>James put two and two together.</p><p>“He was involved in the investigation? Are you <em>kidding</em> me, Sirius?” James exclaimed, raking his hands through his hair.</p><p>Sirius shook his head violently, “He wasn’t involved okay? He just happened to be there when we busted the shop!”</p><p>“At the scene of a crime!” James shouted back, tired of the other man’s absurd way of thinking.</p><p>“Does it matter?” Sirius retorted, rolling his eyes.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“It’s not important!” Sirius raised his voice, throwing his hands up in the air in exasperation.</p><p>“The fact that the boy whom you say is Harry just so happens to be a suspect in our investigation who also cursed a ministry official is very important!” James exclaimed, “You know what? I can’t do this. This boy is at the very least a criminal, and we won’t be finding him for any reason other than for questioning.”</p><p>“But James!”</p><p>“This is <em>final,</em> Sirius!” James told him, turning his back and stalking to the door, “And don't even think of leaving this hospital until you get a seal of approval from the healer!” He yelled behind him.</p>
