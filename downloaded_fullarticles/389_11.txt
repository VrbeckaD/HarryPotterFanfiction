    <p>“What could we possibly use this for?” Harry muttered under his breath, his attention having obviously waned.  </p><p>It was nearing the end of November in their sixth year at Hogwarts and Harry was having a harder and harder time focusing on the mundane realities of classes when there was Voldemort out in the world. How was he to sit here and pretend like any of this actually mattered? How was he supposed to focus on Professor Vector at the front of the class giving an in depth study of the Agrippan method of finding the strengths and weaknesses in a person when they could all be thrust into a wizarding war at any moment?</p><p>“Arithmancy is actually quite useful,” Hermione retorted in a hushed tone that suggested condemnation rather than observation. Harry rolled his eyes good naturedly at his friend before going back to his parchment and scribbling absently. He had to at least seem busy, or Professor Vector would be on him immediately. While she may not openly favor certain students like a certain greasy git, she could still be unpleasant if crossed.</p><p>His gaze stole to the left of the room where a pale and peaked looking Draco Malfoy sat, flanked by his trusty goons Goyle and Crabbe. Harry had dedicated this entire year to following that ferret-face; ever since he’d overheard him at <em>Borgin and Burkes</em> demanding a certain item be fixed. As if feeling he were being watched, Draco glanced over his right shoulder and scowled at Harry. </p><p>“Mister Malfoy, is there something fascinating at the back of the room?” Professor Vector said lightly, her light eyes flinty as she drew over to the boy.</p><p>“No, Professor,” Draco replied through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Then I suggest you face the front,” Professor Vector replied, strolling through the rows of students and continuing her lesson, passionately explaining that one could use an individual’s birthday to derive their character number. Hermione couldn’t help but feel a small smirk of approval slip over her features before it was gone again. Draco Malfoy deserved everything he got as far as she was concerned.</p><p>Hermione glanced to the other side of her where Ron was trying – and failing – to remain awake. He balanced his jaw on his fist, his eyes dropping a moment before shuttering awake. She sighed deeply, her eyes taking in his pale and freckled face.</p><p>“Lavender keeping you up late?” she whispered tightly, trying her best not to seem jealous. Even though she was – desperately jealous in fact – not that he’d even realized. He was too enamored with the silly chit to even notice that Hermione had grown colder to him, more reserved. </p><p>“She’s bloody exhausting,” Ron admitted quietly as Professor Vector pointed to something on the board. “She wants us to go to that <em>Puddifoot </em>tea shop for a date next Hogsmeade weekend. Does she think I’m made of galleons?”</p><p>Hermione was about to reply when Professor Vector suddenly clapped her hands for their attention – a tactic she’d used since they were in first year – it didn’t matter that they were overover seven and well into their sixth year. But Hermione liked her – unlike Trelawney, Septima Vector was a smart, encouraging teacher. She always answered Hermione’s questions with patience and encouraged the girl to speak up in the class when she knew the answer.</p><p> As a result, Hermione found she didn’t need to prove herself as much – her hand raised often, but she also let the other students have a chance. Unlike in Snape’s Defense class where she felt so continually downtrodden that she thrust her hand into the air every time he breathed the hint of a question.</p><p>“<em>Students</em>,” Professor Vector said in that light Irish lilt of hers. “Using the methods I have just gone through, you will calculate your Character number, your Heart Number and your Social number. When you have done so you will find the traits that correspond to those numbers. For your homework you will write two feet of parchment on your findings and the parallels you see with your own life. If you disagree with your findings- explain why. But be compelling for the numbers are rarely wrong.”</p><p>With that she gave a small smile and went to her desk, starting to write something into her large ledger hurriedly. There was a small din in the classroom as the students began to write and calculate their scores. Harry wrote slowly, for math had never been his strong suit, irritated that Hermione seemed to be sailing by.</p><p>“What’s a heart number?” Ron mumbled irritably, obviously having been startled by Vector’s loud talking.</p><p>“Were you even listening?” Hermione said with a groan as she pulled out her parchment. “The Heart number is your inner life. Your Character number is your general personality. Your Social is your outer personality.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t my character and my social be the same?” Ron challenged. “I’m the same on the inside as out.”</p><p>Hermione said nothing, choosing to divert her attention back to the board where she quickly calculated that for today’s lesson she was a character of 4, a heart of 4 and a social of 9. She smiled at this concrete result, having always favored this class because unlike Trelawney’s simpering account of how to fortell the future, this was a scientific, measurable way of doing it.  She glanced over at the textbook, reading:</p><p>
  <em>Like a table that rests solidly on four legs, four indicates stability and firmness. Fours enjoy hard work. They are practical, reliable and down to earth; they prefer logic and reason to flights of fancy. They are good at organization and getting things done. Like the cycle of the four seasons, they are also predictable. They can be stubborn, suspicious, overly practical and prone to angry outbursts. The conflicts possible in "two" are doubled in four.</em>
</p><p>Hermione couldn’t help but smile at that – she had to admit that this was pretty accurate! She glanced to her other number – a nine- and looked back to the textbook.</p><p>
  <em>Represents completion and achievement to the fullest degree (as it is the complete number, three, expressed three times). Nines dedicate themselves to service, often as teachers, scientists, and humanitarians. Strongly determined, they work tirelessly and are an inspiration to others. However, they can also be arrogant and conceited when things don't go their way.</em>
</p><p>While Hermione could agree that she saw a large part of herself in this – hadn’t she always wanted to dedicate herself to humanitarian work after Hogwarts? – she was surprised by the arrogant piece. Was she arrogant? Conceited? No, that sounded like someone else entirely.</p><p>She glanced over to Malfoy, seeing him scribble slowly. She wondered if he was even doing the work; she’d heard him complaining of Dumbledore earlier, saying that the man wasn’t fit to teach. No, Hermione Granger wasn’t arrogant – but Draco Malfoy sure was.</p><p> Soon the bell rung, indicating the end of the class. Ron was grumbling about the homework and Harry was looking distractedly at Draco before pulling his books into his arms. Hermione shot him a concerned look, suddenly viewing the fatigue on her friend’s face.</p><p>“You alright Harry?” she asked gently touching his shoulder. He gave her a warm smile before nodding.</p><p>“Just tired is all.”</p><p>“More lessons with Dumbledore?” Hermione observed. The boy nodded, about to say more when a snide voice sounded out from behind them.</p><p>“Enjoy staring at me, Potty?” Draco sneered as Goyle and Crabbe gave low chuckles of approval at their gang leader.</p><p>“Not staring,” Harry replied evenly for years of Draco’s mockery had left him indifferent. “Just watching.”</p><p>“A voyeur then?” Draco replied with a sharp rasp of a laugh. “Best trying your hand at <em>cottaging </em>then, Potter. I’m not interested.”</p><p>With that, the three Slytherin’s walked off laughing darkly to one another and leaving the Hermione and the boys red faced with embarrassment and anger.</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell him off, Harry?” Ron demanded, irritated at his friend’s lack of reply.</p><p>“I don’t have time for detention,” Harry replied with a shrug of his shoulders. “Best not to start in with Malfoy.”</p><p>To Hermione he suddenly looked a decade older than seventeen, his green eyes stark against the blur-grey of his under eye bags. She wondered if she should brew him something to help him sleep. Although, she had to admit, Harry was doing better at Potions than even she was this year. Something that bothered her greatly, though she’d never admit it.</p><p>“C’mon,” Hermione said as she observed the time and gathered her books into her arms. “We have defense next and we’d best hurry because I heard Snape’s in a right foul mood today.”</p><p> ****************</p><p>“<em>Here he comes</em>,” whispered an anxious voice as the classroom door slammed behind him. Snape swept into the Defense Classroom, looking more and more like an overgrown bat than usual with his robes billowing dramatically behind him as he walked.</p><p>His left leg ached him and he was dying for some rest. Of course, this was not to be. Instead he glided as smoothly as he could manage over to the projector. The students faced the front of the class, not wishing to make eye contact with the man behind them.</p><p>The rumor at lunch was that he had screamed at a fourth year this morning for not paying attention in class and the boy had been so upset he’d vomited all over the floor in fear.</p><p>Of course this wasn’t close to what happened. The boy hadn’t been watching where he was going when attempting the hex reflection and backed right into the professor, distracted by another student. He’d knocked his foot quite harshly into the Professor’s left leg, re-opening a healing wound and causing Snape to give a sharp yelp of pain as he pulled back like a wounded animal.</p><p>This of course turned into a shout that the idiotic boy needed to watch where he was stepping. Out of fear for suffering the wrath of Severus Snape, the boy had hiccups the rest of class until Snape ordered him out, citing that he didn’t want to sit through the ‘cacophony of noise’  the boy was making.  Not before taking fifty house points of course.</p><p>The only benefit came from the false rumors that had run rampant about the situation, was that it had resulted in all classes to be quiet and well behaved.  No whispering, no note passing. This class of sixth years was no different. They sat in their seats, looking ahead and waiting for the lesson to start. The class was silent under his watchful gaze and he tapped the projector firmly.</p><p>“We will be studying wandless hexes,” Snape said quietly, his entire body screaming for reprieve, his left leg throbbing. “A bit of background before we begin- wandless magic can be quite volatile and difficult to perform, so unlike in potions, when I tell you to pay attention in these lessons you will <em>do so</em>.”</p><p>He felt as the students tensed up every moment he swept stiffly through the rows. It was almost fun to see the way they grew anxious around him. He glanced over to the trio he despised the most. Weasley looked ready to faint, Potter was fixing him with an unreadable expression and Granger was hurriedly taking notes like the desperate student she was. He could barely contain his irritation every time the three of them arrived.</p><p>“There will be no giggling or distracting one another, am I clear?” He didn’t wait for a response. “Learning this skill may one day save your life. So instead of daydreaming about Quidditch I suggest you pay attention.”</p><p>At this he went into a long background of wordless spells, indicating that there would be much preparation before they actually got to do it. This caused Harry and Ron great consternation as they had already been working on such a thing when they began Dumbledore’s Army. Hermione however was excited to learn more about it.</p><p>“You will copy the following notes from the board,” Snape said, tapping the projector off and using his wand to pull a chalkboard to the forefront of the classroom. “And for your assignment you will create a wandless spell of your own creation. Be creative, but for Merlin’s sake don’t be dunderheads and try them outside of this classroom.”</p><p>Snape sat back at his desk, watching as twenty heads bent over their desks, writing quickly; the only sound in the room the echo of their quills scratching against the parchment. It was a sound that Severus normally loved, but today it was irritating him to no end. Everything was causing him irritation and he attributed that to the extreme pain he was in today.</p><p>The Dark Lord had been most unimpressed with the delivery of news the previous night.</p><p>
  <em>Severus had arrived at Malfoy Manor, surprised to see Voldemort sitting by himself at the end of the long table. Nagini was nowhere to be seen and for some reason, this made Snape’s blood run cold. This was to be punishment – something Severus was rarely involved in. He was always a favored Death Eater, and </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“My Lord.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Severus,” Voldemort had said, glancing at the bowing man before indicating the tall man should take a seat beside him. He did so, not surprised at all when he felt himself being magically bound to the chair. He tried not to look upset, instead giving Voldemort a confused look. The Dark Lord often enjoyed punishing Severus with the very spells he had created and he wondered what he may be in for this evening. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You are one of my most loyal followers Severus,” Voldemort had said with what he assumed was a grin. “But your information as of late has been, shall we say, less than useful.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“My Lord?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You claimed there would be no way to break into the castle,” Voldemort’s ruby eyes had grown harder then. “Yet Draco tells me of a way. A way that a powerful wizard such as yourself should have come to me with years ago.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What way, My Lord?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“That is between the boy and I… for now,” Voldemort had teased.  “You will know soon enough.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I think I should be made aware,” Severus had said with a confidence he hadn’t possessed at that moment. “How else will I be able to assist?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Unfortunately the false confidence he had been trying to exude was deemed arrogance and too soon Voldemort had stood, curling a finger and beckoning Nagini toward them. Snape cast a sidelong glance at the slithering beast approaching from the shadows before his attention was drawn back to Voldemort. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You seem to forget on whose generosity you continue to thrive,” Voldemort had said in a voice that reminded Snape of drying leaves. “I shall leave you a reminder.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With that Nagini had lunged her great head and sunk her sharp fangs into Severus’ lower left. He could feel as the sharp teeth pierced the fabric of his trousers before sliding with a heavy sting into the meat of his left calf. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Within seconds the poison did its trick, relieving Snape of all and all power over his body. He groaned in pain, trying his best to keep his wits about him.  His head began to sink into his chest, but not before Voldemort’s reptilian face swam into view inches from Snape’s head. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You would be wise to recall that I am never to be questioned,” Voldemort whispered before he stopped the poison from spreading.  Immediately Snape could feel his body rejuvenating, his blood pumping furiously and taking out the toxins. Despite the anger he had for the man, Snape was so thankful for the release of pain he could sob. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I give pain, but I also take it away,” Voldemort had said, releasing the tall professor from his binding spell. “Remember that.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I will. Thank you, my Lord,” Snape had said through gritted teeth before disapparating.  </em>
</p><p>However Snape’s left calf still burned and ached and throbbed. It would for several days if his estimation was correct. Despite a very powerful pain relieving potion, he knew that the two deep holes would remain; forever reminding him of what happened when the Dark Lord was displeased.</p><p>Snape felt his calf throb as if it were happening all over again.  None of the students were looking to him and so he gently touched the wrapping around his left leg through his trousers. He winced, feeling as the wound stung against the gentle intrusion. He pulled his hand back sharply, idly thinking about a salve that would work to dull the pain.</p><p>At that moment he felt a pair of dark eyes on him and he snapped his gaze up to see the insufferable know-it-all of Gryffindor fixing him with a look of concern. He felt the bile rise in the back of his throat this sycophantic gesture. How long had she been watching him?</p><p>“What are you staring at, Granger?” he demanded, startling her. He could see her back hunch, her eyes suddenly fixed upon her parchment. Her hair fell over her shoulder and he knew the tactic well – trying to hide behind it.</p><p>“Nothing sir,” she offered quietly as she wrote hurriedly.</p><p>“Are you sure?” he said cruelly from his desk. “Are you struggling with the devising of a <em>creative </em>wandless spell, Miss Granger? I know it must be a true <em>challenge</em> for you given that you can’t simply regurgitate your answer from a textbook.”</p><p>There was the gentle snicker from the Slytherin section of the classroom and Hermione ducked her head further, her entire face going red. Harry shot Snape a dark look that the professor wasn’t moved by in the slightest.</p><p>“What’s your problem?” Ron demanded, coming to Hermione’s defense and causing her to shoot him a small inscrutable look. “She didn’t even say anything.”</p><p>“Ten points from Gryffindor,” Snape bit back, his irritation evident. “For your <em>disrespect</em>, Mister Weasley.”</p><p>Ron looked like he was about to say something more when Hermione gripped his arm tightly, her eyes shooting him a pleading look. Ron’s body deflated and he angrily went back to his assignment.  Hermione did the same, a strange look on her face.</p><p>Snape gave the Granger girl one last sneer before going back to his parchment. The last thing he needed was Hermione bloody Granger sticking her annoying nose in where it didn’t belong. It was if everything were a project for her to be graded on – he still recalled the disastrous S.P.E.W. formation and he felt his lip curl in disdain. She was far too muggle than witch sometimes.</p><p>His eyes glanced over to her wayward accomplice then, Potter and his green eyes. Snape winced as those eyes flitted through his memory. Potter looked distracted today, his writing lazy and unhurried. He seemed to be staring quite intently at the back of Draco’s head.</p><p>“Pay attention to your assignment, Potter.”</p><p>Harry started, glancing up to Snape at the head of the class and trying to hold back a disdainful glare.</p><p>The class worked on in silence for the rest of the hour and Snape found himself eagerly counting down the minutes. He would skip dinner in the Great Hall tonight – have dinner sent to his chambers, a glass of elf-made wine and then an early night. He felt the heavy weight of his tired eyes even more pronounced then and as the bell clanged he didn’t even look up to dismiss them.</p><p>He was about to stand himself when there was a pecking sound at the large window to his right. A large barn owl was waiting for him on the window ledge, a scroll in its talons. He opened the window, his inky hair rustling as the cold November air hit his face. He took the scroll into his hand, shutting the window firmly after the bird. He opened the scroll, scanning the short message and sighing deeply.  </p><p>
  <em>Tonight. 9pm in my chambers.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>-Albus</em>
</p><p>Snape almost growled at that before crumpling the message and throwing it into the bin.</p><p>So much for having a lie in.</p><p>***************</p><p>Albus was already pacing inside when Severus arrived that evening, his focus on the thin man’s blackened hand. It made Severus wince every time he saw it. He wondered why the old man only glamoured it when he was outside the office. Surely it would make more sense to have it continually glamoured?</p><p>Or was he doing it to remind Snape of the situation that they were in? A visual reminder that time was running out?  If that were the case, he needn’t have bothered. Snape was aware of their dwindling time every moment he opened his eyes in the morning, both disappointed he was alive and relieved for he was doing right by Lily.</p><p>“Take a seat,” Albus said pointing to a chair. Normally Severus would have insisted on standing, but today was a particularly exhausting day and he fell into the plush armchair almost thankful for the invitation. He folded his hands on his lap politely, inclining his head in Albus’ direction, speaking languidly as if to belay the tension he felt everywhere in his body.</p><p>“You wished to see me, Headmaster.”</p><p>“I did,” Albus said with a pursing of his wrinkled lips. “As you yourself have attested to in previous meetings, the Dark Lord and his followers are moving forward in their plans for overtaking the castle. I would assume they’d put this plan into action by the end of summer at the latest?”</p><p>“That’s what I’ve gathered,” Severus answered truthfully.</p><p>“I worry that as the war draws near we are still mightily unprepared,” Albus said with a grimace. “Despite all the work and extra lessons we’ve put in with Harry, we still need to decide upon our next course of action.”</p><p>“Which is what, exactly?” Snape offered his eyes at half mast as he watched the man pace in the same office before him.</p><p>“We need to decide what will happen when I’m gone,” Albus continued, referring to the unbreakable vow. “You’ll have no other way of contacting Harry. He won’t trust you, should you need to kill me. In fact, no one will trust you. To everyone on the Light you’ll be a monster.”</p><p>“So quite similar to the opinions they have of me now,” Severus replied sardonically.  Albus continued on as if he hadn’t heard him. He wasn’t in the mood for the boy’s rather childish sulking behavior.</p><p>“When I’m gone you’ll need some way of maintaining contact with Harry. You’ll be at a disadvantage for keeping him safe of course because he’ll keep everything from you. But you know better than I that you’re his best chance at survival.”</p><p>Snape said nothing, continuing to watch the older man from behind cold, glittering eyes.</p><p>“However without the continual sharing of knowledge, the both of you shall be in a bind that could be avoided.  Obviously we cannot bring the boy into the fold, as we’ve established the Dark Lord can move within his mind with ease. It’s too dangerous for him to know anything of our plans.”</p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p>“He needs to think you a villain to get Voldemort’s entire trust,” Albus continued without pause. “You won’t be trusted by any of the staff once I’m gone, for they too are too vulnerable to the Dark Lord’s Legilimens ability.”</p><p>“Then what do you suggest, Albus?” Snape sighed heavily, wishing he were in his bed. His calf was throbbing. “A tracking spell for the boy?”</p><p>“No,” Albus frowned deeply.  “You <em>know</em> that won’t work, Severus. Tracking the boy won’t be enough – you need to know what his next moves will be. He needs to know what to expect <em>here</em>. Honestly Severus, I wonder why you’re making this harder on me than it needs to be.”</p><p>“Harder on <em>you</em>?” Snape snapped, his dark eyes fathomless. “And what do you suppose this has been like for me these past years, Albus? Working for both the Dark and the Light has not been a great joy in my life, I assure you.”</p><p>Albus paused, his light eyes suddenly locked on Snape’s face in a way that made Severus feel like he were a first-year being scolded.</p><p>“You made your choice Severus,” Albus said quietly.</p><p>Snape said nothing, not needing to be reminded of the oath he’d sworn;  his allegiance, his promise that he would protect the boy. The final thing he could do in Lily’s memory. But did the brat have to look so much like James? That same overly confident demeanor, the same strutting way of stride. But Lily’s eyes, he always remembered. Precious Lily’s green eyes that stared back at him from inside that arrogant face. Those eyes which reminded him daily why he was fighting like this.</p><p>“And so we still need a way of keeping information passing from Harry to you after I’m gone,” Albus continued, raising his blackened hand without thinking. “A way to keep close to the boy without rousing too much suspicion. A plan that we can enact as soon as possible, should Voldemort’s attack come earlier.”</p><p>Snape crossed his arms, unable to think of a reasonable way of doing so that wouldn’t have Voldmort’s suspicion roused. Even his keen mind couldn’t arrive at a logical conclusion and so he gave Albus an inscrutable look before wearily raising a palm in deference.</p><p>“And you’ve such a plan, Albus?”</p><p> Albus took a seat across from him, his face suddenly looking more haggard than Severus ever remembered.</p><p>“I have,” said Albus with a grim countenance. “And I’m sure you won’t like it.”</p>
