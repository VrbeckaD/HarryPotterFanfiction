    <p>Tony showed Steve and Bruce around the new Avenger’s Tower. Steve had come back to New York from his road trip early. Each person had their own floor. Tony and Bruce had the first floor, Steve the second, Clint and Natasha the third, and Thor the fourth. There was also a common room, a gym, a full library, and a swimming pool. The Avengers could live and train here.</p><p>That was the point.</p><p>Steve thought it was all kind of flashy. Then again, this was designed by a Stark. Only Steve longed for home and Bucky; that broken-down apartment in Brooklyn. Steve had wished that he died in the plane crash, he would be with Bucky now. What would his <em>new </em>soulmate think?</p><p>Yes, God or Fate decided to give him a new Soul Mate.</p><p><em> Darcy Rose Potter </em>was written under his collarbone opposite of Bucky’s name. A woman this time. Bucky and he had talked about bringing a woman into their relationship. Both of them still wanted women even though they had each other. They never could decide on a woman, they did share a few during the war.  Steve wondered if Bucky would have had her name too. If he was alive that is. Her name was written in a light gold opposite of Bucky’s light red. It was odd. When he awoke from the ice, Bucky’s name reverted back to its light color. When soulmates touch for the first time, their name darkens on the skin. It was the first phase of bonding. Steve and Bucky were going to fulfill their bond after the war.</p><p>Steve hoped never to meet this woman. Steve wouldn’t care for her at all. This little girl was probably just like any other child of this new era. A spoiled brat that didn’t know loss or sacrifice. That was all he found out in this shiny new world.</p><p>Fate had other plans for that day.</p><p>Thor’s soulmate Dr. Jane Foster was coming to work for Tony.  Tony was excited to meet the brilliant astrophysicist and fund her work. The only problem was Jane wanted her intern to work with her. Honestly, Jane didn’t need the intern. Tony’s A.I. could do everything that the intern did and Tony didn’t have to pay JARVIS. Jane would see that she didn’t need the intern.  </p><p>“<em> Sir Dr. Foster is in the lobby,” </em></p><p>“Thanks, JARVIS,” said Tony, “Come on let’s go meet Thor’s one and only,”</p><p>Down in the lobby, Jane and the intern were waiting for them. Jane was a tiny fairy-like woman. She had straight light brown hair with honey-colored eyes. She wore jeans and a plaid shirt opened to an undershirt with tennis shoes. The intern was short and curvy. Untamable curly black hair and emerald green eyes. She wore a red sweater, fingerless gloves, jeans, and boots. Squared frame glasses were perched on her upturned nose. Full red lips pulled into a smile at something Jane said.</p><p>Tony thought there was something familiar about the intern’s eyes, there was a sharp pain in his heart. A memory that needed to stay buried. Steve thought the intern was downright beautiful, reminding him of girls back in his day. Bruce was the only one that caught the haunted look behind those gem-like eyes.</p><p>This wasn’t supposed to happen yet. He supposed to be out on his road trip. Then he would be called to D.C., Peggy would talk to him and then introduce her. Guess fate had other plans for them. Darcy glanced at Steve, he looked as he did in the photos that Peggy had shown her. His eyes were different though, full of anger and hurt.</p><p>“Dr. Foster, welcome to Avenger’s Tower,” Tony announced.</p><p>“Hi, Mr. Stark. This is my assistant Darcy Potter.” Jane pointing and introducing her dark-haired intern.</p><p>“This is Dr. Bruce Banner, my one and only,” Tony boasted,“ That’s my dad’s favorite science project; Steve Rogers aka Captain America,”</p><p>Steve’s eyes widened. This was the girl fate choose for him. She was avoiding his gaze, she knew who he was. She probably thought herself lucky to have a famous soulmate. Steve swore under his breath. Darcy looked up to curse her Potter luck. Tony caught on to the looks.</p><p>“You know her Cap,” Tony asked.</p><p>“No,” Steve stated. His tone was hostile and his jaw was set.</p><p>“But my name is tattooed somewhere on your body. Just like your name is on mine,” said Darcy there was a slight accent to her voice.</p><p>Probably from living in London.</p><p>Tony gave Darcy a once over. “So… Cap has another soul mate. Wow. At least she’s easy on the eyes,”</p><p>Jane and Bruce glared at Tony. Jane was protective of Darcy, knowing that she had a hard life. Bruce thought it crass that an older man would look at a young girl in such a lustful way. Bruce wasn’t jealous by any means, he just thought his soulmate was an ass.</p><p>“My soulmate is dead. He died for his country. I don’t need a spoilt little girl to replace him,” Steve grounded out turning to leave.</p><p>Darcy clenched her fists in anger and counted to five. This man knew nothing about her or her past. Darcy had rescue herself and others multiple times. Molly, Yen, Arthur, and Remus tried their best to let her be a child. Then again she never was a child. Tom made sure of that when he murdered her parents. And Steve wasn’t the man she had heard about. Peggy painted this Prince Charming, now that has gone up in smoke. He was grieving so she shouldn’t hold that against him.</p><p>“And I don’t need a bitter man living in the past,” Darcy snapped without thinking. That wasn’t the thing to say.</p><p>“MAMA.”</p><p>A small child rushed towards Darcy, Darcy bent down to pick the boy up. The boy had dark brown hair and sapphire blue eyes. Steve thought he could pass as his and Bucky’s child. She placed him on her hip, whispering in his ear.</p><p>“Come on Teddy. Let’s wait for Aunt Jane outside,” Darcy announced.</p><p>Darcy turned with a child in her arms and walked away.  Steve felt a stab of jealousy at whoever the boy’s father was. Soulmates were supposed to wait for each other. That was how it was in the 40s. It seems that wasn’t the case anymore. Darcy couldn’t be more than twenty and the child looked about three. So she was a teenage mother. The father must have bailed like most of the men in this century. Steve went to the gym to hit some bags to forget.</p><p>“Look, Foster,” Tony stated after Steve and Darcy left. He didn’t like Darcy, she reminded him of someone he would rather forget. Someone that he didn’t want Bruce to find out about. “You don’t really need the intern. I have an A.I. that can do anything that the intern can do. Only better,” Tony boasted.</p><p>Jane arched an eyebrow. “Really. Can your fancy A.I. manhandle me into sleeping, eating, and showering on a daily basis,”</p><p>“Who needs that stuff when you can do science,”</p><p>“You haven’t looked in the mirror lately have you,” Jane pointed out.</p><p>Tony hadn’t bathed in the least three days, eaten any real food in two days, or slept in four days.</p><p>Tony glared at her.</p><p>“That doesn’t matter. Your intern still not working for my company. She can run along and find another freeloading gig. You don’t have to support the freeloader or her tick,”</p><p>SMACK</p><p>Tony’s head snapped back as Jane slapped him. Bruce would have stopped her, only Tony deserved the slap. He didn’t know the girl’s past and had no right to judge her.</p><p>“Look here Stark,” Jane seethed, “I won’t work for you unless I can bring in Darcy. She’s the one that supported us when we had nothing. She invested her own money into my work. Everyone thought I was crackpot for my theories. I could barely get funding. No one wanted to invest.  Not even you. Darcy believed in me when no else did. Now that I’m Thor’s wife and I was right, everyone wants to invest in my work. I’m not hurting for money. The only reason I wanted to work for you was to be close to Thor. Your A.I. might work for you, not me. Darcy knows how I work and how I like things. I’ll take my sister over S.I. any day of the week,”</p><p>Jane turned on her heel leaving a shocked Tony and amused Bruce. Jane got in the driver’s seat of the van. Teddy was in his car seat with book tape on. Darcy was leaning against the window off in her own world. Steve’s rejection hurt her, but she wouldn’t let the world know that. Darcy’s life with her aunt and uncle taught her to hold in her emotions. Jane also knew that Teddy really wasn’t her son, that Darcy was entrusted to raise the boy. That didn’t stop people from judging her for having a child that wasn’t her soulmates. Now her soulmate didn’t even want her.  That must be heartbreaking. Maybe Captain America would change his mind.</p><p>All was quiet at Darcy’s Brooklyn Townhouse. Jane was passed out in her room. Teddy was tucked into bed in the nursery. Darcy was in the living room, sitting by the fire. She was dressed in PJs with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders. Wild curls contained in a high ponytail, exposing the lightning bolt scar on her forehead. That was just one of many that littered her body.</p><p>Darcy was pissed at Steven Grant Rogers. She had been a soldier just like him. She had known loss, pain, suffering. Countless people had died because of her. And she gave her life just as Steve did. Just as Bucky did.</p>
