    <p align="justify">Everything is ready!</p><p align="justify">The tables is laid with the dark-red table cloth that Albus loves, the silverware is polished by the strength of hand, the cream white napkins are folded like small swans, and three ghost-white candles in the candelabrum does it as the cherry on top. Scorpius hasn't been able to sit still for more than five minutes all day from the bubbling excitement in his chest - Albus is coming home tonight! His job required that he stayed abroad for seven months to gain some 'foreign experience'. Yes, he visited him but the Ministry of Magic thought it to be a good idea for him to also gain some foreign experience, so they landed him a job in the MACUSA, where he hardly had time to actually see his Albus. They’d been able to enjoy some weekdays and the weekends together, but in the three months he’d been there, he’d had more dates with his IMOL-team (International Magical Office of Law) than his boyfriend, which, frankly, sucked dragon balls.</p><p align="justify">Oh, how his heart had been hurting when they said goodbye at the airport… he really wished that it was possible to apparate intercontinentally, so he hadn’t needed to sit alone in that lonely aircraft cabin for thirteen hours all together, thinking about how much he already missed his Albus, but even magic has its limits. But now the wait is over, Albus texted him hours ago that he was in transition in New York, that he'd fly at 10.45am and that the flight would take good seven hours. Now there couldn’t be more than three-three and a half hour left, but Scorpius has already prepared everything down into the smallest detail such as the napkins, the bed linen, the ring.</p><p align="justify">The ring.</p><p align="justify">Scorpius gets up so quickly that the chair almost falls back; he knows, he knows, he checked that it’s in its green velvet box, but just to be on the safe side, he checks it again. There it is… it’s extremely simple yet beautiful. A silver band with a green streak in, and a tiny diamond in the middle. Albus thought that silver looked better against his brown skin (any colours looked pretty on him in Scorpius’ opinion) so he’d gone with that, and in their house’s colours.</p><p align="justify">Over time Albus had grown to love being in Slytherin, and he’d taken pride in wearing its colours. And it was fitting since, after all, they’d met there. Or not entirely, we all know the story, but the fact is that Albus only deserves the best, so here Scorpius is with a wedding ring in their house’s colours and butterflies in his stomach. His head starts to spin when he thinks about that they've been together for ten years now - ten years! The memories from the christmas break, the day trip to Hogsmead and the Yule Ball stood clear as crystal in his memories still. They'd only just had time enough to celebrate Albus' 26th birthday in March before he had to leave for Seattle. He wanted to propose earlier but he didn't want to make it harder when they had to be apart for so long. Scorpius looks up at the clock on the wall, bouncing his leg. <em> Is time usually this slow? </em>he thinks, brows furrowed, while twiddling the box in his fingers. He puts it back on the table next to his plate before he stands up to aimlessly walk around in the flat.</p><p align="justify">Every time he enters the open plan kitchen and living room, he glances up at the IKEA-clock on the wall, then over to the circle of photos, both magical and muggle-photos, on the opposite wall; he’s quite sure that his favourite is the muggle-photo of Albus looking down with such a soft smile, pushing some of his thick hair away from his eyes. Either that or the magical photo of Albus posing with water to his thighs where a big wave flushed over him so he fell, and ended up on the shore again. Scorpius chuckles at the memory while his eyes wander to one of the other wizarding photos; Albus and him are dancing in front of a fountain, red, golden and brown autumn leaves whirling around their feet on the grey pavement. Scorpius slumps down in a chair with a groan, rubbing his face, and taps his foot against the table leg, impatiently. Wondering if it’s possible to travel into the future, damn, he’s antsy! All he’s waiting for is a text that his Albus is on his way to get his luggage, then he’ll apparate! <em>Plop</em>! Then he’ll hold Albus close in his arms...</p><p align="justify">His eyes runs across the room to a picture frame with seashells cast in clay in the shape of a heart with their initials in the middle made of smaller seashells. They'd collected them on a holiday a few years ago; it had been so... sappy; holding hands, sitting by the sea and watching the waves, collecting seashells, fire in the fireplace, hot chocolate while enjoying stupid american TV-shows and sleepless nights. Stargazing, of course!</p><p align="justify">Scorpius decides that he might as well just kill the bloody time; he grabs the box with the ring, and walks around in his search for the TV-remote. It can just run in the background while he, yeah, waits. Jesus, where did he put it...? Maybe it's where Albus last left it? But that can be... anywhere... in the flat. He groans, and starts to search the flat; Albus has a bad habit of picking up stuff and then leave it where he stands, when he's done with it, resulting in Scorpius finding their car-keys on the bathroom sink, or a fork in their bed after late night snacking. It's annoying but he misses it. A lot. He misses Albus' wide, sheepish smile when he raises a brow and waves whatever object that has ended up in the wrong place, he misses the way Albus will try to make him forget by putting up such an innocent attitude, promising him 'he'll never leave the TV remote on the shoe-racket again' before his hands wanders up under his shirt, and - the shoe-racket!</p><p align="justify">Damn right, there it is! But all this searching and thinking has made Scorpius lose his interest in the TV. He puts the remote back where it should be, and ends up trotting around again. It's too early to start on the dinner and the dessert, he's already done the shopping, maybe he should go out and buy another bottle of wine? Yes, he'll do that. Then he'll get some fresh air! He grabs his coat and puts on his shoes, but ends up tying them wrongly, occupied by his thoughts - or the lack of them, in this case. He finally gets the bows right, and leaves. Albus likes a good red wine, but Scorpius already bought a really good one down from the liqour store, and he knows that Albus doesn't like it when he spends too much money on him. Scorpius rounds a corner before he realises he forgot his wallet back in their flat. Merlin's cursing left testicle! He sighs deeply, as he turns on his heel, walking all the way back and up to the fourth floor. Where did he put it...? There! When did he put it on the counter? Oh well. Down the stairs again, out of the door and round the corner.</p><p align="justify">The guy behind the counter smiles when he sees Scorpius, and says that he came there yesterday. Scorpius says he forgot to buy an extra bottle, smiling sheepishly. The guy asks him if it's for his girlfriend, a question he avoids most beautifully by telling him he wants to know more about this Andalusien red wine. He regrets it right after when the guy starts what feels like an hour long talk about the grapes and the way they're handled. The wine dude drone on for ages, and all Scorpius can think of is how Albus might react when he pops the question w<em>ill you marry me?</em>; will he cry ? Will his eyes sparkle like the first time he said <em>I love you</em>? When it has taken too long, he puts up a polite smile, and tells wine guy that his lover will soon be home, so he really must get going. 135 quid, they weren't sorry! he thinks when he leaves the liqour store with a paperbag in hand. On his way back, he can't help but notice all the happy couples around him, holding hands and sharing pockets in the chilly October afternoon. The weather somehow reminds him of a song from years ago. What's the name... <em>lust for life</em>... the song reminds him of Albus. He can't wait for Albus to come home so he can pamper him to the moon and back! Then he'll hold Albus close in his arms...</p><p align="justify">Once back in their flat, he puts the bottle on the counter. There can't be a lot of time left until - HOW IS THERE STILL THREE HOURS LEFT!?</p><p align="justify">Gosh, time isn't this slow usually, is it? Scorpius groans as he taps his fingers on the green box that's on the counter where he left it. He decides that his plan earlier on letting the TV run in the background is the best right now, and takes the remote, turning on the TV; the TV starts up on ITV3, guh, a lot of dramas, Scorpius doesn’t have the brains for that right now; he zaps through a bunch of different channels, <em> channel5 </em> , <em>channel4</em>, <em>ITV</em> (are they rerunning Lewis, no, ok, then it doesn’t matter), <em> CBBC, CBeeBies </em> , <em> BBC FOUR </em> , <em> BBC TWO </em> , <em> BBC ONE</em>, <em> BBC News </em> , <em> ITV+1 </em> -</p><p align="justify">Scorpius zaps back on BBC News where a news anchor sits with a grave face.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> “... a Boeing 787 flying at 10.45am, our time, from New York to London, crashed about two hours ago over the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Already now I can sadly report that none of the crew or passengers have survived.” </em>
