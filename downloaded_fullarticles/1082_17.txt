          <div class="userstuff"><p>"I'm sure he's ok", Hermione reassured his best friend as she fixed his bowtie in their hotel room. <br/>"He's with Pansy, mate,” Ron told him. <br/>"Yeah, but I feel weird. Like when he needs me."<br/>"No, that must be the soulmate thingy again," Ron told him. "I feel the same when Hermione's away for too long." <br/>"Not the case for these two, though," Hermione shook her head. <br/>"This warm feeling is weird," Harry told them. "Does one ever get used to it?"<br/>"This has nothing to do with a soulmate connection, Harry. It's common prenuptial nervousness."<br/>"Oh, shite! I'm actually getting married today!"</p><p> </p><p>Draco was freaking nervous. In a few hours, he would be married to Harry and everything would be different. <br/>"What am I actually doing, Pansy?" He wondered. "Becoming a married man at 23?! That's insane, isn't it?"<br/>Pansy looked at him and smiled. Draco's cheeks were flushed. That's enough for her to know he's frightened. <br/>“Oh, c'mon! You've been dating Potter for the last two years, dragonhead!" <br/>"What if my mother was right and all of this was a bad decision?" <br/>"Oh, for Salazar's sake!" Pansy sighed. "You've been in love ever since 4th year!" <br/>Pansy snapped her fingers and a cup of tea materialized, floating in front of Draco. <br/>"Here, drink some tea," Pansy told him. "And calm the freak down, would you?"</p><p> </p><p>Later that day, they stood in the hotel's garden, holding hands in front of everyone. Everything was perfect, no matter what. <br/>"Do you love me, Harry?" Draco asked. <br/>"I definitely do, little dragon," Harry answered, without thinking. "Do you love me as well?"<br/>"I'll always do," Draco spoke, loud and clear. <br/>And as they sealed their marriage with a passionate, sweet kiss, Draco felt something odd: a warm caress going all over his left arm.<br/>"Love can break the worst curses, dear," Draco said.</p></div>
