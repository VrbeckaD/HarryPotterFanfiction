  <em> “But will my soulmate love me?” The little boy asked, stars in his eyes as his mother laughed. </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em> “Of course my dove!” She cried, kissing his forehead. “They will love you to the stars and back―they will love every lock of hair on your head, every tear you cry. They will love you for your thoughts, for the whispered secrets you’ll tell them. Your soulmate will love you, just as mother Magic intended, and you will love them all the same.” </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">―The Wizard’s Whole Soul, from The Tales of Beedle the Bard</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry’s had his words memorized ever since he learned how to read them.</p><p> </p><p>He touched them constantly, going to the smooth inked skin for comfort when the ache of hunger gnawed and made him dizzy. Went to them for solace, when Aunt Petunia’s shrieks of him being a <em> Freak </em> became unbearable―it was his own form of relief, knowing her words couldn’t all be true; he couldn’t be a <em> Freak </em>, not when he had his soulmate on his skin just like everyone else.</p><p> </p><p>Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon weren’t soulmates, Harry knew because once Dudley asked her about it and he overheard Aunt Petunia talking for once in a somber tone. Meeting your soulmate was a rare thing; some people went their whole lives never knowing their intended, but it didn’t stop articles being published about the mystery of it all, how one person could feel so inexplicably right. Articles about soulmates who talked the ear off anyone who’d listen about their fated partner, the pull that ruined old relationships when your soulmate suddenly became your first priority. </p><p> </p><p>The more Harry looked at his words though, the more he thought he didn’t mind not knowing his soulmate. It didn’t bother him―there was comfort alone in knowing someone out there was meant for him. </p><p> </p><p>For a little eight-year-old, who’d never known a kind word since he was born, reassurance was enough.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>During the day, Uncle Vernon would go to work, bringing along a screaming Dudley to his daycare. Harry, they kept at the house with Aunt Petunia, mostly because they realized it would cost extra to send him with Dudley and Harry wasn’t worth the effort―but Harry liked to think it was because he’s so quiet. So quiet he could practically fade out of existence, and he didn’t shriek like Dudley―though also because once he got slightly older, Harry became an extra set of hands to help with chores. By the time he was eight, Harry was allowed to run errands.</p><p> </p><p>Aunt Petunia grumbled about shopping—they lived in the suburbs, but going to the store was still a trip on foot, Aunt Petunia usually shoved money in his little hands to pick up smaller items like dish soap and toilet tissue. It didn’t bother Harry anymore, the employees knew his face (always saying ‘Oh how adorable you are!’ and ‘Aren’t you a helpful lad?’) and had his order memorized so all he had to do was smile politely, make conversation, and pass money to get what he needed. </p><p> </p><p>Nothing bad ever happened in their little town anyways.</p><p> </p><p>The white van that had been following Harry for some meters back said otherwise.</p><p> </p><p>He noticed it when he rounded the corner, vans like those usually belonged to a company but he didn’t see a sticker on the side―it was plain white, and stuck out sorely for him, but the adults didn’t seem to find it suspicious. He kept sneaking glances back at it a few times, but it was only after picking up the eggs from Mrs. Mildred at the farmer’s market nearby that the alarm bells in his self-preservation instinct told him to look again, only to find the same white van, black tinted windows, still there, the very same he’d noticed when he’d been idly waiting for the vegetables. </p><p> </p><p>Something in the vehicle felt wrong to Harry, and Harry liked to think he could trust his instincts a lot considering the number of times he had to rely on it to get away from Dudley and his bully friends. Taking the eggs he walked, quicker this time. </p><p> </p><p>Only a block away from Mrs. Mildred he found himself on a completely deserted path and had to silently cry wondering why he didn’t just ask her to call the police or Aunt Petunia to pick him up―he was so busy trying to run away, giving frequent glances back towards the van that was picking up speed―Harry didn’t notice the stranger in front of him until he ran head-on first into the figure, stumbling backward because of his small stature and letting the eggs fall out of his sweaty fingers, onto the pavement with a crack. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my, are you alright there?”</p><p> </p><p>It was there through the panic that Harry registered the words, processing each syllable that fell from the man’s lips―he glanced up, jaw a little slack.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Oh my, are you alright there? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>His soulmate. He’d met his soulmate. He’s memorized the words, he didn’t need them said twice for Harry to immediately cling to the stranger’s leg, tiny fingers digging into the calf, fat tears welling in his eyes because he knew, just <em> knew </em>, his soulmate would never hurt him. He managed to say between choked sobs, eyes going blurry, what he hoped were the words also printed on this man’s wrist.</p><p> </p><p>“Please―please <em> help me </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Something like carefully suppressed shock seemed to cross the man’s face, which quickly morphed into alarm before giving way to something more grim when Harry glanced back again―towards the van still idling nearby the two of them. Harry knew all about stranger danger, never taken candy from random people, but no one’s ever prepared him on what to do about strange vehicles following him on his grocery run without his Aunt.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright little one, let’s get you home.” Harry didn’t fight it when he was hoisted up into the man’s arms—ended up clinging desperately like a koala to him―his own small arms around the man’s neck, hiding his face and desperately trying not to burst into full-on sobs because he met his soulmate and he was going to be fine. </p><p> </p><p>His soulmate rested a comforting hand on his back, patting in intervals and shushing him softly with murmured reassurances. They walked for a while, until the van could no longer be seen―enough that Harry stopped feeling hysterical from the whole situation and timidly glanced up and around just to make sure the van wasn’t following them. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s alright, they’re gone.” </p><p> </p><p>Heat filled his cheeks, enough he’d probably turned cherry red in the arms of the man. Still―there was a kind smile on his face, soft. Rather distantly Harry thought his soulmate looked handsome; certainly better than his Uncle and Aunt and definitely better than Dudley. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, for helping me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t be much of a soulmate if I didn’t, would I?” And oh his voice was soft too, low, like the roll of distant thunder, comforting. “Would you like me to put you down?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, even when he didn’t entirely want to be put down but he also didn’t want to be too much of a bother, he relished the fact they could still hold hands, grasping as tightly as his little fingers could, making it clear he didn’t want to let go. His soulmate chuckled, a rumbly kind of humored sound. “Alright, do you know your way back?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry tugged, leading the way, the Dursley house a couple of minutes walk from where they were. Mycroft, his soulmate introduced himself, <em> Mycroft </em>, Harry repeated to himself in reverence―filled the silence with idle questions, simple things. Harry learned Mycroft was a University student on vacation, and just happened to stop by Surrey. Mycroft Holmes had a family, a mom, dad and a little brother. By the time they reached the little hanging gate of Harry’s Privet Drive house, the fear from before had almost entirely gone.</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt a little unsure when Mycroft walked him up to the house, and began to frown when Mycroft knocked on the door which was followed by Aunt Petunia’s shrill response of <em> ‘Coming!’ </em>. The door swung open, her face almost immediately twisting into a scowl at the sight of Harry. He unconsciously pressed a little closer to Mycroft’s side without knowing. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m terribly sorry, what trouble has—<em> he </em> gotten into now?” Harry winced at her tone of voice, clearly, she was trying her best not to say <em> Freak </em> at the moment―it didn’t stop him from fearing what she would do later when Uncle Vernon came back.</p><p> </p><p>Mycroft had a strange look on his face, “My apologies Mrs. Potter―Harry was nearly―”</p><p> </p><p>Aunt Petunia cut him off, her face twisting into fury as she spat her next words. “I am not Mrs. Potter, I am Mrs. Dursley, his <em> aunt </em>. Now if it’s not important I’ll be taking him.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, then perhaps I am at fault then, I was looking for the Potter residence. Perhaps Harry was mistaken, we’ll be leaving―”</p><p> </p><p>“The Potters,” Aunt Petunia scowled. “Are <em> dead </em>. I’m taking care of the boy until he turns of age, now let him go before I call the police.” </p><p> </p><p>Harry hung his head, he hadn’t known how to explain to his soulmate that his parents were gone, and he felt distinctly ashamed he had to let Mycroft go through one of Aunt Petunia’s little fits she had whenever his mum was mentioned. He wondered sadly if his soulmate would ever be able to come see him again, he didn’t think he’d like to meet anyone’s family if they were anything like Aunt Petunia. Softly, he pried his fingers reluctantly out of Mycroft’s hands, which had gone a little tight during the whole encounter. He mumbled a thanks before moving to slide himself through the gap between Aunt Petunia and the door, but the tug on his arm stopped him.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” Mycroft’s voice was still soft, a gentle crooning thing. “I promise to write to you.” </p><p> </p><p>Oh... <em> Oh </em>…</p><p> </p><p>How that made Harry’s heart absolutely <em> soar. </em> He smiled, mimicking the grin Mycroft was giving him as much as possible. </p><p> </p><p>Aunt Petunia roughly tugged him in, shutting the door on his soulmate’s face.</p><p> </p><p>When Uncle Vernon came back, he got the worst caning of his life, sent to bed without dinner and was given a list of chores to start at sunrise with only water for breakfast. Dudley had cackled at his door, munching loudly on his bag of cookies and taunted Harry until Aunt Petunia sent him up.</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, none of it was enough to wipe the smile from his face.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Aunt Petunia made Dudley get the morning letters after that. </p><p> </p><p>She carefully shredded the ones that came in beautiful envelopes in front of Harry, shrilly telling him he was a freak for making friends with a stranger when all Harry wanted to do was scream that Mycroft was his<em> soulmate </em>.</p><p> </p><p>When she tossed them in the bin, he carefully tried to sneak pieces out, saving every little scrap from each torn letter that came. They came weekly at first, but then to Harry’s horror only monthly. Monthly he had to watch his Aunt or Uncle take one specific letter, wave it in his face, only to tear it to bits and throw it away, never giving Harry the right to touch or even look. So without fail the letters did come monthly―</p><p> </p><p>But the words never made it to him. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Harry turned nine before he ever saw Mycroft again. He was miserably pulling weeds from Aunt Petunia’s garden when he heard someone call his name. He was sweaty, fingers grimy from the soil, but it didn’t stop the unadulterated look of pure joy that bloomed on his face when he saw Mycroft waving him over, standing by the gate. He stumbled over a little clumsily in Dudley’s baggy clothes as he quickly wiped his hands down on the ratty pants, launching into the man’s arms. He quickly stuck himself to Mycroft, mending the hurt he felt at not getting to read any of the letters he was sent during the year apart.</p><p> </p><p>The warm hand on his back was nothing like the shoves he got from Uncle Vernon or the firm smacks from Aunt Petunia. It was a comforting pat, soothing even as he attempted to smother himself on Mycroft.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Harry, happy birthday little dove.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s eyes practically sparkled, only after taking note of the other thing Mycroft had balanced a little precariously on one hand while the other still fondly patted Harry’s head.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you know!”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t be much of a soulmate if I didn’t, would I?” The familiarity of the words said, coupled with a cheeky wink, made Harry smile all the wider. His happiness for the Dursleys being away only multiplied. He knew they wouldn’t be back till late at night, having planned a full day outing and dismissed Harry entirely. “I brought you a cake, it’s chocolate, I was hoping you’d like chocolate.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, still starry-eyed as Mycroft leaned the cake down for Harry to see. It was store-bought, that much Harry knew because all the homemade cakes he’s seen Aunt Petunia make were always messy―this one was beautiful, perfectly round, with a red ribbon tied around it. There were flowers, much to his amazement, looking soft and white with each petal arranged perfectly. Even the letters on the cake were perfect, evenly spaced and spelling ‘<em> Harry Birthday Harry </em>’ in the prettiest cursive he’d ever seen. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think your relatives would like me in, so do you think they’d mind you out, Harry?”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t even a question of whether they’d mind, Harry didn’t think he <em> cared </em> what they thought. All he had to consider was the fact Aunt Petunia wouldn’t even notice the half-finished garden―all the other chores he’d finished during the morning. It was just about locking the door behind him and coming back before they did. So he shook his head, quickly rushing in to grab the house keys Uncle Vernon always left on the table and shut the door behind him. Mycroft readily took his smaller hand in his, and Harry marveled at how perfect it all felt.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The cafe Mycroft took him to was fancy, with soft creme decor highlighted with pretty gold trimmings. They were at a table near the window―the server who passed the menus was a chipper girl who kept shooting glances Mycroft’s way. Harry could read the menu, he was proud of that, but he didn’t understand half of what was on it, so he resorted to scrunching his face up and putting the menu down, more focused on his birthday cake, hoping to get a slice. The server noticed.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m really sorry sir but we don’t allow outside food―”</p><p> </p><p>“One time should be alright, won’t it? It’s the little one’s birthday.” Mycroft smoothly interjected with a smile that turned the girl beet red, nodding along. </p><p> </p><p>“Of course! Would you like tea to go along with the cake? Our collection of―”</p><p> </p><p>From there Harry zoned out of the conversation, only taking note when Mycroft decided on a simple black tea for both of them. There were other snacks ordered too, but he couldn’t even begin to pronounce the name of most, let alone remember them. Once it was all done, Mycroft’s attention fell back to Harry— and how strange and warm that alone made him feel.</p><p> </p><p>“Why were you out doing the gardening?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s part of my chores―” At the look Mycroft gave Harry, he hesitated before speaking. “I mean, it’s okay, it’s normal―”</p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” Mycroft’s voice was soft this time, a little chiding. “Birthday boy’s should be out celebrating, not doing house chores.” </p><p> </p><p>Harry didn’t really know how to reply to that, all he’d known was the droning cycle that made up his life. Not made any better each year, and in fact, getting worse as he grew older. He was still small for his size, smaller than Dudley, but each additional year on his age tacked on another set of things he could do that Aunt Petunia pushed on him. Dudley got presents and cakes for his birthday, Harry got a slice of pizza if he was being good.</p><p> </p><p>The silence after that was a little awkward, but Mycroft busied it by cutting a slice of the chocolate cake he’d brought in for Harry. The slice was a little obscene, definitely too big, but Harry couldn’t complain when his eyes gleamed at the sight of the perfectly layered insides―from the soft spongy cake to the sugary frosting. He was a little hesitant to take a bite, fork in hand, glancing over to Mycroft for reassurance who motioned for him to dig in. The fork went smoothly down, the first burst of cocoa on his tongue sending <em> stars </em> to his taste buds. Harry always thought he’d like chocolate, from the brief taste he got from little chips he could pick out of hardened cookies, nibbling on those like treats. But this, <em> this </em> was entirely different, the sweetness of it had him melting.</p><p> </p><p>Mycroft seems to laugh a little at the reaction, and his smile was something Harry really liked. “You act as if this is your first time tasting chocolate cake.”</p><p> </p><p>The words had Harry forming a frown mid-bite, which in turn made Mycroft frown. “<em> Is </em> this your first time?” A little sadly Harry nodded, tentatively licking off the remaining chocolate cream as he avoided looking at Mycroft entirely. It wasn’t exactly easy admitting the kind of living conditions the Dursleys put him through. It took a while for Harry to even put together that living under the stairs wasn’t normal itself―but even the mention of taking up the second bedroom in the house had sent Dudley wailing and Harry to his closet without a meal again.</p><p> </p><p>Another silence fell between them as the tea was served, Harry opting for as much sugar as possible with milk. Mycroft, Harry noticed, didn’t take anything with his tea. </p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” The way his name was said had him shyly looking up. “I want you to be honest with me, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to talk if you don’t want to, just nod or shake your head. If you’re uncomfortable, we’ll stop.”</p><p> </p><p>A shrug.</p><p> </p><p>“Is leaving you alone in the house, something normal?”</p><p> </p><p>A nod.</p><p> </p><p>“Has your aunt or uncle ever laid a hand on you? And it hurt?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned, gripping his fork a tad harder. A gentle palm was laid over his hand. Without him noticing, Mycroft had moved a seat closer. That wrist was where Harry’s words were printed, and he tilted the hand to let Harry run smaller fingers over them. </p><p> </p><p>“You know what these marks mean, right Harry?” He did, there wasn’t a person in the world who didn’t talk about them. Children all fantasized about meeting their soulmates, and adults bemoaned never meeting theirs. Harry’s spent more than one night in his cold little cupboard just tracing his words over and over. “This means I’ll do whatever is in my power to make sure you’re happy, do you understand that Harry?” </p><p> </p><p>He felt the tears well before he could wipe them back, the first of his sobs escaping where he was pressed into Mycroft’s shoulders, fisting the fabric of the older man’s shirt―and for the first time Harry cried his heart out—then cried harder when he realized there was no one there to beat him or tell him to shut up.</p><p> </p><p>(Mycroft smelled like smoke, smoke, and heady cologne, it was a little overwhelming―but a scent Harry comes to associate with safety and home.)</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Mycroft, Harry learned, never lies.</p><p> </p><p>That birthday became the best Harry’d ever celebrated. He got to eat his fill of cake that for once didn’t leave him craving more―all before Mycroft had gently whisked him off to stores to get some pretty new clothes and even a stuffed rabbit he’d seen sitting on the shelf from a toy store. Harry enjoyed the time he got to spend with his soulmate, but only became sadder when he saw the sky beginning to get dark; he knew his time was up and he would have to be back before the Dursleys got home.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was relieved when he didn’t see a car at the front porch, it was still dark, enough time for Harry to give Mycroft another hug; he was a little teary by the end of it, so unwilling to part, that he didn’t know what to say when Mycroft promised Harry a loving home within a month.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss Mycroft pressed on his forehead was warm.</p><p> </p><p>When he curled up to sleep in his little cupboard, Harry kept his new clothes hidden away, back to wearing the ratty shirt and jeans from Dudley’s old wardrobe―the rabbit he’d gotten was the only soft, sweet-smelling thing he had out to remember the day by, its little suit and curious eyepatch bringing a smile to his face. Eventually, the bustling of his aunt, uncle and wailing cousin roused him to also keep the rabbit hidden away; too scared to have any of his new treasures taken.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The police knocked on the Dursley home exactly one week later, the same day Harry and Dudley were taken away. </p><p> </p><p>Harry, a little scared as he clutched his rabbit. Dudley, screaming and crying as Petunia and Vernon got escorted away―Petunia in tears, and Vernon’s booming voice cussing Harry out for the mistake he was for even breathing.</p><p> </p><p>Harry never had to see the inside of that cupboard ever again. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The lady Harry talks to is named Olivia. She had the kindest smile and softest voice, she smelled like flowers and always brought Harry snacks when he asked nicely. He didn’t see Dudley, or Aunt Petunia or Uncle Vernon―and Olivia promised he would never have to see any of them ever again. The news brought a smile to his face, immediate relief (no more hunger and pain), but then quickly tumbled into fear as he suddenly realized he didn’t have a house to go back to.</p><p> </p><p>Though, that too was apparently seen to.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Ashford were probably the kindest couple Harry had ever met.</p><p> </p><p>Benjamin Ashford was a big man, burly, frankly a little intimidating―he had more muscle where Uncle Vernon was all pudgy. He had a tuft of hair that was all brown, and even kinder chocolate eyes. He always had a smile on his face and made sure to kneel down to Harry’s height when they were talking. He never spoke too loudly, never once raised his voice when it was just Harry or Mrs. Ashford around. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Ashford was a construction worker. He helped to build houses and repair old ones, always bringing back a story Harry would be more than happy to listen to.</p><p> </p><p>Marianne Ashford had worked at the local primary school as a part-time teacher until she decided to stop when Harry came into their home. Her hair was long, flowy chestnut, and her eyes were the kind of blue that reminded Harry of the sky on a sunny, cloudless day. She loved to give Harry hugs, made sure Harry finished his meals and got plenty of snacks, and always pressed kisses to his forehead before bed after a bedtime story.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s room was a deep maroon red, painted that way the week after the Ashfords had first taken him in. They’d gone on a trip to pick up paint and within the day Harry was gleefully painting the walls of his first room the beautiful color. He got to fluff his own bed, pick new toys, books, clothes―by the end of it he’d cried into their arms, overwhelmed and just thankful, praying it all wasn’t a dream.</p><p> </p><p>Mycroft’s promise came true, by the end of the month Harry had gotten a new, very loving family.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The next time Harry saw Mycroft, it didn’t take another year―only a couple of months, and Harry even gets to read the weekly letters he sends.</p><p> </p><p>(Turns out Mycroft knew all about the torn and shredded letters, he’d been sending empty, unwritten ones after the first; really only sending them to let Harry know that he was still thinking about him.)</p><p> </p><p>Harry was as joyful as ever to see Mycroft again when he did, bounding into his arms and squeezing just a tad too tightly. He was heavier now, Mycroft noted with a smile, the horrifying skinniness he’d had before which shocked even the doctors was replaced by good meals that gave him a healthier glow. Harry was far too enamored with Mycroft’s presence to let go, tugging the man into the house―he wanted his parents (and really, when had he started seeing the Ashfords as parents?) to meet his soulmate.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Holmes! You should have told us you’d be dropping by!”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m terribly sorry, I wrote to Harry, I assumed he’d tell you.” </p><p> </p><p>Something of a flush crept along Harry’s face, he’d been too excited. </p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Ashford only laughed, entirely lighthearted, “Well no wonder, he’s been bouncing off the walls these past few days. Please sit, I’ll get some tea.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry fell prey to his curiosity when he asked, “You never told me you know them.”</p><p> </p><p>Mycroft’s smile was more mysterious than it should have been, “Of course, the Ashfords have always been close family friends. They’ve wanted a child for years, and what better perfect child to join their home than my little soulmate?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On Harry’s tenth birthday, his birthday present was adoption papers reading his new name as Harry Benjamin Ashford.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On Harry’s eleventh, a stern lady with sharp eyes and pressed lips arrived to deliver a letter to him.</p>
