</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Bill Weasley paced the floor in the hallway outside the Saint Mungo's Spell Damage and Repair Unit impatiently. His father was inside with his mother. He didn't think he had ever been more terrified in his life. His forehead was sweaty and his clammy hands still clutched a tiny bit of parchment with a short terse note from Fleur that he had received two hours prior.</p><p><em>Mum's potion exploded. We're fine. She had no idea who anyone was when she came to. She's at Saint Mungos with your Dad, who she doesn't recognize. She's in the Spell Damage Ward. Go, love, I'll hold down the fort</em>.</p><p>-Fleur</p><p>He had waited for over an hour outside the door, pacing the whole time and only finally sat down at the stern request of a frustrated receptionist. He sat in one of the many yellow colored waiting chairs that lined the walls of the hallways alongside George, Ginny, and Charlie. They each took turns stealing glances at the end of the hallway where two great blue doors would swing open periodically emitting a red-robed Healer or a patient being wheeled about in a chair. The patients were mostly all victims of permanent spell damage with hollowed cheeks and reflective eyes, one had drool dripping down his chin. However, it wasn't the rare patient that made them uneasy; they collectively cringed every time shrieks made it through the silencing charms on the double doors.</p><p>George would clench his fists in his lap his face getting whiter as time passed. He was no doubt relieving the horror of losing Fred all over again. He was pretty sure Ginny was wearing nothing but a bathrobe. She had pulled her legs up to chest sobbing quietly. When the shrieks made it through the wards she would sob harder her whole body shaking. She was shaking so hard Bill had to spell her robe to stay closed. On closer inspection he realized it was actually a men's bathrobe, undoubtedly Harry's robe, thrown haphazardly over of a very short dark green lace teddy, that would give his mother a stroke. He shook his head in exasperation. She peeked up at him puzzled.</p><p>"Mum will freak when she sees you in that." He murmured so that their brothers would not overhear. She rubbed her eyes and smirked a little.</p><p>"Harry and I were... well I mean it's quite obvious what we were doing when I got the call." He snorted at his baby sister. That was Ginevra Molly Weasley. Always flouted convention and doing whatever she was told she shouldn't. She and Harry were too perfect a match for each other to ever split up and quite honestly his parents loved him like a son enough that they never mentioned anything to either of them. Sure they were frustrated but they never said anything to either of them. He sighed and kissed her head just as two Healers walked through the double doors. They both snapped up at the healers as they whispered avidly to each other passing them without so much as a glance.</p><p>Ginny had arrived with Harry shortly after he had finally found the spell damage ward. Harry had deposited a sobbing Ginny into his lap kissing her and murmuring apologies as he was met up with Ron and rushed through the double doors with a Healer. Ron had been waiting for Harry as they were part of the Auror protection detail for his mother. All family members of Ministry employees had Auror protective details whenever there was an incident since the war ended so a few months ago. Minister Shackelbolt had insisted that family members were one of the many ways innocent people had been forced into Voldemort's cause. They would injure a family member and then lure the Ministry member into a room and either Imperio them or coerce them using the ill family member as leverage.</p><p>An alarming number of Healers had there Hearlership revoked and sent to Azkaban for their involvement in the coercion of Ministry members. Harry had even called a had even Order meeting about it. They were all genuinely surprised at the amount of Death Eater's that were found after the war. Death Eaters that had either monetarily backed Voldemort or Magical Tradesman that never got involved in the day to day fighting but still supported Voldemort and offered their talents to him. The more people came out of the woodwork the more surprised they all were that they won at all. There were entire groups of Healers, Curse Breakers, Aurors, and even people in Dad's department. They were still uncovering people and small groups as time went on. A lot of Wizards had fled Europe altogether and retreated to Australia whom took all the Wizards without question and refused to cooperate with the Ministry. One of Kingsley's first major act as Minister was banning all Australian nationals from Europe as well as travel to Australia, along with the other Heads of Countries. Even the English Muggle Parliament had joined in on the cause cited a mass prison break out and exodus to Australia and their governments lack of involvement.</p><p>It had been a hard decision to make considering that Hermione's parents were still in Australia. Several Aurors had left undercover the week before to try and retrieve them. They had missed several check-ins and the Weasley's were all worried about Hermione. Mum had been fretting over her and insisted she moved into the Burrow. After several disputes with Harry, his mom triumphed and Hermione moved into Ginny's room. Ginny didn't mind since her room was basically vacated anyway. Hermione had spent the last four days in her bed sobbing over her parents missed anniversary and the missed check-ins with the Aurors when his Mom and Fleur had decided to throw a party to cheer Hermione up. They had invited all of Hermione's Hogwarts friends and Order friends as well.</p><p>The party was under the guise of being a Graduation party for the few Eighth-year students that had gone back to complete their education. Hermione had actually graduated the week before and there had been a rather large Hogwarts scale graduation ceremony and party then. However, she had refused to go because Academia was something she inherited from her parents and in her words, <em>"If they cannot be here to see me graduate then I will not graduate."</em> Bill had wanted to point out that since they were muggles they would not have seen her graduate anyway but he kept that to himself. Instead, she spent the day with Ron at her parents home eating junk food and watching the Muggle telly that Ron was enamored by. When his mother had found out she had begun to plan the party with the help of Fleur.</p><p>His Mom had started to panic when she realized just how many guests were coming and had enlisted Andromeda Tonks as well as George's <em>not-girlfriend</em> Angelina Johnson. Fleur had gone over a half an hour before with Victoire to help and calm her down<strong>. </strong>Victoire favorite person in the whole world was her granny. When she was throwing a screaming fit and neither parent could get the veracious toddler to quiet down they flood Granny over. Granny would walk into the room and Victoire's shrill screaming would screech to a halt, her eyes would widen, and her arms would outstretch towards her favorite person in the world, a slow smile creeping up her fat little cheeks. His mom was the same, when she was getting unseemly or hysterical his Dad would drop into their kitchen and grab Victoire no matter what she was doing. Once she had been in the middle of a bath. George had been the one to pop and had scared Fleur so badly she had hexed him into Saint Mungos.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny placed her hand in his disrupting his thoughts. He had been trailing his scar on his face. Greyback had been vicious about his mauling in the Astronomy Tower. He supposed he was lucky, had Greyback actually intended to turn him he would have bitten him and moved on. Instead, he had wanted to tear him to pieces and eat him. This had been part of his testimony after the war. He had laughed and had taken such pride and glee at what he had done that several members of the Wizengmot had lost their lunches at his detailed description of his many attacks.</p><p>Ginny pulled his hand away from his scarred face and he smiled thankfully at her. Greyback's claws had gone so deep they had torn at his bone. It was excruciating when he poked at it. He had developed a tick that his mother thought was a form of PTSD, that involved poked the damn thing with his fingers when he was stressed. Fleur had been a right mess when she had dragged him to St. Mungos and the Healers could do nothing for him.</p><p>"It's going to be okay, Bill. It's Mum." George murmured from his other side, gripping his hand at his side. Ginny had let his hand drop limply into his lap as she scrambled off of him and onto the vacant chair next to him. She threaded their fingers together and squeezed their hands until it hurt. He nuzzled her head into his shoulder. George, on the other side of him, was breathing deeply. He was still learning how to live without Fred. He was constantly pausing during sentences waiting for his brother to finish whatever his thought was. It broke everyone's hearts all over again every time it happened. George had abandoned the Joke shop after the funeral and if not for his friend Lee Jordan the whole place would have gone under.</p><p>Lee had moved into the basement and had taken over. He didn't ask for a salary or commission. Bill thought back to all the summer vacations when Fred and Lee hung out and he wondered if there had been something more than friendship with the two. His mother must have thought so because Lee had been a permanent fixture at the Weasley house since the war ended, so had Angelina. She had held George during Fred's funeral and stayed with him the nightmarish week after. George had broken everything in Weasley Wizarding Wheezes in a fit of rage one morning and Angelina had sat with him until his rage turned to sadness and the two fixed the Joke Shop he and his brother had built. Angelina was an honorary Weasley same as Hermione, Harry, and Lee.</p><p>Charlie stood up abruptly from next to George. He had been silent since the end of the war. The only time he spoke was to firmly tell his mother he would not cut his hair. Bill thought he blamed himself for Fred's death. That if he had been there earlier Fred would not have died. He knew that he had been speaking to a Muggle Healer for the mind and that it was helping him tremendously. He still lived in Romania but he came home every Sunday and had already arrived to help with the setup for the party.</p><p>"Anyone want Coffee or something to eat? I need to stretch my legs." They all nodded and Ginny requested a muffin or two. George smirked at ruffled her hair before returning to staring at the large swinging doors.</p><p>"I Love you Gin. You know that right?" She smiled and hugged him fiercely. After several minutes she let go but they held hands tightly. He nodded to George who still held his other hand. Bill remembered he had spent most of his childhood begging his mother for a little sister. He had been disappointed when Percy and Charlie were born but when his mom was pregnant with Fred and George he thought for sure at least one would be a girl. When they were both boys he had been furious enough that he refused to go near either of them. Not for pictures, or to play, or even to touch either baby.</p><p>His mother had been a wreck. She would try and bribe him with sweets just to touch one of their toes but he was resilient. Unless it was a baby girl he didn't want it. She could take the baby back to Saint Mungos where it came from and tell them it was supposed to be a girl, thank you very much. His father thought the whole situation was hilarious and boasted about it at work or dinner functions. He had even found out that his Fabian Prewett had had a similar reaction to his mom when she was born. The longer it kept up the more tearful his mother became. It had broken his mother's heart and he had finally relented after she broke down and cried. The sight of his mummy in tears made him begrudgingly tickle the newborns' toes. She left him alone after that.</p><p>Fred had been colicky after the first month and after several weeks it had worn his mother down. She lost several pounds and barely slept. His father had been promoted right before the twins were born and weren't home half as much as his mom needed. His father had charged him and Charlie with helping his Mum with the twins. Mum would often plop Fred into his lap and ask him to walk around with him in an attempt to soothe him. One day after a very loud breakfast Bill had taken Fred outside and sat with him watching the Gnomes there. After about a half an hour he noticed that Fred was watching with him quietly clutching his pinkie. It took him several days to figure it out but he realized when sat with Fred outside in his lap and held onto his tiny hand he ceased all tears and stared out inquisitively.</p><p>The next week he learned how to put baby Fred to bed at night with the help of his Mum. He would sit diligently beside his cot with his pinkie outstretched until baby Fred fell asleep. When Fred had died Bill had collapsed next to his brother's body and just held his hand willing him to open his eyes. At the funeral, George asked him to sit by him and just hold his hand while Angelina held him. Now they held hands and he hoped George wasn't thinking of that day.</p><p>He sighed at the aching memory. Fred's death was too fresh in their minds, it would probably always be too soon or too fresh in all of their minds. It had been little over a year since they had lost him. They still mourned for him every day and no one ever sat in his seat at the table. Every meal had a place set out for him and often his mom would distractedly scoop food onto his plate or scold Fred for not eating. He wasn't sure how long it would take until the ache in his chest went away, he hoped it never would. It had been 17 months since they lost and even though he had Victoire right after the war he had not named her after Fred. Had she been a boy it would not have been a question but Fleur did not want Victoire to be teased when she got older for having a boy's name. He had not agreed at the time but he was glad now that his wife had seen since. When they had a son his name would be Fred.</p><p>He was broken out of his reverie when he heard yelling and screaming as the double doors swung open. His father was standing in the middle of the doors looking pale, furious, and terrified. Before Bill had a chance to say a word he stormed towards them with purpose and a speed that he had never seen his father exhibits in all his life. The siblings looked at each other in surprise as he raced right passed them not even seeing them. Their father never ran not even when they fell off of their brooms. He was always calm and level headed in every situation. He never had a temper, either. He couldn't remember a time he ever shouted at them and Fred and George regularly blew things up in their youth and adulthood.</p><p>The three siblings jumped up to race after them when they were jolted by yells of stupefies and curses coming from passed the now open double doors. Charlie had just made it to the corridor and had observed the entire thing. All four of them had wands drawn at the first scream from their mother. Bill and Ginny were two steps closer towards their dad he looked at Charlie and they silently communicated their younger siblings looking to them for guidance.</p><p>"Ginny and Bill go after Dad. George and I will go for Mum." He took off in a run his wand out and his scar stinging. Something was terribly wrong.</p><p>He glanced at Ginny and she bolted after him while George and Charlie raced through the double doors tossing fleeing Healers out of the way. They raced down the hallway after their father who was running towards one of the Ministry's private entrances. He called out to his father but he didn't stop he continued running.</p><p>"Dad! DAD! MR. WEASLEY!" He bellowed. His father didn't break pace. They were gaining on him and he was muttering to himself as he zigzagged around patients and healers knocking things over as well as people. Shouts of fury followed them as they raced after him. Bill muttered apologies as they passed and knew they were going to get a rather large bill from Saint Mungos once this was all sorted.</p><p>"Dad!" Ginny was shouting. He exchanged a look with his sister when he only ran faster turning abruptly towards the large open room that was designated for private Ministry Floos. He flicked his wand to open it as he ran. The Floo fire turned black and his father careened towards another hallway and yanked a door open that opened into a large empty conference room, his wand outstretched in a fighting pose. It was empty and eerily quiet. He stopped at the end of the hallway and conjured his Patronus whispering something to it. He cast several charms to keep anyone out of the room they were currently in. They two just made it in as the blue wall of magic came down. Ginny had rolled on the floor to make it in several feet away from him. Bill was dusting himself off, his wand at the ready when Ginny looked up from the floor and shouted at their father.</p><p>He faulted for a moment before murmuring to himself. Ginny jumped up to her feet and took several steps forward and called out again. He didn't look like he had a destination in mind. He was just running.</p><p>"Oi! Dad wait! Please, Daddy!" His Dad froze and turned. He smiled at Ginny warmly, his eyes still filled with panic.</p><p>"Ginny. Where's your brother?" He was talking to quickly and Bill wondered how bad this was for his Dad's blood pressure. He took a step forward as Ginny yelled back at their Dad.</p><p>"What? What are you talking about Dad?" He visibly recoiled from Ginny causing her to flinch. What the hell was going on?!</p><p>"I have to find Bill. I have to find Bill." Ginny looked at her father with fear in her eyes, what was wrong? He stepped forward. How had he not seen him?</p><p>"Dad, I'm right here. What's going on?" His father's eyes widened as his face paled as he placed his arms on his father's shoulder's. He could hear Ginny running up behind him.</p><p>"Bill. Azkaban. They're coming for you. We need to get you out of here. Now!" His arms went around his eldest son just as Ginny reached for her brother's shoulder. The loud crack of their apparition was drowned out by the sound of their father's shield being burst apart by what looked like Auror's. The last thing Bill saw before they were gone from the room was his father's shield falling and the room being flooded by Auror's.</p>
