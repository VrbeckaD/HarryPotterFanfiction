    <p align="center">Severus Snape thought he knew the risks of taking on the protection detail of Harry Potter. The son of a man that strikes fear in the most hardened of agents. He soon realises that he could be in deeper than a simple protection detail as Harry's true nature is revealed. AU Different powers. Snarry HP/SS Slash</p><p align="center">xXx</p><p>When Severus entered the room, the young man was facing away from him as he looked out the window of the second story house.  He’d been told that he was eighteen but from what he could see, he only looked to be sixteen at the most, but their file could have been incorrect.  His shaggy black hair was a mess and he had a lean body that Severus knew hid a strength he couldn't match. His eyes took in the details of the man for he would be spending a lot of time with him in the coming future.</p><p>He stepped closer to the boy and could make out the sharp angles of his face and his slightly tanned skin.  He wore a dark grey shirt and black jeans, which blended in well with the shadows around him. He had placed himself to the side of the window as he looked out at the street below and had yet to turn in his direction.</p><p>“Good afternoon, Mr Potter.” Severus said softly, not wanting to startle the man.</p><p>Piecing green eyes locked onto him and gave him a once over. Those eyes were in contrast to the rest of him, they looked older than his years. Severus stood up straighter as he crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>“So, you are my protector.  Would you like to know what happened to the others that stood in your place?” The man offered tonelessly, like he didn’t much care about the fate that had befallen the men before Severus.</p><p>Severus bristled at the man’s tone and then shivered as he remembered what had happened to the boy’s other protectors.</p><p>“I am well aware of what has transpired to your other minders,” Severus stated shortly.  “Let me reassure you, that will not be happening to me.  As much as you might hate it, Mr Potter, we are now stuck with each other.”</p><p>Potter snorted and his lips twisted up slightly as a glint came into his eyes.</p><p>“Maybe you have to read those files again,” He suggested, then turned back to staring out the window, ignoring Severus and anything else in the room.</p><p>“There are a few rules that we have to discuss before you may proceed in looking out that window, Mr Potter.”</p><p>“Fine, talk Mr Snape.  I’m listening.”</p><p>Severus narrowed his eyes at the man’s back but didn’t comment on his inattention. This was not his first protection detail.</p><p>“You will follow my directions at all times, understand?” Severus laid out.</p><p>Harry said nothing or even acknowledge his presence.  Severus believed that Harry had heard this talk enough times in his life that he didn’t need to hear it once more.</p><p>“You will listen to my directions as well as follow them, Mr Potter.” Severus spat out, wanting to get this out of the way as quickly as possible.  “I will listen to you and as long as any request you make is within my power and your safety. You will be allowed to do as you wish.”</p><p>The boy slowly glanced over to look back at Severus, he'd probably never heard that before.  When one is in protective custody, they didn’t get much freedom, which could lead to accidents that could get both of them killed.</p><p>“Go on, Mr Snape.” Harry intoned.</p><p>The boy was now looking at him with his full attention, those green eyes looking him over and he held back a shiver. Well aware of what the boy was and who his family were. The kind of blood that flowed in his veins and the reason that he was in this situation.</p><p>“You know the drill, you have heard it many time before-"</p><p>Severus was interrupted by Harry’s snort.</p><p>“-I will not be like your previous guardians, Mr Potter,” Severus continued, as if he'd never been interrupted.  “Just remember, and remember well, I do not like being questioned or disobeyed.  Do you understand?”</p><p>Harry looked him over, from Severus’s stern face to his dark clothing and sharp black eyes.  He was not a man to be crossed and Harry knew that. Harry's lips twisted up and he could feel the man's power lightly on the air and he gave a slight nod.</p><p>“I will follow your directions as long as I believe they should be followed, Mr Snape." Harry countered calmly. "I’ve had to look after myself for a long time and if I believe something you are asking me to do will put me into danger, I will not follow it. Do you understand me?”</p><p>Severus did not like to be disobeyed but in this case, he would have to lean towards Harry’s demands.  The boy was right, he had made it to the age he was, due to using his wits, skills, power and he knew his own limitations.</p><p>“Very well," Severus conceded. "We have an agreement.”</p><p>Severus held out his hand, which after a slight hesitation was taken up in the other man’s. He just hoped this arrangement wouldn't mean his death, like the others before him. For those photos had not shown an easy death.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Severus soon learned that the window was Harry’s favourite place.  The boy could sit in that seat for hours on end staring at…god only knew what.  Severus let him at it, he enjoyed the quiet, even if it was disturbing to watch the eighteen-year-old, looking out at nothing.</p><p>Every now and again the boy would stand up and walk over to his bag and pull out what looked like a notebook and take it back with him to the window.  Severus would watch his every move before turning back to his own work. The weeks passed and Severus was starting to grow restless, which wasn’t good for Harry or him.</p><p>“We’ll go out for dinner tonight,” Severus announced at breakfast. </p><p>Harry looked up, unconcerned with his pronouncement.</p><p>“Alright, where would you like to go?” Harry asked.</p><p>“McDonalds would suffice.”</p><p>“I haven’t eaten there in years,” Harry commented, which Severus took as consent.</p><p>“Be ready at seven.”</p><p>"It's not like I have anywhere else to be," Harry replied with a lopsided grin.</p><p>xXx</p><p>The bullets were flying from two different directions and Harry was stuck in the middle, laying between a few metal barrels and a large wooden crate filled with marble.  One hand clenched against his side just below his vest, where blood was slowly leaking out, while the other held his gun.  He kept his head down and tried to block out the noise going on around him.  He was stuck and he couldn’t move without being gunned down as he felt out the power in the room.   </p><p>He didn’t know where Severus was since he’d lost him when the shooting had started.  He knew the man was still alive for every now and again he could feel the man's power touch on him.</p><p>A bullet whizzed past his head as he raised it slightly, he didn’t try that again.  He was stuck for now, unless something changed.</p><p>xXx</p><p><em>'Damn the boy,'</em> Severus thought as he ducked behind a large slab of marble.</p><p>He’d lost him in the confusion of the gunfight.  For all he knew he could be dead or dying and he wouldn’t know. He had to think of something that would end this fight and quickly. They were just lucky that they were only facing humans with little power.</p><p>After a few more minutes of shooting aimlessly and waiting for his back up to arrive, he noticed that one man standing away from the rest.  With a smirk he slipped around the shelf that he was hidden behind to get a better shot, once he was within range he took aim.  He slowly and smoothly pulled the trigger, with a loud bang the man went down with a cry.</p><p>Suddenly there were shouts on the air and the gunfire stopped, when the air cleared for a second. Severus caught sight of Harry hiding between some crates and barrels in the middle of the battleground.  The boy was slumped over slightly with one hand holding his side.  With a quick look around Severus dashed across the floor and to the teenager's side.</p><p>“Harry!” Severus hissed, dazed green eyes looked up at him under sweaty black bangs.  “Can you move?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry gasped, pulling himself into a crouch.</p><p>“Good,” Severus whispered, peering around their cover. </p><p>The others were still too busy with the man Severus had shot to pay attention to them. He smirked at the thought that he'd taken down the leader of the group but it wouldn't take long before they regrouped.</p><p>“Follow me,” Severus hissed over his shoulder before dashing across the floor. </p><p>He could feel Harry close on his heels and the boy’s breath on the back of his neck. Severus keep his eyes open and his gun out as they hurried through the mess of the warehouse as he kept his power close around them.  Suddenly sirens pierced the air making Severus pause.</p><p>“Keep going!” Harry exclaimed quietly.  “You don’t know who’s side they’re on!”</p><p>Severus nodded and kept going, keeping an eye out.  Suddenly Severus found himself on the warehouse floor with the lean body of Harry lying over his back and a gunshot ringing in his ears.  Severus shook his head as another louder gunshot rang out and something heavy fell to the ground a few feet away.</p><p>“Snape!  Get up!” Harry shouted in his ear as he tugged at his arm to get him moving again.</p><p>Severus stumbled to his feet and followed the younger man. Who seemed to know where to go better than Severus did, which grated on his nerves but the sharp look in the boy's eyes had him following without a word. He had to remind himself what the boy was and the skills he must have as Harry held his hand out and signalled to drop.</p><p>He crouched down and quickly wiped the blood away from his eyes from a cut above his right eye when his eye caught on something. Harry had been shot as the boy's eyes darted around taking everything in, the blood already soaking into his shirt. There was nothing he could do until they got somewhere safe as he quickly checked his gun and his spare clip.</p><p>Harry waved and he focused back on him as he signalled two to the right and then laid down on his stomach and wiggled forward. Severus watched his back as the man moved into place. His stomach clenched at the sight of the blood on the concrete but when Harry sighted along his gun, his hand didn't shake and he had to give the boy credit. Severus inched closer beside him as Harry glanced up and signalled to take the man to the left. He held a hand up then down in a cutting motion.</p><p>Two gunshots split the air as Severus and Harry fired their weapons, followed by one more and the three men blocking their way dropped. Severus quickly pulled back with the scent of gunpowder in his nose and went to dash forward until he noticed that Harry hadn't moved. Severus growled and grabbed the back of the man's shirt and pulled. He staggered slightly from the boy's weight and ignored the painfilled grunt as he pulled the man to his feet.</p><p>Harry staggered and blindly reached out and Severus grabbed him, until he got his feet under him. Harry shook his head slightly as the sounds of sirens grew louder. Severus cursed at him and dazed green eyes slowly focused on him until something seemed to come into those eyes and Severus shielded back slightly.</p><p>"This way," Harry whispered and slipped off with Severus on his heels.</p><p>Severus quickly grabbed his arm when the boy staggered and his gut clenched. He wasn't sure how long the man was going to be able to keep moving. With amount of blood that he could already see soaking into his shirt and pants, he was surprised that he was still on his feet.</p><p>"Give me your phone!" Harry hissed and Severus passed it over without a word.</p><p>They took cover in a back room and Harry leaned into a wall as he looked at his phone. Severus ignored the blood on the man's hands as he quickly dialled a number on his phone.</p><p>"It's me," Harry said into the phone. "L 5, ten minutes. Coming in hot from D 4."</p><p>Harry hung up the phone and held it out, his hand was shaking. Severus took it from him and pulled out a bandage with the other. Harry went to stand and Severus growled and pushed him back into the wall. Harry grunted and tried to push back against him until his glazed green eyes locked with his and he stilled.</p><p>"We need to bind that wound," Severus hissed. "Stop moving."</p><p>Harry gave him a glare and the breath caught in his throat as he remembered what he was dealing with. They were at a stalemate and Severus wasn't sure that he wanted to push the issue at that moment.</p><p>"We don't have time!" Harry hissed back.</p><p>"If we don't," Severus snapped, holding his ground. "You won't have time."</p><p>Harry gave him a hard look before nodding sharply. Severus pushed the man's shirt to the side and noticed the bullet had ripped into his side, just below the flak vest. One inch higher and it would have hit the vest instead it had hit just above his belt. Severus felt around the back but couldn't feel an exit wound and he cursed.</p><p>He quickly wrapped it as Harry kept an eye out as he worked with skill to stop some of the bleeding. He started as he felt a hand touch his face and his eyes darted up. Unreadable green eyes were locked onto him.</p><p>"Nice gash," Harry muttered, his words slightly slurred.</p><p>"It's nothing," Severus snapped and could see the other man's eyes close off.</p><p>Harry pulled his hand back as Severus stepped back and let his shirt fall. Harry gave him a nod and they set off with Harry in the led but Severus could see that the man wasn't steady on his feet. Severus tried to cover them with his power but he was stretching it by now and feeling the strain.</p><p>The sirens were piecing now as Harry led him further into the building and not out and he frowned. They should have been moving towards help not away and Harry's words came back to him. Who could they trust and could Severus trust the man in front of him and more. From his file Severus did wonder if he was making the right choice.</p><p>They made their way down into the basement level of the building and Severus frown deepened. Harry stepped towards a back wall and tried to push a shelf to the side but just fell against it instead. Harry stumbled into the shelf and almost fell. Severus jumped forward to grab his shoulder and held him in place.</p><p>Harry tried to push against him but failed.</p><p>"Need to move," Harry slurred. "Tunnel."</p><p>Severus easily pushed the man to the side and crouched down and pushed against the shelf to see an opening behind it. He pushed until he could slip through and was surprised to see a room on the other side.</p><p>He slipped back through and his breath caught in his throat when he found Harry slumped against the wall with his eyes closed. He dived forward and grabbed the man's shoulder and shook it roughly. Glazed green eyes looked up at him with a slight wildness to them.</p><p>"Move!" Severus barked and pushed on him. "Now!"</p><p>Harry moved, his movements uncoordinated as Severus grabbed him. He pushed and growled threats at the man until he was into the other room. Severus shifted the shelf back into place behind them.</p><p>He hauled the man up and felt chilled when Harry didn't fight against him. He slung the man's arm over his shoulders as he pulled him down into a tunnel that may have been servant's entrance. Harry's panting breaths were loud in his ears as they stumbled along.</p><p>"Go to end," Harry panted. "Go right, then left. Car waiting. Code word Calvin."</p><p>Severus felt chilled at the man's words, if he was telling him this. He wasn't expecting to be awake to tell the person waiting and by how heavy the man was getting. Severus could tell that might be the case.</p><p>"If you pass out!" Severus hissed as he pulled the man's arm further over his shoulders. "You will not be able to sit near the window for a week!"</p><p>Harry snorted as he leaned into him further and his steps became more staggered as they made it out of the building and Severus took them to the right. He could tell that Harry was trying to stay with him and he started when he heard something clatter to the ground. The man's gun had slipped from his hand, Severus left it there. He couldn't pick it up without losing his grip on the other man, as they turned to their left and there was a car waiting.</p><p>A man quickly jumped out of the car with a gun in his hand and a hard look in his pale eyes. Severus knew who he was from his file and he shivered as Sirius Black, the Potter family head enforcer, rushed towards him with smooth strides and the feral feel of his power proceeding him.</p><p>"I lost his gun, just back there." Severus snapped as he pushed down on his own power, it wouldn't help him here.</p><p>The man nodded and quickly moved back the way they had come as Severus stumbled towards the car. Harry slipping further down as he pulled the door open and pushed the man inside. Harry collapsed to his side over the back seat, his panting breaths loud in the small space as Severus pushed on him to get him further over. He paused when he heard a click and felt the cold barrel of a gun placed against the back of his head.</p><p>"Calvin," Severus said smoothly.</p><p>"Get in," The man hissed. "You try anything and I'll kill you."</p><p>Severus was in no doubt that the dark-haired man would do just that. Severus managed to push Harry until he could get in beside him and quickly pulled his shirt away to see the bandage was already soaked through with blood. He looked up when he heard swearing as Black looked over at them.</p><p>"We'll need a healer," Black said quickly as he pulled the car out.</p><p>Severus didn't respond as he pulled out bandages and potions to try and stop the bleeding. Harry watched him with half lidded eyes and Severus wasn't sure if the man was aware of what was going on around him. He tuned Black out as the man spoke on the phone with someone and tried not to shiver as the man's power touched on him in the small space. The man driving the car was beyond dangerous, there was a reason that he was the Potter family key enforcer. Severus just focused on Harry as he cleaned back the wound and tried not to think about the situation that he was now in.</p><p>"Close it," Harry whispered, referring to the bullet wound. "Stop bleeding."</p><p>Severus looked up at the man in surprise and could see the slight shift in his eyes. He hadn't felt any power around him the whole time he'd been around him and still couldn't now, but he knew better. The Potter family had power but it came at a price. Severus nodded sharply and tipped the potion over the wound and it hissed as it closed. He had just enough time to grab the other man before he went limp as he passed out.</p><p>"What the fuck did you do!" Black snapped.</p><p>"What he asked," Severus bit back, his own temper rising.</p><p>Black growled, an animalistic sound that almost had Severus whimpering until the other man focused back on the road. Severus settled Harry into the seat as much as he could and clicked his seat belt in. The air in the car felt thick as they drove along and Severus leaned back in his seat. The pain from his own injuries seeped into his mind and his head pounded.</p><p>He hadn't realised he's slipped into sleep until a hand grabbed his shoulder and gave him a rough shake. Waking him with a start as another hand pushed his gun away with a growl and Severus froze. The pale eyes of the man before him, locked onto him and Severus would have pulled back if he didn't notice that Harry wasn't beside him. Severus lunged forward and the other man grabbed his arm tightly as he staggered from the car, his eyes darting around for his charge.</p><p>"Whoa," Black snapped and pulled him back.</p><p>Severus lashed out and Black clipped him one to the side of the head and Severus went down hard with a grunt. The other man's power flaring as his head rang from the blow.</p><p>"Sirius!"</p><p>Both men froze to look over at a brushy haired woman in tight jeans and an even tighter shirt stalked towards them. Severus scrambled to his feet while Black was distracted and his eyes darted around the rundown warehouse they were in.</p><p>"He's in the room at the end of the warehouse," The woman stated calmly and Severus shivered as her power touched on him. "Hurry up and I'll look you over as well before Sirius does even more damage."</p><p>"He's all yours," Black hissed before moving back to the car.</p><p>"Follow me, Severus Snape." The woman offered with a smile and Severus tensed.</p><p>The woman kept walking and didn't even bother looking over her shoulder to see if he was following. Severus took offense at that as he looked around but quickly worked out that he didn't have much choice and followed after the woman. He reached up and touched the side of his face and was sure he was going to have a nice bruise there.</p><p>He followed after the woman as she walked into the room at the back of the warehouse. He hurried forward when he saw Harry sprawled out on the old lounge with only his pants on and his shirt and vest beside him on the ground. He could see the bruises on the man's pale skin and could tell that the bullet to the hip wasn't the only one that had hit the man, but at least his vest had caught the other bullets before they could rip into him. Severus had to admit that even with the bullet wound, Harry had been very lucky.</p><p>He knelt down beside the sleeping man and reached out with his hand and brushed his power over him before pulling it back. He felt like, in a way, he'd failed him but at least he was still alive. He just wasn't sure what would happen now. He was now surrounded by Potter's men and away from any help from his department. He wasn't sure if they would be as willing to let Harry go back into his custody. Severus also knew that there was nothing he could do if they wanted to keep Harry here.</p><p>"Your potion healed over the wound." The woman remarked as she took a seat beside the lounge and crossed her legs. "I had to slice the wound back open to get the bullet out."</p><p>"He wanted it closed," Severus replied and looked over at the healer.</p><p>"Yes, he was losing too much blood." The woman said calmly. "Hermione Granger, by the way."</p><p>The woman held out her hand and Severus hesitated before taking it. He felt her power rush over him and he tried to pull his hand back but she had clamped down on his hand. He froze as the healing magic washed over him and he felt shaky before she pulled her power back and released him.</p><p>"Stay here," Hermione offered with a smile as she got to her feet. "He should be out for about an hour. You can move then, Sirius is going to leave you the car. We have to go now before they track our power."</p><p>Severus didn't know if he should thank the woman or not as he sat on his ass on the floor beside the lounge, still recovering from the rough healing. The woman took that out of his hands as she smiled and gave him a nod before leaving. Severus just sat there for a few minutes as his eyes roamed over the man beside him before he pulled himself to his feet and went looking for a bathroom.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry woke slowly, feeling sick in the pit of his stomach so he knew that someone had used healing magic on him. He groaned as he rolled carefully onto his side and tried to will his stomach to settle. He closed his eyes again and felt out with his power and could tell that it had been Hermione that had healed him and that was why he wasn't throwing up…yet.</p><p>Which was the up side, the down side was that she would have healed him just enough so that he wasn't bleeding out any more. He carefully blinked his eyes open and looked around the bare room that he was in. He was alone and he frowned. Where was Severus?</p><p>He was sure that Sirius and Hermione would have left as quickly as they could but Severus should still be around. He carefully sat up on the lounge then cupped his head as his stomach rolled but it stayed where it was supposed to.</p><p>"And where would you be going?" Severus drawled.</p><p>Harry opened his eyes and looked up at the man in the doorway and could feel Hermione's magic around the other man. Severus had cleaned up but Harry could still see blood on his shirt and pants. He wasn't the only one that had been injured in the attack but at least Hermione would have been able to heal Severus completely.</p><p>"Nowhere," Harry muttered as he tried to get his stomach under control.</p><p>Severus gave him a look over before moving further into the room. The man pulled a gun and Harry tensed before noticing that it was his and the man held it out to him, hilt first. Harry reached out and grabbed the familiar weapon and checked the clip.</p><p>"I loaded it for you," Severus commented. "Your…friend, left you the car and some other toys."</p><p>Severus made the word friend sound like a curse word. Harry was sure that Sirius temper must have gotten the best of him from the look in Severus's eyes.</p><p>"Thank you," Harry replied softly.</p><p>Severus's eyes were dark as Harry slowly reached out and snagged up his vest and shirt before pulling them on. Severus's eyes caught on the bandages wound around his stomach with a frown.</p><p>"Did she not heal you completely?" Severus asked.</p><p>"No," Harry replied shortly, the less the other man knew the better.</p><p>"And why would that be?" Severus drawled. "She was happy to almost knock me out with her healing."</p><p>Harry looked over at him sharply.</p><p>"She would have been in a hurry," Harry remarked, not answering Severus's question. "The longer they were here, the bigger the chance that Riddle would have picked up on them."</p><p>"But not you?" Severus asked with a frown. "He can't pick up on you?"</p><p>"No," Harry replied as he left his shirt open at the front. "Even still, we should be leaving and soon."</p><p>Harry carefully got to his feet with the help of the lounge and stood still as his stomach decided what it wanted to do. He started when Severus grabbed his shoulder and looked up at the man. Dark eyes were looking him over and Harry was sure that he was picking out anything that would slow them down, more than in concern.</p><p>"I have a safe house lined up," Severus stated as he stepped back and Harry placed his gun in his holster. "It's a bit of a distance away from here, so you can sleep in the back of the car."</p><p>"Okay," Harry consented then paused. "Is there a bathroom?"</p><p>"Two doors down," Severus answered. "Are you going to be sick?"</p><p>"Yes," Harry replied. "I'll meet you at the car. Sirius would have left us supplies."</p><p>Harry carefully walked off to find the bathroom. He could feel Severus's dark eyes on his back the whole way.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Severus watched Harry limping towards him slowly with a frown. The file on the man was thin, he was the youngest son of James and Lily Potter and yet that was about all they knew about him. He had first come to the attention of the police, five months ago, when he had walked into their office and offered to testify against the Riddle family. He had then handed over a file containing more information on the Riddle family than they had been able to gather over the last two years that they had been investigating them.</p><p>The whole department had been in shock and were unsure what to do with him. They had used the information that the man had supplied, to start bringing down the Riddle family and that's when the attempts on the boy's life had started. Severus's boss wanted to use Harry to turn on his father and bring the Potter family down as well but Severus knew that wouldn't happen.</p><p>Harry's oldest brother, Daniel ran most of the Potter family business in England while James oversaw their affairs overseas. They had known about Harry Potter but as far as they knew; the man didn't have anything to do with the family business.</p><p>Severus focused back on Harry as he slowly moved towards him and he wondered why the healer hadn't healed him completely. That was another thing, they didn't know what kind of power he held. That's what had made moving on the Riddle and Potter families so hard, they had to know what they were up against and Harry had supplied that information on the Riddle family. Every person and the power they held and what type of blood they had.</p><p>Harry paused when he came close enough and Severus looked him over from his place, leaning against the side of the car. Harry didn't shift under his glaze or turn away. He met him head on, the man had a back bone for his young age.</p><p>"Ready to go?" Severus purred.</p><p>"When you are," Harry countered.</p><p>Severus looked down his nose at the younger man. He looked pale and Severus could pick up the slight shake in his hand, even if he didn't show any other signs of weakness.</p><p>"Will you be throwing up in the car?" Severus questioned lightly.</p><p>"I'm sure that Sirius has left me something to throw up in, to save the car." Harry replied mildly and shifted his weight and winced slightly.</p><p>"Does healing make you sick?" Severus asked with a frown.</p><p>"Yes," Harry said shortly.</p><p>Severus frowned, that wasn't normal.</p><p>"Are you a healer?" Severus questioned and the man's lips quirked up.</p><p>"We should get going," Harry remarked as he stepped towards the back of the car.</p><p>Severus didn't move and Harry raised an eyebrow in question. The boy looked younger close up, except his eyes. There was age in his eyes and he wondered if the eighteen years they believed the man to be was correct. They had no record of his birth to rely on.</p><p>"What is it?" Harry asked and Severus could see the shake in the man's hands was worse even if he didn't give away any other signs of fatigue.</p><p>Severus moved out of his way and Harry opened the car door and slipped in. Severus slipped into the driver's side and they were pulling out onto the deserted streets. Severus soon had the windows rolled down to get rid of the smell of Harry throwing up.</p><p>xXx</p><p>"How was the drive?" Albus Dumbledore, his boss, questioned over the phone.</p><p>"No problems," Severus answered as he glanced over at Harry sprawled out on his back on the bed.</p><p>The man had collapsed the minute that he'd came through the door, even if he'd slept for most of the way in the car. Severus could see that he was in pain even in his sleep by the frown on his face.</p><p>"Did you say that two of Potter's men came to your aid?" Albus questioned again.</p><p>"Yes," Severus confirmed. "Sirius Black and Hermione Granger. Harry called them from off my phone."</p><p>"We'll have the number then," Albus commented. "They came to his aid quickly. We first believed that he'd cut ties with his family when he came to us."</p><p>"Clearly that is not the case," Severus drawled.</p><p>"Yes," Albus agreed. "Did you get any idea of what kind of power he holds?"</p><p>"No," Severus answered quietly and stepped out of the room to check the doors and windows. "Healing makes him sick and I still can't feel anything from him."</p><p>"You know what he is. He must have some kind of power?"</p><p>"Yes," Severus confirmed. "He just hasn't shown it, yet."</p><p>"Even when both your lives were on the line?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Albus went silent as Severus checked the back door of the house.</p><p>"Tom Riddle has gone to ground," Albus said after a few minutes. "Can you ask Mr Potter if he knows where he might have gone?"</p><p>"I'll ask him when he wakes," Severus consented. "Is that all Albus?"</p><p>"Yes, stay safe," Albus replied.</p><p>"Good night, Albus."</p><p>"Good night, Severus."</p><p>Severus hung up the phone before pulling his gun and slipping out the back door. He paced around the house to the markers that he'd placed to give him an early warning to people around.</p>
