    <p>Ron felt his heart pounding in his throat as he slowly moved towards his target. His hand could almost touch...</p><p>“Excellent save, Weasley!” Seamus exclaimed as he and Dean stepped into the changing room, fist bumping the redhead as Seamus wrestled himself out of his Quidditch gear. “I bet this has to be Slytherin’s darkest day. Well, second to Noseless’s demise of course.”</p><p>Ron smiled nervously as his eyes slowly travelled back to...</p><p>“Ron, is everything alright?” Dean asked, extracting a high-pitch shriek from Ron’s mouth. “You look a bit... “</p><p>“Like something is stuck up your arse,” Seamus interrupted, laughing the hardest about his joke. “I think Weasley is in love.”</p><p>“I’m not!” Ron bellowed, his eyes flaming with sudden anger.</p><p>“Easy, easy,” Dean said, trying to calm down Ron.</p><p>“Sorry,” Ron mumbled, making an apology-gesture with his hand. “I don’t know what’s gotten into me.”</p><p>“Forget about it,” Seamus said light-heartedly, while stripping to his underwear. “But one advice from a friend? You really need a shag. And you need it fucking yesterday.”</p><p>“I know Seamus can be a senseless prick sometimes,” Dean said as Seamus made his way to the showers. “But I think he has a point. How long has it been since you and Hermione... “</p><p>“Six months, fifteen days, 3 hours aaaand... “ Ron checked his watch. “Three minutes.”</p><p>“Wow,” Dean said, visibly trying to keep a straight face. “Someone has studied his maths.”</p><p>“I still recognize sarcasm, you know,” Ron snapped. “I dated the master.”</p><p>“Try to open up a bit, mate,” Dean said as he took a towel out of a cupboard. “You don’t want to die a hermit.”</p><p>“Opening up,” Ron whispered to himself. “Even a hermit deserves some pleasure.” And as soon Dean joined their teammates in the showers, Ron’s hand slipped into Harry’s holdall.</p><p> </p><p>~*~</p><p> </p><p>A heady, unique scent entered Ron’s nostrils, travelling towards his brain, creating such intoxicating images that Ron’s hand couldn’t keep up. He stroked himself hard and fast, his cock deliciously warm and throbbing in his hand as the head wept profusely.</p><p>“Merlin, Harry,” Ron brought out, his eyes closed and biting his lip, trying to prevent an early finish. “I wish you were right now. I would pull down your boxers and... fuck... I would suck your cock... fuck yeah... I would suck and lick... wanna come, baby... holy shit... shoot your load in my mo... FUCK!!”</p><p>Ron opened his eyes in a reflex and realised he wasn’t alone anymore...</p><p>“Harry! Fucking hell... I... Harry, could you stop looking? I... “</p><p>“I wondered where my briefs had gone to,” Harry said, almost unnaturally calm like they were having a conversation about the weather. “And here they are. Right under your nose.”</p><p>“Harry, please,” Ron mumbled, feeling exposed and extremely humiliated. “I didn’t... “</p><p>“Did it smell nice?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Did-it-smell-nice?” Harry’s lips curled into an unfamiliar grin, making Ron both uncomfortable and aroused.</p><p>“I... “</p><p>“You of all people should know that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.”</p><p>Harry’s smile grew and Ron’s cock swelled. The redhead opened his mouth, but Harry silenced him by placing his index finger on Ron’s lips.</p><p>“Don’t speak,” Harry whispered into Ron’s ear. “Let me finish what you started. Please?”</p><p>A short groan left Ron’s mouth and Harry dropped to his knees.</p><p>“I take that as a <em>yes</em>,” Harry said hoarsely from below. He grabbed Ron’s cock at the base and stroked him wickedly slow until he arrived at the wet head. A drop of pre-come fell from the slit and with the agility of an experienced Seeker, Harry caught it with his tongue. A low hum escaped Harry’s mouth, sending a tremor of pleasure through Ron’s rigid rod.</p><p>“I bet there’s more where that came from,” Harry purred, speeding up his strokes. “I want your come, Ron. All over me.”</p><p>Ron moaned loudly as Harry’s experienced hand activated tiny sensations at the base of his cock, an increasing itchy throb that grew and grew with each stroke. Harry’s filthy mouth did something to him. It made Ron... lose control. And he fucking liked it.</p><p>Ron looked down and saw Harry opening his mouth as he stroked him so fast that his hand became a blur. “Give it to me, Ronald. Give it to me now!”</p><p>And Ron was done. His climax washed over him like a tsunami, decorating Harry’s face, glasses and mouth with thick spurts of come. Harry’s tongue repeatedly darted out of his mouth, like a frog trying to grab a fly, catching as much spunk as possible.</p><p>“Ron, you taste like strawberries,” Harry groaned as he dropped himself next to his exhausted lover on the bed. “Delicious. Like you.”</p><p>Ron opened his mouth, his ears bright red, as he tried to form words, but Harry completed him, swollen lips melting together.</p><p>“Harry,” Ron gasped between sensual, deep kisses. “We have to talk about... <em>this</em>.“</p><p>“We definitely should,” Harry replied. “But can that wait after, and I quote:  I shoot my load in your mouth?”</p>
