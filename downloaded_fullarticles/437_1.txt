    <p>The Big Bad </p><p>Chapter 1 </p><p>“I’m really starting to not like this idea, sounds kind of dangerous,” Isaac muttered as he paced through the darkened room, the wall high windows letting in enough light to reflect the fear that Isaac felt on his face more clearly. Turning around he paced back the other way, “You know what? I definitely don’t like this idea, and I definitely don’t like him.” he added, pointing an accusing finger at Derek, who was paying very little attention to him as he read the book in his hands.  </p><p>“You’ll be fine,” Derek said, barely refraining from rolling his eyes, teenagers, he’d regret his actions if not for the fact he would never wish away pack. They were his pack, and he had already lost Erica and Boyd, he was doing everything he could to find them but so far failing spectacularly. It was almost as if they had faded from the face of the earth. He couldn’t find a hint of their scent, he had no idea where the Alpha pack was to get them back. </p><p>Isaac looked out the window before sighing and turning to face Derek, “Does it have to be him?” he complained, truthfully Isaac had only heard of the things Peter Hale had done. He hadn’t been around for what had transpired before. He trusted Scott though, so if Scott didn’t trust Peter then he wasn’t going to either. </p><p>“He knows how to do it. I don’t.” Derek stated without looking at him, “It would be more dangerous if I do it myself.” </p><p>“You know Scott doesn’t trust him, right?” Isaac said, “Well, I’d trust Scott.” He was worried about what was about to happen, mostly because in the deep recesses of his mind…he didn’t want to remember. </p><p>“Do you trust me?” Derek asked, finally looking at Isaac again, a serious look on his face. </p><p>“Yeah,” Isaac replied without pause, he really did trust his Alpha. </p><p>“I still don’t like him,” Isaac murmured almost petulantly when he realized this was going to happen no matter what. </p><p>“Nobody likes him,” Derek replied dryly, only to glance up with a resigned look when the door opened emitting the werewolf in question they had been talking about. </p><p>“Boys, FYI, yes, coming back from the dead has left my abilities somewhat impaired, but the hearing still works.” Peter drawled as he entered the room at a casual pace, “So I hope you’re comfortable saying whatever it is to my face.” </p><p>“We don’t like you,” Derek stated standing up, the book snapping closed and discarded on the table, “Now shut up and help us,” </p><p>“Fair enough,” Peter said unsheathing his claws with a wicked gleam in his eye, “Relax I’ll get more out of you if you’re calm.” He informed the teenager sitting on the chair waiting, looking as though his own execution was on the cards. </p><p>“How do you know how to do this, again?” Isaac asked, unable to sit still, anxiety mixing with fear but he never lost his ironclad control. </p><p>“It’s an ancient ritual used mostly by Alphas, since it’s a skill that requires quite a bit of practice. One slip and you could paralyze someone.” Peter informed him, his tone educational, but the way he spoke was utterly taunting as he absently tried to decide which claw to use. “Or kill them,” he added ignoring Derek who actually looked concerned, albeit a constipated kind of concern. Peter knew Derek wouldn’t change his mind, his nephew hadn’t changed the least in six years…well except physically of course. </p><p>“But you’ve had a lot of practice, though, right?” Isaac felt his panic surge, the thought of being paralyzed was terrifying, part of him wanted to run. Yet he wanted his pack mates back, he’d do anything he could for them. Even if it meant remembering something he knew deep down he didn’t want to remember. </p><p>“Well, I’ve never paralyzed anyone.” Peter informed the teen, waiting to see if he would realize what he meant. </p><p>“Wait does that mean…” Isaac didn’t get a chance to finish his sentence, as Peter grasped a hold of him, an arm around his chest, the other was biting into his neck, allowing Peter to see Isaac’s memories. </p><p>Both of them oblivious to Derek who watched the scene visibly alarmed. </p><p>Only when Derek jumped to his feet did Peter speak, “Wait I see them,” as if he felt that Derek was about to disengage the connection that had sprung up between himself and Isaac. </p><p>Peter watched everything he could glean from Isaac, his body spasming as he tried to decipher what the hell he was seeing. Then when a familiar face came into view, Peter jerked himself away from Isaac, not that he could say he was surprised by it, not truly, since he knew the Alpha pack was here. He’d understood that from the second he’d set his eyes upon the sign adorning what was once his family home. A home he had grown up in with his family then his sisters family. Grunting he moved away from both Isaac and Derek, knowing this news wasn’t what they wanted.  </p><p>“What did you see?” Derek asked staring intently at the back of his uncles head. </p><p>Peter meanwhile breathed heavily in front of the stone wall, trying to regain his footing after the disconcerting feeling of perusing through hazy memories. “It was confusing.” He admitted, still feeling as though he’d been put through the wringer. “Um, imagines. Vague shapes.” Mentally mapping out what he’d seen hoping he was wrong. </p><p>“But you saw something.” Derek didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not. </p><p>“Isaac found them.” Peter admitted, still staring at the wall, hiding just how worried he was. </p><p>“Erica and Boyd?” Derek questioned, feeling hope again for the first time in months. </p><p>“I barely saw them. I mean, glimpses.” Peter replied. </p><p> “But you did see them.” Derek stated more firmly. </p><p>“And worse.” Peter admitted, rattled to the bones. </p><p>“Deucalion,” Derek stated, it was the only thing that could cause the fear he could clearly see on his uncles face which was now facing him. </p><p>“He was talking to them. Something about time running out.” Peter added, watching his nephew sink back down on his seat the wind taken from his sail. The hope he’d so blatantly held on to diminishing almost completely. </p><p>“What does it mean?” Isaac asked, looking worried, the scent of the two terrified werewolves didn’t help him the slightest. Glancing at Derek silently begging for answers. </p><p>“He’s going to kill them.” Derek finally told Isaac eyeing Peter, anger warring with fear for his two Beta’s. </p><p>“No, no, no, no he didn’t say that.” Peter told them, as his mind catalogued everything he’d heard and seen. “He did make them a promise that by the full moon they’d both be dead.” </p><p>“The next full moon?” Derek repeated his brows furrowing together, worry gnawing at his gut. </p><p>Peter turned once again to stare at Derek resignedly, “Tomorrow night,” </p><p>Derek closed his eyes, he had five Alphas to deal with…and only himself, Isaac and Scott on his side. </p><p>“We’re not going to win this are we?” Isaac asked, bordering on hysterical, it didn’t help that neither Peter or Derek smelt anywhere near hopeful. </p><p>“There is someone we could call to help,” Peter admitted, turning around entirely too pensive. </p><p>Derek jerked his head up to look at his uncle, “Why haven’t you mentioned this before?” Derek growled in annoyance. </p><p>“Because he’s absolutely terrifying,” Peter replied his tone bone dry. “He’s something of an anomaly,” and he didn’t like things he couldn’t understand. </p><p>“What is that supposed to mean?” Derek demanded. </p><p>“He’s a werewolf, who also has the ability to use magic,” Peter explained, Isaac looked confused while Derek’s eyes widened in disbelief. You either had the one or the other, nobody was both it was impossible. “It’s magic unlike anything I’ve ever seen, he can also transform into a wolf…and his eyes….” Peter paused. </p><p>“Who is he?” Derek asked, they knew of the Demon Wolf, but he’d never heard of anyone like Peter was describing and wasn’t sure whether to believe it or not. “Why haven’t I heard of him before?” </p><p>“He has helped us in the past,” Peter refuted, “You must have been eleven years old, the first time you were attacked by hunters, your mom was gone brokering peace with a pack in Alaska taking your father and Laura…I barely got there in time, got us both holed up before he appeared, I’m not sure if he was who they were looking for or not…but by the time he was finished the ten hunters were dead, and he didn’t have a single injury. He teleported, he was capable of appearing behind them before they knew what was happening. He waved his hand and the bodies, blood and gore was gone as if it never happened.” Derek had seen nothing of that incident, and seemed to bounce back…certainly quicker than the second time he was attacked by hunters, and they’d definitely been after him that time. </p><p>Derek’s eyes widened, when he remembered the incident Peter was talking about. He hadn’t seen anything but he had heard the strange sounds, like a gun on a silencer, continuous pops. He’d barely caught sight of the hunters and dodged the bullets before Peter was there and getting them to safety. They had little niches all around Beacon Hills that were filled with food and drink so they could wait out the hunters before heading home. He wasn’t sure how many of them were still there, he hadn’t checked, plus he hadn’t been aware of them all. Peter had been weird when he came back in, quiet in a way his Uncle never was. The underlying scent…he suddenly remembered, awe, disbelief, shock and fear. </p><p>“Then he turned to stare at me, his eyes flashed purple and he disappeared while I watched,” Peter finished, and that was just the first time he saw him. </p><p>“Who is he?” Derek asked, his mind latching onto the only hope he might have to save his pack. </p><p>Peter glanced up, eyes supernatural blue, “Harry Potter,” he uttered ominously.</p>
