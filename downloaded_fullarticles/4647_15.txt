    <p>They lost.</p><p>After all the battling, planning and sacrifices.</p><p>They still lost.</p><p>With a grunt of pain, a 22yr old male is thrown on the ground. Dull, pain filled Emerald eyes glance around at the figures surrounding his beaten body, “Awwww, all done already? Must be getting weak in your old age,”</p><p>There is a slight murmur from one of the figures and a sickly red color of a cutting curse shoots out and cuts deep across his neck. Eyes widen as he gasps and chokes as he is left to bleed to death right there on the ground. The group just stands and waits for the light to fade in emerald eyes and watch with no emotion as Harry Potter lets out a last breath.</p><p>A tall figure enters the domed room, causing those in there to kneel down and comment in obedience and reverence, “Master,”</p><p>Lord Voldemort steps closer to the dead body of the boy-who-lived and sighs out in mock regret, “Harry, Harry, I see you still haven’t learned,” The Dark Lord no longer looks snake-like, but more like the man he was back before his disastrous meeting with the 15 month old, “Even after all this time. You still are so defiant,” He runs a slender finger over the top of a rapidly healing cut, “No matter, I will be done with you soon enough and I won’t have to worry about you ever again,”</p><p>“Master,” A new voice speaks up and a newcomer steps past the still kneeling Death Eaters and bows. Both of them are ignoring the now twitching body and the sudden intake of air from the once dead body, “Everything is all set,”</p><p>Deep red eyes glance up at the new arrival, “Good, we will be there momentarily,” The Death Eater gives a curt ‘sir’ before leaving back the way he came, “Did you catch that Harry? It’s time for this...nonsense to be finished,”</p><p>“Nonsense huh?” Harry rasps out, coughing out and some blood flies out past lips, “Is that what you’re calling this now Tom? Can’t handle your jealousy anymore?” Lips curl back in a sneer at his hideous muggle name and Voldemort strikes out and his slap sends Harry’s head to jerk to the side and for the re-alive boy to chuckle out, “Careful Tom, your mugglenish is showing,”</p><p>The Dark Lord growls out as he stands up and sends a violent kick to the mocking boy’s middle before pulling out his wand and casts out Crucio. Harry twists and thrashes as the spell burns through him, yet he doesn’t let any sound escape past his lips. After a few moments the curse is cancelled and Harry’s body falls limp, his body twitching from the after effects. With another sneer Voldemort turns, “Bring him,”</p><p>The levitation spell is cast and Harry’s body is lift up in the air and floats behind the group of Death Eaters. Emerald Eyes part open slightly upon feeling a slight touch of fingers and they shift up to the owner of said fingers. Deep Blue eyes stare down at him and Harry’s lips twitch in a half grin, “Hey there,”</p><p>Blue eyes slide over, making sure no one is looking back, and slides a hand size pouch into a pants pocket. Eyebrows scrunch up in confusion at the action of his...handler. “Kyle?” The Death Eater doesn’t say a thing, he just trails his fingertips across Harry’s cheek before turning sharply and enters a side passage.</p><p>Harry floats into a room he’s all too familiar with - the Department of Mysteries. Emerald eyes take in all the Death Eater’s in attendance, the familiar figure of Kyle is spotted near the back, and there - in the center of the room - is the Veil. A small tendril of dread worms its way into him as he is piecing together what Voldemort has in store and why Kyle took the chance to slip him that pouch.</p><p>Red eyes watch with glee as they see understanding flicker across his nemesis’s face, “I see you are understanding your plight. We are stuck at a stand still, you and I. I can not kill you and I can't take the chance of keeping you around,” Slender fingers run across the faded lightning bolt scar and grins as the grimace of pain the flashes across Harry’s face, “So, what better way to get rid of someone who can't die then to throw them into the Death Veil itself,”</p><p>“You could just up and die yourself,” Harry quips back and chuckles slightly after the unsurprising backhand across his face. Voldemort sniffs in disgust as he steps back away from the still floating Boy-Who-Just-Won’t-Die and motions for his followers to continue, “Goodbye Harry Potter, may we never meet again,”</p><p>Harry shoots him a bloody, toothy grin that causes some Death Eaters to shift in discomfort, “Goodbye Tom Riddle, may you enjoy your life till Death comes to claim it. There is no escape from it, no matter how hard you try to flee from it <em> Voldemort </em>,”</p><p>Voldemort’s cry of outrage is like music to Harry’s ears as he is pushed the rest of the way into The Veil and darkness surrounds him. Emerald eyes stare around at the endless darkness and realizing that there is no more magic holding him, he spreads his limbs out in relief. He shifts so he is in a sitting position and reaches for the pouch that Kyle slipped him.</p><p>First thing to be brought out is the Elder Wand and dread fills Harry’s heart as he reaches into the seemingly bottomless bag and feels for two specific items. Sure enough he pulls out the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak and the dread morphs to deep sorrow as pain shoots through his chest, “Damn it Kyle, he’ll kill you,”</p><p>Harry reaches back into the pouch and fingers feel a roll of parchment and, once in his grasp, pulls it out of the bag. Unrolling it to see that it is a note from Kyle and Emerald eyes scan through the message once just to go back and reread it a few more times. Tears well up and spill over onto sunken cheeks as a hand covers his mouth and the other crinkles the note and brings it to his chest as Harry curls up into himself. Breathing hitches as he tries to swallow the sobs that rise up to overwhelm him. However, once the tears were allowed free, it sealed his fate and Harry soon starts sobbing loudly and therapeutically as all the pent up sorrow from the past years is finally released.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>A cloaked figure appears next to a now unconscious Harry and a pale, slim hand reaches down and brushes through the brown locks, tucking some behind an ear. Fingertips trace the obvious tear tracks before moving up to the scar marring Harry’s forehead. A nail glows a faint purplish color and grows to a sharpen point before being plunged into the skin and a faint scream is heard as black smoke billows out of the scar.</p><p>Once the smoke is gone, the nail is pulled out and the lightning bolt scar now looks like any normal scar - old and faded. Hands replace the four items back into the pouch and the pouch back into the pants before a wave of a hand has the tattered clothes repair themselves. Another wave has shoes and socks appear on Harry’s feet as well as a soft hoodie to appear on his torso. Satisfied with their work, the cloaked figure once again runs fingers through the soft hair before cupping a cheek.</p><p>“Take care Master,” The voice that speaks has no discernible tone and both male and female voices seem to be speaking at the same time, “Till we meet again,”</p><p>The figure disappears as a swirling vortex of black, purple and white flecks appears and sucks Harry into it.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The first thing Harry notices as he slowly comes to, is that gravity is once again a thing, followed by a lightness in his chest. All the pain and sorrow is still there, but the burden of it has been eased greatly.</p><p>Emerald eyes squint open and immediately start to water as sunlight hits them. Blinking rapidly - to clear the tears and to get used to the light - Harry turns his head to see his surroundings and freezes in shock.</p><p>Right there, standing next to him, is a Wooly Mammoth. Harry rubs at his eyes, trying to make the image to go away, but unfortunately it does not. The fur covered trunk swings and is soon running over his still prone body, sniffing him, “Well, shit,” </p>
