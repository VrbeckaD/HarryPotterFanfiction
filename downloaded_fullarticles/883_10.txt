    <p>"Potter, get in here!"</p><p>Harry groaned. He really did <em>not </em>need this, but when your boss called you into his office in that tone, you didn't get much choice. He had just been about to leave when he'd heard the shout. He was starving, he was exhausted, and he was already late to meet Draco for dinner at some fancy restaurant, but he couldn't avoid this. He shot off a quick Patronus to his boyfriend informing him of the delay, then resigned himself to an even crappier night and prepared for the right bollocking he was about to receive.</p><p>As he entered the office and closed the door, Head Auror Robards simply sat behind his desk and stared at him, looking very unhappy. Well, at least Harry wasn't the only one feeling disgruntled with the day's events. Harry stood at attention, hoping his not taking a seat would hurry the lecture along.</p><p>"Good evening, sir. I've just finished the last of the paperwork on the Winters case, such as it is. I also put in my report a request for reprimand for Auror Collins, as his behaviour was inexcusable."</p><p>"Exactly, Potter. It was inexcusable, and he's under your command. As Senior Auror, you are responsible for the performance of your team members, and that includes this cock-up. Their behaviour reflects on yours, and I can<em> not </em>have people questioning your ability to lead. You have a good track record, and obviously, your history being what it is, I've been able to quell most of the concerns about making you a Senior Auror at such a young age, but that means you are under much closer scrutiny."</p><p>Harry was horrified. "Sir! I do <em>not </em>wish special treatment, and I thought I'd made that very clear over the years. If my position is being questioned-"</p><p>"Shut up, Potter, and don't be stupid. Of course, you get special treatment, but that doesn't mean you didn't deserve the damned position. I gave you the position because you earned it. I got it approved because of who you are. But people are watching you, just like they always have, and you are expected to perform accordingly. You are a stellar Auror, an amazing leader, and you're absolute rubbish at paperwork, but you delegate that task well. You're one of my best men. Or women. People. One of my best <em>people </em>." He paused and muttered under his breath. "Fuck, I'll never get that one right."</p><p>Harry relaxed marginally. "Thank you, sir."</p><p>Robards sighed heavily and leaned back in his chair. He suddenly looked older than Harry was used to seeing him.</p><p>"Listen, Harry. I have five more years, then I have every intention of running off to some quiet island in the Caribbean for the rest of my days. I'm looking to train someone to replace me, and Kingsley and I both have our eye on you. You'd be the youngest Head Auror in memory, but it shouldn't be a problem getting it approved, given who you are..." He glared at Harry. "...as long as you don't let little trolls like Collins ruin it for you."</p><p>Harry was speechless. To be Head Auror, to be able to make a bigger difference, to form the direction of the department and ensure the high standards he believed in were met across the department? To make certain that fair play and decency were standard? It was an amazing opportunity, but…</p><p>"Sir, I hate to repeat myself, but I do not want to be promoted because of some fatalistic role I played in the war. I did what I had to do, but now I'm living my life and wish to be lauded for my current actions, not something that happened a decade ago."</p><p>"And that's what's happening here. We want <em>you</em>, Senior Auror Potter, not some teenaged war hero. But let's be clear in the realization that a man as young as yourself, especially one in a relationship with an ex-Death Eater, would never be considered for this position if he were not also Harry Potter. Your name just allows everyone to overlook other concerns and concentrate on your skills and reputation. Suck it up, Potter, and accept it."</p><p>Harry seethed, glaring at the wall in his attempt not to lash out at his boss. To know what people were thinking about his private life and to <em>hear </em>it were two different things, and the fact that Robards was right and he couldn't change people's perceptions was galling.</p><p>He finally managed to rein in his temper long enough to look up at Robards.</p><p>"Sir, thank you for your candour. I apologise for the events of today and take full responsibility for my team. I maintain my request for Collins' reprimand and will make sure it does not happen again. Now, I have not eaten all day and I am late for my dinner plans. Am I excused?"</p><p>Robards sighed. "Yes, Harry. Go and get some rest. Take a day or two, and I'll expect you back mid-week. Think about what I've said. You're dismissed."</p><p>Harry turned and refrained from stalking out of the room, using every bit of restraint he had left to resist slamming the door behind him. He glanced at the clock and swore when he saw the time. It just kept getting better. <em>Fuck.</em></p><hr/><p>Twenty minutes later, Harry was cleaned up and practically running through Event Alley. So yeah, he was late. Really <em>really</em> late. And he just knew this wasn't going to go well.</p><p>According to the note he'd found in his pocket that afternoon, Draco had been planning this dinner out for a month and he was going to be irritated that he was once again held up at work. The evening was clearly important to him, though, so Harry would attempt to put his mood away and try to make the best of it.</p><p>He entered the restaurant and gave Draco's name to the host, who cleared his throat and looked him over.</p><p>"Sorry," Harry said. "I just came from work."</p><p>"Yes, Mr Potter, but we do have a dress code, even for you."</p><p>"Right." Harry took out his wand and transfigured his duster jacket into a set of dress robes. "Better?"</p><p>"Yes, thank you, sir. Now, Mr Malfoy has reserved the Cerulean Room for the evening."</p><p>"Ah, right. Thanks."</p><p>Damn, Draco was <em>really </em>going to be pissed off. He reserved a whole fucking room. Weird.</p><p>The host escorted Harry through the restaurant where diners were stuffed away in quiet nooks, private tables obscured by odd angles and strategically placed greenery. He opened a door onto a small room that reminded Harry of a wine cellar with a domed white brick ceiling, light blue furnishings, and silver lighting.</p><p>Harry looked around in awe.</p><p>"Thank you," he nodded to the host.</p><p>"Of course, sir. Enjoy your evening."</p><p>And then they were alone.</p><p>Yeah, Draco did not look pleased. Really, his face didn't look like anything, but that usually meant that he wasn't happy. He did look as though he had spent a lot of time to look nice, however, so Harry leaned over to give his boyfriend of three years a quick peck on the cheek and hoped he wasn't going to get his nose bitten off. Literally. That'd do wonders for his career.</p><p>"Draco, you look amazing. So sorry I'm late. I got pulled into a meeting that I couldn't get out of." He pulled out his chair and hesitated. "Did you get my message?"</p><p>"Yes, Potter, I got the message. Don't worry. I told you the dinner reservation was for 5:30 so you'd be here by 7." Draco smirked. "You're actually about twenty minutes early. <em>Shocking</em>."</p><p>Harry just raised an eyebrow and pushed down a swell of his irritation. It was amazing how that smirk could sometimes make him instantly hard, and other times, like now, just piss him off entirely. "Nice."</p><p>"Yes, well, I just have to know how to handle you."</p><p>Harry suppressed a growl. Sometimes, he was just so <em>Malfoy</em>.</p><p>He took his seat and took a deep breath, deciding that he was going to relax and enjoy their evening if it killed him.</p><p>"Well, I'm here now, and this looks really fancy. What's the occasion?"</p><p>Draco raised an eyebrow and just stared at him.</p><p>Harry's hackles raised further. "Well?"</p><p>"Really, Harry? Like, <em>really</em>? Merlin. You can't be fucking serious."</p><p>Goddammit, he was getting sick of this and he'd only just sat down. How was he supposed to know what Draco thought of as a special day? It wasn't Draco's birthday, or their anniversary, or some godforsaken holiday where he was supposed to buy chocolate or something. It was just a normal day, and it had been a rather crappy one at that, so he was getting kind of sick of being on the defensive here.</p><p>Harry picked up his glass of wine, and just looked at Draco. "Did you order food already too, or just the wine?"</p><p>"I took the liberty of ordering our courses, yes. I know what you like, so don't worry."</p><p>"Splendid," Harry said dryly, as a young woman appeared in the doorway with some type of soup. True, it smelled good, and he was sure he'd like it, but it was the principle of the thing.</p><p>As the server left them alone, Harry put down his wine and spread his napkin across his lap. Draco smiled and nodded in approval, as though proud of some trained crup. And <em>that </em>was what pushed him over the edge.</p><p>"Listen, I don't know what your problem is tonight, but I've had a very long and not entirely pleasant day, so I would appreciate you skipping the condescending, indulgent asshole act."</p><p>Harry downed the rest of his glass of wine, then tasted his soup. It really was quite good. Bastard.</p><p>Draco refilled Harry's glass, which for some reason just annoyed Harry more, so he continued.</p><p>"First, I get dragged out of bed early this morning after only getting about three hours of sleep last night, due to some <em>amazing </em>break in the case. I have to get dressed in the dark because you are snoring happily away, oblivious to everything around you, and then nearly broke my foot tripping over the cat.</p><p>"Now, you'd think after working nearly non-stop the last week, they'd have ensured that the tip was <em>actually </em>worth our time, but no, we end up following a wild goose chase over half of Wales before getting a message that the person we were after was sitting in our own holding cells."</p><p>Draco just stared at him with an even look and gestured for him to continue. He hated it when Draco tried to be all reasonable when he was feeling anything but.</p><p>"<em>Then,</em> we get back to the ministry and the idiots who were interrogating him failed to follow protocol, so when the man's barrister appears, he gets him released on a technicality. I have been cleaning up the fallout from that the entire afternoon, then get called to Robards's office so he could tear a strip off me because evidently, it's the Senior Auror on the case's fault, even if I was in fucking Wales when it happened.</p><p>"So, I apologize if I am late, but I'm here as requested in your reminder note you somehow slipped into my pocket at some point today because I know it wasn't there this morning. I escaped the damned ministry, I cleaned up, I'm wearing something at least halfway decent, and <em>I'm here, </em>all to get an extra dose of sarcasm because I don't know what this supposed special occasion is!"</p><p>Harry was breathing heavy at this point, and just shoved some more of the ridiculously delicious soup into his mouth before the lady came to take it away.</p><p>Draco remained silent, just looking at him, and yes, here came the woman with some kind of crab and fruit salad. And it looked amazing. Bitch.</p><p>She quietly took the empty bowls and left them alone again. More silence.</p><p>"Are you quite finished?"</p><p>"I don't know. Should I be? Or are you going to give me a hard time about whatever special day it is that I seem to have forgotten, making me feel like an asshole?"</p><p>"Oh, I think you're doing a fine enough job of that yourself. Don't you?"</p><p>Harry glared at him and tried to calm himself. He knew he had flown off the deep end, but it had just been such a miserable day and he had been trying to enjoy the quiet evening together, just to be met with sarcasm and snark.</p><p>Which was ridiculous, because that <em>was </em>his boyfriend. Sarcasm and Snark. What else did he expect? Normally it made him laugh or challenged him and he threw it right back.</p><p>"Fine. I'm being an asshole," Harry said sullenly.</p><p>"Good. Now that we've worked that out, take a deep breath, relax, and finish this delightful wine and your crab salad before the third course comes out. We'll talk about something else entirely for now."</p><p>Harry stamped down his bad-tempered retort and tried to do as suggested. They began to talk of Teddy because that always put him in a better mood, then Draco's ridiculous coworkers and Pansy's latest business venture because they made him laugh and intrigued respectively.</p><p>By the time the fourth course reached the table, Harry was laughing and enjoying himself while sipping yet another glass of that splendid wine. The stress of the day and lingering anger was mostly gone, and he was feeling much more reasonable.</p><p>"Lamb? My favourite, thank you," Harry told the server, then smiled at Draco when they were alone again.</p><p>"This meal is altogether wonderful. Thank you. Now, that I'm somewhat fed and not an insufferable bastard, are you going to tell me why the fancy meal?" he asked as he took a bite, humming in pleasure.</p><p>"Yes, well, thank Merlin that's over. Next time I'll just start hurling food at you and hope for the best. Bloody hell, try to do something special for your boyfriend on his fucking birthday, and you get…"</p><p>"Wait, what?" Harry started laughing. "It's not my birthday. Draco, not that I don't appreciate it, but my birthday isn't until Saturday. No wonder I was so confused. Besides, we're going to the Burrow Sunday for a party, right?"</p><p>"Harry?"</p><p>"No, it's fine. I don't mind celebrating a few days early, but I was just so confused. I thought I had surely forgotten some kind of special day or something."</p><p>Harry sat back, totally relaxed now from the good wine and fine meal, and finally understanding that Draco had just mixed things up.</p><p>"Harry? What day is it?"</p><p>"What do you mean what day is it? It's Wednesday, so…" he thought about it. "It's what, the 28th?"</p><p>Draco just looked at him. "Harry, it's Saturday, the 31st."</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. "Malfoy, I know you think Gryffindors are gullible idiots, but I'm not <em>that</em> gullible."</p><p>He took another drink of wine, amusement in his eyes. Malfoy really did look hot this evening, and now that the anger had passed and the wine gave him a good buzz, Harry could even be entertained by his antics. He found a leg under the table and ran his foot up and down Draco's entirely too sexy ankle.</p><p>Draco just laughed at him. "Salazar help me, you're pissed already. Seriously, did you eat anything today? As in today, <em>Saturday</em>, the <em>31st </em>of July? Your <em>twenty-eighth birthday </em>?"</p><p>He reached into his satchel (Ron called it a man bag, Harry snickered to himself), and handed Harry a copy of the day's <em>Daily Prophet</em>. July 31st's <em>Daily Prophet</em>. Fuck.</p><p>Harry just stared at the paper, then at Draco, then back at the paper. "Fuck. How…?"</p><p>"Still so eloquent in your old age. Honestly, Harry. You've been so deep in this case, it's not entirely surprising. You've only come home maybe two nights this past week. Did you honestly lose three whole days?"</p><p>"I must have. I just… the case. Bloody hell."</p><p>"You're working too hard. It's not reasonable what they ask of you." Draco paused and looked at him closely. "You have tomorrow off and are going to rest. We'll go to your party at the Burrow, but you need to owl Robards and tell him you're taking two more days at least. You need rest, or you're going to get yourself or your team killed."</p><p>Harry just looked at him, still stunned, then nodded. "Yeah, I s'pose you're right."</p><p>"Oh hell, he's reverting back to his peasant speech. <em>I s'pose</em>, he says. I thought I cured you of that?"</p><p>"I s'pose you're just going to have to teach me some more," Harry said with a saucy smile, amused and warm and fuzzy and yes, probably pissed.</p><p>Draco snorted. "Indeed."</p><p>He waited while the waiter cleared the plates and returned with a light chocolate mousse. Harry looked delighted, then remembered the rest of his conversation with Robards.</p><p>"And I can't take it easy, you know? I found out tonight that Robards wants to groom me to be his replacement."</p><p>Harry dropped that last statement like a bomb, waiting for Draco's explosion of shock and surprise that never came.</p><p>"Of course, he does. Please tell me this didn't come as a surprise. It was obvious, and your name will do the department a huge benefit."</p><p>Harry tried to glare, but the wine made it less effective, he figured, because Draco just laughed at him.</p><p>"Don't be obtuse. You deserve it, but you're young and that'll make them nervous. Your name will smooth the way."</p><p>Harry thought of Robards's other objection currently sitting across from him, then chose not to mention that one. Instead, he finished his time and took a bite of the lovely mousse that was still waiting for him.</p><p>Draco took a bite of his own dessert, looking Harry in the eye, then giving his spoon an extra little lick at the end.</p><p>Harry laughed and hardened, just a tad. "Happy birthday, indeed."</p><p>He waited a moment, then looked at Draco seriously. "I'm sorry I was such a prick. Thank you for remembering my birthday when even I didn't. It means a lot, love."</p><p>"Calling me love now, are you. Oh yes, totally sozzled. You'd best lay off the wine, or you'll be useless to me later."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Draco raised his eyebrows in expectation.</p><p>"Oh! Oh yes, that sounds perfect! Mmm, I <em>do </em>love to fuck you."</p><p>"Harry, dammit, keep your voice down."</p><p>"What? What's a private room for if not... Oh, wait. I know." He scooted down off his chair as the wine suggested to Harry that his newly formed plan was a great idea, and he needed to show Draco how sorry he truly was for being such an utter prat tonight.</p><p>"Nope!" Draco yelled when he realized what Harry's plans were. He quickly jumped up and pulled Harry up with him. "Nope, nope, nope. Oh look, here's the waitress. I'll sign for the bill, please. Thank you. We'll be leaving right now."</p><p>Harry laughed delightedly and ran his hand down Draco's arm. "Yes, thank you for a lovely dinner this evening." He flashed what he considered his best, most charming smile at the server, making her laugh.</p><p>"Good night Mr Potter, it was a pleasure to serve you this evening. Thank you, Mr Malfoy, and good luck with him tonight." She looked at Harry and added, "Do you need any assistance?"</p><p>It sounded like Draco was going to answer, but Harry answered quickly, as she seemed a nice woman and he didn't want to hurt her feelings. "No thank you. I can handle him quite well myself, thank you." Then he leaned closer and whispered, "And no offence, but he's bent, so you'd probably not be much help anyway."</p><p>Draco must have overheard because he flushed and cleared his throat. "Yes, well, good night, and thank you."</p><p>Harry let Draco escort him out of the restaurant, where Draco burst out laughing.</p><p>"All right, Potter, you're going home and sobering up before I even think of touching you tonight. Bloody hell, I can't believe you said that to her!"</p><p>"What? Was I wrong? Anyway, I'll be fine, just let me walk it off a little."</p><p>Draco grinned. "And then, then I'll take you home and…" then he leaned over and whispered exactly what he'd do to Harry to make his night complete.</p><p>"Well, happy birthday to <em>me," </em>Harry chuckled.</p>
