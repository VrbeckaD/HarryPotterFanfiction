    <p>Luminescent Nocturne  </p><p>Draco Malfoy swept his long platinum blonde locks out of his eyes as he boarded the Hogwarts train for the very last time. </p><p>His best friend and confidant, Blaise Zambini followed right behind him as they made their way through the halls of the train searching for a compartment to call their own.</p><p> Blaise tapped his shoulder and nodded towards the compartment all the way at the end of the hall. </p><p>“Come on mate. That one should be dark enough and even if it isn’t, Mum packed a bunch of blankets in our trunks so we can block out any sunlight.” </p><p>Draco nodded wordlessly and adjusted the dark sunglasses that sat on the bridge of his nose following behind his friend as they walked down the hall and entered the small compartment. </p><p>Blaise was correct it seemed. </p><p>The sunlight was minimal here and Draco sighed in relief at the feeling of the darkness hitting his deathly pale skin.</p><p> Window of the compartment had a shade that Blaise pulled down to block out the rest of the sunlight before turning to his friend with a small smile. </p><p>“You good now, Drake? I keep forgetting how awful it is right after you turn. Sunlight was the fucking devil for weeks after I turned.” </p><p>Draco upturned the corner of his mouth in a slight smile that really looked more like a grimace to Blaise. </p><p>“Yeah I’m good. Bloody hell, I didn’t think it would be this bad.” </p><p>Blaise took a seat opposite to him and reclined back propping his feet up on their trunks that still had yet to be put away. </p><p>“That’s what they all say, mate. </p><p>It all hits us like a fucking freight train.</p><p> But I’m pleased to inform you that it will get better in time. </p><p>You won’t be able to stay out in the sunlight for very long ever as a vampire but it’ll get more tolerable for short periods as the months go on.” </p><p>Draco attempted to turn his eyes to the shaded window to look out at the scenery as they passed but cursed and let out a wince when his eyes started burning like they were on fire. </p><p>“Fuck! I hate this shit. Just fucking figures that I’d have sour luck and be turned into a fucking vampire when I tried to do some good for once.” </p><p>Blaise’s midnight eyes flashed bright red and looked at him with sympathy. </p><p>“You were lucky to survive an attack from Sanguini, Draco.</p><p> Every other victim that he’s ever bit into bled out or had their throats ripped out as soon as he was done feeding.</p><p> No one expected this to happen but it did. </p><p>And it’ll do no fucking good to wallow in your own misery because of a situation that was out of your control.</p><p> Just keep in mind what I taught you and you’ll be fine.” </p><p>Draco instantly felt a pang of guilt at his friend’s words and fixed his face into a grateful smile. </p><p>“Sorry. It’s just a lot to take in.</p><p> Once we get to school, it’ll be better I’m sure.</p><p> Thankfully Dumbledore is allowing us to room together in the Dungeons in the new Slytherin wing.” </p><p>Blaise nodded excitedly and waggled his eyebrows at his best friend who rolled his eyes in response. </p><p>“Oh yeah. And don’t forget our secret mission this year. </p><p>Now that we’re both 18 our mates will make themselves known. </p><p>Things won’t be so bad when we find the lovely ladies that are meant to share eternity with us.” </p><p> </p><p>Draco nodded in agreement a small smile gracing his thin lips. </p><p>“Fuck I can’t wait to find my mate. </p><p>Your mum said that my turning side effects will disappear once I feed from her for the first time. </p><p>I know we’re the only vampires that are attending Hogwarts this year so that’ll mean our mates will be human before we turn them.” </p><p> </p><p>Blaise licked his lips instinctively as his eyes flashed red. </p><p>“Merlin, it’s been years since I’ve had a taste of fresh blood. </p><p>There’s nothing like it. Blood bags don’t even compare to when you take it straight from the vein. </p><p>Only thing is you have to make sure you’re not going to kill them. Humans are a lot more fragile than us. </p><p>One wrong bite and it’s all over for them. </p><p>When we turn our mates we’ll have to take special care to make sure they survive.” </p><p>Draco’s fangs involuntarily slid out of his gums at Blaise’s descriptive words making the vampire quirk an eyebrow at him. </p><p>“Better put those away mate. We don’t need everyone knowing about your little condition.</p><p> Humans other than our mates finding out is only going to cause hysteria and panic and Merlin knows we’ve had enough of that.” </p><p>He said as he shot a look at Draco who immediately shut his eyes and focused on willing his fangs to disappear back to where they came from. </p><p>Once they were perfectly sheathed in his gums, he let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>This whole newborn vampire thing was incredibly exhausting. </p><p>He knew Blaise was right about keeping their vampire status a secret. </p><p>His mind flashed to a few days after he turned when he was summoned to the Ministry to register at the Office of Magical Creatures as a newly turned vampire. </p><p>Even though it wasn’t his fault that he had been turned, he still had to deal with the wary glances and harsh whispers from the humans who judged him without mercy. </p><p>He smiled though when he thought about how kind Dumbledore was when he had asked to return to Hogwarts. </p><p>The elderly wizard had given his permission for him to return to school without hesitation. </p><p>Draco’s family was a right mess after the war and were concerned whether or not him returning to complete his eighth year would be safe for the other students. </p><p>Despite his family’s previous harsh relations with the older wizard, Dumbledore was quick to offer help and refuge to them in their time of need changing the way all of the former death eater families view on him. </p><p>Draco’s mother and father had never wanted to join the ranks of the death eaters in the first place and were spared when others were prosecuted and given the Dementor’s Kiss for their war crimes. </p><p>His mother had taken it upon herself to grow new forms of herbs and make potions that could help ease the pain of the patients that were left gravely injured at St. Mungo’s. </p><p> </p><p>His father had found that his wandless healing magic came in handy when he was appointed one of the head healers at the magical hospital. </p><p> </p><p>Both his parents had lost their hostility and prejudices towards muggles and muggle borns. </p><p>They encouraged him every step of the way through his process of turning and told him that they would gladly welcome his mate into their home and offer them a chance at being the family that they always wanted to have. </p><p> </p><p>Just as Draco thought he was going to drift off into a dreamless sleep, he was pulled out of his thoughts when he realized Blaise was calling his name loudly. </p><p>“Draco! Come on mate wake up. </p><p>We’re almost to the school now. </p><p>We’ve got to change into our new school robes. Let’s go grab a dressing room before they’re all gone.” </p><p>Shaking his head out of la la land, Draco nodded and quickly grabbed his new robes and followed after his friend to prepare for the journey of a lifetime.</p>
