    <hr/><p> </p><p>The preparations before a new school year always expects a veritable sea of owls in and out of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hundred of young anxious minds flurrying with last minute preparations, confirmations. Fretting parents and family, scrambling for assurances of security and validity. Owls from the school itself, heavy with admittance letters fresh off the Acceptance Quill, or school grades. Oversized, meandering scrolls weighing on harried Ministry owls, vying for advice that the sender will never heed.</p><p> </p><p>A single crow, black feathers shining with elusive embers of red and gold, eyes Fawkes from atop a particularly antique book. It holds aloft one of its three feet in an imperious manner, awaiting a wizened hand to relieve it of its burden, a delicately folded ream of paper held bay by a complex seal.</p><p>A clustered circle of hawthorn, and in its center, a distinctively asymmetrical star. Over the top, a phrase read proudly- LUCK AND PLUCK. A crest not to be ignored, older even than the earliest ambitions of a fledgling Albus Dumbledore. A crest that hadn't graced his office for nearly twelve years.</p><p> </p><p>A shame, to be sure. That clan's head was courteous and accommodating during the worst of times, but the fallout of war seemed to have broken the older man's trust in a way that had yet to repair itself. The last time the two crossed paths, Albus brushed against that mind to be met with an almost fatherly disappointment. But Jonathan always was more simple at heart, a steadfastness of principle that yielded to nothing, even for the greater good. Admirable, but at times... difficult to sway.</p><p> </p><p>His fingers touch the seal, branch and star retreating into nothingness, sparking the small card to unfold neatly into its intended form. Short, to the point, so unlike Jonathan.</p><p align="center">
