          <div class="userstuff"><p>Molly Weasley kissed Fred and George gently on the forehead, before she closed the door to their bedroom. It was rare for these little rascals to consent to take a nap in the afternoon, but Molly was glad they had done so today. </p>
<p>Their brother, three years old Ron, was sleeping as well and the baby was napping in its cradle. Percy had just gone out to play with a boy from the village and the other two were still at Hogwarts. It seemed as if it would be a quiet afternoon. </p>
<p>It didn’t mean that she’d have time to nap or rest herself, but at least she’d be able to catch up on some necessary household tasks that were usually neglected. </p>
<p>------- </p>
<p>Upstairs in their bedroom, the twins only pretended to be asleep. They had planned to play a trick on their younger brother and knew that they needed their mum to be out of the way for it to start. </p>
<p>They were only five years old, but in some respects, they were really smarter than other children their age – and playing pranks was their main area of childish expertise. </p>
<p>The twins waited until they could hear their mother moving around downstairs, before they sneaked out of their room, down one flight of stairs and into their brother’s room. </p>
<p>George was holding the body of a dead mouse in his hands. They had found it in the garden yesterday. The twins meant to exchange the mouse with Ron’s beloved teddy, to give their brother a scare when he woke. The twins enjoyed it when the toddler screamed.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Fred opened the door to Ron’s room quietly, so he and George could sneak inside. Ron was still sleeping peacefully, with his favorite stuffed toy in his arms. George sniggered at the sight but shut up quickly when he saw Ron stirring under his blanket. </p>
<p>The twins waited for a second, to see if the toddler would wake up, but he didn’t. Fred and George crept closer to Ron’s bed. Fred extended his hands to get a hold of the teddy, when the teddy suddenly moved. </p>
<p>Fred screamed and both twins stared down at the teddy, absolutely horrified. It wasn’t a teddy anymore. It wasn’t a toy anymore. It was moving. It also had way too many legs. </p>
<p>Ron was wide awake by now and was crying even louder than either of the twins when he saw the spider. “Muuum! Muuuuuuum!” the little boy was screaming. </p>
<p>It was no good that Fred and George tried to hush him up. They could already hear their mother rushing up the stairs.  </p>
<p>They did not know how it had happened or who of them had done that involuntary bit of magic, but this much was certain: Molly Weasley would be furious when she saw the spider, which was now crawling over Ron’s chest</p></div>
