    <p>"Let's call it 'The Adventurous Archive'. That's original!" The suggestion was met with various overlaying opinions.</p>
<p>"It's okay, but could be better. Let's add something to it," was said and agreed to by the other three.</p>
<p>"Travellers? Venturers?"</p>
<p>"What about explorers?"</p>
<p>"Something more complex than that... Remus, any ideas?" The three turned to look at the smartest one of the group, as well as the tallest.</p>
<p>The group of four was sitting in their dorm room. James sat at the desk with his laptop open in front of him, Remus on the bed playing with Sirius's hair, who was sitting on the ground in front of him. Peter was onlooking as usual.</p>
<p>"I suppose we could use marauder..." He stated after a bit of thinking.</p>
<p>Sirius nodded, leaning back towards to Remus. "Yeah, I like that word." Then, tilting his head further towards the boy, he whispered, "what's it mean?"</p>
<p>Remus giggled, much to Sirius's delight, and said out loud, "it's sort of French, but the English translation is basically to explore or raid. Fitting."</p>
<p>Sirius nodded thoughtfully and proclaimed, "see, I knew that. I was just asking for all of you."</p>
<p>Peter nodded and looked on the conversation admiringly. Although they were all in the same year, Peter appeared younger with his short and stocky height.</p>
<p>"Alright then, should I name it Marauders Archive?" James asked from the computer. He typed in the words and hovered the mouse over the save button, looking back at the group for approval.</p>
<p>"I like it," Remus said strongly. Sirius and James nodded their agreement, and the three knew that Peter would agree no matter what.</p>
<p>"Saved. Welcome to Tumblr, Marauders Archive," James read out.</p>
<p>They sat in silence after his proclamation.</p>
<p>"So, uh, what do we do now? Celebrate?" Sirius broke the quiet.</p>
<p>Remus laughed again and said, "well, we should post something, shouldn't we?"</p>
<p>Sirius was quick to say, "yeah, yeah, let's post something."</p>
<p>James stood up from his chair and motioned to the open computer. Remus slid into the seat and began to type.</p>
<p>"Herein lies the evidence of our wonderful lives- Remus, Peter, Sirius, and James," Remus read aloud.</p>
<p>"W-wait!" Peter said suddenly. The group glanced towards him, surprised, as the boy didn't typically speak up. "W-we should h-have c-code names. F-for s-saftey, you know."</p>
<p>Although their first instinct was to shut down Peter's idea, the three boys thought it over.</p>
<p>"Good idea, Peter. I think we'll do that. I'll be Moony, for obvious reasons," Remus said, referring to his werewolf-ness.</p>
<p>"Can I be Padfoot? Because, you know, dogs?" Sirius was somewhat obsessed with animals, dogs being his favourite.</p>
<p>Remus nodded and typed both names into the Tumblr draft.</p>
<p>"If we're going animal-like here, I suppose I'll be Prongs... That sounds cool, doesn't it?" James suggested.</p>
<p>"V-very cool," Peter said quietly. This drew the attention to him. The three boy's thought processes lead them all to think of a name for Peter.</p>
<p>"Hm, he kind of looks like a rat, doesn't he?" Remus said seriously.</p>
<p>Sirius nodded. "But also slightly worm-like..."</p>
<p>"Rattail? Wormrat? That doesn't work." James sighed.</p>
<p>"Wormtail?" Sirius thought out loud. James and Remus both nodded affirmingly, and Remus added it to the draft.</p>
<p>"W-why are all of y-your names so c-cool and mine's b-based off of ugly a-animals?" Peter asked nervously. It wasn't often that he spoke out against the group.</p>
<p>"Wormtail's a cool name, kind of. Besides, rats and worms are awesome," Remus stated. He sat down on Sirius's bed, next to the boy, and looked down at what was being written on the paper in his lap.</p>
<p>"Posted!" James said loudly. "Ah, crap. Lunch starts in two minutes, let's go."</p>
<p>James walked towards the door, eagerly followed by Peter. He turned back when outside, and called to Remus and Sirius, "you two coming?"</p>
<p>Sirius didn't look up, still engrossed in his writing. Remus, however, glanced once at James before turning back to Sirius. "We'll be down in a few, go without us."</p>
<p>James shrugged his shoulders and let the door close, leading himself and Peter to the Great Hall.</p>
<p>Remus leaned over Sirius's shoulder, glancing at the small writing on the page that he couldn't read. "Is that a different language?" He asked.</p>
<p>Sirius didn't respond right away; instead, he finished the page he had been scribbling on and grabbed another piece of parchment.</p>
<p>"Geez, Sirius, that's more than you've written for any of your classes combined, this year and last." Remus joked, although it was completely true.</p>
<p>Finally, after what seemed like ages, Sirius looked up from his parchment.</p>
<p>"How long was I writing for?" He asked, shuffling through the now multitude of pages he had used.</p>
<p>Remus glanced at the clock on the wall, seeing that, if they left now, they'd only be ten minutes late for lunch. "About ten minutes."</p>
<p>Sirius smiled to himself and muttered, "way less than last time."</p>
<p>Remus did not make it known, as they walked down to the Great Hall, that he had heard Sirius's remark. He wondered what could be so important or interesting that allowed Sirius to write for that long, and apparently even longer at other times.</p>
<p>Sirius was off in his own world, and Remus wondered exactly what he was thinking about- was it the same as whatever he was writing?</p>
