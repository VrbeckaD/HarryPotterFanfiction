    <p>The Unbreakable Vow<br/>
Chapter 1: Draco’s POV<br/>
Draco Malfoy stood up to go to the witness stand to testify against his father Lucius Malfoy. He feared his father. He’s a death eater. Draco was terrified of him. His father is a dangerous man. That’s why he was doing this. To keep him, and his mother safe. He keeps telling himself: ‘he’ll get a life sentence, we’ll be safe!’ but something deep inside him tells him he won’t. He doesn’t want him to get out for he fears his father will brainwash him. He’s just about to start walking, when his best friend, Blaise Zabini grabs his wrist.<br/>
“Are you sure you want to do this Draco? If you don’t, I’ll tell the minister for you.” Draco is tempted, but he decides against it.<br/>
“Yeah, I do.” He gives his friend a sad smile, which he returns.<br/>
He sits down to begin. He looks down at his dark mark. He hates it, but there’s nothing he can do. People still stare at him in fear when they pass him. He hopes that him bearing witness will at least change the minds of a few people. He’s tried to change, but people still see him as his father’s son. The time goes by quickly, and Draco almost runs back to sit next to Blaise. He stares into space for a while, lost in thought until he hears the minister of magic. He looks up at his father.<br/>
He looks just like him. Lucius is a tall slender man. He has the same blond hair as Draco, but Draco’s hair is short, while his father’s hair is longer. They have the same gray eyes, but Lucius's eyes are dark and full of hate, while Draco's are warm and silvery.<br/>
“Lucius Malfoy, you have been proven guilty. You’re sentenced to Azkaban for 14 years under high security.” He says with a serious look on his face. Draco can’t even process what he had just heard. Only 14 years!? There must be something he can do!<br/>
“No!” He shouts. “Minister, please! A life sentence! I never want to see him again! Please! I beg of you. He’s extremely dangerous!” He falls to his knees. “Please!” He says, fighting the urge to cry.<br/>
“I’m sorry Mr. Malfoy, but my decision is final. 14 years, this court is adjourned.” He says, showing no signs of sympathy. Blaise runs over, pulling Draco into a tight hug.<br/>
“Everything will be fine. It’s going to be okay.” He whispers softly. He stops for a moment, then, having seen his friend’s watery eyes, says: “Don’t worry.” Then hugs him tighter. Draco appreciates that Blaise cares, but he’s still worried. </p>
<p>Suddenly he hears another voice behind him.<br/>
“I’m sorry Malfoy. It’s okay to cry you know.” He says after he notices Draco trying to hide the fact that he’s crying. “We’d like to speak to you, though we understand if you don’t want to talk to us.” Just as Draco’s trying to think of who the voice could be, he hears another.<br/>
“Yeah, we’re hoping to start over. We would like to apologize. Right, Ron?” Then Draco’s brain clicks. No, it couldn’t possibly be… the golden trio? Apologizing? Why would they apologize to him? If anything, he should be apologizing to them! He was the death eater! The first voice was Harry Potter, and the second, Hermione Granger. He looks over to Blaise.<br/>
“Pinch me, I’m dreaming.” He says. “Okay!” Says Blaise, way too excited to pinch him.” “Ouch! Okay, not dreaming. Hallucinating then? Tell me, Blaise!” He shakes Blaise by the shoulders.<br/>
“Nope. Harry Potter and Hermione Granger really did just try to apologize to you. Although the Weasel doesn’t look too happy about it.” Blaise says, making Draco turn around to look for himself.<br/>
“Ronald Weasley. Answer her now. I’ll tell Mummy you’re being rude again” Ginny Weasley says as she walks over and takes Harry’s hand. “Fine. Hermione, speak for yourself. Ouch! What was that for?” Ron rubs his side in pain after Hermione elbowed him in the ribs. He glares at Hermione.<br/>
“Well I don’t know about him, but I’d like to be friends.” Says Neville Longbottom. He helps Blaise up while Harry helps Draco up. Draco is surprised at them and confused as well.<br/>
“Why would you guys apologize to me? I should be the one to apologize. Neville, I made fun of you all the time, Luna, I made fun of your creatures. Hermione, I called you a mudblood at school. Ron and Ginny, I made fun of your family, and Harry, I was a death eater, I worked for the man who killed your parents. I made all of your lives miserable” he says, lowering his head in shame.<br/>
“That’s all in the past now Draco, we can all be friends now.” Says Luna. Draco wonders why her voice is always so… daydreamy. She never seems sad. He wishes he could be that happy.<br/>
“Are you guys serious? Can we really be friends?” Draco looks at all of them, curious to what they’ll say.<br/>
“Friends?” Harry asks as he stretches out his hand for Draco to shake.<br/>
“Friends. Thanks, Pot- Harry.” He shakes his hand. He smiles at all of them.<br/>
“That was so sweet! I think I might cry! Can I be your friend too?” Blaise gives them puppy dog eyes. They look at each other, having silent conversations with each other. Harry turns back to Blaise, starts to reach out his hand when Blaise shoves it away and gives each of them a quick hug. Although Ron looked absolutely disgusted, he didn’t care, he just went to the next person.<br/>
“Okay Blaise, we’re all friends, great, now what?” Draco asks rhetorically. “Ooooh ooooh, I know! I know! Let’s have a sleepover at my house!! We can sleep in the living room and the girls can sleep in my parents’ room! They’re gone for a week. Oh, pretty please?” Blaise jumps for joy.<br/>
“Oh, I don’t see why not. Could we invite Susan?” Hermione asks. “Who?” asks Draco.<br/>
“Oh yeah! Susan Bones, you know, Hufflepuff? Please?” Ginny asks, hopeful.<br/>
“What are you two doing talking to these Gryffindors and Ravenclaw?” Someone just arrived. Draco knows without looking who it is.<br/>
“Shut up Pansy, we’re friends now. Do you want to come along to Blaise’s house for a sleepover?” Draco asks. Pansy looks confused. “Well, I do want to get away from my father, he’s constantly complaining about Lucius being sentenced to Azkaban. But I don’t want to hang out with these… Oh, alright.” She says after seeing Blaise’s puppy dog eyes.<br/>
“Yay! Sorry for the rude interruption Ginny, sure! Let’s disapparate to Susan’s house!” Says Blaise, grabbing everyone’s arms. They disapparate to go get Susan.</p>
