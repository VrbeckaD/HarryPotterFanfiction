          <div class="userstuff"><p>In the eye of the storm, <br/>
Even the leaves that once crowned the most magnificent of trees<br/>
Can fall to the ground.<br/>
Can be stepped on, <br/>
And be rained on, <br/>
And be brushed away by the wind,<br/>
Helpless.</p><p>Hopeless. </p><p>But sometimes, <br/>
In the calm that comes after the storm, <br/>
The breeze can make the most different of leaves <br/>
Come together. <br/>
And what was once a little too broken, a little too tattered, <br/>
A little too close to death, <br/>
Can turn the ground into a canvas of colour. <br/>
Can turn into beauty, <br/>
Into life. <br/>
Into the perfect pocket <br/>
For something new to grow.</p><p>
