    <p class="p1">Harry Potter was, reasonably, terrified. He’d been dating Draco for all of six months when Draco had invited him for tea at the manor.</p><p class="p1">“It’s a small thing really,” Draco had said, offhandedly. “Only, Mother wishes to meet my latest paramour.” Harry had chuckled at that.</p><p class="p1">“Latest?” he had asked. Harry knew that Draco had been decidedly single in the years after the war, having only <em>just </em>come out to his mother in the last month, after things had gotten more serious with Harry. Draco had been careful not to give away Harry’s identity, but Narcissa Malfoy had been thrilled to get to know the man in Draco’s life all the same.</p><p class="p1">Draco smirked, giving his boyfriend a soft kiss before the two disapparated to the manor.</p><p class="p1">Malfoy Manor was nothing like Harry remembered. For one thing, everything felt very light, and airy, though they had just apparated into the foyer, there was something about the warm atmosphere that reminded him of a much larger version of the Burrow. Then again, Harry supposed he hadn’t exactly had much time to think about the interior decoration of Malfoy Manor the last time he’d been there.</p><p class="p1">“Draco darling, is that you?” Harry heard Narcissa’s voice coming from the parlor. Draco smiled and squeezed Harry’s hand in a comforting manner and ushered him into the parlor. Narcissa stood up at once as Draco entered first, and wrapped her son up in a hug. Harry was somewhat taken aback by the action, he did not picture Narcissa Malfoy being a hugger, as she pulled away from her son she took in Harry behind him and smiled.</p><p class="p1">“Mr. Potter,” she said with a fond smile that made Harry blush slightly before she wrapped him up in a hug too. “Thank you,” she whispered into his ear. Before Harry could ask what for, she had slipped away, and taken her seat in the high wing-backed chair that Harry supposed was once Lucius’s chair. Harry clumsily took the seat beside Draco, on the black leather couch across from Narcissa.</p><p class="p1">“Mother, I would like you to meet Harry Potter,” Draco said. “My boyfriend.”</p><p class="p1">Narcissa smiled knowingly, “A pleasure,” she said inclining her head to him.</p><p class="p1">“You don’t seem, surprised,” Harry said somewhat nervously. Narcissa merely laughed, light, airy, not at all the imperious laugh of derision he’d expected.</p><p class="p1">“No Mr. Potter I can’t say that I am. My son has never been subtle when it came to his affections for you. Though I confess, I did wonder when he would admit as much to himself,” she said. Harry’s eyes widened and out of the corner of his eye, Harry noticed Draco flush pink.</p><p class="p1">“Mother,” he hissed.</p><p class="p1">“Of course. I can’t say I don’t approve,” she clapped her hands and Harry nearly jumped as a house elf appeared at once. “Mipsy,” she turned to the elf, still smiling. “Could we get the tea now?” she asked, then lowering her voice to the point that only the elf could hear her, whispered something else. The elf nodded and vanished with a loud crack. Harry swallowed, wiping his sweaty palms on his pants as Narcissa turned her attention back to the boys. “Draco tells me you’ve recently left the Aurors. Everything is alright I trust?” she asked.</p><p class="p1">Harry frowned but nodded. “Just didn’t… feel right,” he admitted. His voice was shaky. Draco placed a hand on his knee in an effort to calm him, and Harry could almost <em>feel </em>Draco’s magic through his fingertips, calming him instantly. Narcissa watched this interaction with great interest but did not remark on it. </p><p class="p1">“I’m sorry to hear that,” she said, as another loud crack sounded, and the tea appeared, along with what appeared to be several leather bound books. Narcissa poured the tea for both Draco and Harry first, then for herself. “Draco darling, would you trade spots with me?” she asked. Harry shot his boyfriend a nervous look, Draco merely shrugged, doing as his mother asked. Narcissa smiled as she took the seat beside Harry, flattening out her dress as she sat. “You seem nervous,” she whispered knowingly, and Harry flushed. “So I thought I’d help take your mind off things with this,” she held up one of the leather books. “Baby pictures, of Draco,” she shot her son a dangerous smile as she opened one of the books on hers and Harry’s lap. Harry’s eyes widened as he took in the first set of pictures. A very small Draco, laying in his mother’s arms, presumably in St. Mungo’s just after the birth. Narcissa beamed at the camera, then turned to look at her newborn son. Baby Draco yawned, and Narcissa threw her head back and laughed. “Draco was, and has always been the best thing that has ever happened to us. That much Lucius and I can still agree on.” Harry frowned. He had heard about Draco’s parents separation shortly after the war. Lucius and Narcissa no longer saw eye to eye, but divorce was unheard of for purebloods and so Lucius had moved into a separate wing of the manor from his wife. It had taken some intricate and ancient spellwork, but the two did not run into each other. No matter where either one went, they were never near each other again. Draco looked sadly at his mother, as she flipped the page, this one showing a hospital shot that included Lucius standing next to his wife. He looked so stiff in comparison to the beaming woman beside him. Where Narcissa was warm, maternal, and glowing, Lucius was cold, stone faced, disinterested. Harry frowned. “He’s in few photos,” Narcissa admitted noticing Harry’s frown. Harry schooled his face into something a bit less severe as Narcissa flipped through several more pages. All showing various moments of new born and infant Draco. Laying in his mother’s arms, a terrifying one in which Bellatrix had held Draco, slightly at bay, looking thoroughly uncomfortable and mildly disgusted. Harry had laughed at the juxtaposition of that.“Bella never was cut out for motherhood,” Narcissa noted faintly.</p><p class="p1">By the end of their tea, Harry had become decidedly more comfortable.</p><p class="p1">“Thank you for that Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry said as he and Draco stood to leave.</p><p class="p1">“It’s Black now actually,” she said. “And please, call me Narcissa. You are dating my son after all,” she added with a smile. Harry smiled back.</p><p class="p1">“Thank you. Narcissa,” Harry said.</p><p class="p1">“I expect you boys to come here weekly for tea,” she said to her son in a serious tone of voice that brooked no argument. Draco nodded, as Narcissa gave him a kiss on the forehead, then did the same with Harry.</p><p class="p1">Harry sighed happily as he and Draco left the parlor for the foyer where they could apparate again. </p><p class="p1">“You’re looking rather pleased with yourself,” Draco said. Harry smiled, as he took Draco’s hand, lacing their fingers together.</p><p class="p1">“Your very lucky,” Harry said after a moment. “Your mother is incredible.”</p><p class="p1">Draco laughed, “Yeah try living with her,” he said and the two disapparated with a loud pop.</p><p class="p2" align="center">* * *</p><p class="p1">As promised their tea evenings had become a regular occurrence, with Harry and Narcissa going through Narcissa’s seemingly endless supply of photographs of Draco throughout his youth, much to Draco’s chagrin. Still the look of absolute delight on Harry’s face at the sight of young Draco running around the garden in his posh little wizarding robes chasing the peacocks. Or the picture of him laying in his crib holding a black teddy bear with what Harry was <em>certain </em>was a lightning bolt on it’s forehead. “That was his favorite bear,” Narcissa said with a smile at Draco. Draco groaned.</p><p class="p1">“Oh lord, not Potterbear,” Draco said. Harry laughed.</p><p class="p1">“Potterbear?” Harry asked. It felt old thinking that teddybears had been made after him when he was only a baby, but then given everything else that had happened since he supposed it was just par for the course.</p><p class="p1">“Yes, some rather crafty wizards at a toy company had created these sort of, commemorative bears with green eyes, black hair, and little lightning bolts, the second Christmas after you’d been known as the boy who lived,” Narcissa said. “Draco took him <em>everywhere. </em>Threw an impossible tantrum whoever he couldn’t find him,” she hid a laugh behind her hand as Draco flushed crimson. True to form, Harry noticed the bear crop up in several more pictures after that. Little Draco, holding tight to the bear as he flew on a toy broom, or holding onto the bear, his eyes alight with mischief as he smiled to the camera, then vanished from the frame, running towards his father on the other side of the room. Harry beamed across the room at his boyfriend, it was so odd seeing this version of Draco, so carefree, so happy, he was so different from the rather severe boy Harry had met at age 11.</p><p class="p1">The change happened so slowly, that at first Harry almost hadn’t noticed it. Slowly but surely, as picture Draco aged, he seemed to smile less and less, and somewhere by age six, Draco had started to resemble the serious boy Harry had known. Narcissa sighed, “Lucius threw Potterbear into the fireplace once Draco reached what he felt was a more <em>mature</em> age. I saved him of course, and hid him in the attic.” Draco’s eyes widened. He hadn’t known that. "He may still be there, one of the last in existence." </p><p class="p1">“That’s, awful he did that,” Harry said.</p><p class="p1">“No, that’s Lucius,” Draco said sagely. Narcissa stared at her son, then down at the photo of Draco at aged 9, looking so proper and coiffed that he looked far too much like someone twice his age should have. She frowned. There remained a few pictures of Draco still smiling.</p><p class="p1">“Lucius was usually away on business when these were taken,” Narcissa noted as she looked at the picture of Draco the summer before he was set to go to Hogwarts. He had just turned 11 and Narcissa had never been so excited for her son. “Grew up so fast,” she said, pulling a handkerchief from her wrist and discreetly dabbing her eyes.</p><p class="p1">“It’s getting late,” Draco said quietly. He had never witnessed his mother crying before, not even with as bad as everything had gotten during the war. Narcissa nodded, as she closed the book on her lap and stood quickly. She strode across the room and hugged her son. Offering him another kiss on the forehead. Harry noticed Draco whisper something to his mother, and her nodding, but in true Slytherin fashion when Narcissa turned towards him there was no hint as to the nature of their conversation on her face. Narcissa smiled and offered Harry a hug then kissed his cheek.</p><p class="p1">“Goodnight boys,” she said.</p><p class="p1">“Goodnight mother,” Draco said.</p><p class="p1">“Goodnight, Narcissa,” Harry said. Something felt odd, he thought, though he couldn’t quite figure out what.</p><p class="p2" align="center">* * *</p><p class="p1">Three months later found Draco and Harry celebrating Harry’s 21st birthday at the manor. Draco and Narcissa had offered Harry to invite the Weasley’s and any of his friends that he wanted, but Harry had insisted that he wanted a quiet affair. It was strange, but Harry had become very attached to Narcissa Malfoy, and he liked the quiet evenings spent, just him and Draco.</p><p class="p1">Draco smiled, “My gift to you is more in the form of a question,” Draco said. Harry stared at his boyfriend. “I wanted to know, if we could move in together?” Draco asked, looking incredibly nervous. Harry’s eyes widened.</p><p class="p1">“Of course,” Harry answered, wrapping his boyfriend up in his arms. “But I mean, where? Your flat or…” Harry shuddered. “Grimmauld?”</p><p class="p1">“Where would you rather be?” Draco asked. Harry looked at Narcissa, a brilliant idea suddenly coming to him.</p><p class="p1">“Here. I mean, if you wouldn’t mind Narcissa.” Narcissa beamed.</p><p class="p1">“I would love it if you boys moved in to the manor,” she said. Draco smiled at Harry and his mother, then just because he couldn’t help himself, said.</p><p class="p1">“Oh great, now you can share more pictures of younger me, when you both have insomnia.”</p><p class="p1">Harry laughed. “Now then, my gift is, admittedly not quite as romantic,” Narcissa said with a rye laugh as she walked up to Harry, and wrapped her arms around him, and whispered in his ear, “Happy birthday baby boy.” Harry’s eyes widened, and before he could stop himself, he’d begun sobbing into Narcissa’s shoulder. Narcissa turned towards her son, suddenly worried, but Draco shook his head. He smiled watching the scene, willing himself not to tear up as his mother held his boyfriend for a long time.</p><p class="p1">“T—thank you,” Harry said as he pulled away, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. Narcissa nodded, handing him a small black box that was delicately wrapped. Harry took the box and opened it. Inside was another smaller box, this one velvet. He opened it, slowly. Nestled in the silk lined box was a silver signet ring with the Black family crest emblazoned on it. Harry stared at the ring, his eyes wide as he shakily took it out of the box.</p><p class="p1">“That belonged to Regulus and would later have been passed to Sirius had he not been stricken,” Narcissa said. Harry placed the ring on his right hand, feeling tears prickling at his eyes again.</p><p class="p1">“It’s beautiful,” he said shakily. Narcissa smiled.</p><p class="p1">“You are, very much apart of this family,” she said. Harry smiled, as Draco made his way over to his boyfriend and wrapped an arm around his shoulders.</p><p class="p1">“Happy birthday love,” he said. Harry smiled, wiping his eyes. It was, he decided, easily the happiest birthday he’d had in his life.</p><p class="p2" align="center">* * *</p><p class="p1">It was a month to Christmas, four months later, and Harry had offered to accompany Narcissa during her shopping trip in Diagon. “Really Harry, we have a house elf, and we can send the shopping back to the manor,” she said as Harry followed her throughout the winding roads of Diagon, and into Flourish and Blotts for a gift for Draco. Harry wouldn’t hear of it however.</p><p class="p1">“I don’t mind, honestly.”</p><p class="p1">Narcissa gave the young man a sort of exasperated smile and shrugged, as she disappeared down one of the isles. “You’re aware I’m sure, of my son’s penchant for potion making,” Narcissa said as she looked through various ancient looking tomes on the subject. Harry nodded. “What you may not be aware of, is that his godfather ensured that Draco had an extensive library of books on the subject making finding potion books he does not possess exceedingly difficult,” she sighed, not finding a book that looked like one she hadn’t already seen Draco reading at one time or another. Harry nodded, as she turned and made her way towards another isle. This one on Quidditch. Harry looked decidedly more interested, and picked up a biography on Wronski, <em>Feinting Through Life. </em>Narcissa smiled as she watched him, and plucked a copy off the shelf, and disappeared past another isle. Harry replaced the book on the shelf and followed her as she made her way to the front of the bookstore and paid for the book, Harry hadn’t noticed her pick up. Harry snatched the bag from the shop clerk before Narcissa could even attempt to reach for it. Narcissa smiled, shaking her head and just let Harry hold the bag as the two made their way out into Diagon.</p><p class="p1">“I may have to give up on magical tomes, and find him something in Muggle London,” she said. Harry smiled at her. “Sure you can handle Prada and Louis Vuitton?” Harry's eyes widened. “Oh don’t be so shocked. Most of the so-called Muggle designers have a section of their shop dedicated solely to wizards. Our fashions aren’t <em>that </em>far off from Muggles these days,” she said. Harry just nodded because he didn’t really <em>know </em>anything about fashion. Narcissa smiled taking Harry’s hand as the two apparated out of Diagon and into Muggle London, appearing in, Harry realized a moment later, the wizarding section of Prada. A house elf appeared, offering them champagne as they browsed. Harry declined, but Narcissa took a glass happily, and Harry noticed that the wizards of Prada did not give Narcissa the same withering look of thinly veiled contempt that the shopkeeper in Flourish and Blotts had. Harry was grateful for it. Even if he <em>was </em>prepared to defend Narcissa Malfoy at all costs, he would just as soon <em>not </em>have to hex people. Something told him that while she might be flattered, Narcissa would not be pleased, and the thought made him keep his wand to himself.</p><p class="p1">Narcissa snatched up several expensive looking items that passed in a blur in front of Harry’s face as she made her way to the front.</p><p class="p1">“That’ll be six thousand galleons, ninety four sickles, and twelve knuts,” the wizard said. Harry’s eyes widened, as Narcissa handed over what looked to be a credit card with, Harry noted, an imperious looking goblin in profile on the card.</p><p class="p1">“Gringott’s finally embracing Muggle culture thanks to your Ms. Granger,” Narcissa said as the cashier returned her card which vanished as it reached her hand. She smiled. “Far better for one to carry around a small piece of plastic rather than trying to hold an absurd amount of coins.” Harry nodded. The cashier bid them good day, as Harry took the bags again, and he and Narcissa exited the shop.</p><p class="p1">“It’s weird going into a wizarding store not getting stared at,” Harry said.</p><p class="p1">“No offense Harry darling, but stores like this are quite used to celebrity clientele. Even a savior such as yourself,” she smiled at him.</p><p class="p1">“No I mean, it’s a relief.” Narcissa smiled, as they made their way towards Louis Vuitton, then Chanel, then over to a makeup store, Harry had never heard of. In the end, Harry was burdened with several dozen bags, and Narcissa was feeling rather guilty. Dragging the boy behind a parked truck, Narcissa pulled out her wand and waved it at the bags in Harry’s arms. The bags vanished with a pop.</p><p class="p1">“I could handle it,” Harry said with a slight pout.</p><p class="p1">“I know darling,” she said, pocketing her wand, before she put her arm in Harry’s. “Let’s get some lunch. I’m rather peckish. Where would you like to go?” Harry considered this, anything he could think of, <em>the Leaky, the Three Broomsticks </em>seemed far too beneath Narcissa’s taste level, and he didn’t want to subject her to that.</p><p class="p1">“You decide,” he said.</p><p class="p1">Narcissa eyed him, “Very well." and with that, the two vanished on the street, and appeared at none other than the Leaky Cauldron. Harry’s eyes widened, as Narcissa took a seat, looking impossibly prim even in the darkened wood paneled pub. “Harry,” she said snapping him out of his thoughts. Harry took a seat across from her and she smiled. “I realize my past actions have lead you to believe that I am some snob who is incapable of taking in anything I consider lower fair.”</p><p class="p1">“I wasn’t thinking…” Narcissa held up a hand.</p><p class="p1">“Please. Harry I understand. But you must know that the occupation of the manor for that year made many things wildly apparent to me. Not the least of which was that, once you’ve had dinner while a giant snake devoured a full human being, a little low-rent atmosphere is nothing.” Harry shuddered at the imagery. “What I mean is. While I am very much still a Black and a former Malfoy, it’s hard to be haughty when you’ve had a madman and his ilk with the manners of those raised in a barn, living in your home.”</p><p class="p1">Harry supposed this made sense. “But what about…” Harry trailed off. He didn’t want to bring up the obvious, that several eyes had snapped up in their direction from the moment the two had sat down. Harry would have liked to believe that it was more about him than the blonde woman sitting across from him, but in his experience in dating Draco for almost a year now, he had learned that people tended to stare far more at Draco than they did at Harry these days.</p><p class="p1">“After the war I was spit on more times than I can count,” Narcissa said. “A little light staring, I hardly notice,” she said. There was that warm familiar smile again that Harry could help but adore her for. She had held her head high in the face of such vitriol and abuse. It was admirable, Harry thought. A defensive instinct of this woman rushed over him suddenly. Narcissa smiled. “I rather like this,” she said suddenly. “Having a private moment to get to know the man who will <em>inevitably</em> be my son in law.” Harry choked on air at that.</p><p class="p1">“I… what?” he and Draco had not discussed marriage yet. They had only just moved in together. Narcissa smiled knowingly, not looking up from her menu as she spoke.</p><p class="p1">“You do plan to propose eventually yes?” she asked. Harry opened his mouth, when suddenly a server he didn’t recognize appeared to ask them what they wanted to drink. Harry asked for a butterbeer while Narcissa asked for elf made wine. The gruff looking man nodded, and turned on his heel and left.</p><p class="p1">“I mean, we haven’t really discussed it,” Harry admitted. Narcissa raised an eyebrow at this.</p><p class="p1">“Oh?”</p><p class="p1">“I mean, we...” he swallowed hard and Narcissa smiled at him.</p><p class="p1">“Dear heart I didn’t mean to frighten you. You boys are still young. There’s <em>plenty </em>of time to decide to get married,” she said. “I just mean that you both are,” she paused, smiling as she considered her words. “Soulmates feels a touch lofty, not to mention <em>woefully </em>cliche, but certainly perfect for each other.”</p><p class="p1">Harry flushed. “Yeah?”</p><p class="p1">Narcissa smiled, “You have returned a light to my son’s eyes that I thought long gone,” she said. Just then their drinks arrived and Harry drank to keep himself from saying something stupid, or otherwise crying again. Narcissa merely smiled, as she took a sip of her wine. In the end, they had ordered steak and kidney pie and spoke of Narcissa’s plan for a Yule ball at the manor.</p><p class="p1">“Of course, you’re welcome to invite your friends. It’ll be good for the manor to see happy memories again after all the darkness it’s seen,” she said. Harry nodded.</p><p class="p2" align="center">* * *</p><p class="p1">December 21<span class="s1"><sup>st</sup></span>, found Harry standing nervously in front of Draco’s mirror in their shared bedroom in Malfoy Manor, trying to fix his hair, when Draco appeared behind him, looking like a vision in emerald green dress robes, his hair loose. Harry turned around fast. “Fuck you look so hot,” Harry whispered, shoving Draco against the nearest wall and kissing him hard. Draco gasped into his mouth.</p><p class="p1">“Mmm,” Draco hummed. “You don’t look so bad yourself,” he said against Harry’s lips as Harry pulled away slowly. “Tease.” Harry grinned.</p><p class="p1">“Your mother won’t be pleased if we’re late,” Harry said wisely. Draco sighed, a long suffering sigh and nodded, slipping his arm into Harry’s as they made their way downstairs, into the ballroom where Narcissa and several dozen guests were already there, deep in conversation. Narcissa looked as regal as ever, in a silver ballgown, and Harry smiled across the room at the woman who had become rather like a mother to him. Narcissa smiled brightly at him, then returned to her conversation with the Minister for Magic.</p><p class="p1">“You lent your name to this party,” Draco said. It wasn’t a question. Harry raised an eyebrow as Draco smiled at his boyfriend.</p><p class="p1">“How do you mean?”</p><p class="p1">Draco snorted, “Harry James Potter,” he said arms folded across his chest. Harry shrunk a little at the use of his full name and grabbed a champagne goblet off a tray floating past. “I love my mother, but the Black name is in no better shape than the Malfoy one, and we managed to get the <em>Minister?</em>”Draco said pointing to his mother. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="p1">“She’s very persuasive,” he said. Draco’s eyes lowered.</p><p class="p1">“Quite." Harry exhaled. If he was honest, he didn’t know why he’d done it. <em>Shouldn’t </em>have done it, he thought fiddling with the black box in his pocket. He’d been thinking about it for weeks, since his talk with Narcissa back in the Leaky. He and Draco <em>had </em>been dating for over a year now, and Harry was certain that Draco was the one. Nothing had ever been as clear to him as that one fact was, so, now seemed like as good a time as any to ask Draco. Though Harry vaguely wished he hadn’t lent his name to the affair and thus made it a Wizarding High Society function that would likely be splashed all over the Prophet the following morning. Not that Harry had ever expected his engagement <em>not </em>to be printed for public consumption. <em>Now, </em>when <em>to do it, </em>Harry thought.</p><p class="p1">The opportunity presented itself far more effortlessly than Harry had ever hoped. Narcissa had given a small speech about the meaning of family, and the opportunity for second chances, before turning to Harry. “The Savior of the Wizarding world, and the boy I think of as my second son,” Narcissa said. “Harry would you like to say a few words?” she asked. Harry looked nervously across the room at her. All eyes suddenly on him. <em>Now or never Potter, </em>he thought as he pulled out his wand and cast a sonorus on himself. </p><p class="p1">“I…er, wanted to thank you all for joining us, for this Yule Ball, I've never been good at dancing or speeches, so you can imagine this for me is almost more terrifying than facing the Dark Lord," there was a laugh at this and Harry smiled. "But, there's been something I've been thinking about a lot lately, and it's partially thanks to the lovely Narcissa Black,” he inclined his head to Narcissa who raised an eyebrow at him. Harry turned to Draco and smiled at him. Draco raised an eyebrow that rather matched Narcissa's Harry thought, as he dropped to one knee. Draco’s breath caught. “Draconis Abraxus-Lucius Malfoy,” Harry said. “This past year with you has been, by far the most amazing time of my life, and I have never ever been as happy as I am now. Would you do me the honor of becoming my husband?” Harry asked as he pulled out the black velvet box containing the ring Draco instantly recognized as his mother’s engagement ring. Silver, with a princess, cut diamond, surrounded by small emeralds, with two snakes on either side of the diamond. Draco’s eyes widened as he turned to look at his mother, who was beaming at them. Draco turned back to Harry and nodded, tears in his eyes as Harry got to his feet, placing the ring on his finger and the two shared a kiss. Draco let his eyes fall closed, as he cried into his fiancé’s shoulder. <em>Bloody hell, I’m engaged, </em>Draco thought with a little watery laugh.</p><p class="p1">“I love you Potter, you great bloody sap,” Draco said with a laugh as Harry picked up him, and spun him around the room. Narcissa appeared beside them at once.</p><p class="p1">“Congratulations,” she said with a knowing smile to Harry.</p><p class="p1">“You knew about this.” Draco hissed. Narcissa merely gave her son a kiss on the cheek.</p><p class="p1">“Now now darling. Don’t pout,” she turned to Harry and gave him a kiss on the cheek as well.</p><p class="p1">“Thanks, mum,” Harry said smiling brightly. Narcissa’s eyes widened at that. Harry looked worriedly at the woman as Narcissa hugged him tight, tears forming at the corners of her eyes.</p><p class="p1">“What’s happened?” Harry whispered. Draco smiled.</p><p class="p1">“You called her mum,” Draco said. Harry laughed.</p><p class="p1">“I want you to know Harry,” she said as she pulled away a moment later. “I am so proud to call you my other son,” Harry blushed. “But, if you ever call me mum instead of mother again, I’ll hex your tongue off.” Harry laughed. He had long ago become accustomed to Narcissa’s sense of humor.</p><p class="p1">“Understood, <em>Mother,</em>” Harry said smartly. Narcissa smiled and kissed his forehead.</p><p class="p1">“Now then, when can we expect the nuptuals?” Draco rolled his eyes.</p><p class="p1">“I’ve been affianced for all of twenty minutes mother,” he said.</p><p class="p1">“Draco your father had a marriage prepared for you at conception,” Narcissa said. Draco shuddered at the thought. Lucius had thoughtfully, prepared for the contingency that Draco might by interested in boys by keeping Theodore Nott on the back burner, as well as Astoria Greengrass.</p><p class="p1">“Right,” Draco tried not to think too hard on that one. Neither Theo nor Astoria were exactly his ideal match, though ironically they had ended up with one another, which Draco supposed was fitting.</p><p class="p1">“Of course we’ll consult with you, mother,” Harry said.</p><p class="p1">Narcissa smiled, “Thank you Harry darling.”</p><p class="p2" align="center">* * *</p><p class="p1">Their wedding occurred the following June at Malfoy Manor, just after Draco’s 22<span class="s1"><sup>nd</sup></span> birthday. It was spectacularly lavish, even for a Malfoy affair, Narcissa had spared no expense at creating the perfect wedding for her boys. In jewel tones, Emerald, Sapphire, Ruby, offering them the better part of the Hogwarts houses, as a color scheme, sort of incidentally. Teddy was the ring bearer, and Draco and Harry had exchanged their own hand-written vows. All in all, it was a magical experience, Harry thought. </p><p class="p1">At the reception, toasts were given by Ron and Hermione and by Pansy and Blaise, and finally by Narcissa. Narcissa stood, proudly in her sapphire colored gown, and smiled at the assembled crowd. “Several years ago, during the height of the war, I never imagined that a day like this could be possible,” she began. The room fell deathly silent as she spoke. “As the war dragged on, I watched my son slowly devolve into a shell of the boy I had raised. His life, irreparably damaged by the actions of his parents,” she paused, tears starting to prickle at the corner of her eyes as she tried to catch her breath. Molly Weasley, who had been sitting at the same table as hers, kindly pressed her hand to Narcissa’s elbow, and the blonde woman was grateful for the kind peace offering. “When Harry was brought to the Manor by snatchers, I thought for sure our lives were going to be hell forever. Then my sister, demanded Draco be the one to identify him. To everyone’s great shock, and dismay, Draco said he didn’t recognize him. He lied and Harry and his friends escaped. At that moment, I knew, that my son was in love with Harry Potter,” Narcissa wiped her eyes, her hands shaking slightly as she continued. “After that night in the Forbidden Forrest where I was fortunate enough to be the one to check on Harry’s would-be corpse, I knew the moment I felt his heart beating that the only way I could ever get my son back was to do what he had done. To face the Dark Lord, and lie. For a long time after that, I never thought I’d see Draco happy again, and then Harry came into his world and suddenly, it was as if someone had turned on a light behind Draco’s eyes again. That spark that had been missing for so long was back. My son had returned. I tend to detest the term soulmate. It feels, slightly contrived. Many said Lucius and I were soulmates, so perhaps the word has merely been soured for me. But I do know this. If soulmates are a thing, then no two souls are more perfect for each other than that of my son Draco and his husband. Harry. Harry, I am so proud to call you my son-in-law, and I am so proud that you are the second son I always dreamed I would get to have, and Draco. My precious dragon. You have are, more amazing than I ever could have hoped. More full of love than you could ever express, and more loving than anyone I know. I love you both,” she said. Harry wept, as Draco held his hand tight. There was not a dry eye in the assembled group. And Harry knew, Narcissa was the best mother-in-law he had ever hoped for. His parents would be so proud, he thought. </p>
