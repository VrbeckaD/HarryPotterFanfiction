    <p>This is such a fun game. It reminds you of when you were young, of watching little animals face their natural predators. Watching that large tabby cat, stalk a small bird with a broken wing, watching it creep ever so quiet before ambushing it, just one clench of its jaw and that little baby bird was dead, and your heart was beating in a way you’ve been looking to imitate forever more. You see yourself in that cat, slinking through his thoughts, just waiting for him to let you in, because he has to eventually. Harry is not a little bird though, he’s more of a mouse, scuttling through the world, not able to fly away from his fate, but still ever so vulnerable to his natural predators. As much as you are envious of the cat, of its simple way of killing that was so gorgeous, you want to be slower. To have him know that his death is coming, to keep him alive just to play with him, just to see the fear and the hope in his eyes. Oh, how you want it. Want it more than anything in the world, to see him scared, to see him the moment before you clench your jaws. To see him just before he dies in your arms. But for now, he watches you with suspicion. </p><p>You’ll be the cat and he’ll be the mouse.   </p><p>This is such a fun game. Even if you’ve been waiting for so long, just waiting and waiting and waiting for it to properly start. Everything in your life seems so boring these days because he is not yet a part of your life. If he were here, you could entertain yourself for hours. You could sit across from him, slowly peel him apart without ever even touching him. Strip him of all that he is, all that he professes to be, just cut him right back to the bone, expose the raw nerves and let him bleed out. Oh, how you can almost hear his sweet little groans, those eyes spread so wide as they beg you to let him live. You know you’d want to kill him, but you also know you couldn’t, not when you could <em>play</em> with him. You know that him being so vulnerable would be far too tempting a possibility to pass up. So instead you will save him. But not only that, you will build him back up just as you stripped him down, build him and build him, each time getting that much closer to making him in your own image. Make him into something perfect, something just like you. He will be your experiment, your demonstration, just your opportunity to show to everyone what you can do, even to the things they think are simply untouchable. That you can taint the <em>boy who lived</em> just as much as he has tainted you. But for now, you stand, and you wait for this game to really begin.  </p><p>You’ll be the cat and he’ll be the mouse. </p><p>This is such a fun game. Just seeing him sitting on his bed tearing himself apart, does he love you or does he loathe you? Does he like you being here when he is alone, or would he rather never see you again? You hope he likes you because you like him. He is everything that you want, a companion, a friend, a person who understands the very depths of your soul. None of your ‘friends’ did. But <em>he</em> does. You can see it in his eyes. He would love to get to know you, he’d hate it too. That is the best combination that you can think of, him caught in a pleasure-pain, a love-hate, where he despises every inch of you but simply can’t get enough. A world where he wants more and more of you because you are his drug and he is an addict. You can’t wait to see how far he’ll go to get you, to watch him sink his teeth into you, to see the red between the white and the horror in his eyes as he realises what he’s becoming. Just the thought of it causes shivers down your spine, a spreading warmth in your stomach, all at the imagined feeling of his teeth buried deep into your shoulder. You’d let him bite harder, eat you if he wanted, as long as it let out that darker side of him. The one that you know lurks just underneath the surface of his skin. The one he likes to pretend isn’t real, because he is respectable, because he is normal. Though he’s not. He’s really not. But for now, he ignores you. </p><p>You’ll be the cat and he’ll be the mouse. </p><p>This is such a fun game. You watching him, him watching you. Always across the room, for he never lets you be alone with him, never lets you stand too close. He’s scared. You can see it in his eyes, he’s scared that he’ll like it, that you’ll show him something he can’t resist. You don’t mind. You’re quite happy to play the long game if that’s what he wants. You’re quite happy to lurk in the shadows and wait. To slowly edge closer and closer to him until its too late for him to get away. If he wants to turn this into <em>that</em> sort of game, then you’re happy to oblige. You just love games. Love the idea of watching and waiting and watching and waiting and slowly, ever so slowly, creeping into his life, spilling all over his world until he simply can’t deny you. You want him looking over his shoulder, down every corridor, scared for his life but unable to tell anyone why. To have his heart pounding at the very thought of you, at <em>every</em> thought of you. You swallow and smile. He doesn’t smile back. Oh, how you can’t wait for the day that he does. For the day that he smiles back with his mouth, but his eyes stay sullen for he knows he has fallen in love; because he will fall in love, everyone does with you, sooner or later. That’s just what happens, there is something so completely – irresistible about you, not that you’re complaining. Not if it will help you win this game, and it <em>will</em> help you win. But for now, you just have to come out of the shadows and hope he sees you.  </p><p>You’ll be the cat and he’ll be the mouse. </p><p>This is such a fun game. He plays along so perfectly even though doesn’t even know what you’re going to do to him when you catch him. He couldn’t possibly comprehend all the possibilities that swarm your brain like a plague of locusts. But you’re waiting, waiting ever so patiently for when he finally relinquishes that control and you can pounce. For the moment he forgets himself and lets you in, lets you touch him, wrap your fingers around his throat and see your beautiful creation, touch him and touch him and taste him. It’ll be like having yourself to do to as you please. Perhaps that makes you a narcissist, to so badly want something that looks like you, acts like you, is like you. Malfoy always used to call you one. He liked to press your back against the yellow wallpaper and spit those words out ever so slowly: narcissist, psychopath, Machiavellian, monster. You love every single one. You loved to hear him say them, to murmur them over and over and over, as he pressed you against the white sheets dyed red by the sun. You hope that Harry can learn to say them too, that he too can learn to love those words. But that is for the future when he has admitted that he’s lost in love; but for now, he half-watches you, while pretending he sees nothing. </p><p>You’ll be the cat and he’ll be the mouse. </p><p>This is such a fun game. Though you don’t like when other people get too close to him, when other people threaten to join your entertainment because that is not the idea. He is yours and yours alone. This life was made only for the two of you, to dance around each other, to move in that striking circle of death, to perform a duet where you are the predator and he is the prey. Both your lives are destined to end with you holding each other as the world burns hot on your backs. You wish that he would understand the things you’d do for him. The people you’d tear apart if they hurt him, you’d burn worlds for him if he asked, and you so badly want him to ask. You want, no, need, to show him the things that you’d do for him, because even if he’s your prey, he’s still special. You love him in a way, and other people would call it twisted. Call it warped and disturbed. They’d call you crazy for daring to utter that word, they say that love’s a weakness, a limitation, a vulnerability. But it all depends on who you’re giving your heart to. Harry’s not a weakness, he’s an opportunity, and if gives up his heart with as much willingness as you do your own, his opportunities will be endless. But for now, you just edge closer, smiling when he doesn’t move away.</p>
