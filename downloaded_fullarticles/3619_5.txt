          <div class="userstuff"><p>A young girl, age eleven, stood nervously in a line of other eleven year olds. <br/>All of them fidgeted, but they had no reason to worry. <br/>They all had normal hair, apart from a blue haired girl, so why were they nervous? <br/>"RAVENCLAW"<br/>The hat roared as a young ginger bound over to the roaring table. <br/>So far, a young black haired one had been sorted to slytherin, an olive haired to ravenclaw, a blonde to hufflepuff, a redhead to griffindor, an ash haired kid had been, after long debate by the hat, sorted into hufflepuff and a orange haired girl was back in ravenclaw. <br/>Now only two students remained, the young girl was last. <br/>She nervously fumbled with her hair as she debated what house she would land in.  <br/>Slowly, the blue haired sat down and as the hat was lowered down, it visibly tensed. <br/>"Blue eh?"<br/>It muttered. <br/>"Unusual but...well I guess it's RAVENCLAW!"<br/>The blue haired kid jumped up, almost tripping as she scurried towards the table. <br/>Clasping her hands nervously, the last girl slowly walked forward and she could hear confused muttering. <br/>She kept toying with her brilliant purple hair as the hat lowered itself. <br/>But instead of any muttering or thinking, the moment the hat was placed on her head, all it let out was one low bark. <br/>"...What."</p><p>Behind her a young teacher with blue eyes and greyish hair pushed a strand asside, glancing at the headmistress confused. <br/>"Maybe we should have a better sorting mechanism."</p></div>
