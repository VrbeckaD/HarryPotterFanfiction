    <p>Dragons in Hogwarts<br/>
Chapter 1</p>
<p>Privet Drive was a ‘perfectly normal’ street in a ‘perfectly normal’ neighbourhood of prefabricated, standard template houses. Over five years ago, the sight of the patrol car would have resulted in twitched curtains and not-so-quiet whispers. These days, the gossips don’t really notice it. They are used to one of the local officers collecting young Dudley every Saturday. They think the nice officer is taking him on an excursion, as a distraction, while his mother gets her regular house-call from a doctor after the home-invasion incident when he was younger. What they don’t know, is Dudley is visiting his father, who is in jail for defrauding the government over ‘caring’ for his cousin Harry. His father was also doing time for cooking the Books at Grunnings. Dudley wasn’t happy with his father’s actions, but he was <em> still </em>  his father, and Dudley was no longer the selfish prick he was when he was six.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Dudley was a spoiled-brat, and grossly overweight. To the casual observer, it would be an even-bet as to whether he would have his first heart attack or his first jail stint by the age of twelve. These days, while he was still a little bit pudgy, he was getting healthier, and the regular boxing lessons he took twice a week at the YMCA helped to channel his aggressive impulses.</p>
<p>Dudley waved goodbye to the Sergeant and, instead of heading for the front door, took the side gate, where he heard voices coming from the garden. Inside were two girls. They were both slightly taller than he was and could easily be mistaken for sisters. One had red hair with pink tips, and the other had leaf-green hair with red tips.<br/>
“Hi Dudley,” greeted the red-haired girl, as she trimmed back one of the rose bushes. This was his cousin, Dorea. Dudley was one of the few people who knew this, and he had only figured it out by accident.</p>
<p>As far as the neighbourhood was concerned, Dorea was one of the daughters of a high-up from the Interspecies Cultural Exchange Program and his ‘delinquent’ cousin, Harry, died in a construction site accident while skipping school. The official police report says that Harry fell down an embankment, and triggered an unexploded WWII bomb the builders had uncovered while preparing the newly-extended Hyacinth Drive for new houses. He only found out after he had figured out who Dorea really was, that her adoptive parents used their contacts in the government to kill ‘Harry’ with a claymore-mine and something called a quick-clone.<br/>
Dorea stood up and stretched, unfurling her wings as she did so. “Aunt Petunia’s check-up should be done soon.” Small sparks of lightning travelled from her pink-tipped red hair to her red-and-pink feathered wings.</p>
<p>Yeah, his cousin is a dragon.</p>
<p>…well, sort of. From what he understood, there was a special type of magic that allowed a witch or wizard to change to and from an animal, such as a bear or an owl. Due to various circumstances, of which Dudley wasn’t proud, ‘Harry’ ended up being rescued, and then adopted, by an <em> actual </em>  dragon. After being checked over by their family doctor, and removing several spells placed on her as an infant, it turned out that Uncle James and Aunt Lily had used magic to disguise their child as a boy. Given what the bad guys did to girls in some of the movies he watched, he understood why.</p>
<p>Dorea’s magic responded to her new situation by latching on to her adopted family, and her magic changed her to blend in. Dudley knew Dorea could still change back to being human, but because her ‘dragon self’ can change into a humanoid form, and she doesn’t feel safe as a human, Dorea doesn’t <em> <strong>  want </strong> </em>  to change back.</p>
<p>Dudley doesn’t blame her. Not long after ‘Harry’ died a wizard showed up, stunned him, and tried to forcibly drag the information on what happened to ‘Harry’ from his mother’s mind, leaving her drooling on the floor and with no memories beyond when she was fifteen. Once a week, a doctor from ICEP comes and checks up on her, both to see if any of her former memories have returned, and to ensure she hasn’t had further memory loss. The doctors that usually come are either one of Dorea’s adoptive parents, or her adoptive aunt.</p>
<p>“So, is he talking to you yet?” asked Dorea, referring to his Dad.</p>
<p>“Sort of,” replied Dudley. “He’s still not happy about the whole ‘magic’ thing. Dad also still blames you for his being in there.”</p>
<p>“At least he’s stopped demanding that the prison Chaplain ‘exorcise’ you,” commented Violet, Dorea’s older ‘sister’ (by only a few days) and a different type of dragon. </p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Dudley conceded. “Even without the faulty blood wards that used to be around this place, Dad is a bad person, but he’s still my Dad.”</p>
<p>Violet unwound a set of vines from her red-tipped green hair, without using her hands, ran a hand through it, and rewound the vines.<br/>
“I wish I could do that,” Dorea commented jokingly, as she readjusted her own hair-ties with her hands. “Being part Dryad has its perks.”</p>
<p>“There you are, Dudley,” commented Petunia from the back door. “Fern has ordered a car to collect her and the girls. Do you want to go to the park with them?”</p>
<p>Around ten minutes later, a Land Rover belonging to the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce rolled into the driveway. Fern, an adult Dryad (and one of Violet’s parents) stepped out of the front door to greet the driver, a slender 20-year-old woman with auburn hair, wearing a British Army uniform with UNIT insignias. Her ID-badge proclaimed her to be ‘Shizu Pleiades, UNIT-ICEP liaison’.</p>
<p>“Aunt Shizu!” chorused the girls, as they rushed out to hug the woman.</p>
<p>“I still don’t agree with their lifestyle,” Petunia whispered to Dudley, “But it’s good that they love their children, and treat Dorea as one of their own, which is something I am shocked that my past self could never do. I cannot believe I became that petty and jealous over Lily being a witch.”</p>
<p>Dudley was still piecing together how Dorea’s family was structured. From what he could figure out, Violet’s parents were Fern and Mizuchi (although he still couldn’t figure out how the Dryad and Dragon could have a baby, as they were both female). Fern also had a boyfriend, a wizard called Reg. One of Violet’s little sisters, Venus, was their child. They also had another sister, Juniper, who was a human-sized version of one of Fern’s Hornet-pixies. The girl in the Land Rover, Shizu, was Mizuchi’s girlfriend (he caught them kissing a couple of times). Surprisingly, the four adults didn’t get into fights over ‘sharing’ each other.  The adults all love their children, even the ones they weren’t the ‘actual’ parents of. What was there to disapprove of?</p>
<p>Shizu stood up, after she finished hugging the girls. “These arrived in Friday’s mail-drop. Magic-division say they’re clean.” She produced several letters and handed one to Dudley.<br/>
Dudley examined the letter in his hands. It was made from that fancy ‘parchment’ stuff that his friend Raymond’s mum used for her calligraphy projects. It was addressed in green ink:</p>
<p>
  <em> <strong> Mr D Dursley </strong><br/>
The second bedroom,<br/>
4 Privet Drive,<br/>
Little Whinging, Surrey.<br/>
Deliver via the mail room,<br/>
UNIT HQ<br/>
London. </em>
</p>
<p>Petunia gasped. “Is that what I think it is?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Shizu. “That is Dudley’s invitation to attend Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“I thought the owls delivered then directly,” Petunia commented.</p>
<p>“They do,” replied Shizu. “However, in order to remove all of those Wards that were woven over Surrey, Mizuchi destabilised the ley-lines in the area. Owls cannot track anyone accurately around here, so we have mail redirection runes to send the owls to either UNIT HQ or the nearest ICEP office.”</p>
<p>Dorea looked confused and held up both of her letters. “Why have I got two?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” Shizu replied. “Considering the Magical Government has only just agreed to let demi-humans and suchlike to attend Hogwarts, my best guess is that your magic signature when you’re a dragon is sufficiently different to when you’re human that it has confused whatever system sends out the letters.”<br/>
Dudley craned over her shoulder and looked at the letters. The first one was addressed as:</p>
<p>
  <em> <strong> Miss D Kobayashi </strong><br/>
The Second bed, Northern bedroom,<br/>
Artificial Satellite Pleiades,<br/>
Magellan’s Cluster.<br/>
Deliver via the mail room,<br/>
UNIT HQ,<br/>
London </em>
</p>
<p>The second letter had the same location and delivery instructions but was addressed to ‘Miss D Peverell-Potter’ instead.<br/>
A devilish grin appeared on Fern’s face. “Mizuchi’s going to have a field day with this.”</p>
<p>===//===</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall placed the stack of reply letters that she had just divided between herself, Fillius and Pomona on the desk. This year was most important for two reasons. The first being that Albus had stopped being stubborn and finally removed those spells from the Book of Names, allowing those with creature inheritances to enrol. The second being James’ and Lily’s child was due to start this year. As she read through them, she sorted them between ‘attending’, ‘not attending’ and ‘muggle-born guide needed’ in front of her.<br/>
Six replies in, and Minerva gasped. She removed a familiar sheet of pink paper from the muggle envelope, and tipped it upside down, to have another envelope fall onto her desk. It was larger than the first envelope. There was only one person she knew who could make an envelope bigger on the inside without using charms or runes. Minerva picked up the page and read:</p>
<p>
  <em> Dear Deputy Headmistress McGonagall,<br/>
Thank you for your letters inviting my children to attend Hogwarts. They have expressed their interest in attending, primarily because Dorea’s biological parents were former students and she feels that going to the same school as them might allow her to make a connection with them.<br/>
Please find enclosed medical and dietary documents for Madame Pomphrey. ICEP will also provide extra funding for the increased food budget. Please inform the House-elves, so they may adjust accordingly.<br/>
Additionally, we can provide some of our people to assist with guiding the Squib-born children for their first trip to Diagon Alley.<br/>
Mizuchi Kobayashi-O’Reilly<br/>
PS: We need to meet sometime, to discuss Dorea’s bonded Familiar. </em>
</p>
<p>===//===</p>
<p>Georgie Paladin was talking to her new friend, Hermione Granger, while waiting with their parents, in front of the old record store on Charing Cross road.  Everyone was soon joined by Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>“Good morning Professor,” greeted Mr Paladin. “You mentioned there would be some more people coming.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied the witch. “We have a family of demi-humans joining us.”</p>
<p>They heard, then saw, the arrival of the demi-human family mere moments later.</p>
<p>Approaching the group were two adults and four children.</p>
<p>The first adult was around average height and size, had pointed ears and leaf-green hair. There were vines draped over her shoulders. She was dressed similarly to a government employee. She looked like the ‘typical’ image of a Dryad from her story books, except she was wearing clothing. There were even several Hornet-pixies swarming in and out of the Dryad’s hair.</p>
<p>The other adult was six feet tall and quite curvy. She had swept-back horns protruding from her blue-tipped red hair and had purple dragon-scaled wings with pale blue membranes. She was wearing yellow-tinted glasses and a pale blue, floor-length, silk dress. Her bladed tail protruded from near the top of the dress’ skirt. She was obviously a dragon, or at least part-dragon.</p>
<p>Hovering backwards, slightly ahead of the group, was a human-sized Hornet-pixie. She was wearing mechanic’s overalls over a modified pink t-shirt (with four sleeves, and holes cut out for her wings) and loosely wore a tool belt around her waist. Her four arms were gesticulating expressively, as she spoke to the one of the smaller Hornet-pixies.</p>
<p>On the right of the group was a girl with a mixture of the Dryad’s and the Dragon’s features. The red tips on her leaf-green hair were the same shade as the adult dragon, and it was obvious that she was their child. She was dressed similarly to the adult dragon, but in pale green. <em>  I’ll have to ask mummy and daddy how two girls can have babies, </em>  she thought to herself.</p>
<p>In the centre of the group was a girl with pink-tipped red hair. She had similar glasses to the adult dragon and was dressed in Emerald-green. She was another dragon, but with feathers instead of scales.</p>
<p>The last member of the group was a Harpy. Her feathers and hair were almost pure white, with black tips. She was wearing a pink tank-top, to keep freedom of movement for her wings. Bike shorts could clearly be seen protruding under her violet skirt. She was also clinging tightly to the feathered dragon’s arm.</p>
<p>As they began making their introductions to each other, Professor McGonagall was mildly surprised to find out the Granger family were acquainted with the Kobayashi family. Both dentists provided services to patients from London’s ICEP medical services, and the Dryad (Fern) was their face-to-face contact with the organisation.</p>
<p>While Fern was making the introductions, Mizuchi (the adult dragon) squatted down to make eye-contact with Georgie. “Good job with your human form.” She spoke quietly, so the humans couldn’t hear. “Don’t give me that look. I know you’re a dragon. Both of my parents were human too …well, close enough to human… I was just lucky enough to grow up in an environment where I didn’t have to hide my wings. I’m sure if you ask them, my daughters will teach you how to fly.”</p>
<p>“H-how did you know?” asked Georgie.</p>
<p>Mizuchi gave her a strange look. “It’s your eyes. People don’t usually look too closely.” She lowered her glasses, and Georgie noticed that Mizuchi’s green eyes had vertical-slit pupils instead of the ‘normal’ round ones. Mizuchi stood up and straightened her dress. “Never be ashamed of who you truly are.”</p>
<p>“If everyone is ready,” McGonagall stated. “Let’s head inside.”</p>
<p>===//===</p>
<p>The looks of wonder on the Paladins’ and Grangers’ faces as the archway to Diagon unfolded was priceless. Anticipating this, Mizuchi had Gated to the other side a few minutes earlier, with a camera at the ready. “What? None of you thought to capture some photos?” she laughed. “I’ll send you copies.” She tossed Mr Granger and Mr Paladin a disposable camera each. “Here. You should capture your daughters’ important milestone.”</p>
<p>The newcomers looked around in wonder, as they headed towards the bank. Everything was so colourful. Once they arrived near the bank’s entrance, they read the sign with the warning and walked up to the door. Moments later, they were startled by a girl’s voice.</p>
<p>“VIOLET!”</p>
<p>Violet was suddenly crash-tackled to the ground by another dragon. She was dressed all in black, had light brown skin, and olive-green hair and wings.</p>
<p>“Fellblade! Gerroff!” laughed Violet.</p>
<p>“Make me!” Fellblade laughed back.</p>
<p>At McGonagall’s disapproving look, Fellblade got off her friend. “Grumpy-ass wand waver,” she grumbled.</p>
<p>“Don’t be like that,” said Dorea. “She’s the Deputy Headmistress. It’s her job to disapprove of us acting like ruffians.”</p>
<p>Fellblade looked up. “Is Juniper coming?”</p>
<p>“Yep,” replied the Hornet-girl, popping her ‘p’. “I had to defer my apprenticeship with 2nd Aviation Regiment. They got deployed.”</p>
<p>Fellblade pouted at the reply. “That sucks. I know how much you wanted to be a helicopter mechanic.”</p>
<p>“Minerva, allow me to introduce Fellblade Gringott,” said Mizuchi.</p>
<p>“Gringott?” McGonagall asked. “She’s goblin-raised? I was expecting a goblin student.”</p>
<p>“Culturally, she is a goblin,” confirmed Fern. “ Fellblade just gets some extra freedoms, not usually given to goblin children, due to needing to fly and needing to hunt. None of the dragons here were exactly raised normally. So, are we getting supplies as one big group, or are we splitting into smaller groups?”</p>
<p>“Given how cramped most of the stores are,” Mizuchi replied, “splitting into smaller groups would be better. Hermione should have access to the Dagworth-Granger vault, and Georgie being dragon-kin means that Empress Ragnarok will pay her education costs.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Empress Ragnarok?” asked Mrs Paladin.</p>
<p>“Me,” replied Mizuchi. “As much as the ‘normal’ dragons don’t like it, because they don’t think I’m a ‘real’ dragon, I’m the Alpha for every single dragon on any planet I step foot on. I have been ever since I witnessed the Untempered Schism. I just didn’t know it until I received the results of my Inheritance Test.”</p>
<p>===//===</p>
<p>Dorea and Hedwig ended up with the Grangers and Professor McGonagall. Hermione’s parents thought it was ‘adorable’ how the Harpy was a hugger.</p>
<p>“Your mother said she needed to talk to me about your Familiar,” McGonagall commented as they left Madam Malkins. “It is rare for someone so young to have one. However, the law is clear that we cannot deny you your Familiar.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to know,” replied Dorea, as she pulled her Harpy friend closer. “Hedwig is my Familiar.”</p>
<p>“WHAT?!” Hermione screeched, causing several people passing by to turn their heads. They then turned away, dismissing it as ‘just another muggle-born seeing/hearing something new’. “Owning another sentient being is wrong!”</p>
<p>“Not so loud, my ears are sensitive.” said Hedwig, as she took her wings off her ears. “Dorea has made it perfectly clear she doesn’t ‘own’ me. However, the bond has its benefits. For example, I get to share Dorea’s magic, and if it wasn’t for the Familiar Bond letting me ‘tap’ her magical core, I’d only be equivalent to a squib.”</p>
<p>McGonagall gestured to their next stop: Ollivander’s Wands. The six of them entered.</p>
<p>Half a dozen ‘failed’ wands later, and Hermione was the proud owner of a nine-inch vine wand, with a Unicorn-hair core.</p>
<p>“Dorea, we’ll need to sort out your wand next,” Ollivander commented. “It will affect the type of wand that will accept your Familiar.”</p>
<p>“Understood,” replied Dorea, as she stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Uh, Dorea…” Ollivander started. “I can’t start with you like that.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” Dorea almost whispered.</p>
<p>Hedwig stepped away from Dorea, faced the door, and transfigured her flight feathers to some sort of metal. It was like she was suddenly standing guard.</p>
<p><em> That’s a very impressive partial self-transfiguration, </em>  thought McGonagall. <em>  Why is she suddenly all defensive? </em></p>
<p>McGonagall turned at the collective gasp of the Grangers.<br/>
…and nearly passed out from shock…</p>
<p><em> She looks just like Lily, </em>  McGonagall thought. “M-miss Potter?”</p>
<p>After five years in hiding, and almost ten years since she personally last saw her, Dorea Potter was in front of her!</p>
<p>McGonagall looked angrily at Ollivander. “You knew!?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I knew,” Ollivander replied. “Most of the Retailers’ Association know.” Ollivander chuckled. “Thanks to Dorea’s adoptive parents, we’re protected from thieves Obliviating us to hide their theft, I don’t have to dance to that old coot’s tune, when it comes to who gets certain wands.” He laughed as he placed a box on the counter and opened it. “Dorea, could you pick this wand up for me please? A certain wizard was insistent that I made sure you had it.”</p>
<p>Dorea shrugged and picked up the wand.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Dorea commented.</p>
<p>Ollivander looked McGonagall in the eyes. “All Dorea can do with that wand is poke someone or throw it at them.”</p>
<p>“This is wand has a Phoenix feather core, right?” Dorea asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ollivander confirmed.</p>
<p>She looked back at McGonagall. “One of the down sides of being a Dragon, even an Animagus one, is that our magic is incompatible with Phoenix magic.” An ornate sword suddenly materialised in her free hand. “ <strong> This </strong>  is my current spell-focus, but waving this around in Charms class could cause some issues.”</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, and Dorea was back in her dragon form, sliding her Dryad-wood and Thunderbird-feather wand into her wrist holster.<br/>
Hedwig’s wand was chosen much easier. It was made from the same materials but was only an inch shorter.</p>
<p>They spent an hour longer than ‘planned’ in Flourish &amp; Blotts. <em> Now I know why the bookstore was at the end of our itinerary. These three are Ravenclaws for sure. </em></p>
