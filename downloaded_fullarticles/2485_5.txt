<p>chapter 1</p>
<p>Rating- M</p>
<p>His hand slipped up the back of my jumper, just like it always did when he thought I was asleep… but I never was... I stayed awake most nights, fear making my muscles taut. His hand moved up my back out of the jumper, it slipped up to my hair; he had me wear it long. With mock tenderness the fingers ran through the locks, I looked over my shoulder, the scent of my fear thick in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Be a good little boy," He growled, pulling me up from my sleeping position to get a better look at me, inspecting my face with a small sneer. I looked up into his eyes, so much like my own; my voice failed me as I let out a small whimper. "That's a good boy…" He growled and pushed me down, making my small, 7-year-old body fall to the floor. I knew what he wanted me to do, and I got to it; I didn't need another break to my already large nose.</p>
<p>Soon he was pushing his way into the back of my throat. Tears streamed down my face as I let him take liberties, hoping he would just finish like this…but to no such luck; he pulled me up with a snide comment, licking the tears from my cheeks, then pushed me back into my small mattress, pulling my hips into the air.</p>
<p>The scream that pierced the night sky was what woke me from my dreams, my body shaking. Tears came as I hid in my pillow, hoping to not wake up schoolmates.</p>
<p>~8~</p>
<p>I looked down at the simple marble marker that the ministry had given to the bane of my life. With a snort, I gave it a good kick, hearing the cracks forming within the cheap stone.</p>
<p>"Daddy, dearest," I sneered and shook my head, not bothering to brush the lank hair from my face.</p>
<p>~8~</p>
<p>Shock ran through my body as I looked at the small girl sitting on the three-legged stool. She looked so bright and happy as the hat yelled out her new house: Gryffindor. I nodded at the small boy that followed her as he was sorted into my house, but my eyes returned to the small girl, searching for what I had seen as she had entered the Great Hall. Her bushy hair seemed to hide her slightly too-thin throat, yet when she entered the Great Hall she had pushed her hair back off her shoulders...</p>
<p>Then as she jumped slightly from the ghost rising through the food-laden table, there it was again; four yellow bruises on her neck. I knew those kind of marks… those were from harsh fingers.</p>

<p>A/N: So what do you think?</p>
