          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Come on. You can do this. It’s only seven words. Do you want to go out with me? You defeated Voldemort. You can ask someone out.” Harry kept muttering encouragements to himself under his breath as he paced around the astronomy tower. It was 8th year, and after he had testified for Draco and his mother at their trials the boys had become more close. Not quite best friends, but the start of something. Harry hoped.</p><p>After Harry had asked Ginny out in 7th year, he thought he had found his soulmate. But then, and he hated to think it, Neville got hot. Really hot. And he started questioning his thoughts. When he and Ginny had kissed for the first time, it felt right. But when they broke up and Harry had been dared to kiss Seamus, that felt right too. After lots of input from Hermione and an impromptu lesson about sexuality and gender and more things he did <em>not </em>need to know, he realized he was bisexual.</p><p>And he had a crush on Draco Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>He and Draco were hanging out in between classes more often, and, shocking their professors and classmates, patterning up by choice in their classes. They helped get rid of the rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin, and more people from each house felt comfortable being friends.</p><p>So why was he so nervous? It’s not like asking someone was the hardest thing he’d ever done, he’d done it before. So why was Draco any different?</p><p>He’d told Draco to meet him in the astronomy tower after their last classes. It had been 10 minutes since classes were let out. Draco was not one to be late, so Harry worried. He debated going back down when he heard footsteps coming up the stairs.</p><p>“Harry?” A familiar voice called out, bringing Harry relief. Harry could see his platinum blond hair as Draco rounded the corner.</p><p>“Hey, Draco. So, uh, I wanted to ask you something.” Harry could feel his cheeks get warm. His heart was racing and he was having more anxiety than he could ever remember having.</p><p>“Yes?” Draco raised an eyebrow and smiled gently. Harry felt his heart beat calm down a bit.</p><p>“So, I know that we’re friends now. We are friends, right?” Harry stalled, trying to avoid the question he so desperately wanted to ask.</p><p>“Yes, of course we’re friends now Harry. Are you alright? Did you hit your head in quidditch?” Draco had a playful tone to his voice and he laughed quietly.</p><p>“So um, I just wanted to say that I, I,” Harry struggled to get the words out.</p><p>“Merlin Harry, what is it?”</p><p>“I, I like you! I like, really, really like you Draco.” Harry blurted out. “ And I wanted to ask if you wanted to go out with me sometime?”</p><p>Draco blushed from his cheeks to the tips of his ears. He opened and closed his mouth, trying to speak but nothing coming out.</p><p>A feeling of dread hit Harry like a ton of bricks.</p><p>“Harry…” Draco had a pity in his eyes.</p><p>“Fuck,” Harry whispered.</p><p>“I do like you. Just not like that. I’m, I’m sorry.” Draco stepped towards Harry, but he pulled away.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Harry I’m sorry. Really.”</p><p>“No. It’s fine. Really.” Harry spun on his heels and started quickly going down the stairs. Draco called after him but Harry didn’t turn.</p><p>Harry ran back to the Gryffindor common room, cursing the prickling heat rising up behind his eyes.</p><p>Harry and Draco didn’t talk for a while after that. And when they did start talking again, it was never the same.</p></div>
