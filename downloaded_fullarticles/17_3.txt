</p><p>Severus didn't take the train with Irene on the first day of September of the sixth year of school.</p><p>He and his mother Eileen, thanks to the scholarship obtained by the boy, had managed to collect the money necessary for the move. They had sold the dusty and sad house in Spinner's end and had found an apartment on the top floor of an inn.</p><p>His mom worked in a herb and potion shop and finally some more money began to facilitate the life of their small family. Severus had bought new clothes that finally fit him perfectly. Now that he lived in Hogsmeade, the boy was closer to school and no longer had to leave the wizarding world he loved so much.</p><p>The only person he missed was Irene.</p><p>Irene was happy for Severus.</p><p>He had written to her all summer and she had kept every letter. His new home was finally what he had always wanted: a place where he could freely express all his magic. He and his mom no longer had to hide.</p><p>Irene had had fun during the summer, but not seeing Severus had been difficult. Sometimes she had nightmares, sometimes she woke up believing he was there next to her, sometimes she dreamed of his sweet kisses and his hands that touched her soft skin. The ocean and the sun were less inviting without him.</p><p>Irene loved her parents and family, but she missed Severus and couldn't wait to meet the boy again at Hogwarts.<br/>_</p><p>At school things had really changed and Severus had been right.</p><p>Irene and the Marauders were good friends, but she had certainly not abandoned Severus! The two were an unbeatable team, enough to envy James, Sirius, Remus and Peter.</p><p>During the week they made jokes with each other: when Sirius transformed Irene's nose into that of a pig, she and Severus found a way to offer him a potion that had transformed his hair into straw branches.</p><p>When James found a way to detonate dragon fart firecrackers in the Slytherin common room, Irene and Severus managed to correct the Gryffindor dinner with a laxative potion.</p><p>Then, on the weekends, they all met to drink a butterbeer in Hogsmeade, and were always guests of the Unicorn Inn, where Severus lived.</p><p>Severus had learned to be in the company of those boys, who had apologized to him for all the mistreatment that Severus had been forced to suffer. They had apologized so many times that he had stopped counting them by now.</p><p>However, not all the friendships born in those years were destined to survive.</p><p>Lucius and Narcissa avoided Severus and Irene's company altogether.</p><p>Nobody among the Slytherins dared to insult Severus: after all he had won the Triwizard Tournament.</p><p>For Irene it was different: the fact that she had explicitly befriended the Marauders made her the target of annoying gossip.</p><p>Irene didn't care. Until then, no offense had been done to her and, moreover, she was used to spending time alone if necessary. Irene had not stopped being Hogwarts' black sheep, although now the reason was different: her friendships were strange.<br/>_</p><p>It was the last weekend before the beginning of the Christmas holidays and the group of friends had gathered in the Unicorn Inn.</p><p>Sirius and James were discussing whether it was more convenient to use spells or potions for their future jokes, Peter gnawed his favorite licorice, Remus silently drank his butterbeer and Severus and Irene laughed listening to friends' speeches.</p><p>After a few moments they were joined at the table by Severus' mother, who had just finished working.</p><p>"Good afternoon guys, are you all right?" asked the lady.<br/>"It's all right, Ms. Prince. We are celebrating the end of the lessons!" James exclaimed. Everyone smiled.</p><p>"Also we had to say goodbye to Severus in the right way. He doesn't take the train with us tomorrow..." Irene commented, kissing her boyfriend. He nodded.</p><p>"Sweetheart, we've already talked about it, I'm flattered by your family's invitation, but I can't accept it. I know you'll miss me, I'll miss you too. But I have to stay, I don't want to leave my mom alone during the holidays...".</p><p>Severus was sincere and considerate of his mom. She was his only family. However, that year Eileen was supposed to work: the village would fill up for the Christmas holidays and she could not celebrate.</p><p>She knew that her son never wanted to ask her to join Irene, leaving her alone during the holidays, but Eileen was thrilled to see Severus finally surrounded by friends and in the company of an adorable girl who seemed to have a real and sincere affection for him. And besides, Christmas was a celebration to spend in the company of loved ones. She could have given him a different Christmas than usual.</p><p>"Honey, maybe... Maybe you could spend this Christmas with Irene. I would be sorry to see you work on Christmas, you study so much and you have obtained excellent school results. Leave tomorrow, take the train with Irene and go to Hastings with her, what do you think?" Eileen said to her son and ruffled his hair with tenderness.</p><p>Severus' eyes lit up, the boy stood up and hugged his mom. He was moved! Irene smiled and clapped her hands.</p><p>"Hurray! We have to celebrate, let's order another butterbeer!" she exclaimed and everyone applauded. It would have been a really special Christmas.</p>
