    <p>It wasn't as if any of them had anticipated how things would turn out. Neither of them had believed anyone would live to see times as dark as these. Harry was dead. The Dark Lord was gathering his strength once more, but he didn't need to be present for the world to fall to pieces. His followers were ever-present and strong enough in numbers to make life for them living hell. </p>
<p>Hermione kept staring into the night. It had become her thinking spot. Here, on the astronomy tower, where Dumbledore had been murdered almost two years ago, she had the much needed quiet to hear her own thoughts and had a constant reminder why they kept going. </p>
<p>The dark stretched over the Forbidden Forest. Somewhere in there where the centaurs patrolling their territory. It wasn't a service provided to the hand full of witches and wizards at Hogwarts, who were busying themselves with rebuilding the school. It was a necessity as Voldemort's followers had intruded the Forbidden Forest before, by what was now known as The Battle of Hogwarts, to recruit them. Many of the centaurs had died. The grudge they had been holding against the Wizarding World had run deep even before that, now it was a miracle in Hermione's eyes that they didn't seek out wandering witches and wizards to inflict their revenge. </p>
<p>Centaurs where better than that, although Firenze had made it clear that the only reason none of the centaurs had killed her when she had crossed paths with them while out in the Forbidden Forest to gather herbs, was that she had been Harry Potter's friend. It had been the Centaur's last service to the Boy Who Lived, nowadays known as The Boy Who Died. </p>
<p>Pain blossomed in her chest and she let out a shaky breath. That was what the Daily Prophet called him nowadays: The Boy Who Died. </p>
<p>Gnawing on her bottom lip she wrapped her robe tighter around her. Not only her life had become a mess after Harry had died. Things had changed. She wasn't sure if for the better or worse. The world hung in a delicate balance and it had yet to tip. </p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>It had been an epic battle. At least, that was what the rest of the world had read in the press. It had been brutal, desperate and filled with so much violence and death, Hermione was sure the next five generations at Hogwarts would be able to see the Thestrals pulling the carriages from Hogsmeade train station to the castle. If the school would ever reopen that was. </p>
<p>Closing her eyes she remembered hugging Harry goodbye, tears streaming down her face, before he had gone into the Forbidden Forest to face down their enemy, alone. Harry had come back, cradled in Hagrid's arms, a dead cold body. She saw the shell of her best friend being dropped to the floor by the shaking giant, could hear the laughter of the creature they had called Lord like a whisper carried in the cold wind. </p>
<p>Harry hadn't been dead. Not then. He had groaned and coughed while scrambling back to his feet, clutching his wand and aiming it at Voldemort. Things had gone out of hand then. Their curses had collided. Red and green light intertwined into each other until an explosion of power had knocked back almost everyone present in the courtyard. When the dust had settled, Voldemort had vanished, leaving nothing behind other than his yew wand, and Harry had been dead. This time for good. </p>
<p>She rolled her taut shoulders, stretched her stiff back. The clock struck three times. Hermione had been brooding for hours on end and just like all those nights before it didn't change a single thing. Harry was still dead and Voldemort was still out there. </p>
<p>The Wizarding World was holding its breath. No one wanted to admit that there was an ever so slight chance Voldemort could have survived, yet they were living in stifled suffocating fear with the recent events still so fresh in their memories one could still taste it in the air.</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>In the events following the battle, the school had been closed for months before reconstruction finally had begun. Previous professors and wizards and witches from Hogsmeade had rebuilt their homes alongside. During those months the ministry had undergone a complete reorganisation. Members of the Order, who had been working at the ministry previously, had not so much stepped up to the plate but had the responsibility to deal with the aftermath of everything been pushed onto them. A task force for the reformation of the Ministry of Magic had been installed. </p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>A new Wizengamot had been formed under Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley, which they had called The Wizarding Tribunal and which had entailed Sturgis Podmore and Hestia Jones. They had asked Hermione to take part as representative of the DA, now known as a sub-organisation to the Order of the Phoenix and for leading the Battle of Hogwarts. She had refused and in her stead, Neville Longbottom had taken the seat.</p>
<p>The clumsy boy had grown into a strong young man. They nominated Arthur Weasley for the leading seat of the Wizarding Tribunal as the public requested Shacklebolt to step up as Minister of Magic until things were settled. Rufus Scrimgeour was imprisoned, yet waiting for his sentence.</p>
<p>There had also been two ministry representatives nominated for the Wizarding Tribunal. Patricia Oldenstein, a half-blood witch in her mid-thirties, a prior ministry representative of the Muggle Liaison Office, and Geoffrey Williamsbourg, a muggle-born in his late fifties, with thin hair who had acted as an Auror during the First Wizarding War.  </p>
<p>Each representative of the Tribunal had undergone an inquiry under the influence of Veritaserum before they had been sworn in. The inquiry itself had taken place under the watchful eyes of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Aberforth Dumbledore, who had sworn the Unbreakable Vow not to speak of anything that they had heard during the extensive questionings.</p>
<p>Every newspaper, magazine and radio station known in the Wizarding World had covered every step the Wizarding Tribunal had taken. The Wizarding Tribunal had promised full transparency to the public and that was what the Wizarding Community got.</p>
<p>The remaining staff of the ministry was busy repairing muggle London and obliviating the public for them to forget magic existed. Memories of black shadows and flashes of light were replaced with explosions, gas leaks, fires and other accidents prone to the muggle world. The Prime Minister remaining the only person aware of the existence of the Wizarding World alongside the Queen herself. All the while ministry employee after ministry employee had been called into questioning to be cleared by the Wizarding Tribunal of any involvement in the doings of Voldemort and of aiding or abetting a Death Eater.</p>
<p>Things were progressing slowly in the Ministry. Each questioning took a tremendous amount of time with the ministry constantly running low on Veritaserum, all the while muggle London had to be brought under control and Death Eaters were still on the run. </p>
<p>After the peak of the Final Battle, where Harry had died, the Death Eaters had apparated away faster than the witches and wizards fighting them had been able to stun the cowards. Amongst the escapees were Death Eaters and Snatchers alike. Bellatrix Lestrange, Fenrir Greyback, the Snatcher Scabior - whose real name no one had found out yet - the Carrow siblings, Anthony Dolohov, the Nott family and Corban Yaxley were the names atop the list of Most Wanted Witches and Wizards.</p>
<p>Another unsolved and pressing issue where those who had escaped from Azkaban after Voldemort had destroyed half of it in order to free his loyal followers in preparation of the Second Wizarding War. The dementors were still not reinstated as guardians, their whereabouts unknown and due to their allegiance to Voldemort not trusted by the ministry. </p>
<p>Just because the war was over the world wasn't safe. There were too many loose ends, the society too shaken up to resume with their day to day life in a somewhat normal manner. </p>
