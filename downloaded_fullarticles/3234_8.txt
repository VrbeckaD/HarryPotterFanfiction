  <p>When Albus Dumbledore got in touch with him, Filius wasn't looking to take on an apprentice. That was, he thought, the province of duelists whose injuries or age were beginning to take a toll. Filius remembered Dumbledore well from his last few years at Hogwarts, though, as a talented professor of transfiguration who was able to help Filius in a subject of some difficulty, and for the sake of that assistance he was willing to hear the man out, if nothing else.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He had already made up his mind before they had gotten halfway through the pensieve, but Filius remained silent just so that he could see a few more memories. For a fourteen-year-old, the Riddle boy was astounding, and Filius said as much.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"And you have no misgivings about Tom?" Dumbledore had asked him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Only about his education," Filius replied. "Part of me wants him to withdraw from Hogwarts entirely, but I have to think about more than my legacy. Tom would be a living myth if I could get my hands on him year-round, the sort of being that people wouldn't believe in even when they were looking at him, but he wouldn't be a well-rounded wizard."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Dumbledore frowned then. "But his aggression," the professor tried again.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh. That," Filius said, and he gave a small shrug. "He's a Gryffindor. That is to be expected, isn't it? But don't worry. A red-hot blade is no good in a duel. I'll introduce some Ravenclaw temperance as well.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Thank you, Filius."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>That conversation weighed on Filius now, as he watched the Hogwarts Express unload, but it was only one of several things that were on his mind. There were lesson plans, mostly-complete but worth picking at and tinkering a few more times. The matter of Tom’s trainability, and whether the boy could acclimate to an apprentice’s lifestyle.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Ah, there was the boy now, stepping off the train. “Tom Riddle!” Filius called. Mindful that he might get overlooked in the crowd, Filius lifted his arm as he approached and, as he got a closer look at Tom, sighed a little on the inside. It was true that Filius had come to terms with his height a long time ago (indeed, his stature even had its uses) but he had graduated from Hogwarts decades ago and it was a little depressing to realize that, his arm in the air as it was, he might just barely be able to put his hand on Tom Riddle’s shoulder.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Tom Riddle,” he said again once he was closer, and he followed it up with a quick duelist’s bow which, after a moment’s hesitation, Tom mimicked. The act was performed a little awkwardly, with a suitcase held in either of his hands, but Filius wasn’t going to hold that against the boy. Attention to form could come later.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Master Flitwick. I wish to thank you again, now that we’re meeting in person,” Tom said. There was a stunned look to the boy’s eyes that was a little bit as though he’d been stupefied. Was it awe that Filius saw there, or was Tom so unaccustomed to someone waiting for him?</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Prove your gratitude by being attentive and half as clever as Professor Dumbledore made you out to be. And I hope that you thanked him, too,” Filius added after a moment’s thought. There were rules for allowing a wizard to spend the summer holidays in apprenticeship rather than at home but they required a guardian’s permission. Dumbledore must have argued quite thoroughly in Tom’s favor, when the boy had only caretakers at the orphanage and (under a strict interpretation of Hogwarts’ rules) no guardian per se. “Now, if you’ll let me take care of those bags, we can get going.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Something glinted in Tom’s eyes. “I don’t know what Dumbledore told you but I’m not a charity case, sir. I can handle myself and carry my own bags.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Quite right, Mr. Riddle, and there will be plenty of work later on, don’t worry about that. For now, though, you’ll find that those bags needn’t be any trouble for either of us,” Filius said, and he swished his wand a few times, first to make sure that he’d guessed the enchantments correctly--Filius was sure he’d recognized the brand, but it never hurt to confirm--and then to levitate the bags and fix their relative position to Tom’s.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“How did you do that?” Tom asked, crouching in order to get the suitcases at eye level. “They have Extension Charms on them. I thought that didn’t combine well with any kind of levitation.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“It isn’t impossible, just very difficult,” Filius replied. “For someone of my size, however, it is an indispensible trick. Now, come on, Tom. Let’s get back home and get ourselves settled in.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>One did not ordinarily choose to travel on the Knight Bus. Rather, it was forced, when apparition, floo, and every other other means of magical travel were either unavailable, and that in turn implied inability or a mugglish destination. In this case, however, they took the Knight Bus down to his flat so that Filius could have an opportunity to personally observe Tom in the midst of chaos. The boy was quiet and observant, with the sort of air that suggested he was keeping an eye out for threats and escape routes. Dumbledore probably thought the boy was paranoid but on the Knight Bus, at least, it was always a good idea to be on the lookout for falling objects if nothing else.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“You’ve never taken the Knight Bus before, have you?” he asked. The seats were cushioned but not quite comfortable, with the springs old and losing their bounce as they were. It was an unpleasant feeling, and for more than the immediately obvious reasons. The Knight Bus had changed from when Filius had used it as a boy, in the way that things change when they’re kept in place, never switched out and never fixed up, until they’re ratty, old, and stained by substances that Filius cared not a whit to think about.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I’m sorry, what!?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I <em>said</em>,” and Filius repeated his question, shouting this time so that Tom could hear him over the clamor. That, at least, was no different from his childhood. The company, too, was much the same: muggleborns and half-bloods, still with one foot in the muggle world and obvious to Filius by their queer mode of dress; a pair of hags snacking on fried sweetbreads from a brown bag shared between them; and some threadbare tramp whom Filius strongly suspected was a vampire.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I haven’t had the pleasure, no!” Tom replied, and then the next bump hit with such force that Filius was sent at least two feet up in the air. They went the rest of the journey without further mishaps, at least by the standards of the Knight Bus, and besides very sore bottoms they exited none the worse for wear.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>His home was a Georgian-era terraced house, like so many Wizarding estates in London, but it hadn’t been home to anyone of repute for at least a hundred years, if it had ever been. It was prone to drafts, but the really aggravating thing about it was the strange blue mold that grew along the walls on the second floor. Filius was quite sure that it was the product of some previous resident’s magical experiments, because not even his best charmwork had been able to put a permanent end to the stuff, but at least it would be serving a purpose today.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Filius let the boy have a couple minutes to examine the blue-stained walls. “I trust that you’re familiar with both varieties of the Scouring Charm,” he said, and he summoned a few rags from another floor. “I don’t want to infuriate you without reason, so I’ll let you know from the beginning that this is going to be useful to your education, but I want you to use them on this wall.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Them,” Tom said. “You mean both kinds?” he asked, and Filius nodded.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“That’s right. Alternate between them as you work, and pay close attention to what you feel about them as you do so.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tom gave him a long look, perhaps evaluating whether Filius was telling the truth or merely making him a house-elf on a lark, then got to work. Filius reattached the charm on Tom’s luggage, adjusting it so that they would follow him instead. He brought the bags up to a third floor room where the boy would be sleeping, and conjured up a pile of quilts and a hammock to string up if Tom so wished, and to use as a sleeping mat if not. This done, Filius returned to the ground floor to to prepare supper for the both of them. There were certain duties which one could require of an apprentice, but Filius preferred his own cooking.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He used two pots, for, while Filius fully intended to broaden Tom’s horizons at some point, there was no cause to frighten him off just yet with exotic recipes. In the larger pot he prepared a batch of perfectly ordinary chicken soup (they still served liver at Hogwarts, didn’t they?), then poured a bit of it into the smaller pot, to which he added half a pound of doodlebugs, sans wings and legs, which he had previously sizzled in butter.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was about an hour after his departure when Filius was able to return, trailed by a floating assortment of pots, bowls, and utensils, and one large loaf of bread. “That should do it for today,” Filius said, and he clapped his hands together. Beside him, a charmed knife set itself to carving off slices of bread, two of which placed themselves on the plates that settled in front of himself and Tom. “I am interested in what you noticed.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“They’re not the same spell,” Tom said, as a spoon levitated into his hand and his bowl filled with chicken soup. “They’re both called the Scouring Charm, but...the wand movements are a little different. I had never noticed that before.” He took his first sip, and smiled. “Thank you for supper. This is better than anything I’ve had at Wool’s Orphanage.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“But not Hogwarts?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“We both know that would be a lie.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Filius smiled. “You’re correct that they’re different spells. One vanishes dirt and grime and the other makes suds. It’s something that most wizards take for granted. You probably would have learned about this for your O.W.L.s, but they’re examples of what’s called a spell variant--or a variante de sort in French, if you want to impress someone with your knowledge of formal dueling terminology. Are you following me?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tom nodded, obviously drinking up Filius’ lesson along with the soup.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Bright lad,” Filius said, then continued. “As you noticed, the wandwork for each is slightly different and, of course, there’s a different ‘visualization’ in each case. They’re close, however, which shows the potential behind modifying spells. I believe that you demonstrated an example of that yourself, last year.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Yes,” Tom said, faltering. “But I--”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Filius smiled and rolled his eyes. “I’m not your professor. If I’m going to tell you off for cursing your peers’ fingers off, it’s because they’re so far below your level that it just isn’t sporting. That kind of instinct will serve you well on the dueling strip. You just need to channel it properly. Now tell me how you did it,” he said, not bothering to hide his eagerness.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“The finger-removing hex is supposed to shock, not debilitate, so there are actually some safeguards built into the spell,” Tom replied. “After I figured out where the dependencies were, I experimented with destabilizing them, first on spiders and then, once I was sure it would be safe, on myself.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Filius raised an eyebrow. “No other human subjects? Truly?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tom shrugged, in what might have been genuine nonchalance. “I wanted to be prepared for the sensation in case someone ever used it on me, and, conversely, for nobody else to be prepared even for the idea. Three can keep a secret when two of them are dead, but Hogwarts frowns on that sort of thing.” He smiled, and Filius felt the relief of a tiny bit of tension whose presence he hadn’t noticed the arrival of.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Destabilizing the spell could have had any number of effects--and likely did, till you perfected it. What was your thinking and work process?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Well, the wandwork, incantation, and so forth had seven points of interaction, as with most hexes--or most European hexes,” Tom corrected himself. “Figuring out how and where this movement interacted with that syllable was more tedious than it was difficult, though somebody who was more accomplished probably would have been able to expend less ink and parchment. The first locus that I removed just caused the spell to fizzle on the end of my wand, and the second resulted in a nasty bit of backfire that I had to go to the Hospital Wing for, but then I just had to figure out how to rebalance the spell around that void which I had introduced and create a new locus of interactions. The hard part about it really had less to do with the spell than with myself: I wanted the spell to look and sound normal to an observer, which meant that a bulk of the spell’s weight was going to be carried in my mind, like a non-verbal casting, except that I also knew the original version by heart and I had to be able to perfectly envision the modified structure when I was so familiar with the first, like training myself to think of a white elephant in response to hearing of a pink one.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Filius considered what Tom had told him. “Figurative pound for figurative pound, a magical focus does more to guide your magic than an incantation does, which is why non-verbal magic is simpler and a tricky bit of transfiguration will usually be given additional wand movements rather than extra syllables. All of your modifications had to remain out of sight, however, which meant that you had to carry it in your mind.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“You’re saying that it was somewhat like wandless magic?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Somewhat,” Filius agreed. “This sort of practice is closer to what some duelists called ‘duplicitous casting,’ and your ability to, what was it, think of white elephants when someone mentioned pink, suggests a talent for occlumency, which cares more about how you think than how you cast. It is, though, also a little bit like having shaved one wand movement off from a complete set of movements. Now, I have dabbled in spell variants myself. Watch carefully,” Filius said, and he cast his spell against an empty bowl, in which a small pile of white powder appeared. “This is an adjustment to the Scouring Charm’s second variant. The soap which the standard version produces is just that, and was never anything but, and yet it’s possible to ‘undo’ the process of saponification and generate pure lye.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I see.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“An easy way to improve the efficacy of a shield is to specialize it, improving it against some kinds of spells but leaving an opening against others. There are counter-spells, like<em> finite incantatum</em>, but then there are untransfigurations, anti-jinxes, and spells yet more specialized than that which are more effective when used appropriately,” Filius explained. “For example, the Scouring Charm, and charms of that class, are typically not worth defending against, but lye is very alkaline. Its other name is caustic soda. Now imagine the soap that one of your teachers might have spelled into your mouth after you said a bad word, but with lye instead.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I see,” Tom said, and his voice was full of a wonder that wasn’t there before. “Then could you…” His voice quieted abruptly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I can tell that you’re thinking of something. Out with it,” Filius said kindly. “I won’t judge you.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tom still needed a moment before he was willing to say it. “I was going to say, you could conjure that into someone’s lungs, sir.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Filius smiled. “You have a very direct way of thinking, Tom. Practicing with you should be interesting. But unfortunately, you can’t get most spells to take effect inside someone’s body, not first without taking into account the basic difficulty involved. Spells which can target the organs are typically designed specifically to do so and, if you laid out the mechanics of one, the written expression of that spell would look quite different from another spell with the same effect but no such capability. In other words, if you were able to <em>scourgify </em>lye into someone’s lungs, you might well be casting a spell variant that’s more distinct from mine than mine is from the standard pair.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Tom nodded, and Filius’ smile grew larger. He could see in his mind’s eye already. The boy was going to be an incredible duelist. Last year, living in the frame of mind of a contender rather than a teacher, Filius might have been jealous or worried that he might be outclassed, but Tom was his and petty concerns like that didn’t matter. They’d speak the name "Tom Riddle" in hushed whispers for decades to come, and in everyone’s mind would be the thought, <em>Filius Flitwick was the one who trained him.</em></p>
