    <span>“Dear Ginny,</span>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p><span>I thought you should know, expect your brother home soon, and tell him he isn’t welcome to come near me ever</span> <span>again, he betrayed my trust for the final time...”</span></p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry stopped what he was writing and put down his quill. Rubbing his temple, he looked over Hermione, sleeping. She had a trail of dried tears running down her face.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“You know you don’t have to stare at me. I’m fine” Hermione muttered, her eyes still closed. “Ron’s just a prat and I’m glad he’s gone”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Hermione” Harry said, concern lacing his voice.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Harry” she mimicked back, sitting up on the cot.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry rolled his eyes.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“What are you writing?” She asked, seeing the quill and parchment on the table.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p><span>“... There’s more to this letter than that. I wish I</span> <span>knew exactly what to say. I wish even more that I could tell you this in person. I hope you understand...”</span></p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I’m writing at letter to Ginny.” Harry said, looking back at the letter.  He definitely could feel a headache starting. Since when did everything get so complicated?</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Oh, I didn’t realize it was safe to send letters now.” Hermione said, her smile fell for a split second. Too fast for Harry to even notice with his attention on the letter in front of him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“It’s important.” Harry said, not even looking up.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Of course she is,” Hermione muttered with a small sigh, “I’m making breakfast, would you like some?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry nodded to her, smiling. He grimaced when he looked at the letter.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p><span>I wonder what that face is for?</span> Hermione thought to herself as she went to the ‘kitchen’ part of the tent.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“How’d you sleep last night?” Harry asked, “I know you put up a silencing charm”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Good,” Hermione said sharply.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Liar,” Harry countered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Harry,” Hermione said warningly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Hermione,” Harry mimicked back. She rolled her eyes, unable to be truly mad with him. “But really, how are you?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I’m...” she paused, seemingly lost in thought. <span>Embarrassed? Because Ron left in such a Ron way. Sad? Because she’s finally realized what her mother has been trying to tell her. “</span>Actually good, or at least I will be”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Good because from now on, it’s just you and I. No more prat. This was the final straw.” Harry said with such conviction that Hermione smiled. “We never needed him anyways, you’re the brain and I’m brawn”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>For the first time in days, Hermione let out a real laugh.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“So...” Hermione said, putting a plate of food on the table in front of Harry as she sat down with her own. She nodded towards the letter, “What’s so important?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry frowned, looking again at the letter.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I’m letting her know that The Prat will arrive home and...” Harry trailed off, unsure. As if saying it aloud will make it true.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“And?” Hermione questioned, raising her eyebrow.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“It’s complicated,” he sighed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Oh,” Hermione nodded towards her best friend.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Yeah,” Harry said between bites. Finishing his plate, he took it to the sink.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He turned back around quickly, staring intently at Hermione. She blushed a little under his scrutiny.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“What?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I’m just going to say it,” he said quickly, with a sigh.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Is everything alright?” Hermione asked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I’m breaking up with her,” Harry said, “well, more like permanently ending things.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“What,” Hermione managed to squeak out, her heart pounding. Harry sat back down, again picking up the quill to finish the letter. “Why would you do that?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p><span>“... A lot has changed in these last few months.</span> <span>As much as I don’t want to hurt you, I feel you deserve the truth. It’s not that I don’t love you anymore, I’ve just realized that I don’t love you in the way. It’s been a long and confusing couple months but I’ve realized I’m in love with Hermione.</span></p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>
    <span>Harry”</span>
  </p>
