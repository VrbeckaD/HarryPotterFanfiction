"I'll find that thief if it's the last thing I ever do."</p><p>Nagini muttered, "No point, it's long gone."</p><p>Salazar glanced down at his hands and asked, "Does this mean we have to face the prospect of death, Gini?"</p><p>Nagini nodded and said, "At least we'll be facing it together."</p></div>
