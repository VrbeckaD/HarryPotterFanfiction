  <b>Chapter 1 Tough Job</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus Snape pulled on his Death Eater robes in both haste and disgust. He had warned Albus about what would transpire this afternoon and still the old lune had done nothing to change it. The old man knew the Death Eaters planned to attack Hogsmeade on the day of the Hogwarts Orientation trip for first year students. The bumbling twat knew their lives would be at risk -- yet he let it happen. It had been so predictable, such an easy target for his dark brothers that it boggled Severus’ mind as to why the Order had not identified this as a high probability target. The trip happened every year on July 25th before school would start. The 7th year Prefects and Head Boy/ Head Girl would lead and the younger first years around Hogwarts and then take half the day to see Hogsmeade. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a students only affair. There would be no teachers. They would be exposed -- lambs to the proverbial slaughter. And there would be slaughter, of that there was no doubt in Severus’ mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When it came to death in particular, Severus was generally disposed to indifference. Years of working as a double agent had stolen any sort of remorse, regret, guilt or disgust when it came to death and killing from him. He had been hardened, his soul blackened, his mask of indifference shielding him from emotional pain – it had kept him alive all these years. The last nine months he had taken a "sabbatical" from teaching at Hogwarts, officially for some continuing education in Potions in Romania. Unofficially he had been called to do Voldemort's bidding in the south of Scotland. That included death, torture, the general destruction of lives, people, innocence --and yet this particular attack that Voldemort was planning for today weighed heavily on him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hogwarts and the surrounding area had been his home, his sanctuary from an abusive family life. In many respects it still was  a refuge, which meant that any attack on it was personal and close to home. Too close. Severus had and would do almost anything for the Dark Lord – he had committed many unforgivable sins in his name, but this attack on the students tore through his thick armor and hit him right in his soul.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Putting on his silver Death Eater’s mask, Severus took a deep breath. He was damned if something happened to a Hogwarts student – all in the Order would deem it his fault for not preparing them properly. There would again be questions about his loyalties, giving rise to more squabbling about his power and role within the Order. Of course he was also damned if he didn't go through with it – the Dark Lord would consider it a weakness and something to be exploited. It could uncover him as a double agent and traitor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This conundrum brought Severus back to the very day he swore allegiance to the Order, now very many years ago. Albus had warned him of this job, told of the dangers there would be and the strength it would require to handle it. “A high degree of mental toughness.” The old wizard had said perhaps not truly knowing what was instore for Severus. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘But how could he have really known the sins I would commit for the Order?’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>Severus asked himself, knowing he would never know the answer. ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>A high degree of mental toughness for the shittiest, most dangerous, thankless job in the Order.’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>He shook his head knowing the last part had been conveniently left out. No one could ever know the depths of his loneliness and nobody on the glorious side of light really cared either.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But there was another thing that troubled Severus this day. It was a decree by the Dark Lord. The message had been crystal clear. All those of his inner circle were to find wives by the end of September. There were no excuses, even for a long term bachelor like him. The creature was already thinking about a second and third generation of Death Eaters, which made Severus groan in disgust. By the second week of school he would not only have to have all of his lesson plans in order, placate both of his masters, find some time to decompress but also have a good lead on a bride. He spat at the thought of what that meant. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus had an effect on women, that was not unknown to him. Yet finding somebody he could  stand for any length of time -- particularly the rest of his life -- would be impossible no matter the time frame. Of course he had told Albus about this predicament, hoping the leader of the light would have some kind of ‘feel good solution’ to the whole thing. Severus could only seeth at the very memory of standing there in front of him, having all but pleaded they find a reasonable answer and watching the old man’s damn eyes twinkle back at him. With this air of knowing something Severus didn’t, but not wanting to tell him all the same. It was beyond infuriating -- especially because he was running out of time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was with that image of the old wizard that Severus appariated for Hogsmeade-- bewilderment and despair his only companions.</span>
