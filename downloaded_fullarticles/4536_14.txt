    <p>
  <span>Sherlock Holmes crouched quietly on a large rock in his backyard, head bent low with his chin resting on his knees, looking down into a shallow pond at the small tadpoles swimming between the reeds.  Sherlock pushed his dark curls out of his eyes and unscrewed the lid from his glass specimen jar, setting it down sideways into the water and waiting patiently for a tadpole to swim inside.  He watched with baited breath as a tadpole swam near the opening of the jar, its fins waving rhythmically against the unseen current, then suddenly darted inside just as a scowl appeared on Sherlocks’ face.  As he lifted the jar from the surface of the water, a gleeful smile instantly replaced the annoyed expression.  His hands were sure and his lips still pulled back in a grin as he screwed the lid onto the jar, his blue eyes bright and curious as he held his specimen up to his eye level. </span>
</p>
<p>It was there, sitting crouched on his feet by the pond, looking into a small glass jar with complete focus, as if the universe itself resided in the waving fins of a green tadpole, that Mycroft Holmes found his eight year old brother.</p>
<p>
  <span>“What did you find, Sherlock?”  Mycroft asked, striding up to the pond.  Mycroft Holmes noted the dirt on the seat of his little brothers’ dark red shorts from where he’d been sitting on the damp rocks around the pond.  Sherlock’s blue long-sleeve button up had the sleeves rolled back almost to the elbows, and Mycroft couldn’t help but notice the dirt on his brother’s elbows and on the palms of his hands.</span>
</p>
<p>“I didn’t find it,” Sherlock answered, smile gone as he continued to study the tadpole, turning the glass around slowly. “I captured it for science, my observations will lead to a greater understanding of amphibian life as we know it. Run along now, Mycroft, I have important matters to attend to.”</p>
<p>Mycroft chuckled at his little brothers’ serious tone, shuffling his feet and coughing to hide the sound. Unfortunately, like almost always, nothing was lost on Sherlock; and his eyes were wrenched from his jar to look at his brother with anger and hurt in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t be so sensitive, Sherlock. I wasn’t laughing at you, just your odd ways. And I laugh at those with love.” Mycroft gave him a tight smile, which <em>was</em> lost as Sherlock chose that moment to roll his eyes, and continued; “I’m going over to the Lestrade's’ for the afternoon, do you want to come? We’re going to play quidditch.”</p>
<p>Sherlock stood, pulling the specimen jar into the crook of his elbow and holding his head up high. “Not today, thank you, Mycroft. Tell your boyfriend hello for me and to stop sending owls at all hours of the night. Good morning, Brother.”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Sherlock. See you tonight.” Mycroft turned halfway, looking towards Sherlock’s retreating back before adjusting his umbrella and book and returning to the path that led out of his family’s estate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mummy, I can’t find my looking glass!” Sherlock shouted, shifting his biology book aside, opening drawers in a mad frenzy.</p>
<p>“Did you leave it in your bed, dear?” Mrs. Holmes’ voice floated up the stairs. Sherlock turned and pulled his blankets back, revealing a book, a torch, a small dish of a moss sample, and his magnifying glass. Sherlock nodded his head, silently berating himself for forgetting.  He’d spend half the night looking at the moss’ roots, or lack thereof, until he’d finally understood the plant and his mind had stopped racing enough for him to fall asleep.</p>
<p>“Found it!” He called, returning to his desk and tadpole.</p>
<p>Sherlock had just begun drawing the tadpoles’ stumpy, still-forming legs when his mother knocked lightly on the door frame. “Might I see what you’re working on, dear?” She asked, full well knowing he’d be pleased to show off his work.</p>
<p>“Certainly, Mummy. But my drawing isn’t complete just yet.” Sherlock said, not turning or halting in his careful drawing. Mrs. Holmes moved quietly to stand behind her son, looking over his shoulder at a detailed drawing of the front end of a tadpole.</p>
<p>“Your drawing skills are improving, Sherlock, that looks wonderful.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mummy.” Sherlock said, dipping his quill in a bottle of black ink and adjusting his grip on his looking glass.</p>
<p>
  <span>After a moment of silence broken only by the scratching of Sherlock’s quill, Mrs. Holmes said, “Sherlock, I need a favor of you when you’re done with your inquiry, please.  If you help me, I’ll let you use a wand.”</span>
</p>
<p>Sherlock sat up straight in his chair, turning towards his mother and looking into her eyes for any indication that she might be lying. There was none, and a huge grin spread over Sherlock’s face.  He wasn’t suppose to have a wand, he was too young to use magic, but sometimes Mummy let him anyway, since the trace wasn’t activated until a child attended school. “I’m not busy, what do you need?”</p>
<p>His mother smiled in return. “Come with me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Just tap it lightly, Sherlock, speak clearly.” His mother released his wrist, and Sherlock tapped the crystal with his late uncle’s wand.</p>
<p>“Crystarium.” Sherlock said softly, and when there was no response, he straightened his back and tilted his head in an annoyed way.</p>
<p>“Don’t fret, dear, try again.”</p>
<p>Sherlock set his jaw, held his wand properly, and tapped the crystal again. “Crystarium.” Sherlock said it was all the authority he could muster, and this time, the crystal glowed slightly. A smile spread across Sherlock’s face and a delighted gasp escaped him.</p>
<p>“Good job, Sherlock!” His mother said, hugging his shoulders. “Now go out and find as many as you can for Mummy.”</p>
<p>Sherlock took the velvet bag from his mother, let her kiss his dark curls, and ran from the house like a madman, wand held at the ready as he set out on his latest case.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As far as cases go, usually the ones Sherlock’s mother give him are more interesting.  He’d been walking around his family’s estate and surrounding countryside, hunched over and picking up rocks for the past three hours.  The velvet bag his mother had given him was about three quarters of the way full.  In the past half hour he’d discovered that there were more crystals to be found around outcroppings of rock, so he’d been focusing more on those areas and his collection had grown pleasantly since then. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sherlock plucked a large, clear stone from the ground, hoping it was the type he’d been looking for.  “Crystarium.”  He said softly, and the glowing response made him sigh with relief.  The large stone filled the velvet bag, thus bringing his case to a close.  He struggled to draw the strings over the top of the rock, and stowed his borrowed wand in his pocket with his magnifying glass as he raced up the hill towards his home.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His mother had praised him, of course, for his cleverness. She’d given him lunch and promised to give him extra sweets after dinner (more than Mycroft, he’d made her promise on that) and Sherlock was even going to be allowed to watch Mummy work.</p>
<p>
  <span>Mrs. Holmes was a clever witch, she was currently working on a new potion to help a werewolf control his transformation.  Wolfsbane had been discovered years earlier, but she thought it could be possible for a werewolf to transform outside of the full moon time limit.  She was a dabbler in dark magic, but of course she didn’t use it for amoral purposes, simply for a better understanding of it all.  Sherlock adored her, as she adored him.  She adored Mycroft as well; as smart, charming, and diabolical as he was.  But Mycroft was more like his father, and Sherlock, more like his mother.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It never came as a shock to Mr. Holmes that his wife let their eight year old use magic on a regular basis; both of Sherlocks’ parents knew how he loved to use a wand, and how it was all the more appealing to him because he wasn’t suppose to, and because he thought his father didn’t know.  But it </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> a shock when he came home from the Ministry of Magic to find his young son in the potions room with his wife performing an experiment that could be dangerous.  He wasn’t exactly thrilled with his wife for putting herself in danger, much less little Sherlock.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Stand by the door, don’t cross the threshold and that’s as close as you’ll be, young man.”  Mr. Holmes had said as soon as he’d heard their explanation.  Sherlock had grumbled, but relented after his father threatened to send him out to the Lestrade’s for Mycroft to babysit him.  In the end, Sherlock occupied the hallway, seated on a stool across the hall from an open door where his parents’ were assisting one another in brewing a foul-smelling potion.  Sherlock had just asked his father what boomslang skin would do for the potion when suddenly, the whole room was ripped apart by an explosion.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mycroft was seated on the Lestrade’s back porch with Gregory Lestrade, the only son of the household, talking about their last year at Hogwarts.  The school year had ended three weeks previously; Greg had just returned from holiday with his parents the day before, and was filling his best friend in on all he’d seen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And the markets, Mycroft, you wouldn’t believe them, they stretched for blocks!  Whole streets of wizarding merchandise set out in the open for anyone to see!  There was one man, scary looking guy, selling dragons!”  Greg was sitting in the chair across a small table from Mycroft, an untouched sandwich in front of him, arms held high as he gestured wildly and told his stories.  Mycroft had been listening intently, though his sandwich was finished and his cup of tea drained several times over during Greg’s long tale.</span>
</p>
<p>“Did you buy one?” Mycroft asked, watching his friend’s shoulders slump and his arms fall into his lap suddenly.</p>
<p>“No, Dad wouldn’t let me, said it wasn’t a proper pet.” Greg picked up his sandwich and took a bite, chewing quickly. “So what have you been doing these past few weeks? Have you had enough of Sherlock yet?”</p>
<p>
  <span>Mycroft rolled his eyes.  Greg knew how trying Sherlock could be at the best of times, and how irritating he was the rest of the time.  “Oh, I’ve just been getting summer reading and homework done-Yes, I’m finished with all of it.”  Mycroft said as he guessed the question Greg was about to ask.  “And Sherlock is about the same as ever.  Father won’t let me teach him anything I’ve learned at school so he steals my school books when I’m sleeping or otherwise occupied.”  Greg laughed fondly at that, and Mycroft smiled, his love for his little brother more than made up for his social ineptness or his recent string of theft.</span>
</p>
<p>And it was with that feeling in his heart that Mycroft Holmes looked out across the rolling hills towards his home, and saw a column of smoke rising from where his family’s estate should lay behind the trees.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Get your father, Greg!”  Mycroft cried, drawing his wand as he stood and turned on the spot, stumbling out of the apparate and feeling sick, both from the gut-wrenching magic and the site before him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was standing on the front lawn of his home, and it was that which he’d seen burning from over two kilometers away.  His family’s home was burning with thick, green-tinted flames, smoke poured from the top of the house, and he knew there was nothing he could do to save his childhood home.  There was no magic in his education thus far that had prepared him to be able to put out a magical fire of this magnitude.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sherlock!”  He screamed, coughing from the exertion on his vocal cords.  “Sherlock, where are you?”  He looked around him, near the pond, down the road, up the hill to the tree where his brother had taken to reading, but Sherlock was nowhere in the front of the house.  Realization dawned on Mycroft in an instant.  Sherlock was inside, with their mother.  In the burning house.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Turning his wand on himself, Mycroft cast a bubble-head charm to protect him from the toxic fumes, then the flame-freezing charm to protect him from the heat.  Mycroft shouted a muffled “Bombarda!” as he charged up the steps, blasting the front door open and ran into the fire.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mycroft raced down the hall, shouting Sherlocks’ name over and over.  There was no answer, there was only the loud roar of the flames in his ears and the sight of fire all around him.  It was only chance, Mycroft would later decide, that he found Sherlock in time.  The young boy had been thrown aside in the initial explosion and had crawled down one hallway and into the hall that lead to the front door before he lost consciousness.  It was there that the boy lied, face down, completely still.  Mycroft ran forward, casting the same protective spells on his brother that he had on himself, lifted Sherlock off the floor and into his arms, and ran out of the house as the walls began falling down around them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mycroft jumped from the front porch just as the roof began to crumble.  He almost collapsed from Sherlock’s weight as he landed on the ground outside, but was caught in the strong arms of Greg’s father.  Mr. Lestrade led Mycroft away from the burning house and lifted Sherlock from Mycroft’s shaking limbs. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tears filled Mycroft’s eyes when he beheld his brother.  Any flames that had been burning the boy had been put out when Mycroft had cast the flame-freezing charm, but Sherlock’s little body was still a bloody mess. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The roaring in Mycroft’s ears intensified suddenly, and he looked back, one hand still holding his brother’s forearm, towards his home.  Witches and Wizards surrounded the house, every single qualified magic user in the area were using their wands to calm the flames that had grown ever higher. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mycroft felt the tingling sensation fade from his extremities and focused on not letting the spell he’d placed on Sherlock fade as well.  As the roof caved, he could feel the heat evaporating the tears from his cheeks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sherlock’s arm was wrenched out of his grasp, and when Mycroft turned, Sherlock was sitting up, fighting his way out of Mr. Lestrade’s grasp, trying to get to the house.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sherlock!”  Mycroft exclaimed, surprised and worried.  Sherlock took a determined step towards the house, pulling Mr. Lestrade with him.  “Sherlock, stop!”  Mycroft put himself between his brother and his destination.  He put his hand back on his brother’s arm, where he still had some intact skin, and said, “Sherlock, they’re gone.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes.”  Sherlock said dreamily, and with that, he into a heap on the grass.</span>
</p>
