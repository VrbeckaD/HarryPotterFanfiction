    <p>The Master of Death: Survival </p><p>Chapter One- The Prison</p><p>Harrison sat in his favorite chair his back was killing him he was going to murder his mates if the babies didn't arrive soon. Two-year-old Cleo was watching Sophia the first even though she had watched the entire series that they had collected already. Harrison had put her curly black hair into two puffballs sitting on the side of her head. Harrison looked up when 13-year-old Carl walked in. Carl said ''There's an alarm coming from the prison daddy'' Harrison stood up as best he could and Carl snickered.</p><p>Harrison frowned at his oldest the 18-year-old said ''You just wait until these twins are out I'm going to chase you down and tackle you.''</p><p>Carl grinned and helped him stand and Harrison sighed in relief ''Thank you Carl''</p><p>Carl grinned ''No problem daddy.'' Carl was almost as tall as Harrison was Harrison mumbled ''You need a haircut''</p><p>Carl groaned ''No way Daddy I want to grow it out''</p><p>Harrison ran his fingers through it and said ''You can grow it out but I don't want it to be too long I would rather not have a walker grip your hair while you're on scouting mission's''</p><p>Carl nodded ''Fine you can cut it to the top of my neck'' Harrison nodded it was to his shoulder's so that was a good compromise. Carl walked outside and listened to the children play they haven't found any children Cleo's age but they did find some around Carl's age and a bit older.</p><p>Cole and Sasha were teaching gun training to the newbie's they had found a group of six who needed to be trained. Caleb and Tyreese were teaching defense with knives and swords and just plain fighting to the younger teen's. It was a shock when Cole and Sasha had started dating so they weren't surprised when Caleb and Tyreese told them about their relationship also. Merle was the biggest shock when he and Michonne started to bump uglies as he would put it Daryl almost had a heart attack. He would have never thought Merle Dixon would date someone of another race.</p><p>Cole paused the training and ran over to his baby brother and asked ''Now where are you going?''</p><p>Harrison said ''I'm going to find Daryl and Glenn''</p><p>Cole said ''I'll pick you up then''</p><p>Harrison groaned ''Cole I'm fine Papa told me to walk around.''</p><p>Cole sighed and said ''Yes mam'' Harrison huffed at his brother Cole dodged the punch and he laughed and ran back to his girlfriend.</p><p>Daryl was looking through the binoculars they were outside the wards at the prison hearing the alarms echoing Glenn said ''That's going to bring more walkers to the area we need to stop it the wards will protect our land but we don't need walker's waiting for us when we go out.''</p><p>Michonne asked ''Do you need us to go with you?''</p><p>Daryl answered ''Naw we will go'' Michonne nodded and looked and saw Harrison waddling over. That drew the attention of Daryl and Glenn and Glenn ran over Glenn opened his mouth and Harrison placed his hand over Glenn's mouth.</p><p>''Don't you even say anything I'm fine what's with everyone today walkers ignore me anyway I'm not in any danger'' he placed his hands on the top of his stomach and sighed softly.</p><p>Daryl grunted ''You should be resting your 6 months pregnant.''</p><p>Harrison groaned ''Fine I'll go back home then'' he turned around and Michonne took his arm and interlocked it with her own.</p><p>Carl said ''Can I go with papa and father?''</p><p>Harrison looked at him and said ''Be careful ok''</p><p>Carl said ''Yes Daddy'' Harrison nodded and kissed Glenn and Daryl on the lips and Daryl placed his hand on the top of his stomach and felt a kick.</p><p>Harrison laughed softly and said ''One is kicking softly that has to be Daryl's and the other is bouncing on my bladder like a trampoline'' he looked at Glenn with a frown. Glenn rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. Daryl smirked ''Mine is the good baby.''</p><p>Harrison giggled softly and said ''I need to pee so I'm going to go back to the house now I think I have walked enough today'' he waddled back to Michonne who had killed too walker's and was now shaking off her sword. Harrison said ''Incendio'' the two bodies went up in flames. Michonne helped the pregnant male back to the safety of the wards.</p><p>Daryl Glenn and Carl ran to the outer gates and saw Hershel and Beth surrounded by walker's in a cage type thing. Daryl said ''Ok Carl you find a way inside Glenn and I will kill the walker's heading towards the prison you need to be quick Carl.'' Carl nodded putting his hand on his sword to make sure it was there. Harrison had told him it was called the sword of Gryffindor when it had appeared in front of Carl one day ever since then the sword had never left Carl always appearing whenever Carl needed it.</p><p>He dodged walker's and he heard Daryl's arrows hitting the walker's in the head when he ran past one. He ran the length of the fence line and saw a opening that had orange wire keeping it closed. He cut it open again and yelled ''I found an opening!'' Daryl and Glenn ran towards the opening and ducked under and closed it again. They used bolt cutters to open the main gate and ran across the yard to the inner prison. Rick was killing walker's.</p><p>He stopped for a second he gasped ''Carl'' Carl looked at his father and said ''Hey Dad'' Rick smiled and shot a walker while Carl stabbed another in the head. He set Hershel and Beth free.</p><p>He asked ''Lori?''</p><p>Hershel said ''She was with Maggie they were forced into the tombs''</p><p>Rick looked at Daryl and Glenn. Glenn said ''I'll stay with them'' Daryl nodded and followed Rick.</p><p>Rick asked ''So Harrison''</p><p>Daryl said ''He's fine we found a place to hold up in.''</p><p>Rick said ''That's good why are you here?''</p><p>Carl answered ''We heard the alarms and we came to help out'' Rick nodded at and looked at his son while running he looked healthy and happy. He wanted to be with his son maybe he could talk Daryl into staying with them in the prison. Now he needed to find his wife and then his family could be complete again.</p>
