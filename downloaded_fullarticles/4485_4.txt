          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Harry, what are you doing? I told you I don’t have time for this!”</p>
<p>“You have two hours before you have to go! That’s more than enough time!”</p>
<p>“Stop that! You know I’ll have to take a nap before I go if we do this. There just isn’t time!”</p>
<p>“A NAP?! Oh, please, Sev! You’re not THAT old!”</p>
<p>“I’m twice your age, that’s old enough. Besides, you move so slow, it puts me to sleep every time!”</p>
<p>“I do not!”</p>
<p>“You do so!”</p>
<p>*Snarl* “Well, Ron’s been helping me, so I’m getting much better!”</p>
<p>*Sigh* “I really wish you wouldn’t play with Mr. Weasley. He’s teaching you all the wrong moves.”</p>
<p>“He is not! He’s very good at it. Hermione certainly doesn’t complain.”</p>
<p>“That’s because she stopped playing with him after they conceived their third child!”</p>
<p>“She still plays with him… Just not as much as Ron would like.”</p>
<p>“There’s just no way you can finish in only 2 hours. Why don’t you go play with the werewolf?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to play with Remus, I want to play with YOU, Severus! I promise to make it worth your while!”</p>
<p>“Harry, I’m not playing chess with you and that’s final!”</p></div>
