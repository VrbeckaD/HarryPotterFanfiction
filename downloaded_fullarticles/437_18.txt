    <p>Harry Potter had a… difficult life, to say the least. His parents had been betrayed by their friend, murdered in their own home and left him an orphan but not just any orphan ‘the boy who lived’. What a joke ‘The boy who lived’ had been abandoned to die by those who should have wanted to protect him most. The so-called Lord of Light left a baby in the hands of magic hating muggles and turned a blind eye to his abuse, or perhaps he didn’t know and wasn’t as all-knowing as people believed.</p><p>Not like it mattered now anyway. The war was over and Voldemort was dead but so were too many others Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus, Severus even Fred were all dead. An untold number of Teachers, Students, Order Members, Wizards, Muggles, Death Eaters, and Magical Creatures had perished in the war. As a result, there were few who truly felt like celebrating the completion of the war.</p><p>Harry was left with the worst fate of all, isolation. He had suffered so much in his life only asking for one thing in return and every time it was taken from him. He just wanted a family was that too much to ask for. Someone to love him and tell him everything would be okay no matter what. But no Harry was a ‘hero’ and ‘the saviour’ he was no longer just a person, not that he ever was, he was never just ‘Harry’ no matter what he did. That might be what caused him to hate his name so much, but if he couldn’t be ‘Harry’ why not be someone else and leave that cursed name behind him, choosing to go by Harrison instead.</p><p>Those around him began to drift away, too busy with their own problems to even notice him as anything more than his titles. Ron was trying to become an Auror and Hermione was busy continuing and going further with her schooling. Ginny went back to school and they lost contact, not that Harrison minded he never really felt right with her.</p><p>He was finding that he only felt anything close to love when he had been with Severus, but he realized too little too late, Snape was dead and buried before he knew it. Lucius Malfoy had been the only other to catch his eye, but he was married and made his distaste for him very clear ‘no point crying over spilt milk’ as they say.</p><p>Harrison began to avoid people or had they started avoiding him first, who knows at this point. All Harrison knew was those that didn’t adore him or hate him for one reason or the other began telling stories of how he’ll become the next Dark Lord, how he’s changed and no longer the hero of light but the next bringer of darkness.</p><p>He had tried to find somewhere to live in peace, but it wasn’t easy. The Dursleys made their opinion of him clear and wouldn’t even be his last choice to go to. The Wesleys had once been a family to him but with Fred's death, the break-up with Ginny and Ron’s general lack of interest in him that once warm home was as cold as the rest of them. There was Sirius’s place, but it wasn’t home, the only other place he had was his parents final home but he wasn’t about to live in the very home his parents died in. There was the possibility of buying a place or even building one, but what was the point it wasn’t going to be home no matter what he did or how he tried. He was an outcast.</p><p>Which is what lead him to here, standing on the edge of a cliff in the middle of nowhere. Harrison had no interest in dying, but living wasn’t exactly worth it either. It was as though his entire life had been one big punishment. It's not like anyone would care if he were gone, he hadn’t spoken to anyone in months and had a miserably empty little cottage to return to.</p><p>He could already see the headlines ‘Hero Harry Potter Dead Age 19’ ‘Saviour Commits Suicide’ and people would morn as though they truly cared for him even though they hardly knew him at all. “Lady Magic why has my life been nothing but a curse” Harrison cried to the sea “I did what was asked of me and vanquished the Dark Lord” tears began to well up “so why? Why can’t I have MY happy ending?” Harrison was openly sobbing at this point.</p><p>“And you will have it my child, but not here” a soothing voice answered. While most would be terrified at the disembodied voice, Harrison was not, he was overcome with a sudden wave of exhaustion. The world seemed to be flying past before he was swallowed up into the cold darkness.</p>
