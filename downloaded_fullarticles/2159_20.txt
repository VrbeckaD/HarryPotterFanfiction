    <p>Living in the same dorm with the same people for years, you learn things about them that others don't. For example Lavender is protective of Hermione but only when she isn't watching, Fay hates mornings, Kelly can't function without at least 3 cups of tea per day and Hermione is totally in love with Ginny Weasley. A broad accusation I know, but I've lived with her since our first year here, I know her whether she likes it or not- which is probably the latter. For weeks now every time I walk into the dorm and she is sulking in her bed, at first I thought it was because of Ron dating Lavender but when I saw her eyes darken at the sight of Ginny and Dean. I knew. It's not like she and I are close so I won't confront her about it, not yet at least. If she continues acting this way I might have to. She just isn't herself.</p><p>The tension in the dorm is getting horribly out of control, dare I say it? I miss the old Hermione! As well as the old Lavender... The room is completely split in two. On one side I have a love struck lavender squealing about how wonderful 'Ron Ron' is and on the other I have a mumbling depressed Hermione not even being able to focus on a book! This is madness pure madness. I tried talking to Fay and Kelly but they said it's best to just leave it alone, now they just avoid coming up to the room until they have to. </p><p> There was a knock on the door, Lavender being closest got it. "Hermione it's for you." She flipped her hair over her shoulder before falling back on her bed with a heavy sigh.</p><p>"Hermione can I have a word?" The red head asked. Even I could see she had been crying. In an instant my roommate was out of her bed and walking out with Ginny. I couldn't see Hermione's face but I know the expression it held.</p><p>"You see it too don't you." Lavender rolled her eyes joining me on my bed.</p><p>"Of coarse I do Lav-Lav" I smiled brightly trying to stifle my own laughter using Ron's nickname for her.</p><p>She sighed again "We should meddle. Ginny needs to know. Even if she doesn't return the feelings Hermione's has for her, she can at least not snog Dean in front of her." My best friends head hit my shoulder lightly.</p><p>"Didn't you see her eyes? Ginny's been crying. Bet Dean 'n her broke up." I leaned my head against hers.</p><p>"Even better! Let's meddle!"</p><p>I could feel her excitement building. "No. Well not yet. If she does't confess soon we will meddle. I hate seeing her so upset."</p><p>Lavender nodded yawning and nuzzling into me a bit. "Ohhh-kay." she said sleepily.</p><p>I fell asleep to Lavender's hypnotic breathing. I don't know what time it was but I felt a hand on my shoulder and Hermione's voice filled my ears. "Parvati, I don't mean to wake you but if you and Lavender keep sleeping in this position both of you will have horrible kinks in your necks."</p><p>She was concerned about us? She's barely spoken to us in weeks. Is she back to being herself? I opened my eyes fully nudging Lavender "Lavender wake up." I looked over to Hermione who was humming quietly to herself as she readied herself for bed. "Lavender." </p><p>I pushed her a little harder and she startled herself awake "Huh? What?" She groaned I nudged her and motioned over to our roommate. "Oh" she smiled. She saw what I did.</p><p>"Is Ginny okay 'Mione?" I asked getting up to change. "She seemed to have just stopped crying when she came."</p><p>"Mm... She and Dean got into a fight. Being the hothead she is she screamed and yelled. Ending in them breaking up." She sighed whether in content or amusement I didn't know. "We talked for rather a long time. I was able to make her laugh. She seems better now." She picked up the book, she had spent a Week reading, up and settled into her bed.</p><p>"Glad to hear that. Hate to see Gryffindor lose the match tomorrow if she can't keep her head in the game." Lavender piped in after turning off the main lights.</p><p>"She'd never let that happen. Quidditch is her life." A bright smile broke her face- a true smile for once. She turned on her bed side lamp.</p><p>"Everything is going into place." Lavender mumbled drifting into sleep again.</p><p>"Mm agreed Lav-Lav" I smiled falling back into my bed, the last thing I heard was Hermione asking what we meant.</p><p>The next day Gryffindor stomped Hufflepuff mostly thanks to Ginny being the kickass chaser she was and Ron being a brilliant keeper. I followed Lavender to the Gryffindor changing room. The whole team was exiting together, Lavender was on her tippy toes looking for Ron. I looked back into the room and as the door was shutting I caught sight of something beautiful- Ginny had lifted Hermione off her feet and was kissing her. </p><p>"Yes!" I shouted smiling brightly.</p><p>"Did you find him?" my best friend asked.</p><p>I rolled my eyes "No! I saw-" I lowered my voice leaning into her ear "Ginny and 'Mione kiss!" I squealed.</p><p>"Shut it! You did not!?" She smiled brightly. We high fived finally happy to have our friend back.</p><p>"Run off or you will miss your boy!" I pushed Lavender in the direction the team was headed.</p><p>"Oh! Right! See you later Parvati!" She practically skipped off to her Ron-Ron.</p><p>I smiled contently. Everyone was happy, Gryffindor won, the world was as it should be.</p><p>Â </p><p>Hermione was humming contently to herself as she picked up a new book. " Hermione, I think you should know. Lavender and I know about Ginny and you." A look of shock over came her face "Don't look so glum. We won't tell. That is personal you should tell people when you are ready. I just want you to know we are happy for you. And when you are ready to tell the world we will be right behind you the whole way." I smiled warmly at her.</p><p>Tears were brimming in her eyes "Oh...I don't.. Thank you. Just thank you."</p><p>"Andddd with that said. She can sleep in the room without having to sneak out early."</p><p>My brunette counter part blushed lightly. "So you noticed..."</p><p>"No I woke up early one morning to her leaving. Just know if you two want to...um get intimate... Let us know and we will find other arrangements."</p><p>Her blush took over her face before she hid in her book "My god! We are NOT ready for that!"</p><p>I laughed half out of relief and half out of amusement. In that moment Ginny came in groaning "Baby! I need help! This potions essay is killing me!" She looked up catching my eyes "Oh shit...Um I mean Hermione not uh..." She turned scarlet.</p><p>"Love, it's okay she knows." Hermione waved over her girlfriend patting her bed indicting her to sit.</p><p>"Oh? Thought you didn't want to tell anyone yet?" Ginny looked hurt.</p><p>"She didn't tell me, I just knew." I smiled and slowly turned into a smirk "Seeing you kiss her was a dead give away too. Last weeks game." I winked making them both blush. "On that noted you will be getting a talking to." Both girl scrunched up in confusion. "Well you are dating my friend! Meaning you get the 'hurt her and I murder you speech." Their smiles looked as though it would break their faces. I knew they were happy I was so accepting of their new found relationship.</p>
