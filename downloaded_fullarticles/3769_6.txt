  <strong>Of Men and Women (a girl is a loaded gun)</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>Ron can’t volunteer for his sister. He can’t. He just can’t. They’re sixteen for all that Ginny’s only fourteen and he’s going to marry Hermione in two years, when she’s done with school and he’s spent two years down the mines. Hermione's going places, and he’ll follow her anywhere. Ron has a future and he shouldn’t have to sacrifice it to keep his sister. Except the thing is, Ron <em>can</em> volunteer, just not for his sister, and he <em>will</em>, Harry knows. Ladies go first, and Ginny has always scoffed at that, <em>I’m not a lady</em>, and now she's up there standing on the podium, face blazing, head held high, not looking at anyone, and Harry curses the ostensible chivalry too.</p><p>Ginny has six older brothers but only one of them young enough to volunteer. Harry looks to the crowd of onlookers, although he knows he will regret it. Sure enough, the Weasley’s are huddling together in a tight bunch, everyone else having instinctively stepped back, leaving a small space around them. Arthur is sobbing, handkerchief out, as Charlie supports him. Bill looks terrifying, downright murderous, as he stares straight ahead, as bold and brave as Ginny on the podium. The resemblance has always been there but Harry has never appreciated it as much as he does at that moment.</p><p>Fred and George are as Harry expected, already plotting, heads together and muttering something only the two of them would understand. Harry knows they will never accept their little sister’s fate just as surely as he knows they will fail, in the end. Harry doesn’t know what to expect of Percy. His glasses are slightly askew, something Harry has never seen on the normally neat to a fault man. He stands slightly apart from his family. Percy is the loyal one, Harry knows. Percy is the one who believes, truly believes. Harry has always been slightly amused by his fervent loyalty to the Capitol, has never wondered how far it would stretch until now. Percy’s a loyal supporter, but he’s a Weasley, too – probably gets his loyalty in the first place from his family.</p><p>All Harry can concentrate on is the humming energy he can feel to his left, where Ron is standing, but Ginny on the stage doesn’t look worried about him. She knows she can count on Hermione. Hermione looks anguished, but is sensible, ever practical, and she has her hand stretched out to Ron, eyes pleading from across the gap between the Sixth Year girls and boys. Hermione is clever, that’s the thing. The sharpest in the District. Clever in a different way to Ginny, who Hagrid once called a spitfire. Ginny is a spark, burning bright and fast before fading away like she had never been there. Hermione is the low, constant light in the dark, flickering but never extinguishing. Hermione is clever and ambitious and going places. All the way to the Capitol. She'll beat them at their own game. A woman from District 11, a black woman no less. They’ll never expect her, they’ll underestimate her, and by the time they realise it’ll be too late.</p><p>Hermione is too modest to say this, what everyone knows. She is clever enough to know grand heroic statements aren’t enough to do anything, in and of themselves. That the battle hasn’t started yet, and that it will be longer and more mundane than anyone could imagine. That women like her will win it, not men like Ron. That Ron getting himself killed is stupid and pointless, and so, so, <em>so</em> futile.</p><p>Everyone seems to have forgotten Harry in the moment. It’s a strange feeling, but not unwelcome. Ginny has Ron, and Ron has Hermione, and even Hermione has her parents, who are currently comforting Molly, but Harry has no-one. No-one apart from the Weasley’s or Hermione, anyway. A face flickers into his mind but he pushes it away quickly, used to it after years of practice. He hasn’t seen his godfather in years now, and it’s strange he has come into his head now. Except maybe it does make sense.</p><p>Harry knows the aftermath of sacrifice. Sacrifice is flashy and blazing. What comes after is days and nights spent in mourning, and even more days and nights being too tired and hungry to mourn. It’s peacekeepers kicking him out of the Hob, the only place he could sometimes beg a meal, leaving him bleeding out into the snow. It’s growing up on his own, alone. And it’s Molly and Arthur working their fingers to the bone to feed and clothe him as well as their children and never cursing his godfather to his face even though they begged him not to do it. It’s pain and shame and a sense of loss so fierce he sometimes feels as if he is missing a limb. Harry knows what sacrifice does to people. </p><p>Ron can’t. He just can’t. He can’t do that to his family, he can’t do that to Hermione. Harry won’t let him. Ms Umbridge is calling out the boy tribute’s name now anyway, and Harry has no more time to think or decide. He can just act. He was always good at that. Except the name read out stops him momentarily. Malfoy? Did he hear that right? Judging by everyone else’s reactions, he did. One of the District’s elite being picked was certainly uncommon but not entirely unheard of. A Malfoy, though… that was different.</p><p>Harry spares a moment to lament that he is volunteering for the only boy in the whole district who probably did deserve to be reaped. He feels guilty about the thought immediately. No, even Draco Malfoy didn’t deserve the kind of painful death he would almost certainly experience at the Games. Although, come to think of it, would his Dad be able to get him out of it, some kind of under the table deal everyone knew occasionally happened in the Games? Did his connections stretch to the Capitol? Judging by Draco’s boasting, they probably did, but the Malfoys <em>were</em> stuck in District 11 like the rest of them after all, so maybe not…</p><p>Draco’s mother sobs as his father’s face drains of colour and Harry feels relief, for the first time ever, that his parents are not alive to watch what he is about to do. Harry hates flashy statements of sacrifice, understands their ramifications all too well, but all the same he raises his hand a little and tries desperately not to think of his godfather as he says, ‘I volunteer as tribute,’ firmly. He walks to the stage as Draco sags into his mother’s arms and Hermione holds onto Ron, who looks like he doesn’t understand what has just happened. </p><p>Draco comes to see him, and Harry is not surprised. Harry would visit the person who had saved him from a certain death. Harry has always idly thought Draco incapable of empathy but maybe everything has changed now. Maybe they can move past the stupid feud between them that started when Draco called Ron’s family traitors in Year 3 and Harry punched him?</p><p>“My mother made me come,” he says. Maybe not.</p><p>“She wanted me to give you this. She said everyone needed a token of their District.” He holds out his hand and in it Harry sees a curious pin. It is of some magical, mythical creature but Harry doesn’t know what it is called. Draco sees his confusion and explains with obvious glee that Harry doesn’t know something he does.</p><p>“It’s a phoenix. A kind of bird. Except they’re immortal. Every now and then they set themselves on fire and then come back to life. There used to be a lot of them here, I think.”</p><p>Harry feels a weird urge to laugh. He is going to his death and Draco Malfoy is talking to him about birds. Not only that but an apparently immortal bird. </p><p>“Thought your family would be more into snakes,” Harry says. Malfoy looks at him and then speaks quicker, almost as if he doesn’t want anyone to hear him. Harry supposes he is probably the best person to talk to in that case: he will take whatever Malfoy is saying to the grave.</p><p>“It was the old fool’s, I think. Mother wouldn’t say but I’m not stupid, his fucking bird is in a cage in our <em>cellar</em>-” He stops suddenly and then continues, “Look, whatever. Just take the pin. It’s not like you have anything else, do you. And don’t think this changes anything. Mother is grateful but me and Father know. You volunteered to save the girl, didn’t you? She’s a Weasley and everyone knows you’re so pathetic you’d do anything for them because you have no proper family. Father isn’t giving you anything. I don’t owe you anything.” With that, Draco sweeps out of the room, not looking back.  </p><p>The old fool, Malfoy had said. Harry frowns, not really understanding. He knew who Draco meant by the old fool, most likely. Dumbledore used to be the local headteacher when Harry was really young, although that downplays the power he had once held in their District. He was the last remaining rebel, Harry knows. Everyone knew it but the Capitol had never been able to make the charges stick. It helped that he was seen as harmless, an old man with a stick even at the beginning of the uprising. His weapons were always words, and the Capitol sneered at words, preferring blood. No-one told on him, although somebody in the District must have had the proof the Capitol so dearly wanted. Not like they had told on Harry’s parents.</p><p>Dumbledore was viewed with reverence by most. He was their last and greatest link to their past, to the world before the uprising had failed and the Hunger Games put in place. Even the name was twisted against the people. They had named it themselves, was the great irony. In the first few months after the uprising, when there were blockades all over the place, sometimes intentional and sometimes not, when everyone was suffering but there was still hope, people started to call it the hunger game. It was a game they were sure they would win. A game they just had to outlast.</p><p>Then they lost and the new regime turned out to be more bloodthirsty than the one before it, and although mostly they weren’t hungry, every year they paid the price of their bread in blood.</p><p>Dumbledore had gone crazy in the end. It was a shame, everyone said, such a terrible end for such a great man. He had walked around ranting at the air, insisting to anyone who would listen that <em>he</em> had to be stopped. It wasn’t treason, exactly, because he never specified who <em>he</em> was, and there was genuine debate between neighbours whether he really did mean the Prime Minister or not.</p><p>Arthur Weasley had pleaded with him anyway, unsuccessfully, to stop wandering the streets, to go home with him, despite that Arthur could barely feed his kids. The Malfoys were one of the few families to dislike Dumbledore, fear him even. The fact that they apparently had his bird chained up in their cellar was odd, less a surprise to Harry in its callousness than in its specifics. Why would they have his bird, and why would it be chained up? He would expect skeletons in their cellar, weapons, servants chained in a cage even, grotesque villainesque things, not a bird.</p><p>He wonders about the bird and the cage and the phoenix pin and Dumbledore, even the certain prospect of near death not tempering his curiosity. He is distracted by the door opening and his best friends entering, Ron crying and Hermione not. “I’m sorry,” he says desperately, not knowing why he feels a sudden impulse to apologise. “I’m really sorry, Ron, but I couldn’t let you volunteer.”</p><p>His farewells with his family drive all thoughts of Malfoy and the pin from his mind. He slips it in his pocket while Ron and Hermione cry and tell him he’s an idiot. After Ron and Hermione have gone, after Molly and Arthur have gone, after the crying and hugging and pleading and promising, he thinks about what they all said.</p><p>Molly had hugged him fiercely, made him promise not to kill Ginny – I could never, he had said, horrified, and she had dissolved into tears and said she knew but she knew the Games changed you, turned you into something different. Harry supposed she had made Ginny give the same promise, and wished she hadn’t.</p><p>Arthur had looked pained, told him it wasn’t his responsibility to look out for Ginny, told him to look after himself. He looked so tortured when he said that, Harry could barely look in his eyes. Arthur had safely raised five boys to adulthood, and here he was losing his youngest two children. They would all give up their lives for Ginny, and she would give up hers for her family, too, but the only one who could now was Harry.</p><p>Molly asked him to promise to look after himself too, to stay away from Ginny but to not do anything <em>stupid </em>because this time he didn’t have Ron and Hermione with him to make sure he got home safely. He looked down at the floor and promised. He made them promise in return to look after Ron.</p><p>They began to walk away and Harry promised to himself, arms tightly around his knees, that he would send Ginny home to them. They could live the rest of their lives with his loss. So be it. Ron would survive. He had his whole family, <em>would</em> have his whole family. Ron had so much that maybe he would be able to forget Harry, eventually, in a way Harry knew he would never able to forget him.</p><p>Ginny comes up to him on the first day of training. She avoided him on the train and although it hurt he thinks he might have done similarly, if Ginny had volunteered. “Hi,” she says softly. “Hey,” he replies. They both start apologising at the same time and then both break off, laughing.</p><p>“No, listen, Harry,” Ginny says. “Look, I was pissed on the train, okay, and I think I have a right to be. I’m not defenceless. And it hurts that you thought I was. I’m still angry you volunteered. But I get it. I mean, if you weren’t sitting here, Ron would be. You saved my brother’s life, and I’m grateful, but you don’t have to save mine.”</p><p>“Okay,” Harry replies. Ginny gives him a look, but leaves it for now. She says “Allies?” and Harry readily agrees. They go around the various stations. Ginny is small but tough and already knows how to fight. Harry is thin but scrappy and fast. Together, they do all right.</p><p>They end the day laying on the mat, panting. “Alright, so as long as you run and I get a midget to fight, we’ll do all right!” Ginny laughs and it’s a moment they will both savour, later. They take the lift together back to their penthouse flat, and without speaking about it, both go into Harry’s room.</p><p>He doesn’t know if Ron ever told Ginny about his nightmares, but he guesses she had found out anyway from the way she is looking at him. They sit on his bed, staring out of the ceiling to floor windows, both in silent contemplation, and sleep that night side by side. Ginny wakes before him, and slips away to get ready. She doesn’t talk much at breakfast, and at training is distant.</p><p>Harry tries to tease her about her abysmal vegetation identification skills and she breaks the branch in half before stalking off, going to talk with some muscled boy from District 4, Michael Corner, who is over by the pool practicing his already very impressive harpoon shooting skills. </p><p>Harry understands the emotions of the last few days before being thrust into a world where everyone you meet will be trying to kill you, but he doesn’t understand, too. He wasn’t asking Ginny for anything. He wants them to be friends. He wants them to spend their last few days together, their last few days on earth, probably, as friends. Nothing more.</p><p>Ginny can’t seem to even look at him. It’s so like the Ginny of a few years ago that it throws him completely, the Ginny who had a huge crush on him and was incapable of hiding it, who hid from him, shy, could barely speak to him. She was just Ron’s little sister. That changed after Harry saved her from some rich man who didn’t understand morality, the word no or the limit of money. They became friends after that. She grew up overnight, grew into the tough woman you had to be in the District to survive.</p><p>He doesn’t understand her sudden reticence but he leaves her be. The night before the Games, Harry goes to bed early, tired of the tension and tired of not knowing what to say, and if he should say anything at all. He thinks of things he knows he shouldn’t, his parents and his godfather, and what they would say if they were there.</p><p>He doesn’t think of Ginny until she is in his room, the dark night only showing her silhouette and the brightness of her eyes. “You deserve someone to save you, Harry,” she says quietly and Harry doesn’t know how to respond. She kisses him on the forehead, gently, and then leaves. He cries for the first time since the Reaping and then falls into an uneasy sleep, dreaming of phoenixes bursting into flames, turning into the fiery red of Ginny’s hair, screaming for him to save her.</p><p>He doesn’t get much of a chance to speak with Ginny in the morning but she smiles at him before he gets into his pod and she is led off to hers, and mouths “Allies?” at him. He nods until she is out of sight. Always allies.</p><p>The tube sucks him up and spits him out into the arena. He thinks he is blinded for a second before his eyes get used to all the white. It’s like he’s in a desert, except instead of sand there is snow. He soon realises he really will be blind if he doesn’t find eye protection soon, either because the sun reflecting off the smooth snow will blind him or he’ll be forced to close his eyes to avoid that.</p><p>Ginny bounds up to him, having somehow already found snow goggles. She presses a pair to him and together they run away from the battling tributes, away from the small stream and the patch of forest that will hold the only available food and water in the arena. Harry is sure the snow will be poisonous. He never wants to stop running.</p><p>It’s not as cold as it should be in that kind of environment, but it is cold. They can’t light a fire or someone will find them, but if they don’t stay warm they’ll die slowly on their own. He wants to scream.</p><p>Harry kisses her the second night, and thinks, forgive me, Ron. He knows he’ll never see him again to tell him that but he also doesn’t think Ginny would appreciate somebody asking her brother for permission to kiss her. She doesn’t pull away from the kiss but she looks unsure, eyes piercing and sharp. He apologises and she waves him off, saying it’s fine, it’s just that perhaps this isn’t the time.</p><p>They hold each other close when they sleep out of necessity and have even started drinking the snow out of desperation. Harry tried it first while Ginny called him an idiot, but they waited a few hours, or what felt like a few hours, and he was fine, so Ginny has some too, although they are both careful to drink as little as possible.</p><p>Days must go by, but because the sun apparently never sets wherever they are, they have no way of knowing how many. Ginny has a rudimentary way of telling but they can’t devote every second to counting time. Harry feels loose, unanchored with no knowledge of night or day. When a polar bear lumbers up behind them, the excitement is almost a relief. Harry feels his brain tightening, kicking into action after days of lethargy.</p><p>“Mutant polar bears! Oh, fuck!”</p><p>Ginny concurs. “You know what they say,” she yells, as she grabs a stick and begins whacking the polar bear with it. Harry is not convinced of that course of action, as it only seems to make the polar bear angrier.</p><p>“See black, fight <em>back</em>,” she emphasises, striking the bear in the snout. It rears back, regarding them warily. Maybe it’s not a mutant polar bear, maybe it’s just an ordinary bear roused out of slumber by the gamekeepers. Harry has no idea.</p><p>“See brown, stay down-” Ginny is trying to poke out the bear’s eyes but it’s too big and moving ever closer.</p><p>“See white, good night!” Ginny finishes, breathing heavily. Harry thinks desperately. If only he could conjure fire, that might scare off the bear. But how? He can’t just conjure fire out of thin air! He needs matches or –</p><p>“Ginny, give me the stick!” he yells. Ginny is still poking at the bear, but it is clear the stick will need to be transformed somewhat before it will scare off the bear.</p><p>“Um, this stick is the only thing standing between us and certain death! Run, Harry! Save yourself!” He’s not sure how serious she is but he knows as soon as he takes as much as a step, the bear will be on him, and Ginny’s stick won’t do much to stop it. </p><p>“Fire, Gin, we need fire,” and she gets it immediately.</p><p>“Distract him,” Ginny says and then removes the stick. Harry was underestimating its effect. As soon as Ginny is no longer bothering it, the polar bear rears to its full height. Harry is scared of dying but hasn’t he known that would be the outcome for the past week? Indeed, it <em>has</em> to be the outcome.</p><p>He suddenly feels flushed and thinks that his body is releasing endorphins or something to prepare him for dying. He hopes it won’t hurt much. And then the heat becomes unbearable and he looks to Ginny, expecting to see her triumphantly brandishing a lit branch. But she is swearing as she scrabbles on the floor, bent over the snapped in half branch, rubbing the two pieces together. Nothing is happening. The bear is almost upon them. The heat is emanating from his chest.</p><p>He looks down and sees his district pin, the phoenix, <em>glowing</em>. He touches it on instinct: it doesn’t burn him and in fact feels cool to the touch. He feels as if his fingers brush on feathers and he releases the pin in surprise, but his touch seems to have activated something.</p><p>He feels the polar bear’s breath and closes his eyes, waiting for the claws or teeth. Instead he hears Ginny swearing, in awe this time, and he looks up at the sky for some reason. He sees a phoenix, twirling upwards, magnificent and resplendent. The phoenix is burning, brilliant <em>red</em>. It screeches at the polar bear, which starts and moves backwards, frightened.</p><p>“What the fuck,” Ginny says flatly.</p><p>Harry finds his voice. “I didn’t – I don’t know. What happened?”</p><p>“The phoenix came from your pin, I saw it.”</p><p>“But where do you think it <em>came</em> from?” Harry says, frowning. Did Malfoy know the phoenix pin enclosed a real phoenix? Surely not, he wouldn’t want to help him. But perhaps his mother had known.</p><p>“Never mind where it came from! What are we going to do with it? The game keepers will kill it! And then they’ll kill us! What were you <em>thinking</em>?” Ginny spits. </p><p>“I didn’t know, Ginny. I didn’t know that was going to happen. Really. Do you think I would have waited for so long with the polar bear before releasing it if I knew we had a phoenix?”</p><p>She relaxes a little. “Hell of a place for a phoenix. Hey, you know what? We can use it to melt snow for drinking water.”</p><p>Harry wonders at how practical she is. He had been thinking of other things. “I wonder if it has a name,” he says, and he has to laugh at the look at Ginny’s face in response.</p><p>She joins in then, shaking her head at him, and they pass a pleasant afternoon politely asking the phoenix to melt snow for them to wash and drink. They are warmer than they have been since the Games started. They can almost forget where they are. They go to sleep warm, not thirsty, and alive.</p><p>When Harry wakes up it is still light, and he is cold. The phoenix is gone. He feels a burst of longing and loss. The phoenix was here for such a short time, but he feels his absence keenly, because in this snow hellscape he has only Ginny and nothing else: for a few hours, he had another friend and now he’s gone. </p><p>They argue only once. Harry had questioned her plan of going to look for food down by the patch of thawed snow, where the Careers have their igloos. She sarcastically asks if he plans on winning the Hunger Games by starving to death and tell him if he’s so afraid of killing people he should have stayed at home.</p><p>She’s tired and furious, because he didn’t have to be there and she had no choice.</p><p>“I’m not a damsel in distress! Fuck off and go have your hero complex somewhere else. You think I can’t survive without you? I never asked you to be here, I never asked you to volunteer. Now I have to worry about you too. You should have stayed home. Looked after Ron. I mean, fuck, Harry. Okay, best case scenario. I don’t die. How the fuck can I go home without you? Did you think about that, hmm? How could you think I would be okay with you <em>dying</em>?”</p><p>In the end, Harry doesn’t die saving her. He dies saving the little boy from 6, who smiled shyly at his jokes in the training centre and had an older brother at home who didn’t volunteer for him, the bastard.</p><p>They hear screams as they make their way to the forest area and Ginny just knows what Harry will do. She puts her hand out to stop him, but catches air in her fist. Stupid idiot who always, always tries to save everyone but himself.</p><p>Ginny hopes that the phoenix will appear again but Harry is killed by a machete to the throat before he gets halfway to the boy.</p><p>Ginny springs into action, fires the crossbow, aiming at the biggest career, killing him instantly like he had killed Harry. The other two run away. She’s a good shot. In the melee Ginny can only hope the boy manages to get away.</p><p>The phoenix stays in the pin, and Ginny feels betrayed. She gets to Harry’s body, tears off the pin. It stays unchanged in her hand. She shoves it into her pocket, resolving never to ask for it again, let it rot in the pin or wherever it was for eternity. Cage the fucking phoenix.</p><p>The boy, Aharon, lived, and he didn’t run. Ginny adopts him, for Harry but for herself too. Harry wasn’t the only one with a self-sacrificing streak. She looks after him because Harry can’t and resolves to protect him until there is no-one to protect him from but herself.</p><p>Then she will plunge her own dagger into her stomach and he’ll go home and Harry’s sacrifice won’t be for nothing. She won’t go home without Harry, she refuses to. She’ll send the boy home to his older brother and give him another chance to protect him. That is her intention until she fails.</p><p>The boy is so scared of her. He apologises over and over for getting Harry killed, for being too slow and weak to save himself. Ginny can barely stand to hear it because he’s alive when Harry is dead but she is endlessly patient.</p><p>She’s never been patient before and her steadfastness surprises her. She is strong, she knows, bold and courageous, but she’s never been patient before. The Games brings out the best in her, it is plain for everyone to see, and the viewers respond.</p><p>They shower her with gifts, but she hasn’t totally managed to change her inability to hide her true feelings. She is furious at these people, reminded that her sacrifice, and <em>Harry’s</em> sacrifice, is just entertainment to them.</p><p>She only keeps the gifts from her district and the boy’s district. She gives him everything from his district, and shares, straight down the middle, everything from hers. She is fair. She is goddamn fair.</p><p>It’s not fair when one of the remaining Careers ambushes them when they are sleeping, and shoots the boy in the back as he runs while Ginny stays as a distraction. She had failed to get him to the very end, but she could give him as much of a chance as possible by sacrificing herself. That ends with the boy gasping on the forest floor.</p><p>She gapes at the Career, not understanding why he shot the fucking twelve year old and not the girl with the crossbow.</p><p>“I’ve got lots of bullets, love,” he says and she snarls “Don’t call me love.”</p><p>“Where I come from women don’t disrespect men. But you’re not a woman, are you? You’re a <em>whore</em>.”</p><p>“Where I come from, if a man talks to a woman like that he ends up dead.” Ginny says, knowing it’s something of a lie. Men in her district call women whores too, call them worse things. It’s the same everywhere, she supposes.</p><p>Bill’s girlfriend complains to Ginny about him, sometimes, and Ginny could never really muster up any sympathy. She hadn’t liked men in that way, hadn’t thought of them as that. It was confusing to her when a woman complained about a man, even when her mother complained about her dad’s propensity to leave his dirty socks around their house. They shouldn't be with a man if they didn’t want to deal with them.</p><p>Harry confused her. What he did was romantic, wasn’t it? He did it for Ron mostly, but still. Harry had given up his life to save hers, and she should have loved him for it, right? If she was normal, she would have fallen in love with him. She saw the way he looked at her.</p><p>She didn’t know if she loved anyone other than her family, but if she could have - in some future that wasn’t possible for her – in some other world, somehow, where her children wouldn’t have a potential death sentence on their heads – if she had time to worry about someone else other than her family – well, she understood Ron’s love dumb ramblings on Hermione’s bright inquisitive eyes, and Fleur was ten times as brave and brilliant as Bill was, despite his scars.</p><p>Whatever, Ginny would not die at the hands of this boy who would go home and take and mistreat a wife, or daughters, or <em>whores</em>. “What are you?” he gasps in his dying throes and Ginny has never felt as powerful as the moment she answers “I’m a fucking witch, little boy.”</p><p>There’s two more Careers to kill, a girl and a boy. She just wants to go home. She doesn’t want to fight any more. She presses on anyway, knowing her family at home will be cheering her on, so close to victory but unable to let themselves dare to hope.</p><p>She will go home. They don’t need to worry. She will go home to them and worry about everything else when she is back. Her mother told her that. That nothing, nothing Ginny could do would make her not proud of her. Her mother needs her, her father needs her, her brothers need her. Her district needs her, and so does the whole of fucking Panem.</p><p>She has to go home for Harry and Aharon. She can’t let their sacrifice be for nothing. If she doesn’t make it and does die, then she will die knowing she did everything possible to win.</p><p>She heads straight for where she assumes the Careers are, tired of running and hiding. The viewers and the gamemakers want a fight: she’ll give them a fight. She’ll pretend she’s fighting the lot of them, the elite in the Capitol, the elite in District 11, the Malfoys who set up this shit and had the arrogance to believe their children would never fight in it. She’ll pretend they’re the enemy she’s hunting and hurting, not two children. She’ll pretend and do what Harry never could, because he chose to be here, chose to be a hero, and she didn’t.</p><p>It’s late afternoon by the time she reaches an outcrop where the snow suddenly stops, a clear sign of human interference because there’s no change in altitude or anything else that could have naturally produced it.</p><p>There are dark, impenetrable woods on either side, the vast expanse of snow behind her, and in front of her is a sharp drop with giant crabs the size of whales at the bottom, clicking around. She cannot look at them for long. Whatever happens, she is not ending up down there. If she can help it none of them will.</p><p>She just wants it to be fast and painless. That is, if it has to happen at all, and she knows it does. She rests, knowing the others will be driven here soon. This is where it is supposed to end. </p><p>It ends quickly. Quickly and painlessly. She thanks God, fervently, that this last wish is granted to her. She hopes. She can’t exactly ask them – they’re dead, after all.</p><p>Something burns hot in her pocket. She impatiently pushes the glowing pin further down. She doesn’t want to see the phoenix. Now now, when Harry is dead and she still has blood on her hands.</p><p>It’s too late. The phoenix wasn’t there when it really mattered. She knows she shouldn’t even have Harry’s pin but she can’t bring herself to care. She isn’t even curious about it like Harry had been. He had told her of what Malfoy had said, but she hadn’t cared then and she didn’t particularly now. The Malfoys were evil. Of course they had Dumbledore’s bird locked up in their cellar.</p><p>Ginny goes home, and Fred is dead.</p><p>Her mother couldn’t make it to the station when she arrived in her District; her father was there, unsmiling. Ron and Hermione broke up, during the games, and no-one will tell her when or why.</p><p>Hermione leaves, on some fancy scholarship in the Capitol, and Ginny doesn’t even know any more whether she still intends to take them down, but knows it’s too dangerous to ask.</p><p>Percy goes to the Capitol too and Ginny doesn’t even have to question his loyalties. She really can’t blame him: she would leave, if she hadn’t fought so hard to return, if she had anywhere else to go. She is glad that at least there is one person she loves that she doesn’t have to look after because he is determined to do it himself.</p><p>There’s an investigation into the phoenix pin, but magic isn’t real, Dumbledore is dead, and the fact that the investigation leads back to the Malfoys is politically awkward enough for it to be dropped. She plays the lovestruck teen, pretending she wanted one last remainder of her boyfriend. She tries to give it back to Narcissa Malfoy but she refuses, so the pin stays on Ginny’s mantelpiece in her new house in Victor Village. </p><p>And Fred is dead. He’s dead.</p><p>Ron is as awkward about the kiss as she imagined, and she has a sudden urge to laugh because it’s so typically overprotective older brother and she wishes that Harry was there to be on the receiving end of it. Although if he was still alive she wouldn’t keep on kissing him, she thinks. Would she have to pretend if somehow they both survived the Games? Would they be safe, together? She is glad she doesn’t have to find out.</p><p>Fred was buried in a landslide the day after she won the Games. He was at the bottom of a cliff on the outskirts of the District, gathering some kind of plant they needed to make exploding celebratory (illegal) fireworks on her return. Ginny knows if she wasn’t in the Games he would still be alive. Worse, if she hadn’t <em>won</em> the Games, Fred wouldn’t have been there at that spot when the earthquake hit…</p><p>Her parents and Ron move into the house as her dependents. Her other three brothers aren't allowed but they visit often and Ginny sends them home every time with a cloth full of money and food.</p><p>There's never enough to go around the whole District. She spreads it as thinly as possible, telling the shopkeepers to give what they can and charge her later, and vows to never let another child die of starvation.</p><p>She doesn't live long enough to learn the Capitol plans to force her to.</p><p>Her father does his best, he still takes in strays. They don't really speak of the stray they took in all those years ago, just as George doesn't really speak of Fred. Sometimes, sometimes they'll laugh at a fond memory and that's enough.</p><p>Ron takes a local wife. Ginny loves her niece Harriet like she is her own. Ron still goes down the mines despite Ginny's pleading that he doesn't have to. He wants to provide for his own family, and she loves him, but wonders if this pigheadedness is what made Hermione leave.</p><p>Ginny gives George money to set up a joke shop, of all things. She’s sceptical it is what the District really needs but it is so patently good for him and the children in the District that she relents. Charlie joins him.</p><p>She pays for Bill and Fleur's wedding and they lie shamelessly to the Capitol, claiming everyone in the District knew them, of course they have to have a party the whole District is invited to.</p><p>The Capitol sends spies to the wedding and Ginny passes a few hours having fun messing with them. She’s young and fearless and a Victor and they’ve taken all they can from her, she thinks. Then Charlie pulls her onto the dance floor for a spin and she ends up dancing crazily with George, both of them laughing, lighter than they have felt in months.</p><p>She starts a slow, tentative friendship with the victor next door, Loony Lovegood. She's crazy, had seen horrors in her battle. Everyone knew she only fought to come home to her father, whose wife had been taken back to the Capitol after a visiting official took a fancy to her. The taken women never came back. And children from District 11 never came back either but Luna did.</p><p>Her arena was some kind of enchanted forest with mutated animals at every turn. She somehow managed to tame them. Nobody knew whether that was supposed to be possible or not and the Gamekeeepers maintained afterwards that it was the intended outcome all along. Ginny isn't sure but Luna keeps her mouth shut.</p><p>Luna laughs at the polar bear story and is intrigued by the Phoenix. She knew of them but has never seen one. She thinks her mother has. Ginny wants to ask if Luna ever visits her when she has to go to the Capitol but isn't brave enough to ask. Luna takes up carrying the pin around. She is the best with animals of anyone Ginny has met but the pin doesn't light up for her.</p><p>Arthur and Luna's father become friends too, sitting around the scrubbed wood table in the Weasley’s bustling house or the Lovegood’s quiet one, silently sharing all that they had lost. And Ginny comes to love Luna, but the time they get together is too short.</p><p>Later the rebellion comes again, and it fails, again. They need a figurehead. They need a fucking figurehead, Ginny knows even as she joins with her brothers, Percy included, but the one person she ever knew who could rally an army without even realising it is dead.</p><p>He’s dead, and it’s her fault.</p><p>She lives with the guilt until she doesn’t, a public execution, side by side with Hermione, and she scoffs, no longer the little girl she had been once on a similar podium, pretending to be brave for her upcoming death: this time she accepts it readily, not suicidal but thinking it is finally, finally her turn to die for herself. She is allowed that grace, in the end. </p><p>Her mother loses her five sons to the battle, and her only daughter too. She would have given herself but somebody needs to look after the babies left behind. Luna dies, too, and the pin is buried with her.</p><p>Narcissa Malloy isn't sure what she had hoped would happen after she unleashed Dumbledore’s phoenix from the cage in her cellar, but it's not that. She escapes with her husband’s life but not her son’s, and she lives in gilded luxury in the Capitol, and waits her entire life for someone braver than her to take on the Capitol and win.</p>
