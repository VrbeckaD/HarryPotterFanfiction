  <strong> Potters' cottage, October 30th, 1981</strong>
</p>
<p>The clock was ticking. The dining room had been deadly silent for what felt like eons. The only sound that could be heard was the soft snoring of the babies away in their cribs.</p>
<p>Peter, Lily and James were so anxious they could barely for words.</p>
<p>"James," Lily looked at her husband with a dark look in her usually cheery eyes "I think Sirius is right...we need to-"</p>
<p>James, who had been staring resolutely at the table since Sirius had made his suggestion, looked up sharply, and his expression cut Lily off.</p>
<p>It wasn't angry, or livid, or thoughtful....it was hurt. Something beyond despair, his eyes were like shattered glass that stung Sirius everytime he tried to look into them. He looked away.</p>
<p>"Would you really do that, Padfoot?"</p>
<p>"I-I don't know....I'm worried they'll blackmail me and-"</p>
<p>"I thought we were more important to you than anything"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but-"</p>
<p>"Your family.....do you think they'll blackmail you about killing them.....do you really care? I mean, maybe, but I just thought...." He trailed off, his eyes downcast and looking wet.</p>
<p>"Listen to me, Potter" there was a collective suck of air. Sirius <em> never </em> called James by his last name, it just felt too impersonal, as though they weren't brothers in all but blood, "You-all of you, you're like the only family I've actually had.....but....Reggie....what if they... they-"</p>
<p>He choked up. James had tensed, and didn't look like he was going to say anything anytime soon.</p>
<p>"I get it, Siri," Lily said, softly, placing a hand over Sirius', "I know what it's like to love a family who seems to hate you"</p>
<p>He nodded stiffly, and then, avoiding eye contact with James, he turned to Peter.</p>
<p>"Wormtail!" He said, trying and failing to give his signature grin "You ready to do this, then?"</p>
<p>"I-I was born ready" Wormtail squeaked, a bead of sweat trickling down his cheek. He'd been oddly silent throughout the exchange. He gave a nervous sort of smile.</p>
<p>And they went on to change the Secret Keeper from a loyal dog, to a fellow rat.</p>

  <strong> Potters' cottage, October 31st, 1981</strong>
</p>
<p>James had been feeling pretty off today. He couldn't quite put a finger on it. But he just knew something was about to go wrong. But then again, wasn't that what they had all been feeling since the beginning of this War.</p>
<p>He went on with his day. Another day of being practically imprisoned in this house, admitted, with a people he loved, but still, he wanted to live the remainder of his probably short life. Right now, he was just surviving.</p>
<p>But whenever he thought of that, he thought of Harry, and Hope. And he'd hate himself for being so selfish. The two were children of the Prophecy, how could he look out only for himself and forget that doing any form of innocent mischief would put his kids' life in jeopardy?</p>
<p>His kids. Wow. The kids he had with Lily Evans <em> Potter</em>. It still felt unbelievable that she had gone from the girl he fought on the very first day of his first year, to the love of his life, to his wife, to the mother of his twins. He was so, <em> so </em> proud of their little family. Though, he still wished he could give Hope and Harry a little more freedom.</p>
<p> He knew they were just infants, and had no idea of what their existence meant to the Dark Lord and how big a part they were of the War, but he would worry that the War would still be raging when they grew up, when they asked him why they were locked in this cottage for all their life, why they couldn't go to school and do all the mischief he'd most definitely tell them stories about.</p>
<p>He had been sitting at the windowsill in the living room, pondering, when two, thin, nimble arms wrapped around his shoulder and a chin was rested on his head. Red flaming hair fell around his own black bangs and tickled his face.</p>
<p>"You're overthinking again" she said, her voice neutral.</p>
<p>"That I am, Evans-Potter" he said, with a slight smile.</p>
<p>"You're never going to get tired of saying that, are you?", She smiled slightly against his hair.</p>
<p>"Nope," he tugged at her arms and brought her to stand in front of him "Nor am I going to get tired of realising over and over how beautiful you are"</p>
<p>"Stop being cheesy, Potter" she grinned.</p>
<p>"N-E-V-E-R," he interlaced their fingers, "Whenever-<em> if </em> Hope and Harry get married, I'm gonna kiss <em> you </em> everytime they're asked to kiss<em> their</em> husband or wife, and then tell them that we're the better couple"</p>
<p>"Sure, Jamie," </p>
<p>Ok, she really did know how to divert him.</p>
<p>She started swaying slightly as if to the rhythm of a song, smiling gently at him. None of them articulated the thought that they might never make it. </p>
<p>"Potter, remember that time you tried to pull me into a dance at the Quidditch Cup Celebration in 5th Year?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, with fake bitterness "And you had told me to fuck off after upending a bottle of Butter Beer on my ravenous locks."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well" she said with a laugh "I'd like to apologize to your locks by giving you that dance - only your locks, mind you"</p>
<p>"Of course, my Lady," he said with a bow, and flicked his wand with one hand while the other was interlaced in hers.</p>
<p>A song started playing, but they had no idea what it said, all they knew was that they were dancing with each other, in the living room of their own house, with their babies sleeping inside, staring into each other's eyes like nothing else existed.</p>
<p>"I love you, James Fleamont Potter" Lily said, in barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Lily Evans Potter" James said, in the same voice.</p>
<p>"Until the very end" they said, in unison, resting their foreheads against each other and closing their eyes.</p>
<p>They only stopped dancing when they heard a cry from inside, Hope had gotten into a fight with Harry again after he woke her up by kicking her. They laughed at the two and each lifted one up into the crook of one arm as they held each other's hand with the other.</p>
<p>And that was it, this was their little bubble of joy in the dead centre of a war, as they comforted their baby twins, holding onto each others hands. They rested their heads against each other and watched Harry and Hope giggle and play with each other, both of them resting their heads against each other on seeing their parents doing so.</p>
<p>And James cried harder than the two infants combined.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This little bubble of joy was popped that night.</p>
<p>He had been on the couch, with Hope and Harry clapping their pudgy little hands, sitting on his knees, as he created bubbles and vanished them into thin air.</p>
<p>"Hey," He heard Lily's stern voice coming from the bottom of the stairs "Time for bed, <em> all </em> of you"</p>
<p>"Aww" they all groaned. But nobody ever dared defy the orders of Lily Evans Potter.</p>
<p>She walked to the couch and picked the two up. Hope nuzzled into her shoulder, looking convincingly sleepy, but James knew better, she would always pretend to sleep so she could wake up late at night, whenever James came to check in on them, and when had James ever been able to say no to them? He wondered if she'd become a Slytherin. Though, being with Sirius had taught him there wasn't much wrong with that. He'd be proud of her sense of mischief either way.</p>
<p>Harry was pouting like he'd like to throw a tantrum, but looked too exhausted for that. James grinned. These two were going to grow up to take over after the Marauders.</p>
<p>Lily gave him a smile and a deep kiss, where there'd normally would've been a quick peck, because they didn't know how many more kisses they'd share. She turned around, and walked up the stairs. He dropped his wand on the couch and got up to stretch.</p>
<p>That's when he heard it. A shaking of the main door. And he ran, without thinking, out into the hallway. <em> Curse his stupid, reckless, Gryffindor brain. </em> </p>
<p>He'd known who it would be, even before the door opened to reveal a snakelike face with slits for pupils and red irises. He knew his efforts would've been in vain even if he'd had his wand, but yet, he didn't care about himself, he'd never had, the only people he cared about were--</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <strong>"LILY, TAKE HOPE AND HARRY AND RUN, I'LL HOLD HIM OFF"</strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p>He barely had time to register what was happening when Voldemort's wand raised, his mouth moving to say a familiar incantation. The last thing that crossed his mind wasn't that he had been betrayed by his best friend, but that Lily, Hope and Harry could all die because of this monster, and it'd be because he'd failed to give them enough time.</p>
<p>There was a burst of green light, and</p>
<p>
  <strong><br/>
HIS </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>WORLD </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>WENT </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>BLACK<br/>
</strong>
</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Later, when Hagrid came to search the demolished house with a grief-stricken heart and eyes that wouldn't stop watering as he passed the corpses of two of the brightest souls he knew, he saw two babies crying in their cribs.</p>
<p>One was calling for his mama, wondering why she hadn't yet given him a goodnight kiss before tucking him in with his sister. A lightning shaped scar was slashed across his forehead, while the other stared up at at Hagrid with wide, terrified eyes, as if she knew what had happened, and the same scar on <em> her </em> forehead seemed to stand out more prominently than her brother's.</p>
