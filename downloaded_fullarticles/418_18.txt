    <p>“What about these ones!?” A grey centaur snarled pointing at Harry and Hermione as a huge centaur appeared behind Harry wrapping his arms around Harry’s torso and holding him so tight he could barely breathe.</p>
<p>“You said you don’t hurt young” Hermione spluttered trying to back away. “Please, we only came here because we needed your help.”</p>
<p>Harry knew immediately that this was the wrong thing to say as all of the gathered centaurs started shouting and snarling, stomping their hooves in agitation.</p>
<p>Harry squirmed trying not to panic as the centaur holding him reared, pulling him off the ground for a moment.</p>
<p>Hermione looked terrified, her eyes darting around the gathered centaurs trying to find an escape.</p>
<p>“They came here unasked, now they must pay the consequences of their actions, they can join the woman!” A centaur Harry recognised as Bane shouted, to the roaring approval of the other centaurs.</p>
<p>“No!” another voice called out and Harry turned to see Firenze walking into the circle of centaurs that had gathered around Harry and Hermione. For a moment Harry felt hope… but then that moment ended.</p>
<p>“They have come into our lands uninvited, enabling us to get rid of that woman for them, like we are here for no other reason to do their bidding. They have the same arrogance as most of their kind. They shall be punished in the old ways.”</p>
<p>A roar of approval met his words and Harry’s heart sunk wondering what was going to happen to them.</p>
<p>Hermione looked faint sinking slowly to the forest floor as tears ran down her face.</p>
<p>“You will come and live with us amongst the herd young ones, you will serve as we all serve and learn our ways. Hopefully, this will help you gain the proper perspective needed to treat us with the appropriate amount of respect that we deserve.”</p>
<p>Harry looked green at the thought and started to struggle harder against the centaur holding him captive. “How… how long do we have to live with you?” He stuttered out.</p>
<p>Bane gave him a malicious grin, “a year and a day is what is required.”</p>
<p>Harry and Hermione both started shouting at his words.</p>
<p>“NO!” Harry cried, “Sirius needs my help, we have to go!”</p>
<p>“You are going nowhere,” Firenze said, staring at Harry intently. Harry took in the astonishingly blue eyes and the hair so pale blonde it would put Malfoy to shame swallowing thickly before turning his gaze away. “Your Sirius will be fine.”</p>
<p>Harry calmed a little at the words, what had Firenze meant? Had he seen something in the stars?</p>
<p>“Take them away” Firenze muttered, the other centaurs hastening to comply. </p>
<p>Without a word of warning the centaur holding Harry swung him up into his arms holding Harry so tightly he couldn’t move a muscle. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw another centaur step forward, this one had deep red hair and a beautiful chestnut coat, grabbing Hermione and swinging her up into his arms, ignoring her further protests.</p>
<p>Harry knew that without their wands they didn’t stand a chance against this herd of centaurs. He tried to give Hermione a reassuring look but knew judging from the look of terror on Hermione’s face that it was mostly ineffective.</p>
<p>He had thought that Firenze was quite decent, having saved Harry’s life in first year but obviously Harry had grossly misjudged the tall centaur.</p>
<p>He silently fumed as Hermione and he were carried through the forbidden forest, there had to be a way out of this, he just had to bide his time until they found one.</p>
