  <b>Epilogue: Just give me the boy, Albus!</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>    </b>
  <span>Minerva never thought she’d have to raise Harry Potter; the Boy Who Lived. But she refuses to allow Albus Dumbledore to just set the poor boy where </span>
  <em>
    <span>Muggles </span>
  </em>
  <span>roamed. She didn’t have anything against Muggles, of course. But just… to leave the Boy Who Lived; the savior of their world, without a clue on who he really was? Here? Where his cousin would probably kill him within forty-eight hours. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Harry was so small in Hagrid’s arms. Minerva bit her lip for a moment before whirling on Albus. “Give him to me!” She said and Albus looked shocked. “Minerva,” he said gently. “It is so much better for him to stay here. He’d get special treatment in our world, Professor.” Minerva shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“I’m a stern woman,” she hissed. “Just let me raise James and Lily’s son. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Please</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Albus. I won’t spoil him, like Diggory would. I won’t even try to </span>
  <em>
    <span>convert</span>
  </em>
  <span> him like Malfoy would. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Just give me the boy, Albus</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” Dumbledore paused for a moment before turning to look at her quietly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“When terms start, Professor, I’ll think perhaps I’d rather like to see a kitten roaming the halls,” Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye. Dumbledore gently set the baby in Minerva’s arms. She kept the child close. “I suppose the letter should be changed.” Hagrid said, a huge smile breaking across his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Ah, yes!” Dumbledore sat down and reopened the envelope, taking out ink and a quill (from where, Minerva never knows); and then pulled his wand out, erasing the ink already dried. Dipping the quill in the ink, Dumbledore began to write. “Professor, don’t you need to go home? Hagrid, please you too. I may be an old man, but I haven’t lost my memories.” The twinkle seemed to shine just a bit brighter. Hagrid left with the roar of Sirius’ motorcycle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Go on. Petunia needs to learn Lily has died. Oh, Minerva?” She turned around for a moment. “Don’t expect Severus to go easy.” Minerva’s expression frosted over. “I never did,” she said and Albus nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>With a faint </span>
  <em>
    <span>pop</span>
  </em>
  <span> Minerva was gone. And so was baby Harry. All there was left was an old man with a long beard, and parchment being written on. When he finished, Dumbledore placed the letter through their mailbox; and also had given the date for James and Lily’s funeral. He doubts they’d show up.</span>

  <span>Mr and Mrs Dursley are perfectly normal, thank you very much.</span>
