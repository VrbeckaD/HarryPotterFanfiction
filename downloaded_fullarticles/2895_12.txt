    <p>“Newt, stop it! If you can’t control yourself around cookie dough, then leave the kitchen!”</p><p>Newt snorted, stealing another pinch of sugar cookie dough from the bowl. Tina growled, smacking him across the head. </p><p>“Bugger off, Tina! Let me eat my dough in peace!”</p><p>“If you eat all the dough, there will be no sugar cookies, you- NEWT!”</p><p>He had used her ranting as a distraction to steal another pinch from the bowl. He was snickering madly, and he had to duck to avoid another slap.</p><p>“You could have kicked me out of the kitchen a while ago. You know I have a craving for sugar cookie dough. Yet, you keep me around? Why is that?”</p><p>Tina tried to grab him, but he dodged, grabbing yet another pinch. She pulled off her apron, stalking towards him. He let out a yelp of laughter, running out of the kitchen, Tina close on his heels. He ran out the door and out into the snowy evening, snowflakes still falling from above. She finally reached him and tackled him to the ground, shoving snow into his face. He laughed and threw snow into her face, making her yelp. They got into a vicious fight, rubbing snow on each other. Newt was laughing as she shoved snow down the back of his shirt.</p><p>I am fighting Newt Scamander with snow over some stupid cookie dough.</p><p>She started to giggle at the thought, and this gave Newt the chance to shove her off of him, getting up and turning to run. She didn’t follow him though, and it took him a moment to realize this. He turned back to look at her curiously. She gave a smile and a shrug</p><p>“I give up. You can eat all the cookie dough you want. I honestly don’t care at this point.”</p><p>He frowned, walking up and offering her his hand. She took it, and he helped her up. </p><p>His cheeks and nose were beginning to turn red. Snowflakes were caught in his hair. She brushed a few off of his shirt sleeve.</p><p>“You aren’t wearing the proper winter clothing, you idiot. We need to get back inside-“</p><p>“Why did you keep me around? In the kitchen?”</p><p>Tina thought for a moment, then shrugged. “I like spending time with you. And it isn’t fun to bake sugar cookies alone.”</p><p>He blinked, clearly a little surprised. He quickly corrected himself, brushing off some more snowflakes from his sleeves.</p><p>“It’s freezing. We should probably go inside.”</p><p>She turned to leave, but he stopped her, gulping nervously.</p><p>“Tina, Jacob told me that I needed to be honest with you-“</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>Newt went silent, struggling to find words. Tina frowned, reaching for his hand.</p><p>“Newt, is everything okay?”</p><p>“I’m terrible with words.”</p><p>“That’s okay. Just tell me the best you can.”</p><p>Newt took a shuddering breath, eyes averted. He opened his mouth to speak, only to close it. Tina squeezes his hand, trying to give him support. </p><p>He suddenly pulls his hand away, bringing both of them up to her face hesitantly. The last thing she sees is Newt’s hazel eyes before he presses a kiss on her lips, a little clumsy, but eager. </p><p>His lips are warm, a little chapped. His freckled nose is pressed into her cheek, calloused hands gently framing her face, his fringe tickling her forehead lightly.</p><p>He broke away after a few short seconds, face bright red. He mumbled an apology, turning to leave, but she quickly intercepts, kissing him fully.</p><p>His eyes are wide when she pulls back, and now it’s her turn to blush.</p><p>“C’mon. We still have a lot of dough left.”</p>
