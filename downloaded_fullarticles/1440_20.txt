    <p>
  <span>Charlus winces for what must be the umpteenth time that evening, yelping as he feels the fierce talons of his beloved wife gripping his undoubtedly already broken hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorea takes the worst of these moments, but is still a sight to behold; her cheeks flushed red, face set in a tight grimace only permeated by the occasional groan. Sweat beads and trickles down her face, matted black hair wild against her scalp. There’s a maid nearby to dab the sweat off her. She’s so different like this, from the poised, stern lady most of wizarding society knew her as, but Charlus loves her all the same.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see the baby mistress!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorea grouses something, all before she's screaming bloody murder and yelling at Charlus that they're never having another child—he readily agrees; one child had taken a toll on Dorea’s health, but she'd been determined to carry the pregnancy through despite the warnings from the healers. She wanted a baby, and there’s only so much he can deny her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He has his own face angled away from where the nursemaid and midwife are; they're shouting their encouragements and it's with bated breath that he awaits the sound of </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> slipping free—all before he hears the first loud, wet cry of the baby. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Their </span>
  </em>
  <span>baby.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"It's a boy, mistress! A healthy baby boy!" The midwife booms rather loudly. A pudgy woman, she’d been delivering the Black family children for two generations now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorea smiles; she'd long guessed they'd have a son. He doesn't know how she managed to get it right but she'd chastised him, telling it was simply intuition. Her arms are shaky from strain as she holds them out but her voice is firm as she speaks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Give him here."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The maid obeys, and the baby—wiped off and swaddled in charmed warming blankets, having settled to a coo now from his early yowlings—Charlus takes a peek at over the wrap of white. He’s treated to the face of his newborn, eyes closed but peaceful just like his mother. They make for a magnificent sight, ethereal as Muggle paintings depicting Mary with baby Jesus. Perhaps it’s an unorthodox comparison, one Dorea might swat him for, but there’s no better way he’d ever capture the moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dorea looks up at him now, face still flushed but this time lips pulled into the biggest smile he's ever seen on her face. They'd decided on his name long before, and his own voice is a low baritone, a soft murmur to their baby boy who twitches at the sound of their voices.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Welcome to the family, Cepheus Charlus Potter."</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry James Potter dies surrounded by loved ones.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’d lived to a grand old age of one hundred and twenty two. Many had wished for longer but years of having to shoulder the world on your back did that to even the best of them. His wife, Ginny, with a somber smile on her face, traces idle fingertips across his battle-worn and scarred palms as she whispers something—he doesn’t hear, his consciousness fades in and out these last few moments.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knows his children are nearby; their barely held back sobs wrenching something in his heart. Ron and Hermoine—he knew—had visited but wanted to give the Potter family the peace they needed on his deathbed; it’s a quiet that Harry does appreciate, a quiet he uses to reflect on the life he’d lived.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Boy Who Lived. The Chosen One. Auror. Husband. Father. Grandfather. Great-grandfather.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A whole life, a good life he supposed; he’d set wizarding Britain back on its feet after the war and managed to settle down to becoming an Auror after it all—he was, in his life: loved and respected, both, and feared, yes, but above all allowed to live, finally. He lived as a pillar, a figurehead that people looked up to and admired. He had three beautiful and successful children, and Teddy too because Teddy was everything including his own, and they all had their own families now; all little (well, they seemed little to him) grandchildren Harry had been lucky enough to meet just before his body started failing him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His last breath isn’t painful. He’s died before and the second time he welcomes with an embrace like an old friend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny presses a kiss on his forehead, soft and fond just like her love for him; he feels it just as he feels himself dip under the darkness, and he smiles.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry James Potter dies surrounded by loved ones.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Halfway to the train, he gets asked by someone—he’s not sure who, just a disembodied voice, lilting and echoing—asking him if he regrets anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Shamefully, he does. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(He regrets the lives he knew and couldn’t save. Savior complex ... perhaps those words had some truth in them after all. He’d also died with a lot of secrets. If he could live another life he’d like one he’d never have to hide, but that’s a more private, selfish little wish.)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He gets asked if he’d do it all again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe, he considers his answer, but—and with a laugh he adds—he’d like better circumstances.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’s yanked forcefully backward by a hand he doesn’t see, away from the platform.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The train leaves (again) without him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His second life begins with two doting parents, just like the first. This time, they won’t die protecting their baby—this time, he’ll get to live a childhood the first never afforded him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In this life, there’s no prophecy hovering over him, no Dark Lord he has to defeat. He’s just a boy with two parents who love him, with a future unwritten and one he’ll be able to shape with his own hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t have to become Atlas, the same voice as before whispers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The heavens aren’t on his shoulders to bear anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he gets older, he’ll wonder if that was fate’s way of apologizing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cepheus Charlus Potter takes his first breath with an angry bawl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s painful, agonizingly so, sensations entirely new with a body not exactly his own. That’s all soothed by the blankets and arms that hold him protectively, cocooning him, and a voice that ushers him—warm and loving—into the world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Welcome to the family, Cepheus Charlus Potter."</span>
