          <div class="userstuff"><p>“I can’t believe they didn’t postpone this match,” Hermione grumbled, rubbing her hands together. Even with her scarf, hat, and mittens, she was freezing. It had also snowed earlier than morning.</p>
<p>“Well, this match has already been rescheduled three times,” Luna countered. </p>
<p>“I’d rather be in the library,” Hermione grumbled under her breath.</p>
<p>Luna laughed. “But you’re supporting your best friends,” she pointed out, nudging Hermione with her shoulder. </p>
<p>“I should have bundled up better,” Hermione grumbled. </p>
<p>“You’re super cranky this morning,” Luna hummed. </p>
<p>“And cold,” she added again.</p>
<p>“Well, I have the perfect solution,” Luna said, scooting closer to Hermione. Taking the large, knitted shawl from her shoulders, she wrapped it around Hermione, so that the two of them were now snuggled closely underneath it. “Better?” she asked, looking at Hermione.</p>
<p>Hermione snuggled against Luna, resting her head on her shoulder. “Much,” she hummed. “Only one thing would make this better.”</p>
<p>Luna chuckled. “Lucky for you, I got it.” Reaching into her pocket, she pulled out a bag of edible dark marks. </p>
<p>Hermione brushed her lips against Luna’s cheek. “Snacks and a shawl larger enough for us both? How did I get so lucky?”</p>
<p>“For once, I’m the prepared one.” Luna grinned. “Don’t worry; I won’t tell anyone.”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha,” Hermione said dryly, reaching into the bag and helping herself to one of the candies. </p>
<p>Luna hummed happily, content to be snuggled up with Hermione as they waited for the match to start.</p></div>
