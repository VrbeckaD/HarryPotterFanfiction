    <p>His breath bloomed in front of him, the air crystallized and cold. Remus had been making his way slowly up to the astronomy tower, a pack of cigarettes snugly fit in the pocket of his rather small hoodie, and wand in his wander, cast “Lumos” in his left hand. He was expecting the freezing tower to be empty, as winter was very quickly creeping up upon Hogwarts. But alas, he found himself in the company of a large black mass of a human, wrapped in a heavy blanket.<br/>
He took a few short steps after landing on the last step, cautiously moving towards the large glassless window, where the other body was sitting. In his nervousness, his voice wavering, along with the clattering of teeth.<br/>
“Would you mind if I sat here?”<br/>
The figure suddenly tensed up in a matter of seconds, causing Remus to tense up, taking a step back and gripping his cigs in his pockets. There was a stiff and heavy silence that filled the air, neither saying a thing. Slowly, the figure moved to reveal himself at Severus.<br/>
“If I can have one.” He remarked back after a few unbearable more seconds had passed. It was the voice of his bully, hoarse and unused in hours and the consumption of too many potions. Remus was left confused for a few seconds before blurting out;<br/>
“One what?” Severus chuckled, low and gravely before pointing to his pocket, causing Remus to go beet red and a smile to cross the others face slyly.<br/>
“If you’ve got a light, yes.” Remus began to cross the path, past all of the class equipment and brooms from other students going on midnight adventures. Just like Severus, he sat down at the opening of the large window, staring outwardly at the stars, but facing his classmate.<br/>
Severus stared right back, an indecisive look washed upon his face, as he pulled at his zippo from the Slytherin dress robe he wore underneath the blanket. Remus began pulling the cigarettes out of his pocket, struggling a bit with his pocket barely being big enough to fit the box in them. The hoodie was quite old, as he had held onto it since he was in primary school. It was one of his favorites, a simple warm brown hoodie with beige stripes across the sleeves. It had become faded and worn over the years, but he refused to part with it.<br/>
As he pulled the two out for the both of them and laid the nearly crushed box on the floor next to where they were sitting He handed one to Severus, and motioned for the lighter so he could light his own between his lips. The black-haired potion aster frowned rather heavily, pulling the zippo to hold back, and up above his head. Remus sputtered in place, looking rather dumbfounded. There was a rather lengthy pause, as they both kept strong eye contact. Remus had knitted his eyebrows together and pulled a pout across his face. Snape lowered his zippo, flicking it open.<br/>
“Beautiful people do not light there own cigarettes.” He said simply after a huffed breath. Remus stared at him, looking nearly angry for a moment before giving up and leaning in to light his cigarette. The zippo was handed to Remus, and he took a moment to close it, looking at the snake that had been engraved into the casing, its eye winking at it as it curled nearly the opening. Severus took a moment to loudly clear his throat before eyeing up his lighter.<br/>
“I-Ah. I see.” Remus’ face light up red once again, as his shoulders raised and his back slouched towards the other. He flicked it open once more and pulled his arm outwards to light Severus’ cig. He got a rare smile from the Slytherin. Snape reaches up to take his lighter back, and their hands brushed for just a second. Remus sucked in a breath, pulling his hand away like he had been hurt. There was a stiff silence, neither wanting to make eye contact after that had happened. The only sound between the two of them was the drag of the cigarettes and the occasional owl hooting in the nearby forest.<br/>
“I’m sorry.” That had gotten the attention of Severus. Remus had a serious tone in his voice, making dead eye contact with his smoking partner. The moonlight had shone through the speckled clouds, illuminating on the scars littering his jaw and cheeks. Severus felt his heart jump a bit. He had never really stopped to look at the werewolf before now. Although he was scarred and littered with freckles, there was an odd sort of messy allure to him.<br/>
“For Sirius. I’m sorry for all the marauders. He means well but, he’s stubborn and stupid.” The Gryffindor looked away in shame, obviously have contemplated this for a while. He began talking again, his voice wavering.<br/>
“I’ve always just watched while you’ve tormented them. And they have tormented you back. I know that there have been times that you have gone relentlessly in on me before. But it all sits so heavy in my chest. I know you’re trying hard for lily. And I’m sorry that I’ve never done anything for either party. But this has been so wonderful. YOU have been so wo-” Severus had gotten frustrated by hearing Remus’ babbling apology, and pulled him close by the strings of his sweatshirt and into a strong kiss.<br/>
He pulled back for a second, looking rather red in the face and extremely embarrassed. Remus just gawked at him and mulled upon the thoughts in his head. He had no clue snape even QUESTIONED his sexuality. How long had he wanted to do that? The brunet looped his arms behind the others neck and gave him a small kiss on the forehead. Severus looked dumbfounded.<br/>
“Why did you let me?” Snape asked after a few minutes of silence. They had stayed in the same position, Remus almost cuddling him, and Severus with his head bowed and back slumped. Remus stayed quiet for the next few moments, unsure of how to answer his question.<br/>
“Why did you kiss me?” Was the only thing he retorted with and drew back to fetch his pack of cigarettes and the zippo from Severus’ fingers. He lit himself one and waited for a response.<br/>
“You are one of the only people to ever apologize. One of the only people to look me in the eyes and say they enjoy my company. I was stirring in my thoughts alone before you came, but you’re like a light. I enjoy your presence.” Severus had finally spoken up, as Remus moved closer to rest his head on his shoulder. There was a sort of calmness that fell over both of them. Severus lifted his hand that once had the lighter in it to tangle it in the Gryffindor’s hair.<br/>
“I kissed you back because I think you’re a gent.” Remus said soft, to which he got a chuckle out of snape.</p>
