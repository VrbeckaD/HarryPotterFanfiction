  <em>1976 - Summer</em>
</p>
<p>Sirius was three blocks away from Grimmauld Place when he realized he had no next step. In truth, he’d had no plan at all when he’d stood up at the dinner table to declare that he was finished being associated with the Black family. This, in itself, was not necessarily alarming. Sirius’ was a long life of jumping headlong into ideas that had no planning or structure behind them. But this idea was rather grander than anything he’d done before. Also, he typically had the backing of three other people in his wild schemes. Embarking on this one alone was new to him.</p>
<p>But he was confident that any impartial onlooker would agree he’d had no choice. Regulus had started it by asking him whether he was going to spend the summer with his blood traitor friends. This was pretty standard fare from Regulus since he’d started at Hogwarts, been sorted into Slytherin, and received more attention from their father than he ever had before. Sirius was constantly torn between feeling contempt for Regulus and simply feeling sorry for him.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m going to James’ place next month,” Sirius had responded, trying to keep his tone neutral. He’d learned that if he sounded too enthusiastic about something, his parents became extra motivated to keep it from him.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that will be possible this year, Sirius,” said his father.</p>
<p>Though his blood was boiling, Sirius kept a calm demeanor as he turned toward the head of the table. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“We’ve indulged you in this youthful rebellion long enough,” said his father. “But it’s time I start putting my foot down.”</p>
<p>“Oh, just now?” said Sirius, scoffing.</p>
<p>Mr. Black pounded the table with his fist, causing everyone’s flatware to bounce several inches into the air. “I will not be spoken to like that in my own home. While we’re at it, you’re going to get your hair cut tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“And it’s time you visited our tailor for your first proper set of formal robes.”</p>
<p>Sirius shook his head slightly to ruffle his hair, which he was absolutely not getting cut. “I’m sorry, but you couldn’t pay me enough to wear formal robes like the ones you wear every day.”</p>
<p>“Good, we won’t be paying you to do so,” said his father. His tone was calm, but Sirius could see the vein throbbing on his right temple. He’d spent his childhood trying to keep that vein from throbbing, but now he spent more time figuring out how to make it burst.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I won’t be doing any of that,” said Sirius. “I already have plans for tomorrow. They mainly involve listening to this great new album my friend Remus gave me, probably while wanking.”</p>
<p>“Filth!” shrieked his mother from the other end of the table. “Ever since you started at Hogwarts, all we hear from you is filth and depravity.”</p>
<p>“Oh, please,” said Sirius, sipping some more soup.</p>
<p>“We should have brought you home the moment we heard you’d been sorted into Gryffindor,” she continued. “Durmstrang would have sorted you out.”</p>
<p>“Right, a little training in bloodlust never hurt anyone,” said Sirius, calmly sipping a spoonful of his soup.</p>
<p>Sirius’ mother sneered at him. “Better that than cavorting with blood traitors and <em>queers</em>.”</p>
<p>Three years ago, this comment would have sent Sirius into a blinding rage. Three years ago he probably would have stormed away from the table, screaming at his parents about how they didn’t understand him and that they were close-minded assholes. Those were still the facts, but Sirius was finished fighting with them. He’d seen what fighting got him -- supper-less evenings spent in his room, torrents of verbal abuse, and several sound slaps on the face. Flying into hysterics only elicited an hysterical response from his parents. They’d be pissed no matter how he acted, so he chose to act calm.</p>
<p>Also, he wasn’t sure what made this the moment, but something snapped into place in Sirius’ brain, and he knew this was the time to come out to them.</p>
<p>Sirius had spent the previous year thinking and overthinking his sexuality. Everyone’s hormones were going wild, and for the first time Sirius interrogated why his own hormones hadn’t ever followed the trajectory that James’ hormones had. Granted, James was a weird bloke to use as a model, seeing as his hormones had made a beeline for Evans and never looked back. Still, it was somehow clear that James’ hormones never would have gone for Fabian Prewett. And Sirius had found himself staring at Fabian a fair few times without quite knowing why.</p>
<p>Plus, right after they’d returned from summer holidays last year, Remus had made a passing remark about liking men and women. He’d said it so casually, but Sirius saw the way his shoulders subtly relaxed when no one made a fuss about it. As soon as the idea of being attracted to men was mentioned aloud, Sirius realized he’d been attracted to men for years.</p>
<p>Then he’d had a dream about Remus kissing Marlene McKinnon and Fabian Prewett, which he was sure meant absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>In any case, the topic of sexuality had been everywhere during fifth year. Even Peter had snogged some girl during at a particularly rowdy post-Quidditch match party. Sirius had spent a year thinking things through, and now he was ready to act. As soon as he was back on the Hogwarts grounds, and as soon as he overcame his Victorian upbringing, Sirius was well and truly prepared to snog a boy in full view of Regulus and disappoint his parents. Though he adored the drama of this plan, his mother’s rude remark gave him the perfect opening to tell them himself.</p>
<p>Sirius carefully lifted his napkin from his lap, folded it twice, and placed it on the table. Then he stood up and leaned against the back of his chair, smiling to himself.</p>
<p>“Mother, I don’t know who you’re referencing. I’m the only queer in my group of friends.”</p>
<p>Sirius’ only regret was that he didn’t see their faces. He heard a gasp from his mother, a snarl of rage from his father, and something that sounded like “I knew it” from Regulus. Filled with adrenaline from his pronouncement, he marched right out of the dining room, through the foyer, and out of the big, foreboding door. The night air felt amazing, and he just kept walking until his lack of destination became apparent.</p>
<p>As Sirius made his way down the block, slowly realizing that he hadn’t taken any of his things with him, the way forward became clearer. This was mostly because he came upon King’s Cross Station.</p>
<p>Now all he had to do was come up with money for a ticket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**************</p>
</center><p>As a rule, James Potter was not averse to surprises. Surprises that involved his friends were particularly welcome. But, if asked, he would not deny being flabbergasted to find Sirius on his doorstep at such an early hour.</p>
<p>“Hiya, Prongs,” said Sirius, who seemed to be in high spirits despite his slightly bedraggled appearance. He was carrying a plastic bag and nothing else.</p>
<p>“Um, hello,” said James. “Did I fall asleep for a month, or did you decide to come early?”</p>
<p>“Decided to come early,” said Sirius, grinning. “Well, ‘decided’ is a really big word to use for this. I sort of stormed out of my house and had absolutely nowhere to go, so I’ve come here. I hope it’s not a bother. I hope your parents don’t hate me, because mine certainly do.”</p>
<p>James blinked at him. Something had to be wrong because Sirius only seemed this hyper and on edge when he was upset.</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said. “Slow down and come inside.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, it’s actually a bit nippy out here,” said Sirius, stepping past James and toeing off his trainers near the door.</p>
<p>James, still feeling half asleep and bewildered by Sirius’ sudden appearance, wandered into the living room, assuming Sirius would follow him. He plopped down on the couch and Sirius sat next to him, their thighs nearly touching.</p>
<p>After a moment, James said, “How did you even get here?”</p>
<p>Sirius’ eyes lit up. “Glad you asked. See, I was wandering down the street, nothing to my name, and that’s when I saw King’s Cross. And I thought to myself -- there are more destinations than Hogwarts inside that train station. The Muggles have got to go places as well.”</p>
<p>“Right, sure,” said James, suppressing a yawn. “But you said you had nothing. How did you--?”</p>
<p>“Buy a ticket?” Sirius interjected. “Yes, that was a tough one to get around. Even if I’d had a Galleon or two in my pocket, it wouldn’t have done me much good. Then I saw someone playing the guitar.”</p>
<p>James nodded. “Playing the…?”</p>
<p>“Buskers!” said Sirius, a bit too excitedly. “You know, those blokes who stand around and play music for money on the street corners. Maybe you don’t know because you live in the middle of bloody nowhere. Anyway, I found my own corner and started singing those Rolling Stones songs Remus played for us last year. Before I knew it, I had a few coins and even some of that funny paper money the Muggles use.”</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s...that’s actually quite smart.”</p>
<p>“Don’t sound so surprised,” said Sirius. “After I bought my ticket, I had some money leftover to buy all of these excellent Muggle sweets. Wait ‘till you try the Dairy Milk. It’s really quite something.”</p>
<p>Sirius began rummaging in his plastic bag, but James grabbed his arm to stop him.</p>
<p>“Padfoot, have you slept at all?”</p>
<p>“Not a wink,” said Sirius, setting his plastic bag down on the floor. “I really wanted to on the train, but I guess I was too worked up. Suppose that’s what happens when you tell your family you’re a big poof. Oh, by the way, I’m a big poof.”</p>
<p>Now James was fully awake. It wasn’t really the fact that Sirius was gay (he’d sort of had a sneaking suspicion), it was more the fact that Sirius had told his family he was gay.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s big,” said James. “Are they...what did they...you just left?”</p>
<p>Sirius nodded and shrugged, trying to look nonchalant. The manic look in his eye gave him away. “Why stick around when you know what’s going to happen, eh?</p>
<p>James studied his friend for a moment, trying to determine the best course of action. It was often difficult to tell what Sirius needed. Sometimes he came out and told you that he wanted to shoot fireworks off the Astronomy Tower or flood the Slytherin common room with gelatin. But other times he was more opaque. When this happened at Hogwarts, James typically took him to the kitchens, put him to bed, or waited until he was ready to talk. Sometimes he just guessed things and asked Sirius until he got it right.</p>
<p>Now, sitting in his own living room, with his parents fast asleep and Sirius here a month early, James was at a loss. But he saw Sirius’ red eyes and wobbly smile and figured the kid just needed some sleep.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he said, nodding toward the stairs.</p>
<p>Sirius grabbed his plastic bag and followed James up to his bedroom. By the time they reached the landing, Sirius was a changed man -- the frenetic energy was gone and his whole body had succumbed to his obvious fatigue. Sometimes, when they were just back from summer holidays, Sirius seemed to need permission to calm down again. James had never met Mr. and Mrs. Black, but if he ever had the misfortune, he was sure he’d hex them without a second thought.</p>
<p>Once James had conjured up a second, slightly smaller bed next to his own, Sirius collapsed onto it and sighed softly.</p>
<p>“Thanks, mate,” he said. Even his voice sounded tired now. “For everything, not just for the bed. I mean, you didn’t have to ask me in. I’m a whole month early. I’m an imposition.”</p>
<p>“Sirius, shut up,” said James. “Just get some sleep.”</p>
<p>Sirius nodded, laid down, and was snoring in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The next morning, James awoke to find Sirius sitting hunched on his bed, his knees pulled up to his chin. He was staring off into the middle distance and jumped when James touched his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean to...are you okay?”</p>
<p>Sirius gave him a sad look. “I left everything behind. I didn’t think to take anything.”</p>
<p>James didn’t know what to say. He didn’t have any idea what Sirius was going through, so it wasn’t as though he could honestly commiserate. Instead he simply sat down next to him and waited until he was ready to talk about it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*************</p>
</center><p>Once Fleamont and Euphemia Potter knew that Sirius was in their house, the hospitality train was full steam ahead. Admittedly, they did this for any guest who entered their home, but they always made an extra effort when that guest was Sirius Black.</p>
<p>When Sirius excused himself to use the loo, James raced downstairs to inform his parents about their surprise guest.</p>
<p>“I thought he wasn’t coming for another month,” said Fleamont, setting down his <em>Daily Prophet</em>. “Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Erm, yeah,” said James. “He had sort of a fight with his parents, and I guess he ran away.”</p>
<p>Euphemia frowned the tight frown she reserved for talk of Sirius’ parents. “It’s no matter. If Sirius doesn’t feel welcome at home, he’s more than welcome here.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, mum,” said James. He turned to run back upstairs, then swiveled around and looked at his calm, understanding parents. “Thanks for being so great, both of you.”</p>
<p>By the time James came downstairs again, this time accompanied by Sirius, a stack of blueberry pancakes -- Sirius’ favorite -- had appeared on the table.</p>
<p>“Hallo, Sirius,” said Fleamont, setting down his paper again. “Glad to have you with us.”</p>
<p>“The water’s just gone for tea,” said Euphemia. “I’ve got a new tin of that chamomile that you like so much.”</p>
<p>James looked to Sirius and was pleased to find him smiling and not seeming at all on edge.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Potter,” said Sirius. “I’m really very sorry to have shown up like this, early and unannounced. You’re too kind for letting me stay.”</p>
<p>“It’s no trouble at all,” Euphemia insisted. “It’s a pleasure to have you stay with us. We were expecting you anyway! What’s a few weeks, eh?”</p>
<p>Sirius nodded, clearly at a loss for words. James nudged him and Sirius took a seat at the kitchen table, pulling the plate of pancakes toward himself. Sirius’ parents were not mentioned once throughout breakfast. It seemed that with each pancake, with each moment of normal conversation, the tension in Sirius’ shoulders lessened more and more.</p>
<p>Later in the day, James sent urgent owls to Remus and Peter. The family owl went to Peter, and just as James was sending off his own tawny owl to Remus, a pompous-looking great owl swooped in and landed beside him on the window sill. He didn’t recognize the owl, but he recognized the Black family crest pressed into the wax that sealed the letter in its talons.</p>
<p>James took the letter from the great owl and fixed it with a disdainful stare. The owl stared back for a moment, then flapped its large wings and flew away across the countryside. James was left contemplating the letter. The last thing he wanted to do was cause Sirius more grief, especially now that he was relaxing. But maybe it was better to give him the letter now, let him process whatever it said, and enjoy the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>Sirius was sitting on the floor of James’ bedroom, with David Bowie’s <em>Station to Station</em> spinning on the turntable. As soon as Remus had introduced them all to records and Muggle music, James had asked for a turntable for Christmas. Though his parents were slightly baffled by the technology, they obliged their son and tolerated his love of Bowie, the Beatles, and many others.</p>
<p>“It’s weird, but it’s good,” Sirius remarked when James came in. “But you know me, I miss Ziggy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, he hasn’t been Ziggy for years,” said James, plopping down next to his friend.</p>
<p>“More’s the pity,” said Sirius. “What’ve you got there?”</p>
<p>“I sent owls to Remus and Peter,” said James, stalling. “I thought I’d have to wait to have you all here until later in the summer, this is excellent.”</p>
<p>“What’s the letter?” said Sirius.</p>
<p>James sighed. “Right. So, don’t get upset. I mean, I don’t want to tell you how to feel. You can feel however you want, mate. You can scream or whatever you need to do. Hmph. Let me start again.”</p>
<p>“It’s from my parents, isn’t it?” said Sirius, his face suddenly blank.</p>
<p>James hesitated, then presented the letter to him. Sirius took a deep breath, then ripped open the letter and read it, all the while maintaining that blank expression. When he was finished, he flung the letter across the room and massaged his temples.</p>
<p>“What did it say?” James asked, hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Nothing. It’s fine,” said Sirius. “I’m just disowned, that’s all.”</p>
<p>James said nothing. What could you say when your best friend had just been disowned by his family? In truth, he could think of a few choice words, but Sirius hated it when people were angry on his behalf. So he sat beside Sirius, listening to David Bowie singing “TVC 15.” He liked this track, but he also missed Ziggy Stardust. Perhaps he’d put that record on next. That might cheer Sirius up.</p>
<p>“Fuck them,” said Sirius, suddenly. “Fuck them and everything they stand for. I never wanted to be a part of their world anyway, so it’s better that they make it this official.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said James. “Fuck them,”</p>
<p>They were quiet until the record ended. James turned to him to suggest putting on some Ziggy, but Sirius spoke first.</p>
<p>“One thing’s for sure,” he said, with a sardonic smile. “I definitely can’t go back and get my things.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**************</p>
</center><p>“Peacocks,” said Sirius. “Honest to God, peacocks. Just strutting about the grounds. And, and fucking dress robes for everyday, some for dinner, and some for occasions even more special than dinner. Good riddance to bad rubbish, that’s all I can say.”</p>
<p>“Yup,” said James, passing Sirius the bottle of firewhisky they were sharing.</p>
<p>After dismissing the letter, Sirius had gone very quiet and pensive. They’d had dinner with James’ parents and Sirius had mostly pushed his food around his plate. Then they’d gone back to James’ room and Sirius sat staring out the window. For a while, James had felt lost again, not knowing what to do for Sirius. Luckily, this turned out to be one of those times when Sirius made himself perfectly clear. After Mr. and Mrs. Potter turned in for the night, Sirius had simply said, “Let’s get drunk.”</p>
<p>Now they were sitting on the roof of the Potters’ house, which was conveniently accessible by James’ bedroom window. They’d spent many a summer night out here, more recently with the company of certain illicit substances. On this particular occasion, James had nabbed a bottle of firewhisky from his parents’ liquor cabinet.</p>
<p>“You know me,” said Sirius, taking a long drink of the firewhisky. “I was gonna get out as soon as I could anyway. I’m...I’m just glad that I ran out on them first, and then they disowned me. You know? It’s like breaking up with someone before they can break up with you.”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm,” said James, staring out at the vast darkness. He kept thinking about how he would feel if his parents disowned him. Of course, he and Sirius were in very different situations. He knew that. But Sirius was putting up such a defensive front that he wondered if there wasn’t some kernel of sadness inside it all.</p>
<p>“It’s okay to feel a bit bad about this, too,” he said. “I mean, sure, they were complete arseholes, but they were also your family.”</p>
<p>“Only in blood,” said Sirius, grimly. “The wanker who said that blood was thicker than water must have had much nicer blood.”</p>
<p>James took a swig from the bottle. “What about Regulus?”</p>
<p>Sirius snorted. “What about him?”</p>
<p>“Kind of a shame, innit? Him stuck there with your parents, all on his own.”</p>
<p>Perhaps Sirius hadn’t yet considered this. He was quiet for a moment, then grabbed the bottle from James and drained it of the remaining firewhisky. Then he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said, “He chose his side a while ago.”</p>
<p>The quiet reigned again, intruded upon only by the nature sounds that surrounded the Potters’ house. The summer evening had a pleasant chill to it, but James knew it would soon get too cold and they’d have to clamber back inside.</p>
<p>“So anyway, it’s fine,” said Sirius. “I’m gonna spend this year snogging as many blokes as I can. Time to sow my wild oats while I’m still young, eh?”</p>
<p>“Right,” said James.</p>
<p>“I know you’re not one for the wild oats approach,” said Sirius. “I mean, that is, if you’re still stuck on Evans.”</p>
<p>“I’m not <em>stuck on her</em>, honestly,” said James, rolling his eyes and chewing at his thumb. “I’m in love with her, I’ve told you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t know what love is,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“And you do?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. None of us does,” said Sirius. “Thus, the wild oats. Pity about the firewhisky being gone.”</p>
<p>“Can I ask how you knew? A-about being gay?” said James. Then he quickly added, “And please tell me if I’m being an unmitigated ass by asking this. I’m just curious.”</p>
<p>Sirius shook his head. “Nah, it’s fine. I’ve probably known for a really long time? But I started thinking about it last year when Remus told us about...you know, how he likes birds and blokes.”</p>
<p>“Ahh,” said James. “Because you fancy him.”</p>
<p>Sirius spluttered incoherently for ten full seconds before making sense again. “I...I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>“You fancy Remus,” said James. He said it so matter-of-factly that Sirius actually wondered whether he’d said something in a drunken stupor or in his sleep.</p>
<p>“Er, I have to disagree,” he said, snorting incredulously. “You know, seeing as I’m me, so I should know my own bloody feelings.”</p>
<p>“Please,” said James. “The two of you have that, that banter all the time. And I know this sounds stupid and you’re just gonna say I’m drunk, but...you’re a dog and he’s a wolf. It’s got to mean something that that’s your animagus form.”</p>
<p>Sirius rolled his eyes and held up his fingers to count James’ points. “So we’ve got banter and some kind of weird animal magnetism. Yes. You’ve made your case. Clearly, I fancy Remus.”</p>
<p>James groaned and flopped all over Sirius, as he was wont to do when drunk. “I know it sounds stupid. But that’s just because I’m drunk and you’re drunk, so everything sounds drunk.</p>
<p>“You must be astronomically drunk to think that I fancy Remus,” said Sirius. “I’ve never heard anything so stupid…”</p>
<p>There was a line from some Muggle play about protesting too much, but James’ brain couldn’t quite make the connection because the firewhisky was running interference on his synapses. All he knew was what he saw, and he’d definitely seen Remus and Sirius flirting. Sure, they might not see it, but James was an expert at detecting flirtation. He was waiting for the day when he detected flirtation in Lily’s attitude toward him, but that day had not yet come.</p>
<p>After that, the conversation tended toward finding rude shapes in the stars and wondering after more liquor somewhere in the house. Eventually they both stumbled through James’ bedroom window and fell asleep, blissfully unaware of how dreadful they would feel in the morning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**************</p>
</center><p>Remus was sitting at his bedroom window when James’ owl arrived. It was just four days after the full moon, and he was finally feeling more like himself again. At Hogwarts, he was always eager to get back to his schoolwork after the full moon. But when he was home for the summer, he liked to take his time getting back to normal. After the full moon, he often spent entire days in bed, paying attention to what his body was telling him. Usually it was bad news. This time around he’d scratched up his arms something fierce and was wearing bandages until they healed.</p>
<p>James’ owl was stereotypically dramatic. The small scroll of paper that had been tied to his owl’s leg simply read: <em>Sirius in crisis. A boy needs his friends at a time like this.</em></p>
<p>Truth be told, Remus was slightly alarmed by the lack of exclamation points in James’ message. If this had been a “crisis” akin to the Very Bad Flea Situation of last Christmas, or even the Disastrous Haircut of ‘74, there would have been more exclamation points. But James had eschewed his favorite punctuation mark here, and that made Remus worry that something really was wrong.</p>
<p>Of course Remus had immediately sent back a message telling James he’d be there as soon as he could. The plan for the summer had included eventually congregating at James’ place anyway, so his parents weren’t much bothered by his early departure.</p>
<p>“I know I don’t have to tell you this,” said his mother. “But mind yourself at the moon next month.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded. “The Potters have got a cellar that I can use. James set it up for just this situation last summer.”</p>
<p>“His parents know?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course,” said Remus. “You’d be surprised at how understanding the Potters are.”</p>
<p>Though Remus said all of this casually and without so much as a twitch of his eye, it was all patently false. He had no idea if the Potters had a cellar, but even if they did it certainly wasn’t kitted out for a werewolf to transform. Although James’ parents were, indeed, understanding, they had all agreed it was best to omit the truth of Remus’ condition. At first Remus had been embarrassed for them to know, but now mentioning it might have lead more easily to a conversation about their son and two of his friends being illegal Animagi. Yes, some things were best left hidden.</p>
<p>Remus’ parents were protective of him, but their barriers had been lowered slightly since Remus had gone to Hogwarts and found himself three amazing friends. Especially since those friends had shown they could be trusted with Remus’ most important secret. Even so, all previous trips to James’ house had been coordinated around the full moon. Perhaps they now trusted him to be careful, and perhaps they too worried about what Sirius might be up to.</p>
<p>Two days after James’ owl had landed on his window, Remus was standing at his parents’ fireplace with a handful of Floo powder and a rucksack over his shoulder. He promised that he would be back to get his school things and to let his parents take him to King’s Cross.</p>
<p>“There are only a few more times we can do that, you know,” said his mother.</p>
<p>“I know, mum,” said Remus. “I’ll be back, honest.”</p>
<p>This was absolutely the truth. Remus knew how important it was for his parents to take him to the train at the beginning of each term. For a while they’d assumed that Remus wouldn’t be attending Hogwarts at all. Somehow the novelty of ferrying him off to school hadn’t worn off. He would just have to steer them clear of the Potters, lest they ask about their werewolf-proof cellar.</p>
<p>With a quick puff of Floo powder and a dizzying sensation that Remus would be glad to say goodbye to when he got his apparition license, he was standing in the Potters’ living room. Seconds later, James and Sirius rushed in to greet him. In the old days, a greeting from his friends probably would have knocked Remus to the ground. But they were all growing up, it seemed. Or perhaps something was <em>truly</em> wrong with Sirius.</p>
<p>“Hiya, Moony,” said James, grinning and ruffling his own hair. “Thanks for coming.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Remus, shrugging. “Your message mentioned a crisis, so I figured I’d better be quick about it. Now, who’s got the bad haircut?”</p>
<p>He’d hoped for a chuckle, if not a raucous peal of laughter. What he got instead was James looking uncomfortable and Sirius rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>“Crisis? You said it was a <em>crisis</em>?” he said, glaring at James. “Fucking hell, I’ve only been disowned.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Remus. He didn’t know what he’d been expecting, but it wasn’t that. “Oh.”</p>
<p>“Quit standing there staring at me like that,” Sirius barked at him.</p>
<p>Remus let the rucksack slip from his shoulder down to the floor, and then immediately regretted it. Some small part of him wanted to hug Sirius, but he wasn’t sure if the occasion called for it. Now he was left with his hands hanging stupidly by his sides. He stuck them deep into his pockets and tried to appear casual.</p>
<p>“So, what else is new?”</p>
<p>Roughly twenty minutes after Remus arrived, Peter came stumbling out of the fireplace.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” he said, brushing soot out of his dirty blonde hair. “What’s the crisis? Is it fleas again? Because I don’t think I can handle that.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been disowned,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“Blimey,” said Peter, looking legitimately shocked. “Why would they do that?”</p>
<p>“Yes” said Remus. “Would you please just tell us? I’ve been sitting here struggling to think of small talk and it’s killing me.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Sirius. “Well, I came out to my parents, and then I stormed out of their house. I guess that was the last straw because they sent me the big disowning letter soon after.”</p>
<p>Sirius glossed over the big news so casually that Remus actually almost missed it. When his brain rewinded the scene for him and played it back, there it was. Sirius had come out.</p>
<p>“So, you’re…” he said, trailing off, not wanting to make any assumptions.</p>
<p>“As gay as the day is long,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“Oh, not you as well,” said Peter.</p>
<p>“Wormtail!” said James, smacking him on the arm.</p>
<p>“What?” said Peter, rubbing his arm. “Moony already came out last year. Are you next?”</p>
<p>James shrugged. “Who knows? I contain multitudes. Only time will tell.”</p>
<p>“Please, you only have eyes for Evans,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“That’s only my eyes. Who knows what the other parts of me think?”</p>
<p>“Please,” said Remus. “Don’t make me think about your genitalia having independent thought, I beg of you. Sirius -- what did your parents say?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t stick around long enough to hear anything,” said Sirius. “And hopefully I won’t hear anything from them ever again. All I know is that I’m disowned, I can’t return to their house, and I can no longer enjoy the so-called perks of being in the Black family.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Remus. “In a way, I suppose this was a long time coming.”</p>
<p>“And you never liked them anyway,” said Peter.</p>
<p>Sirius frowned at them, arms crossed over his chest. “I don’t know why everyone thinks they need to make me feel better about this. I hated them, they hated me, and now we’ve parted ways. End of story.”</p>
<p>Remus caught James’ eye, and he sort of shrugged at him. Their silent friend language was nowhere near as advanced as what James had with Sirius, but they could generally communicate when it came to Sirius’ well being. Remus raised his eyebrows and James nodded with a slight smile. It seemed as though James had been taking care of him while he was here, and now Sirius was doing better.</p>
<p>“What the fuck happened to your arm?” said Sirius, very suddenly.</p>
<p>“Last full moon,” said Remus.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Sirius. “Shit.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” said Remus, wishing he’d worn a sweater. “I’ll be here for the next one, so it won’t be as bad.”</p>
<p>“That’s right! Oh my God, Prongs, I’m suddenly very glad that you live in the arsecrack of nowhere,” said Sirius. “We’re gonna have so much fun.”</p>
<p>“It’ll certainly be more bearable,” said Remus, though he wasn’t willing to use the word <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>“I know several people who would hit you for calling Devonshire the <em>arsecrack of nowhere</em>,” said James, looking peeved.</p>
<p>“I call ‘em as I see ‘em,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was fairly normal. The Potters greeted Remus and Peter, they had all had a magnificently large lunch, and then they cavorted around the vast expanse of the Potters’ property. And no one mentioned that Sirius was gay. On one hand, it was good that no one felt the need to make a huge deal out of the declaration -- not even Peter. On the other hand, it was all that Remus could think about, and that made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In fact, the amount of time he spent thinking about Sirius or thinking about things that Sirius did had been making him uncomfortable for some time. If he was honest with himself, this discomfort was partly what lead him to realize that he was bisexual. But he was rarely honest with himself, so this thought got pushed deep into his brain, somewhere between the memories of seeing Peter naked and watching James dance. But this new piece of information was calling up those thoughts, and being around Sirius was making it hard to ignore.</p>
<p>By the time they were all turning in for the night, or at least settling into James’ bedroom, the subject had not been broached. As James and Sirius traded barbs about something or other, and James conjured up two more beds, Remus ruminated on the upcoming term might be different now that Sirius was out. Sirius was gorgeous. Outside of anything Remus might have felt about him, Sirius was objectively gorgeous. Once the news was out, the queer blokes at Hogwarts would be tripping over themselves to have a go at Sirius.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if four beds will fit in here, if I’m honest,” said James, rubbing the back of his neck.</p>
<p>“Maybe we could double up,” said Sirius, grinning. “I call dibs on Moony.”</p>
<p>Remus had to concentrate very hard indeed to keep his expression blank. There was perhaps a split second in which his eyes widened, and then he composed himself and smiled wryly at Sirius.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’ll be necessary.” He stepped in front of James and waved his wand, resizing the three beds that James had conjured up and conjuring a fourth one of the same size.</p>
<p>“Brilliant,” said Peter.</p>
<p>“Standard spellwork,” said Remus. “Shall we get to bed?”</p>
<p>Though Remus was still quite tired from the full moon, he forced himself to stay awake until at least two o’clock, at which time he could no longer hold his head up. He suspected that his friends fell asleep some time around four, which is when he was partially woken up by someone pulling a blanket on top of him. Through the sleepy slits of his eyes, he thought he could make out Sirius’ black hair falling over his face as he leaned down to pull the blanket.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***************</p>
</center><p>When he awoke around eight o’clock the next morning, Remus cursed his inner clock. This was why he spent most of the school term sleepless. He stayed up late with his friends and woke early as a matter of habit. The only time he got truly restful sleep, ironically, was after the full moon when he was so knackered he couldn’t stay awake if he tried. He rolled onto his back and flung his arm over his eyes, trying to block out the morning sun. It was no use, and nature came calling soon enough, so he got out of bed and stumbled his way to the loo.</p>
<p>When he emerged moments later, a morning that had been calm so far was disrupted by the same thing that disrupted all his mornings: Sirius Black.</p>
<p>“Hey, Moony.”</p>
<p>“<em>Jesus Christ</em>,” he hissed angrily, jumping back and narrowly avoiding toppling backward down the Potters’ staircase. Now he was awake.</p>
<p>As he gulped air, trying to calm his wildly beating heart, Remus noticed Sirius. He was standing beside the doorway to the loo, practically blending in to the shadows that streaked the hallway.</p>
<p>“Make yourself a little less visible next time,” said Remus, a hand on his chest.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” said Sirius. “I saw you weren’t in your bed, and I wanted to catch you before you got back. Can we have a chat?”</p>
<p>Midday Remus might have found an excuse to say no. Evening Remus would have said yes but been on guard for questionable chat topics. Morning Remus, however, was still too new to the day to know better.</p>
<p>“Sure, why not?” he said through a yawn. “Let’s make some tea first, though.”</p>
<p>James’ parents were already awake, because of course they were. Remus and Sirius made polite conversation with them about how their son was never awake before noon and how it was so exciting to have a full house this early in the summer. Mrs. Potter poured them each a cup of tea -- Earl Grey for Remus, and some absurd berry concoction for Sirius. Remus took care not to confuse their mugs as he carried them out to the back garden.</p>
<p>“I love summer mornings,” said Sirius, settling down on the grass. Remus could see that there was still dew on the ground, but he didn’t want to be a bother. So he sighed and sat down next to him.</p>
<p>“Much nicer than winter mornings,” he agreed, taking a sip of his tea. It was far too hot to drink, but he loved the way the warmth spread down his throat.</p>
<p>It might have been nice to just sit there, drinking their tea and drinking in the morning sun, but Sirius seemed eager to talk.</p>
<p>“So, listen, it was sort of you that got me thinking about being gay and whatnot,” he said, diving right in.</p>
<p>“Oh?” said Remus. He held his mug of tea close to his face, breathing in the Earl Grey scent.</p>
<p>Sirius nodded. “At the start of last term, when you told us about yourself. I mean, that made me start thinking about my own shit. It put me in the right headspace.”</p>
<p>“Glad I could help,” said Remus, still unsure of where this was heading.</p>
<p>“And James said something so stupid the other day,” Sirius continued. “Because I told him this too, and he said it was because I fancied you or something.”</p>
<p>Remus was deeply grateful he hadn’t been taking a sip of tea just then. All the same, he knew that he froze for a split second in shock. He brushed it off and composed himself almost immediately, but he knew Sirius must have seen that. That was the whole point of this little chat: to catch Remus off guard. He should have known better. Morning Remus was a pillock.</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous,” said Remus, chuckling a bit for good measure. Even if Sirius had found him out, he had to try. “I mean, you know you’ve got your pick of the lot at Hogwarts. I was just thinking about this -- there are at least three guys who would kill just to snog you once.”</p>
<p>Sirius actually looked taken aback by this news. “There are?”</p>
<p>What he wanted to say was, <em>How are you that gorgeous and you don’t even know it?</em> What he actually said was, “Honestly, there are. I could introduce you once we get back.”</p>
<p>Sirius’ expression was unreadable. He smiled in a sort of noncommittal way and nodded to Remus, still genuinely surprised by this.</p>
<p>As they sat drinking their tea, Remus’ thoughts went on a tear through his brain. It was at times like these when he wished he was more like James. James never seemed to think about what he said. Sometimes this got him into trouble (usually with Lily), but sometimes it served him well because there were situations in which talking was more important than thinking. Remus knew this as an empirical fact, but he couldn’t make his brain realize it. So instead of asking follow-up questions or getting straight to the point with Sirius, he sat beside him in the wet grass and felt the pleasant morning heat up into a summer’s day.</p>

<p></p><center>
  <p>***************</p>
</center><p>Sirius had seen it. Remus was always so good at hiding his emotions, but if you knew where to look you could find them. When he’d mentioned James’ suspicion, Remus had paused. It was one of the pauses you could practically hear. He’d actually been blowing on his tea to cool it and had stopped. To Sirius, that seemed like an affirmative answer to the question he’d been secretly asking.</p>
<p>And now he was well and truly fucked. Now he had some indication that Remus would be interested as well.</p>
<p>When James had brought it up, Sirius had brushed it off as ridiculous. He had to. In truth, he’d always felt <em>something</em> toward Remus, and that <em>something</em> looked different in light of his sexual awakening. Remus always seemed so annoyed with him that he’d assumed he’d never be interested. But then James had mentioned their banter and Sirius thought he’d better do some more stealth research. Lucky for him, he knew all about Morning Remus.</p>
<p>It was two more days before he did anything more about these developments. He didn’t want to rush things, and he figured Remus might be expecting something after their conversation. So he laid low, playing it cool and insisting they do things as a group. They played some two-a-side Quidditch despite Remus and Peter’s protests. They went walking around the countryside with no particular goal in mind. In general, they did everything you could possibly do to waste a summer.</p>
<p>“What a glorious waste of a summer,” James said the next morning, stretching his arms above his head and grinning.</p>
<p>“I have to agree,” said Remus, who was lying on the grass beside him, reading a book.</p>
<p>“Please, you’re reading,” said Sirius. “That’s not a waste of a summer.”</p>
<p>“It’s not required reading,” Remus retorted, staring resolutely at the book.</p>
<p>“It’s homework-adjacent,” said Sirius. “You can’t even enjoy your summer holidays without being a swot.”</p>
<p>Remus sighed and pushed himself up onto his elbows, one finger holding his place in the book. “Enjoying reading does not make me a swot.”</p>
<p>“Fine, but it makes you a bloody bore sometimes,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“Oh?” said Remus. “What, pray tell, is your idea of excitement? Because I’ll tell you that being on a Quidditch team with Peter, and playing against you two, is not my idea of excitement. No offense, Pete.”</p>
<p>“None taken,” said Peter, from his spot in the grass.</p>
<p>Sirius studied him for a moment. God, he loved the way Remus’ eyebrows looked when he got cross with him. This was such a stupid, silly thing to think, and Sirius hated himself for thinking it, but the floodgates had been opened. Now he might have a chance. Now he had permission to be this sappy and ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Come on, then,” he said, grabbing Remus’ arm and trying to haul him up. “Let’s go for a walk.”</p>
<p>“That’s not exactly my idea of excitement either,” said Remus, frowning.</p>
<p>“Oh, go on already,” said James. “I’d rather you took a walk than sat around here arguing.”</p>
<p>Sirius looked at James, but he wouldn’t meet his eye. He turned his focus back to hauling Remus up from his spot on the grass. Remus was resistant at first, but eventually he gave in, standing up and brushing off his trousers.</p>
<p>“Let’s head this way,” he said, pointing toward a copse of trees on the horizon.</p>
<p>Sirius smiled to himself. This was a familiar pattern -- Remus often put up a fight about certain pranks, only to offer a suggestion that would make a prank ten times better. In the same way, he often protested when Sirius suggested they study together in the library or walk down to the lake while James and Peter were otherwise occupied. Though he was initially annoyed by the intrusion into whatever boring thing he was doing, he always ended up going along.</p>
<p>As they left the garden, Sirius glanced back and saw James give him a casual salute. He should have known that James would’ve been able to tell what he was doing. Though James would undoubtedly tease him about this later, Sirius was grateful for the help. And at least Peter remained blissfully unaware, tapping his bare toes to a tune only he could hear. Bless him, at least he enjoyed himself.</p>
<p>The sun was shining, and it was such a pleasantly warm day that Sirius actually questioned whether they were still in England. It was so warm that Remus had again left his usual cardigan inside. Sirius had to stop himself staring at the bandages on Remus’ right arm. Every time he noticed them he wondered how bad the last moon had been. At least Remus would be here for the next one. They’d make sure he didn’t worsen those wounds this month.</p>
<p>“Want to tell me that I’ve inspired you to care more about your schoolwork?” said Remus. “If I can make you rethink your sexuality, perhaps I’d better put my powers to better use.”</p>
<p>Sirius snorted and shook his head. “I don’t think your powers are quite that strong. I’ll just continue relying on my own innate brilliance, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, indeed,” said Remus, smirking at him.</p>
<p>They were almost past the boundaries of the Potters’ property when an owl came swooping toward them. Sirius expected it to fly right past them and head to the Potters’ house. Instead, it flew straight at them and landed on the grass so it couldn’t be avoided.</p>
<p>Remus looked at the owl, and then at Sirius. “Well, it must be for you. That owl looks far too expensive to be for me.”</p>
<p>Sirius had been thinking the same thing but hoping that it wasn’t true. He stared down at the owl, who stared resolutely back at him before sticking out his leg and turning his head away. Clearly, he wanted Sirius to take the message so he could be on his way.</p>
<p>“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” said Remus, after the standoff had lasted at least a full minute. He bent down, took the message, and patted the owl on its head. Its mission complete, the owl flew away across the empty fields. Remus turned and handed the small scroll to Sirius.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I want it,” said Sirius, folding his arms over his chest.</p>
<p>“Er, okay,” said Remus. He sort of moved his wrist, as though he was going to chuck the scroll into the grass, but then thought better of it. “Perhaps...should I read it?”</p>
<p>Sirius shrugged his shoulders and walked a few feet away from Remus. He dragged his hands through his hair, looked up at the sky, and then glanced over his shoulder at Remus. His head was bent down as he studied the scroll, his bottom lip between his teeth. Suddenly he looked up and Sirius looked away, dreading what would come next.</p>
<p>“I think you’d better read this,” said Remus, his hand on Sirius’ shoulder.</p>
<p>Sirius turned to face Remus and saw that he wasn’t frowning. If it had been another nasty letter, surely Remus wouldn’t be saying that he should read it. Sirius took a deep breath and took the letter from Remus. The small scroll of paper read:</p>
<p>
  <em>My dear nephew, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I’ve just heard what Walburga has done and I am appalled at her cruelty. Not surprised, per se, but certainly appalled. Please know that I’m willing to help you in any way that I can. When I leave this earthly realm, you can expect to receive an inheritance from me, even though you will no longer receive one from your parents. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Your uncle,<br/>
Alphard</em>
</p>
<p>At first, Sirius didn’t know how to feel about the letter. But something inside him must have known, because -- to his surprise -- a tear appeared on the scroll, blurring Alphard’s name. He wiped at his face and turned away from Remus, embarrassed and surprised by the sudden tears. But then he couldn’t seem to stop them, and his shoulders began to shake, and he couldn’t wipe away the tears fast enough because they were simply replaced by more. Dimly, as though it were happening to someone else, he felt Remus’ arm across his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Oh, Sirius,” he said in a solemn tone. “It’s alright to cry. I know you meant what you said earlier about not liking your parents and not wanting to be a part of their world, but we all want acceptance.”</p>
<p>“I have you, and James, and Peter,” said Sirius, his words garbled through the sobs. “Why should I need anything else?”</p>
<p>“There’s something special about family, I suppose, and about blood,” said Remus. “I don’t know how I would feel in your situation because it hasn’t happened to me. But I do know that I’m grateful to my parents for sticking by me after I was bitten. They could have easily put me in an institution rather than deal with my situation.”</p>
<p>“They would never,” said Sirius, wiping at his eyes.</p>
<p>“They could have,” said Remus. “It was a choice they made. In any case, it seems your Uncle Alphard has made a choice of his own.”</p>
<p>“He’ll be disowned next,” said Sirius, calming down a bit now. “They’ll blast him off that damned tapestry. Holy shit, I forgot about the tapestry. I’m probably nothing more than a burnt circle of fabric now.”</p>
<p>“That tapestry is horrid,” said Remus.</p>
<p>“You’ve never seen it.”</p>
<p>“All the same, I know that it’s horrid.”</p>
<p>Sirius sniffled and wiped away the last few tears. He glanced at Remus and he finally noticed just how close they were. Remus’ face was mere inches from his, and suddenly Sirius felt shy. He turned away, knowing that this wasn’t the right moment. In fact, the letter had thrown everything off, and he wasn’t in the mood for a romantic stroll.</p>
<p>“Feeling better?” said Remus, moving his arm away at last.</p>
<p>Sirius nodded. “But I don’t know if I feel like a walk anymore.”</p>
<p>“Come on, then,” said Remus. “Maybe it’ll clear your head. Besides, you dragged me out here and I won’t have it be for nothing.”</p>
<p>Remus was smirking at him, and Sirius couldn’t help but smile back. He took a deep, bracing breath and rubbed vigorously at his sore eyes.</p>
<p>“Very well, if you insist on being in my presence,” he said, summoning the bravado.</p>
<p>Sirius hadn’t had a destination in mind anyway, so he was happy to follow Remus’ wanderings over hill and dale. Remus had such long legs that Sirius often had to hurry to keep up with him, and the dog jokes were just too easy to make. Sirius was a good sport about the jokes, but when Remus picked up a stick and tossed it off into the distance, Sirius had to whack him on the arm.</p>
<p>“I’d say something about canines being sensitive,” said Remus, rubbing his arm. “But I’d be insulting myself as well, wouldn’t I?”</p>
<p>After a while, they came to a small pond surrounded by tall grass. Remus said he was tired and sat down on a large rock near the edge of the pond. Sirius clambered up beside him, and when he got there, he was rewarded with a view of the fields they’d just traversed. The Potters’ home was still visible in the distance, but only just. Beside him sat Remus, his best friend after James, and someone who was willing to take walks with him to clear his head after receiving startling family news.</p>
<p>Was that all this was? Was it simply friendly affection that he was mistaking for something else? Had he been too hasty in jumping to conclusions because he’d come out and James was making jokes about them?</p>
<p>Suddenly, without moving his head, Remus’ gaze shifted to Sirius. Sirius’ heart leapt in an exciting and terrible way, and he looked back toward the Potters’ house.</p>
<p>“What?” said Remus.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Nothing.”</p>
<p>“You were staring.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>Yes, he was. And he was well and truly fucked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**************</p>
</center><p>The air was filled with a new electricity that made Remus’ bones tingly. He hadn’t yet worked out whether the tingling was good or bad. All he knew was that some new current ran between him and Sirius ever since their walk out to the pond. He’d always felt something there, but this seemed more serious. It hadn’t come from their typical back-and-forth, but instead from an honest conversation about feelings, of all things. Sirius had even <em>cried</em>. It was frightening. Again, he was in the position of needing to talk about something and not knowing where to turn. Eventually he got desperate and turned to Peter.</p>
<p>One night, James and Sirius were arguing about broomsticks, and neither Remus nor Peter cared much whether the new Cleansweep was better than other brooms on the market. So they were sitting together on the grass, and Remus decided to set his book down and poke Peter in the arm.</p>
<p>“Huh?” said Peter, tearing himself away from the argument taking place. Unlike Remus, Peter still found it entertaining to swing his head back and forth between James and Sirius, as though he were watching a tennis match.</p>
<p>“What would you do if you were suddenly attracted to a good friend of yours?” said Remus. Past conversations had taught him that beating around the bush did you no good when talking to Peter. No matter how embarrassing, it was better just to cut to the chase.</p>
<p>Peter gave him a small, almost pitying smile. “Moony, I’m glad you’ve figured things out about yourself and all, and I’m flattered, but you know I prefer the ladies.”</p>
<p>Remus shook his head and silently prayed for strength. “I wasn’t talking about you, Pete. And this is just a hypothetical. Imagine that you were really good friends with a girl, for several years, and then you realized you had romantic feelings for her. What would you do?”</p>
<p>Peter considered this for a few long seconds, then said, “I’d probably ask her out.”</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t that be awkward?” said Remus. “I mean, what if she said no? Or worse, what if she said yes? And then you went out on a date and it was catastrophic? And suddenly your entire group of friends had imploded before your very eyes?”</p>
<p>Peter stared at him. “Well, obviously that would be very bad.”</p>
<p>“Right. Of course it would,” said Remus. “But shouldn’t it be worth the risk? I mean to say, things could work out swimmingly, and you might gain an amazing romantic relationship from it all.”</p>
<p>“I...suppose that’s true.”</p>
<p>“There’s just so much at stake. I mean, these friendships are really important to you, hypothetically. And you’d hate to do anything that might jeopardize them. What if it all went wrong and people took sides?”</p>
<p>“You never know until you try,” said Peter. “I mean, you know I don’t really like hypotheticals. But it seems to me that you’d be trying to prepare for something that might not happen. You can’t know whether it will go badly, so to prepare for the worst is sort of a waste. Isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I suppose, I suppose,” said Remus, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. “But isn’t it important to safeguard against something bad? If you know there’s a potentially bad outcome, should you roll the dice on that?”</p>
<p>“Like in gobstones?”</p>
<p>“We’re losing the thread of this thing, I’m afraid,” said Remus.</p>
<p>“No, really, it’s like gobstones,” Peter insisted. “You know you’ll either win points or get a face full of disgusting sludge. But you give it a go anyway because you want the points. You try despite the nasty option because the good option could be really good.”</p>
<p>Remus mulled this over and glanced at James and Sirius, who were still going strong. He looked back to Peter, who was watching him expectantly.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I don’t know whether that’s very wise or very silly,” said Remus. “And I’m not really one for gobstones, if it comes to it. But I appreciate you listening.”</p>
<p>“Anytime,” said Peter. He clapped Remus on the back, then returned to watching the broom argument.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**************</p>
</center><p>If things continued as they had been, Sirius was going to die.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: He could no longer speak to or look at Remus without causing himself grievous injury.</p>
<p>It all started when he and James had been tossing around the quaffle (not a euphemism), and Remus had come into the back garden to read. He was wearing something perfectly ordinary, he looked normal, and he was reading. Nothing about the situation was extraordinary. And yet Sirius had found himself unable to tear his eyes away from him. When James threw the quaffle, Sirius wasn’t paying attention, and he was knocked off his broom.</p>
<p>Since then, there had been a scalding with hot tea, many stubbed toes, and one incident in which Sirius ended up walking into a door and giving himself an ugly bruise on his forehead. Aside from the pain, it was simply embarrassing. Even Peter asked if he was feeling okay.</p>
<p>Exhibit B: He was pretty sure that Mrs. Potter suspected something was going on.</p>
<p>For one thing, when Sirius had accidentally spilled the hot tea on himself, Mrs. Potter had been there. Sirius couldn’t be sure because he’d been preoccupied by the way Remus looked in shorts, but he had a sneaking suspicion that Mrs. Potter had seen him staring. As she helped him wipe the tea from her dining table, she’d actually <em>winked</em> at him. The thought that Mrs. Potter might know about his romantic feelings was too much to handle. If (Merlin forbid) she should actually say <em>something</em> to him, he would spontaneously combust.</p>
<p>Exhibit C: Remus was infuriatingly sexy, and he didn’t even know it.</p>
<p>Although Sirius was sure he’d once registered a general attractiveness in Remus Lupin’s appearance, the allure was now unbearable. Hair that had once just been hair was now begging for Sirius to run his hands through it. A body that had once simply carried Remus around could now be put to certain other uses. Sirius’ brain had no shame and offered tantalizing thoughts at the most inconvenient of times.</p>
<p>After several days of this, Sirius decided that he needed help. Since the Wizengamot was probably very busy at this time of year, he turned to James.</p>
<p>“This is all your fault, by the way,” said Sirius, passing the joint to James and breathing out a steady stream of smoke. “I hadn’t thought of Remus in this way since last fall. I was all wrapped up in my own brain. You know, where it’s safe? And then you had to go and mention our fucking banter.”</p>
<p>“There is banter, there’s no way you can deny that,” said James, taking a drag.</p>
<p>“I have to take your word that there always was banter. But now I can’t stop noticing it.” Sirius crossed his arms over his chest and grumbled to himself. “Now I’m all wrapped up in my brain, but in a bad way. Does that makes sense?”</p>
<p>“Not really,” said James. “But we are pretty high right now, so it could make perfect sense and we just don’t know it.”</p>
<p>Sirius nodded thoughtfully and took the joint from James. “Anyway, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“I think you belong together, I thought I made that clear.”</p>
<p>“What? Observing the banter was giving us your blessing?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. I’d be happy for you guys if you got together.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think it would be weird? Pete would think it was weird.”</p>
<p>“Pete’s a bit close minded,” said James. “I guess I was, too, until Moony came out to us. But he’ll get there.”</p>
<p>“You think so? I wouldn’t want to feel weird around Pete.”</p>
<p>“You already do.”</p>
<p>“Oh. That’s true.”</p>
<p>James stared off into the distance for a long while, and Sirius became fixated on a passing bird. Then he noticed his fingernails and spent some time studying those. Then he remembered how Remus had looked in those shorts a few days ago, and suddenly James was nudging his arm.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s get back,” said James, stubbing out the joint on a rock. He placed the remainder in his pocket and brushed his hands together. “And don’t forget the deodorizing spell. We don’t need mum asking if we’ve run into some smelly animal.”</p>
<p>“Honestly,” said Sirius, casting the spell on himself. “Especially since I’m positive she knows I’m thinking impure thoughts about Remus.”</p>
<p>James paused with his wand held aloft. “Wait, what?”</p>
<p> </p>

</center><p>Remus had been friends with James, Sirius, and Peter for several years now. Long friendships like these had rhythms. As such, it was pretty easy to tell when something was off. In the previous four days, Sirius had burned himself with tea, fallen off a broom, and openly stared at Remus on five separate occasions. Clearly, something was off.</p>
<p>There was a pretty strong possibility that this all had to do with hormones and recent conversations regarding sexuality. But Remus couldn’t be sure. After all, this could just be residual weirdness from Sirius being disowned, which was a fairly traumatic occurrence no matter how much he pretended he was okay. If it was just weirdness, and Remus tried something with Sirius, then everything would be catastrophically off. Perhaps they wouldn’t even be friends after that.</p>
<p>So as Sirius continued inadvertently injuring himself and worrying Mrs. Potter, Remus stewed in his own thoughts. It was what he did best.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Remus found himself a small chunk of alone time. James, Sirius, and Peter had gone to look for newts. At least, that’s what they’d told Mrs. Potter. In reality, they were probably smoking a joint. Normally Remus would have joined them, but he begged off with the excuse of the impending full moon. He loved his friends, and he loved spending time with them, but sometimes he just wanted to be alone. It was tricky finding a middle ground, but usually he was able to hide pretty well at Hogwarts. At the Potters’ house, there was nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>With his friends somewhere out in the countryside, likely analyzing rocks with unwarranted intensity, Remus spent several hours reading in the back garden. The air was somewhere in between cool and warm, and there were just the right amount of clouds. They’d drift across the sky, occasionally covering the sun and occasionally allowing Remus to attempt something of a tan. He didn’t care what Sirius said about reading; this counted as a summer wasted well.</p>
<p>When he finished his book, turning the final page with a smile, he went up to James’ room to find another in his rucksack. He was trying to portion them out so they would last until he went home to get his things for school, but it was difficult when he had such large swaths of free time. He’d become an expert at reading while contributing to conversations in his second year. It was the only way he could be friends with James and Sirius, but also manage his studies.</p>
<p>He opened the window of James’ bedroom to let the summer breeze waft into the stuffy room. It was so utterly perfect that Remus laid down on his bed and started his new book right there.</p>
<p>“Oh, shit. What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Remus shut his eyes and sighed to himself. He had read roughly three paragraphs when he heard the bedroom door open, followed by Sirius’ voice. There was really no way to feign sleep when you were clearly reading a book, so Remus sat up and swung his legs off the bed.</p>
<p>“Just getting some reading in,” he said, holding up the book.</p>
<p>“I thought you were reading out in the garden.” Sirius pointed to the window.</p>
<p>Remus nodded. “I was. And then I came up here. What are <em>you</em> doing here? Catch enough newts?”</p>
<p>“We weren’t catching them, we were just looking for them,” said Sirius. “And anyway, you know we were just getting high.”</p>
<p>Remus snorted. “I thought as much.”</p>
<p>Sirius surveyed the room and stuck his hands in his pockets. “I see you’re sitting around here being boring.”</p>
<p>“Sirius --” Remus began, but he stopped himself. What was the point in keeping to old rhythms if they were no longer serving you? Perhaps it was time to break the mold and move forward.</p>
<p>Something in his head, a voice that he didn’t hear often enough, whispered, <em>This is it</em>.</p>
<p>Remus set down his book and concentrated on keeping his voice steady, on not losing his nerve. “Sirius, why are you acting so strangely all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Sirius actually, physically, took a step backward. Clearly he hadn’t been expecting this forward approach. “Er. What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be an idiot,” said Remus. “You spilled tea the other day, and you fell off your broomstick. There’s something going on, and I just want to clear it up before we get back to Hogwarts, all right?”</p>
<p>“This is...where’s your usual waffling?” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“Sod the waffle,” said Remus, feeling braver now. “Just tell me what’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Sirius swallowed and ran a hand through his shaggy hair. “I think you know what’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Remus sighed. “Are we just going to continue playing games?”</p>
<p>“Fine,” said Sirius. “Fine. I think I have feelings for you. And I’ve just been testing the waters, I guess, to see if you feel the same way. And if you don’t feel the same way, I’m going to feel like a right nob.”</p>
<p>Remus smiled to himself as relief blossomed in his chest. No matter what Sirius had said, he would have been glad to clear the air. But he was glad his suspicions had been right. “There’s no need to feel like a nob.”</p>
<p>Sirius grinned at him, his eyes lighting up. “Really? That’s...wow.”</p>
<p>“I suppose it is,” said Remus.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Sirius was sitting beside Remus on the bed. It was like a blip in a Muggle film -- one moment he was standing at the door, the next he was beside him. Remus was torn between studying Sirius and looking away. When he managed to drag his eyes up to meet Sirius’ gaze, Sirius was unabashedly staring at him.</p>
<p>“This is very close,” said Remus.</p>
<p>“I’m sure we’ve been this close before.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but it’s in a whole new context now. Before it was just as friends. And, I mean, friendship is an intimacy all its own, but this is new and...and frightening.”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” said Sirius, leaning closer.</p>
<p>Remus watched as Sirius closed his eyes and tilted his head to the side. And then the bedroom door burst open and the film jumped again. In an instant, Sirius was on the opposite side of the room, standing near James’ record collection. James and Peter were standing in the doorway, and while Peter was oblivious, James looked very smug.</p>
<p>“What’s going on in here?” he said, his voice much too loud. Remus groaned; this was going to be made so much worse by the fact that James was high.</p>
<p>“Reading,” said Remus.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“Sure, sure,” said James, grinning now. “Because it looked like something else altogether…”</p>
<p>As James trailed off, time seemed to slow down. Remus could see it all -- Sirius admitting what they’d been doing, Peter groaning and moaning about gay people, James shouting and proclaiming how he’d been right. In the midst of it all, of course, Remus would be jumping out the window. He was glad he’d had the presence of mind to open it earlier. He only hoped that three stories was enough to ensure an untimely death.</p>
<p>But then, to Remus’ great relief, Sirius burst out with, “Oh, fuck! I’ve stepped on your Led Zeppelin.”</p>
<p>James’ eyes widened and he flew across the room. “You complete idiot! Which one?”</p>
<p>“Might’ve been the new one,” said Sirius, stepping lightly around the pile of records.</p>
<p>“The new one?” cried James. “Oh, for fuck’s sake. Why do I even let you in here?”</p>
<p>As James trailed off and sunk to the ground, examining each of his precious records, Sirius winked at Remus. Remus thought he managed a smile, but he couldn’t be sure. Everything felt numb with terror, and he assumed it might take a while for normal functions to resume.</p>
<p>Crisis and embarrassment had been averted for the time being. However, even though Remus and Sirius were now on the same page, things still felt off. While they had been in their own holding patterns before, now they were stuck in the same one. And this was the wrong place in which to try and work out romantic feelings.</p>
<p>Anytime Remus gathered the courage to approach Sirius again or ask him to talk, James or Peter or the Potters interfered in some way. On one particular day, Sirius was actually tanning in James’ back garden, and it could have been the perfect opening for Remus to say something or make a move. But as soon as he made it down to the garden, he found Peter there talking Sirius’ ear off about the upcoming Quidditch season. Embarrassed, Remus hurried back upstairs before Sirius could even notice him.</p>
<p>Then, the full moon.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the full moon, Remus noticed Sirius wanting to hover nearer to him. If they’d been able to work things out earlier, he wondered, would Sirius be doting on him? The thought seemed odd but also pleasant. All four of them worked very hard to lay the groundwork for a “camping trip” so that Mr. and Mrs. Potter wouldn’t be alarmed when they wanted to spend the night in the countryside. If they tried this more than once, the Potters were bound to realize which nights necessitated a camping trip. But Remus supposed it was safe just this once.</p>
<p>They set out early on the actual day, wanting to leave more than enough time to get settled before the transformation. James and Peter carried the camping gear and any other supplies they were bringing. Sirius said he couldn’t possibly carry anything “in this heat,” and Remus was excused for obvious reasons. The muscle cramps were already beginning, but he was an expert in pretending they weren’t there.</p>
<p>As James and Peter moved ahead with the gear, Sirius slunk back to walk next to Remus.</p>
<p><em>Please don’t let this be the moment,</em> Remus thought. <em>Not right before I’m about to become a hideous beast. It’s just too Hans Christian Andersen.</em></p>
<p>“Are you okay?” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“Sirius, I’m fine. I’ve done this many times.”</p>
<p>“I know, but, are you sure?”</p>
<p>Remus smiled at him, though his left thigh was throbbing with a new cramp. “Yes. Would your being a mother hen have anything to do with new feelings?”</p>
<p>Sirius shrugged and shook his head. “I have no bloody idea. I’ve never felt like this before. Is this how you feel when you love someone?”</p>
<p>Typical Sirius. They hadn’t so much as held hands and he was already throwing out big, important words. Still, Remus couldn’t deny the way his heart leapt when he said it.</p>
<p>Soon enough, James declared that they were far enough out to stop. Setting up camp was pointless, seeing as one or more of them would likely shred the Potters’ tent if it was standing. So they simply dumped their gear in a safe place and sat down to wait. Sirius sat next to Remus on a log, so close that their legs were touching. Remus prayed that neither James nor Peter would notice. He didn’t want to have this conversation right now, but he didn’t want to tell Sirius to move either. Human contact often helped right before the big moment.</p>
<p>The time seemed to fly by, and soon they were nearing moonrise. Everyone stripped down to their birthday suits -- something that had been much less awkward before now -- and waited. Remus took a moment to glance at his friends, as he always did to remind himself that people were here and they cared. James gave him a nod, letting him know he was ready to go. Peter smiled nervously and glanced up at the sky.</p>
<p>Remus might have expected Sirius to be ogling him now, what with the nakedness and awkwardness, but he simply fixed him with a solid stare. There was worry there, but mainly a reassurance that he was there to help however he could that evening. It occurred to Remus that he was never in doubt about whether Sirius had his back, even before this summer. He never had to question it, and Sirius always came through.</p>
<p>Then the moon appeared, and everything changed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**************</p>
</center><p>Over the years, Sirius’ feelings about the full moon had changed. At first he’d seen it as frightening -- something that was hell bent on hurting his friend every month. While they were attempting to become Animagi, full moons were his motivation. Every time he saw Remus in the Hospital Wing afterward was a new reason to push forward with the process. As they were testing out their animal forms, full moons became purely fun for a time. That evening, in the Devonshire countryside, Sirius felt nothing but worry.</p>
<p>Before, he’d simply been scared that something might happen to Remus. Now he was worried that it would, and somehow the two feelings were miles apart. While fear had driven him to find a way to help Remus, worry made him want to rip the moon from its place in the sky. He bore it as well as he could in the hours leading up to moonrise, and concentrated on changing into his dog form. The change was still new to him, and he had to focus on the way it felt to be a dog before he could actually transform.</p>
<p>Luckily, it was an uneventful full moon. There were no fights, no one ate anything they shouldn’t have eaten, and soon enough it was morning.</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing you’re not too scratched up,” said James, placing a bandage on Remus’ shoulder. “Otherwise my parents might get really suspicious.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how they’re not suspicious already,” said Peter. “I mean, when have you ever shown an interest in camping?”</p>
<p>“Fair enough,” said James, shrugging. “But the more we can do to make this seem like a normal camping trip, the better.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, it’s not too bad,” said Remus, and Sirius could hear the fatigue in his voice. “Might be difficult to sell the story of an angry cat when we’ve been out in the country all night.”</p>
<p>“I guess you could say we were attacked by wild animals,” said Peter.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said James. “But then we’d have to wound ourselves to make Remus’ scrapes look less conspicuous.”</p>
<p>“All right, all right,” said Remus, rubbing at his eyes. “Enough. The fact is that I’m fine and we should head back.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” said Sirius. He saw a flash of annoyance in Remus’ eyes, but he couldn’t help making sure he was all right.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Remus. Once James was finished bandaging his shoulder, he heaved himself up off the ground with a barely suppressed groan. He wobbled for a moment, then grabbed onto Sirius for balance. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Sirius was a head shorter than Remus, which made him the perfect height for a sort of human crutch. He was happy to help Remus out, and the closer they got to the Potters’ house, the less pronounced his worry became. They’d made it through the night and Remus was going to be okay. For now, he ignored the fact that this new worry was likely to crop up every month from now until eternity. That was too much to handle on this little sleep.</p>
<p>As they neared the house, Sirius glanced up at Remus. “Are you going to be able to walk?”</p>
<p>“I should be fine,” said Remus. Very slowly, he took his arm off Sirius’ shoulder and walked beside him on his own. “Thank you -- for last night. It was a big help to have you there.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Sirius, his heart in his throat. “I just want to make sure you’re safe.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded and quickly looked away. Sirius remembered him once saying that the full moon brought emotions closer to the surface for him. He decided not to probe any further.</p>
<p>The Potters remained blissfully unaware of their son’s true activities with his friends. Mr. Potter asked them how they’d liked the tent (it was an enchanted one, apparently, meant to house a dozen people). Mrs. Potter offered them all tea and scones. Remus accepted some tea, but he looked positively dead on his feet.</p>
<p>“Hey, er, Remus?” said Sirius. “Would you come upstairs for a sec? I wanted to show you that, er, new record that James got?”</p>
<p>Remus stared at him confusedly for a moment, and then nodded. “Right, right, I did want to see that. Will you excuse us?”</p>
<p>“Of course, dear,” said Mrs. Potter, and Sirius could have sworn she’d winked. He shuddered and hurried up the stairs, Remus right behind him.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” said Remus, once Sirius had closed the door to James’ bedroom.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” he said. “I just wanted to rescue you. You looked like you needed a lie down.”</p>
<p>To Sirius’ surprise, Remus sighed and covered his eyes. When he looked at Sirius again, it was with the patient expression he often used to explain things to Peter.</p>
<p>“I appreciate that,” he said. “I really do, and I appreciate you being worried about me. But Sirius, I’ve been doing this for most of my life. If I’m not all right, I’ll let you know. I can certainly sit through tea and scones with James’ parents.”</p>
<p>Sirius was astonished. “But you...you leaned on me all the way back. I want to help you now, I want to take care of you.”</p>
<p>“You’ve been helping me for ages,” said Remus. “Long before you felt anything romantic for me. And I don’t need to be taken care of. Yes, I leaned on you, and that’s because I really did need help. But I’m fine, I promise you.”</p>
<p>Sirius swallowed and looked down at his feet. “Okay. I didn’t...I didn’t mean to annoy you.”</p>
<p>“I know. I’m not mad, really,” said Remus, and he really didn’t seem it. “I just want to make sure you know how I feel if…”</p>
<p>Remus trailed off and Sirius stopped himself from filling in the blank. He didn’t want to make any assumptions just yet. Everything was so new and fresh, and no boundaries had been drawn. It left Sirius feeling unsure in every interaction with Remus. He wanted to break the tension, and he knew what might work, but before he could do anything, Remus stepped toward the door again.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he said. “Let’s go and have some tea.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Sirius, hesitantly.</p>
<p>“I’m not mad, honestly,” said Remus. “You would know if I was.”</p>
<p>Sirius certainly knew that was true. When he’d made the biggest mistake of his life -- something he’d thought would simply teach ol’ Snivellus a lesson -- Remus hadn’t spoken to him for a month. Judging by that, Remus wasn’t even mildly miffed right now. Sirius smiled at him, and then led the way back down to the Potters’ cozy kitchen.</p>
<p>After the full moon, there were just two full weeks until the start of term at Hogwarts. A mere four days after the full moon, Remus announced that he was heading back home to pack his things for the new term.</p>
<p>“You need a whole week to pack up your things?” said Sirius.</p>
<p>“No, but I want to see my parents,” said Remus. “Besides, I’m going to see you lot every single hour of every single day for the next few months.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying you’re sick of us,” said James, smirking.</p>
<p>Remus grinned. “You can sometimes have too much of a good thing, that’s all.”</p>
<p>Remus left with very little ceremony, which was just his style. He thanked the Potters for letting him stay, he stuffed everything back into his rucksack, and he even transfigured his bed into a thimble so that it wouldn’t be in the way. Standing at the fireplace with a handful of Floo powder, Remus waved to his friends and was then whisked away back to Wales.</p>
<p>Sirius’ one regret was that he hadn’t kissed him before he left.</p>
<p>Three days later, Peter went home to prepare for Hogwarts as well. Then it was just James and Sirius in the Potters’ cavernous home, just as it had been at the beginning of the summer.</p>
<p>On the night before they were set to leave for London, James stood in the middle of his room with his hands on his hips. Sirius was laying on his bed, staring up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>“I hate packing,” James grumbled.</p>
<p>“You should have done what I did,” said Sirius. “Abandon all your possessions! Then you wouldn’t have to pack.”</p>
<p>“You still had to pack what my parents bought you in Diagon Alley,” said James, gesturing to Sirius’ new trunk.</p>
<p>“Yes, but that was mostly done by shop assistants,” he replied, playing up his posh accent. “I wouldn’t be caught dead placing my <em>own</em> things into my <em>own</em> trunk.”</p>
<p>James snorted and started gathering up his things. Sirius continued to stare at the ceiling, thinking about how it had felt to walk around Diagon Alley with the Potters, James’ dad insisting that he get absolutely everything he might need. There had been such a war between gratitude and shame inside Sirius’ head that he’d felt panicked the entire time. He was fairly sure he’d got what he needed, but there was a chance he’d purchased three cauldrons and only one schoolbook.</p>
<p>“Hey,” said James, dumping a pile of assorted books and clothes into his trunk with a <em>thump</em>. “What ever happened with you and Remus? I mean, did something...did anything…”</p>
<p>Sirius sighed and sat up. “Relax, okay? We didn’t get funky right here in your room, mate.”</p>
<p>James tossed a t-shirt over his head and groaned. “Please don’t use the word ‘funky’ in that context ever again.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t get funky anywhere near your precious house,” Sirius continued, ignoring James. “The moment was never right. I mean, I don’t want to rush it either. We just...words were exchanged. We talked things out.”</p>
<p>James pulled the t-shirt off his head, making his hair even more of a mess than normal. “So things were discussed. Things are in motion? Am I right -- are you destined to be together?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Sirius, picking at his duvet. “I hope so?”</p>
<p>James sighed. “Ah, young love. You know this was all down to me, right? I’m the one who mentioned the banter, remember? I fully expect you to reciprocate and somehow help me woo Evans this year. This <em>has</em> to be the year. Even you’ve said I’m less objectionable than I once was, right?”</p>
<p>“Mmm, marginally so,” said Sirius. “I’ll see what I can do, Prongs. But I can’t promise miracles.”</p>
<p>Sirius lay back down and, moments later, James’ t-shirt hit him in the face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***************</p>
</center><p>For the first time ever, Sirius arrived at King’s Cross without his parents and Regulus. If asked to imagine this day, he might have guessed that it would feel liberating. In reality, he felt uneasy as they made their way to Platform 9 ¾. At any moment, they could turn a corner and run smack into his parents and he would have to face their haughty expressions. When he came through the barrier, Sirius winced and glanced around, but he didn’t see his family anywhere. Instead, he caught sight of Remus standing with his parents. Remus’ face lit up when he saw Sirius, and Sirius paused to wave at him. But James came through the barrier just then, stumbling into Sirius and knocking them both down.</p>
<p>“Thanks for that, mate,” said Sirius, wiping his hands on his trousers as he stood up.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re supposed to move away once you’ve come through,” said James. “Honestly.”</p>
<p>Eventually they sorted themselves out and the Potters followed them onto the platform. While James’ parents ran through a checklist of things he should have brought, Sirius wandered off toward Remus.</p>
<p>“Hello, Sirius,” said Mr. Lupin, sticking out his hand for Sirius to shake. “Good summer?”</p>
<p>“Brilliant,” Sirius replied, shaking his hand. Although Sirius adored James’ parents and was eternally grateful for how they’d helped him, he actually felt more comfortable around the Lupins. They were the happy medium between the sometimes suffocating love that the Potters lavished on their son and the chilly environment in his own home.</p>
<p>“Nice to see you again,” said Mrs. Lupin, giving him a warm smile. “I like the long hair.”</p>
<p>Sirius grinned at her. “My parents hate it.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps they’re a bit old-fashioned,” she said.</p>
<p>“They’re a bit something,” said Sirius, winking and making her laugh.</p>
<p>“Right,” said Remus. “Did you want to...can we have a moment alone?”</p>
<p>“Of course, of course,” said Mr. Lupin. “Go on, we’ll wait here with your trunk.”</p>
<p>Remus nodded to his father, then gestured for Sirius to follow him to a secluded area of the platform, away from the bustle of the families and students.</p>
<p>“Having fun flirting with my mother?” he said, smirking at Sirius.</p>
<p>“She started it! She said she liked my hair.”</p>
<p>“It is very fetching,” said Remus, studying him with his head cocked to one side.</p>
<p>They stared at each other for a few long moments before Remus took a step toward him.</p>
<p>“Whoa,” said Sirius. “What...what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Remus chuckled. “Er, sorry. I...I’ve just been thinking about things ever since I left James’ house. I think...I wanted to do something. And I should have just done it before I left. But you know how I am, what with the waffling.”</p>
<p>“It’s downright absurd,” said Sirius, smiling fondly at him.</p>
<p>“So. In the spirit of setting that waffle aside,” said Remus, stepping toward him again.</p>
<p>The sentence remained unfinished. The next thing Sirius knew, Remus’ hand was on the back of his neck and he was left wondering where Remus had learned how to kiss like this. Granted, Sirius had absolutely no experience in kissing anyone, so Remus could be really shit at it and he’d never know. But judging by the way Sirius’ stomach leapt into his throat, Remus was definitely not shit at this.</p>
<p>It was over far too soon, but Remus’ hand remained on Sirius’ neck, and his thumb rubbed gently at the skin below his ear. Sirius gazed up at him, knowing that he looked like a lovestruck idiot and not really caring.</p>
<p>“You know,” he said, swallowing nervously. “I’ve been a fan of your waffling in the past, begrudgingly. But I think I rather prefer it when you get straight to the point.”</p>
<p>Remus smiled and bit his lip. “I should have done it earlier. I probably should have done it last year at this time.”</p>
<p>Sirius felt an odd pang in his chest at the thought of this lost time. They could have had all of last year to figure this out. But he told himself it didn’t matter -- they had this year, and many years to come. Right now, all the time in the world stretched ahead of them and Sirius just wanted to spend it together. He hoped the look on Remus’ face meant that he felt the same way.</p>
<p>“What time is it?” he asked.</p>
<p>Remus looked at his watch. Like most Muggle mechanisms, it didn’t work properly when he was at Hogwarts. He still wore it, though, no matter how much Sirius teased him.</p>
<p>“Half ten,” he said.</p>
<p>Sirius grinned. “All the time in the world.”</p>
<p>Just as Remus was smiling back at him, Sirius pulled him down for another kiss. When their lips met he felt it all the way down to his toes.</p>
