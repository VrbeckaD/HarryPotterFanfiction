    <p>Hermione squeezed her eyes shut as she hunched over the body of the wizard she had found on the edge of the field, sprays of dirt falling over them as a bright purple spell collided just a foot from where she was kneeling. Gripping her wand in one hand she opened her eyes again and looked around quickly. The darkness surrounding her was blinding but the soft glow from her wand helped her to see the blood soaking the man’s shirt.</p>
<p>The field they were in was chaotic with activity. She was near the edge, thank merlin, otherwise she was positive that the aim of their enemies would be much more accurate. Instinctively she scanned the witches and wizards some 15 yards from her, eagerly straining to see any hint of the red heads of the Weasleys and the tousled black hair of Harry.</p>
<p>The Death Eaters cloaks and hoods stood out against the bright flashes of spells that lit up the darkness of the night. Anger rushed through her before she could school her emotions, anger.. and pure fear.</p>
<p>Pushing her feelings aside she turned back to her patient. This is why she was here, what she had been trained for. The man’s breathing was shallow, and Hermione muttered a spell over the blood flooding from the wound in his chest. “Please, please, please…” She chanted under her breath as she carefully watched as the flow of blood slowed.</p>
<p>Breathing a quick sigh of relief, she flicked her wand and the man disappeared, sent back to the Burrow. The makeshift hospital set up on the grounds would house many people tonight, as it had for the past four years of fighting. Four years since they lost the battle of Hogwarts. Four years more that Voldemort and the Death Eaters have been terrorizing the wizarding world.</p>
<p>Hermione got to her feet again, cast another disillusion charm over herself and rushed back toward the center of the battle. Flashes of red, white and… she ducked… bright green flew past her as she focused not on the wizards fighting around her, but the ones that were strewn across the ground at her feet.</p>
<p>Maneuvering her way as carefully as she could she knelt down to feel the pulse of a woman lying closest to her, clenching her jaw at the lack of movement under her fingers. <em>The next one</em>, she thought in reflex, checking two other bodies and again repeating the mantra she had said to herself too many times.</p>
<p>A glimpse of red hair caught her eye and she whipped around to see Ron duck under a flash of green light. Fear again rushed through her and she sent a spell that knocked the Death Eater that had just tried to kill Ron off his feet. The cloaked figure flew ten feet and landed with a soft thud on the ground, unmoving.</p>
<p>Ron glanced around fervently, and she dropped the disillusionment spell. Seeing her appear Ron breathed out a sigh of relief and rushed towards her, pulling her down into a crouch next to him.</p>
<p>“How many?” Ron asked, his grip on her arm tightening slightly as he looked around them. The center of the fighting was still several yards away and they had the cover of darkness for a few moments.</p>
<p>She shook her head, “Too many. This needs to end. Now.”</p>
<p>Ron turned his gaze to her and grimly nodded. “Be careful.” He said before standing and rushing forward into the heat of the battle, shouting orders to their allies as he went.</p>
<p>Hermione took another deep breath before standing herself and following him, keeping her wand held tightly in her hand as she focused on both the spells flying around her, and the bodies underneath her. A cackling laugh caught her attention and she abandoned her mission, instead turning and catching the moment that Bellatrix Lestrange sent a green beam of light from the tip of her wand. The crazy eyed witch was laughing joyfully as though it were Christmas morning instead of a deadly battle in the middle of a field.</p>
<p>The green light crashed into the chest of the man Bellatrix had been aiming at, and Hermione saw a flash of red mix with the fading green as the man fell limply to the ground. Red hair. She started forward, instincts and rage taking over as she threw spell after spell at the black-haired witch.</p>
<p>Surprised, Bellatrix turned her sneer on Hermione as she deflected spell after spell. She grinning madly as she stepped quickly towards Hermione, yelling as she came closer.</p>
<p>“Itty, bitty, mudblood bitch,” Bellatrix screamed out, dodging a bright flash of light from Hermione’s wand. “Did you miss me?” She cackled and Hermione yelled in frustration as she blocked another one of her spells. Stepping back, Hermione stumbled over something in the grass, losing her concentration as she threw out her arms to keep her balance.</p>
<p>Seeing the opportunity, Bellatrix screamed out, “CRUCIO!”</p>
<p>Bracing for the searing pain she would feel, Hermione squeezed her eyes shut. But instead of the bone cracking burning, she was instead pushed to the ground by a heavy figure. The breath left her lungs as they landed on the ground.</p>
<p>In the darkness she scrambled to twist out form under the man that was doing his best to get off of her. Hermione could see Bellatrix’s still form lying just meters from them, sprawled on the ground, her outstretched hand still frozen above her. Panicked she shoved at the person on top of her knowing that the <em>Petrificus Totalus </em>would wear off any moment.</p>
<p>“Hermione, stop.” The man grunted as her elbow dug into his side in her attempts to push him away.</p>
<p>Hermione stopped struggling and stared up at the green eyes above her. “Harry. Oh, thank god. Harry.” Relief flooded through her at the appearance of her best friend.</p>
<p>Now that the wiggling witch under him was still, Harry was able to find solid purchase and pushed himself up off of her, getting to his feet and catching his breath after his sprint across the field. He had seen her dueling Bellatrix and had reached her as quickly as he could. Harry reached down a hand and grasped Hermione’s arms to pull her to her feet.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” He asked, distractedly, wanting to return to the battle now that she was safe.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m alright, go.” Hermione replied, seeing his need to return to his friends and allies.</p>
<p>Harry nodded sharply and turned to leave. Suddenly he turned back to her, “We’re ending this soon. Get ready to leave on the signal.”</p>
<p>She nodded and he looked pained for a moment before turning back and rushing back, firing jets of red light from his wand as he went. There were at least fifty figures around them, and for a moment, Hermione felt as though she couldn’t focus her mind.</p>
<p>But the order from Harry spurred her movements. Not bothering to look back to Bellatrix, Hermione started to move back to her original mission. As she ran across the ground she stumbled again, cursing herself for the second time that night. Angrily she pushed herself up off the ground and kicked at the root that she had tripped over. Her foot collided with solid purchase and she felt a small ping of satisfaction, wanting to punish the menace.</p>
<p>Then the root grunted.</p>
<p>Surprised, Hermione scrambled up to her hands and knees and crawled back. The root that she had tripped over was in fact a leg, which was attached to a person, Hermione noted gratefully. She felt across the ground for the torso and felt the stickiness of what she could only assume was blood against her hands. The figure groaned again against her touches and she worked quickly.</p>
<p>“Shh. It’s alright. You’re going to be alright.” She said urgently as she saw the blood-stained tatters of a white shirt across the wizard’s chest. And around his shoulders, the dark robes of a Death Eater. Pausing she stared down at him, conflict suddenly raging inside of her.</p>
<p>Her hands were frozen just above the man’s chest, seeing the slight rise and fall with every staggering breath he took. She could stop. She could leave him and no one would know. He would be found in the morning, along with her friends and allies still scattered across the field. He was a Death Eater, he didn’t deserve her help. If anyone would have asked her three years ago when she began her training as a healer she would have said that every living being deserved to life and she would always do everything in her power to aid them. But that had been three years ago, and since then she had seen so much death. Death of her loved ones and death of the majority of her compassion, especially towards Death Eaters.</p>
<p>Gritting her teeth, she squeezed her eyes shut and forced herself to move. Gripping the man’s shirt, she ripped the tatters away and assessed the full thickness wounds that were slashed across his chest. A slight glow emitted from her wand as she ran it over the open flesh, wordlessly casting the healing charms she wished that she had never learned. She wished she could let this Death Eater die without feeling any remorse or obligation.</p>
<p>It was with this light that she saw something that made her pause in her work. The man’s face was illuminated by her work, and Hermione caught her breath as she recognized the silvery-blond hair that was matted with blood.</p>
<p>“Malfoy.” She breathed out, feeling her resolve crack again.</p>
<p>Catching herself she pushed everything aside except the blood. Dragging her eyes from his face she resumed her work.</p>
<p>His wounds were slowly closing when she felt the bright shock of heat flood through her; the signal. Looking down at Draco Malfoy, she was satisfied with her work. Cracks of apparition sounded across the field as the allies started to retreat at Harry’s command.</p>
<p>“They’re retreating!” A sharp cry sounded. One of the Death Eaters had cast the dark mark high in the air with a cackle of triumph.</p>
<p>Hermione was just about to push herself up to her feet to leave when she felt another flash of searing heat. Though this one was external to her instead of the internal flash that the order used as a signal to leave. This burning heat was right against her leg. She looked down quickly and saw Draco’s right arm pressed against her leg, burning hot and glowing with a slight green tinge. No, not his arm, she realized a moment too late, the dark mark.</p>
<p>She jumped as her school mate gasped and opened his eyes with a flash. Jumped again when he felt him reach wildly out for anything to hold onto and caught the front of her jacket. His eyes flashed with pain, and before she knew what was happening, Hermione felt the squeezing rush of apparition. But it didn’t come from her.</p>
<p>The world stopped spinning and she landed on her back with a thud, not having had time to prepare for a proper landing. Gasping to catch her breath she lay there for a moment before the panic set in. What the hell, she thought as she scrambled to roll over, she hadn’t even raised her wand.</p>
<p>She looked wildly around her, the dark walls around her were glistening with wetness, sloping high overhead with sharp turrets of rock hanging over them. <em>A cave, I’m in a bloody cave,</em> she thought numbly as her gaze drew upwards. The air was damp and musty as she pushed herself to her knees, relief flooding through her as she felt her wand still clutched tightly in her hand.</p>
<p>A movement a few feet from her caught her attention and she froze as Draco Malfoy pushed himself up into a sitting position, holding his head as he did.</p>
<p>Her breath was caught in her throat as she sat completely looking at him, scared to breath let alone move. He didn’t seem to notice she was there. His breath was ragged in the otherwise silent cave and his left hand pulled back the sleeve on his right arm, revealing the dark mark that seemed to shimmer as she watched it, the glow from earlier slowly fading with each second passed.</p>
<p>Draco rubbed at it as if to banish a pain before looking up for the first time and peering at his surroundings. He cursed and shook his head, moving slowly to his knees before raising his head fully and met her eyes. His expression was one of pure shock.</p>
<p>“Granger…” The word fell from his lips, trying to comprehend what he was seeing.</p>
<p>She was sitting just feet from him, looking as scared as a rabbit in a fox’s den. The fear vanished in an instant and he reacted, raising his own wand as she raised hers. But neither of them moved to cast anything, both waiting for the other to act.</p>
<p>After a few seconds Draco unclenched his jaw. “What the hell are you doing here?” He asked, his voice hard with anger, with hatred, but still his wand was silent.</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t move, too warry to shift her position. Not willing to give him the slightest advantage.</p>
<p>“Fucking answer me.” Draco said, louder this time as he slowly stood to his feet. She flinched but followed his ascent, scrambling on the slippery, wet ground while he had been smooth and graceful. They stood facing each other, both of their wands still trained on the other.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Hermione said, startled by the fear in her voice, the slight waver of it. Over the past four years of fighting, she had escaped death countless times. Maybe, she thought, her luck had finally run out.</p>
<p>A loud burst of noise to their right caught their attention and they both whipped their heads towards the sound. Around the curve of the cave Hermione could see bright flashes of light appear, followed by cackles of laughter and shouts of what sounded like a thousand people echoing off the cave walls.</p>
<p>Momentarily distracted, her wand arm lowered slightly, just enough for Malfoy to notice and take his chance. She grunted as he pushed her sharply against the wall, her back and head slammed shockingly into the hard stone. She felt her wand slip from her grasp as his arm pressed across her chest and shoulders as he pointed the tip of his wand against her neck.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask you one last time.” He snarled, his face only inches from hers as she froze under his grasp. They grey eyes were devoid of life and she felt fear grip her again at the iciness in them. “What the fuck are you doing here?”</p>
<p>She didn’t note immediately that his voice was quieter, or that he didn’t call out to the others that were only separated from them by a bend in the cave.</p>
<p>“I saved your life.” She said, just as harshly, tilting her head back to avoid the sharp point of his wand against her throat. If she was going to die, then she was not going to do so afraid.</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed as he continued to glare at her, pressing her even harder against the rock as she didn’t say anything more.</p>
<p>She felt tears sting her eyes as a sharp point of the cave wall dug straight into her back, she could feel it press through the skin on her back. Gritting her teeth, she focused her gaze on Malfoy’s grey eyes. “You were dying, and I healed you. You were bleeding out in the field, then you apparated and you bloody took me with you.” Her voice was low and harsh, wishing she could spit in his face.</p>
<p>The voices across the cave grew louder, almost as if they were approaching. Then Hermione heard it and her heart stopped cold.</p>
<p>“My friends.” The slippery, cold voice of Voldemort echoed louder above the celebrations. “We must gather.”</p>
<p>She hadn’t noticed that she had started to tremble at the words, but Malfoy had. He felt her start to shake beneath his arm and saw the fear glaze over her eyes as they saw past him towards the lights flickering against the cave walls. He glared at her for a few seconds more, gritting his teeth as the voices seemed to round the corner and grow closer.</p>
<p>“Now, where is Draco?” The icy voice sounded across the cave and Hermione’s frightened, brown eyes moved back to meet the grey ones in front of her.</p>
<p>After what seemed like a lifetime he moved. Shoving against her, he took a step back, still pointing his wand at her. “Fuck it.” Draco said under his breath before flicking his wand in her direction. She gasped, waiting for the flash of green that would end her life. Instead, the world crashed down around her and she was sucked once again into a spinning vortex.</p>
<p>Her breathe left her body as she landed again, falling to the hard floor beneath her with a crash. The impact left her right ankle burning in pain as it twisted beneath her. Panting she opened her eyes, looking wildly around her and felt her heart stop once again. She wasn’t in the cave. But she knew exactly where she was.</p>
<p>A large portrait hung at the end of the room, three figures stared out at her, two sets of grey eyes bored past her. She wasn’t dead, at least not yet.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>Draco felt his heart race as Hermione vanished with a soft pop. The events of the past few hours rushed through his mind and he struggled to push back any thoughts of Hermione, banish them behind the wall he had worked meticulously to build in his mind over the past several years. He had made his choice, now he needed to block it out. Turning he looked around him, searching for any indication that she had been there. There was nothing.</p>
<p>Breathing deeply and schooling his thoughts he turned towards the voices as Voldemort once again asked for him, this time there was an edge of fierce anger in his voice. The Dark Lord did not like to ask twice.</p>
<p>Draco walked briskly around the corner in the cave and stepped out into the light, blinking in the sudden brightness. Pushing past the others crowded in the space, he forced his face to be impassive as he moved forward to face the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>“Here, my Lord.” He said, calmly as he stepped out into the open.</p>
<p>Voldemort saw him then and a flash of anger passed across his red eyes before it disappeared. “Ahhh… Draco. I knew you’d make it out, my faithful general.”</p>
<p>Draco’s face remained impassive as a stone as he inclined his head slightly to the figure in front of him. Over the past four years since the battle at Hogwarts, Voldemort could cease to be called a man. His skin had turned scaly and the features of his face even more pointed and drawn, as if the snake inside was shedding its human skin.</p>
<p>The slanted red eyes met his again and the sudden rush of anger filled him as Draco felt Voldemort push into his mind. He steeled himself, bringing thoughts of the battle to the forefront of his memory, letting Voldemort sift gleefully through them as he observed the carnage his followers had bestowed upon the order members. He watched with Voldemort as order members fell before his outstretched wand, as people died all around him. But nothing came forward regarding Granger.</p>
<p>And just as quickly as he had entered, the Dark Lord freed his mind. Draco closed his eyes for a moment as the regaining of control flooded through him. He could hear Voldemort gleefully laughing, calling out to the rest of the Death Eaters in the room that they had done well. That the order would fall soon.</p>
<p>The shouts of celebration sounded around him again and Draco steeled himself as Voldemort stepped suddenly forward, bringing himself within inches of Draco’s face. He felt the cold hand rest on his shoulder as the snakelike figure leaned near.</p>
<p>“You have done well Draco.” The voice hissed out, quieter now, only meant for him.</p>
<p>“Thank you, my lord.” He said, inclining his head towards the figure. The icy feeling surrounding him made his skin stand up in gooseflesh.</p>
<p>“And what is this?” Voldemort asked almost aloofly, and Draco glanced down at where he indicated, looking at his own bare blood streaked chest. Granger had said he was bleeding. He could see the faint, thin cuts across his chest and knew that they must have been much deeper to produce the amount of blood that had obviously soaked through his shirt, leaving it dark and stiff against his skin.</p>
<p>“I was hit, My Lord.” Draco said calmly, brushing off his injury as easily as he could. He refused to show weakness, knowing Voldemort found power in other’s weaknesses.</p>
<p>The red eyes stared at him for a long minute before Voldemort stepped back, extending his hand out in front of him.</p>
<p>“Then you must be healed. Return home Draco, for I have need of you yet.” The silky voice commanded before he turned away from the wizard in front of him.</p>
<p>Draco waited until Voldemort had joined another group of cloak shrouded figures before turning away. He tried to ignore the sting of pain in his chest now that he had noticed the wounds. As calmly as he could, he made his way around the corner and apparated, knowing he would have a much greater problem waiting for him.</p>
<p>He landed with a crack that sounded through the room. Glancing around his bedroom he scanned the still space around him, looking for her. He was just about to turn when a heavy, hard object crashed into the back of his head, sending him staggering forward.</p>
<p>He growled at the impact and spun on his feet, raising his wand in front of him. Narrowing his eyes, he glared at the woman in front of him. She was breathing hard as she raised the large metal and wood bound book behind her head again. It was almost comical, he thought, as he surveyed her. Of course she would use a book as a weapon. He flicked his wand and the book flew from her hands. Another flick and he had her once again pinned to the wall behind her.</p>
<p>Hermione struggled against the invisible force holding her, not taking her eyes off of Malfoy’s grey ones as he stepped towards her. A cry of frustration bubbled up in her throat as her efforts to escape were proving futile.</p>
<p>“Let me go.” She growled at him, flinching as his wand once again pressed to her throat.</p>
<p>He smirked. The fucking bastard, she thought. His sneer was not the last thing she wanted to see before she died. But was she going to die? He hadn’t killed her in the cave, he had sent her here.  </p>
<p>“Now Granger,” His voice was icy, and she stopped her struggling at the similarities she heard from Voldemort voice not an hour ago. “Are you going to stop struggling or shall I bring you back to my friends in the cave?”</p>
<p>Hermione glared at him, wishing with everything she had that she could hit the self-satisfied look off his face. But she stopped her wiggling, knowing she didn’t have any other choice.</p>
<p>After a few seconds she raised her eyebrows at him, “Well? Are you going to let me go?”</p>
<p>The coldness of his features didn’t waver as he continued to stare at her. “Are you going to hit me again?”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes and as much as she wished she could assuredly say that she would like nothing better than to beat him over the head with anything she could get her hands on, she shook her head.</p>
<p>“Good.” He dropped his wand but kept his eyes on her as he backed away. She felt her feet touch the ground again as the pressure-like weight against her chest and abdomen disappeared. They stood, warily watching each other from across the room.</p>
<p>“Where are we?” She asked after a moment, her voice hard and quick.</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows at her. If she hadn’t figured it out by now, then she really was not living up to her reputation as the brightest witch of her age.</p>
<p>She glared at him, seeing the shift in his facial features. “I mean I know this is Malfoy Manor. It’s not exactly subtle.” She said, gesturing to the large painting of him and his parents that adorned the far wall of the room. “I mean, where in the manor?”</p>
<p>He tilted his head at her. “Does it matter? You’re here with a Death Eater. Someone who has been trying to kill you and your stupid little friends for years, and you’re concerned about what room of my house you’re in?” She was definitely not the brightest witch of her age, Draco thought as he continued to watch her.</p>
<p>She was smaller than he remembered, her petite frame seemed swamped by the vastness of the grand room around her. The curly brown hair was falling out of the braid he assumed it had once been once been neatly plaited into, causing locks to fall in loose around her face and shoulders. It was long, he noted, hanging over the curve of her breasts. Her skin was pale against the black of her shirt and jacket, as if she had been kept from the sun for ages. But her eyes were as fierce as he remembered, the molten brown staring back at him.</p>
<p>“Malfoy you could have killed me in a moment in the cave.” Her voice brought his attention back to the present. “You could have presented me to Voldemort and been a hero to the Death Eaters.” Her eyes narrowed and she clenched her hands, remembering the fear she had felt at the possibility. “But you didn’t. You didn’t kill me then, and you aren’t going to kill me now.”</p>
<p>The mask of cold dropped over his face once again and he took a single step towards her and flicked his wand at her. Hermione gasped as she felt pressure and pain wrap around her chest and throat like a vice. It was so intense that she choked on her breathe and dropped to her knees in front of him, her hands wildly clutching at the invisible crushing force.</p>
<p>Draco stepped slowly towards her, watching the fear return to her features. He dropped into a crouch in front of her, reaching out a hand to tip her chin up so her panicked eyes met his. “I have no problem killing you, remember that Granger.” His voice was eerily calm as he held her gaze and she couldn’t read his face.</p>
<p>Her lungs were screaming for air and tears started to prick her eyes. Just as quickly as the pressure had begun, it was gone. Malfoy stood quickly and tucked his wand into his robes, turning away as Hermione collapsed to the floor in front of him gasping for air.</p>
<p>“You fucking, evil bastard.” She breathed out with her first full exhale, pushing herself up to her knees to watch him. The anger seeping through her blood was like nothing she had ever felt before. The hate she felt for him growing up in school was nothing like the rage that flooded her senses now.</p>
<p>“Oh please, Granger.” Malfoy said, dropping into a chair near the large French doors across the doors. “Is that the best you’ve got.”</p>
<p>Hermione seethed as she got to her feet again, rooted in the spot as she kept her eyes trained on him. “If you have no problem killing me then why didn’t you?” She asked at last, watching as he raised his head to lazily meet her eyes again. The moonlight seeping in through the windows behind him illuminated his hair but darkened the contours of his face as he tilted his head at her.</p>
<p>Finally, he shrugged and held up his hand to examine his fingernails. “It seemed like a waste.”</p>
<p>Seeing that his gaze was no longer on her, Hermione let her eyes dart around the room once again. She had been in there for over an hour since Malfoy had unceremoniously dumped her on her ass in the room. Even though there were large windows on either side of the French doors that led out to a balcony of sorts, none of them would open. She had tried in vain every method of escape but without her wand, she had no resources and her surroundings were heavily warded.</p>
<p>Turning her eyes back to him she scanned his person for her wand, knowing that it had fallen from her hand in the cave. “A waste?” She asked, using whatever time she could to race through options in her mind. She just needed to get his wand.</p>
<p>He looked up at her again. “Yes. A waste.” Leaning forward, he leaned his forearms against his knees. “See I’ve heard that you’ve become quite the little healer, Granger. And we all know how closely ingrained you are in the order.”</p>
<p>Her heart had begun to race. “If you seriously think that I’m going to give you any information, you’re delusional. You can kill me now; I will never tell you anything.”</p>
<p>He smirked at her assumptions and shook his head. “Oh, you’ll help me, I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>“And why would I ever do that? You’re a Death Eater.” She said simply, her anger rising at his confident assurance that she was going to just hand over information on her friends without a fight.</p>
<p>“Because,” he said his grey eyes never leaving hers as he stood and took a step towards her. “We both seem to want the same thing.”</p>
<p>Hermione automatically took a step backwards as he took another step towards her. She had no way to protect herself and her heart rate started to increase again. “Which is?”</p>
<p>Malfoy smirked again but the grin slid from his face as quickly as it had appeared. His voice was deadly serious when he spoke again, the iciness of it making Hermione pay attention. “Voldemort has to die.”</p>
