          <div class="userstuff"><p>There are a few things i'm confused on... Most of them seem to be the fandom choices of my fellow parents.. Because I can't believe the names of children now a days... It's like fandoms rule the world and our children tell the tales.</p>
<p>I on the other hand named my son after an actor, and an American comic-book writer... who just happen to share a name.. so welcome Sebastian Stan Morris to the picture, he's a level 17 high school senior... (it's a gamer thing, we don't age, we level up.) whom I love dearly... yet slightly regrettably when he first brought home a Cullen.. and not one of the cool ones like uhh.. what's the twiggy ones name.. Jasper, not like Jasper, he fucking brought home Edward Cullen Shaw.. All I could think was, 'why couldn't he have chosen one from Vampire Diaries?' I mean who wouldn't want a sweet lill Damon or Alaric running around?</p>
<p>I mean, it's not all bad, he brought home siblings named Sam and Dean, so I have to be proud of that choice in friends, now hopefully they are as loyal as the characters they are named after.</p>
<p>As an adult we tend to speak with other parents whom attend the PTA, in doing so I met a mother who named her son Draco, she's jokingly taught him (while useing a terrible english accent) that 'muggles' aren't welcome in the house and being the child of a fangirl he's learned to go along with with his mother's deranged fangirling by responding with "but mother, Sherlock is my friend."</p>
<p>All in all, it's not terrible, we've a few idiotic Sherlock, creepy Tonys and way too many Cullens but it's evened out with sweet Steves and overprotective Peters. So I think we as fangirls and fanboys are doing a fair job raising our peculiar children.</p></div>
