    <p>
  <span>Tina Goldstein felt her headache subside a little as she smelled the familiar scent of her apartment. She certainly had a long, tough day at the office. Tina stepped through the door to find a very excited Queenie beaming at her with her hands behind her back. Tina rolled her eyes as she closed the door behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello dear sister,” Tina smiled at her. Queenie held up her hand, revealing a sealed envelope. Immediately Tina recognized the sloppy writing. It was a letter from Newt Scamander.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mail for you, Teenie.” Queenie smiled widely at her, reading the excitement and in Tina’s mind. Tina’s face immediately became red as she snatched the letter from her sister’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wrote back,” Tina exclaimed, spinning with the letter in hand. Tina thought for a moment. She considered going in her room to read the letter but she knew Queenie would find out what it said eventually. Tina turned towards Queenie with a small smile on her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to read it out loud?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie squealed as she jumped on the couch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping you would ask that!” Tina giggled herself before sitting next to her sister. She opened the letter with careful fingers. The writing on the front seemed to be written in a hurry. Tina cleared her throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dearest Tina,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I greatly enjoyed your letter. To answer your question, Pickett is feeling much better. Thank you for asking.  I made him a special concoction that I think did the trick. I have a some rather exciting news. My book release is very soon and my book tour is starting in New York. I am coming for a visit! My boat is scheduled to come in in exactly 2 weeks at 2pm. I would very much like to see you when I am in town. I hope you tell Queenie and Jacob the news of my arrival. I would very much like to see them again as well. I hope you are doing well. I am very excited to see you again. I have missed you all of these months. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yours,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Newt </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina looked up from the letter to meet Queenie’s smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s coming back,” Tina sighed as she held the letter close to her chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Teenie, he is very keen on you!” Tina looked at her sister.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Queenie grabbed the letter from her. Queenie scanned the letter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He said he missed you, Teenie! And he said, ‘Dearest Tina.’ He is so sweet on you honey.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina rolled her eyes, taking the letter back from Queenie. She read the sentences over and over in her head. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I have missed you. I have missed you. I have missed you.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina smiled to herself. Newt had never said that he missed her before in all his letters. They had been getting closer these past few months in their letters. Getting Newt’s letters and answering them was Tina’s favorite part of her week. They had started with addressing one another as Ms. Goldstein and Mr. Scamander. That slowly changed to addressing one another as Tina and Newt in their letters. Newt would always start his letters with ‘Dear Tina.’ Tina stared at this new greeting. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Dearest Tina.’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina felt herself blush. Newt was coming. She would finally be able to see him again. Tina furrowed her brow, nervous about the outcome of his visit. What if he wasn’t feeling the same as she? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Teenie, don’t think like that,” Queenie interrupted. “Just be excited.” Tina beamed up at her sister. Queenie grabbed Tina’s hands and started to giggle. Tina’s lips pressed into a firm line before she joined in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina never thought she would ever giggle over a boy this way. Tina never had much of an interest in men and romance. She was only ever focused on her career. Then she met Newt and everything suddenly changed. Here she was now, acting like those love-struck teen witches she used to roll her eyes at when she was at Ilvermorny. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tina. Stop those negative thoughts right this minute,” Queenie scolded. “Come on, let’s have dinner.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina stood up with her sister and walked over to the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have to eat quickly,” Queenie stated. “I’m meeting Jacob after dinner. I can’t wait to tell him the good news!” Tina felt her heart sink a little in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Queenie…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Teenie, don’t” Queenie put up her hand. “Jacob got his memory back the moment he saw me in his bakery. That’s true love, Tina! Just let me be happy.” Tina went to her sister, taking her hands in hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want you to be happy Queenie. I’m so glad that Jacob has gotten his memory back. I really am. But you have to be careful. I don’t want either of you to get into trouble. They could take them away from you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know that,” Queenie huffed. “We are being careful, Teenie. Trust me.” Queenie squeezed her sister’s hands. “I can’t let a love like this go.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina nodded, looking into her sister’s large, glistening eyes. Tina immediately thought of Newt. What would Tina be willing to do to hold onto Newt? Hopefully she wouldn’t have to find out. Queenie turned her head at Tina in understanding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I trust you,” Tina whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~ ~ ~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina tried not to count the seconds until Newt’s boat arrived. However, she did find herself staring at the clock on the day of Newt’s arrival. Tina got up from the table and slowly walked to the mirror in her bedroom. She ran her hand through her hair as Newt once did, attempting to put her hair back in place. Glancing in her closet, Tina sighed. She didn’t typically think about what she looked like. All of her outfits were practical and plain. Queenie was the one with the glamorous outfits. Thinking to herself Tina poked her head into her sister’s bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Queenie?” Queenie turned from her vanity and smiled at Tina.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping you would ask me.” Queenie stood, moving to her dresser. “I have the perfect thing.” She pulled out a simple but elegant blue dress. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This would look beautiful on you,” Queenie stated, holding the dress for Tina to see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t that a little fancy,” Tina asked, ringing her hands together. Queenie waved her hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at all. Put it on!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina stood in front of the mirror, her hair and makeup done wearing her sister’s dress. Tina frowned at herself in the mirror.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you look beautiful Teenie.” Queenie said, leaning against the wall of Tina’s room. “Newt is going to love it.” Tina looked back at herself in the mirror and tucked her hair behind her ear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess it’s okay.” Tina turned towards her sister. “Thanks Queenie.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go get him,” Queenie smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina stood at the docks, rocking back and forth on her heels. She stared at the large boat that had just pulled up, waiting for a head of red hair to emerge. The people on the boat started to get off and flood the docks. Tina was being knocked from side to side by the crowd scanning every face that passed her. Tina felt herself get more nervous as the time passed. Maybe he didn’t come after all... Maybe he was on a different boat…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt Scamander walked through the crowd looking for a familiar face. His hands shook with nervous excitement as he held his case closer to his side. When he saw who he was looking for, he stopped. Tina Goldstein looked more beautiful than he remembered. How he had missed her. She was nervously ringing her hands, head turning as she looked at the crowd. Newt smiled at her. Without being able to contain himself, he called to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tina!” She turned, meeting his eyes. Her face broke out into a wide smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina felt her breath hitch in her throat. There he was. His fiery red hair was longer and more untamed than the last time she saw him. He was wearing his usual blue coat, scarf, and holding that wonderful, magical case. His eyes sparkled as he smiled at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Newt,” she breathed. Slowly she started to run towards him. Newt felt his feet move as well. They both ran towards one another, their hearts in their throats. Just before reaching one another they both stopped. They started at one another, slowly panting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello,” Newt breathed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello,” Tina answered. Tina’s face broke into a wide smile before she launched herself into Newt’s arms. Newt wrapped his arms around her happily, holding her tightly to him, lifting her off the dock. Tina pressed her face into his neck. For the first time in months Tina smelled that lovely, familiar scent that was Newt Scamander. She heard Newt let out a happy laugh as he pressed his head against hers. After what felt like a lifetime, Tina felt her feet slowly touch the floor. They pulled apart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s great to see you,” Tina said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You as well,” Newt smiled back at her. They looked in one another’s eyes for a moment before the moment was broken. They looked away, nervously. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How was your trip,” Tina asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Much too long,” Newt answered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you hungry,” Tina asked. “Queenie is making dinner. She and Jacob are very excited to see you.” Newt nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m excited to see them as well.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pair walked together. Tina could feel the heat coming off of Newt as their hands slightly brushed past one another. She smiled to herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Queenie,” Tina called as she opened the door to their apartment. Tina and Newt walked inside. Newt awkwardly held his case against him, looking around as if he were lost. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She must not be home.” Tina shrugged. “She is probably at the market.” Newt turned and met her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you like some tea,” Tina asked, walking towards the kitchen. Newt gave her a small smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tea?” He followed her </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina felt herself blush. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I bought you some actually.” Tina turned back to meet his eyes. “I even practiced brewing it.” Newt smiled at his shoes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would love some, thank you.” Newt put down his case next to him as he sat at the table. Tina put the kettle on the stove and sat across from him. Newt looked up slightly, watching Tina through his hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You changed your hair,” he said quietly. Tina unconsciously put her hand on her bangs, feeling herself blush once again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It looks lovely,” Newt smiled. Tina smiled in response, biting her lip. Their eyes met from across the table. Newt stood up straighter in his chair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I have something for you.” Newt opened his case on the floor, reaching in it for a moment before pulling something out and placing it on the table in front of him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As promised,” he said as he slid the book towards her. Tina slowly picked up the book. She smiled as she felt the soft red leather cover.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” she read aloud. Tina looked up at Newt, smiling. “You used my title.” Newt nodded in response. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s beautiful,” Tina said as she started to open it. Newt watched as Tina put her nose in the book, taking in every page. He smiled as he watched her flip through it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s extraordinary, Newt. Really,” Tina said as she brushed her fingers over the sketches. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Newt smiled down at his feet. Tine flipped to the front, turning the first pages before something caught her eye. She opened the book to the dedication page.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>For Tina, Queenie, Jacob, and the adventure we shared.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina felt tears rush her eyes as she read the words. She looked up at Newt to find him watching her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you Newt,” Tina whispered, brushing a tear before it fell from her eye. Newt’s eyes started to water in response. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t have done it without you.” His eyes met hers. Tina reached her hand out and covered it with Newt’s as it lay on the table. Newt turned his hand, clasping hers. They smiled at one another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re here,” Queenie announced as she entered the apartment. Tina and Newt jumped apart to their feet, both a little flustered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s so good to see you Newt,” Queenie said as she wrapped her arms around him. Newt gladly returned her embrace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lovely to see you, Queenie.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Newt,” Jacob happily exclaimed as he entered the apartment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jacob,” Newt said as he wrapped his arms around his friend. They slapped one another on the back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s so good to see you, mate.” Newt said, smiling at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You too, Newt.” The men chatted happily as Queenie approached her sister. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Queenie look,” Tina held the book for Queenie to see.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Newt,” Queenie exclaimed. “It’s lovely.” Jacob moved next to Queenie to see the book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did it, man. It looks great,” Jacob said, slapping Newt on the back. Newt blushed as he looked at his shoes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s something else,” Tina said as she opened the cover to show Queenie and Jacob the dedication page. Queenie put her hands to her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh honey, that’s so sweet,” she gasped.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jacob sniffed, turning his head in an attempt to hide his tears of joy.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” he said, meeting Newt’s eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, thank you,” Newt said, looking at them all. His eyes locked on Tina’s “All of you.” Queenie clapped her hands together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well we have some reading to do, but let’s eat first.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great,” Jacob exclaimed. “I’m starving.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tina and Newt sat next to one another at the table. Tina looked at Newt to find him already looking at one another. She suddenly felt his hand grasp hers under the table. Tina looked up into his beautiful, sparkling eyes and smiled. </span>
