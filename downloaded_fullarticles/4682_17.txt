    <p>There was a time when he thought he knew terror. When he was branded with the snake-like monsters mark. When he was given the task. When he was told to kill. And after, when he failed. That was a long, long time ago. It feels like years. Centuries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He would laugh at his niave past self, but he is too terrified to make a sound. The snake-like monster holds a knife to his genitals, pressing the cold steel just hard enough to draw blood. Draco whimpers instinctively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Please..." He chokes out. Red eyes stare at him. He feels a tug in his mind and knows the snake is prying into his thoughts, viewing his memories like a slideshow. His fears are at the front of his mind, and he fights down the urge to even think about Occluding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thinking of fighting, were you?" The snake suddenly hisses in his ear, the warm breath making him shudder with fright.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"N-no..."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is no use. The monster already saw. He should have learnt by now, if the monster wants him to do something, he would do it without question. The monster never wanted him to think of disobeying, and he has. He knows he will be punished for this. He starts to tremble in anticipation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh, little toy, I enjoy you. Every. Single. Time." The snake licks a stripe down his face, and he presses his lips together, forcing his noise to stay inside. He must not make a sound during his punishment. Not now, and not ever. Unless they allow him to. And they haven't.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He feels the drag of cold steels over his cheek, cutting a line through the monster's saliva. The monster drags the knife deep enough to make him wince but light enough not to cut his flesh. He clenches his eyes tight shut as the knife finds its original place over his genitals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Don't close your eyes on me!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco's eyes snap open, meeting the monster's eyes for half a second before flickering to the dark behind him. The knife moves from his genitals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He doesn't quite manage to push down the anguished scream as the blade is stabbed into his arsehole.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>**</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fuck. The Malfoy boy should of always been what he is now. A plaything for the Dark Lord and those he favours. Which, as it is, includes Greyback.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He fits his hands in the Malfoy boy's hair as he suckles at his cock. Seeing the Malfoy boy like this almost makes him come on his own. He has been broken down this far and it is such a <em>thrill</em>. Seeing the boy reduced from the spoilt brat on the Astronomy Tower to this, the perfect toy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He drives his cock deeper into the boys throat, feeling an ounce of glee when he hears the boy choke from beneath him. It pushes him over the edge, making him come into the boys pretty mouth. He keeps the boy pressed against his crotch until he feels him swallow, and sees the boy turning red from lack of air. Even so, the boy makes no move to free himself. Not that he could, anyway. But still.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As nice as the boy is to play with, Greyback often has to refrain from killing him outright.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>**</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He waits. He is always waiting. Waiting, waiting, waiting. For a monster to come into his prison. Waiting to see.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What will they do to him this time? What will they <em>take </em>from him?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He shudders when he hears a booted stomp outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh. No. Please. Help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>**</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry's eyes fly open, breathing harshly at the climax of his nightmare. He had thought it was a vision at first, but it can't be. He can't even remember his nightmare, not really. He just remembers feeling fear, and a scream. And the dark, it was so dark.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Harry?" Ron stirs in the bed next to him. "Are you alright, mate?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry rubs his forehead. "I'm fine, Ron."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As he drifts off, he thinks of Dumbledore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He falls asleep thinking of Malfoy's terrified face, surrounded by darkness, and can't quite remember why.</p>
<p> </p>
