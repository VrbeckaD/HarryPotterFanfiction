  <span>Hi my name is Jace Wayland Lightwood Morgenstern Herondale. I have blond hair that reaches my neck and limpid golden eyes and a lot of people tell me I look like an angel (AN: if u don’t know what they are get da hell out of here!). I’m not related to Raziel but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m a shadowhunter and my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I’ve also got angel blood and go to a church called the Institute in Manhattan where I’ve been for seven years (I’m seventeen). I’m a shadowhunter (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black vest with leather pants and black combat boots with white foundation and black eyeshadow. I was walking outside the Institute. It wa snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of mundanes stred at me. I put up my middle finger at them. </span>

  <span>“Hey Jace!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. Clary Fray!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s up Clary?” I asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nothing.” she said shyly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.</span>
