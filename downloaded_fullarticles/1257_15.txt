  <u>
    <b>List of Knowns, and Tom's Deductions</b>
  </u>
</p><p>Bodies were dumped in a waterway that led to Thames.</p><ul>
<li>Tom: Careless disposal = Murderer did not care about bodies or how they were found. <b>None of them were specific targets</b>.</li>
</ul><p>Creevy killed swiftly, broken neck.</p><p>Prang killed by blow to back of head.</p><p>Crow beaten and died via head trauma.</p><ul>
<li>Tom: Crow killed in anger/struggle.</li>
</ul><p><strong><u>Note</u></strong>: The time his injuries would have taken to inflict would = ample time for Prang and Creevy to escape. SO Prang and Creevy were forcibly detained or killed first. (Tom thinks latter)</p><ul>
<li>
<b>Tom: Creevy's swift, clean death = he was killed first.</b> Didn't expect it. No struggle. </li>
<li>
<b>Tom: Blow to back of Prang's head = he was fleeing</b>, hit from behind.</li>
</ul><p>Occurred between Liverpool and London.</p><p>Crow used credit card at road-side restaurant near time of death.</p><p>According to records obtained, Prang frequented this place.</p><p>Creevy was a runaway.</p><ul>
<li>Tom: Creevy, Prang, and Crow crossed paths near diner. </li>
</ul><p>
  <b>
    <b><u>Note</u>: Tom assumes Creevy asked Prang for ride to London.</b>
  </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Lorry found in an abandoned barn off of an oft-unused side road.</b>
</p><ul>
<li><b>Tom: Someone/something forced them off-road.</b></li>
<li>Tom: Only Prang had key to back of lorry. Someone forced him to open it, or took the key from him to open it. </li>
</ul><p>
  <strong><u>Note:</u> Tom thinks latter, based on assumption that Prang was killed before Crow.</strong>
</p><p>There was significant disarray in the back of the lorry.</p><p>There was a bag of Crow's belongings.</p><ul>
<li>Tom: <b>Crow hid in back of lorry.</b> </li>
</ul><p>
  <strong><u>Note:</u> I think this = He anticipated arriving in London safely. Ask Tom about this deduction. </strong>
</p><p>The bodies bound together by plastic cording and dumped.</p><ul>
<li>Tom: Creevy and Prang only killed because witnessed. Crow killed beacuse he was also trying to have what murder wanted. </li>
</ul><p>
  <b>
    <b><u>Note</u>: This is 100% conjecture by Tom, could be false.</b>
  </b>
</p><p><u><b>Note</b></u>: Tom he seems VERY positive it was something in the truck the murdrer wanted. Not Crow.</p><p>
  <strong>Ask Tom about this conclusion. Seems reaching beyond evidence. </strong>
</p><p><u><b>Note</b></u>: Lab results found the two men had likely not died in the water. I was incorrect about them being alive when bound.</p><ul>
<li>Tom said this was an honest mistake of an inexperienced eye.</li>
<li>Prick.</li>
</ul><p><u><b>Note</b></u>: If something of value was in lorry, more investigation needed on company Prang was looking for. </p><p>
  <strong>Ask Tom about looking into company</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Ask Tom if he thinks Prang know what was in lorry</strong>
