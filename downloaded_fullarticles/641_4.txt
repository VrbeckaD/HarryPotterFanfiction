    <p align="justify">
  <span>Harry has problems, they all know it. Some of them are typical of a pre-teen but some of them aren’t. Disliking certain foods, not wanting to wear specific items of clothing: these are normal and you expect them of a child. Ducking their head when voices are raised, startling at sudden hand movements, shaking and hyperventilating at the thought of going into the supply cupboard at school: these </span>
  <span>
    <em>aren’t</em>
  </span>
  <span> normal. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>One such time when Harry exhibits something that isn’t normal for a child, Aziraphale is the one who witnesses it. He doesn’t quite understand Harry’s reaction, what with him being an ethereal being, but he’s lived on earth since the start and has seen a lot of human suffering. The issue Aziraphale has with Harry’s reaction is that he doesn’t expect to see it in a </span>
  <span>
    <em>child</em>
  </span>
  <span>. Perhaps a little naive of him, but who can blame Aziraphale for thinking that people wouldn’t traumatise children so. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Children shouldn’t fear being denied food for being children. </span>
</p><p align="justify">“<span>Crowley,” Aziraphale says quietly, that evening, to the demon sprawled on his usual sofa. Crowley is lazing about, pretending to be asleep, but the angel is well-aware of when Crowley is sleeping. It creates an absence in his awareness—something Aziraphale doesn’t think about because it raises some </span><span><em>very</em></span><span> daunting questions—that is currently lacking. </span></p><p align="justify">“<span>What is it, angel?” </span></p><p align="justify">
  <span>Harry is reading a book that he was looking at earlier in the day, which Aziraphale took note and thusly gifted Harry to read at the boys own pace. The child is engrossed in the contents of the life of Merlin—more the magical feats the warlock performed in his lifetime, Aziraphale guesses—and the distraction affords Aziraphale the opportunity to discuss certain things with Crowley.</span>
</p><p align="justify">“<span>Have you noticed some… certain behaviours in our young ward?” The angel asks, hoping that Crowley is observant enough to have noticed the same things Aziraphale has. Of course, he’s well-aware that Crowley </span><span><em>is </em></span><span><span>observant, but he’s uncertain as to whether Harry has… </span></span><span><em>slipped up i</em></span><span><span>n front of the demon. </span></span></p><p align="justify">“<span><span>Angel.” Crowley’s voice is rather flat for the demon. It’s quite a tone that Aziraphale recalls from very pressing times where Crowley was… not necessarily disappointed in Aziraphale, no, something more like… trying to pretend he was unaffected by the circumstances they found themselves in.</span></span></p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Like during The Flood.</span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Oh.</span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">“<span><span>I wasn’t certain, dear,” Aziraphale says, placing a hand on Crowley’s arm, lightly. The demon doesn’t tense beneath his hand which is good. That definitely means he’s not angry at Aziraphale only just noticing this. “I didn’t want to presume horrors.”</span></span></p><p align="justify">“<span><span>Always the optimist.” Crowley shakes his head. </span></span></p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Not always, Aziraphale thinks, not when it comes to you. </span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">“<span><span>What are we going to do, Crowley? We’re not- we- he’s a human child, surely he should be with humans?” Aziraphale fumbles.</span></span></p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Crowley turns his head and looks at the angel from behind those sunglasses he always wears. Even with the lenses, Aziraphale can tell Crowley is looking at him with the closest the demon can come to disdain for him. </span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">“<span><span>Oh yeah, lets just give the kid with a Her-given prophecy floating all over them to some random humans, wash our hands of the problem,” Crowley says and there’s biting sarcasm in his voice. Enough that Aziraphale flinches. “</span></span><span><span>Sounds like a real great idea, that. Not like heaven or hell will want us to check on him or anything. Nah. Just be another two people who screw him over, that’s a right good idea, angel. Can’t believe I didn’t think of it myself.”</span></span></p><p align="justify">“<span><span>Oh, all right, there’s no need to be rude,” Aziraphale says and Crowley snorts. “I’m just- Crowley, when was the last time you spent any time with a child?” The angel bites his lip. “I haven’t interacted with children since Egypt was two kingdoms!”</span></span></p><p align="justify">“<span><span>So you’re nervous about dealing with a kid and- what- figured throwing said kid at whatever human you think suitable is the best solution?” Crowley shakes his head. “I didn’t take you for such an uncaring bastard, angel.”</span></span></p><p align="justify">“<span><span>That isn’t fair, Crowley.” Aziraphale scowls. “I want Harry to be happy and well-cared-for, but we’re both immortal beings,” Aziraphale says, and he may sound a little sad now, because Crowley looks at him with his eyebrows drawn together. “I’m also- I don’t want to watch him grow and die. I’m- I’m afraid of how much it will </span></span><span><em>hurt</em></span><span><span>.”</span></span></p><p align="justify">“<span><span>So you’re scared?”</span></span></p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Aziraphale hesitates. “Not just for myself,” he answers slowly. “I remember how you were with the flood, Crowley. The children in Egypt. I don’t want you to suffer needlessly, dear.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">“<span><span>Angel.” Crowley stands smoothly, facing Aziraphale and he removes his sunglasses. There’s a lot of emotion in those golden eyes—eyes that Aziraphale has always found to be ethereal and beautiful, though he may never admit it aloud—that Aziraphale is very familiar with. He’s seen Crowley react to horror and pain the way Aziraphale himself never could. He always argues that it’s all part of The Plan, that he’s just a footsoldier, there to perform a duty, not to care—not to blame. Crowley is different. The demon feels it all, lives with it.</span></span></p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Is it any wonder that Aziraphale’s fears with raising Harry have more to do with Crowley than they do the angel himself?</span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">“<span><span>It’s never needless,” Crowley says. “</span></span><span><em>Never</em></span><span><span>.”</span></span></p><p align="justify">“<span><span>Oh.” Aziraphale probably sounds stupid to Crowley. He feels a little stupid too. “Well then.”</span></span></p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Crowley nods. “Yep.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">“<span><span>Tally-ho, then.”</span></span></p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Crowley grimaces. “Never say that again, angel,” he says and Aziraphale smiles.</span>
  </span>
</p>
<hr/><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Harry, looks at the angel and demon who have taken him in, took him away from people who hated him for things he had no control over, for reasons that he cannot be blamed for. He looks at them, standing close together, smiling at each other, not realising Harry is aware of them. And he smiles.</span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>He doesn’t know what they were talking about, but he certainly understands that they’ve made a decision regarding Harry’s future. It’s clear to see in the way they give him a kind look </span>
  </span>
  <span>
    <span>and are patient with him no matter the circumstances. It means more than he knows how to explain, can’t voice it aloud because he doesn’t have the words. Maybe one day… maybe he’ll be able to tell them both how much it meant that Crowley came and took him away the Dursleys.</span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Either way. It doesn’t matter.</span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>He’s happy here and he has a feeling he’s here to stay.</span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>
    <span>Call it a prophetic sort of thing, maybe. Though he needs to look up what ‘prophetic’ means. </span>
  </span>
</p><p align="justify">“<span><span>Mister Fell,” Harry says, drawing Crowley and Aziraphale’s attention. “Do you have a dictionary?”</span></span></p>
