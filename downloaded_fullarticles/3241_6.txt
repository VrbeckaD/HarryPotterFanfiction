  <em> <u> <strong>Chapter 1: FULFILLING THE PACT: Meeting One’s Bond Mate.</strong></u></em>
</p><p>Today was Brandon,son of Bain,High Magnar of the Wolf Tribe and chief of the Direwolves, 10 and 6 namedays. The celebrations, feasts and festive has been going all day as befitting the one of the prominent Magnar of the <strong><em>Paisti an Gheimhridh</em></strong>. It is was now the Hour of the Bat, and he has been summoned by his father, along with the Council of the Tribe Elders, The Council of the High Magnars of <strong>O thuaidh</strong> and the Barrow-King himself. Entering the large tent of his family, he beheld people sitting in a large semi circle. From his right were the Elders of his tribe and on his left the High Magnars, the vassals of the Barrow-King. Walking with straight back and proud bearing of his foresires, until he was about five feet from the king; who was sitting regally in the middle of the semi-circle and watching him impassively . Kneeling on one knee, placing his right hand curled in a fist on his breast and bowing his head. On the signal from the king,he lifted his head and he saw his parents on the left side of the king and on his right was his bond-mate and queen, The Queen Beira, his aunt from his mother side, coming from one of the Nomadic Tribes. His father had a long face with dark full beard and hair, while his mother was of fair face and had long red hair reaching her waist. The king was a man of strength older than his father hearty and hale; the queen was bit younger than the king and very much beautiful and unlike her sister her hair was dark like the night yet just long.</p><p>“Stand Brandon son of Ban; Son of Bain, of the Direwolves” Ordered the king. “My King and Queen, <em><strong>Beannachtai</strong></em>. And to you also, honoured elders and guests. Your presences honour me” I said. “Do you know why you have been summoned here” asked the queen “No, Your Majesty” I answered. Now it was one of the Elders answering, “As you know 20 and 6 years ago, we made a pact with the <em><strong>Leanai Na Foraoise</strong></em> to end 2000 years of strive and war. It was the gods who intervened, due to the suffering of both sides. We had our weapons and we had more numbers than they did and we knew how to fight a war better. However, they had powerful draiocht on their side and could hide and strike unseen.”</p><p>Bran knew this of course, everyone did. When his people came to this land for new life they found it already had people that they called<em><strong> Leanai Na Foraoise</strong></em>. They were small, hair like twigs or shrubs with big cat-like eye and smooth bark-like skin, with three fingers and a thumb with sharp claws like nails and they wielded powerful <em><strong>draiocht</strong></em>.</p><p>The elder continued, “This pact had terms and conditions, but the most important one is this: That a son of a <em><strong>Paisti an Gheimhridh s</strong></em>hall be bonded to a daughter <em><strong>Leanai Na Foraoise</strong> </em>upon his reaching 10 and 6 namedays, the Crannog Tribe will also do this. This is the will of the gods. Lord Shuck the Great Primal Direwolf himself commanded it, and has chosen a boy.”</p><p>Bran was shocked. The Gods rarely showed themselves to mortals,preferring to make themselves known through heart trees of the weirwood trees. But one of the few to do so was Lord Shuck, the patron of the Wolf Tribe. Bran has seen him only twice. One day when he was 5 namedays he got lost in the vast forest of the Gods-woods and fell in a hole, he had travelled through a dark tunnel until he came upon the great direwolf and he saw him again several days later,they spoke at length for nearly the entire day. Lord Shuck was a creature that was truly gigantic. He was twice the size of mammoths which the Giants rode. His fur black yet oddly comforting, like the night when the stars are out and moon was full. His eyes were full of red no whites or pupils just a burning red and when it moved his fur rippled. And when he opened his mouth to speak he shows white fangs like small swords. His voice was vast, powerful, unknowably ancient and utterly beyond measured.</p><p>“Lord Shuck the Black’’ I asked in surprise. “Yes, son that Shuck” said my father speaking for the first time. Mother was the one to speak “When I was learning to Sing  from the <strong><em>Leanai Na Foraoise,</em> </strong>I learned how to summon and I summoned him by mistake and he relayed the message to me and I told the Councils about it”</p><p>Mother was the leader of the Order of the Green Men, called so for their wearing green robes. These members were<em><strong> Paisti an Gheimhridh</strong></em> whom the <em><strong>Leanai Na Foraoise</strong></em> identified as having otherworldly powers; gifts from the Gods. Although having powers is not necessary for membership,merely to help foster friendship and exchange knowledge peacefully between the two races for the is still some hurts,grudges and holding from the war, to make certain no fights would occur, the learning takes place at the Isle of Faces, the Grove of the Gods in the Water Lands.These abilities were the green-sight, warging, mind touch, mind speak, All-speak, rune-maker and rune-speaker and rune-breaker. The newly awoken Sentinels and Guides. People with senses beyond men and animals. Those gifted were new and only those who dwell here in the North  seem to have received them.</p><p>'now I know'. Athe Sentinels and Guides were entirely new and utterly fascinating to the <em><strong>Leanai Na Foraoise</strong></em></p><p>I was still shocked to appreciate my father terrible yet still amusing jape but still able to address mother. “I am the chosen one, I take it”. The resulting silence gave the answers. “Her name is Dawn when spoken to our tongue. She is the youngest daughter of their Shaman. She is powerful in her own right beautiful and wilful and full fire” said the king.</p><p>“How the bonding going to work”? I asked “I mean it will be awkward with her being only reaching my hip’’</p><p>“Well, at least she will have no problem for sucking your cock as she won’t have to get to her knees, its murder on get on the knees I tell you.” I could only gape at my mother, horrified. That’s more than a child should know about their parents.</p><p>“Actually, her height won’t be much of a problem” addressed the king after staring at my mother in amusement. “I am told she actually taller than any of her kind about twice of their tallest in size, just around below your chest so it won’t be that much of a problem.’’ ‘Besides she is 1500 namedays I am sure she would have the wisdom to improvise’’ said the queen with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“What about children” I asked.</p><p>Mother was the one to answer; now serious, “Lord Shuck assured me that the two of you would be capable. Your future children would be mix. There would be men save for the eyes, skin and nails. If there is no new blood of the <strong><em>Leanai Na Foraoise</em></strong> the traits would disappear save for the eyes and the nails and teeth would be blunt but strong. And any ability they have would be extremely above their human ancestry but below the not so human ancestry’’</p><p>Bran wondered why the king is not having his own sons fulfil the Pact. After all it would seem the new blood would strengthen his bloodline and his rule. But then again, it was commanded by the gods and no one on O thuaidh wanted to get on Black Shuck bad side, He is after all a direwolf, the Direwolf of whom all direwolves come from and should not be expected to behave like a human and have human morals, and he is not in any way a tame wolf. But then again he might be waiting to see how things work out with me first, no need to risk the princes needlessly, this was after all <em><strong>O thuaidh</strong></em>, a hard place for hard people, it is only sense as winter is coming. Above all The North Remembers, like our Gods do.</p><p>“Preparations must be made you are leaving in 3 days. Meeting is adjourned" announced the king.</p><p>I waited till everyone but my parents shuffled out, pretending to not see the assessing glances thrown my way.</p><p>“I know this is not what you expected nor wanted. I know the there is that lad you been eying, Rickon, Rickard, Rickar” let it never be said Sansa of the Direwolf never speaks her mind.</p><p>“Rickon” I said blushing.</p><p>“Aye him. Now I won’t blame you the lad is prettier than the maidens of the tribe even I was not that pretty’’.</p><p>Now, Father added “Aye, were I your age I would have pounced him long ago. Pity the Gods chose now to fulfill the pact, his clan and ours would have made a formidable alliance, but what is done is done, it is never wise to anger the gods’’.</p><p>“I was waiting for him to reach majority he is on few moon younger than me. But I have to do what is required of me, I will do my duty father, as you know winter is on the horizon perhaps our new allies would give us their secrets of the earth so we can grow food and not starve to death.”</p><p>“Aye, you have the right of things, my son. But know this no matter what I will love and always be proud of ye lad’’ said my father and  with that I left.</p><p>Bain son of Ban son of Théoden of the Direwolves watched his son leave. When he did think he could be anymore prouder of his son, Bran, he was proved wrong. He remembered when Bran was a wee lad. Always asking question about one thing or another and tinkering about, not in least interested in weapons and being mocked as Bran the tinker. To be honest that had concerned him and shamed him a bit, but as always his beautiful bond-mate rightly turned his head straight, blazing like the fire which kissed her hair. Since then he has made an effort to indulge his son, and willing to knock few teeth loose of anyone daring to jape about his boy. And what a reward that was. When Bran was about exploring he fell in a cave-hole in the god-woods and there found vein of ore for new metal. It was the most terrifying day of Ban’s life. When Bran did show for midday meal, he got worried and called for his son and got no answer. He searched for his son in the tribe and everyone searched for him despite being somewhat of an outcast he was one their own. Imagine his surprise and everyone else to see his son talking to a bloody big wolf like it was friend. He is not afraid he pissed his breeches a little and nigh shat himself when the wolf spoke. Well, he knows some tribesmen did especially when it introduced itself. Only later when Sansa asked Bran what the the god were talking about. Only then did Bran talked about the ore he found and the god was explaining what it was and where the cave lead and what the new metal can be used and how it can be refined. Only by his friendship with Benjen did occur to him his son is talking about smithing. To make certain, on the morrow he asked Bran for the ore and took it to his friend, after some testing it became clear this is a new metal. Superior to the bronze we were using. After that an expedition to the cave was mounted. Finding a vein of this in gods-woods meant meaning it was no go. But, a fortnight later, Bran came from exploring again. He told his father where Lord Shuck told him where this metal can be found. Ever since than his son has been seen as the hero who bought prosperity to the tribe, not only by clearly favoured by the gods for his luck but his brain as well for he tinkered new planting tools for the tribe and not only that is good with a mace he is a druid as well.</p><p>Ban was taken out of his musing by his bond-mate. “Well I am thinking about our son’s accomplishment in his 10 and 6 years alone and also about what he said about the new alliance from his marriage. He is right. Given the pricks at <em><strong>Ghairdin Glas</strong></em> would try to pull us with our balls and and would want us to give up our new found god given wealth and want us suck their cocks for food.”</p><p>“Well, mo fior gra, how I help you get rid of the thoughts with better one. Say you think that throne is sturdy” his beloved said with a wicked smile and felt his blood responding.</p><p>Bran went back to the celebrations, sitting down and immediately meat and mead was put in front him put by his aunt,Beira, the Barrow-Queen herself. And then she just as quickly left. Shrugging, he begun eating the offerings and quickly looking around at the same time and he nearly choked because in front of him was Rickon. And the pretty boy just finished his own meat and sucking the juice off his fingers. Bran imagined those fingers were sucking something else. He felt himself hardned and was amused to see he was not the only one who looked like his breeches have become uncomfortable, as some of his friends were watching Rickon intently and some of the maidens were flustered themselves. And his blood cooled just as suddenly because there were sounds coming from the family tent that he never wanted to ever hear, Aggh parents are not meant to have sex ever..</p><hr/><p> </p><p>They have been on road forever. Bran would be glad to be reach the end of the journey because he was sure his arse was one big sore bruise due to the brutal pace his father set. As if the gods were listening, they came in a clearing where there is an absolutely enormous weirwood tree curved on it was a shape of wolf howling. This was also secondary to Bran because underneath the tree were <em><strong>Leanai Na Foraoise</strong> </em>but it was not they who held his attention, at least all of them. His attention was drawn by a beautiful creature taller than her brethren and more beautiful clearly a female with soft curves and smallish but fully developed. Looking at those golden-green cat eyes, Bran knew he had come to his destiny. The only thing more important than his brain, than his parents than his life, was this creat – no this woman happiness. And thus, formed the greatest bond that would forge the path to creating the Stark family the greatest dynasties and leaders of greatest kingdom of Westeros and one the world most ancient and advance Nations.</p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center"><u><em><strong>TERMS</strong></em></u><br/><em><strong>Sentinels</strong></em>: Men and women with extremely advance senses, instincts and physical prowess.
