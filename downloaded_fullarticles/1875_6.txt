    <p>Newt was in a great deal of pain.</p>
<p>Granted, this wasn't that unusual of a circumstance as the creatures he dealt with routinely bit, screeched at, vomited acid on, and inflicted other minor injuries on him in the normal course of the day. He didn't blame them for it, of course, and had gotten quite proficient at treating a variety of magical and nonmagical injuries over the course of his career as a Magizoologist.</p>
<p>It wasn't even unusual for the fact that it was a human causing him pain; Newt had pissed off a number of magical creature smugglers and world government officials over the years as he had thrown himself into saving as many magical creatures as he could. He'd been tortured, beaten, drugged, imprisoned, and had various other offences committed upon him during his travels and he could deal with that. The fact that the person currently binding him was dressed like the executioners from the incident at MACUSA was concerning, especially because she'd slapped the wand out of his hand and kicked it behind her.</p>
<p>No, what made these circumstances unusual and worrisome were the twin facts that his suitcase was nowhere to be seen, and that standing nearby was another witch wearing some sort of muggle clothing with a determined look on her face.</p>
<p>He covertly tried to wave her away - he could escape MACUSA again, if he had to - but she ignored him, instead shouting what sounded like a Knockback jinx while waving her wand wildly. The MACUSA worker whirled and smashed the clumsy jinx away with a contemptuous look before spinning back and getting a hold on him once more.</p>
<p>The pain of the executioner's spell was all the more acute for the brief relief from it, and Newt couldn't help crying out. The unfamiliar witch's face set into hard lines, and she yanked a potion out of her bag. It was an unfamiliar deep blue concoction, and the girl swigged it with a pinched face; probably very bitter. She smashed the empty bottle on the ground and brought her wand up with a determined expression. He knew what was coming next, and readied himself as best he could to make a dive for his wand.</p>
<p>"FLIPENDO!" This time the witch shouted, and made the gesture nearly perfectly - if somewhat more aggressively than her first cast. Caught unprepared, the MACUSA worker went flying without a sound, which Newt found odd. Still, now was his chance and he took full advantage of it by diving into a forward roll that brought him back into an upright position with his wand at the ready; he'd learned the trick in the Great War and some things stuck with you no matter how long you'd been back. Plus, of course, that it was so very useful against smugglers and their ilk....</p>
<p>He looked around with great confusion; the MACUSA worker had disappeared completely. He hadn't heard the tell-tale CRACK! of Disapparation, so something else had to be going on here. He turned to make an inquiry of the young witch who'd driven the executioner off him when he felt a jerk behind his navel and the world dissolved into a whirl of colors and sounds which didn't make sense.</p>
<p>When the world returned to normal, he was sitting on the floor of his brother's office with his brother looking at him somewhat sorrowfully from his desk.</p>
<p>"Theseus? What's going on? Where's my suitcase, why did MACUSA kidnap me?" Newt demanded as he stood up and brushed himself off. Theseus remained quiet for a long moment before standing up and walking around his desk to put his arm around Newt's shoulder. Newt's stomach sank like a stone; his brother knew how he felt about such physical contact; for him to do it anyway meant something Very Bad had happened.</p>
<p>"Newt, I have some bad news. Something.....<em>calamitous</em> has occurred..."</p>
