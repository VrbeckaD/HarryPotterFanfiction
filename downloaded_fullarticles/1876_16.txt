    <p>The white sands of Hueco Mundo stretched as far as the eye can see, glittering in the light of the moon that always shines in this world of endless night. A white bone-armored panther with electric blue eyes roamed the desert wasteland in an endless search for prey, though it was rare that he managed to find any and what he did was usually too easy a kill for his liking. Grimmjow wanted a challenge.</p><p>Loathed as he was to admit it the adjuchas missed his fraccion's company. At least when they were around he'd had someone to talk to - or more often listen to them talk to each other - to pass the time between actual hunts. He'd forgotten how boring it was to hunt by yourself out here...</p><p>Just as he was starting to get agitated movement caught the panther's eye to the left. Not very far in that direction was a pack of large but very slow adjuchas chasing what, by comparison, looked to be an incredibly tiny but remarkably quick hollow of some sort. As he prowled closer, both to sate his curiosity and plan his attack on the group as a whole, Grimmjow noticed that the tiny spec they were trying (and failing) to catch was a cub. </p><p>Now that was interesting. </p><p>Normally cubs, when hollows do manage to have one, don't live for very long. If the parents don't eat them themselves, which is uncommon but does happen, then they're almost always picked off by other hollows because they're abandoned pretty quick if their parents plan to survive. It sucks, but that's just how things worked in Hueco Mundo. You eat or you get eaten. Plain and simple.</p><p>So color the panther hollow surprised to see one so young running circles around an entire group of hollows big enough to swallow it whole. Hungry after days of wandering and seizing the opportunity granted to him Grimmjow uses the pack's laser focus on their prey to ambush them, taking them by surprise and making quick work of them all. It's as he starts eating the first, glancing to see if the cub's still around, that blue eyes lock with toxic and serpentine green.</p><p>The cub stands there, looking like a cross between a cat and a snake, as though it doesn't know what to make of him. Equally curious about the tiny thing Grimmjow decides <em>"What the hell"</em> and says "You just gonna stand there or do you want some of these? You'll probably get more out of these weaklings than I will cub."</p><p>Timidly the little feline approaches, nudging the spider-like adjuchas the older cat is eating warily with a black dipped paw before looking up at Grimmjow with a cocked head more snake in shape than cat - save for the ears. Snorting in amusement, licking the blue blood that flows through hollows from his mouth, the panther jokes "What? Never eaten another hollow before?"</p><p>At the cub's nod Grimmjow doesn't really know what to say. This adjuchas cub, which was closer to his own level of power than any of the weaklings they're feasting on, has no clue what he's doing at all... And he's managed to not die despite all that! The panther was suitably impressed. "What's your name cub, mine's Grimmjow Jaegerjaques."</p><p>"Harry Potter..." Harry nudged one of the spider's spindly legs again "Can I really eat these?"</p><p>"There's not really anything else to eat in Hueco Mundo cub. Now eat before I change my mind about keeping you." </p><p>With that little order the tiny feline opened its serpentine jaws and took their first bite of hollow. Abandoning the spider to the cub once it became clear that he was making up for lost time with this meal Grimmjow started eating the monkey-like one closest by so he could keep an eye on the little cat-snake. </p><p>This was quite possibly the strangest thing he'd ever done...</p><p> </p><p>-----</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter, as the dark haired and green eyed boy had discovered was his name earlier this year upon starting preschool with his cousin Dudley and not Freak as he'd assumed (since that was what his relatives called him his whole life), was having a very strange day. He'd just gotten in trouble with Uncle Vernon for something, he wasn't sure what really, and knew he was in for a very long and painful punishment. He'd closed his eyes and wished desperately to be as far as possible from his Uncle, whose face was the deep shade of purple reserved specifically for when he's mad at Harry, and then when he opened his eyes he <strong>was</strong>.</p><p>Just another strange thing to happen to Harry that he can't explain.</p><p>Wherever this new place is, with its white sand as far as the eye can see and black sky holding a moon but no stars, the 4 year old finds it rather beautiful...</p><p>As he goes to explore however Harry stumbles on his feet, rolling down the dune he was standing atop all the way to the bottom. Searching why the boy finds that he's not a boy anymore, but some kind of creature covered in white plates of bone-like armor all over his body. His hands and feet are now paws, matching the triangular points that seem like cat ears atop his head, and they (the paws at least) seem to have black sock markings... But his tail isn't the thin catlike sort, no his is thick and long with a zigzag pattern along its top that seems to go up his spine. It looks like the tail of a snake, which would match the forked tongue that flicked from his mouth when he tried to smell.</p><p>Is there such thing as a snake-cat? Was he always this creature inside? That might explain why his relatives hated him so much...</p><p>Curious and starving, even more so than he was back at the Dursleys mere moments ago despite being just as starved as before in truth, the boy turned monster set out exploring this strange new place. Hopefully he'd find food.</p><p> </p><p>He did not find food, but he <strong>did</strong> run into a bunch of equally hungry and much bigger monsters of various shapes. Harry took some comfort in the fact that he seemed much faster than they were and was too tiny for them to actually grab him, but was very frightened. He didn't want to be eaten...</p><p>To his relief a savior came in the form of a panther-like monster not quite so massive compared to him, who slew all the larger monsters very quickly and started to eat them. After watching the bigger cat awhile he offered to share his food with Harry and introduced himself as Grimmjow. A strange name, but he <strong>is</strong> a monster so that seems fair. As he ate his fill of the giant spider creature that had not so long ago been trying to eat him Harry felt conflicted.</p><p>On one hand (paw?) he was eating a monster like him and Grimmjow, which was gross but apparently normal given the older cat's explanation that there isn't any other food here. On the other hand Grimmjow was sharing his food with, and being nice to, Harry. The latter was something that had never really happened before... And monster, or hollow as the blue eyed panther had called it, wasn't actually half bad taste-wise.</p><p>And as he trekked after his new and first friend after they'd eaten their fill of those other hollows, leaving nothing behind, Harry smiled. He really did like it here.</p>
