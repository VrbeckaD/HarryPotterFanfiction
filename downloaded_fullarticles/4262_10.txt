    <p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>There is an untangling of legs and arms. A sudden coldness rushes underneath the blanket, chasing away the after-sex heat of two bodies still merged together. The bed creaks along with each movement, and Sirius idly wonders whether it might one day fall apart in the middle of a tryst.</p><p>“I’m cold.”</p><p>“Then come back here.”</p><p>He shifts impatiently. The sweat on his back has cooled, and the buzzing heat in his chest has dulled. He watches Severus edge towards the large wardrobe. There are fingertip-sized bruises on his hips and a bitemark between his neck and shoulder that still bleeds.</p><p>“The clothes in there are my mother’s.”</p><p>“Were,” Severus corrects him, because of course he would. Sirius rolls his eyes.</p><p>The closet is opened, and the scent of his mother’s old perfume wafts through the room. He stretches his arms out and settles on his side, careful not to let old memories take shape behind his eyes. Severus picks up something, using only his index finger and thumb, as though it may prove dangerous.</p><p>“It’s her nightgown,” Sirius says. The memory of her wearing it isn’t very clear; he just knows. It has a deep blue hue in the morning light, but in the wee hours of the night, it is just black. It looks foreign in the bony, veined hands of Severus. Then he says, “Put it on,” although he’s not sure why. He’s not sure why Severus complies either.</p><p>Maybe it satisfies some inner rebellious teenager of him, to see his mother’s clothes worn by the man he just fucked (in her bed, too). Maybe it’s some belated, useless form of payback. Merlin knows she wouldn’t care about his sodomies, but to have her gown tainted by a half-blood, therein lies the real atrocity.</p><p>Severus is wearing his mother’s nightgown.</p><p>His back is bare, his hips lightly embraced by thin satin. In the glow of candlelight, his skin is pale golden, dotted with birthmarks and marred with scars. His feet are bare, toes white and blue on the cold marble floor.</p><p>Sirius is seized by the desire to touch him. Not like he just did. Not the nails digging in skin, the pulling of hair, the urgent skin-against-skin contact that he can blame on 12 years of crippling isolation. He doesn’t know where this urge comes from, or what he is supposed to do with it. His mouth opens before he can stop himself, but when Severus’ eyes catch him in the reflection of the mirror, he knows that whatever words had sprouted from the depths of his chest, they were not going to make it to the surface.</p><p>“You look like a girl.”</p><p>Those black, beady eyes turn away again. For a moment, he thinks Severus will say something back – something clever and mean that would have annoyed him if Severus’ voice wasn’t still husky. Instead, Severus just stares at himself in the mirror.</p><p>“Are you going to come back?” he asks impatiently.</p><p>Severus’ reflection glares at him, but he turns around and slips back underneath the covers when Sirius raises them. His skin is cold as ice. Sirius runs his hands over Severus’ arms, which are covered in gooseflesh, and then moves to his chest. His fingers glide over the cool fabric. He almost says something about it, about the gown, but then he remembers that there’s only so much he can say before Severus leaves. It’s already been a while since Severus stayed the night. Reflexively, he puts an arm and a leg over him. One of the benefits of putting on weight is that he can pin down a scrawny man like Severus while asleep. There’s a muffled sound of protest, but it doesn’t take the shape of words, so Sirius closes his eyes and falls asleep before Severus can annoy him into speaking.</p><p>--</p><p>There’s a lot of trauma to take home from Azkaban. Loneliness, nightmares, and paranoia being the obvious ones. Those are also the ones that everyone understands. Remus has no problem spending time with him when he can, Tonks will slip him some mild sleeping draught if he asks nicely, and Kingsley keeps him up to date on whatever fake lead the Ministry has fallen for. Still, there are some things they simply can’t help with.</p><p>Waking up is one of those unexpectedly heavy pieces of luggage he took home from prison. It is more than a year since he regained his freedom, yet every morning, in the haze between sleep and wakefulness, he is back there. Every morning, he can feel the hard, stone ground underneath him, before it softens into his sweat-soaked mattress. Every morning, he can hear the ocean waves breaking against the rocks, before they deafen into the constant ticking of the old clock on the wall. Every morning, he can taste the salt in the icy air, until the nauseating warmth of the rooms breaks through.</p><p>But lately, he wakes up to the taste of hair in his mouth, the sound of muffled snoring, and two cold feet pressed against his shins.</p><p>There are many things that Sirius never knew, and never cared to know, about Severus. That he likes to sleep in whenever he can is one of them. The way he looks, one would think he gets no rest at all, yet here he is, curled up tightly against Sirius, and by the sound of it, fast asleep.</p><p>He would get up, and leave the snoring bastard to wake up alone, but there is nothing to get up for. They only do this on the loneliest of days, when the emptiness of Grimmauld Place is so loud it rings in his ears. His fingertips run lazy circles through Severus’ hair, and he wonders why he comes here. There’s plenty of people to amuse himself with at Hogwarts. There’s plenty of reasons for him to avoid Sirius. Yet here he is.</p><p>It’s nearly eleven when Severus stirs. From experience, he knows that it takes about thirty minutes for him to go from the first stir to actually getting up. Unless there is morning sex.</p><p>“Hey Snape.”</p><p>The latter turns his head so that it’s buried in between Sirius’ chest and the pillow.</p><p>“Hey. Wake up.”</p><p>There’s a grunt of which Sirius knows the meaning very well, but each time he still asks.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Hmm Hmm.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Hmmmmmmm. Hmmmmmm.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Severus turns his head back. His eyes are barely open but already glaring. “Fuck you.”</p><p>His voice is still husky, and softened with sleep. His head drops again, and he sighs deeply. The frown between his eyes smoothens, and he looks as though he has fallen asleep again. If Severus would have had the strength to keep his eyes open one second longer, he would have seen the painfully fond smile on Sirius’ face.</p><p>“Hey Snape.”</p><p>“What.”</p><p>“What’s the most traumatising thing you’ve ever been through?”</p><p>“It’s talking to me right now.”</p><p>“What’s the most traumatising thing you’ve ever been through?”</p><p>Another sigh. It’s a very efficient technique, to repeat a question until the desired answer presents itself. Severus still looks as though he might be asleep, but his voice grows a little steadier with each reply.</p><p>“I’m not sure whether you want me to leave, or whether this is your idea of foreplay.”</p><p>“Do pre-coital conversations turn you on?”</p><p>“Please never talk to me again.”</p><p>Severus can be quite funny, if Sirius can get himself to stop taking offence. He’s exceptionally skilled at changing the topic too.</p><p>“So, what’s the most traumatising thing you’ve ever been through?”</p><p>“Adolescence.”</p><p>“I’m assuming you don’t mean the acne.”</p><p>Severus actually glares at him for that. Ooh, touchy subject. There are still scars from it on his cheeks. Sirius reaches over, and runs his thumb over them, but Severus turns his head and buries his face in the pillow.</p><p>A while ago, Sirius thought it better like this, when he couldn’t see his face. Now, however, there is no part of Severus that isn’t clearly Severus anymore. There’s no pretending that the man next to him is some stranger. The fantasy has worn off, and so has the desire for it to be anyone but him. Sirius moves his hand further down, and stops on Severus’ hip, where he draws lazy circles.</p><p>For a long time, neither move from this position. Sirius watches him while daylight begins to spill into the glum little room. The bedsheets are pale rose, the pillows ivory, and the morning light a pearly white. They are in great contrast with Severus, whose skin is sallow and dark, his hair and eyelashes black as the night, and the nightgown he wears almost blue.</p>
