    <p>“Get out of my way!” Amelia Bones shouted at the Auror holding her back. The place was decimated. Leaves from trees, dried and crisp, fell one-by-one onto the dead grass below, the air stood stagnant and the smell of magical fire lingered. Yet this mattered little as the Auror Captain tried to pry the arms around her off to find whoever, or whatever, remained in Godric’s Hollow. Specifically that quaint little house that sat at the edge of the village, home of the Potters.</p>
<p>“Sorry ma’am, orders from the Chief Warlock himself. Can’t let anyone in until he says otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Clarkson,” She addressed the young Auror, her nails digging into his arm. “Let me go or I swear to Merlin and the Divines you’ll regret it.” Amelia looked at him straight with malice and sadness. She had to find out what happened to Lily and James, and her sweet godson Harry. “Please…”</p>
<p>He was hesitant for a few moments. He also wanted to confirm the well-being of his mentor James Potter, the man that taught him everything he knew. And with a small sigh, Clarkson let the Captain go. “Find them. But tell anyone I tried to stop you.” There was a smile on his face, something that signified defeat both from Amelia and the destruction of Godric’s Hollow. Amelia nodded before sprinting in the direction of the small house, her wand in hand.</p>
<p>She saw them gathered at the front of the house. Her tears already welling up as she saw the fate befalling the once lovely home. Amelia felt something in the pit of her stomach, she could taste the metal in the air as she neared Albus Dumbledore. He acknowledged her with a small nod, tears in his eyes. He seemed to have aged twenty years since the last the two met.</p>
<p>“Albus, where is Lily?” There was no response, only averting his eyes from the Auror Captain. She could feel tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“James?” He shook his head. And Amelia’s blood ran cold and her tears never ceased.</p>
<p>“Amy,” Sirius Black approached her and the woman embraced him. “I know how hard it is. How painful it feels, believe me. They were my best friends, my family.” He ran his fingers over Amelia’s hair, his tears have dried up yet his eyes still felt watery. Amelia looked at the people gathered, they all looked devastated, as if they have given up and lost the fight.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore was looking up at the stars, whispering a few words of goodbye to his fallen children.</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall lowered her head down, saying a small prayer to the people she trusted the most.</p>
<p>Remus Lupin sat on the ground, face passive and expressionless, yet his breathing was heavy and his eyes were red.</p>
<p>Severus Snape stood at the entrance of the broken house, his fingers brushing the sides of the door frame while whispering something repeatedly.</p>
<p>Hagrid was trying to sort through the rubble, occupying his mind with something else. He sniffed his nose every once in a while.</p>
<p>And this solemn looks of defeat was broken by the sound of a man from inside the house.</p>
<p>“He’s alive!”</p>
<p>Everyone’s head turned towards the voice of David Greengrass. The man walked from the nursery towards the front of the house, Snape and Hagrid followed him and they soon met with the others.</p>
<p>“I found him in the crib, buried under the rubble of the house. It’s lucky he’s alive.”  David approached them with a small bundle in his arms. Amelia instantly recognized the small embroidery on the edge of the blanket, HJP.</p>
<p>She pushed pass Sirius and Minerva, almost tackling Remus to reach whom she knew was her godson. The baby was sleeping, as if an entire battle was never present. A small scar on his forehead worried Amelia, but presently she was just glad to find hope in this madness. The baby woke up and immediately started crying. And David tried his best to lull the baby without success.</p>
<p>Amelia outstretched her arms, and David obliged. She was always better with Harry than he was.</p>
<p>“Shhhhh,” Amelia gently rocked the baby back and forth. And soon Harry was sleeping, nestling his head to her bosom as he would always do with Lily.</p>
<p>Sirius walked over to them, smiling as he placed a hand on Harry’s head. Thanking the gods for miracle.</p>
<p>“What exactly happened here?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p>“Peter betrayed us. “  The werewolf growled softly, spitting when he mentioned the traitor’s name.</p>
<p>“We’ll find him, and he will pay. But for now, we must not dwell in hatred. For now we must rejoice for the Dark Lord has been defeated.”</p>
<p>“Amelia,” Albus started. “Thanks to the courageous sacrifice of Lily and James Potter, Harry is safe. The last of the Potters. And I would think of no one more suited to care for him than you.”</p>
<p>“I agree. With everything going on with my work, plus the fact that we’re expecting means I’m barely functioning. Though if you need any help you can always ask me. My Family is always ready to help the Potters.” David said with a small smile.</p>
<p>“That goes for all of us my dear. We know taking care of children is difficult, especially now that you have two. But rest assured all of us are here when you need us.” Sirius voiced out the collective opinion of everyone. They were all deeply connected to the Potters, some owed incredible debts while others vowed their loyalty. Yet most of them were simply there because the Potters gave them a home to come back to, a family when they had none.</p>
<p>They raised their wands up in honor of the dead. To remember those that have fallen for the world to rise. Silver sparks trailed from each wand, making the cold dark night brighter and filled with warmth. Amelia looked up to the sky, watching each wisp vanish into the sky. She cannot change the past, nor can she predict the future. So for now she rests her spirit with the small boy in her arms, protecting him from everything that wanted to harm him. She thanked his parents, her best friends, Lily and James and asks for their guidance through this journey she is about to embark on. She thanks her sister and her brother-in-law, promising to care for their daughter as she would her own. And finally she says a short thank you to the great divines for keeping her godson and niece safe from the evils that lurked the shadows. Amelia would fight the world for them, this she was sure of.</p>
<p>Little baby Harry opened his eyes, and the first thing he remembers were not the flash of green or the haunting chills of a madman laughing, it was the sparks of silver and light that flew from the ground and seemed to form the stars above.</p>
