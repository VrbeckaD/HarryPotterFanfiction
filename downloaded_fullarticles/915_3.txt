          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale begins in Ravenclaw Tower long after the school day in a room only two people know about. Colin Creevey has come to speak to Rowena Ravenclaw after hearing rumours about her spending more hours than usual in the library.</p><p>Colin knocked on the door.</p><p>Rowena asked, "What do you want, Colin?"</p><p>Colin said, "Let me in, I just want to talk to you."</p><p>Rowena unlocked the door and let him in.</p><p>She muttered, "This is about my extra time spent in the library, isn't it?"</p><p>Colin nodded and told her, "I just want to know what's wrong, Row."</p><p>Rowena replied, "I heard a muggle-born talking about how cameras capture the soul of the subject, so I decided to do some research."</p><p>Colin insisted, "What did you find out?"</p><p>Rowena stated, "That it's an old folk tale, but I believe it." She scowled. "You're a soul catcher!"</p><p>Colin frowned. "Do you really think that I'd do that? You've known me for five years now. I thought you weren't like anyone else I knew and I was right, but I can't believe you choose to believe in some rubbish story!"</p><p>Rowena sighed. "It's not rubbish, but I see your point. I should have thought first before telling you this because I..."</p><p>Colin glared at her, urging her to finish her sentence.</p><p>Rowena mumbled, "Was wrong."</p><p>Colin retorted, "Yes you were, but don't think I'm going to forgive you so easily."</p><p>Rowena responded, "I understand, it will take time to earn your trust back." She smiled slightly. "I'm prepared to do whatever it takes."</p></div>
