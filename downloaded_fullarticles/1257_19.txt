</p><p>The traditional September 1st Sorting Ceremony for 1996 was memorable for many reasons. For one, it marked the first since the second and final defeat of Voldemort – which many in the magical world, especially in Great Britain, were understandably still celebrating. </p><p>It also marked the first since Hogwarts had become more overt in its opposition to the British Ministry of Magic still being biased towards purebloods, with Cornelius Fudge and Delores Umbridge heavily shaken but managing to remain in power due to supporters and having economic pressure to enemies – many of whom had taken up refuge in nearby Hogsmeade, making it more of a bastion for those opposed to the pureblood bigot agenda.</p><p>The final first year had been sorted, but Minerva McGonagall – who was now reading the list of new students not as Deputy Headmistress, Head of Gryffindor House and Transfiguration Professor, but as full-fledged Headmistress – had not yet come forward to pick up the Sorting Hat and the stool it sat on. The reason for this became apparent as she announced, </p><p>"Our third years and above will no doubt remember our hosting witches and wizards from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang two years ago, and this time, we have the fortune of welcoming another from across the Atlantic Ocean. We have a transfer student from Ilvermony in the USA who will be joining our sixth years, and he is our last to be sorted tonight."</p><p>A palpable buzz ran through the Great Hall as McGonagall raised the list to read the final name:</p><p>"Alex Schuyler."</p><p>Alex breathed a sigh of relief that he was being referred to by the name he had chosen for the time being as opposed to "Alexander" and the other name he also carried. Unbeknownst to anyone at Hogwarts, he had heard much about his ancestor and namesake for as long as he could remember, and he had not yet taken the name for two reasons.</p><p>One, he wanted to avoid drawing attention to himself, and two, he felt – no, <em>knew</em> – that he had not yet proved himself worthy of the name, even if he had heavily and successfully drawn inspiration from his heritage already.</p><p>He stepped into the Great Hall, and they could see that he looked his sixteen years, walked with a determined stride, and had black hair that was tied back in a short ponytail. They also could see that he had fair skin but with a hint of tan that spoke to him being Hispanic. </p><p>He also wore black robes that he had worn at Ilvermony but were suitable for Hogwarts, and he had brought them for that reason. One side was already adorned with the Thunderbird crest – his Ilvermony House – with the other one still black and ready to receive the crest of his Hogwarts House. He could feel all eyes in the Great Hall on him as he approached the stool and donned the Sorting Hat.</p><p>"My, what is this?" The Hat asked, chuckling. "I see another soul lingers within you, though I am looking within you and see that you are very much aware of that. Already, you have a lot of the power that made him famous and a lot of his traits too. You have a mind that has few equals, if any, and you're ready to go to great lengths to get noticed and then protect your reputation, just like him."</p><p>Hearing the Hat's first words to him, Alex felt even more uncomfortable than when he had been sorted upon arrival at Ilvermony – the Gordian Knot and wand ceremony seemed like child's play compared to this in his eyes. A chill ran through him and he nodded solemnly, remarking, "He is said to have said, 'Ambition is my folly'." </p><p>Almost unbidden, his hand moved to cover a pocket of his robes, where there was a small lump – a move that Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley picked up on as they watched from the Gryffindor table.</p><p>The Hat continued, "I can see you are aware of that. I also happen to know your ancestor was known as 'The Little Lion'. Do not ask me how I know this – the fact that I know is enough." </p><p>Alex swallowed and managed a nod, wondering how much more the hat knew about him and his illustrious ancestor and namesake.</p><p>As if in response, the Hat added, "Within you, I also see the courage to confront challenges and eventually prove yourself worthy of your lineage...and the name 'Hamilton'." </p><p>The name was spoken as though it itself was an incantation. To Alex, it was – at the mention of it, he felt energy that was both chilling and invigorating racing through his veins.</p><p>"Do not be afraid," The Hat finished encouragingly. "I believe you will be tested soon enough, but that courage could only have come from you and you alone." </p><p>"I think you're right about that...and thank you." Alex replied, smiling for the first time since he'd put the Hat on.</p><p>"You're welcome. Right, then..."</p><p>The Hat raised its voice and shouted for all to hear, <em>"GRYFFINDOR!"</em></p><p>

</p><p>As befitted their House's nickname, a lion-like roar went up from the table, including from what Alex had suddenly noticed were the most illustrious members of the House not only among those who were there but arguably since the late, great Albus Dumbledore. He saw Harry, Hermione and Ron standing up to applaud, with many around them following their example, and he beamed at that as he noticed the red and gold Gryffindor crest appearing on his robes while the lining and hood of his robes matched those colors.</p><p>He couldn't suppress his smile growing larger as he shook hands with the so-called Golden Trio – who by all accounts that he'd heard of back in America, were revolutionaries his namesake and ancestor would be proud of. Little did he know as they invited him to sit not next to them (those seats were taken by Ginny Weasley, Dean Thomas, Parvati Patil and Neville Longbottom), but nearby and across from them, how right he would be proved in a short space of time.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>The Room of Requirement (7th Floor) – Dumbledore's Army Meeting</em>
</p><p>"When I passed him on the train, I would have thought he'd be a Ravenclaw because he's got both the brains and a big appetite for learning," Harry said. "He was trying to make sure he didn't miss a beat coming to Hogwarts from Ilvermony."</p><p>"Not to mention that he and I are among the last to leave the library or the common room," Hermione added.</p><p>Nine of them had come to practice dueling and hexes that evening. Accompanying Harry and Hermione had been Ron, Ginny, Luna, Dean, the Patils and Justin Finch-Fletchley – all who had distinguished themselves in the final battle against Voldemort. Alex had enthusiastically joined their ranks, but was busy with homework along with a number of others and had sent word ahead that he wouldn't be able to make that particular meeting.</p><p>Padma took this opportunity to add her own observation, saying, "He's also got a lot of ambition, but it feels more like a thirst to prove he's something because he's Muggleborn – or from a Non-Maj family, as they say in America – <em>and</em> Puerto Rican."</p><p>Parvati nodded fervently alongside her – she and Parvati knew too well what it meant to have that much more to prove as immigrants and ethnic minorities. She then added, "That's where his Gryffindor colors show – he's not scared to take on others, including teachers. I'm already having some difficulty counting the number of times he's made sure to raise his voice, whether it be in discussions or arguments." The others nodded as she finished.</p><p>"We certainly are getting quite the background on magical communities abroad between the Triwizard Tournament and now this," Dean remarked.</p><p>Luna nodded and then added, "I find him fascinating not just because he's American – I look at him and it's strange...I feel like I'm watching an old soul who's done a lot in a past life but yet had unfinished business."</p><p>"I'm not an expert on Soul Magic, but I'd wager such a thing is rarer than a Crumple-Horned Snorkack, eh, Luna?" Ginny asked her best friend with a smile.</p><p>"Absolutely." Luna replied, smiling back.</p><p>"If anyone wants to have a crack at that theory for whatever reason," Parvati said, "I saw some of his owl post and aside from the Ilvermony correspondence were letters addressed from a Gilbert du Motier, a Nemeus Mulligan and an Ian Laurentius."</p><p>"Gilbert du Motier...wait, why do I feel like I've heard that name before in history?" Hermione asked, her hand going to her forehead.</p><p>"I wonder the same. You have been on holiday in France multiple times, have you not, Hermione? I remember hearing about this du Motier too but can't remember more about him..." Justin said.</p><p>"Yes," Hermione replied. "Harry got to come along this past summer, and I think we heard that name then."</p><p>"We did, but I don't remember any more about who he was," Harry concurred.</p><p>"Is this a Muggle thing?" Ron asked.</p><p>"It is – or, at least, I think it is," Hermione replied. "I do remember we heard the name while we were in Muggle Paris."</p><p>"Shall I write Fleur about this just in case she knows anything?" Harry asked, turning to her.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'll do that later today. I know you have prefect duties tonight." Hermione replied, giving him a short peck.</p><p>"Good idea, since I've got to figure out how we can further assist Hogsmeade and those who have been staying there temporarily. I have a few ideas for McGonagall and I want to run them past her."</p><p>In the wake of Voldemort's death and Hogwarts opposing the Ministry, Dumbledore's Army was no longer required to be kept secret, but its members had continued to train in preparation for further threats – and one had already arrived as they took on the role of helping those in the school and in the village who were unable to help themselves. The first Hogsmeade weekend was not far off, which gave them even more incentive to make sure everyone was in good shape.</p><p>
