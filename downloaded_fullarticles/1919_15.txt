    <p>Hermione slowly stretched and yawned, her teeth glinting with the early morning light. Running with the sunrise was, by far, one of her most favorite activities. She loved the feeling of the grass under her paws and the way the sun slowly warmed up the grounds of Hogwarts as it rose higher in the sky. With a quickness that belied her inexperience, Hermione shifted back into her human form. Each shift was more fluid that the last, and Hermione had been practicing for weeks since she had first made her transition under the watchful eye of Minerva. </p>
<p>Since taking up the mantle of Hogwarts Librarian after Irma’s retirement, Hermione had much such progress with restructuring the library system as well as her own personal research. Minerva, who was now one of her closest friends and allies, had first suggested Hermione simply spend her time researching and taking care of such a treasured place. Hermione had immediately accepted. Many of the other professors had returned, though some had taken up apprentices so that they might retire well in the knowledge that their pupils would be taught in a manner fitting Hogwarts. One of the most notable returnees was none other than Severus Snape. Though he no longer spoke in the same manner as before, he still managed to inspire fear in the children the likes of Hogwarts may never see again. The Defense position had finally been free for a long-term hire, now that Voldemort was finally gone. Most unfortunately for some, Lucius Malfoy has been called to fill the vacant position. </p>
<p>Hermione had yet to be completely comfortable with the elder Malfoy. Though it had come to light that his wife had been dosing him with potions to make him more susceptible to Tom Riddle for their entire marriage, he still left her with an uneasy, on edge feeling. Minerva said it was because he looked at her like a Hippogryph looks at ferrets. He looked at her like he wanted to devour her entire being.<br/>Hermione, pondering the mysteries of one Lucius Malfoy, dazedly continued her walk back across the greens to Hogwarts. As she approached the front doors, she looked up and caught Lucius’ eyes and had a startling realization. She wanted him to devour her.</p>
