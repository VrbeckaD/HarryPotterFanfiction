    <p>Tom Marvolo Riddle was carrying boxes into his new house. He had just graduated from the esteemed University: Hogwarts, and had wanted to head straight into independence, no matter what his mum did to make him stay at their family home. The movers had just left, all his furniture in their rightful place, and these were the last boxes he needed to bring inside. His arms flexed as he set down his boxes of cutlery and dishware onto the dining table. His house was sized perfectly for him, two bedrooms, one bathroom, a balcony overlooking the streets of central London, and an attic<em>-or loft, if you will- </em> above him. </p><p>Tom stretched his arms and proceeded to put all his boxes in their respective rooms to be sorted later. Things that he wouldn't really need like old clothes and holiday decorations were going into the attic and he did just that. He had just finished putting all of his useless things in the attic to collect dust when he tripped on a loose piece of floorboard. </p><p>"What the," he muttered, reaching down to tuck it back in when a slip of leather caught his eye. He pried the board off and there laid what seemed like a photo album, if the leather cover was anything to go off of it. It was dusty and old but looked like it hadn't been used for years. Perhaps the previous house owner had forgotten it when they moved. <em>'Maybe it's a book of dark rituals'</em>, Tom mused.</p><p>He gingerly picked up the book, in fear of accidentally breaking it. It was heavier and bulkier than he thought and just as dusty as he saw. He took the book with him downstairs to the dining table and sat down. He set the book down and reached for a paper towel from the roll on his table to wipe the dust and grime off. The cover was a dark brown in what was probably high-quality leather, an elegant design of a phoenix in gold leaf still intact. It shone in the late afternoon sun and Tom quirked a small smile, running a finger over the leather.</p><p>He thumbed open the hardcover, meeting a page with a partially elegant scrawl. It was certainly different, but Tom had no trouble in reading it. In the middle of it said, <em>'This scrapbook belongs to Harrison "Harry" J. Potter, May of 1835.'  </em>So, this was a scrapbook and not a photo album <em>or</em> a book of dark rituals like what Tom suspected. </p><p>"Good god," Tom muttered, taken aback. 1835? That was well over a hundred years ago, hell, almost nearing two hundred years now. He knew his house was old; made in the Georgian era, but how could the renovators miss this book when they renovated the house?</p><p>So, this was a scrapbook and not a photo album <em>or</em> a book of dark rituals like what Tom suspected. He flipped the page and on the back of it he found a picture of who he assumed to be Harry. It was amazingly preserved in black and white, though a tad bit yellow. Harry was quite dashing to say the most, as Tom couldn't say the exact words to describe the man in the picture.</p><p>He was young and classically handsome. His hair was fluffy and messy and pitch black, though Tom only assumed because of the lack of color. What he also assumed was that Harry's eyes were a lighter color, based off the fact that his eyes appeared to be gray. </p><p>As Tom stared, he felt a twinge in his chest, snapping him out of his stupor. He looked around confused before looking back at the picture. That was weird to say the least, and Tom had seen a lot of weird things in his life. He decided to look at the next page where an entry was written.</p><p>
  <em>'Hermione had gifted me this scrapbook earlier today. It served as a reminder that she wanted me to take an entirely new leisurely activity with her company. I thought of it as a bore and she had reprimanded me with a quick thwack to my cranium with a newspaper. Someone had remarked that her behavior was unsightly for a lady but she had not a care. I suppose that I will continue to litter these pages with little odd trinkets and images until I deem fit.'</em>
</p><p>Around the entry was a few small buttons, an article about the next political figures from what Tom assumed was the newspaper that this 'Hermione' had hit Harry with, and another picture. This picture depicts Harry smiling brightly, an arm hooked with the arm of a young woman. Tom assumed that this woman was Hermione. She had bushy hair, styled, but still bushy, as if it couldn't be tamed, though Harry can relate to that statement. She was classically beautiful, though she dimmed in comparison to Harry in Tom's opinion.</p><p>Tom blinked, where did that thought come from? He shook his head, refocusing on the pages. It was a pale yellow and slightly rough and thick like cardstock in his fingers. A slight twinge in his heart yet again at the picture of Harry had him reeling back. Was he going crazy? Had he gone absolutely bonkers? Because that tiny little pain unsettled him more than anything.</p><p>Tom swallowed. Maybe this <em>was</em> a book of dark rituals after all. But no, it couldn't be, magic didn't exist.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Despite the rational part of his brain screaming at him to <em>stop looking at the picture,</em> he continued to stare. He noticed a little scar on Harry's forehead, almost obscured by the amount of hair flying everywhere. It resembled something of a lightening bolt, though small and unnoticeable to anyone but Tom.</p><p>His eyes drifted to the background. A moderately busy street in what looked like London. A sign hung from one of the shops. Though it was slightly blurry, Tom could make out an M, a, and a P. It looked so familiar. Why did it look familiar?</p><p><em>"Madam </em><em>Puddifoot's</em><em>"</em> Tom muttered unconsciously with a nostalgic smile to his lips.</p><p>He gasped as he froze. What did he just say right now? Tom squeezed his eyes shut, rubbing his face. He felt that he had seen this before. <em>Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop was on High Street. It was horridly decorated but everyone from Hogwarts loved going there, Harry loved going there-</em></p><p>He opened his eyes. His heart started beating in anticipation. What was happening to him? Why was he feeling deja vu? He knows that he's never seen this place before. Hell, he didn't even know that it existed. He rubbed his eyes, standing up from his chair. It was getting late, maybe he just needed some sleep, he was working hard all day in all honesty.</p><p>He gently closed the book and left it on the dining table. He would go through the scrapbook tomorrow with a fresh pair of eyes. Maybe this was a result of sleep deprivation. As he settled into bed in his new house for the first time, he couldn't shake off the feeling that he knew that place. It felt so familiar that Tom had instantly relaxed when he saw the so familiar yet so foreign sign in the background.</p><p>But for now, he sleeps. He dreams of messy black hair and enchanting green eyes that go unremembered when he wakes the next morning.</p>
