    <p>Self-consciously, I tugged down the hem of my tight black mini dress.</p><p>I usually only had to perform on Thursdays nights but today's act had gotten the flu and asked me to fill in.<br/>
Not minding the extra cash I would make, I agreed.</p><p>Quickly, I rehearsed the last few words in my head, before stepping out on the small stage, The Three Broomsticks had set up.<br/>
The guests didn’t pay me any attention and continued to down their drinks, glasses clinking, people chatting away.<br/>
One of the waitresses rushed to me, giving me a mic.<br/>
I smiled at her and sat down on the single barstool that stood in the centre of the stage.<br/>
Soft music started playing and a few people in the audience looked my way, noticing that the musical entertainment for the evening had arrived.<br/>
The words came naturally to me as I sang the well-rehearsed tune.<br/>
My eyes moved above the guests' heads, that way they would feel addressed and I didn’t get thrown off by their faces.</p><p>I continued like that, one song after another, relaxing as the audience faded away and there was nothing but me and the music left.</p><p>____________</p><p>Lupin was exhausted. He had spent his entire day looking over tests his students in all seven years had written.<br/>
But after sitting in his classroom for hours on end, he couldn’t bear to stay there.<br/>
Therefore he had swiftly grabbed his coat, the remaining tests to grade and made his way to his favourite pub to grab a drink and have a change of scenery.<br/>
He sat alone at one of the tables towards the end, sipping on a glass of fire whiskey.<br/>
He did his very best to tune out any sound made by the others, something that had taken quite the while because of his werewolf hearing but he had mastered over the years.<br/>
That was why he hadn’t noticed the music when it started.<br/>
But when a silky voice reached his ears he immediately turned his head looking for the source of the sweet sounds.<br/>
To his surprise, the woman he saw on the stage was none other than Avery Canmore, one of his students.<br/>
What is she doing here?, he had never heard of a student being allowed outside of Hogwarts on a school day. Especially not at this time and surely not for work.<br/>
The questions however quickly faded out of his mind and Remus found himself getting lost in her gentle lullabies.<br/>
Avery looked older, with her blonde hair in a low ponytail, strands at the front falling out.</p><p>The other visitors of the three broomsticks suffered a similar fate.<br/>
Most of the chatter had died down and many now watched the young witch as she poured her soul into the soft melody.<br/>
Of course, her voice was not all that they paid attention to.<br/>
Some of the men had their gazes fixed on her revealed legs or her plump breasts that strained against the thin satin fabric.</p><p>When Remus Lupin noticed this, he felt a surge of anger.<br/>
It was entirely inappropriate for them to look at her that way.</p><p>_____________</p><p>Hitting the last note of that specific song had always been a bit tricky for me but when I closed my eyes and concentrated I actually did it.<br/>
Proud of that, a wide smile graced my lips and I got up, bowing for the audience.<br/>
They cheered and I was happy with how tonight went.<br/>
I hurriedly left the stage before it got awkward and went behind the bar to see Jones.<br/>
A fifty-year-old, brown-haired woman with the kindest chocolate eyes.<br/>
She was the witch that had actually gotten me the job in the first place and though we weren’t friends, I liked her.<br/>
"You did well today.", she spoke with an American accent and opened the register, taking out 4 Galleons and 16 sickles.<br/>
"Thanks, Jones.", I laughed and grabbed my long coat and bag, slinging it over my shoulder and leaving my coat draped over my forearm.<br/>
Taking the money from her hands, I stuffed it into my wallet.<br/>
Exchanging a bit of small talk, I decided it was time for me to return back to Hogwarts.<br/>
"I’ll get going now.", I laughed, "See ya next Thursday."<br/>
Jones nodded and I slipped from behind the bar towards the exit.<br/>
Cool autumn air greeted me as soon as I exited the stuffy pub.<br/>
Sighing, I started to walk towards Hogwarts, a tight grip on my purse. I had only taken a few steps when I heard someone calling my name.<br/>
"Miss Canmore."<br/>
Turning around, I came face to face Professor Lupin.<br/>
The tall Defense against the dark arts teacher greeted me with a kind smile.<br/>
I was startled by his sudden appearance and slightly embarrassed. Did he hear me sing?<br/>
Wearing a hint of nothing didn’t help with me being slightly uncomfortable and feeling exposed.<br/>
"Professor. I didn’t expect to see you here."</p><p>"I could say the same for you.", he said and chuckled.</p><p>I cleared my throat and started to walk, Professor Lupin next to me.<br/>
"I sometimes work in The Three Broomsticks. Usually not on Mondays though. Had to fill in for someone else."</p><p>"Well, I enjoyed your performance. You are quite the talented singer."<br/>
So he did hear me sing., I noted.</p><p>"Thank you, sir. I appreciate it."</p><p>I was not sure as to why I was embarrassed. My dormmates heard me sing all the time.<br/>
Maybe I was scared of being judged for working such a lousily paid job.</p><p>But Professor Lupin surely was not like that, he, himself was often spotted wearing worn-out clothes.<br/>
We continued walking next to each other, neither of us speaking a word until I broke the silence.</p><p>"Professor, I must ask something of you, sir."<br/>
My voice was quiet and for a second I feared that he didn't even hear me.<br/>
But when he stopped walking and raised one of his eyebrows, I knew he had.<br/>
"Of course, how can I help?", he asked and I was not sure whether he sounded amused or concerned.</p><p>"This job.", I started nervously, "How do I put this.."</p><p>Lupin reassuringly laid a hand on my shoulder and for a second I was thrown off by how nice his cool fingers felt on my bare shoulder.</p><p>"My peers would not approve of me working here."</p><p>His eyebrows knitted together in a frown. "I don't understand, Miss Canmore. Why would your classmates disapprove of your ambition to make money?"</p><p>Of course he didn't understand, I thought. He used to be a Gryffindor.<br/>
"With all respect, Sir. I don't expect you to understand. Not all my fellow students would disapprove but everyone in my house would. We are expected to excel and not to settle for anything but the best. Working as a wannabe singer in a pub does not fulfil that requirement. So all I am asking you for is to keep this between us."<br/>
I hadn't noticed how harsh my voice had gotten until I saw the shock on my Professors face.</p><p>He waited for a while before replying.<br/>
"Avery, if I may call you that, ", he spoke softly, "you are not a wannabe singer. You have a wonderful voice and you are already earning money despite not having graduated from school yet. It is, if anything, admirable."<br/>
Taken back by his words, I was, for once, rendered speechless.</p><p>Was it really? Until then I had always thought about it as something to be ashamed of. Most pureblood families in my year gave their children allowances so high, they could buy entire stores empty and still have money left.<br/>
My parents, though wealthy, refused to give me any money until I aced my final exams.<br/>
"I'm not sure the others would see it the same way, sir.", I replied after a while.</p><p>It didn't matter if he was right or not, if the others found out, I would be the talk of the house.<br/>
Neither of us talked again after that.<br/>
The sounds of shoes on the ground filling the tense silence between us.<br/>
As soon as we got close to the caste, I put on my coat, wrapping it tightly around my body, covering the mini dress I had on underneath.</p><p>Professor Lupin accompanied me to the staircase where we bid our goodbyes and I hurriedly made my way down the stairs.</p>
