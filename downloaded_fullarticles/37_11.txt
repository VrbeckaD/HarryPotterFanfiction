  <em>Autumn 2019</em>
</p>
<p align="center">*.*.*.*.*</p>
<p>Lily Rose, Aisling, and Scorpius walked into the Great Hall for lunch, heading towards their usual table. They were allowed to sit with their friends from other houses on the weekends. Hermione had suggested it when she became a professor, and the new policy did a lot to foster acceptance between the students. Rivalry for the House and Quidditch Cups still existed of course, but it wasn't as hostile as it had been in the past. Or so Lily Rose had been told… she had never experienced anything other than a regular competitive spirit. Now it was more about having bragging rights over your friends. Slytherin was less focused on Pureblood pedigree too; even Muggle-borns were being sorted there.</p>
<p>The Ravenclaw trio slid into chairs at the round table, greeting the others. Freddie and Lucy were the lone Gryffindor and Slytherin representatives; Molly and Louis had been sorted into Hufflepuff. Once it would have been unthinkable to have Weasleys who weren't also Gryffindors, but it just proved how things were changing. Scorpius was the first Malfoy in about seventy years who hadn't been placed in Slytherin. Individuality was more important to this generation than following in their family's footsteps.</p>
<p>"Lily, why is your hair straight?" Louis asked from across the table.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm just trying something new." She had used Sleekeazy's last night after her shower. The potion had transformed her frizzy curls into a shiny chestnut mane that fell halfway down her back. "What do you think?"</p>
<p>"It's nice, but I prefer it curly."</p>
<p>"Well, I think it looks fantastic, Lily. Very chic," Lucy said.</p>
<p>She smiled. "Thanks. I like it too."</p>
<p>Lucy's appearance was always changing. This week, her long hair was tomato red. Molly was the opposite: she usually secured her strawberry-blonde curls into a messy bun. Out of all of them, Aisling's looks had changed the least; her hair was still inky blue and shoulder-length.</p>
<p>"You trying to impress someone, Lils?" Freddie asked, smirking.</p>
<p>"No, not really," she replied in a nonchalant tone.</p>
<p>He chuckled. "You're a terrible liar. Who is it?"</p>
<p>"I'm not telling."</p>
<p>Freddie draped his arm over the back of Aisling's chair. "Ash, you know, don't you?" She shook her head and he leaned in closer. "If you tell me, I'll buy you some chocolate at Honeydukes," he said in his most persuasive tone.</p>
<p>Her pale cheeks flooded with color. She had a bit of a crush on Freddie, and would usually do favors for him whenever he asked.</p>
<p>Lucy kicked him under the table. "You should have been in Slytherin with me. You'll do anything to get your way."</p>
<p>The eldest Weasley clutched his chest dramatically. "That hurts, Luce. I happen to have a noble, principled soul."</p>
<p>"What a joke!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, you might be a Gryffindor, but you're not very chivalric," Molly added.</p>
<p>"Hey, I play fair in Quidditch, and I treat girls like queens!"</p>
<p>That was true enough, but Lucy continued to argue with her cousin. They were always clashing like this because of their strong personalities. Everyone at the table was in a good mood – except for Louis – who couldn't hide his dejected expression. He had always been an open book when it came to his feelings. Lily Rose didn't like hurting her friend, but what could she do when she fancied someone else?</p>
<p>Scorpius tactfully changed the subject to the Halloween costume party. "I'm going as a vampire from the Victorian era. My mum sent me some ancient dress robes from my third or fourth great-grandfather. What is everyone else going as?"</p>
<p>"Merida from the Disney movie <em>Brave</em>," Molly replied. "I even have the bow and arrows."</p>
<p>"I want to be someone glamorous," Lucy said. "Maybe a flapper from the 1920s."</p>
<p>Lily Rose was dressing up as Arwen from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. "Luna is making me the red velvet gown she wore in the film."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm going as the Big Bad Wolf," Freddie announced. "I'm trying to talk Ash into being Little Red Riding Hood, but I don't think she finds my irony amusing."</p>
<p>Lucy tossed a piece of breaded chicken at him. "It isn't, you insensitive prat!"</p>
<p>To their surprise, Aisling started to giggle. "It is kind of funny when you think about it. Maybe I should. It will only be an inside joke between us after all."</p>
<p>Freddie's face broke into a grin. "Really? I knew my humor would rub off on you eventually!" Then he picked up the piece of chicken and popped it in his mouth.</p>
<p>"What about you, Louis?" Lily Rose asked.</p>
<p>He shrugged. "I dunno, maybe Thor. They sell those costumes in Muggle shops so it would be easy enough to get."</p>
<p>This was the first year that Hogwarts would be having a costume party. As one of the new Ravenclaw Prefects, Lily Rose had suggested it to the Head Boy and Girl, who thought it was a great idea.</p>
<p>When they finished eating, the group of seven headed outside to enjoy the beautiful autumn day.</p>
<p>"Let's go down to the lake," Freddie suggested.</p>
<p>They ran into Adam Bentley on the way there. Her crush did a double take. "Lily Rose Potter, is that you?" he teased. "Your hair looks really pretty like that."</p>
<p>"Thank you," she replied, blushing.</p>
<p>Adam was a sixth-year Prefect who also played Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He had the same bright energy as Teddy, which is why she had been drawn to him (it also didn't hurt that he had sculpted cheekbones like a Greek god's).</p>
<p>He flashed her a dimpled smile. "I'll see you at the Prefect meeting tonight."</p>
<p>"Yeah, see you, Adam."</p>
<p>"So that's the bloke you fancy, huh?" Freddie asked when they walked further down the hill. "Listen, Lils, I've been teammates with him for two years, and he isn't worthy of your admiration."</p>
<p>She met his brown eyes. "Why do you say that?"</p>
<p>"Because he's dated loads of girls."</p>
<p>Hearing that did bother her, but she wouldn't write him off just because of his past. "People can change, Freddie."</p>
<p>He shook his head. "And some people don't want to."</p>
<p>"Oh, lay off." Lucy turned to her. "I think you have great taste. Adam Bentley is gorgeous, intelligent, and a great athlete."</p>
<p>Freddie made a noise of disgust. "I'm not gonna listen to this rubbish. Come on, Louis – let's go down to the Quidditch pitch. We can get some flying in," he said, dragging his cousin off..</p>
<p>Lily Rose sighed. "I didn't want Louis to find out this way."</p>
<p>"It's better for him to get used to the idea now," Molly said sensibly, "that way it'll be less of a shock if you start dating Adam."</p>
<p>She waved her hand in dismissal. "Oh, I highly doubt that will happen. He's really popular."</p>
<p>"Did you completely miss him flirting with you just now?" Lucy asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>She laughed. "No, I got that much, but it doesn't mean anything. You heard what Freddie said about him."</p>
<p>"I think he was just bashing him for Louis' benefit. You have to trust your own judgment, Lily."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose so," she agreed.</p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>*.*.*</strong>
</p>
<p>Hufflepuff's first match of the season was against Gryffindor. Louis sat in the locker room and listened to their captain, Ajax Okorie, give the pep talk.</p>
<p>"Our team is just as strong as Gryffindor's this year, but we have to play smart. Their Chasers are fast, and they will try to draw you into penalties. Do not fall for it." The tall black boy turned to their Seeker, Mina Hightower. "Tachibana has a Firebolt Meteor, so you won't be able to outfly her. Just try to spot the Snitch before she does."</p>
<p>"I'll do my best," Mina replied.</p>
<p>"Other than that, you know what our strategy is," Ajax said. "Let's get out there and have some fun!"</p>
<p>His fellow Chaser, Agni Singh, threw an arm around his shoulders. "Ready to score some goals on that prat Bentley?"</p>
<p>He grinned. "You know I am."</p>
<p>"Me and Danielle will do our bit, so you make sure you're open for the passes."</p>
<p>Louis nodded.</p>
<p>Callum Peterson thumped him on the back. "You got this, Ace. We'll take care of the Bludgers."</p>
<p>"Yeah, thanks." Louis was the leading goal scorer for the team, so the Beaters always made sure to cover him.</p>
<p>Flying instructor Oliver Wood asked the Captains to shake hands. Ajax was over a head taller than Hugh Hamilton, but the Gryffindor Chaser didn't seem intimidated.</p>
<p>"Mount your brooms," Wood said, waiting until the players were ready. "Three, two, one – go!"</p>
<p>Louis kicked off at the whistle. Danielle Archer knocked one of the Gryffindor Chasers aside to snag the Quaffle. He flew beside her as the three Hufflepuffs zoomed towards the Gryffindor end – their yellow robes snapping behind them. They threw some quick passes, trying to confuse the Keeper on who would be taking the shot. Agni gave a whistle and Louis got into position, catching the drop pass a moment later. He tucked the Quaffle through the hoop before Bentley even had a chance to react. Scoring on the older boy felt fantastic. <em>Watch me, Lily,</em> Louis thought. <em>I'll prove that I'm a better player!</em></p>
<p>He became a target after scoring two more goals. Callum and Tony Shapiro handled the Bludgers as promised, but the Gryffindor Chasers got in his way whenever they could. Louis didn't mind though because it allowed Danielle and Agni to show off their skills.</p>
<p>The score was 90-50 Hufflepuff when Mina Hightower spotted the Snitch. Freddie swung his bat, sending a Bludger zooming after her. "Mina, watch out!" Louis shouted. The Hufflepuff Seeker had to roll sideways to avoid being hit.</p>
<p>"And it looks like Freddie Weasley just saved the match," bellowed the announcer.</p>
<p>The commotion allowed Agni to steal the Quaffle from Brigid Flynn. "Louis!" he called, throwing the red ball towards him. He caught it, tucked it under his arm, and dodged around a player. And then Louis was racing across the pitch on a breakaway. He glanced over his shoulder, but Agni and Danielle were too far behind. It was just him and Adam Bentley now. The Gryffindor Keeper held his arms out wide as he sped towards him. Louis got him out of position by swerving to the right; then he shot upwards and threw the Quaffle as hard as he could. The crowd let out a roar as it sailed through the top hoop.</p>
<p>"What a spectacular goal by Hufflepuff Chaser, Louis Weasley!" the announcer yelled. "Will anyone be able to top that today?"</p>
<p>Everything was going great until Kaede Tachibana dove for the Snitch. Mina tried to catch up, but it was no use; the Gryffindor Seeker got there first. Louis watched the scarlet-robed players celebrate on the pitch. It was a painful moment because they had played so well. It seemed unfair that a flashy broom had defeated them.</p>
<p>When he got back to the locker room, Mina was crying. "I'm so sorry that I let everyone down!"</p>
<p>Ajax pulled the small Seeker into a hug. "Shh, none of that. You almost won it for us."</p>
<p>A few players murmured consoling words, but Louis was too exhausted to say anything. He sat down on a bench and started taking off his gear.</p>
<p>"You did everything right, mate," Agni said, ruffling his hair. "Be proud of how you played today."</p>
<p>"I am." Although the feeling was a hollow one.</p>
<p>Louis went into the boys showering area to finish undressing. He caught a glimpse of his scrawny upper body in the mirror. Whatever confidence he had gained from scoring on Adam Bentley evaporated. <em>I can't compete with him off the pitch. </em>He didn't hate the sixth-year Gryffindor, he envied him. Louis wanted to be older and taller and more muscular. He wanted to be someone who Lily Rose would look at with admiration in her eyes. <em>Will she always see me as a little boy, begging for attention? No, isn't that how I see myself? </em>Louis knew the real problem was his own insecurity.</p>
<p>He took a long shower and tried to figure out what to do. The only solution he could come up with was to literally grow up. <em>I know I'll feel better about myself if I look like a man</em>. Or he hoped so anyway. <em>For now, I just have to be patient.</em> Louis had been waiting his whole life after all… a year or two more wouldn't make much of a difference. <em>It will if Lily falls for someone else, </em>his inner-voice reminded him.</p>
<p>When he left the locker room twenty minutes later, Scorpius and Molly were waiting for him. "What took you so long?" his cousin asked. "Were you trying to drown yourself?"</p>
<p>"Something like that."</p>
<p>"Lily was here for a bit, but Adam invited her to a party in the Room of Requirement. Ash and Lucy went too."</p>
<p>He groaned. "Oh, that's just great." Louis felt as though the universe was having a laugh at him.</p>
<p>"You'll feel better once you eat something," Scorpius added.</p>
<p>But Louis knew that he wouldn't. "Let's skip the kitchens today. I'm not in the mood."</p>
<p>"No way – we always go after a match!" Molly cried. "Plus, you shouldn't be alone right now."</p>
<p>Louis didn't have the energy to argue.</p>
<p>"You scored some fantastic goals today," Scorpius said as they headed towards the castle. "Lily Rose was cheering for you."</p>
<p>His miserable mood lifted somewhat. "Was she?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and she wanted to tell you how awesome you played," he replied.</p>
<p>Louis was angry at himself for moping in the locker-room. <em>If I hadn't, Lily would be walking beside me right now – she wouldn't be at a party with Adam bloody Bentley!</em></p>
<p>Molly seemed to read his mind. "There's going to be a lot of people at that party. It's not like Lily is on a date with him alone."</p>
<p>He let out a frustrated sigh. "Yeah, I know." But Louis didn't have a good feeling about it. <em>He'll probably make his move tonight, and there's nothing I can do to stop him.</em></p>
<p align="center">
  <strong>*.*.*</strong>
</p>
<p>Lily Rose liked parties if they were small and not too loud. Unfortunately, the one in the Room of Requirement was neither. Many people were dancing to a wizard rock song; more were clustered around refreshment tables, or sitting at pub-style booths. She knew right away that Aisling wouldn't enjoy being here. Her best friend had a difficult time with chaos because of her heightened senses. Lily Rose found an empty booth at the back of the room. When they sat down, she cast a quieting charm that encased them in a kind of invisible barrier, dulling the noise around them.</p>
<p>Lucy rolled her eyes. "What is the point of coming to a party if you're just going to separate yourself from it?"</p>
<p>"It's only this one booth. You can go out there if you want to," Lily Rose said. Lucy often overlooked the fact that Aisling was a werewolf and an introvert.</p>
<p>"I'll get us some snacks. Come with me, Lily."</p>
<p>They ran into Baz Hakim (the other fifth-year Gryffindor Beater) at the refreshment table. His dark eyes lit up when he spotted them. "Hey, ladies! Didn't know you would be here!" he shouted over the music.</p>
<p>"Adam Bentley invited Lily and I tagged along," Lucy told him.</p>
<p>Baz turned to her. "You the girl he has his eye on now?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure… I hope so," Lily Rose replied.</p>
<p>He draped an arm around her. "Potter, I don't know why you like that white boy when you could have me."</p>
<p>She laughed. "Do you ever stop flirting?"</p>
<p>"Nope," Baz said with a crooked grin.</p>
<p>Lucy removed his arm. "Then flirt with me – Lily's heart is already taken."</p>
<p>He gave her an appraising look. "You want to dance, firecracker?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Lucy took his hand and pulled him onto the dance floor.</p>
<p>Lily Rose smiled as she watched them together. They certainly made a striking pair. Lucy's fiery locks and porcelain complexion contrasted nicely with Baz's black hair and tan skin. <em>I hope Freddie doesn't see them though… </em>Baz was a good friend of his, but she knew that he wouldn't want such a flirtatious guy interested in his younger cousin. Freddie always played the "overprotective big brother" when it concerned the girls in his life.</p>
<p>She started piling sweets onto a plate. Lily Rose was reaching for two bottles of butterbeer when someone touched her upper back. She glanced over and saw Adam smiling down at her; sandy hair falling over his brow in tousled waves. He looked casually handsome in a light-blue pullover and black jeans.</p>
<p>"Hi," she said, returning his smile.</p>
<p>He bent to kiss her cheek. "I'm glad you could make it."</p>
<p>She blushed happily. "Yeah, thanks for inviting me."</p>
<p>"No problem. I'll get the butterbeers for you." He grabbed another one for himself and slipped an arm around her as they navigated their way through the crowd. Althea Darrow, one of the Gryffindor Chasers, shot them a dirty look as they passed by. <em>Yikes, what's that about? </em>she wondered.</p>
<p>Freddie was already with Aisling when they got back. He gave her a look that said, <em>'I am not pleased with you.' </em>Lily Rose set the plate down and slid into the booth. "Hi, Freddie – congrats on your win."</p>
<p>Adam sat beside her. "Wow, it's a lot quieter in here. I can hear myself think again."</p>
<p>Freddie reached for a cauldron cake, muttering something snarky under his breath. Lily Rose introduced Adam and Aisling to each other. They were making small talk when Freddie said: "I'm surprised that you're here, Lils. I thought you'd be comforting Louis after his loss."</p>
<p>She sent him a warning glare. "Molly and Scorpius are with him."</p>
<p>"Are you talking about your cousin Louis?"</p>
<p>Freddie smirked. "That's right. He scored some wicked goals on you today, huh, Bentley?"</p>
<p>Adam let out a good-natured laugh. "Yeah, he's a flashy player alright. No worries though – my ego can take it as long as we win."</p>
<p>Freddie kept up his mildly antagonistic attitude for the next five minutes. Aisling put an end to it by asking him to dance. He brightened at the question. "Sure, Ash."</p>
<p>Lily Rose mouthed a silent <em>thank you. </em>Aisling gave her a little smile before sliding out of the booth.</p>
<p>"So, what do you think about dancing?"</p>
<p>She met Adam's hazel eyes. "I like it if they're slow songs."</p>
<p>"Hold on, let me check." He leaned out of the booth for a second and then ducked back in. "It is. Will you dance with me, Lily?"</p>
<p>Her stomach fluttered. "Yes."</p>
<p>Adam was about a foot taller than her, so she couldn't drape her arms around his neck. She rested her hands on his muscular chest, while he placed his on her waist. Lily Rose felt a zing of attraction when he pulled her closer.</p>
<p>"You look beautiful in that red dress," he whispered. "Gryffindor colors suit you."</p>
<p>"Thanks." She had chosen it with him in mind.</p>
<p>After the song ended, Adam introduced her to some of his friends. She spent the rest of the party hanging out with them. They were nice – they even included her in their conversations – but she felt a bit awkward anyway. Adam seemed to pick up on this because he leaned next to her ear and asked if she wanted to leave.</p>
<p>Lily Rose nodded.</p>
<p>"We're going to head out now," he announced. "See you guys later."</p>
<p>They said goodbye and left the noisy party. She hadn't realized how stuffy it was in there until they got out into the cool corridor.</p>
<p>"What time is it?"</p>
<p>Adam glanced at his wristwatch. "Just after six o'clock."</p>
<p>It was so quiet that she could hear the November rain hitting the windows.</p>
<p>"If it wasn't pouring right now, I'd ask you up to the Astronomy Tower so we could talk for a bit."</p>
<p>"Talking? Are you sure you don't mean something else?" she joked. The Astronomy Tower was a notorious snogging spot.</p>
<p>He gave her a sheepish grin. "Hey, don't get me wrong – I wouldn't say no to a kiss, but I'd like to find out more about you. We haven't had too many in-depth conversations before."</p>
<p>"That's true," she agreed. "We're always surrounded by other people."</p>
<p>"Why don't we change that? We could go to Hogsmeade together next weekend," he suggested.</p>
<p>Lily Rose smiled. "I'd like that."</p>
<p>"Brilliant – I can't wait." Adam reached over and took her hand. "Is this okay?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's fine." His palm was warm and much larger than her own. It felt nice.</p>
<p>"So, tell me some things you like to do?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I love reading and being with my friends. Just normal stuff really. What about you?"</p>
<p>"Most everything I do revolves around Quidditch or studying. I don't have time for much else."</p>
<p>She looked at him. "Do you want to be a professional player?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, definitely. But if I don't make it, I'll settle for the Magical Sports Department."</p>
<p>"My brother works there!"</p>
<p>His brow furrowed. "Wait, I thought he was still a kid?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm talking about Teddy Lupin. My mum and dad are his godparents and he's been with me my whole life. We may not be related by blood, but I think of him as my big brother."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see. Yeah, I remember him… he was a great Seeker for Hufflepuff. He helped them win a few championships if I'm not mistaken."</p>
<p>"He certainly did," she said proudly. "Teddy could have gone pro, but he didn't fancy all the traveling. He prefers to be near his family and friends."</p>
<p>"Right, I suppose that is a downside of playing Quidditch. It's always been my dream though, so I'd be able to make that sacrifice. What about you? Do you have any careers in mind?"</p>
<p>"It's between two: a healer or an Unspeakable."</p>
<p>He grinned. "Those are nothing alike."</p>
<p>"Well, they both make a difference in their own way. With a Healer, I could help people directly, and with the Department of Mysteries, I'd be making fascinating discoveries. So either one would be fulfilling for me."</p>
<p>"Wow, I'm impressed. You've given this some thought, huh?"</p>
<p>"Just a bit. It is my O.W.L year after all; I have to be prepared."</p>
<p>"Most of the sixth-years I know barely have a clue on what they want to do. Talking to someone who is serious about their future is refreshing."</p>
<p>"Really? You don't think I'm a nerd? Freddie calls me one all the time."</p>
<p>Adam laughed. "Maybe you are, but you're the cutest nerd I've ever met."</p>
<p>Her stomach did a flip. "Thank you."</p>
<p>"And you're really sweet too," he added. "I like being around you."</p>
<p>Lily Rose gave him a shy smile. "I feel the same way. To be honest, you remind me a lot of Teddy."</p>
<p>"Do I?" he asked, looking surprised. "But he was the Hogwarts golden boy… I feel mediocre most days."</p>
<p>She squeezed his hand. "Well you aren't mediocre to me."</p>
<p>He smiled. "Thanks, Lily. I'll try my best to be worthy of the comparison." They stopped in front of the spiral staircase that led to her common room. Adam gazed at her with his expressive hazel eyes. "Would you mind if I kissed you?"</p>
<p>"No, not at all," she replied, heart racing.</p>
<p>Lily Rose felt that same magnetic pull as he drew her towards him. She tipped her chin up expectantly, closing her eyes like people did in the movies. Adam's lips were soft and they tasted faintly of peppermint. It was a sweet kiss, but it left her wanting more.</p>
<p>"Kiss me again?" she murmured.</p>
<p>"Gladly." And this time, it was a proper kiss: one that left her breathless and flushed and weak in the knees. It was a good thing she was hanging onto his waist.</p>
<p>He rested his forehead against hers. "Who taught you how to kiss like that?"</p>
<p>She opened her eyes. "No one did." Lily Rose had only kissed one other boy before, but that had been nothing like what she just experienced.</p>
<p>Adam leaned back to look at her. "I shouldn't be surprised; you're good at everything."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not. I can't play Quidditch because my coordination is terrible."</p>
<p>"Is that why you can barely stand right now?" he teased.</p>
<p>Her face felt hot. "It's entirely your fault that I can't!"</p>
<p>He laughed and tightened his arms around her. "I would say I'm sorry, but this gives me an excuse to hold you longer."</p>
<p>She smiled up at him. "I really like you, Adam."</p>
<p>"I like you too," he said, stroking her hair. "Will you be my girlfriend, Lily?"</p>
<p>"Of course I will."</p>
<p>Adam kissed her one last time before letting her go. "Goodnight," he said, showing off his dimples. "I'll see you tomorrow at breakfast."</p>
<p>"Okay. Goodnight."</p>
<p>Lily Rose was dizzy with happiness as she climbed the spiral staircase. When she reached the top, she sat down on the floor and closed her eyes, reliving the moment again and again. The sound of approaching footsteps snapped her out of her daze. Aisling appeared a moment later.</p>
<p>"What happened? Are you all right?" she asked, extending a hand to help her up.</p>
<p>"I'm more than all right." Lily Rose threw her arms around Aisling's neck. "Adam kissed me and we're going out now!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Lily, that's wonderful! Let's go up to our room – I want to hear all about it."</p>
<p>Aisling solved the riddle and they stepped inside, giggling. A group of students who were trying to study shushed them, but they only laughed harder. Nothing could bother Lily Rose today; she was floating on air.</p>
