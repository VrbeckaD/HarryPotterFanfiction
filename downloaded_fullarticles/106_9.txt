    <p>It began at the Ministry’s Yule Gala.</p>
<p>Harry had arrived late, having scoured the entirety of his office <em><b>and</b></em> the clerks files for the damned report about the practicality of kneazles being used as bait in cursed buildings. His robes were askew when he entered the lush ballroom, and he was humiliated by his unkempt appearance. <em><b>And</b></em> he hadn’t managed to file the report for Head Auror Robards on time. As the lead Auror on the experiment he would be the one to blame for it.</p>
<p>Even though it was <u>Malfoy’s</u> motherfucking fault. And this wasn’t the first instance of Draco purposefully forgetting to file a report with Harry.</p>
<p>As Harry arrived at the gala, he saw the smug blonde git standing across the room, champagne held aloft with a superior, and totally undeserved, grace. His little wife Astoria stood next to him, nervous and shy as Draco led the conversation with French dignitaries using a poise and haughty air only a Malfoy could possess.</p>
<p>Snatching a whiskey off the tray that whisked his way, held by no one but magic itself, Harry downed the drink in a silent acknowledgement of his ire. He stood glaring at Malfoy, who leant in to his conversation partners and laughed alongside them dutifully and with smooth social skill.</p>
<p>It pissed Harry off. He grabbed another whiskey just to dampen the rage but it only served to increase it.</p>
<p>“You look like you’re about to kill him,” Ron observed when he came to stand next to Harry.</p>
<p>“It’s a distinct possibility,” Harry confirmed. “The fucking wanker does it on purpose you know?”</p>
<p>“Does what?”</p>
<p>“Put me in the shit all the time,” Harry grumbled. “Missing reports, showing me up, putting me down in meetings... the lot of it!”</p>
<p>“He’s Malfoy,” Ron said calmly. “What else do you expect?”</p>
<p>Harry had simply shrugged, and took another whiskey off the tray that passed him. He said nothing else to Ron, and when the continually harried Hermione joined their party, she seemed to take wise stock of Harry’s fury and paid it no mind.</p>
<p>After ten minutes of scowling at the oblivious Malfoy, Harry left his friends to pretend to talk to a hovering witch he knew somewhat fancied him, so he could get a better view of the poncy prat.</p>
<p>When Malfoy left the company of his doting, sweet and out-of-her-depth wife to walk in the direction of the loos, Harry made a (rather sharp) apology to the witch he had been conversing with, and swept straight out of the room in the direction of Malfoy.</p>
<p>He hovered outside the loos for several minutes until Malfoy came out, and when the tall, smirking git appeared, Harry grabbed the front of his robes and used Malfoy’s surprise as leverage to thrust him backwards and to the left down a hallway.</p>
<p>Harry laid the first punch, knocking Draco straight back, so the man stumbled on his feet. It gave Harry just enough time to whisper a silencing spell around them.</p>
<p>Harry stalked after Draco, and before Draco could grab his wand, he landed a punch straight to the gut.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you doing, Potter?” Draco gasped, wounded.</p>
<p>“You set me right up, didn’t you?” Harry pushed Draco back, and in the process, Harry took a right hook that landed on his chin.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Draco growled as he grabbed the front of Harry’s robes and aimed his knee at Harry’s crotch.</p>
<p>“That,” Harry began, dodging Draco’s knee, “Fucking. Kneazle. Report.”</p>
<p>Harry pushed Draco back against the wall and held Draco in place with his arm across his chest. They were millimetres apart, and Draco tried to push back but Harry’s posture prevented him.</p>
<p>“You’re pathetic,” Draco said. He spat in Harry’s face, with the spit reaching Harry’s cheek and the corner of his mouth. “And drunk.” Draco managed to wrap an arm around Harry and tug his hair back, exposing his throat.</p>
<p>He leaned in, intending to bite Harry, but Harry stamped on his foot and moved away swiftly. Draco, seeing the opportunity, rushed after him and gave him a stinging slap across the face.</p>
<p>“Urgh!” Harry yelled with guttural force. “You are such a fucking sissy.”</p>
<p>“You don’t even know how to be a proper wizard,” Draco tackled Harry to the ground. “Look at you... debasing yourself to fight like a muggle!”</p>
<p>“You’re fighting back, you entitled arse. I’ve had a-fucking-nough with you...”</p>
<p>Harry squirmed under Draco, tugging Draco’s hair back viciously and reaching to slap Draco’s lower back. The slap landed straight on Draco’s arse.</p>
<p>Draco groaned, and Harry wasn’t sure what to make of the tone of it. Changing course, he found leverage and kicked Draco off him, and Draco flew back.</p>
<p>Splayed on his back, Harry knelt over Draco and pulled him up by Draco’s tie. With Draco’s face inches from Harry’s, Harry seethed. “I want that fucking report, right fucking now!”</p>
<p>“And I want my cock so far down your throat you gag.”</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t help the way he stilled and his eyes went wide. Draco looked up at him, challenging him, unashamed. Harry accepted Draco’s statement as completely factual.</p>
<p>Harry took a few deep breaths in and out before he replied. “I think your arse should be fucked so hard you are forced to apologise for everything you are, you absolute excuse for a man.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have it in you,” Draco jibed. “Such a prim little Saviour...”</p>
<p>“Get in that fucking office Malfoy,” Harry demanded, pulling Draco up and shoving him against the nearest door.</p>
<p>Draco stumbled inside and didn’t see it coming when Harry, having locked the door, forced Draco to his knees and tried to undo his trousers.</p>
<p>“No. Fucking. Way!” Draco snapped, tugging Harry violently down by his belt.</p>
<p>They ended up tussling again, rolling about the floor and knocking into furniture roughly.</p>
<p>“You smell like whiskey,” Draco told Harry with disgust. “How much did you drink in the half hour you were at the party?”</p>
<p>“It had to be only half hour didn’t it?” Harry replied as he gained dominance. “Spent all evening panicking about a <em><b>fucking report on kneazles that you should have submitted to me weeks ago</b></em>!”</p>
<p>“I’ll never submit to you,” Draco hissed.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” Harry growled. “Yeah?!” He forced Draco to his knees by his throat, and then stood in front of him. He had his cock out, bobbing in front of Draco’s face within seconds. He revelled in the way Draco’s eyes opened in surprise at Harry’s nine inch and girthy as fuck cock. “Suck it.”</p>
<p>In a tell tale sign that Draco was very much okay with the order, he moaned deeply and made the first move to lean in and take what he could of Harry’s dick into his mouth.</p>
<p>“Quicker!” Harry snarled, grabbing the back of Draco’s head and forcing Draco to take Harry’s dick deep into his mouth. “Ugh! Fuck! Who’s gagging now, huh?”</p>
<p>There was spit pouring out of Draco’s mouth as he did indeed gag. When Harry ignored Draco’s first plea to pull off, Draco reached up and squeezed Harry’s balls so tight the man let out a yelp of pain.</p>
<p>Before Harry could react, Draco sent a tripping hex at Harry that sent him to the floor. Draco had his dick out of his smart black, tailored, trousers in moments, and pried Harry’s mouth open to take it.</p>
<p>He fucked Harry’s mouth for a minute or so, until Harry bit down slightly in warning and Draco sprang back rapidly.</p>
<p>Harry was up and pouncing on Draco instantly, dragging him up by the hair and flinging him on to his back upon the desk. Harry yanked Draco’s trousers down and off his prone body, uncaring about the fabric or the way the shoes ripped off Draco’s feet.</p>
<p>“For fucks sake, Potter... I know you have no idea of luxury items but those trousers are <em>Italian wool</em>!”</p>
<p>Harry paid no attention. He made sure his dick was all the way out of his clothes, and spat on his hand to slick it ready for fucking Draco. He then pushed Draco’s legs up enough to expose Draco’s arsehole, and then leaned in to spit on it crudely three times. He reached inside Draco with one finger, then two, and then three before lining himself up against Draco’s twitching hole.</p>
<p>“Please, no, Potter,” Draco begged, the tone suddenly desperately serious. “Please spell some lube. I can’t take anything that big this dry...”</p>
<p>“Do it yourself,” Harry growled, wordlessly summoning Draco’s wand from the floor. “You have a second to do it.”</p>
<p>Draco made haste, just as Harry’s tip breached his hole.</p>
<p>Harry took his time entering Draco fully. Draco’s eyes were tightly shut, his face screwed up and blossoming with bruises from Harry’s blows. Harry noticed that Draco’s lip was split, and he revelled in the sight of it.</p>
<p>As Harry began to thrust, Draco let out a series of moans that indicated he was very much enjoying Harry’s thick cock.</p>
<p>“You love this, don’t you?” Harry asked huskily. “I bet you lay back and take it from any man who lowers himself to give you a fuck... just like the absolute slut you’re showing yourself to be.”</p>
<p>“Shut the fuck up!”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to let you cum,” Harry told Draco with full certainty lacing his voice. “You’re not in control here. I am.”</p>
<p>“You will,” Draco assured, “or I will let everyone know you’re a poof.”</p>
<p>Harry fucked Draco harder. Draco slid back and forth on the desk, messing everything up upon it.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t risk your little wife finding out about this.”</p>
<p>Draco, lost in the throws of an ecstasy laced with pain as Harry leaned up and pinched his nipple so hard he thought Harry might pull it off, reached down to grab his straining cock.</p>
<p>“I really don’t want you to enjoy this,” Harry murmured, taking his chance to slap Draco’s hand away.</p>
<p>“Tough fucking luck. I’m enjoying it already,” Draco replied, “you don’t always get what you want Potter. It’s a lesson you have to learn.”</p>
<p>“I want that report,” Harry warned him as his pace and facial expression suggested Harry’s imminent release, “or I’m going to fuck you again and I promise you now, you won’t get to cum then either.”</p>
<p>“Try me,” Draco challenged.</p>
<p>Harry slapped Draco. “Slut... fucking queer, closeted slut.”</p>
<p>“Says you Potter,” Draco goaded between gasps of enjoyment, “closeted... uh... fag.”</p>
<p>“Ha! You’re the one in an arranged marriage... Merlin, you’re an absolute... I feel sorry for you...” Harry came hard, fast, pounding until he spilt every drop of cum into Draco.</p>
<p>“Get out of me!” Draco snarled, pushing Harry back the best he could, denying Harry the chance to bask in the afterglow.</p>
<p>Harry respected Draco’s wishes enough to pull out slowly, smirking all the while. He then made himself decent again as Draco scrambled on the desk. “Cheers, that was... okay.” Harry turned to leave.</p>
<p>Draco grabbed him by the arm, turning him around. “You do not get to leave me hanging, Potter,” Draco told him, rubbing his cock in his hand. He looked Harry straight in the eye and positioned himself against Harry’s groin. With his free hand, he unfastened and pulled Harry’s trousers and boxers down before cumming all over Harry’s softening dick.</p>
<p>“What the fuck?” Harry asked, disgusted.</p>
<p>“There,” Draco gasped, “have a little reminder of me for the rest of the evening.”</p>
<p>“You’re perverted.”</p>
<p>“And apparently, so are you.” Draco muttered, making himself look presentable before fleeing, Harry guessed, to the men’s toilets.</p>
<p>Harry stood in the messy office, smiling.</p>
