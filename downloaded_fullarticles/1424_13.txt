    <p>“You have three seconds before I slam this door in your face, Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco was already starting to regret this decision. Every functioning cell in his brain was screaming at him to walk away, but the plan had already been constructed. The only element missing was her. </p><p>He would fake a smile, but Draco knew it wouldn’t fool anyone. Although, if she did agree, he’d have to get much better at concealing his true emotions towards her. </p><p>“I have a proposal for you.”</p><p>Granger stared at him suspiciously, and he could almost believe that no time at all had passed since their days of perpetual antagonism at Hogwarts. Her hair was just as bushy, her glare was just as sharp, and her stubbornness was just as evident. As anticipated, she wasn’t going to make this easy.</p><p>Draco slowly exhaled, not backing out now. “Am I correct in assuming you’ve seen today’s <em>Prophet</em>?”</p><p>He extended a copy of the paper even though they both knew it was unnecessary. For the past several months, an unidentified group had been attacking Muggle communities throughout the English countryside. Yesterday’s freak windstorm in Wolverhampton was just the latest in a long series of alarming events.</p><p>Granger ignored the newspaper. Instead, she folded her arms across her chest, her unrelenting gaze continuing to point directly at Draco. “I am aware. Are you here to admit your involvement?”</p><p>“Absolutely not,” he hissed. Animosity boiled inside him at the mere accusation. It was snap judgements like this that he had had more than enough of. “My family and I are no longer involved in those practices or beliefs.”</p><p>A loud scoff filled the space between them. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”</p><p>It took considerable energy for Draco to prevent the sneer on his lips from deepening. “Funny you should mention that,” he managed instead. Draco stuck one hand in his pocket, his thumb running over the smooth exterior of the box. “That brings me back to my proposal.” He lifted an eyebrow. “You want to make these attacks stop?”</p><p>“Obviously.” She narrowed her gaze, unsure where he was going with this.</p><p>Draco nodded. “Good. Then I believe I have a plan.”</p><p>He pulled out the small box for Granger to see, her gaze turning incredulous as she examined it.</p><p>“What is that?” she asked, though he could already tell she was starting to catch on.</p><p>With a flip of his thumb, the top of the box popped open, revealing the generations-old Malfoy family diamond ring.</p><p>“I told you,” Draco said. “I have a proposal for you.”</p><p>She gaped slightly at the sight of the invaluable heirloom but quickly regained her composure. “And what precisely are you <em>proposing?</em>”</p><p>Her curiosity safely sparked, Draco closed the box and returned it to his pocket. “Whoever is behind these attacks are almost certainly former Death Eaters,” Draco cooly explained. “It’s been years since the end of the war, and my family is more than ready to distance ourselves from all that once and for all. So what better way to prove that than by revealing to the public that you and I are betrothed?”</p><p>Granger kept her arms firmly folded across her chest as she began to work through his proposition. “I fail to see how I need to be implicated in this.”</p><p>“I’m so glad you asked,” Draco returned, a satisfied grin finding its way across his lips. “As you are well aware, there are plenty of pureblood supremacist holdouts. Imagine the potential impact it could have on Wizarding society if they see someone like you with someone like me.”</p><p>“Someone like <em>me</em>?” Granger scoffed again. “You expect me to believe you and your family have changed, yet apparently you still have an aversion to the word Muggle-born?” She huffed. “Consider me uninterested. Good day, Malfoy.”</p><p>The door began to swing closed, but Draco stuck his hand out to stop it.</p><p>“My family will pay you,” he bargained, but Granger remained unimpressed.</p><p>“I don’t want your money.” </p><p>She continued to press the door closed, and Draco began to panic, his chance nearly gone.</p><p>“Then I’ll beg!”</p><p>The pressure against the door began to lessen, and he could tell she was starting to reconsider.</p><p>“Think about it, Granger,” Draco said, detesting the pleading tone in his voice. “This could work. All we have to do is put on a few smiles and fake it for a month or two before we create a reason to go our separate ways and pretend it never happened.”</p><p>For several moments, she still didn’t respond, until, to Draco’s relief, she reopened the door.</p><p>“Fine,” she said, although she didn’t sound even mildly enthused. “But you need to ask me properly.”</p><p>“Alright,” Draco conceded. He could agree to that term. “Granger, will you—”</p><p>“On one knee.”</p><p>She peered at him with a devious grin as Draco begrudgingly lowered himself towards the ground. He retrieved the ring from within his pocket and once more presented it to her.</p><p>“Granger,” he repeated, feeling another sneer coming on, “will you accept my proposal?”</p><p>Granger took the ring out of his hand.</p><p>“Yes,” she said. She slid the ring onto her finger, officially becoming the first non-pureblood to ever don the item. “But you and I will need to lay some ground rules.”</p><p align="center">~*~*~</p><p>“I still can’t believe you agreed to this,” Ron said, casting a sticking charm on the bottom of another box. “This whole thing is barking!”</p><p>After staying up with Malfoy until near one in the morning the night prior so that they could outline the expectations and limits for their new agreement, Hermione had wasted no time that Saturday morning before telling her two best friends. She had pounded on both of their doors, explained the situation to them, assured them that she hadn’t been put under an <em>Imperius</em> curse, and had dragged them back to her place to help.</p><p>That said, <em>none</em> of them were pleased with the current situation.</p><p>“Honestly, Hermione,” Harry agreed. “You sure this is a good idea?”</p><p>“I’ve already told you,” she said for what had to be the tenth time, “if a month or two of inconvenience can improve pureblood and Muggle-born relations and convince even a few witches and wizards to change their outdated mindset, then yes.”</p><p>The stack of books she had been carrying dropped inside the cardboard box with a <em>thump</em>, Hermione too on edge to care about her lack of more thoughtful placement.</p><p>“But moving into his place seems unnecessary,” Harry continued to argue.</p><p>Hermione groaned as she selected three more books from one of her bookshelves that she would be taking with her to Malfoy’s. “I agree, but he insisted that it would make our so-called engagement more believable. He refused to let it go, so it was my trade-off for being able to tell you two. I would not enter into this situation without you both knowing the truth.”</p><p>This was just one of the many aspects of their agreement they had spent several hours debating. They would move in together, but they would have separate bedrooms. They would call each other by their given names, but only in public. They would hold hands and <em>maybe</em> kiss when circumstances required, but absolutely no tongue was <em>ever</em> permitted.</p><p>“Have you told your parents yet?” Ron asked.</p><p>Hermione shook her head. “I need to figure out what I’m going to say first, if anything at all. They’re still overly protective since the war, and I don’t want to cause them more concern than necessary.” She let out a deep sigh. “Besides, it’s not like Malfoy and I are <em>actually</em> getting married, so do they really need to know?”</p><p>They packed the rest of the belongings Hermione intended to bring with her, leaving behind not much more than her furniture, kitchen supplies, and off-season clothing. Harry folded down the flaps of the last box and sealed it shut.</p><p>“That everything?” he asked, looking around Hermione’s flat.</p><p>A sinking feeling settled in Hermione’s gut as she did a final look-over. “It’s not as if I’m leaving here permanently,” she said, more to appease her own concerns than anyone else’s. “We have a two-month agreement for now, at which point we will reassess if a third month would be mutually beneficial for both of our end goals.”</p><p>“Plus it’s a good safe haven in case you ever need a break away from the bloke,” Ron added. “Godric knows you’ll need it.” </p><p>Hermione shrunk the boxes to the size of dice and gathered them in her pocket. She looked around her flat, taking in the emptiness.</p><p>She was doing this for a good cause. She just had to keep reminding herself that.</p><p>“Do me a favour, Harry?” Hermione asked before stepping into the Floo. “Make sure that finding these Death Eaters is your and the rest of the Aurors’ top priority. I’d prefer not to spend one more day living with Malfoy than necessary.” </p><p>“Trust me,” Harry resigned. “We’ll all sleep better when this is resolved.”</p><p>Her uneasiness and apprehension only slightly appeased, Hermione grabbed a handful of green powder and called for her new home.</p><p>Two months with Malfoy. She could survive that, right? After all, she had spent six years with him in the same castle. How much worse could it be?</p><p align="center">~*~*~</p><p>Draco removed a stack of <em>her</em> books from <em>his</em> shelf.</p><p>“How many times do I need to tell you? <em>My</em> books go on the top three shelves and <em>your</em> books go on the bottom three.”</p><p>Granger stomped into the sitting room from what used to be the guest bedroom but would now be hers for the next two months.</p><p>“And what’s so wrong with my books being there?” Granger commanded, blowing her bushy hair out of her face. “You weren’t using the space, so I see no harm with me putting my books there.”</p><p>Draco’s nose twitched at her remark. “It’s the principle,” he defended. “My flat, my rules, my shelf!”</p><p>“Pardon, but I believe this is now <em>our</em> flat,” she sneered, and Draco had to suck in all his anger to prevent an even worse blow out exploding between them. </p><p>“Our agreement clearly states that we will respect each other’s space and belongings, and that includes <em>my</em> bookshelves!” he seethed, hands clenched tight on either side. “Or do I once again need to refer back to our contract?”</p><p>The contract containing their agreed-upon terms was still laid out on the dining room table, already having been referenced three separate times since Granger had officially started moving in not two hours prior. If this was how they were handling one another so shortly in, he was dreading what the next two months had in store. There would undoubtedly be plenty of exasperating evenings and an uncountable number of pulsing headaches.</p><p>If he had it his way, Granger wouldn’t be living here. But no. When concocting this plan to help their family, his mother had had two non-negotiable conditions. One, she be given the family ring, and two, they move in together. Both had initially surprised Draco, considering both actions to be unnecessary for this facade of a relationship, but Narcissa asserted that if they were going to commit to this charade, then every aspect of it had to be believable.</p><p>That was easy for her to say. <em>She</em> didn’t have to live with the witch!</p><p>Draco looked down at his watch. Great. It was nearly a quarter till three.</p><p>He rubbed his temples, already feeling the first of many inevitable headaches.</p><p>“We’ll have to continue this argument later,” Draco resigned, mentally cursing this entire situation. “We have barely over twenty minutes until the meeting, and unless you want to doom this from the beginning, I suggest you put on something different than jeans and a t-shirt.”</p><p>Mercifully, Granger didn’t fight him on that. That said, she still huffed at him and stormed into her bedroom, slamming the door shut.</p><p>Dear Merlin, this better be worth it.</p><p align="center">~*~*~</p><p>“I trust you haven’t forgotten the story,” Granger harshly whispered as they proceeded down the corridor.</p><p>“And I trust <em>you</em> will be able to put on a convincing enough act?” Draco snapped in response.</p><p>Both equally displeased with the other, they walked the rest of the way to the office without another word until they reached the desired door.</p><p>Draco had to force the grimace off his face, which, remarkably, was harder than he would have anticipated. Somehow, this little stunt was even more aggravating than he had mentally allotted. He glanced once more at Granger, the witch who irritated him like no other, yet was the one he was about to formally share with the Wizarding world as his fiancée.</p><p>How romantic.</p><p>At least she had managed to put on something decent for the occasion. He was honestly surprised to learn that she owned a dress, so accustomed from their school years to seeing her in either robes or casual Muggle clothes. In her current attire, he could actually see her figure for once. Who would have guessed that under all those loose shirts, Granger had such a slender waist? She had even bothered to put on some makeup and pin her hair back in a clip so it wasn’t nearly as wild as usual. All things considered, he’d even venture to say that Granger looked presentable.</p><p>Good. Then he wouldn't be embarrassed when their photo was on the front page of the <em>Daily Prophet </em>tomorrow.</p><p>Draco knocked on the office door, and they both fell into character. When his hand returned to his side, Granger grabbed it, intertwining their fingers so he could feel the cool gold of the diamond ring on her left hand.</p><p>They didn’t have to wait long before the door swung open, revealing the blonde-haired, middle-aged witch, her Quick-Quotes Quill already floating beside her as she adjusted the brim of her jewelled spectacles. </p><p>“I hope, for your sake, Mr Malfoy, this is just as juicy of a story as you promised me, or—”</p><p>Rita Skeeter faltered as she recognized the witch beside Draco, and for a brief moment, he got the sense that the older witch was borderline scared to see Granger. That hesitation quickly faded, however, as she fully assessed the scene before her, entranced by their interlocked fingers.</p><p>“My, my,” she said with an acidicly pleased grin, her quill already scribbling furiously across a piece of parchment. “What a lovely surprise, Miss Granger. Please, do come in and take a seat.”</p><p>Parchments whizzed through the air as they flew off Rita Skeeter’s desk and into various filing cabinets around the perimeter of the room. Her office walls were lined with framed <em>Daily Prophet </em>articles, all written by her, including one from earlier that year, speculating the Malfoys’ continued dabbling in the Dark Arts. Draco resisted a threatening sneer, remembering the harsh impact the supposed "exposé" had had on him and his family. Skeeter certainly had a knack for writing sensationalised stories, which was precisely why, despite his resentment, he and Granger had selected her to write the article announcing their engagement.</p><p>Determined to maintain their act, Draco pulled out a chair for Granger and waited for her to take her seat before he settled in the other chair. He near broke, however, when he felt the unexpected touch of Granger’s hand on his knee. His impulse was to knock it away, but he forcefully reminded himself that that wasn’t a wise choice. Instead, he was compelled to watch as her slim fingers gently caressed him over the fabric of his trousers, the rays of sunshine from an adjacent window causing the Malfoy family ring to glitter.</p><p>Rita Skeeter had noticed the movement as well.</p><p>“It appears that before me sit two love birds,” she cooed, the Quick-Notes Quill continuing its duty of transcribing her observations. “In a most shocking turn of events, Draco Malfoy, Slytherin’s notorious bad boy, and Hermione Granger, everyone’s beloved war heroine, appear to be an item. The lovestruck witch can hardly keep her hands to herself as an impressive and undoubtedly very expensive ring adorns her left hand.” </p><p>Rita Skeeter perched her elbows on the edge of her desk and leaned in with delighted intrigue. “Now, I must ask, how did our star-crossed lovers fall for one another? And why are we just now becoming privy to what undoubtedly is a powerful tale of forgiveness and redemption?”</p><p>“It all started about a year and a half ago,” Draco began, hardly recognising his own voice as he recounted the fabricated tale. He placed a hand on top of the one Granger still had on his knee and smiled at her in a way that could only be described as sickly sweet. “We ran into each other at Flourish and Blotts, which led to a three-hour-long conversation at a nearby cafe about our favourite author.”</p><p>“How absolutely charming,” she said. “And as our readers will surely want to know, who is your favourite author?”</p><p>“Dalton Doyle.”</p><p>“Leo Tolstoy.”</p><p>Draco’s pulse leapt as he exchanged a furtive glance with Granger, feeling Rita Skeeter’s quirked eyebrow at their contrasting answers.</p><p>“Tolstoy is, of course, my favourite Muggle author, and Dalton Doyle my favourite Wizarding author,” Granger quickly rationalised. The witch’s fingers pressed into his skin, as if directing Draco not to interrupt. “But we’re both such admirers of Doyle’s works. Although, after getting Draco to read <em>War and Peace</em>, I must say I’ve influenced his taste quite a bit, even if <em>Anna Karenina </em>will always be my preferred choice.”</p><p>Draco’s head spun, trying to keep track of the names of books Granger was saying in case he needed to repeat them, but then something else caught his attention.</p><p>She had used his given name.</p><p>Granted, that was a part of their act, but it was still odd to hear it coming from Granger. Hardly anyone referred to him as ‘Draco’ besides his parents and other older adults in his life.  At Hogwarts, Pansy was essentially the only one of their peers who didn’t call him ‘Malfoy,’ but that was because of their history with one another.  Which was precisely why Granger now had to call him that as well.</p><p>“And when can we expect the engagement party?” </p><p>Rita Skeeter’s next question pulled Draco back into the interview.</p><p>“Oh, Draco and I aren’t—”</p><p>“In two weeks.”</p><p>Granger’s eyes lit up in alarm, but thankfully, the other witch was too busy making sure her quill had gotten that to notice.</p><p>“Wonderful, wonderful!” Rita Skeeter’s pleased voice echoed throughout her office. “I expect the <em>Daily Prophet</em> will be invited to report on that event?”</p><p>Draco grinned. “You can expect our owl.”</p><p align="center">~*~*~</p><p>Diagon Alley was bustling with hurried witches and wizards as he and Granger exited the <em>Daily Prophet</em> offices. Several people did double-takes as the unexpected couple walked down the pavement, their fingers intertwined in a tight, aching grip while they made their way back to Draco’s flat. </p><p>“I wasn’t aware that we are having an engagement party,” Granger hissed. It was almost impressive the way she could make her disdain apparent even as a faux smile remained painted across her lips.</p><p>Draco didn’t bother to return the fake affection. “No one in pureblood society would buy this for a moment if we didn’t mark it with a formal function.” He could sense Granger itching to protest, but he cut her off before she had the chance. “You don’t need to concern yourself over any of the details. My mother said she would plan the whole thing. We just need to show up.”</p><p>
  <em>Right. Another thing his mother had insisted upon.</em>
</p><p>But Granger still didn’t seem satisfied. “And what about <em>my</em> parents?” she snarled, dropping her smile. “Did you factor <em>them</em> into this?”</p><p>Draco shrugged in ambivalence. “I suppose they should come.”</p><p>“You <em>suppose?</em>” she spat. Anger ignited in her pointed glare.</p><p>Draco revelled in the evidence of her dismay. “Watch your sneer, sweetheart,” Draco taunted, enjoying the way her nose wrinkled at his use of the endearment. “We don’t want to blow our cover before the news is plastered across the <em>Daily Prophet</em> in big, black letters.”</p><p>Granger pierced her nails into the back of Draco’s hand, and he had to draw in a short breath to prevent the sharp pain from showing on his features. </p><p>“Then I suggest you change the topic before I become more irritated, <em>darling.</em>”</p><p>Draco was tempted to snap something back at her, but he caught sight of yet another witch eyeing them curiously. They seriously had to learn to control their bickering in public.</p><p>He racked his mind for <em>anything </em>he could possibly discuss with Granger and eventually settled on something of actual interest.</p><p>“Back there with Skeeter,” he began, “she didn’t look too pleased to see you at first. I assume there’s a story behind that?”</p><p>Granger quickly glanced at him before returning her gaze forward. She paused, as if considering her response, before she finally replied, “During fourth year, I discovered something about her, and I don’t think she’s quite forgotten my warning.”</p><p>“Really now?” Draco said, mildly intrigued by her response. “And just how far did Goody Granger’s blackmail scheme go?”</p><p>If she wasn’t trying to maintain their act, Draco was certain she would have frowned at the use of such a mocking name, but to his surprise, she answered his question. “I trapped her in a jar where she was stuck in her beetle Animagus form and only released her with the understanding that she wouldn’t write anything for another year. And she absolutely deserved it after all the terrible lies she spread about Harry during the Triwizard Tournament!”</p><p>Draco blinked, still processing the first part of her confession. “Skeeter’s an Animagus?”</p><p>“An unregistered one, yes.”</p><p><em>Huh. </em>And Granger had successfully used that to prevent the witch from writing any more articles about her and her pesky friends? He couldn’t lie. It was rather… ruthless. Something he wished <em>he</em> could have done to the writer. He could almost respect Granger for it.</p><p><em>Almost</em>.</p><p align="center">~*~*~</p><p>When they arrived back in Draco’s flat, Granger wasted no time once again finding a way to irritate him. She roamed around the sitting room, pulling out nearly every drawer, evidently in search for something.</p><p>“Do we need to have <em>another </em>conversation about you touching my things?” Draco groaned.</p><p>But as he was sure he’d soon learn to expect, Granger merely ignored his complaint, too focused on whatever it was she was looking for.</p><p><em>“Accio</em> notecards!” she said with a raised wand.</p><p>The door to Draco’s bedroom flew open, and a stack of notecards whizzed from inside the space and into Granger’s hands.</p><p>“And just what exactly are those for?”</p><p>Granger split the pile in half. “We can’t risk another near mess up like what happened when Rita Skeeter asked us about our favourite authors. If we expect this to work, we need to know more about each other.” She handed half of the cards to Draco. “Write down your favourite things and memories on these cards. Tomorrow evening, we’ll come back together and exchange our answers. We’ll have the rest of the week to study and will quiz each other over the weekend.”</p><p>Draco stared at the cards in his hands, not sure where to begin with his objection. Even if she <em>did</em> have a point, he wasn’t thrilled at the prospect of wasting his time making the cards for her. Worse yet, he would then have to actually study facts about <em>Granger</em>.</p><p>But before Draco could ask a single question, Granger had already turned on her heels and marched away, shutting her bedroom door without another word.</p><p>“If this is what living with Hermione Granger is like, then I feel for Weasley and Potter for having to endure this for so many years!” Draco cried after her, but he got no response. Knowing her, she had undoubtedly gotten straight to work on filling out her notecards.</p><p>Draco threw the cards on the coffee table and propped his feet up upon the surface as he knocked his head back with a groan. These next two months were going to be a proper nightmare.</p>
