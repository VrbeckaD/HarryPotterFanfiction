    <p>Hi!</p><p> </p><p>So, due to all these prompts being one-shots, I'm not exactly able to put a description of all of them in the description box. There's also some 80 prompts possible, and while I doubt I'll get all 80, it's just too many to summarize. Even if they were all just a sentence. I'm also continually adding on to it and I'm goingto  be honest here, I'll forget to update the description. That being said, each chapter is named with the prompt and a very brief description of the fic in the chapter's notes. This is rated E for Explicit because I am not sure where it will head in the future. It very well may end up including smut. It definitely has some bad language in it. If there is anything you want to be tagged, don't hesitate to let me know. I'm pretty bad at remembering what to tag!</p><p> </p><p><a title="Prompt List Post - Tumblr" href="http://potions-and-potters.tumblr.com/post/176237409759/prompt-list-3" rel="nofollow">Here </a>is the link to the Prompt post, in case you're curious. <a title="Potions-N-Potters Tumblr" href="http://potions-and-potters.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">Here </a>is my Tumblr, Potions-N-Potters.</p><p> </p><p>This really is just for ease of access to all these little one-shots that I've written. Please do let me know if you like them! It means a lot to hear from you!</p><p> </p><p>Enjoy!!</p><p> </p><p>-Lilly</p>
