    <p> </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p><strong>Original synopsis I wrote for myself</strong>: <em>What a silly man</em>, Ana thought fondly as she watched them from the window. <em>To think I would deny him his soul mate. (</em>Or, the one where Ana Jarvis has had quite enough of her husband and Peggy Carter denying themselves the one thing they both really want: each other). AKA one happy and healthy threesome. </p>
  <p><strong>Pairing</strong>: Ana/Edwin, Edwin/Peggy </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Ana had always known that she was not Edwin’s soul mate. He had told her – quite contritely, dear man – on their wedding day, his face flushed an endearing shade of pink as she’d brushed her fingers through his hair; fingernails still chipped and dirty from all those months in Budapest, hidden away in back rooms and safe houses, hoping and praying to any deity who would listen that the Gestapo wouldn’t find her. She’d married him anyway; laughing softly at the flustered look of quiet joy that had spread across his features as he’d gathered her hands into his and kissed them reverently.</p><p><em>What</em><em> a silly Englishman</em>, she had thought fondly that night, body tucked languidly against his own, the soft sound of his sleepy snuffling like a warm blanket against the cold. They had made love tenderly just a few short hours ago, Edwin’s attentions careful and slow, and she hadn’t shied away from him, even when he’d hesitated, fingers fumbling over shirtsleeves and the small bandage-like wristband he’d worn for as long as she had known him. She hadn’t asked for him to remove it – would never ask him to remove it; it wasn’t her place. Instead, her fingers had smoothed over his own, drawing them away from a decision he couldn’t unmake because she honestly didn’t mind.  </p><p>Couldn’t mind, truly. Her own wrist might be bare – would likely always be bare because she had always felt complete in and of herself and had never had a real longing for someone <em>other</em>, even if she loved dear Edwin with every beat of her heart – but she understood it. Perhaps even better than he did most days, because while her dear Edwin worried that one day she would think that she wasn’t enough for him, she worried that he would do the one thing she never wanted him to: deny himself his soul mate.  </p><p>Because he shouldn’t. He couldn’t. Not after everything this silly, wonderful, not to mention <em>lovable</em> man had done for her. She wouldn’t allow it.</p>
