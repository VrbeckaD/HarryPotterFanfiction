    <p>            It was mid-December. A thin layer of snow covered the streets of New York City as Hermione Granger walked down 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue, admiring the bright lights and exuberant window displays, all decorated in the holiday spirit. Her coat was wrapped tightly around her, just the last of the layers she wore – along with a warming charm – as was her scarf, tightly wound around her neck. Her gloved hands were stuffed in her pockets, and a woolen cap completed her look and warming needs.</p><p>            It had been an almost lifelong dream to come to New York. That she had managed to do it in the Holiday Season was certainly an added bonus. If she had one complaint, it would be that she was alone.</p><p> </p><p>            Life right after the war had gone just as she had imagined and planned. The world was safe at last, she had gotten a nice desk job at the Ministry, and finally, <em>finally</em>, Ronald Weasley had seen her as more than the swotty, annoying know-it-all that insistently hung around him and his best mate, the golden boy. They were dating. Life was good.</p><p>            The dating had gone on for years. Enough years that it should turn into an engagement, and finally a marriage, as everyone was pressuring them to. Of course Hermione was not one to do anything because she was pressured to. She was happy to marry Ron. But she would soon wonder if he had been happy to do it as well.</p><p>            It hadn’t been long after the wedding until the constant bickering had begun. It wasn’t all roses while they dated, but after marriage, it seemed that every little thing she said only served to irritate him, that any conversation turned into a fight because he misunderstood what she meant, or interpreted a tone she had never meant to convey. Perhaps what they needed was time, time to get used to living together, in such close quarters, and in such close bonds as those of marriage.</p><p>            On one of the good, peaceful days, they had decided to start trying to conceive. That seemed to put a wide smile on Ron’s face, and his mood was wonderful and constant for the weeks to come. It was the Ron Hermione had always wanted. She was completely happy and fulfilled for the first time in their one year of marriage.</p><p>            So she happily cut back on work, taking up only part time duties, preparing herself for motherhood, to be there for her children, be as present of a mother as she could. It was also what Ron wanted. In fact, if he had had it his way, she would have quit work altogether. But she couldn’t do that. He seemed content with what he could get, and supported her decision to work part time.</p><p>            Weeks turned into a couple of months, and the frustration of not getting pregnant started to weight on the couple. Ron’s moods returned, and Hermione felt empty, in need of something to fill her time and the void of failure. Failure to get pregnant, and failure to keep her husband happy, her marriage happy. But it would pass, as it had before. Once they were parents, Ron would absolutely go back to his normal self, like he was when they started dating; loving and nurturing.</p><p>            To fill her days and distract her mind, Hermione looked for an extracurricular activity of sorts. And there was nothing better and more stimulating than learning.</p><p>            She had always had interest and curiosity in potions, perhaps stemming from her interest in chemistry in the muggle world. But potions were somehow even more fascinating. How an array of ingredients, magical or non-magical, each with their own properties and uses on their own, could be combined in various ways, creating from the simplest compounds like a headache potion, to complex potions that could heal severe sickness, create the illusion of love, or poisons that could kill. In addition to that fascination, there was the feeling that potions had been the only subject she hadn’t gotten the most out of in school. Professor Snape was brilliant, and hardly ever followed textbooks, his spiky handwriting always on the board with his own set of instructions. But following the textbook was all she knew. It was what she could read beforehand, to be prepared. She found difficulty in thinking outside the box, in fitting what Professor Snape taught into what she read in the books. That much was obvious from the notes he left on her essays, and the grades he handed her. Of course his… unorthodox, rigid ways were somewhat hindering as well.</p><p>            And then, on her sixth year – what turned out to be her final year in Hogwarts – there was Horace Slughorn. He wasn’t a very good teacher, always more interested in what he could get from the students in the future. He was the opposite of Professor Snape. Too plain and predictable, teaching the bare minimum, not stimulating enough. And she never got to take the NEWT level classes, and learn the really interesting bits.</p><p>            So she decided to invest in that. Potions tutoring. At least at first. When she felt she knew enough of that, she could move on to something else, if the free time was still there. She worked in the mornings only, and would have a couple of hours in the afternoon to learn, distract her mind, and be home in time to put dinner on the table for Ron. She only needed to find someone willing to help her.</p><p>            She went into the Potions Department one afternoon, hoping to find Frederick Bagman. He was a Hufflepuff, contemporary to her at Hogwarts. She had absolutely no memory of him, but was hoping that her somewhat celebrity status would get her somewhere. If he was not available to help her, he could at least indicate someone who could.</p><p>            However, she did not find Frederick there. He was out for the day. Apparently there had been a very serious spill, and the labs needed to be closed for the day. The only soul that could be found there was the Head of the Department, no other than Severus Snape himself. He was still very intimidating, even though she hadn’t seen him since the war and wasn’t the teenage girl he could bully anymore. She knew she wouldn’t get anywhere with him, but she was there, and it would be rude to just not talk to him. She did want to make this arrangement work sooner rather than later. She really needed to fill her mind and her time. Plus, she didn’t want to have made the trip all the way down to the labs in vain. It couldn’t hurt to try.</p><p>            “Mrs. Weasley… How may I help you?” He had uttered in that indifferent and slightly annoyed tone of his. At least he hadn’t been outright rude.</p><p>            She exposed her needs and wishes, never daring to insinuate he take the time to teach her when she wasn’t even serious about pursuing it as a career, and wasn’t asking for a proper apprenticeship. It would be a waste of his time. But she wouldn’t mind being taught by him. He <em>was</em> brilliant, she couldn’t deny it. That was why he was head of the department. And she could certainly handle him better now. Still, she just asked he point her to someone who could aid her. She would, of course, pay them for their time.</p><p>            To her surprise, after analyzing her with his piercing gaze for what seemed like endless minutes, he proposed something that could benefit both. He was in need of an intern of sorts, to help him with a project. He could not use the people he already had working under him in the labs, for they each had their own projects and their plates full. He didn’t want to be arsed into choosing from the idiots that came from Hogwarts these days. Leave that to the others. She was intelligent enough that she would not be in his way, he knew – she was a bit taken aback by his acknowledgement of her smarts – and in return, he could teach her. He would need to brew endless potions for his project anyway. It could be an exchange of favors of sorts, and it could last for as long as she saw fit. She, of course, accepted it.</p><p>            And so they started. She would work in the mornings and go down to the labs in the afternoons, after she had had her lunch. She would help with it all, happy to have something to do and be recognized for it, from scrubbing cauldrons and chopping ingredients, to actually brewing potions on her own. He would teach her new things, perfect her techniques, and give her an article or two to read, so they could discuss it the following day. Ronald knew nothing of this. He hated Snape with a passion, still, even with all they had learned after Voldemort’s demise. He knew she had taken up a hobby, to distract her mind, but didn’t really care what it was. He never seemed too intent on talking to her about her interests anyway.</p><p>            It was all business between Snape and her. At first. He wasn’t as stiff and rude, and didn’t scowl as much as in Hogwarts. Perhaps the freedom of not being at war and in danger soothed him a bit. Still, he wasn’t the friendliest or most open of men, and just gave her instructions she followed. That is, until he <em>had</em> to open up.</p><p>            Hermione was curious, always. She had held it back in front of him as much as she could, as to not irk him, but one day, when he talked about the properties of an ingredient she had never even heard of, she just had to ask. “How do you <em>know</em> all this? How did you stumble upon it?”</p><p>            There were things he learned while brewing and creating unspeakable things for the Dark Lord. In order to instruct her and quench her annoying and persistent curiosity, he told her about his experiences in the lab under those circumstances matter-of-factly, to explain his findings. She would just get more curious and interested, and ask more questions.</p><p>He had been alone for long. Surrounded by people, but alone. Few people he did consider as… not so much friends as close acquaintances, such as Minerva, just assumed he wouldn’t want to talk about those things, so they never asked. The rest didn’t care. He himself thought he would prefer to leave it buried deep inside. But the few things he was forced to share with her made him… breathe easier, it seemed. To take that off his chest, and not have her judge him for what he did and just listen. And the fact she was interested in more seemed to get to him. So he slowly did open up more of it, deeper and more personal things, sometimes not related to brewing at all. And since Hermione was quite the curious type, she kept asking, fascinated by his past, by what he went through, sorry that he had to do it all alone. She went through much less, and had Harry and Ron, at least, and it still bothered her and gave her nightmares sometimes. She could only imagine how he felt.</p><p>Being alone and keeping everything bottled up had taken its toll. So the more she asked, the more he shared, little by little, surprised she even cared to ask. She started sharing her experiences as well, though they seemed rather foolish compared to his. And a fragile friendship bloomed.</p><p>She began to have lunch with him. She learned he preferred to stay in the lab, and eat alone rather than go out to the cafeteria, or, if he had more time to spare, he would go out into the muggle world, and eat alone nonetheless. So she would bring her lunch and have it with him in the lab, so he wouldn’t eat alone. Whenever she was in the cafeteria, she would eat alone anyway, as Ron never seemed to be around for lunch.</p><p>They were on a first name basis in no time, and sharing more than just war experiences as well. What they did after work, common interests, books they were reading, favorite movies and songs, hopes and dreams. And when Ron was particularly moody and rude, she took comfort in Severus and their talks, sometimes even sharing with him what happened. She couldn’t exactly share with Harry or Ginny. They tried to be neutral, but seemed incredibly understanding of Ron’s side every time. Severus would try to comfort her, but keeping his distance, not getting too involved with it.</p><p>She one day, while brewing, called him over to clear some doubts she had about the process. But her eagerness to learn had made her cut his name short, as she analyzed her potion distractedly, thinking on her question. So she called him “Sev.” He raised an eyebrow at her, then narrowed his eyes, pursing his lips, reminding her very much of being at the dungeon in Hogwarts, and before she could apologize or correct herself, he said “what is it… Herms?” Sardonically, as he of course would. She sniggered and quite liked it, to be honest. Her friends, her husband, everyone called her Mione. Herms was nice. Different. It warmed her heart. He was the only one to call her that. It became a running gag between them, until it was just how they naturally called each other.</p><p>His project came to an end. He published his article, made his discovery. Still, he did not turn her away from his lab when she showed up every day, and she kept showing up every day. Hermione began to question her feelings, her life, her marriage. How could she be happier, smile and laugh more in the few hours a day she spent with Severus Snape, the sullen bat from the dungeons, than with her own husband? Why did Severus Snape show more interest in what she had to say than her husband ever did? Why was he sweeter, more attentive to her needs, to her voice and opinions than Ron? Was this right? And all this just after a few months of working with him.</p><p>There was a particular day when she came in really distracted. She had had a big fight with Ron. The words he said… had filled her with sorrow. She didn’t understand why this happened, why sometimes he would just… demean her like that. She didn’t want to talk about it, but Severus nudged it out of her. He couldn’t have her handling potions distracted as such. He sat her down in a corner – it was a good thing he was head of the department and he had a private lab – and made her talk. It didn’t even take much probing, really.</p><p>At the end of her tear-filled rant, he just stared at her, breathing heavily. Rage in his eyes. She thought she had perhaps overstepped, opened up too much to him, until he opened his mouth.</p><p>“That blithering idiot!” He was fuming. “I wish I could hex him into fucking next year.” It was like Ron had personally assaulted him, the way he was enraged. “You should not give his words one ounce of thought. Nothing… <em>nothing</em> he says about you is true, or has any worth.”</p><p>“I know… he’s just… angry.”</p><p>“That is absolutely no excuse to be an arse to the woman who loves him, who… does everything for him. Who fucking saved his life during the war. He should be forever thankful that a dimwit like him should be so lucky to have that. He should lay his life down at your feet, consider every word you say as the heaven sent truth. It’s funny how those who don’t value things are always the one who have it all.” After fuming a bit more, he realized what he had said. “He maybe… doesn’t deserve you.” He said a bit under his breath.</p><p>Hermione looked at him with still tear-stained eyes, thinking that she bloody well wanted a man who felt that strongly about her. Severus stared back into her whiskey eyes, flecked with gold… lovingly? She wouldn’t know, she hadn’t ever really seen a gaze like that in anyone. But he was still angered at what he had heard. They perhaps had a moment there, but before it could go further, he stood abruptly and got to work. Harshly, angrily, setting things down at the work bench with a thud, and barely looking or speaking to her for the rest of the day, but answering when she spoke, in a neutral tone, like he was trying to hide something.</p><p>Hermione realized, even if subconsciously, that she had developed feelings stronger than friendship for him. But she denied them with all her might. It was Ron she loved. She was just projecting that onto the nearest man she had constant contact with because things were hard at home. But marriage was hard. They were under a lot of stress, because they were having trouble conceiving. She couldn’t just give up on her marriage. Especially for someone she wasn’t quite sure how she felt about, and who most likely didn’t feel the same for her. Or did he?</p><p>She focused on bringing some spark back into her relationship, as to not make any stupid decisions in the heat of the moment. So she cooked for Ron, all his favorite meals, but they were often deemed bad, and he wouldn’t eat them sometimes, preferring to go out and eat by himself. She was tender and loving, and took deep breaths when he lashed out at her, trying not to cause a fight. She pampered him in every way she could think of. And she even tried to be inventive in the bedroom, to spice things up.</p><p>It didn’t work as much as she would have liked, but things were better. Feebly stitched together. She saw it as progress. She was not one to simply give up. And then, it finally happened. She got pregnant. And Ron was once again the happy, caring boy – albeit a bit clueless at times – she once knew, just like she knew he would become. But that period was short-lived.</p><p>As she got bigger and her hormones were all over the place, the unhappy, snarky Ron returned. And once again her solace lay in her friendship with Severus, that remained there, and strong. And while Ron commented on how big she was getting, and that perhaps she should cut down on the eating, Severus complimented her at every turn, saying how beautiful she was, and how she was glowing. While Ron had no patience with her mood swings and would leave her to cry and talk by herself, Severus listened, Severus comforted. While Ron did not care to run out in the middle of the night and tend to her cravings, saying it was rubbish and she would get even fatter, Severus would find her whatever she mentioned she wanted to eat, be it going out at the moment she mentioned it to fetch it for her, be it bringing it in the next day, often cooked by him. While Ron complained she wasn’t getting anything done in the house and was getting lazy, Severus insisted she rest, demanding less and less of her in the lab, even giving her foot rubs at times, until finally she just showed up to sit with him and discuss the articles he appointed for her reading pleasure. All because he couldn’t forgo at least seeing her.</p><p>When the baby came, Rose was her name, Hermione had to stay at home for a month. The longest month of her life. She was still on maternity leave, wasn’t even going to work, but she made her way to the Ministry, little Rose in her baby carrier, just so she could visit Severus. The man was delighted by her visit, his eyes shining upon seeing her, unlike she had ever seen directed at her. Except for maybe… from that same man, countless times before. He was also delighted to meet baby Rose, and when she wrapped her tiny fingers around his larger one as he caressed her tiny hands, he smiled, also unlike she had ever seen before.</p><p>Soon, she was back to his lab. Sooner than she actually returned to work. Every day, helping him. Baby Rose would sit in his office, away from harm, and Hermione would go check on her as much as needed, to breast feed her, soothe her, put her to sleep. Severus walked in on her breast feeding once, and never had she seen him more embarrassed. What she didn’t know was that in addition to his embarrassment, he fought the arousal that crept up on him for having seen her smooth, porcelain skin, having seen so much of it, having seen her breast. He longed to see more of her, all of her.</p><p>Severus would also hold and coddle Rose, play with her, and sing her to sleep. He had a good singing voice, as well as his spoken one. Baby Rose liked him, and even laughed with him. And Hermione’s heart swelled and got all warm and fuzzy in seeing Severus with her baby, so good, so gentle. If one judged him only by what he was like while teaching at Hogwarts, they would never believe it. But Hermione had so much more to judge him by now. Baby Rose was more soothed by him than by her father, who, in the end, had not much patience with her either. He never even changed one single diaper. As baby Rose grew and started taking her first steps, Severus was right there to hold her hand and guide her as Hermione brewed. She could swear she never had seen him so joyous. It made her happy as well.</p><p>Hermione continued to vent about some things with Severus, and he was, as always, supportive. It was nice to have someone on her side. Everyone else she had in her life knew Ron, and was somehow closer to him than to her. They would never see her side of things. It was at times like these that not having parents anymore became especially painful.</p><p>It became clearer to her that there was indeed something there, in the air in the lab, between her and Severus, and it wasn’t just potion fumes. But she couldn’t leave her husband now. They had a baby. A family. They had to make it work. She became really torn. Maybe if she had left him before, she would be better off. She shouldn’t have stayed for fear of Severus not wanting her. Perhaps if she had someone else to turn to, a home to go back to… She should have left for herself. But if she did, she wouldn’t have Rose.</p><p>And now, she lacked even more courage to do it. They had a daughter. A child needs her father. How she felt about this maybe stemmed from the fact she had lost her parents in the war like that, and she was already a young adult. Imagine how it would feel for a child. And Ron… he worked in the Auror department. He was well connected. And she had learned, through the threats he spewed during their arguments, and unfortunately too late, that he was spiteful. She was scared she would lose her baby girl to him if they were to divorce. He could very well lie and cheat, and use his leverage for that just because she dared leave him. That was the true Ron.</p><p>And then there came a time when he was to be transferred to some little town in the south of France for a year. He needed to go with his family, present a united front, otherwise he wouldn’t get to go, nor would he get the promotion that followed. He accepted it without discussing any of it with Hermione. Of course there was a huge fight once he simply informed her they were moving. He didn’t consider her job, her friends, her feelings. She did not want to go. Mostly though, she didn’t want to be away from Severus, even if France was just a train ride or a portkey away.</p><p>Things moved really fast. She wasn’t in any shape to be seen in public, and Ron had already informed her boss she would be going, again without her knowledge or consent, so she was on unpaid leave. So she didn’t show up at the labs. She didn’t know what to do with her life. And when Severus called her mobile – for safety reasons of not having to face Weasley should he be home when he flooed – he learned the news of her possibly moving, and some of what Ron had said and done. So he stated very seriously on the phone that they needed to talk, face to face. She was sure, deep in her soul, that he would ask her to stay, to be with him. And if he did, she would. To hell with it all. He was a powerful wizard, well connected as well, he could help her against anything Ron might try.</p><p>But it turned out that meeting never happened. She did not know it, but Severus lost his nerve. Though she complained about her husband, that did not mean she wished to leave him. Much less did it mean that she would want to be with <em>him</em>, that she felt anything more than friendship towards him. Perhaps the few signs he thought he saw were misinterpreted. Wishful thinking. He could not dare insinuate she break up a family solely on that. But he should simply tell her how he felt anyway, let her decide. Or was that too presumptuous of him just the same? Before both knew it, time had moved things along fast, and she had moved with her husband and daughter, and they never managed to arrange to meet in the couple of weeks in which it had all transpired.</p><p>But Severus, being the good spy that he was, got a hold of her mobile number – which had changed – and called her up in France after a while, after he thought things had perhaps settled down. They talked, once a week. He, having been around that country a few times, suggested what she might do or go see, since she was at home and not working. What she wanted to do was to go to London and see him. But there was no plausible excuse for that, none to give to Ron. It wasn’t like she had parents to visit. She, in turn, reported to him on what she had done and seen. But it became harder to talk. They missed each other too much, unbeknownst to one another, and it hurt them to think the other’s life was getting on fine without them. Besides, Ron had become insanely jealous and controlling, and didn’t even understand why she needed that muggle contraption anyway. So she had to take these calls without him knowing. She would pretend it was the wrong number when she couldn’t talk, and Severus would know she couldn’t, or didn’t want to talk.</p><p>And so the phone calls died down.</p><p>Hermione, lonely in a foreign country, decided that what made her most happy right then was being a mother. She was good at it. And the urge to have another child grew in her.</p><p>She got pregnant without consulting Ron about it. She thought it would take long to happen, as it had before, and since now their sex life wasn’t all that active, but surprisingly, it happened fast. Once he learned, he was furious, which was odd, because he had told her once he wanted a big family, like his. Hermione was the one that had said she would be happy with one child. And even though he hated anything muggle, he went and got a vasectomy. He just told her once he arrived home from the surgery, saying he took precaution because she was a bad mother. Plus, now, if she cheated on him, he would know, he said.</p><p>Hermione returned to the UK with a second child, Hugo, having missed Severus the whole time, his tenderness and attentiveness towards her when she had been pregnant with Rose. She knew the words to endless love songs she had heard on a loop thinking of him, endless songs she knew for a fact he liked. But she returned to find out Severus no longer worked at the Ministry. She had no trace of him, nowhere to find him. He had moved because he could no longer bear to see her with the dimwitted redhead who didn’t deserve her one bit, and not have her to himself. And he didn’t want to be in the way, thinking maybe things had gotten better while they were away, maybe it wasn’t all that bad in the first place and he only heard the few worse bits, and maybe his presence hindered their progress somehow. His doting of her. Their friendship. He thought about showing up, going back, countless times. And he did. But he didn’t find her in London. Weasley had been transferred two more times, and she had followed him on those. It was precisely on those times Severus went back, got out from his countryside hideout or his endless strings of travels. Fate did not want them to meet. And the fact she was still with him, traveling everywhere, only proved to him she was now happy.</p><p>She really wasn’t though. She made it work, for the kids’ sake, and it was tolerable for most of the time. But that is all it was. And then, when both kids were in Hogwarts and it was just them alone again, it wasn’t even that.</p><p>So she made the decision of divorcing him. She wanted peace. She wanted to be happy, or however happy she could, anyway, and that wasn’t going to be achieved by his side, it was painfully evident now. The kids were older, and could understand things a little bit better, and could speak for themselves in court, say they wanted to see their mummy. And she was sure they would, because Ron still wasn’t the nicest father, and they weren’t too crazy about him. Respected him, or more feared him, but they were mostly attached to her. They would be away for most of the year in Hogwarts anyway. So she couldn’t force herself to bear Ron for three quarters of the year just to spend one quarter with her kids. And Minerva was her friend, still, not poisoned by Molly’s bullshit. She would definitely let her into Hogwarts every once in a while to see Rose and Hugo.</p><p>In addition to all of that, she had found out that from very early on in their marriage, Ronald had cheated on her with an endless string of hussies and social climbing bimbos. For the last 10 years, since they had gotten back from France, he had kept a constant mistress, and he thought he was in love, telling her he would only see the kids through Hogwarts and then would dump Hermione to be with her. That would explain why he had stopped sleeping in their bed, sleeping with her, and only talked to her when extremely necessary for the last decade. But the bimbo broke it off with him, and now he wanted Hermione to stay. Fat chance.</p><p>It had also come to her attention that the true reason he had had the vasectomy was because he had gotten some French whore pregnant. Not wishing to be on the cover of every newspaper, he had taken her to some sketchy country where they wouldn’t be found out to get an abortion. It had almost killed her, and so he got a vasectomy to avoid future problems. And had said those horrible words to her just because.</p><p>It was just all a slap on the face, really. To think that, despite her feelings, her deep, strong feelings for Severus, she had tried to respect him and their marriage, make it work, while he truly never gave a fuck. She should have just shagged Severus senseless on every flat surface, every day in his lab, and not have given a fuck either. Now the opportunity was lost, perhaps forever. She hadn’t had the heart to look for him. What if he was now married, and happy, with kids? It had been a decade. A lot happens in a decade. And though Ronald had tried to keep the divorce quiet, to not taint his reputation, there were small notes in every newspaper. Severus surely had seen them, and if he wanted, he would have found her.</p><p> </p><p>So now she walked the streets of New York City. She had sat her kids down and had a long talk with them. They didn’t blame her. They saw it how it was, and that it didn’t feel right, their parents together. So smart they were. They had voiced their wish to stay with their mother when at home for the summer, but alternate weekends and holidays would go to Ron. She could live with that.</p><p>And it turned out that Christmas 2019, her first and third years, brave little Gryffindors, would be at Molly’s. She breathed relieved, because even though Molly was not on her side, she was a good caregiver, and would take care of her grandchildren. Ron was trying to persuade Hermione to go too, trying to win her back. So she decided to spend the week or so she had off in New York, to make her point clearly.</p><p>She had also decided to spend it in New York City because she remembered one time, when she came into the lab tired and in a bad mood, claiming jokingly that she needed the day off, Severus had offered to take her to New York the next day. He knew someone in the portkey department. She would skip work, as would he, and they would come, spend the day, shop, see the sights, no one would be the wiser. She would be home for dinner.</p><p>The blind Gryffindor, stripped of her courage, could not do it. She had refused. She regretted it very much. And she had wanted to see New York ever since. But what she really wanted was to be there with him. Tobe anywhere with him.</p><p>She stopped to see the light show on Saks, which she stood in front of. It was really beautiful. She stood there, mesmerized, and sad as she looked around and saw people in couples, holding hands, men keeping their ladies warm by putting a hand around their shoulders, hugging them. She never had that.</p><p>It started snowing softly again as she started to walk once more. It was her first evening there, and she wanted to see the decorations, and perhaps already buy Rose and Hugo a Christmas gift, something New Yorkish, so that on the following days she could see other sights, and just rest, recollect her thoughts. It had been a tough year. A tough decade, really.</p><p>Just when she started to think that perhaps her hotel room, a hot shower, and a hot beverage were in order, she saw a window that caught her eye. A family, sat in a luxuriously decorated living room, kids under the tree, opening their presents, parents on the sofa, cuddled together. She felt sorry for herself once again, that it had never been the case for her. That it probably never would be. Before she began to weep copiously in public and the Americans started to look at her as the deranged Brit, she started to walk again, and abruptly ran into a tall figure.</p><p>“Sorry,” she was quick to say, regaining her balance. “I’m usually not this clumsy,” she continued, more to herself as she checked her purse was still on her and straightened out her clothes, fully expecting to be talking to herself by now, since New Yorkers always seemed to be in such a rush. But as she composed herself, she saw that the man still stood there. Not only that, he held her arm, helping her regain her balance. She looked up at him, to thank him, and saw a familiar face, albeit slightly changed by the years.</p><p>“Sev…!” She called breathlessly, jaw dropped. She intended on saying his full name. She did not know if he would still give her the liberty to call him as such. But her breath failed her.</p><p>He looked very charming. Much like her, he was fully clothed and buttoned up, scarf tight around his neck, hand that did not help her stuffed in his coat pocket. But his hair now was gray as his scarf, and short. Very different from the jet black long locks, tied back at the nape of his neck he sported when she last saw him. The stern lines on his face were the same, though, much like they did before, they softened upon seeing her.</p><p>He leaned down and wrapped an arm around her shoulders, squeezing and pulling her up against him for a moment. “Herms,” he said in her ear softly, and let her go, smiling now.</p><p>To hear him call her that once again brought tears to her eyes. His low, silky voice in her ear brought a shiver to her spine. And he smelled great, as usual. Peppery and herbal at the same time. His smell tightened her core as well. They stood there, looking at each other, the snow and the cold not bothering them in the slightest. It was evident the spark was still there.</p><p>Severus finally managed to tear his eyes from her, and looked around, expecting to see a husband and kids catching up to her. None did, though. He became cautiously curious. But not hopeful. Never hopeful.</p><p>“May I… buy you a hot beverage of some kind?” He finally offered.</p><p>“Hot cocoa, please,” she said, smiling and nodding.</p><p>“Hot cocoa it is, then,” he smiled, placing himself beside her, to walk next to her and lead her somewhere. “I know just the place.”</p>
