  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Summertime Sadness</strong>
</p><p>It climaxed with a letter, but before that tensions between Harry Potter-Malfoy and his adoptive father Lucius Malfoy ran high. At the beginning of the summer, Harry’s godfather Sirius Black dropped Harry and his adoptive brother Draco back home at Malfoy Manor after a rather large welcome home feast at his house. Harry expected an apology, or even a greeting from Mr. Malfoy, but none came. The best he got was “Hello, your room has been cleaned for you.” Even Mrs. Malfoy was a bit colder to Harry than normal. She still was affectionate to him, but Harry could feel a slight annoyance from her, especially when, on the first night back home at the manor after spending a night with Sirius, Harry walked up to Mr. Malfoy and the first words out of his mouth were, “Where is my apology?”</p><p>Mrs. Malfoy sighed and answered for Mr. Malfoy, who just gave Harry a sharp, disappointed look. “Harry, you are still obsessing over your father’s actions? We have a reason for everything we do sweetie, and though we cannot explain it to you yet, you will understand in time. Now like your father said, your room is ready. Why don’t you go and make sure the house-elves pack everything where it is supposed to and come back for dinner?”</p><p>During that dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy asked Draco and Harry how their year at Hogwarts went. “Since we haven’t seen you since September,” Mrs. Malfoy smiled, though Harry felt a piercing guilt in his throat.</p><p>“Well… Gryffindor won the House Cup,” Draco said, looking at Harry with a small smile. Earlier that day they both decided to tell the truth of what happened, but too easy into it.</p><p>“Oh, a pity,” Mr. Malfoy said. “Last I heard from Severus, Slytherin was on a six year winning streak.”</p><p>“They’re not anymore,” Harry said. “We won.”</p><p>“Hmm… what else happened?” Mr. Malfoy asked, turning to Draco. Harry felt a small bubble of anger pop inside him.</p><p>“The usual,” Draco shrugged. “We had classes, we passed all of our exams, I’ve beaten Harry in Potions—”</p><p>“By <em>five</em> points!”</p><p>“And other than that… some things happened,” Draco said, looking down at his plate.</p><p>“What things?” Mrs. Malfoy asked.</p><p>“We uhh… well…” Draco looked up at Harry for help.</p><p>Harry sighed and said in one breath, “I fought a troll that Professor Quirrell led into the girl’s bathroom; we’ve gotten past a three-headed dog, Devil’s Snare, a room with enchanted magical keys; a deadly game of chess, and a logic thing by Snape all to get the Philosopher’s Stone before my grandfather.”</p><p>A weird silence fell upon them. Harry and Draco looked at each other worryingly as Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy processed what Harry just said. Nobody moved, Mrs. Malfoy had a quizzical look on her face as Mr. Malfoy just looked at both boys neutrally.</p><p>“Let me see if I fully understand you, Harry,” Mr. Malfoy said. “You have not only broke several rules risking your life against dangerous, disgusting creatures… but you decided to drag your brother along with it?”</p><p>“I—”</p><p>“Harry Potter-Malfoy, I am fully disappointed in you. Getting yourself sorted into Gryffindor as a way of rebellion is bad enough, but you had to force your brother into dangerous situations, making him break almost every single rule in Hogwarts and might have ended up dead!” Mr. Malfoy said furiously. “I hope you are happy with yourself.”</p><p>“Lucius!”</p><p>“NO!” Harry screamed. “It wasn’t like that at all! Draco went <em>willingly</em>!”</p><p>“I did!” Draco agreed.</p><p>“Draco, don’t interrupt,” Mr. Malfoy snapped. He turned back to Harry. “You are grounded. I am taking away your wand, your broomstick that you shouldn’t really have in the first place and all of your toys. You are to remain in your room and come out only for meals, do you understand?”</p><p>Harry stared at Mr. Malfoy, shocked. “That’s not fair! I did nothing wrong—I saved us! If my grandfather got the Stone, if we didn’t go to stop him—”</p><p>“Then Draco wouldn’t be in any trouble,” Mr. Malfoy said.</p><p>“Lucius…” Mrs. Malfoy said. “Perhaps you are being too strict.”</p><p>“Too strict? He put our boy in danger,” Mr. Malfoy said, turning to Mrs. Malfoy. “This is the least that I could do to the boy!”</p><p>“We will talk about this later,” Mrs. Malfoy said. There was a strange silence between her and Mr. Malfoy. Harry didn’t look at either of them, instead just turning to glare at his food as he angrily speared it with his fork.</p><p>The rest of the dinner was in an uncomfortable silence. Mr. Malfoy followed Harry into his room and Harry watched in angry horror as, with several flicks with his wand, Harry’s possessions disappeared, leaving the room bare except for his bed, bookcase filled with schoolbooks, and a desk. “It will stay like this until after your birthday,” Mr. Malfoy said. “Do not endanger my son again.”</p><p>Harry just glared at him, “I’m not your son?” he muttered under his breath.</p><p>“Yes you are,” Mr. Malfoy said, “However, now I am disappointed in the fact.” He emphasized his disappointment by slamming the door behind him, the lock clicking on it’s own. Harry screamed and ran towards the door, slamming his fists on it before sinking to the floor, crying.</p><p>He stopped when he heard a knock on the door. “Harry?” It was Draco.</p><p>“Draco!” Harry said.</p><p>“Harry are you okay?” Draco asked.</p><p>“Stupid question,” Harry grumbled.</p><p>“Sorry…I can’t get in! Is the door locked on your side?” Draco asked as he jiggled the doorknob.</p><p>Harry nodded, “Father locked it, I don’t think he wants me leaving,” Harry frowned.</p><p>“Wants you to—that’s insane!” Draco said. “Do you have your wand? How about the Cloak?”</p><p>“I don’t—he took my wand,” Harry frowned. “Wait, I’ll look.” He moved away from the door and quickly ran around his room. He found his trunk in his closet and smiled when, at the bottom of the trunk under a pile of dirty laundry, was the Invisibility Cloak. He took it and ran back to Draco. “I have the cloak!” he cheered.</p><p>“Great, one second,” Draco said. “Wait… what was that spell again?” he muttered.</p><p>“Which one?” Harry asked.</p><p>“The unlocking one—the one Grang—Hermione used on that dog’s door,” Draco said.</p><p>“<em>Alohomora!</em>” Harry said.</p><p>“<em>Alohomora!</em>” Draco repeated. There was a small click and Harry stepped back as the door opened, revealing Draco’s smiling, victorious face. “It worked!” he cheered.</p><p>“Great!” study smiled. “Where would Father hide my things?”</p><p>“In his office—he and Mother are in the back now, talking,” Draco said.</p><p>“Great, I’ll be a minute,” Harry said, disappearing under the Cloak. He immediately ran out of his room and down the hallway. He made his way to the foyer and stopped. He could hear Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy talking downstairs, their voices raised. Harry frowned as he did his best to block their voices out as he slightly, slowly, crawled down the stairs; making sure to avoid making any sounds as he moved down the carpeted stairway. House-elves were scurrying about, cleaning and dusting the old portraits, their inhabitants snoozing away in their frames. Harry did his best to avoid all of them.</p><p>When he reached the bottom stair, he looked around than walked across the foyer to a set of double-doors that he barely went through. It was empty, a single carpet leading down the center of the hallway that Harry kept on. There was a door at the end of the hallway, and Harry pushed it slowly and walked into Mr. Malfoy’s study.</p><p>It was a nicely sized room. The main focus was a huge desk made of a dark wood sitting in the center, on top of which was several neat stacks of papers. Bookcases filled the room’s walls, all stuffed with books with titles too long and too complicated for Harry to even try to pronounce. There was a trunk on the floor in the corner, still opened, and filled with Harry’s possessions. He made his way to the desk and looked over it. On it was several angry looking letters from Mr. Malfoy’s associates, as well as several from Mr. Malfoy himself. Harry recognized most of the letters and bent forward, mouthing to himself as he read snippets of Mr. Malfoy’s letter.</p><p>
  <em>“The act is a disgusting thing. Why would filthy muggles need protection? The Muggle Protection Act is half-brained lunacy, just as that Arthur Weasley. No double he wrote half of the mockery. To think his children goes to the same school as my son, it is a tragedy… No matter, I have a plan for the Weasleys.”</em>
</p><p>Harry felt a sense of hot anger boiling up again as he looked at the letter. Lifting it up to crumble it, he noticed something very odd. It was a small, old black-leathered book, it’s pages yellowed. Curious, Harry picked up the book and opened it, expecting to see something about Dark Arts or politics, but instead finding nothing. He frowned, his eyebrows furrowing slightly. Harry flipped through the book’s pages, seeing that they were all empty. “What’s the point of this?” he muttered to himself. Still, it was laying on Mr. Malfoy’s desk. Feeling very petty, and thinking that it has something to do with Mr. Weasley, Harry pocketed the book and quickly made his way to the trunk. His wand was on the bottom, so it was easy to cover up the empty space after he took it.</p><p>He stood up and quickly left the office, making sure that everything else was in the same place before he closed the door behind him. He returned to the foyer just as Mr. Malfoy and Mrs. Malfoy walked in. He stopped, remembering that he was wearing the Invisibility Cloak, and listened as Mr. Malfoy said, “Fine, he will be grounded for only two weeks, though he deserves more. You can see it yourself, Narcissa, his father’s idiocy is clearly in him.”</p><p>“But he is still our son,” Mrs. Malfoy said. “If you remind him of that every so often, he wouldn’t be so rebellious.”</p><p>“A Malfoy in Gryffindor… I still cannot believe it,” Mr. Malfoy said. “We have been in Slytherin House for generations, only to have him—his father’s influence on him is clearly superior to ours.”</p><p>“Would you rather it be his grandfather?” Mrs. Malfoy asked, frowning. “I mean, he would have our values but…”</p><p>“Our Lord was a… fearful man, but he knew and commanded respect,” Mr. Malfoy said. “That is what Harry needs to do. Learn about respect. To blame me for—”</p><p>“Well, the howler was a little excessive,” Mrs. Malfoy frowned. “But I’m sure that he forgave you months ago, and is just ready to apologize for his behavior. Which I am really looking forward to for this strife between you two is headache-inducing.”</p><p>“I am sorry that Harry’s behavior is physically affecting you, Narcissa,” Mr. Malfoy frowned, sounding sincere. Harry couldn’t help but glare at him. His behavior? His! Harry wasn’t the one who sent a Howler just for getting sorted into the wrong house! He wasn’t the one who constantly spanked him when he did wrong! He wasn’t—</p><p>“Perhaps I will get him something that he would love,” Mr. Malfoy said. “That should cool Harry down, and hopefully make him forget about his stupid little angers.”</p><p>“Maybe that will work… but I doubt our son can be bribed so easily,” Mrs. Malfoy said.</p><p>“Don’t you worry about it, my dear, I will take care of Harry’s and my little squabble,” Mr. Malfoy chuckled. “But in the meantime, there is a letter to Yaxley that I need to finish. Did you hear about what the Ministry is planning to do? Raids! There is talk of the Ministry raiding several homes to search for Dark Artifacts.”</p><p>“Oh dear… that would be horrible,” Mrs. Malfoy frowned. “I just found my great-great-Aunt’s cursed necklace just lying in a shop!”</p><p>Mr. Malfoy chuckled. “A shop? That was fortunate.” He placed his arm around Mrs. Malfoy’s waist and they started walking towards the hallway Harry just leaved. Harry hugged the wall and slowly moved away.</p><p>“It was, Delilah and I were on an outing and found a jewelry shop down at Paris…” Mrs. Malfoy’s voice died out as the double doors closed behind them. Harry stayed where he was for a couple of minutes before running back to the staircase. His feet lead him up the stairs, jumping at them two at a time, and turning left into his and Draco’s hallway. Draco was still waiting by his open door and Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak off and smiled, “I got it!” he said.</p><p>Draco jumped slightly and smiled. “Great! Where are Mother and Father?”</p><p>“They’re going to Father’s study,” Harry said with a hint of anger. Draco just nodded and said, “I’ll take care of Hedwig, alright? If there’s any letters you want to send just put the cloak on and come to my room.”</p><p>“Alright, thank you Draco,” Harry said. He walked in and closed the door behind him. He heard Draco’s voice calling out, “Harry! What’s the locking spell again?”</p><p>“Umm… <em>Colloportus</em>,” Harry said.</p><p>“<em>Colloportus!</em>” Draco cried out loud and Harry heard his door lock itself. “Good night Harry!”</p><p>“Good night Draco! Thank you!” Harry called through the door. He listened as Draco walked away from his room. He turned and made his way to his desk and pulled out the small black book. “Okay… what are you?” Harry asked.</p><p>The book didn’t respond, naturally, so Harry took the book again and opened the cover. There was something written there, looking very faded. <em>“T.M. Riddle.”</em></p><p>“A diary?” Harry asked, flipping through the blank pages again. “Why would Father have a diary? Did it even work?” He reached for a bottle of ink and quill. He dipped the quill in the ink and hovered it over the page, taking a moment to think what he should even write about.</p><p>He seemed to hesitate a little too long as a small blot of ink fell from his quill onto the page. Harry watched as it fell, marking the clean yellow page. Then, before he could reach his wand to clean up the mess, Harry watched as the ink disappeared, as if it was just absorbed by the page, leaving it clean. Harry’s eyes widened and he quickly flipped the pages to see if there was any residue, but there wasn’t. All the pages were as clean and as yellow as they were when Harry found it. “Woah…” Harry said. “It must be like a secret-keeper or something!”</p><p>He decided to try it out, and quickly wrote down, <em>“My name is Harry Potter-Malfoy and I hate my grandfather!”</em></p><p>He watched in amazement as the words began to sink into the page again. He was about to write more when the most surprising thing happened: More words appeared, but they weren’t Harry’s, or even in his handwriting.</p><p><em>“Hello Harry Potter-Malfoy, why do you hate your grandfather?”</em> the diary seemed to be asking him. Harry gasped. The diary can speak back! Deciding it would be rude to not answer the diary’s question, Harry dipped his quill back into the bottle of ink and wrote back.</p><p>
  <em>“My grandfather is complicated. He is Lord Voldemort, but he never knew me or my dad even existed. I met him for the first time this year at Hogwarts. All I wanted to know was why he tried to kill my dad and… his answer just made me angrier than I was before!”</em>
</p><p>His words seeped into the pages of the diary before it responded. <em>“Lord Voldemort is your grandfather? Interesting… Why did his answer make you angry Harry?”</em></p><p><em>“Because… because he told me that he only had my dad to kill him! That he didn’t care and—with everything that happened with my adopted father, it’s too much,” </em>Harry wrote back. He paused, frowned, then added, <em>“You know about Voldemort?”</em></p><p>His question disappeared into the page, but no response came, as if the diary was processing how to answer Harry’s question. It took a minute, then words started to appear. <em>“Of course I do, Harry. Lord Voldemort was just as known when I went to Hogwarts fifty years ago. I am a memory of my former self. My name is Tom Riddle, it is a pleasure to meet you, Harry. It is horrible that Lord Voldemort would consider such a thing. But tell me, how did you get my diary?”</em></p><p>For some reason Harry felt an odd piece with the diary, as if he found himself a secret friend who he could tell all of his own secrets and worries, and have confidence that Tom wouldn’t tell anyone. He dipped his quill in the ink bottle again and wrote, <em>“You—it was in my father, adopted father’s study. He took my wand away even though I did NOTHING wrong and I sneaked to go get it. I saw your diary on his desk and decided to just take it.”</em></p><p>His words disappeared once again, and Harry waited for Tom’s response, and was not disappointed.</p><p><em>“Taking away your wand? What a horrible thing to do. A wizard should always carry his wand Harry, always. Nobody has any rights to take it away, adopted father or biological. I know that better than anyone. Harry, would you please tell me fully what makes you so angry?” </em>the diary asked.</p><p><em>“Okay, I’ll try, give me a minute,” </em>Harry wrote. He kept his quill in the ink bottle for a moment to collect his thoughts. <em>“I think it actually started with the beginning of the year, really. My adoptive Father and Mother, my brother and really everyone thought that I would be in Slytherin because the Malfoy family has been in Slytherin for generations, and since I’m a Malfoy, fa—my adoptive father told me that I have a responsibility to be in Slytherin. But instead I was sorted into Gryffindor like my real dad. The next day my adoptive father sent a Howler which yelled at me in front of the entire school. It was so humiliating that I just ran outside before anyone could start laughing. Draco, my brother, had to run after me and even though afterwards my Godfather and mother—adoptive mother—sent me nice letters that reassured me, my adoptive father never apologized. And still hasn’t! It’s been an entire school year and he had never apologize! He just carried on like normal as if he did nothing wrong—just went on ordering me and Draco around! He didn’t mail me for months and just before Christmas break he send a letter with just instructions! On how we have to start thinking about girls—I don’t like girls! Not the way he is telling us to! And neither does Draco! So we just spent Christmas at Hogwarts with the Weasleys and it was the best! It was so relaxing just not being with my adoptive father and listening to his orders!</em></p><p>
  <em>“During the year we’ve found out that my grandfather was still alive, and he was after something called the Philosopher’s Stone. It’s a stone that you can use to make an Elixir of Life, you can become immortal with it! Grandfather was going to use it to gain his body back, he was on the back of our Defense Against the Dark Art’s teacher’s head. Myself, my brother Draco, and our friends Ron and Hermione went to stop him. They all went willingly to help me, and I wouldn’t be able to do it without them. It was dangerous, really dangerous, but we had to get the stone before my grandfather could. We’ve succeeded in saving the stone, and the school and my godfather Sirius were very thankful for what we did, but my adoptive father hated it. He yelled at me tonight, saying it’s my fault, that I dragged Draco to danger—even when Draco argued back! </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“He always blames me, punishes me more heavily than Draco. He grounded me, taking away my wand, my broom, everything I owned—even my stuffed basilisk! All he left were my school books, quills, and ink. It’s like he locked me away, I’m not even allowed to have my pet owl Hedwig in here. It’s not fair Tom! Why does he treat me so badly when Draco doesn’t even get a scratch?”</em>
</p><p>Harry’s words at the end were rushed, the quill pressing down too hard but still they sunk into the diary all the same. Harry fumed to himself as he waited for the dairy to reply, knowing that it will take a while for it, <em>him?</em>, to respond. Words began to appear again a minute later.</p><p>
  <em>“I see… I believe that you are in the right, Harry, Mr. Malfoy has no right of punishing you like he currently is. However, I must ask, how is your relationship with Draco Malfoy? You seem to be putting a barrier between your adoptive parents, but you openly call Draco your brother.”</em>
</p><p>Harry wrote immediately, <em>“I love him! I’ve known Draco since we were both three, we grew up together! He really is the best brother I could ask for.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“I see, thank you for satisfying my curiosity. Now, it does seem that Mr. Malfoy is actively, or maybe subconsciously, be distancing himself from you once he saw that you will not be exactly as he envisioned you to grow into. Tell me, was your father like that? How about your mother?”</em>
</p><p>Harry frowned. He hesitated before writing, <em>“I don’t know much about my dad and mum, only what others told me. They were friends who Dumbledore forced together through love potions. My dad was really in love with my Godfather Sirius Black. They were going to marry… my dad created and took a pregnancy potion and spell just so that they both could have me. My dad was a Parselmouth like me, and he was obsessed about learning about Voldemort and the Dark Arts, but only to figure out why Voldemort left him. Like I said before, my grandfather killed my dad before ever knowing the truth. My mum on the other hand… she was a muggleborn, very nice according to Sirius and his friend Remus (they’re living together, you see Sirius got a house and—I’ll tell you that another time). From what pictures I could find, and from what I could see in the Mirror of Erised, I look exactly like my father except I have my mother’s eyes.”</em></p><p>
  <em>“I see… thank you for sharing this with me Harry. It seems that we have a lot in common, little one. I lived in an orphanage during my childhood. It was bleak, horrible. I had no friends, no idea who my family was. All I had was my father’s name for my own and grandfather’s name for my middle. I was a very lonely child.”</em>
</p><p><em>“But you’re not lonely, now are you? I mean, you’re a diary but now you have me,” </em>Harry wrote.</p><p>
  <em>“Correct… and who knows, maybe I’ll show you some of my own memories later on, if you would like that?”</em>
</p><p><em>“Yes!” </em>Harry wrote quickly.</p><p>
  <em>“Good. But for now, since you tell me that you are a Hogwarts student, you must have summer assignments correct? You should finish them, that way you have more time for me and your precious Draco.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“But I don’t want to stop writing to you.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Do your work. I will always be here.” </em>
</p><p>Harry grumbled to himself but did as he was told. Muttering foul words, but feeling lightly relieved from telling the diary his problems, Harry took his schoolbooks off of the bookshelf, returned them to the desk and, with annoyance at he can’t do anything else, started his summer homework.</p><p> </p><p>Harry snuck out of his room regularly during the next two weeks. The only reason Harry would stay in his room was to write in the diary, which he did every day. The more he wrote, the more streamlined his thoughts seemed to become and his anger and annoyance at Mr. Malfoy started to wane only to grow again whenever he is forced to interact with the man.  A week into his grounding, Harry stopped talking to Mr. Malfoy in general during the meals, instead only facing Draco, even when Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy were talking to him. He just did not care. Harry seemed to realize that Mr. Malfoy was never going to apologize, and the fact, along with Mrs. Malfoy not calling Mr. Malfoy out, or being on Harry’s side, just fueled his anger, which he wrote about in great lengths to the dairy.</p><p>Tom was always patient with Harry, he always allowed the young boy to vent to him before telling the young Gryffindor advice. At the end of the two weeks, Mr. Malfoy entered Harry’s room just as he finished an essay for Transfiguration.</p><p>“Harry,” he said. “Since you have been well-behaved during your punishment, I have thought to give you a gift.” He reached for something leaning against the wall and presented a sleek, black-wooden broomstick. “It is far superior to that broomstick Black got you,” he said with an un-turned nose. “This is the newest model: The Nimbus Two Thousand and One.”</p><p>“I don’t want it,” Harry said immediately. “I want my broomstick and my toys.”</p><p>Mr. Malfoy’s expression soured. “You will take your gift, Harry, and maybe I will think of returning you your toys when your behavior improves. Just be glad that I am not asking you to apologize.”</p><p>“Apologize? For what! I did nothing wrong!” Harry yelled out.</p><p>“Nothing wrong? You did everything wrong! You endangered my son—”</p><p>“I am your son!” Harry yelled. “Or have your forgotten you’ve adopted me?”</p><p>Mr. Malfoy’s sour expression turned livid. “Two more weeks, <em>Potter</em>,” He snarled before slamming the door again. Harry screamed and banged his fist on the door. Still angry, he turned from the door and to the diary, writing in big, hasty letters. Tom was patient as always and told Harry comforting thoughts, as well as giving him as much advice as he could (<em>“It seems that your own adoptive father doesn’t even respect you Harry.”</em>)</p><p>Harry refused to even get out of his room after that. As long as Mr. Malfoy was home, Harry spent his time locked in his room either pacing around, laying in his bed bored, or writing to Tom. A month without going outside the manor paled his skin. The day before his birthday, Harry looked at his figure in the mirror. He had grown somewhat, though he was still very small for his age. His skin, which was once lightly tanned, was now pale white, almost marble-like. He frowned, thinking of how much he looked like his grandfather in the Mirror of Erised. His black hair grew even more wild, now covering his ears and brushing the back of his neck, and his glasses sat at the end of his nose.</p><p>He sighed and heard his door opening. It was time for breakfast. As always, he ignored Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy as he sat down to eat, smiling softly at Draco.</p><p>“Well Harry,” Mr. Malfoy said, “Have you learned anything from your punishment?”</p><p><em>Plenty, </em>Harry thought to himself. He looked at Mr. Malfoy for the first time but before he could answer, the owls arrived with their morning mail. One of which was a very small owl who landed in front of Harry. Harry looked over at Draco to see that he too got a letter. Harry quickly opened his to see his friend Ron Weasley’s familiar handwriting.</p><p>
  <em>Harry!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Do you want to come over to the Burrow and stay for the rest of summer? We all miss you and Draco. I would invite Draco too but Blaise wrote to me saying that he and Draco were going to spend some time together so I thought that this would be the perfect time for you to spend some more time with us. I’ve asked my Mum and Dad and they say that it’s okay, so how about it?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ron</em>
</p><p>“What are your letters?” Mrs. Malfoy asked.</p><p>“Oh, Blaise is wondering if I could spend the rest of the summer with him and Mrs. Zabini,” Draco said. “They’re going to Italy for three weeks.”</p><p>“That sounds like fun, and Delilah have been telling me all about it,” Mrs. Malfoy smiled. “I think it’s a good idea, how about you, Lucius?”</p><p>“Of course, I’ll have the elves pack your things immediately,” Mr. Malfoy smiled. He turned to Harry and his smile completely vanished. “And you? What is your letter?”</p><p>“Ron invited me to spend the rest of summer at the Burrow since Draco and Blaise are going to Italy,” Harry said, his stomach falling at the lithesome look in Mr. Malfoy’s eyes.</p><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Why not!”</p><p>“Because you have done nothing to deserve this outing,” Mr. Malfoy said.</p><p>“Nothing! I’ve been trapped in my room all month because of you!” Harry yelled. “I did nothing wrong! You just decided that I was in trouble and locked me in the room!”</p><p>“You will not talk to your father like that, Harry!” Mrs. Malfoy yelled. “Apologize immediately.”</p><p>“For what? For saying the truth? He locked me in my room for saving the Philosopher’s Stone! And how many times do we have to tell you two, Draco went willingly with me! Why can’t you be happy about what we’ve done like Sirius?”</p><p>“Because I am not that stupid, disgusting f—poof of a mutt!” Mr. Malfoy said angrily. “I am your father, and you will respect me!”</p><p>“No!” Harry yelled. He slammed his hands on the table.</p><p>“Harry!”</p><p>“No! You don’t respect me!” Harry yelled. “You lock me in my room while Draco doesn’t even get a minute of punishment! It’s not fair!”</p><p>“Draco did nothing wrong—”</p><p>“He went into the corridor with me! He went through the trapdoor with me! He faced everything I did! Why is it that he is allowed to do these things and I’m not?” Harry demanded.</p><p>“Because he was not the one dragging my son into these dangerous situations, Harry,” Mr. Malfoy said, saying Harry’s name was as much venom as he could.</p><p>Harry just stared at Mr. Malfoy and said in a cold voice, “I wish I wasn’t adopted.”</p><p>Mr. Malfoy challenged Harry’s stare. He stood up silently and walked around the table, his footsteps seemingly echoing throughout the room as Draco and Mrs. Malfoy watched, both too shocked for words. Mr. Malfoy grabbed Harry’s letter when he was near enough and silently tearing it apart, letting the fragments fall to the floor. “You are never going to see those disgusting Weasleys or Black ever again, Potter,” he said coldly.</p><p>Harry stood up suddenly. He left the room, ignoring Mrs. Malfoy’s calls as Mr. Malfoy returned to his seat. Harry went to his room and locked the door behind him. He let out an angry scream before opening the diary again, hastily writing <em>“Ron invited me to his home. I don’t want to be near Mr. Malfoy anymore! I’m using my Cloak to get my things and go to the Burrow. You’re coming with me.”</em></p>
