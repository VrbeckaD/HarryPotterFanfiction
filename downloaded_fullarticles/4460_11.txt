  <p>It is 2024 and the kettle, like the Third Wizarding War, is on. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Albus, responding to the kettle’s excruciating screech, takes it off the boil and pours freshly steaming water into two mugs, stirring each in turn with robotic rhythm. Once they have been brewed to satisfaction, he takes the small milk jug and adds a splash to each drink, staring listlessly at the billows of dissolving milk blend into the mixture and turn a dull tweed brown. After giving both of them another stir, he takes the two mugs and carries them slowly into the living room.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“This sounds odd, but I’m not really in the mood for tea,” says Scorpius, who is sprawled on the sofa facing the large balcony window, as he takes one of the mugs and sets it down on the table. “Thanks anyway, though.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Sighing deeply, Albus takes a seat in the tattered arm chair positioned diagonally from the kitchen door. “I don’t know, Scorps. I really don’t know.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Well, we can’t just sit around until they come and seize us in our own home, can we?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“But what else is there to do? File for injury? We’re in perfect health.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Poor us.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“We could say we broke our wands — but they would only give us new ones, so scratch that.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Scorpius shifts around a bit on the sofa until he is lying almost flat, his legs propped up against the arm rest. “Well,” he begins, turning himself to face Albus better. “What do honest-to-Merlin cripples do to get rejected from the army?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“They break every bone in their body.” </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“So you can either get disfigured on a rain-soaked battlefield or in the comfort of your own home. I say we both jump off the terrace. We’re not high enough to die, just high enough to shatter our bones.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“You must be sky bloody high to think I’m doing that.” Albus picks up his Pixie Pipe from the table and taps a small portion of Pixie dust into it before igniting it with his wand and taking a long, pensive drag. “Why do they have to be called ‘Pixie Pipes’? That name is so — well, you know.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“What?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Hesitant to reply in fear of sounding insensitive, Albus takes a pause and refills his pipe. Then, after taking a rather too hasty drag and causing himself to gag, he responds, “you know. Camp. Kind of…gay.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>At this, Scorpius’ eyes light up, and Albus is worried that he may have said something controversial. He is about to backtrack (after his third drag, of course) but is cut off before he can justify himself.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“That’s it,” Scorpius whispers, as if trying to contain the most amazing secret he has ever harboured. “That’s it, Albus! We need to get gay.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Albus chokes. “Pardon?” A puff of pastel-pink smoke escapes from his lips as he says this, sparkling and filling the air with the intense smell of flowers and sugar. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“I remember Dad telling me,” replies Scorpius, his eagerness mounting. “They still don’t let gay men in the army. They reckon they’ll — you know, fraternise with the other guys.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Nonsense,” Albus scoffs, waving his hand dismissively and shaking his head.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“It’s true!”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“That’s ridiculous. How can they let them marry each other but not go to war alongside each other?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Well, that’s life, isn’t it?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“And — sorry, I know it's a bit inhumane, but surely there’s a spell that decreases libido or… I dunno, turns you straight temporarily. They could just — zap — and it’d be fine. Why is there a rule against it?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Why on earth are you questioning it?” Scorpius laughs incredulously. “Albus — there’s a way we can get out of having to join the army without severely injuring ourselves! How are you not leaping at the idea?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Albus shrugs. “It’s just… It’s a bit of a cop out, you know?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Sorry?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Like, at least if you give yourself dragon pox or something, it’s like, 'look at him, he was so brave that he tried to get out of joining the army by getting a horrible disease'. But, like, nobody says ‘oh look at him, isn’t he brave for bumming that guy to get out of the army.“</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“I think you’re rather missing the point.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“I think you’re a bit too eager to pretend to be gay. You know you don’t have to fancy men to wear a dress, right?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“I don’t — would you stop bringing that — look, you don’t have to have sex with anyone to get out of the army. It’s about who you’d like to have sex with.” Scorpius taps his temple smugly, raising an eyebrow at Albus. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Reluctantly, he mimics the gesture in agreement. “I suppose you’ve got a point.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“As usual.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“But…but how do we convince them we’re benders, then? We can’t just bend them over the table and —“</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Oh, pack it in, for goodness’s sakes! Not everything is about sex.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“What is ‘everything’ about, then?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Scorpius considers this. “We need to dress like them.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Now, hold on —“</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“I know, I know,” he says, holding up his hands defensively. “I’m not saying they all dress the same, but we’ve got to really push the image. And — well, we won’t need to be doing any bending over, Mr. Sex Drive, if they think we’re taken.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>When Scorpius does not elaborate on this, Albus sets his pipe down and leans forward on his chair, glaring at his friend severely. “What, exactly, do you mean by that?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“I mean,” Scorpius presses, not quite meeting his eye. “If we — well, we could pretend to be…you know.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Scorpius —“</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Just for a bit, until they —“</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Not in a million —“</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Albus —“</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Scorpius!"</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>They glare at each other furiously, Scorpius now on his feet.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“All I’m saying —“</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“No!” Albus barks. “Scorpius Malfoy, if you think for a second I am going to pretend to date you —“</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Well, why don’t you go get shot up in No Man’s Land and you can never date anyone again?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>This strikes a rather harsh chord, and the room (already scented with the sickening smell of lit Pixie dust) seems to echo with the silence that ensues. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“You know I don’t want to do that.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Then let’s be gay,” Scorpius insists, taking Albus by the hands and shaking them forcefully. “Just until this stupid war blows over.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>It takes every fiercely heterosexual bone in Albus’ body to look his friend in the eye and finally reply, “fuck you.” This, of course, means yes.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><hr/><p> </p><p> </p>
<p></p><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Ever since their days at Hogwarts ended, sexuality and relationships suddenly seemed to drop from first place on Albus and Scorpius' list of priorities to, maybe, 25th place. At the top of the list nowadays are taxes, and rent, and groceries, and trying to play hooky from the Wizard army.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Neither of them have been much in the way of athletic, and their magical abilities are fine for two average adult Wizards but they aren’t anywhere up to the standard the Ministry of Magic’s armed forces expect.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Due to the drafting law of who-cares-when, all Wizards of or above the age of seventeen who have a licence to use magic — which is about eighty percent of the wizard population as of 2023 — are required to join the Wizarding armed forces in dire circumstances; an example of such a dire circumstance would be, as in this case, a war. Perhaps, even, the third instalment in a series of three great wars (that were only great in size, since if you knew the shit that went down during some of these wars you would be calling it anything but ‘great’).</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>These Wizarding wars are not to be confused with the Muggle world wars, which were merely trivial affairs. The Minister of Magic at the time of the one that began these silly little skirmishes even said, ‘this could all have been avoided if they had banned the Imperious curse in Austria’. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The first two Wizarding wars involved a rather eccentric man named Voldemort, but the third (which started early one Tuesday morning when a Witch from the east end of London insulted another Witch’s wife on her gardening techniques) has absolutely nothing to do with him. Somehow, however, it has grown enough to create the dire circumstance in which the magical world of England is in need of soldiers.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>This is all you need to know about the political state of the Wizarding world to understand why two wizards would go to the lengths some of them go to avoid joining the army.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Name?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Potter and Malfoy.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Just one at a time, please.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Albus glances over to Scorpius for reassurance before replying tentatively, “um, actually, Sir…we were rather hoping you could do us — draft us, that is — together?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“I’m sorry?” The draftsman frowns.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Please, Sir,” Scorpius insists with the most timid voice he can manage. “You see, we’ve been together ever since we were little, so it just makes sense that we were kept together throughout our military… Uh…”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Escapades,” Albus finishes.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Indeed.” Evidently unsettled, the Draftsman pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose and flourishes the two documents before taking a closer look. “Is this a checkmark?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>He presents Scorpius’ paper to them, his index finger pointing to a question that reads ‘Have you ever had a homosexual experience?’, with two boxes labelled ‘Yes’ and ‘No’. Inside each box, a little star has been doodled.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“It looks more like a smudge to me, Sir,” Albus replies, smiling gaily.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The draftsman grunts. “So? Are you or aren’t you?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Am I or am I not what, Sir?” Scorpius asks, making sure to pronounce the ‘h’ clearly on ‘what’.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“You can read, can’t you?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Oh, yes, sir.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Well?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Well,” Scorpius replies, slowly taking off his round, rose-tinted sunglasses. “The question doesn’t ask if I am or am not anything, Sir. I mean, how do you define an ‘experience’?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Albus bites his lower lip, furiously containing a laugh. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Have you ever had sex with a man?” the draftsman asks.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>With a tiny giggle, Scorpius gracefully folds up his glasses and tucks them into the collar of his Hawaiian shirt. “Oho, well, that’s awfully matter-of-fact of you, Sir.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Have you or have you not had sex with a man — Malfoy, is it?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Well?” The draftsman’s raccoon’s tail of a moustache quivers as his impatience grows.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Well,” Scorpius replies. “In a manner of speaking — no.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“What about you, son?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Me?” Albus places a delicate finger on his chest. “Oh, chance’d be a fine thing.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Scorpius shoots him a glacial glare.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“— But that’d be no."</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Alright, then,” the draftsman concedes. “If that’s all…”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Panic begins to rise in Scorpius’ chest, and he grabs Albus by the hands, caressing them ostentatiously. “Oh, Al, can you believe it? It’s our dream come true, we’re going to be in the army! At last! Oh, it’s going to be so much fun, living with all those men…”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The draftsman eyes them, his gaze edged with scrutiny. “Now, hold on. Why don’t you two lads go into that room over there and answer a few more questions with Officer Wilde here?” He gestures to the man standing behind him in a grey suit, who is also giving the two of them a good stare. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>They feign surprise and concern, but instantly set about following the Officer into another room to be questioned.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“We’re almost there, Scorp,” Albus susserates, just loud enough for Scorpius to hear. “I think I like being gay. These leggings have really boosted my self-esteem.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Be quiet,” Scorpius hisses, although he must admit his own flared white trousers make him feel like quite the rockstar. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The Officer stops at a door labelled ’INT15’ and gestures for them to enter. “Just in here, boys.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“What does the label stand for?” Scorpius asks.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Muggle's rights,’ drawls the Officer, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Just go in.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The three of them enter and Officer Wilde presents Scorpius and Albus with two chairs opposite the desk in the centre, which he then sits at. As the two young Wizards sit down, he reaches into one of the drawers at his desk and takes out a brown file spilling over with papers. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“I’m going to ask you a series of questions,” he begins, adjusting his tie and studying them closely. His eyes rest on Scorpius’ small triangle of exposed chest, where he has undone all the top buttons of his shirt. The Officer frowns. “It’s all basic procedure. Please don’t be alarmed by what I may ask."</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Of course not, Sir,” Scorpius and Albus chime in almost perfect unison.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Thoroughly unsettled by this, he turns to Scorpius and stares at him over the rims of his glasses. “Are you a homosexual?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Scorpius bridles and blinks rapidly. “No.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Officer Wilde turns to Albus and repeats, “Are you a homosexual?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Perish the thought,” he replies, clutching his chest and looking deeply offended. “Uh — Sir.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Right.” The Officer brandishes his wand and flicks it at a nearby quill, and it begins to scratch notes onto a piece of parchment beside him. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Scorpius and Albus share a conspicuous look of concern before turning back to face him.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The Officer directs his attention to Scorpius again. “Do you ever wear women’s clothes?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“I’m no drag queen, Officer,” he replies indignantly, raising his eyebrows and pursing his lips.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The Officer sighs, then turns to Albus. “How about you?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Eyeing the hastily scribbling enchanted quill and refusing to meet the Officer's eye, Albus replies, “Don’t you think that’s just a bit… Much?.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The quill speeds its work up, frantically flicking to and fro on the page. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Who do you prefer, in terms of friendship,” the Officer presses on. “Young boys or… Mature men?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Well, I think when you really love someone,” Scorpius replies, making sure to flick his eyes over at Albus momentarily. “It shouldn’t matter how old they are.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Officer Wilde’s eyebrows are raised so high that they almost disappear past his receding hairline. “I see. And you, Potter?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“Do I have to choose?” Albus asks, blinking innocently.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The questions continue for another half hour, increasing in absurdity as they progress. Then, the officer presents them with an image of scantily clad woman lying in a suggestive position on a chaise lounge, the tip of her wand resting against her lips. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>“What do you think of her?”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Scorpius, who has since put his rosy shades back on, takes them off very slowly again, his eyes widening. “Oh, that chair is heavenly.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>The Officer purses his lips, squinting at him warily. Then he turns to Albus and repeats his question, as usual.</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Albus shakes his head, wrinkling his nose. “Hair’s too long.”</p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p> </p>
</div><div align="justify">
  <p>Another piece of parchment flies out of one of the drawers by itself and places it over the previous one, allowing the enchanted quill to continue about its work. </p>
</div><div align="justify">
