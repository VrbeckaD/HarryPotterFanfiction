    <b>Albus</b>
  </em>
</p><p>Albus Potter had it all. Recently appointed Head Boy, Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, and devastatingly handsome. At seventeen, he was already several inches taller than his father, with broad shoulders and toned arms, developed after years of aggressively swinging a beater's bat. His piercing emerald eyes, olive skin, and devilishly mussed black hair, such like his dads, were complimented by a spray of light freckles dusted across the expanse of his nose and cheeks. </p><p>He was athletic, well-liked, smart, and the son of the Chosen One. Even his placement in Slytherin did little to hinder his popularity; although it had been a hot bit of gossip in Rita Skeeter’s Daily Prophet column and contributed to his <em>‘lovable bad boy’ reputation.</em> As a result, beautiful girls from all houses practically threw themselves at him on a regular basis.</p><p>Al also had the best group of friends anyone could ask for, a gang of Slytherin boys who’d been mates since their first year; Marc Fawley, Amir Shafiq, Jordan Zabini, and Joseph Blurr. The lot were affectionately known as the Firebrand Band because of their knack for good-natured shenanigans, a feat that was undoubtedly aided by the bit of old parchment Albus had nicked from the famous Harry Potter’s study during the summer before his third year.</p><p>Yes, Al’s life was perfect, it seemed.</p><p>Yet Albus had a secret. A secret that he’d been hiding from everyone, including his family, for years. He was completely and without a doubt, one hundred percent gay. He’d known it since he was thirteen, when he’d found himself enthusiastically wanking to a poster of the legendary Quiberon Quafflepunchers Keeper, Lucas Dubois. He had never looked at a girl with the same longing and desire that he did watching Dubois fly through the goals with the wind in his dirty blond hair and sweat clinging to the small patch of chest visible just above the v-neck of his jersey.</p><p>He wasn’t ashamed of it. At least, that’s what he told himself. If he were anyone else he would scream it to the heavens, others' thoughts be damned. It wasn’t as though he was the only bent lad at Hogwarts, right? But he wasn’t anyone else. He was a Potter. And whether Albus wanted it or not, the Wizarding World had certain expectations. He was to play Quidditch exceptionally, make good marks, and date respectable, intelligent, <em>girls.</em></p><p>So, he did.</p><p>He kept his preferences to himself while dating the occasional girl to keep up the façade, staying with them for a couple of weeks before turning them away politely. He knew it wasn’t entirely right to get their hopes up, to lead them on. Therefore, he always made sure to treat them with the highest degree of chivalry, take them on expensive dates to Hogsmeade, while never going further than a few chaste kisses. </p><p>This behavior led to two different assumptions about Albus, depending on whom you asked. One, that he was a hopeless romantic who was always searching for the perfect girl, or that he an egotistical pretty boy who was impossible to please. He didn’t mind the rumors, though. They lent an excuse as to why he hadn’t yet had a serious relationship, without having to make the excuses himself.</p><p>The prospect of never being able to go after something, or someone that he could be truly happy with should have depressed him immensely; and at his most vulnerable times, it had. However, he’d long since accepted that inevitability. You see, Albus Severus was doomed to the same fate as his namesakes; destined to be both brilliant and alone.</p><p>The lack of a romantic relationship wasn’t the worst fate that could be bestowed upon a man, he’s often reasoned. His life was quite full as it was. Especially now that he was entering his seventh year at Hogwarts. Between N.E.W.Ts, Quidditch, his friends, and pre-career training, he would scarcely have time to sleep, much less brood in self-pity.</p><p>Besides, he thought with a bemused chuckle—as he extracted a few issues of Witch Weekly’s Edge magazine from under his mattress and hid them beneath a few wrinkled robes in his school trunk—just because he wouldn’t have a romantic relationship didn’t mean he had to remain celibate for the rest of his life. Muggles had all sorts of clubs and bars exclusively for guys like him, and he planned to explore a few of them after graduation. The Potter/Weasley legacy meant nothing to Muggles, and it wouldn’t take much for him to alter his features just enough to fool a wizard that might happen upon him in the dim lighting of a bar or the flashing lights of an underground club. </p><p>“What are you chuckling about?”</p><p>Albus nearly jumped out of his skin at the sound of his mother’s voice in the doorway. He’d been so lost in his fantasies about scantily clad Muggle boys dancing lewdly on a crowded dance floor that he hadn’t heard her approaching footsteps. He slammed the lid of his trunk closed guiltily, despite the risqué magazines already hidden safely at the bottom, and turned to her, forcing a nonchalant smile.</p><p>“Hi mum. Er… nothing much. Just imagining the look on Amir’s face when he finds out that I’ve been made Head Boy,” he lied. It wasn’t that difficult. His friend was likely to wail dramatically and declare Albus a goody two shoes now even more beholden to <em>‘the man.’</em></p><p>She laughed and moved to sit on the end of his bed, motioning for him to join her. “I still don’t know how you managed it with all the trouble you and those friends of yours have caused over the years. I suspect McGonagall reckons it will mellow you out.” As soon as he sat down beside her she gathered him in a tight hug and kissed him sloppily on the cheek.</p><p>“Urg, Muuuuuuum,” he complained, trying unsuccessfully to pull away. “Stop kissing me like i'm a baby!”</p><p>“You’ll always be my baby,” she swooned. “Besides, wouldn’t you rather I get the kisses out of the way before we get to the platform, where your reputation as a big manly Quidditch champion could be compromised?”</p><p>She had a point, so Al returned the hug and begrudgingly allowed himself to be doted on.</p><p>“I can’t believe my little boy is going to Hogwarts for the last time. I’m so proud of you,” she said, brushing his carefully tousled hair out of his eyes. “You’re going to have such a great year if you just-.”</p><p>“I know, I know,” he interrupted, having heard it all summer from both his parents. “If I just focus on my studies and don’t allow myself to get too stressed out. Don’t worry, mum, I won’t.”</p><p>She smiled at him fondly and winked. “Actually, I was going to say that if you do what makes <em>you</em> happy, without worrying about what me, your dad, or anyone else thinks, you’ll have a great year.”</p><p>Albus froze momentarily. There seemed to be some hidden meaning behind her words and he didn’t want to think about what that might be. She couldn’t know about <i>that.</i></p><p>“I always do what makes me happy,” he muttered, hoping he didn’t sound as nervous as he felt.</p><p>Ginny frowned, giving him a meaningful look. “Do you really Al?” she asked softly.             </p><p>“O-of course I do.” He internally cursed himself for stuttering out the lie as her frown grew deeper. Ginny Potter was a highly perceptive woman who could usually tell when one of her children was being dishonest, so he decided to change tactics by telling the truth without exactly answering the question. “I’m happy, mum. The Slytherin team is favorite to win the cup this year and Professor Marsh tells me that I’m a shoo-in for St. Mungo’s Medicinal Potions department, if I keep up my marks. I’m looking forward to a great year.”</p><p>His mum squeezed his shoulder affectionately. “I’m glad that you’re happy, Al, however, if… if there’s anything that is keeping you from being happier or more fulfilled, then you shouldn’t let m—.”</p><p>“MUM! HAVE YOU SEEN FRANKLIN? I CAN’T FIND HIM,” Lily bellowed from the next room, breaking the tension that had momentarily developed between the two of them.</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes and planted another kiss on Albus’s cheek as she stood to leave. “Remember what I said, Alby,” she urged-with a look that was far too knowing for his comfort-as she left the room.</p><p>Albus fell back onto the bed and expelled a slow, steadying breath. He closed his eyes, willing his rapidly beating heart to slow to a normal rate while silently thanking his sister’s elusive Pygmy Puff for getting him out of that interaction just in time.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he stood to scan his room one final time for anything that he might have missed, convincing himself that he had nothing to worry about. Even if his mum had suspicions, he had no intention of ever confirming them.</p><p>
  <em>
    <b>Scorpius</b>
  </em>
</p><p>If Scorpius Malfoy could choose one word to describe himself, it would be 'unextraordinary.'</p><p>There was nothing about him that stood out, nothing remarkable.</p><p>Admittedly, he was more clever than the average pupil, but it wasn’t due to a natural talent toward academics. He just worked harder and longer on his studies than many other students did. Partially because his family would accept nothing less, and partly because he didn’t have much else to do.</p><p>He wasn’t popular. Half of his classmates were terrified of him, mistakenly believing that the Malfoys still had strong ties to dark magic. The other half were completely indifferent to him, correctly perceiving him as introverted, mild mannered, and unassertive. Basically… boring.</p><p>In fact, he only had one close friend, fellow Ravenclaw and Prefect Rose Granger-Weasley, who was equally unpopular due to her awkward social skills and knack for saying whatever came to mind despite how blunt or strange it might come across.</p><p>He also wasn’t athletic. He lacked the coordination and agility required to play for his house Quidditch team, much to his father’s poorly concealed disappointment. Scorpius, however, was never particularly put out by this fact; flying made him queasy and his lithe form and delicate bone structure simply weren’t suited for such strenuous physical activity.</p><p>Despite his self-described gangly frame, he’d grown into a nice-looking boy. He’d inherited the regal high cheekbones and thick eyebrows typical of his Greengrass and Black genes, yet his appearance was all Malfoy otherwise; silky blond hair, impossibly pale skin, and piercing silvery-blue eyes.</p><p>Sadly, it didn’t do him much good. His looks had never been enough to entice any romantic interest from his peers. Not that he was interested in that sort of thing. Sure, the thought of engaging intimately with someone—things like holding hands, stolen kisses, and just being physically close to another person—was theoretically appealing. Although, for him, engaging in such a relationship meant putting himself out there, taking risks, and being a bit more forthcoming with his sexuality; something he was only willing to do for the right person.</p><p>Scorpius wasn’t in the closet. He’d told all of his friends that he fancied blokes back in fifth year. The fact that Rose was his only friend and no one else had bothered to ask was entirely irrelevant.</p><p>His family was a different story. On the one hand, he hated keeping secrets from them. Contrary to what the larger Wizarding World might believe, the Malfoys were a happy and extremely close family. They spent a significant amount of time together and Scorpius had always been encouraged to be open about his thoughts and feelings.</p><p>On the other hand, perhaps for the same reasons, he was terrified of disappointing them. He wasn’t worried that they would be disappointed if he chose a pureblood partner or not. His parents had seen far too much in their lives to carry on those archaic views. He also wasn’t especially worried about how they would react to his sexuality. At worst, his mum would coddle him more and his father would be a bit uncomfortable for a while. Actually, that was probably inevitable.</p><p>No, those things could be overcome. However, no matter how supportive they may or may not be, it wouldn’t change the fact that Scorpius being gay meant the end of the Malfoy Dynasty. No more family members, no heir, and no bouncing babies for them spoil. The thought haunted him, because as much as he wanted that for them, he also wanted it for himself.</p><p>He had to tell them, though. And he decided that today would be the day, no backing out. It was the first day of his seventh year, after all.</p><p>So, the morning of September first, Scorpius woke early, double checked that he had packed everything appropriately, and dressed in his best muggle suit. He didn’t wear muggle clothing often, as he found them restricting, but he had a few pieces tailored for occasions like this when he would need to navigate through King's Cross station. He struggled to knot the tie nervously for several minutes before giving up and chucking it into the rubbish bin. Leaving it off was bound to annoy his father, yet he suspected once he talked to him at breakfast, this small indiscretion would easily be forgotten.</p><p>Scorpius stood in front of the elegant cheval glass mirror for what felt like ages, staring at his reflection. Eventually, he decided he looked like a complete ponce and far too formal to board the train for school. Defiantly, he mussed his perfectly combed hair and undid the first three buttons of the white collared shirt. Deciding that he rather liked this more casual look, he slipped on his Italian leather loafers and headed down to breakfast.</p><p>He walked more slowly down to the dining room than he normally would, in an attempt to ease his nerves. He hadn’t exactly planned on how he would approach the subject he so desperately wanted to talk to them about. In an act of desperation, he’d sought out Rose for advice several days prior and regretted it instantly. He loved the girl, he really did, although he didn’t think <em>‘just holler it out before you board the train and run,’</em> was the best idea.</p><p>With a chuckle at the memory, Scorpius pushed open the door to the dining room and strode in. His parents were already at the end of the table, a full spread of English breakfast in front of them. His dad was hidden behind the prophet while his mum looked up and smiled brightly.</p><p>“Good morning, dear,” she greeted. “It’s nearly eight thirty. I was about to send Ruby up to make sure you hadn’t drowned in the bath.”</p><p>Scorpius laughed and bent down to kiss her on the top of the head before taking his seat. “Sorry Mum, I was double checking to make sure everything was packed properly.”</p><p>“Nonsense, Ruby never forgets anything. She’s a top-of-the-line elf,” Draco drawled from behind the morning paper.</p><p>“Right, well I—”</p><p>“Why aren’t you dressed?” His father sat down the paper and frowned at him. “Wasn’t your new tie set out for you?”</p><p>Scorpius fought to suppress a smile. His father was far too predictable. “I am dressed, dad. I don’t need a tie to walk through a train station,” he defended, piling sausages onto his plate.</p><p>Draco’s features contorted into a look of disapproval, his own silver tie knotted perfectly. He muttered what sounded like <em>‘kids these days’</em> while his mother laughed.</p><p>“Don’t be such a prude, love. It’s stylish to look a bit… ruffled. Isn’t that right, Scorpius?”</p><p>“Um, yeah,” Scorpius mumbled, as if he knew anything about what was and wasn’t considered stylish.</p><p>His dad returned to his paper with a snort. “At least brush your hair. Saint Potter struts through the Ministry looking like he has a bird’s nest on his head and it’s seen as a fashion statement. The lack of class is appalling.”</p><p>“Well, I think you look dashing.” Astoria smiled and winked at Scorpius who returned a grin, unseen by Draco. They were both used to comments like this. His father’s irritation at any reminder of The Chosen One was a running inside joke between them.</p><p>His mum then began to prattle on enthusiastically. “Grandpa and Grandma Malfoy owled this morning. They send their love and asked me to remind you to avoid distractions this year. You’re N.E.W.Ts are very important. Papa and Gran sent you a massive box of sweets, which I’m sure you don’t need, but they insist on spoiling you. You will be sure to write them this semester, won’t you? When you don’t write often enough, mum floods me with owls inquiring about your well-being. Do you plan to join any clubs this year? It would look good on your curriculum vitae. The dueling club could be a lot of fun, as long as it doesn’t conflict with your prefect duties.”</p><p>She only paused to breathe, which was just fine for Scorpius. It gave him time to gather his wits. It wasn’t until the food before them disappeared and his father recommended that they get ready to apparate that Scorpius realized that he’d run out of time. </p><p>Draco rose from his chair and headed toward the foyer, stopping momentarily to straighten his own impeccably tailored suit and tie in the hallway mirror. Astoria summoned Ruby to collect his trunk for him, and the bubbly little elf wished them all happy travels before bustling off.  </p><p>“Ready then?” his mum asked as she clasped his father’s hand and held the other out to him.</p><p>Scorpius hesitated in the hallway and took a deep, hardly calming breath, hands balling to fists at his sides in determination.</p><p>"Actually," he mumbled, wincing only slightly at the pitiful tremor he heard in his own voice. "Actually, there's something I'd like to tell you before we go. If... if that's all right?"</p><p>Astoria nodded then looked to her husband for his response.</p><p>"Go ahead then, Scorpius," Draco replied with a slight nod.</p><p>"Well, you see... The thing is..." fumbling for words, Scorpius flicked his eyes about the place, wishing he had done this on a day they weren't about to apparate to a station full of strangers. Was it too late to think up a lie and tell them during Christmas break? No, no, he should just get on with it; rip the bandage off, as it were. "I might be, I mean, I am. The problem is..."</p><p>Scorpius paused, unable to form the words properly.     </p><p>Astoria crossed the room in three quick strides, placing her hands on both of her son's shoulders in an attempt to settle him down. "Just breathe, darling. Whatever it is will be all right."</p><p>Staring down into her warm hazel eyes, he knew in that moment it was the truth. "I'm gay," he finally announced, feeling both a weight lifted from himself and a sudden wash of dread as he awaited their reactions.</p><p>Expectantly, his mother smiled fondly, not a shred of surprise in her expression. Comforted, Scorpius turned to his father who was regarding him with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“Son, we know you’re excited about your seventh year. Your mother and I are happy as well,” Draco said evenly pulling out his wand and magicking the trunk to float. "Well, then, are you ready to go? The train leaves at half past."</p><p>Scorpius gaped at him. How could his own dad misinterpret his meaning so immensely? He could feel the skin on his face begin to burn as he opened and closed his mouth several times before any noise came out. “That’s not… what I meant… I…”</p><p>Scorpius stopped his babbling immediately as his dad began laughing hysterically. Confused, he looked to his mum who rolled her eyes, turned abruptly, and slapped his father on the back of the head. “Draco!”</p><p>“What? I can’t have a go at my own kid?” he gasped out between chuckles.</p><p>“Honestly, we’ve talked about this! We need to be reassuring and supportive,” Astoria argued, still frowning deeply. Scorpius continued to stare, utterly perplexed by the scene before him.</p><p>“Relax, Tori, I was trying to lighten the mood. The boy looked like he was going to sink through the floor.” Draco turned to him, still pink in the face and grinning broadly. “He knows it’s all right, don’t you, son?”</p><p>Scorpius nodded and smiled back sheepishly, the tension in his body loosening considerably. His dad was taking the mickey and in a strange way, that was more comforting than an emotional embrace or regurgitation of supportive words ever could be. Because even in the comfort of his home and family, it was rare for the poised and aristocratic Draco Malfoy to break out in hysterical giggles.</p><p>"What your father means," Astoria butted in, shooting an exasperated look at her husband, "Is that we love you no matter what, and we're glad you had the courage to tell us."</p><p>"T-thank you," Scorpius croaked, blinking owlishly at the two of them. “So, you already knew?”</p><p>His mum winked at him while his father seemed to be trying desperately to suppress more laughter. "Had our suspicions," he quipped.</p><p>“We began to suspect some years ago,” his mother added kindly. "I hope you understand that we didn’t ask you directly because we wanted you to come to us when you were ready. I wish you would have come to us at a time when we could have discussed it more thoroughly.”</p><p>“I disagree,” Draco interjected. “Spot on, Scorpius. Now we don’t have to indulge your mum with an awkward talk about sex and relationships.” </p><p>Scorpius’s mouth fell open at his father mentioning the word sex. “We don’t need to do that. I’ve read books! Pamphlets and things. I know all about it,” he cried in panic, immediately regretting that admission. </p><p>Draco snorted with mirth and Astoria’s face colored slightly, her lips twitching as she too was now struggling not to laugh.  She patted him on the arm lovingly. "That’s very responsible of you, dear. Now, we really should be heading off. Wouldn't want you to miss the train."</p>
