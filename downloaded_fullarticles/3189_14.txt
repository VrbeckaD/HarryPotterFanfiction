    <p>At the beginning of their 6th year at Hogwarts, the marauders and their male classmates found themselves sitting in a large empty classroom before lunch. Sirius, James, Remus, and Peter all sat in a group while talking to the other Griffindors about the surprise lesson.</p><p>"What is this about?" James whispered to their friend Frank. "Also, why are we paired with the Slytherin group." He cringed at that last statement.</p><p>"Beats me. You guys probably got the whole house in trouble... Again." Frank retorted, slightly perturbed.</p><p>"No. It can't be that. The year just started. We may be geniuses of our art, but we're not really fast about it." Sirius added in. He looked around the room at the other students talking.</p><p>"Maybe it's about the OWLS. This is our last year. They count the most right now." Remus said, not looking up from his book.</p><p>The four other boys nodded.</p><p>Peter excitedly piped up. "Maybe it's one of those weird community building things?"</p><p>"With Slytherins?! I'd rather be clubbed by a troll." James whispered loudly. This earned him a death stare from a few of the house members.</p><p>The room went silent as the sound of high heels walked down the aile of desks and to the front of the room.</p><p>Professor McGonagall had been nervous looking all morning. This was new for her. She always had a cool and calm composure, but today she figeted around like a shady rat. Peter assured his friends, that he understood that feeling and earned a laugh from his friends.</p><p>In the silence she began to write very quickly on the large chalkboard. Once she was finished, she sat down her chalk and stayed facing the board.</p><p>"Today we will have a special lesson that assure you I did not wish to teach but the head master felt out of all of us I would be able to keep you all in line."</p><p>The class stared on as Minerva raddled the paragraph off in one breath. She spoke loud enough so her voice could be heard, even bouncing off the board to the ears behind her.</p><p>"Now you are all growing into adults and may have some... Questions."</p><p>There it was. Minerva started again before the silence was too deafening.</p><p>"The basics of your growing prossess is puberty." She wrote the word under 'Sexual education', the first words written. No one had noticed due their shock. The realization could be heard as the boys gasped and whispered to one another. The words the older woman was saying blurred in Sirius, James, Peter's, and even Remus's minds. Sirius did a sweep of the room seeing that three or four students were listening intently, some even taking notes.</p><p>Sirius watched as Daniel, who sat close beside him, listened to Minnie, taking in every word she said.</p><p>Daniel was a chaser for Gryffindor and a really nice guy. He was kinda outgoing, unlike his sister who was fairly shy expect on the pitch. Dawn was one of the best beaters Ravenclaw has ever had.</p><p>The two were from a pure blood family that Sirius was convinced bred quidich players. Daniel was strong and muscular but not in a body builder kinda way. Sirius often teased him with friendly comments underlined with envy. 'Work out any Danny?' Daniel usually replied with something like 'Yeah! Maybe you should try it sometime Black!' the two would smile and laugh at eachother.</p><p>Sirius wondered why Daniel was listening so closely. Sirius and The rest of the class, only heard 'achene', 'mood', 'urges', and 'intercourse'.</p><p>"Alright." She sighed still nervously faceing the board. "Any questions?"</p><p>Sirius heard Daniel clear his throat and watched as he slowly raised his hand.</p><p>Daniel's main flaw was that his social nature only came in short spurts. He could only be in a crowded room for maybe an hour or two hours before he had to take a break. The span was even shorter in most of the attention was on him. He was a little better in a class room setting but only raised his hand for the most pressing of questions.</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Bashir?" Professor McGonagall asked. She'd finally turned around as all eyes fell on Daniel.</p><p>"Um..." He stuttered and all the boys seemed to lean in closer to hear him. "Ne...Ne... Never mind." He shrunk in his chair and the attention fell back to the front of the room.</p><p>Sirius leaned over to Daniel. "What did you want to ask? I could do it if you'd like." Sirius offered. Daniel shook his head.</p><p>"It's nothing... Stupid anyway." He shrunk.</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. "Come on man. Just give in something to say ya know? Break this god awful tension."</p><p>Daniel shyly nodded, scribbled it down on a piece of parchment, handes it to Sirius and quickly put his head down embarrassment.</p><p>Sirius cleared his throat and raised his hand. Minerva had moved on, awkwardly rambling on about any other topic. She turned towards the noise.</p><p>"Ah yes, Mr. Black?"</p><p>"What about our partner? How to we interact with them? Correctly I mean."</p><p>Professor McGonagall had a new sense of confidence with the start of discussion. She now realized she had an opportunity to enducate these boys probably on a subject so few are brave enough to talk about.</p><p>"Ah yes. Well. In... Sexual situations, as in all social situations, communication is key and it is all about what she may enjoy."</p><p>Sirius was the only one who heard Daniel's mumbled question. Before he realized what he was doing, Sirius asked.</p><p>"What if they're not a she?"</p><p>Everyone, especially Daniel, looked on in shock. Sirius felt a small jolt of embarrassment but kept a cool composure.</p><p><br/>"Well, in that case, the approach is still the same. Now there are many different types of sexuality such as hetero sexuality, meaning opposite sex partners, homosexual, same sex partners, and bisexual which is the sexual attraction to both males and females." She wrote every word on the board and the class went on less awkwardly when more students asked questions.</p><p>After the one time lesson, the class was let out early and had a free hour before the rest of their classes.</p><p>"That couldn't of been less awkward." James said as the four friends walked but to their tower.</p><p>A group of Slytherins walked passed.</p><p>"Always figured you were a poof Black." Lucius laughed as his goons joined in.</p><p>"Why is that Malfoy? Wishfully thinking you'd have a chance?" He sassed back to the bully.</p><p>Lucius sneered and stalked away with an angry huff.</p><p>"What a prick." James said.</p><p>"Why did you ask that question Pads?" Peter asked.</p><p>Daniel was walking in front of him and Sirius watched as he flinched slightly at the question.</p><p>"Was just so tired of the silence I guess. The second one was to try and throw Minnie for a loop." He smirked and saw Daniel physically relax.</p><p>"Classic Pads." James laughed and pat his bestfriend on the back.</p><p>"Hey Prongs! Last one to common room is a rotten egg!" Peter sprinted down the hall passed James, Sirius, and Daniel.</p><p>"No way! You son of a bitch!" James sprint after him.</p><p>Remus chuckled from his spot behind Sirius "I'm going to the library. I'll see you guys later." He walked down a separate all, laughing at his friend's shenanigans.</p><p>The hallway was no empty, save for two students.</p><p>"Oi Black!?" Daniel kinda whisper shouted despite anyone being around.</p><p>Sirius stopped in his tracks as Daniel walked up to him.<br/> <br/>"So um... Thanks for the question thing." The dark haired boy looked down shyly.</p><p>"No problem mate. That silence was killing me." He smiled up at Daniel who was a head taller than him.</p><p>"No I really mean it... But... About the second question. Do you think we could leave that between us?"</p><p>Sirius nodded sincerely. "These lips are sealed." He zipped his mouth. "Was kind of curious about it myself to be honest. Always wondered how two guys especially two girls do it." He admitted.</p><p>Daniel chuckled. "Yeah. Human sexuality as always interested me, then when given the chance to learn I... Blow it, so to speak."</p><p>The two shared a hardy laugh before saying good bye and going their separate ways.</p><p>At the tower, Peter and James decided to play a game of chess, leaving the dorm empty for Sirius to take a nice quiet nap.</p><p>James raced passed Sirius to grab is chess set from the room. He always preferred using his own. These were spelled to reassembled if broken. They hadn't had to, yet.</p><p>"That was super weird don't you think? I mean, professor McGonagall talking about that stuff. Ugh I won't wank for a month." James fumbled through his chest.</p><p>"Please Prongs. You probably popped a boner during lesson."</p><p>James spun around and flashed Sirius a devilish smile. "For you may be."</p><p>Sirius laughed at his mate's obviously joking tone. "Oh yeah?"</p><p>"Oh yes Pads." He fell into his friend. "I've wanted you since day one! I can't hide it any longer." He swooned dramatically.</p><p>"I see." Sirius took on a much deeper voice. "What was it that Minnie said?" He raked his mind for the only words he slightly remembered.</p><p>"There is no harm in..." James pouted and ran his hand up and down Sirius's chest. "Experimenting."</p><p>Sirius couldn't hold back he laughter any longer. "Get fucked!"</p><p>In swift movements, the two found themselves wrestling around the room. Elbows flying, fist flailing, ending in James in a head lock. Sirius drug him to James's bed and pinned him. Both out of breath they laughed and eventually calmed. Sirius now noticed James was still pinned under him, his breath gracing Sirius's face. They were centimeters apart. James leaned up pressing his lips to Sirius's. It was... Weird.</p><p>They both pushed away. in slight disgust. What bothered Sirius most was that it was James. The thought of kissing a boy, however, was very exciting. He'd never tell James that though.</p><p>"Nope! Not for me!" James wiped his lips with his wrist.</p><p>"Me neither. Blech!" Sirius did the same.</p><p>The two laughed and James went down stairs to play with peter.</p><p>Sirius was left alone. The feeling of another boy's lips lingering on his.</p><p>He laid in his four post with the curtains drawn. He played the lesson back in his head, trying to look through the awkwardness. The parts about sex and wanking were really fuzz, almost completely blocked out.</p><p>He knew his body! He didn't need an 80 year old woman to tell him what to do, walk him through masterbation. The idea of that disturbed him greatly. He cringed.</p><p>'There is no harm in experiment.' He remembered that and repeated it in his own voice.</p><p>He removed his clothes and began to touch himself slowly. Girls from filthy mags James let him look at flashed through his head. He'd always pictured girls as he wanked. It took forever, but always worked... But then he thought.</p><p>"There is no harm in experimenting."</p><p>A new image popped in his head.</p><p>He sat by the lake, spread out on a blanket, eyes closed, shirtless, the warm sun covering his body. The light was block by a figure.</p><p>"May I sit here?" A low voice asked.</p><p>Dream Sirius opened his eyes to see Daniel's shiney brown eyes looking down at him. Sirius smirked and gestured to the empty spot be side him. Closing his eyes again, he felt Daniel get comfortable beside him.</p><p>It was quiet and peaceful, then he felt a hand on his chest. In reality it was his but in the dream, the caressing hand belonged to Daniel. Sirius looked over to see that he was laying on his side rubbing his essentially hairless chest. He let his pinky finger graze Sirius's right nipple causing a jolt in his body. He'd never thought to touch there.</p><p>It felt oddly... Amazing.</p><p>Dream Daniel twisted it slightly between his fingers. Sirius wriggled under the image's touch.</p><p>"Do like that? When I play with you?"</p><p>Sirius nodded and the imaginary man leaned in and kissed him. The feeling of rough lips and so much tounge was intoxicating. Sirius wrapped his... No. Daniel wrapped his hand around Sirius's throat and grabbed firmly. The imaginary kisses were so distracting he didn't realize Daniel was gropeing him.</p><p>Sirius stroked himself faster and faster until he came hard with a strangled cry.</p><p>'Thank god for silencing charms'</p><p>Sirius sat there in a wet spot of so much cum. More than he'd ever produced before. He was dumbfounded and confused.</p><p>'What. The. Actual. Fuck.'</p><p>The day went on with classes and Sirius hardly had any time to even think about his break. The incident was almost forgotten. At dinner Sirius sat with his friends smiling and laughing, carrying on as if nothing was different. He saw Daniel, with some books and parchment, walking over to his seat further down the griffindor table. He turned around slightly, catching Sirius's staring eyes, he greeted them with a smile and a wink. He fumbled in his sly gesture. Once back on his feet he had bent over to grab his books. This gave Sirius a great view of his ass as the Black heir leaned back to get a clearer look.</p><p>With an exhale a word left his lips. If anyone had been paying attention, the would have undoubtedly heard it. Sirius couldn't even hide his smirk as he looked at Daniel's ass and breathed out.</p><p>'Woof'</p><p>Sirius's face slowly changed from flirty, to stunned, questioning, and finally anoyence. Realization crashed into him as he sighed unintentionally louder.</p><p>"Oh fuck."</p>
