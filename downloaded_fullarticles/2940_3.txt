    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Weird. A word, five letters. It was enough to descript Henrietta if you want a short summary of her. From being a necromancer to the wielder of an ancient sword from her ancestor. Sirius always making sure she aware of her uniqueness. He encouraged it himself claiming a lady should know how to fend herself. Or the Blacks paranoid was catching up with his mind. She lost in the river of her thoughts amidst the crowd. Her eyes blankly stared ahead, not really aware of her destination.<br/>Unlike many of the witches and wizards hurriedly walked among her, she didn't have a single companion. She wasn't pulled along the rushing pace of the wizards around her. Henrietta slowly walking alone, her heart stung. She never thought that they would actually attempt to trick her. <br/>Betrayal was like a bucket of freezing water. Flushed out her naive nature and leave her to fend for the coldness nipping at her skin. Dumbledore had kept her in a charmed bubble, all alone. Sometimes, he added a thorn to prevent her from breaking free. Weasley and Granger were those thorns, so hurtful and calculating. Her once ignorances about the wizarding world sickened her to her stomach. Henrietta was unaware of so much more thing than just fighting to keep herself alive and be the hero they never truly need. At the end of the day, a cold bucket of freezing water was enough to awake Henrie from her stupor. </p><p>All of the truth she was hidden from was finally revealed by Sirius. He took her from the bubble and help her. The man who hid behind the carefully crafted grandfatherly figure lied and lied and only knew how to cover those lied. Henrie would never guess that her friends were mere muppets playing in the grand stage of life. Fools and lies weaved so neatly that not even the truth could cut through them all. Alas, not one she learned truly understand how one's mind worked and how Dumbledore's mind worked. <br/>Henrie never approached the backstage alone. Luckily, some higher powers had changed her fate. She was at the wrong place at the wrong time but they had given her what she always curious about. They said curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction bought it back. She admitted, they used to be a few of the most important people in her life. Then they lost it, in the most hurtful way in the world. Of all the thing under the sun that they could do, they chose to do the only one thing she could never forgive. Betrayal, unloyal, untrustful, She could name various form of its nature. Fear was their motivation. The fear Dumbledore planted in their mind. The fear of Voldemort. He manipulated the stage, writing out the script to each and every actor on the stage like he was the god. Dumbledore was the author of all the misfortuned happened to her. She could choose anyone and she chose Dumbledore to blame for his indirect exploits. <br/>Every time she had to risk her life, they hoped for the worst result. Henrie defied them, she came back alive and kicking even harder than before. The feeling of hope for someone, anyone appeared magically in her life to help her was painfully familiar. The hopefulness was quickly hushed. They just liked to enjoy her misfortunes huh? In that horrible moment, Sirius came like the storm. Unexpected and destroyed all of the unfairness she had received. <br/>"-rie! Henrie." He sighed, feeling relieved. "Thank god I have found you."<br/>She remained silent, still haven't aware of the situation. <br/>"You scared me when I realized that you weren't walking with me. I am too old for this." He gave a pointed glare. Despite his worry expression, there was no heat behind the glare. <br/>"I am here, ain't I?" She shushed him, think Sirius was overreacting. "Let continue shall me, maybe I did it on the intention to escape your nagging." <br/>He huffed, arms crossed over his chest.<br/>"Were you thinking too much again?" He talked after they had been walking for a while. Henrie looked at him strangely, "C'mon, I know."<br/>"Um, yeah?" She said, unsure what was the answer he expected. He suppressed a sigh. The silence was comforting as they continued their journey. The chattering sound coming from the nearby wizards was tuned out. It was liked there were only Henrie and Sirius in their world.</p><p>"We have reached Gringotts." He said softly as talking to a child. He patted her forearm, taking her attention. <br/>"I know," She was reading the warning arched on the marble. Remembering the first time she saw the wizarding world. The culture shock was very funny when you saw yourself back. Amazed by the littlest thing, self pouring tea set was incredibly fascinating for her and it still did. She let out a giggle before recalled what Sirius had taught her. The antique of the high-class society. She straightened her back and held her head with pride before strolling into Gringotts with Sirius.<br/>There was a goblin waiting for them at the end of the lobby. He led them to a private room as they had requested earlier in a letter. The odd of the goblin's decoration, she muses. The walls were hanged with battle axes. There were glass cases displayed with ancient weapons and precious books. Painting of the untold battles never ceased to make Henrie stopped feeling bewildered. A long table awaited for them in a stone chamber. She shuddered through the thin layer of her cloak. The atmosphere changed too quickly indoor and outdoor for her liking. Maybe it was because of the marbles floor and the stone walls that prevent the heat from the sun to warm her up. <br/>"Merry meet, lord Black, heiress Potter-Black," The old goblin sat at the end of the table spoke. The bushy brows nearly covered his beady eyes. They were very sharped despite his appearances. It made her uneased.<br/>"Merry meet you too." The pair greet them back in the Olde way. <br/>The goblin proceeded to discuss about what they had mentioned in the letter.<br/>"Yes of course Lord Black." The goblin said. "We have contact with  Gornock the Potter account manager. I am Urlork the Black account manager. Indeed, we have received a letter from you as the Head of the Blackhouse. The information has made us felt rather unresponsible as it were our duties to protect our clients. Therefore, Gringotts has reopened the sealed documents. What we found had shaken us greatly."<br/>The pair of them leaned in, Sirius was undoubtedly outraged because of their lacks of actions against Dumbledore through the years. He understood that the man was very discreetly but hiding the truth from the goblins? That man must have had the guts of a god to do that. Had he not thinking of the consequences. Whatever he had done, he would have to pay for them.<br/>Beside him, as much as she desperate for the truth, Henrie was calmer than Sirius. She sat in the chair, dreading for the cat to get out of the bag. </p><p>"Dumbledore has illegally accessed into heir Potter-Black's vault without her permission before she came to Hogwarts and years after too. Not only that he had let the other had the accesses and withdrawn the family golds in her vaults, but various heirlooms were also reported to us that they weren't in the vault where they should be. And the artefact either."<br/>Sirius slumped in the chair. His hand covered his face, his eyes stung. His child, his precious child was being stolen from. His hand, which was lying flat on the table suddenly clenched into a tight fist. His body was shaking with rage. THEY WILL PAY FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE!!! <br/>Henrie held to his hand, trying her best to calm Sirius down. His temper was getting thin. She was angry at them too, but it was cold and malice. They took from her the life she would have, and they took from her the last of the possessions her parents left. <br/>The old goblin was wary of Sirius's reaction. He wasn't very stable with the madness of the Black flown in his veins. It was quiet for a moment in the chamber. The tension was hovering around Sirius. The goblin was wise enough to keep quiet, after all, they weren't rushing. The game was playing for years, how can they end it in a matter of hours. <br/>"Mrs Weasley was the most frequent in accessing the account." He started naming the other after Sirius had appeared to calm down. "Miss Granger, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and a few more. Just as you asked, we have found plenty of papers to support your claims. We will bring it to you right away."<br/>"When did those activities start?" Henrie asked as she frowned deeply. Her hands still clutching at Sirius's. <br/>"Since the time you have newly defeated You-know-who, heiress. Sadly, we have to tell you that he still could access to your vaults legally. But he was very mistakenly when he gave them to Mrs Weasley. He has preached his vows."<br/>"What vows?" <br/>"Henrie, you don't know?" Sirius looked at her bewildered. "You were supposed to be under his care."<br/>"What?"<br/>"I may be your godfather but I was sitting in a bloody jail at that time. The ministry decided that Dumbledore was wise and trustful enough to have the custody." She snorted, her lips turned into a thin line. "We will talk later, pup."<br/>"Luckily enough, after Lord Black has been pardoned heiress Potter-Black's custody went to him and with it the responsibility of handling her accounts until she reaches her majority. I had sent a letter to renew your family vault key. Gringotts was deeply sorry to you for not aware of the facts about Heiress Potter-Black's vault until you sent us the letter."<br/>The goblin sighed, the door opened suddenly. It startled the occupants aside from the old goblin. Another one appeared in their line of sight. Beside him was a cart. It was stacked with documents.<br/>"With the discovery of these recent facts," The old goblin referred to them with a wave. "Gringotts has to fulfil its role to Heiress Potter-Black. Do you have any further request for us?" <br/>"Yes, I do have. First and foremost, do you, Gringotts have the ability to forbid the unusual accesses into a client's vault if you found any strange purposes?" The goblin nodded, looking very curious.<br/>"I want to stop any more accesses into my vault, with or without my permission until I gain the Lordship." She stated, feeling rather bold and confident. "But with the exception of Dumbledore, he may do as he pleases until the time comes."<br/> "What an unusual request, heiress. May I ask why?"<br/>"No you may not, sir. I wish that Gringotts would inquire his entrance to my vault and share the report of his accesses."<br/>"Very well, Gringotts will fulfil its duties as requested-" He was going to speak more until Henrie cut in.<br/>"A little blue bird told me that Gringotts could dabble in a particular part of magick. Can you share that to me, sir?"<br/>The goblin gritted his teeth. HOW? How can that girl know?<br/>"It was a very tricky position for me to say, heiress. Unless you tell us where did you find that well-guarded information."</p><p>"From an old report in the paper that I accidentally spotted while reading about the Olde way." The old goblin raised a brow, that was vague. "I believed it was a long lost book written about the goblin's culture and their ways of protecting their fortresses."<br/>"Very well, the magick that you were mentioning could change some magick involved vows into life debt." The goblin halted, now the goblins understand her and grimace at her. "Very wise, heiress. You wish to have your enemies horrible ends."<br/>"Same could go with Gringotts and goblins, no one, I dare say, crossed with you." She tilted her chin, her eyes held a malice glint. "It's what will happen eventually, they have their wrongdoing and it is natural they have to pay for it."<br/>"The Weasley house has stolen from the Potter house and from the goblins as well, it was a miracle that there wasn't a Goblins rebellion right now, due to the fact that high-standing wizards like Dumbledore and a house have tricked us."<br/>The old Goblin took a deep breath to regain his usual demeanour.<br/>"Dumbledore has heavily abused the title as violated the sacred vows. A suitable punishment will be delivered to him in a short time."<br/>"We did indeed, but then heiress Potter-Black, we do owe you but we still refer our method to make our enemies suffer the consequences." <br/>"I have another request, sir. All the heirlooms and gold that they have stolen, can you retrieve them?"<br/>"Now that is tricky, heiress." The old goblin rubbed his chin. "Unless you stated your ownership over the gold then we can do nothing but stop them from taking any more gold."<br/>"But they are rightfully mine? Why can't I take them back?" She scowled. <br/>"They have not, Heiress. You only have your ownership over the trust fund your parent left you." The goblin explained, he was being very patient. "They were very wise when they left it alone, you still have to wait until you reach the age or you can marry to a higher house and ask your spouse to retrieve them."</p><p>"There will be no way in the seven hells, I will give up on my independence." Her nostrils flared, Henrie felt her eyes stung.</p><p>"Then we can do nothing about the gold they have stolen."</p><p>"What about the heirlooms?" Sirius suddenly spoke up. "The heirlooms were strictly forbidden to give to outsiders unless there was a marriage formed between the houses."</p><p>"Ah-yes, now Lord Black has mentioned. The heirlooms, in fact, can be retrieved."</p><p>Henrie let out a sigh, at least she can still hold on to the heirlooms.</p><p>"Gringotts will perform the reclaiming upon your requests." The goblin let out a frightening grin, his beady eyes shone in the dark. "But at a cost, Heiress."</p><p>"How much?" Sirius demanded. </p><p>"We shall send you the list when we have the exact number of the stolen heirlooms."</p><p>"Whatever the cost, I hope that I have the ability to cover them with the gold I have left in the trust vault."</p><p>"Do not fret Heiress, we won't offer an outrage price as you are from a very old line of clients."</p><p>"Now, do you have any more requests?"</p><p>"The discussion is long but there were many undone deeds, sir." She began to talk. "I think we should end with the result of a ritual."</p><p>The goblin hummed. Sirius sat motionlessly, his eyes looked at her questionably.</p><p>"I want to conduct a blood ritual."</p><p>"Why do you need and blood ritual?" He was puzzled. It would be very strange for a normal witch to demand it out of the daylight.</p><p>"In case I need it some days Padfoot. We could never know what Dumbledore has done to me, to us."</p><p>"Well, you made a fine point." he shrugged, not fully trust her words. </p><p>"Very well, heiress Potter-Black." the other goblin cut in. </p><p>"Bring us the knife and the Parchment," The goblin fell into silence again. He observed the witch, feeling greatly worn out because of this long discussion.</p><p>Not long after that, the door reopened. This time, the goblin carried a tray with ease. A small knife laid on the ghastly white fabric.   </p><p>Sirius, who was well versed with rituals, instructed her to cut her wand arm at the index finger. Three drops of blood falling down. As soon as the ruby liquid fell down the parchment, words bloomed and filled the blank page. Her eyes widen in amazed, hungrily taken in the information. </p><p align="center"> <em><strong> Name: Henrietta Lilith Potter </strong></em></p><p align="center">

</p><p>"What did 'bond' means? Also, why do I bond to this Tom Riddle?"</p><p>She asked, her lips turned down. She hoped that person won't be much of a hassle. </p><p>Sirius chuckled at her expression, others would jump up with joys but no, Henrie wasn't really that deeply into other branches of Magick. To sum it up, she refused to learn other kinds of magic unless it helped her in some ways. He was still not really recovered from the disbelieved. What would Lily and Prongs do? Would Prongs hunt the boy down so he wouldn't take their little girl away? Sirius covered half of his face to hide his amusement. His pup got herself a bond! He did not know if he should be happy or what.</p><p>He sobered himself up and prepared to launch into an explanation but then stopped, would Henrie want to hear it now, in front of someone as tricky like a goblin. Certainly not, he shook his head.</p><p>Henrie cleared her throat.</p><p>"I hope that Gringotts would keep these recent discoveries confidential," It was an achievement to hide her confused state. Henrie would very much stay away from this one, maybe Padfoot would explain to her later.</p><p>"Our goblins take pride in keeping our clients' utmost secrets." The Goblin said with pride in his words. </p><p>"As we have the result of the blood flown in your veins, I wondered if you want to claim them?"</p><p>"I don't think this would be an appropriate time to claim now." She chose her words very carefully as if she wouldn't want to offend the old goblin. "I am not really rush for anything."</p><p>"Do you want this to store in the vault?"</p><p>"Thank for the offer but as her guardian, I think it should be store in the Blacks vault for safety precaution." Henrie nodded along with his words.<br/>They quickly bid the goblins farewells and leave. It was until they reached halfway to the Diagonally, Sirius broke the silence as always<br/>"I still never understand why you were sorted into Slytherin." He grinned widely.<br/>"Now you have."<br/>"My banshee of a mother would love this news. She always bitching about my house and my life choices. that woman can lay in her grave in peace as she, now, has a Slytherin in as the heir."<br/>"Her scream never stop." Henrie groaned. "It getting annoyed, last time I try to have a decent conversation with her, she insulted me. That old hag."<br/>"Oh, this would be a slap to her face!" He said gleefully<br/>"Do you really salty about your mother that you are happy about Slytherin?" She laughed, "Keep talking and you would become a Slytherin fangirl!" <br/>"The blasphemy! I would never become such a thing!"<br/>"Oh really, what were you just did?" She tilted her head in a teasing manner. <br/>"Don't you dare, pup!" He put an arm over her shoulder to keep her from escaping. Sirius smiled devilishly and messed up her hair as if it weren't a birdness before. <br/>"Oh, Henrie! I was looking for you." A shrill voice called. Both of them stopped. She made a face.<br/>"Not them!" She complained with annoyance dripped from her voice. <br/>Granger and Weasley pushed their way to Henrie. Their eyes shone with malice. <br/>"Remember to be back before dawn, pup!" Sirius whispered to her.<br/>"Where were you, mate. We lost the entire afternoon looking for you." Weasley said just second before Granger threw herself around Henrie with a deathly hug. Quite literally. Henrie felt as if Granger wanted to chock her to death with her bare hands.<br/>She quickly wormed out from Granger's arms with great difficulty. Her fingernails dug into her cloak. <br/>"Now, now don't hurt her like that Hermione." Said Mrs Weasley, glancing at Sirius. "Oooh, Henrie you look so skinny!"<br/>She tsked at her, looking up and down at Henrie. She nearly gagged at them. <br/>"Why don't you come to stay at the Burrow someday, hm?" The woman offered. What do they want? Henrie could feel her heart jumped in her chest. <br/>"Well, um, I was really busy with the homework the professors gave us."<br/>"Hermione could help that, doesn't she. She has been at there a few days."<br/>"Molly, maybe Henrie is very busy, why don't we let the children to themselves. They haven't met each other for some time."<br/>"Right, Arthur." She gave them the last look before walking away.<br/>They even suggest to the sweet shop right away. Sirius had gone somewhere before Henrie could know. <br/>"Nah, I'm not in the mood to eat them. Maybe somewhere else?"<br/>"How about the book shop? I still haven't been there today as we spent the entire day looking for you." She tried to guilt-tripping Henrie.<br/>"Good idea, I haven't bought anything for the school year yet."<br/>"Can you two not do that! What can a book give you, food? Let go somewhere."</p><p>Granger glared at him while her hands squeezed at Henrie's arm. She winced under her breath, feeling being pulled away like a doll carelessly. Henrie managed to find a hideout behind a dark corner that no one went. She was tired of Granger's long and boring rant.<br/>Henrie spotted Draco from there, she wormed her way through the crowd without being caught. <br/>"Dragon!" She silently said behind his back. He whirled his head so fast that it made a sound. <br/>"Merlin! Henrie." He whispered-yelled at her, face flushing with embarrassment. The boy rubbed his neck from the soreness. <br/>"Wanna go somewhere? Granger is making her life mission to bore me to death."<br/>He stiffed a sigh and gave her a second glance. Aunt Cissy and Lucius were nowhere to see. <br/>"My parents aren't here, let go before they drag me back to the manor." He led the way rather discreetly. "How is your day? Aside from seeing Granger?"<br/>"Really horrible!" She frowned "I just found out some really bad news."<br/>Draco remanded silent, eyes focus on the road. The corner of his lips turned down.<br/>"Is it about the old fool?"<br/>"Yeah, about that." The temperature just dropped, her mood turned sour. Henrie held onto his sleeve. "Oh look, Pansy's here."<br/>"What? Henrie-" His attempt at pulling her to the other direction failed. She mood shifted too quickly for him to get used to.<br/>"Don't you want to greet your friend? Hmm?"<br/>"No don't you dare!" He clenched his jaw. He was trying to stop her from flaring her arms wildly. Henrie struggled then stomped on his foot. Draco hissed. Cursing under his breath, his eyes watering from the pain.<br/>"HEY, Pansy!" She shouted, waving like a fool. Henrie seemed to have a death wish. <br/>Pansy, who heard her shout, I mean who wouldn't, walked twice as fast when she saw Draco. Her eyes sparkling with many enthusiasts. <br/>She made an attempt at holding Draco's hand but as was the norm, he quickly detached their hands. <br/>"Henrie, Do you want to come with me to Knockturnalley?"<br/>"Better than coming to the bookstore with Granger." She said, already headed to the other direction. Draco silently agreed with Henrie. <br/>"That m- one, I hate her attitude." She fixed her choice of words before managed to offend Henrie.<br/>"Which one are you going to enter?" Henrie asked<br/>"I don't know, anywhere we see first?" She shrugged carelessly. "Do you see Blaze anywhere? He said he would come."<br/>"Nope, not at all," Draco muttered, he crossed his arms.<br/>The dirty street was making Henrie skin crawled. She grimaced, walking closer to Draco and Pansy. The glances they were given were disgusting.<br/>"I remember there weren't that much filths on the street the last time I walked here with father." Draco drew out with his infamous expression. He kicked the stone away from his way, his shoes were shinier than some windows there. </p><p>"Just keeping walking Draco," Pansy shot him a look. "Oh, there is a bookstore there. Why don't we go in there."<br/>The trio was nearly at the door before they heard some voices calling behind them. It was Blaise. <br/>"I was surprised to see the Golden girl walking in this place?" He teased. "Don't you scared the headless chicken order would see you?"<br/>Henrie snorted under her breath before Pansy gave her an unapproved expression. There she went, talking Henrie's ears away with how a proper lady shouldn't snort and everything.<br/>"Pans, don't, I'm really tired of those talks," Henrie complained.<br/>"Take a break from chewing her ears off, Pans." Blaise offered his wise words to her. He held an amused manner with his lips curled up and head tilted to the side. <br/>Pansy pouted, she wasn't pleased with them. He held his hands up as if to surrender under her withering glare.<br/>"We were just kidding, now get in before The Order of flaming chicken spot their Saviour here." Draco pushed them through the tiny door. He was annoyed. "What? You were the one to suggest us to the bookstore."<br/>"They won't see us here." Henrie rolled her eyes, "They claimed that this place is filled with dark magic which would harm their innocent aura."<br/>"It's not wrong tho." Blaise flung an arm around Pansy. "And if the magic doesn't harm them, they will."<br/>He pointed to the dark figures strolling outside of the shops. They switched their gazes to the entrance. <br/>"Is that your mother's guards, Blaise?"<br/>"Yeah, she was worried that her newest husband's relatives would hurt me." <br/>"How many husbands does she has?" Draco asked, raising a brow<br/>"Honestly, I lost count after the tenth one." Blaise scratched his chin in a thinking manner.<br/>"Let go to the necromancer's section and leave the boys to themselves." Pansy pulled her away.<br/>She skipping through the bookshelves.<br/>"There's nothing I wanted here." She told her companion, eyes portrayed her uninterested. "Let see what they are doing?"<br/>Just as they predicted, the boys were making some jokes with a skull in the shop.<br/>"Draco put that down before the owner hex you!" Pansy chided. "And don't encourage him, Blaise!"<br/>"Do you always have to spoil our fun? We were just kidding." <br/>"That is a real human skull you were checking, sir." A voice chirping, "A good choice if you intend to perform some ritual!"<br/>They said cheerfully, too happy for Draco's taste. He gulped, feeling sick once he took the second glance to it.</p><p>"See, what was I telling you." Blaise sniggering.<br/>Draco silently put the skull back at its original place, looking very green. He quickly wiped his hand on Blaise's cloak.<br/>"Ewwww! Go and wipe on Pansy's." He jumped back, taking off the cloak immediately. <br/>"Don't you dare." She snarled, holding it tight. "I'll rip your head off."<br/>"Leave me out of this, I am not going to sacrifice mine!" Henrie hid behind Blaise, pushing him to Draco's direction. <br/>He quickly pushed her back, nearly stomping on the assistant's foot.<br/>"Sorry, sir. I think we won't purchase that one." Pansy smiled at him and urged them out of the shop. "We will come back another day."<br/>"Well, that's a fun trip!"<br/>"Who just gave me an unapproved look when I snorted while she deems it was very ladylike to threaten to rip some one's head off?"<br/>"Oh shut it, won't you, would you like some dead human's skull dust get on your clothes?"<br/>Henrie gave her a wry look.<br/>"My specialist is working with the dead," She pointed to herself. "Do I look like I would really care?"<br/>"Said the one who hid behind me!" <br/>"I don't want to bet how much dirty it gets when it stays at that place."<br/>"Fine, I give up, shush, go away!" Pansy pushed her away. Henrie pushed back causing both of them to nearly lose their balance.<br/>Blaise quickly split them away from each other.<br/>"Oof, I think it really late."<br/>Draco checked his watch and drew out a question mark in the air.<br/>"The sun hasn't even begun to set yet."<br/>"Sirius would kill me if I go home any later." She started to pick up her pace and waved to them.<br/>"Wait, do you need us to walk you home?" Draco said, raising his voice. "If he finds out you walk alone in this place, he would kill me instead."<br/>"He won't!" She replied, turning back to face them. Henrie was walking backwards without a care in the world. <br/>Draco laughed and shook his head. They shared a small laugh together then walked away. All appeared to hurry and spread to multiple directions. <br/>Henrie spared the last glance before abruptly turning back. She banged her head quite hard at something. Her head spinning for a second before a hand appeared in her vision. It helped her not to fall face-flat to the cobbler road.<br/>"Are you feeling well, miss?" She held her head, still not aware of the situation as all she could feel was the searing pain in her faded scar. <br/>"I'm so sorry for causing you the trouble, sir!" She said as it was printed into her consciousness. She repeated blinking for a few moments. <br/>Few grey spots were dancing everywhere. She had a small picture of what the person looked like.<br/>"A young girl likes you shouldn't walk in a street like this." They said The demeanour they portrayed was of someone very old but their voice, to her belonged to someone in their mid-twenties. <br/>"Thank you for the concern, sir. I will be away now." She replied carefully. Henrie didn't dare to look at their face again, instead, she focused her vision at their tie. She anxiously bitting at her lip and frowned lightly. If they did not notice, hopefully, did not, they wouldn't see it. <br/>"Did I offend you in a way, miss?" They politely phrased the question.<br/>"No sir, I was startled for a second here."<br/>"Oh my, where was my manner? Marvolo, you?" Her eyes flickered to the coldness in his eyes. Lord Slytherin? She must hear it wrong.<br/>"Henrietta, pleased to make your acquaintance." <br/> Something was lingering in the back scene making the hair of her nape curls. The silence was unnerving.<br/>"Sorry Lord Slytherin, it was an honour to meet you but I have to leave now, farewell." <br/>"Pardon me but you seem to look lost, would you mind if I accompany you out of this alley?" He offered before she had the chance to leave.<br/>Decided that he didn't mean any ills intention, Henrie nodded. Her heart was beating uncontrollable. She nervously fidgeting with a small charm in her cloak pocket. <br/>They speedily made it to the main road, Henrie quickly left him after politely bid him goodbye. She Floo'ed back to Grimmauld Place and shook the scary Lord out of her mind. <br/>Sirius was wearing his old jumper when she came out from the living room. The portrait of his mother looked increasingly annoying in her eyes with her snarl. <br/>"Have a nice walk?" He asked sarcastically, obviously knowing how much of little rascals they were. <br/>"Well, at least I made it home without anything happened." Except for bumping into a scary Lord.</p><p> </p>
