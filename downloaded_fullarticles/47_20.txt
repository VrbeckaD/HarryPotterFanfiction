    <p>Remus Lupin was 5 years old when he would be scarred for life, both literally and metaphorically. He was walking home one day down Diagon Alley with his mother and father holding his hands and swinging him merrily. He had everything at that moment, love, family, and light.</p><p>That was before he heard the shrieks.</p><p>A disheveled man, well, more like a monster, was attacking everything within view. Confused, angry and scared shoppers were all fleeing, trying to run away from the threat to their perfect little society.</p><p>The monster suddenly transformed into a large, scarred wolf with large golden eyes.</p><p>Remus, a naturally curious child, tried walking up to him, unaware that his parents were calling his name, unable to reach their unfortunate son because of the mobs of wizards and witches storming their way.</p><p>The monster was prowling about the square, lone except for him and an overly curious child.</p><p>Remus tilted his adorable orange curls and stared at the wolf-monster with unafraid eyes. Two gazes locked on to each other, the innocent blue of a child and the murderous amber of the monster. They studied each other for a calm moment before Remus made the mistake of walking closer to the monster.</p><p>The monster lunged and bit his neck. That day, the blue eyes of the child were no more. They were now an unfailingly bright gold, reminiscent of his once-pure soul.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>Remus was a bright young man, albeit a bit mischievous. He was always a bit interested in pranks because it always made him feel better about the calamities <em> he </em>suffered. It was only fair that other people suffered a bit too, right? He had been through so much pain, so its only fair others wen through some too. But regardless of his little cruel streak, he was always unfailingly polite, always the helpful little boy, just to manipulate the dumb adults into liking him. It was fun, and he always got cookies or chocolates or sweet little head pats.</p><p>But he always got something less welcome. Pity. He wasn’t so weak as to be pitied by the dim-witted people around him. He was always surrounded by people who looked at him mournfully with side glances and weak words.</p><p>He hated it. He hated the pitying glances, the whispered words, the superior gazes, murmuring at the loss of such wasted potential.</p><p>And so he tried to kill it. Of course, being a mere child, however bright, didn’t help him in any way. Whatsoever. Out of all the medical books in the National British Wizarding Library, not a single one explained how to murder a wolf. So of course, he found the next best thing, murdering a dog. Which was with chocolate.</p><p>The next day, his mother found him in his room gorging himself on chocolate and trying to die.</p><p>Hope Lupin, being the smart woman she is, approached her son with a mother's grace and a strong hug. She comforted her son, telling him, no matter what, <em>no matter the obstacles, hate or fucking stupid idiots, </em>he should never hate himself.</p><p>That was the one thing piece of advice that kept him going. Until he met Sirius Fucking Black.</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="left">16-year-old Remus Lupin boarded the Hogwarts Express, still not believing he was here. It was surreal. His confidence wavered. Maybe he wasn't meant for Hogwarts. What if the people bullied him? Or what if people wouldn't want to be his friend? Or what if he just becomes an unnoticeable wallflower, social life nonexistent? He glanced back one more time at his parents with a doubting expression, but they merely gave him a proud encouraging smile.</p><p align="left"><em>Him. They were proud of him.</em> </p><p align="left">Suddenly, he wasn't so afraid anymore. He turned around, walking with large steps, determined on finding a compartment with possible friends. </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">And that was when a certain long-haired disaster barrelled into him with the force of a million tsunamis.</p><p align="left">He. Did. Not. Shriek.</p><p align="left">The boy was laughing, the dumb git, and straddling poor Remus's waist.</p><p align="left">Behind him, an Indian boy was laughing his glasses off, literally, and eventually fell to the floor.</p><p align="left">Remus roughly pushed the pillock off of him, more than a little bit annoyed and wanting to smack the idiots' faces. Sirius stared at him in equal shock, interest, anger, and confusion. Remus stood up, wiping his pants from any imaginary dust and glancing at the now serious pair of idiots crossly.</p><p align="left">"If you'll excuse me, I'm off to meet people who won't just casually attack a poor unsuspecting first year like me." Remus turned around and started to march forward, determined not to lose his dignity in front of a couple of idiots on the first day when a pale and delicate and surprisingly strong hand grabbed onto his arm quite firmly. </p><p align="left">"You can't just do that," scoffed the long-haired child, "You can't just walk off without expecting me to apologize. I have manners, unlike some people I won't care to mention." he said breezily.</p><p align="left">Remus bristled and the tingling of cold wrath shot down his spine. He analyzed the imbecile, determining just who he was because this arrogant child couldn't possibly be a muggle-born, disregarding the Imbecile™'s friend.</p><p align="left">The Imbecile™ had dark, smooth hair so that immediately crossed out Weasley, Longbottom, Malfoy, Lovegood, or Lestrange. Expensive clothing, so either Potter or Black. But the Blacks were a Dark fam, heavily focused on blood purity and the like. They were Slytherins, blessed with intellect, good lucks, and a whole lot of cunning. They were ruthless sharks with grace and elegance in their every breath.</p><p align="left">There was no way this idiot was a Black.</p><p align="left">"Let me go, Potter, before I smack your pasty ass with nothing but a–"</p><p align="left">His voice was suddenly cut off, the Imbecile grabbing his jaw and bringing it closer to his face.</p><p align="left">"Tell me," he seethed, "Do I<em> look</em> like a Potter to you?"</p><p align="left">"Sirius," the Indian boy warned, "Don't."</p><p align="left">Sirius, who must've been the idiot grabbing on to his arm, merely smirked. "He deserves it, doesn't he, Pr-?"</p><p align="left">Remus shook off his arm and stared at the fucker in disbelief. A thought crossed his mind but was quickly erased. The werewolf stood up, feeling the curious stares aimed at his back as he ran enough.</p><p align="left">
  <em>Why was he so skinny?</em>

</p><p align="left">Remus got out of a small boat, filled with tiny first years, who were trying to not look too curious. A few of the braver ones were outright staring at him, and one of them even asked him why he was with the first years.</p><p align="left">Remus broke into a bright smile, binding the first years with its sheer brilliance. "Why, I'm a new student. Just like you!"</p><p align="left">"Really?" the little firstie asked, "Then why are you so tall? You look old."</p><p align="left">Remus gave a wry smile at that, he had always grown a couple of gray hairs near the full moon, caused by stress or something or the other. Now at least half his hair was gray and he had done his best to hide them, even dying it, but nothing stuck.</p><p align="left">"I am old, young one," he said with a croaky voice, "Much, much older than you. Why, I must've lived for centuries!"</p><p align="left">The little one gaped and quickly told the rest of his friends, and the news spread like wildfire. Remus smiled. This was going to start the infamous rumor mill and cause so much trouble... or maybe not?</p><p align="left">"Listen up, firsties and transfer!" An older woman said, her voice aided with the help of a sonorous charm. She had sharp lines everywhere and must've once been beautiful. "I am your future transfiguration professor and the head of Gryffindor. We will be going into the Great Hall and as I call your name, you will walk up to the stool, and your House will be decided. Understand? Good,"</p><p align="left">The stern woman marched inside the castle, ignoring the jolly ghosts and the first years' shrieks of surprise. Remus followed close behind, not wanting to get lost. She stopped behind a pair of large doors, abruptly turning around and causing Remus to jolt backward.</p><p align="left">"Now, we must not fool around. Be on your best behavior," she said, eyeing a group of firsties who were arguing and kicking each other.</p><p align="left">"Those idiots will be in Gryffindor for sure," Minerva muttered, before turning around and throwing open the grand doors.</p><p align="center">
