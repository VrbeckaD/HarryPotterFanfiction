    <p>All was well.<br/>It was now past the 20th anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts and Harry had returned from escorting his fourth child, Lily Luna, to the Hogwarts Express where she would begin her new life training as a witch. Harry was a typical worried parent, especially looking back on what he and the people around him had done at the young ages of eleven and twelve; his best friends sacrificed themselves in a possibly deadly game of chess and drunk a potion which could either result in instant death, or the likelihood of a much more painful killing for the chance to stop Voldemort from immortality. He pushed back the thoughts of Ginny possessed by Voldemort and barely alive, Lily Luna was practically the mirror image of her. He tried not to picture his innocent daughter who shared his untamable messy hair alone in the forest with a mysterious figure drinking the blood of a unicorn. She was perfectly safe at Hogwarts, he had made sure of that, no child would ever end the year grieving for a fellow student, none of them would have to fight a battle that even adults would be easily killed in, no one would need to worry that their family would be gone when they returned. Harry faced the pain so that they could be free. It was still very much painful twenty years on. No physical pain, that had subsided shortly after the battle, although he did bear the scars, the most prominent being his trademark lightning bolt which used to burn, and “i must not tell lies” inked into his skin with his own blood by the witch who had died in Azkaban. Many had been in favor of sending her without a trial, however Harry himself had objected, banning that practice knowing that a trial would prove the guilt of the magical people who deserved it while protecting those who suffered the Imperius curse or had been framed. In other words, Harry mused, they were pruning wherever they found practices that ought to be prohibited.</p>
