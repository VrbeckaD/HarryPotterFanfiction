    <p>"1970. The Dark Lord had first made himself known. He was still nothing more than a scary wizard with a strange name and a wicked desire to conquer the wizarding world whipping out anyone who he thought wasn't worthy of having magic running through their veins. Mudbloods, Muggle-borns. <br/>He hadn't at that time, the amount of power he has now. Really, it was more like a shadow lurking around the corners and getting people to follow him, accept his truth as their own and make them spread the supremacist idea all over the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe eventually.  It was somehow easy, you see. A lot of pureblood families thought that we... taint the wizarding world, you see.<br/>Now... please, don't worry too much. I'm safe where I am now and you are safe as well. No one knows about you guys. Just... be careful and send me letters often. I miss you already. See you at Christmas.<br/>Lovingly, Lily.<br/>September 1976</p><p>As she sent the owl home from the owlery, Lily Evans sighed. She felt a weight inside her heart as if she was just trying to hide the obvious from her parents, which wasn't entirely a lie. The young prefect knew she had to send news home. Her parents and sister knew something was wrong, just couldn't really place it. 'Not the Petunia cares, anyway', she thought bitterly. Her relationship with her sister just got worst as the years went by and she couldn't see a way of fixing it. The fact that Lily had gone to Hogwarts was just too much for the envious girl to take. Not that they were really close for starters, but since Lily hard started hanging with Severus, things had just gone even worst. </p><p>Whilst the boy didn't like to be around Petunia because she wasn't a witch, she hated him for the exact opposite. She despised the fact that she wasn't "normal" and that she was friends with some weird, scrawny boy. Beyond the fact that she hated Spinner's End and her family's willingness to help those who couldn't afford what she did. The girl thought they weren't good enough for the minimum amount of luxury and she couldn't make her mind around anything that wasn't plain and boring, something that couldn't be explained by logic. So she pushed Lily away. Despite all of the younger girl's efforts, Petunia didn't accept that her little sister wasn't normal. Wasn't like her.</p><p>After Lily came back from her first year, Petunia barely talked to her. On her second year, the screaming started. Petunia didn't want to see her. On the third year, Petunia slapped her when she tried telling how was her year. Their parents had never felt so angry with their elder child and it just made her fury grows. Lily never tried again after that and felt deeply her sister's rage for her. </p><p>After the fifth year, when Lily told her parents what Severus had done... what he had become, she couldn't help but sneak into Lily's room and snicker about the whole thing. When the redhead thought she couldn't feel more betrayed, there came Petunia and ruined everything. She thought it was somehow fair in a way. It was the only thing her sister could do to let go of all the frustration she felt about not being a witch. Still, it was like her heart was being squished and it hurt. She went over to Marlene's for the end of the summer. </p><p>Marlene was something she couldn't describe, really. Her best friend was one of a kind, some sort of lone warrior, a wonder woman in the wizarding world. Her parents raised her with all kinds of luxury and she wasn't one to hide how spoiled she was and yet, the girl was extremely humble when it came to her abilities. She was such a talented witch with such drive and conscience of what was right or wrong. Lily's admiration for her was endless, she usually thought about how much she wished she was more straight forward and confident, just like Lene was. </p><p>She felt kind of out of place when she was at Lene's house. Whilst she was extremely welcome there and the girl's parents loved her, the lack of muggleness made her feel somehow uncomfortable, maybe because it wasn't Hogwarts, it was just a home. A wizard home. There was no television, no fridge. Their lamps were magically lightened up, there were protection wards all over the yard and she felt suffocated in a way. It was a good summer anyway. Being away from Spinner's End, Severus, Petunia... it gave her time to think.</p><p>Ever since Potter had pulled that prank on him... It was not as if she was thankful to him in any way. No. Not Potter. Well, maybe a little bit. It was worth at least to open her eyes to what Snape really felt about her, about her blood. But she still couldn't make herself believe that James Potter wasn't that bad (despite Remus and Marlene's arguing in his favour because of course, her best friend would be friends with that ingenious cunt). </p><p>And she obviously knew how handsome he was, she thought bad of him but wasn't blind and everyone else also knew. And he knew people knew. And the wretch used that to favour himself, which made things all worst somehow. Maybe because she felt like he used people just to have some pleasure and discarded them easily, being the playboy he was raised to be. A spoiled brat with his heart in the right place, that she could never deny. Lily had never seen Potter so mad as he was when Snape spatted the insult to her face. If one thing was to be said about him on a more positive note, was that he was loyal and he despised all kinds of prejudice. The fact that Snape, Lily's friend had called her a mudblood was just too much for him to accept. </p><p>She closed her eyes for a bit, leaning against the parapet. Despite being summer there was a cool breeze coming from south making her shiver. It was like nature itself was trying to warn them all about how things were about to get worse. It wasn't until she heard someone clearing their throat loudly that she turned to the door. There was Sirius Black, in all his splendour looking rather puzzled. </p><p>"Are you okay, Lily?" He asked taking a tentative step closer to her as if she was a scared animal. "I called you but you didn't answer." 'Oh" she thought, 'how distracted was I...'</p><p>"Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for your concern, Sirius. How was your holiday?" It was odd. She never thought that one day she would be in such a place in her relationship with Sirius Black that they could make small talk like that.</p><p>"Great, actually. I kind of moved permanently to Prongs' house so I'm quite alright now." She arched an eyebrow. She knew they were close, obviously. Best friends, but she never thought that Potter would actually open his house for him to live there. Maybe she really thought too little of him due to his childishness... </p><p>"That's amazing news, Sirius. And your brother..." She let the sentence die on the tip of her tongue as Sirius demeanour darkened at the mention of his little brother. Lily barely knew him, but from what Remus always told her he was a sweet boy who was too afraid of defying his parents, so he pretended to be what they wanted when in reality he had not a single thought regarding blood supremacy, quite the contrary. But she had never spoken to him, in reality, she had never even seen Remus talking to him, although she should know better than assume Regulus would be stupid to show himself with Remus, out of all people. The prejudice against half-breeds was as much as with Muggle-borns, if not more and he wouldn't risk it, nor would Remus, the caring soul he was, let him.</p><p>"Still living in that shit hole. I honestly don't know what to do with Regulus it's... Tiring." Sirius sighed loudly.</p><p>"You don't have to take care of him, he isn't a child anymore, Sirius" she whispered taking a step closer to sim. "I know you worry, but don't you trust him?"</p><p>"I trust my brother, I don't trust my family. You don't know them, Lily. You have no idea how dirty, how filthy are their thoughts and I fear that if they ever find out about him..." his voice was so soft she was afraid she'd miss a few parts. "I've been through some nasty things back in the day and I don't want him going through it as well." An owl hooted loudly giving a sort of end to the conversation. "Who were you sending a letter to?" he asked, his voice back to the usual brightness, although this time Lily could see the pain behind it. Still, she obliged and smiled.</p><p>"My parents. Just keeping them up to date, you know."</p><p>"I see. Well, you should head down. Lene and Dorcas are looking for you." He had a glint in his eyes that Lily couldn't really place, so she shrugged the uncomfortable sensation and bade her goodbye to Sirius, but before she exited the owlery, she turned to him and said with a small smile on her lips:</p><p>"Things will get to their places soon, I have a good feeling about this year." And before even waiting, she fleed. </p><p>...A...</p><p>Regulus knew something was out of place when his arm was brutally pulled and he was forced into an empty classroom in which the door was locked and silenced. He rapidly drew his wand, but as soon as it came, the hand wasn't touching anymore and a wolfish laugh came to his ears and he suddenly relaxed.</p><p>"What the fuck, Remus? Are you trying to be hexed?" </p><p>"You couldn't, you're too slow, Reggy." Came Remus Lupin's sarcastic remark and the young Black couldn't help his smirk. </p><p>"Expelliarmus!" He exclaimed quickly pointing at Remus' hand where rested his own wand that flew away as if it was nothing. "Too slow, you were saying?" The older laughed as Regulus put away his wand and he got his back from the floor. </p><p>"I could still bite you, don't forget it," he said arching an eyebrow making faces, mimicking bites. Remus giggled and took a step back while Remus took several steps forward, pulled him by the hand and finally bit him on the shoulder making him squirm and chuckle.</p><p>"Stop it, mr. Wolf! I won't defy you again, you are oh so much stronger!" It was Remus time to chuckle at the antics of the younger. He then hugged him tightly. To him, each person had a very distinct smell. Regulus smelled of clothes freshly cleaned, fresh basil and new books, it was like home to him being so close to one of his best friends again. He felt the smaller melt against him, truly relaxed for the first time in a long while. </p><p>"How was your holiday, Reggy?"</p><p>"Do you really have to ask me that? It was real trash, Rem. Seriously, I won't pull a Sirius because..."</p><p>"It would disgrace your family. And you would be killed. Both of you."</p><p>"They can deal with one black sheep, two... it's not an exception, right? They burned Andy from the family tree already... It was awful. Bella was there with her maniac expression and Cissa... poor thing. She had to marry that squib project, Malfoy." Remus had to bite back a grin at the description. "We have to talk. Later, we have to talk, but you need to call everyone."</p><p>"Is there a problem?" The older asked worriedly. Something about Regulus' voice, maybe the wavering made him feel uncomfortable like something was just about to happen, the static before the storm.</p><p>"I'd call it an emergency. But we'll talk later. See you, Remy." And like that, just like that, the slytherin left the classroom and Remus remained that, staring at the closed door with his heartbeat rate too high and a concerned expression.  </p><p>...A...</p><p>"Dorcas, for the last time. I did nothing wrong!" James' voice came loudly from the common room, it was more a whine than anything.</p><p>"That's where you are wrong. You were a dick for five whole years, maybe not with her, but with the guy, she considered her best friend.  And with a bunch of other people, so be mature for once! If you want to get with her, you apologize and you change!" He blinked at the girl and tilted his head it was like he had never seen her in his entire life, the malice in her voice was almost palpable.</p><p>"I don't- I want to be her friend, I don't wanna fuck her and let go. I've been saying that for months, why don't you believe me?"</p><p>"James, really? We know you. Are you really up to not hitting on her and being just her friend?"</p><p>"Yes! Lene, I swear to Merlin's beard that I can do it." The girl squinted her eyes at him as if analyzing his entire existence based on that single moment. "I'll apologise then. Is it enough for you to believe me? You already made Padfoot go get Lily, so I don't really have a choice, do I?"</p><p>"I know admitting you are wrong is hard James," Dorcas said, her voice dripping with fake sympathy. "But a man does what he gotta do, right?" He groaned and threw his head back. James was a proud man but a good one. He knew when to accept the defeat and against those witches, he knew better than to defy them. And maybe, if he stopped being so childish, Lily could actually like him. Be friends with him. Fall in love with him? No. That was a distant dream. For now, he just wished the girl wouldn't look disgusted every time he directed a smile at her. James truly liked her, it wasn't just a petty thing, not at all. He could see his entire future with that woman with a bunch of little James' and Lily's running around the yard and flying on kids brooms. Yes.</p><p>"Right. Now can you please stop making me feel like a stupid child that needs to be scolded?" </p><p>"Oh James, dear," he thought how ironic that sentence was but kept his mouth shut. "But you are exactly that."</p><p>"Shut up, Lene." The blonde had a sly smile on her face and James just sighed. There really was no use arguing with her. "Now leave me alone, will you? You can ask Lily what happened later."</p><p>"Oh, you don't want a crowd for the first time in your life? That's new!" </p><p>"Wow, very sweet of you, D. Really appreciate how you are gentle with your childhood friend. I'll let your mum knows that's how you treat me."</p><p>"And I'll let yours know what you do with people around here, you don't try to play smart with me, Potter." She had a twisted smile, her delicate hand on her waist and voice dripping with amusement, although her words were threatening. "Good luck, Jamesie. Don't forget that we love you!" And with that, she took Lene's hand in hers and pulled her girlfriend to the girl's dormitory to do Merlin knows what. 'Well', the thought. 'That was great'.</p><p>Not long later, the portrait hole opened and Lily Evan in all of her glory entered the common room. The mere sight of her made James lose his breath. He swallowed and dried his hands on his pants before getting up and calling her. "Evans? May I have a word with you?" It sounded stupid even to his ears. "I... I wanted to apologise."</p><p>"You? Is this a joke?" She asked sceptically. James thought that she would act like that he would never even get the chance to be her friend. </p><p>"No. Please, just... five minutes?" She watched him, his pleading beautiful almond eyes and gave in. If she was thinking just minutes before that he wasn't that bad, how could she deny that? Besides, he seemed so sincere and James just wasn't one to apologise or even joke about it, his pride was something that couldn't be ignored. </p><p>"Five minutes" she answered in a small voice sitting by his side on the sofa right in front of the fireplace. "What is it, Potter?"</p><p>"Well," he started hesitantly. "I know I've been a jerk with everyone pretty much all the time we've known each other and I do that because... it's amusing and just... There is no way of it sounding nice, but it's a display of power, right? The Marauders are the coolest, the intelligent ones, the most gifted group in the school. I know it's not nice taking advantage of it, but it sort of became a habit. And there's also the whole thing with Snivellus..." She cleared her throat and he frowned. "Snape. I was so mad when he called you that... I know you don't need protection, you can fend for yourself. But he was your friend, how could he do that? I know he hangs out with Mulciber and Nott and I just don't see how you could be friends with him and it made me honestly disgusted that even then, he would say that. And I was just so fucking mad, Lily." He took in a deep breath before continuing. "Still, it's no excuse for what I did to him, I know that. Him calling you that was partially my fault and I'm so sorry about it. Also, it does not excuse what we did to others out of pride. And it's... I kinda hoped it would impress you, somehow? But it didn't. It just made you look pissed and disgusted every time I tried talking to you and at some point, it started to hurt. I hate being someone you despise. I hate being the one that pissed you off. I really like you, Lily. When I asked you out last year, it wasn't as a joke. But you would never go out with me and I get it now. And I won't do it again, I swear on Merlin's beard. Even..." His voice failed at this point. He had been ranting without even looking at her. Lily's eyes were teary, the emerald green orbs staring at him attentively, her mouth compressed in a thin line. "I like you, as I said. But I want to be your friend, for real. I don't want you to be mad at me anymore. So if you please, can forgive me, I'll try to be an overall better person... And that's it... I think."</p><p>She stared at him for what felt like ages. She could see his hands twisting on his lap, but she just didn't know what to tell him. The honesty of those words was overwhelming. The part about Severus, the fact that he blamed himself for it, was touching. He might have triggered Snape, it was true. But it wasn't his fault that the boy thought that about her... about people like her. And him, admitting that the god damn pranks he pulled were wrong, was even better, her prefect self felt a tingling pride sensation, even though she knew he probably wouldn't stop them. It was part of his loud and playful personality and thinking of it now, she didn't even think it was a completely bad thing. She wanted to forgive him. It was like something was pulling towards him. And his confession was also so sweet. The fact that he was giving up trying to win her over and become her friend, was admirable. And so, she decided to listen to her feelings. Do what she felt was right. She took his shaking hands into hers and smiled softly. </p><p>"I forgive you, James. We can be friends." His head shot up and he wore the brightest smile she had ever seen, her heart skipping a beat at the beauty of it. "And you don't need to stop all of you pranks, you know? We need some fun during these dark times... just don't be mean."</p><p>"You are the best, Lily Evans. Has someone ever told you that?"</p><p>"Not really. But I feel like I'm gonna hear it a bunch from now on." And that was the first time Lily smiled genuinely to him and when he squeezed her hands, the blush that crept on her face wasn't fury. </p><p>...A...</p><p>"Did you do it?" The boy asked with a hushed voice. Even in the dungeons, they could never be really sure of someone listening to their talks.</p><p>"I did. After I left them. You?" </p><p>"First thing after I left school." </p><p>"Did they..."</p><p>"Yeah. On winter break. Do they suspect anything?"</p><p>"Nah. They're just stupid, have their heads up their arses, you out of all people should know." There was a bitter tone to his voice, irony bleeding through the words like an open wound. </p><p>"Good. You know what to do, don't you? You seem to be quite stupid."</p><p>"Says who? You lost it last year."</p><p>"It was not... I will have it back. Now get out of here. And don't do anything stupid. Or I'll kill you myself."</p>
