          <div class="userstuff"><p>Astoria feels like an outsider in front of Draco’s mother, like a little country girl plucked from obscurity and put in an unfamiliar world. </p><p>Her bloodline may not be as illustrious or as ancient as the House of Black, but the Greengrasses have their own fame, and Astoria is no rube. </p><p>But she can’t help feeling like one when she has tea with Draco’s mother to discuss the details of the upcoming wedding. When Narcissa’s cool blue eyes focus on her, Astoria fumbles and nearly spills tea on her skirt. Her stomach sinks when the woman’s eyes narrow at the near miss, and Astoria cringes in embarrassment. Normally her manners are impeccable. </p><p>Narcissa Malfoy is everything Astoria has always wanted to be: elegant, refined, sophisticated … she could list adjectives all day and never run out. </p><p>Narcissa is perfection in Astoria’s green, envious eyes. </p><p>When she <i>really</i> thinks about it, Astoria knows she prefers the mother instead of the boy she is to marry. Astoria wishes she would find Narcissa in her marital bed when the time comes, instead of the woman’s cowardly son. </p><p>Her fingers grip the china teacup more tightly as she imagines <i>long</i> blonde hair splayed over a pillow and arousal-dark <i>blue</i> eyes gazing up at her. She feels even more awkward envisioning such things when the object of her lust is sitting across from her, demurely sipping tea. </p><p>Outsider, indeed. </p><p>A proper pure-blood girl should <i>not</i> think of such things, especially in front of her future mother-in-law.</p></div>
