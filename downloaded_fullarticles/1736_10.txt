    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus Snape was a good person. Lily always believed that. Even when Tuney said he was a freak and he would get her into trouble one day, she always stuck up for him. Because Severus Snape was a good person. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Her parents had thought it was a joke. A strange, not entirely pleasant joke. After all why on earth would anyone send a letter to a child, getting her hopes up that she was magical and special, only to dash them to the ground. Even the visit from the kindly old man who told them that sometimes a Muggle child was born with extraordinary powers failed to convince them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> But she knew. She knew that she was magical, special, because Sev had told her. And Sev was never wrong. It was only after the man turned her mother’s cup of tea into a guinea pig did her parents finally agree, most reluctantly to send her away. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The kindly old man, who’s name she later learned was Adolphus Huff, helped her buy her school supplies. Her parents were slowly becoming accustomed to the fact that their child was in fact a witch and seemed to quite enjoy the trip to Diagon Alley. Sev tagged along for that too because his mother didn’t seem to want to take him to buy his school things. She knew it upset him but didn’t say anything, just took him by the hand as they walked down the streets of Diagon Alley. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> The train ride wasn’t quite as pleasant. The minute she met James Potter and Sirius Black, she knew they were trouble. She fervently hoped she wouldn’t be put into the same house as them because they were loud and rude and everything Sev wasn’t. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Do you think it’ll make a difference,” she asked. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus sighed. “I’ve told you a hundred times Lily,” he said. “You’re magic. Otherwise you wouldn’t even be here.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“But I don’t know anything,” she said. “Won’t everyone be ahead of me?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Trust me,” Severus said. “You’ll be the smartest girl in our class.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Thanks,” she said, taking his hand. She was so wrapped up in her fears she didn’t even notice the happiness that came into his eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And you’d better get put in Slytherin,” he said, trying to joke. “Otherwise I’ll have to disown you.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">“Really?” she asked, her eyes wide.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course not,” he said quickly. “You’re my best friend. I’ll never leave you.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She walked up to the sorting hat, possibly the most nervous she had ever been in her life and sat down on the stool. She sought out Severus in the crowd and he gave her a subtle thumbs-up. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She hadn’t expected to hear a voice speaking almost as if it was in her head. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“A brave one I see,” the voice said. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Not really,” she thought back. “I’m quite scared of spiders.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The voice sounded almost amused. “Ah but bravery isn’t solely restricted to the physical,” it said. “Not to mention the fact that I can see quite a bit of righteous indignation in your head.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t even know what that means,” Lily thought back. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No matter,” the Sorting Hat said. “GRYFFINDOR.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She hopped off the stool, gave Sev an almost apologetic look. She went to the table where Sirius Black moved up a little to give her room. But recognising him from the train she glared at him and turned her back. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Lily never had a problem making friends. But she always went back to Sev. Marlene, Mary, Ruthie, none of them could hold a torch to Severus Snape. Maybe it was because he gave her her first insight into this wonderful magical world. Maybe it was because she always felt at home with him. That first year in Hogwarts was definitely her best. Even though James Potter, who was now one of the most popular boys in her class, teased her mercilessly, she was so utterly sure of Sev’s friendship it didn’t matter. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> It didn’t help that James seemed to have a group of people utterly willing to do his bidding. They called themselves the Marauders. They consisted of Potter himself, Black, who was undoubtedly Potter’s right hand man, the shy and unassuming Remus Lupin and rather incongruously, chubby little Peter Pettigrew who worshipped the ground James and Sirius walked on. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> They seemed to have formed an antipathy to Severus, who they rather cruelly nicknamed Snivellus. Much to Lily’s pleasure though, Severus was more than able to handle them, often playing pranks on them that were rather crueler than she would have ordinarily approved of. But it was the utterly ridiculous Marauders so Lily supposed it didn’t matter. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Her friends used to make fun of her and Severus, calling him her boyfriend and making kissy faces when he was around, but she didn’t care. In the back of her head she was almost certain that she was going to grow up and marry Severus Snape. Because never before, in her very short life had she felt so connected to a person. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sev,” she said, one day as they were sitting near the Lake hoping for a glimpse of the famed Giant Squid. “You know what? I reckon Potter and Black just bother you because they’re jealous.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Jealous,” Severus practically snorted. “Of me?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why wouldn’t they be?” she asked. “I mean you’re way better than them at Potions. You even beat James on the last Transfiguration test. And you know how he hates to be beaten at anything.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well you beat him at everything and he doesn’t mind,” Sev said a little snappily. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well it was just a thought,” Lily said, a little hurt. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know,” he said. </span>
</p>

  <span class="s1">
    <em>Early Fifth Year</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Their friendship became steadily rockier after than first year. Where Severus had previously been a source of comfort to her he suddenly became a source of tension.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mulciber and Avery are evil, Sev,” she said, in their fifth year. “Why you insist on hanging out with them is beyond me.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“They’re like me,” Severus said with a shrug. “They understand me better than anyone else. They know what its like to want to feel powerful. To want to make sure you can stand up for yourself.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So you decided to mix yourself up in dark magic just because James Potter and his toerag friends bully you?” she asked, the scorn evident in her voice. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He shrank at her words. “Its not just that,” he said.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But she cut him off. “And all that nonsense about blood purification. I heard what they’ve been up to. Mary told me everything. She was in the Hospital Wing for a week. For a week Sev. I’m surprised Avery didn’t get expelled.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I had nothing to do with that,” he mumbled. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I know that,” she said, impatiently. “Do you think I’d be talking to you if you had? But you have to know that they’re evil.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“They’re not evil,” he said defending them, much to her dismay. “They’re just misunderstood.” </span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>After the OWLs</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I can’t pretend anymore,” she said, desperately trying not to let the hurt she felt show in her voice. “You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She walked away from him, her heart heavy. It felt a little like a part of her childhood had been doused in gasoline and set afire. She sat in her dormitory, going over the day’s events in her mind again and again. To her horror she realised she was crying. Tears dripped down the side of her face and she now knew that she could never have Severus back. He had done what he promised he would never do. He left her, or drove her away rather; by becoming someone she could never allow herself to love. Even though she knew that she would always love him. Maybe not this Severus, but the Severus who told her she wasn’t a freak, just special. </span>
