    <p>He liked to think that he had sensed it coming. It was rather damaging for his pride to know that after nine years of fighting against Voldemort and the Death Eaters, it was a single attacker that'd caught him off guard that had finally managed to kill him. </p><p>He'd even had warning beforehand. A passerby who had seen the cloaked figure raise his wand to fire the spell had shouted out. He'd whirled around immediately to see what was happening. </p><p>Not seeing anything dangerous in his immediate line of vision, he'd frowned, before realizing his mistake a split second too late as he saw green light in his peripheral vision. </p><p>He had turned in the direction of the shout, not the location of the threat.</p><p>As he turned, flicking his wand into his hand in a last ditch effort to save himself, the spell hit.</p><p>It connected in the center of his forehead, mere centimeters from his infamous scar. His eyes widened a fraction in shock.</p><p>Haunting green light filled his vision, and everything went dark.</p><p>After 20 years of life– eleven of which spent in ignorance of the Wizarding World; the remaining nine spent fighting Voldemort and rebuilding the ruins of the Wizarding world– Harry Potter finally died.</p><p>...</p><p>Only to wake up only moments later, eyes shooting open to find himself surrounded by a familiar white blankness.</p><p>A pit of dread settled in his stomach as he realized what this meant. </p><p>He wasn't dead. He still wasn't goddamned dead.</p><p>He chuckled bitterly as he considered his situation. Three Avada Kedavras. Three unstoppable Killing Curses. Yet here he was. Still alive.</p><p>What wizardkind wouldn't do to figure out how he had managed it, he thought bitterly. What most might consider a blessing had turned into more of a curse. He would have to wait longer to see Sirius, to see Remus, Fred, and his parents.</p><p>Eyes weary and shoulders braced, he looked up into the face of the being that called itself God, preparing for the worst.</p>
