  <strong>Chapter 1: Forget</strong>
</p><p>If you were to see the dark haired boy on the darkened British street tonight, you the first thing you would see was his scar. If you came last night, or the night before that, and that, and that, you would not.</p><p>As of tonight however, the boy was asleep, and even though he was clearly worn to the greatest extent in body, (and if you knew him in mind as well), he did not sleep peacefully. In fact, the boy was not sleeping at all. Certainly, his body was, but his mind was not. He tossed and turned, letting out a small moan when his weight pushed on the numerous bruises. If he shifted, you could see blood spotting the sheets.</p><p>In a cage, there was a snowy owl. The cage was normally lock for the safety of the owl from the boy's family, but the boy was too tired to remember. In this case, though, this worked for the better. The owl decided his master's torture had gone far enough.</p><p align="center">|HP|</p><p>
  <em>Vernon has him pushed against the wall, so close to him he could smell the sweat and stink left over from his recent 'lesson'.</em>
</p><p>"<em>I'll give you one night to rest boy. Then will continue."</em></p><p>That had last night. As Harry stumbled out of bed from another sleepless night, he glanced in the small mirror.</p><p>He seemed to be covered in light bruising everywhere. It looked worse now that they were a day old. The last had been worse than the others had.</p><p>
  <em>Kill him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>What?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Kill him! Rip out his throat with your teeth, crack his skull open! Let his blood drip through your fingers, and peace will come.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mum would not like it…</em>
</p><p>
  <em>How do you know? You never saw her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She is dead. Like them all. Dad, Sirius- Oh god, Sirius!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes, wouldn't this distract you from the pain?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I just want to forget.</em>
</p><p>The voice said nothing to that.</p><p align="center">|HP|</p><p>Petunia Dursley woke to a gentle nib at her ear. She gasped at the owl in front of her. But the bird just fluttered off the bed and gave her questioning look as if biding her to follow. She shook her head, she must be crazy, and followed the owl to her nephew's room.</p><p>She gasped for the second time that night. Her nephew's floor was splattered with blood and a clear liquid which she assumed came from the spilled glass from the knocked over nightstand. But her nephew-no her <em>Harry</em>… her horrified gaze hardened. She crept from the room, petting the owl gently with a whispered <em>Thank You.</em> She walked to Dudley's room and turned on the light.</p><p>"Dudders?" she whispered.</p><p>He blinked opened his eyes slowly. "Yeah Mom?"</p><p>"There's something you need to know about your father…"</p>
