    <p align="justify">Harry waited until they were alone with Hermione. Their good friend and her husband, Ron, had went to kitchen to get some food.</p><p align="justify">Hermione stopped smiling immediately after Ron had gotten outside the room. Of course Harry had noticed it. He had been watching the couple closely for quite a long time. They didn’t seem to be very happy, or at least Hermione didn’t. To everyone else they might have seemed to be a very happy couple, but they couldn’t fool their best friend.</p><p align="justify">“Hermione...” Harry whispered knowing that if he spoke any louder about this, Ron would come running to the room doubting something. “You two aren’t as happy as you let everyone believe.” He also knew that he had to be fast.</p><p align="justify">“Hmm? We are,” Hermione tried to contradict. She flicked her eyes from Harry to door and back.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t lie. I can see how you are with him. I can see how he holds you possessively and how you would like to have some distance.” Harry put his hand on her knee and squeezed gently. He didn’t notice how Hermione flinched. “He hits you, right? If that’s the case, maybe you should leave him.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione could only shake her head. They weren’t able to continue their rather one-sided conversation when Ron soon returned with a bowl.</p><p align="center">•••</p><p align="justify">Hermione laid on the bed naked. Her body was covered in bruises. Tears were streaming on her cheeks. Ron had raped her again whispering on her ear how she deserved all of it. How she deserved all those hits and kicks, and getting raped.</p><p align="justify">It had been going on for months already, maybe even a year. Hermione had started believing that she deserved everything Ron did to her. Subconsciously she knew the man wasn’t right.</p><p align="justify">Of course she could try to leave. She knew it. She just didn’t think she actually would be able to do it. And even if she could, life probably wouldn’t get any better. Therefore, it would be easier to just stay in a bad relationship and slowly die in a way or another than to leave and then wait for something better.</p><p align="justify">Hermione had secretly wished that the man would change. However, she knew it wouldn’t happen. She had read books and heard stories about domestic violence, both in muggle and wizarding worlds. In wizarding world it was slightly more rare than in muggle world and she hadn’t thought Ron would be that kind of wizard.</p><p align="justify">But Ron had been exactly the same as in one of the cases Hermione had read about. First it had started with just one hit in her face and a promise he wouldn’t do it ever again. Then he had started calling her names and slowly new hits came along. After every hit he promised he wouldn’t do it anymore. Then the next one came, and hit after hit, kick after kick, their life became worse and worse. At some point he had started taking her without her consent.</p><p align="justify">Hermione hated the life she was living, but she didn’t manage to get help or even try to leave. Her strength to do anything was almost completely out of her crab. Nevertheless, she still thought what Harry had said a couple of days ago. She should leave Ron. She had tried to deny it all, but Harry was right.</p><p align="center">•••</p><p align="justify">A couple of days later she laid at floor, raped and thinking of the meaning of her life. This time Ron had taken her on the floor of the bathroom when she had just came from the shower. She now felt a lot dirtier than before taking the shower. She just wanted to take a shower again but she didn’t have strength to get up.</p><p align="justify">Hermione played with a thought of doing what Harry had told her to do and leave. She just didn’t understand why Harry wanted her to leave. He was Ron’s best friend.</p><p align="justify">Where would she even go if she decided to leave Ron? She didn’t have any place to go. She didn’t have almost at all money. Ron had moved her money to his vault in Gringotts. She also didn’t have any earnings since she had quit her healer position in St. Mungos when Ron had told her to do so.</p><p align="justify">Of course she could leave the wizarding world entirely and forget everything that could somehow be associated with magic. She could return to muggle world. But there were things in the muggle world too that she wanted to forget. She knew she didn’t want to return to that world. She would stay in the wizarding world.</p><p align="justify">Hermione laughed. The joyless laugh echoed around her for a moment. Why did she even think about leaving when she clearly wasn’t going to leave?</p><p align="center">•••</p><p align="justify">Hermione sat at the kitchen table drinking her coffee. She was away with the fairies, thinking about life and staring into nothing. She was amazed because of the past week. Ron hadn’t hit her even once, and he hadn’t raped her. They had had sex, but with Hermione’s consent. She had actually been willing now when Ron hadn’t behaved like an idiot. Maybe she wouldn’t have to leave the man. Maybe things would get better now.</p><p align="justify">Ron had also spoiled her. One evening they had gone to some expensive restaurant for dinner. Hermione had been able to get herself ready without guilt. She had been able to put on a Gryffindor red evening gown. It had first hung on her and she noticed she had lost some weight. She made the dress smaller with magic and worried slightly about the weight loss.</p><p align="justify">Hermione was so deep in her thoughts that she didn’t notice Ron arriving before he had punched her to her right cheek. Her whole body moved from the strength of his hit and her cup dropped first to the table and then rolling down and shattering to the floor. Hot coffee spilled on her lap and she cried out. The pain of the hit and the coffee spilled on her lap was almost too much.</p><p align="justify">She lifted her gaze to Ron, shocked. He looked furious and enormous, and she could smell alcohol from his breath. “Ron?” she asked gingerly.</p><p align="justify">Then he yanked her down to floor and she knew she would be raped again. She closed her eyes. She didn’t want to look at her husband. She still remembered very lively the first time he had done it. She remembered it the best because she hadn’t believed Ron would actually do it.</p><p align="justify">She felt Ron yanking her trousers down and tearing her shirt apart, and she heard how he unfastened his belt. After a short moment she heard an unmistakable sound of a belt against her own skin. And the pain she felt on her belly and chest. She yelled in pain. The last time this happened she had been in pain for weeks. She would prefer a couple of punches on her face and kicks to her ribs over lashing with a belt.</p><p align="justify">She could try to escape now. Ron seemed to be too drunk to function properly, but on the other hand… Her thought was interrupted with new wave of pain. It was way too much, even if she had been hit now only twice with the belt. <em>For fuck’s sake, I do have to escape. I can’t take this anymore.</em></p><p align="justify">The adrenaline flow helped her form quickly a plan. Ron hit her for the third time and a new wave of pain crashed through her body. But despite the fact that she was in great pain, she decided to act now, before it was too late.</p><p align="justify">She kicked him in his groin as hard as she could and the man fell down holding his crotch and groaning in pain. Hermione quickly got up and wordlessly summoned her wand.</p><p align="justify">“You fucking bitch! You will pay for that!” the man yelled, still in pain. Hermione flinched but quickly recovered and cast a quick, wordless <em>Stupefy!</em> She watched the man fall on the floor into a motionless pile of drunk, silent, abusive man. She took a couple of deep breaths and realised she was crying.</p><p align="justify">She took a moment to get herself together and then she left the kitchen. She went straight to the bedroom and started collecting the most useful things in a backpack. <em>Only the necessary.</em> Then she left the house she had once been able to call home.</p>
