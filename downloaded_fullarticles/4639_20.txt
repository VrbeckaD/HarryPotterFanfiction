    <p>"You know, Dad, that movie was pretty good after all! Can I be Zorro when I grow up?" Bruce giggled.</p>
<p>"Absolutely, son. We'll need to get you a bigger sword..."Thomas thought aloud for a moment. Hugging his wife Martha closer to him.</p>
<p>Bruce ran a short distance down the alley and back swinging an imaginary blade. But it was his words that caused Thomas to pause in shock. "Take that, you wicked tyrant! Voldemort will never stand a chance against Gryffindors Sword!"</p>
<p>"Harry? Dear...?"</p>
<p>Thomas turned to look at his wife with wide eyes, "Lily Flower?"</p>
<p>"James?" Martha whispered, tears gathering in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Harry! Harr-Bruce, come back here!" Martha called to her first born. Her beautiful brave boy.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lils...Martha. Let him play. We have forever in front of us now," James whispered into her ear as he wrapped his arms around his first love, he had been feeling guilty by replacing Lily's spirit, but this was Magic; she had never left him.</p>
<p>"James Potter- I mean Thomas Wayne, grahh--you know what I mean," She waved her gloved hand before pointing it at him accusingly, narrowing her green eyes, the same green from his memory, "When he has nightmares tonight, you can be the one to calm him down."</p>
<p>Thomas Wayne chuckled, kneeling down and grasping his sons arms before he could make another run around. "Okay, that's enough for now, Ha-Bruce. We'll start you on fencing lessons when you're older. Say... 30?" he looked up at Martha, laughing with her.</p>
<p>A gunshot rang out.</p>
<p>Thomas stuttered out a breathe, collapsing side ways. "Protect Harry, Lily Run!"Â </p>
<p>As darkness began to steal across his vision, he heard his wife's last plea for mercy. "Please, not Harry, kill me instead, not Harry!"</p>
<p>"Silly Woman..."</p>
