<p>Harry sat at his table alone, but not minding the solitude. All of his friends were off dancing and having a good time, as they should be. It had been ten years since the end of the war, and to commemorate this momentous occasion, a celebration at Hogwarts was planned for that summer. He of course received an invitation, as did most of the students that were there during Harry’s years, but being the DADA professor and The Chosen One sort of took the choice away from him on if he was attending or not. He was heavily leaning towards not, until Minerva had conveniently let it slip that an invitation had been sent to Draco as well, along with an offer for the position of Potions Master.</p>
<p>Harry went back to his quarters immediately and checked yes on his invitation.</p>
<p>Now here he sat, listening to loud music he didn’t understand, scanning crowds of people he didn’t know, for that oh so familiar head of blonde hair. He’d watched him all evening, waiting for his chance. The moment he was left alone, Harry stood and made his way over. His back was turned to Harry, and he used this to his advantage as music covered the sound of his approaching footsteps. He stood right behind him, his chin nearly resting on Draco’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Dance with me.”</p>
<p>He was so close he could nearly feel Draco’s shiver. Draco turned around, but couldn’t hide the smile held in his eyes. Not from Harry. Never from Harry.</p>
<p>“Potter.”</p>
<p>Harry bit his cheek to stop his smile. This was going exactly how he wanted it to.</p>
<p>“Dance with me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure my date would appreciate that.”</p>
<p>Draco’s patronizing voice didn’t faze Harry. After all, this was all part of the chase.</p>
<p>“How unfortunate for him.”</p>
<p>Before Draco could protest again Harry was dragging out into the middle of the dance floor. Surprisingly, Draco didn’t say anything further, just placed his hands exactly where they were supposed to be and began moving to the music. Harry let him lead.</p>
<p>“I was surprised to see you here.” Draco said after a few steps into the dance. “I don’t recall these types of events being all that appealing to you.”</p>
<p>“They’re not.” Harry said truthfully.</p>
<p>“Yet here you are.” Draco drawled.</p>
<p>“I’m not here for the party, Draco.”</p>
<p>Harry felt him tense, but other than that he gave no indication that he knew exactly what Harry was here for.</p>
<p>“I hear that you’ve completed your apprenticeship?” Harry asked casually.</p>
<p>“I did. America is very different, you should go sometime.”</p>
<p><em>I would have gone with you</em> was on the tip of his tongue, but he held it in. He would never win Draco back if he didn’t play this right tonight.</p>
<p>“Maybe I will.”</p>
<p>Harry tried to be as close to him as possible without it being obvious, but he was sure Draco knew what he was trying to do. Four years was a long time to go without him. Draco didn’t seem to mind the closeness, in fact Harry was sure that Draco was the one pulling <em>him</em> in a few times.</p>
<p>When the song ended, they stood awkwardly, Draco looking around for his date, and Harry looking at him.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll get some air.” Harry leaned in just a bit too far, making his breath ghost against Draco’s skin. “If you want to join me.”</p>
<p>He didn’t wait for a response, he knew Draco would follow.</p>
<p>Harry only stood outside for a few minutes before he heard footsteps coming towards him.</p>
<p>“Do you still smoke?” Harry asked without turning around.</p>
<p>“Every now and then.”</p>
<p>Harry pulled out a pack of cigarettes, lighting one of his own, then handed the pack to Draco.</p>
<p>“One of the bad habits I left you with, huh?” Draco said as he lit his own cigarette.</p>
<p>The words were out before Harry could stop them. “That’s not all you left me with.”</p>
<p>Draco took a long drag, then blew out a dramatic puff of smoke. “Is that why you’re here tonight, then?” He spat bitterly. “To tell me how I broke your heart? To tell me off?”</p>
<p>“Why are you with him, Draco?” Harry asked bluntly. “I’ve watched you all night, you can’t look me in the eyes and tell me that he’s the one you want.”</p>
<p>“Brent is different. He doesn’t know anything about the war, or me or you. He’s a fresh start.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want really him.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me what I want!” Draco screamed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Harry said quickly, he knew that came out wrong. “I’m sorry, Draco. Hey, look at me, please.”</p>
<p>Draco took a shaky breath, then looked at Harry.</p>
<p>“You should be with me. You belong with me. You danced with me because you couldn’t say no. You and I fit together better than you and him ever will.” Harry placed one hand on Draco’s cheek, watching as he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Did you have anything to do with it?” Draco asked when he opened his eyes. “The offer for the potions position.”</p>
<p>Harry snorted. “No. I wasn’t even aware that you’d been offered the job until I told Minerva that I wasn’t coming to this. I’m only here for you.”</p>
<p>Draco took Harry’s hand from his cheek and held it tightly in both of his. “Harry.”</p>
<p>“I will always be here for you.”</p>
<p>Draco lifted their hands to kiss Harry’s. “I have to go.”</p>
<p>He turned to leave, but Harry couldn’t leave it like that.</p>
<p>“Tell me that you love him. Tell me right now that you love him, and I’ll stop. I promise. But you have to say it.”</p>
<p>Draco seemed too stunned and scared to speak.</p>
<p>“Draco.”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>Harry held his breath.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you around.”</p>
<p>Draco ran inside, but Harry didn’t stop him. After all, this was all part of the chase.</p>
