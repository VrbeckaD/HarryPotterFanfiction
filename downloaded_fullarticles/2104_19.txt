    <p align="justify">The black robes which swamped Minerva McGonagall Dumbledore's frame did not seem dark enough. </p>
<p align="justify">As Minerva caught a glance of herself in the full length mirror, she felt as if the dark cloth which swaddled her grey skin did not seem dark enough or deep enough to convey the colour of her broken, bitter soul. The colour of mourning, a universal colour which had been used for centuries upon centuries, seemed too mundane, too heroic to truly express what grief felt like. Minerva felt as if she were wearing an armour of courage, as if the black would be enough to show how strong she was to the world but... Minerva was not strong. Minerva had never been weaker in all of her life. She wasn't sure how to her tired legs were supporting her, or how her heart remembered to continue to beat because her mind was empty. She could think of nothing and yet, it her head felt as heavy as stone. When she closed her eyes, she could see nothing but grey mist and sketchy shapes - figures roaming in the darkness, voices echoing, lost and melancholy. She was not a great warrior, clad in black as a defender against her grief; she was nothing but a shell, empty and cold, full of regret and pain. </p>
<p align="justify">She had come back to Hogwarts the evening before. Although she had been absent since she had finally packed her things up and left Albus and the castle behind, she couldn't think of anywhere else to spend the night but the rooms in which they had brought Eleanor up. When she arrived, they were as she had left them; the furniture had not been moved or even touched. It was familiar, even if it was cold and dusty, and for a moment, Minerva had readied herself to enter Eleanor's room but... she hadn't quite made it that far. No, when she finally retired for the evening to spend the night in her sleepless, empty marital bed, Minerva had shot a furtive glance at Eleanor's closed bedroom door down the hallway but she had been too fearful to walk in there. She could remember every inch of it but she knew that to enter would mean to be overwhelmed by the sights and smells of Eleanor and she would no doubt drown in it. </p>
<p align="justify">On this grey morning, as the dim morning light slipped through the narrow windows of her bedroom, Minerva could only feel dread. The anxiety sat in the pit of her stomach, sending tremors through her bones and causing bile to rise in her throat. The day had crept up on her and yet, it seemed that it had arrived all of a sudden, without warning. For a week, Minerva had only been able to think about this day and when she did, her mouth went dry and her head started to pound. Cold blood rushed to her temples, her palms began to sweat as her heart shuddered and beat so fast she thought she might die. The only way she had been able to calm herself was to remind herself that she had so many days left, so many hours, before she had to face the dreaded event. But it had come. It was here and Minerva had pulled herself from her sleepless bed to dress in heavy, thick robes for the occasion. All the while her mind was spinning - how could this be happening? Surely this wasn't real? Good God, it couldn't be! </p>
<p align="justify">But it was real. And Minerva would have to live through this day as she would have the live through the rest of her days. </p>
<p align="justify">Minerva took one final glance of herself, tucked a stray hair behind her ear and smoothed her skirts. Taking a deep breath, she reached for her outer robe, which she fastened tightly around her neck, and with a surge of determination that seemed overpowering but was not nearly as strong as usual, she marched from her bedroom. She only made it down the carpeted hall and into her sitting room before the adrenaline drained and the dread and fear took over once again. She couldn't moved. She knew that with each step she would get closer and closer to the final destination and she wasn't ready to face it. She wouldn't ever be ready to face it. For the first time that morning, Minerva thought of Poppy and wondered how she was coping with it all. Poor Poppy was in the same position as Minerva and had probably looked to this day with the same amount of dread. Had Poppy taken an age to dress because her reluctant limbs would no co-operate? Had Poppy glanced in the mirror and wished she were dead? Was Poppy struggling now to leave her cottage and face the day as she must? </p>
<p align="justify">But then, Poppy had Aberforth. Aberforth had Poppy. They had each other to lean on on this dreadful day. If one of them faltered, the other could offer them a piece of their strength. If one of them cried, they could press their face into the other's shoulder. If one of them could not move, they had the other to encourage them. Minerva had nobody. Minerva was alone and must face this alone. She would look across and see Albus, just as alone as she, and she would know that he was suffering as she was and yet, they couldn't lean on each other. They couldn't rely on each other. There was no more Albus &amp; Minerva, the couple, the lovers, the spouses. They were not the parents of the dead, they were each a parent of the dead. Minerva wondered if any of this would have been easier with Albus. If she was still his wife, and not just legally, would her grief be any less? Would she be able to cope with it better, knowing that she was loved and knowing that she could share that grief should she want too? She doubted that it would have made the pain any less but she did think that perhaps, the aftermath would have been easier. If she had Albus at her side now, she might have been able to make the dozen steps it would take her to cross the floor; she might have had the strength to open her front door and pass through it, thus emerging into the world. When she had Albus at her side, she felt as if she could do anything. </p>
<p align="justify">Minerva, however, was quite alone and quite unable to leave the sorrowful comfort of her apartments. The cold, lifeless sitting room was suddenly so inviting. Here, nobody would be able to look at her with their sympathetic gazes. Nobody would be able to shake their heads at her and mutter: "Such a waste. Such a terrible thing." Good God! What did they know? A terrible waste? They had no idea. They had no idea of what Eleanor could have achieved. They had no idea of the impact Eleanor could have had on the world. Minerva's miracle child, the child which had held her family together, was gone, taken, obliterated. How could such a precious life simply vanish? In what world was that the norm? Why should Minerva except it? </p>
<p align="justify">A wave of grief, a fresh and strong as it had been when Minerva had first been told of Eleanor's death, swept through Minerva and she gripped onto the arm of the red sofa for support. Her legs shook and her knees trembled. Tears stung her tired, sore eyes and her breath became fast and ragged. This couldn't be happening. This couldn't be real. Surely, she could not be burying her dead daughter today? It seemed only weeks ago that Eleanor had been born. How could have grown up and lived and died already? How was it that Minerva remained when she had nothing else to give to this world? With her free hand, Minerva frantically wiped away the tears from her eyes and face but they were uncontrollable and no matter how often or how deeply Minerva breathed in, they continued to flow. She rubbed her chest; she could feel her heart snapping again, feel the iciness of it. Minerva was panicking and she knew it, but she couldn't bring herself back. </p>
<p align="justify">In her panic, Minerva didn't notice the door click open. Nor did she hear the shuffle of footsteps in the hallway. She was not aware of anyone entering her apartments until Molly Weasley entered the sitting room. Her pale round face was full of concern but it quickly changed to horror when she caught sight of Minerva, barely holding herself up. Molly flew to Minerva's side and put at arm around her to support her. Carefully, with all the softness and compassion of a mother, Molly guided Minerva to the sofa and sat down with her. She caught hold of both of Minerva's hands and squeezed them before she lifted one of her own to Minerva's face and gently patted her cheek. </p>
<p align="justify">"You can do this, Aunt Minerva," Molly whispered furiously. "I do not doubt it. You are capable." </p>
<p align="justify">Minerva shook her head. "No. No, I'm not," Minerva moaned, her voice thick and hoarse. "You're wrong, Molly. I won't go - I can't go. I cannot say goodbye to her. Once I do, it's final. There's no going back." </p>
<p align="justify">"Oh," Molly cried softly. "It's already final, Auntie. You can't go back now anymore than you'll be able to once today is over." </p>
<p align="justify">Through her tears, Minerva smiled wanly. "I hear myself in your words. Softly spoken but to the point." Minerva drew her hands to her face and wiped it. "I needed that. I'll need it all day, Molly. If I just had somebody with me, somebody who could - Poppy has Aberforth, you see..." </p>
<p align="justify">"But you do have somebody. You have me. I'm not going to leave your side for a minute," Molly said earnestly. </p>
<p align="justify">"No, no. You are young, I should not be relying on you. You have your own grief to deal with and I should be there for you, Molly. I'm the adult. I'm the mother-" Minerva croaked. </p>
<p align="justify">"I am not the one burying my daughter," Molly retorted. "I cannot even begin to comprehend what you are feeling right now. God, I just can't - but, you forget that I am an adult and mother now. So you can rely on me. I will be here," Molly linked an arm through Minerva's. "Right here, all day. And all night if need be. After everything you and Poppy and Albus and Aberforth have done for me, let me do this for you." </p>
<p align="justify">Minerva's thin face screwed up as another wave of tears rolled over her. "You are the sweetest thing. Your mother she was just like you. Sweet and kind...I wish Ellen were here. I don't know why, I just do. I don't know how I'm going to get through today. I don't know how... I just never imagined that I would ever have to do anything like this, let alone do it by myself. I wish I had Ellen... I wish I had Albus. Albus would know what to do. Albus will be able to do this without crumbling to pieces. He won't be wishing to somebody else. He won't be-" </p>
<p align="justify">"I wouldn't be so sure of that, Auntie," Molly whispered. "I went to see him earlier. I went to him first because, like you, I assumed that he would be...better, in a way. But, oh my! I've never seen Albus like it. A heap on the floor, a grey faced old man, his eyes so red and blood shot I couldn't see the infamous blue. Honestly, I thought he was ill..."</p>
<p align="justify">Minerva was surprised that Albus was as bad as he was. She always regarded him as sure of himself, as capable of doing anything that he must do. She knew that he would be grieving the loss of Eleanor. She knew that he would be as hurt and heartbroken as Minerva but somehow, she imagined that he would be strong enough to get through today with as little fuss as possible. But then, as she thought about Molly's words more and more, Minerva realised that they had both been wrong and Minerva should have known that Albus would need guiding through the whole affair. He could face his own death head on, he could solve any manner of mystery or complication through careful thought and oftentimes wit, but, he became a powerless mess when it came to grief. It was a feeling that he could no process - along with shame - and Minerva should have known that. Out of the two of them, it would be Minerva who would most likely pull herself together enough to coast through the day, not Albus. Albus would need his hand held and words of encouragement whispered to him at all times, otherwise he would not be able to cope. </p>
<p align="justify">Grabbing Molly's hand and kissing it lightly, Minerva said: "You must go to Albus now. I'll pull myself together, eventually, but he will not. You must go to him and be at his side today. He'll need someone... he'll need you." </p>
<p align="justify">"But what about you?" </p>
<p align="justify">Minerva smiled grimly. "Don't worry about me. As long as Albus is alright, I'll be fine," and it didn't seem odd to her that once again she was being selfless for a man who didn't love her. She didn't even consider it; in her mind, she still owed him everything because she still loved him. She would do anything for that man and would never question it, not for as long as she lived. As she watched Molly reluctantly leave, Minerva didn't feel regret at ordering her away, in fact, she felt relief. At least she wouldn't have to worry about Albus today. </p>
<p align="justify">With Molly gone, Minerva found herself in silence again. She could hear the clock ticking and the birds singing in the branches outside her window; she could hear the hubbub of voices outside in the grounds - students or funeral attendees? Whichever it was, it was the chattering of people, people she would have to face. No matter how hard she wished to, Minerva couldn't back out of today. She had no choice but to emerge into the day and stand at the foot of her daughter's coffin. She had no choice but to accept the condolences of people who had no idea how it felt. She would have to smile tightly, politely and quietly thank everyone for their words. Words , she knew, that would be of no comfort or solace and were just wasted breath that might have been saved for Eleanor. And who would use the air to speak? Stupid, useless mouths who needn't be in the world at all; half the ministry who had never done the world any good; most of the wizarding world, at least half of whom would be traitors and no doubt bore the dark mark themselves. How on earth did people expect her to greet these people, to socialise with them? People who didn't deserve to be alive just as Eleanor did not deserve to be dead? Minerva let the familiar feeling of bitterness fill her, she let herself scorn the living, she let herself wish people dead for she no longer cared. She hardly cared about anything but this, knowing that murderers could be walking freely among her, flared her temper. </p>
<p align="justify">She was glad of it, for she could feed off her temper. Her anger created a fire in her which thawed her old bones and brought her back on her feet. She finally knew just how she would get through today - she would live off of scorn and hatred, judgment be damned. She didn't owe anyone anything. She only owed it to herself to cope with the next few, long hours before she could scurry back to her rooms. With her teeth clamped together and her fists screwed up into tiny balls, Minerva mustered the strength to match from the room and enter the stone corridor. She was glad to find it empty and silent, save for the low moans of the wind that swept along the walls; a chill wind which made Minerva shudder and pull her robes tighter around her. As she continued down the corridor, her skirts swaying and grazing the stone floor, Minerva hoped that she might see one of the culprits. What she wouldn't give to see a 'hidden' Death Eater - she would call them out and kill them on the spot. She didn't care if she was sent to Azkaban for it. </p>
<p align="justify">"Minerva?" </p>
<p align="justify">It was a soft voice which caught Minerva's attention and made her turn on her heels. A weak, faltering voice which she barely recognised. </p>
<p align="justify">Poppy stood like a leaf shuddering in the wind, her thin hands shaking and her lip quivering. Her wide, blue eyes were heavy and red and her bright hair was pulled back from her face, revealing deep lines around her mouth and the harrowing hollows of her cheeks. She swayed on her feet as if drowning from the weight of her garments and for the first time, Minerva saw her mirror image. No doubt Minerva looked just as lost and aged. No doubt her black robes swamped her and looked at if they might drag her down to the floor. Neither she nor Poppy resembled the formidable, capable, fiery women they were; they were replaced by shadow and grey skin. If they had never looked like sisters before, they did now and it was a great shock to Minerva. </p>
<p align="justify">"Pomfrey, what are you doing up here? Why aren't you with, Aberforth?" Minerva asked, taking Poppy's hand and squeezing it. </p>
<p align="justify">"I knew that you would be alone and I- I just couldn't bear the thought of you arriving to your own child's funeral on your own," Poppy replied. "We've been through it all, you and I, but never this. Never did I think we would have to go through this. But... we have too, don't we? And I won't let my grief stop me from being here, with you. We held each other up when Ellen died; why should it be any different today?" </p>
<p align="justify">It was true. Every blow that had been dealt to them, Minerva and Poppy had faced together and Minerva could not have been more grateful for her friend than she was at that moment. They needed each other to face the day; two mother's burying their murdered children. Two mother's burying their only children. Two mother's who were no longer mother's at all. </p>
<p align="justify">Minerva slipped her arm through Poppy's and they began their long walk, neither knowing who was holding up who. </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p align="justify">Closing her eyes, Minerva drew in a deep, ragged breath. On one side of her she could feel the trembling body of Poppy as she sobbed into her hands; on the other side she could feel Priscilla, digging her fingers into Minerva's arm in an attempt to comfort or steady her - Minerva didn't know which. </p>
<p align="justify">She had been fine when she entered the small chapel. She had been fine when Priscilla kissed her cheek and murmured words of comfort. She had even been fine when she watched Albus enter like a black cloud, ashen faced and bewildered, with Molly at her side. No, everything had been fine until the coffins were walked in and then - then everything had fallen apart. William came first, carried by Arthur Weasley and few other school friend and Minerva had winced as Poppy's moan had echoed through the room. Poppy near collapsed onto her husband, who was looking at the floor and whose coughing hid the fact that he was struggling not to cry. Priscilla gasped as the unholy sound escaped from her daughter's lips and she grabbed Minerva's hand and squeezed it for strength. Minerva looked to her left and saw Molly sobbing with Albus's arm around her. As William was walked down, Minerva panicked. She felt sick - Eleanor would come next. Eleanor would follow and Minerva wasn't sure how on earth she was going to stand it. </p>
<p align="justify">Eyes closed, Minerva listened as the shuffling footsteps stilled and she knew that it was now her turn to watch her own child be carried down. Snape emerged from around the corner, the coffin on his shoulder, his other hand gripping onto the wood tightly. His face was still, pale as usual, and his black eyes did not move. He walked with the others, his strides wide and determined and Eleanor's coffin came into full view, Minerva heaved. She forgot how to breath and felt the blood drain from her. Her limbs shook and her skin grey cold and all she could feel was her heart snapping and breaking and burning and dying all at once. For a moment, her world went black and she felt as if she were falling through the Earth. She bit her lip, drawing blood, to stop herself from crying out. Pricilla began to pat her arm firmly and Minerva looked from side to side, at Molly, Arthur, Aberforth, Poppy and Priscilla. She avoided looking at Albus - she couldn't look at the man who had given her Eleanor in the first place because... well, Eleanor had been so much like him. </p>
<p align="justify">And then, a sound reached Minerva's ears that was more sickening, more harrowing than any cry from Poppy. </p>
<p align="justify">From out of nowhere came a hoarse, low bellow which erupted around them all, bouncing from the walls and making everybody shake. It was filled with such grief; such pain; such shame that it seeped through everybody's skin and into their bones. Poppy was pulled from her stupor; her head shot up in the sounds direction and Priscilla's hand fell from Minerva's arm. For a moment, Minerva didn't recognise the sound, nor could she world out from whom it had come from but then she followed everybody's gaze and realised with horror that it was Albus. </p>
<p align="justify">Molly gawped at him, unable to comprehend that such a noise could come from such a composed man and Arthur looked on his shock. Minerva was horrified, stunned, until she was able to gather herself together. Without any thought, without any doubt, Minerva gently pushed pass Poppy and Aberforth and rushed to Albus's side. Paying no heed to what had gone on between them, Minerva instinctively grabbed his hand and pulled it to her lips, pressing an urgent kiss again his skin. She patted his hand and moved closer to him as Molly fled. With a tight grip on his shoulder, Minerva turned his head to face her by his chin and stared hard into his blue eyes. </p>
<p align="justify">"Albus," she whispered. "Not much longer, Albus. I promise." </p>
<p align="justify">"You say that as if this will end." </p>
<p align="justify">"Just look at me, darling. Don't look up there. Just look at me," she said and he did. For the rest of the service Albus did not break his gaze and by the time it was done, Minerva noticed that he was holding himself up again. He was no longer leaning on her as greatly as he had been and so she loosened her grip and let go on his hand. When her hand left his, he snatched it back and squeezed. </p>
<p align="justify">And then he said the words that she had once said to Ellen, as she faced her own death: "Hold on to me, Minerva. Just hold onto me." </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p align="justify">That night the darkness came slowly. For all too long the sun remained high in the sky, so obstinate and unforgiving that it seemed as if dusk would never come. When the sky finally turned inky blue, Minerva was relieved. She was done. One of the hardest and worst days of her life was over and now, all she had to do was tackle the monumental task of carrying on. </p>
<p align="justify">She decided to remain the castle that night. She couldn't stay for she was already feeling the weight of it on her shoulders but she couldn't bring herself to leave just yet. Just one more night in the Dumbledore home and then she would be able to leave. She would grant herself a few more hours of living in the past; a past which had been so warm and filled with joy Minerva thought she might burst. Everywhere she looked, there was a memory of Eleanor. By the fireplace Eleanor had first grabbed hold of the low coffee table and pulled herself onto her feet; in the kitchen Eleanor's tantrum had revealed her first piece of magic in which she made the cupboards explode. In the entrance hall, Eleanor had first waddled to her father, arms outstretched as she proudly showed of her new walking skills when he came in after a long meeting at the Ministry. Eleanor had grown up her. Minerva had had a family here. </p>
<p align="justify">"I'm sorry, I thought you had left," came Albus's quiet voice as he came into the sitting room. "I don't mean to disturb you, Minerva, I'll leave-" </p>
<p align="justify">"Albus! Wait!" Minerva called out. "Don't go on my account. I know why you are here; no doubt for the same reasons as me." </p>
<p align="justify">Albus smiled sadly and shrugged. "I didn't know where else to go. We brought her up here, Minerva. She lived and breathed here." </p>
<p align="justify">"I know, I know," Minerva whispered. She patted the empty seat next to her. "Come sit, you aren't disturbing me." </p>
<p align="justify">Albus sat down slowly and began to play with the hem of his sleeve. "I want to thank you, my dear. I- Today, when I- well, I want to thank you for coming to my aid." </p>
<p align="justify">"Don't be silly, there is no need to thank me," Minerva quipped. "Today was the hardest day of our lives. I'm sorry, Albus, I should have been with you from the start. I sent Molly to be with you because I didn't think-I- I didn't think that we should... be together, so to speak but I was wrong. You have lost Eleanor too and I should have been there to help you." </p>
<p align="justify">Albus nodded but said nothing. Minerva watched his cheeks turn pink and his eyes water. </p>
<p align="justify">"How- how have you been?" She asked tentatively. </p>
<p align="justify">"I'm not really sure," he said. "I can't... can't remember. The days have merged into one another. Minerva, I-" and he wanted to tell her that he loved her, that he needed her more than he ever had. He was desperate to tell her that he could not live through the coming days without her. Eleanor had been a part of them both and if they were together, it might feel as if she were with them again. He wanted to tell her that without Eleanor, without Minerva, he couldn't see a point to any of it. He wanted to tell her that he had made a mistake and that they should come back to each other. </p>
<p align="justify">He wanted to tell her so much but his heart was too full of sorrow and anguish to form the words. He felt too broken, to bereaved to utter them and instead, he started to sob. He heard Minerva follow suit and before they knew it, they were in each other's arms. </p>
<p align="justify">They sat together in the their living room for the rest of the night, until dawn came and Minerva got up and packed her things. As she kissed his forehead and left, Albus realised that he finally had the strength to tell her that he loved her but it was too late - she was gone and he had missed his chance. </p>
<p align="justify">With a sigh, Albus left, locking the door behind him. He stroked the front door and patted the key in his pocket before he turned on his heels and made for his office. He was alone and that was everything he deserved. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
