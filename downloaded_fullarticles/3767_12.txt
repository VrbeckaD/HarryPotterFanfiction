  <b>Prologue</b>
</p><p><br/> </p><p>This… This is terrific. Just fantastic.</p><p>The duo had landed in the middle of a busy street. People passed all around them, doing their daily business. Merlin saw that the street was S. Broadway, it was near the fish market. Or at least it used to be. It was now a hipster location to eat and chat.  </p><p>The two sorcerer’s stood in front of the building feeling very dazed and confused.</p><p>“Why are we in Los Angeles, Merlin?” Max suddenly asked.</p><p>“I don’t know. It is the last place I thought of- before appearing here. Besides, it is your hometown.”</p><p>“Yeah… it’s been a long time.” she said while her knees slowly buckled. Merlin caught her in the moment. No one had noticed, people were too focused on their phones.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, must have gotten injured during the battle. We should get out of here, Merlin.” Max said while Merlin helped her up and teleported out of the city.</p><p> </p><p>Landing in a abandoned house, Merlin left Max on the floor while his gathering his things.</p><p>His inventory consisted of a bag full of books, a few clothes, and a wallet with cash and credit cards.</p><p>He had found a couch and had laid his apprentice there.</p><p>Yes, he has an apprentice- her name is Max, short for Maxwell.</p><p>He remembered when he first met her, it was in the same city too. But not the same world.</p><p>Accidentally landing in the strange new world, he bumped into Max’s black hair while standing; feeling pretty dazed and confused as to what was going on.</p><p>Max’s black and tan arms had pushed him out of the way, and now the small girl had dashed out of his sight. Merlin had  decided to intervene when three thugs were chasing down the kid down.</p><p>The next thing he knew, was that Max had gladly agreed to be his apprentice.</p><p>Yet here they are, in a recognizable city with no clue as to what year it was.</p><p>Finding some paper and a pen within the apartment, he wrote a note saying that he left to go and find supplies.</p><p>Finishing that, he wandered outside into the uncharted city.</p><p> </p><p>The city of Los Angeles was beautiful, even with the homeless settled in, it was still beautiful.</p><p>It was busy, but not overcrowded as New York was. Cars and Traffic were everywhere-but that was the whole point of L.A. The traffic, the homeless, the work, and the happy sun-made the city. While seeing the homeless in downtown, it gave a great slap back into reality.</p><p>Facing the terror and eventually dieing some day -maybe it was the reason Max liked the city so much.  </p><p>It was nice, sunny and the day looked like any ordinary one.</p><p>The song: <em> It’s the of the world </em> by R.E.M played in loops in Merlin’s head.  That was due to Max singing the chores for <b> 5 hours</b> in the car, before the whole battle and aparting in L.A. It was annoying, but he dealt with it-like he  always did with her other spasms.</p><p>Anyways, he walked into the street looking for a clothing shop, because right now-he was filthy.</p><p>His clothes were filled with grim, pants soaked in sweat from running, tee-shirt laced with holes and dried blood and his blue flannel had a blood stain in the back. It was from an injury he healed at the apartment.</p><p>His clothes made him seem as a murder or loon of some sort that has escaped a hospital.</p><p>Merlin caught a clothing store and decided to walk in smiling.</p><p>Hopefully not scaring anybody.</p><p> </p><p>Why did her head hurt so much? Was it from the fight? Who knows,” Max thought. Her vision was blurred and there was a bright light in her face. Merlin! That old geezer must have put it there when she was unconscious! It was most likely pay-back from the prank she did last summer.</p><p>It was glorious. Magnificent.</p><p>Pull away long strands of hair from her face, Max looked around the room she had awoken in. There was no one in the apartment, but the place did look like a mess. It was abandoned, the floor was dusty, writing on the wall, and the couch she was sitting on had tears in it. On the desk next to her, was a note left by Merlin.</p><p>Picking it up she tired to read it- but the words just blurred and fuzzed around the page.</p><p>Where was Merlin? He must have gone out for a supply run.</p><p>Well, <em>technically</em> they didn’t have anything with them at the moment.</p><p><em>And</em> she didn’t know what year it was.</p><p>What happens if they were in the past and screw something up?</p><p>What would happen then? Max calmed herself down by a few deep breaths.</p><p>
  <em> In and out. In and out. Come on, stop panicking. Max. Calm down. </em>
</p><p>She slumped into the couch, not knowing what to do in her situation.</p><p>Her head was in a hurricane and vision was on drugs.</p><p>The only thing- to do was to sit, wait for Merlin to come, and fix her injury.</p><p>
  <em>Perfect.</em>
</p><p>Max’s stomach grumbled for food and water.</p><p>
  <em> Sorry, you are going to have to wait. Where is Merlin?? Hopefully he didn’t- </em>
</p><p>The door rattled and Merlin came in. He held two brown paper bags that smelled like meatballs and two white bags with the word: GAP on it. He had a sleepy smile on his face which didn’t match his eyes. But Max didn’t question it, but he was most likely tired from the battle.</p><p><strong>The battle</strong>, she had totally forgot about it. It just happened in a flash and then they were in the the city of Los Angeles.</p><p>“Oh, Merlin you’re back. My head feels weird and my vis-”</p><p>“I know. Your vision is blurry and your head feels like vomit?”</p><p>“Yes, that is precisely-as to what I am experiencing right now.”</p><p>Merlin chuckled and set the white GAP bags on a brown lump. Max thought that it was a table-very a old one anyway.</p><p>“Do you have any water, Merlin?”</p><p>“Yes, I do. Here. He put a bottle in her hand, along with a meatball sandwich. Or at least it smelled like one.</p><p>Putting the bottle to her lips and sipping steadily; she took deep breaths to calm herself from her headache. Max’s head was still swimming in water when Merlin sat down and started to fire off questions.</p><p>She didn’t even hear his first question, let alone the second.</p><p>“Max? Max? Are you listening/ Hello? Max?” he signed mumbling under his breath, “I knew this would happen.”</p><p>“Merlin put his hands on her water bottle and whisper a few words.</p><p>The water glowed and faded out within a  instant. Max had to squint her eyes from the blinding light.</p><p>“Drink.” Merlin said  gruffly to Max as  she opened the meatball sandwich.</p><p>‘Mmm-hmm.”</p><p>Slipping the water carefully, Max felt instantly better.</p><p>“So, what year are we in?”</p><p>“1995. In the month of July, day: 31”</p><p>“So…..Merlin...what are we going to do now?”</p><p>Max looked up at him with a worried face, she thought that they were going to stay in this year forever. </p><p>Merlin wiped his mouth against his sleeve. Max thought he was drinking again. Hopefully he wasn't.</p><p><br/> </p><p>Merlin held up on envelope with a wax seal and some weird imprint stamped on it.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re going to a school.”</p><p><br/> <br/> </p>
