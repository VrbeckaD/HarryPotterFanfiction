    <p>Hermione side-along apparated with Janice from Mildred and Stoat Magical Getaways, feeling the familiar pull and slight strangeness when someone else was in control. Although the pictures of the property looked lovely she was excited to see the real thing and get set up for the Christmas break.</p>
<p>“Here we are Ms. Granger.” Janice bustled forward opening the small iron gate and heading up the path to the snow covered cottage. “I’ll just show you around and then leave you to it.”</p>
<p>Hermione stood outside the gate for a moment, transfixed by the picture perfect dwelling. As she looked through the traditional paned glass windows a feeling of rightness settled over her.</p>
<p>“Of course, you know that we decorate our cottages for Christmas at this time of year.” Janice was already at the house, unaware that Hermione was not behind her. Hermione shook herself and quickly hurried down the path. The pale green front door had a pine cone wreath obscuring most of it but Janice located the lock and opened it up into the cosy cottage.</p>
<p>Hermione stepped into the hallway, subconsciously wiping her boots on the welcome mat. She looked through to the living room on her right, seeing that they had indeed made the cottage look very festive. The first thing she spotted was the massive fireplace taking up centre stage in the low-ceilinged room. Logs were piled up in and around the hearth ready to be lit in and a garland of greenery trailed along the mantel. She moved through the hallway and stepped further into the lounge.</p>
<p>Her eye was drawn immediately towards a giant Christmas tree sat back in the bay window; gold baubles hung fat from the branches and tinsel sparkled lighting up the depths of the green boughs. She could see woodland critters dotted about the evergreen and fairy lights glowed warmly, sprinkled around so she could see their reflection shining on the paned glass window behind.</p>
<p>As she turned to view the rest of the lounge she could see a door at the back of the room that opened onto a cosy kitchen and a bough of mistletoe hung on the door frame. She gave a wry smile at that. Janice was clattering something in the kitchen still talking away so Hermione unwound her warm, green tartan scarf and took off her coat. She felt herself instantly relax, this would do, this would do nicely.</p>
<p>“I’ve put the kettle on Ms Granger. The bedroom and adjoining bathroom are upstairs; there is another WC at the back of the kitchen. Now let me show you the study.” Janice came briskly through from the kitchen, passed Hermione and walked back across the hallway opening the heavy wooden door on the other side. “Here we are, it’s all ready for you.”</p>
<p>Hermione had followed her across the hall and peeped into the open doorway, eager to see the room that had drew her to this particular cottage.</p>
<p>In the bay window on this side of the cottage sat a large wooden desk; a padded swivel chair was placed comfortably in the recess of the desk looking out onto the wintery garden. Out of the window Hermione could see the snow-tipped hedgerows behind a large, well stocked bird feeder that was attracting a lot of attention. Glancing back at the desk she saw a classic blue typewriter was placed right in front of the chair and all manner of quills and parchments littered the desk. This room had another log fire ready to go and in the alcoves next to it were bookshelves rammed full, the books slotted in every which way. Another smaller Christmas tree glittered away in the corner at the back of the room with a couple of armchairs next to it.</p>
<p>“Oh it’s perfect Janice. I may never want to leave.” Hermione beamed at the shrewd witch who had found her this delightful property.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve got it until the 8<sup>th</sup> January but we haven’t actually got anyone booked in until February so if you want to stay a little longer just send me an owl. As you know Hogsmeade isn’t far so you shouldn’t have any problems contacting me.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, this is just wonderful. It’s just what I was after.” Hermione looked around the cosy study feeling as if she would never stop smiling.</p>
<p>“Good. We aim to please.” Janice smiled warmly at Hermione. “Now here is the key, the fireplace is connected to the Floo if you need. It should have everything you want, all stocked and ready, but any questions then please do not hesitate to contact me.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure I’ll be fine but thank you.” Hermione was already off across the room, trailing her fingers across the spines of the books crammed into the bookshelves.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave you to it then.” Janice walked back out into the hall getting ready to leave, Hermione heard her open the door. “Merry Christmas Ms. Granger, I hope you find what you’re looking for here.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Merry Christmas Janice and thank you again.” She heard the front door shut and watched Janice out of the window as she shut the wooden gate and disappeared with a crack.  </p>
<p>Her fingers were itching to grab a book but she made herself resist. She could hear the tea kettle whistling from in the kitchen so made her way back through the living room towards the noise. She found a small, cosy-covered teapot at the side of the stove and grabbed a fine china cup from its hook on the welsh dresser. She started to open the cupboards and found they were stocked with much more than she could ever need. She poured the hot water in the teapot, gave it a stir and placed it on a tray with her cup, a jug of milk and a couple of cauldron cakes that had practically leapt out of the cupboard.</p>
<p>When she was settled in the living room, shoes kicked off and legs curled underneath her on the squashy cushions, she started to ponder Janice’s parting words. When she’d first visited Mildred and Stoat Magical Getaways a couple of months ago she thought she was looking for a quiet place to write. After chatting to Janice Stoat for ten minutes she realised what she really wanted was a hideaway. She’d been toying with the idea of going away for Christmas and Janice was the first person she’d come across who didn’t find it strange that she wanted to spend Christmas on her own, in fact she heartily encouraged it.</p>
<p>Sat in that little office Hermione broke down telling her that not only were her own parents on the other side of the world with no memory of their daughter but she had also split up with her long term boyfriend and quit her job all in the last year. For some reason it seemed easier to lay herself bare to a stranger than it did to the people close to her. She’d changed pretty much everything that identified her as Hermione and she needed a place to go where she could have to time and space to figure out who this new woman was.</p>
<p>As soon as Janice showed her this property, out in the middle of the Scottish Highlands, she fell in love with it. She’d paid upfront straight away and walked out of that office feeling better than she had in some time.</p>
<p>She still wasn’t quite sure what she was looking for her; writing inspiration, a grand revelation but she’d be happy just to have a home all to herself for a week or two. She’d moved in with Harry at Grimmauld Place after the war but this year Ginny had joined them and although they never said it she couldn’t help but feel a little like she was cramping their style, especially when she was very much single with no prospects on the horizon. She hated to admit that it made her a little sad to see how loved up they were when her own teenage romance had fallen flat on its face. Besides this was the couple’s first Christmas living together and Hermione didn’t want to intrude on that. No point dwelling on it all now she told herself and drank her tea, determined to put herself first for once.</p>
<p>Reluctantly unfurling herself from the sofa Hermione went upstairs to unpack her bags; the bedroom was spacious but had been built into the cottages’ roof so she had to duck slightly in certain parts. When her clothes were put away she went back down to the study to set up her writing materials. She sat down at the desk and had to tear her eyes away from the view to write a brief letter to Harry. She knew he wasn’t keen on her being away on her own and in her current light mood she was keen to reassure him that this was for the best. For the last few months it felt like she’d been going through the motions with her best friend, she hadn’t connected much with anyone recently but today, she started to think she would be ok. It made her smile to herself at the realisation that the first person she wanted to share that with was Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Janice had told her Hogsmeade was only a twenty minute walk from the cottage so she donned her thick pea coat, tartan scarf and big boots and set out for the magical village. She let her mind wander on the way and revelled in the fact that the only sound on the country lanes was her boots crunching the snow and birds chirping around her.</p>
<p>The village was full of activity with plenty of Christmas shoppers traipsing around the small streets. Hermione knew that a lot of Wizarding folk preferred to visit this quaint village at Christmas rather than travel to Diagon Alley. Looking around she could see why; pure white snow was thick on the rooftops and a light dusting sparkled over the cobbles. The old fashioned streetlights glowed, marking out the pathways and jolly wreaths hung on doorways. Visiting here always made her think of her time at Hogwarts and she felt a bittersweet nostalgia wash over her as she came upon the towering Christmas tree, majestic in the centre square.</p>
<p>Hermione headed straight to the post office and chose an owl to post her letter. She had invited Harry and Ginny to The Three Broomsticks on Christmas Eve to fight off the guilt of not seeing them on Christmas Day. She’d already done her Christmas shopping but she couldn’t resist a visit to Tomes and Scrolls. Hattie Herald had ran the little shop since Hermione first visited the village in her Hogwarts days; finding another booklover Hattie immediately took a shine to Hermione and they had been friends ever since. Knowing that she hadn’t visited since before last Christmas she popped into Madam Puddifoot’s on the way to by some cake as a peace-offering.</p>
<p>She slipped into the busy tea shop and joined the queue, it was stuffy and overwhelmingly pink but the smell of spiced apple and cinnamon filled the air and she asked for half a dozen of the buns that were giving off that delightful aroma. Holding the cake box tightly by the string wrapped around it, she squeezed back out through the doorway, apologising to people as she brushed past. Feeling the chilled outside air on her face she made a last dart for door, someone moved and suddenly she was falling towards the cobbles. At the last moment somebody pulled on her arm, hoisting her out of the way as the cake box flew from her hands.</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry I got stuck in the door and...” Hermione looked finally looked up from the hand wrapped around her arm, she found herself staring straight into grey eyes, “Malfoy!”</p>
<p>She jumped back, wrenching her arm away. She looked at him again, seeing a smirk playing around his mouth as he stared down at her. He gracefully bent down and scooped up her dropped cake box, hooking the string over his long fingers. He held it out for her.</p>
<p>“I believe thank you is the word you’re searching for Granger.” He was definitely smirking now.</p>
<p>“Err, thank you. What are you doing here?” Hermione realised in her shock at seeing him she sounded quite screechy.</p>
<p>“It’s Hogsmeade Granger...the week before Christmas, every wizard and his crup is here.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, but Madam Puddifoot’s, I didn’t think that was your kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“Nor yours but here we are.” He put his hands in the pockets of his navy overcoat as if he had no intention of leaving anytime soon.</p>
<p>“I’m just here for the buns.” She held up her cake box as proof. He huffed out a laugh, his breath clouding in the air between them.</p>
<p>“So I see. I’m actually meeting my Mother here, she’ll be in France for Christmas.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, you’re not going too?” She wasn’t sure what made her ask that and she was even more shocked when he pleasantly answered her.</p>
<p>“I’m staying at the castle, someone has to keep those unruly students in line. Longbottom lets them walk all over him.”</p>
<p>Hermione sensed he was teasing her but she automatically stuck up for Neville. “I’m sure he doesn’t, he’s just kind-hearted.”</p>
<p>“That may be but you don’t have to be friends with the little sods. We’re there to teach them not befriend them.” Hermione watched as his attention was caught by something over her shoulder, he looked back at her amused.</p>
<p>“Hello Ms Granger, fancy seeing you here.” The pristine voice of Narcissa Malfoy rang out from behind Hermione and she tensed automatically. “Draco, darling, wonderful to see you.” She walked over to Malfoy and held her cheek out for him to kiss.</p>
<p>“Mother.” Malfoy dutifully pecked her cheek and Narcissa eyed Hermione up expectantly.</p>
<p>“Hello Mrs. Malfoy.”She spoke out on instinct.</p>
<p>“It’s actually Black now, Ms Black. I thought Draco would have told you.” She placed a gloved hand on Malfoy’s arm.</p>
<p>“We’re hardly friends Mother, this is the most I’ve spoke to Granger in a year. She just fell at my feet in front of this fine establishment. I rescued her buns.”</p>
<p>“Draco, don’t be crass!”Narcissa scolded him automatically, as if this talk between them was commonplace.</p>
<p>Hermione looked at them both; unsure whether to laugh or run away from this strange conversation. She became aware she hadn’t spoken for some time but found her tongue was unable to form any words.</p>
<p>“You look well Ms Granger.” Narcissa said.</p>
<p>Hermione brushed down her coat nervously. “Err thank you, Mrs..Ms Black.”</p>
<p>“Are you joining us?”</p>
<p>Hermione was bewildered, joining them? Why would she be joining them?</p>
<p>“I’m sure Granger has more pressing matters than tea with us Mother.”Malfoy was frowning at her now as if she was the confusing one in this situation.</p>
<p>Hermione came to her senses, Narcissa was just being polite and Malfoy clearly didn’t want her to join them. “Oh, gosh no. Sorry. I mean, I’m actually on my way to see someone.” She held up the slightly squashed box of buns again.</p>
<p>“Okay, well Merry Christmas Ms Granger.” She patted Malfoy on the arm. “I’ll go in and get out usual table darling.” She was gone before Hermione could form a reply. Her eyes narrowed suspiciously at Malfoy, what was that? Narcissa being civil, Malfoy being quite pleasant. It was off-putting.</p>
<p>“Nice to see you Granger.” He nodded his head slightly and walked off into the tea rooms. Hermione stood there for a moment. What a strange encounter. It was true that Malfoy was no longer quite the same foul git she knew from school. After the war he’d taken the job as potions master at Hogwarts and was doing a fantastic job at it from all accounts. Harry had dragged her along to a Hogwarts Quidditch game last year and they had all spoken without any arguments. At the time part of Hermione had just assumed that it was because he was with his students, setting a good example and all that, but maybe not.</p>
<p>She shook her head slightly and set off back towards Tomes and Scrolls hoping that seeing Hattie would distract her from what had just happened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The small brass bell called out to the towering bookshop as she opened the door. Tomes and Scrolls may not be as popular as Flourish and Botts in Diagon Alley but Hermione preferred it. The shop covered five floors and although each room was only small everywhere you looked there were books, piled up on shelves, on tables, on the floor. Whatever cataloguing system there was Hermione had never figured out but it all made sense to Hattie, she could find you anything you asked for.</p>
<p>“Hello.” She called out into the quiet.</p>
<p>“Helloooo, just a moment dear, I’ll be along soon.” She heard the soft Scottish accent travel down from one of the upper levels. As she waited Hermione unwrapped her scarf from round her neck and put her cake box on the counter.</p>
<p>“Now then, here I am, I’m a coming. What can I do you for?” Hattie was making her way down the spiral staircase that ran through the middle of all the floors, purple robes swaying around her.</p>
<p>As she reached the bottom Hermione smiled, she hadn’t changed a bit. She had no idea what age Hattie was but she always looked very trendy, her grey hair was cut into a sleek bob and her robes were always bright and colourful. Two gold triangle earrings peeped out from under her hair.</p>
<p>“Oh Hermione, my dear, dear girl! It’s been too long.” They met each other with a hug and Hermione enjoyed being enveloped by the elderly witch. “What a lovely surprise, oh it’s such a treat to see you, it really is. Now sit down, I’ll go put the kettle on and we can have a good catch up.”</p>
<p>Hattie kept a little table surrounded by a few mismatched armchairs by the counter downstairs. Hermione knew that she often sat down for a cuppa with her favourite regulars. Hattie had lots of stories to tell and lots of advice to bestow. Hermione settled into a chair, opening up the box of buns and setting it on the table. Hattie appeared quickly, levitating a tea tray with her.</p>
<p>“Oh and look what you brought!” Hattie exclaimed with genuine delight. “Now tell me, first why have you been away so long and secondly what wonderful reason brought you back to my little shop?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry it’s been so long Hattie. It’s a bit of a tale to be honest.” Hermione knew she would have to come clean about the last twelve months.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve got nothing but time my girl. Shop is quiet at the moment and I’m not going anywhere.” Hattie reached forward and took Hermione’s hand in her own.</p>
<p> “I suppose it all started early this year. I was busy, so busy with work. You know me and Ron had split up and I took that job in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement? I thought it was going to be everything I wanted but it was just paperwork. Mountains and mountains of the stuff and I couldn’t change anything. I was working all hours, barely having time to see my friends or even remember to eat. You know me, I don’t mind hard work but this was so fruitless.”</p>
<p>“I knew it Hermione, oh I had hoped for the best dearie but I never thought the Ministry was the right place for you. You have so much more to offer, so tell me, you left and now what?” Hattie was never backwards and coming forwards.</p>
<p>“Well you’re right, I did leave. I had an intervention of sorts from Harry and Ginny; they were so worried about me. We lived together and I hadn’t seen them for a whole week. One night they sat me down and asked me what I was doing? Then it hit me, what was I doing? Running myself into the ground, never having any fun and all for what? I’d been there six months and hadn’t made the slightest bit of difference. I’d totally lost my way, with work, even with my friends, with myself and I’m still not sure the damage is repaired there. So anyway, I went in the next day and handed in my resignation.”Hermione took a deep breath. “And now, well now, I’m writing. Hattie I want to be a writer.”</p>
<p>At this Hattie leapt up clapping her hands together. “This is just wonderful, truly wonderful, oh I can see it now, Hermione Granger books piled up in my little shop. And so what it is, what are you writing?”</p>
<p>At this Hermione felt a little sheepish, she hadn’t actually told anyone what she was writing. Everyone assumed it was non-fiction, some kind of guide to freeing House-elves or equality for all magical creatures. “Actually, it’s fiction.” Hermione squirmed in her seat but looking at Hattie’s beaming face she decided to come clean. “It’s romance.” She fought the urge to cringe.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, that is just what I’d have thought for you my girl.” Hattie exclaimed, not a shadow of doubt of her face.</p>
<p>“Really?” Hermione replied with shock in her voice.</p>
<p>“I remember that young girl who used to come in here, hair flying every which way as she spilled her heart out about the boy she loved. I remember you coming last Christmas so desperate to make it work with him and how sad you were when you realised it wasn’t right. I remember you telling me all about your favourite fairytales and your Muggle Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre; I could see that dreamy look on your face when you described Mr Rochester. In fact that was what encouraged me to read it! You want to be swept off your feet! You’re a romantic at heart Hermione, you keep it well hidden but I can see it well enough.”Hattie said earnestly.</p>
<p>“I’ve not actually told anyone what I’m writing. I’m not sure they’ll take me seriously.” Hermione admitted; glad to finally say it aloud.</p>
<p>“What tosh, you have to write what is in your heart Hermione. If it’s right for you it will be right for others. I’ve been working with books long enough to know that. Readers just want something that speaks to them, they want to be swept away, to realise their greatest fantasy there on the page. They want to escape. Trust me my girl it won’t be long until I see your books in here, Hattie is never wrong.”</p>
<p>The longer she sat in the little bookshop the happier Hermione felt. She hadn’t been able to confess to anyone what she was writing so to hear a bookseller and good friend tell her she was doing the right thing was hugely reassuring. They chatted away until it started to go dark outside, several customers had come and gone and every time Hattie came back and carried the conversation on with Hermione. This time though Hermione looked outside and reluctantly started to wrap up to head outside.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to go Hattie, I can’t believe how long I’ve been in here.”</p>
<p>“And yet we still have more to say! Don’t leave it so long this time my girl” Hattie pulled her in for a hug.</p>
<p>“Oh no, I won’t, not at all. I’m actually staying near here; I’ve come away for Christmas. Given myself the gift of a little writers retreat. I’ve got a cottage about twenty minutes away.”</p>
<p>“Perfect, that sounds just perfect. Come on now, you can leave as long as you agree to come back tomorrow. You can spare a little time away from the writing to visit Hattie now can’t you?”</p>
<p>Hermione chuckled at the pleading expression on Hattie’s face. “Of course I can. I’d love to come back tomorrow, you supply the tea and I’ll bring the treats.”</p>
<p>She was enveloped in another Hattie hug before she stepped out into the cold village streets. She walked through the village past Madam Puddifoot’s. Before she realised fully what she was doing she was peeking in the windows; no sign of Malfoy, he must be back up at Hogwarts. She could see the castle looming up the hill from the little village and wondered why he had decided to stay there for his Christmas instead of being with his Mother. Although she supposed not many people had understood why she wanted to hide herself away.</p>
<p>Maybe they weren’t so different after all.</p>
