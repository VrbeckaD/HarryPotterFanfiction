    <p>Graves 4 Echo’s first year in the facility has been a quiet and lonely one, with his own memories scattered and only the comfort of random images of a childhood that feel so very long ago. The chemicals have erased most of human life, and there is now only one uncontaminated place on earth that exists above ground anymore, the Island. </p><p>Everyone is always talking about it, and it’s all he has to think about, to look forward to, until the next year, his second, when he meets someone who he knows will be, and must have <em> been </em> important to him. They have the same first name, and only the numbers and designation as to where they’ve both been found that sets them apart. </p><p>Besides their appearances of course. All Graves could think is, now, at least, he isn’t alone anymore.</p><p>The younger man who holds his name is almost as tall as he is, but the similarities ended there, so how could they possibly have known each other before the Event? Graves 3 Delta has a very slim build even beneath the standard issued clothing and shoes, something that makes the older man think maybe he’d once been a dancer, before the Event. </p><p>With long dark hair that curls slightly around his ears and jaw line, which was so sharp it reminds him of the sculptures in museums, Echo thinks he’s a vision. In some ways, a lot of ways, Delta is what he could call pretty, far prettier than any young man has any right to be, especially if he is Echo’s long lost son. Who on earth is his mother?</p><p>That first morning for breakfast, he hangs back and watches as Delta goes through the food line, utterly confused at the small and slightly depressing portions of food he is given, so when it is Echo’s turn he sweet talks the lady in the hairnet for an extra piece of bacon. It always works, of course, and he smiles warmly at her before accepting his tray and going over to where Delta has chosen to sit, and indeed is still staring down at his tray with a less than pleased expression.</p><p>“Hello.” Delta looks up at him from beneath his long dark lashes, with wide brown eyes that seems oh so lost, before they focus on him.</p><p>“Hello.” His voice is soft, so delicate, cautious and he sounds unsure of the word itself.</p><p>“Would you mind if I joined you?” Delta looks around himself at the other tables full of chattering people and then back to Echo, before nodding, “Okay, sure.” His little shrug tells Echo he is wondering if maybe he’s mistaken about this.</p><p>“Here, they gave me too much of this. It looks like you could use some to... keep up your strength.” </p><p>Echo passes over a couple pieces of bacon. Delta smiles at him, just a bit, a tiny quirk of his plush lips and Echo instantly knows that they will be getting along perfectly. “Thank you. I’m not sure why I’m not allowed to get them myself.”</p>
