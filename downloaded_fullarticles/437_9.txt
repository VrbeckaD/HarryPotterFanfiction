  <em>18 June, 1996</em>
</p><p>Sirius Black was fifteen years old when he talked James Potter into helping him pierce his ear.</p><p>Wormtail had squirmed with disgust at the prospect, but Sirius and James had been perfectly in sync as ever, an echo chamber for their own rubbish ideas. The spirit of <em>rebellion</em> had got its claws properly into Sirius by that point and in London he’d seen a punk bloke with a face and ears full of metal. By his reasoning, he displayed great restraint in only wanting <em>one.</em> James and Sirius had been giddy with summertime and pissed from stolen firewhiskey, and they would not be deterred.</p><p>They had had their hearts set on using a Piercing Charm, but when James had tried to perform the spell with a quill he mistook for his wand in his drunkenness, Remus had intervened. He may have failed to talk them out of it entirely, but he could at least keep James from inadvertently botching the spell. Remus had allowed himself to become just barely tipsy, as was his custom in those days. Sirius had let his hair grow out and kept proudly tousling its shaggy perfection, which had made Remus edgy, unable to relax. Let his friends get boisterous, they were allowed. Remus couldn't afford to lower his inhibitions. As he was the soberest among them, he had volunteered to do the deed himself, to Wormtail's disbelief.</p><p>He had tidily transfigured a knut into a needle, then sanitized it with a <em>Scourgify</em> and a flame for good measure. Sirius had praised his wandwork effusively (even though it was Transfiguration most third years could have done just as well) and had watched with rapt attention as Remus carefully passed the needle through a wand-flame. Remus had worked desperately to keep his face straight, to not let show what Sirius was doing to his lovesick fifteen-year-old guts, and had managed it at first.</p><p>Until Sirius had repositioned himself with that puppy-like suddenness of his, so much more obvious since they’d all got to know Padfoot. Eager and spontaneous, he had clambered onto Remus, sprawling out with his head in Remus' lap. He had pulled his long hair back to reveal the elegant column of his throat, the pulse fluttering visibly between taut tendon and Adam's apple. His jaw had sharpened with pubescent definition, his pale skin had gleamed with the flush of the whiskey, and his ear had been stupidly perfect, awaiting Remus' needle. The echo of canine submission in the gesture had made Remus clench his teeth against the mad impulse to gnaw at Sirius’ throat as Moony might have done. He had cradled Sirius' face to tilt his head to the correct angle and the feel of the pulse that thudded against the side of his index finger had broken his careful facade of ambivalence, and prudence, and lofty disapproval. The sound that came out of him was too quiet to be a whimper, too quiet to even be audible unless one happened to be laying across his lap.</p><p>"It's alright, Moony," Sirius had reassured him, in a voice as muted and irresistible as the pull of the ripening moon, tugging right at Remus’ very bones, "I can take a little pain. I <em>want </em>you to do it."</p><p>Remus never knew if Sirius had been goading him, if he had intended the vague innuendo, if he had been genuinely comforting him, or if he had been trying to convince himself not to fear the tiny prick of the needle. Without warning, Remus had moved his hand from Sirius’ jaw, gripped his earlobe between his thumb and first finger, sinking the needle neatly into the soft flesh there. Sirius had tensed but had not yelped or teared up, and Remus did not flinch or look away, even as he wondered at the peculiar satisfaction of having Sirius at his mercy, at marking Sirius’ unmarred flesh, at the red blood that welled up like a jewel, leaving a stark trail against the paleness of Sirius' skin as it rolled through the curved channel of his ear and disappeared into his dark hair.</p><p>A second later Sirius had been popping out of his lap, heedless to any pain or mess from the new piercing. He had impatiently let Remus transfigure the embedded needle into a simple earring before moving onto the next thing, as mercurial as lightning flashing across the sky. Remus had been unable to look away from him.</p><p>The moment had been brief, but had so defined those years of hungry, early discovery within Remus’ self, that the image of Sirius' ear had been burned indelibly into some internal catalogue of his sexual awakenings (alongside many other images of Sirius).</p><p>It was a result of all this that Remus would have known Sirius' right ear anywhere. He had only grown to know it better in subsequent years, besides. Had shared healing salve with him, applying it as gently as possible with trembling fingers and thundering heart, when it inevitably had gotten infected in the following weeks, had whispered all manner of secrets against it, later had ran the tip of his tongue along the same path that that entrancing bead of blood had followed, and had tucked strands of singed black hair behind it after any number of too-close scrapes with Death Eaters. He had tried with all his might to forget it for twelve years only to wind up in his tiny kitchen, careful not to nick it as he cut away hair too matted and dull to possibly belong to the same preening boy he’d known, vibrant and irrepressible.</p><p>So when Remus saw Sirius’ ear, lying there on the marble floor at the Apparition point, he recognized it without a shadow of a doubt. It seemed innocuous somehow, sitting there in absurdist incongruity, like some gruesome joke prop from Zonko's. Something Sirius would have thought a laugh at fifteen, in fact, a realistic ear that would give someone a fright if they found it floating in their pumpkin juice.</p><p>They had been in such a mad rush to get to Harry, there had hardly been time to acknowledge it. Remus hadn’t even known quite what had happened. They had rematerialized at the Ministry, and Sirius had sworn in pain, clapping his hand to the side of his head. Remus had asked him what was wrong but he had simply pointed his wand at his head and muttered an impatient healing spell before taking off at a run, Remus hurrying after. Sirius had been practically blurred with it, the desperate need to protect Harry as he had failed to protect James, the heady rush of freedom from Grimmauld Place, the relief at being back in the thick of things where he felt useful. Remus had been hard-pressed to keep up. Like any wild animal feeling the elusive tremors of a coming volcanic eruption, the wolf had recognized with a tightness at the back of Remus’ jaw that signature, treacherous Sirius Black recklessness that ended in detentions, and infections, and catastrophe, and long solitary years in prison.</p><p>Sirius had been vivid and formidable with that reckless righteous fury, his momentum tearing through the Death Eaters like a cannonball.</p><p>And like a cannonball, he had plummeted back to earth with deathly finality. Plummeted <em>past </em>earth, in fact, through the damned Veil to the unfathomable beyond, and left Remus with nothing but his <em>bloody ear</em>.</p><p>Remus had never been squeamish. <em>Lycanthropes are not afforded the luxury of delicate stomachs</em>, so he had remarked airily to Peter at fifteen as he Transfigured the needle, stupid with suppressed longing and misguidedly swaggering because Sirius had assured him earlier in the evening, devastatingly sincere after two drinks, that if one looked at it right, being a werewolf was actually ‘<em>fucking cool</em>’. Remus still probably wasn’t <em>cool</em>, but he was even less squeamish at thirty-six than he had been at fifteen. Since then, he had seen his friends blown to bits in the war, had stitched himself back together in the grisly aftermath of the first few moons without his pack of Animagi, and had worked innumerable thanklessly foul minimum wage jobs to survive on bread and tea.</p><p>So he felt uncommonly little revulsion as he kneeled. He lowered himself slowly, as if the ear was a nervous mouse that might scurry away from sudden movement. Moving felt a bit like he was wading through jelly, and it tickled in some back corner of his head that he was likely in shock. Time seemed to skip like a faulty Muggle projector and he missed a few frames; he didn't remember reaching out his arm, but then the ear — Sirius' ear, complete with the little gold ring at the lobe, the same one Remus had made a lifetime ago — was sitting in his hand.</p><p>It was cold.</p><p>"Oh, Remus... come along now," someone urged, gently tugging him to his feet. Tonks, maybe. Remus found he was beyond knowing or caring. He stuffed the ear in his pocket, as guilty and secretive as a child with a stolen sweet. He was steered away, Side-Along Apparated, and all the while his hand in his pocket curled tighter and tighter, clutching the only part of Sirius he had, like a talisman.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>22 June, 1996 </em>
</p><p>Sirius’ ear would have looked quite at home at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. It would have been just another macabre specimen in a jar there, but in the cozy, modest Cambrian cottage where Remus had been raised, it looked dreadfully out of place. In the middle of his mam’s scrubbed wooden dining table, where she might have set a jar full of wild dog-roses and pimpernels, he had overturned a mug with a broken handle, using it as a bizarre pedestal for Sirius’ disembodied ear. It sat on the bottom end of the mug, crusty and darkened where once it had been attached to Sirius’ head, but otherwise perfect.</p><p>Years of rationing and stretching food when money was tight had trained Remus well in Preservation Charms, and he’d made sure the ear was thoroughly protected from the ravages of time. It would still decompose eventually, Remus knew that. No Preservation Charm could stay the natural order of things forever and eventually this relic would return unto the earth. A normal person might have just taken the Transfigured earring for a keepsake, perhaps would have buried the ear in the garden like a pet gerbil. And he had every intention of doing just that, he reminded himself… Only not quite yet.</p><p>It was just as normal, he told himself stubbornly, to want to wait a bit, to want some time to grieve. Catholics had ceremonious wakes, Jewish people sat <em>shiva</em>, the people of the Caribbean held Nine-Nights, and Remus had Sirius’ ear. Much as the word felt strange, he had been, in a sense, widowed. And it wasn’t as though there would be any sort of public service or inpouring of sympathies; Sirius had been a wanted man, Remus was an outcast himself, and their relationship to each other had been largely a secret, besides. He had every right to mourn as he saw fit, and if he saw fit by sitting here and drinking cup after cup of tea at a table with only Sirius’ right ear for company, then by Merlin, he was going to bloody do just that until he learned how in the hell to breathe around the hollowness in his chest.</p><p>He shifted his weight, arse gone numb from the hard wooden chair, and realized that though his heart may be hollow, his bladder was not. Remus stood stiffly and shuffled to the small loo, watching dispassionately as his piss turned the water in the toilet dark yellow. He had lost count of how many times he had pissed since Sirius had died. He couldn’t have told if it was a usual amount, anyway, because he couldn’t have told how many days had gone by. Remus had neither slept nor eaten since being delivered home from the Ministry by an extremely worried Tonks. He had merely sat at the table, drinking his way through his teabags, keeping vigil by Sirius’ right ear like some zealous Catholic paying homage to one of their incorrupt relics, preserved in gaudy spectacle ad infinitum. Sirius had been no saint, so perhaps it was fitting that instead of being enshrined in a gilded glass casket, his ear sat limply atop a busted mug. Remus reckoned it must have been two days at least, judging by how the light outside had come and gone, sometimes too dark to quite make out the ear but for the feeble glint of waxing moonlight on the curve of the earring.</p><p>When Remus returned to the kitchen, something was disturbing the tomblike stillness. It took him a few blinking moments to realize it was the sound of insistent tapping at the window. He crossed the room, swaying slightly, leaning a bit more of his weight than he should have needed to against the sill. He recognized the tiny, fluffy owl as belonging to the Weasleys’, though its silly name eluded him. He stared at it for another second before opening the window for it, allowing it to flutter inside. It swooped around the room delightedly, squeaking and hooting with profane good humor on so somber an occasion, “Give it here,” Remus said, surprised by the hoarseness of his own disused voice. The owl dropped a scroll of parchment and a parcel far heavier than it looked into his palm obediently and then resumed its happy figure-eights around the cobwebbed light fixture.</p><p>Remus collapsed back into his chair by the table and unrolled the letter.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Remus,</em>
</p><p>
  <em> I hope this letter finds you well. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>We were sorry not to see you at the meeting on Tuesday. Nymphadora was in knots, worried that she had made a mistake leaving you alone after the debacle at the Ministry. I tried to assure her of your resilience, but a letter to her wouldn’t be amiss, just to let her know that you’re alright.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I do hope that you are alright, dear. I hope it will not sound insincere for me to extend my condolences. Sirius and I did not often see eye to eye, but it’s a dreadful thing. Ron is worried about Harry, and of course, I am, too. As if that dear boy hasn’t already been through enough! So little time with his godfather, and I have no doubt he feels guilty about the circumstances! He isn’t at fault, of course, but perhaps it would be better for him to hear that from you than from me? You were closer to Sirius, after all.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Please write back and ease my mind. Or better yet, come by the Burrow any time, the children miss having you around and I’m sure you could do with a hot meal.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With sympathy, Molly</em>
</p><p>
  <em>P.S. Pigwidgeon couldn’t carry the food without me Shrinking it, but I recommend eating it at its normal size if you’d like to avoid indigestion.</em>
</p><p>Remus read the letter through three times before setting it down, sick with a combination of pique, guilt, and the twisting hunger he’d ignored for more days than he’d first estimated. Apparently, there had been an Order meeting on Tuesday that he’d missed, though he couldn’t for his life have told what day of the week it was today, or how long ago Tuesday had been.</p><p>His first reaction was annoyance, offense, even. Molly’s condolences <em>did</em> ring as a bit disingenuous; she and Sirius had done worse than not see eye to eye! She’d never stopped distrusting him, even after she knew of his innocence. Remus had always suspected some of that sprang from her own embarrassment at having unknowingly harbored Peter Pettigrew in her home for over a decade, feeding him scraps from her family's table. It was not simply that, though. She’d had little patience with Sirius’ immaturity, his moodiness, his flair for the dramatic. Remus understood that to a degree, but it still hadn’t made it easier for him to mediate the tensions between the two. More than anything, though, Remus knew that Molly’s distaste for Sirius had sprung from that maternal nature at Molly’s core, her protectiveness over Harry verging on possessiveness and (sometimes fairly) suspecting Sirius as a bad influence as a parental figure.</p><p>But Sirius had hardly gotten a chance to be any kind of parental figure to Harry, and now he was gone, and Remus knew Molly meant well but he still found his teeth grinding. Molly had been and now would always be more of a parent to Harry, and while she was a splendid surrogate mum, it was just yet another thing that was not as it ought to have been. As clearly as if it was yesterday, more clearly in fact, Remus could recall the way Sirius had beamed when Prongs and Lily had asked him to be godfather. Remus had looked at his smile and thought <em>he can’t possibly be the spy</em>, and if only his trust hadn’t wavered, if only he’d held onto the warm promise of that smile—</p><p>Remus sighed, pushed away his anger at Molly and his anger at himself, and unwrapped the weighty parcel that had accompanied the letter. He peered down at a spread of food fit for a dollhouse, too tiny to easily identify. He pulled out his wand for the first time since casting the Preservation Charms, and muttered <em>Engorgio</em>.</p><p>The food started growing and didn’t stop; a dish of Toad-in-the-Hole, a roasted chicken, two pies, a basket of currant-dotted scones, a wheel of cheese, a loaf of bread, and an overflowing bag of apples. As the food swelled back to normal size, it quickly crowded the small wooden table. Remus gaped at the spread, only noticing the broken-handled mug teetering on the edge just before it tipped over. The mug hit the floor and smashed to pieces, sounding too loud and making Remus wince. He peeked one eye open, braced for the indignity of seeing the only thing that remained of Sirius lying on the floor amidst dust motes and shards of ceramic. When it wasn't there, panic sliced through him, <em>how could it be gone? </em></p><p>Then he realized that there was something cold and cartilage-supple clutched in his hand. He unfolded his fingers and peered down at the ear, expecting to perhaps find it grisly and strange beside all the food before him, but he found it only precious. Relief poured through him and he thanked Merlin that for all his lycanthropy had taken from him, at least it granted him such quick reflexes.</p><p>He reluctantly let go of the ear, setting it on the counter away from the food and seated himself at the table, staring at the evidence of Molly's generosity as he waited for his heart to slow. <em>You're losing your grip, Lupin</em>, he told himself calmly, as he reached for one of Molly's scones. He bit into it, mouth watering with hunger, even as his panic receded enough for the guilt to claw its way to the foreground of his thoughts. Had he really been too tangled up in his own obsessive vigil to a lifeless bit of skin and gristle, that he hadn't spared even a thought for Harry in the unknowable number of days since Sirius' death? He had kept thoughts of that moment at bay, of Sirius falling, but the memory of Harry's skinny chest straining against his arms, his voice shouting Sirius' name in useless desperation came to him unbidden. Was he so selfish that he’d considered his work done, simply because he’d kept Harry from chasing off to share Sirius’ fate?</p><p>For the first time since the Veil had fallen still, the numbness in Remus threatened to break. He felt the very edge of it, and it was worse than a dozen full moons rolled into one. He pushed the pain away reflexively, fairly sure that he would break irreparably under the weight of it. And <em>his </em>pain was not what mattered just now, anyway. Of course, Harry was suffering. Of course, Harry blamed himself. Of course, Harry needed him.</p><p>If Sirius still existed, he would have been furious. Remus could practically hear him, pointing out that his <em>bloody godson</em> was more important than his <em>fucking ear, </em>and <em>Moony, I shouldn't have to bloody tell you that!</em></p><p>It hurt Remus’ throat to swallow his mouthful of scone, and though his stomach begged for more, he felt a sudden powerful need to crawl into bed. <em>Just one thing I must do first</em>. He found some parchment and a biro, and took rather too long and a few drafts to pen a few sentences in response to Molly. He assured her he was alright, thanked her for the food and her condolences, and asked her, perhaps futilely, if she had a telephone number for Harry at his Muggle aunt and uncle’s house. He coaxed the hyperactive Pigwidgeon down from the rafters, secured the letter to his leg and watched out the window until he was little more than an erratic fleck against the reprehensibly cheerful blue sky.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>23 June, 1996 </em>
</p><p>The telephone rang twice before someone picked it up, “Who in the hell is calling at this hour?” said a man’s voice by way of greeting.</p><p>Remus had had the dubious pleasure of meeting Vernon Dursley only once years before, but his voice was unmistakable. Remus glanced out the window, a little surprised to find the world dark. He hadn’t realized it had gotten so late while he stared at his mam’s old rotary phone and tried to find the nerve to dial.</p><p>“Oi, who’s there?” Vernon prompted, and Remus imagined his face was turning red.</p><p>“Good evening,” he said, careful to keep his tone even and polite to cover up just how much he’d relish hexing Vernon into next year for his years of mistreatment of Harry, “My name is Remus Lupin, I’m calling to speak to Harry Potter.”</p><p>Remus expected he might be shouted at or hung up on, but Vernon only went quiet and said tightly, “Hang on.” Remus did.</p><p>“Hello?” Remus smiled at the sound of Harry’s voice, his face hardly remembering how to do so.</p><p>“Harry, it’s Remus,” he said.</p><p>“Oh!” Harry said, and Remus could picture the way his eyes had widened behind his spectacles.</p><p>“Your uncle was… surprisingly cooperative just now,” Remus pointed out.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry replied, and Remus imagined he was running a hand through his wild hair or perhaps pushing his glasses up his nose, “A few Order members, Tonks, Mad-Eye, the Weasleys, were at King’s Cross a few days ago and gave Uncle Vernon a fright. Told him they’ll know if he mistreats me at all, and so on.” There was no smile in Harry’s voice.</p><p>Something like a laugh escaped Remus, “Good, we should have done so ages ago.”</p><p>Harry hummed and silence fell between them. Remus had never had a hard time conversing with Harry before, but this was different. The spectre of Sirius hung between them, making even the static that crackled over the phone line seem to constrict, “Can I ask you something, Professor?” Harry asked suddenly, and Remus could hear that the same tension he felt had bled into Harry’s voice.</p><p>“Of course,” he said. He would have corrected Harry, reminded him that he was no longer his teacher, but he couldn’t risk derailing the conversation when Harry sounded like he might want to open up about something.</p><p>“D’you ever get angry at magic?” he asked, his words fast and staccato.</p><p>“Yes,” Remus replied, honestly, “I’m a werewolf, I get angry at the magic of that rather often.”</p><p>“Sure,” Harry said, in a dismissive way that reminded Remus powerfully of James at Harry's age, single-mindedly focused on his own point, “But I’m not talking about getting angry at magic for what it does to you. I-I mean, don’t you get angry at magic for what it <em>doesn’t</em> do?”</p><p>Remus’ stomach gave a lurch of sympathy, but he only urged gently, “Like what?”</p><p>“I just, <em>what’s the point of it?</em>” raw emotion flooded Harry’s voice, “What good is it to even <em>have</em> magic if it can’t do <em>a bloody thing</em> when it actually <em>matters!?</em>” Remus opened his mouth to respond, but Harry kept going, picking up momentum and volume as he went, “What good is <em>Lumos </em>or <em>Stupefy</em> or even my bloody Patronus if they’re no good against a bloody <em>Veil!?</em> A VEIL!” a harsh humorless laugh burst out of Harry and Remus felt it like a knife in his chest, felt the absurdity of it, the rage at the finality of it, the hatred of the Veil and its mundane inexplicability.</p><p>“I know, Harry,” he said and his own voice rasped on his ears.</p><p>“No!” Harry interrupted, “No, you <em>don’t</em> know! You don’t <em>understand!</em> VOLDEMORT CAME BACK, he came back to life RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME! AND IT’S NOT BLOODY FAIR! WHY CAN <em>VOLDEMORT</em> COME BACK, BUT MY PARENTS CAN’T! — BUT CEDRIC CAN’T! — BUT <em>SIRIUS CAN’T!?</em>”</p><p>The words traveled up Remus’ spine and started mutating into something dark in the back of his skull. Something dreadful. Something <em>unthinkable.</em></p><p>“You, <em>you</em> accepted he was gone <em>right away, </em>you said it to me <em>right after he FELL</em>,” Harry drew in a breath that whistled, “I <em>know</em> death isn’t new to you, Professor, and,” here, another sharp laugh, “And it’s not new to me either, but y-you and Dumbledore and <em>everybody</em> keep acting like <em>‘dead’</em> and <em>‘gone’</em> are the same bloody thing AND THEY’RE JUST NOT! VOLDEMORT WAS DEAD, BUT NOW HE ISN’T! AND SIRIUS—” Harry’s voice buckled with tears and he added brokenly, “He’s <em>gone</em>, and no one can even <em>tell me</em> for certain if that’s even the <em>same thing</em> as dead, and— and—”</p><p>“Harry,” Remus soothed, helplessly, reminded with cruel absurdity that it had always been Sirius who had been able to soothe Harry’s squalling as a baby, even as teenage Harry’s words spiraled out through Remus' mind in dangerous fractals. What exactly did ‘gone’ even mean? He had thought Peter was gone for a dozen years, only to find that he was alive. The entire Wizarding World had thought Voldemort gone until he had returned! Why should he assume the permanence of Sirius’ death when that line was blurred, when that line was as fragile as the flutter of a Veil? Could fabric not be torn?</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Harry said, voice thick with tears and embarrassment.</p><p>“Don’t be,” Remus said instantly, despite feeling light-headed, he couldn’t give Harry the impression that the person he was leaning on was barely standing. He made an effort to put his own feelings aside, focusing instead on Harry’s indignance in the face of grief, “You made some good points.”</p><p>“You don’t have to humor me, Professor,” Harry said, defeatedly, “I sound like a stupid kid, whining about things being <em>unfair</em>,” he scoffed self-deprecatingly at himself, “As if you don’t know all about unfairness!”</p><p>“I promise I’m not humoring you, Harry,” Remus said honestly. Truthfully, Harry’s anger made more sense right now than his own thoughts, “As you say, I know unfairness quite well. That doesn’t make it easier to accept, though, I’m afraid.”</p><p>“Great,” Harry said dryly, “A lot to look forward to, then.”</p><p>Remus smiled at that, but it felt wrong on his face. Something had been planted in his mind and it was growing out of control, the dark branches of it crowding out his other thoughts, “Harry,” he asked, just as the idea came to him, “Would it be alright with you if I went to Grimmauld Place?”</p><p>“What?” Harry sounded caught off guard by the sudden apparent change of topic, “Why would I care? I mean, er, go wherever you like.”</p><p>Remus kicked himself, of course Harry wouldn’t know, “Oh, well, the thing is, well,it belongs to you now, Harry. Sirius had it in his will that you inherit it.”</p><p>“I have a house!?” Harry blurted out, “Could I go live there?”</p><p>“Er, you’d have to take that up with Dumbledore,” Remus said, hating himself for it, wishing he could just give Harry the permission to escape that he craved.</p><p>“Right,” Harry responded drearily, “So, why do you want to go there anyway?”</p><p>“I…” In truth, Remus was thinking of the Blacks’ vast collection of books, the Dark texts that no doubt held the answers he <em>should not</em> be looking for. <em>Was not</em> looking for. He couldn’t tell Harry that, “I just… well, Sirius’ things…” he trailed off, feeling his ribs tighten around his heart at the thought of Sirius’ belongings, the signs there of Sirius’ presence only days before.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, of course,” Harry said, a little awkwardly, “Well, it’s fine with me anyway. You can come and go as you please. Sirius would want that.”</p><p><em>Sirius wouldn’t want you digging through the Darkness in that library,</em> a voice in Remus’ head scolded, even as he thanked Harry politely. They spoke a few more minutes about Harry’s exams, about all the food Molly had sent Remus, about how Ginny Weasley was apparently going out with Dean Thomas. When Harry yawned, Remus remembered that it was late and bid Harry goodnight, exchanging promises to keep it touch.</p><p>Remus held the phone by his ear well after the line had gone dead. Before calling Harry, he’d eaten most of one of Molly’s pies and his stomach squirmed uncomfortably around it, the lack of food from the rest of the week threatening to make him sick over his own disturbing thoughts. Talking to Harry had been good, hearing another human being’s voice. And where Remus’ grief had shut him down, Harry’s had sparked and spat. It was catching. Remus could feel it, the fuel of it, the unsteady burn of righteous youthful indignation.</p><p>The questions that simmered in his depths had answers that were unnatural, like fire underwater or the sun rising in the west. They weren’t meant to be answered, questions about the borders and boundaries of death, questions about the soul, questions about the cost of <em>undoing</em>.</p><p>Remus hung up the phone and wondered.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>25 June, 1996</em>
</p><p>Even with Harry’s express invitation, Remus hesitated on Grimmauld Place’s doorstep, half-convinced that something foul left over from Sirius’ parents would kill him upon entry for having the gall to enter the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. In his left pocket, he held fast to Sirius’ ear — as if carrying a piece of the late heir would ensure that the house, with the bias and paranoia woven into the very cloth of its protections, might accept him — while his right hand withdrew his wand and tapped the door, disengaging its locks, both analog and magical. The door swung in slightly, with a groan.</p><p>With his heart in his throat, Remus stepped inside.</p><p>It had been under a week, and yet already Grimmauld Place had acquired the feeling of a haunted house, of some place abandoned for many long dark years. It had never exactly been an <em>inviting</em> place, but only a few days of vacancy had left it feeling distinctly like a mausoleum. Remus shut the door behind him as quietly as he could, but even so, the creak of the hinges seemed untenably loud. As the eerie blue gas-lamps came to life, Remus eyed the curtain that concealed the ill-tempered portrait of Walburga Black, but by whatever small shred of mercy the universe had left for him, she remained concealed and silent.</p><p>A shiver made the hair stand up on the back of Remus’ neck as he took a couple steps into the front hall. The shadows that clung to the corners seemed like living things, waiting for him to look away to pounce and envelop him. The old, moldering smell Molly had tried so hard to spell and scrub away had taken advantage of the Order’s absence, as if the cold and damp were trying to claim the house, trying to rot it away from within. It had always been hard for Remus to say how much of the smell was the house rotting and how much of it was the queasy scent of Dark Magic, so palpable throughout the house, but detectable only to his wolf’s nose.</p><p>It was not as quiet as Remus would have expected, the wind whistling lowly in leaded windows, the scratching scuttle of small things unseen within the damask-papered walls, the eerie drip somewhere that was probably just a faulty pipe but brought to mind images of blood. Remus had never listened so closely to the ambience of the house breathing, and realized with a feeling like a fist around his heart, that he’d simply never been able to hear it over Sirius.</p><p>Once the thought occurred to him, Sirius’ absence from the place was agony. It was a glaring <em>lack</em>, negative space in the shape of Sirius’ tall frame echoing in every room. Remus came upon the dining room and each chair seemed reserved for the memory of Sirius; here, where he’d sniped at Remus for doing Dumbledore’s bidding even though reaching out to the werewolves had been a waste of time in the first war; here, where they’d traded drinks from a bottle of Orion’s nearly hundred year old wine, not bothering with the words of the apologies they owed each other; here, where Sirius had stared glass-eyed into his teacup as if the leaves would hold an escape for him, a trick for slipping between the bars of his new-old prison. And there, by the cabinet of fine bone china, the echo of the touch-starved Sirius who had crowded him against the soot-stained wallpaper and licked into his mouth as if he believed he’d actually taste an answer there.</p><p>Remus had opened to him obligingly, as he always had, but his heart had ached with the knowledge that there was nothing eating away at Sirius that was within his power to fix.</p><p>Remus shut his eyes tight, feeling the stab of tears for the first time since the night at the Ministry. The safe numbness of shock was breaking, and he was breaking right along with it. Sirius <em>couldn’t</em> be gone, not again, not when he’d only just gotten him back. Grimmauld Place was bloody frigid without the steadily smoldering heat of Sirius, his passion, his frustration, his beautiful fucking chaos like a fire, now snuffed, cinders cooling into grey bleakness. There was a war coming, there was work to be done, but Remus could feel the pull of the bleak nothing that had consumed him back in ‘81, after losing everything.</p><p><em>“Never again, Moons,” </em>Sirius had said months before, staring at the canopy of his childhood bed, <em>“Nothing’s getting between us ever again.”</em></p><p><em>“Don’t,</em>” he’d admonished, even as he had curled closer, their bodies linking together effortlessly as they always had done in nakedness, <em>“You can’t promise something like that, Sirius.</em>”</p><p>“<em>I bloody well can, and I bloody well do,</em>” Sirius had insisted, kissing the sweat-damp hair at Remus’ temple, <em>“I feel a thousand bloody years old sometimes, and yet altogether I’ve only spent about ten of them with you, and couldn’t do this,”</em> he’d curled over Remus to reach his lips, kissed him, <em>“Half of that time anyway.”</em></p><p><em>“Yes, well, we were children, so…</em>” Remus had pointed out, though he’d heard his own voice go soft and small, and perhaps that had given away just how much safer, saner, more whole he had felt, sheltered under Sirius like that, hiding within the curtain of his hair. Or maybe Sirius had always known.</p><p>In any case, he had held him tighter, his breath hot and alive as he’d whispered out, in supplication, “<em>We just need more time. And now we’ve got it.</em>”</p><p>Remus was pulled suddenly from his thoughts when he realized with certainty that he was being watched. And not in the vague sense of eyes in the wallpaper that he’d had since entering, but a definite presence watching him. He opened his eyes, not sure when he’d closed them, not sure when he’d leaned his weight heavily on the high back of one of the carved wooden chairs. His hands were still wrapped around the ear and his wand respectively and he held onto both of them tighter, straightening his back and gripping his wand as his eyes swept the room. He saw no one at first, but the wolf’s nose zeroed in on the uncleaned smell, the lonely cold-sweat tang of solitude.</p><p>“Werewolf,” croaked a voice like a bullfrog’s. Remus cast his gaze a little lower, realizing already who he would find.</p><p>“Hello, Kreacher,” he greeted in as genial a tone as he could muster. He’d always felt sympathy, or perhaps it was nearer to pity, for the House-Elf. A creature, like himself, that wizards saw as beneath them, who had been brainwashed and bent to the will of the family he’d been bound to serve since birth. He had understood Sirius’ reproach for the Elf, too, and for the first time he very nearly shared it. <em>You killed him</em>, he thought, and felt his magic crackle at the thought. Kreacher’s watery grey eyes widened, feeling the spike in Remus’ energy. It was a sick joke that his eyes so resembled the full moon.</p><p>“Hello, Master Remus,” Kreacher said and from his expression, Remus had to assume that addressing him as Sirius had instructed was causing the Elf physical distress, “Kreacher did not expect to see Master Remus again in his Mistress’ house.”</p><p>“Well, here I am,” Remus stated plainly, adding on second thought, “I won’t get in your way.”</p><p>Kreacher’s eyes narrowed and he muttered to himself, “<em>Why is Master Sirius’ dirty werewolf here? What is it after?”</em></p><p>“I’ll be in the library,” Remus said, and hurried past the Elf before he lost his head. Kreacher had as good as killed Sirius, it was true, but Remus reminded himself that he couldn’t entirely blame Kreacher. As he moved quickly and single-mindedly through the dark corridors with their high ceilings sagging and the portraits along the walls watching in venomous silence, he tried to remind himself of all the years that Sirius and Kreacher had both been prisoners here, held by different chains. He reminded himself of the vitriol and abuse they had heaped on each other’s shoulders, and of Kreacher’s senility and limited agency.</p><p>None of it made it any easier to forgive.</p><p>Reaching the library was cold comfort, even if it was one of his favorite (or rather, least hated) parts of the house. It was drier than the rest of Grimmauld Place, more than likely as the result of some charm meant to protect the collection of books. And what a collection it was. Dark wood shelves gleamed even through the layer of dust they’d gathered, teeming with more books than he could read in a lifetime. There were more than books, there were cabinets with neat little cubbies filled with old scrolls, a couple of grandiose sets of tables and chairs, curio cabinets along one wall that housed various specimens in bell jars and Dark artifacts they had not dared disturb when they’d cleaned out Grimmauld Place for the Order. Remus’ gaze scanned the cabinet, idly searching for disembodied ears.</p><p>In his pocket, Sirius’ ear had been held so consistently in his hand that it had grown warm, so warm it very nearly felt alive. <em>The line is fine</em>, he thought, he hoped. Remus knew from the couple of times that he had visited this room in the past that the shelves were organized in no way that made much sense to him, and he wasn’t entirely sure what it was he was looking for. He stowed his wand in his sleeve, the familiar line of it along the strong blue vein there, pulsing life against it, product of his body’s stubborn survival. He perused the titles, spindly text fading on the spines of the books, and let himself disappear into the safe detached mind-space of research, that for him had so often offered an escape.</p>
