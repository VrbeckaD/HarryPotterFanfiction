<li>Sitting in an empty classroom with an unopened bottle between her knees and her head hanging low</li>
<li>That’s how he finds her</li>
<li>That’s where he knew she would be after all this time</li>
<li>After all the space</li>
<li>Her eyes are catatonic</li>
<li>But her lips are spice</li>
<li>All teeth and tongue and clashing against him suddenly</li>
<li>There’s nothing supple or soft left inside her </li>
<li>She’s become greedy and angry and her hands don’t feel the same</li>
<li>They’re tearing at him</li>
<li>Her nails digging into exposed skin</li>
<li><em>Andy</em></li>
<li>It’s what he’s saying</li>
<li>What he’s breathing into her mouth</li>
<li>But he doesn’t know if he actually wants her to</li>
<li>Or if he can pull away</li>
<li>They haven’t been like this in months</li>
<li>Haven’t held each other in months</li>
<li>He’s never met anyone more intoxicating than her</li>
<li>Like a drug</li>
<li>More like a weapon</li>
<li>Something that keeps him tied up and pinned down and never able to move</li>
<li>He needs her to be the one</li>
<li>Because he can’t be back here, not again</li>
<li>Can’t let himself get lost in this </li>
<li>She ripped his heart from his chest</li>
<li>Spit hate and laughed</li>
<li><em>Stop following me like a mongrel</em></li>
<li><em>There’s nothing for you here</em></li>
<li>He’d never seen her be the heiress she was born to be until then</li>
<li>Dark and sunken</li>
<li>And even though he knew it was a show</li>
<li>For Bella, for Cissa</li>
<li>For the Lestranges and Averys and Dolohovs standing with prying eyes</li>
<li>It hurt</li>
<li>He didn’t know how true it was that when his friends told him girls like her could destroy you</li>
<li>She had nearly</li>
<li>Just as she seemed to be destroying herself</li>
<li>That mask he slipped under crawled back into place the moment the words slipped from his lips and she didn’t say them back</li>
<li>She became what they wanted her to be</li>
<li><em>Andy please</em></li>
<li>She pauses</li>
<li>Her grip tightening</li>
<li><em>Why can’t you just let this go Ted?</em></li>
<li><em>One time</em></li>
<li><em>Please?</em></li>
<li>She’s breathless</li>
<li>And he can still feel where her teeth and tongue had been on him moments before</li>
<li>Ravishing him like some prize</li>
<li>Something you keep on your mantle to fondly remember</li>
<li>She was pushing the remnants of what she had been with him inside of him </li>
<li>That way she would never be <b>Andy </b>again</li>
<li>She could just be Andromeda Black</li>
<li>… or Rosier or Dolohov or Lestrange</li>
<li>She could produce heirs </li>
<li>Keep her mother’s hands off her throat and her father’s cold stare away from prickling her skin</li>
<li>In another time he knows he could give in for that</li>
<li>To let her have what she thinks she so desperately wants but won’t ever need</li>
<li>Let the whims of the beautiful girl with the beautiful eyes have everything </li>
<li><b>But</b></li>
<li><em>I can’t do this</em></li>
<li><em>I don’t want this… not like this</em></li>
<li>Everything good and wonderful and so very Andy has been bottled up inside her</li>
<li>She pulls back</li>
<li>Once they had so comfortably melded together</li>
<li>Fingers intertwined, bodies flush, lips brushing against skin</li>
<li>He had barely even mapped the planes of her ribs and the freckles on her shoulders before she was gone</li>
<li>She pulls back</li>
<li><em>Why can’t you just let this be?</em></li>
<li>His eyebrows pull together</li>
<li><em>Isn’t it simple?</em></li>
<li>He can see the look in her eyes begging him not to say it again</li>
<li><em>Because I love you</em></li>
<li>Her back is to him now</li>
<li>Her shoulders locked</li>
<li><em>I love you Andy</em></li>
<li><em>I don’t want you just one more time<br/></em></li>
<li>She rolls her shoulders back</li>
<li>Because not now</li>
<li>Not today</li>
<li>She turns to face him</li>
<li>The walls beneath her skin climbing higher and higher</li>
<li>She knows she can be mean, lethal</li>
<li>Her mother’s daughter</li>
<li>She has to turn everything to ash now</li>
<li>She has to stop the ache that has shredded the inside of her since the day she saw him</li>
<li>She boxes them up neat and tidy in the traps and folds of her mind</li>
<li>
<em>Here lies Edward Tonks, </em>the box will read</li>
<li><em>Lost love, forever unrequited</em></li>
<li>Even if it is a lie</li>
<li>Even if the feeling of his hand wrapped around her wrist right now may kill her</li>
<li><em>This was a mistake</em></li>
<li><em>We were …</em></li>
<li><em>We are a mistake</em></li>
<li>She can hear how thickly he swallows</li>
<li>She can’t bear to tear her eyes from him</li>
<li>She knows if she does the contents of her stomach will spill all over the floor</li>
<li>He can never know</li>
<li>Not how much she regrets him tearing his hand from her wrist</li>
<li>Or how prepared she was to drown the bottle that was between her knees as he left</li>
<li>Because no</li>
<li>It will not read <em>Here lies Edward Tonks</em>
</li>
<li>It will say</li>
<li><em>Here lies Andromeda Black</em></li>
<li><em>Endless gaping black hole</em></li>
<li><em>A true Black<br/></em></li>
<li><em>Destined to spend her life in the alternate universe in her mind</em></li>
