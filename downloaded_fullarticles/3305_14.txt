    <p>You know that trope in those cheesy muggle teen novels. The one where the shy nerdy girl has a crush on the most popular boy, now switch girl with boy and you’ve got Draco Malfoy’s life right now.</p><p>It’s not his fault these thoughts are in his mind, Stupid Padma has forced him to read those stupid teen romance books.</p><p>See you must be confused. Probably thinking “Your a Slytherin, why’d you even read MUGGLE literature?”</p><p>Well dear reader because he isn’t one! Draco Malfoy the heir to the Malfoy fortune is a Ravenclaw and he is downright proud to be one.</p><p>Being a Slytherin puts him in to much difficult and awkward situations and a lot of responsibility, he’s more happy to be a Background Ravenclaw, Thank you very much. Don’t worry about him though, Lucius was fickle about it but he got over it. Better a Ravenclaw than a Gryffindor.</p><p>As a Ravenclaw he’s allowed to be his nerdy, shy, awkward self without the responsibility of Blood-Purity (*eye roll*) and other Pure blood Propaganda.</p><p>Anyway that wasn’t the huge issue in Draco’s 16 year old life .....what was he even on about?</p><p>Oh Yeah!! Stupid Padma.</p><p>The half of a twin had practically hounded Draco till he read this “groovy” (a muggle slang she picked up,) book she’s been reading and Draco being the book worm he was relented, but as he read on and on, it felt more like his life story than just a book.</p><p>He related to this book too much, he began wondering if the author had stole his secret diary. Maybe it was a wake up call from the girl.</p><p>The thing was that he Draconis Lucius Malfoy was badly and incredibly in love with Harry Potter.</p><p>Yes that Harry Potter, Son of the Head Auror James Potter, Youngest Seeker in Centuries, Captain of the Gryffindor and the most popular boy in Hogwarts.</p><p>**Collective Gasp**</p><p>I know, how original. He was probably just one of the hundred wizard or witch infatuated with the Quidditch Player but he had less of a chance than everyone else in the world.</p><p>The saddest part was that he’d been carrying a flame for the Seeker since 1st year.</p><p>He was just that skinny, far to blonde, pointy-faced boy who spent half his time with his nose buried into a brick of a book. He was shy and awkward and spent most his time avoiding social situations, if he actually ever popped up in your radar your most likely in the darkest, most depressing part of the library.</p><p>Why’d the Seeker even give Draco more than a double look. When he had the likes of Ginny Weasley or Cedric Diggory in his bed.</p><p>Or the worst, Marietta Edgecombe.</p><p>He still remembers how absolutely heart broken he was when he’d caught Harry snogging the wench under some stupid mistletoe, all the way back in 3rd year but it still hurt.</p><p>The girl had had it in for Draco ever since he replaced Cho Chang as seeker, even though Cho had told him specifically that she was cool with it. But now Draco thought about it, it was probably long before that.</p><p>The girl just couldn’t stand him.</p><p>Knowing about Draco’s crush on Harry Potter the girl had “mistakenly” made sure Draco overheard that Harry had asked Cho Chang to the Yule back in 4th year even though Cho told him that she accepted Cedric Diggory’s invitation instead.</p><p>At least Harry had gone as friends with Ginny Weasley. Draco remembers this as he had ended up going with Anthony Goldstein, as friends of course.</p><p>Draco flung the teen novel at the other side of his bed as he flopped down onto his head burying his head into his satin blue pillows.</p><p>‘So much for morning reading,’ he thought to himself, he’d woken up earlier than usual and had decided to read to wake himself up. Man, did he regret that. All he’d done was reminisce on his stupid star-struck crush.</p><p>“Stupid Padma.” He’d mumbled for the hundredth time as he swung his legs out of his bed, careful not wake his dorm mates but those three could sleep through a war. He stealthily entered the bathroom hoping to get ready by himself.</p><p>After half an hour, he was done. A quick Tempus charm proved that he was still earlier than most. The only one of his dorm mates up was Anthony who’d mumbled a sleep drowned “Morning.”</p><p>He smiled at the boy before summoning his book bag and making his way out. To no surprise at all, one of the only people in the common room was his closest friend Luna Lovegood.</p><p>He didn’t even looked shocked at her outfit, odd glasses, colorful necklaces and more queer objects, he’d always admired her creativity to the Hogwarts mandatory uniform.</p><p>Even going as far to follow in her footsteps by wearing the buttons she’d gifted on his jumper.</p><p>He’d donned the giant bright blue button that had “Happily married to a book.” In bright yellow, Luna hadn’t given it but Padma had after learning of Draco’s button obsession. He hadn’t found it funny but still wore it proudly.</p><p>It stood out distracting you from his prefect's badge, but he didn’t mind.</p><p>The blonde girl smiled up at him after looking up from whatever tabloid she’d been reading.</p><p>“Did the Nobranks wake you too?” She questioned with that dreamy look in her eyes, he only nodded, known her to long to question her statement, “They are very frequent these days, Quibbler?”</p><p>She offered her magazine, Draco accepted it politely but stuffed it in a compartment he’d specifically expanded to house the oddity of a news outlet Luna had offered her.</p><p>“Breakfast?” He questioned making his way to common room, the equally pale girl happily followed him, as they made their way down Luna prattled on about “Nargles” “Snorcarks” and more not real creatures but Draco will be damned if he told her that.</p><p>They made a beeline for their claimed spot on the Ravenclaw table, it was far enough from others and gave them their privacy. Also perfect view of the Gryffindor table but that doesn’t matter.</p><p>He pulled out books and started studying for the fun of it. He’s a nerd sue him.</p><p>“We should have a picnic?” Luna thought out randomly, Draco look up from his Arithmancy book and smiled at her agreeing.</p><p>“Sounds fun but when?” He asked knowing that you must be specific when making plans with Luna or you’ll find yourself having a Picnic in the middle of thunderstorms on a Wednesday evening.</p><p>“How about this Thursday afternoon?” Luna questioned as she spread butter AND peanut butter on her toast, Draco scrunched his nose at this. Theres only so much of Luna’s oddities Draco could take.</p><p>“Sure, I’ll check if I’m busy.” He answered but a chuckle got his attention turning to his side he saw his other friend, a now fully awake Anthony Goldstein. He dumped himself by Draco and stole his toast.</p><p>“What’s funny?” He wondered, a pout making a way to his pale face.</p><p>“Oh, just wondering when you’ve ever been “busy”.” He joked adding finger quotes to prove more of his point. Draco’s pout increased more.</p><p>“Not true, I do lots of stuff,” he defended himself as his mind racked for reasons he could be busy, “there’s my study club on Wednesday...em..Quidditch...Prefect meetings..erm...”</p><p>Anthony rolled his eyes like his point was proven.</p><p>“I’ll go to.” Anthony ignoring a thinking Draco, adding himself to his and Luna’s outing without permission.</p><p>“Go where?” A sleep drowned voice joined them, the last person in their little group Padma Patil finally joined them. Her tie was badly tied proving she’d just woken up, Draco flicked his wand and happily fixed it for her, earning an appreciated smile.</p><p>“We’re going on a Picnic on Thursday!” Luna exclaimed happily as she dipped her scone in her orange juice.</p><p>Seriously who raised this girl!</p><p>“I’ll go!!” Padma joining herself happily also stealing Draco’s toast. Bastards all of them, Draco seethed at them as he drank his tea.</p><p>10 minutes passed full of simple conversation and stories.</p><p>“And Lisa found her quill in her dorm after blaming me, the wenc-”</p><p>“Oh no,” Anthony spoke cutting off Padma, after looking at the Great Halls door, “Draco’s last 3 brain cells about to leave us in 5..4..3..”</p><p>“What are you on abou-” Draco looked up from his Transfiguration Essay but stopped talking once he saw what Anthony was looking at.</p><p>Harry Potter.</p><p>Laughing with the famous golden trio, handsome tanned face glowed with happiness, shiny green eyes twinkled with entertainment as the Weasley boy told some story.</p><p>Draco wondered if his messy dark hair would be as soft if he ran his hands through it or if his tanned skin really was as smooth as it looked under the soft candle glow or how his muscled body (he knew it was muscled from accidentally witnessing the Gryffindor Quidditch training sessions.) felt against his smaller one as Harry thrus-</p><p>He grabbed the first cool liquid (Luna’s orange juice.) he felt out and took a massive gulp to cease his thirst.</p><p>“Well there goes the chance of having any intelligent conversation,” Anthony sounded annoyed but he was really more entertained by the clear blush on his friends face, Padma had a knowing smirk even Luna had a teasing smile. “Ok there buddy?”</p><p>“I need to go...study!” Draco excused himself abruptly as he began to pack, face getting redder at the moment.</p><p>“Want a companion?” Padma questioned more than happy to fluster the boy more, “or are you to busy riding Potter’s “broom” to care?”</p><p>At this comment, Draco’s face had morphed into beet red as he decided to gather the parchment and books that he couldn’t stuff in his bag in his hands as he tried to get away from his group, who laughed more when he stumbled on his step.</p><p>Unknown to him a pair of green eyes followed his every movement.</p><p> </p><p align="center">~~~•~~~</p><p><br/>Harry stared at beautiful blonde boy that had haunted his dreams for...god knows how long. His porcelain skin, that slender figure, those big beautiful grey eyes, his brightly blonde hair.</p><p>Absolutely stunning.</p><p>“It’ll make more sense to just talk to him, you know,” a voice advised pulling Harry out of his thoughts as the boy he was observing walked out the hall and away from him.</p><p>He turned to Hermione giving her a look as if she’d just said the dumbest thing in the world. She just ignored him and continued doing her work, not even bothering to look up already knowing what Harry was doing.</p><p>“He’s really nice, a bit shy at times but it makes him even more cute than he already is.” She smirked when Harry growled when she’d called the blonde 'cute'. He’s practically proving her point.</p><p>“Is this about that Ravenclaw again?” Ron groaned as he ate his mountain of a breakfast, Hermione nodded to her boyfriend sadly.</p><p>Ron gave Harry a disappointed look before sighing, “He’s not gonna come to you, far to shy for that, he barely speaks up in prefect meetings. The only reason I know he can talk is when he answers questions in class.”</p><p>Harry knew all that, he knew a lot about Draco Malfoy, how he likes his tea? Who hangs out with? His class schedule? A lot of things.</p><p>But he wasn’t a stalker though (Shut up Ron!) just happened to come across this information when he just coincidentally happened to be always around Draco. He couldn’t help it the boy was to beautiful for his own good but what pissed Harry off was that he didn’t even know it.</p><p>The boy was far too timid and hid not aware of the looks god had blessed him with.</p><p>But it wasn’t only his looks that gathered Harry’s attention, it helped but wasn’t the reason. He was incredibly kind if the fact he spent every Wednesday tutoring younger years meant anything and was highly intelligent.</p><p>He wasn’t sure when he’d been infatuated by the blonde but he believes it started in Second year.</p><p>
  <em>Being 12 he was at the age where most boys were permitted to go to important Ministry events and much to his disdain his parents had forced him to attend. He was bored out of his mind, all these snobbish Purebloods annoyed him to no end.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>If another girl asked for a dance or batted eyelashes at him, he was gonna puke. His mum and Dad had gone off to greet random guest. His uncles had disappeared but Harry had bit of an idea what they were doing but he didn’t really want to think about that. He twirled his flute of sparkling cider with barely hidden boredom.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>When he’d badly wished for the Weasleys or any source of entertainment, that’s when he saw him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A boy about his age not far from him also having a bored face on, but at least he had a book to accommodate his time. He was an absolute rarity.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Pale white hair glowed under the crystal chandeliers his white bangs gathered around his eye, a pale finger came to brush it from his face and tuck it behind his ear. Showing huge beautiful grey eyes that roved over the lines of his book. Harry automatically stood to approach the boy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Noticing his footsteps on the tiled floor the boy looked up and Harry was blown away. The guy was all pale, white lashes, white eyebrows, perfectly pale. His pretty face widened in surprise once he noticed Harry, previously pale face reddened in seconds adding color to him. Harry liked how that looked on the boy.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was cute.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry had only began puberty so he wasn’t really sure what these feelings where but his stomach turned fluttery looking at the boy. He just had to impress him, he had to. Harry messed his hair up for good luck and opened his mouth to talk but couldn’t even get a word in before he was immediately interrupted.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Dragon, I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” a female voice gushed and a woman ran past Harry and began to hold the boys face in her perfectly manicured hand.s She fixed and preened him even though he was perfect before. Dragon (Harry would address him as that till he got his real name.) turned redder as she continued, “Why are you tucked away here like this? I told you to gel your hair, it’s all messy now! You should interact to with the other kids...”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Mother..” Dragon whined silently as he tried to get her hands away from his hair, wide grey eyes drifting to Harry who was frozen in spot, “You’re embarrassing me.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The woman turned to Harry getting what Dragon was indicating to, the woman was a copy of Dragon. Blonde hair (her own not as pale), grey eyes and pretty face. She wore expensive emerald green witch robes that complimented her figure.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Once she caught sight of Harry, her eyes widened in realization. A small but noticeable smirk spread on her ruby red lips. Turning to Dragon who looked like he wanted to die where he stood.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I see...” Harry did not know what she saw, turning to her son she grabbed his much smaller pale hand and turned to him solemn, “Well Dragon, but we must go now, say goodbye to your friend.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She began to drag the boy away and as the blonde boy turned to give Harry one more fleeting look, Harry held back every instinct to chase after the boy. He’d let him go physically but his green eyes had followed the boy till him and his mother met up with a similar pale blonde haired man and they grabbed onto each other and they Disapparated.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry never got over those huge grey eyes that gave him one last look. Let’s just say he’d been quite depressed and mopey all the way till school began two weeks later.</em>
</p><p>****</p><p>It was clear it was fate when Harry saw him again on the Platform 9 3/4. How had such an interesting person schooled with him for a year and had he not noticed. But in his defense he’d had an interesting 1st year.</p><p>Harry has not been one to give up and sniffed out information about the boy.</p><p>In a matter of two weeks he’d had a handful of facts about the boy, his name was Draconis Malfoy but was called Draco. He was in Harry’s year and a Ravenclaw. He was most times second highest in grades in his year. (He beat Hermione sometimes.)</p><p>He was surprised that such a pure looking boy was a Malfoy but it kinda made sense, he had the physical traits.</p><p>He’d met Lucius Malfoy once and let’s just say he didn’t like the dark wizard very much.</p><p>But no, Draco was nothing like his father, he was kind, sweet, incredibly smart (I mean he was Hermione rival when it came to grades, for Merlin sake), he was the Seeker for Ravenclaw and etc.</p><p>How a vile snake like Lucius had made something as precious and sweet like Draco, Harry wasn’t sure</p><p>But that wasn’t the problem. See the issue was that...Harry hadn’t ever talked to Draco properly, his friends having more interaction with the blonde.</p><p>Hermione and Draco had been partnered numerous time for the Advanced classes they took together and sometimes had “Study Dates” in the library (something Harry and Ron weren’t invited too as their work was far to advanced for them.)</p><p>Ron sometimes sat next to Draco at Prefect meetings or ran into the other during patrols.</p><p>Still, more than Harry had done in the 5 years of having feelings for the blonde.</p><p>He’d tried, he really have but every time he mustered the strength to talk to the boy it disappeared once he caught sight of him basking in the sun pale skin glowing, playing with strand of pure white hair as he read some advanced book, it seemed his brain screamed “ABORT! ABORT!”</p><p>It doesn’t matter what his family says, crushes are difficult.</p><p>“I know but every time I want to talk to him I... you know,” Harry struggled to explain trying to use his hands to explain by turning them in a rolling manner, “doing word’s difficult .” He settled for.</p><p>‘Why’d he even go for me.’ He found himself wondering.</p><p>He’s this beautiful genius who deserves some posh fancy pure blood that can recite poetry to him in like twenty languages while playing Mozart on the Violin. Not some clumsy Quidditch player who barely passes most classes.<br/> <br/>A small hand touched his bicep and he turned to see Hermione’s sad chocolate eyes looking at him, the dark-skinned girl gave him a sad smile.</p><p>He knew what she was thinking, she’d been hounding him to ask Draco to the Yule Ball that was three weeks from now.</p><p>“Talk to him.” She stated simply before making her way out the Great hall. Harry followed her retreating form before slamming his head on the table in frustration, she says it like its easy.</p><p>Ron gave him a curious look.</p><p>Quickly swallowing the breakfast stuffed in his face he placed a comforting hand on his back awkwardly. Ron wasn’t very good at comforting people.</p><p>“Good luck, mate.” Simple wording for a simple person.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry turned his head to him and gave him a slight nod before returning to sulking into the table wood.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p>
