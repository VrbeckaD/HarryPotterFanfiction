  <em> <strong>The Pack Survives</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>JON  I</p><p> </p><p>Sneaking out of Winterfell and into the Wolfswood has become easier in the last few months – it was required, after all, to protect two of the greatest secrets of the North; <em>dragons</em>.</p><p>Months ago, Jon Snow – <em>Jaehaerys Targaryen</em> – had helped rediscover the hidden vault of Cregan Stark, filled with treasures and gold the historical Stark Lord had, according to his personal journals, collected as recompense for the broken Pact of Ice and Fire, then later added to after the Hour of the Wolf as rewards from Aegon the Third. Separate from the Winter Fund, Cregan’s Vault had been steadily added to over the following generations of Lord Starks, up until the death of Lord Rickard Stark and his Heir, leaving the unprepared second son to take the Lordship he had not been trained for.</p><p>But it hadn’t been the treasures that had captured Jon’s attention – that honour had fallen to the collection of dragon eggs, five of them; one of which, silver and white, had drawn him in.</p><p>And with the hatching of his dragon, Jon had learned the truth.</p><p>He hadn’t spoken to his <em>uncle</em> since; not beyond simple, short answers, awkward greetings, and stilted ‘<em>Lord Stark</em>’s.</p><p>As he plods closer and closer to the cave network where the dragons have been sequestered away, Jon can feel his connection to Spirit growing stronger, her excitement thrumming through him like the thunder and starbursts.</p><p>Within moments, the sound of a dragon bouncing through the layers of snow reaches his ears, and Jon can’t quite fight the smile that grows at the sight of his dragon leaping towards him with a happy growl. Now the size of a large hound, Spirit bowls him over as she connects with his chest, sending man and dragon sprawling into the snow.</p><p>With a chuckle, Jon sits up, allowing the happy reptile to curl over his lap and chatter as his hands skim over pale scales to scratch under her jaw.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CATELYN  I</p><p> </p><p>The weight of the falcon lies heavy across her arm as she crouches before her daughters, and Catelyn Stark smiles at the sight of the identical expressions of excitement on the faces of her beloved girls, so different and yet so similar at the same time.</p><p>The bird on her hand is small, young, and bred specifically so that she could teach her daughters the art of falconry, a gift from their grandfather after Catelyn had written to the Lord Tully of her intentions to take control of Sansa and Aryas’ lessons.</p><p>“Falconry is a sport of Ladies.” Catelyn tells them, “Men may hunt, but Ladies train falcons to catch game for us. This is a hybrid gyrfalcon, a young one; your grandfather spent quite some time trying to find a pure gyrfalcon to breed with one of his personal falcons – they’re native of the North, but falconry isn’t practised among Northern ladies as much as it is by those in the South.”</p><p>“Why is that, mother?” Sweet Sansa asks, eyes on the magnificent white and gray bird.</p><p>“Because Northerners <em>hunt</em>.” Arya scoffs, but Catelyn can see the child-like eagerness her youngest daughter tries to hide.</p><p>“Northerners are a practical people.” Catelyn explains, “You’ll find that many prefer to hunt because it doesn’t take as long. Falconry requires the patience to teach and raise a falcon from a young age, with the right training, a falcon can hunt and catch small game.” As her daughters stare at the young bird, Catelyn glances upwards, her blue eyes meeting her husband’s gray as he watches them fondly. “This falcon is yours; you will train it together.”</p><p>Sansa eyes the bird with wide blue eyes, “Can we name it?”</p><p>Catelyn laughs, “Of course, but you have to agree on the name.”</p><p>“It can’t be anything stupid!” Arya cuts off her sister’s response, “You’d probably name it something silly like <em>Princess</em> or something.”</p><p>Sansa bristles at her sister’s words, “Well you’d give it some barbaric name if you could!”</p><p>“<em>Girls</em>.” Catelyn cuts off the heated words, “Our falconry lessons won’t start today, you will have until the following week to agree on a name, if not, you will be proving to me that you aren’t mature enough to handle these lessons.”</p><p>Both girls lower their heads, properly scolded, and Catelyn stands.</p><p>“This one is too young to begin learning just yet.” She assures them, “I’m sure that you can find a name that will fit both your criteria.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>EDDARD  I</p><p> </p><p>Ned looks up from the documents and letters scattered around him as he turns to stare out the windows of his solar, just on time to see the small figure of his nephew plod through the courtyard like a darkly-clad ghost. For a moment, the Lord of Winterfell can swear he sees the faintest image of another figure following the lad, garbed in white and red with long dark hair, but he blinks and the figure has vanished on the wind, leaving Ned to question if it was ever there.</p><p>A sharp rap on his solar door drags his gaze away from Jon’s figure.</p><p>“Enter.”</p><p>A head of thick black curls peers around his door, Lannister-green eyes studying him intently as the Baratheon Princess slips into the chamber and curtsies respectfully. “You wished to see me, Lord Stark?”</p><p>Ned smiles warmly at his future gooddaughter, “Princess – come in. Take a seat.” He tells her, and the young lady returns his smile and claims the chair across from his desk, sinking into it and arranging her blue skirts around her. “It’s almost your name day,” The Lord starts, and she nods quietly. “The King has requested that your marriage to Robb be held within the fortnight following the celebrations.” Princess Helaine sighs quietly, “The royal party has just left the capital and is expected to arrive within the next month.”</p><p>“I suppose I should have expected that.” Helaine murmurs.</p><p>“Are the dragons going to be safe staying in the Wolfswood?” Ned asks, and the dark haired princess hums thoughtfully.</p><p>“Jörmungandr is quite happy to stay in the caves; he enjoys exploring – and I believe I can convince him to move deeper in so that he can stay out of sight.” She tells him, “Though I, <em>personally</em>, can’t promise anything in terms to Spirit. That would be up to Jon.” Ned sighs, and he earns a sympathetic smile from the princess in response. “Can you blame him for being angry, Lord Stark? Everything he thought he knew was a lie.”</p><p>“I can’t.” Ned replies, “All those times he came to me, asking who his mother was – I had every chance to tell him then...”</p><p>Unfathomable emerald eyes study him, “Why didn’t you?”</p><p>“I didn’t want to loose him.” He admits under her gaze. “Is it selfish of me to love him as if he were mine own son? When he had two – three including Princess Elia – parents who had wanted him desperately.”</p><p>“Lord Stark – if I may be blunt – he <em>is</em> your son.” Helaine tells him, gently taking his larger hand in her own. “<em>You</em> raised him. <em>Your</em> love is the <em>only</em> love of a parent that he knows. It’s <em>you</em> that he models himself after, and it’s <em>you</em> that he looks to for support.” Ned blinks, looking up to meet her passionate gaze and kind smile, “He loves <em>you</em>. But a lifetime of lies is hard to forgive and forget. Trust me.” She smiles sadly, “<em>Talk</em> to him, tell him the full story. He deserves that much.”</p>
