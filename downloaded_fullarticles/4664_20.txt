  <span class="s1">Newt almost felt bad, doing what he had done. But the poor little thing had been so terrified, it was bound to hurt itself if he didn’t do something.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Newt had come to MACUSA to the sight of internal turmoil. Aurors and staff were running every which way, bug-eyed and panicked, and the Magizoologist thought surely Grindelwald had escaped based off their expressions only to freeze at the sight of a little bundle of fur blazing down the hallway in big, romping bounds for such a small body — a whole gaggle of worrying Aurors chasing it.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">It was a Muggle creature; non-magical but exotic nonetheless. Big paws attached to a chubby little body of russet fur and black stripes, all trailed by a big, bushy tail. It’s small black eyes round with panic as it quacked worriedly, shrieking all the way down the hall. It took a corner, sharp, and a couple of Aurors plowed into a wall while two others tangled up in each other and fell.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Newt!” Tina called as she rounded the corner, pointing at the red panda running his way, “Catch him!”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Newt took a step forward, only for the little creature to backpedal comically and turn tail down another hallway. He heard Tina curse, but all Newt could focus on was the terror in the poor dear’s eyes. Without another thought, he reached into his coat pocket to retrieve a small gun. He aimed, his hand still despite his generally clumsy nature, and fired once.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Down the hall, the little creature squeaked. It tumbled into a chubby little roll before contorting into quite a silly position to look at the dart sticking in its butt. </span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Newt!” Tina shouted, shocked as she ran for him. “You shot him!”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">He didn’t answer right away. Instead, he hurried forward to gather the little bundle of anxiety into his arms. Even now, the sedative was beginning to work. It had been mild — nothing to knock the little dear out completely — but enough to make him pliant. Its eyes blinked furiously, as though fighting the growing haze of bliss and sleepiness, as drowsiness made it sluggish and calm. It curled into Newt’s arms, snuffled softly at his neck, before finally settling its little fuzzy chin upon his shoulder and sighing — its heart rate slowly calming against his palm.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Ssh, ssh, ssh,” Newt murmured, “Mummy’s got you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Newt,” Tina said as she finally caught up, her worry ceasing as she caught sight of the calm little creature. “What did you…?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“A mild sedative,” Newt supplied, “This is hardly the first time I’ve had to subdue a frightened creature. They’re more likely to hurt themselves running than anything else, so this is the easiest way to help. How did he get in here? This is a Muggle animal.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Tina nodded, catching her breath, before sweeping her hair back and gesturing theatrically, “Newt Scamander, meet the real Percival Graves,” she sighed, exhausted. “We finally found him.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Newt swallowed as the implications fell heavily upon him.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Oh god, he had drugged <em>the real Director of Magical Security.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“Is he a… understanding sort of fellow?”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Tina snorted.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">“I guess you’re going to find out.”</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">In his arms, Graves yawned cutely before burbling happily and nuzzling closer.</span>
</p><p class="p1" align="justify">
  <span class="s1">Merlin’s balls, what the hell was wrong with America? It was nonstop chaos. </span>
