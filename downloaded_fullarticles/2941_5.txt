    <p><strong>Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock</strong><br/>
   My train of thought was interuped by my irritating clock, I glanced at it for just a moment and realised that I was late! 5:30! I needed to be their by 5:00. Running up the stairs from the living room, I quickly grabbed my two suitcases. Stopping for only a second to look in the mirror, I was a passable mess, I kept running. Finally making my way to the fireplace, I grabbed a bit of floo powder and said my destanation loud and clear, "Dumbledore's office!".</p><p>   The green flames appeared and grabbed me. Bringing me to the headmasters office rather quickly. As soon as I felt my feet plant firmly on the ground I ducked down slightly and made my way out of the fire place. Coughing I looked around for Dumbledore. '<em>Of course he's not here you are late! Again!</em>'. Taking one last look I sighed, then felt a tap on my shoulder. Jumping quite a bit I turned "Oh Dumbledore it's just you!".</p><p>   He laughed, then walked me over to his desk, "I am sure you have no idea why I brought you here." "Well yes and no.. one thing is that you are probably going to talk to me about the next defence teacher and well that's as far as I got." Sinking into the chair slightly I let him explain. "Spot on y/n! That is exactly why you are here! The new Defence Against the Dark arts teacher is deffinetly someone you know!" I pondered what he said for a moment '<em>Someone I know? Most of my friends are dead or well.... poor alice.</em>' I think he knew I had gotten into my more morbid thoughts as he continued to talk, "Well thats it y/n, if you need anything you know where to find me. Oh and I suggest you go set up your classroom, beginning of term banquet starts in an hour." And with that I was curious as to what was in store.</p>
