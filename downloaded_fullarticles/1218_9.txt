    <p>
  <span>Hermione was hot. The young woman didn’t know what else to feel in this exact moment. She was currently in the middle of some club in Las Vegas. It was Draco and Harry’s wedding week and Ron thought it would be a great idea for everyone invited, to spend the grooms’ final bachelor weekend in the city of sin. Hermione was reluctant to say the least. From the stories she’s heard from coworkers and movies she’s seen, the bright and cautious lawyer knew that nothing good ever came from trips here. The young woman was currently nursing a dirty martini at the bar while watching over the dance floor. She smiled as her sights landed on the blonde haired best friend of hers. Draco was never the best dancer outside of ballroom customs he grew up learning due to family background, so it was always a sight to see whenever he did try. He was currently shaking his hips alongside a ginger haired girl, who was at least doing a better job at dancing than the boy was. Ginny Weasley, or Ginevra, although she hates how old it sounds, was another good friend of Hermione and like another sister to Draco. She was in fact the actual sister to Ronald Weasley, the einstein behind this adventure and bestfriend to Harry Potter, the other groom. The trio were inseparable since childhood when they all met during  the first annual meeting of the slug club at their school for a select few top students. Their teacher, aptly named, Dr. Slughorn had been insufferable but the friends knew he meant no harm and would indulge the eccentric old man with their wild antics during the meetings. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Chuckling as the dancing pair now approached her, Hermione decided to down the rest of her drink and order a water for her two friends. She clearly wasn’t the only one who felt like they were on fire if the sheens of sweat on the other two were anything to go by. Draco was the first to meet her, clumsily sitting on the stool to her left while Ginny took the other to her right. Realising too late what just silently happened, Hermione tensed. “NO.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Thanking the bartender for their drinks, Ginny turns to the girl “No?! Mione! What’s the point of coming to the club then if you won’t dance?” Her voice was raspy, all that dancing without much drinking in between left her dehydrated. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You both know it was either here or going with Harry’s group to the male strip club or staying with our parents. This was literally the only sane choice.” grinning Hermione ignored the defeated look on her ginger friend’s face and felt the sudden need for a stronger drink. She ordered 12 shots. Hopefully, this would get her friends off her back about dancing. She’ll drink with them, but the brunette wasn’t in the mood for hot and sweaty bodies rubbing against her. Not now, anyways. Feeling an arm come over her shoulder, Hermione turned to her friend, eyeing the nearly intoxicated being. “How about we make a bet. The first one to down all their shots the fastest wins. When Ginny or I win, you will have to come dance with us.” Arching an eyebrow, Hermione tried her best to seem disinterested. She hated how these two always seemed to use challenges to trick her into messy situations. She fell for it, every single time. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And what do I get if I win?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny started laughing. Hermione looked at her confused. Smiling she told her “It’s cute you think you’ll win.” She then fist bumped Draco, both knowing how well their plan was going to work out. All three turned towards the bar in time to see the bartender lay out twelve shot glasses. Four in front of each person. Deciding on something strong, Hermione went with vodka. Blaming herself for not seeing a situation like this happening, she knew that she’d come to regret it the following morning. But for now, it was bottoms up!</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wooooooh!” Shouted Draco as he slammed his final shot glass onto the bar. Hermione had just finished her third and was reaching for her final when the boy had finished. Forgetting about her drink, the girl turned to him with a look of disbelief. No more than a minute could have passed since they started, did this boy drink vodka like water? Hermione thought. Grinning at her knowing they won, the two now smug friends brought Hermione’s last shot to her lips silently demanding she finish it. Gulping down the burning liquid, Hermione took a sip of whatever was left of Ginny’s water and let her way too happy friends drag her to the center of the dance floor. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Trying her best to ignore all the body heat surrounding her, Hermione closed her eyes and focused on the music. After some time just rocking to the rhythm, the young woman started to loosen up and move her hips with more precision. It was a little secret of hers, but Hermione really enjoyed dancing. Especially, sensual dances of the body. When the DJ started playing one of her favorite r&amp;b songs, Hermione turned to Ginny and started gyrating on the girl’s front. Catching onto what was happening, Ginny matched Hermione’s motion and pace fast. Both girls went on to dance with each other, switching positions and tempo with every song. Draco wasn’t too far away admiring both beauties enjoying each other’s dance. He wasn’t the only one either. Many of the dancers had stopped to watch the two girls dance the night away. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>At some point, the heat behind Hermione shifted. Ginny had needed to use the bathroom and so Draco decided to escort her since Hermione was now under the spell of all the alcohol she consumed that night. She didn’t want to stop dancing. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The feeling of ice cold hands gripping her waist caused Hermione to jump a little out of her little haze. Her back was on fire due to the person behind. What a contrast from this person’s touch and their body heat. Wanting to know who this person was, that was now matching her rhythm and pace, amazingly if she may say, Hermione tried to turn around only to feel the same ice cold fingers dig into her hip bone harshly. Taking that as a warning against turning around, Hermione went back to dancing with the stranger. In her alcohol clouded brain, the brunette decided to lean into the body behind. A heavy sigh escaped her when she felt the softness of breasts press into her back. The stranger was a woman, she noted. At least she didn’t have to cause a seen with trying to get a guy off her. Situations like those never ended well for the guy and Hermione felt too good at the moment to ending her mood so quickly. Grinding harder into the body behind, Hermione brought the cold hands from her hips and encircled her waist. At this, there was a deep, airy chuckle in her ear. The sound sent a spike of arousal through the brunette. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There was a kiss to the back of her neck. Hermione couldn’t stop herself from leaning into the feeling. She thought she felt hot earlier, but she was wrong. Right now, in this exact moment, the girl felt like she was standing in the earth’s core. Licking her suddenly dry lips Hermione unconsciously angled her neck, giving the mysterious woman more area to continue her minstatrations. Another chuckle was heard as the woman leaned into her ear. Lips brushing against the shell, the woman husked “Is this how you greet all your exes, pet?” A tongue snaked out to lick the length of her ear before the woman stepped back. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Feeling like she was thrusted into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Hermione straightened and turned around abruptly. Trying to ignore the voice in her head reasoning why the heat felt familiar to her and why she felt sad at the sudden coldness without it, Hermione locked eyes with her ex lover. She was still too intoxicated to panic properly but she was still shocked no less. Trying to make sure her voice doesn’t waiver, Hermione took a breath to calm her pounding heart before addressing the woman she once thought was her world. Her night couldn’t have taken such a terrible turn, the girl thought. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you doing here, Bellatrix” </span>
