  <strong>Noun (ˈruː.mər)</strong>
</p><p><strong>An unofficial interesting story or piece of news that might be true or invented, and quickly spreads from person to person</strong> </p>
<hr/><p>        As soon as I pass onto Platform 9 and 3/4, I am greeted with the familiar sound of Macy Kane, my best friend, arguing (quite loudly) with the station master about why she should have the right to let her screech owl Leo onto the train. Leo's angry screeching chimes in from time to time, giving the station master what looks like a huge headache. </p><p>"A'ight," I hear him say. "Bring the damn bird onto the train. But if he goes flyin' everywhere, you'll be in big trouble." Macy smiles sweetly, flipping her ultra-long hair as she makes a sharp 180-degree turn onto the train. I yell out her name and she turns around again, grinning from ear to ear and gently holding Leo's tiny cage. </p><p>"Jessica Carlson,  what took you so long?!" she shrieks. "You're, like, 10 minutes late!"</p><p>"Aww, c'mon, I'm still 15 minutes early!" I protest, and she gives me her knowing smirks. Every Ravenclaw in the history of Ravenclaws is always early. I can still remember the day when Macy, Drusilla and I arrived late at our first class of the day in first year, and it was none other than potions. It was probably the worst mistake we had ever made, to arrive late and assume we'd be on time. We lost 15 points. It was terrible. Ever since, five years later, us three and Drusilla's boyfriend, Levi, all strive to be the first to arrive to anything. </p><p>        I walk onto the train, presenting my ticket to an employee of Hogwarts Express, and enter the beautiful corridors, yet to be filled with this year's students. </p><p>"Dru managed to get the best compartment this year," Macy explains as we shuffle down to the back of the train. "Hermione Granger got it last year, but she graduated, so now it's our turn," she says. I walk in, greeted to Drusilla's bone-crushing hug and Levi's soft chiding to not break my spine.</p><p>"Jessie!" she shrieks after she pulls apart from me. "Merlin's beard, where <em>were</em> you all summer?! You only responded to, like, 5 of my letters!"</p><p>"Good grief," I mutter as I sit down on the fluffy seat beside Macy. "I was at Wool's, actually, in August." I pause for a moment, taking in Drusilla and Levi's flabbergasted expression, and Macy's indifferent one. "It was a little weird, 'cause everybody knew that it was the place that You-Know-Who lived, but at least the staff were nice. So was the food. But Dru, I'm sorry I didn't get your mail." </p><p>"Don't mention it!" she says, waving her hand around, and almost hitting Levi in the face. "I mean, going to the place where You-Know-Who lived... the historical significance there is probably astounding!"</p><p>        I shrug off the fact that I probably should have done some research there, and decided not to because I was scared to death of anything relating to the Dark Lord. Even though his death was over a year ago, the aftershock of his destruction still hung in the air, and even though it might have been my imagination, I could still feel his presence in the orphanage. For fear of my already fractured mental state, I had decided not to look into the history. </p><p>"Meh, I didn't get around to looking at all the cool significance," I half-lie. Drusilla and Levi shrug, disappointed and after about five seconds, they start making out in the corner. Macy gives me a questioning look and leans in closer to me. </p><p>"I don't want to sound like a muggle gossip, but did you hear the latest rumor?" </p><p>"Macy, that sounds precisely like a muggle gossip," I whisper, "But no, I haven't heard anything interesting." </p><p>        Macy grins like she is holding the world's most important secret on the tip of her tongue, and she side-eyes Drusilla and Levi, who seem beautifully oblivious to our conversation as they mutter insults to each-other, and some sort of History of Magic pop quiz. Somehow that turns them on, but I never understood it."Well," Macy continues, "I was emailing Alison Jones, you know, the prefect from last year, right?- and her mom is one of the Muggle Affairs office heads, and apparently, she overheard a conversation between the Minister of Magic and some other guy, and even though she didn't catch all of the conversation, she heard enough to know that there's an alien coming to Hogwarts!" Macy grins like an idiot for a couple seconds, and then her smile falters a little since my reaction isn't as gobsmacked as she might have hoped. My brow furrows a bit as I try to comprehend her words. </p><p>"Wait, but I don't get it. Aren't aliens a fairy tale?" She shrugs. </p><p>"Well, for the longest time, I thought wizards and unicorns and goblins and all that magic stuff wasn't real, and look where I am now."</p><p>        I nod my head, being once again proven possibly wrong by Macy Kane and her muggle-born logic and wisdom. Ever since I met her and Drusilla, five years ago today, I was charmed by her insightful nature and ability to see things and view topics from not only her own personal opinion, but from all opinions. Not only was she smart, but she was mature and wise, much more than your average 11-year-old. No wonder she got prefect this year. Drusilla, unfortunately, was quite the opposite. She was loud, slightly rude and very cheeky, but somehow, even though she's Macy's polar opposite, they still have remained best friends ever since. And then there's me, somehow stuck in the middle.</p><p>"So what else do you know about this... alien?" I ask cautiously. In miscellaneous religious texts, it had been said that gossiping is a sin, and isn't healthy. Me immediately asking Macy for more information on this strange-sounding rumor only seems to confirm the truth to those laws. We might be getting ourselves worked up for nothing, and if the rumors aren't true, we'll probably be devastated. </p><p>"Well, it only appeared a few days ago, and it was interrogated by the Ministry. Apparently, it's of age to be taught at Hogwarts."</p><p>"Wait, so it's a wizard?" Macy furrows her brow. </p><p>"Yeah, I guess so. Jeez, now I'm thinking of an E.T. type wielding a wand and saying 'Accio phone home' in the weird E.T. accent." She snickers under her breath, and I decide not to ask her to explain the Muggle reference. I took Muggle Studies in 3ed year, but that crazy Carrow lady was leading the charge, and basically taught us that Muggles and Muggle culture is trash and should be punishable by death. If I wasn't so close with Macy, I may have believed her, maybe even joined her. The thought sends shivers up my spine. But either way, I learnt nothing about Muggle culture, and still know next to nothing when Macy makes her references. </p><p>"Well, I guess we'll find out who it is tonight," Macy says with an excited sigh, as she pops a Bertie Bott's Every Flavored Bean into her mouth, before gagging and spitting it out. "Wasabi," she mutters bitterly. "Freaking wizard candy, killing my taste buds." She looks into her bag and fishes out a red paperback novel, and starts reading, thus ending our conversation.</p><p>        I stare out the window, contemplating the next year. My fourth year at Hogwarts had been a bit tiring, since everybody was still frazzled over the events of the Hogwarts War, and some people were just to tired to concentrate on their studies and try to succeed, me being one of them. The only person who seemed to keep it together was Hermione Granger, who finished her last school year, excelling at everything, smiling and waving at random people in the hallways, and not once did I ever see her break down crying, or shouting, or just wallowing away into an emotionless shell, like many other people I had observed over the year. </p><p>        But that year was over. And this year, I'm going to be Hermione Granger. I won't let the past get in the way of my success, and no way in Hell will I let it fester itself into feelings that can easily be removed with ambition, smarts and work, things that any Ravenclaw should master flawlessly. Right?</p>
