    <p>Esteemed Mr. Moony,</p><p> </p><p>It is with great and everlasting joy that I present you - insert rolling drums here, please - LADY CALLIOPE! MY VERY OWN OWL! Isn’t she the perfect example of beauty and grace? Isn’t she the most wonderful creature to ever live on this forgotten earth? Is or is she not the emblem of all that’s good and pure in this sad, sad world?!</p><p> </p><p>Her single, almost blind eye shines like the brightest star - so, well, me. Her piumage, of the darkest shade of brown, tinted with streaks of gold, is still enchanting even if time claims one of them almost every day - it would be rather annoying, constantly picking them up,if it wasn’t for the everlasting love that immediately sparked between us. And the strength! Her formidable strength, that surpasses age and tiredness - and the, barely noticeable, lack of a leg: war wound, she gets very upset, so don’t ask about it -  where was I? Yes! Yes, her strength: that takes her tirelessly in the sky, time after time, carrying my words and treasuring them like only a faithful companion would.</p><p> </p><p>SUMMER BARELY EVEN BEGUN AND HAPPINESS IS ALREADY FILLING MY VERY SOUL! In the form of an old, almost blind, legless, adorable owl. You love her already Moony, admit it. James keeps saying she is an abomination, and can’t look at her for much time: when we saw her at the store, he downright screamed - and that, I must admit, is ultimately why I choose her.</p><p>He literally shivers every time he glances at her, and I even saw him suppress a squeak a couple of times. It is wonderful, I love her immensely. </p><p> </p><p>The Potter’s house looks even more beautiful this year, the nothingness in green surrounding it is already bright and lovely and the sun shines incessantly above the medieval stones of the ancient house - it’s really, really hot. I’m not sweating already, but I will be soon. But my room - MY ROOM! - is on the second floor opposite to James’, is hidden from the sun on the warmest hours and pleasantly windy. You remember it, it once was the guest room. Now it’s filled with posters and Gryffindor banners, there are clothes everywhere, and it smells faintly of wet dog.</p><p> </p><p>How did your summer start Moony? Any new friends, in the form of elderly pets? Or perhaps, in your case, any new books? Adventures? - like that one I really liked in fourth year, the one about pirates (you know the one: with the map, and the old man, and the treasure). Keep me updated, you know I only read through your eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Wishing you a splendid summer &amp; many new adventures, yours truly</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Padfoot.</p><p> </p><p>P.S. Feel free to feed Calliope whatever, at this point she needs all the help she can get.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Esteemed Mr. Padfoot,</p><p>if you see blood on this letter, it's Calliope's fault. I gave her a piece of my loved and precious chocolate, the one with those crunchy, beautiful, tasty nuts. She choked down all the pieces with one bite, vomited it on my book and chewed on my hand. What kind of monster she is?</p><p>Besides, what kind of name is Calliope? I think Pandora is more appropriate, you know. Pandora, bearer of all the ills of the world.</p><p>I will call her Pandora, from now on, and you can't stop me.</p><p>Right now is looking at me like she wants to kill me. Did you train her to murder me? Of course you did.</p><p>I have to say this - even if it makes me a bad person, but I thought that Wormtail was the ugliest animal in the world but now that I meet Pandora, I think she defeats him - and it's not that easy.</p><p> </p><p>Things at home are always the same. Dad looks at me like he can't decide if I am a monster or still his son, while mum looks at me like I am going to break. You know, the same shit.</p><p>Two days ago mum brought me a goldfish to keep me company. Yes, you hear that correctly. A goldfish. To keep me company. What kind of company can it give to me? And I even gave that thing a name - Adolf, because it has a black spot right under its eyes. I have a little nazi as pet. How pathetic I am?</p><p> </p><p>I am reading a new book - The Box Man, you would like it. There is a nameless man that gives up his identity and wears a large cardboard box over his head. He can only imagine the world. Scribbling on the inside walls of the box, he invents past, present and future that crash together in his brain. I can't tell you anything more because if you want to know, you have to read it.</p><p>Quote of the day - from the book I am reading:</p><p>
  <em>‘I personally feel that a box, far from being a dead end, is an entrance to another world. I don't know to where, but an entrance to somewhere, some other world.’</em>
</p><p> </p><p>I miss you and your stupid noisy laugh. I would like to hear it now to save me from this disturbing silence.</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>I'm happy you finally have a room on your own. The Potters are so kind and they love you a lot. Are you having fun? Come on, tell me which pranks you and James are doing to each other - I know you are torturing each other.</p><p>I'm happy you are finally happy, you deserve it.</p><p> </p><p>Say hi to Prongs from me and tell him to sneak in your room one of this night and dye your hair blonde.</p><p> </p><p>Yours,</p><p>Mr. Moony.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Mr. R.J. Lupin,</p><p> </p><p>(No, you don't deserve a dear, or an esteemed) How dare you insult the beautiful, majestic, aweinspairing owl that graces us with her services. How dare you, you peasant.</p><p> </p><p>That said, I like Pandora. She shall be, from now on: Calliope Pandora Black (Lupin? Black-Lupin? Since you named her too, you should be co-parenting her. Take your responsibility, Mr. Lupin). The bearer of all ills into the world and the muse of eloquence and epic poetry: it should surely inspire my correspondence to be both sophisticated and outrageous, just how I like it.</p><p> </p><p>And about your alleged cruelty, you shouldn't worry: I have found myself thinking that Wormtail is the ugliest animal on earth too, and he wasn't even a rat at the time. No, I'm not ashamed.</p><p> </p><p>The box book does sound interesting, in that all in their head/going mad thing you like so much. It sounds like that one that you tried to make me read, in like, first year. The one of the guy that fakes his death, and leaves his god awful family - The Late Whatshisname? I think, maybe. Oh well, it was boring.</p><p> </p><p>The fish, while not exactly equipped to keep you company, should still deserve your love - since you already gave him a rather dreadful name. Love the damn fish, Remus. Is all you can do after YOU NAMED HIM AFTER A FUCKING NAZI.</p><p> </p><p>We do miss you too, we always do. (I miss you. I know the silence can be way too loud, and feeling alone when your family is there. I know. But we miss you, so don't listen to it. Don't listen to the silence Remus, it's lying. We're here, we love you).</p><p> </p><p>The prank war, as you wisely predicted oh wise and good Moony, already started. Or, well, I started it. I just kept looking at Prongs’ hair, and its resemblance to a bird nest kept bugging me, and I couldn't take it anymore: I had to charm a bird to follow him and sit on his head constantly, I just couldn't resist. And no, I didn't share with him your unfair suggestion - me a blond? Really? The mare thought that I could even slightly resemble that opportunistic bitch Narcissa makes me want to barf. No, bad Moony: my hair is a no touch zone.</p><p> </p><p>(Kidding, you're always good to me Moony. You can touch my hair)</p><p> </p><p>The Potters are good, amazing really. It's just. They love me, I know they do. And it's not like I feel as a guest, or an intruder - I suppose I feel like I’m family, maybe. But my conception of family is so fucked up that I can't even. I never felt like this at home, and it's all so good - but it makes me want to tear my hair out. Sorry, I don't know what I'm saying anymore.</p><p> </p><p>James says we have a couple of weeks before the weather destroys us, but since he also says it wouldn't rain today I don't believe him anymore - I feel like the sky is trying to fall on us, one drop at a time. And it's still fucking hot, rain and all. Stupid England, it's supposed to be summer.</p><p> </p><p>(Are summer rains supposed to be romantic? Like: it's not freezing cold, so we can kiss under the rain? I don't get it, you'll still get wet.)</p><p> </p><p>Well, I think I lost control of this letter a long time ago - blame the sleepiness, or the influence of the muse, or the late hour and the general tiredness.</p><p> </p><p>I'll send you some chocolate &amp; you really should apologize to Calliope Pandora, lots of love</p><p> </p><p>Sirius.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Dear Padfoot,</p><p>I just thought to write a letter to James and start it with ‘Deer James’.</p><p>I can hear you laughing. Stop it immediately, you will be heard from everyone in the world.</p><p> </p><p>Calliope Pandora Black-Lupin. A name, a punishment. I will take my responsibility - do not worry about that, even if it's clear I am not the most loved parent. Indeed I tried to pet her and she almost ripped my hand apart. Such a lovely owl. You have to know that the first time I saw her, I felt mercy. A poor old owl who has to carry your heavy letters full of bullshit. But then she tried to kill me, and you are trying to make me feel guilty for insulting her? No way. I will love her like a cat loves  water. It is the best I can do right now. Maybe - and I say maybe if one day she will stop trying to mutilate me, I will forgive her. But until then I will look at her with the same hate she looks at me.</p><p> </p><p>You said you wrote this letter late in the night, but it arrived to me only this morning. Maybe Callidora got lost. Do you like Callidora? I know, I know, my names are beautiful. And yeah, I named my pet after a fucking nazi - stop screaming.</p><p> </p><p>The book I'm reading doesn't sound interesting, it is interesting. You always say my books are boring but then you like them when I read them to you. Admit it. Another quote from this book:</p><p>“I have the feeling of being in a construction elevator suspended in the skeleton of an unfinished building and between two concrete walls that were shedding tears like bird droppings.”</p><p> </p><p>The quote is not just random.</p><p>I know how you feel - like you cannot understand where you belong, like you are suspended between what you are and what you miss. I can't tell you if this feeling will ever go away, but I can tell you that you are not alone in this war. I will fight with you. Don't be afraid. And if the sky will fall on you - one drop at a time, don't worry. We will catch every single drop and we’ll build our personal sky. Can you imagine it? A sky without the moon, with your star - the brightest star of the Canis Major constellation, lighting it all.</p><p> </p><p>Some days I wake up with this weight on my chest that keeps me from breathing. I know you can understand me.</p><p> </p><p>You made James’ hair a bird nest? Really? You are a genius. Will you do this again when I will be there, please? And yes, you should be ashamed for what you think about Wormtail. Okay, he is not the most beautiful bloke in the world but, come on, there is always Snape, so…</p><p> </p><p>Now, I'll wait - with a lot of anxiety, my chocolate. You know what chocolate you have to send to me. Be sure Callidora won't eat it. Be sure.</p><p> </p><p>I miss you.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Remus.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>My Dearest and Most Wonderful Remus “Moony” Lupin,</p><p> </p><p>I am happy to inform you that you are now my new, undoubtedly improved James. The old one - you might remember him: shitty hair, basically blind without glasses, unhealthy obsession with high maintenance redheads - died tragically. My hands accidentally held his neck really tight, until the very breath of life abandoned him. A tragic accident, really - not that he didn't deserve it: he dared to color the best hair in the universe, The Best Hair, without their owners consent. How dare he, the heathen.</p><p> </p><p>(My hair has been a glittery shade of silver all day, I look like a unicorn vomited on my head)</p><p> </p><p>But, as the muggles say: when one hits rock bottom, one can only go up - it was like that right? Can't remember. And up I went! Euphemia's best pudding was already waiting for me when I finally found enough resolve to leave my room with that shiny abomination on my head - oh the bravery! Up Gryffindor!!! - and suddenly my day was wonderful.</p><p> </p><p>And the world, and universe. And even this dysfunctional fucking country: how can the sun be so bloody damn hot when just last night the sky was raining down?! But after Euphemia's pudding, even England's weather seems wonderful. Well, almost - I do feel my brain trying to sweat out of my cranium from my ears.</p><p> </p><p>You're right. Wormtail is indeed aesthetically displeasing; but Snivellus is downright ugly. From the tip of his greasy hair, to the darkest corner of his hollow soul. That disgusting little shit.</p><p> </p><p>Callidora! I like it! It's genius! (How the same person can think such a wonderful, aristocratic name and then name a poor fish AFTER A FUCKING NAZI is beyond me.)</p><p> </p><p>Today mom asked me and The Late James Potter  - how can he manage to be such a pain in the ass even from the afterlife is a mystery - to water the tulips. Her beloved singing tulips, that apparently hate Prongs with a passion - there's a story there. Prongs refuses to tell, but I will find out. So I spent half an hour laughing my ass off: every time James tried to step towards them, a concert of offkey screaming exploded. I loved it.</p><p> </p><p>(All the more hilarious since the bird I charmed yesterday seems to have taken a liking to him. He has been following around still, the magic stopped a long time ago).</p><p> </p><p>Does it go away? The weight on your chest. It could explain your tragic posture, Mr. Moony. Ever tried blowing it away, breath after breath, until sadness isn't there anymore? (I know it's not that easy, but breathe in happiness - James getting screamed down by flowers while a bird follows him? That's one happy thought - and let the sadness out)</p><p> </p><p>(I'm here, you know that right? Always)</p><p> </p><p>I'm sending a photo with the letter, and chocolate - yes, I know what kind, who do you take me for? - to bribe you into not ever showing it to anyone. Yes, that's me. Yes, I have silver glittery hair. No, I don't ever want to talk about it again.</p><p> </p><p>James’ funerals will be whenever I feel like organizing them. Since I had to kill him a second time - he got on his broom to take that photo, “to catch my beautiful sleeping face he said”. I'm never napping on the gras, never again - I really don't feel like throwing him a party.</p><p> </p><p>With glittery hair that are admittedly starting to grow on me &amp; wishing you a Jamesless summer, miss you always</p><p> </p><p>Sirius “Padfoot” Black.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Dear Sirius,</p><p>I don't know where to begin. Too much information, too much funny information.</p><p>Tell the Potters they have my deepest condolences. He was such a wonderful boy. I will miss him. Wherever you are James, we love you - from the bottom of our hearts.</p><p>I was thinking about what we can write on his tombstone: ‘Here lies James Fleamont Potter, beloved son, loyal friend and elegant stag.’</p><p> </p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>The photo.</p><p>Pads, you almost look like a sweet sleepy baby. And that hair. THAT HAIR, PADS. They clash with your eyes, that's for sure.</p><p>Even if - I have to be honest with you, no color can be as bright as your eyes. Don't strut around now, I can see you. Ten points to Gryffindor for James. He should think about being a photographer one day. Good job, Prongs. Others ten points for you.</p><p> </p><p>I'm eating the chocolate you sent me, right now. Fuck, Sirius. It is so good. So so so so good. You should hear me eating it. Maybe you already can. Do you hear me making these pleasure moans while I am chewing it?</p><p>This milk chocolate with coconut and caramel is heavenly, otherworldly. I can't even explain.</p><p>Thank you, Sirius. You are my best best best friend. (Don't tell James.)</p><p> </p><p>That story behind the singing tulips, I think I know something. Prongs talks in his sleep and I am a light sleeper, so one night I woke up because of Prongs talking about something I couldn't catch.</p><p>So I focused and -</p><p>I'M LAUGHING SO HARD RIGHT NOW THAT I CAN BARELY WRITE STRAIGHT .</p><p>I spare you all the details about how he drooled on his pillow and how confused he was.</p><p>The story is: James was so jealous of the singing tulips. So he decided to compete with them - he knew he could sing better then them. And for weeks - I think even for months, he stood in front of them singing ‘Come on, baby, light my fire’ again and again and again. I think the tulips got mad and yelled at him. I can tell you from how he was screaming in his sleep. So, I think they keep yelling at him.</p><p>Here, another line for his tombstone: ‘The one and only man in the universe that managed to be hated by singing tulips.’</p><p> </p><p>James getting screamed down by flowers while a bird follows him is really a happy thought. Reading your letters is the most beautiful time of the day, really.</p><p>The situation here is almost unbearable. They don't talk to me and I don't talk to them. They hate me and it is not even my fault. How can they not understand? It's who I am. It's who I will be. I know they think that it would be better if I died that night.</p><p>I wish you were here, you know. When you are with me every bad thing goes away.</p><p> </p><p>The quote of the day:</p><p>‘No matter where you, no matter how far you run, you can't run away from yourself.’</p><p> </p><p>Your,</p><p>Remus.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Remus,</p><p>Never apologize for who you are. Never. You know how welcoming the Potters are, and me and James would love to have you here. It you need a break, if you need us, we're here. Come and visit, okay? One week, it would really do you good.</p><p> </p><p>That said, we have some serious - pun fully intended - talk to do:</p><p> </p><p>What the hell was that? Are we in a sexy-kind of correspondence now? Are we in a hard movie set? Are we? - Then why are you making sounds like that Moony? Is it to make me blush? It was, don't deny it.</p><p>Mom actually came to call me for dinner, just to find me blushing like a little girl - I had to listen to the birds and bees thing again, Remus. It was the single, most embarrassing thing that ever happened to me - and I remind you that I went to lessons wearing a skirt for a whole week, in second year.</p><p> </p><p>And then, you sly bastard, you go on and on about my stupid eyes. My cheeks are almost purple at this point.</p><p>(And, come on. Moony your eyes are amazing, there aren't that many shades of green in the whole fuccking forest!)</p><p> </p><p>James does talk in his sleep, just yesterday I heard him whisper something about freckles and breasts and I had to run away because of reasons. I don't want to think about Evans like that - and Merlin forbids the image of Prongs ever … I shiver at the mare thought.</p><p> </p><p>Since you said that my stories lift your spirit and gives joy to your sleepless nights - yes, I distinctly remember reading that - I will please you with the wonderful gift of an original fairytale written by my own hand.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Once upon a time,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There was a wonderful and brave knight. He had soft sandy curls and the deepest green eyes, many battles had left scars on his body; but they only made him more handsome.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The knight was on a noble quest, just like he should: he was searching for a princess, supposed to be on a high tower, guarded by a disgusting Troll - Prongs was his name, and his smell was so pungent that the knight found the tower just following it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In a couple of swings of his big, big sword (I'm winking, if you can't tell) Prongs the Smelly Troll died, and Moony the Knight went to find the princess.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But there was no princess, just another knight - admittedly the most gorgeous knight that ever existed, with the most beautiful hair; but still not a princess.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Moony the knight, being as kind and generous as they come - and having an excellent taste in travelling companions - decided to befriend him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They went on many adventures together, and lived happily ever after.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The End.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Waiting on your praise for my storytelling skills &amp; reminding you that you have a place here with us, disgustings amount of love</p><p> </p><p>Sirius.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Pads,</p><p>I really want to go there - with you, to be with you and James, but I can't leave mum alone. I think I freaked out a bit in my last letter. I was angry with dad - he kept staring at me and yelling at mum and I snapped. I feel so bad when sometimes I hate them both, because my mum really loves me and I know she always will. It's a bad period between them - they scream at each other every day, and I know I am the reason for it. But she is so happy when I am around, you know, she smiles at me like I am the best thing ever happened in her life. I will feel guilty leaving her here alone with him if I can stay here.</p><p>This morning she made me my favorite cookies, the ones with the chocolate chip and crumbled nut. I want to learn how to do them. Will you eat my cookies? I can swear to you that I am not going to poison them. Pinky promise. Cross my heart.</p><p> </p><p>Uh, if we were on an adult movie set, we would be naked. When your letter arrived I just got out of the shower. Now I have only a towel around my hips, so I am technically naked, don't you think?</p><p>Now it depends on you. Are you naked? But if you are not, you can always take off your clothes.</p><p>Okay, I assume we are both naked now, but this does not mean we are in an adult movie. You know, if we don't touch each other or do other things… Yeah, I think Euphemia told you about  this sort of thing already.</p><p> </p><p>I love making you blush. You are all composed and elegant and suddenly an orrible red covers your white, aristocratic cheeks. Adorable.</p><p> </p><p>I can tell you, your story does not convince me. You are a princess, Pads. All you have to do is put on lipstick - a soft pink will be great on your skin, and then you are perfect. You are not that kind of princess who needs a kiss to wake up, right? Because I don't know if I can do this. If you promise me you will brush your teeth before I come - or someone brushes them for you since you are sleeping, I can think about it. Only because it's you, because I will never kiss James… or Peter. Oh my God, I have the image of Peter's lips stuck in my head. I have to vomit. I'll be right back.</p><p> </p><p>James talked about freckles and breasts in his sleep? You are lucky - at least he doesn't scream “COME ON BABY LIGHT MY FIIIIIRE’</p><p> </p><p>Quote of the day: </p><p>‘When a man looks at the stars, he grows calm and forgets small things. They answer his questions and show him that his earth is only one of the million worlds. Hold your soul still and look upward often, and you will understand their speech. Never forget the stars.’</p><p> </p><p>Always yours,</p><p>Moony.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Moons,</p><p> </p><p>I love your Mom, and her cookies are the very best - if you even do menage to make them, I will doubtlessly eat them. I would never refuse free food, you know me.</p><p> </p><p>I would, admittedly, also be a wonderful princess - it must be the hair.</p><p>(Yes, I have noted your liking to torture me. No, I'm not blushing right now.)</p><p> </p><p>We went to the lake today - you remember it: that slightly bigger than average pod of dirty looking water, surprisingly far from James’ house? That one.</p><p>I must admit, boredom is starting to get to us. And Mom threatened to kill us more in the last few days than ever before. It was only logical to escape for a while.</p><p> </p><p>We had fun. We kind of froze our bits - forgot swimsuits, swam in the nude, lake is always surprisingly colder than you expect.</p><p>At some point Prongs started talking about Evans, and I pondered feeding him mud to make him shut up; but then he started to make sense, and things got weird.</p><p> </p><p>Kind of weird? Weird in a weird way? Like: he really likes Evans. Not in the I want in her pants, but not the I want to give you flowers and shit way either. It was. It was the I want to spend the rest of my life with your way.</p><p>And that freaks me out. How do you even do that? Doesn't it scare the shit out of you?</p><p>But James said that it doesn't scare him one bit, not even if she never really likes him back: he said that he loves her, even if she doesn't love him back. And that scares me even more.</p><p> </p><p>Shit. I don't know what's wrong with me today hahahaha - I must have gotten the weird from Prongs, that contagious prat.</p><p> </p><p>Anyway, Mom made muffins. The chocolate ones, with chocolate chips and chocolate filling that you would “willingly die for” - quoted verbatim.</p><p>I sent you a couple, don't worry - No, Callidora won't eat them. She had her fill already.</p><p> </p><p>Waiting for more nerdy quotes &amp; eating chocolate muffins, stay safe</p><p> </p><p>Padfoot.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Wonderful Princess,</p><p>seriously? Callidora ate half of one of my muffins! I can't believe it. She is a fucking fat pig. Are we serious about this? What if I were pregnant and I wanted a muffin? She is an abomination. I'm so hurt and insulted that I don't know if I will be able to forgive her. I don't think I will. I don't think I'll want to.</p><p> </p><p>The lake. I love that lake. It is so peaceful and calming and there are all of those trees and wind blows slightly through them.</p><p> </p><p>Poor Euphemia, I understand her. I know it's not easy dealing with you two 24 hours a day. It can be exasperating. It can give you a severe headache. It can give to you the desire of killing someone - maybe exactly you two.</p><p>She has all my compassion.</p><p>Euphemia, stay strong. I know it can be hard, but stay strong. They are your sons and I know it is not so easy but try not to kill them. I would miss them too much.</p><p> </p><p>I know it's weird, but the idea of spending my entire life with someone doesn't scare the shit out of me. I think it's kind of… heartwarming, you know. Be with someone who understands you, doesn't judge you, something like this. I like to think there is someone for me and only me, somewhere out there.</p><p>Someone who can numb the pain, who can look at my scars without shivering.</p><p>I think I like the idea of taking care of someone until the end, someone to fight with - side by side.</p><p>Someone to wake up with and who can smile at me even if it's early morning and my hair is a disaster and my face is a mess.</p><p> </p><p>I knew you love my quotes and - here for you, the quote of the day:</p><p>‘It is an absolute human certainty that no one can know his own beauty or perceive a sense of his own worth until it has been reflected back to him in the mirror of another loving, caring human being.’</p><p> </p><p>Yours,</p><p>Remi.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Heiya Moony!</p><p> </p><p>How’s your summer going? Mine was going great, until Sirius got in one of his moods: he has been Padfoot for a couple of days - changing only to eat basically, I think mom and dad are starting to notice.</p><p> </p><p>Got any idea what's up? You know what, don't worry about it. The full is tomorrow, after all. I'll figure Sirius out, you take care of yourself.</p><p> </p><p>Stay safe,</p><p>Prongs.</p><p> </p><p align="center">-----------------------</p><p> </p><p>Dear Remus,</p><p> </p><p>How was the full? Okay, stupid question. I hope Moony went easy on you last night - you say the first moon away from school is always the hardest.</p><p> </p><p>I'm sorry I didn't write lately. I got too into my head a bit, needed to figure some stuff out. I'm sorry, really. I'll do better next moon - I just wish we could have been there, I watched the moon all night.</p><p> </p><p>Well, to help you get away from boredom in your after moon bed days, here's a little fairytale for you:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Once upon a time,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There was a prince, trapped in a tower. And for how much he wanted to escape the tower, he never could.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It wasn't like there weren't doors, and stairs, and windows; but none of them was the way out.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He tried the door, and got in another room; he tried the stairs, and got in the basement; he wanted to try the window, but he was never brave enough.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He saw the world from the window: trees, lakes, birds and stones. But most of all he saw the sky, a moonless sky full of shiny stars: he could never see the moon from his tower, and he always wanted to.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The prince wanted to go out, but he didn't. Would the moon be there, if he did get out of the tower? Should he really try the window?</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>James,</p><p>Everything is alright here. You know, the same.</p><p>I don't know what is going on with Sirius, he didn't tell me anything. Sorry.</p><p>Take care of yourself,</p><p>Remus.</p><p> </p><p align="center">---------------</p><p> </p><p>Sirius,</p><p>Is everything alright? I was so worried that you didn't write to me for three day. I know it's not a big deal, but I was used to hearing from you every day. Are you okay? Something happened? You know you can talk to me about everything. Please, don't shut me out.</p><p> </p><p>The full moon has been bad. Really bad. Moony misses his pack - especially his Padfoot. He was so angry that I wasn't able to control him, even before the full moon. I was so scared. I've never seen him so angry before. I was really scared. I thought I wouldn't make it.</p><p>Maybe also my head was fucked up.</p><p>He hurt me badly. He left me three more scars - they are still bleeding. Two on my chest and one on my left arm. They hurt so much. Why do they hurt so much?</p><p>Shit, Sirius, I can't even think straight right now.</p><p>I'm sorry.</p><p>I'm sorry.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Remus,</p><p> </p><p>I'm sorry. I'm so, so, so fucking sorry you can't even. I didn't want to worry you, and I didn't want to leave you alone, I'm sorry. I swear I didn't want to hurt you, I'm sorry.</p><p> </p><p>Listen I. Nothing happened, okay? And it's no one's fault but mine. But I'm not ready to talk about it, not yet.</p><p> </p><p>Okay, I will make you a promise - a real one: I won't shut you out, never again. I don't think I can tell you what's up with me - I don't even really know myself, at this point. But I promise I will talk to you, I will send you a letter, even just a few words to tell you I can't talk.</p><p> </p><p>I'm just so used to having you around, in real life: if I need to be Padfoot for a while I just do it, but I still come to you or James to be petted. But you're not here, and I can't do that.</p><p> </p><p>The only way to let you know that I'm here and I still love you is to send you a letter, even if it's - I won't shut you out, I will talk to you. I promise.</p><p>It's just that seeing those letters, writing them - I keep talking to you like normal, but on paper it looks like more.</p><p> </p><p>I miss you. Even saying that feels weird on paper.</p><p> </p><p>But I do. And I love you, and I'm sorry. So, I already promised that I won't do it again - I promise - can you forgive me, Moony?</p><p>I will do better, and we can go back to talking like always - just like it always has been, I promise, but I won't disappear on you.</p><p> </p><p>Hoping you will forgive me &amp; missing you always, I'm sorry</p><p> </p><p>Sirius.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Sirius,</p><p>I'm sorry. I love you too, and I am sorry. I didn't want you to feel guilty. Everything is alright now. I'm better and I want you to be better too.</p><p>Please, breathe. In and out. In and out. I know you are hyperventilating now, but everything is okay. I promise. There is nothing to forgive, I swear. I'm okay, we are okay.</p><p>If you were here now, I'd hug you so tight - so tight, and I will never let you go.</p><p>Can you feel my arms around you?</p><p>I can feel your head against my chest.</p><p>I'm stroking your hair right now and I'm telling you everything is going to be fine.</p><p> </p><p>Please, believe me.</p><p>I love you.</p><p> </p><p>If there is something you don't want to tell me - or you are not ready to tell me yet, I can understand you. When you'll be ready, I'm here - I'm there. I will always be with you, no matter what.</p><p>If there is something I can do to make you feel better, I will. I could do everything for you.</p><p> </p><p>Quote of the day - again:</p><p>‘All men have stars, but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems... But all these stars are silent. You - you alone, will have stars as no one else has them. ‘</p><p> </p><p>You are my star, Sirius.</p><p> </p><p>With all the love I have,</p><p>Remus.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Mooooooonyyyyyy,</p><p> </p><p>You sweet, amazing man - you kind, wonderful, beautiful, celestial human being, you. I'm so happy to hear from you! I missed you so much, and you splendid, pure soul forgave me, so now the world is beautiful and life has meaning ecc. Yes, I'm really happy today - does it show?</p><p> </p><p>The Potters took us in the city today. Well, muggle village: the cutest little spot rear the river, with old red brick houses and many people. Really a lot of people, way more than I expected. The Market was almost like Diagon Alley sunday morning, just without any magic at all.</p><p> </p><p>The fish store was disgusting: the smell almost made me barf, not kidding. The fruit and vegetable stands were amazing though, all the smells and the colors - I sent you a photo of that, so you can see it and agree with me. And then a flower shop that was even better - I took a photo of that too, and I'm sending it. There was also a little library, really old looking and almost hidden away, and it smelled like the Hogwarts library and it reminded me of you - I wanted to get you a little present, but I really don't know my way around muggle books. I sent you a photo of the library too, just because.</p><p> </p><p>So, we buyed flowers and I made a flower crown for myself - James so kindly took a photo of me wearing it, so you can tell me how talented I am.</p><p>And since I couldn't find a book to give you, I made you a flower crown too: will you consider taking a photo of yourself wearing it? - or just a photo of yourself? I kinda miss your face.</p><p> </p><p>And we made orange juice - without magic! Just with our hands and our own hands, and it was amazing! And also surprisingly tiring, and our hands got all sticky. We added a lot of sugar, and it was almost good. You know I don't even like oranges, so it's progress!</p><p> </p><p>I'm also sending some chocolate! Your favourite and orange chocolate - an abomination, I know, but still on point.</p><p> </p><p>Hoping Callidora won't drop anything &amp; wishing you'll like your flower crown, lots of love</p><p> </p><p>Padfoot.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Pads,</p><p>Callidora didn't drop anything. That's a miracle.</p><p>I'm eating right now - yes, while I am writing to you (you know, some people are multifunctionals), the orange chocolate, and I have to say that it is so so good.</p><p>This taught me an important lesson: all chocolate is a good chocolate.</p><p>Don't you dare ever again discriminate against chocolate. Never again.</p><p> </p><p>Pads, you are fabulous with that flower crown. Now you are a real princess. Those fleur-de-lis are beautiful on your black hair, you know.</p><p>And the flower crown you send to me? Cherry blossoms? Really? Do you think I am a cherry blossom guy? Yeah, maybe.</p><p>Okay, I'll send you a photo of me with this flower crown. Don't you dare laugh at me. If you do, I will know.</p><p> </p><p>Shit, Sirius. The library. Is a fucking dream. When I die, bury me in that library, please.</p><p> </p><p>You made orange juice? Without magic? I can see you covered with juice - even in your eyes, and screaming ’BURNS! PRONGS HELP ME! I'M DYING!’</p><p>I know, it's pretty accurate.</p><p>You drama queen.</p><p> </p><p>I'll send you a photo of Adolf. While I was taking it, he kept saying ‘NEIN! NEIN! NEIN!’. It's weird, isn't it? So you think I need to call an exorcist? Do you know a cheap one?</p><p>I'll also send you the cookies - with chocolate chips, that I made with my very own hands, and they are delicious. Believe me. They are delicious.</p><p> </p><p>I'm reading a new book now, Dogsbody.</p><p>The plot is:</p><p>‘The Dog Star, Sirius, is tried for murder by his heavenly peers and found guilty. His sentence: to be reborn on Earth as a dog.’</p><p>Brilliant, isn't it?</p><p> </p><p>Quote of the day:</p><p>‘And when the event, the big change in your life, is simply an insight - isn't that a strange thing? That absolutely nothing changes except that you see things differently and you're less fearful and less anxious and generally stronger as a result: isn't amazing that a completely invisible thing in your head can feel realer than anything you've experienced before? You see things more clearly and you know that you are seeing them more clearly.’</p><p> </p><p>I'm happy too, today. I figured out something in my head - something that scared me, and I accepted it. I have only to deal with it for the rest of my life, but it's okay, it is not a bad thing.</p><p> </p><p>I love you.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Moony.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Dearest Moonypie,</p><p> </p><p>You look stunning - the pink of the flowers on your sandy hair look amazing, you're almost unreal. Like: I stared at that photo for 300 million years, and then I had to find a proper frame and hang it. It's actually on my nightstand right now, you're way too beautiful Moony.</p><p> </p><p>I loved the cookies, almost as much as the photo - well not really, the photo is unbeatable; but I did learn to never disrespect chocolate again. A wise man warned me, with an almost scary fervor.</p><p> </p><p>I SAW THE DAMN FISH REMUS: HE DIDN'T DESERVE IT! He looks like a fine, blameless, good fish. I do admit that you can see a slight resemblance to that Nazi bitch - but only because you pointed it out! I would have never seen it! Poor little guy, really.</p><p> </p><p>I'm happy you liked the library, maybe one day you can see for yourself - I'm going back there soon, I have to see this book of yours with my own eyes. Dogsbody - puff! It can't be real.</p><p> </p><p>We helped Mr. Potter fix the roof today - with magic of course, but we still had to do a lot of things. And at some point me and Prongs decided to find out who could lift more bricks barehanded - It was not me, but I will get my revenge. Mom took a photo of us, at that point I was already pouting and Prongs was smiling like the idiot he is - don't mind the sweat and the lack of shirts, mom says we look manly.</p><p> </p><p>This summer - with long, happy days and smiles, and letters from you - almost feels like it doesn't even come from the same book. Like my whole life was in one book, chapter after chapter till the start of this summer, and then the author wrote this one, only to realise it didn't really fit with the rest. Maybe, it really could be the first chapter of a whole new book - sometimes having closed the first one seems unreal.</p><p> </p><p>I'm still sweaty and shirtless, and the sun is going down, and I already finished your cookies but I'm still hungry. So shower and dinner might be a good idea.</p><p> </p><p>Still looking at your beauty &amp; still amazed by it, loving you more and more every time I look at it</p><p> </p><p>Your Loving Padfoot.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Paddy,</p><p>I'm drunk, like no drunk drunk drunk, but drunk drunk. Drunk enough. Enough drunk to be drunk.</p><p>And I'm so happy, soooo sooooooo happy. Can you see my happiness? Of course you caaaan!</p><p> </p><p>Sirius, Padfoot, Pads, Paddy, Siriiiii, how handsome and wonderful and beautiful you are in this photo! Like so so so beautiful. How can you be so white? And your skin so perfect? You look like a porcelain doll.</p><p> </p><p>Can I brush your hair? I'd like to brush your hair. Save me Paaaaaddyyyyy!</p><p> </p><p>Start your new book with me, Pads. We can write all the chapters together. Do you want to write them with me? We can also give names to each chapter, like:</p><p>1st chapter - Sirius and Remus</p><p>2nd chapter - Moony and Padfoot</p><p>3rd chapter - Siri and Remi</p><p>4th chapter - Pads and Moons</p><p>5th chapter - Sirius e Moony</p><p>5th chapter - Paddy e Remus</p><p>And sooo many other chapters.</p><p>Yes! YES! Do you like them?</p><p> </p><p>You are still shirtless? Really? Shirtless shirtless? Oh my God! You want me dead. Be honest. You are so damn hot! Fucking hot!</p><p> </p><p>Now wait. I'm going to find a quote of the daaaay. Wait for me. Never let it be said that drunk Remus is not a good Remus. Drunk Remus is always a good Remus.</p><p>Here I am again. The quote of the day:</p><p>‘Come, gentle night. Come, loving, black-browed night. Give me my Romeo and - when I shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night.’</p><p> </p><p>I have already told you that you are beautiful? So beautiful, Paddy. Beautiful like no one. Beautiful like the stars. You are a star, don't you? The most beautiful and bright star of the sky and the world and the universe. Beautiful like I can't look at you too much. Beautiful like all the beautiful things in the world. Beautiful beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>And I love you because you are Sirius. How can I not love you? You are you!</p><p> </p><p>Miss you Paddy, so so so so much.</p><p>Always, but always always, yours,</p><p>Remus.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Moooooony,</p><p> </p><p>Oh Sweet Merlin, what the fuck, I can't stop laughing. I've got cramps, Moony - but I still can't stop. James definitely thinks I finally got to the deep end, but I really genuinely can not stop laughing. Remus you’re killing me here, with laughter induced belly cramps. Oh Merlin, that was simply gold.</p><p> </p><p>First things first: IT'S A FISH MOONY! IT CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO YOU! IT PHYSICALLY CANNOT DO SHIT!</p><p>So even in the remote possibility that your fish became sentient enough to have homicidal thoughts about you, it COULDN'T ANYTHING ABOUT IT! A fish has no way to harm you: you are human, superior intelligence and actually able to live outside of a water bawl, what the fuck - and let's not even consider how much of a threat that nazi fish could even be once a month, lets not. THE FISH CAN'T KILL YOU!</p><p> </p><p>So, yes. I've laughed for two thousand years about that fish of yours. I'm actually still laughing - James might be a tiny bit offended, since I won’t show him the letter.</p><p>(Don't worry, your rather embarrassing fear of nazi fishes is safe with me)</p><p> </p><p>Damn, Moony, I’m hot? Really, am I hot? Merlin, I can't stop blushing - don't laugh, okay? Being called hot it's kind of… I don't know. Third year chicks whisper I'm hot when I pass them, I guess. But that’s different? They don't know me, you know. Most of the time they just annoy me - all the time, actually.</p><p> </p><p>Okay, listen: there's something I want to ask you? No, there’s something I want - I have to - say. It's important, but also weird - and I don't want you to hate me, and no one else can know. But I have to, I need to say it.</p><p>Here we go: I don't think I like girls. Like, I don't find them hot. At all. I kissed a couple, snogged a couple but it didn't really mean anything - I don't think I felt what I was supposed to feel: I liked it okay, but I wasn't … really into it?</p><p> </p><p>(I don't know, my head is fucked up - if it freaks you out, ignore it. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. Just ignore it, okay?)</p><p> </p><p>Why were you so shitfaced anyway? Aren't you at home with your parents? Are you actually to an illegal rave in the worst farms of Wells? What happened to your innocence Moony?</p><p> </p><p>Thanking you for the once-in-a-lifetime laugh &amp; and hoping to find you sober, always yours</p><p> </p><p>Pads.</p><p align="center">_______________________</p><p> </p><p>Sirius,</p><p>I don't remember almost anything of what I wrote to you in my last letter, but I can surely say you almost died from laughing. This hangover is killing me. My head is going to explode in a hundred pieces. I have never been so wasted in my entire life, never.</p><p> </p><p>Basically, I was having dinner with mum and dad, and they were shouting at each other, and that red wine was so good. Since they didn't want me to talk or try to calm them down, I stayed there watching them yell and drinking wine. From that terrible headache I have, I can tell you - with absolute clarity, they fought for a very long time.</p><p>And of course dad blamed me. Like always.</p><p> </p><p>You don't even know how many ways a fish has to kill a man. Adolf could compel me with his pretty face to stick my head into his water bubble and drown me. Or he could communicate telepathically with all his fish friends and do an ambush to me. Or he could bring a knife from the kitchen and stab me. He could - he can, kill me and I am afraid. Stop making a fool out of me, really, it's not fun. At all.</p><p> </p><p>On my desk I found Romeo and Juliet opened. I think I wrote you a quote from it. The quote was totally out of context, wasn't it?</p><p> </p><p>Sirius, I'm glad you decided to tell me this. It didn't freak me out, really. I think it is normal, you know, some people like boys and some people like girls. You can be with anyone you want, because I only want you to be happy. It's this the only thing that matters. If you are happy then I am happy. I know it is not easy in these times to be a man who likes men, I think you know it, and I think it is the reason why you didn't tell your doubts sooner. But I understand you and I am with you, no matter what.</p><p>I won't tell anyone about this. If you want to keep it secret because you're not ready yet to tell, then I get it. But if you don't want to tell this because you are ashamed, then no, you don't have to be ashamed of anything. You are not wrong and you will never be. You are just you, you are just Sirius - my Sirius. Nothing has changed.</p><p> </p><p>The quote of the day:</p><p>‘My skin is kind of sort of brownish pinkish yellowish white. My eyes are greyish blueish green, but I'm told they look orange in the night. My hair is reddish blondish brown, but its silver when its wet, and all the colors I am inside have not been invented yet.’</p><p> </p><p>I miss you so much, hot boy.</p><p>I love you. Yours,</p><p>Remus.</p>
