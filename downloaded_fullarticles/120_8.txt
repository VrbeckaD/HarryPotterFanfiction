  <b> Muggle Movements<br/>by Isa Stevens </b>
</p><p>Greetings wixen! Due to current events, the Daily Prophet has seen fit to introduce this new article series, <i> Muggle Movements </i>. The purpose of this series is to dive into whatever parts of muggle culture readers desire! We intend to do so both by answering reader questions that can be mailed in to <i> Muggle Movements </i> at <i>The Daily Prophet</i>, and all questions will be considered for this article. If the asker does not give express permission for a name to be used in the article, then the question will be marked as anonymous. </p><p>This series is in response to a number of Statute of Secrecy infractions in recent weeks (See pages five and six), particularly the hedgehog incident. These incidents, ranging from social gaffs on the part of wixen to all out assault, have caused the Ministry’s Office of Muggle Affairs to do an audit of Muggle Studies curriculum. Such audits typically happen every decade, however, it was revealed that such audits have recommended an overhaul of the Muggle Studies curriculum for over a century. Unfortunately, terrorist elements in our Ministry suppressed this information. Investigations reveal this was in order to create more cultural distance between the core of wizarding society and the muggle-raised students, widening the gap that Voldemort’s rhetoric depended upon to maintain his forces. This resulted in entire generations entirely uninformed about the realities of muggles, their society, and their life, and have caused numerous breaches of the statute of secrecy, both major and minor. </p><p>While the muggle studies curriculum is being comprehensively reformed at the school level, there remains the fact that most adult wixen are unsure about muggle environments at best, and unknowingly putting the SoS in critical danger on a regular basis at worst. Further, it creates rifts within our own community that allow deplorable movements such as the Death Eaters to take root and terrorize our fine citizens. </p><p>Therefore, it is not only from the interest of making up for the harm caused by the followers of Voldemort that still ring true in our society, but from an interest of ensuring such unconscionable movements never take root in our society again. </p><p>This article will be run on a regular basis in order to help bridge this gap and repair the damage done by a century of misinformation. Currently, we look to publish this article with our Saturday edition, although the production of this series may be lessened or increased depending upon public interest and research times. </p><p>I look forward to hearing the kinds of questions wixen would like answered!</p>
