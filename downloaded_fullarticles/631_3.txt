    <p>Charlus Took one last puff  from his cigarette Before crashing the butt with his boot. What was it with the psychos ?He wondered. Every bloody year Some dumbass tried to kill his baby brother, He was starting to think the forces of evil Would never get the message. After he kicked out last one , into a volcano . </p><p> </p><p>The message was simple. You  go near Harry,  you die. Rather messily , loudly,  And painfully. At the hand of his big brother. </p><p>The magical world may call Harry the boy who lived, But they called his big brother the executioner. Charlus Potter,  Though still young Was not a man to be trifled with. </p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore did more than drop Harry Off at the Dursley’s door that night. He tore him away from his big brother. It was something Charlus would never forget , or forgive.</p><p>Charlus was the eldest son of the Potter family, arrogant, Mildly temperamental, A brutal beater For the Gryffindor Quidditch team until the twins popped up last year. Now he was lead Chaser. He was top of his year in Defense, Arithmency , and Ancient Runes . With an ambition To be a Curse Breaker After graduation. </p><p>He was also an impatient big brother. Dumbledore had kept him away from Harry for the last 11 years. He had tried time and again To contact his  brother , But they all had failed Owls  returned to sender, floo calls Went without answer. Hell he even tried The Muggle telephone, Aunt Petunia at least remembered, She’s been short and cool But she’d  kept him updated. Her content for magic had been audible on that call and everyone since. But she’s taken mercy on him, Her eldest nephew, The son that was old enough to remember his mother. He has been smart enough on that first call to claim he had no magic, Aunt Petunia seemed relieved And more willing to talk to him after that. She refused to let him talk to Harry , But she Had  at least told him he was all right , Interspersed with complaints about Harry’s freakishness an odd bouts of magic. He had nearly thrown  on the phone At the wall When she let slip he slept under the stairs in a cupboard. Charlus Had promised himself he would rectify that.  But his Aunt For some reason maybe a longing for her sister Continued to answer every time he called, She would speak to him Every time and every time she would refuse to get Harry  the line. </p><p>Every time with the same answer when I asked why,  Dumbledore’s letter said they should communicate for Harry’s protection. After every call His aunt seemed  more doubtful That this was the case. Petunia may despise magic, But that lie about him being Muggle may have just been his saving grace, If for whatever reason Dumbledore was able to keep him from interacting with harry  at school.  He might just be able to convince aunt petunia to give harry the line This next summer time. </p><p>But that was beside the point. As he leaned against the wall having snuffed out his cigarette , He waited Outside the platform for his brother’s arrival. He wouldn’t let that bearded bastard keep him from his little brother any longer, It was about bloody time Harry knew he wasn’t the last Potter alive. Charlus let Thought stew while his best mate Oliver Wood Started to Prattle About  Quidditch this year, How they desperately needed a new seeker. Wasn’t that taking the piss. They had three on the team last year,  With two of them and reserve But since Charlie Graduated the year before with Hopkins and Pratt . They went from a surplus To a desperate  need for another.</p><p>There  he was as Charlus spotted  to flash of black , The same color as their father’s . Charlus has  made sure to memorize every photo in the family scrapbook, On the off chance Harry looked more like an ancestor then their parents. He didn’t want to miss his baby brother. </p><p>As the meters between them came to a close, Charlus Looked  to his right And said to Oliver. “ I see him, mate . I see my brother.”</p>
