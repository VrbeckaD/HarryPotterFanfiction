    <p>This is the eighth time the man has come to the pond, gazing wistfully at the water with such a distressed expression.</p>
<p>Steve’s had enough of it.</p>
<p>He drifts over to him and waits til the man looks up from the water to him. “You’ve seem troubled the countless times you’ve come to this pond. Is there something I could do? The water is perfect and I would gladly aid you in swimming in it.” The man gives Steve a sad smile as he gently shakes his head.</p>
<p>“I wish I could but if I were to swim now i’d probably drown. Thank you though for the offer.” The man dips his head in thanks then gives Steve a ghost of a smile. “I’m James but I go by Bucky.”</p>
<p>Steve ruffled his feathers then tilts his head. “You said ‘now’ meaning you could at a different time?”</p>
<p>Bucky just shrugs. “Well my uncle stole and hid my sealskin so for now i’m landbound.”</p>
<p>The anger that overcomes Steve is so powerful it makes him shift to his human form. “HE DID WHAT!” Bucky stares at the swan-turned-man in shock at his outrage, Steve’s oblivious of it as he starts treading to the grassy bank.</p>
<p>“NAT GET EVERYONE WE’RE GOING TO GO FIGHT SOMEONE.” He yells over his shoulder and the other swans make their way towards them.</p>
<p>“Steve for the love of god who is it this time?”</p>
<p>When the water starts to cover less and less of what Bucky is now realizing, is a very naked Steve, he scrambles to take his shirt off and throws it at Steve’s head. The abrupt loss of his vision makes Steve lose his footing and he falls back into the water. He quickly resurfaces and glares at Bucky.</p>
<p>“Man what the hell?”</p>
<p>“You’re naked!” Bucky yells back with a hand covering his face.</p>
<p>The realization dawns on Steve and he grabs the now wet shirt. “Oh right sorry I forgot.”</p>
<p>“How the hell do you forget!”</p>
<p>“I was mad.” Steve says matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>The shirt is snatched from his hands by a now human Natasha. “I’ll take that, humans seem to be offended by female breasts. I’m not sure why, mine are perfect.” Steve makes a noise of agreement as he swims over to the hidden space they put clothes.</p>
<p>“Oh god there’s more.” Bucky bemoans under his breath. As he removes his hand to see four new people naked in the pond, one woman wearing his shirt and the other simply using her hands to cover her chest.</p>
<p>“Steve grab me that one shirt I like.” The fully naked woman lifts her hands to stretch and Bucky covers his face again. “I- lady I know i’m part selkie and am used to nudity, but it’s been a handful of years so i’m not used to it anymore.”</p>
<p>One of the other men, one that for some reason had colored hair, makes a loud dramatic sigh. “You all know we can make clothes appear on our skin, stop scaring the poor man.” Bucky removes his hand again to see the woman with his shirt, Nat he recalls, standing in front of him. She smiles at him now fully dressed in different clothes. “Here’s your shirt back.”</p>
<p>“So someone stole your skin and you’ve said it’s been a couple of years.” Her eyes go to Steve before flicking back to him. “Don’t let Steve know that just yet or he won’t try the ‘civil way’ first.”</p>
<p>Bucky just nods.</p>
<p>“I’m Natasha. The other woman is Beverly, the man she’s poking and who’s glaring at her for it is Will. The sparkly guy is Magnus.” She stretches and casts her eyes back at the pond. “Percy, Finn you going to join us?” The two swans nod their heads and head for land, the latter deciding to stay in his animal forms.</p>
<p>Beverly appears next to Natasha and winks at him. “Nice to finally put a name to a face! Oh should I ask the love birds or let them be?” She voices her question to Natasha who shrugs. “Sure why not, those two are a pretty good team.” Beverly twirls around and cups her hands around her mouth. “HEY DESTIEL GET YOUR ASSES OUT HERE.”</p>
<p>A loud hissing reaches them before two swans launch into the air and shift once their feet touch land.</p>
<p>“Bev why do you call us that weird nickname?” Dean has his arms crossed with Castiel’s arm wrapped around his waist. “Dude for the last time it’s a ship name and this ship is canon!”</p>
<p>Bucky stares at all of them, a little astonished that everyone looks fit and bulk enough to pop his head of with one squeeze of their arms. Then he sees Steve and almost has a stroke.  </p>
<p>Will eyes Bucky then gives him an awkward pat on the shoulder. “He’s single.” Bucky looks to him but Will is staring at the treeline then frowns and walks closer to the trees.</p>
<p>“I’m not having a repeat of last week Stag! You better leave me alone or you’re going to actually lose that leg this time!” He yells as a large stag breaks through the treeline and stops to stand proudly before Will. Will’s glare darkens as he shifts and charges the stag until the two disappear into the surrounding forest, noises of a fight fading away.</p>
<p>“Well looks like we lost Will again.” Percival comments as he adjusts his clothes. “So this uncle?”</p>
<p>Bucky turns his attention to him, face still a mask of shock. “Did he just… take on a fucking stag?”</p>
<p>Percival just rolls his eyes. “Yes and those two will probably end up doing both because they’re them but Hannibal will join us if we end up killing your uncle, he has a certain… taste for things.”</p>
<p>“Percy we’re not killing anyone.” Steve interjects. “You know how I feel about-” “Well you might because i’m not the only one he’s done this to before. Hell if i’ve only been there for six years who knows how many other’s Pierce has done this to.” Steve stares at Bucky.</p>
<p>“LECTER YOU COME HERE RIGHT NOW AND TAKE ME TO THIS SCUMBAG!”</p>
<p>The stag appears a couple of seconds later a little battered and bleeding from some bite marks but looks unaffected as he goes to tilts his head to sniff the air then starts walking.</p>
<p>The others follow behind him, a fully clothed Will appearing by Bucky’s side with his hair a mess and some blood smeared on his cheek. Bucky refrains from asking about it.</p>
<p>After what Bucky determines to be about halfway there, Hannibal shifts to his human form, one of his hands open at his side halting their little army.</p>
<p>A large black wolf appears from behind a bush and sits before them. “Are we trespassing?” The wolf stares at him before shaking his head. “A friend said you are going after the man who traps our kind. He’s taken one of mine and I wish to help you.” Hannibal looks back to Steve then Will. They both nod. “Very well. Do you know the way or should I continue to lead?” “I know the way.” The wolf turns and starts walking, Hannibal falling back to be near Will. Will glares at him but accepts the hand he has open and Hannibal lick the blood from his cheek. Will just rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>Bucky feeling a little creeped and as if he’s intruding, moves to be next to Steve and Natasha. Steve is eyeing the wolf as he leads them. “I’m Steve.” “Derek.” the wolf answers. “It seems you know more about what we’re heading into.” Natasha voices to which Derek hums. “There is another man that works with Pierce, a man named Gerard. He likes hunting my kind, almost killed my original pack before I was of age to leave and create my own.”</p>
<p>“Does this mean I can cook a feast?” Hannibal asks from behind them. Derek looks to him in question. Will gives him a placid look. “He has an odd pleasure in cooking special meat.” Hannibal seems to preen at Will’s admission and nuzzles his face. “Will you finally let me treat you? I have this one recipe from a man who tried to cheat me in-” “Not yet.” Will answers.</p>
<p>Derek’s large shoulders shrug at the interaction. “We have a couple more miles to go. Do you have a plan?”</p>
<p>Steve sighs. “Well I was going to see if they would see reason first-” Both Derek and Bucky rolls their eyes. “-but I think this time it’s a ‘hit first ask questions later’ situation.” Derek nods in agreement. “My pack will aid you.”</p>
<p>Bucky takes a second to look around and see all these people around him in slight disbelief.   </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Steve was the first one to throw a punch at some guard saunting over to them, the guy not even having enough time to say something before he’s out cold on the floor.</p>
<p>The fight is short and bloody. Not all but most of the people fighting against them are either zombies, yes literal zombies the poor things, or the others actually enjoyed and took pleasure in having power over others.</p>
<p>Both Will and Hannibal are drenched in blood settled next together in their animal forms watching their surroundings incase they missed anyone, a quiet duckling barely visible between them.</p>
<p>Derek and his pack are tending to most of the shifters creating a barrier around them, Bucky going through them to make sure they got everyone. Derek found not one but two packmates, two sisters that Bucky always saw with fire in their eyes and claws out ready to fight. There weren’t that many people taken, thankfully less than thirty shifters but that’s still too many for anyone’s liking. Most were orphans or runaways and a few who just were in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>Dean, Castiel, Natasha and Magnus did one last check of the large warehouse, grabbing any and all things that would be useful, before regrouping with the others.</p>
<p>The idea of burning the warehouse down was floated around but instead of destroying the place they could clean it up and use it for something better, though if nothing came out of keeping it then they would burn it. Percival, Dean, and Will seemed a little to satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<p>Once all the zombie and non-zombie guards were disposed of by Percival, Dean, and Will the only ones left were Peirce and Gerard who just so happened to both be present during the surprise invasion.</p>
<p>Both men are hog tied and glaring everyone down but every shifter can smell the fear pouring off them.</p>
<p>Pierce's eyes catch Bucky and he gives his <em> nephew </em> a pleading look. “James i’m your fam-” He’s cut off by Bucky. “You know that’s a damn lie so stop trying to push it.” He walks over and pushes this vile man on his back with his foot, lifting it to press on Pierce’s windpipe just enough to make him wheeze. “You’ve kept me here for years, trying to do tests and harming all these innocent people for some sick scientific obsession to ‘better understand shifter’ but you just wanted play things.” Bucky’s foot is moved by the stupid magic that binds them together.</p>
<p>“I may not be able to kill you but by some insane miracle I found some people that might. I hope you rot in hell.”</p>
<p>Derek walks over and shifts to his human form, his sisters and another member doing the same. They stand before Gerard who’s started struggling to get out of his bonds, the sinking feeling of what’s to come making him desperate. “You know what you’ve done and you deserve something worse than this but at least it’ll be by our hand.”</p>
<p>The two men are dragged deeper into the forest to be out of earshot for the younger ones. Bucky feels it the second he’s free and leans into Steve; his solid weight is grounding.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Aside from Laura and Cora, out of the twenty-seven shifters they freed nine came back to the pond with them. The others either left to go back where they came from, some given supplies or directions while some simply said their thanks and name before disappearing into the forest.</p>
<p>Derek and his pack give their goodbyes but they all agree to stay in touch since their forests neighboring each other.</p>
<p>The new additions are three ducks, two stags, two foxes, a wolf, and another selkie.</p>
<p>It’ll take some time for everyone to settle in but now there’s a sense of peace, of freedom.</p>
<p>Bucky thinks everyone will be okay, even him if Steve’s constant concern and contact mean something. He’s happy he found this random pond that had a very angry swan in it. Bucky’s really happy he found this very angry swan. A soft look Steve keeps sending him says he’s not to upset either  at having a depressed selkie randomly appear.</p>
