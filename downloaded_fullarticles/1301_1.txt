    <p>Okay so... We need to start at the beginning.</p><p>My name is Diamond Madelyn Danson, otherwise known by Diamond McGlynn starting 1975.</p><p>I come from the year 2038 and was twenty-nine there. I have mid back length brown hair, usually in a messy braid and blue eyes. I usually wear some Muggle clothes, specifically blue jeans, a T-shirt and a jacket. I can be found being a sarcastic little snake or making you laugh to lighten the day.</p><p>I was an orphan at a young age, possible Muggle-born Slytherin. Everyone I was close to is dead thanks to the third Wizarding War, and the Ministry was one of the last places standing after we took it back as a safe house. Y'see, apparently Bellatrix Lestrange and Old Voldy had a kid before they died. This kid grew up and started the third Wizarding War by gaining followers like their father did.</p><p>This time though, the Wizarding World got revealed to the Muggles after Voldy junior blew up this clock tower, Big Ben. Yeah, so most the Muggles weren't too keen on helping us anytime soon... I couldn't blame them, I'd probably of been the same if I was in their situation. But they were going a bit over the top in my opinion.</p><p>That pretty much brings us to now, where we're being hunted down by Muggles and attacked by Voldy junior. We're fighting off Voldy junior best we can and keep moving our other safe houses so the Muggles don't get us, but we've lost too many people to count.</p><p>Does anyone know how to kill a Dementor? That could be very, very helpful for us. We can't cast patronuses while simultaneously battling three dark wizards and a dozen Muggles all at once, which I'm glad we don't have to do often but still.</p><p>We were losing and there was no sign of us winning, so Harry Potter gave me a mission.</p><p>Anyway, now that you know what's going on better, on with the story from the beginning.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p>  </p><p>"Ms. Diamond, Harry Potter would like to speak to Ms. Diamond in Mr. Potters office." Splinky, a house elf with big dark blue eyes in a plain light blue dress said, coming up to Diamond who was playing Exploding Snap with some of the younger people.</p><p>"Thank you Splinky, I'll be right there." Diamond said, she turned back to the others she was playing with "you have been spared this time." She hissed, fake glaring at them. They laughed and she chuckled as she walked away to Harry's office.</p><p>When she arrived, Harry Potter was sitting at his desk with his hands folded, chin resting on top. "Ah, Diamond, you're here." He said, sitting up. Harry Potter was around forty, with shoulder length messy black hair and emerald green eyes with circular glasses.</p><p>Diamond nodded, "you wanted to see me about something?" She said.</p><p>"Yes. It's very important. A mission, of sorts." Harry said. Diamond nodded slowly, telling him to continue. "Hermione has created an object that could fix everything, and we thought you would be the best suited for the task." He said.</p><p>Diamond's eyes widened, "fix everything? What exactly do you mean by that?" She asked. "I mean stop the third Wizarding War from even starting, maybe even the second Wizarding War." Harry said.</p><p>"Wait the second war? How? And why me?" Diamond said.</p><p>"The object is a special type of time turner, the only one of it's kind. One spin goes back a year. But it can only go back seventy years, seventy spins." Harry said.</p><p>"You want me to go back in time and fix stuff." Diamond said her realization bluntly.</p><p>Harry nodded, "if you except, that is." He said.</p><p>"But why me?" She asked.</p><p>"Lets be honest here," Harry started. "Albus isn't going near this thing, Lily would go crazy and wouldn't be able to make it there by herself. And same with any others I can think of and Hermione is needed here. But you, you're Diamond, you've been through a lot and I would understand if you refuse. But you know all the stories of my time at Hogwarts, of everything, thanks to James and your own snooping. You're an excellent witch. You're the perfect one for the job." Harry said.</p><p>Diamond thought about it, what was there for her here? Almost everyone she was close to was dead... James, Hugo, Roxanne, Sam and Olive among them and others. If she stayed, there would just be more deaths.</p><p>But if she went, she could fix that, bring them back.</p><p>"I accept." She said.</p><p>Even if they don't remember her.</p><p>Harry nodded, he opened one of his desk drawers and pulled out a time turner, but silver with purple sand. "So, the full effects of using this time turner is that, once you pass thirty-five years, you will start aging backwards by one year every two spins. Don't ask me how Hermione figured that, some time-sand stuff I think." Harry said.</p><p>Diamond nodded. "How far back will I be going?" She asked.</p><p>"I'm not exactly sure, I thought well, uh.. Maybe we cold figure that out right now." Harry shrugged. Diamond rolled her eyes smiling and took a seat in the chair in font of Harry's desk.</p><p>"So if I'm gonna be going back more then thirty-five years, lets start with that." Diamond started.</p><p>"Going back thirty-five, you'll be in the year 2003." Harry said, she nodded.</p><p>"That's far back enough to possibly stop the third war, but I don't think it will be." Diamond said. Harry nodded, "we have to stop it at the source, Hel-"</p><p>"Voldy junior." Diamond said.</p><p>Harry nodded, used to her interruptions to add nicknames, "yes, we must stop them from ever gaining power." He said.</p><p>"So, if Voldy junior is Voldy senior and Bellatrix Lestrange's kid, I need to stop those two from ever getting together." Diamond said. Harry sighs, "to do that you'll have to go back to at least 1996." He said.</p><p>"I'll be... Twenty-five then, I think." She said.</p><p>"But then you can't go to that time, the Ministry would catch you, not to mention the Pink Toad." Harry groans in exasperationm "so, I'll have to go back even farther." Diamond also sighed, resting her head on her hand.</p><p>This continued for a half hour until they reached their conclusion.</p><p>"Okay, so, I guess I'll have to go to 1975." Diamond said. "I'll stop the third and second Wizarding War, destroy any horcruxes I can get my hands on, rewriting history a lot." Diamond said.</p><p>"You'll also be a fifteen or fourteen year old while none of us are even born." Harry said. Diamond nodded sadly, looking down.</p><p>"It's worth it." She said. Harry sighed, "pack what you'll be bringing and meet back here. Tell anyone you'll be leaving if you want, you most likely won't see us for a long time." Harry said. Diamond nodded, got up and left the office to pack.</p><p>'I <em>will</em> fix things' she thought.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Diamond had packed all she would be bringing, which wasn't much. Consisting of some clothes she transfigured for the correct time period. She also tossed on her leather jacket for warmth, packed a few personal belongings and the necklace she was given by her parents before they died. Along with a small but thick brown book full of photos from throughout her life. She beforehand had put a spell on it, making it impossible to open without a password. Diamond still knew it was dangerous to bring something like that, but she does it anyway.</p><p>She contemplated saying goodbye to the others, but what would be the point if there was a likely chance she wouldn't ever speak to them again? Besides, she didn't know if she'd be able to leave if she saw their faces. So Diamond returned to Harrys' office, she's handed the time turner and looped the silver time necklace around her neck.</p><p>"Remember, sixty-five spins." Harry said.</p><p>"Sixty-three, actually." Diamond corrected, "a-ah, right.." Harry coughs "so, got all you're bringing?" Diamond nodded.</p><p>"Good." Harry fixed his glasses, "and uh, Diamond?" She looked back up from inspecting the time turner with a hum, "I'll miss you." Harry gave a smile.</p><p>Probably the last like it she would see for a long time.</p><p>Diamond smiled back, "I'll miss you too." She turns back to the time turner and starts to spin it. Just before the world started to blur around her, she caught the tail end of Harry murmur a "good luck, Diamond." Then she was gone from her time.</p>
