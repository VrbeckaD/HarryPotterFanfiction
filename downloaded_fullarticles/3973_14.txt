    <p><em> You’re supposed to have your crisis during freshman year,</em> George reflects. He supposes he’s just doing what he always does, though — breaking the rules.</p><p>Of course, rule-breaking is really only fun with a partner in crime, and he hasn’t got one anymore. Because, apparently Fred is no longer interested in being his brother-and-best-friend; now, he’d rather just be George’s brother.</p><p>He’s always been one of a set of two, half of a dynamic duo, the George of Fred-and-George fame. When your set of two’s been split up, your duo is just an uno, and somehow that just doesn’t have the same appeal.</p><p>He does understand what Fred wants, though, contrary to popular (Ron and Percy’s) belief. They were never given a chance to be an individual — rather, together they comprised one individual. And now that Fred’s got a boyfriend and a job and friends of his own, he wants to take that chance, to <em> be</em> an uno.</p><p>It’s just not exactly what George wants. But he’s always been a little too dependent on Fred, he’ll admit. It’ll be good for him to be away from his twin awhile, to make friends without the influence of his more sociable brother. Maybe this year, he’ll even orchestrate some solo pranks — big ones. Or he’ll focus on class (he does need to graduate).</p><p>Yes, Fred’s abandonment really is a blessing in disguise, and George is really taking a very mature line on the whole thing. So this is hardly a crisis at all, right?</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“This is a crisis!” a girl wails. George can’t see her or her breakdown, but with his luck she’ll be in his dorm. Move-in day is ridiculous, but at least he’s not a freshman anymore. The sun beats down on his back as he lugs his suitcase up the pathway, and he wonders how this can possibly be the same Boston that nearly gave him pneumonia last winter.</p><p>He pushes his way through the entry hall, nodding to a few familiar faces and dodging conversation with Oliver Wood, who’s no doubt equipped with another diagram for preseason practice. As he makes his way to the basement — of course he’s in the fucking basement— he can’t help but roll his eyes at the cutesy door decorations he passes. No doubt this year’s RA will be obsessed with <em> floor bonding </em> and <em> forming a community</em>, as if anyone actually wants to be best friends with their floormates.</p><p>He stops outside room 008, which has a bright blue piece of construction paper on the door that reads <em> George! </em> The lowercase G is shaped like an umbrella with glittery raindrops around it, and he almost wants to laugh.</p><p>He shoves his key into the lock, and pushes the door open with his shoulder. Just as it begins to swing shut behind him, a “Hello!” rings out from the hall. Spinning around, he finds himself face to face with a <em> tiny </em> girl. For a moment, he assumes she’s a lost freshman, but then he takes in the nametag on her shirt, which says <em> RA (y/n)</em> in the same handwriting on his door decoration.</p><p>“You must be George! I’ll be living across from you in room 007,” she says confidently. “How are you doing with moving in?”</p><p>George opens his mouth, then closes it. <em> Shit</em>, he thinks. <em> Shit, shit, shit. </em> He’s beginning to realize that, without Fred, he’s really not quite as magnetic as he’d thought he was. In fact, he’s noticing that without exception, Fred was always the one to first introduce them, and that there was a reason for that.</p><p>RA (y/n)'s still looking at him, though, waiting for an answer. Her face is set into a brilliant, beaming smile that he’s one hundred percent sure is fake, and used primarily for campus tours and student government.</p><p>“I’m doing good, yeah,” he replies, wincing at how weak his voice sounds. God, why does he sound so fucking timid? “Just, uh, going to bring in my sheets and stuff next.”</p><p>“Cool!” she replies, no doubt thankful to be done with the conversation. “Let me know if you need any help!”</p><p>With that, she turns away and starts walking briskly in the direction of a student who seems to be on the wrong floor, judging by the confusion on his face.</p><p>As George tugs the door shut behind him, he hears a yell from RA (y/n). “Don’t forget we have a floor meeting in an hour!”</p><hr/><p> The floor meeting is a joke. Out of their floor of thirty undergrads, seven show up, and one of the seven only seems to care about whether he has to observe quiet hours.</p><p>The guy (Cormac, George thinks his name is) seems like a nice enough dude though, so George walks over to where he’s interrogating some poor sophomore on his workout routine.</p><p>Maybe-Cormac breaks off his conversation to send George a small smirk, to which George replies, “Hey” because he’s apparently incapable of sounding interesting, which <em> must </em> be why Fred was the social twin.</p><p>Maybe-Cormac, thankfully, responds with a matching “Hey” and adds on, “So what’s the deal with the RA?”</p><p>“What?” George ever so eloquently replies.</p><p>“Dude, she’s like psychotic. Did you see the fucking door decs?”</p><p>George snorts, because <em> this </em> he can do. He can talk shit about people like <em> RA (y/n)</em> with their manufactured smiles and perfect manners and ten-year plans. Hell, he grew up taking the piss out of Percy, who, he reflects, would probably have been a great RA.</p><p>“Yeah, mine had fucking glitter on it,” he says, rolling his eyes.</p><p>Maybe-Cormac seems suitably impressed, groaning, “<em> Bro</em>, that’s —”</p><p>Whatever his door dec is or isn’t George never learns, because in bursts RA (y/n) herself, her megawatt grin firmly in place.</p><p>That smile, however, melts right off her face when she sees the meager group of kids, mostly sophomores or transfer students, sitting on the stained lounge couches.</p><p>“Where is everyone?” she demands, looking confused and not a little offended. “Wait, never mind, I’ll just get started and we can see if they show up.”</p><p>Visibly straightening her spine, she launches into her introductory spiel, beginning with “Hi everyone, I’m (y/n) and I’m your RA this year” as if that was a surprise to anyone. What is surprising, though, is what comes next.</p><p>“No offense, but I literally don’t care what you guys do in your rooms or about quiet hours or any of that shit. Also, you’re all at least nineteen, so you should know enough to not fuck up the bathrooms. Basically, I’m here to do damage control with your big messes, but y’all should, like, deal with your own little messes. We good?”</p><p>George is sure his eyes are wide and his mouth may be a little bit open, because he did <em> not </em> expect RA (y/n) to swear or roll her eyes or tell them to deal with their own problems. He thinks she notices this, because she sends him a glare that seems to scream <em> I’m not your fucking high school stereotype</em>, and God, that’s actually kind of hot, isn’t it?</p><hr/><p>So, yeah, he doesn’t have his brother, and, yeah, his one sort-of-friend so far looks like a failed frat bro, and, yeah, he might be a little attracted to his sort-of cute RA. So maybe, just maybe, this <em>is</em>, in fact, a crisis.</p>
