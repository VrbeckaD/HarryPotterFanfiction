    <p>hermione jean granger malfoy (41)</p>
<p>it was never hermione's plan to have seven children with her secondary school enemy.</p>
<p>at nineteen and fresh out of school, finding a job in a creatures rights office at the ministry, hermione granger, unmarried but engaged, was pregnant. she was but 11 weeks along upon learning she was pregnant with twins and her wedding was a month away. she squeezed into her wedding dress with a daughter and a son occupying her stomach. she was happily married to someone she thought she would hate for the rest of her life, draco malfoy. and his children grew healthy inside of her. on january 12th of 2000, rose alex and scorpius hyperion malfoy were born. rose was strikingly like her mother but with her father's blue eyes. scorpius was strikingly like his father but with his mother deep brown eyes. they left their lovely apartment to reside in the cute little house of 7842 appletree lane. </p>
<p>when the loves of her life were not yet one, but ten months old, hermione was thriving at her job supporting magical creatures, and her husbands start as a lawyer was really taking off, she experienced the most devistating moment of her life. she'd seen war and death, but watching and feeling her body bleed out as a child that she didn't even know she was carrying, died. what would've been her little boy became her little angel. and though she knew it would've been too soon to have another, as her children had yet to turn on one, she was still utterly devistated. </p>
<p>but still so, a month later, hermione was indeed, with a child. however she did not know until may of 2001 when she was already half way or more through her pregnancy, she told everyone. she knew that she wanted her children to be close in age so that they could be close, however, she had anticipated waiting until they were one to try to have another. however, hermione and draco were thrilled to have another addition. whether surprising or not, the happiest to hear the news of a new baby were ginny weasley, who was pregnant with her first, and even more so,  narcissa malfoy. narcissa had done her best in the war, after being manipulated by people she trusted, she still did her best to do what was right for her family. and once her husband had been imprisoned and her first grandchildren were born, she did everything she could for them. she spoiled them and read them stories and bought them clothes and toys. but she told hermione that she felt something special about this child. </p>
<p>on august 19th of 2001, hermione malfoy went into labor. the first to hold her was not her mother or father, but by request of the mother, her grandmother, narcissa malfoy. narcissa saw hermione as the daughter she never had, but now she saw this baby as the daughter she never had. and though she dearly loved her draco, she was excited to have a single little girl to spoil and be her lifetime best friend. and there and then, that is where hermione decided to name her love, narcissa jean malfoy. it paid tribute to both her mother and draco's. sometimes called nj for short, narcissa would live up to her namesake, but grandmother malfoy would always tell her granddaughter she was bolder than the original. </p>
<p>with rose and scorpius around age three and narcissa only getting closer to two, the malfoy parents had actually taken a break from having children. but before their lovelies got too old, hermione and draco had to make the decision as to whether they wanted more. draco knew that he wanted at least three as he grew up an only child with no siblings and minimal attention from his parents. he wished he had siblings his whole life. hermione, also raised an only child, knew that she wanted a big family of four or five children. it just seemed natural to her that she would have a lot of children with a nice house, a husband that she loved as well as a job she loved. draco agreed that this was completely reasonable. so, the two decided to try for another, hoping for another boy to perhaps make the numbers in the house even. this time though, they wanted to be surprised.</p>
<p>and they were happily surprised with the blessing of a beautiful baby by named rexous hysterio malfoy on july 14th, 2003. his papa, hermione's father, saw resembelence. with fluffy brown hair and blue eyes that he shared with his father and sister rose, who he also heavily resembled. </p>
<p>and there they went for three years without a baby and hermione and draco really thought they were done.</p>
<p>but when rose and scorpius were six, narcissa was five, and rex was three, hermione was once again, with a child. and she was eight months into her pregnancy. and other than a slight weight gain which she attributed to stress and missing a few periods which she didn't even realize, she felt the same. and it was only when she realized that she had missed one or two that she sat down with her best friend ginny and took the time to realize. ginny had also given birth to her final child, her daughter lily, a bit earlier that year. on december 7th of 2006, an early christmas present, cassidella molly malfoy was born. cassidella would be called cassie, and anyone calling her cassidella would pay. she was also destined to be best friends with lily luna potter. </p>
<p>and that was it.</p>
<p>or so they thought.</p>
<p>but they were destined for one last oopsie.</p>
<p>except that turned into two oopsies because it was twins again. and they kind of hope for two boys. but they felt no less love whent heir little girls were born on october fifth of 2011. kendall isadora malfoy and calli jade malfoy were opposites from birth. calli had her father's blue eyes and she was the only child to inherit nana granger's black hair. kendall had brown hair and her mothers deep brown eyes. though they didn't look or act alike, they had this push and pull. though they weren't expected, they completed the family. </p>
<p>and that brings us to present day. but its not really present day. its december 14th of 2022. kendall and calli have come home from their christmas break, of their first years of hogwarts. kendall of slytherin and calli of hufflepuff. they had their own friends and personalities, the whole family did. the younger twins were eleven, cassie was sixteen, rex was nineteen, narcissa was 21, and rose and scorpius were 22.</p>
<p>and rose, the official first born as the was born four minutes before her twin brother scorpius, had just announced that she was pregnant. </p>
