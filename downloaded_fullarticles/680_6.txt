    <p>For those who have read my other Were-Harry story, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to be updating it in the future. When I started writing it, I had all these ideas that I wanted to put in and have the story be about. Unfortunately, I ended up going way off what I wanted the story to be, and am now not liking where it has gone. So, I'm going to start over. If you've read the original, then pretty much everything from the first couple chapters will stay the same. This story starts out on the first full moon after Harry is turned, so it's his first turning. This is where I wanted to start in the original story, but I ended up getting sidetracked and it took 10 chapters for Harry to even be turned. So, yeah, I'm sorry if you wanted me to continue the original, but I wont.Â </p>
