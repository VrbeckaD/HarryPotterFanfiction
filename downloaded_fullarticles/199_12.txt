    <p>The summer was the kind of oppressive, sticky hot that would have been unbearable if Harry had been stuck anywhere else. He shuddered to think of the terror that Dudley and his friends were inflicting on the residents of Little Whinging. Thankfully, instead of dealing with whatever horror they might have come up with he was sat the small cafe, working on his summer homework (Snape had “helpfully” collected it for Harry from his fellow teachers), and working at Aren’s shop, organizing some of the chaos. He refused payment, insisting that he should be paying Aren and Charlie for the distraction. As wonderful as Spindleshaft Lane was it was hard being so cut off from the rest of the world. It was a larger, and far more pleasant confinement than his single, barred, room at the Dursley’s had ever been… but even with the warm cobblestone streets, the quiet conversation and laughter of the patrons, and the increased space… it was still a confinement. He had very clear boundaries on where he was allowed to go, and he was not permitted to go out of doors at night unless Snape was with him. He tried to be grateful, instead of focusing on all the ways it chaffed.</p>
<p>Snape had told him that Cedric was fine, his family was in seclusion somewhere… if Snape knew he was not divulging… and that he may not be at school the following year. Harry couldn’t blame them. He wasn’t sure how long Cedric had stuck around the graveyard, what all he’d seen. They hadn’t been friends before, and it seemed a little strange to send an owl now. He could just imagine what he’d write:</p>
<p>CEDRIC,</p>
<p>GLAD TO HEAR YOU ARE WELL. THANKS FOR RETURNING MY WAND. SO JUST HOW EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY SCARRED ARE YOU FROM WHAT YOU SAW?</p>
<p>HARRY</p>
<p>He didn’t have Draco or Blaise’s way with words, and communication from both of them had been scarce. Snape had explained why, and done his best to carry letters when he could. He knew why he couldn’t accompany Snape to any of the clandestine meetings that were taking place, and he tried not to be overly jealous of Draco living there, right in the middle of the action. Although from the sound of the handful of letters he had from Draco it sounded as though he wasn’t allowed to sit in on the meetings, and Lupin flatly refused to allow Sirius to give details. In a surprising twist… Snape had been rather forthcoming about the Order of the Phoenix.</p>
<p>It was, he’d explained the morning following their arrival at the flat, a society that had been formed during the first wizarding war. Dumbledore had formed it, although his involvement with the revival was extremely limited. Some Order members were in contact with him, like Arthur Weasley, but he (unlike his wife) was uncomfortable with some of the moves that the old wizard had been making. They met in London, in a large townhouse that had belonged to Sirius Black’s parents. They were busy trying to recruit, keep tabs on known Death Eaters, and protect those who might find themselves in harm’s way.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult,” Snape had explained, leaning back in his chair and sipping his tea, breakfast dishes still on the table. Harry appreciated that the man had waited no longer than necessary to fill him in. “No one wants to admit what’s going on, least of all the Ministry.”</p>
<p>“Dumbledore believes it at least? Can’t he convince them?” Harry asked, hating that it was possible the manipulative old bastard might be of some use.</p>
<p>Snape shook his head. “Fudge and Dumbledore have always had a rivalry. If Dumbledore wanted to be Minister of Magic, he could… and Fudge knows it.” He paused, considering his next words for a long moment, “And I’m not convinced Dumbledore is actively trying to convince them. Letting panic spread until he can step in ‘save the day’ and secure more power is a lot more his speed.”</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t help but agree, especially with knowing how Dumbledore had sat on the information about Sirius not being the Secret Keeper for so long. He couldn’t being to imagine what the man’s plan was, but he was certain he had one.</p>
<p>“The Dark Lord is keeping his head down. Not inactive… just not as noisy as I think he’d planned. You and Lucius escaping ruined his plans. No one was supposed to know until he was ready to move all at once. Now he has to rethink his strategy.”</p>
<p>Sipping at his own tea, Harry met Snape’s gaze and asked the one question on the forefront of his mind. “You’re going back… to spying… aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>Harry had almost wished the other man had lied to him. He didn’t want to think of what Snape was going to have to go through. It didn’t take a genius to guess that many of the members of the Order of the Pheonix were not entirely convinced as to Snape’s loyalty. He heard the way that the Gryffindors spoke about  their Potions Master. And the general attitude of the staff to allow it spoke volumes. Even as much as Harry knew it was part of the necessary disguise, he hated it, despite the protection it ultimately gave. The other man deserved better, especially from the so-called “good side”. </p>
<p>He wouldn’t admit it out loud, not even to Snape. That he had his serious doubts. Not that he, for a second, considered joining up with the Death Eaters, or thought their position had any merit. But from where Harry sat, curled up on a couch looking out over Muggle London still ablaze with light despite the fact it was nearly midnight, the only virtue of the other side was that it opposed the Dark Lord. Not, he was quick to argue even in his own mind, that this was a small thing. The Dark Lord needed defeating once and for all, and they needed all the allies they could get to do it. They just weren’t as pure and righteous as the storybooks always said the good guys were supposed to be. Being on the right side of this didn’t erase the prejudice, the bigotry, and other evils… Whether they wanted to admit it or not there was plenty of darkness to go around both sides. And that wasn’t how it was supposed to be.</p>
<p>Harry pulled his knees up closer to his chest, letting his thoughts tumble down their morose path as he heard the soft chime on the clocks announce it was his birthday. Snape was gone. He’d been summoned earlier that afternoon. There wasn’t time to waste when the Dark Lord called, not if he didn’t want to arouse suspicious, and Harry had been working with Aren. He’d come home to a dark home and a hastily scrawled note reminding him not to leave the flat, and that there was food in the fridge.</p>
<p>“Happy Birthday, Harry,” he said softly to himself and sighed.</p>
