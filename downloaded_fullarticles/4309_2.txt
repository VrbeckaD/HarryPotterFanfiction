    <p>Newt chose to hide in the heel of Percival Graves’ combat boot.</p><p>While the auror was showering after a rather intense workout, Newt sneaked into the sweat-smelling locker room and – with an effective spell, having practiced it many a time beforehand – hollowed out the low heel of the black combat boot. He was quick to put the empty snuff box he had brought with him into the hollowed out heel, and then, without wasting a moment, he climbed into the magically enlarged snuff box, from where he did a careful spell to put the sole of the heel back in place to cover up the metal snuff box and the hollowed out heel.</p><p>By the time Percival Graves entered the locker room, a white towel wrapped around his hips, his combat boots stood where he had left them, seemingly untouched. After having dried himself with a spell and after having gotten dressed, Percival Graves put his boots on and went on with his day, completely unaware of the magizoologist hiding in his left boot.</p><p>“I s-s-should have at l-l-least taken - <i>ow</i> - the t-t-time to a-a-add a few balancing charms on the - <i>ouch</i> - snuff box,” Newt admitted to a worriedly chirping Pickett, hugging his suitcase to his chest, trying to keep his balance, as the considerable quaking of the snuff box signaled them that Director Graves was walking around.</p><p>Newt had met Percival Graves a handful of times after having returned to New York to market his new book, <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i> some weeks ago. Director Graves had wanted to meet him, interested as he had been in Newt’s part in Grindelwald’s arrest, and Tina had been the one to arrange their first meeting, but since then, Newt had run into Graves in the most unexpected of places varying from Muggle libraries to benches in Central Park, as well as places expected, like the lobby of Department of Magical Law Enforcement where Newt often waited for Tina.</p><p>Director Graves had always been polite, asking Newt about his hobbies (“Do you dance, Mr. Scamander?”) and whether he was planning on getting to know New York City better (“Would you be interested in spending the evening on a boat trip along Hudson River?”), but if he knew that Newt was planning on <i>breaking into his home</i> this evening, Newt would - in the addition of the polite man he had encountered a handful of times so far - likely quickly get acquainted with the famed auror deemed so fierce and dangerous that even Gellert Grindelwald had gone for him first.</p><p>“<i>This</i> is undoubtedly the most reckless thing I have ever done.”</p><p>That was quite a thing to say, seeing as Newt had once disguised himself as a dragon egg just to get closer to a nesting Hungarian Horntail to spread soothing oil over the tail she had wounded when she had protected her eggs from a swarm of hungry griffins.</p><p>“If Director Graves catches us, there’s little even Theseus can do to save me from a lengthy prison sentence - breaking into the home of Director of Magical Security is a major offense.”</p><p>Pickett let out a worried chirp, pulling Newt’s earlobe as if to urge him to leave, as if to urge him to escape when they still had the chance, when no major crimes had yet been committed.</p><p>“Sorry, Pickett,” Newt sighed, calm and determined despite of the pounding of his heart. “I can’t turn back. This is the best chance we have at breaking into the mansion of <i>The Most Dutiful and Honorable House of Graves</i> without being detected. This is something that must be done, and you know it.”</p><p>In his defense, Newt hadn’t exactly planned on breaking into the manor of <i>The Most Dutiful and Honorable House of Graves</i>, into the home of Director of Magical Security. Rather, it was one of those things that just sort of happened when one wasn’t looking.</p><p>So, really, it wasn’t as bad as it sounded.</p><p>Although, yes, fair enough, he had had to plan <i>some</i> beforehand – the mansion of <i>The Most Dutiful and Honorable House of Graves</i> was not an easy estate to break into, after all, and Newt could not afford mistakes, so of course he had simply <i>had to</i> plan the burglary beforehand – but he certainly hadn’t come to New York with a burglary in mind because, again, it had been one of those things that just… happened.</p><p>Besides, Newt preferred to call these kinds of missions “search and rescue operations” rather than burglaries:</p><p>Earlier that week when Newt had been waiting for Tina in the lobby of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, he had happened to overhear Director Graves talking to one of the senior aurors, to one Ollie Artmore. Director Graves had told Artmore that he had “a rowdy bastard of a boggart” in the attic and that he was trying to “get rid off it” – based on the rest of the conversation, Newt had been able to gather that Director Graves had been <i>torturing</i> the poor boggart for days in vain attempts to kill it. Magical communities didn’t yet know much of boggarts and Director Graves had been treating the poor creature in an outright cruel manner, as far as Newt could tell, and Newt simply hadn’t been able to leave the matter be, to let Director Graves continue hurting the boggart.</p><p>Newt studied the map he had spread out over the bottom of the snuff box so he could keep an eye on their location, so he would be able to tell when Director Graves apparated to his mansion. A red spot signaled their location, it was currently standing on top of New York City, on top of the auror headquarters, to be precise, just as it had been for hours.</p><p>A comfortable distance away from the ever so busy New York City, a three-story stone manor stood peacefully in ten acres of land. The mansion of <i>The Most Dutiful and Honorable House of Graves</i> had been built in 1780s and since then it had been a home to generations of spectacular aurors, each more capable than the last which meant that every piece of the building was carefully warded, every ounce of the estate was protected by spells casted by excellent aurors determined to shield their family and home from dark magic users.</p><p>No witch or wizard could step into the manor grounds uninvited, unannounced, and not even Gellert Grindelwald had managed to gain entrance during his time disguised as Percival Graves. Newt knew this from having inspected, studied, researched. As far as he could tell, the only way to break inside was to apparate there alongside with Percival Graves without Graves’ knowledge – which was the exact reason why Newt was now hiding in the combat boot, ready to be apparated into the Graves’ estate without Percival Graves being any wiser.</p>
<hr/><p>It took several hours of waiting before Director Graves gave even a hint of possibly heading home, much longer than Newt had expected. Apparently, Director of Magical Security worked long hours, or at least he had decided to do so today, of all days.</p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” Newt told Pickett who, by now, was sleeping on top of Pennsylvania on the map, curled up under the white handkerchief Newt had covered him with. “The longer Director Graves works, the more tired he will be – and the deeper his sleep will be, the easier it will be for us to sneak around his home without being noticed.”</p><p>If anything, Newt was patient when he had a clear goal in mind. Now that his goal was to save the boggart from Director Graves, he didn’t mind waiting in the least, despite of the faint smell of ammonia left in the box by the cheap snuff it had once contained.</p><p>It had been seven o’clock precisely when Newt had made the heel of Director Graves’ combat boot his hiding place, and by the time he felt the familiar nudge of apparition, his pocket watch told him it was half four in the morning. Looking from his pocket watch to the map on the floor, Newt noted that the red spot was now standing right outside of New York City on an area called…</p><p>“Stony Point,” Newt read from the map, hugging his knees to his chest.</p><p>A smile tugged at his lips.</p><p>They were there, Director Graves had just come home – and he had apparated Newt there with him without being any wiser.</p><p>Newt’s plan had worked.</p>
<hr/><p>Newt waited for an hour before he had the boot falling to its side, before removing the sole of it with a quiet spell. Pickett was quick to sneak out of the snuff box to take a look around and just as quick he was to return, chirping eagerly, letting Newt know that all was clear, that it was safe for Newt to come out.</p><p>Cautiously, Newt climbed out of the snuff box with Pickett sitting on top of his hair holding on to his curls – only to find himself standing by the foot of a large four poster bed in a cozy bedroom dark but for the moonlight pouring in from the three large windows. There was the sound of soft snoring coming from under the blankets silvery white in the moonlight, and Newt instantly motioned for Pickett to be silent.</p><p>They were in Director Graves’ bedroom, in the very heart of the mansion, and if Director Graves was to wake up now, Newt would be charged with such crimes that Pickett would be an ancient bowtruckle by the time Newt was released from prison.</p><p>Never taking his eyes off the wizard sleeping but a few yards from him, Newt leant down to straighten up the combat boot, to attach the sole on it with a spell to cover up the snuffbox, minding the tufted bench next to him, careful to not accidentally push it so the legs made of wrought iron wouldn’t scrape against the dark hardwood floor.</p><p>With Pickett holding on to his hair, Newt sneaked out of the bedroom, closing the door behind him with a soft click.</p><p>All he now had to do was to find the attic and the boggart within.</p><p>The hallway right outside the bedroom was narrow, and the walls had portraits on them, all of them of the members of the Graves household. The Graves in the portraits, dark-featured with thick eyebrows, were thankfully asleep, none of them noticing Newt as he walked past them. As Newt walked past, careful to thread his way silently as to not draw any attention to himself, he caught a few names from the gilded nameplates under the portairts –</p><p>Obediah Graves Jr. (1801—1889)<br/>
Amanda Graves (1860—1914)<br/>
Elizabeth Graves (1739—1816)<br/>
Lucy Graves (1889—1900)</p><p>– and he couldn’t help but wonder in what way Percival Graves was related to all the people commemorated in the portraits. Had the young Lucy Graves with her braids been a sister, a cousin?</p><p>It took Newt quite a while of wandering blindly around, but eventually he managed to make his way up to the third floor of the mansion and, from there, all the way up to the attic where the boggart was said to be.</p><p>It was pitch-black and the stairs leading up to the attic were dangerously steep. There was nothing there to hold on to, no railings to speak of, and Newt – with the wand in his mouth to offer some light – tried to keep his balance by running one hand along the wall as he climbed up, the suitcase securely in the other. The plank steps creaked under each of his steps, the sound of it loud in his ears, in the otherwise peaceful mansion, and when he managed to push the hatch of the attic open, he was hit with stale air so dusty that it had him sneezing which, in turn, had the wand falling from his mouth – and clattering down the stairs.</p><p>“Oh bugger,” Newt said, Pickett’s sigh of a chirp echoing the sentiment, and looked around the attic completely black now that he had lost his wand.</p><p>The tip of the wand was casting warm light and it was therefore easy to find from where it had rolled to the foot of the steep stairs.</p><p>Having climbed up the stairs for the second time, Newt was finally able to take a look around, to see whether a tortured boggart was indeed living in the attic as Director Graves had claimed the case to be. He had barely taken but a step forward, however, when there already was the sound of pitiful cries coming from one of the corners, the sound of a <i>creature dying</i>, which had his heart clenching painfully in his chest.</p><p>“There you are,” Newt managed to say from the intense heartache, from the horror strong enough to bring tears to his eyes. “Don’t be scared, little one – I’m not here to harm you.”</p><p>The boggart cried harder and when Newt got closer to the far corner from where the sounds were coming from, he saw Niffler twitching on the dusty floor suffering in visible pain. The closer Newt walked, the harder Niffler was twitching, the more it seemed to be suffering, the harder, the more pitiful its crying became.</p><p>Niffler’s cries were like physical touches, like someone was clawing at Newt mercilessly, and Newt had to close his eyes, to take a deep breath to calm his pounding heart. He blinked furiously against the tears clouding his vision.</p><p>When he looked again, Niffler had vanished and in his place there was Alfonso, Newt’s dear thunderbird. Alfonso’s white feathers had a grey, sickly tint to them, his chest was rising and falling unnaturally fast, bloody vomit was coming out of his opened beak in a steady stream – the sight broke Newt’s heart and he couldn’t help a sob escaping his lips.</p><p>When Newt knelt by his side, Alfonso let out a soft gurgle – before he vanished and his place was taken by Pickett, twisted like someone had snapped him in the middle.</p><p>Squeaking, the real Pickett jumped down onto Newt’s shoulder and dashed off to hide in the inside pocket of Newt’s coat.</p><p>“Don’t be scared, Pickett,” Newt comforted the bowtruckle. “The boggart is just trying to scare me away by showing me my worst fear: my mere presence being enough to hurt and kill my creatures. None of this is real, none of this will come to pass. There is no reason to fear. It’ll all be okay, Pickett. Don’t worry.”</p><p>Exhaling shakily, Newt stuffed his wand in his coat pocket – letting it cast its light from there – and put the suitcase down to his side. He snapped the hatches open, opening the case, and offered the boggart – now in the form of a tormented unicorn – a trembling smile.</p><p>“Not to worry, little one.” His voice was thin and he coughed once to clear it. “It’s all going to be okay. I’m going to take you away from here so the wizard downstairs can’t hurt you again. Do you like the sound of that? Wouldn’t it be nice? I’ll find you a new home, boggart, somewhere dark, in some confined cupboard somewhere. Perhaps a crammed chest – wouldn’t you like that?”</p><p>The boggart answered by turning into a-</p><p>-into a weary-looking Percival Graves, who gave him such a defeated look that Newt came to a complete halt, unable to do nothing but gape.</p><p>What?</p><p>Percival Graves was not Newt’s worst fear, surely?</p><p>“You have no reason to keep on fighting,” the boggart Graves said, shaking his head in a despondent manner. “You do know it’s all for nothing, don’t you? Darkness has won and there’s nothing you can do about it because no-one cares. It doesn’t matter to anyone else – people are growing more and more impassive, all the more indifferent. Grindelwald has won, and it doesn’t even matter because everyone but you supports him. Why should you keep on fighting when no-one cares but you? You have lost, all your efforts have been for nothing. <i>You</i> are for nothing and you have no reason to keep on going. So give up, old man. You have no reason to keep on going, so just give up already, like I have done.”</p><p>Terrible though the words were, this… was not his worst fear, Newt was positive of that. He shook his head slowly, more than a little bewildered. For a few seconds, he suspected he had been mistaken, that he had falsely believed the creature to be a boggart when in fact it was something else, but then he understood what was happening in all actuality.</p><p>This was not his worst fear.</p><p>This was not <i>his</i> worst fear.</p><p>It was someone else’s, and that someone else had to be present, fairly close by, for the boggart to react to them.</p><p>With dread filling him, with his heart sinking, Newt slowly turned his head to look over his shoulder – and, yes, just as he had suspected: Percival Graves – the real Percival Graves – was standing there behind him, a wand in hand, wearing slippers and a dressing robe over his striped pajamas, his hair a complete disarray, dark eyes fixed on the boggart, the look on his face guarded, unreadable.</p><p>“D-Director Graves!” Newt managed from the lump that formed in his throat. He scrambled to stand up to face the man. “I didn’t hear you coming up the stairs.”</p><p>Director Graves gave him a brief look, but then his eyes focused on the boggart again. His face set into a grim line.</p><p>“When someone stumbles around my bedroom, I am bound to wake up, and no matter how lovely the surprise might be, I shouldn't be taken off guard like that - my magic might not react favorably,” his voice had a tense edge to it like he was barely keeping it controlled. “And when someone sneaks around my manor in the middle of the night, sneezes and <i>throws their wand down the stairs</i> when about to come face to face with a dangerous creature, I am bound to take notice. Or do you take me for a complete idiot, Mr. Scamander?”</p><p>Shaking his head furiously, Newt opened his mouth to answer, but he never got the chance to voice his thoughts because Director Graves already went on, “Now, you are standing with your back to a boggart, Mr. Scamander, and those are notably particularly dangerous, so may I suggest that you move away from the creature, slowly. I will defend you from it, I <i>will</i> protect you, but you must get behind me to get out of the way.”</p><p>And that was enough to give Newt a start, to have him spreading out his arms to shield the boggart from the armed auror. He glanced at the creature over his shoulder. It was still in the form of Director Graves, staring at the auror with empty eyes, the broad shoulders hunched.</p><p>“The boggart is completely harmless,” Newt was quick to assure, arms spread out to shield it, even as he turned back to Director Graves – who was now staring at him like he thought Newt had completely lost it. Newt bent his head, flushing, studying the auror from behind his fringe, suddenly terribly self-conscious.</p><p>“Life is meaningless,” the boggart chose that moment to say in Director Graves’ voice from behind Newt, “and everything you ever cared about has either died or turned into the darkness. Your loved ones are now the dark witches and wizards you call your enemy, Percival – are you sure you want keep on fighting against the darkness when the darkness holds your heart in the palm of its hand?”</p><p>Director Graves tightened his hold on his wand.</p><p>“Please, Mr. Scamander,” his voice was nothing but polite, even if his knuckles were white from clenching the wand, “do stand aside.”</p><p>“I can’t, no. <i>Please</i>, Director Graves,” Newt pleaded, taking a step closer to the auror in as unthreatening a manner as he could, arms spread out, palms towards the man to show they were empty. “I’m here to take the boggart away. You don’t need to destroy it, you don’t need to hurt it. Let me take it into my suitcase and it’ll never bother you again, I swear!”</p><p>“Do you have any idea what we’re dealing with here?” Director Graves had a pinched look on his face. “That thing is a <i>boggart!</i> They can predict your future, and the longer you let them affect you, the direr your future will become. Now, <i>step aside</i> and let me fight it before we are both doomed.”</p><p>Newt was already shaking his head, frustrated. The misconceptions of boggarts still persisted, the magical community was terribly misinformed when it came to creatures.</p><p>It was all terribly frustrating.</p><p>“That is not at all what boggarts do,” he stated firmly, unable to keep the annoyance out of his voice, “and I should know, a magizoologist as I am. I have studied boggarts, I am familiar with them. Boggarts <i>can’t</i> predict the future, I assure you, they <i>can’t</i> affect it any more than you and I can – those are just old misconceptions that won’t go away unless people get educated about creatures better.”</p><p>Director Graves was regarding him in silence. He didn’t look convinced.</p><p>“You break into my home, and now you’re trying to get the boggart in your possession. For all I know, you could find a way to have it predict my future to you so you could use the information against me. Perhaps you are not the man I thought you to be.”</p><p>“The boggart is <i>not</i> predicting your future but <i>sensing your worst fears</i>.” Newt was growing all the more frustrated. “It senses your worst fears (I don’t know how, I must study that aspect of boggarts more) and uses them to try and drive you away. This is just a defense mechanisms, a natural anti-predator adaptation, all very typical to boggarts. This boggart was going to settle down here in your attic, deeming it a suitable nesting place, but then we appeared and it’s now trying to scare us away so we will let it be. It can’t tell your future, Director Graves. It won’t hurt you, it won’t hurt us – it just wants to be left alone. I came here to save it from you, not to use it against you.”</p><p>Director Graves was frowning, thoughtful. He didn’t make a move to try and get Newt to stand aside, even if his hand remained clenched around the wand.</p><p>“You played a considerable part in Grindelwald’s arrest, Mr. Scamander, and, due to that, in my rescue,” he eventually said. “I owe you a great debt. I do not know what prompted you to break into my home, whether you came here for information or property, but if you want the boggart, I suppose it’s yours.”</p><p>Relief, lovely like cool water on a hot day, filled Newt and he was smiling at Graves before he even realized he was doing so.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said earnestly, twirling to face the boggart Graves once more, not at all aware of the intent way he was being regarded by a pair of dark eyes.</p><p>It took him almost twenty minutes to get the boggart into his study down in the suitcase, but eventually he managed to coax it into his wardrobe, having emptied the contents of the wardrobe onto the floor of the study, scattered here and there, out of the boggart’s way.</p><p>The boggart was as content as boggarts could be in his temporary new home, and Newt was satisfied to hear it rattling the wardrobe’s doors with relish.</p>
