  <strong>Master</strong>
</p><p>Voldemort looked at his pet.</p><p>It was sleeping, unperturbed by the ropes that bound its wrists and ankles to the four-poster bed. He admired the widespread legs which drew his gaze to the well-used red hole. Voldemort's half-hard cock twitched at the sight and grew thicker, tenting his black silken robes. His smile, always feared by his followers and often enough by the figure sprawled out before him, turned more cruel, fitting for the occasion.</p><p>The angle of the pet's head was in an uncomfortable position, but it had learned to make due. Time to wake up his sleeping beauty... well, as a beauty others wouldn't describe Harry Potter any longer, but his pet was a piece of art—at least to him, who had inflicted all the scars and bruises and... necessary modifications.</p><p>"Pet", he said, "it's time for you to wake up. I feel the urgent need to use your pliant body and your sloppy arsehole. I want to have some fun with my little whore before duty calls." Parseltongue purred from his mouth in mesmerising whispers. It was the most bewitching language, worth of only being spoken by him, known by just one other being in the world.</p><p>His pet startled, lifting its dishevelled head from the pillow and pulling at its restraints. </p><p>"None of that", Voldemort chided, though he couldn't help the grin that spread on his face when their eyes met. His pet's gaze darkened. It attempted to shake off any residue of sleepiness, opening its mouth; the only sound coming out was a feeble whimper.</p><p>"Still not used to being mute, pet? Be thankful I've left your vocal cords intact. It really wouldn't do, if you couldn't whimper in despair or moan wantonly or do both", he hissed, seeing the effects his voice was taking on his pet. </p><p>Voldemort shrugged off his robes, stroked himself to full hardness while gazing at his pet's leaking hole. The magical self-lubrication spell upon hearing Parseltongue always worked like a charm. Rosy flesh was glistening now; However, they could do better.</p><p>He continued.</p><p>"I can't believe how long it took me to cross-spell the timbre of my voice to your pleasure centre. All the useless fighting we did. Don't get me wrong: I find great pleasure in casting the Unforgivables as much as any of my Death Eaters do. Torture can be superb when brought upon the right opponent. But once you were broken in as a pet... So much time lost we could have spent better."</p><p>His pale, long and cold fingers slid over the pet's warm rear, soaking up heat from their skin to skin contact. "You're always running so hot. I'm still astonished how your suppressed magic bound to mine has turned you into such a furnace. You were the second strongest wizard once, after all. But not any longer. Now you're mine. My pet, my slut, my cock warmer, my magical reservoir. Aren't you proud to be all <em>that</em> to your master?"</p><p>His pet wriggled on the mattress and moaned, desperate to be fucked by now. Yet, prolonging its torture meant prolonging his own pleasure. In quick succession, he smacked the pale buttocks, marvelling at the welts and stripes he had left there over time. </p><p>"Your bum has healed up nicely. Guess, you're in for a good whipping soon." His pet was dripping with slick now, fat translucent globs were running down its perineum and balls. It keened, emitting high-pitched sounds. </p><p>"You like the cane better?" Voldemort asked mockingly, knowing his pet would take whatever he wanted it to. </p><p>"You did look quite fine with a cane shoved into you… the last time we played fetch the stick." </p><p>Cackling, he gathered up some of the leaking fluids, thereby avoiding his pet's pucker intentionally, to fondle his cock with them. His nostrils flared, the allure of his pet's scent never failed to arouse him even more. His hissing became sharper. "Ah, you smell... so sweet, so ripe... for the taking."</p><p>He positioned himself behind his pet and shoved his cock up to the hilt into the hot wet channel. He groaned, and the pet under him joined him, sounding like the whore he had trained it to be. It was fueling his own desire, but Voldemort loved to tease his pet until it grew nearly insane with unfulfilled want.</p><p>Feeding off the pet's magic through their indestructible connection he strengthened his willpower. Bathing in increased powers, Voldemort stilled for a few seconds. Then he conjured a thin silken rope that wound itself around his pet's balls and the base of its dick into a very smooth but painfully effective cock ring. </p><p>"Are you in a hurry, pet?"</p><p>A long whine escaped its throat and shudders wrecked the slim body beneath him; such a lovely reward for holding himself back. Voldemort laughed out loud once more when he picked up his movements, in a slow, languid pace. </p><p>Conversationally, he said, "I had this marvellous idea, pet: I should curse—or shall I say reward—you with a pair of ovaries and a womb. That way we could create a child together. Imagine what a powerful heir to my empire our combined magic could create."</p><p>Even aroused like a bitch in heat his pet was listening. Now it shook its head furiously and bucked under him like a very disobedient mare. Voldemort's good mood vanished. Instead, hot anger washed over him and his eyes flickered in a deep crimson. Violently, he grabbed the pet's hair, nails scraping over its skin. He pulled at black strands, wrenching the pet's head back until its spine's twist resembled the unnatural arch of a twig nearly breaking; A position its body couldn't hold for long before it collapsed, whimpering into the mattress. </p><p>"Haven't you learned yet, that you get no say in what's happening to you?" Voldemort asked, out of spite still using Parseltongue, so his pet's channel fluttered under the stimulation, regardless of his own erection flagging a bit in his ire. </p><p>"Generously, I was telling you about a plan that concerned you. Of course, witches, like Bellatrix, would all go crazy over such an opportunity, but I'm not inclined towards females," Voldemort said. It had become his habit to talk to his pet about anything going on in his mind. "Admittedly, I need to think about it some more. Not sure I want to forsake your lessons in obedience for a full nine months. Imagine how ill-humoured I'd be by the end. It might be an idea we will come back to in a few years. Or decades. It's not as if you are growing old any time soon."</p><p>He smirked: his plaything couldn't reveal any of his secrets… without the ability to speak and its mind shielded as it was. His followers had learned the Cruciatus way that his pet's mind was as well protected as his own. </p><p>He had never shied away from doing forbidden magic or the challenge of creating perfidiously twisted curses. No wonder he was still proud of the spell he had invented to keep his pet permanently looking sixteen and his own body in as a good condition as ever.</p><p>Voldemort continued fucking the floundering body under him, mouthing at its latest, barely scabbed-over wound—a perfect replica of his bite. His pet whined but Voldemort didn't pay it any mind. He buried his teeth in its flesh, reopening the wound and mauling it anew. The tang of iron and copper in his mouth worked like the sweetest aphrodisiac, hardening his cock even more. The wailing sounds his pet made only egged him further on. His sharp nails scratched over pale slim shoulders and sides, breaking scarred skin again, adding more blood to their coupling.</p><p>"Yes," he hissed, not giving a damn about the force he used. Only the restraints kept his pet from sliding over the sheets like a rag doll under his rough treatment and hard thrusts.</p><p>The sounds coming from his pet were desperate again. He had conditioned it well; Seeking its own pleasure was the most important thing in its life—well-dosed satisfaction and withholding it at his whim had been the way to get there. </p><p>Voldemort remembered the cock ring, for a moment still vexed about the earlier signs of disobedience, but then he changed his mind and vanished the constricting silk.</p><p>"Am I not a merciful master?" he asked, knowing he was anything but. </p><p>With a long whine, his pet came, its body shuddering under him, sending a boost of magic through their connection. Voldemort voraciously leapt it up and reached his climax too. With a triumphant shout, he spilt his seed in his pet's clenching arse.</p>
