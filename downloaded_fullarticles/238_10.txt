    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jack Frost lounged on his back as the wind blew him wherever it was headed. He tried to let the clear night skies ease his twisted thoughts. Getting the hang of being a guardian was confusing. There was no manual on what he was supposed to do now that he had helped save the world from Pitch. The other guardians had jumped right back into their work, but Jack’s only work was goofing off and somehow now that felt...irresponsible. Sure, he was the Guardian of Fun, but he felt as if he needed more direction now. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">North had Christmas and Bunny had Easter to keep them focused. Tooth and Sandy were constantly busy with their jobs. Jack didn’t really do anything but fly around causing mischief, and now that just felt...empty. Actually he felt a bit empty in general. You would think that after recovering his memories, saving the world, and starting to be recognized by children, Jack would feel better, but somehow he was more hollow than ever. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He looked up at the silent moon and whispered, “Why? Why do I feel this way? What am I not doing? Where am I meant to be?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The moon just beamed down at him and Jack sighed and began to head home. Just then a sudden strong gust of wind sent him spiraling down out of the upper atmosphere and towards the earth below. Jack cried out flung his arms and legs out trying to stabilize himself in the suddenly twisting gusts of wind. Jack could see trees and housetops getting much too close at much too fast of a pace, and just when he thought that he wouldn’t be able to escape the vicious winds he was flung to the side and out of the column of swirling air. He looked up at the angry sky, the dark clouds and wind being pulled into a the twisting vortex that tapered down to end just above the ground a few meters away. There at the base, stood a large group of people. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They were standing in front yard of a small cottage. One small teenager stood facing a mass of people, his green eyes glowing with anger as power swirled around him. Instinctively Jack could tell that this boy was the source of the twister raging above, just ready to be unleashed on the ground below. He could see that heated words were being exchanged between the boy and the group, but the howling wind was stealing any sound away. Cautiously, Jack inched forward to hear what was going on. As he got closer he realized that each person in the large group was holding a small stick pointed at the boy. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">‘Ahh,’ Jack thought, ‘Wizards then.’</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jack had see his fair share of the magic users over the centuries of his life. He was as invisible to them as he was everyone else, with the exception of Jamie and his small group of friends, but Jack tended to avoid them since they tended to be more aware of magical phenomena and instead of falling for his pranks tended to shoot rather nasty blasts from their wands in his general direction. Jack didn’t know how wizarding magic would effect an elemental force like himself or the other guardians, but he chose not to test it out to see.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Give him back, now!” Jack had just gotten close enough to hear what the boy was shouting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Now, Mr. Potter, you know the new laws demand that all dangerous creatures are to be taken into ministry custody.” The witch at the front of the group said, although her eyes looked nervously up at the raging heavens.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He is a baby! He is not a monster, nor are half the other people that you have enslaved!” The boy was now shaking with rage. Jack could see that the boy’s eyes were focused, not on the woman speaking, but on something in the center of the group of wizards. Following his line of vision, Jack saw a sight that made his stomach twist and his own anger build. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There, huddled in a cage was a small toddler, his face was red from screaming and his arms were outstretched to the young man facing down the group. There must be some sort of magic blocking the noise since there was no sound coming from the tiny boy. The toddler grabbed the bar of the cage and Jack could see a hiss of smoke and the boy pulled his hand back again, a raw burn forming where his skin had touched metal. Jack shot forward, heedless of all the magic users, who couldn’t see him anyway, until he was at the side of the cage. He blew a soft breath towards the red skin of the child’s hand and saw the relief in his eyes as Jack’s cooling magic soothed the burn. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thunder and lightning suddenly crashed overhead and the teen roared in fury, “Give him back or I swear you will see exactly what your Savior is capable of.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Everyone in the group seemed to sway back away from the enraged young man. “Mr. Potter you will be able to petition the Wizengamot at their next hearing in three months. Until that time this thing will be kept at a specialized containment facility…”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jack could tell that the teen was about to snap whatever tenuous control he had managed to be keeping and Jack didn’t want the young child caught in the crossfire of whatever was about to happen. With a focused effort Jack forced his magical ice into the hinges of the small cage until he could feel the metal creaking with strain, then with a hard swing of his staff he struck the cage right on the stressed hinge. With a sharp crack the cage door crashed open and the child’s screams were instantly heard across the field. That was evidently the breaking point for the teen and the wind suddenly crashed down on the group of wizards. Jack threw himself halfway in the cage, covering the small boy protectively with his body. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This action proved unnecessary however, as the wind swirled around the cage, crashing the wizards to the ground and absorbing anything that was shot from the wizards’ wands. However, the cage and the boy remained untouched as the dark haired teen walked calmly through the wind towards the cage, the only sign that he was even slightly affected was his hair whipping about his eyes, even as the other wizards were tossed through the air like rag dolls. Jack moved out of the way as the teen reached the cage and the toddler launched himself into the teen’s arms. The moment the teen had a firm grip on the toddler the wind died away and the black clouds cleared to reveal the smiling moon. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The wizards, who were scattered across the yard, were starting to sit up, some of them groping around in the grass around them for their wands that had been lost in the tempest. The teen glowered around at the men and women, even as his hand rubbed the toddler's back soothingly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“If you dare to touch him again I will bring hell fire like this world has never seen down on anyone who gets in my way.” He growled, “I saved this world from a madman so that the world could be a better place. But instead of taking the opportunity to improve, you and your ministry are making it worse than ever!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">For a moment it looked like the spokeswoman would speak again, but the teen interrupted her before she could make a noise.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just want to live alone in peace, but you are hurting good and innocent people. I will no longer stand idly by while you make a mess of the gift that I gave you all. Mark my words that this will be a day that the ministry will come to regret!” And with a flick of his wrist the many witches and wizards still sprawled across the grass went flying out of the small yard and Jack felt a slight tingle as a shimmering barrier erected itself around the house with only the teen, the toddler, and Jack on the inside.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Curiously Jack raised a hand to the barrier. It felt warm and sent a pleasant tingle up his arm, but as he pushed he could feel how strong it was. In the back of his mind he wondered if his magic would be able to break through, but that was not his priority at the moment. He turned back to the toddler and the boy holding him and moved closer so he was standing beside them in case anyone else tried to hurt the child. The toddler was still clinging to the teen so hard it looked as if he were trying to burrow inside him. The teen’s eyes were following the wizards outside the barrier as if daring them to try to break through. The wizards, however, seemed to have lost all interest trying to get the toddler and were scurrying around collecting various wands, hats, and papers that had been blown about, then with a pop they were each disappearing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Only once the last person disappeared did the teen’s shoulders relax. He burrowed his face in the toddler’s hair and he could hear him whispering. Leaning closer Jack heard what the teen was saying.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m sorry, Teddy. I am so sorry. I won’t let anything like that happen again. I am so sorry. I love you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Jack was sure that the teen was crying now too into the little boy’s hair as the two clutched each other. Jack felt a painful warmth settle in his chest at the sight, filling that void that had been eating away at him. Their strong bond was beautiful, but it was horrible that it had been tested and caused them both so much pain. The teen turned away from the lawn and started inside the small cottage. Jack had a second of indecision before he slipped inside along with them before the teen closed the door with his heel.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">‘Well it is not like I can leave with that barrier up anyway.’ Jack justified to himself, trying to feel like less of a stalker. He didn’t often hang around inside people’s homes, with the exception of Jamie’s room, but that was different since the boy could now see him, and he still didn’t go poking around other parts of his house. </span>
