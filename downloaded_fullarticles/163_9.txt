          <div class="userstuff"><p>               Jasmine, Dragons Blood Incense and The Sea  </p><p>The UK was cold. An abhorrent frigidness that chilled me to my core. I already missed my island home. A small island off the coast of Malta, hidden from muggles. The Atlantis Achapeglo was beautiful, thick lush greenery, brightly, beautiful colored animals, animals long lost to the muggle world. The islands were a group of Seven moderately sized islands, some were a little smaller but the sizes of the majority of the Islands could be comparable to the size of Hawai'i. Our unicorns were the most beautiful color patterns, we even had winged horses and horses of the sea depending on your island.<br/>
     My home was on the largest island, Tefetedity. This island was mostly barren of homes and people since long before my birth. It's only sign of life now was the Olympian Palace. A warm stoned palace, that gave off a pearl luminance in the warm sun. The palace was tall and pointed, it had the sharpness of the spears our original people used to fish, and win wars. The windows were either jeweled stained sea glass, or clear crystal that refracted rainbows into the building.<br/>
The bottom of the castle was carved by the ocean just as the top was carved by old gods, long before ourselves. Strong men and women of scales. Protected by Poseidon- Warriors of Poseidon. Who hungered for more.<br/>
     My grandmother weaved me the story of my people, reminding me that their triumphs were in my blood. How I missed her in these faltering days. My story did not start like many whom I know. My family loved me so dearly. My father and Mother were deeply in love- he taught her it was okay to love again.<br/>
My brother had loved me dearly, before he died many years ago. And my darling grandmother, who left me only a year ago. My beautiful grandmother, who was my best friend. She showed me new things day after day. She taught me to put on our winged shoes- a knowlage she swore the god Hermès bestowed on our island, so we could play games to appease Apollo (who Hermès had recently angered by letting out Apollo's sacred sun cattle). She taught me all she knew- all my ancestors knew...<br/>
She named me after the sea. She believed in my strength. She believed I was strong enough to heal my ancestors pain. So she gave me the strongest name she could.</p><p>Asherah Vitani Barbosa. </p><p>     Though I had never gone by Asherah ever. She didn't care. She knew the sea would whisper that name to me and I would answer. She knew my ancestors would whisper that name in my ear, and I had felt it. Before my first game of Tlachtli. When I was almost too nervous to play. But I did, and I won.<br/>
She would keep my culture so heavily alive in me, tattooing my triumphs on my skin, telling a story of my happiness, as well as my sorrow. Weaving symbols of power and magic into my skin.<br/>
There was more she wanted to see. She wanted to see the world the way our ancestors did. We'd stand on the shore, dancing, the way she would everyday, teasing the ocean- or from her view dancing with the waves. We practice all the names of everyone who came before me. Be they kings and queens or voyagers, warriors, any ancestors in my line. Their blood runs in mine. She always knew more then the rest of us, she hungered for more. Somehow I knew she'd want me to be here now. To go far beyond my island.<br/>
To navigate, you have to keep your island in your mind, you'll know what lies ahead if you remember what you left. If you what to find the answers to the questions that you still don't know you just have to leave, go and find more.<br/>
That was the first time she had tried to convince me to leave for summer break to visit the very house I was in front of now. I couldn't help but imagining her saying it now.<br/>
But now those words were cold, they were empty. Much like my heart. Where were those ancestors now? Was my beautiful loving mother, father, bother and grandmother them now? I was alone. I had no one.<br/>
All I was left with was god parents on two different parts of the United Kingdom who hated each other- as to my mothers words. Now I was stuck in a ministry who shipped me here to protect me from what they believed was an  assassination that started with my brother many years ago.<br/>
This house didn't remind me of my juvenile summers. Where my mother would sit with my godmother while I payed with her son. Sometimes there was a language barrier for me and him- my English was perfect now but upon my first visit we were both four and no four year old annunciation is perfect. I do remember that we got along well though. None of that mattered to me anymore though. I was hoping I didn't even have to look at him. I wanted to crawl into my godmothers arms and bawl.<br/>
     The ministry men said nothing to me as we awaited the opening of the door.<br/>
"Thank you, for your kindness." I mumbled to the duo who had gotten me from my islands, to Italy so we could apperate legally into their country.<br/>
"Our pleasure," the one man curtly nodded. As he finished his words the intricate oak door softly opened. When I saw it was Narcissa I launched myself into her arms, so desperate to feel warmth. Not physical, not to shield me from the cold of the air but the shield me from the ice forming around my heart and soul. I felt her frail hands in my hair and her soothing coo.<br/>
"Thank you, I've got her now." I heard her voice to the men. They nodded. I didn't even pay attention to her closing the door. She didn't dare try to speak to me, knowing i'd be at a loss for words, unable to fathom the past 96 hours.<br/>
    I began to let go of her frame, not wanting to over stay my welcome. Tears brimmed her eyes, she tried not to cry upon seeing me. I knew she didn't want to upset me further.<br/>
"I miss them." I whimpered. The tears over spilled her eyes, she yanked me into her again, both of us freely crying into each other.<br/>
"I am so sorry," She began. We gripped each other as we could, hoping to suck every last memory of my mother out of each other. I began to calm, to exhausted to continue this.<br/>
"What happened?" She asked me, holding me at arms length. I shakily took a breath.<br/>
"They said muggles broke into our home, found pictures of the occult and... and went into their rooms and killed them. My government think it's was an assination attempt from someone. The muggles were charmed with the Imperius Curse." I whimpered.<br/>
"My parents were on their anniversary vacation," I added.<br/>
I realized how pathetic it seemed- my powerful parents, blinded by their love for each other, so mercilessly killed. This caused more tears to spill in her eyes. She pulled me back into her, kissing the crown of my head.<br/>
"I'm scared, aunt Nar," I whimpered. This women was not my aunt by blood but she was my mothers best friend. My mother loved her. I loved her. She shushed me.<br/>
"I will protect you. Nothing will happen to you." She cooed. I hiccuped, wiping my eyes with my hands.<br/>
"I can't go back to Olympia the ministry said... now that I live here and such." I told her. She nodded.<br/>
"They wanted you to go live with the Weasleys considering theyre your blood relatives but in all honestly, I doubt they could afford another child. And that Lupin can't take care of himself let alone you," She reasoned to me. She actually didn't hate the Weasleys or even Lupin I believe, not the way her husband did. She knew they would love and care for me but she also knew she would do the same. She was a little possessive over me.<br/>
"I'm not excited for Hogwarts, the worlds so gloomy here." I told her. She smiled at me,<br/>
"It's no island oasis my dear, but i'm sure you can find beautiful things." She told me. I didn't react- truth be told I was exhausted.<br/>
"Where's Lucious, and Draco?" I asked pausing before I said her sons name, not remembering if i was correct with it.<br/>
"Lucious is at work, Dracos away at the Zabanis manor for the rest of the weekend." She told me as she motioned behind her. I had no idea whom the Zabanis were. Not the faintest clue. I didn’t care to pester.<br/>
"Lucious and I had your room set up, he picked up your stuff, i'm surprised you still have that blasted bird," She grinned. I nodded. She was referring to Te Feti. Folks here were amazed by my bird. I didn’t realize phoenix- even a subspecies like mine was- we’re extremely rare in this part of the world. Where as the United Kingdom had owls, we had these creatures.<br/>
She led me through the foyer and up their steps. Leading me down the first hallway she stopped to open the room on the end. Inside was a simple room, you could tell they tried very hard to remind me of home. It's what white people would assume island chic was. I liked it though. A java tree stood next to my bed, my blasted bird pearched on it happily and messily eating mixed fruits.<br/>
"I hope it's alright for it, I didn't want it to go hungry." Narissa smiled. I turned to her and wrapped my arms tightly around her middle. I was significantly shorter then the women.<br/>
"Thank you." My voice was barely a whimper but I couldn't cry anymore.<br/>
"Take a shower, relax. I'll be in the foyer if you need me, Lucious will be here soon, maybe we'll go out to dinner tonight." She told me, kissing my head. I nodded. The last thing I wanted to do was go out and galavant but I could tell these people were trying to be supportive. She walked out of the room closing the door behind her. I looked towards the balcony connected to my room, their garden was visible from it. Even their flowers were gloomy.<br/>
     Ta-Feti cooed at me. His vivid, colorful feathers peeking up. I nodded and pet his head.<br/>
"I know buddy. It's not home." I told him, one hand petting his head and the other grasping the locket I was given off my mothers corpse. Sighing I looked though all of the drawers looking for real decent clothing.<br/>
I felt a little weird that a house elf folded and put away all of my clothing, I don't know anyone who would want another creature going through their intimate clothing. Once I found a casual white satin sundress I was pleased. I grabbed a pair of knickers and my gold amulet accent belt.<br/>
This house and it’s inhabitants made me feel like I wasn't prestige enough to roam the halls, or even exist in the room so carefully marked as my own. I sighed once more as I looked outside. I missed the ocean, the sun, my people.<br/>
    I trudged over to my connected bathroom, hoping a scorching shower would ease my tired soul. I sighed in frustration, tears brimming my eyes when I saw how complicated this shower was. I pulled my wand from its position as a hair pick and pointed it at the knob.<br/>
"Louvri," I seethed. I watched the warm water come from the rainfall shower head. I sighed again upon realizing that i'd have to start using Latin variations of spells- not that I was extremely upset about that. Officially Olympia used Latin spells but most of us used Atlantian.<br/>
    I stripped myself of the pajamas I had been in for over 48 hours, throwing them in the marble hamper. I stepped in the shower feeling grateful for the warmth. I forgot how much I needed my soaps, how badly I desired to shave my body and lather myself in lotion that matched the sent of my body wash, conditioner and shampoo. Jasmine, rich incense and the ocean. Once I shut off the shower off, I stepped out to stare myself down in the foggy mirror. Thankfully my puffy, dark eyes had gone away. My skin was still flushed, my cheeks rosey.<br/>
My eyes, that suffered from heterochromia iridum, were dull though. I ran conditioner and gel though my thick curls. I grabbed my wand and pointe it at my hair to force it dry. I felt like I couldn't look undone here.<br/>
I slid on my sundress and used the gold chain belt to give the dress some shape. I placed coconut oil on my lips to moisturize them adding what was left over into the ends of my curls. I placed my hands on the edge of the sink staring deeply at the girl in front of me.<br/>
Instead of being happy, getting ready to go back to Olympia with my friends, I was forced to move across the world, forced to go to a school with no one I knew. Forced to go there before they tear to be sorted however the school does it- to save myself from the embarrassment of being sorted with eleven year olds, a school full of people i’ve never known. I'd be alone.<br/>
I had to stop my train of thought before i'd cry. I forced myself to walk out of the steamy bathroom. My bird plucked a tail feather out, something he did when he was stressed.<br/>
"Don't be like that," I commented to him, grabbing my gladiator sandals. I grabbed a head scarf the color of jewels and tied it as a headband letting the triangular end fall over the top of my head, causing my fire curls to engulf my frame like a waist length halo. I tried to make myself feel better by layering rings on my tattooed finger. I already had a surplus of gold necklaces on but the sight of shiny, delicate things made me feel at ease, and Merlin did I want to feel better.<br/>
I knew how different I looked from all of these people. They were paler then me (I was used to being the palest in the room, I was considered extremely pale where I was from). I had elven cat like features where as they were more so the high pedestal of Western beauty standards. I knew I passed as caucasian well enough to avoid any scrutiny but I was worried about being fetishized. I was barely thirteen but the Nereid gene unfortunately made me look a couple of years older, and though I was young I knew what men were like; to be called exotic made me want to take on an animagus form and rip someone's throat out.<br/>
I also came to know you had to be registered as an animagus here so I intended to be extremely quite about the ability that was considered average where I was from. I wished to distract myself from my hyper active brain as I stood idly, petting at my companion bird for what may have been an hour. Soothing the birds need to pluck his gorgeous wing feathers. I only faltered when I heard a slight knock at my door.<br/>
"Vitani?" It was a male voice. I knew it wasn't Lucious. It didn’t hold the indescribable emotion Lucious Malfoy had in his voice when he spoke to me.<br/>
"My parents want to know if you're okay. If you'd like to go and eat?" He added. I contemplated answering. Maybe I could just go to bed, pretend to sleep though the previous arrangement. Against my better judgement I opened my door. Draco was very different then when I last saw him almost six years ago. He was very tall now- he's always been taller. It was unfair when we would play chase as children he would always have the advantage.<br/>
"I thought you were away?" I asked him curtly, he flinched at my emotionless tone. My brows furrowed. I didn’t like the way my voice sounded. Not now. I worried I wouldn’t like it ever again.<br/>
"His mom got into a row with her husband so I left." He told me. I nodded.<br/>
"I didn't mean to keep you all waiting. I apologized, we can go." I told him. He looked down at me, stiff and imposing, to others he'd look mean and sophisticated but to me he looked painfully awkward. Like he wasn’t meant to be standing on the plane of existence- like he didn’t belong. I sauntered past him, leaving him standing behind me.<br/>
"You coming?" I asked, a dullness laced in my words that could only be comparable to an arithmancy professor.</p></div>
