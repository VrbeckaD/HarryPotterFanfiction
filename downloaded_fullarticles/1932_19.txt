    <p align="justify">It had been two months since the Third Wizarding War had ended, and once again, it was September 1st, the beginning of a new school year at Hogwarts. Given the incidents that had hindered several students from attending school the previous year, the Ministry of Magic had allowed the students to return to an extra year of schooling so that they could catch up with their studies. This resulted in an additional eighth year being formed temporarily for those who had never gotten to finish their seventh year, or had not turned up for safety reasons. King's Cross was more crowded than it had ever been before, with the unusual influx of students to the more senior years.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Harry! HARRY!" Harry Potter grinned on spotting his two closest friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, waiting for him by the ticket counter. He pushed his trolley a little faster, making his new red screech owl, Fyre, puff up disapprovingly, raising a royal fiery crown of feathers. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Dear Merlin, Harry, he's sweet!" Hermione laughed, on seeing her friend's new pet. "I can understand why you named him Fyre, he almost looks like a phoenix. We've been waiting for you for ages. Did you know that there's going to be a complete resorting? I only heard today from Professor McGonagall."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Oh no, I do not fancy having to scream at that Hat again," Harry groaned, then laughed. "Maybe we should persuade the Hat to put us in the three other Houses, and then just meet up in the Gryffindor common room anyway." Ron laughed as well, and they highfived each other, while Hermione tried to purse her lips in disapproval.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Despite the light atmosphere and lack of tension as they boarded the train, heading for the same compartment that they normally shared with Luna, Ginny and Neville, Harry couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. Usually, this kind of feeling disappeared once they reached their compartment, but in this case, he felt it intensifying. Maybe he was just being paranoid, but after the last seven years, he had learnt to be wary, if nothing else, and the sleepless nights he had spent raiding the Black and Potter libraries had done nothing to lower his guard. If anything, he had learnt to be more on his guard of such instinctive feelings than he had ever been before.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Hermione," he said, knowing that it was best to alert them, since he just couldn't shake the feeling. "Aren't you supposed to be with the Prefects or something?" </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Well, yeah," she replied, studying his face and realizing that something was wrong. "Can you come with me? I always run into Lee, and I'm late as it is anyway, so if fate runs its usual course, then maybe you could distract him." Harry nodded, a little too enthusiastically, and they both stepped out of the compartment together.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"What's wrong, Harry? You know that Professor McGonagall clearly stated that the Prefects, Head Boy, Head Girl and Quidditch Captains would be announced only after the Sorting," Hermione said quietly, glancing around nervously to make sure they were alone.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"I know, I need to tell you, I can feel someone watching us," Harry replied, in an equally hushed tone. "I didn't think Ron would get it, but we have to keep an eye out. Something is seriously weird. I've been feeling it ever since I stepped onto the platform, but I was fine even when we were at the station, before we got on to 9 3/4."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Okay." They stepped back in, with Hermione muttering how she forgot that the Prefects hadn't been selected yet, and Harry glancing around warily once again.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Okay, that's it," Ginny said, after a tense moment of silence in the compartment following Hermione's declaration. "Who else feels like there's someone else we can't see in here?"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Harry raised his hand, and much to his surprise, so did Hermione and Luna. Ginny frowned. Ron and Neville looked at each other, then turned to the others with nonplussed, what's-going-on-here expressions. Hermione and Harry moved as one, drawing their wands, but not entirely sure about what to do with them either. Ron, however, caught on to what they were thinking unexpectedly fast. He took both Ginny and Luna by their elbows and dragged them out of the compartment. As Neville hurriedly scrambled to his feet and followed them, Harry and Hermione stepped back to the compartment doorway together. No one could possibly have left the compartment except their friends.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"<em>Homenum revelio</em>," they chanted together. There were several bangs, but nothing appeared, though they heard muffled groans and curses following the spell.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Who's there?" Hermione asked, her voice slightly shaky, but she was more than pleased that her spell had worked. Harry rolled his eyes. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"I don't think they want us to know," Ron said weakly, from behind them. "They're probably under Disillusionment Charms or something, but whatever it is, it's pretty solid."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Harry and Hermione only exchanged a knowing look, not bothering to reassure Ron. "<em>Finite</em>!" </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">This time there was a loud, prolonged rustling, as though someone had let a wild gale rush through the compartment, but still, no one came into sight. Hermione was starting to get annoyed, and Harry was getting frustrated. The others could feel the accidental magic build up between the two friends, and took a few precautionary steps back.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Not a Disillusionment Charm," Hermione grumbled, more to herself than anyone else, but she was looking expectantly at Harry.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Don't look at me like that," he said, equally disappointed. "It didn't have to be a Disillusionment Charm, and in most cases, even if it wasn't one, <em>Finite</em> should have worked."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"But it didn't."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"I noticed."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Will you two cut it out?" Ron groaned. "If you don't want to sit there, we can just go find another compartment. Might as well as look for Ferret-face and send him here. He's stupid enough to annoy anyone and everyone around him, so we'll probably find out whoever is playing hooky by the time we reach the castle."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">An idea seemed to have struck Hermione at that very moment, because she turned to Harry, completely ignoring Ron, with a queer glint in her eyes. "The Quibbler." </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"The what now?" Harry looked confused. "Wait, Luna, aren't you running the Quibbler now? What about it?"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Yes, but have <em>you</em> been reading it, Harry?" Hermione asked, looking him dead in the eye.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Not regularly, no," Harry admitted sheepishly. "And before you ask, no, I haven't been keeping up with the <em>Prophet</em>, either. Actually, I got caught up in a few books over the break, so I haven't been keeping up at all. So yeah, what's going on?"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"You think it's the Returns?" Ron asked, realization dawning on him as he caught on to what Hermione was suggesting, and she nodded solemnly.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"The what now?" Harry parroted, completely lost.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"The Returns, honestly, Harry!" Hermione groaned, and Harry had the decency to look slightly abashed as she backed him into a seat and conjured a handful of newspapers onto his lap. "You realize that the souls of the people who die are transported to a parallel universe, right? However, the universes aren't stationary, so every thousand years, there happens an alignment, which results in souls whose magic correspond to the wavelengths emitted by the friction between these two universes to be transported back here. In short, resurrecting the dead. Don't pull that face at me! I verified the authenticity of this phenomenon with both Professor Binns and Professor McGonagall. For once, probably since Kingsley is Minister, the <em>Daily Prophet</em> hasn't been printing complete garbage either. They've been issuing regular updates of the people who have Returned." </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"And the reason you think it could be a case of Returns is because?" Harry questioned. He could see that Hermione was still clearly thinking on that one.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Well, if it were a group of well, strong witches and wizards, it would probably be easy to maintain the charms, even if they lost their balance, which is pretty evident, given the ruckus they were making," she said slowly. "It also means that they probably have rather weak Silencing Charms in place, because if they make those too strong, it would diminish what they could hear, so they are very keen on hearing what was happening here as well. Which means, all it would take is to do something unexpected."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"You mean, do something that would make them all scream, and not just wince," Ron said, grinning evilly at the thought. "Hey, Harry, how about you show it to us now then?"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Show w- oh." Harry smirked right back, knowing exactly what he was talking about, and drew his wand. "<em>Expecto patronum</em>!" </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">There were several gasps of admiration and astonishment as a large, beautiful silver panther bounded out of the wand and pranced around the compartment. Ginny giggled, and reached out to pet it, but just as Harry yelled "Don't!" she made contact, and it turned into a phoenix, making all hell break loose.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"What the hell?!" "What was that?!" "It CHANGED FORM!" "No way!" "Awesome!" "Wicked!" "How did you do that?!" </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"It actually does change form," Hermione grinned at him. "You weren't kidding about actually being able to do it - the other ting you told me about?" </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"What I didn't expect was for the Patronus to change like that," Harry replied. "As for the other thing, yeah, that's pretty much established. I mean, never mind, just watch."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Harry tossed her his wand and stood up, taking a few steps away from them. Then, suddenly, he shimmered, and a large black, green-eyed panther took his place. Hermione laughed, and just as Luna moved forward to crouch down, he leaped up at her, making her squeal, then scream as the panther turned into a phoenix. Ron smirked as Neville's jaw hit the ground. There were several screams erupting around them, voices mixing with each other, making them impossible to distinguish. And then, Harry touched down, but this time, he had a very specific intention, and landed as a full-grown stag, and that seemed to achieve exactly what he had been aiming to do.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"How the bloody hell are you able to do that?!" Sirius' shocked tone of voice, followed by the man himself, however, were the least of his worries. His antlers had gotten caught in the overhead light as he had transformed, and he had no idea how to get free of them. Hermione sprang to help, but just then, he transformed back, rubbing his head.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Ouch, that hurt," he said, still wincing as he took Ron's hand and pulled himself up, turning to grin at Sirius. "Couldn't you have just caught up with us at the station, Snuffles?"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Shut up, you," Sirius snapped playfully, pulling his godson into a bone-crushing hug. "You little brat, I turn my back on you for two seconds-" "You mean two years!" "-and you come with up stupid thing to do! How in bloody Merlin did you do that?" Sirius finished, ignoring Harry's accusing jibe in the middle of his rant.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"I just did," Harry said simply. "I was bored, and ended up reading up on Animagi. Minerva knew that I was trying to do it, and she'd keep a tab on me occasionally, to make sure nothing went wrong. The thing was, one day I didn't end up turning into a panther, and it became a stag instead. And when I tried to turn back, it turned into a phoenix, and it took the entire day for me to finally get back to being a human. I think I was a hundred and fifty different things before that, though."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Including a garden snake-"</p>
<p align="justify">"That cute white tabby-"</p>
<p align="justify">"A boa constrictor-"</p>
<p align="justify">"Turning into a freaking Thestral-"</p>
<p align="justify">"And then a Hippogriff-"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"It's a mercy you didn't actually bring the place down," Hermione smirked as Harry flushed scarlet at Ginny and Ron's recounts. "But it was the Pegasus that really got me."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"You turn into that otter yet, Mione?" Harry asked, and she instantly pouted, a clear indication that she hadn't.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"I didn't have the kind of time or space that you did!" she protested. "Plus, it's really, really difficult to think about absolutely nothing. I don't know how you managed it!"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Thestral felt awesome though," Harry said wistfully. "But then you all looked like you'd wet yourselves if I didn't try and turn back-"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"So you turned into a Hippogriff!" Ron interjected, grinning evilly at him. "Damn near trampled me. After all that whinnying, I thought you'd go back to being human!"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"I told you, it was just a messed up day," Harry laughed. "Your fault for insisting that I show you how far I got the very first day you were allowed to come over."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Without supervision, you mean," Ron scoffed. "We went there practically every other day, or Mum would end up having kittens about how you were holing up all alone."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Still your fault." Harry flopped back down on the seat, and all the others clambered into seats as well. "So who else is back, minus you and Padfoot?"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"That's for me to know and you to find out," Sirius said, with an uncharacteristically long face. "I still haven't forgiven you for tricking me into dropping the charms."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Your fault for lowering your guard, Snuff." Harry ducked as Sirius swatted at him, blushing at the use of his undercover name, making Luna and Ginny dissolve into giggles.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Sirius found himself with no choice but to keep the six lighthearted teenagers company until they reached Hogwarts, which he didn't really mind. He was more than glad to be reunited with his godson, and both Ron and Hermione had become pretty close to him as well. He knew that the other three had followed Harry blindly to the Ministry the day he had died, and he was eternally grateful that despite not knowing the whole truth about his identity, they had still stood by Harry during the tough times.</p>
