    <p>Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Naruto.<br/>Mentions of past rape. </p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Hermione sat on the couch and stared at her packed bag of meagre possessions. This wasn’t how she had imagined life would go; she should be skiing in the Alps with her parents right now, not packing up what was left of their lives. But thanks to a drunk driving she would never do anything with her parents again. She had taken a taxi home from the station when no one had appeared to pick her up, assuming they had been held up at work only to find two police officers waiting for her on the doorstep. Her whole life had changed in that moment.</p><p>Only one person from school knew what had happened. She had called Harry immediately and something in her voice had made his foul aunt actually give him the phone. Half an hour later he had shown up on the Knight Bus asking what he could do to help. So while she had been dealing with distant relatives and funeral arrangements he had snuck into Gringotts to act as her go-between with the Goblins. With Fudge still in office and Voldemort on the move neither of them trusted the Ministry so getting her emancipated was being left to the Goblins with Harry funding it for now out of his trust fund. Once she had access to her parents’ accounts she had transferred the necessary money back to him at Gringotts. </p><p>So here she was, a few months shy of sixteen and a new orphan, still dressed in funeral black and waiting for her taxi. She was getting out of England while she could and Harry had agreed, if it wasn’t for the fact that the war would follow him he would have been coming too. It felt sort of cowardly to do this but how could she fight in her condition? She was an emotional mess and yes, part of that was hormones which was just another reason to get out. How could she raise her baby in a war? She closed her eyes as she fought tears; she had never even gotten to tell her parents they were to be grandparents. Though if that bastard ever found out she knew he would take her baby away and raise it to be a Death Eater. She shuddered and forced the memories away, she would raise her child right, to be like Harry and not his or her father. </p><p>Hearing the taxi arrive she grabbed her bag and left her childhood home for the last time. The new owners would be moving in next week and she hoped they weren’t bothered by any wizards looking for her. Thankfully the driver noticed her mood and stayed quiet for the trip to Heathrow so she tipped him a bit extra before heading inside the massive building. She walked towards the check-in only to freeze in shock as she spotted three familiar figures. Waiting for her was Harry, Ginny and Luna all dressed as muggles and looking totally casual. “Hermione!” Ginny threw herself at the older girl and Hermione caught her in a hug. “We can’t stay long, Mum thinks I’m at Luna’s but we had to say goodbye.”</p><p>“I…Ginny….how…Harry?” She stammered and he laughed, moving in to hug her tightly.</p><p>“Sorry but you know Luna, she just knows things and they wanted so badly to come and say goodbye.” He shrugged and she could tell he wasn’t sleeping well but she didn’t blame him since she had the same problem. “Here are your papers.” He handed over the folder. “Everything’s sorted with the Goblins and filed at the Ministry so there’s no way to overturn it, not that it’ll matter once you’re out of the country. I’ll let you know about Sirius’ will when it’s read since he made it after escaping. The goblins hinted that he mentioned you and that I might be his heir. So I did something that might make you mad. Apparently I can inherit from Sirius because my Grandmum was a Black and I’m male, the other option is Malfoy. But once that’s done it will change to follow the Potter family inheritance rules and the only one we have is to be magical. So….I sort of wrote a will naming you my heir if I die without my own children. This way Malfoy can’t inherit Sirius’ stuff. And hey, it’ll keep them trying to bump me off just so he can inherit since it will no longer go to him.”</p><p>“Harry…you’re crazy.”</p><p>“Yeah well, got to make sure my godchild is well provided for no matter what.” His hand ghosted over her stomach. “Stay safe and send word once you’re settled. Once this mess is done with I might just join you with these two.” He glanced over at the two girls and Hermione looked at them, seeing it in their eyes. One of those girls would get her heart broken one day from the looks they both gave Harry and she honestly didn’t know which would be the better match for him. “I love you little sister.” Harry whispered, kissing her cheek before stepping back to let the two girls say their goodbyes. They watched as she checked in and disappeared behind the security barriers before Harry escorted them outside and summoned the Knight Bus. He saw them safely to the Rookery before slipping back home under his cloak to avoid his guard, he’d gotten rather good at it since the start of summer. </p><p>````````````````<br/>Hermione stepped outside the airport and breathed deeply, glad to be out of there and back on solid ground. She’d never been to Japan before; their family vacations had always been in Europe. But people were people and the bustling crowds felt familiar in a way despite the differences. She got a taxi and sat back to watch the scenery as it passed by, going from city to country until the taxi finally stopped. She paid the driver well for going so far and shouldered her bag; magic came in handy for shrinking things to fit into one bag. Once the taxi was gone she turned to stare at the ancient temple and sighed once she saw exactly how many stairs she was going to have to climb. It was a good thing her pregnancy was not far enough advanced to show or else this would be very hard to do. As it was it took over half an hour to reach the top and she slumped down on a stone to catch her breath. And she had thought the stairs at Hogwarts were bad, there were pure torture!</p><p>She started at the sound of a voice and blinked wearily at the approaching man who paused to study her before smiling gently. “Welcome traveller, please rest as long as you need.”</p><p>“Thank you sir.” She bowed slightly as best she could while sitting. </p><p>“Just rest young one, then you can tell me what brings you and your little one here.” At his words a hand protectively went to cover her womb and he smiled kindly. For the first time in a long time Hermione felt safe.</p><p>TBC…</p>
