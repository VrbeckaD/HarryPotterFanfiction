    <p>Y/n's POV</p><p>Dear Dray,</p><p>I threw the parchment in the dustbin.</p><p>Mr. Draco L. Malfoy,</p><p>I ripped the paper into pieces.</p><p>Draco,</p><p>Now, it sounded right. So, I started writing the letter.</p><p>Draco,</p><p>Don't take this letter as apology note because I'll never apologize to you. You should be the one saying "sorry".Anyways, let's get to the real business.</p><p>I think you know, Scorpi is going to start Hogwarts this September. He has already got the acceptance letter.  It would be helpful if you come at the Platform. I will not let my son get teased because of not having a father, even though he has one. He has already tolerated a lot for his age. </p><p>Y/n L/n-Malfoy.</p><p>P.S: You can bring that girlfriend of yours but, keep her away from my child.</p><p>That's it! Neither too long nor too short and language is as clear as crystal. </p><p>"O/n, girl come. Come." I summoned my little chocolate brown Athene Noctua and gave her the letter. "Give this to Draco, okay?"</p><p>She flew into the blues from the big airy window. I was looking at the blue patches in the sky and the new leaves forming on the twigs. It's autumn. Time for change. </p><p>I looked at my hands.</p><p>Things had already changed. A bit too much. Draco had changed. Scorpius was also growing up too fast. Wasn't it just a little time ago, I cradled Scorpi in my arms?</p><p>I chuckled to myself as a single tear rolled down my right cheek.</p><p>******<br/>
I made the table for dinner as Scorpi descended from the stairs. The chair screeched as he sat on it.</p><p>"What's the menu tonight, Mum?"</p><p>"Today, I've made someone's favourite dish. Mashed potatoes and roasted beef!"<br/>
Scorpi's silver eyes glinted with happiness as he smiled broadly at me, that automatically brought a smile to my lips.</p><p>I sat on my chair and beckoned Scorpius to start serving himself. It came to me that he was going to be as charming as his father when I saw him eating his favourite dish with lithe grace. I was never graceful, never followed table manners specifically. Maybe... that's why he left me?</p><p>I was distracted from my thoughts by Scorpi's sudden question. "What's the meaning of saudade?"</p><p>"Where have you heard it, dear?"</p><p>"Well, I found it in one of the books in our library."</p><p>I nodded. "Well, it means nostalgia. The love that remains, for something or someone distant. I don't think you'll make out the feeling. You're too young." </p><p>Scorpius, like a good boy, understood and continued eating.</p><p>After finishing the dinner, I levitated the utensils to the kitchen and started scorgified them.</p><p>"How do you do it, Mum?" Even after all this years, Scorpi stares in awe at my magic. To be honest, I enjoy the fact.</p><p>"You'll find it soon enough."</p><p>"How is Hogwarts, Mum?"</p><p>"Mmm... Magical."</p><p>"That, the whole Wizarding World is!"</p><p>"You won't understand the thing till you get there."</p><p>And that's how the conversation went on. About magic and Hogwarts.</p><p>Time flew. I went to Scorpi's room to tuck him in. After kissing him goodnight, I turned off the lights. I started to head towards the door, when I felt Scorpi tucking at my pajama shirt. I turned to him. He never does this.</p><p>"What happened, darling? Feeling unwell?" I asked, in worry.</p><p>He shook his head. "No Mum. It's just... Is nostalgia the feeling I get when I miss Dad?"</p><p>I was taken aback by his question yet I answered. "Perhaps... Now...Now, go back to sleep, dear. Don't you want go to Diagon Alley, tomorrow?"</p><p>He nodded silently.</p><p>"Don't worry. Everything will be fine." I whispered to him and kissed him on the forehead again.</p><p>I walked out and before I could fully close the door, a question came to my mind.</p><p>Were the words meant for him or myself?</p>
