    <p>Dear Me,</p><p>I’m writing this so I can get a grip on myself before I go insane and admit myself to St. Mungo’s due to all the stress. Just kidding, it was Hermione's suggestion and she suggested me to write a dream journal because my dreams are becoming more weird and weird and a normal journal to document the odd ones out. Not that I care. Some of them are actually great.</p><p><br/> Anyhow, I suppose I need to write down who and what I am just in case I die. I am Harry James Potter, a very well known wizard as much as I wanted to, a father of three children, and an overworked Ministry official. I’ve gotten around England so many times that I’m currently on break.</p><p><br/> I’m about to start my own investigation about potential space-disrupting magic to give hindsight, like time magic. At least muggles had it wrong that they’re intertwined. I had the go from the head of DMLE and also support from the Department of Mysteries, who had apparently wanted a Space chamber to add to their stuff.</p><p><br/> Anyhow, here’s for the best. I’m going to write in the morning then before I sleep.</p><p>From,<br/> Harry Potter<br/> The Boy-Who-Lived</p>
