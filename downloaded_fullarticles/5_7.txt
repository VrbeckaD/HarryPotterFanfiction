    <p>Timing was everything. It had been a sick thought that had popped into her head as she found herself lying in the hospital bed at St. Mungo's. If she had been slower with getting ready for their date, if she had been unable to complete her paperwork at the ministry on time and had to stay a bit later if she had decided that they should have taken the train system instead if she had drawn her wand faster…. if she had done any of those things then they would have still been alive. </p><p>She felt the tears well up again in her eyes. She did not want to cry anymore, she had done nothing but cry since she had received the news. But the pain of it all just made the tears keep coming whenever she even thought of his face. That stupid face that she loved. She had loved him since 2nd year. She did not know exactly why, but it had only grown and grown till the next thing she knew they were living together, married, and they were going to have a family.</p><p>She rubbed at her face as she sniffled and buried her face into the pillow to muffle the sound. Nothing she had ever felt or read could quite capture the feelings that were inside of her. There was just this horrible ache. Every moment that she was awake she wished that she was dreaming it. That she would turn over and see the man that she loved sleeping face and hear his deep breaths. All she would have to do was pull at his arm and he would have stirred enough to grab onto her and comfort her from the nightmare that she was having. </p><p>Maybe he would wake with that half-smile and mumble a Hermione and promise her quietly whatever was upsetting her that he would fight it with her. He would protect her, that things would be okay.  </p><p>Now when she thought of his face she could not see that cute large nose or the freckles that dotted it. She could just see the way that it contorted as he screamed. The way his eyes had bulged and the way that his body had convulsed. </p><p>How was she going to live without him? </p><p>How was she to pick up the broken parts without him? </p><p>Harry and Ron had been the foundation of her life, the pillars of friendship that had gotten her through all of life’s battles. And Ron’s love had made some of the greatest hardships seem as if they could be overcome. No matter what they faced. The political turmoil in the ministry or the random friendship squabbles, nothing could tear them apart. </p><p>She had been happy… </p><p>Something that Hermione desperately had wanted after having given up her family to fight against Voldemort was to form one again. She missed her parents and other relatives desperately. Even if she was sure that none of them even knew who she was. It had made it all that more painful that after the war she knew that she could not just come home to them. She could not just insert herself back into their lives. She had not stalked her parents, but she did visit them when they were out and about just following for a bit to see if they were happy. If they were okay. </p><p>And there had always been a feeling that things were better without her. Her parents did not have to worry about what crazy antics that she was getting herself into. They did not have to be targets in a war that they never should be a part of. They did not have to deal with the ramifications of toppling Dark Lords that had sunk as many evil, twisted people possible into every branch of government.</p><p>Nor would they ever be one of the many missing case fills that found itself lingering on her husband's desk. He had quickly become an Aura not even having to go through as much extreme schooling as he had already been out there fighting the war. He was one of the best-known fighters that there had ever been. And Ron had taken it very seriously his responsibility to find both the remaining Death Eaters that were attacking from time to time in coordinated attacks. But he also felt that any other death that was happening, while he was on the job, was just another death to feel responsible for. He could try to hide it from her, but Ron had always been the sensitive sort. </p><p>She knew that those cases were getting to him. It did not stop his anger and drive to find them, but she knew that after losing members of his own family to Voldemort’s forces that he took their actions very personally. Harry was not much better. </p><p>She knew that she herself was handling things the best she could but there were so many holes that had been burned into her during the war. Friends had been killed in front of her. People that were basically her second makeshift family were gone. Harry had literally become her family as she had married Ron. She had believed that such an action would further help to build everything back. Help put the healing process back on track, because they did love each other and just something happy for a little bit to plan in the mists of everything had been one few things that had brought her great joy. </p><p>Healing though did not happen as fast as she wanted it to. Even when she had completed her Hogwarts Education and had something to be proud of there were still things that pulled her back to the darker times. </p><p>It had been a very slow process for her to put most of the pieces of herself back together, even though she was sure that she seemed to carry herself alright for the most part. It had taken years for her to really feel like she belonged with everyone again. Molly and the others were wonderful, so was Harry and Ginny. But there was always just a slight part of her that was still dwelling on the past reliving the war at Hogwarts and the torture in Malfoy Manner.  </p><p>But Ron, her Ron with his amazing will to see things in a different light than she did, had taken that pain away. He had held her on the long nights when nightmares came back. He would tell her that she was his light and that he would always be there for her, He would never leave her again stranded when she needed him.</p><p>And she had started to accept that she would make a very great Healer. She could help people with her vast knowledge of topics, and provide experimental ways of healing. She felt that she could save people and she certainly was. Being a healer had not originally been her long term plan of employment. She had always considered herself to be somewhat of a medler that was destined to help out with the political spectra of things at the ministry. But perhaps it was the need to help more immediately instead of playing games with the other politicians, and where it really mattered. had led her to be one of the present healers helping any way that she could after attacks that had been done on both Muggles, Witches, Wizards, or living creatures alike. Hermione did not care if someone was a half breed or blood or whatever it was. She could give them all the care that she could and they needed. Ron had always praised her for her gift for learning things rather quickly, even enough to get those internships. Well, perhaps it was not exactly praise but teasing. She would be a full-fledged healer soon. </p><p>But she didn’t feel like moving from the hospital bed. One that could be occupied by one of the many in need that she could be serving. She could hardly move though without an ache somewhere on her body. </p><p>She clutched her arm that had been badly burned and had now spell damage that would take weeks to heal. It burned slightly to the touch and throbbed from under the bandages, but that hardly mattered to her. No, the cruciatus was not the worst thing to happen to her. Her other arm that had the word MUDBLOOD carved into the flesh was not something that would heal with time not would it fade much like this new injury. The pain she was in could not match the pain of seeing Ron on the ground screaming. The sound would haunt her until she died. Nor could the aches in her bones ever replace the second thing that she lost besides Ron that night. </p><p>She had been carrying a child. </p><p>She was going to have a girl. She had been so excited about the baby. Tears streamed down her cheeks again, and she could not stop her whole body from shaking with the weight of it. She had not been too far along, but it had been something that she had celebrated. Something that she never knew that she would have wanted until it was made known to her that soon she could have had that little girl in her arms. </p><p>She would have named her Rose. She had loved that name ever since she was little and as such the child she had been dreaming forever about would have had that name. Ron had admitted that he was hoping for a boy, but had quickly said that a girl would be even better. Ron would have been protective of her much like he was over Ginny. He would have been a doting father and would have wanted to teach her to fly, as soon as she could handle a broom. </p><p>She felt along her belly remembering the heartbeat that she had been able to detect with her magic. Now there was not a sound but her own and her choked sobs. </p><p>					                                                                                            ~/*\~</p><p>She could not stay at the hospital forever. She had to go home and the moment that she stepped into her home, she had collapsed onto the floor. Ginny that had been pregnant herself, and hopeful for a child hers could play with, bent down despite the slight difficulty to try and comfort her. </p><p>She had tried to brace herself for it, but she couldn’t bear the look of the place. It was too overwhelming. The home was just so empty and along the very walls by the door were moving pictures of herself and Ron. There were pictures of him completing Aura training, and there were pictures of her graduation. </p><p>She rubbed at her face trying to hide it from Ginny because she might have lost everything but her dignity was one thing that she did not want to lose. It was all that she had left. But even the great Hermione Granger-Weasely could not compose herself. She just cried her eyes out, till her chest felt heavy and she was coughing. She ended up leaving the house after Ginny did let go of the careful side hug. </p><p>She just needed to get out of there...</p><p>The yard was not much better, but with the breeze blowing and the flowers that were blooming in the garden’s beds, it was nice. There were pretty white roses climbing up the side fence and she had to look away from it. </p><p>It was a bit easier to picture that she was waiting for Ron to come home, that he would be home any minute, complaining to the man that lived down the street from them about the latest case. He would then pause and look her way and hop over the small gate. He had fallen a few times because while he was coordinated enough he still did make a fool of himself every so often. </p><p>The cement slab that was under her and was the last step to the door started to get hard as she sat out there for far too long. She didn’t even know how long that she sat there. She could feel the heat of the summer sun and feel the breeze as it brushed her bushy hair back. It was soothing as she felt far too warm. </p><p>“You could stay with us for a bit,” Ginny said softly. </p><p>Hermione had almost forgotten that she had someone else sitting there with her. </p><p>“I don’t want to intrude.” She could not make a smile despite her honest effort to. She sounded fragile even to her own ears. She could not hope to say that she would be fine and have a remote chance at being believed. </p><p>“It would not be intruding at all.” Ginny held onto her, pulling her as close as she could. “We’re family and family takes care of one another.” </p><p>She felt tears prick her eyes again. “Thanks….” She croaked out. </p><p>She had to go inside again to get her things, even if she would not be staying. As she passed their room, she stopped by the open doorway to another small bedroom.</p><p>It was the happiest day of her life really when she had started decorating the old study and turning it into a baby room. Ron had been so helpful with transfiguring some of the household objects into things that would be suitable for a baby. Mrs. Weasely had given them a crib for the far corner and a nice pink knitted blanket for when the baby did arrive. </p><p>She had thought that it was possible that things were going to work out despite the after war tensions and the random attacks. She felt stupid standing there in the empty door frame. There was no way that anyone that had served such a man would let her and Ron live out a happy life. If she had been born Rose would have been in danger too. </p><p>Still was it so wrong to want to have had her, despite the danger? Was it so wrong to want to hold the little girl close? </p><p>Even if times were wrong, and things could have gone horribly wrong she could not bring herself to hate the idea of it. She would have been loved. Hermione would have loved her more than anything in the world. She felt again at her belly and then pulled away when she realized what she was doing. </p><p>She for the first time since the accident wished that she had died with them. If she had died Ron would have been devastated, but if they both had gone… </p><p>If they both had gone then she would not be standing here with a feeling of loneliness that was so crushing that it seemed inescapable. She wouldn’t have to feel these things. She knew logically that Harry and the others would have been even more devastated if she was not able to pull through, but she would have never had to see the pain on their faces. She would have been at peace. </p><p>Ginny did have to pull her away from the room in the end because Hermione just couldn't bring herself to move.</p><p>                                                                                                                                         ~/*\~</p><p>The next few weeks were horrible. They had a funeral for Ron, it had only brought the realization that he really was gone. It had made her numb by the end of it all. It did not matter how many people came promising her that it would get better. It did not matter how many Auras came to not only give their condolences but make promises that they would catch the people responsible. </p><p>Hermione had given her memories of the event to them. She didn't really want to answer questions. She spent the days that followed in a haze. She had tried to get herself to have the motivation to go back to work, to try and get something in her besides small bites of Ginny’s cooking and large amounts of tea. </p><p>But it was just so hard. </p><p>Everything felt so hard. </p><p>Harry was the one that eventually broke through the haze. He had said in no short of terms that he wished that he could go back and stop it all from happening. He wished that things were different but there was no real way to change it. And that had really been what got Hermione to thinking, what if there really was a way to stop it all from happening?</p><p>Now she knew that she really by the laws of time could not stop Ron’s death or the death of their child from happening. As she looked more at the memory than she wanted to. She had picked it apart so there really truly would be no way to go back without her old self and her new self interacting. </p><p>But there was one thing that she could do. She could go back and kill Voldemort before he rose to power, and long before he would become a threat. To do that it would have to be when he was younger as Harry had told her long before when he had faced Tom Riddle the Diary in the chamber of secrets he was already quite powerful even in his early teenage years. </p><p>It was a stupid idea and she had to be half mad to be considering it. But as the second month since Ron’s death dragged by the thought of stopping the Dark Lord from ever existing and stopping him from causing nothing but pain on par with her own for countless others fueled her into thinking more and more about it.</p><p>And it hit the point where she was checking books out about it, scavenging through tombs that should never be read. The Dark Arts were not something that she was comfortable with, but if it could help her… </p><p>If she could stop all the pain then her soul for the salvation of hundreds of lives was a small price to pay. </p><p>If she did this, then there was no going back. Her trip to the 1920s would be permanent and whatever damage that she did while there would be permanent. She would be trapped there till either she fell apart by not taking the proper precautions and anchoring herself to that time or she would die long before she could see the people that she currently loved be born into the world.</p><p>They would not know her if she did this. They would grow up in a world that was not tainted by a war that destroyed families. She would not exist to the wizarding world, having done her task and slipped her way out of history. And if she ran into trouble, with the Muggle World Wars or otherwise there would be no one able to help.</p><p>Even with all the risk Hermione still believed that it was worth it. She had nothing really to live for any way at this point, or at least it felt that way. She would never tell the others that though. </p><p>There were, of course, a few ways to go back in time that she knew of one way was with a time turner and the other was with rituals. </p><p>Most of the time turners had been collected and destroyed. But that did not mean that they all were. Nor did that mean that she would be able to for sure get her hands on such a device. But she could try. They would be things that were offered on the black market and if she was careful then she could be able to get her hands on one. They had safety precautions in place and learning to manipulate one into allowing her to travel further back than what was allowed could cause problems. </p><p>There were also a few rituals. She had just found one with the means to do what she wanted to do. It could send her back to any specific time, but it was complicated. There were things that easily could go wrong. But she was willing to take the risk. </p><p>Blood magic would get her back to that December night when Tom Riddle would be born. It would be a lot of blood, and she would possibly be a little woozy after it. Some ancient magic was like that though there was a give and there was a take. </p><p>There was still the issue with lasting damage that could be done to a person that stayed in the past for long periods of time. She would have to combat that with crafting and anchoring ruin so even if she altered the time frame greatly like she planned to do she would not just stop existing. She could make a talisman, but then that thing would need to be worn at all times.</p><p>No, the better option was to carve the symbols into herself so the only way to break her anchor would be to cause great damage to the ruin itself. </p><p>                                                                                                                                         ~/*\~</p><p>Hermione knew that even if she did the ritual that she was planning that something could go wrong. It was not like time-traveling like she was doing was an exact science. To better prepare herself she read as much as she could about the culture and time frame that she would be entering. </p><p>It would not do if she wanted to live out her life in the past if she would find herself in the middle of a bombing raid or where Nazis would be marching. She also needed to blend into the culture of the time and as such, she would need to know what was expected of women from both the Muggle world and the Wizarding. </p><p>It didn’t take her long to bring herself up to a sufficient speed about what to expect. Nor did it stop her from stuffing her bead bag with every scrap of paper that she knew that she would miss as it would not have been written yet. </p><p>The very last thing that she did was barrow memories from Dumbledor’s old pensive that Harry had taken with him home after the battle of Hogwarts. He tended to use it to help him look over cases and allowed Hermione to use it on occasion. She had used it to relive Ron’s death night over and over. She had lied when she said that she had visited old memories of him. And she did feel a bit bad for lying to Harry but not enough not to look into ways to save them all. She had recently though stolen and looked through the memories that were collected on one Tom Riddle. And by what she had seen she found that she felt a bit sorry for the boy that would become the Dark Lord, but not enough to put aside her plans. </p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                                                          ~/*\~</p><p>The carving was a lot harder than she had expected. She knew that it would be painful but she had not known how bad that it would be until she had started. She had decided to place the symbols on her leg as it would be the 1920’s and it would be easier to conceal that way if it was on her upper thigh. The ruins had to be carefully done and it took her hours due to both the pain of it but also because she did not want to accidentally mess up and have to start all over again. Not when she needed the mark to be cursed to make it permanent. </p><p>When her very careful ruins were done she started to work on clearing her basement for room in which to draw the ancient symbols. She had started with making sure that the lines were made in chalk before she took to going over them with the blood of a few animals. She then lit a few candles and placed them on the few swirls in her complex web of runes and enchantments. </p><p>She positioned herself in the center of the web. Stood in the exact spot that she needed to and prayed that this would work. She had on her, her trusted bead bag that had everything that she could possibly need for her new life. Everything of value sentimental or otherwise was in there. </p><p>There was no turning back now. She was doing this. </p><p>She read the ancient incantation out loud. The circle began to glow and she could feel the floor was pulling at her, the strength of it brought her to her knees. The book in her hand started to try to fly out of her hands as the pages whipped back and forward and turned themselves. She took the knife that was covered in a potion that would help it to heal the cut it made fast and sliced her arm by the word MUDBLOOD and her blood dripped into a puddle under her feet mixing with the painted lines. It caused the pull to become stronger.</p><p>Her hair was flying around her, and there was an unknown wind that was now starting to blow out each of her candles. </p><p>Suddenly the floor gave way and she was falling into a blackened space. There was nothing but the drips of blood from her arm flying upward and the book in her hand burned. </p><p>And then there was the soft earth under her. It was a field somewhere. She could feel the wetness of the tall grass. She stood casting a drying charm. The place she stood was where her house had been many years in the future. But now it was just a wet patch of uneven grass. </p><p>She put the book into her bag and called forth her wand so that she could take the blood off her clothes it would not do to have blood on her as she started her search for Wool's Orphanage. After all, she had a Dark Lord to kill.</p>
