    <p>
  <span>“How did it happen this time?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom was shocked at the sound of another’s voice in the room, tearing his eyes away from another lifeless body for long enough to glance at the him. Albus Dumbledore, his enemy, his friend, his brother, stood in the doorway of the darkened room, doing nothing for his worsening temper.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Drowned,” Tom spoke, turning back to the body. “I found her floating in the river early this morning.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He didn’t hear Dumbledore step closer, but could feel the older’s urge to reach for him. “And we do not know. . . ?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No.” His voice was angry, </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> was angry. Hadn’t he been through enough, and now, now </span>
  <b>he</b>
  <span> was here to make it worse. “No witnesses, no footprints, no traces of anything to indicate she didn’t jump in the river because she wanted to.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe she did,” the old coot’s voice did nothing to sooth Tom’s nerves, “Maybe she panicked. Or maybe it was an accident.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Or maybe somebody fucking killed her, did you think of that?” He didn’t look at Dumbledore again, beginning to pace the room in attempt to get as far away from the dead girl as possible. “She was the eleventh attempt in eighty years. Don’t you dare tell me this was a fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>accident</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sighing, Dumbledore reached out to touch the dead girl’s pale cheek, “We were so close with this one, weren’t we?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hermione,” Tom snapped, “Her name was Hermione. She was nineteen years old, Albus. Now, because of me, because of </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she’ll never see twenty.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She never would have, had she been the one.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His temper rose again, anger threatening to bubble over and out, but glancing over, he saw compassion, actual compassion in the old coot’s eyes. It soothed his ire, if only for a moment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There’s still time, my boy. Decades to go on-” Albus’ voice was so hopeful, his eyes glistening with that odd cheer he always contained. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m done.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His words seemed to shake Albus, his smile faltering, breath uneven. For a moment, he almost laughed at the shaken look on the elder’s face, but he also felt stricken at his own words, knowing what it meant, almost, almost, wanting to take them back. But, too many had died already.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tom, please,” Albus’ gentle voice, trying to coax him from his dark thoughts, “There’s twenty years left. You can’t be done.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It won’t make a difference.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tom,” There was fear in his voice, anger, “You promised me and the others a century. You will </span>
  <em>
    <span>give</span>
  </em>
  <span> me a century, do you understand?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So many have died already, Albus, I won’t allow another.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I won’t let you fade. Not like this, Tom. Not if I have anything to do with it, do you understand me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom scoffed, staring into Dumbledore’s eyes, “And what exactly do you plan to do, find another willing participant every year until one passes? Until one makes it past </span>
  <em>
    <span>Christmas</span>
  </em>
  <span>?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus’ lips thinned, his eyes showing he knew more than he was telling, he already had a plan. “If that were what I had to do, absolutely. I don’t care what the council says, no one can replace you. There’s a new option.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are you planning you old coot?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“James is having a child. The council allowed it, if we could put it up for the trials. It lines up within the time-limit. We can’t lose you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You would do this to a child? Bring them into the would just to- to- force them into this,” Tom thrust his hands at the dead body, anger flooding his being, “You would have a child come into this world to die for me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The last one didn’t.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom was taken aback, memories seeming of a past life flooding his thoughts. Someone he was once, still is, in love with. This new version could never replace them, same genes or not, “I could never love them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You don’t have to. But, I think you might.” Albus’ infuriating grin was back. Tom wanted nothing more than to remove it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And why is that?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s James’ child.”</span>
