          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was just a simple cloth. Thick cotton with tiny ducks wearing clown noses. It was such a stupid pattern, but seeing that cloth slung over his partners shoulder made him feel like he finally had a home. </p><p>Draco was bouncing the baby and patting his back. </p><p>“Harry, thank god you’re home. He won’t stop crying. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong!”</p><p>“Shhh,” Harry said as he reached out to take Orion from a frantic Draco. “Did you call--”</p><p>The fire flared behind him and out bustled a flushed Molly Weasley.</p><p>“I’m here, I’m here!” said Molly as she grabbed the cloth off of Draco’s shoulder and scooped the baby out of Harry’s arms. </p><p>“Oh my darling.“ She held him on his back and rubbed his tummy. “Grandma’s here.” She looked up at them, eyes bright, “It’s just a touch of colic, Bill had it too.”</p><p>There was another whoosh and Narcissa Malfoy stumbled out of the fireplace, wearing a muggle t-shirt and pajama bottoms of all things, her elegant blonde hair stuffed into a messy bun. </p><p>“Darling, is the baby okay? Tilly said it was urgent!”</p><p>Narcissa froze, clearly caught off guard in the face of Molly Weasley. </p><p>Molly smiled. </p><p>“He’s just got a touch of colic I think.” She offered the baby to Narcissa.</p><p>Narcissa smiled and took Orion from her. </p><p>“Draco used to have it too. He was impossible. You wouldn’t believe the lungs on him.” She cradled ‘Rion on his tummy, soothing his back. </p><p>“I would,” said Harry as he sat.</p><p>“Hush, you,” chided Molly. “You should have seen Bill, up all night, I thought I’d never get a moments peace! Little did I know, I was lucky. The twins were much worse.” She laughed.</p><p>Narcissa shifted the baby. “May I?” she said as she held her hand out for the cloth.</p><p>“Oh, certainly!”</p><p>Narcissa threw it over her shoulder and shifted Orion so she was massaging and patting his back.</p><p>“He’s my first grandchild.” She kissed Orion’s forehead.</p><p>Molly smiled, “He’s my third.” </p><p>She turned to see Draco and Harry passed out on the couch. </p><p>“But babies always need their Grandmothers.”</p><p>They had never been friends, but something passed between them in that moment. A mutual understanding of their love for their exhausted sons, and for their new grandbaby. In that moment something blossomed, mother to mother. No matter their past, today, they were family.</p></div>
