    <p>Draco,</p><p>I hope you don't mind me calling you Draco - the Potter/Malfoy thing reminds me too much of my teenage years and wasn't that just a picnic. Anyway, I’m writing because every attempt to actually talk to you since the start of the school year has been sidelined by someone or something. The sheer volume of work involved is beyond anything I imagined. Being the Defense teacher is, surprisingly, very different from my time running the DA. I dunno about you but my students seem to love getting detention, the grading and lesson planning is driving me spare and, Merlin, the staff meetings. I thought Binns was bad as a teacher. I know you agree with me on that, we had matching eye rolls yesterday.</p><p>I know I can be oblivious sometimes but after weeks of trying to talk to you with no luck, even I’m not that thick. So, after watching closely, I convinced Minerva a meeting was needed for something or other and that led to quite an interesting conversation and that prompted me to try writing.</p><p>We’ve been managed, manoeuvred, manipulated etc. etc. Given the fact that people have been doing that my whole damn life, I’m not happy about it. Her intentions were good, I know. She was trying to help as were our fellow professors but bloody hell, it just rankles. They were concerned that with our past, it would be best if we were just kept apart to settle in, to get past these first few months without a confrontation or whatever the hell it is they thought we’d do. I, for one, have had enough fighting to last a lifetime. Once you’ve died, the rest is just meh.</p><p>So anyway, I was thinking this over. I mean, this deserves retribution, right? Something fun, something devious, some way to thumb our noses at the collective. I was thinking about the options and thought that perhaps you might have some ideas as well. I’d love it to be bold, creative and high profile. My first thought was to go to the Welcome Back Ball together, like as in a date. Think about it: coordinated outfits, public displays of affection, dancing. What do you think? I’m open to other ideas. I can’t imagine a better co-conspirator than you and look forward to your response.</p><p>Harry</p>
