    <p>Harry Potter forced a breath into his lungs but it stopped in his throat. Still, he fisted his hands and pushed off the ground unsteadily to face what he knew was death.</p><p>He would not fall to Voldemort on his knees or hide like a child. He would stare down his death head on, like his father. Harry’s thoughts briefly settled on his parents, on the questions that he wished he could ask them at this moment - would it hurt, was there something afterwards? - but he shook his head against that. No, he had to act fast if he wanted to keep his bravery. With Cedric lying feet away, he couldn’t count on staying this stupidly stubborn for long. </p><p>Harry Potter pulled out his wand and threw himself around the headstone. Voldemort stood ready for him. His eyes glowed in amusement even as his death eater followers gave a few tight gasps. Together, the Dark Lord and the Boy Who Lived cast their spells.</p><p>“Avada Keda-”</p><p>“Expelliarmus!”</p><p>A green bolt of light shot of from Voldemort’s wand and met the red stream from Harry’s in mid air. Voldemort’s eyes flashed surprised but Harry barely had time to register before a bright light engulfed them.</p><p>***</p><p>“Lily, he’s here! Grab Harry and run! I’ll try and hold him off!”</p><p>James shot to the door, trying to interrupt the shadow that had just blown through it. He wouldn’t be able to give her much time but dammit if he wasn’t going to give his wife and son everything he had. Voldemort’s red eyes were on him now and he saw the smile stretch to them. The sick and utter amusement. James Potter had never felt so powerless in his life. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a flick of what must be the Dark Lord’s wand and knew it was time. Death. He tried not to feel fear.</p><p>“Expelliarmus!”</p><p>There was a bright light as the word echoed through the house and the green light coming from Voldemort’s wand met a stream of red in mid air. A man stumbled backwards, both hands grasping his wand in utter concentration, suddenly between James Potter and the death he knew only moments before.</p><p>The Dark Lord was so surprised, the wands disconnected almost immediately and he took a step back with furious eyes. The man - no, James saw now it was just a boy - blinked in utter bewilderment before raising his wand again.</p><p>“Expelliarmus!” he yelled in a breaking voice. Voldemort’s wand flew from the Dark Lord’s hand and the boy pressed on. “Stupefy!”</p><p>Voldemort shot backwards back through the doorway he had just moments ago entered intent to murder the Potter family. James saw him land on the lawn and with a hiss, took off into the air in obvious confusion and retreat.</p><p>What the hell just happened? How had Voldemort found them? And now he was gone? James Potter’s head was swimming with questions but he had fought the war long enough not to get lost in them. The boy had staggered into the wall, staring out the doorway at where Voldemort disappeared and was in obvious shock. Lily was upstairs with his son. And he needed a wand.</p><p>Spotting the pale piece of wood on the floor, James picked up the discarded wand from the fight and a shudder ran down his spine. Voldemort’s wand. It felt cold and ugly. He wanted to snap it immediately but he didn’t want to be around this kid without some kind of protection.</p><p>He cast the kid a glance. He was filthy, with torn school robes and blood from some hidden wound that may or may not belong to him. He had just taken on the Dark Lord but it was obvious he wasn’t willing to start another fight. The boy was still staring out at the lawn, keeping watch for Death Eaters or for Voldemort to return. Or maybe he was just in spellshock. Whoever he was, wherever he came from, this boy wasn’t a threat to them.</p><p>“Lily!” James called, racing up the stairs without a second glance. He flew open the door to the nursery.</p><p>“Not Harry!” Lily yelled, throwing herself in front of the crib with arms thrown wide like a human shield. Her eyes were wet but her tone was strong. James noted with terror that she was wandless. Kitchen, he realized. She had left it in the kitchen after scooping up their son to take to bed. After taken his own wand because he was making too much noise. Getting the baby too riled up. Five minutes ago they had been laughing. </p><p>“James!”</p><p>Her voice cut through his thoughts, pulling him back to the present. She looked surprised, relieved, scared and ready to fight all at once. Her green eyes met his before flashing dangerously past his shoulder.</p><p>“We need to leave,” he said, his voice catching. “Now. Get Harry.”</p><p>Lily was already scooping him up again, moving from the moment he started to speak. She cooed to him in a tone that wasn’t reaching James’ ears. He was already heading back down the stairs.</p><p>The boy sat on the floor in the entryway, his head between his hands. Dammit, he should’ve been keeping watch. James reached for him when he heard the raspy breathing and flinched, knowing a panic attack when he saw it. Spellshock then. And damn, this close he could see why. How old was this kid, thirteen? Why was he here and where the hell was the Order?</p><p>“Hey!” James snapped, anger started to win against the panic. “Get up, we have to go.”</p><p>The boy’s head snapped up at the voice and green eyes pierced his soul. Lily’s eyes. Harry’s eyes. James took a step back, wondering who the hell this person was. </p><p>Apparently, the same thing was running through the kid’s head because his eyes were wide and frightened and confused. Messy black hair and broken spectacles just like- </p><p>He heard Lily on the stairs and enter the kitchen, hopefully to retrieve her wand. She appeared in the entryway a few moments later and stopped dead.</p><p>“James?” she asked, her eyes on the stranger in the floor with caution.</p><p>“I don’t know,” he said but turned to her, letting her know he trusted the kid. If he was going to attack, he would’ve. Hell, he’d have let Voldemort kill them all. She held his gaze and he nodded. She held out his wand, the one he had left on the couch when she told him to stop making fireworks. Her hand shook when he took it from her but her voice was steady. </p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>“To Dumbledore.” James couldn’t say more. He didn’t want to think about anything beyond getting out. Not why they were leaving. Not who he had just seen. And especially not why. Why that “who” had been here. James moved forward and pulled the kid from the ground roughly. “Can you apparate?” he asked.</p><p>The green eyes held his, never changing from the wide-eyed, almost-hysteric look as the boy shook his head. James cursed. </p><p>“Alright Lily, take Harry to the Leaky Cauldron. I’ll be right behind you.”</p><p>“James,” Lily said, stepping forward. She took his arm but looked at the boy, a crease between her brow. </p><p>“I promise,” James said. “Go now, they could be here any second.” He gave her the briefest of kisses, too brief to be their last kiss and then pressed one onto Harry’s head.</p><p>She nodded and her eyes were green and brilliant and so brave. And then she and his son were gone. Too easily. The wards were down and he felt so exposed in a house he had formed a family in. </p><p>He turned back to the boy who had gotten to his feet beside him. James tried to ignore his appearance, the one that looked an awful lot like himself. Or his son. Dammit, this night was getting weirder. His eyes caught on the scar on the boy’s forehead. A lightning bolt that ran jagged down to the brow. A flaw. Focus on that.</p><p>“Hold onto me,” James said, more gently than he had a minute before. “Tightly. This is going to feel weird.”</p><p>The boy barely nodded and James decided to grab his arm instead of trusting the kid to hold on. He looked like he was going to be sick. The boy hissed in pain when James seized him and he drew back, seeing blood drip down to the floor. Same arm as Death Eaters. Merlin this kid was worse than he looked. James tried gripping him higher, thought of safety and apparated.</p><p>The Leaky Cauldron was empty for the night. The war had taken its toll on the business but it was for the best for nights like this. James opened his eyes and felt the boy lurch beside him. He held him long enough to keep him from crashing into a table but the kid was already falling to his knees and puking. James let him.</p><p>Lily was speaking to Tom a few feet away, bouncing Harry to keep him quiet. Who was on duty tonight? James couldn’t remember the schedule after the nerve-wrecking encounter and being out of the Order routine for too long. He hated hiding. He hated running. And now they were flying broomsticks blind into a storm. </p><p>“James?” a voice asked from behind. James had his wand drawn and eye level before he was turned around and Kingsley had one hand up and the other with a wand pointed at him. His eyes scanned the room. “Lily?”</p><p>“Last thing you ever said to me?” James demanded, hand twitching. He heard Lily’s conversation stop and Harry begin to fuss somewhere behind him. He’d protect them. Give his life for them. </p><p>“I said you ought to learn how to change a nappy,” Kingsley said. “What's the name of my house elf?”</p><p>“You don't have one.” The tense moment stretched on until it broke and both men lowered their wands. James felt his shoulders relax but Kingsley looked more on guard. </p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Voldemort,” James said. “He attacked.” The auror was not expecting that. Kingsley might not have ever hosted a more shocked expression. </p><p>“Come on, we need to get out of sight.” Kingsley nodded his head to the stairs as his gaze overtook the bar. They locked on the kid James had dragged with him.</p><p>“Who’s he?”</p><p>James shrugged. “I don’t know but he saved our life. Is he part of the Order?”</p><p>“Not that I know of,” Kingsley said. “Too young.”</p><p>“Stopped a Avada with an Expelliarmus.” James was wrong. Kingsley could appear more shocked.</p><p>“That’s impossible.”</p><p>“I saw it.”</p><p>Kingsley looked back at the broken boy on the floor. “Merlin’s beard.” </p><p>“Come on, help me get him up. Lily?”</p><p>“The Phoenix Suite is ready for us,” she said. The nodded to Tom, who led her upstairs. With a tight hold on their son, she followed. </p><p>Two men hooked an arm under the boy’s shoulders to heave him off the floor. He looked dazed and on the brink of passing out. James tried not to look at him. There was something haunting about his expression, something dark that shouldn’t be there on someone so young. </p><p>Together they made it to the suite and Kingsley sent word to Dumbledore. The stranger took a chair across from Lily while she tried to calm Harry. The poor boy had just escaped death and was now being jostled left and right. James wished he could put his son in a crib and promise a million safe nights. Soon, he promised himself.</p><p>James couldn’t sit with so many nerves and settled for guarding the door, clutching his wand in his hand. He vowed never leave it anywhere again. If he did, he would be dead. It would’ve been so easy. He saw the possibility earlier that night. And Lily too. And Harry.</p><p>He forced a hand through his hair, trying to suppress the panic and anger threatening to rip him apart. Voldemort had been at his house. Right in front of him. And despite the fact that James had been completely powerless, the reason the bastard had been there was not something James wanted to think about.</p><p>Because it couldn’t be true. It wasn’t. If Voldemort had been there, then Peter… No. Something else had happened. There was something wrong but it wasn’t, it couldn’t be, it hadn’t been-</p><p>A flash of phoenix light brought the old headmaster into the room with such force, James had to shield his eyes. Harry began to cry in earnest now as Dumbledore surveyed the room. His eyes met James and seemed to know the strain of the last half hour.</p><p>“Professor?”</p><p>The voice was so quiet they almost didn’t hear it. They all turned to the stranger who had risen from his chair, a flicker of life finally appearing on his face. Dumbledore spun to the boy and the kid reached out, grasping his arm in a panic.</p><p>“Professor, he’s back!” he said in hurried voice. James jumped forward but Dumbledore held up his other hand, telling the others to stand down. He never took his eyes from the stranger. </p><p>“He’s back! Wormtail was there. He t-took my blood. Some ritual. And Cedric-” Pain flashed through the boy’s face and he nearly collapsed. “Cedric’s dead. He’s- He must still be in the graveyard. I left him. I left him there.” </p><p>His voice sounded so pained James turned away. He met Lily’s eyes across the room and felt the same remorse radiating from her. Who was this boy that had saved them? Where had he come from that he rushed right back into facing Voldemort?</p><p>“It’s alright son,” Dumbledore said, easing the stranger back into the chair. “Right now we must get you all back to safety. Right now, we must move.” He turned his gaze to James.</p><p>“Hogwarts?” Lily asked.</p><p>“Until we can set something else up, I think so.” Dumbledore sighed. “Kingsley, we’ll need a portkey.”</p><p>“Yes sir,” Shacklebolt said and began to search his robes.</p><p>“Professor?” the boy asked again. His gaze had wandered back to James and locked in on the man. James felt a shudder run through him. Something oddly familiar about this kid. “Are my parents really here or am I… am I mad?” That haunting look kept James glued in his place.</p><p>“I’m afraid, dear boy,” Dumbledore said, “that there are many questions that will need answering tonight. All in good time. Please, stay still.” He pulled out his wand and flicked it at the boy’s leg. There was a cracking sound and the boy flinched before his face relaxed. James hadn’t even noticed the broken leg.</p><p>Then the headmaster crossed over to James and his eyes were missing all of the mysterious sparkles that seemed to permanent during the school years. </p><p>“Can I assume you have no idea who he is?” he asked in a low voice. </p><p>James raised his eyebrows. “I thought you knew him,” he said. Lily had joined them and he let his arm find her waist. He didn’t want her anywhere else but next to him from now on. </p><p>“So, apparently, does he.” There was amusement in that but it passed quickly. Then his eyes became hard.</p><p>“He disarmed Voldemort,” James said. He pulled the cold and evil wand from his robe pocket and held it out. “Saved our lives.” Lily gasped, eyes wide. Her arm gripped his tighter.</p><p>Dumbledore took the wand and studied with unreadable features. </p><p>“What does it mean, Professor?” Lily asked.</p><p>The professor looked at her for several long moment, his thoughts hidden to them before looking down at baby Harry who was playing with his mother’s hair. The old man stroked the child’s head once and said, “I haven’t the faintest.”</p>
