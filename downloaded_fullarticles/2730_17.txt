    <p>Draco wakes up, and his first immediate thought is that his abdominal muscles are sore. He lets out an exasperated groan as he moves to sit up on his bed. It’s then that he realizes that he’s not in his bed. Draco looks around, he wasn’t at home. If he didn’t know any better he might say he was in hospital but he would have no reason for being in hospital. The next thing Draco wonders is what that horribly pleasant metallic taste in his mouth is.</p><p>“Ah, Mister Malfoy, you’re awake,” Draco looks over to his left, finally taking in his surroundings, and the uncomfortable bed.</p><p>“My name is Tilly Rowe, and I’m your matron.”</p><p>“What’s going on?” he asks, looking down at himself, he was in Hospital, why was he in hospital?</p><p>“You’ve had an accident,” the matron says, walking into the room, taking a closer look at Draco’s chart.</p><p>“An accident?” he repeats, wondering what kind of accident he could have possibly had. He couldn’t remember being in an accident.</p><p>“Do you know where you are Mister Malfoy?”</p><p>Draco frowns, he didn’t but he made an assumption, “St. Mungo’s.”</p><p>“Very good,” Tilly mummers marking the chart, “And do you know what day it is?”</p><p>Draco frowns, was it Friday? How long had he been here, what the hell actually happened to him?</p><p>“Um, Friday,” Draco answers, that was the last he remembered, he remembered it being Friday, and he had plans to meet friends for dinner.</p><p>“Hmm,” The matron mutters, marking the chart again.</p><p>“Is it not Friday?” Draco asks after a moment.</p><p>“It’s alright Mister Malfoy, you’re safe here,” she says, “Confirm the name of your mother and father please?”</p><p>Draco frowns starting to wonder if something bad had also happened to his parents, “Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy,” he says quickly, “Are my parents alright?” he asks.</p><p>“Your parents are fine,” Tilly assures him, and Draco relaxes for a moment, “They were just here this morning, I’m sure they’ll be back as soon as we alert them you’ve woken.”</p><p>Draco frowns again, “How long have I been here?” he asks.</p><p>“It’s been three days, Mister Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco stares in shock, “Three days? I’ve been asleep in hospital for three days?”</p><p>“We will help you sort everything, don’t you worry,” she says.</p><p>“What happened to me?” He asks, starting to inspect his body, his pale skin was bruised, almost everywhere, which explained the soreness he was feeling.</p><p>“You were attacked.”</p><p>“By who?” he asks.</p><p>Tilly frowns solemnly, “They don’t know yet.”</p><p>“They?”</p><p>“The Aurors,” she says, “They waited for you to regain consciousness, but when you were still unconscious the following day they left, but there is one who has been coming in the evenings to check on you, I can call them now if you’d like.”</p><p>“Do they know what happened to me?” he asks trying not to sound frantic.</p><p>“I’m not sure,” she answers honestly.</p><p>Draco sighs heavily, watching her retrieve some medical supplies from the cupboard.</p><p>“I’d like to go back to sleep,” Draco says after a moment, “Can I see my parents later please?”</p><p>She nods, “I’ll send for your parents straight away, I’m just going to hang this for you, and then I’ll let you get back to sleep,” she says, hanging a bag of blood, and Draco watches curiously.</p><p>“This should help,” she says.</p><p>“Help with what?” Draco asks, watching the blood bag start to drain.</p><p>“The cravings, I’m sure you’ve probably noticed by now, considering how long it’s been,” she says.</p><p>Draco stares back at her, “The hell are you going on about?”</p><p>“Your affliction,” she says.</p><p>“What affliction?” he asks becoming irritated.</p><p>“The vampirism,” she says looking back at Draco.</p><p>“Vampirism?” he asks dumbly, “I am not a vampire,” Draco says, staring back at her, when she doesn’t say anything else, Draco quickly reaches for the plastic tubing carrying the blood from the newly hung blood bag, however the nurse was quicker than he was, quickly stilling his hand.</p><p>“Do not touch that Mister Malfoy, this is not up for discussion.”</p><p>Draco watches her for another moment, “I am not a vampire,” he insists, but he also noticed the way that horrible metallic taste in his mouth seems to lessen as he watches the blood drain, and rather quickly from the blood bag.</p><p>“Now that you’re awake we can assess the severity of your condition,” she says, “do not touch that while I am gone,” Tilly says glaring down at him, “I’ll be back in a moment.”</p><p>Draco is quiet, as he watches her leave the room, and walk down the hall. Draco reaches up, pulling down the blood bag, reading over the label. It seemed like an ordinary blood bag to him, though he hadn’t really seen a lot of blood bags, so he really couldn’t know.</p><p>“Mister Malfoy,” The matron scolds, when she comes back, using a spell to hang the bag back up.</p><p>Draco rolls his eyes, “I wasn’t doing anything.”</p><p>“Learn to follow directions Mister Malfoy,” she says simply, “we’re going to run a series of tests now, and then you can go back to sleep.”</p><p>Draco raises an eyebrow, he actually wasn’t feeling very tired anymore, he was actually feeling quite energized, “What kind of tests?”</p><p>The tests hadn’t taken very long, Draco had received checks on just about every test she had performed, and Draco didn’t think that was a good thing, but seeing as she only hung one additional blood bag before leaving the room. Draco lays down on the bed, he’s not even sure he could go back to sleep now if he wanted to, his head was spinning as he tried to think about what happened to him. When Draco does decide to close his eyes, he’s out like a light.</p><p> </p><p>Draco isn’t sure how long he’s slept for, but when he wakes up, he’s hyper-aware of another person in the room. He sits up quickly, his eyes adjusting to the darkness of the room, as he looks around the room. If he didn’t know himself, he would have thought that involuntary noise he made was some sort of a growl.</p><p>A darkened figure emerges from what he assumed was the doorway, “It’s alright, I didn’t mean to scare you.”</p><p>Draco narrows his eyes, he knew that voice, “Potter?” he asks slightly shocked, “The hell are you doing here?”</p><p>“I’m just here to help,” Harry says, stepping closer to the bed, “They said you came to earlier, so I came as soon as I could.”</p><p>“Why?” Draco asks still not understanding.</p><p>“I’m here to help you find out who did this to you,” Harry says, “who attacked you.”</p><p>Draco had been attacked.</p><p>“Vampire,” he mutters more to himself, but Harry nods.</p><p>“You were attacked by a vampire, on Friday evening,” Harry confirms.</p><p>Draco glares over at Harry, wondering why he had to be the one to be here, instead of any other Auror, “Why are you here?”</p><p>Harry frowns, he thought he had just explained this to him, “I’m here to help-“</p><p>“Why you, instead of someone else?” Draco says interrupting.</p><p>Harry was put off by this question, this was his job he wasn’t going to stop doing his job just because he had personal issues with the victim, “Well it happened in my district, while I was on duty, therefore it’s my case.”</p><p>Of course, just what Draco wanted, he didn’t want to admit that Harry <em>might</em> be able to help him figure out what exactly happened to him.</p><p>“Well I don’t know what happened to me, so you might as well go,” Draco says.</p><p>Harry pulls up a chair and sits down, “I’m not going anywhere until we’ve figured out who did this to you,” he says.</p><p>Draco settles back into his bed looking up at the ceiling, “I’m telling you, I don’t remember anything.”</p><p>“What is the last thing you do remember?” Harry asks.</p><p>Draco thinks back to the last thing he remembered, “I was talking to Blaise, he came to my house, said that I had to come out with them we were going to a pub, and then meeting some others.”</p><p>“Who else did you meet?” Harry asks curiously.</p><p>Draco shrugs, “That’s the last thing I remember, I don’t remember leaving my house, I don’t remember anything after that. I was standing by the fireplace with Blaise, and that’s it.”</p><p>“Do you know which pub you were going to?” Harry asks.</p><p>“I don’t remember,” Draco says looking over at Harry, he can’t help but notice the way Harry’s heartbeat seems to grow louder in his ear, he watches Harry shift in the chair, but all Draco can focus on is the vein in Harry’s neck, he can hear the flow of liquid as it runs through his veins, and the next thing Draco knows, he has a pair of long sharp fangs, protruding from his mouth, with a very audible click.</p><p> </p><p>Draco quickly covers his mouth with his hand, scooting to the far side of the bed, trying to get away from Harry as quickly as he could.</p><p>Harry stares with wide eyes, he hadn’t expected that he hadn’t expected to see Draco like that. He doesn’t want to be scared, but he watches the silver of Draco’s eyes begin to turn red, and he can’t help it, he’d never seen anything like it before and he wants to say he’s mostly fascinated, but he could see that Draco was scared, Draco was afraid of himself. Harry didn’t also need to be afraid of him.</p><p>“Hey,” he says softly, “It’s alright,” he says quietly trying to coax Draco back to him, “It’s okay Malfoy.”</p><p>“It’s not alright, I have fucking fangs,” he says, his voice quivering until just now he hadn’t believed that anything anyone had been saying to him, but he had fangs, he couldn’t deny what was literally on his face right now.</p><p>“Malfoy,” Harry says gently.</p><p>“How do I make them go away?” Draco asks frantically.</p><p>Harry frowns thinking to himself, he didn’t actually know any vampires, he had no idea what to say, “I, um, I’m not sure,” Harry mutters before getting up, “I’ll get the healer.”</p><p>Draco hates the way he’s actually scared of his body right now. He watches Harry exit the room, and he can’t help but drag his fingers across the long fang, he gasps, feeling the fang pierce the tip of his finger.</p><p>“Mister Malfoy,” the matron says entering the room, “Are you alright?” Tilly asks moving to get a closer look, “Oh dear,” she mutters.</p><p>“How do I get rid of these?” he asks, quickly.</p><p>She reaches out examining the fangs, “I’ll bring you another blood bag,” she says before getting up, walking back into the hallway.</p><p>Draco watches Harry standing awkwardly outside of the room, he closes his eyes trying to think about how this could have happened to him. How he got this way, he was so lost right now.</p><p>“Here you are,” the matron returns a moment later, hanging a new blood bag, replacing the empty.</p><p>Draco stares back at her, “Why is this happening?” he asks.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to run through that last bag so quickly, when your thirst reaches a certain point, it just sort of happens on its own,” she explains, “but with time, and practice you’ll be able to control it on your own.”</p><p>“Vampires drink blood,” Draco says, “I haven’t been.”</p><p>“I can get you a glass if you’d like,” she says, “But this is just as effective.”</p><p>No sooner than she finished saying that, did Draco’s fangs begin to recede.</p><p>“Feeling better?” she asks.</p><p>Draco nods, still a little shaky.</p><p>“You will have to consume some sort of blood, now you’ll have to figure out what method of consumption you wish to use, drinking tends to be the easiest, but a lot of new vampires tend to start with blood foods, as it makes the transition easier, you can get blood from special banks, some vampires consume straight from the blood bags, and there are facilities for human consumption, I’ll leave you all the information you’d like,” she says watching Draco for another moment, “Are you alright?”</p><p>Draco nods again, “I think so,” he says feeling his fangs retreat fully.</p><p>“The younger vampires tend to go through blood a bit quicker, so I’m gonna bring you another bag,” she says, before exiting the room.</p><p>Draco sighs pulling his knees up to his chest, “You can come in Potter, no need to stand in the hall.”</p><p>Harry clears his throat awkwardly, “I can come back tomorrow,” he insists stepping inside.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Draco insists.</p><p>Harry nods, sitting down beside the bed once more. Harry looks up watching as the matron returns a moment later, setting a second bag on the counter, “for when you’re ready dear,” she says softly, before leaving them to talk.</p><p>“Don’t you have a list of vampires somewhere?” Draco asks.</p><p>“Well no,” Harry says, “it would be a vast list, and not even counting the half-vampires.”</p><p>“There can’t be that many vampires in London,” Draco says.</p><p>“More than you think,” Harry says.</p><p>Draco frowns, “Well I can’t remember what happened that night, have you talked to Blaise?”</p><p>Harry nods, “We did, and he told us that you were talking to Astoria and that the two of you went to talk alone, and he said that Astoria came back maybe twenty minutes later, saying that she was going to leave,” Harry explains.</p><p>Draco wracks his brain trying to remember this encounter.</p><p>“We talked to Astoria yesterday, she confirmed you two had a talk, and that you left on your own, but told no one where you were going,” Harry says.</p><p>“I don’t remember any of that,” Draco says.</p><p>Harry nods, “It’s alright, something might come to you as you recover, I’ll come back in a few days, and see if you remember anything, yeah?” he says getting up, “If you remember anything before then, just send me an owl.”</p><p>Draco sighs, “yeah, alright.”</p><p>Harry looks back at Draco for a moment, “I am sorry this happened to you,” he says quietly, before turning and leaving the room.</p><p>Draco sighs laying back down on the bed, noting that he’d already gone through a quarter of the blood bag, he wondered if this rate of blood consumption would slow down.</p><p> </p><p>“Draco,” the soft voice brings Draco out of his trance.</p><p>“Mother,” he says looking over, seeing her standing in the doorway.</p><p>“You’re alright,” she says hurrying to her son’s bedside, “I was so scared.”</p><p>Draco frowns, “You look like you haven’t slept in days,” he mummers.</p><p>“I haven’t slept since I found out,” she says, “I stayed for three days by your bedside, I left for the first time this morning, to shower and change my clothes, I was going to come back straight away.”</p><p>“You need to sleep,” Draco says, hating the thought of his mother suffering because of him.</p><p>“I need to take care of you, what happened to you Draco?” she asks.</p><p>“I can’t remember,” he says, “you need your rest mother,” Draco insists.</p><p>“I won’t be able to rest until you’re safe at home,” Narcissa says.</p><p>Of course, Draco thinks to himself trying his best not to roll his eyes, “Then take me home.”</p><p>Narcissa frowns, “are you well?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Draco says, “but I want to go home,” he did want to go home, he was honestly scared of how he was going to behave around other people, but he didn’t want his mother suffering like this because of him, and he wanted his own comfortable bed.</p><p>“Please Draco,” Narcissa says softly, “I don’t want anything else to happen to you.”</p><p>“Well I don’t think it can get much worse, I’m already a sodding vampire,” Draco grumbles.</p><p>“Is it bad?” she asks quietly, looking back at her son reaching for his hand.</p><p>“I have fangs,” Draco says looking back at his mother.</p><p>Narcissa stares back at Draco, looking absolutely shocked, “What?” she asks with a quiver in her voice.</p><p>“I have fangs,” he repeats.</p><p>“No, you don’t,” she insists, “You can’t.”</p><p>“Well I do,” he snarls.</p><p>Draco pulls his hand from his mother’s grasp, turning away from her.</p><p>Narcissa wills herself not to cry, “Draco,” she murmurs.</p><p>Draco’s only response is to pull the thin sheet over his body, keeping his back turned toward his mother. He only wanted her to take care of him, but the fact that she was so horrified by what he now was, hurt him in a way he couldn’t explain or understand.</p><p>Narcissa watches Draco for a moment, before she gently lays her head against Draco’s shoulder, staying quiet for the rest of the night.</p><p> </p><p>The following evening Draco was released from St. Mungo’s and went home with his mother.</p><p>“Is it true?” Lucius asks when Draco arrives back home.</p><p>Draco knew exactly what he was talking about, “Yes, it’s true,” Draco says, standing in front of his father.</p><p>“It can’t be,” Lucius says, “After everything we went through!”</p><p>“Lucius please!” Narcissa snarls at her husband.</p><p>“Yes father, because I fucking wanted this!” Draco says angrily, “I fucking went out looking for a vampire to attack me and turn me into one of them.”</p><p>“We can’t,” Lucius says, “if anyone were to ever find out.”</p><p>“Well it’s going to be kind of hard to hide the fangs, and the aversion to light,” Draco snaps, “What’s left for people to do or say about us that they haven’t already, huh father? What?” Draco says.</p><p>“You must go,” Lucius says, “You must go now, and never return.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Draco stares dumbly at his father at the same time, Narcissa grabs onto Draco’s arm, in a grip that certainly should have hurt, but Draco couldn’t care less right now.</p><p>“We will pay for you to go somewhere else, but we will have no chance of recovering from this,” Lucius says, “you have to go Draco.”</p><p>“You are not taking my son away from me,” Narcissa says firmly, “I refuse Lucius.”</p><p>Lucius glares back at his wife, “Narcissa, our family name.”</p><p>“I don’t care about our family name!” Narcissa says that wasn’t true though, she cared very much about the way people saw her. She came from wizarding royalty, and there was a certain level of prestige she was expected to have, and that did not include a vampire for a son.</p><p>“You are pathetic,” Draco says before his father can say anything else, “we are here because of you because you failed because you put our family in danger by siding with a homicidal failure, who was too scared to do his own damn bidding. You stepped up to take part in that, and you couldn’t hold your end of the bargain,” Draco says harshly, “That is why we are here, why we are a disgrace to the wizarding community because your precious leader wanted to punish you,” Draco says glaring at his father.</p><p>“Draco don’t say that,” Narcissa hisses.</p><p>“It’s the fucking truth!” Draco says angrily.</p><p>“Draco please,” Narcissa says, and her voice quivers.</p><p>Draco looks at his mother for a moment, before turning to look back at his father, “Don’t worry father, I will go, and I’ll never come back.”</p><p>“Draco no,” Narcissa says, no longer trying to hide the tears that were now flowing down her cheeks.</p><p>“Stop crying mother,” he says, gently removing her hand from his arm, “It’s better this way, I’ll go tomorrow evening,” he says looking at his father before turning to walk to his room.</p><p> </p><p>Draco can’t actually believe this is happening to him, but he refuses to let himself feel sorry for himself, he was Draco Malfoy, and vampire or not he had pride in himself.</p><p>After being in his room for a few hours, Draco begins to feel that metallic taste fill his mouth again, he quickly grabs a blood bag from the desk before sitting down on the edge of the bed. He wasn’t actually sure how he was going to do this, but he really couldn’t stand to see the sight of himself with fangs right now, not after everything that happened tonight.</p><p>Draco stares down at the blood bag trying to figure out how it opens, he pulls on the tab on the bottom of the bag, and it made a tiny popping noise. Draco could feel the fangs sprout, and the clicking noise loud in his ears, as the scent of the fresh blood filled his nostrils. Bringing the bag to his lips Draco began to suck, a large amount of blood filling his mouth all at once sent his senses into overdrive. Draco swallows quickly pulling the bag away from his mouth, and blood began to spill from his mouth. Draco quickly swallows the blood, wiping his mouth now covered in blood with the back of his hand.</p><p>After a moment Draco brings the blood bag back to his mouth starting to suck again, this time trying to be more controlled with his drinking. With no success, blood filled his mouth too quickly and spilled over the sides of his mouth again. Draco swallows quickly, panting slightly as he tries to regain control over himself. Draco can feel the fangs in his mouth beginning to tingle, he decides to finish off the bag completely. This time he wasn’t going to stop, he was making too much of a mess.</p><p>Draco brings the bag to his mouth once more, sucking quickly and swallowing at the same time. Draco finds himself getting lost in the sensation of the blood traveling through his fangs, causing them to recede back into his mouth, and the room temperature blood to drip down his throat. Draco felt a sort of warm sensation that reminded him of drinking a warm butterbeer. Draco squeezes the bag tight, as the last bit of blood flows into his mouth.</p><p>Looking down at himself, Draco was sure that he had murdered a small animal. Draco reaches for his wand, using a cleaning spell to clean himself up, before trying to sort out what the hell he was going to do. He was so impulsive, but he was eighteen he couldn’t be to blame for that. He would figure it out, he had to, as his father said he was on his own now.</p><p> </p><p>The following night Draco finds himself at Astoria’s house, he’s not sure why he came here, but he figured it was one night, and anywhere else was better than the manor right now.</p><p>“You can’t stay here Draco,” Astoria says quietly, the two of them standing just outside her house.</p><p>“I know we had a fight Astoria, but I don’t remember what it was about, I promise not to hurt you in your sleep,” he says.</p><p>“It’s not about that, I can’t be around you right now, not after everything,” she says.</p><p>“Can you tell me what we had a fight about?” Draco asks.</p><p>“It wasn’t a fight,” she says, “we broke up,” she says looking at Draco for any recognition.</p><p>“We broke up?” he asks.</p><p>“You broke up with me,” she says, “I’m not angry Draco, but I can’t be around you right now.”</p><p>“That sounds like you’re angry,” he says.</p><p>Astoria shakes her head, “I’m not angry, I’m relieved if anything, but right now I need space.”</p><p>Draco sighs heavily, “Why did we break up?”</p><p>Astoria looks away for a moment, “You’ll have to sort that yourself.”</p><p>“Why can’t you just tell me?” he asks.</p><p>“Because it’s not the kind of thing you hear from another person, it’s something you sort on your own.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco checks himself into a hotel that night, figuring he would sort out where he was going to stay the following night. He still wasn’t used to this whole night time schedule yet. When Draco gets into his hotel room the first thing he does is empty his shoulder bag, taking out three pouches of blood, laying them on the desk in the room. Draco decided to grab a glass this time, that had gone over well earlier when he had his first bag.</p><p>Draco opens the bag of blood, pouring half into a glass, before setting the bag back on the desk. Draco drinks his blood, he still didn’t have the hang of this down, but he was making less of a mess than he had made yesterday, and he did hope that with time this would get easier. Draco was startled by a knock at the door. He wasn’t expecting anyone, he thought maybe his mother had tracked him down, he gets up walking to the door, he was completely surprised when he opened the door.</p><p>“Potter?” he says, standing with the door half open.</p><p>“Hi, Malfoy.” Harry was so awkward, how that man got anything done Draco would never understand.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” he asks.</p><p>“I stopped by your house, but your parents said you had moved out,” he says.</p><p>“How did you even know I was here?” he asks next.</p><p>“Well I just sort of asked around, Astoria said you’d seen her only about an hour ago, and I just went from there,” he says shrugging.</p><p>“Well what do you want?” he asks.</p><p>“To talk,” Harry says, “I uh, brought you this,” he says holding out what appeared to be a lollie, “It’s a blood lollie, I thought it might help.”</p><p>Draco looks suspiciously at the candy, “Hmm,” he takes the candy from Harry, looking closer it did appear to be a blood lollie, he was curious now.</p><p>“Come in then,” Draco says stepping aside, letting Harry enter his room.</p><p>Harry steps inside the room and Draco closes the door behind him, “sit anywhere I guess,” he says walking back to his glass.</p><p>Harry sits on the edge of the bed, watching Draco take a drink of blood from the glass. He can’t help but notice the dribble that escapes Draco’s mouth.</p><p>“You’ve got a little dribble,” Harry says after a moment.</p><p>Draco wipes at his mouth, “It’s not instinctual, apparently there’s a certain skill level to it,” he says, “I suppose I’ll get there eventually.”</p><p>Harry nods, “you think it’s the fangs that make it difficult?” he asks curiously.</p><p>Draco ponders this for a moment, “They definitely don’t help,” he decides.</p><p>“You would think that it would be easier because they would hold into place,” Harry says thinking aloud.</p><p>“Not exactly, I’ve learned that the fangs actually take in a bit, and the more they take in, the quicker it gets into your system and satisfies the need, and the quicker the fangs can go away,” he says.</p><p> </p><p>Harry doesn’t mean to, but he can’t stop staring at Draco’s mouth as he talks, he tells himself it’s because he’s wondering about his fangs again.</p><p>“Apparently new vampires, tend to be sloppy drinkers, so they go through a lot more than older vampires.”</p><p>Harry ponders this for a moment, “I didn’t realize.”                                                                            </p><p>Draco shrugs, “I don’t think anyone who isn’t a vampire would know any of that.”</p><p>“Has the transition been difficult?” Harry asks.</p><p>“Yes,” Draco says without hesitation.</p><p>Harry frowns, “I’m sorry,” he says rather quietly.</p><p>Draco takes another drink from his glass, “shit,” he mutters as a little bit of blood drips down the side of his mouth. He sighs heavily, wiping the sides of his mouth again.</p><p>“This is a fucking nightmare.”</p><p>“Have you,” Harry pauses a moment, “you know, tried feeding,” he says quietly.</p><p>Draco is pretty sure he knew what Harry meant, “No, I haven’t, I don’t think I’m ready for that, I think maybe mastering the completely not alive bag might need to come first, I mean I’ve been using glasses all my life, and those are suddenly a problem, I don’t think a human,” Draco says realizing for the first time, he can’t really consider himself a human anymore, “will be any easier.”</p><p>Harry looks at Draco, “do you have,” he pauses for a moment looking for the right word, “urges?”</p><p>Draco rolls his eyes, leave it up to Potter to use a word like that, “I haven’t had a desire for human flesh if that’s what you’re asking.”</p><p>Harry’s cheeks pinken slightly, “Sorry,” he says quietly.</p><p>“I’ve been pretty good at keeping a schedule,” Draco says, “so I’m not exactly sure what ‘desire’ would be like.”</p><p>“Don’t you think you should know your limits?” Harry asks.</p><p>Draco watches Harry for another moment, before bringing the glass to his lips, letting the blood pass his lips, with minimal mess, before setting the glass back on the table.</p><p>“I think that I’m going to have to test everything at some point,” Draco says, “but I have a lot going on right now, and don’t think adding to that by being, ‘bloodthirsty’, for lack of a better word, is going to help solve any problems.”</p><p>Harry looks curiously at Draco as he speaks, “so it’s like being thirsty?” he asks.</p><p>Draco crosses his arms over his chest, “Did you come here to interrogate me about being a vampire?”</p><p>Harry feels himself visibly blush this time, “er-no,” he says, reaching into his cloak pocket pulling out a notepad, “Uh, have you ever heard of Winsworth’s Bridge?” Harry asks.</p><p>Draco had heard of Winsworth’s Bridge, it was an upscale wizarding establishment, that catered to the wealthier wizarding community, his parents had his sixteenth birthday party there, invited everyone they knew, and spent a lot of money on it.</p><p>“I’ve been there before,” Draco confirms, “Not in a few years though.”</p><p>“We have reason to believe that you may have gone there after leaving the pub,” he says looking at Draco.</p><p>Draco furrows his brows, trying to remember why he would have gone there, was he planning on meeting someone? Why would he choose to meet someone there? More importantly, why would he have wanted to go there?</p><p>“I don’t think I have any reason to have gone there,” Draco says after a moment of silence. He picks up his glass, taking a drink letting himself finish the contents of the glass.</p><p>Harry can’t help himself, he seems mesmerized by blood that stain’s Draco’s lips red and drips slowly down the side of his chin. Draco’s middle finger wipes at the blood that seemed to escape his mouth. Harry lets his eyes wander back to Draco’s lips, it’s only at that moment when he sees Draco’s lips begin to move, that he realizes Draco’s talking again.</p><p> </p><p>Harry clears his throat tearing his eyes away from Draco’s mouth, “I’m sorry, what was that?” he asks.</p><p>“I asked why you think I had reason to be there that night,” Draco says.</p><p>“Ah,” Harry murmurs, glancing back at his notepad, “Theodore Nott was at Winsworth’s Bridge that evening, and said he saw you outside.”</p><p>Draco frowns, “I haven’t spoken to Theodore since Hogwarts,” he says.</p><p>Harry makes a note of this, before looking back at Draco, “he never actually said you were inside, he doesn’t remember seeing you inside Winsworth’s, but as he was leaving just before midnight, he says he saw you crossing the street, it appeared you were leaving but that you were not alone.”</p><p>“Who was I with?” Draco asks.</p><p>“Not sure yet,” Harry says, watching Draco’s expression change.</p><p>“Do you think that was who attacked me?” Draco asks.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Harry says, “it’s possible, it’s also possible that they have nothing to do with your attack, but we should try to find out who you were with, we think that you were attacked around two, so this would have been maybe two hours before, this gives us a place to start.”</p><p>Draco nods, “Well I still can’t remember, and would have no idea why I would want to go to Winsworth’s.”</p><p>Harry looks back at Draco, “are you going to be in London for a while?”</p><p>Draco shrugs, “Probably, I’m going to look for my own place tomorrow, might as well stay in London.”</p><p>Harry looks at Draco, “It’s not so bad, living in London.”</p><p>“You’re living in London now?” Draco asks raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Harry nods, “I wasn’t going to go back to Surrey,” he says.</p><p>Draco can’t say he blamed Harry for that, he didn’t know much of anything about his life in Surrey, or his life at all if he really thought about it. He did know that when Harry left Surrey he didn’t seem to have a desire to go back.</p><p>“The last thing I want is to live in a tiny one bedroom flat, with horrible neighbors, with noisy children and barking animals,” Draco says rolling his eyes.</p><p>Harry can’t help but laugh, Draco had described his flat, minus the children. His neighbors had two dogs though, and they went at it all the time.</p><p>“Something funny Potter?” Draco scowls.</p><p>Harry smiles, “my neighbors have a dog.”</p><p>Draco grimaces, “too noisy.”</p><p>Harry smiles, “It’s not so bad, besides I’m sure there are plenty of penthouses in London for you to choose from.”</p><p>Draco rolls his eyes, “just because I have good taste.”</p><p>Harry shakes his head, leave it up to Draco to go there, “Well, I’ll leave you then, and maybe I’ll have something else to tell you tomorrow,” he says.</p><p>Draco nods, “Alright then,” he says watching Harry get up, and start walking toward the door before opening the door for Harry.</p><p>Harry steps outside, “Goodnight Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco watches Harry, “thanks for the lollie,” he says, and Harry can’t help but notice the curl at the corner of Draco’s mouth, it’s definitely a smile.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Harry smiles back at him.</p><p>“Goodnight Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco closes the door to his room, pouring the rest of the half-full blood bag into his glass. Draco stands eyeing the glass full of blood, and he starts to wonder about what Harry said, about knowing his limits. Draco picks up the glass, taking a long sip, fully aware of the blood that flows out of the side of his mouth. Draco sets his glass down, wiping at the sides of his mouth, it’s at that very moment he starts to feel sad. Sad for himself. His father was right, he was a vampire now, he was half a wizard now, he was a disgrace to his family name. His parents were right to send him away, he wanted to be away from them, he wanted to be away from everyone. Draco looks down at the blood in the glass, picking it up before finishing the last of its contents.</p><p>Draco doesn’t bother cleaning himself up, he decided he’d take a shower, and just wash it off in there. Draco walks into the ensuite turning the light on, walking to the walk-in shower, turning it on. It’s this moment that Draco really sees himself. He’d been avoiding mirrors since he got out of the hospital, but he didn’t want to avoid the mirror anymore.  Draco stands in front of the mirror, he had two black eyes, his cheeks were sunken, and bruised, the bruises yellowing on his pale skin.</p><p>One button at a time, Draco starts to undress taking off his shirt, opening his shirt Draco saw the bruises, yellow, red, grey, blue, that covered his body. Draco was one who loved his body, and to see it in this state upset him, and angered him. Someone had done this to him, made him look like this. Draco drops the shirt to the floor, before his eyes wander down his torso his flat abdomen, bruised. Draco unbuttons his trousers pulling the zipper down, letting his trousers pool at his feet. Giant, dark, bruises covered Draco’s legs, and Draco suddenly wished he had never looked in the mirror. He hated everything he saw.</p><p>Standing in front of the mirror, Draco traces the bruises over his chest and arms, letting his fingers trail over the bruises on his stomach, and down his thighs. Draco closes his eyes a minute later, pulling his pants down, leaving them on the floor before stepping into the shower. Draco stands under the water spray, letting the water run through his hair and down his body.</p><p>Draco’s first proper shower in what must have been a week. He had a quick shower last night when he got home, but he was so upset about everything with his parents, he just wanted to be out of there. In this hotel room, under the spray of the water, he was starting to feel like his old self. The Draco that he knew.</p><p>Draco spends well over an hour in the shower, and he has absolutely no shame over that. When his body is clean, and his hair smells like vanilla and lilac, he finally smiles to himself. Draco dresses in a pair of his pajamas, silver silk. Draco crawls into the bed the sun wasn’t up yet, but he knew it was late, and he was actually tired. He slips underneath the sheets and sighs heavily before closing his eyes, allowing himself to sleep.</p>
