    <p><strong>I know what you are doing, and why, Severus. </strong><br/>
<strong>I know You betrayed Dark Lord for HER. I'm not angry, I knew that eventually, <strike>you would choose her over me</strike>. it would happen.</strong><br/>
<strong>I'm about to do something really brave or really stupid... <strike>Or both</strike>.</strong><br/>
<strong>Please, no matter what happens to me, </strong><br/>
<strong>Remember <strike>the young</strike> me...</strong><br/>
<strong>Forever yours,</strong><br/>
<strong>R.A.B.</strong><br/>

<em>The letter Severus received was intended to be </em>longer<em>, but much of the ink was crossed out an ineligible. He hadn't received the letter until after Regulus was declared dead. Snape did not cry, it hurt, but he was used to it. After Lily... It hurt more than taking the Dark Mark.</em><br/>
<br/>
Regulus Arcturus Black, officially dead heir of the Most Ancient and Noble House Black. Had enough of Horcruxes and such after nearly dying when attempting to retrieve one and he had a funny feeling that nothing he was capable of doing could destroy the thing and that it most likely wasn't the only one. Feigning his own death and moving into a muggle flat sounded like a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, he wasn't living under this name, he wasn't stupid. Months before faking his own death he created an alias in Gringotts and was moving money to the account of Edward Green, an eccentric wizard who didn't like company all that much.<br/>
<br/>
And like this, just two weeks after his supposed death Edward Green moved into the number five with a jacket that could hold more than his Gringotts' vault and a suitcase packed in case he ever had to run away and next to no knowledge how muggle world works.<br/>
<br/>
The Dursley's were perfect neighbours. They were the last people you would suspect of taking part in something weird or mysterious, they just didn't believe such nonsense. No one would look for him there and a number of protective charms he cast on the whole street certainly helped security but not his paranoia.<br/>
<br/>
For the first week, he had serious trouble sleeping which warranted for a trip to Diagon Alley to get ingredients for a sleeping draught, which he never made. Elixir induced sleep might be a bad idea when on a run... Instead, he made a habit of never leaving his wand alone. Once he almost hexed Vernon Dursley when he came to complain about light being on in Regulus' home all night. After this he decided to invest in company Mr Dursley was working at, it got him some Neighbour Points back after growling 'what?" at his neighbour.</p>
