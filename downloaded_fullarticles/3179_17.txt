    <p align="center"><em>"The first brother traveled to a distant village while with the Elder Wand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him, he bragged of his invincibility. But that night, another wizard stole the wand and slit the brother’s throat for good measure. And so Death took the first brother for his own."</em> </p><p align="center">- The Tale of the Three Brothers</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>By the time he has reached his private compartment aboard the Hogwarts Express, the sliding door slid with a chilling hiss of finality. The hidden lock mechanism clicked and bit down, cutting him off from the rowdy and frenetic activity beyond the station. The dense glass of the windows insulated his solitude and cocooned him in a sense of warm isolation. In this little den, he was king and in control of his own affairs. In this little den of his own, he can take the time to allow his defenses to relax, even for just a little while, before he spends another school year away from the Lightwood Estates. Away from it all, away from the natural hellhole that his life has spiralled devolved to. The black hole that revealed itself to be seating at the heart of their family affairs, tarnishing the reputation of their pure-blood family.</p><p>Pure-blood supremacy and its innocent victims. Blood politics. The Circle, Valentine Morgenstern, and his parents' role in the bloody details of the Uprising. The thing that started it all. The thing that would naturally come back to haunt him when he will arrive on Hogwarts, a new school year changed for the worst. He could already predict the exact glint in their eyes when they would see him, the cold and cruel glint that only ever appears in the gaze of another human, when its appetite for avenging some deep-felt injustice overwhelms the shackles and chains on its primal nature.</p><p>Rumors have already abounded that a dark lord is surfacing, coming to haunt and chase down every last muggleborn. Over the past few weeks, a slew of Muggleborn killings had been reported all over wizarding society. The Ministry of Magic and MACUSA have gone on to high alert and have decided to join arms in their war against the beginnings of what could be the Third War. It was in a somber family dinner when the Lightwood patriarch fell over and collapsed on the ground, a heaving and writhing mass of agony. The Black Mark on his father's inner forearm, the Mark of the Circle, resurfaced with a vengeance. The skin at the edges of the Black Mark shimmered and blackened, as if the nerves suddenly perished at the strong presence of scorching magic. Not long after, his mother followed suit and it was an evening of agonizing revelations and shattered relationships.</p><p>It was a call to arms. There was no other way to mistake it. The Dark Lord has returned. And with it, the knowledge of the Lightwood family's involvement has come to light in the eyes of the public.</p><p>There would be no safe place, not even for him, in the Slytherin dungeons. For an entire year, his family would be at risk of being preyed on, ocstracised, exempted from every rule. As much as he would like to give credit to their own capacity to stand on their own two feet, as a big brother, as the eldest, he always knows that it can have the chance to go wrong. <em>Terribly</em> wrong. He won't be there all the time to protect them, watch over them. Even then, he can't even guarantee them the comfort of his presence as the bloodthirsty crowds will start playing all sorts of psychological warfare, cursing them and hexing them. Oh, he can and will bloody try to protect them and fend them off. What he can't do is protect them from the words that would inevitably sear and scar their psychological wellbeings. He <em>hates</em> not being able to do anything. Anything at all, to protect them.</p><p>Lightwoods may break noses and accept the damn consequences, but honestly, it is not a precursor that warrants impulsive actions and behaviors that can be thrown about on a whim. There comes a time and a crucial point where bravery is virtually indistinguishable from stupidity.</p><p>He numbly reminisces on the time when he foolishly wrote back in the first week after he was Sorted. Naively expecting some form of validation from his prim and proper parents, nothing could have prepared his younger self for the crushing blow of the austere response that came his way when Percival, his own tawny owl, came back with the letter as he was doing his homework in the Great Hall.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Dear Alexander,</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Thank you for the letter. We are very pleased to hear that you have settled in well at your first week in Hogwarts. Congratulations as well for being sorted into your House. While it was a hope of ours for you to have followed in the tradition of our Lightwood ancestors of having the honor of walking under the watchful eyes of Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, we also understand that the Sorting Hat often has a mind of its own as it takes into consideration the unique traits and backgrounds of the students it encounters.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Your father and I are currently in Idris, attending to family affairs that will have the potential to affect our Noble family's path in the future. At this point in time, my son, I am not able to divulge the nature of this business to you or your siblings. Please send our warm regards to Jace and Isabelle. All three of you are dearly missed and the family home is quite lonely and empty without your presences.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>We hope to see you back for the winter holidays.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Sincerely yours,</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Father and Mother</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Distant and detached, austere and mechanical, like all the other years of his life. Years of being raised and groomed to be the next head of the Lightwood lineage, to eventually take his place beside his father's seat in the Wizengamot, and a slew of other unspoken expectations designed with the end goal of increasing their family's reputation and honor amongst wizardkind and witchkind. All along, he was just a tool used to erase the bloody history of his parents' actions. He sometimes wondered if the term of 'blood traitor' would be an adequate title for them, seeing as it was from their own actions that their family name has descended into such a mess.</p><p>
  <em>"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see, and not a bad mind either. Fiercely loyal and protective of those you love, yes, indeed. You remind me of someone else, oh yes, quite similar the both of you are. There's talent and an enormous thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?"</em>
</p><p>Alec opens his eyes and diverts his gaze to the evergreen scenery whisking past his windows. In retrospect, the decision was quite obvious. Slytherin chose him and welcomed him with open arms, and the violent round of applause that reached his ears as he sauntered over to the tables were just as prominent as it is now, even if it was submerged beneath layers of memories. Much to the utter dismay of his sister, and eventually later, to his younger brother, there was never a good memory he ever had in Hogwarts that didn't once involve some type of relation in the house of serpents. For the fearsome reputation that it unfairly gained as being the spawn bed of dark wizards, it sometimes continues to surprise him when his own fellow Slytherins were much less likely to snitch on the other snake, for whatever reason or motivation it was. Many of them were surprisingly pleasant and open-minded folk. Perhaps a little reserved on the get go, but once a snake opens up to you, it wasn't long before word goes around.</p><p>But, as it was always destined to be, Lightwoods always wound up having to accept the consequences of their actions sooner or later. The friendships he has built, the unshakeable camaraderie and trust amongst his friends, Slytherin or not, will soon be lost to the rain and storm that would undoubtedly follow him when the chilling news reaches Hogwarts. The only home he has ever known.</p><p>
  <em>"Muggleborn killer!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Death Eater!"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Go back to Azkaban!"</em>
</p><p>The jeers would soon follow him. His sister. His brothers. And he can't do much in the way of protecting them, because he will be first man bloodied the moment he sets foot on the castle grounds. After all, the wizarding world still hasn't completely healed from the aftermath of the Second War. It was always like that, wasn't it? History repeating itself. The names and faces change, but it always remained the same. Dark Lords rise and fall. Just like people like him.</p><p>It never ends.</p><p>Ollivander was a madman, a downright madman. He was, indeed, a pure and utter madman when he was still that naive Lightwood heir that first walked into his shop, starry-eyed and carried away as he eagerly awaited the fateful moment where he met his equal match in a wand. A life partner, that would evolve and adapt with him. Another step, another chance to prove himself worthy in the eyes of his parents.</p><p>A foolish aspiration, he bitterly learned later on, years down the road.</p><p>
  <em>"Such a unique combination. Phoenix feather core and this type of wand wood."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Excuse me, sir?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I remembered every wand that I have ever sold, Mr. Lightwood. It is always curious to see how these things choose the masters that they do," Ollivander smiles softly, his aged eyes twinkling with the luminous insight of a moon. "And yet in all my years of living, I never would have thought to have been fortunate enough to see such a momentous occasion."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I'm sorry, sir, but what's curious?" he scowled, eyebrows raised to his hairlines."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Mr. Lightwood, apparently, it seems that you have found your ideal match in Elder," the wandmaker replies, his moon-like eyes fixed on him like a feline eyeing an opposum. "In all my years of study and dedication to my craft, it is only the truth that I speak of this. The truth is that only a highly unusual person will find their perfect match in elder, and on the rare occasion when such a pairing occurs, I take it as certain that the witch or wizard in question is marked out for a special destiny."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Elder? But - why? Why not --"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Why not be chosen by any other? Indeed the question, is it not? The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Lightwood. It is not always clear why. One thing is certain, however. I think we can expect many great things from you, Mr. Lightwood. Above all, I know it for certain that a wand of elder never chooses a wizard or witch for its partner if there was anything mundane about them."</em>
</p><p>It was if Sir Ollivander himself forgot the tale of the Three Brothers.</p><p>Alec grits his teeth, fighting the lump of despair that coils around his stomach like a pit of restless snakes. The part of himself that always remained traitorously uncertain of anything in his life, cowers as an ancient proverb echoes at the back of his mind.</p><p>
  <em>"Wand of elder, never prosper."</em>
</p><p>It was an omen as old as the Tale of the Three Brothers.</p><p>The chilling echo of brisk knocks on his compartment door wrenches him out of the tumultuous currents of his thoughts. A sharp scowl broke out over his eyebrows, before practised maneuvering allows him to wrestle back control of his composure. He takes in a sharp breath and glares pointedly at the source of the disturbance. His breath hitched in his lungs, his pharynx constricting slightly. The locking mechanism of his only line of defense, hisses and the sliding door of his compartment crawls to the side. A shock of styled raven hair peeks cheekily through the generous opening, dark chestnut irises glinting with some emotion he couldn't identify.</p><p>An asymmetrical smile appeared, two-parts sheepish and one-part curious. "Do you mind if I take a spot? Everywhere else is full, I'm afraid."</p><p>Alec exhaled roughly, and he swallows a few times to rid himself of the sudden parchness that crawls its way down his gut. He breaks his gaze momentarily with the man, gazing pointedly at the spare seat in front of him. He flickers his gaze back to the man, who is now clearly regarding him a raised brow. "Not at all," he replies stiffly, mouth set in grim lines as he feels his face turning to stone.</p><p>"Thank you," the man drops him a smile, the kind of smile that really reaches the eyes. He watches in detached fascination as the lines around the man's eyes crinkled and appeared in abundance, a marker of genuine relief.</p><p>As the other man took his merry time to settle in comfortably into his seat, Alec shifts his gaze and allows himself to detach from the present moment, eyes lazily watching the sloping laziness of the foothills and roaming evergreen trees whistling past the window. The onslaught of the rain drops continue pattering down on the glass, the droplets helpless to fall in with the allure of the gravitational force exerted on them. The tracks they made were impressive cubic lattices that were drawn into the window.</p><p>His mind naturally went back to mulling over his current dilemma for the year. Even if his family's name might be tarnished, he can probably still find a way to salvage his old connections and make certain that they would all be able to get themselves a foot in the door wherever they desire.</p><p>"I'm Magnus Bane, by the way. I don't believe we've met."</p><p>He removes his gaze from the window and stares unflinchingly into the eyes of the other man. Bare and direct, the other male had quite the captivating energy that seemed to be held in reserve behind his eyes. This man seemed to be the type that found it easy to smile, perhaps even find a kind word for anyone he comes across. Alec often prided himself in the way he could read people, but the man before him seemed shrouded in an impenetrable layer of unpredictability, as if his initial reactions were liable to change depending on the circumstances. His instincts hissed and snarled at him to be constantly vigilant of the presence in front of him.</p><p>"Alec," he returned bluntly. An undesirable itch tackles his hands, and he suddenly finds himself wanting to be occupied with something else.</p><p>"Alec?" the other man raises his eyebrows, a corner of his lips twitching upwards. "Just Alec?"</p><p>His jaw muscle tightened as he fought down the strange scorching wave of heat that warmed his gut. It took every grain of his being to collect that austere posturing that was passed down to him through generations of Lightwoods, and he drew on nearly endless willpower to allow that cutting austerity and reserve to bleed into his being.</p><p>Bane was not a pureblood family that had any roots or history in Britain, that much for he already knew that the man before him was quite evidently American, obvious in the accent and painfully more blatant in the manner of his clothing and by the air he carried himself with. There was an underlying sense of grace and elegance that characterized the man's disposition, a sense of easiness with himself and his relation to the entire world. An ease and boldness that will never be found in the ranks of the stifling broods in pureblood ranks.</p><p>A transfer, perhaps?</p><p>"Bane is not a pureblood family," Alec suddenly states.</p><p>The man seated opposite of him, suddenly stiffened at the nature of his remark. A part of Alec suddenly winces at the sheer lack of tact that he just displayed. He cursed inwardly to himself. Not even stepping foot in Hogwarts and he most likely already laid the foundations for his demise.</p><p>A defensive energy envelopes the aura around him, and a strained smile appears on the man's face, the type of smile that does not quite reach his eyes. "Very astute observation. Is that a problem?"</p><p>His gut sank when the defensiveness reeked through the words. The air in the compartment shivered and thickened into layers of brittle ice. Flinching slightly at his own impulsive tactlessness, Alec breaks his gaze and looks away beyond the window.</p><p>"No," he says, a sad muted volume that doesn't quite manage to conceal his apologetic undertone.</p><p>A dense layer of numbing silence saturates their private space on the train, permeating the room and consuming the vacuum of space. The black ice in his core creeps on the walls of his chest and morphs into a heavy block that compresses his lungs from all sides. The sinking weight on his chest feels comparable to having Mjolnir pinned to place above his sternum, a trap that takes away his freedom to move and escape. The weight on his chest compels him to release a rough exhale, exchanging what little air he has for more of the noxious substance permeating the air.</p><p><em>'I'm not like them. I'm not like them. I never wanted any of this,'</em> was what he wanted to say.</p><p>The man seated opposite of him clears his throat unabashedly, prompting Alec to involuntarily tear his eyes away from the bleak partial reflections created on the window. There was something inherently different in those chestnut irises, a kind of glint that he might uncomfortably attribute to something called 'sympathetic understanding'. That old instinct of concealing emotional vulnerabilities, nudges his mind once again, and he reluctantly draws more strength from that part of himself. The man gives him another smile, small but kind, and this time, Alec knows that it was a genuine gesture of acceptance and forgiveness. He makes it a point to acknowledge their wordless exchange with a curt nod, before old instincts take over. Before he even knows it, he once again tears away his gaze and bitterly resorts to observing the sloping laziness of the evergreen scenery beyond his window.</p><p>"So, what House do you belong to, Alexander?"</p><p>A startled scowl appears on his face and he tears his attention away from the numb reverie he slipped into. The American muggleborn tilts his head, a slight quirking of his lips that gives him an air of tantalizing mystique and feline playfulness. He was immediately reminded of a Wampus that slinked along the lines of the shadows, amber eyes glimmering with the rumored gifts of hypnosis and Legilimency, an elegant and graceful creature who never felt the need to expend more energy than necessary to reach its goals. The Muggleborn in front of him was surrounded by an air of perpetual amusement, but underneath the facade, seemed to be a layer of stark empathy that gave him a frightening level of insight into the emotional affairs of the one he converses with.</p><p>Despite this flash of realization, Alec wasn't quite certain on what to make of his new acquaintance. Being called Alexander was definitely not the top of the list of things that he would have expected today. Regardless, this turn of events wasn't exactly unpleasant or even unwelcome. Still, he was hesitant to shift the power dynamics of their conversation in the man's favor. In the span of fifteen minutes, the man in front of him is the only other human that has come closest to indirectly unraveling the heart of his current problems, even with scant few words exchanged between them. He knows close to nothing about the man, and yet the man in front of him seemed to have known more about him than he ever intended to reveal.</p><p>"My name is not Alexander," Alec states curtly, strategically sidesteping the original question, rebuffing it with another blunt remark that wasn't really unfounded. The prickling sensation running down his back was just another physical symptom of his rising wariness.</p><p>"Are you sure about that?" an infuriating playfulness bleeds into his smile, infusing it with a feline quality that Alec instantly comes to dislike.</p><p>Merlin, what was this man playing at?</p><p>"Yes, I'm quite sure of that," he retorts calmly, unflinchingly glaring.</p><p>"You still haven't answered my question. What House are you in? Given your age, I highly doubt you are a first year," the American smirks. "I've heard a little about your Sorting system and how it works. I'm from Ilvermony myself, but of course, it never hurts to get an insider opinion."</p><p>
  <em>I'll give you one piece of information about me, in return for something from you.</em>
</p><p>Merlin's beard, this man was a bloody presumptious prat. It was as if he expects to be readily given what he has so boldly asked for!</p><p>"Slytherin," he drawls, deliberately dragging out the words. "I'm a Slytherin."</p><p>His dark eyebrows were raised to the edge of his hairline. "Slytherin? Interesting. House of the ambitious, the shrewd, and the cunning?" the man smiles, his eyes glinting with deeply reserved mischief. "What a surprise. Do you have any siblings that are in the same House?"</p><p>Alec grits his teeth, drawing on his endless willpower to keep his breathing steady and his head in a level-headed manner. "No."</p><p>The man tilts his head again, eyeing him with the morbid interest that was eerily reminiscent of a natural philosopher. "No siblings? Or, they are in different Houses?"</p><p>"I'm the only one in Slytherin," he replies with an air of feigned nonchalance, shifting his eyes away from the other's in a blatant show of dismissal.</p><p>"Tell me, Alexander," the American Muggleborn continues pressing. The subtle sharpness that creeps into the words piques his interest, and Alec slowly turns his gaze from the window to meet the challenging tone that is starting to bleed through their conversation. "Why are you trying so hard to push me away?"</p><p>
  <em>Because I don't trust you. I can't trust you. I can't trust anybody else.</em>
</p><p>Trust has been the currency that he has been lacking as of late. It has dropped in value and whatever remaining principal balance he has was already abused by his estranged parents. He was just waiting for everyone else that he has called a friend, to start walking away as soon as he reaches Hogwarts. So, Alec knows that he can be forgiven for the lack of warmth and gregariousness.</p><p>Alec clenches his jaw, the tired tension bleeding into the muscles between his shoulders. He exhales roughly, pinning the muggleborn with a glare that he desperately hopes doesn't communicate the magnitude of his exhaustion. "Hasn't it ever occurred to you that maybe I just don't <em>wan't</em> to talk?"</p><p>"It doesn't hurt to talk from time to time, Alexander. Or, make new friends."</p><p>"I don't think <em>you</em> know what it is you're precisely walking into, Mr. Bane," Alec intones icily. "Do you even know who I am? Because if you did, then I know for a fact that the last person you want to have everyone know that you associated with is me."</p><p>"Is it because you're a Lightwood? Is that what you meant?" the man arched an eyebrow, head tilted at an angle. "In case you didn't already know, I got that much from you since I walked in to your compartment."</p><p>A bitter sound escaped his lips before he could fully suppress it. "What gave it away?"</p><p>"Call it a hunch, if you will," he smiles softly, a curious glint creping into his eyes.</p><p>Why wasn't this man leaving already?</p><p>The wounded basilisk in his chest stirs from a troubled slumber and starts creeping out from its lair, unfurling everything he has suppressed in the last few months. Cold and defensive anger courses through his bloodstream, flooding it with bitter resentment that burns hotly underneath his skin. Alec was growing intimately familiar with this type of anger that it is sometimes frightening him how it often starts to come out.</p><p>He swallows back the bitterness. "Then you already what we are."</p><p>"It wasn't by your hand that these people died, Alexander. If you were afraid that I would pass on judgment to someone who clearly has had nothing to do with any of this, then you are sorely mistaken," he replies softly. "You are not to be judged by the transgressions of others. You never asked for this."</p><p>Merlin's beard, what is it with this man and his frightening tendency to continuously pull more emotional confessions and highly personal information from him, with hardly any effort at all on his part? Above all, why is it this man, in particular, making it so <em>easy</em> to share his private thoughts on these matters? As if they were merely like old friends sitting together on a lonesome bench in a park, so comfortable with freely exchanging the most intimate details of themselves with nary a fear of having that information filed away and used as blackmail for personal ends.</p><p>Why is this man making him <em>want</em> to? Why is this man making it so hard for him to be distant?</p><p>He has to stop. He has to distance himself immediately and detach himself from this man's presence and siren-like charisma, whatever form his means may take. For Merlin's sake, he is a Lightwood and he <em>will</em> conduct himself in a manner befitting his family name. He <em>will</em> become a respectable figure in wizarding society. He <em>will</em> restore the Lightwood family's name and reputation. He <em>will</em> succeed and survive in Hogwarts, because he still loves his family and his younger siblings. He owes them to survive this, this form of hell that will inevitably hunt them down in Hogwarts. He <em>must</em> succeed, because he can't bear to entertain the thought of what could happen to them if he failed.</p><p>A fierce knocking on the compartment door startles him out of his somber reverie.</p><p>He accidentally exchanges glances with the American muggleborn in front of him, as he abruptly raises his head from a bowed position. The Slytherin instantly comes to regret his action when a spark of determination ignites to life behind those chestnut irises, effectively signalling the fact that their conversation is far from being finished. By virtue of Lightwood stubbornness, Alec hardens his gaze to the sharpness of flint and pins him with an arctic glare.</p><p>The muggleborn frowns. "Alexander --"</p><p>"I suggest you drop it, Bane. There's nothing else to talk about."</p><p>The wooden compartment door slides noisily to the side. Fringes of platinum blonde hair explodes into his view, a hint of evergreen displayed from the hood of the black robes worn around the person's broad frame. "Alec? Did you hear --"</p><p>The enthusiastic tangent abruptly cuts off, the Slytherin in question scowling at the American muggleborn seated opposite of him. Sharp eyes dart back and forth between them both, before his fellow Slytherin pins him with a questioning glance, grey eyes gleaming with curiosity.</p><p>His fellow Slytherin clears his throat, making no effort to conceal his bemused expression. "Pardon me, but, am I interrupting something?"</p><p>"Well -"</p><p>"<em>No</em>, of course not," Alec cuts in abruptly, deliberately keeping his gaze fixed on his friend in order to avoid the frustrated glance being sent his way. "What was it that you wanted to tell me?"</p><p>A characteristic glint appears in those grey irises, a kind of shrewd realization. Alec feels a sudden sense of apprehension and wariness clawing his gut. "It's really not that urgent, mate. We can talk more about it when we're back in the Common Room. It's just regular old housekeeping stuff. For the rest of the year, things like that," a shrewd grin breaks across his face. "Would you care to introduce your friend, Alec? Or are you going to let that Lightwood charm slide down the drain?"</p><p>"Lightwood charm?" the American raises an eyebrow, an amused quirk of his lips breaking through his dangerously expressive face.</p><p>"The name's Alphard Malfoy," his fellow Slytherin practically <em>purred</em> at the seated American, his gaze intensifying by the second. The seventh-year Slytherin tilts his head and makes no effort at hiding the appraising glance he sweeps over the man's figure. "I'm terribly sorry about my best mate over here. It's a bit of an ongoing issue, really. He doesn't really know how to talk to people. Lightwoods have always been the reserved sort, tragic as it is."</p><p>"I'm managing fine, but thanks for your concern," Bane smiles politely, despite the occasional twitch of amusement that breaks through his face. "And Magnus Bane is the name. But everyone calls me Magnus."</p><p>"Right, and I take it your man over here insists on calling you by your surname?" Malfoy grins, the traitor. "Tsk. We must work on your social skills, Lightwood. At this point, you're never gonna get laid."</p><p>Alec draws in a breath, and exhales slowly through his nose. He cranes his neck and pins his fellow Slytherin with a scalding gaze strong enough to skin the pelt of the a fully grown Nundu. "Get out, Malfoy."</p><p>A part of him recoils in horror when Bane suddenly develops a shrewd demeanor.</p><p>The bastard grins even more. "Don't think so, Alec. Can't escape --"</p><p>Alec scowls, raising an arm abruptly and flicking his hand in a curt gesture along the compartment door. The door grumbles as it engages with the lock mechanism, effectively barring them from the outside world. The Slytherin balefully eyes Alphard Malfoy, who was still standing outside of their compartment with a triumphant grin. In response, Alec simply hardens his resolve and continues his glaring fit. After Malfoy shakes his head, he walks away from the conpartment, disappearing further down the narrow hall. With another sharp exhale, Alec shakes his head at his friend's antics, ignoring the slight burst of warmth proliferating in his chest. Perhaps he still had friends in Slytherin. Was it really too much to ask for him to keep that?</p><p>"You can do wandless magic?" Bane says softly, as if he was out of breath.</p><p>
  <em>'Damn it. Why do I keep slipping up? Merlin, why does he make it easy for me to make elementary mistakes like this?'</em>
</p><p>"It's not common knowledge, and I would like to keep it that way," Alec intones, making no effort to hide the implicit threat beneath his words.</p><p>A conflicted expression appears on the man's face, a cross between frustration and hurt. "Of course. What did you take me for? Mercy Lewis, I don't kiss and tell, Alexander," Bane was quick to retort, the sharp edge from earlier returning with a defensive eagerness.</p><p>He has to drive this man away from him. He can't risk it. He can't afford to risk everything he has ever built for himself, and the plans that he has moving forward. Now that the other man was pitted on the defensive, Alec can switch his tactics and go for the offensive. Fluster and confuse. Divide and conquer. He has to make it clear.</p><p>"Before this train gets to Hogwarts, let me make something clear," he starts in a soft voice, hardening himself mentally when the American muggleborn in front of him suddenly stiffens at the change in tone. "I'm not your friend. And I don't plan on changing that anytime soon. I don't care that you want an ally in me. The Lightwoods are not your allies or friends. Frankly, I don't even know what was going through your head when you chose to walk through that door. By your own confession, you already knew who I was before you even walked through that door. I have reasons not to trust you. So, do yourself a favor. <em>Stay out of my way.</em> Before you get hurt. Because Hogwarts is not Ilvermony. And if you get yourself caught up with the wrong crowd, you will regret it."</p><p>The American's chestnut eyes darkened, reminiscent of a warm hearth starting to ignite back to heightened ferocity after a period of dormancy. "Is that a threat? Or a warning? What a pity I can't tell the difference," a lethal smile distorts the man's ethereal face, a feigned gesture of civility that hints at the serpent underneath.</p><p>
  <em>Wand of elder, never prosper.</em>
</p><p>The ancient saying reverberates across the walls of his mind once again.</p><p>"Take care not to wander to the serpent's pit," he calmly retorts. Alec rises to his full height and looks down on the American muggleborn, taking great effort to keep his face stonily blank of any emotion that might betray his internal conflict. "It bites back."</p><p>An involuntary shiver runs down his spine when a flicker of cold determination emerges briefly from the sea of storms behind the man's gaze, before sinking back down to the twilight depths. "You can't make me do anything."</p><p>A painful pang of melancholy slices across his chest. Alec fights down the agonizing despair that eviscerates his chest like a storm of serrated daggers. Years of austere control and willpower gave him what little resolve he had left to retain his dignity. It cuts him straight through the core of what he is and what he stands for, because once he says these words, he can't and won't be able to take back the hurt and damage that he will irrevocably cause.</p><p>It was a pity however. Alec knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that if things turned out differently, Magnus Bane would have been one of the most genuine and loyal relationships he would've ever had the privilege of knowing. It pains him, greatly so, that he lost another friend because of the Lightwood history with pureblood supremacy. In another time, in another life, he would have chosen differently.</p><p>
  <em>Wand of elder, never prosper.</em>
</p><p>It was an omen from his younger, naive years. The carriers of wands made of elder wood, were confined to lonely destinies, Alec realized. Lonely destinies that might end in a violent death for the wand carrier. If the Sorting hat made a different decision to sort him to a different House, he would be laughing at the irony of it all if his alternate self were to face the same situation, considering what he was planning to do with the remainder of his years. Moving forward, Alec only has one burning ambition achieve. The one and only ambition of his short life.</p><p>Protect his family, restore their honor, and kill the Dark Lord.</p><p>"Yes, I can, <em>mudblood</em>."</p><p>An icy chill engulfs his senses and envelopes his heart, and the arctic waters of his tortured emotions submerges his head under the water, flooding his ears with a screeching noise. The tumultuous storm of magic hidden away beneath layers of iron control, hissed to life and screeched like an enraged basilisk, invisible tendrils lashing out around the isolated compartment. A small chink appears on the window to his right, the crevice slowly growing until the crack in the glass mimics the appearance of thunder. A vicious force latches on to Magnus' clothes, fishing him out of his seat with a violence that astonishes him. Alec's tortured magic pushes the man against the walls of the compartment, invisible claws keeping him in place.</p><p>Chestnut eyes were widened precariously, the shorter man's breaths coming in shallow series of gasps and fearful wheezing. His tortured magical core winds around the American's chest, giving it a painful and warning squeeze. Alec honors the man's plight by looking at him straight in the eye, allowing himself to completely acknowledge and absorb the agonizing betrayal and tortured realization he sees in those captivating depths. After a few more moments, Alec feels a vicious pride flowing through him when Magnus hardens his gaze and the lethal determination returning in his eyes. Despite his threatening position, an ominous shiver slithers down his spine when that very same determination bleeds into the man's face.</p><p>A glassy stare meets his gaze. "You know, your siblings would be so disappointed in you, Alexander. Oh, yes, I had the pleasure of meeting them."</p><p>His heart clenches painfully at those words. Alec brutally smashes the shaky exhale that almost escaped his lungs.</p><p>Magnus pulls his mouth in an asymmetrical smile, eyes glistening with unshed tears, a shadow of sadness and resignation bleeding into his expressive face. "They were so nice. So <em>kind</em>. They couldn't stop talking about the big brother that <em>loved</em> them so much. That <em>cared</em> for them so much. The big brother that would always take the blame for their misadventures, if it meant sparing them from the punishment that might follow. Back then, I thought, how can a person like that be a Slytherin? How, I asked."</p><p>"And so, I decided to keep my initial conclusions to myself and come see for myself the character of this man they were so fond of talking about," he continues smiling sadly. "Suffice to say, they will be disappointed."</p><p>Alec hardens his resolve, even if the cracks on his hold and composure were rapidly decaying into the ether. "Then they didn't really know me as well as they thought they did."</p><p>The sad smile disappears. A pained edge starts taking over the American muggleborn's face. "Your siblings would be disappointed in you, Alexander. No, not because you decided to call me a mudblood," a shaky chuckle escapes his lips. "Oh. Never that. No. I know your character, Alexander, even if we might not have known each other for long. There is no point in lying to us both. I can see, even from here, that the very act of saying them killed a vital part of you. It killed a part of you, because it goes against every grain of who you stand for. No, they would be disappointed in you because you are about to embark on something dangerous. Something dangerous that can potentially take your life, and you didn't trust them enough to confide in them."</p><p>The electrical activity of his heart freezes for one halting second. "You know nothing of what I am."</p><p>"Don't be a fool, Alexander. You've already revealed too much. It's too late to hide them behind lies and subterfuge," Magnus smiles sadly. "I may not know the details, but it doesn't matter. You are not a pureblood elitist, Alexander, and nothing you will ever do will convince me. Taking on their skin and attitudes will not help you in your quest."</p><p>
  <em>Wand of elder, never prosper.</em>
</p><p>An icy block of fear bleeds into his chest, hardening to a formidable iceberg that drags him down. His tortured magic retaliates against the environment and abruptly relinquishes its hold on Magnus, the invisible tendrils coiling back around him in protection. When the ringing in his ears subsides, Alec becomes painfully aware of the labored breaths assaulting his lungs. The last of his strength withers away and he stumbles back a few steps. Magnus clumsily falls to the cushioned seat with a pained grunt, wincing as he gingerly rubs his sore ribs.</p><p>His throat clicks as he swallows down the lump in his throat. The edge of his cushioned seat presses painfully against the back of his calves. His carotid artery gallops at the frantic pace of a stallion escaping a captor. His lungs convulsed and thrashed as more oxygen leaves his body. Alec stares at the spot above Magnus' head, his body locked in a rigid state of stubborn immobilization, his limp hands seized by violent tremors.</p><p>In the name of Salazar, what was he <em>doing</em>? What the bloody hell was he thinking? What in Merlin's name <em>was he thinking</em>?</p><p>They will hear about this.</p><p>They <em>will</em> hear about this. Everyone at Hogwarts, in Slytherin, will hear about how Alec Lightwood, heir to the Lightwood lordship, lost his control and assaulted a fellow student. A <em>Muggleborn</em> transfer student from Ilvermony. Physically and verbally assaulted a <em>Muggleborn</em> student. Word of his deed will spread. And like the emotionally compromised fool he was, his siblings would no doubt be dragged into the bloody mess he just created. All because he couldn't control himself around <em>one</em> man. And of his friends in Slytherin, he will be eaten alive in the serpent's pit for setting them back years of progress in fighting the House prejudice they have always faced from the other Houses and professors.</p><p><em>Death Eater</em>.</p><p><em>Pureblood elitist</em>.</p><p>
  <em>Muggleborn killer.</em>
</p><p>"Alexander?"</p><p>He needs to leave.</p><p>He needs to <em>leave.</em></p><p>He needs to leave!</p><p>"Alexander!"</p><p>Alec startles out of his reverie. His eyes widened a fraction and fixes itself on the wide-eyed face of the man in front of him. The Ilvermony student slowly detaches the arm wrapped around his abdomen. Alec instantly darts his attention to the arm that was slowly reaching out to him. His nostrils flared and his mouth hangs agape as he tries to recover the oxygen debt accrued by his body.</p><p>"Alexander," the man says softly, slowly, as if he was a wild animal cornered into a last stand. "Hey. It's okay. I'm okay. Alexander. I'm fine."</p><p>He needs to leave.</p><p>Alec flinches backwards violently when the hand reaching out to him almost touches his tremoring hands. An ominous thud echoes around the compartment as he clumsily lands against the door of the compartment. Magnus jerks back in unfiltered surprise, his arm falling limply to his side. The muggleborn's eyes widened in horrified realization and that dangerous edge of determination returns, a resolve that would no doubt result in Alec's expulsion from Hogwarts.</p><p>The man swallows, his brows knitted together in furious concentration. It seemed to take everything he had to stay seated, as if he was reluctant to do anything else that might send Alec apparating to the Himalayas. "Alexander, listen to me carefully. I'm <em>not</em> going to hurt you."</p><p>That's what they would say.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>"Alexander," the man pleads, his voice breaking with desperation. "I'm not going to tell anyone. I promise. <em>Alexander</em>."</p><p>He needs to <strong>leave</strong>.</p><p>The door behind him screeches as it is suddenly opened by the shockwave of his wandless magic. A distressed sound escapes the other man's lips as Alec stumbles backwards into the hallway, his back colliding heavily with the dark color of the wooden walls lining the narrow passageway. The compartment door thrashes to life again and slides to a locked position with hiss, at the same instant when the man inside his former compartment desperately lunges for the door. The wood groans underneath the trapped man's desperation, his eyes betraying his distraught state. After a few more attempts, the man inside his compartment shuts his eyes and leans his forehead against the glass.</p><p>
  <strong>Wand of elder, never prosper.</strong>
</p><p>He can't escape his fate. The fate that befell his parents. The fate that befell every other Lightwood before him. He can run but he will soon run out of places to hide.</p><p>Alec turns and <em>runs</em>.</p>
