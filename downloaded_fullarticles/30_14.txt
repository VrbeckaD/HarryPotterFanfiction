    <p>"The fight is long, but the fight is worth it."</p><p>-via Ben Maxfield</p><p>▬▬ι══════════════ι▬▬</p><p>Lupin Cottage, Early March 1965</p><p>Hope Lupin watched her son sleep peacefully from the doorway, a soft smile present on her aging face. In his arms had been a small stuffed elephant – her name had been Ellie, much to his father's disapproval as it was clearly a boy – with torn, blue felt and a loose, pink button eye. His hands, small and fragile, clutched her to his chest; she rose and fell with his breathing. The rain water against their tin roof didn't stir him one bit; the wind whipping against the windows had been nature's soft lullaby for Remus Lupin. Her eyes, blood shot with exhaustion, flitted over his sleeping figure; her son was so at peace. His tawny hair was splayed across his sheets – he despised sleeping with pillows – and the thumb attached to his free hand was lazily stuck in his mouth.</p><p>She envied his tranquility. Envied the careless snores and soft hums as he dreamt. Slumber hadn't befallen her in recent weeks; her conscience was riddled with horrific possibilities. Lyall, the boy's father, had promised his safety. His agency – the Ministry of Magic? – had posted guards around their simple town of Clovelly, but had it been enough? Hope didn't exactly understand her husband's way of life. She'd gone along with it for years hoping she could grasp the concepts and customs he enforced to the best of his ability – yet this? Her little Remus endangered? Hope didn't know his associates or his boss. How could she trust that they looked after her son?</p><p>The shuffle of feet sounded behind her, a heavy hand massaging gentle circles into her rigid shoulder.</p><p>"Hope," Lyall whispered, careful not to wake his son, "you're not invincible. You need sleep."</p><p>Hope didn't need anything but the assurance that her son would wake up safe every morning. If her husband couldn't even promise that, then she took no risks.</p><p>"I'm fine," she muttered, shrugging him away and recoiling to the confines of Remus' nursery. She lowered herself into the rocking chair her brother-in-law had gifted her all those years ago, an old afghan of her mother's draped across the back.</p><p>While she'd sworn her sanity to her husband, it had all been a ruse. Hope Lupin was far from fine. She chewed her nails, leg bouncing silently on the green carpet. Her fingers had turned into bloody stumps, the nail polish now chipped and raggedy on what had once been her nails. The skin surrounding them had been gnawed painfully, hangnails of all sorts drooping away. The bald spot near her temple itched, but with nothing to scratch it with, she endured the annoyance.</p><p>Lyall watched from the door frame, brown eyes hooded and angry, but Hope simply ignored him as all bad things eventually disappear if you pretend they aren't there. He did go to bed only minutes later, mumbling under his breath about her paranoia and foolishness. She didn't care. Remus' safety was her only priority, and if staying up all night meant that he would survive another hour, then damn it she would do it.</p><p>▬▬ι══════════════ι▬▬</p><p>Hope stirred in her chair. Her spine ached, and a crick had made itself quite comfortable in her neck. There was the patter of little feet echoing through the room. It was difficult to wake; sleep beckoned her. She'd been dreaming of much simpler times – times they spent in London while Lyall was off on some secret mission. They enjoyed their alone time, she and Remus did. They visited an ice cream shop; Remus always got the death by chocolate sundae. The sun was warm against her skin, her red hair free and her smile wide.</p><p>But it was only a dream, she reminded herself.</p><p>She pushed herself forward, eyes met with nothing but the moonlight shed from the open window. The rain dripped onto the carpet, wetting the windowsill; Remus enjoyed letting the cool spring winds in, but damn did he forget to keep the rain out.</p><p>With as much enthusiasm anyone could muster at four in the morning, Hope dragged herself across the room. Her feet were heavy beneath her, the head upon her shoulders drooping dangerously low. Goosebumps raised on her skin, the hairs on her neck prickling. The curtains waved miraculously, damp and cold. They stuck to her skin as she reached for the knobs; she cringed. The windows shut, a clicking noise ringing in her ears as she bolted them. Better safe than sorry, she told herself.</p><p>To her right, her eyes searched for Remus' sleeping figure, hopefully dry from the rain and as easy as ever. However, to her horror, he was not. Hope felt her heart plummet into her stomach, a roiling sensation in the back of her throat as she swallowed the bile. He'd just been there! She'd only shut her eyes for a small nap – nothing more. Her pulse raced; the heart within her thumped against her ribs, cracking them with each waking second.</p><p>"Remus," she said, keeping her voice low. The last thing she needed to do was wake Lyall. "Remus! Where are you?"</p><p>She fell to the floor, searching wildly in each nook and cranny possible. Remus wasn't under the bed, nor was he in his closet. His nursery was empty; no sign of him was left anywhere. Hysteria began setting in, a sweat trickling down her spine. Perhaps it was a good idea to let Lyall know of their son's disappearance? He did, in fact, work for the police! Yes, it was a good idea.</p><p>She launched herself into the narrow hallway, feet pounding against the wooden floors. If something happened to her baby she wouldn't be able to live with herself. Lyall had promised her he would be safe – he swore! This is why she forced herself awake; without vigilance, anything could happen.</p><p>The sound of the toilet flushing alerted her, stopping her frantic jog to the master bedroom. It was soft under the patter of rain on the roof, so soft she almost missed it. The sink sounded then. Someone was washing their hands. Hope approached with hesitation. Each step was painstakingly slow and deliberate, her guard on high.</p><p>"Rem," she called. "Is that you, love?"</p><p>The sink shut off. No answer. Hope could feel her pulse in her neck, the artery pumping harshly. There was nothing she could use as a weapon. She wondered if her bare hands – frail and clammy – could be of any use against an assailant. Without nails and strength, there was little she could do. Fear caressed her.</p><p>"Yes," Remus hummed, the door creaking open.</p><p>There in front of her, hair a mess and pajamas creased, was Remus. Sleep was in the corner of his eye, a little bit of soap still left on his hands. Hope visibly relaxed, her shoulders lowering and a breath of air fleeing her body. He was alright. Exhausted, yes, and a bit frazzled by her apparent distress, but alive and well.</p><p>Hope couldn't help but fall to her knees, scooping her son into her arms, "Always tell Mommy where you're going, darling. Always."</p><p>"Why," Remus asked, hugging his mother back as all children do.</p><p>Hope squeezed him, forcing herself to believe he was really there in front of her – that this wasn't her bone-weary mind playing hateful tricks on her.</p><p>"Because I said so," she said. "Just do it, honey. Listen to me."</p><p>Remus merely shrugged, "Okay. I'm sorry."</p><p>Hope stroked his hair, her hands trembling despite her resolve. Lyall would call her crazy, and he would tell her this was just her histrionics acting up. She was most definitely a drama-queen, he'd rationalize, and his promise to keep Remus safe would always be kept so long as she trusted him. But Hope had learned the hard way to only trust herself when it came to her son. She knew what was best – not the man who'd hardly been there at all.</p><p>"Come on, Rem, let's get you back to bed."</p><p>She rose, taking Remus' hand in hers as she made their way back to the nursery. There was a big day ahead of them tomorrow. Remus' first day of school would begin, and he needed all the rest he could get.</p><p>Except, they didn't make it three feet from the bathroom.</p><p>Hope's body was flung violently, a cracking feeling in her skull when she it the wall resounded within her. A body-sized dent penetrated the drywall, and Hope was left in a crumpled heap on the floor. Aches and pains were one thing, yes, but the agony on her left side was nearly unbearable.</p><p>The ringing in her ears – pitched and angry – never seemed to end. Movement had been all around her; flashes of bright light flooded her vision, and a soft cry penetrated the fog in her mind. Although her jumbled vision could make out silhouettes and stains of red on the wall, the sounds that usually followed were absent. It was all she could do to sit through the pain, hoping that the haze would soon lift.</p><p>"No," she heard.</p><p>Lyall. He cried out again, the thump of his knees hitting the floor echoing in her head. Where was he? Hope reached out into the void of clouded vision, her hand landing in something warm and wet. At first, she convinced herself it was rainwater despite knowing just how frigid rain could fall in Clovelly. Her reservations betrayed her when it felt thick and almost sticky between her shaking fingertips. She blinked, clearing away the stars in her eyes, and nearly yelped at the blood dripping down her wrists.</p><p>Whose was it? She prayed it was her own; noise was beginning to puncture the film in her ears. Remus was crying, and Lyall was shouting curses at an unknown being. Red and green sparks rained from the stairway, and glass littered the carpet. It stabbed Hope's forearms as she crawled towards the whimpering of her son.</p><p>"Get back here," Lyall howled, his voice fading as he ran.</p><p>Hope was alone. The hallway was left dark and cluttered with fractured glass and broken drywall. Still, she pulled herself closer and closer. The feeling of wet blood warmed her clothes; she ignored it. There couldn't have been that much. A warm trickle oozed down her forehead, a sting in her eyes muddling whatever was left of her vision.</p><p>"I'm coming, baby, I'm coming," she murmured. "Just hold on."</p><p>Yet, Hope wasn't sure she would make it. The incessant pain in her side was only worsening, the dull pain turning white hot. There was a nasty gash in her forehead, and the world was spinning around her. She just had to make it to Remus. He was so close.</p><p>"Where are you, Remus," she asked. "Call to me so I can —"</p><p>Hope was interrupted by wet gurgling. It was hard to make out any recognizable features within it. It was almost inhuman. Hope wanted to believe that it had been something else – perhaps the water in the sink after being clogged or maybe an old pipe underneath the house – but she wasn't stupid. Hope knew what it had been.</p><p>Not what, actually, but who it had been.</p><p>"No, no, no," she cried, finding enough energy to drag herself just a few inches farther.</p><p>She felt the warmth of her son underneath her blood-soaked fingers, the dampness of his collar sending tremors through her body. His breathing was hoarse and quick, the gurgling resounding above all else. Hope couldn't penetrate the darkness of night, and she was thankful for such a thing. What she saw might have fractured her into unsalvageable pieces.</p><p>Instead, she rolled him over to force whatever had been in his mouth out. Remus coughed, his vocal cords whining and body convulsing. There was little she could do. So she was left to wait for her husband. Left to hope that he hadn't been killed in the forest of Clovelly. Left to pray that her son would make it, or spend the rest of her life wishing it had been her instead.</p><p>▬▬ι══════════════ι▬▬</p><p>
  <i>St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Injuries and Maladies, March 1965</i>
</p><p>Lyall Lupin paced the floor. He traced each wall with his eyes, counting the tiles on the floor and ceiling in hopes to pass the time. The Healers didn't care if he worked with the Ministry; he had to wait for the results just like every other family. This is why he wanted to take them to a Muggle Hospital, but Corden wouldn't have it. In the end, it was better this way. Muggles wouldn't be able to treat Remus' wounds with their medicines. Only magic would heal him.</p><p>Lyall closed his eyes, images of the past hours rushing to the forefront of his conscience. Hope on the floor next to his dying son, both unconscious and bleeding in front of the bathroom door. Greenback smiling as he dueled with him in the forest, daring him to even try attacking him. The look on his face as Lyall retreated to his own home – to save his wife and child.</p><p>He fucking lost! His fist contacted the cement wall, his fingers now crooked from the force, but he didn't care. He punched the wall again. And again. And again.</p><p>Lyall lost to Fenrir Greyback – again. He was an absolute failure! If he'd kept his fat mouth shut at the trial, this would have never happened. If he'd just listened to Corden and allow a patrol around Clovelly as he'd told his wife, this wouldn't have happened. If he'd just <i>been there</i>, none of this would have happened.</p><p>Instead, his son would now be a <i>monster</i>. Remus John Lupin was a victim of Lycanthropy, and his wife? Hell, they didn't know if she'd survive the skull fracture. Why was all of this happening? Because Lyall fucking Lupin was a failure.</p><p>He ignored the pain in his hand, seating himself in the corner of the waiting room to sulk. If Hope died, he'd personally hunt down the bastard himself – even if it killed him. He'd rather die than live another day knowing he did nothing to save Hope. Fenrir would pay for what he did to his family; Lyall would make sure of it. The motherfucker would be sorry he ever stepped foot back on his fucking property.</p><p>"Mr. Lupin," he heard.</p><p>He refused to raise his head, nodding in the Healer's direction to acknowledge his presence.</p><p>"I've come to let you know we've stabilized both your wife and son," the Healer explained slowly, searching for some reaction.</p><p>Did he expect rejoice? Relieved sighs, or tearful smiles? Lyall didn't cry. To hell with everyone who expected him to.</p><p>With no response, the Healer continued, "Your wife will be released as soon as we know there's no permanent brain damage. Of course, we'll instruct you on her at-home care when the time comes."</p><p>"And my boy," Lyall interrupted sharply. "What about him?"</p><p>The Healer looked away, face contorted in an odd way. He was uncomfortable under Lyall's scrutinizing stare; he squirmed in his own skin. There would be no way to deliver the blow softly. Lyall was prepared for the worst. Alastor always said: be prepared for the worst. He clenched his broken fingers together, resisting the urge to wince.</p><p>"We did all we could, but," the Healer shifted his weight, "it's too late to even think about removing the disease. If we'd gotten to him sooner then —"</p><p>Lyall lunged at the man, taking the lapels of his lab coat and raising him off the ground, "So you're saying it's my fault my son is a fucking Werewolf? You think I didn't do enough, don't you? You think I'm a coward!"</p><p>"No! No, sir! Not at all," the Healer cried. "I- I was only s-saying that w-we can't do anything t-to combat the Lycanthropy."</p><p>Lyall threw the man to the ground, striding out of the room and towards the exit. He needed a damn drink. Hell, he needed all the whiskey in Ireland before he was ever ready to face his son again.</p><p>Not his son. <i>The Wolf.</i></p>
