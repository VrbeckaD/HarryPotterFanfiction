    <p>"Sirius wake up I'm leaving for school" Harry exclaimed<br/>
"Just 5 more minutes love"<br/>
"No, Sirius get up! You promised me that you would go and look at that job today!" Harry sounded exasperated, they'd had this conversation almost a million times, it didn't matter how much Harry loved his godfather, he was still a pain in the ass!<br/>
Another groan from Sirius meant that Harry would have to take dramatic measures, he grabbed the blanket and threw it away from his semi-conscious relative earning another groan along with the almost incoherent mumble of "I'm up, I'm up" Harry sighed.<br/>
Sirius beamed up at his godson from his position in bed "what's this? New glasses? Did you make those?" Harry shrugged "well come closer" Sirius exclaimed "let me get a better look at you" Sirius sighed with content "your parents would be so proud, you're so grown up and it's the first day of your last year, I'm getting old!" He mock cried.<br/>
Harry chuckled, amused at Sirius' dramatics "you've always been old, now get up and have a shower, I'm leaving now but I promise I'll visit when I can, I'll call you every night if you want me too, I love you" Sirius actually let a real tear slip this time but wiped it away before Harry could realise "I love you too son, make me proud"</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
As Harry walked towards the wall that separates muggles from the wizarding world he hears his quirky best friend Ron, run breathlessly towards him "Harry! Harry! May I admire you again today?" Harry sighed in minor acknowledgement but was still transfixed with getting through this wall, he slowly started jogging and picking up pace as he disappeared through the entrance to platform 9 3/4, Ron followed shortly after but had apparently lost Harry in the crowds, sighing he started to slowly make his way to the Hogwarts express, so deep in thought he didn't realise the wheel on his trolley had gotten stuck in a crack, flinging him over the top into a group of Slytherin girls "wellll hey there ladies, mind if I slither in?" He smirked, he was rewarded with a snort and upturned noses "listen ladies I bet we could work out a deal where either one or all of you could be pregnant by the holidays" he winked and tried to smirk suggestively, however his advances were immediately shot down with a chorus of "gross! Ew Weasley!" the most prominent comment came however from Pansy Parkingson, a short, pug faced looking girl who quite literally spat at Ron "Fuck off creep!" and was followed by her band of merry (wo)men onto the train.<br/>
Ron sighed "this is going to be a very long year" he then departed in search again for Harry whom was already situated in a empty cabin, fantasising about potential love prospects this year.</p>
