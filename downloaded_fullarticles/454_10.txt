    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Always think twice before acting..." People always said, but Hermione hadn't quite the time, nor the space to overthink something... anything, the moment their Lips collided, or the moment the older woman pressed her body against the wall.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione could only moaning, and kissing, and trying to dominate the other woman's tongue in her mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She knew she hadn't had any chance, but the challenge was arousing...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,This is so wrong..."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I know... we should probably stop..." Hermione suggested, and her teacher nodded. Still kissing her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,We definately should stop...." she said. Pressing Hermione harder against the wall...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione grabbed her teacher's perfect arse, and pulled her closer. She felt the growing heat inside her core, and earned a moan from the older woman.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Someone knocked at the door, and they broke apart immediately. Staring in shock at each other.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Go... just... go..." </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione nodded and ran out of the office, without looking at the student who had knocked...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What would have had happened, if that student had not knocked?" Hermione thought, and almost jumped in her car.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She could still taste mint on her tongue, and she could still smell the parfum.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I`ve kissed my teacher..." she thought and drove home where her boyfriend would be. Her boyfriend who´s too lazy to get a job...</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">She entered their flat, and sighed in annoyance when she found his dirty clothes infront of the bathroom, while he sat infront of their PS4.</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well... it was actually her PS4. She had bought it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Ron? Why are your clothes infront of the bathroom?!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Because you`ve told me, I should clean them up." He said barely looking at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Yes... actually I meant by that, you should put them in the washing machine."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,You know that I can`t operate that thing." He said, while he continued his game.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She rolled her eyes, and thought:</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"At least he could know, that the washing machine is not even in the bathroom..."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She picked his clothes up, and carried them into an other room, where they had their washing machine and the dryer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Ron!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What?!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I asked you to buy some laundry detergent!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Forgotten!" He yelled back, and she rolled her eyes again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So she left their flat again, and went into the next supermarket, to buy a few things, because she was absolutely sure, that the laundry detergent wasn`t the only empty thing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Why haven`t I look, what`s also empty?! Stupid girl..." she thought by herself, and bought some bread, and fruits, before she went home again...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,How was your day?" she asked him later, while their were sitting at the dinner table.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Good. I had managed it to Level 52 today."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Yeah... I thought more about your research for a job." she said, and his good mood vanished as fast as one of those demons he destroys in that game.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It's bad enough, that I know such things..." she thought.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Well... I've made a few phone calls today, and three of them, I've called, will call me back until the week is over."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Good." she said, and cleaned the dishes afterwards.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Do you have to go to work taday?" he asked, but she shook her head, and said, she wanted to take a bath, and went into the bathroom.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As soon as the door was closed, she could hear him playing his stupid game, and she sank down on the floor.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She burried her face in her hands and cried as quiet as possible...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I've kissed my teacher... I should feel guilty or something like that... it shouldn't have had happened..." she thought, while she laid in the hot water in her bath tub.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">While she thought about those red, soft lips... the tongue in her mouth... the hands on her hips... the mint scent... those icy blue eyes; she let her hands travelled over her body... she closed her eyes, and entered herself.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">For a moment she thought about what probalbly was more pathetic: that she thought about her teacher, or that it wasn't the first time, she came on her own fingers...</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I should've stopped her... why didn't I stop her?" Narcissa thought while she was under Lucius who tried to bring her over the edge.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He breathed hard, and his movements got harder, but she didn`t felt anything.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Let me take you from behind..." he moaned in her ear, and she turned around. He pulled her hips up, and entered her vagina from behind...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It shouldn`t even felt this fucking good..." she thought, and at the thought of Hermione`s soft lips, she moaned accidentally, what made Lucius move faster and harder.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After a few seconds he glided out, and she felt him at her back entrance.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Lucius..." she said a bit warningly, because the first time they tried it that way, went wrong, but he didn`t stop pushing in.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She groaned with pleasure and a bit of pain, but this time he pushed himself slowly into her until he was inside.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She needed it...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She only needed it, even if... or especially because her thoughts were somewhere else...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Somewhere where she was aroused...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Somewhere where she could forget the cock in her ass ...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,By the way, how was your day?" He asked a little later and she turned her face to him and said: ,,Nothing special ... students who tried to find problems everywhere instead of looking for the problems themselves. And Cohen had invited me to lunch."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,That fat guy, who tries to flirt with you since five years now?!"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Yes."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,What did you say?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Oh my goodness, Lucis... are you kidding me?! Before I go out with a guy, who`s that fat, and sweaty, and... disgusting, I`ll fuck myself infront of your eyes."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lucius smirked at her, and nodded...</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,Good..." she said, and stood up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,I'm going to take a bath."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Where I will come on my own fingers..." she thought, and went onto the bathroom...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A few days later the two women met at the supermarket, and Hermione felt that urge on her tongue, to say somethimg, but she didn't know what she could say.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And everytine she looked at Narcissa, who stood behind her, she felt that heat between her legs, she had felt, when Narcissa had kissed her...</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">,,We should talk..." Narcissa whispered while she passed Hermione, and without thinking, Hermione followed her...</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">tbc....</span>
