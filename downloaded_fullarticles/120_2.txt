  <em>July 26, 1997</em>
</p><p align="center">~*Catlin’s POV*~</p><p>It was mid-morning in July of 1997 when Catlin Michelson fell from the roof of her family home. The child was six years old with black curly hair and eyes the color of emeralds. Her parents, Jonathan and Clare Michelson, loved their daughter, in a sense. Jonathan had once been the heir to the vast Stark Industries, but soon became disillusioned by his father’s actions within the business and in the past. He fell in love with a girl of auburn hair and blue-green eyes and married her, taking her name to distance himself even further from his family.</p><p>When Catlin was born, and as she grew older, Jonathan began to wonder if his darling wife had been unfaithful and began to question if his daughter was truly his. He had black hair and brown eyes. Clare’s mother had blonde hair, and blue eyes, while her father had brown hair and hazel eyes. So where had the green eyes come from? This is how Catlin’s story begins...</p><p>“Clare, I don’t understand? She looks nothing like me except for my black hair!” Jonathan said, exasperated. This isn’t the first time they have had this discussion.</p><p>“Why don’t you believe me? You’re the only one I’ve been with since we started dating. I’ve told you many times before, Jon, I was adopted. My parents aren’t related to me by blood. For all I know she got her looks from my biological parents!” Clare cried out, frustrated that he wouldn’t believe her and that he didn’t want to listen to what she was saying. Clare turned and left the room, not noticing that their six-year-old daughter was sitting just behind the door.</p><p>Catlin stood and ran out of the house. She climbed the ladder her father had left leaning against the house and went to the roof. She didn’t understand why her father didn’t think she was his. She didn’t understand why they ignored her more often than not. She moved to sit near the edge of the roof, looking out over the back yard and into the field where the hay grew. She loved their farm, loved her parents, but it was times like this that she wished she was far away and truly loved for who she was.</p><p>She sat there for hours, watching the sun rise higher and higher, thinking of being in a better place like any little six-year-old would be if they were being ignored by their parents. The sun was shining on her face and the breeze whispering through her curls. She felt safe up there on the roof where no one could touch her, where no one knew she existed. That was until she fell suddenly.</p><p>Down…down…down she fell. Fear, overwhelming fear, washed over her as she screamed and cried out for anyone, anyone to save her.</p><p><em>‘HELP ME!’ </em>she cried within her mind as she screamed, before her senses were overridden by pain, unbelievable pain. She lay there gasping for breath, hoping that someone heard her cry. She felt tears on her cheeks, and then a voice…</p><p>“I’m here, Little One. It will be all right. I’ll take care of you.”</p><p>Catlin opened her eyes, only to find herself staring into her eyes. “H…hurts.” She gasped.</p><p>“Shh. let me take care of you. Don’t move,” the man said.</p><p>Catlin suddenly felt relief from the pain as her vision started to turn black. There was nothing to feel in the blackness that overcame her. She entered it; happy that the pain and the hurts disappeared the further she went.</p><p>“No, Little One. Stay with me!” she heard the kind man say. It sounded so far away, but she couldn’t stay. If she did, the pain would come back. She didn’t like the pain, so she kept going. “Shit…I need…I need to go to Hela. She can help…I hope. Stay with me, Sweet One, I won’t lose you!” and she knew no more</p><hr/><p align="center">~*Loki’s POV*~</p><p>Loki had decided to travel to Midgard, hoping beyond hope that something there could alleviate the boredom that threatened to drive him mad. One could only stand watching Thor spar with the Warrior Three and Lady Sif for so long. The healing halls had no need of him, and his father wanted nothing to do with him at the moment. It seemed that he was still not forgiven for starting a relationship with a mortal human.</p><p>He was wary when he found himself falling in love with a beautiful Midgardian. He was afraid that if she ever became pregnant, his father would tear the babe from its mother’s arms and he would never see either of them again like he had done with his other children. Fenrir, his sweet wolf, Jormungandr, his serpent, Hela, his only daughter, and Sleipnir, his youngest, used as nothing but a war horse in which the All-Father rode. A humiliation to both Loki and his poor son, the only child he bore himself. He would not, could not, allow Odin to take another child from him. So, when he found out about the relationship, he made his love forget he existed and left, never looking back, but always remembering.</p><p>As he walked through the Midgardian city in New York, he paused as he heard a cry full of fear, and desperate hope, <em>'HELP ME!’ </em>His eyes grew wide in shock; he would only be able to hear a cry for help if it was from someone of his blood. Without thinking more on it, he allowed his magic to whisk him away to where the cry had come from.</p><p>It was raining when he got there. Loki saw a child, broken on the ground, gasping for breath. He could taste the fear and feel death clinging to this child, waiting to take her to the realm of his daughter. He ran to her and brushed her wet hair from her face. She whimpered, so he soothed her, “I’m here, Little One. It will be all right. I’ll take care of you.”</p><p>When she opened her eyes at the sound of his voice, he bit back a gasp as he looked into his very own eyes. Hushing her and giving reassurances, he began to heal her as fast as he could to save her from Death. But it wasn’t enough. Loki felt her life slipping further and further into Death’s embrace.</p><p>“Shit…I need…I need to go to Hela. She can help...I hope. Stay with me, Sweet One, I won’t lose you!” and with that, Loki whisked them away to Helheim and could do nothing more but hope that she would be able, and willing, to save his granddaughter, a granddaughter he never knew he had.</p>
