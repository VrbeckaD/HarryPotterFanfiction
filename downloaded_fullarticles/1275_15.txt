    <p>July 31, 1989</p><p>The dawn light was streaming slowly through the windows of the Hogwarts castle, and Minerva had a mission before her day of meetings with Dumbledore- find Severus and send him to check on Harry.  Dumbledore insisted, over and over again, that he was fine, safe, and well-cared-for, but if that was the case, then why would he never permit her to go see him, even in cat form? No, it could be just the paranoia of an old woman, but she wanted, <em> needed, </em> to know that he was alright.  And today, during which Albus would be distracted by their making plans for the upcoming school year and therefore not likely to go looking for his potions master, would be the perfect day to do it.  The fact that it was Harry’s birthday did not escape her, and it wasn’t like she’d planned it that way, but the fact that the best day to do it happened to be <em> today </em>felt even more like a sign to her.  There was no harm in checking, just to ease her worries, and the headmaster would never have to know.  She made her way into the dungeon and knocked on the door.</p><p>“Severus?” She called through the heavy wooden door as she knocked, making it clear that this was not a call he could ignore.</p><p><em> “What?” </em> The young man came out, seething irritation, as he raised one impatient eyebrow at here.  “I’ve got <em> one </em> free day to myself to do <em> my </em>brewing in, so this had better be quick.”</p><p>“I’m afraid it’s not going to be, but it’s important nonetheless,” she told him, lips pursed.  “I need you to check on Harry.”</p><p>“Why in Merlin’s name would I go check on the Potter boy?” Snape growled.  “Do I need to make sure he’s being <em> pampered </em>enough- are you worried they aren’t giving him enough sweets?”</p><p>“Stop it Severus, and don’t be like that,” his old professor ordered.  “Albus won’t ever let me see him, and I’ve just got a nagging feeling… never mind, I need you to go to Privet Drive and do a surprise check-in for me, and it’s non-negotiable.”</p><p>“Isn’t it his <em> birthday </em>or something?” the younger man sneered.  “They’re probably out spoiling him.”</p><p>“Well, then you can check in on the living conditions and wait for them to return,” McGonagall said, unimpressed by his efforts to escape the situation.</p><p>“And if I say <em> no?” </em>The Slytherin crossed his arms.</p><p>Minerva looked at him crossly.  “Well then, I’d say Lily would certainly be very disappointed in you.”</p><p>It was a low blow, but it worked.  A look of pure agony ghosted across his face for a millisecond before he snarled “fine!” and turned to get ready, slamming the door behind him.  Minerva didn’t really care how upset he was about it, only that the job was getting done.</p><p>“Oh, and Severus?” she called back, “I expect pictures!”</p><p>____</p><p>“Meddlesome old cat,” Severus Snape muttered to himself angrily as he jerked his robes along their hangers, looking towards the back of his closet for his muggle clothing and grabbing black trousers and a black jumper.  He kept up a steady stream of angry monologuing in his head as he changed and grabbed his camera, shrinking it so it would fit in his pocket and then heading towards the back exit of the castle. Honestly, why he needed to check on <em> Perfect Potter </em>anyway was beyond him.  He wished she’d just do it herself.</p><p>But of course she couldn’t.  <em> Because Albus wouldn’t let her, </em> a niggling voice in the back of his head supplied.   <em> And isn’t that a little suspect? </em></p><p><em> Shut up, </em> he ordered the voice.   <em> He just doesn’t want the boy to know about magic. </em></p><p>The voice simply gave a little “tut” and went quiet, but it was clearly still doubtful, a discomfiting nagging setting him ill-at-ease, and if Severus Snape were one to look on the bright side, he might have said that at least checking on the boy and finding him safe would set the little voice at ease.  But if Severus Snape were one to look on the bright side, he wouldn’t have ended up in half of the situations he did in life, so the thought didn’t even occur to him. He was glad when he reached the gate and could apparate to Privet Drive, because while some people might be refreshed by a walk in the crisp Scottish air of the early morning, Severus Snape was not one of those people.  What he <em> was </em>was a person who vehemently rejected anything that might be good for him, and he was not-so-blissfully unaware that today was the day when all of that would be forced to change.</p><p>____</p><p>Young Harry Potter was quite out of it, so much so that he didn’t even realise today was his birthday as he lay curled up on his side in his cupboard.  Normally, he would have been up and cooking breakfast for the Dursleys by now (which was always perfect, however hard it was for him to cook up to Petunia’s exacting standards when he could barely make out the outline of the stove when his vision was so poor- one teacher had suggested he might need glasses, but Aunt Petunia had managed to convince her he was just rather slow), but he hadn’t been up to even sitting up for the last few days.  He’d gotten a cold towards the end of the school year, and it had gone untreated by the Dursleys, who were mad that he had ‘given it to Dudley’ (when in reality Dudley had given it to <em> him).   </em>Now, long after Dudley had been pampered back to good health, Harry’s cold had worsened first to a flu and then to pneumonia, but his aunt and uncle weren’t going to take him to the hospital to have him treated.  No, that would raise questions as soon as the doctors saw all the scars on his back and chest.</p><p>Well, not <em> all </em> of them were scars, as the painful pulling of fresh wounds from the belt reminded him.  Harry was a smart boy, and he knew enough from science class to know that they were probably infected.  He also knew that wasn’t likely to change any time soon. The Dursley were unwilling to ‘waste resources’ on him if he wasn’t able to work, so even his usual insufficient diet had been pulled from him, and his small body shook with the effects of prolonged hunger combined with illness.  He also couldn’t quite remember when he’d last had anything to drink- he had a vague memory of Aunt Petunia yanking open the cupboard door to shove a glass of water at him and then slam it shut again, aggravating his headache, but it felt like ages and ages ago (it had been yesterday)- but he knew that his throat was dry and hurt like it was on fire.  He was cold too- <em> soo cold- </em> and the threadbare blanket he clutched in his small brown hands was doing almost nothing to help.  In short, if Harry had been cognizant enough to realize that today was his ninth birthday, he would have said that it was his worst birthday <em> ever, </em>and he’d had quite a lot of bad birthdays.</p><p>The banging of the cupboard door cut through his fog.  “Are you well enough to do your chores, boy?!” Vernon roared at him.  Harry was only able to give a weak cough in response.</p><p>“Useless,” the horrid man- who looked like a walrus if a walrus were to have all of its good qualities removed and then turned into a pathetic excuse for a human- muttered, aiming a sharp kick to Harry’s ribcage.  The young boy felt a <em> crack </em>and then a stabbing pain as breathing became even harder, but even in this state he knew better than to cry out.  Vernon just kept talking as if nothing had happened, which made sense, as for him, causing Harry excruciating damage was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>“We’re taking Dudley out for the day, so you are to stay in your cupboard and not cause any trouble, understood?” he boomed, and Harry worked up the energy to make a feeble impression of a nod.</p><p>“Good,” Vernon grunted.  “If anything happens while we’re gone, there will be hell to pay.”  Harry didn’t understand how hell could possibly be any worse than this as Vernon chucked a bottle of water at his head before shutting the cupboard door.</p><p>“Don’t die while we’re gone, boy,” he thundered through the slats.  “That’ll raise questions.”</p><p>Harry couldn’t help a whimper as he stretched painfully for the water, but even after he’d managed the hard-won effort of getting it into his hands, his fingers were too weak to unscrew it.  If he weren’t so dehydrated, he probably would have cried. He was used to suffering, but this was nearly too much even for him. As he fell into an uneasy sleep, vague images of a strange, far off woman came into his head.</p><p>“Lavender’s blue, dilly dilly,</p><p>Lavender’s green,</p><p>When you are king dilly dilly,</p><p>I will be queen.”  Harry tried to reach towards the song, certain it was close, <em> so close, </em>and that it would be the end to all his suffering if he could just grab for the sound and the hand of the woman with the fiery red hair, when the cupboard door opened again and a surprised, horrified exclamation was heard.</p><p>____</p><p>Severus turned the corner just as a large man driving a company car for a firm called ‘Grunnings’ nearly ran him over, and he huffed in dissatisfaction as he continued towards number four, hoping that Potter and his relatives were home so the visit could be shorter.  They were not, however, and the man groaned, realising that he would have to wait for them to get back before he could conduct the most important part of his business. Well, he might as well take pictures of the house and its living conditions like Minerva demanded, and then he could make himself something to eat in the kitchen, as payment for their discourtesy in keeping him waiting.  Not that they knew he was coming, but still.</p><p>Looking around, he made sure no muggles were watching before he cast an <em> alohomora </em> on the door of Number 4 before entering the house.  It was quite plain and altogether unexceptional, although the sense of disquiet grew when Severus noticed that there was no sign of anyone who could be the little Potter in any of the photographs, only a whale of a boy with blonde hair standing beside… well, that was interesting… standing beside the man who nearly ran him over, and by Merlin- was that <em> Petunia Evans?   </em> Well, now the disquiet was morphing into genuine worry, as much as he hated to admit it, even to himself.  Petunia Evans would not have been the guardian he would have chosen, even for a Potter. He ought to begin his search, and he was stepping towards the landing to climb the stairs when he heard a faint but very unhealthy-sounding coughing sound coming from <em> under </em>them.</p><p>There was both a deadbolt and a padlock on the door, far more than would be required for the cleaning supplies people normally kept in such a space, and he was full of trepidation as he broke them with a spell.  When he opened the door, he saw that his fear was warranted.</p><p>The boy in the cupboard did not look nine, he looked six- and a very unhealthy six, at that.  He was thin as a rake, or maybe thinner, and there was a clear smell of infection coming from under his threadbare shirt.  Lifting it carefully, causing the boy to flutter his eyes and groan, Severus saw why- this was worse than anything <em> his </em>father had ever done.  This looked honestly more like the work of a death eater (if they ever decided to torture without magic) than it did a supposedly-respectful middle class muggle.  A couple of his ribs were clearly broken, and when the child coughed again, a deep red gob of blood came with it. This was worse than anything Severus or even Minerva could have been expecting.  Feeling for a pulse, the potions master noticed with no small amount of terror that it was weak and thready, almost fading away completely. Stealth mission be damned, he had to get the boy to Pomfrey.</p><p>He knew, as did everyone, that the child had his mother’s eyes, even if they were closed at the moment, but as he carried him back up to the castle after a very tense apparation, he was struck by the <em> other </em>ways that Potter looked like Lily.  Of course he had James’ Pakistani skin tone and messy dark hair, but when the light hit the matted curls at certain angles, one could see hints of red undertones shining through, and he had his mother’s delicate chin and soft, rose-petal lips.</p><p>The sounds of Harry’s (somewhere along the way, he’d become Harry, if only because this boy was about as far from self-assured and strong, healthy James Potter as one could get) laboured breathing grew even fainter as the head of Slytherin reached the hospital wing, throwing the doors open with a whispered incantation.  Madame Pomfrey looked up sharply, about to scold whoever dared enter her hospital wing in such a manner, even in the summer when she had no patients, when she spotted the sick child in Severus’ arms.</p><p>“My word!” she cried, faintly.</p><p>“Minerva sent me to check on Potter,” Severus said, his lips forming the tiniest of bitter smiles.  “I told her I didn’t think it was necessary.”</p><p>“Well, thank Merlin and Morgana that she didn’t listen to you,” Poppy said as she grabbed the child gently and placed him on the nearest bed, immediately running diagnostic charms.  “Oh my…”</p><p>“What?” Severus asked, his tone anxious against his wishes.  “Can you heal him?”</p><p>“I think so- that is to say, I think I can keep him alive,” the healer sighed as she set to work.  “But he has a severe case of pneumonia that has obviously been left untreated for quite a while, and one of the broken ribs has punctured his left lung.  If he survives this, he will no doubt suffer breathing difficulties for the rest of his life. In addition, his vision is terrible, worse than James’ ever was, and he’ll need glasses immediately.  Another few months and he would have been well on his way to blind. He’ll need hearing aids as well- he’s had a number of untreated ear infections that has worsened his hearing, and a number of knocks to the head means that he’s only got about 60% hearing in his right ear and 40% in his left.  He’s severely malnourished and his bones and organs are weak and underdeveloped. Still, I think we can manage to provide him with a decent quality of life through all that if we can only manage to keep him alive.” As she spoke, she was working rapidly, setting a spell to breath for Harry and take the pressure off his lungs and summoning a number of potions from her stores.  She filled a syringe with a nutrient potion and another with a rapid-hydration fluid, plunging both into the vein in his inner elbow in quick succession. He didn’t even react.</p><p>“What can I do?” Severus asked- he’d failed Lily, he’d failed her son.  They <em> had </em>to keep him alive.</p><p><em> “You </em> can go to the ministry and call in a favour with Arthur.  We need to get custody of this child before anyone finds out about this, or there could be a messy legal situation and he could end up in the wrong hands.”  She didn’t mention it, but they were both thinking that perhaps the ‘wrong hands’ could be the headmaster’s- after all, he’d insisted Harry was safe, but clearly hadn’t bothered to check, or, even worse, had an idea that something was wrong and willfully ignored it.  He couldn’t have known <em> how </em>bad it was, as having Harry Potter die while in his relative’s ‘care’ wouldn’t work towards whatever ends he’d had in mind, but if he’d known the child wasn’t happy and had done nothing, well…</p><p>“Who’s going to sign the papers?” he asked.</p><p>“You, Minerva, and I will split custody,” Poppy informed him briskly, running another sign of diagnostics.</p><p><em> “Me?” </em>Severus gasped.</p><p>“Yes, you,” she told him impatiently.  “Lily tasked you with keeping him safe, after all, and no-one can object to his having <em> three </em>capable guardians, as there is far less likelihood that all three of us will be rendered unable to care for him than merely one or two.  Now go, and don’t come back unless it’s with those papers for us to sign. It goes without saying that you should sign yours before you even return, and leave an extra copy of the signed documents at the ministry.  Now let me work, so we still have a child to look after.”</p>
