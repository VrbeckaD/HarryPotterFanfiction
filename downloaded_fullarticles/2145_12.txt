          <div class="userstuff"><p>The first person in the line was finally visible from their place, which made Scorpius bounce with even more energy and Draco’s stomach turn nervously. </p><p>“We’re almost there, Dad!” Scorpius exclaimed. </p><p>Draco tried to breathe calmly. It’s only Potter, he thought.</p><p>“He’s the best Quidditch player of the century!” Scorpius said excitedly.   </p><p>As if Draco didn’t know. As if he hadn’t spent a good part of his life admiring Potter’s skill on a broom. As if he hadn’t spent every waking moment daydreaming about him. </p><p>The line advanced a little.</p><p>“It only took him five minutes—five!—to catch the snitch in his game against the Holyhead Harpies in 2003,” Scorpius said. He was a little encyclopaedia on Potter’s facts. </p><p>“Really?” Draco said, although he already knew. He was there. </p><p>They took a few steps forward in the line. </p><p>They had been together then, during that match against the Harpies. It was a year later when their lives had shattered, or well, Draco had shattered them when he left. </p><p>“Do you know he accepted to be on a Witch Weekly cover to donate the money to the war orphans?”</p><p>It was their turn. There he was, Harry Potter himself, smiling at them. Draco’s heart was doing really weird things in his chest. Maybe he should visit a healer. </p><p>“Hello, Mister Potter! I’m Scorpius, a great fan!”</p><p>“Hello, Scorpius, and who’s this man that comes with you?” </p><p>“My dad, he’s a great fan too!”</p><p>Draco cursed to himself. </p><p>“Is he?” Potter smirked. “Maybe we can go together to have a snack, if you two are such great fans, what do you think, Scorpius?”</p><p>“YES! Can we, Dad?”</p><p>He had to agree, if only for Scorpius. Or at least, that was what he told himself.</p></div>
