    <p align="left">Caffeine was a short-lived saving grace. It always came back to bite him in the ass. Remus started drinking coffee when he was sixteen and his best mate Dora insisted on dragging him to the new coffee shop that opened up down the street from their school.</p><p align="center">MPMP</p><p align="left">
  <em>“But why do I need coffee when I have tea, Dora?” He asked as they walked into the shop to save themselves from the sudden downpour.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Because tea isn't going to help you stay up late to study for exams. Just try it, you’ll like it, you can even put a pound of sugar in it.” She smiled as she dragged him to wait in line with her.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“My sweet tooth isn't that bad.” He frowned.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She laughed, “Okay ‘Mister-I-have-at-least-five-pieces-of-chocolate-on-me-at-all-times-and-can’t-have-my-tea-without-sugar-or-honey’.</em>
</p><p align="center">MPMP</p><p>Here he was, now at the ripe age of twenty-seven, and still addicted to caffeine. Tea was great when he wanted to wind down and relax, but nothing woke him up more than his usual iced caramel macchiato with extra caramel. It was the only drink that could satisfy his hatred of straight espresso, while still wiping away any remnants of sleep that were messing with his head. In his defense, that much caffeine and sugar was needed to deal with a class full of hormonal teenagers. It was crack in a cup and Remus definitely needed the biggest size after being up all night with Teddy, who had caught the stomach flu from another kid at school.</p><p>The main problem with his caffeine addiction was while it worked wonders for his early morning slump, he desperately needed to drink a cup less he go through caffeine withdrawal and suffer a terrible migraine.But the addiction was the least of his problems lately. No, his most recent problem was the beautiful man who took his order every morning with a smile on his face and fresh eyeliner on his eyes.</p><p>Lily had brought him to the shop two days after their summer school session had started and he had been assigned to work in the room next to hers. After class that fateful day she dragged him out and explained that her husband’s best friend and godfather to her child owned the shop. After making pleasantries with the barista working at the time (her name was Mary) he offered to pick them up coffee every morning in exchange for lunch on Lily’s end. She quickly agreed and thus started his three week endeavor in which he would make two-second conversation with the beautiful man who drew a smiley face on his cup. Everyday he muttered out the usual order for him and Lily and stared for a second too long at the gorgeous barista who was already smiling at the next customer by the time he’d put his spare change into his pocket.</p><p>So yes, he would say his caffeine addiction had bitten him in the ass because now he's forced to pine from afar less he wanted to die a caffeine withdrawal induced death; because it was obviously the sugary espresso that kept him coming before work everyday.</p><p>He straightened out his cardigan as he waited for the person in front of him to finish paying. Sirius, who’s name he knew from the name tag that hung from the top of his apron, was already smiling at him, “Hi Remus, usual today?”</p><p>Remus nodded as he pulled the money out of his pocket. Sirius replied, “Okay. One large green tea and a large iced caramel macchiato with extra caramel coming right up.”</p><p>Remus smiled in return as he took his change and waited for Alice, the other barista, to complete his order. As soon as she handed off his drinks he rushed out, knowing he would be late if he stayed longer to stare at the beautiful barista. Once he arrived in the classroom he handed Lily her tea and helped her finish grading her leftover quizzes from the day before. She smiled at him, “Thanks Remus. You know, you should really come to the party next week. Alice—you’ve met Alice right, the barista in the morning— well she and I are holding a joint party for Harry and Neville since their birthday’s are only a day apart. Bring Teddy. I’m sure he’ll get along great with the boys. He’s six correct? Harry and Neville are turning five would love to have another person to play with.”</p><p>Remus bit his lip, “I don't know Lily, I wouldn't want to intrude.”</p><p>“Oh nonsense,” she replied, “we would love to have you and Teddy over. You’ve met Alice at the shop and she’s already given the okay to me inviting you.”</p><p>“That’s sweet, but I’ve never actually talked to her. Besides, Dora has Teddy that weekend, I would have to clear it with her.”</p><p>Lily smiled at her, “Invite her as well. The more the merrier. At least talk to her about it, yeah?”</p><p>Remus couldn't help but smile in return, “Sure thing Lily. I’m sure Dora would love to come. But I’ll let you know after I talk to her tonight.”</p><p>Lily took his cup after he finished to throw it away with hers. Before she tossed it she stopped and looked at him, “Is this a smiley face on your cup?”</p><p>He nodded, “Yes, don't they all have one?”</p><p>She shook her head, “No Remus they do not. Alice didn't take your order did she.”</p><p>“No,” he blushed, “ A man named Sirius did.”</p><p>She smiled, “So this is Sirius’s doing?”</p><p>He shrugged, “I suppose.”</p><p>She replied, “He must like you then.”</p><p>Remus laughed, ‘I’m sure he doesn’t. I’ve hardly spoken a word to him other than our orders.”</p><p>She smirked, “Your still blushing.”</p><p>He turned away, “Am not, it’s just hot in here.”</p><p>“You think he’s cute don't you?”</p><p>“Well I wont deny he’s attractive.” he replied.</p><p>She responded, “He’ll be at the party you know. He’s James’ best friend and Harry’s godfather.”<br/>
His eyes widened, “Wait he’s the owner of the shop?”</p><p>She smiled, “Yeah, he usually works the front of the shop in the mornings.”<br/>
<br/>
Remus jumped up when the bell rang and mumbled a quick goodbye before running across the hall to his own classroom. The class droned on as his students wrote their essays in silence. He took the opportunity to finally cave and Facebook stalk Sirius. Turns out he graduated from the same school as Lily’s husband James in Scotland and his last name was Black. He quickly found his Instagram account (siriuslyastar) through his Facebook page. It was filled with pictures of him and who he assumed to be James, though the more recent ones included Lily and there were many of Harry. One that was particularly endearing was one from Halloween where Sirius was dressed as a dog (nose painted black, pink collar and fake tail) and James and Harry were both dressed as dear.</p><p>He quickly shut his phone off as the final bell rang and his students all passed in their essays. As the final students left the class Lily made her way to his class and shoved her phone at his face, asking for him to put his number in so she could send him details about the party. As he was walking out he got a call from Dora, “Hey Remus, sorry about this, but could you come pick up Teddy today instead of tomorrow? I know you were supposed to pick him up tomorrow after your shift for the weekend but Kingsley had a family emergency and asked me if I could cover the rest of his shift so I won’t be home until later tonight.”</p><p>“Yeah I’ll be right over.” He said as he gave Lily a quick hug goodbye and promised to let her know by tomorrow if they would be attending the party.</p><p>The drive to Dora’s was short. When he got there she was already in her paramedic uniform and waiting for Teddy to finish packing his bag for their extended week. She smiled at him, “Hey sorry about this being last minute and all, but I figured you wouldn't really mind having him an extra day this week.”<br/>
<br/>
He laughed, “Of course not. Quick question, a coworker of mine invited us to her sons joint birthday party next week during your weekend. You don't have to come if you don't want to.”</p><p>“Nonsense, Remus, we would love to come. I’ll call you tomorrow to talk about it more, right now I have to run. Lock the door on your way out? Thanks, bye Teddy! Talk to you tomorrow love, be good for dad.” With that she was giving quick hugs and rushing to her car.</p><p>Remus smiled and locked up Dora’s house before helping Teddy buckle into the car and driving back home. “Hey Teddy what would you think about going to a party next week, some friends of mine have sons your age and they would love for you to come.”<br/>
<br/>
“Course dad can I show him my dinosaur?” His son asked.</p><p>“Sure thing, I’m sure Harry and Neville would love to see your dinosaur.” Remus replied looking back at the giant plush dinosaur that his son dragged everywhere but school (only because he wasn't allowed to).</p><p>As soon as Teddy was settled in his room doing his homework (which only consisted of practicing his spelling since he was six), Remus called Lily. A deep voice answered the phone, “Hello?”</p><p>“Uhh, is Lily there?” He asked.</p><p>“Yeah, just give her a moment, who’s calling?”<br/>
<br/>
Remus replied, “Remus Lupin, I uhh, work with her.”<br/>
<br/>
He could hear the voice smiling, “Remus! Lily has told me so much about you, I’m James her husband. Given any thought to coming to the party next week?”</p><p>He responded, “Yeah, that’s actually what I was calling about, to let her know I was coming and ask about what Harry and Neville were interested in, you know for gifts.”</p><p>James eagerly responded, “That’s great, can’t wait to meet you. I mean you can bring the boys anything really, as long as it isn't something lame like books-“</p><p>Remus could hear him being cut off by Lily’s voice in the background, “James give me back my phone and stop telling people to not buy the boys things they can actually learn from,” he could hear Lily talking directly into the phone now, “hi Remus, glad you and Dora can make it, and feel free to bring whatever you like. Despite what James says Harry likes reading and would appreciate anything you got him.”<br/>
<br/>
Remus laughed, “It’s okay Lily, I know that receiving books on your fifth birthday wouldn't be the most exciting thing.”</p><p>She responded, “Well Harry loves football, much to James’ liking, and Neville really loves plants.”</p><p>Remus raised an eyebrow even though he knew Lily couldn't see him, “Plants?”<br/>
<br/>
She replied, “Yes, sits and watches his mom garden every afternoon. He's such a sweet boy, doesn't like running around as much as Harry does. I always joke with Alice that I’m going to trade Neville for Harry.”</p><p>Remus laughed, “I completely understand, Teddy is definitely a ball full of energy as well.”</p><p>He could hear something crash in the background, “James what on earth are you and Sirius doing?” he heard a yelp from someone else in the room, “Sorry Remus I have to go now, my husband and his insane best friend have decided to destroy the house again. I have to go stop them before they somehow drag my son into it as well. I swear it’s like I’m raising three children. I’ll see you tomorrow!”</p><p>Remus chuckled, “It’s okay Lily, I’ll see you tomorrow. Good luck with the children, I hope they haven't caused too much damage.”</p><p>Remus hung up the phone and put the kettle on for tea. Remus was glad he met Lily. He didn't really know anyone else at the school considering he only started the semester before because the previous English teacher had to move to Spain for her husband’s job. Remus usually stayed holed up in his classroom during lunch or free periods, discussing things with his students or curling up with a book of his own. He’d grown attached to his students, opening his class to the them for lunch or just a quick chat, but he had stayed clear of the teachers. He made pleasantries with the chemistry teacher across the hall from him, Snape, but the man was unpleasant. He did make idle chit chat with the school nurse whenever he went to her for pain medication for his frequent headaches. Madame Pomfrey liked to dote on him a bit.</p><p>Remus never had many friends besides Dora and Peter though. He knew Dora’s coworkers Kingsley Shacklebot, and her now retired boss Moody, from having them for dinner so often, but he wasn't as close to them as Dora was. He was happy with his little circle, but there was something about Lily Potter that made it impossible not to like her. Maybe it was the way she barged into his class, handed him a pastry, and started chatting with him like they had known each other their wholes lives, that caused him to warm up to her so quickly. Either way he felt like Lily Potter would be a permanent staple in his life from now on.</p>
