    <p>The office was immaculate, clean and polished. The tall walls were a calming tan color, covered with portraits of infamous aurors and ministry officials. The porcelain floor sparkled without a scrape on it, and the large, ornate desk was filled with neatly stacked parchments. The edges of them were stained with tea, which spilled from an overturned teacup on the table.</p><p>Sprawled out on the chair in front of the desk lay a motionless body, drool leaking out of its mouth. Its hands had fallen to its side, head lolling on its shoulder, and blue eyes staring blankly in front of it. Its skin was white, drained of all color, and its robes, usually neat and tidy, were slightly rumpled, with some tea spilled on the front.</p><p>"Adam Jennings," spoke a green-eyed man as he stood in front of the body, surrounded by four aurors, each staring at the scene in front of them with carefully contained horror, "Forty-six years old, Caucasian, married, father of two."</p><p>"We know this, Potter," a petite woman said, arms crossed over her chest and chin lifted high. Her eyes were hard as she stared at the body, "He's our boss."</p><p>"<em>Was</em> our boss," corrected a rather large man, tall and muscular with cold eyes, "He's dead now, Arrington."</p><p>The woman's eyes flashed. Her fingers twitched, as if wanting to grab her wand and hex the guy into next week, but she restrained herself, "I <em>know</em> that, Ecclestone. I have eyes, dimwit."</p><p>Ecclestone opened his mouth to retort, but Harry, used to this, quickly spoke up to prevent it, "You two can continue this later," he said sternly, "There are more important things to discuss," he gestured at the body, grimacing lightly and pushing his personal feelings about the death away for the time being.</p><p>He and Jennings were definitely not the closest. Jennings, the Head of the Magical Law Enforcement, was just above Harry, who was Head Auror, and never had any qualms about telling him what he was doing wrong. He was blunt and stoic, never taking any excuses, and had berated Harry for leaving work early when Ginny went in labor with their daughter three years prior.</p><p>Still, Jennings was good at his job, and Harry respected the man.</p><p>Now, he was dead.</p><p>"We have to go over this. It's procedure. Okay?" he waited for the quartet of nods before continuing, "Jennings was found approximately one hour ago by his assistant. No one was seen coming in or out of his office between the time Jennings entered and the time he was found dead. There are no outward signs of trauma, or any indications of-"</p><p>He was cut off by Arrington, who spoke shortly but confidently, "He was poisoned."</p><p>He blinked, eyes flickering down to the body in surprise. Arrington offered no more explanation until Harry looked back up and arched an expectant eyebrow at her.</p><p>She sighed, as if it was obvious, and knelt down in front of the body. She gestured at the overturned teacup on the table and then at the tea stain on the man's robes, "He was drinking tea. No one came in or left because no one else entered. They poisoned the tea somewhere outside."</p><p>He frowned lightly at her explanation but nodded lightly in agreement. It made sense, and while he couldn't be completely sure that that was what happened, as Arrington seemed to be, it would definitely be good to follow up on it, "That is definitely one possibility. Myers, get a sample of the tea and send it in to see if you can find anything in it."</p><p>A skinny, young man with bright brown eyes nodded quickly, looking overjoyed to be given a task, "Yes, Head Auror Harry Potter, Sir. I will get right to it!"</p><p>The final Auror, a pretty Japanese woman who was watching the scene with sad eyes, forced a smile at Myers, and repeated something that Harry had heard several times over the last month, since Myers had joined their ranks, "You don't have to call him by that, Julian. He's just like you and me, remember?"</p><p>The man's eyes were wide as he looked at her as if she was crazy. He leaned in, where he thought, wrongly, that Harry couldn't hear, and whispered, "He's <em>Harry Potter</em>, Reina."</p><p>Tanaka gave a giggle at his words and rolled her eyes, but her short-lived amusement was quickly replaced with a somber look as she remembered what they were doing. She hushed him softly, "Here, he is just our boss."</p><p>Harry just gave a small huff. He was used to this. When he hired Julian Myers, he had known that the young man, just out of Hogwarts, was quite a bit of a fanboy, but he had also been at the top of his class, president of the Dueling Club, and made a perfect score on the Auror Entrance Exams. After entering, he had also proven himself multiple times, saving countless lives and arresting dozens of dark witches and wizards, to the point where he had been promoted from Rookie after only one year, and after only five he had already made it up to the top ranks, to Harry's most trusted Aurors.</p><p>Julian Myers was one of four of who Harry often referred to as his "team", the same four that were with him now. When Harry heard of the murder of the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement, he knew that he needed his best aurors on the job.</p><p>Other than Myers, Harry had chosen Fiona Arrington, a head-strong and confident woman who, though she often butted heads with Ecclestone, was incredibly hard-working, dedicated to her job, and incredibly perceptive. While she wasn't the most personable person, she was definitely the one that Harry would undoubtedly promote to Head Auror if he was ever promoted or suddenly couldn't do his job anymore.</p><p>On the flip side of Arrington was Reina Tanaka. She was smart as a whip and good at getting people to talk. Tanaka was cheerful and optimistic, always able to offer that ray of sunshine when their cases seemed to hit a dead end, and able to pull that one thread that seemed to be meaningless and unravel a new lead. Harry was pretty sure everyone loved her, and she loved everyone, which was both great and dangerous in their line of duty.</p><p>Finally, there was Clayton Ecclestone, the man that Harry often regretted recruiting. He did his job well, often times almost rivaling Arrington, but he was rude and cocky. Where Tanaka was loved by everyone, Ecclestone was often despised. For as many enemies as Tanaka didn't have, Ecclestone had them. He got under everyone's skin and took pride in it. There had been many times when Harry had considered demoting him, but he never did. As much as the man grated on his nerves, he was still one of his best aurors, and he got the job done.</p><p>"This case stays between us. We are not to discuss it with anyone else. Understand? Jennings's death is now top priority for you four. I want any and all information run by me. I know that if anyone will solve this case, it will be you. And you will. Understand?"</p><p>Again, the group nodded. Myers held a magical bag with some of the tea in his hands, face firm and ready to prove himself. Ecclestone, arms crossed over his chest firmly and expression stoic, observed the body silently, looking for any leads that they may have missed. Arrington gave a short look at Jennings and looked away, flipping open her folder to go over more information about what led up to his death. Tanaka knelt beside the body, putting on gloves and gently maneuvering Jennings so that she could look for any more clues.</p><p>If anyone was going to solve this murder, it would be them.</p><p>Harry was sure of it.</p>
<hr/><p>The information came not even hours later.</p><p>Ecclestone knocked on his office door, making him look up from the files that he was going over. He held a folder in his hands as he approached, turning his nose up briefly at the picture of Harry's wife on his desk, and dropping the folder in front of him abruptly.</p><p>"Found this in Jennings's office," he said bluntly, as if he wanted to say more, but knew better than to talk badly about their boss in front of Harry, "He was looking into some cold case from fifteen years ago regarding a muggle family who was murdered by a suspected Death Eater."</p><p>Harry opened up the folder, frowning lightly. Ecclestone would only bring something to him if he thought it was important, "You think this has something to do with his murder?"</p><p>The man nodded, stoic as ever, expression only betraying a bit of smugness. He reached forward and flipped the folder open to a page of suspects and pointed to one at the bottom of the page, "Look who Jennings suspected in the murder."</p><p>His eyes widened at the name and details under it, jaw dropping in disbelief, "The <em>Minister</em>?"</p><p>Ecclestone nodded, smirking, "Don't you think it's suspicious that Jennings dies after he starts looking into the Minister? Besides, look at the evidence he has against him. He's got a good case, and so do we."</p><p>Harry sighed, pulling off his glasses and rubbing his forehead, closing his eyes. After taking a breath, he put his glasses back on and gave him a firm look, handing the folder back suddenly, "I know that you're real proud for thinking that you've figured something out. But this is Minister Langley we're talking about. The same man who attended James' seventh birthday last month. Or who sent me and Ginny a wedding present. For Merlin's Sake, He even babysat James and Albus when Lily was born. You think that he, the same man who just donated ten thousand galleons to St. Mungos, was a Death Eater?"</p><p>Ecclestone arched an eyebrow at him, "Don't tell me you're getting soft, Potter," he said, scoffing, "You of all people should know that sometimes the people who seem to be your closest friends are actually your worst enemies."</p><p>It was a low blow, and Ecclestone knew it. He smirked as Harry bared his teeth, "Pettigrew was not the Minister of Magic."</p><p>"No, but we both know that we've had bad Ministers in the past," he responded with a cocky grin. He shoved the folder back at him, "Just read the file. Then, tell me if you still blindly put your faith in a Death Eater."</p><p>And with that, he left, leaving Harry with a folder in front of him and a lot on his mind. As the door closed, leaving him alone, he flipped the folder open with a sigh.</p><p>It wouldn't hurt to read it.</p>
<hr/><p>"Do you really want to make an enemy out of the Minister?"</p><p>Harry frowned as he sat in front of Ron Weasley, long-time best friend and brother-in-law. For two years, he and Ron had been aurors together, but then Ron had left after deciding, to everyone's surprise, that he wanted to live a calmer life, and joined his brother George at Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. Still, despite the eleven years that had passed without Ron at the Auror Department, Harry still found himself going to the man for help on his cases.</p><p>Which included the dilemma that he currently found himself in.</p><p>"I think I have to," he responded, frowning as he leaned back in his seat. He crossed his arms over his chest and leveled the wall with a stare, eyebrows furrowed in thought, "Jennings has a lot on him for this murder but not enough to convict. If he really was a Death Eater, and if he really did kill this Muggle family, and Jennings too, then I have to bring him to justice."</p><p>Ron sighed. He stood up and began to pace Harry's study, deep in thought.</p><p>Outside the door, children's voices began to grow louder, and Harry stood up, opening the door and peering out at his five and seven-year-old sons, who were fighting over a toy snitch.</p><p>"It's <em>mine</em>," James exclaimed angrily, holding the snitch high above Albus' head. He stomped his foot and glared at his little brother, "Go get your own!"</p><p>Albus' hands reached up as he pouted, "I wanna <em>play</em>, Jamie!"</p><p>"Boys," Harry sighed, causing the two children to look up at him, just now noticing that he had stepped out of his study, "Stop fighting. Albus, I saw your snitch in the living room. Why don't you go get it?" As Albus pouted and crossed his arms over his chest stubbornly, he raised an eyebrow at the five-year-old, "Do I need to go get mummy?"</p><p>The boy sighed and shook his head, biting his lip hard and turning around with a small huff to grab his snitch from the living room. James grinned victoriously, but stopped when Harry leveled him with a look, "You need to be nicer to your brother, Jamie. You know he just wants to play with you."</p><p>"But it's mine!" James protested. He clutched his snitch to his chest, black hair falling into his eyes and causing him to push it out of his face, "Albie always wants to take my toys!"</p><p>"I know but try and be a little nicer about it. Please."</p><p>He wasn't in the mood for lecturing his children. Their arguments seemed quite trivial next to what was troubling him, but he reminded himself that they weren't trivial to the children. James and Albus were blissfully oblivious to the turmoil lying in wait for Harry, and their worst problems <em>were</em> their toys.</p><p>And Harry was glad about that. He wanted it to be that way.</p><p>James nodded sulkily and looked up suddenly, expression hopeful, "Can you take us to the park, dad? You promised you would take us soon!"</p><p>"Maybe later. I've got a lot of work to get done. I have a big case going on. Maybe mum will take you. Go ask her," he said, trying to ignore the sight of James' face falling as he gestured towards the living room.</p><p>James crossed his arms over his chest and pouted, but obeyed, making his way towards where Ginny was reading. Harry watched him go, feeling guilty, and turned back to his study.</p><p>"You've got a family, Harry," Ron said as he closed the door, frowning as he gestured at the door, "The Minister has a lot of power. He could make you lose your job. Do you want to risk that?"</p><p>Harry collapsed in his chair and stared down at the file, at the faces of that Muggle family, at the eight-year-old girl who never got to grow up.</p><p>Finally, he sighed, "I have a lot of enemies. What's one more?" he said bitterly, "Besides, I can't just sit back and do nothing about this. The fact that he is the Minister makes this all the more important that I bring him to justice. He's in a place of power and that's dangerous, and the longer he's there, the more dangerous he will be."</p><p>There was a beat. Harry stared at the picture on his desk of his family.</p><p>"I hope you aren't making a mistake," Ron said softly, "But if anyone can take down the Minister, it's you."</p><p>His life could never be easy, could it?</p>
