    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Southview High School sprawled across a great green lawn. A flagpole was planted out front, standing proudly and resolutely, and the wide, massive building was characterized by red brick, tinted windows, and gray concrete trim. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To the right of the school was a large parking lot, the asphalt riddled with cracks and potholes, and to the other side of the school was a soccer field. Behind Southview was a football field encircled by a burnt red track. A well-equipped locker room was situated in the corner between the football field/track and the soccer field. It wasn’t difficult to figure out where the school’s funding was directed toward. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On school days, pixelated groups of students would swarm the campus, pouring from the parking lot to the front of the school, congregating around the flagpole and up into the vast structure. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius took in the scene presented by Southview with no shortage of apprehension. Transitioning to a high school during junior year, a week after school had already started, was no simple task. He found himself wishing his father hadn’t been transferred, that he could have finished his high school career at his old school. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He shoved all his doubts and wishes to the back of his mind to contemplate later—they did him no good at the present, only serving to make him more nervous. Scorpius took a deep breath, then followed the stream of students up the front steps of the school. It took a bit of time to find the office, but thankfully a couple of girls pointed him in the right direction. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The office was cold and looked out onto the school and parking lot. Two rooms branched off from the main office—one was likely storage and the other was Principal McGonagall’s personal office. The walls in the school office were lined with a dull blue and white pinstriped wallpaper and there were potted plants in the corners. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, you must be Scorpi—Sorp—Scorpis?,” the old lady working behind the counter attempted as soon as he announced he was a new student. Her gray hair was curled into a bob and there was an elegant flower broach pinned to the front of her sweater. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Er, <em>Scorpius</em>,” he sounded out with a small smile. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She laughed self-deprecatingly. “Oh, <em>Scorpius</em>. Sorry, dear. I completely butchered your name.” She shook her head and shot him an apologetic look. “We don’t get a lot of Scorpiuses around here.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s an uncommon name,” he agreed kindly. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She got back to business after the whole ordeal, recovering quickly. “Right, well, you just have to fill out some paperwork, then take a picture for your I.D. card.” She slowly typed something into an ancient-looking computer, then peered at him over the top of her glasses. “You’ve already been cleared by your doctor? Got all your tests done?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius nodded. “The files were sent in last week.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She nodded, satisfied, and turned her eyes back to her computer screen. She smelled of powder and a strong lavender perfume. Scorpius scrunched his nose to avoid sneezing, then looked around the office as she printed out some forms for him to sign. There were colorful posters on the walls promoting drug-free lifestyles and abstinence and a few anti-bullying campaign signs. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Here you are, dear. Just read through this, then sign your name and date it.” She put another paper on top of it. “Here, fill out your information and your parents’ information, just in case of an emergency.” She put yet another form above that one. “And on this one, sign here and here.” She used a long, manicured nail to point to each place Scorpius was to fill out. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He raised his eyebrows, but did as he was told. The only sounds in the room were his pen scratching against the paper and the squeaking of the lady’s chair as she leaned in it. As he was working on filling out the last form, he heard the door to the office open and close behind him. He didn’t look up, not wanting to make awkward eye contact. Once he had filled out the last form, he put the pen down, then pushed the papers across the counter toward the lady. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Perfect,” she said, flashing him a smile. “It seems we were already sent a picture of you from your previous school, so we’ll have your card printed out and delivered to you during either second or third period.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I was summoned,” a girl said behind him, coming up to lean against the counter next to him. She grinned at the lady sitting behind the computer and tucked a curly lock of blonde hair behind her ear. “What can I do for you, Eleanor?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, just in time.” The lady—<em>Eleanor</em>—waddled over to the printer, then came back with two sheets of paper, both of which she handed to Scorpius. “Here is your schedule, dear, and a map of the campus.” She turned to the girl standing beside Scorpius. “Scorpius here is new—he’s a junior, but you both have Calculus for your first period.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The blonde girl turned to Scorpius and shot him a friendly smile, holding out her hand. She was a few inches shorter than him and her eyes twinkled a milky green. “I’m Eve—Eve Carter. What did you say your name was?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius shook her hand. “Scorpius. Scorpius Malfoy.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Nice meeting you, Scorpius,” Eve said pleasantly, strangely unfazed by his uncommon name. “I’ll walk you to Calculus, then circle where each of your classes are on that handy-dandy map.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius smiled, her bubbly personality seeming almost contagious. “Thanks.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We should get going—class starts soon,” she said. “Bye, Eleanor!” Eve waved as she led Scorpius out of the office and back into the hallway. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The hallways were less crowded than when Scorpius had last been in them and the stragglers were beginning to head to class. A quick glance out a nearby window showed Scorpius that there were still students loitering outside, chitchatting with friends. He followed Eve up a flight of stairs, then to the left. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Welcome to Southview,” Eve said with a smile. “Go Swans!” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s the mascot?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eve nodded. “Swan pride.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Swans,” Scorpius mused. “Terrifying.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey, swans are vicious creatures,” Eve defended. “Have you ever been attacked by a swan?” He shook his head. “Exactly, because if you had, you’d be dead right now.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius grinned, looking around at the signs hanging up in the hallways. Most of them were advertising team tryouts or encouraging people to attend sports games once the seasons started. “Sports are pretty big here, huh?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Huge,” Eve confirmed. “Unlike the rest of the US, however, Southview doesn’t only focus on football. Soccer is just as big here, if not bigger.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius raised a brow, excitement bubbling in his chest. “Really?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eve nodded. “Really. The girls and boys teams are joined, though. Lakeview, our rivals—they’re just a few miles away—was the first high school in the state to allow girls to join the boys’ team. Once their team started kicking ass, the other schools hopped on board.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’ve never heard of that before.” Scorpius followed Eve past rows of lockers. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It was kind of a scandal until people realized the girls had no trouble keeping up with the boys,” Eve said, almost proudly. “Southview’s team took notes, so we’re not split by gender either.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s awesome,” Scorpius smiled. He guessed Eve played on the Southview soccer team—she was way too passionate about it not to. It was a good conversation topic for him to latch on to. “I played soccer at my old high school.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Eve’s face instantly lit up and she turned to face him, though didn’t stop walking. “Are you any good?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He shrugged. “I’m okay.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Listen,” Eve put her hand on his shoulder, as if to make sure he was paying attention, “soccer tryouts are this Friday—you arrived just in time. 3:30 out on the field. You saw it this morning, right?” Scorpius nodded. “Good. You’d better be there. I’m gonna tell Blaze that you’ll be there.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Who’s Blaze?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s the captain. He’s a senior, like me.” Eve grinned. “He lives and breathes soccer, so you’d better show up. He’ll be pissed if you don’t.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Right,” Scorpius said, not sure how he ended up convinced to attend tryouts. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Here we are,” Eve gestured up to the classroom number. “Mrs. Vector is nice, but she’s strict. Don’t sit by Adam or Tim and you’ll be fine.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Scorpius nodded obediently, despite not knowing who Adam or Tim were, and allowed Eve to push him into the classroom ahead of her. His mind was whirring, already focused on the tryouts on Friday, as far from Calculus as it could be. </span>
