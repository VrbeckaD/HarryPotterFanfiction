    <span>Edit: I'll leave the announcements the way they are for the most part, but I wanted all of you to know that I have done some extremely extensive changes to the existing chapters. Again. If you are one of my previous readers, you will definitely want to go back over the chapters and re-read them. Again. Some chapters have few changes while others have major overhauling. Please tell me what you think! I was not happy with how it had turned out the first time (and second time - I'll probably never be satisfied) and I had some new inspiration. Hopefully this time there will be even better flow.</span>

    <span>Also, having trouble with translating some things correctly into ancient languages. I'll try to still use translated words occasionally, but I'll write everything in English while making note of what is actually being spoken in another language. Make sense?

  <b>Chapter One: Prologue</b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The cemetery of Little Haggleton had been long abandoned back to nature, for all the good it did. Even the flora had long since succumbed to the call of Death. Amongst the crumbling tombstones and clammy fog he walked as if through an infinite maze. An impression of towering hedges pressed in against either side of him, suffocating, but not there if he turned his head to look. "Murderer…" The word was breathed out over a stale wind. "You killed me, Harry… Murderer."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He sped up, but milky eyes suddenly loomed from the darkness before him along with a flash of ashen yellow. "Why, Harry? Gloryhound. How could you?" The rest of Cedric's rotting face came sharply into view. "If you hadn't insisted that we both grab the Cup, I wouldn't be dead. It's your fault that my parents had to bury their only son. It's your fault… all your fault, Harry…" Rotting hands, fingers like claws, reached out to him through the encompassing darkness...</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The black haired teen woke with a scream choked in his throat and that threatened to erupt. Self preservation kept him quiet, but tears gathered in his eyes that the gangly fourteen, nearly fifteen, year old boy could not suppress. He immediately curled up into a tight ball and let out several sobs. His body was shaking as he tried to forget the images that were replaying over and over in his head with the accusations that were being thrown at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He knew that these weren't normal nightmares for a young teen boy. No one, let alone one barely more than a child, should have to witness a murder in front of their eyes. But it wasn't just that… they hadn't even given him any sort of counseling. Any sane person would make sure that he was still alright after something so traumatizing, right? But no… he was locked up back at his relatives. That was certainly abuse too, even if they hadn't physically touched him. Besides that, not even his friends had messaged him besides the letter saying that Dumbledore had said it wasn't safe for letters but he would be picked up sometime in the near future to go somewhere undisclosed. Of course, that was all that he knew, that they deigned to tell him… and somehow, he felt that there was something very wrong. But then again this was the life of Harry Potter so why should he be any surprised at all? He was allowed to be a little melodramatic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he was just about to resign himself to another sleepless night, a heavy sort of feeling descended like the fog from his dream. Feeling uneasy, Harry climbed out of his bed and made his way over to his window. With a sense of foreboding, he carefully looked out from where he was hidden by the curtain. What he saw made his stomach drop. Deatheaters… he could recognize them even at this distance. How did they find out where he lived? A spy maybe? The how didn't matter if he never made it out alive, so he had to find a way to get out quick. With few options at hand, he scrambled over to his desk to scribble something onto a scrap of parchment. He attached it to Hedwig's leg and brought her over to the thankfully already open window. "I dunno if this'll do any good, but take this to Dumbledore," he pleaded with his owl before releasing her carefully out the window, trying not to be noticed. She was flashy, but maybe an owl would be overlooked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he looked down at the gathered group then, Harry bit his lip anxiously and grabbed for his wand. He didn't know how or why they were here, but Professor Dumbledore had mentioned something about blood wards protecting him. They were the whole reason he even lived here during the summer. If anyone meant him harm, they couldn't enter, right?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But… Voldemort had used his blood in that ritual hadn't he? The bastard had mentioned something about protection… wouldn't that void to Voldemort the wards around the house? He hadn't seen the man yet, but that didn't mean that he wasn't there or would appear soon. Why had Dumbledore not thought of this? Every racing thought rooted Harry to his spot and drained blood from his face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then, as if on cue, Harry's scar flared with blinding pain and a tall figure materialized from the sea of cloaked figures. The macabe parody of a man that was Voldemort stood out as a beacon amongst the masses of his followers, his flesh ashy and gaunt. The reaper's smile on the man's face was enough to break the binding of Harry's feet and he didn't even stop to think as he bolted from the window and made his way into the hallway.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he turned away from the window, he never saw Voldemort draw his wand and use it to call forth the wards. Inside the house, Harry did what he could to block the bedroom doors. As much as he hated his relatives, he didn't want their deaths on his conscious. If he survived this. Alright, he had to admit he just didn't want them getting in the way. If they came barreling in, then chances of survival fell to complete zero.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He could hear his uncle start to make some angry noises, but ignored it in favour of creeping down the stairs. He avoided the windows as well as he could, though snuck a peek out into the dark. It wasn't hard to realize that the house was completely surrounded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Come out, come out, wee little Potter!" The shrill voice was a whiplash through what had been an oppressive silence, the first flash of lightning that broke the calm before the storm. The very sound of it made a shiver go down Harry's spine and he tightened his hand around his wand, his gaze darting about frantically for any inspiration. What could he do? Going out there would be certain death, but would anyone even come in time? He had used underage magic, so perhaps the Ministry would come?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But, as if summoned by the very thought, there was a ripple of laughter through the gathered Deatheaters. The Bellatrix's shriek rose above the rest. "Little Boy Potter is such a naughty child! Lookie here! 'Dear Mr Potter,'" her voice took on a nasally tone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"'We have received intelligence that you performed the Levitation Charm at twenty-three minutes past one this morning in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the household of a muggle family.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence to destroy your wand. Hoping you are well and yours sincerely, Mafalda Hopkirk.' Oh, how precious! They'll find his wand in as many pieces as he'll be!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Well, that certainly answered his question on whether or not anyone would be coming, Harry thought wildly as he tried to block out the roaring laughter from the death eaters. Of course they wouldn't come when they could instead send useless mail! Instead, they'd be along far after they'd be of any use!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But mental rants about the incompetence of the Ministry would not do him any good. Harry knew Voldemort was taunting him and that was only making him panic more. He had to do something – anything! There had to be something he could do; he'd survived a murderous Tournament for Merlin's sake.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Tournament. Well, in for a knut, in for a galleon. With little thought, Harry summoned his Firebolt. Maybe he could fly out… he'd survived worse odds before and he wasn't the youngest seeker in a century for nothing. A small chance was better than no chance and he'd take possibly dying over definitely dying any day. He was a Gryffindor anyhow, right? They were known for their idiotic bravery. Though, this couldn't really be called bravery, but rather desperation to save his own hide no matter how reckless he was. But then, he'd never really been accused of being smart before. That was all Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a deep breath and a clench of his jaw, Harry steeled himself for this reckless notion he was about to attempt with nothing but a wand in his hand. He grimly mounted his broom and took another deep breath, counting the beats of his hammering heart. Steady now, he could do this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Diffindo!" The spell exploded from his outstretched wand and took the door with it. An explosive mixture of wood, plaster, and brick rained down on the unsuspecting Deatheaters. Harry did not waste even a moment as he shielded his face and flew out through the debris. Veering sharply upward, he spiraled like a rocket as he sought his bearings. But the Deatheaters had not been a powerful army because they were slow and stupid. Curses and hexes of varying acidic hues whizzed past him through sheer dumb luck, their spellcasters recovering quickly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But the dream of escape fled in a moment as Harry impacted against the wards, suspended in midair as numerous curses slammed into his suddenly prone back. Fissures of light like shattering glass spread a web across the ward's dome from his point of contact. Pain that could drive a man to insanity arched and contorted Harry's back, a voiceless scream choked in his throat. The fizzling air around him seemed to almost physically expand, an unearthly whine building until there was a moment of complete stillness that lasted only half a heartbeat. In the next, the ward imploded sending Deatheaters disapparating to flee the shockwave.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The last Harry knew was a blinding pain, a relief to the previous agony, that flashed like lightning across his face originating from his scar.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <span>((Page Break))</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The first thing he perceived when he came back to awareness was the pain. Every last bit of him ached, though perhaps his head most of all. He didn't know how long he had been out, but all he knew was that he wanted to go back to the soothing darkness. It didn't hurt there. Still, he found himself instead opening his eyes to try to figure out where he was. And, of course, he didn't recognize the place at all. He slowly tried to rise up off of the ground and the pallet he'd been laid out on while he attempted to push down the welling panic. But before he could get far, a voice interrupted him. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I would not do that if I were you."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was the voice of a young boy, maybe around the same age as him. Looking over quickly, he noticed that the stranger had bright red hair and amused light green eyes. He did look about the same age as him, too. Although, he was perhaps a little taller and he did have the beginnings of lean muscle. But all that he only gave a passing glance at. What took over his attention was the language that the boy spoke. He didn't understand a word of it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"You have been asleep for quite some time. You should not be getting up. That wound will be needing tending again, too."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The boy was smiling as he walked further into the round stone hut. He crouched down to add more wood to the center fire. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"What happened to you? I found you in a field, the ground all ash around you."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With little other choice, and no strength otherwise, he settled back down onto the straw pallet. "I… I cannot understand you," he finally stuttered out, making the other boy look at him in surprise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"What? I do not understand you."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The boy looked puzzled, obviously having the same problem that he was. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"You cannot speak my tongue? Are you not from around here, then?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He then suddenly rolled his eyes and lightly smacked his forehead as the black haired teen watched in bemusement. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Ah, that was not a smart thing to ask. Of course you do not speak my tongue. It is not hard to miss."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The boy looked irritated for a moment, crossing his arms. Finally, he looked back over. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Can you tell me your name?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He then stopped and huffed softly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Of course not. What am I thinking?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> The boy then pointed towards himself. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Godric Gryffindor. My name is Godric Gryffindor."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He then looked at the other boy, obviously waiting for a response.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy on the bed looked a mite bit panicked while deciding the other boy spoke too much for the language barrier between them. And now he was looking at him as if he expected a response. The other boy had rattled off so many things, what on earth could he have said? But on a hunch, and feeling unsure, he pointed towards the other. "Godric… Gryffindor?" He repeated that part slowly and received a bright smile in reward.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The red haired boy pointed to himself again. "Godric." He then paused and pointed towards that other. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Who are you?" </em>
  </b>
  <span>The boy looked entirely too proud of himself, but he concentrated on trying to figure out the question.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The answer was simple enough, but he pointed towards himself with a frown. If the boy was Godric then he was asking now for a name. His name was… a cold stone of panic dropped into his stomach as he tried to quell his once more rising panic. He ignored the confused and worried look that was thrown at him as he desperately searched through the tattered remnants of his memory. For something that should have been simple, he found himself coming up empty.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was just trying to figure out how to relay his problem to the other boy when a half formed memory flitted through. It was gone too quickly to properly analyze, but a name came attached to the fleeting memory. He was there with one – two? – others and they were talking about something. He couldn't remember what… but that name seemed important. Perhaps it was his? Still feeling uncertain, but with nothing else to go on, he pointed towards himself again. "Salazar… Salazar Slytherin." He received another bright smile in return.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>((Page Break))</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"You know, this not knowing the same speech situation that we have gets rather... old."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The annoyed tone to the boy's voice made Salazar roll his eyes. He thought he knew the gist of what the other was talking about, but it was certainly rather annoying to not be able to communicate. They could only get so far with over exaggerated gestures. In conclusion, he was going to have to learn the other language. Which might take some time, but he understood a few things after the few days he had been spending with the other boy and the result would be well worth it. Godric always seemed to ramble on about things and Salazar could never make heads or tails of it all. Sometimes he wondered if Godric either liked to hear himself talk, or if he was hoping that Salazar would just one day suddenly figure out how to speak the language. It certainly hadn't worked so far and he was at his wit's end. Gods knew that Godric certainly was if his tone was anything to go by.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But speaking of the other boy… he didn't know much about Godric. All he knew was that the boy lived here in this little stone hut in an abandoned, rather half burnt, village near the sea. Godric had made himself a cozy little living space in a village that was devoid of all other people. Most of it looked to have been burned down and part of him wondered what had happened to the people. Slaughtered? But then, where were the bodies? Perhaps the survivors buried their dead and then moved on? And he didn't know why Godric was here on his own, or if he had been a survivor of whatever had happened here. He certainly had no way to ask anyways. Godric didn't seem to mind being out here, he thought. And since he didn't know anything about his own past, he also didn't know how he had come to be in this place or if he had any family in the world. For now, he could stick with the other boy. He did enjoy his company, besides. They just had to overcome the language barrier and they weren't getting anywhere fast like this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a sigh, Salazar picked up an apple and turned to Godric. He was tired of the ranting from Godric that he couldn't understand. Really, why hadn't the boy thought of this earlier instead of just obviously complaining about it? Why hadn't he tried this earlier? He'd done himself no good by moping about until now. He wouldn't do that again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Giving Godric a stern look, Salazar pointed at the apple that he was holding in his hand. Once he had Godric's attention, he raised an eyebrow and gestured again. He was expecting to get a name for it, if the silly boy actually understood what he was trying to get at. Of course, all he got in response was a blank look from the redheaded boy. Sighing, Salazar rolled his eyes. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"What?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He had probably butchered the pronunciation, but it was one of the few words that he knew, given how many times it had come up in their rather one-sided conversations.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At the word from Salazar though, Godric suddenly seemed to brighten up and understand. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"You want me to teach you!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He grinned, looking fully proud of the deduction. It made Salazar sigh, but a fond smile teased the edge of his lips. No matter how hard it was for the two of them to communicate, he found himself enjoying the other boy's presence. He was just too adorable to ignore. But that wasn't something to ponder over now while he was finally getting his language lessons. He wasn't sure what Godric had said, but the boy seemed to understand finally so they could get this underway.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Proving him right, Godric grabbed the apple and pointed at it with a flourish. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Apple."</em>
  </b>
  <span> In response, Salazar rolled his eyes but carefully repeated the word. Godric nodded approvingly and the lessons took off. Salazar forced Godric to give him the names of various things, pointing to one thing after another. He would go over them again and again until Godric would indicate that he had gotten them right. Godric got bored of the process quickly, but could not say no to Salazar who seemed to hunger for the knowledge to learn more. Necessity made him learn quickly. Besides, there wasn't much else he could do while he healed from whatever accident had robbed him of his memories and had scarred his face. Godric had said he was lucky he hadn't lost his eye.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>((Page Break))</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In the end, Salazar was very thankful that he was such a quick study. He still didn't have any memories of before he had woken up in Godric's hut, but he could remember other things. An instinctive thing, he was sure. He knew how to be a person, but everything that made him who he was… was gone. Who was to say that he was like he had been before? He really tried not to dwell on it because maybe now he had a chance of being a better person. At least one advantage of not having any memories, and being stuck in a place where no one spoke his original language, helped him learn how to speak Godric's tongue quickly. Of course, he was still learning and Godric took great enjoyment in correcting him, but he could actually have a decent conversation with the other boy. Said boy who he still didn't know much about. Though would it matter either way, he didn't know. Knowing where Godric came from might not make much sense to him with his memory the way it was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Still, Salazar had the feeling that Godric was hiding something from him. But for now, he said nothing. Why should he change what they had now? It worked for both of them. So instead of trying to ask about Godric's own mysterious past, he had gotten the other boy to start teaching him about the land they lived in. He wanted to know everything. His lack of memories opened up a thirst for learning and knowledge, another positive side effect in Salazar's mind. Which did remind him of something he wanted to ask the other boy…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Godric,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar called out as he pulled on a tunic. He had scavenged for wearable clothing in the crumbling stone huts of the abandoned village and had managed to find a few wearable tunics, a pair of trousers, shoes, and a cloak. Most things had been destroyed or were too ratty for use. One such ratty tunic he had used for wrappings on his feet and over his wrists to make his clothing more manageable. A length of rope finished off the outfit as a belt. Slipping on his well worn shoes then, he went to go find his friend. He was nowhere to be found in the nearby burnt out huts. Confused, Salazar continued to work his way outward as he looked through the ramshackle buildings. He hadn't thought that Godric had said he'd be wandering off anywhere.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he searched, there were suddenly two strong arms that wrapped around him. A filthy hand clamped over his mouth and foul smelling breath washed over his ear. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Be still, boy."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The voice was rough and there was no trace of the rather fine way of speaking that Godric had. It suddenly made him suspicious of Godric's origins again in a small part of his mind. But there wasn't time to think of such things, so he quickly stopped moving. His body may have gone still, but there was a calculating look in his eyes. Who was the man? Where had he come from? What was it that he wanted? A bandit of some sort perhaps? Whoever he was, how was he to get out of the man's grasp? Was Godric okay?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But speak of the devil and he shall appear. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Hey! You get away from him, you filthy thief!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Godric's voice rang out and interrupted Salazar's thoughts. It made Salazar want to groan in annoyance no matter how pleased he was to know that Godric was safe… for now. Stupid, brash Gryffindor. Grunting softly as the grip on him tightened, Salazar's eyes then went wide as cold metal pressed into his throat. He thought he knew what that was… and he rather hoped that Godric wouldn't do anything stupid. But of course, his friend being who he was, took a step forward. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Hey! I said get away from him!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> The knife only pressed harder against his throat and Salazar started to panic. This was not how he wanted to die! He would come back to haunt Godric the rest of his life if the boy caused his end!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But as his panic rose, a sort of heaviness grew in the air like the heat of a humid summer's day. When the knife at his throat suddenly drew a line of blood, the pressure exploded outwards in reaction. The man who held him captive was thrown backwards and through an already crumbling wall. The unstable house collapsed upon him and buried him in debris. Salazar could only look at the building in surprise, a hand going to his injured throat as he turned to look at the settling stones. What had that been? He looked down at his hand then, almost expecting it to look different.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He did not know what he expected as he turned back to Godric, ridicule or suspicion were both likely. But the boy was gaping at him in a small amount of awe. Salazar was starting to feel uncomfortable when the boy suddenly burst out, </span>
  <b>
    <em>"You are a wizard, too! I thought you were just a mundane."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He then smiled brightly and walked over to his friend. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"That was a simply amazing piece of magic, Sal!"</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Do not call me that infernal nickname,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar huffed back automatically, his mind abuzz with the new developments. Magic. He knew it as the truth as sure as he knew that the sky was blue. Whatever had stolen his mind had not stolen his magic. But to have forgotten such a piece of himself! Praise be to Godric's gods that the knowledge had been returned to him. And to find that Godric had magic as well! However, that brought up an interesting point. Salazar's eyes narrowed and he put his hands on his hips. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Explain. Now."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He said sharply, making Godric scratch the back of his neck sheepishly. Salazar could not fault the other boy for hiding such knowledge, but he still wanted answers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"If you want, Sal… but we should probably move on from here."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The boy looked around a little sadly and just a tad nervously. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I mean… who knows how many more are out there."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He motioned towards the caved in house where the bandit had been thrown into. Godric really did not want to hang around to find out if he had friends around. So, he quickly led the way back to their little hut once Salazar agreed that they shouldn't hang about. There, both boys gathered up what food they could in some makeshift packs. They had little else to take with them so Godric quietly led his friend out of the hut and out of the small grouping of buildings. Running into the nearby forest, they were soon on their way in no particular direction. No one seemed to be following them so it was there that Salazar demanded once more for Godric to tell him his story. Finally, and grudgingly, Godric did.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He licked his lips nervously before taking a deep breath, not looking over at Salazar as he spoke, </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I come from a noble family of sorts, as I am sure you have figured out by now."</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar nodded curtly in response as he carefully found his footing through the woods as they walked. Godric's speech and mannerisms were too proper for what he had had a feeling a poor lad would otherwise be like. He waited impatiently for Godric to continue but Godric nibbled on his lower lip for a few moments before continuing. He sighed out then. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"My parents are both mundane. But I started showing signs of magic when I was very young. A local man in the village noticed and offered to teach me magic in secret,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he said with a shrug of his shoulders, not explaining how the older wizard had found out. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"A few weeks before I found you, I took a trip with my parents to visit my mother's family. However, while we were traveling we were set upon by rogues."</em>
  </b>
  <span> A scowl passed over Godric's face. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I used magic to protect myself… I had no other way. But I was banished. My parents disowned me and threw me out."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The boy didn't look pleased and perhaps a bit saddened. Salazar could imagine it was from the betrayal of his parents. Magic was a gift to be proud to have, but if there was one truth that he felt down to his bones it was that not everyone took kindly to the abnormal. Where he learned this lesson was something he might never know, but it was ingrained deep.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was broken from his thoughts as Godric continued to speak. "</span>
  <b>
    <em>If it was not for the magic I had been taught, I do not think that I would have survived this long. Nobles are not exactly known for being able to survive in the wilderness,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Godric snorted, making a joke at his own expense.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar didn't respond, not knowing what to say. What could he say anyways? But finally, the black haired boy let out a breath. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"If it is any consolation… if it had never happened, I doubt that you would have met me. We would have never met so we would not be good friends."</em>
  </b>
  <span> In response, he got a small smile. They had each other. The past was past as far as Salazar was concerned. It was not like he could remember his own anyways, so they could put such things behind them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>((Page Break))</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar cursed as his vision suddenly became blurry. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Not again!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He raged, feeling irritable enough to really have an outburst of emotion. Across from him, Godric grimaced before lowering his new wand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"</span>
  <b>
    <em>Sal… this is the third time you have lost those,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he complained. He was not about to take advantage of his friend's near blindness in a simple duel like this. They were both just getting used to their wands and new spells. Godric did not want to accidentally hurt his friend since they both were not the best duelers yet. He knew that in a real duel he would have to take advantage of anything that he could, but this was different. They could be more ruthless to each other once they really knew what they were doing, Godric decided. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"You should really do something about those. Even with anti-summoning charms and some sticking charms, you still manage to lose them or somehow break them."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar gave his friend an angry scowl. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Do you think that I do not know that?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He snapped back, his eyes unfocused and looking just over Godric's shoulder much to the red haired teen's amusement. He wisely chose not to comment on it as he walked over to where the man's strange vision correctors had dropped.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Picking them up, he cleaned them and fixed the cracked glass quietly before handing them over to Salazar. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I heard there was a potion that could fix your eyesight,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he said in an offhand sort of manner. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Maybe we can ask Master Wolfhelm about it,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he said, referring to the wizard who had helped them build their wands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Taking the contraption with a grumble, Salazar pulled them on and breathed a sigh of relief when his vision cleared. He then turned his eyes towards Godric. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"A… potion you say?" </em>
  </b>
  <span>He spoke thoughtfully. Most of the wizards they had come across really did not know their potions. Most seemed to be under the impression that it was women's work. Salazar himself knew very little about potions as well. There was some sort of lingering resentment towards the subject that he did not understand, but it did not damper his curiosity. What sort of things could be done with potions? He knew that Master Wolfhelm had some knowledge of the subject as it had been instrumental in the construction of their wands. Decided, he tucked his wand away. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Yes… I think I will look into that. It is a perfect opportunity to learn more</em>
  </b>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric gave him a look of amusement before tucking his wand safely away in the holster at his wrist as well. They had both gotten one as a present from Wolfhelm when they had successfully completed their wands. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Well, let us head back to camp then. Master Wolfhelm was talking about moving on again."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He was eager about getting his friend's eyes fixed. They could really concentrate on their dueling then and they would not have to worry about Salazar losing his vision.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They went to go find their mentor and, as soon as Salazar tried to vaguely go about asking how the potion was made without trying to sound too eager about it, Wolfhelm had exuberantly told him that he had been waiting ages for Salazar to come to him and ask. Salazar had been prepared to hex Godric as the man struggled to breathe through his laughter in the corner of the tent. Apparently he had to work on his subtlety. That or Wolfhelm was a lunatic... but then, he had already known that their mentor was insane. Godric was a lunatic as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But the lunatic of a master had the knowledge that Salazar needed. So he sucked it up and let the man teach him. Wolfhelm really was all too eager to teach him too, including a lesson on why certain ingredients were used and why they had to be prepared the way they were. That had been immediately followed by his refusal to let Salazar brew potions unsupervised. The young man had started a few experiments that had not ended well, as he had wanted to see what happened when he had added certain ingredients together. It had been what had prompted the lesson on potion ingredients in the first place. He had been unable to control his curiosity, but it had been an important lesson.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In the end, Wolfhelm gave Salazar a scroll he had compiled on ingredients and techniques before he forbade him to experiment until he had better knowledge of the ingredients he was to work with. He did not want the teen to accidentally blow himself up. He had spent too much valuable time teaching them and he did not want it to go to waste. Or so he said. So with Salazar forbidden from his experiments for now, Wolfhelm was able to guide the teen through the makings of the potion.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was after the week long brewing process that found them all gathered in the tent so Salazar could finally use the potion. Wolfhelm gave his student a searching look. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"So you do understand what will happen once I place a drop of the potion in your eyes, yes?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar was currently lying on his transfigured bed with Wolfhelm sitting in a rickety chair next to him. He had a small wood hewn bowl in his hands and a little spoon. Godric was standing nearby, a grim look on his face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar nodded his head stiffly as he stared at the cloth ceiling with his unfocused gaze. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Yes, sir. Once you put the potion in my eyes, you will need to seal my eyelids shut so the potion can work. They will be sealed for three days before you will unseal them,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he repeated what had been told to him several times during the brewing process over the course of the week. Salazar was still determined to do this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So Wolfhelm carefully dropped some of the potion into the young man's eyes before he quickly instructed him to close them. Once that was done, he tapped Salazar's eyelids with the tip of his wand. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Are you comfortable?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He asked as he watched for any signs of an unusual reaction. Salazar only grumbled as his hands twitched with refraining from the obvious urge to rub at his eyes. Wolfhelm chuckled as he stood up. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Well, I shall leave you two boys alone. I will go dispose of the leftover potion." </em>
  </b>
  <span>And with that, he was gone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric walked over to his friend and sat down on the chair that Wolfhelm had vacated. He then reached out and took his friend's hand. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"How does it feel?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He asked curiously. He had been a little worried that it would not work, but Salazar had been so determined and he knew that Wolfhelm would not administer a potion he thought would hurt Salazar. Besides, he had been the one to suggest the potion in the first place to his friend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar quickly slapped Godric's hand away and sat up. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I feel fine,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he told his friend. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"And you know I despise being coddled like that. I am neither sick nor dying. You do not have to act like I am,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he said stiffly before he stood up. Taking a deep breath then, he walked towards the entrance of the tent. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I just have to survive three days of this. It will be fine. You worry too much."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric gave a long sigh and a roll of his eyes. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"And you are too proud,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he muttered as he stood up and grabbed the back of his friend's tunic before he could trip over the trunk that rested just to the side of the tent flap. He steered him in the right direction before he left after Salazar. It was going to be a long three days… but at the end of it; Salazar should never have to use the strange vision correctors ever again. So he was not going to complain. Too much.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span></span>
  <br/>

</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>"Expulse!"</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar cursed as he ducked under the maroon spell that streamed towards him with a faint whistle. He flicked his wand sharply while hissing a spell beneath his breath. The pale blue spell crackled on its swift course towards Godric. Immediately, the other teen circled his wand quickly to bring up a shimmering shield. However, the strength behind Salazar's spell was too strong for Godric's shield. The blue spell barely slowed down as it passed through the shield, spiderweb cracks bursting from the impact point before shattering into nothing. The hex slammed into Godric's chest and sent the teen flying backwards, where he crashed into a nearby tree trunk. Only a swift cast of a cushioning charm kept him from severe injury. The red haired wizard grumbled to himself as he stood up and brushed off his tunic. Godric then raised both of his hands while he stated sourly, </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I surrender."</em>
  </b>
  <span> His sour look quickly turned into a scowl at the smirk that Salazar had on his lips as he twirled Godric’s wand in his fingers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It had been a couple of years now since the two had met. With no real home to return to for either of them, at least that Salazar could still not remember, they had spent the time travelling. Ever since they had left that ruined little village, they had never stopped moving for long. For it was during their travels that they often came across various wizard kind that would agree to teach them. It had been a year into their travels that the two young men had come across a man that had agreed to teach them wand crafting so they were able to create their own wands. While wandless magic was definitely useful, it was much easier to channel more powerful spells with a wand as a focus. A wand had the ability to channel more power with more accuracy. The same thing could be done through wandless magic, but one would need a great deal of concentration and double the time of a spell with a wand. Wandless magic was not practical for dueling unless one wanted to throw around mainly stunners and disarming spells. Wands were much more practical and handmade ones were more attuned to their wielder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So once they had their wands, the young men - now roughly sixteen by estimation on both boy's counts - had soaked up every bit of knowledge they could find. Salazar had even amassed a good size library of scrolls and even a few precious books. He kept these all hidden in a trunk that he had shrunk to fit on a chain around his neck. He had started his own journals as well, taking notes and making observations.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And now, currently, the two young men had taken a break from their travels to practice their dueling skills and settle down for the night. And Salazar had come out the victor. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Seems I win again, Godric,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar drawled, a smirk on his lips. His dark green eyes glinted in amusement as he looked over at his friend. He then threw the teen his wand before brushing off himself and picking up his pack. "</span>
  <b>
    <em>There is a village not that much further along the road, if my calculations are correct. Instead of staying here, we should be there by nightfall and can find an inn. There we can stay the night instead of sleeping on the dirt road again. I would rather not listen to your complaining again about how the rocks are digging into your delicate back,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he practically purred. He could never pass up the chance to tease Godric. And the man really could give as good as he got, so it made things all the more entertaining.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"We can decide what to do from there, if it agrees with you."</em>
  </b>
  <span> However, instead of a retort back, Salazar only received a curt nod in reply. Rolling his eyes in exasperation at Godric's brooding, he shot a quick cheering charm towards the other male. He hid a smirk as it hit the man in the back, but could not hold back a snort as Godric twitched as if he had been briefly tickled. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Oh, stop your moping, will you? You have bested me many times in a duel. It is only fair that I should best you for once."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric huffed and shouldered his own pack, making a big show of being disgruntled. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Yes, but I have been losing much more frequently as of late.”</em>
  </b>
  <span> He paused then.</span>
  <b>
    <em> “And that cheering charm was entirely unnecessary,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he tried to grumble but it came out with a giggle at the end. He quickly clamped his mouth shut as Salazar only chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. As he pouted in response, Godric started off towards the road again. Salazar snorted and followed after him, waving their privacy ward away before tucking away his wand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With Godric in a snit, they walked along in silence for awhile. That suited Salazar just fine, taking the time to look around them and just enjoy the countryside. But as they walked along the road, Salazar spied smoke in the distance. He frowned as he studied the curling ribbons, deciding that it was much too dark and plentiful for normal stove fire. Concerned, he motioned towards the area to get Godric's attention. He didn't have to say anything before Godric nodded grimly and apparated away without much thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Typical, Salazar thought with a roll of his eyes and followed after him. Reckless Gryffindor, going in without thinking. At least the man had enough sense to apparate on the edge of town rather than inside where Salazar joined him. Someone had to keep Godric out of trouble after all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not wanting to be seen and since Godric did not look like he was going to make any move to do anything, Salazar cast a swift spell to cloak them from view. It would make eyes slide right over them, dismissing them. Salazar looked around grimly then, making observations. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Northmen,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he finally spoke, distaste evident in his tone. Ever since the run in with the man those several years ago, he had a disdain for dirty varmints. And, to him, the northmen certainly counted, never knowing how much his views would change one day. They had met a few that had settled down and farmed the land that were fascinating enough with their customs, their gods. But then… there were still tales of the raids against coastal villages and there was always the warring and feuds.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"There is not much that we can do, Godric,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he said at last with a frown, looking over the burning town. If there were any survivors, they were likely long gone. But before he could say anything more to persuade his friend into moving from the village, there was a sudden sharp scream. Godric was off in that direction before Salazar could stop him. Groaning in exasperation about how predictable Godric was, Salazar took off after his friend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Salazar rounded the corner, he found Godric defending a cowering young woman who had her back pressed against the crumbling wall behind her. She was covered in dirt and had tear tracks down her face while her blond hair was brown because of mud. Her pale blue eyes, a pretty colour like the sky, stood out against her pale face and were glittering with tears. Godric had somehow managed to get in front of her and was facing off against two northmen. The men were large in stature like giants, axes in hand, and only looked amused that a young man barely out of boyhood was trying to get in their way. They both dived at Godric and Salazar felt a sense of hopelessness flood him. Godric couldn't defend himself against two mundane men. Not like that at least. And he was too far away for him to be able to help his only friend. Without stopping to think, and acting on a hopeless wish to do anything to save his friend, Salazar's wand was out and he had it pointed towards one of the northmen. "Avada Kedavra!" He did not know what deep corner of his mind that the spell had come from, the very words making him feel dirty.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A dark, yet sickly, green light shot out of his wand and slammed into the nearest northman. Immediately, the man stiffened and fell to the ground. He lay unmoving with the sort of stillness that only the dead could achieve.nWith the distraction, Godric was able to knock out the remaining northman. But Salazar did not even notice, his wand clutched loosely in his trembling hand as he stared unseeing at the ground before him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He hadn't thought… it just came to mind… he hadn't known what it would do… he had just killed a man! Salazar's eyes filled with horror as he realized what he had done. He knew that the times didn't allow for a soft mind, but he had never killed a man before. At least not like this. This was deliberate, not an accident. It was too much to take as his vision swam. Suddenly then, the young girl that they had protected was standing in front of him. She seemed to sense the turmoil he was in and reached up to place her hands against his cheeks. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Thank you. You have saved my life," </em>
  </b>
  <span>she spoke gently, a small smile on her lips. She still looked frightened, but none of that terror was directed towards him. Salazar immediately felt his shoulders relax.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"I am Salazar."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He whispered then, his voice cracking briefly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Salazar Slytherin."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The young girl smiled at him and pulled her hands back. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Thank you, Salazar Slytherin."</em>
  </b>
  <span> She said again before looking over to Godric. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"And thank you. My name is Helga Hufflepuff."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>((Page Break))</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"You know, I still do not see why you would want to come along with us,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar suddenly remarked dryly as he twisted in his seat to look over at the only female of their group. Helga gave the teen a placating smile and adjusted her skirt.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"I do not have anywhere else to go, Master Slytherin,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> she cooed softly making Salazar cringe and then look away with a scowl. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Besides… Would you leave a woman defenseless after an attack such as that?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> She inquired with a gentle smile on her lips. But the look didn't fool Salazar, even though he wasn't looking in her direction. Helga was a strange woman. She was much different than the women of the time that Salazar had come to know. She also had a noble air about her, something she had apparently picked up after having been a servant in some lord's castle for a time. Or so she said. He wasn't quite sure he should believe her or not. Then there was the fact that she was a witch. Not a much trained one, but a witch nonetheless. Godric, of course, had taken it upon himself to teach the only female. Salazar had not participated in these lessons, not wanting to take away the time he had devoted to his own studying. Although, Salazar did have to admit that the girl was fairly talented when it came to herbs. Perhaps, he could allow her to take a look at the journal he was writing on magical herbs and plants. She just might have some input useful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a sigh though, the young man shook his head clear of his thoughts and looked back down along the path. After saving Helga, they had taken three abandoned horses from the village and had taken off. Salazar had thought that Helga's travelling with them would only last a few days, or until they had come across a village. But those days had passed and it found Helga still traveling with them. It didn't seem like the girl would be leaving anytime soon either.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After he spotted a clearing, Salazar reined in his horse and slid off the creature's back. He made his way towards the small stream that wound its way through the trees and crouched down to wet his hands. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We should rest here for a little while."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He said as he glanced over to Godric. The other male merely shrugged and quickly swung off of his horse's back. Salazar had to scowl a little at his friend's grace in how he did it. It was obvious that Godric had ridden horses plenty of times before. Salazar didn't know if he had ever done it, and if he had… well all that knowledge was long gone. He had to learn how to ride a horse the hard way and his bottom was still sore from the experience, even with a cushioning charm. Still, he kept his complaints to himself. Horses were valuable and certainly made their traveling easier, even if it was at the expense of his bottom.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"You know, Salazar… if you were more accepting and less grumpy, I might be more inclined to share my scrolls with you,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Helga's suddenly spoke as the the young man in question had scooped up some water from the stream to drink. He choked softly as he was startled out of his thoughts before he turned to look at the young girl with slightly reddened cheeks. He quickly cleared his throat and turned his head away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Scrolls? What do you mean, Helga?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He asked carefully, trying not to appear too eager. He could never pass up the chance to learn more. He glanced back at Helga secretly, gauging her expression.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The young girl had gained a triumphant look on her face much to his chagrin. The witch just couldn't hide her emotions at all, wearing them for all to see. "</span>
  <b>
    <em>My family were just simple commoners."</em>
  </b>
  <span> She passed off, but there was a smug tilt to her voice that had Salazar narrowing his eyes in suspicion. Helga quickly giggled and then continued to speak. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"But I also come from a wizarding pureblood family. So, I have a few scrolls that have been passed down,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> she told him eagerly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, Salazar was definitely interested now. Scrolls on family magic? That was what Helga had hinted at, and oh how he wanted to get his hands on them. Helga was still speaking, however. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Most commoners do not know how to read or write these days… but my father taught me."</em>
  </b>
  <span> She seemed proud of this. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Most purebloods know how to read, whether they are wealthy or not."</em>
  </b>
  <span> She was babbling on, but Salazar wasn't really paying attention anymore. He supposed he could be nicer to her… but doing it just to get his hands on the scrolls was too obvious. He would have to ease into it and not just start being nice to her all at once. But first…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"I suspect you are the daughter of a northman,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he said suddenly, his words cutting her off. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Or, at the least, you have some of their blood in your lineage. So, how do you have scrolls? It is, to my knowledge, that they do not own such things."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Helga puffed herself up with a huff</span>
  <b>
    <em>. "Yes, alright. My father was a northman. But several generations ago, my family was one of the first to settle in this land. My mother is more native to this country and it is through her family that the scrolls were passed down."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric, at the side, was watching all of this in amusement. He knew Salazar better than anyone, so he knew that the young man was planning something. Snorting in amusement, he shook his head before going to wash his face in the stream as well. As he washed his face, he called out to Salazar and made a vague motion before wandering off to relieve himself. Helga looked curious but Salazar merely rolled his eyes and diverted her attention by bringing out some food that they had brought with them. But as he was portioning the bread for them, a startled yelp had him stiffening and pulling out his wand in preparation for an attack. What he wasn't prepared for was Godric's panicked retreat towards them. The young man was trying to stuff his genitals back into his untied pants as he ran while an irate snake slithered behind him, snapping at his heels.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Helga shrieked beside him, a mixture of fear at the snake and indignation at the eyeful she had gained because of Godric. Putting his wand away, Salazar rolled his eyes and stepped forward. </span>
  <u>
    <span>"What has my friend done this time?"</span>
  </u>
  <span> He called out in Parseltongue, getting the snake to stop in its tracks. Godric hid himself behind Salazar, a movement that amused the black haired wizard greatly. But instead of commenting on the sudden lack of bravado, he turned his attention back to the snake that had coiled itself in front of him. The large black creature was hissing something about Godric trampling his nest. Salazar sighed and looked over to his friend who was holding onto him and whispering for him to get rid of the snake. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Stop that."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He said in irritation before looking back over to the magnificent serpent. </span>
  <u>
    <span>"My friend is a bumbling oaf, but he did not mean to damage your nest,"</span>
  </u>
  <span> Salazar tried to calm the still irate snake.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Finally, the creature seemed to realize that Salazar was talking to him and actually understood him. Slithering closer, the snake raised its head up higher. </span>
  <u>
    <span>"A speaker… I have never heard of such a thing before."</span>
  </u>
  <span> It said, observing Salazar with a calculating eye. Finally, he moved closer to Salazar and started to wrap around the wizard's leg. Climbing up until he was resting over Salazar's shoulders, the snake proceeded to make itself comfortable. </span>
  <u>
    <span>"I will come with you, Speaker,"</span>
  </u>
  <span> it decided</span>
  <span>. </span>
  <u>
    <span>"In payment for your… oaf having destroyed my nest."</span>
  </u>
  <span> Salazar supposed that there was going to be no changing the snake's mind. In truth, he didn't really mind. The snake was obviously magical otherwise it would not have been there in the country at all. He was curious about the creature.</span>

    <em>"It is going to eat you, Sal! Let me… let me take care of it!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Godric had pulled out his wand and had filled himself up with bravado once more in the face of the snake. In response, Salazar threw him a sharp glare and then petted the creature's head. Godric couldn't help but gape as he got the implied message. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"You cannot be seriously thinking about keeping it!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He cried out, looking indignant. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"It tried to kill me!"</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar glared again and then headed over to his horse. He climbed up onto the creature's back and looked down at his friend with a superior look. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"You trampled his nest."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He spoke shortly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"He was not trying to kill you. He was merely irritated that you had destroyed it with your bumbling around. He is the one who decided that he will come with me. Besides, he can talk to me and I think that this intrigues him. He will be staying."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He was not going to argue this with Godric and his friend knew that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So Godric merely started to grumble and walked over to his own horse. Helga was left feeling extremely out of place. She felt like she was missing something. Not to mention the fact that Salazar could apparently speak with snakes. Godric seemed to have already been aware as he had done his freaking out over the actual snake rather than his friend speaking with said creature. It was rather intriguing, but this was new to her. She had never heard of such an ability before. Climbing onto her own horse's back again, she watched the black haired wizard with a small frown. She didn't hate him for it and she didn't fear him… it was just strange. She knew he wasn't a bad person anyways. Rubbing her chest lightly over her heart, she quickly nudged her horse to catch up with the other two.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric continued to sulk as they rode while Salazar quietly hissed in conversation with his new pet.</span>

  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Godric, what did you do?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar's exasperated voice broke the relative silence. They were currently surrounded by guards, weapons pointed towards them. Helga stood in safety between Godric and Salazar, who faced away from each other.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"I did not do anything!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> The man's indignant voice called out. Said man had a hand on his sword, something he had stolen a while back from a blacksmith that they had come across in some unimportant village. Salazar had two knives hidden in sheaths on his forearms, but he didn't make any moves to grab them just yet. Over the year they had been traveling with Helga, the two men had taken up adding in physical combat to their duels. Godric had been learning how to handle a sword, tips he picked up along the way that built up on the foundation that he had learned in his childhood. Salazar had his own sword strapped at his side, a weapon he was slower to learn. Instead, he preferred his pair of knives that he had stolen from the same blacksmith. It served the man right anyways. The knives weren't flashy like Godric's sword was and more easily concealed, so it gave him a small edge.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar was about to grip his own sword when a new voice called out over the group. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"What is going on here?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> It was the voice of a young woman. When she appeared, Salazar had to guess that she was close to their age of seventeen. Well, Helga was roughly sixteen years old, but she figured she would be turning seventeen soon.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar took in the image of the young woman who had appeared. She was dressed in a fine blue dress and riding on a black horse. Her cloak was lined with fur, so it was apparent that she was rather well off. Dark grey eyes took each of them in, her black hair blowing in the light breeze. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Well?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> She spoke impatiently.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar looked over her with narrowed eyes and received a stern look in reply. Straightening, the black haired man tilted his head up. He would not cower beneath her gaze as he refused to think he was beneath her. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We were minding our own business when we were accosted in the road, my lady."</em>
  </b>
  <span> His voice, having deepened over the years, was smooth in tone. A light brushing of hair adorned his chin now and his black hair had grown out, held back now by a braid. It was much easier to take care of than the rat's nest it used to be. The scar that stretched over the side of his face in a jagged lightning strike - received in whatever accident had stolen his memories - had healed over by now, though still sometimes became raw around the edges. It always seemed to happen after dreams that left him sweating and he could never recall upon awakening.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He stood tall now, though still shorter than Godric's rather impressive height. The red haired man's hair was longer as well, though he kept it loose and it was still just as bright. Helga had started turning heads in villages they passed through, ever a ray of sunshine buy just as burning if provoked. It took quite a bit of provocation to spark her temper, but, oh, did it burn. Still, all of them retained the look of youth and one could tell that they were still young, so they made for an intriguing group.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>On the horse, the lady looked over to the guards who were surrounding the small ground. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"And what say you of this? What have they done to warrant such a response?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> She asked coolly, making the guards fidget slightly. Finally, one guard seemed to draw up his courage and accused of seeing one of the travelers perform magic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Exasperated, Salazar rolled his eyes. He could pick out exactly who had performed the magic. Godric had used a spell to fill his canteen. They hadn't thought anyone was around, but they had obviously been mistaken. Still, to be accused of magic was a serious thing. Besides the lady and the patrolling guards, there was no one else around. So, Salazar discreetly slipped his wand from its holster beside one of his names and quickly fired off a few obliviates. He was not expecting the sizzling spell that suddenly flew in his direction, but his reflexes were honed enough that he managed to duck so the spell whizzed harmlessly over his head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Frowning, he turned sharply to find that the lady had pulled out her own wand. Beside him, Godric had quickly knocked out the guards before they both faced the woman on horseback. Helga was tittering worriedly next to him, but he ignored her examination for injuries.</span>
  <b>
    <em>"I'm fine, Helga. My lady, you are…"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He cut himself short, not about to name her a witch out loud. Instead, he gave a quick shake of his head. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We truly have not done anything to harm anyone. If you let us go, we will be on our way. I apologize for any misunderstandings."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He spoke in a placating manner, spreading his hands slightly to show that they didn't mean any harm. Salazar had found that sometimes it was best to try to speak one's way out of things if one was uncertain of how other skills could help one along.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Who are you all?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> The lady demanded with a frown on her lips. Salazar didn't reply at first, his lips thinning slightly. But finally he relented and he introduced them. Surprisingly, Godric had remained relatively quiet for once and had followed his lead. Helga wasn't a surprise as she was a healer and not much of a fighter, though she continued to fret by his side.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The lady looked over the three of them before sliding out of her saddle in an elegant motion. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I am Lady Rowena Ravenclaw."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>((Page Break))</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Somehow, Salazar had to say that he saw this coming. However, Godric was very vocal about his reaction to Rowena's suggestion. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"You want to do what?!"</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sighing in a manner that said that she was exercising great patience, Rowena straightened out her skirt. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I want to build a school, Godric,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> She repeated lightly as she closed the hand written book in front of her. She then held up her hand before Godric could interrupt her again. Salazar had to hide a smirk at Godric's indignant look. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Listen to me for once, will you? Take a look at how all of you grew up. I know, Salazar, that you do not remember, but think of the other two. Godric, you were disowned because you are a wizard and had to travel from place to place with Salazar to manage to build the knowledge of magic that you possess. Helga, you come from a pureblood family, but did not have many resources readily available to you. It was all luck that we were all able to come together and were able to amass the knowledge that we have. Others of our kind have not been so lucky… think of the burnings." </em>
  </b>
  <span>Salazar's jaw tightened at that.</span>
  <b>
    <em> "We need to build a school where we can bring in students of all backgrounds to teach them. I know we are all young, hardly masters in our own right, but if we can at least pass on the basics to children then we have done what we can. We can still learn on our own anyhow."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In the end, it didn't take much to convince the others that it would be a good idea. Salazar was into the idea more because they would be able to stop running. He had enjoyed traveling, but he wanted to settle down for awhile and work on his magic. He wanted to work on his potions. Helga looked at him in amusement when he brought up these points. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"And you used to say that you would be no good at it,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> she teased him from her spot near the window. The group of them had been staying with Rowena for the past few months, though they had been originally planning to move on again. It seemed that those plans would be changing, though Salazar did not regret this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"I did use to be terrible with them,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar spoke tightly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I have a feeling… and a few very vague memories that suggest that I was very bad at them when I was younger. Perhaps because of a terrible teacher."</em>
  </b>
  <span> It was Helga and her knowledge of herbs and magical plants that helped make it click. She had been a very patient teacher with him until he could finally understand the properties better. From there Salazar had soaked up any knowledge of potion making that he could find, experimenting when he could, though the opportunities had been few and far between given the lack of a proper brewing station for the delicacies of certain ingredients.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Rowena smiled briefly before standing up. She then walked over to a little chest and pulled out a scroll. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"There is an old broch a few days' ride from here. My mother's family owned the land for generations, though it has been in my father's hands since her passing. I have been working on getting the rights to the grounds as my father has had little use for it, saying his home is here. It should not take me much longer, but if I can get it then that is where we can build our school. Wards and enchantments will need to be woven in, and there is plenty of room for expansion. The land includes parts of a forest and a loch, but the open grounds between are quite extensive on their own. The broch itself looks out over the loch."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was silence as the three others thought over the idea, exchanging wordless looks like an unspoken language. Helga was the first to smile and nod her head, a beaming smile overtaking her face. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I think it is a wonderful idea. I would like to designate an area specifically for healing! After all, there are bound to be injuries. Especially with the two of you as teachers!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> She teased the two males, making Salazar scowl lightly. Still, the man did see the merit of the idea and nodded his head in acceptance. Accidents were likely to happen and it was not going to be for lack of proper teaching skills.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric was silent for a while longer before he suddenly smirked. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Fine. I shall agree as well. But only if we call the school Hogwarts."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He looked smug, ignoring the incredulous look that Salazar shot him. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"What? I think it would be funny!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He stated and crossed his arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"We are not going to call the school Hogwarts."</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar hoped to whatever deity out there that the name would not stick. Who would want to go to a school named 'Hogwarts'? It sounded disgusting, not for a name of a school for small children. No, definitely not. The school would never be called Hogwarts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"I cannot believe that you are actually going to let him call the school Hogwarts,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar grumbled as they gathered in the entryway of the large keep. Just a few days ago they had finished with their necessary renovations. They were going to start weaving the spells for the wards soon, but were taking a break to replenish their magic cores. It had taken nearly a year of magic enhanced construction to finish the school. At least for the moment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The original building had been a singular old broch atop a hill. They had all agreed that it would not be enough. Rowena, being the farthest traveler, had described some large structures she had seen in the Duchy of Normandy and surrounding area. They had taken inspiration from this, making the land the broch sat on into a motte. The broch itself, an ancient tower with no windows and a singular door, had been rebuilt into a keep that housed their various classrooms as well as Rowena's library. The base of the keep housed an underground storeroom. Salazar had claimed this area instead for his potion making as it provided the perfect environment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Down from the keep, along stone steps set into the motte, led into the bailey. It was surrounded by a palisade they had built from stone rather than timber, wanting it to endure. Several towers had been built into the palisade, one of which housed the kitchens. In the bailey, the enclosed courtyard at the base of the motte, several buildings had been constructed. Near the entrance had been built a great hall with a soaring ceiling, a grand marvel that stood supported by magic. It would make for an impressive reception area and meeting space. There was also an infirmary for Helga.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Where they had all gathered in the keep to meet, Salazar gently stroked the head of Eolas, the snake that he had encountered all of those years ago. Eolas was now his familiar and could be seen with Salazar a good portion of the time. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We have already decided who will teach what classes, but where are we going to have the students sleep? There will be times in between classes and I will imagine that we will have them stay here for a majority of the year as well."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He had a small frown on his lips. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We will need to create dormitories."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric suddenly interrupted Salazar. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Why not build houses?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He said with a grin. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Or what I mean is, so we do not have to construct even more buildings, why not sort the students according to different attributes in their personalities? They will be with other students that are similar to them, so it will make it easier to adjust. I can take all the brave students."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He grinned proudly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I can watch over them. Salazar can take all of the cunning students…. And so on."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar let out a sigh. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Your idea has merit, I agree." </em>
  </b>
  <span>He frowned slightly before giving his friend a teasing look. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Time must be ending for Godric to actually have a good idea for once. Would you not agree, my brother?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He said before waving his hand slightly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We would need to carefully create an object to sort the students, but we can each have our own group, or House, like Godric said. We would have responsibility over one group, which will save us the trouble of all four of us having to look over the entire body of students. It also solves the dormitory problem. We can each pick a part of the school for our House to be in. There will be a common room and then the dormitory rooms themselves."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He ran his fingers over Eolas' head again. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"There is a tower near the base of the hill. I can easily construct a tunnel corridor from my potion rooms in the keep to the tower,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he said thoughtfully after a moment. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"My chambers will be nearby and easily accessible if needed then."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Helga looked positively enchanted. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I will take the kitchen tower,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> she giggled softly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"So then, it will be near my chambers as well."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The young woman then brightened then, giving a clap of her hands. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We should pick symbols for our Houses to tell them apart!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> She tapped her lip thoughtfully before smiling happily once more. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Yellow is my favorite colour, so I will choose that! Black will be a good compliment, I think. So black and yellow are my colours!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> She then looked thoughtful again, on a roll with her ideas. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"An animal to represent each House would be good as well, to add a bit of fun and have a sort of… guardian for our Houses." </em>
  </b>
  <span>She hummed softly.</span>
  <b>
    <em> "A badger! My House's animal will be the badger!"</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Smiling pleasantly at Helga's enthusiasm, Rowena nodded her head. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I shall have blue and bronze then, for my House. The Eagle will be my animal, of course. Not a raven. Do not be so obvious, Godric."</em>
  </b>
  <span> She gave the man a sly look from the corner of her eye when he opened his mouth to speak. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I think I will have the West Tower for my House."</em>
  </b>
  <span> She spoke at last before looking over to Godric. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"And what of you? Though I think we can all take a guess,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> she eyed in amusement as she eyed the lion head brooch on Godric's dark red cloak.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Smirking, Godric crossed his arms. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"East Tower, as it is the tallest and so has one of the best views in the entire school!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He spoke exuberantly, making Salazar sigh but smile fondly. Godric ignored him and continued speaking. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Colours. Well, red and gold, of course, as they are bright and bold! And a lion will be my House's animal, because they are brave and fierce!" </em>
  </b>
  <span>His deep voice boomed, his excitement too much to contain.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar decided he could only be amused. He shook his head fondly before he chuckled lightly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I suppose I shall take green and silver then. A snake will be my House animal."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He paused to stroke Eolas' scales once more. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I do not suppose I have to explain why, do I?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He raised an eyebrow, smirking slightly as he teased Godric. The red haired man rolled his eyes in response, but Salazar ignored him. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We have the four Houses then… Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Gryffindor."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He paused then as inspiration took hole. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We should have a competition. Doing well in class can earn points while getting in trouble can take points away. Whichever House has the most points at the end of the school term wins. It may give the students reason to want to do well and not get in trouble."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Prepare to be beaten, Slytherin!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Godric yelled playfull, as he already seemed to be set on the whole idea of a competition.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar did not even miss a beat. </span>
  <b>"I will not even have to try to overtake you, Gryffindor."</b>

<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Five years… it has been five years since I first met you, Godric."</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar was standing with the man in Godric's office, adjacent to his classroom in the keep. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Five years, but it seems like a lifetime."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He smiled slightly before smoothing out his tunic. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"The first of the children will be arriving tonight, as you know. I believe Rowena said it should be around dinner, so we will be having a feast to celebrate."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"And the feast I suppose was Helga's idea?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Godric interrupted, but Salazar only gave a small chuckle before nodding his head. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Cannot say that I am very much surprised, of course."</em>
  </b>
  <span> Godric passed off before leaning back in his chair slightly. He had a thoughtful look on his face. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We have all seen maybe nineteen years, but it amazes me to think that we are going to be teachers in a school of magic. We are by no means masters."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He shook his head, staring thoughtfully out of the small window.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Chuckling, Salazar walked over to his friend and leaned against the desk. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Perhaps not,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he said before waving a hand dismissively. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"But the children that we are going to teach are young. They will only need to know the basics, something that we all know very well. As they learn, so will we. We will each have a mastery before too long, I suspect. Rowena's library is slowly expanding more and more. I, myself, have been studying and experimenting in my free time."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric nodded his head before standing up. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Yes, I do suppose that you are right. We should get down to the great hall for lunch."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He smiled before leading his friend out of his office. The two then made their way down from the keep and through the courtyard to the hall. There, Godric took a pause to stare up at the ceiling. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Every time I see this, I cannot believe we managed such a feat. When we strove to bring a piece of enchantment to this place to awe visitors, I never would have thought that this would be the result."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar laughed and placed a hand on his friend's shoulder. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Thank Rowena and her books! It helped that there were the four of us weaving in the spells together. I do not think that we would have been able to succeed otherwise. The theory behind it is absolutely fascinating."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Snorting, Godric started his way back up to the front where Helga was already waiting. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Your thirst for knowledge is only surpassed by Rowena, my brother,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he said dryly before he took his seat.. Lounging back in his seat, he then looked out over the great hall. There were four long tables, each decorated in their different colours. Godric suspected that only the ends would be used for some time, but hopefully their school would expand in time. He greeted Rowena as he spotted her before he waited for her to be seated to start on his meal. For not knowing any of them more than a few years, he felt like he had a family with them. He wondered if it had been fate.</span>

<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p><b><em>"Could not sleep, brother?" </em></b><span>Godric's voice broke through the silence, though he luckily kept his tone low so the disruption was not shocking. Salazar barely flinched, hunched over the table. He did not respond to Godric as he massaged his temples and stared down at the parchments before him. </span><b><em>"Ah… headaches again?" </em></b><span>Godric's voice was sympathetic as he sat across from the black haired wizard. He reached forward then and took the parchments. </span><b><em>"What are these?"</em></b> <span>His tone was curious.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar continued to massage his temples and closed his eyes. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"My dreams," </em>
  </b>
  <span>he said quietly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"In them, I feel like I am staring out through a cloudy window. People are faceless and just out of reach. I catch snatches of these details there… I feel compelled to sketch them out."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric looked at them curiously. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Some look like Hogwarts. But so much… well, grander. So many different details." </em>
  </b>
  <span>Salazar shrugged, and pinched his nose.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Probably just an active imagination, dreams for the future of Hogwarts," </em>
  </b>
  <span>Salazar murmured.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Godric nodded absently as he flipped through the pages. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Lots of sleepless nights, I see." </em>
  </b>
  <span>He paused then, spying a drawing of a large chamber. It was decorated with large motifs of serpents and the statue of an ugly old man. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"What is this supposed to be? Seems sort of dramatic," </em>
  </b>
  <span>he said in amusement.</span>

    <em>"I have no idea."</em>

</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>(Salazar would not know that in merely a century, his journal would be discovered by then Headmistress Ailith Agnes Threston. His sketches would be referenced in the following centuries as Hogwarts expanded and as the castle became a wonder of various architectural examples throughout history.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The journal itself would become lost after it fell into the hands of Fulke Gaunt, a descendant of the Slytherin line. The Headmaster used the journal as a guide to build the Chamber of Secrets, believing the statue in the drawing to be of Salazar himself. Fulke Gaunt was disgraced as Headmaster not long after its completion. In bitterness, he left behind a basilisk in the chamber to be used one day to cleanse Hogwarts and protect the Slytherin legacy as he saw it. His descendents would go on to spread rumors of the Chamber and pass its secret onto further generations of Gaunts.)</span>

<p>
  <span>Classes were an exhausting endeavor, but well worth it in the end. It was rewarding to watch the children, who were the future of their world, grow and learn. The school had grown enough in its short amount of time, become known enough to gain a few more professors who were willing to come pass on their knowledge to the next generation. Some masters came and went, teaching for awhile but unwilling to become part of the more permanent staff.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Still, Salazar had decided to take on teaching two subjects himself. It was hard to juggle sometimes, but he found himself not minding this one bit. Most of the time they did not assign work to be done outside class or take written tests anyhow because many of the children did not know how to read or write. Rowena had taken it upon herself to teach literacy skills to those who needed it, but Salazar had also been meaning to ask her about adding in a class that would help mundane born students better adjust to magic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After he had stood from his desk after a potions' class, Salazar took his time to clean up. He had another class to get to, after all. It was in a separate classroom from his potions' class for reasons of safety. The young wizard made his way out of the classroom then and locked the door behind him. After a quick stop by his office, he grabbed a few things before he headed up further into the school's keep. His next class was Dark Arts and Defense of them. Dark Arts was his next passion besides Potions. Technically, he could be considered a dark wizard now though he still had more leanings towards Neutral. He had long since learned that with most magic it was the intent behind magic that made it either good or evil. Well, so to speak. He was lucky his friends felt the same as his hunger to learn had no bounds. And he felt that to best teach Defense against Dark Arts, it was to understand the Dark Arts.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So, he taught the Dark Arts along with defense against them and Godric was the one who took the lighter spells along with their defense. They all agreed that it was best to teach the children in a controlled environment and to keep them well rounded. They would keep the children safe and try to give them the tools they needed to grow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Professor Slytherin!"</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A voice broke through his thoughts and Salazar looked up to see one of his students running towards him. With a frown twisting his lips, he stopped to let the boy catch up. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Master Everett?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He asked while taking in the boy's worried look. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"What is it?"</em>
  </b>
  <span> The young boy looked out of breath as he bent over slightly to take in great lungfuls of air.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Professor, you have to come quick! Jameson… Jameson is on top of the tower…"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He trailed off, but Salazar got the gist of it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Follow me,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he spoke curtly before going over to one of the nearby walls. After he had placed a hand against the cool stone, he hissed softly beneath his breath. In a few seconds a door had slid open where there was once a seamless wall. Salazar quickly strode through; making sure that the Everett boy followed after him. The secret passage, available only to him because of the parsel magic involved, led them straight to the Slytherin Tower much like portal would. Without a moment to lose, he strode quickly to the door and opened it to find one of his students standing on the edge while he prepared to jump.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he weighed his options, Salazar crept closer and held out a hand. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Jameson? Come here, son." </em>
  </b>
  <span>He spoke softly and kept his expression calm. However, the frightened boy only yelled at him to stay back. He did not want to push the boy over the edge, both literally and figuratively, so he stopped his advance but continued to hold out his hand. He could summon the boy, but he wanted Jameson to step back on his own. It would be better for the boy. He would use his magic only for last resort. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Come here, Jameson. Tell me what had happened,"</em>
  </b>
  <span> he tried again as he kept a soothing tone to his voice. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Tell me what is wrong."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jameson looked over his shoulder before looking back over the side of the tower. The boy then wiped at his eyes. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I am a freak."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He finally said, </span>
  <b>
    <em>"My parents said so… All the magic…"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He wiped at his eyes again, sniffing. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"They let me come here reluctantly when they found out I have magic. But… but they will not want me back… I just know it! I am a freak…"</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar frowned at the boy's jumbled rambling. He could only guess that the stress of learning must have gotten to the poor child. If he remembered correctly, and based on the way the boy was talking, Jameson was mundane born. "</span>
  <b>
    <em>Jameson, you are not a freak. Magic is special." </em>
  </b>
  <span>He soothed as he carefully edged forward while he tried to not spook the boy. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"If your parents do not like it, then we can become your family. Professor Godric was disowned… but look at him, a professor and a founder of this school. You are safe here. You can protect yourself."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He carefully reached out for the boy. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Come on down, Jameson. Let us go see the house elves and have them warm up some milk for you."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He smiled encouragingly then as the boy turned around slightly, looking unsure. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"That is right. Come on… I can help you."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jameson reached out a hand to Salazar finally, but his foot slipped on the wet stone from the previous night's rainfall. The boy let out a piercing scream as he flailed and tumbled over the edge. A string of rushed parseltongue passed from Salazar's lips as he gave a startled curse and he threw himself to the edge. His wand was in his hand without thought and he cast a wordless levitating charm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Immediately, Jameson's descent halted and he hovered briefly in the air before Salazar carefully dragged him back up with the spell. As soon as the boy's feet touched solid ground once more, Salazar gathered the sobbing child into his arms. He grit his teeth and made a promise to himself then and there. None of his students, the children in his House, would have to go through what Jameson had. He would be the support they needed if they could not get it anywhere else. His House would become a family, relying on themselves if they couldn't rely on anyone else.</span>

  <b>
    <em>"I am sorry, Salazar. Truly. There is nothing that we can do."</em>
  </b>
  <span> Rowena shook her head sadly, watching the man in front of them. Three years had passed since they had opened their school and many students had entered. There was even a thriving wizarding village which had set up not too far from the school grounds, named Hogsmeade. Currently, Salazar was trying to get the other founders to help him with one of his students. The young boy had been abandoned and now had no place to go. It had happened before to several other students, but they had been lucky enough to have other families willing to take them in, or have other families that were willing to adopt them. Thankfully, it did not happen often. However, this young boy had no one.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Finally, Salazar straightened up and sneered slightly. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Fine. If you are not willing to help me, then I will figure something out on my own."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He turned abruptly, his emerald cloak flaring out behind him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Salazar! That was not…!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> Godric's voice was cut off as the door slammed behind him. Sighing, Godric slumped back in his seat. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I do want to help."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He murmured under his breath, raising a hand to rub the stubble on his cheek. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"But there really is nothing… no one will take him in!"</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Helga reached over and placed a hand on Godric's arm. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We know. But the boy's situation is so close to his own… he cannot help but feel for the boy. You know that."</em>
  </b>
  <span> She then sighed and pulled her hand back. "</span>
  <b>
    <em>Although… Salazar has changed as of late."</em>
  </b>
  <span> She frowned slightly. "</span>
  <b>
    <em>It is all of the burnings, I am afraid. We are all affected by it… but to suggest that we take away mundane born children from their families? We cannot do that. It is a difficult situation."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The others nodded in response, though none of them said anything. They did do what they could, but there was little else they could do. Godric suspected that it was because many of the mundane born students went to Slytherin that Salazar was so affected. The man saw more than anyone else what it did to the children to be told that they were evil. Salazar and his House took in those children and taught them how to survive. He was glad that the man had taken it upon himself, but he feared for his friend. What if Salazar saw one thing too far? One day… maybe he would begin to hate the mundane. The little bit of doubt took root in his mind against his will.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>…</span>
</p>
<p><span>Back at the tower, Salazar stormed into his chambers. There was only one thing left he could do… adopt the boy himself. So he stalked into his library and</span> <span>locked himself in to research the ritual he would need. He had seen references before so he just needed to find it again. When he did find it, hours later, Salazar immediately gathered the needed ingredients before he summoned the boy to his work room. The twenty-two year old founder would not be swayed in his decision; he did not contact his friends first. Perhaps it was reckless foolishness that he so often playfully accused Godric of, but he was determined to save Cayden.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Cayden was maybe fifteen years old at the most. He had been one of the few special cases that the founders had accepted in the recent year. Before Hogwarts, Cayden hid all signs of his magic. However, his parents had eventually found out and Cayden almost died before Salazar had come upon him during one of his travels to find magical children. He knew Cayden looked up to him and he was fond of the eager young man who was so desperate to learn all he could of magic. In some ways, Cayden reminded him of the way he had been just a few short years ago. Seven, to be exact, since he had woken with no memories of before.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Cayden."</em>
  </b>
  <span> Salazar greeted the boy warmly when he appeared. Bringing the boy closer, he hugged him briefly before staring him firmly in the eyes. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I want to help you. But you are going to have to trust me."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He told Cayden before explaining to him that he was going to adopt him into the Slytherin family. They were too close in age to get away with a father and son bond, but Salazar could adopt him as his brother. As a result, he wouldn't have to go back to his family and he would gain Salazar's Parsel abilities, along with the man's name.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In the end, Cayden agreed to the ritual and he became Cayden Slytherin, brother to Salazar Slytherin.</span>

<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Salazar Slytherin, you are hereby banished from Hogwarts."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The words seemed to echo unnecessarily in the suddenly silent hall. They were words that he never wanted to hear, let alone from the mouth of his best friend and brother. Had ten years meant nothing to him? Their school was flourishing, but it was far from perfect. Why would he be banished? No, that was wrong… he thought he understood why.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Godric, please…"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He tried, but the man only hardened off his expression and clenched his jaw.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"No."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The man stood from his spot at the staff table, cutting off any protests from the dark haired wizard. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"We should have never let you teach the Dark Arts to the children. So, you are banished from Hogwarts for fostering the dark arts and hatred towards mundanes in these halls. You must leave before sundown tomorrow. That is the only allowance we give you."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The man then sat back down while he ignored the hurt look that was so painfully stretched across Salazar's face. Rowena looked pained, but she hid it behind a stern mask and her inability to look Salazar in the eye. Helga looked the most affected, tears in her eyes. She was looking down at her lap and refused to meet Salazar's eyes as the man searched them beseechingly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Finally, Salazar gathered himself up after feeling he had made a fool of himself in front of the whispering student body. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Fine. So be it," </em>
  </b>
  <span>he whispered before he turned on his heel, barely restrained hurt radiated from his body as he stalked away. His entire House stood up and hurried after their Head without his direction. He led them to their tower and, once they were in their common room, they crowded around him. They all seemed so lost to him, their expressions searching him for what to do now. As he kept his emotions tightly reined in, Salazar drew them in close. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"You cannot trust anyone."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He told them. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Look where it got me… You can only trust yourselves. You are a family. The other Houses do not understand and they may ridicule you for having a banished Head. Stand strong together, my Snakelings."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He looked around at all of the young faces. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I am so proud of you all. Do not let anyone tell you anything different."</em>
  </b>
  <span> He reached out to touch the cheek of one of the boys. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"If you need anything, any of you… do not be afraid to seek out the help of your fellow students. Slytherins stick together. Remember that."</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar gave a final goodbye to his students before he disappeared to his rooms nearby. The tower was built into the side of the cliff and the common room descended down into the rock. He had constructed a window to see into the depths of the loch. The tower above the underground common room is what housed the bedrooms for his students. His chambers were on the same floor as the common room entrance, though did not drop down as far.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In his rooms, he did not bother to gather any of his things. He had a day, did he not? Instead, he gathered his cloak and left after sealing his room. The door disappeared into the stone as if it had never been there. He touched the stone briefly before he turned on his heel to stalk down the corridor. He exited the tower and strode across the courtyard with purpose. He exited the school through the imposing gates while he avoided the great hall. Down across the flying bridge he walked and to the grounds' gates. The trip did nothing to soothe the squeeze around his heart. With a final look back, he disapparated from his spot.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When he reappeared, he stood in the middle of a large field. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Cayden!"</em>
  </b>
  <span> He called out, knowing that his brother could hear him. His little brother, the one that he had taken in those two years ago, had betrayed him. He had taught him just like he had taught all of his other students. But Cayden had been closest to him, the one he had taught parselmagic after he had gained his parsel abilities. But as soon as he had graduated a few months before, Cayden had disappeared. Rumors of mundanes being hunted by magic had arisen not long after. It had arisen tension in the school. Then Cayden had visited him, bright eyed and longing to share his grand scheme. Salazar rebuked him and Cayden had not taken kindly to it. Even so, the Slytherin founder had felt so betrayed… he had not taught Cayden and taken him in just so he could become a murderer. If he was to be banished from his home, the least he could do for now was to confront his younger brother.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>"Big brother."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The words cut through Salazar's thoughts and the twenty five year old man turned to face the younger Slytherin. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Have you finally come to join me? You know as well as I do just how filthy mundanes are… they do not understand. They are afraid of us… but we, we are so much better than them. They do not deserve to live!" </em>
  </b>
  <span>Cayden's eyes glowed with madness and it twisted Salazar's heart to see it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He suspected that it was the teen's treatment as a young child that had fostered this belief. He should have recognized it before now. How blind had he been? How many things had he missed or willfully ignored not wanting to believe it? It was true that he was not altogether too fond of mundanes, but they were human, too. They did not deserve to die just because they did not understand magic. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"Give this up, Cayden," </em>
  </b>
  <span>he said soothingly while he carefully slipped his wand into his hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The other founders would blame him for Cayden, he knew. Truthfully, he blamed himself as well. He should have noticed, should have done more. He should have stopped Cayden before he could start this war. So many should haves and could haves. It would just be another reason why they would feel justified in throwing him out. After all, how much of Cayden's work was because of a misuse of the Dark Arts? He half wondered if maybe the others thought he had sent the boy out to kill on his orders.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But this was not the time for such thoughts, so he shook them off and raised his wand. </span>
  <b>
    <em>"I did not come to join you, Cayden. I came here to stop you. And if that means killing you, then so be it."</em>
  </b>
  <span> The madness in Cayden would not be easily tamed and he might already be too far gone. Salazar knew that the others would not allow him to return to Hogwarts, but at the very least he could take care of the threat to the peace. Maybe he would even die in the process. At that moment, he found he didn't really care. Whispering a spell, he initiated the duel.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Salazar did not want to fight the brother he had trained, brought under his wing. He had given Cayden Family Magic and had given him a home. But the madness Cayden had hidden, that Salazar had been blind to see, ran deep. As Cayden's elder brother, it was now his responsibility to correct what had happened.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He had taught Cayden well, but the boy was still young and reckless. Even Slytherin's could be reckless after all, they just tended to hide it better. Salazar too had grown used to dueling with the other founders. He was a more well rounded dueler than Cayden. Still, it took a lucky shot to bring the young man down. And with it, Salazar fell to his knees beside his brother. He reached out to Cayden then in his grief. But, as his fingers neared the young man's cheek, a spark like that of electricity jumped between them. It spread a searing pain through him as the gathered magic sought an outlet.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Cayden had been gathering the magic necessary for a dark spell and had been interrupted in the middle of it. With the lingering energy in the air from residual spells, Salazar became the epicenter as it all mixed into a chaotic cocktail. As it surged through him, Salazar slipped into darkness.</span>

    <span>As a last note: I know some of you will ask about the changes to the castle. I was doing some research and found this: It's generally accepted that the school was founded in roughly 990AD. However, castles didn't come to the Isles until, at the earliest, during the late 11th or early 12th century. Even then, they weren't the grand soaring pieces of art that Hogwarts Castle is. Put me in a bit of a conundrum as I'm trying to keep things as historically accurate as I can without overwhelming myself. I did what I could, though I still smudged things a bit. Just one of those details we tend to not think about really.</span>
