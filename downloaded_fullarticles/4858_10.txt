    <p>Harry groaned and snuggled further into Fabian's side as the alarm went off, and he was aware of the sound of someone in the kitchen downstairs. And the sound of a lot of people. Fabian grumbled and held him closer, burying his face into Harry's shoulder.</p><p>"I don't want to move," Harry groaned snuggling even further into Fabian's chest and flopping down.</p><p>"I don't want you to move either," Fabian hugged him closer and huffed.</p><p>"I don't know if I can do this Fabian," Harry admitted softly, pressing his face into his husband's shoulder.</p><p>"Harry," Fabian ran his fingers through Harry's dark hair and pressed a kiss to his temple. "I do not want you to leave me, I do not want to let you go. But I know that you can do this, <br/>you are one of the strongest people that I know, everything that you have been through, it is one year, I know you can do this,"</p><p>"I will miss you," Harry sighed.</p><p>"And I you, but I will be waiting for you tonight, and I will take you to Hogwarts. We will face this together, and if you need me, all you need is to come home and I will be straight there,"</p><p>"I know, and I would not be able to do it without you,"</p><p>"Yes you would, but I will be there anyway," Fabian laughed lifting his chin to kiss him.</p><p>"I want to stay here in your arms," Harry sighed.</p><p>"Don't tempt me," Fabian laughed tugging Harry underneath the covers and captured his lips again. Giggling into the kiss harry wrapped himself around his older husband and <br/>surrendered himself to the kiss, allowing himself to be distracted from the thoughts of the rest of the day. "How about we go shower and enjoy some...alone time before we face the <br/>day?" Fabian grinned.</p><p>"That husband mine, sounds like a very good idea!" Harry said before grabbing Fabian's hand and dragging him from bed.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Molly pottered around putting the last touches to breakfast before turning and levitating it to the table. She really did love Fabian and Harry's kitchen, and while before Fabian had not really had it running to its full potential, Harry had seen to it that it was working faultlessly now. It was good to see the two of them so happy as well, honestly she had seriously hoped knowing the two of them so well that they would fall in love, but even she had not dreamt that it would happen so fast, or so deeply. They really were perfect for each other.<br/>She smiled at those already around the table though Ron was looking a little grumpy about being up so early, but it was important that he was ready for his first day back at school, and Merlin knew he would forget everything if she did not make sure he was awake in plenty of time for his brain to start functioning properly. George, Arthur and Remus were all seated around the table, eagerly awaiting breakfast.</p><p>"Where is Sirius, I thought he was up already?" Molly frowned.</p><p>"He is, he wondered off a little bit ago, I think he is still pouting over how everything has turned out, even if he is happy about it, and he is pouting that Fabian 'abducted' Harry last night," Remus grinned clearly amused.</p><p>Before anyone else could say anything however there was a loud scream from upstairs followed by an almighty crash and some shouting.</p><p>"Oh Merlin, Ginny are you alright?! Did that beastly puppy trip you again?!" Molly shouted hurrying to the stairs.</p><p>"Erb zab wabnt be," Ginny poked her head out of the downstairs bathroom with her toothbrush sticking out her mouth. "An Ib donb scream zab girly,"</p><p>"Sirius," Remus groaned covering his eyes momentarily before running up the stairs. Harry and Fabian were tugging towels around themselves looking embarrassed and annoyed <br/>equally. And Sirius was lying on the floor with a corner table lying knocked over next to him with the vase that had been on it lying smashed on the floor.</p><p>"I did not need to ever see that in my entire life!" Sirius moaned.</p><p>"Maybe if you tried knocking, or you know not just barging into other people's bathrooms you might not see something you don't want to!" Fabian snapped.</p><p>"You shouldn't be doing things like that anyway! Not when you have other people in the house!"</p><p>"Merlin Sirius that's why we had a locking charm and silencer on the door! I love you but you are not staying over if you keep barging into rooms!" Harry groaned.</p><p>"But you shouldn't be doing it!" Sirius whined.</p><p>"You are such a cockblock Sirius!" Harry snapped spinning and storming towards the bedroom. "And Cavall is not a beastly puppy!" He added before slapping the door.</p><p>"I did not need to hear those words coming from his mouth," Sirius groaned.</p><p>"He is a little stressed right now...which was the idea of the shower. I will go calm him down," Fabian grinned before turning and hurrying after his husband, leaving the other staring a little bemused after him.</p><p>"I can't believe you thought that was me screaming," Ginny huffed.</p><p>"How high pitched is your scream!" Fred snickered.</p><p>"You have no idea what I saw! Things a godfather's eyes should never have seen...they were...he was...it was in...I was..." Sirius stammered before dropping his head back to the floor. "Remi obliviate me!" He pleaded.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>"Hey," Fabian lay down on top of Harry where he was sprawled on the bed.</p><p>"I am so embarrassed I can't believe he walked in on us," Harry groaned embarrassed.</p><p>"I think he was just as mortified as you were," Fabian snickered pressing a kiss to Harry's bare shoulder.</p><p>"I doubt that," Harry huffed.</p><p>"I don't think there was any reason to snap at him on top of the torture of him seeing that," Fabian snickered. "What was that?" He asked when Harry muttered something into their covers where his face was buried.</p><p>"I said I am still horny too!" Harry huffed lifting his head and glared into the glittering eyes of his husband.</p><p>"Well now, that I can help with," Fabian smirked.</p><p>Harry gasped when his towel was lifted and Fabian rubbed his still hard erection against Harry's bum before he slipped his hand between his thighs and gently parted them. Harry panted into the covers, arching up into his husband eagerly as Fabian slid into him.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>"Do you have everything? All ready to go?" Molly fussed. Fabian rolled his eyes and wrapped his arm around Harry's shoulder, pressing a kiss to his cheek. Harry had gotten quieter and quieter as the morning had gone on, even after Sirius had apologised, grumpy as it had been, and they had chatted a little over breakfast. Sirius shot him a look over the heads of the others now, one he knew the meaning of, look after Harry. Though it was not like he would do anything else.<br/>This was going to be an interesting meeting, they all knew that, just as they knew that Fabian was the only one that could be there beside Harry fighting his side against Dumbledore. Interesting was not the half of it.</p><p>"Ok, everyone off we go then, Harry, we will see you next week ok?" Molly kissed Harry's cheek and pulled him in for a tight hug. "Look after him, yes?" she said softly as Fabian was distracted by saying goodbye to Ron and Ginny.</p><p>"Always," Harry smiled pulling her in for another hug.</p><p>"Well uncle Harry we will see you soon," Fred grinned.</p><p>"And we thought you would like to know, that..."</p><p>"...in honour of your moving over here, we are looking at..."</p><p>"...Opening a shop here in Paris!"</p><p>"Why would Harry be interested in that specifically?" Gideon asked.</p><p>"Why, because he is our sponsor!" They chimed together before apparating out with a pop, leaving Harry to smile sheepishly at Molly when she turned to him with sharp eyes.</p><p>"You gave the twins money?" Fabian asked.</p><p>"Erm actually I gave them the money that they needed to start up the shop and they made me a silent partner in their shop, and any shops that they open in the future. They had a <br/>contract written up and everything before I could do anything about it," Harry sighed.</p><p>"I wondered who they wanted that contract for!" Bill huffed.</p><p>"Hm," Molly huffed.</p><p>"Are you angry?" Harry asked sheepishly, edging Fabian a little in front of him.</p><p>"Had this been two years ago, I may have been. However they have proved that I was wrong and ae doing well, and they are doing something that they love...so no I am not angry, I <br/>am glad that you saw the potential in them that I did not," Molly smiled.</p><p>"Honestly, the money was from the Triwizard tournament. It didn't feel right keeping it, and I reckoned that we all could do with the laugh, I knew that the twins would be able to make that happen, even in the times I knew were due to come," Harry smiled.</p><p>"Awww," Gideon cooed wrapping his arms around Harry.</p><p>"Oh Merlin's beard, you outdid us at 14! You managed to help create a joke shop that build zonkos!" Sirius blinked, looking prouder than Harry had ever seen him.</p><p>"I have helped them with a couple of ideas as well," Harry admitted.</p><p>"A couple," Ron coughed.</p><p>"A few," Harry glared at his friend not wanting to push his luck with Molly.</p><p>"We need to get going. I will speak to you tonight Harry, Fabian about how it goes, come on everyone shake a leg!" Molly clapped her hands and shuffle started.</p><p>Harry waved as they all huddled around the portkey in their garden before they popped out, to land straight at the portkey spot in Kings Cross. He had most of the day before he would floo over to the Three Broomsticks with Fabian and walk up to Hogwarts with him to face Dumbledore together. He blinked and turned when Fabian pecked him on the lips.</p><p>"Stop over thinking. Come on, lets take Cavall out for a walk,"</p><p>"I had better get back to work," Gideon sighed.</p><p>"Say hello to Victoria and the kids for us, we are seeing you at the weekend right?" Harry asked hugging his brother in law.</p><p>"Yes we will be here," Gideon squeezed Harry tight but said nothing as he turned to say goodbye to the others.</p><p>"Are you coming Siri?" Harry asked as he summoned Cavall's lead to himself.</p><p>"Oh, yes of course," Sirius beamed. Harry grinned and wandered off to get his and Fabian's coats, leaving Sirius, Remus and Fabian looking a little awkwardly at each other.</p><p>"Look Sirius, we have been friends for years, this is a little silly. I am not trying to replace you!" Fabian sighed after flicking a silencing spell at the door to make sure Harry didn't hear this.</p><p>"I don't think you are trying to, or that you will be able to!" Sirius huffed crossing his arms making Remus and Fabian both roll their eyes.</p><p>"Yes you do, that is what you at worried about. However Harry and I have a very different relationship to the one you and he have. He will always need you for advice and for someone to go to," Fabian assured him.</p><p>"He has you!" Sirius snapped.</p><p>"I am his husband, yes he will come to me for some things, but not everything. Sirius I know that you did not really exact you to have a...full and proper marriage, but that is what I was looking for and you knew that, I wanted to settle down with a husband, have a home. We were compatible was always a chance, as it happened we were a lot more compatible than we expected,"</p><p>"I trusted you!"</p><p>"And I haven't hurt him. Sirius I know that being faced with the reality of our relationship has been a shock...but he is happy, he smiles and he laughs, he feels safe here and at home. He knows I love him with all that I have and that I never, ever want to hurt him, that if he asked me to I would go to the moon and back for him. What more could I do to <br/>prove it to you?" Fabian asked.</p><p>"Nothing...I just...I never got to have time with him when he was a little boy, and now he is a teenager and that has really already passed because of everything that he has had to go through. I am just a little jealous," he admitted.</p><p>"You have nothing to be jealous of, Harry still wants you here, in his life and so do I,"</p><p>"Everything ok?" Harry asked stepping into the kitchen a second later before Sirius could reply, eyeing their serious faces suspiciously.</p><p>"Everything is fine, just your godfather and husband being dramatic," Remus rolled his eyes and spelled the harness and lead onto a bouncing Cavall.</p><p>"The normal then?" Harry asked brightly linking arms with Remus.</p><p>"The normal," The werewolf nodded.</p><p>"Hey!" Fabian and Sirius huffed hurrying after the two of them with pouts.</p><p>Harry laughed and carried on walking, ignoring the growing sense of foreboding of meeting tonight with Dumbledore. Instead he breathed in the fresh air of his home and listened to the voices of the people he loved, the barking of his dog, and just allowed it to soak into him like sunshine, enjoying his day and not allowing that man to ruin anymore of his time than he had to.</p>
