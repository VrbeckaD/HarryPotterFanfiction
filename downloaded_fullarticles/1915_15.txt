    <p align="center">BEFORE</p><p>To say that Mr Greengrass was surprised when Theodore Nott Jr. appeared at his door would not be entirely true. He was not the first Pureblood gentleman to visit the Greengrass Manor, nor would he be the last. It was known that the eldest Greengrass daughter was now of age and with political unrest ongoing, alliances were quickly being made.</p><p>It was peculiar in only one respect - the Nott family were not on the best of terms with the Greengrass family. No one quite knew why though the dislike was said to have originated with a financial dispute in the 1500s.</p><p>“Mr Nott?” Mr Greengrass frowned, quite understandably, but Mr Nott simply offered his hand, which Mr Greengrass shook bemusedly as a roll of parchment was placed on the desk between them.</p><p>        “I would like to make a proposal to join our two noble Houses. My father would see to this himself but unfortunately he is indisposed.”</p><p>This Mr Nott was concise, withdrawn, measured with his words. A little like his father.</p><p>Mr Greengrass put on his glasses and cast his eyes over the contract.</p><p>It was generous. The dowry was relatively small, the Nott fortune was large. It would be a sensible financial decision. He’d be foolish to turn it down.</p><p>“Why my daughter?”</p><p>        “I’m sorry sir,” Mr Nott looked at him with no decipherable expression on his face.</p><p>“With a fortune such as yours comes the privilege of choice. Why choose my daughter?”</p><p>        “I esteem your daughter to be good-natured and well-bred.”</p><p>“Hardly remarkable qualities.”</p><p>        “I disagree,” Mr Nott fixed him with piercing eyes. They were oddly compelling and decidedly different to his father’s. His mother had had eyes like that. He wondered for a moment if Mr Nott knew he bore her likeness. If this was why, perhaps, that Mr Nott Sr. rarely spoke of his son.</p><p>He hoped that this young man would be a better husband this his father. He seemed sensible and from what Mr Greengrass knew, quite detached from the Dark Lord’s following at Hogwarts. That could only be a good thing for his beloved Daphne. She deserved more than he had power to give her but in times such as these…</p><p>There were worse men than Theodore Nott, he supposed at last.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Daphne Greengrass.</p><p>An elegant (and eligible) lady. Of course her blood was pure as pure, not that he could have accepted anything less. <em>Only the best for a Nott</em>, so his father always said. He wondered what his father would have said had he known his daughter-in-law would be a Greengrass. The thought made the society wedding worth the trouble.</p><p>The wedding was gaudy and tasteless, everything his father hated. She, however, was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. She seemed delicate from where he was standing, and still very young. They were both young. Not that that seemed to count for anything.</p><p>He watched her as she moved easily between guests, effortlessly making conversation. She was generous with her smiles, relaxed and everything he wasn’t. They were so different, and he felt certain this was what the guests were remarking upon as they cocked their heads in confusion at the unlikely union.</p><p>How could a lady like Daphne Greengrass marry a man like him?</p><p>But a lady like Daphne Greengrass was exactly the sort of lady he had to marry if he had ambitions to survive the war (and he did). He needed someone Pureblood, obviously, but also someone society would love – not caught up in unfortunate familial allegiances, someone sociable and charming who would say all the right things to the right people at the right time, someone who had a large network of connections, unfailingly polite…</p><p>Ladies like that were not in abundance, and thus were in high demand. He knew the Greengrass family had never been particularly adept at balancing finances, so he made an offer he knew they couldn’t afford to refuse. What self-respecting Pureblood family would take so little in dowry? Daphne Greengrass wasn’t without admirers, but unfortunately for her those admirers were also in search of greater fortune.</p><p>If things were different, he thought, he would do things properly. He would find a girl he esteemed, and he would court her until he was sure he liked her, then he would marry her and fall in love. If things were different, he wouldn’t care about blood purity, heirs, money, war, power – none of it.</p><p>What did this girl want? With her soft blonde hair and blue eyes, she was like a princess from a storybook. Was he to be her prince? Perhaps she didn’t want a prince. Perhaps she did. Daphne Greengrass was a stranger to him. Though everyone marries a stranger, don’t they?</p><p>He supposed that there were worse women than Daphne Greengrass.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>When, all those years ago, young Theodore Nott had asked for her hand, she had been confused. Theodore Nott was just so aloof, so cold and so serious. Why on earth would he want to choose <em>her</em> for his bride? She, who was talkative and warm and completely vacuous because everybody knows women ought not to concern themselves with <em>serious</em> things, <em>for goodness sake Daphne put that book down, how am I ever to have grandchildren if you purposefully drive all the men away?</em></p><p>Theodore Nott was rich – that was a fact. He was also ambitious and extremely clever. She admired that. She’d admired him – with his sharp edges and those eyes, there was something of a mystery about him. And mystery was something of an alluring quality, if the novels she most certainly did not entertain herself with were to be believed.</p><p>She’d been trained and coached up to this role all her life. She could organise dinner parties at the drop of a hat, knew every Ministry man (and woman) worth knowing, was incredibly well read (despite best efforts from her governess to make it otherwise), fluent in several languages, could play the piano, knew how to dance, and had impeccable manners. (One could hardly be a lady without such qualities, her mother had often remarked.)</p><p>Being A Wife (she had always imagined it capitalised) was the only worthwhile occupation, according to her mother. Her mother had married her father just a week after she came of age. He was not much older. Whilst they did not love each other, they remained in union with sweet indifference towards each other to this day.</p><p>Daphne, however, had fancifully yearned for more. She didn’t just want a Manor, she wanted a home. She didn’t just want a husband, she wanted a partner, a lover. She didn’t just want heirs, she wanted children. She wanted a family.</p><p>Now she laughed at the idea. In this world? There was little chance of that. She was lucky she wasn’t on the streets, forced to become some wretched courtesan for the Lords in the upper circle. <em>The Prophet</em> served as a reminder for that. Living with a power-hungry acolyte of the Dark Lord in this essentially post-apocalyptic world may not be the fairy-tale she had envisioned, but there were worse men than Theodore Nott.</p><hr/><p>“A Mr Rowle for you, sir,” his servant said, bowing before leaving.</p><p>Theodore Nott Jr. looked up from his papers and eyed the man before him with distaste.</p><p>“Good evening, Lord Nott, sir.”</p><p>        “Good evening, Mr Rowle,” he drew out the man’s surname with an elongated drawl. Maybe this would be fun. “What can I do for you?”</p><p>“My family’s been loyal servants to the Dark Lord for generations, sir –”</p><p>        “Your service is most commendable.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir. Our blood is pure – I can assure you, sir, and we have united many ancient families over the years, sir, like my recent marriage to Miss Druella Blishwick –”</p><p>        “Congratulations, Mr Rowle, on your nuptials.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir. You see, sir, we’ve been in his Dark Lordship’s circle for many years –”</p><p>        “A coveted privilege, Mr Rowle.”</p><p>“It is, sir, which is why I’m asking for your Lordship’s assistance.”</p><p>Theo cocked his head to the side, contemplating Rowle. “What is it exactly that you want? And please, be succinct about it, I haven’t got all night.”</p><p>“Of course not, sir,” he replied hurriedly. “We would like our titles to reflect our position and privilege, sir and a word from you, sir –”</p><p>        “And why,” Theo said slowly, cutting him off, “would I help you?”</p><p>“I might have something you want, sir.”</p><p>        “Oh?” Theo raised an eyebrow.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Daphne was reading in the private drawing room. She liked it away from all the noise that Theo’s guests made. Some were his friends, no doubt, but Theo was a rather solitary man, always had been.</p><p>She often thought, rather sadly, that he never seemed to know how to talk to her, to be with her. He married her because he thought he had to, because she seemed the best option out of a very small selection of ‘suitable’ girls. He wasn’t trained in the ways of husbandry – she rather thought his father, in his mental state, had foregone to talk to Theo about that. He was however, a brilliant businessman and he was pragmatic, powerful now, too. She’d done well, she thought wryly, even if the cost was a brand on her husband’s arm and awful people at her dining table.</p><p>His way of dealing with her was to essentially avoid her at all costs, meeting her eyes awkwardly at dinner, smiling his irresistible smile when they brushed hands in the corridors of his loud, empty Manor.</p><p>There was a particularly loud cry from somewhere in the Manor and the abrupt end of said screaming. Daphne sighed, memories flashing before her eyes: Hogwarts. Final Battle. Astoria. Death Eaters. Green Light. She blinked ferociously, trying to banish it all to some dark corner in her mind.</p><p>She had always thought he was a good man, when she was younger – a flawed one, no doubt, but a good man. Now she thought there was no such thing.</p><p>But he kept her safe, didn’t he? He had given her financial security, a title, protection from the Death Eaters. That was worth it all, wasn’t it?</p><hr/><p>Theo sat at the head of the table. It was the first dinner they’d ever held at his Manor in the two weeks following their marriage.</p><p>His guests (a list compiled wordlessly by Daphne) were arranged with expert knowledge as to social standing and relations. He knew she was a proper lady, of course, she’d had that sort of upbringing, and he knew she was adept with this sort of thing. Completely tedious, really he didn’t know how anyone of any intelligence could stand it. Which was why initially he’d assumed she must be lacking in intelligence.</p><p>His wife, the silent and skilful master behind the whole thing, sat to his right. She was really quite beautiful, he thought, the kind of classical beautiful that inspires artists. But Theodore Nott was no artist.</p><p>She was talking to the man next to her and he felt an odd wave of <em>something</em>, he wasn’t quite sure what. Was it curiosity? Jealousy, perhaps? Morgana knew why, he’d watched her talk to dull Ministry men a hundred times before at a hundred different dinners before this one, watched her nod and smile and offer them more wine if they were boring, more whiskey if they weren’t.</p><p>Maybe it was because she was talking about alchemy of all things, something he’d assumed she’d be too stupid to understand, let alone be able to give a comprehensive critical exposition about. Really, who on earth actually had opinions about morality in alchemy? He had thought, outside of organising dinner parties and unknowingly manipulating Ministry officials (something that came naturally to Slytherins), she wasn’t that bright. She hadn’t been qualified to do NEWT Potions… unless she had chosen not to study it, and had actually been perfectly qualified all along. He’d never asked, and he probably never would. She never spoke to him like that anyway – animatedly, as though she were genuinely interested and excited by the subject matter.</p><p>Why did this Ministry man get to see this side of her? Why not him?</p><p>He was intelligent. He knew about alchemy. And he was her husband, didn’t that count for anything? He didn’t know he was frowning until she brushed his hand with her own, a quiet gesture that meant, we’re in public, we have to keep up appearances, remember where you are and who you’re with. So he schooled his face and turned to smile at her, kissing her hand deliberately whilst the Ministry man pointedly looked away.</p><hr/><p>“It’s about an old friend of yours, sir, a Mr Malfoy,” Rowle said.</p><p>Theo looked up. “Mr Malfoy is dead.”</p><p>“Funny, isn’t it? I saw him just yesterday, sir, and yet they say you killed him.”</p><p>Theo narrowed his eyes. He knew a threat when he heard one. Rowle, seeing that he had his attention, began talking more slowly. He had always had a flair for dramatics.</p><p>“I was in Knockturn Alley, doing some business for the Dark Lord, he’d trusted me ’specially with it, sir. Well, I ran into Mr Malfoy, and I recognised him, sir. He didn’t see me, sir, I was careful. I followed him into The White Wyvern – you know that old pub near Markus Scarrs’, sir? I was about to leave sir, because I really needed to get this done for the Dark Lord, but then I heard a name that interested me greatly, the name of a certain rebel from the war, one that we thought was also dead.”</p><hr/><p>“Daphne,” he said softly, so as not to disturb her. His palms were sweaty, he shifted his weight from foot to foot. <em>Breathe, Nott, you’re a man aren’t you?</em></p><p>She looked up from her book, her brow slightly creased from concentration. “Theodore?”</p><p>He winced. Theodore was his father’s name. Theodore was the name of a tyrant. <em>Get it together, Nott</em>.</p><p>“Would you play a song for me?” he asked. He’d rehearsed this many times before. Back and forth as he paced up and down his room.</p><p>“A song? We don’t have a piano…” she trailed off.</p><p>Of course, because his father hated music. Couldn’t stand it. <em>Stop that infernal racket, boy, I’ll not have that in my house –</em></p><p>“I recalled that you played. It is your birthday, isn’t it?”</p><p>Daphne looked down at the necklace he’d already given her – something she doubted most Death Eater brides were wearing right now. Not all Death Eaters were as good as Theo, as resourceful. She looked at him then, a smile blooming on her face for the first time. The first genuine smile he’d received from her. It felt like tenderness. It ached.</p><p>He led her into the next room, the ballroom, and lifted a velvet cover to reveal the most delightful Grand Piano she’d ever seen. What she didn’t know then was that this piano had once belonged to Theo’s mother, that this piano was part of Theo’s foggy memories of his childhood, that his father could never bring himself to destroy it or throw it away. That this gift was so much more than a piano, it was a part of a history she didn’t yet understand. That by giving it to her, he was letting her in – or trying to.</p><p>She didn’t know that then, but she did know that Theo knew she liked music, and Theo knew that music made her smile. And that had to mean something, didn’t it?</p><p>So she sat down on the stool and hesitantly rested her fingers on the keys.</p><p>Her magic seemed to flow into the music, he’d thought, that first time he heard her play. It was enchanting and enthralling, watching her. She seemed at ease in a way he had never seen before, her eyelids softly closed, a faint smile on her lips. It seemed intimate, significant somehow.</p><p>And when she’d finished, he charmed the keys to replay what she had played, the sound reverberating throughout the room. He had looked her, at the way the light from the tall windows fell on her hair and turned it into spun gold, at the way that the room, having looked hauntedly empty and full of shadows for so long, seemed to spring alive in her presence, as though it could sense her <em>goodness</em>.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, unsure of himself but then he took Daphne’s hand, and, as he had done at their wedding, guided her around the room in a perfect waltz. He had never been one for flying, but this felt like floating. She had an easy gracefulness about her, and the way she looked at him was a little disarming. Like she could see right through him, like she knew him.</p><p>Daphne would never remember at exactly what point she fell in love with Theo, but she would always think of this moment as being a strong contender.</p><hr/><p>But then things took a twisted turn, as things are wont to do.</p>
