    <p>
  <span>There were only two things Tony Stark hated about being a Slytherin. Mind you, the title of Head Boy of a Hogwarts House wasn’t to be taken for granted, but still. Tony was pissed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For one, everyone seemed to hate Slytherin, as if each and every one of them was somehow inherently evil. Tony was no angel, but he certainly wasn’t evil either. Corrupted, sure. A bit… promiscuous, maybe. But not evil.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Anyway, the everyone-hating-Slytherin thing must have been why they were crammed into the dungeons and expected to live comfortably down there. That led Tony to the second thing he hated: “living comfortably down there” was no longer remotely possible.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>During the Battle of Hogwarts, Dumbledore’s ingenious weather charms had been destroyed, leaving the rest of the professors to attempt to replicate the extremely complex incantations and spells. Which they hadn’t succeeded at yet. Which meant that now, during the first November after the battle, the already uncomfortable Slytherin dungeons were rendered completely and utterly bone-numbing frigid.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tony </span>
  <em>
    <span>loved </span>
  </em>
  <span>it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He especially loved the fact that this bone-numbing frigidity apparently had only one solution: move all the Slytherins to the Gryffindor dorms for the entirety of the winter, of course. Obviously.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall claimed it was because Gryffindor had the largest dorm system, but Tony had the sneaking suspicion the headmaster secretly wanted to try and force the two biggest rivals of the school to get along out of pure schadenfreude. Because what else would it be? Why else would the headmaster get it into her head that this would be a good idea? Had she become best friends with Peeves? Had she gotten into Tony’s firewhiskey stash? Had she…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“...Tony? Tony!” His head whipped around and then slightly downward as he snapped out of his inner rant and a pretty, petite ginger fourth year came into his focus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“...Oh. Pepper. Hi. What did you want?” The girl looked up at him with a small smile he assumed was intended to be cute. The girl was smitten. It was slightly amusing to Tony. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re almost there, Tony.” Ah. That. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As he conveyed the message back to his house, he looked behind him at the wandering mass of Slytherin students trailing along in his wake. None of them looked particularly happy. Most of them looked rather irritated, in fact, a feeling he empathized with greatly. When he said most, however, he meant nearly all but one: James. Bloody. Buchanan. Fucking. Barnes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bloke was ecstatic. Something about staying with his “best pal” - maybe somebody was finally getting more action than Tony. Hardly likely though, with that puppy face of his… He certainly seemed to be a fan of a certain Gryffindor prefect, however. Bloody hell, he probably even rooted for the Gryffindor quidditch team more than for his own.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tony turned his head back to the front as they approached a hideous portrait of a rather bovine, morbidly obese woman. Tony knew of this portrait and had passed by it various times in the past, but he still had to wonder each time what on earth the Gryffindors had done to deserve such an abomination as the entrance to their common room. They were probably major gits at some point, Tony figured. He wouldn’t be surprised. They kind of still were.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Welcome to the Gryffindor Commo- </span>
  <em>
    <span>oh,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>the Fat Lady snarled, cutting off her typical loud, melodramatic greeting song. “Oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>no.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Certainly not. There is no way in Dumbledore’s castle I will let any of you slimy, slithering </span>
  <em>
    <span>beasts</span>
  </em>
  <span> -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Er-” Tony attempted to interject.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“-into MY Common Room!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tony stared daggers at the Fat Lady before affecting a sickly sweet smile and holding up his hand to stifle the aggravated grumbling behind him. “Well, I’m afraid it’s McGonagall’s orders, so open u-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>MCGONAGALL SHMCGONAGALL! I hardly listened to Dumbledore, so what makes you think I’ll deign to listen to this </span>
  <em>
    <span>newcomer</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” the Fat Lady harrumphed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tony strained to keep a smile, his resolve slowly draining. “Okay -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve got this, Stark,” said a steely female voice to his left. The well-muscled, svelte form of Sif Valhalla, the Head Girl, stepped in front of him. “Listen, Lady. If you don’t let us say the bloody password and get inside, I will personally </span>
  <em>
    <span>Reducto </span>
  </em>
  <span>your fat arse off the wall and -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“OH HO! And now you threaten me! That’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>it,</span>
  </em>
  <span> you rotten snakes. I’m changing the password.” This time, Tony’s facade vanished and was replaced by an irate glare. The Fat Lady pouted in response. “And you couldn’t even guess it if you tried.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The corridor went quiet in tense anticipation. Tony continued to glare unflinchingly at the Fat Lady while Sif raised her wand slowly. The Head Girl of Slytherin didn’t bluff. She had just opened her mouth to say the incantation, however, when a voice rang out in the crowd behind him. “STEVE!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sif’s voice died in her throat and she looked back with an icy glower at the source of the outburst. James Barnes, of course. Tony’s expression mirrored Sif’s. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He then shifted his gaze behind James to the source of another jovial - and disgustingly American - yell: “Bucky! Hey man!” and watched as a hulking figure came out of the gloom of the corridor, gently muscled through some disgruntled Slytherin sixth years, and slapped James rather roughly on the back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tony’s expression had now transitioned into that of blank shock as he took in the exchange and the newcomer. So this was Steve. Tony vaguely remembered him as a skinny little beanpole at the sorting hat ceremony Tony’s second year, looking comically awed as the Sorting Hat nearly instantly placed him in Gryffindor. Save for a few times passing each other in the halls,  that was the last he had seen of him until now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Puberty had hit him like the Giant Squid crash landing on a broomstick.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Not only did he now tower over most of the surrounding students, he also happened to be rather gorgeously toned, if Tony did say so himself, and his shoulder to waist ratio didn’t entirely seem possible. As the mystery boy approached, Tony got a closer glimpse at his face, and… bloody hell. That jawline could cut steel.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He realized he must have been gawking or something like it because Steve just kept on approaching, until he was right in front of him and Tony had to crane his neck back a bit to look up at him. “You all right, pal?” came the American-accented inquiry that snapped Tony out of his ogling session.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Pal. </span>
  </em>
  <span>There it was. The boy had called him </span>
  <em>
    <span>pal.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He was ridiculously, unfairly attractive and he had called him </span>
  <em>
    <span>pal. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Tony decided he hated this Steve person.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tony cleared his throat before replying in a dry tone, “One, not your ‘pal'. Two, I would be ‘all right’ if this </span>
  <em>
    <span>hag </span>
  </em>
  <span>would let us in your bloody common room, but since that doesn’t seem to be the case, no. I’m not ‘all right’.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Steve raised his eyebrows some but otherwise didn’t appear to be bothered by what Tony had said. Instead he gave a small grin (Merlin, could he </span>
  <em>
    <span>stop</span>
  </em>
  <span>?), put his hands on his hips, and swiveled towards the portrait of the Fat Lady. And god-fucking-damnit, if that wasn’t the finest arse he had ever seen on a male. Scratch that, on anyone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tony really hated him now. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Strolling right up to the Fat Lady with hands still on hips, the boy spoke again. “Etheldreda! How are ya, ol’ gal? What did they do this time?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sif looked rather offended. “What did </span>
  <em>
    <span>they </span>
  </em>
  <span>do?! She’s the one who -” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I </span>
  </em>
  <span>was the one who acted completely appropriately to a bunch of slimy, cold-blooded -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Etheldreda,” Steve admonished.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry dear, but it’s true! They’re nothing like you, sweetums, they’re horrid, you see, and they’re trying to invade! I’m simply protecting you, you and the most Valiant House of Gryffindor.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After patiently waiting for her to finish, Steve continued to smile as he said, “Well, you see, you may be right, but they have no place to stay for the winter and we said we’d take them in. I don’t trust them either, but rules are rules, all right? Please, for me?” he added when she looked extra reluctant.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Fat Lady pouted for another ten seconds or so, to which Steve waited patiently with an expectant face and Tony tapped a foot, and then she finally let out a long, drawn out sigh. </span>
  <em>
    <span>So dramatic, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Tony thought. “Fine. Password’s back to normal. But don’t any of you </span>
  <em>
    <span>dare </span>
  </em>
  <span>think that I’m okay with you rats staying here. Pah!” she concluded, before crossing her arms and looking at Steve impatiently. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Excellent! Great. Okay Etheldreda, uh, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ornery Occamy?” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Fat Lady rolled her eyes and swung the door open. Steve flashed a winning grin back at Tony and Sif. Sif gave him an exasperated but slightly grateful look, and Tony offered a heavily sarcastic “Yeahh, thanks </span>
  <em>
    <span>pal!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>before shouldering his way through the entrance with an irritated grunt. He thought he might have seen Steve stifle a laugh out of the corner of his eye. The </span>
  <em>
    <span>nerve.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As the entirety of Slytherin piled into the common room, Tony took the place in. It looked ridiculously… comfortable, almost disgustingly so. Absolutely everything was red or gold or both, even the carpets, which were - and Tony wasn’t kidding - everywhere. Literally. Nothing was solid, everything was plush, and Tony hated it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This was going to be an </span>
  <em>
    <span>amazing </span>
  </em>
  <span>winter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>By the time all of Slytherin was hustled in and Tony was rather unceremoniously maneuvered onto a sofa that he sank halfway into, he felt like he may have been about to suffocate on the stuffiness. His entire house plus at least half of Gryffindor (most of whom were just milling around in curiosity or lurking to witness the drama and tension) were in this one room, and it may have been a large space, but Tony was fairly sure it was probably about fifty people above capacity.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>To top it all off, across from the sofa that Tony, Sif, and the Slytherin prefects (including James Barnes, to Tony’s chagrin) were sitting on, the Gryffindor Head Girl and Steve were perched on a chaise lounge, their postures alert and their expressions an interesting mix of exasperation and feigned friendliness. Charming.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once everyone was more or less settled or attempting to be comfortable in one of the numerous oversized plushy armchairs, Steve spoke up first. “Hi everyone! The name’s Steve Rogers, but you can call me Steve.” Tony made a mental note to call him “Rogers” from that point forward. “I’m one of the Gryffindor prefects, representing the gents since our Head Boy Thor is… currently not present.” Tony refrained from an eye roll. Everyone knew he was likely off shagging his muggle girlfriend. Well, everyone except the professors, apparently (but Tony had a sneaking suspicion they knew too). </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And I’m Maria Hill, Gryffindor Head Girl. And unlike the Head Boy, I happen to have priorities,” the female on the chaise said with a pleasant smile. At this, Tony couldn’t help but return the gesture with a small inward smirk. He hadn’t expected that level of sass from her, and he liked it. “But, until dear Thor can sort out his and grace us with his presence, I’m in charge of Welcomes. so. Welcome to Gryffindor!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A chorus of various responses, including “Cheers,” “Whatever,” “Pleasure,” and “Please get this over with,” filled the room for a few moments. Tony raised his hand after a bit and the murmurings eventually died out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Putting on a winning facade, Tony replied, “I assure you, we’re all thrilled. Now,” he continued, casting a pointed look at Steve, who raised his brows but didn’t otherwise alter his expression, “I’m sure some of you fit the Gryffindor stereotype to a T, so let’s set down some ground rules that will probably be broken within the hour.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Maria shot Tony a steely look. Steve gave an easy chuckle. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Damn you, Rogers.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ahem. Well, since you asked so nicely,” Maria chirped, regaining her composure, “I’d be happy to oblige. First things first, of course, no boys in the girls dormitories, and vice versa.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We may get around quite a bit more than you lot, but we’re not daft,” muttered Tony. No response. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Next, Slytherins and Gryffindors will not engage in any combat or duels within Gryffindor premises.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No promises,” a particularly bold Gryffindor underclassman growled. Sif smirked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If Slytherin is the winner of a quidditch match, they will celebrate elsewhere.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, </span>
  <em>
    <span>if.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not like we would throw a party in this fluffy pigsty.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Better than your dingy sewers.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It continued like this for several minutes, during which Maria listed various other unnecessary rules (including - Tony’s eyes rolled to the back of his head at this - the rule that Gryffindors got first call for showers). Finally, everyone was allowed to mill around into their shared dormitories, inside which the beds had been transfigured into two-bed bunks and students would simply have to get creative with the allocation of their belongings.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This applied to all dormitories but the prefects’ and Head Students’, who had rooms to themselves and merely had another bed moved in across the room from it. Tony was relieved when he learned this; he much preferred that arrangement to having to get cozy with one of these red and gold gits.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>However, his relief was short-lived when he then learned that because Odin Borson, the Head Boy Thor’s father, was rather… influential (wealthy) when it came to overseeing his son’s treatment at Hogwarts, Thor was to have his own room at all times, no questions asked. That meant that, of course, Tony was relegated to the room of the next step down on the totem pole, and that was none other than Steve Rogers himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Everyday.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For the entire winter.</span>
</p>
