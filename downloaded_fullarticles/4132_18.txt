    <p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry, was attempting to get the student body's attention, with little success. He made a quick decision.</p><p>"Sonorus," he murmured among the chaos of the Great Hall. He faced his wand to him, clearing his throat loudly.</p><p>The students blatantly ignored him, some stray fireworks entering the sky amidst the noise, no doubt thanks to the Weasley twins. This time, he on purposely coughed, but this started a series of hacking coughs (not as young as he used to be you know) until the aged wizard was bent over double, attempting not to die from the force. Once his coughing fit was over, he delightedly noted that the hall was silent.</p><p>Harry took a swig of his pumpkin juice, eyeing the Headmaster with a mixture of amusement and exasperation. He nudged Ron with his elbow.</p><p>“Psst. Hey, I know Dumbledore's one of the greatest wizards who has ever lived, but if one of those coughs happen when he's fighting Voldefuck, he's going to the hop the stick faster than he could say viagra.”</p><p>Ron tried and failed unsuccessfully to restrain a snort, he expelled warm coffee from both nose and mouth, drenching the table and breaking into a coughing fit of his own. While the students around him wrinkled their noses in disgust, Harry grinned, slapping him on the back a few times. He tuned back into dear old Dumbledang. Harry liked the sound of that, he might take it up with Dumbledore later, see if he wanted to change his surname.</p><p>His throat was a little sore and he noted with some amusement that young Mr Weasley fared no better. Perhaps the cough was contagious? He shook his head of stray thoughts, raising his Occlumency shields and addressing the hall.</p><p>“You all know, of The Triwizard Tournament taking place this year. What I am about to reveal to you will bewitch your minds, ensnare your senses, even put a stopper in your life.” He felt Severus' glare but continued. “Behold, the Triwizard cup!”</p><p>“Did he just-” Harry blinked, cut off with a withering glare from Hermione.</p><p>With a fancy flourish of his wand and an exaggerated bow, he gestured to the cup near him. He decided not to mention to anyone that in the privacy of his own office, he'd practised that little dramatic movement. By the time another tournament came around, he'd probably not be alive to witness it, so why not make the most of the situation?</p><p>“I shall reveal the names of the three champions. Good luck to all.”</p><p>The fire darkened, glowing blue as a small piece of paper looking oddly like pencil shavings floated into his outstretched palm.</p><p>“From Beuxbatons, Fleur Delacour!"<em> 'Ah yes, one of the many ninnies who failed to prepare for Scotland's weather, wonderful.'</em>  Dumbledore muttered in his head. He shook the young woman's hand, the Goblet presenting the second champion.</p><p>“From Durmstrang, Victor Krum.” Dumbledore wondered if he dunked Krum in his morning cup of tea, how he'd taste? Biscuits had crumbs but they were soggy and sank to the bottom. He should change his name to Victor Biscuit. Another handshake, on with the last champion.</p><p>“Lastly Hogwarts' champion, Cedric Diggory!” Oh, Twilight boy. Some polite inquiries informed him that he'd taken a part-time job in acting. He starred as the role of a Vampire and many teenage girls threw their underwear at him. In truth, that didn't sound like a bad idea.</p><p>He was about to leave for another nice cup of tea until the Goblet spat out another name. Glancing at the parchment, he wondered if Minerva would permit him a Gillyweed break. 'Harry Potter.' of course, trouble seemed to follow that boy everywhere. In truth, he was annoyed so decided to have a bit of fun. Once again raising his Occlumency shields in case his face gave him away, he made direct contact with one student in the hall, his gaze never leaving theirs.</p><p>“Neville Longbottom.” The student body chattered among themselves, most turning to look at the boy who had gone deathly white, hands gripping the table where he sat. Looking as though he were about to be sick, he slowly stood up, shakily removing himself from the benches and was about to walk to the front as though the executioner had paid him a personal visit when a few squawks and giggles startled him. </p><p>Dumbledore slapped his knee, laughing to the point of where tears were streaming down his face. Staff casually pushed their chairs further back, Snape concluding that the old coot had finally lost his nut.</p><p>He righted himself, taking off his glasses to rub the moisture from them and his eyes. ”I'm funnier than I thought, you should have seen your face Neville, it was a beautiful sight to behold!”</p><p>Neville had had a sensory overload because it was too much for him to take. Eyes rolling to the back of his head, he sank to the floor in a dead faint, people wincing when his head hit the stone floor with an audible <strong>crack.</strong> Madam Pomfrey conjured a magical stretcher, taking him away.</p><p>The hall was silent, save for a guffaw. Dumbledore noted that the boy was unaware that everyone could hear what he was saying.</p><p>“Did you see Longbottom's face? He looked like he'd seen his parents being tortured. Oh, wait, he has!”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. ”Knut for your thoughts, Mr Malfoy? I daresay Mr Longbottom would face any task ahead with courage. I envision you crying home to daddy if a magical creature so much as looked your way. I suggest you hold your tongue, you ferrety little shit.”</p><p>Shocked murmurs sent a wave through the Hall, the sound was broken by one Harry Potter, red in the face with laughter and half sliding out of his seat as he tried to gain control of himself. Malfoy could be seen sputtering in indignation.</p><p>“You wait till my father hears about this-”</p><p>“-Yes, yes of course.” Dumbledore dismissed him with a wave of his hand. Now, back to the real fourth champion. ”Harry Potter.”</p><p>Harry immediately recovered from his laughing fit, almost giving himself whiplash with the force he sat up.</p><p>“Oh bollocks!” He shouted, not even bothering to keep quiet. The hall produced a wave of giggles at that.</p><p>Harry thought his eyes would pop from his head. ”Nope nope nope.” he could be heard muttering, crawling under the Gryffindor table, in some faint hope Dumbledore would lose sight of him and for Merlin's sake to let him have a normal school year! That wasn't to be because as soon as he ran for the slightly ajar door, an unknown force pulled him back, sending him in the opposite direction as he landed with a crash.</p><p>“Accio Harry Potter!” Dumbledore called out and the twinkle in his eye grew brighter as Harry fought tooth and nail, quite literally nail as they were bleeding from the force of him scratching the stone floor in some feeble attempt to escape. Luckily, he dodged The-Boy-Who-Failed-To-Escape as he stopped with a thump near him. He'd overpowered the spell a tad, considering Harry went from the Great Hall doors to him in under five seconds.</p><p>Harry righted himself, wincing at the broken mess of nails. Did he have to do that? He just wanted to go back to his common room, perhaps leap out of the window but 'forget' his broom for the sake of a late evening flight.</p><p>Dumbledore wiggled his fingers in a mockery of goodbye towards the student body, using the other to beckon Harry in a <em>'come hither'</em>  motion.</p><p>Obliging, Harry followed. Why him? Just <em>one</em> year, couldn't he catch a break? Sure last year didn't involve Voldemort in any form but reliving said memories of Voldemort through Dementors and thinking someone was out to kill him but wasn't, THEN being chased by a werewolf who would happily use him as a human toothpick, wasn't much bloody better in his books! He was nice every other day of the month but at that time, it was beside the point.</p><p>The door creaked ominously as Harry descended the stairs into the trophy room. Fitting since he was feeling how Neville looked before he was carted off to the Hospital Wing.</p><p>The other champions regarded him with curiosity. Along with Crouch, McGonagall, Snape, Moody, Dumbledore, Karkaroff and Maxime, the room was packed.</p><p>Dumbledore knew for a fact Harry didn't put his name in, some other idiot did. The boy was a Gryffindor but even he had some self-preservation. He ignored how Harry nearly died multiple times three years in a row and decided to make this situation memorable.</p><p>He penetrated Harry with his stare, twinkle gone for the moment. Harry shuffled uncomfortably, scratching his head. It was just those two at that moment. He slowly moved his half-moon glasses to the tip of his nose.</p><p>“Harry...” Dumbledore took a deep breath here, “Did you put your name in the Goblet of FIYYYYYYAAAAAAH!” He sang the last word operatic style, pointing to the air and slapping himself in the face with his beard.</p><p>Harry slid down a glass cabinet and lay face-up on the floor, moaning and rubbing his face. Once he was composed, he just lay there.</p><p>“No, no, no and no. Oh, did I mention the word NO?” Harry sighed, “I have an unwanted death wish each year and last year, that bloody bat Trelawney predicted my death. Why the hell would I volunteer to die when by default, I'm going to die?”</p><p>“Of course you put your name in Potter!” Snape spat, sneering. ”Just one more reason to have your little fans worship your every step. You're just like your father.”</p><p>Harry gave Snape an incredulous look. ”What crawled up your arse and died? I know you hate my Dad and you still get wet dreams over my Mum, but it doesn't mean to say you have to get your teeth out at me!”</p><p>“20 Points-” Snape spoke until Dumbledore cut over him. “-To Gryffindor for speaking the very sad truth, Mr Potter. Well done, well done indeed!” Dumbledore offered a hand up, jovially slapping Harry on the back as he stood.</p><p>Most of the room didn't believe that he never put his name in and he imagined Ron would be stewing in his jealousy. After being briefed on what it was all about, the tasks and when the first one was, he trudged outside, completely ignoring curfew.</p><p>Seating himself on the cool grass, he rested his head for a moment. He knew for a fact that there was probably no way to escape this contract, so he would do his best to pass the tasks in his style.</p><p><em>'i'd better send an owl to Sirius while I'm out here, sod it all to hell.'</em>  So with that, he took a slow walk to the Owlery, conjuring some parchment to write a quick note. Better to hear it from him than someone else.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>Sirius, my good man, how's life?</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Just wanted to ask if you're on friendly terms with The Dementors? Could you ask them to suck out my all-consuming sadness instead of the rare moments of happiness? Because I feel like they could do with a career change.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>What I'm saying is, you know The Triwizard Tournament, the event which has killed many many people due to all the manner of dangerous tasks throughout the years? My name's come out of the blasted goblet. I'll even provide you with the memory but I swear down on Snape's infatuation with his potions, that I didn't put my name in. I thought it would be best to tell you rather than hearing it from Dumbledang (my new name for him now, you like it?) Anyway, I'll let you bite the rest of your fleas and scratch your arse in peace. Bye now!</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>Harry</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center"><em> </em> <em>P.S- Can't you come here as Padfoot and bite the arses of the officials for them to bugger off and leave me in peace? I'm in a binding magical contract so I'll die if I leave but chances are, I'm going to die anyway. If I'm going to die I want to die happy, not dying unhappy about the thought that I'm dying.</em></p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center">  </p><p>With that, Harry attached the letter to the leg of a random owl, not knowing where Hedwig was in that moment. Harry crept back into Gryffindor Tower, deciding sleep might help to clear his head, though having a suspicion that he wouldn't get much tonight. Not bothering to undress, he flopped face-first onto the bed, promptly passing out.</p>
