    <p>*Ron’s Pov*<br/>
Ron didn’t feel happy anymore. And he doesn’t know what to do about it. Merlin knows he tries, but every time he comes close to feeling just a little bit ecstatic he remembers the losses he had suffered. Losing Fred was hard enough, but George? That even worse. George hadn’t lasted much longer after Fred’s death. The healers had said it was heartbreak. George’s heart had very literally split in half. But he couldn't force himself to dwell on it for long, he was afraid the same thing would happen to him. So instead, he faked it. It seemed way easier than having to explain everything to somebody.<br/>
He wasn’t all too excited to leave home and head to Hogwarts. Ron didn’t want to leave his family while they were at the most vulnerable state they had ever been in but his mother insisted he go. “It’s your last year, you have to go! We don’t want you to miss out on your education for the second time in a row!” So here he was, standing on Platform 9 ¾ for his eighth year at Hogwarts. </p><p>*Blaise’s Pov*<br/>
Could he still feel happiness, or was that not a thing anymore? As far as he could remember, Blaise had been a pretty chill guy at one point. But ever since his mother’s death all Blaise could think about was what the world would be like without him. He knew that wasn’t fair to the people who loved him. They were already going through hardships, and the death of one more person would probably break them. It’s not like he’s good at hiding it though. From time-to-time Blaise needs to step out of the room because the depression becomes too suffocating and he needs to break-down. That’s why he loves his friends so much. They were always there for him, so he will always be there for them.<br/>
Blaise wasn’t ready to go to Hogwarts. Don’t get him wrong, he had always loved going to Hogwarts. The high ceilings, the smell of the food in the great hall, the dormitories, even the classes had a strange sense of security. But he was not excited for the number of panic attacks that he was going to get. Just thinking about the broken and damaged school unnerved him. But he was sure to leave this school year on a happy note. And as he stood on Platform 9 ¾ he promised himself he would be happy.</p>
