  <span class="s1">“I hope you have a good explanation for this.” McGonagall glared at them with seething anger, standing behind her desk, arms folded. Nymphodora pulled the edge of her collar to get some air, because this kind of sweating should be unholy. Charlie and Oliver shared a look of guilt. There was no sound in the room for a solid minute.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then a slight purr. McGonagall leaned under the desk, and scowled, the little black kitten looked up at her sweetly. She simply shook her head and faced upwards again.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mum-“ Harry re-formed, groaning as he hit his head on the desk and stepped out of his usual hiding place.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“-Don’t, Harry.” She looked at the students, “Now I know what you’re going to say-“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry’s a student, you can’t punish him.” All three said in unison. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I am very aware of that.” She cut in. “But just because one of you have an excuse doesn’t mean you all do.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">All of them, including Harry, immediately started whining. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Detention.” She spoke over them, and then turned to Harry. “And you’re going to bed without dinner tonight.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry held a hand over his heart, a ridiculous expression, as if it was some kind of scandal. The bell chimed. McGonagall shook her head. “You will also stay behind for-“ but when she turned to look at them, they’d all disappeared. She sighed of defeat.</span>
</p><p class="p2">***</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nymphadora ruffled his hair, grinning wildly. “It’s wonder she’s still letting you come here, Harry.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Oliver laughed. “Oh god. I bet she’s not gonna let me on the pitch for weeks.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry pouted. “But you’re the best player.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Charlie twirled so he was walking backwards momentarily. “Aren’t you guys hungry? Hurry up.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not allowed anything anyway. You heard her.” Harry said.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nymphadora pat Harry on the shoulder. “Nonsense, you can have some of mine.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry flashed a smile. “Cheers, Dora.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">***</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They all walked off to their designated tables when they entered the main hall, students spotting Harry and begging for him to sit with them, don’t sit with those softies. Harry simply laughed and squeezed in between Cedric Diggory and another first year. He’d met Cedric when he was helping his mother with Transfiguration class. Harry wasn’t actually a student, not until 5 months, but that didn’t stop him. Ever since they’d found him on the night his parents died, Harry’s been all over the place. Throughout the school year, he’d stay at Hogwarts with McGonagall, and then during holidays he’d stay with uncle Sirius and uncle Remus. Sometimes the weasleys would let him stay at Christmas. Harry loved those Christmases (Dont tell Sirius), he’d met Charlie years ago when he was 7, and was basically glued to Fred and George. Half of Harry’s wardrobe was composed of itchy sweaters. Not to mention Ron, his best friend, was arriving next year.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey.” Harry elbowed Cedric in the stomach.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hey!” He whined, cradling one hand over his ribs. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry rolled his eyes. “Come on, I didn’t hit you that hard. What are you looking at?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Cedric blushed and nodded to the Ravenclaw table. Harry furrowed his brows, and stared for a while, and-</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oooh,” he leaned closer towards the other boy, “Cho Chang, huh?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Cedric got even redder. “Harry! She’s just.. very gifted.” Harry remained silent, waiting for Cedric to elaborate.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“She’s good at quidditch, okay?!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Like em sporty, do you Diggory?” Harry snickered. Cedric bonked him on the head with a drum stick.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry! Look out!” Nymphadora called from the end of the Hufflepuff table. Harry lifted his hand swiftly, and caught an apple in his hand. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fruit?” He moaned. Dora laughed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Cedric nudged his arm, trying to get Harry’s attention back. “I’m thinking of asking her to the Hogsmeade trip.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The one specifically for 3rd years and above?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Cedric pouted. “It’s never to early to make plans.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“She could be dating Percy Weasley by then.” Harry chimed in. Cedric looked at him in utter disgust.</span>
</p><p class="p2">***</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry entered his chambers a bit late that night. Thankfully McGonagall wasn’t there to see. It was at the very top of the east tower, in the roof, which meant it was small but homey. There was one tall window at the edge, with a view of Hogwarts, where kept his books and letters. Next to the desk was a pile of rubbish, empty jars of ink, rolled up balls of paper, dusty books. On the other side, just below the window, was Harry’s owl Hedwig. Opposite the window was Harry’s bed, with a poster above of AC/DC, uncle Sirius’ favourite band.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry threw his clothes on the floor, opening the trunk at the end of his bed, and rushing under his covers. Just before he’d removed his glasses, he heard a thud on the window. Harry ran to his window, seeing an old, ugly grey Owl. Uncle Sirius’ owl. He slid the window open, buzzing with excitement, and untied the note gently from the owl’s head. It flew to a tiny wooden swing hanging from the ceiling as Harry slipped the window shut. The took a box cutter and carefully pulled the letter out. When he unfolded it, he saw two short paragraphs. Both in two very different distinct handwriting, Sirius’ and Remus’. He read the Remus’ first.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">
    <em>Hey, Harry, It’s Moony. I would ask you how school is, but you don’t really go to school yet. Best I can ask you is how Minerva is. Speaking of school, I’ve already got you an appointment with Madame Mulkin. (P.S. She’s bit of a dog</em>
  </span>
  <span class="s1"><em> -</em> Remus hadn’t actually wrote that, but Harry had learned to tune out Moony’s swearing from a young age - </span>
  <span class="s2">
    <em>but just be as quick as you can, it’ll be fine) I heard about you did on Wednesday. God, those Weasleys sure are creative. Sirius laughed when he heard about it - they remind him of us of your father. I still don’t regret giving you map, but don’t tell Minerva you have it okay? The janitor didn’t notice when we took it at the last reunion.</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry giggled a bit on the last line, moving down to Sirius’ letter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">
    <em>HARRY!! </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s2">
    <em>McGonagall told me about your new friend. A Hufflepuff, really? What a disgrace to the Gryffindor house. I’m joking, obviously, so tell me a bit more about this Cedric Diggory boy. While we’re at it - have you wooed anyone yet? That Ginny girl seemed nice, I’m kind of bummed you didn’t stay with her,</em>
  </span>
  <span class="s1"> (Harry had dated Ron’s sister a while ago, but he didn’t like her that much, he thought she was a bit annoying)</span>
  <span class="s2">
    <em> but hey, it is what it is. It’s been really boring without you, you need to come over for the school holidays. </em>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span class="s2">
    <em>-Padfoot</em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry picked up the closet ink and quill, and scribbled down a fast reply.</span>
