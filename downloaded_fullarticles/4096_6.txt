    <p>When James Potter disappeared for ten days in the middle of the spring term of their fifth year, the whole school noticed. </p><p>Whispers flew around classrooms and gossip was rife in the great hall at breakfast; </p><p>‘I heard he was expelled for pushing that third year boy into the lake’ </p><p>‘Nah, I heard he ran off with a Veela girl he met over the Christmas holidays’</p><p>‘Mark from Hufflepuff told me his Dad is in St Mungos’ </p><p>For all the gossip and speculation, only three students knew the full truth. The three remaining Marauders sat pale and worried in the Great Hall, picking at their dry toast and lukewarm eggs.</p><p>‘Can’t we just-?’</p><p>‘No, Sirius’ </p><p>‘But-’</p><p>‘Family only they said. And there’s no way McGonagall will let us off lessons’ </p><p>They lapsed back into silence, trying to ignore the rumours that were slowly getting closer to the truth. </p><p>‘I heard you-know-who has wiped the whole lot of the Potters out’ </p><p>‘Nah, I reckon old Mrs Potter finally did her husband in’ </p><p>‘Not much of a loss really is it?’ sneered a blonde Ravenclaw boy, not bothering to check who was in earshot, ‘I mean, Potter is an arrogant tosser, his family is probably all the same’. </p><p>With a snarl, Sirius launched himself at the boy, breaking his nose and earning himself a week’s detention. </p><p>***</p><p>James gripped the seat tighter, his knuckles white, itching to hit something, throw something, do something. But instead he slouched further into the cool oak of the waiting room chair, biting his tongue and trying to stop the tears that threatened to fall. </p><p>They were gone. </p><p>He’d always known he’d be young when they died. They were elderly, he’d known that. But this, this was sudden. This wasn’t the hero's death his mother deserved, this wasn’t the peaceful passing, surrounded by grandchildren that his father had wanted.</p><p>‘James?’ </p><p>He glanced up at the kindly faced Healer who’d been looking after his parents throughout their brief illness, and resisted the urge to snap at her to leave. </p><p>‘Yeah?’ his voice was gruff from non use, clogged with tears he was still too proud to shed in public. </p><p>‘Your parents had each other listed as their next of kin, so I didn’t know- if there is- is there anyone you want us to owl?’ he didn’t like how she was looking at him. It looked a lot like pity. </p><p>‘No’ He said shortly, standing at last, ‘there isn’t anyone else’.</p><p>Without a backward glance he strode from the room.</p><p>***</p><p>The tapping noise drew Sirius slowly back to consciousness. He didn’t remember falling asleep, but evidently he had; fully clothed and still holding his Herbology textbook. </p><p>He blinked slowly as he sat up, surveying the dormitory. Peter was obscured by his curtains, but his snores could still be heard. Remus was asleep sitting up, a book on his chest and his mouth hanging open. James’ bed stood empty, the covers neatly tucked in and straight for possibly the first time in five years. </p><p>The tapping noise came again and Sirius quickly slid out of bed and to the window. A handsome tawny owl sat on the windowsill, and Sirius felt his heart fall through to his stomach. He took the scroll attached to the owl’s leg and unrolled it with determinedly steady hands. </p><p>
  <em>Moony, Wormtail &amp; Padfoot,</em><br/>
They’re gone. Need to make arrangements for the funeral. McGonagall will let you come I’m sure. There won’t be many people there otherwise.<br/>
Prongs.
</p><p>Sirius had the distinct impression that there wasn’t enough air in the room. He sat heavily on James’ abandoned bed, still gripping the letter. </p><p>He should wake the others, he thought, staring down at James’ untidy scrawl. But he couldn’t face it. Mr and Mrs Potter had been better parents to him than his own could have ever been; they took him in over Christmas when he had finally run away from Grimmauld Place, they sent him care packages, letters, and had never, not once, forgotten his birthday. </p><p>And now they were gone. </p><p>Fleamont and Euphemia Potter were dead, and there was hardly anyone left to mourn them, just four teenagers and a handful of old acquaintances. The injustice of their death slammed into him with the force of a fist; how unfair it was that those kind people could die so suddenly, so silently, while scum like his parents were still walking, talking and breathing. </p><p>‘Remus’ he croaked, not looking up from the letter. ‘REMUS’. </p><p>The taller boy jerked awake, his eyes wide and fearful until he realised there was no danger. Silently, Sirius held out the letter, not daring to let his eyes meet Remus’. </p><p>‘I’m sorry Padfoot’ Remus’ voice was steady, measured, like it always was, ‘we will go and see McGonagall first thing in the morning, then we can get the knight bus to Godric’s Hollow’. </p><p>Sirius nodded his agreement, before returning to his own bed and pulling the hangings around him. </p><p>By the time the rest of the school awoke the next day, all four marauders were missing from Hogwarts. </p><p>***</p><p>‘Where do you reckon they are?’ </p><p>‘Hm?’ </p><p>‘I mean I know all the rumours that have been going around have been absolutely awful but something serious must have happened for them all to be missing at once’</p><p>‘Yeah?’ </p><p>‘Yes and I know it sounds petty but Peter was supposed to be taking me to Hogsmeade this weekend and I’ve owled him but he hasn’t even <em>replied</em>. I mean, I am his <em>girlfriend</em>, everyone keeps expecting me to know where they are but he hasn’t told me anything’</p><p>‘Yeah that’s rough’ </p><p>‘And I know he doesn’t have to tell me if- Lily are you even listening to me?’ </p><p>‘I’m sure they’ll be back soon’ Lily continued to scribble distractedly, not noticing the glare she was receiving from the dark haired girl sat at the end of her bed. </p><p>‘Lilyyyy’ Cynthia whined, tugging on the roll of parchment that was starting to trail off the side of the desk, ‘you haven’t listened to a word I’ve said!’ </p><p>‘I’m sorry but this is essay is due this afternoon and I haven’t finished’ </p><p>‘Why didn’t you do it last night? Where were you anyway? And don’t say prefect rounds, I know for a fact it was Sarah Falkenberg’s turn last night because I heard her complaining about it at dinner’ </p><p>‘I’m taking extra classes with Slughorn’ Lily lied, scratching out half a sentence and scowling.</p><p>‘But you’re already top of the class’ Cynthia said, her eyebrows raised, ‘you’re guaranteed an O in the O.W.L’. </p><p>Lily finally looked up from her essay to study her roommate. Cynthia McKinnon was sitting on the end of Lily’s bed like it was a throne, curling her eyelashes with her wand as her tie knotted itself flawlessly. She was a good head shorter than Lily, and considerably curvier, with pleasant round cheeks, dark eyes and darker hair that she left natural, framing her face. </p><p>‘Look why don’t you go and talk to Mary about this?’ Lily suggested, tugging her essay back towards her, ‘you know she’s better at the girl talk. Come find me if you need the best way to jinx someone’. </p><p>Cynthia pouted. </p><p>‘I would, but she’s off snogging Dearborne from Ravenclaw and I would usually have breakfast with Peter but he’s not here’. </p><p> ‘Really? The seventh year?’ Lily wrinkled her nose</p><p>‘Focus Lily’ </p><p> ‘Right, sorry’ she rolled up her Herbology essay, resigned to the fact it would probably only scrape a passing grade, ‘Look, I don’t know where the “marauders” are and I don’t really care. They must have gotten permission to leave though so why don’t you try asking one of the teachers?’ </p><p>‘You don’t think that seems too clingy?’ Cynthia pressed, pouting into a pocket mirror now while she applied lipstick, ‘I don’t want it to seem like I’m stalking him, I’m just worried because we haven’t gone this long without talking since-’</p><p>‘Since you got together, I know’ Lily barely contained the urge to roll her eyes. The gossip that had surrounded Cynthia and Peter’s relationship had quickly fizzled out; he might have been the first marauder to get a girlfriend, but they were horribly dull. </p><p>‘I’ll stay behind after Transfiguration and ask McGonagall’ Cynthia decided, shrugging into her robes and stuffing her textbooks in her bag, ‘I’m sure she can at least tell me they’re all ok’ </p><p>‘I’m sure they’re fine you know. It’s just Hogwarts rumour mill working overtime’ Lily assured her roommate, ‘No one has been caught snogging in broom cupboards or broken curfew in a while.. The people get bored’ </p><p>‘It’s only a matter of time before people get wind of Mary and Dearborne, that should shake things up nicely’ </p><p>A screeching noise from the corner of the room made both girls jump, before realising it was just Dorcas’ alarm. After thirty seconds of the incessant noise, Cynthia strode over to the curtains surrounding their roommates bed. </p><p>‘Dorcas if you don’t get up right now you’re going to miss breakfast’ she said, tugging the curtains open and revealing the lanky brunette somehow still asleep and lying entirely on her face. </p><p>Lily ignored the two of them, used to their morning routine after five years of living with them. She waved goodbye and headed down for her solitary breakfast as usual. </p><p>For the first few years at Hogwarts she had met Severus for breakfast every morning, the tables were more mixed in the mornings, people getting help with homework from friends in other houses and working on group projects they hadn’t finished before lessons started. But since Christmas break Severus had not once met her for breakfast. At first, she’d been convinced he was dating someone in secret, and that he would tell her when he was ready. </p><p>But then Mary had been attacked by Mulciber and Lily had been on rounds that night. She had found Mary shaking and bleeding, her clothes slashed open in places meant to humiliate her. Lily knew this was one of Severus’ spells. She knew the ones he scribbled in his potions book and she knew that some of them he invented without ever intending them to be used. Sectumsempra was one of those. She doubted he would ever use it to hurt someone, but he had taught it to Mulciber, and even he could not be so naive to think that Mulciber would do no harm. </p><p>It was a stark reminder that there was a war on outside the castle, that people were going missing and everyone was too scared to go out alone and every other day the rumours got wilder. Lily found it difficult to worry about who was dating who and who was wearing what when she knew that she was never going to be safe outside the castle. And once Mary was attacked, she realised they maybe weren’t safe inside the castle either. </p><p>By the time Lily slipped into her seat in dungeon four twenty minutes later, she knew she had to confront Severus about who he was spending time with. She’d just had to stop Avery from harassing a terrified looking fourth year Ravenclaw and she had heard from one of the seventh year Hufflepuff prefects that Rosier had somehow wormed his way out of expulsion for the third time. </p><p>‘Evans, if you scowl at the desk any harder you’re going to burn a hole through it’ </p><p>‘You’re back’ Lily blinked up at the smirking figure of James Potter, and instantly regretted the words that had slipped out without thought as his smirk only grew more pronounced.</p><p>‘Missed me did you?’ he leant against her desk, ‘I didn’t think you cared’.</p><p>‘I don’t, but if I had to listen to Cynthia whine about missing Peter any more I was going to stuff her into the vanishing cabinet on the fourth floor’</p><p>‘Who knew you harbored such a violent streak Evans?’ </p><p>‘It’s amazing what six days of  hearing about Pettigrew’s snogging ability will drive a girl to’</p><p>‘Urgh, I can’t say I blame you for the violence then, that’s enough to drive someone to desperate measures’<br/>
</p><p>‘Isn’t he your friend?’</p><p>‘Yes and that is exactly why I don’t need to hear about his snogging capabilities’. </p><p>‘Whose snogging capabilities are we discussing?’ Remus asked with an air of faint interest, as he slid into the seat next to Lily. </p><p>‘Peters’ Lily said shortly, ‘it seems to be the only topic of conversation Cynthia is interested these days’ </p><p>‘Settle down all!’ Slughorn called, as he strode into the room, ‘we are starting something new today and I would appreciate your full and rapt attention’. </p><p>James winked at Lily before moving across to his table, where Cynthia, Peter and Sirius were already seated. </p><p>‘The potion we are starting on today is one that often comes up at OWL level; a hiccupping solution. I would like you to please attempt this potion with your partners, as I only have enough hippogriff claws for one between two. You can collect the necessary ingredients from the store cupboard, and the recipe is on page 43 of your books, please begin’ </p><p>There was a deafening scrape as half the class stood and began heading to the store cupboard. By the time Lily had returned, Remus had already set the flames to the correct temperature and started to boil water for the base of the potion. </p><p>‘Did we miss anything terribly important while we were gone?’ he asked as she set about shredding knottgrass.</p><p>Lily shook her head, ‘we finished the Pepper Up potions we were working on, and he let us keep them so we don’t have to bother Madam Pomfrey every time we get a cold now’, she smiled at him before dumping the knottgrass into the cauldron, ‘missing a few days is hardly going to put you massively behind, I wouldn’t worry’ </p><p>‘Our exams are in less than two months, I can’t help but worry’ Remus grimaced, peeling two leeches apart before unceremoniously chucking them in the now acid green concoction, ‘I’m not too worried about potions, what about Ancient Runes though?’ </p><p>It was Lily’s turn to grimace, ‘Professor Sage is giving a “surprise” test tomorrow, I’ll lend you my notes from last week’. </p><p>‘You’re a lifesaver’ Remus sighed, lazily stirring the potion, watching it pale with every counterclockwise stir. </p><p>‘I know you wouldn’t leave in the middle of term unless you had to’ she shrugged, ‘I doubt you missed five days of lessons just for the fun of it’ </p><p>A dark look passed across his face, before dropping his eyes back to the textbook in front of him. </p><p>‘No it wasn’t a fun trip’. </p><p>Lily smiled sadly to herself, noting the worried glances Remus kept throwing towards his friends, who had abandoned any pretense of doing work, and were throwing leeches at each other. </p><p>***</p><p>James dragged his feet as he slowly made his way back to Gryffindor tower, sore and exhausted from Quidditch practice. Abbott had driven them all into the ground, his determination not to lose the last game of the season was brought on mostly as they were playing Ravenclaw, his sister’s house, who had won every one of their games so far this year. </p><p>For all Abbott’s determination, James couldn’t really bring himself to care whether they won this game or not. Win or lose, they were either going to finish second or third, Ravenclaw had secured their first place when they beat Hufflepuff 540-30 in the last game before the Easter holidays.  Since his parents funeral, all James had really thought about, selfishly, was what was going to happen to him. He had no other family, no one to take him in over the summer, and he wouldn’t turn seventeen for nearly another year. </p><p>He kicked a stone plinth as he walked, frustrated beyond belief that he was stuck at Hogwarts forced to engage in lessons he had no interest in, study for things he would never use when he left school, and surrounded by scum like the Slytherins, half of whom were itching to join you-know-who the second they left. </p><p>‘Well if it isn’t the little orphan boy himself’ a sneering voice came from behind him, and before he could even turn, he felt himself hoisted into the air by his ankle, rotating slowly until he was practically nose to nose with his assailant, ‘not so tough when it isn’t four on one’ Snape continued, his sneer even more pronounced.</p><p>‘Oh fuck off Snivellus’ James spat, trying to reach his wand from where it was stuffed down his sock, ‘amazing how you can only get the upper hand when my back is turned’. </p><p>‘I could beat you in a duel with both hands tied behind my back’ </p><p>‘And yet you attack me from behind with no warning, really sporting of you’ James growled, his hand inching towards his wand<br/>
‘Ah now, none of that’ Snape said, jabbing has wand toward James’ hand, which immediately froze, wrapped around his wand, ‘I want to have a little talk, without you throwing curses around’ </p><p>‘So talk’ James said, trying to throw every ounce of contempt into those two syllables. He was angrier than he could ever remember being, incensed that he had been cornered like this by Snivellus of all people. </p><p>‘Stay away from Lily’. </p><p>James blinked stupidly, his surprise stopping him from struggling, ‘what did you say?’ </p><p>‘Stay. Away. From Lily’ Snape bit out, ‘I saw you in potions this morning, and I know what you’re doing’ </p><p>James let out a harsh laugh, ‘and what is it I’m doing exactly? Is it illegal to make friendly conversation with my house-mate?’ </p><p>‘The whole school knows you’ve got some pathetic crush on her’ the pale boy smirked, ‘but she’s much cleverer than you think. You can’t just mess up your hair and play with your snitch and make her fall for you’ </p><p>‘I don’t - you can’t think- I don’t fancy Lily Evans’ James spluttered, his face steadily growing redder, ‘you’re pathetic, you can’t get her to go out with you so you try and scare anyone else off going after her?’ </p><p>Snape practically snarled, before flicking his wand so James fell in a crumpled heap to the floor, shattering his glasses and knocking the wind out of him. </p><p>‘Stay away from her. She’s not going to be one of the girls who fawns over you just because you have a mediocre talent on the Quidditch pitch’</p><p>‘Yeah?’ James wheezed, ‘so why do you look so worried?’</p><p>He had a split second in which to regret his words when he was in no position to defend himself, before Snape muttered something and James felt as though his entire body had been doused in ice water. </p><p>Snape had vanished by the time James managed to push himself into a sitting position, and glancing down at his forearm he swore under his breath. Every inch of his usually dark skin was covered in purple, pulsating pustules. </p><p>Praying that Remus would know the countercurse, he began walking as fast as his legs would carry him to Gryffindor tower, hoping no one would be out in the corridors this close to curfew. Madam Pomfrey would blow her top if he went to the Hospital Wing with another curse related injury, and she would tell McGonagall, and he would not give Snape the satisfaction of running to a teacher. </p><p>‘Well I am definitely better looking than you now Prongs’ Sirius smirked as James dashed to the corner of the common room where his friends were sitting</p><p>‘Sod off Padfoot’ he snapped, ‘do you know the countercurse?’ he asked Remus, who was clearly trying not to laugh at his friend’s misfortune.</p><p>‘Who was it?’ Sirius asked, as Remus muttered the countercurse under his breath, and James sighed with relief as hot air seemed to blow over him.</p><p>‘Snape’ He scowled, ‘got me when my back was turned’. He dropped into the free armchair and Hades immediately jumped onto his knee, curling into a ball and purring. </p><p>‘That dirty little sneak’ Sirius said, ‘did you at least get him back?’ </p><p>‘No’ James replied shortly, throwing a grateful look at Peter who had repaired his glasses and was now handing them back, ‘The slime had run off by the time I managed to stand up’ </p><p>‘Well this calls for swift and brutal retaliation my friends’ Sirius grinned, flexing his fingers menacingly. </p><p>‘I think this probably was his retaliation for the hiccuping charm you put on him last week’ Remus said, not looking up from his book, ‘which was retaliation for the itching powder he threw over Peter during lunch the week before… Which was retaliation for the tapdancing hex I put on him the previous Monday..’ he trailed off, finally looking up to see his friends all glaring at him, ‘should I go on?’.</p><p>‘What exactly is your point Moony?’ Peter scowled, ‘he gives as good as he gets, it’s not our fault he doesn’t have any friends so it’s always four on one’. </p><p>‘By all means retaliate and earn yourselves another pointless detention’ Remus said with a wave of his hand, ‘but I won’t be involved this time - I’ve got too much studying to do’. </p><p>***</p><p>Sirius checked the map for the fourth time since he had left the dormitory. Remus had been taken to the willow two hours ago by Madam Pomfrey, but the sun wouldn't fully set until nine, a full hour away. He had left James and Peter in the common room playing exploding snap, with promises he would return in time for them to all slip under the invisibility cloak and make the journey to the shrieking shack.<br/>
The dots on the map all remained stationary; for all their hours in the library they had not managed to find a charm that would allow the map to monitor people in real time. For now though, this was enough- Severus Snape was heading out of the library towards the dungeons, entirely alone. </p><p>Sirius grinned before stuffing the map out of sight, and leaning against the cool stone wall, eyes trained on the corner from which he knew Severus would be emerging momentarily. </p><p>'Evening Snivellus' he drawled.</p><p>The pale boy started, his hand reaching immediately for his wand, but Sirius was ready;<br/>
'Expelliarmus!'</p><p>Snape's wand soared from his hand and towards Sirius, who caught it lazily and began to twirl it through the air, making it emit red and gold sparks. </p><p>'Now, I thought we could have a little chat about hexing people when their backs are turned' He said, his anger bubbling just below the surface of his apparently calm demeanor. </p><p>'Because you always fight fairly don't you Black' Snape drawled, irony dripping from his words. </p><p>'We always fight fairly' Sirius hissed, 'hexing someone with their back to you isn't a fight, it's an attack'. </p><p>'I just wanted to say something to him' Snape said, 'without him throwing curses around first'. He remained stood where he was when Sirius disarmed him, clearly afraid at his disadvantage. </p><p>'And what exactly did you want to say to him?' </p><p>'That's none of your business' </p><p>'You made it my business when you attacked my best friend' Sirius said, taking a threatening step towards Snape, sparks emitting from both wands clutched in his hands.</p><p>'He didn't even fight back' Snape sneered, 'where did you all vanish to the other day? It seems to have turned him into a total poof'</p><p>Sirius closed the gap between them in three quick strides, pushing Snape against the wall and ramming his wand under his chin. </p><p>'Don't talk about things you don't understand Snivellus, sticking your nose into things that don't concern you is an excellent way to get it broken'. </p><p>Snape appeared entirely unconcerned by his vulnerable position, his dark eyes trained on Sirius, barely blinking. 'Go on then Black. Hex me. Hex me while I'm standing here without my wand, no way of defending myself. Prove what a big man you are'.</p><p>Sirius was still for a moment, before he swore and tore his wand away. Stepping back, he threw the other boy's wand at the ground, contempt rolling off of him. 'You're not worth it' Sirius spat, 'you're a waste of time and magic'. He turned to leave, not expecting Snape to be so stupid twice in one week. </p><p>The jinx missed by less than an inch- Sirius actually felt his hair move as it rushed past. He turned and raised his wand in one smooth movement, 'You shouldn't have done that'.</p><p>With an almighty bang Snape was thrown backward and hit the wall, his head colliding against the stone with a nasty crack. Sirius was advancing on the pale boy, his rage fueling him, filling him with the desire to do as much damage as possible to the sallow skinned snake in front of him. </p><p>'Potter is going the same way as his parents' Snape wheezed, staggering to his feet, 'Pettigrew is a pathetic excuse for a wizard, and it's only a matter of time before everyone works out where Lupin goes every month' He was standing now, looking victoriously at Sirius’ livid expression, ‘You marauders think you’re invincible… But outside these walls you’re dead, and you know it’.</p><p>In that moment Sirius, for all his pure blooded background, completely forgot he was a wizard. He drew back his clenched fist and threw it solidly against Snape’s jaw, brimming with satisfaction as he crumpled back to the floor.</p><p>‘You really want to know where Lupin goes every month?’ Sirius hissed dangerously, leaning down to look directly into Snape’s dark eyes, ‘there's a knot at the base of the whomping willow. Press it, and you can get into the secret passage underneath’ Snape’s eyes widened, but Sirius didn’t stop; ‘Follow it, and you’ll find out for real what his secret is’. </p><p>With that, he turned on his heel and strode back to the common room, not once stopping to question what he had just done.</p><p>***</p><p>The first thing Remus became aware of was the hollow feeling in his stomach. Next was the incessant pounding of his head. The third, and most alarming thing, was the raised voices of the people around him. </p><p>‘He could have killed him you fucking idiot!’</p><p>‘But he didn’t!’ </p><p>‘No thanks to you; you were just going to let him walk down there to his death, weren’t you?’ There was a beat of silence followed by a frustrated noise that sounded alarmingly like a growl, ‘Did you even think about Remus?! Did you even think about what this would do to him?!’ </p><p>‘I didn’t think about anything at all evidently’ Sirius spat.</p><p>‘I didn’t think you had it in you Padfoot’ a third voice interjected quietly.</p><p>‘It was a prank’ came the exasperated reply</p><p>‘That wasn’t a prank’</p><p>‘Well not a very well thought out one I’ll admit’ </p><p>‘That wasn’t a prank, Sirius. It was almost a fucking murder’. Peter sounded angrier than Remus had ever heard him and it was that, more than anything, that made his blood run cold. </p><p>He couldn’t open his eyes. If he opened his eyes then they would all know he was awake and if he was awake then he would be told what happened. What he’d done. </p><p>‘I’m sorry’</p><p>‘No you’re not’ James said bitterly. </p><p>‘I am though’ </p><p>There was a beat. </p><p>‘Even if you are, it’s not me you have to apologise to’ </p><p>‘I’ll apologise to Remus when he-’ </p><p>‘Not Remus’ James snapped</p><p>‘Oh fuck off Prongs I’m not apologising to Snape’ Sirius exclaimed, his chair clattering to the floor as he stood suddenly.</p><p>‘Yes you are Mr Black’ came Dumbledore’s serene voice from the direction of the door, ‘I expect you, Mr Potter and Mr Pettigrew in my office in half an hour’. </p><p>‘But-’ </p><p>Whatever protest Peter had been about to utter was silenced before it began. Slowly Remus registered the sound of them gathering their cloaks to leave. A large, slightly clammy hand was gently laid on top of Remus’ right hand. He forced his breathing to remain even and his body to remain relaxed. </p><p>‘I really am sorry Moony’ Sirius whispered, squeezing his hand tight, as James and Peter’s footsteps retreated to the door, ‘You’re going to hate me when you wake up, and I won’t blame you’. </p><p>With one final squeeze, Sirius’s footsteps headed towards the door and Remus dared to breathe normally again. </p><p>‘No need to pretend to be asleep on my account Mr Lupin’ came Dumbledore’s kind voice. Remus jumped, his eyes flying open- he had assumed Dumbledore had left with the others. </p><p>‘You are wondering, I’m sure, what happened last night?’ </p><p>Remus felt frozen by fear. He didn’t want to know what had happened. This was the end, he was sure of it. He’d done so well, he’d lasted nearly five years at Hogwarts and no one was any the wiser about his condition, no one had ever gotten hurt. Just a month away from his OWLs and it had all crumbled- he was going to be expelled. </p><p>Slowly, reluctantly, he nodded. </p><p>‘You’ll be pleased to know that no one was hurt, first of all’ Dumbledore continued, seemingly oblivious to Remus’ inner turmoil, ‘It seems that Mr Black rather rashly informed Mr Snape what would happen if he pressed the knot at the base of the willow- teenage curiosity being as it is, Mr Snape immediately set out to test it for himself. Luckily, Mr Potter heard what Mr Black had done, and rushed to stop Severus before he could reach you’.  </p><p>‘He- he knows?’ Remus croaked, feeling extremely sick, ‘Snape knows?’. </p><p>Dumbledore nodded.</p><p>‘Mr Snape is now aware of your condition, yes’. He said, looking sympathetic, ‘He saw a glimpse of you in wolf form before Mr Potter managed to pull him back. He has been sworn, of course, to secrecy’.</p><p>Remus did not feel comforted. Snape hated him, hated all of them. He didn’t believe for one moment that Snape would be able to keep this to himself. If he knew, he would tell Lily for sur- oh, <em>Merlin</em>. Lily. They had their prefect duties together, they’d partnered each other in class ever since Peter and Cynthia had gotten together, he genuinely considered her one of his dearest friends outside the marauders. Would she ever be able to look at him after this? Knowing that he was a monster? That he nearly killed her best friend? </p><p>Perhaps Remus’ anguished disbelief showed on his face, as Dumbledore continued; ‘Mr Snape will not tell anyone- not even Miss Evans. He has been made fully aware of your situation and if he tells a soul he will be punished most severely’. </p><p>‘I could have killed him’ Remus said, tears now beginning to drip from the end of his long nose.</p><p>‘Yes’ Dumbledore said, not unkindly, ‘You could have, but you didn’t. We have Mr Potter to thank for that’. </p><p>Remus curled into a ball under his blanket, feeling queasy and faint. Dumbledore took this as his cue- </p><p>‘Now I must go and deal with your friends. In light of recent events, I don’t feel that this warrants exclusion or expulsion, as no one was hurt, and no lasting damage has been done’. He seemed to think this would be a comfort to Remus, as he smiled gently towards the sickly boy, before turning on the heel of his buckled boots and striding from the Hospital Wing in a whirl of midnight blue robes. </p><p>Remus couldn’t help but disagree- lasting damage had most definitely been done. How could he look at any of his friends the same again, knowing how close he came to killing someone?</p><p>***</p><p>Even Lily, absorbed as she was in her own problems, could hardly fail to notice that all four of the Gryffindor boys in her year were acting very strangely. None of them seemed to be talking to each other, choosing instead to sit elsewhere in classes for the first time in five years. Cynthia was absolutely beside herself;</p><p>‘Peter won’t tell me what happened, but it must be really bad- I’ve never seen him so cross’, she gossiped happily one morning at the beginning of June, while they waited for Dorcas to relinquish the bathroom. </p><p>‘It’s gotta be something to do with Snape’ Mary said, drying her hair with her wand, ‘I heard Potter saved him from whatever is down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow’.</p><p>‘I heard that too’ Cynthia replied thoughtfully, biting on her lip, ‘but why would they all fall out over that? Do you know anything Lily?’ </p><p>Lily had been waiting for this. She’d heard the rumours herself, and was furious that Severus hadn’t told her himself. Instead, she heard from Sylvia Harris, a particularly gossipy Ravenclaw, that her best friend had nearly died and not bothered to tell her. Sylvia had been delighted to know something before Lily, and was now spreading rumours that Lily and Severus had been secretly dating, but had now dramatically split up. Which was, apparently, the only logical explanation for them not speaking. </p><p>‘No’ Lily said shortly, grabbing her hairbrush and beginning to twist her frizzy hair into plaits, ‘He hasn’t said a thing to me’. </p><p>Lily pretended not to notice the look Mary and Cynthia shared at her waspish tone, instead casting quick glamour charms to hide the spots on her chin and shoving her feet into her heavy boots. </p><p>The more she thought about it, the more Lily realised that her relationship with her dorm mates all came down to the first Saturday they’d spent at Hogwarts, back in first year. The sun had been shining and the girls all wanted to go and sit by the lake, comparing their first week of lessons and discussing their classmates. Lily, had turned down the offer, choosing instead, to go to the library with Severus, and to hear how his first week had gone. </p><p>‘But he’s a <em>Slytherin</em>’ Dorcas had protested.</p><p>Lily had just shrugged,</p><p>‘He’s my best friend’.</p><p>It wasn’t the only time, of course. The girls invited Lily to play gobstones in the common room the same day Severus needed help with his Charms homework. Severus wanted to go for a walk around the lake while the girls gossiped in their bedroom. Lily went to Hogsmeade with Severus instead of with the girls the first time they’d been allowed to go in third year. On and on it went- why would she chose her dorm mates over Sev? She didn’t know them, and Sev always chose her over his housemates. At eleven she had firmly believed that her and Sev would be friends forever, so she didn’t need girlfriends too. </p><p>‘Well I hope they all make up soon’ Mary said, as if the silence hadn’t gotten terribly awkward, ‘I’ve been partnering Black in Transfiguration for over a week now and he’s turned my eyebrows yellow twice’.</p><p>Cynthia snorted, ‘Black could transfigure your hair into a platypus and dye your skin blue and you would still snog him senseless if he asked’. </p><p>‘I’m not denying he’s attractive’ Mary sniffed, shimmying into a skirt that definitely wouldn’t pass one of McGonagall’s uniform inspections, ‘But I’m with Caradoc now’. </p><p>It was Lily’s turn to snort, ‘You’re official now? Well I’m on prefect rounds tonight, so please chose your evening’s snogging location with care’. </p><p>Mary stuck her tongue out at Lily, ‘Because you’d never be caught dead snogging in a broom cupboard’. </p><p>‘You’re right’ Lily said with a wicked grin, ‘I’d never be <em>caught</em>’. </p><p>Cynthia dropped her wand, shooting sparks at her pillows, and Mary gasped ‘Lily!’. </p><p>Lily waggled her eyebrows and lapsed into giggles at their scandalised faces. </p><p>‘See you later!’ She called over her shoulder, leaving them to no doubt speculate who, exactly, Lily had been meeting in broom cupboards.<br/>
Her good mood lasted eight and a half minutes. Then she saw Severus emerging from the dungeon corridor, and for the first time in weeks, he was alone. Lily marched straight up to him, grabbed him around the elbow and lead him straight into the entrance hall and out the front doors to the empty courtyard. </p><p>‘Lily’ he protested weakly, ‘I have class- McGonagall…’ </p><p>‘You’ve been avoiding me’ She hissed, pulling him further away from the doors, ‘and I want to know why’</p><p>‘I’ve just been busy’ he stammered, ‘We don’t have to spend every second together any more Lily’ </p><p>‘You never had a problem with it before’ She said, eyebrows raised, ‘You’re trading me off for a bunch of wannabe death eaters, is that it?’ </p><p>‘So now you have a problem with my friends?’ Severus demanded, his stance turning defensive, ‘I thought we were supposed to be friends? Best friends?’</p><p>‘We are Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging around with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him Sev? He’s creepy! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?’ Lily leaned against the pillar in the shadowy corner of the courtyard, looking up into Severus’ face and searching it for answers. </p><p>‘That was nothing’, said Severus, ‘It was a laugh, that’s all-’ </p><p>‘It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny-’</p><p>‘What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?’ Demanded Severus, his cheeks flushing and his lips curving into a nasty sneer. </p><p>‘What’s Potter got to do with anything?’ Lily asked, not happy with the turn this conversation was taking. </p><p>‘They sneak out at night. There’s something weird about Lupin. Where does he keep going?’ </p><p>Lily had the distinct feeling Severus was attempting to walk her to a conclusion, and refused to rise to it. ‘He’s ill’ she said shortly, ‘They say he’s ill-’ </p><p>‘Every month at the full moon?’ Severus said, his eyebrows raised. </p><p>There it was, she thought irritably, ‘I know your theory’ she replied coldly, ‘Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they’re doing at night?’</p><p>‘I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are’. </p><p>He stared at her, and against her will, Lily could feel her face flushing under his scrutiny. </p><p>She looked away. </p><p>‘They don’t use Dark Magic though’, she said, before deciding to address the other elephant in the room, ‘And you’re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow and James Potter saved you from whatever’s down there-’</p><p>Severus turned a nasty puce colour and began spluttering; ‘Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends’ too! You’re not going to- I won’t let you-’ </p><p>‘Let me? Let me?’ Lily felt fury rise in her chest, her eyes narrowing in distaste. </p><p>‘I didn’t mean- I just don’t want to see you made a fool of- he fancies you. James Potter fancies you!’ He made a face as though the words tasted bad. </p><p>Lily’s eyebrows very nearly disappeared into her hairline with disbelief as he continued; ‘And he’s not- everyone thinks- Big Quidditch hero…’ </p><p>‘I know James Potter is an arrogant toerag’ She interrupted him, determined to get this conversation back to where it should be, ‘I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber and Avery’s idea of humour is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how you can be friends with them’.<br/>
The bell rang distantly and Lily swore. She hadn’t even had time to have breakfast. ‘I’ll talk to you later Sev, if I’m late for Runes again Professor Sage will have my head’. </p><p> </p><p>She ran off without a backward glance, totally missing the gleeful look on Snape’s face after he heard her insult James Potter. </p><p>*** </p><p>Twelve hours later found Lily patrolling the corridors alone- her doc marten boots making her footfalls heavy as she made her way down yet another empty hallway. Prefect rounds were rapidly becoming her least favourite way of spending an evening. Their O.W.Ls were coming up in less than a fortnight and any time not spent studying would much rather have been spent with Severus, now that they seemed to be back on semi-even footing after their conversation that morning. He had even come to sit next to her in potions for the first time since December, although it meant Remus had moved to an empty table at the back, looking at her with inexplicable sadness. As though he were disappointed. </p><p>She frowned at the thought. Remus was a wonderful friend- and a brilliant potions partner, he had never judged her for having a Slytherin best friend, why would he start now? Sad though she was that Remus had chosen to work alone rather than with her and Sev, she couldn’t bring herself to be sorry; she had missed her best friend so much it was as though she could finally breathe again. Sev was her ally, he would stand by her no matter what was going on outside the castle. Of this, she was sure. </p><p>Lily had just turned the corner into the Charms corridor when she walked straight into a very solid body. </p><p>‘Oof’ she huffed, bouncing backward, her arms flying up to grab at a very solid chest. ‘Oh Remus, I’m sorry I didn’t see you- Remus? Are you ok?’ </p><p>It was obvious he’d been crying. His eyes were puffy and his cheeks were distinctly blotchy.  She reached out towards his arm in concern, and he pulled away rapidly as if she burned him.</p><p>‘I’m fine Li- Evans. I’ll see you later’ He made to stride past her, but Lily- sick of secrecy and not likely to let her friend go anywhere while this upset- caught him around the elbow, and just like she’d done with Severus that morning, towed him behind her as she began to stride up the corridor.</p><p>‘Lily- what are you-? Aren’t you supposed to be doing rou-’ he broke off, looking at her in disbelief, ‘Lily this is a broom cupboard’.</p><p>‘So it is’ she replied airily, turning a mop bucket upside down and forcing Remus to sit on it. He could have stopped her quite easily, although Lily was tall herself, Remus had caught her up and overtaken her sometime in the last year, so that now the boy she once towered over stood a good several inches above her. </p><p>‘And what exactly do you think people will say if they find us in a broom cupboard while you’re supposed to be doing rounds?’</p><p>‘I’m sure they’ll think of something very inventive. I’ll probably find out tomorrow that I’m having a three-way relationship with you and Severus or something’. </p><p>‘You sound surprisingly blasé about that’ he said, eyebrow arching as she locked the door with a sharp tap of her wand.</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>‘People are always going to gossip about something at this school, might as well try to make it interesting’</p><p>Remus smiled, but it was a small thing, not reaching his eyes. Lily turned over another mop bucket and sat down opposite him. </p><p>‘Do you want to talk about it?’ She asked as gently as she could manage.</p><p>He looked up at her in surprise, ‘I didn’t think you would want to talk about it’ he said, ‘Not after Snape told you’.</p><p>‘Told me what?’ She asked, her brow furrowed, ‘Me and Sev hadn’t spoken for weeks until this morning’ </p><p>‘But, he came to sit with you in Potions?’ Remus said, ‘I thought he must have told you and you didn’t want to sit with me anymore once you found out that I’m -’ he trailed off. </p><p>Suddenly, something in Lily’s brain clicked. </p><p>‘Oh Merlin!’ She muttered, ‘Severus saw you, didn’t he? At the end of the tunnel? He knows now?’ </p><p>Remus was looking incredibly confused. </p><p>‘If he didn’t tell you then how the fuck do you know?’ He demanded. </p><p>Lily waved a vague hand. ‘I’ve known for ages’. </p><p>‘Bu- how- you?’ Remus was spluttering now, but she spoke over him. </p><p>‘That's why he kept talking about you this morning’ she said through gritted teeth, ‘Merlin and Agrippa I am going to kill him. I assume he was forbidden to tell anyone by Dumbledore?’ She asked, glancing at Remus. </p><p>She didn’t wait for confirmation before she ploughed on, ‘So he tried to slow walk me to the answer this morning without actually telling me and that’s why he kept changing the subject every time I tried to talk about-’</p><p>It was Lily’s turn to trail off. She twirled her wand around her fingers, looking concerned at Remus’ stupefied face. </p><p>‘Really Remus we’ve been at this school for five years and I’ve been doing prefect duties with you for the last few months, did you really think I wouldn’t work it out?’</p><p>‘Just to be clear’ Remus said, his voice a tad higher than usual, ‘you just willingly locked yourself in a broom cupboard with me when you know I’m a werewolf?’ </p><p>‘The full moon isn’t for another 10 days Remus, I very much doubt you’re about to maul me to death’. </p><p>He continued to stare at her. Lily threw up her hands in exasperation, ‘I was out of bed after curfew back in November and I knew that you were supposed to be ‘away because you were ill’, I knew it was a full moon and I saw Madam Pomfrey walking you across the grounds. It didn’t take a genius after that’. </p><p>‘Why didn’t you tell him?’</p><p>‘Who?’</p><p>‘Snape. He’s suspected me since third year, why didn’t you tell him when you found out he was right?’ </p><p>‘Would you rather I had?’ Lily asked, smirking. She sighed when it became obvious he wasn’t going to respond. ‘Because he’s been raised to believe that werewolves are dangerous half-breeds. And he already doesn’t like you because of who you’re friends with. I know you, Remus, not the creature, the boy who shares his chocolate with me when we’ve got exams’ she smiled at him, ‘Did you really think that this would end our friendship?’ </p><p>Remus was blushing now, his hand tugging through his hair- a mannerism so clearly picked up from James that it made Lily smile. </p><p>‘I’m sorry I didn’t tell you myself’ he said ruefully, ‘I should have known you’d take it better than most people’.</p><p>‘Yes you should have’ Lily said in a dignified tone, ‘but I can hardly begrudge you for keeping a secret. We all do it’. </p><p>‘Speaking of’, he began, ‘I have one more question’</p><p>‘Wouldn’t be you if you didn’t’ she smiled, nudging him with the toe of her boot, his face breaking out into the first true, proper smile she had seen in weeks.</p><p>‘What exactly were you doing out of bed after curfew?’</p><p>Lily laughed loudly and stood to unlock the door. </p><p>‘I’ll see you tomorrow Remus’ she grinned, heading out to finish her rounds. </p><p>She was halfway down the corridor before she heard him cry, ‘That wasn’t an answer!’ </p><p>***</p><p>Over the next several days Lily became convinced that James Potter and Sirius Black were deliberately trying to drive her mad.<br/>
Their exams were just over a week away, and the two Gryffindor boys spent entire lessons charming her hair so it flashed different colours, sending tripping jinxes at Severus and generally irritating anyone they came into contact with. </p><p>Many of the first and second years found them very funny- they weren’t worried about exams or being dumped or their best friends telling the whole school a secret that could ruin another friend’s life. </p><p>This, more than anything, was weighing on her mind. Remus was withdrawn, distracted, not his usual self at all. While he didn’t quite strut with the arrogance of Potter or bounce around with the energy of Peter on their average day- he was usually friendly, upbeat despite everything, and a friend to all. To see him so miserable was breaking Lily’s heart. </p><p>She began to sit with him in every lesson, quirking an eyebrow at Severus and daring him to comment when Remus’ cauldron found it’s way on to their desk six days before the start of their exams. She asked Alice to re-do the prefect schedules so they would always be together during rounds, and made sure there was plenty of chocolate for them to share when their study sessions lasted late into the night. </p><p>‘I don’t need your pity’ he snapped, one day he’d been looking particularly tense, ‘You don’t need to spend all your time with me’.<br/>
Lily raised her eyebrows at him and he had the decency to look sheepish. </p><p>‘I’m sorry’ he said, looking down at his textbook, ‘It’s just, James came to talk to me today’. </p><p>She shifted her chair slightly so her back was to Madam Pince before responding, </p><p>‘Begging you to forgive Sirius again?’ </p><p>‘No- well. Yes’. Remus sighed, ‘James says that Sirius is really sorry, and that he wasn’t thinking straight and wouldn’t have done it if it weren’t for-’ he broke off, looking awkward. </p><p>‘For whatever mysterious circumstances lead you all to leave the castle for a week last month?’ Lily concluded, having figured as much herself. </p><p>Remus looked at her gratefully. She hadn’t asked where they’d gone- she could hazard a pretty good guess and she’d never been much of a gossip anyway. </p><p>‘They’re acting out’ Remus said, sadly, ‘They’re not dealing with it- just making life more difficult for everyone else’.</p><p>‘Has Sirius actually apologised to you himself?’ </p><p>‘Yes. Well- he apologised when he thought I was asleep in the hospital wing’. </p><p>‘That doesn’t count’ Lily said indignantly. </p><p>‘I know but-’</p><p>‘No, Remus’. She said, crossly, ‘He needs to apologise properly. It was a horrid, impulsive, childish thing he did- using someone else’s secret to get what he wanted’. </p><p>‘I know’ He sighed again., ‘I just miss them’. </p><p>Lily laid a careful hand over one of his, ‘I hate that this is hurting you so much. You’ll tell me, won’t you, if there is anything I can do?’.<br/>
Remus smiled and lay his other hand over hers, squeezing gently. ‘I will. Lil- I’ve just got to wait for Sirius to buck up and apologise to me instead of sending James to do it’. </p><p>That day didn’t seem likely to come though, and Lily was incensed the very next day when she caught Remus sat with the other boys by the fire. Even Peter, who had been spending the majority of his time with Cynthia lately, was lounging by the fire and using his wand to flick old quills into the fire. Lily caught Remus’ eye and inclined her head, silently asking if Sirius had finally managed that apology. Remus shook his head minutely and Lily's eyes bulged. He shook his head again, looking at her pointedly. She sighed; she wanted what was best for him, but if he wanted to excuse their behaviour for whatever reason, then there was really nothing she could do. </p><p>She smiled at him, in what she really hoped was a supportive manner, and bent back over her textbook. A loud bang issued from by the fire and Lily looked up, startled, to see Potter and Black laughing uproariously at Peter, who was covered in what looked like stinksap. Remus was also splattered, the books he had been working from now slimy and ruined. </p><p>Their exams started tomorrow. Tomorrow. And instead of studying, like the rest of them, or at least leaving everyone to study in peace, they had to draw attention to themselves and show off. Lily was enraged, her stomach had been twisting all day in a weird mix of exam nerves and anxiety about Severus, and now she wanted nothing more than to waltz over there and hex Potter into oblivion.<br/>
But she resisted. </p><p>Gathering her books in the most dignified manner she could muster, she scrambled through the portrait hole and made it as far as the statue of Gregory the Smarmy before she burst into tears. </p><p>Lily could count on one hand the number of times she had cried in the last few years. And at least half of those were due to something Petunia had said or done. But she was just so tired and stressed and worried that it all came out now, and she leaned against the statue, and cried.</p><p>***</p><p>Monday morning dawned bright and clear- it was obviously going to be a swelteringly hot day and the fifth years could all be seen throwing dirty glances out of the windows, is if it were somehow the weathers’ fault that they would be taking exams all day.<br/>
Lily felt sick. </p><p>The first exam of the day was Ancient Runes- her absolute worst subject. She had only taken it back in third year because Benjy Fenwick from the year above tutored younger students and she had the most ridiculous crush on him. It was a moment of girlish weakness and she’d been suffering the consequences for two years now- pass or fail, she would be dropping the class before N.E.W.TS.<br/>
She knew, really, that the twisting of her stomach wasn’t due to exams. It was Severus. She had been so pleased that they were friendly again that she hadn’t had the heart to confront him about his newfound knowledge of Remus’ condition. Really, she thought, they hadn’t even properly discussed Mulciber’s attack on Mary. </p><p>He had found it funny. He compared it to the pranks Potter and his friends pulled, but she could never, ever imagine James Potter tormenting a girl and leaving her mortified and bleeding in the middle of a corridor. He was an arrogant bastard and he got on her last nerve regularly, but he wasn’t cruel. </p><p>What Mulciber had done to Mary was cruel. </p><p>Three hours later Lily was absolutely positive she had failed the exam, but somehow the knowledge made her feel lighter; there was hardly any point to stressing about it now. </p><p>She had spent most of the exam mentally preparing herself to talk to Severus. (who cared what the proper pronunciation of “wunjō” was anyway?). She had to do it now, before she lost her nerve. She couldn’t take a whole week of exams with this hovering over her head too. Her stomach churning, she caught his eye in the Great Hall at lunchtime, and inclined her head towards the door. He immediately stood, abandoning his half eaten sandwich and hurrying over to meet her. </p><p>‘How was Runes?’ He asked as soon as he drew level with her, and she couldn’t help but make a disgusted noise as they headed out of the hall together, missing the smirks of their classmates. </p><p>‘That bad eh?’ He smiled knowingly. ‘That’ll teach you to choose subjects based on whose tutoring them’ he teased. She snorted,<br/>

‘Says you- how many lessons of Muggle Studies did you take just because Matilda Burke was in them?’ </p><p>‘Three’ he sniffed, ‘and I was taking it to learn about your heritage too’</p><p>‘Sev, you practically lived at my house from the age of nine onwards’</p><p>‘And yet I still don’t know how aeroplanes stay up without a hover charm on them’ </p><p>‘I’ll give you Petunia’s old science textbooks’ she grinned, before her smile faded. For a moment, she’d forgotten why they were out here. Their old, friendly banter came so naturally to her that she’d forgotten that things weren’t normal between them. Not really.<br/>

She took a deep breath to steel herself. </p><p>‘Are you going to tell anyone now you know about Remus?’. </p><p>A slow smile spread over his face, he looked so proud of himself it that Lily actually took a minute step back.<br/>

‘I knew you’d work it out’ he breathed, stepping right into her personal space, ‘You’re brilliant Lily, brilliant, I knew you’d realise what the half-breed really is… How long have you known?’</p><p>‘Eight months’ </p><p>The grin on Severus’ face slid off. His usually pale face was turning a nasty red colour and Lily’s fingernails were cutting into her palm, her heart going rather quickly.</p><p>‘Eight months?!’ He began, ‘I’ve known for sure for two weeks, why on earth didn’t you tell me Lil?!’ When Lily didn’t reply he continued, ‘I could have died, Lily. If you’d told me I would never have gone down that tunnel!’. </p><p>‘You went down that tunnel because you thought you could get Remus expelled’ Lily spat, her heartbeat thundering in her ears,‘What has he ever done to you anyway?’  </p><p>‘He’s a monster Lily!’ </p><p>‘So am I for a few days of the month but you don’t hold it against me’ she said sarcastically.</p><p>Severus flushed deep red and Lily felt a stab of vindictive pleasure.</p><p>‘You can’t seriously be friends with him now?’ He demanded, his stark disbelief showing on his face. </p><p>‘I can and I am’ Lily said shortly, her tone garnering no argument, ‘And you’re just going to have to learn to live with it’ </p><p>‘He- but- he could kill you!’ Snape spluttered</p><p>‘And so could any of those death eater friends of yours but you still hang out with them’</p><p>Snape gaped at her. </p><p>‘It’s different’ he said finally, ‘my friends are human’.</p><p>The way he stressed the last word made Lily’s stomach turn. How could he hate Remus so blindly that he didn’t even consider him to be human? How could this kind, shy boy she had grown up with, relied on for so long, grown up to be so full of hatred?</p><p>‘Your friends barely think I qualify as human, much less a witch, so if you refuse to be civil to Remus, perhaps you shouldn’t be talking to me either’. </p><p>‘Don’t be ridiculous Lily of course they think you’re human’ he said, in a long-suffering voice as though Lily was being deliberately difficult, ‘besides, they couldn’t hurt me, I can protect myself’</p><p>Perhaps he realised his mistake when he noticed the sudden narrowing of Lily’s eyes, or perhaps because her wand -which was still gripped in her hand- shot sparks at him, narrowly avoiding setting him alight.</p><p>‘Lil- I didn’t mean- I know you can protect yourself-’ He was stammering now, and Lily was so outraged her brain seemed to have jammed- ‘-I just can’t let you be friends wit- I mean that -’</p><p>‘You mean what, exactly?’ She began, shaking with anger, ‘That you can be friends with as many sick, twisted, evil people as you please, but poor, defenceless Lily can only have you? That I can’t befriend a boy who has had a horrid life without your permission?’ </p><p>‘No, Lil-’</p><p>‘Because it seems to me that you’re so busy trying to make sure I don’t have any friends but you, that you ignore every legitimate complaint I have about your supposed “mates”’. </p><p>‘What complaints?’ He demanded, ‘You haven’t said-’</p><p>‘Mucliber, Avery, Nott, Travers, Rosier’ she reeled off, ‘In the last six months every single one of them has used their pure-blood connections to worm their way out of expulsion’.</p><p>‘So?’ Snape asked incredulously, ‘they muck about a bit, we’re teenagers it’s what we’re supposed to do’ </p><p>Lily began to talk very fast- she needed this off her chest like it was a sickness cloying in her lungs. ‘Mulciber tore Mary’s blouse open and left her bleeding in a corridor. Avery hexed David Smith so badly he spent two weeks in the hospital wing before they could wake him up. Nott shoved Mandy Dunbar over the banister of the astronomy tower staircase and broke both of her legs. Travers and Rosier rigged Fiona Hill’s cauldron to explode while they were making drought of the living dead- thank Merlin she’s shite at potions or she would probably be dead’. </p><p>She paused to take a breath and ploughed on before Severus could interrupt her; ‘What do all those victims have in common Sev?’ She demanded, ‘They’re all the fucking muggleborns in our year’ she spat. ‘Except me’. </p><p>He didn’t meet her eye. It was as though her worst fears had been realised. </p><p>‘Is that the deal then?’ She asked sadly, ‘you tell them all the dark spells you make up and then they leave me alone?’. </p><p>‘I’m just-’ he began, ‘I’m just trying to protect you’. His voice broke feebly. </p><p>‘I don’t need your protection Snape’ she said, disgustedly, ‘Not like this’. </p><p>Without another word, she turned on her heel and strode away. </p><p>***</p><p>‘We could fill the Great Hall with frogs’</p><p>‘We did that in second year’ </p><p>‘Glitter in all the Slytherin’s food?’</p><p>‘Fourth year, Avery threw up glitter all over the Quidditch pitch, remember?’ </p><p>‘We could transfigure Mrs Norris into a tiger?’</p><p>‘She’s lethal enough as a cat thanks’. </p><p>Sirius sighed, ‘Well what do you suggest then?’ </p><p>‘We could charm shampoo bottles to follow Snape around until he actually washes his hair?’ </p><p>‘I doubt Lily would see the funny side’ Sirius pointed out, eyebrow cocked. </p><p>‘What on earth has she got to do with anything?’ James said, running his hand through his hair casually. </p><p>‘You think I haven’t noticed that you spend every lesson showing off in front of her?’ </p><p>‘I don’t- you- Why does everyone think I fancy Evans?!’ </p><p>‘Who is this “everyone”?’ Sirius sniggered. </p><p>‘Snape’ James said shortly, ‘It’s what he wanted to ‘discuss’ when he turned me into a walking pustule the other week’. </p><p>Sirius looked bewildered, ‘Why would it have anything to do with him? They aren’t actually dating are they? I thought that was just Sylvia making shite up as usual?’ </p><p>‘I don’t know’ James said grumpily, ‘Can you just drop it?’. </p><p>Sirius looked like he wanted to argue, but James’ tone garnered no argument. </p><p>James didn’t want to admit that he had spent an awful lot of time lately wondering just that- Snape had been sending jinxes his way every time his back was turned, and James was retaliating. Every time James so much as lent too close to Lily during Charms he would find his chair collapsing, or his feet stuck together, or once, his eyebrows vanished.  </p><p>Not that Snape was getting off lightly- just this week James had managed to get him with three tripping jinxes, a pretty good jelly-legs and he’d managed to charm his uniform to Gryffindor colours. </p><p>It seemed to James that Snape acted like a jealous boyfriend- and yet Lily had seemed so miserable lately. She was spending an awful lot of time with Remus lately too, but Snape didn’t seem to be hexing him at any given moment. </p><p>‘Hello’ came a timid sort of voice from behind them, ‘I’m supposed to give these to James Potter and Sirius Black’. A small mousey first-year was holding out envelopes to both of them. With a glance to Sirius, James opened his. </p><p>
  <em>Dear Mr Potter,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I would like to see you in my office at 7pm. It is regarding your accommodations over the summer. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Professor McGonagall</em>
</p><p>‘Is this her only just realizing we’re essentially homeless?’ Sirius snorted, ‘It’s been almost a month’.</p><p>‘You aren’t even close to being homeless’ James pointed out, ‘You know Alphard would take you in if you were desperate and if Andromeda has offered once she’s offered a hundred times’. </p><p>‘Alphard is ill, he wrote me last week to say he couldn’t take me, much as he’d love to, just to spite my mother’. </p><p>‘And Andy?’ </p><p>‘Nymphadora is only three, and they don’t have much room. They don’t need me crashing on their sofa for six weeks and getting in the way’. He sounded bitter, much more bitter than James felt he had any right to be- at least he still had two family members left.<br/>
‘Well we’d better get going, it’s almost quarter to seven already’.</p><p>The two boys grabbed their bags and headed out of the portrait hole. There weren’t many people around, exams wouldn’t be over for another two days, so most people were tucked away in their common rooms, studying.</p><p>When they reached McGonagall’s office they shifted uneasily, having a wordless conversation over who was going to knock. </p><p>‘Oh for goodness sake just come in already’ came McGonagall’s voice from the other side of the door.  </p><p>They both jumped, </p><p>‘How does she do that?’ Sirius muttered as they pushed the door open and entered. </p><p>They settled themselves in the chairs in front of McGonagall’s desk, from behind which she was peering at them over her glasses. </p><p>‘It has come to my attention that neither of you have anywhere to stay over the summer’ she began, in a no-nonsense tone. ‘I have been in contact with Gringotts and it appears Mr Potter, that your parents charmed your inheritance so it can only be claimed once you have left school’. </p><p>‘Yes Professor’ </p><p>‘And Mr Black you have been entirely cut off from your family, is that correct?’ </p><p>‘Yes Professor’ </p><p>Both boys were staring at the floor, shamefaced and not at all the proud, pure blooded men their parents had raised them to be.<br/>
‘Dumbledore has been in contact with the governors and we are going to make arrangements for you to stay at the school over the summer’<br/>
Their heads shot up and they stared at her, amazed.</p><p>‘Stay… here?’ Sirius could hardly believe their luck, ‘I thought you were going to send us to some kind of orphanage or something!’.<br/>
McGonagall smiled faintly, ‘No, Mr Black, if you were younger, then yes, perhaps somewhere with adult supervision would be best. But you are both almost of age, you’re bright boys who’ve had a stroke of rotten luck- Dumbledore sees no reason why you shouldn’t be allowed to stay’.</p><p>‘Who else will be here?’ James asked. </p><p>‘The house elves live here year round- as does Dumbledore. Most other teachers do not stay over the summer, although I live in Hogsmeade, so I will be available if needed’.  </p><p>‘Will we be able to leave the castle? To go visit Remus and Peter?’ </p><p>‘You will- you can take the knight bus anywhere you like, but I must ask that you let Dumbledore know if you’re leaving the castle.’</p><p>‘Can we use magic?’ Sirius asked eagerly, ‘I know we’re not of age but-’ </p><p>McGonagall held up a hand and Sirius fell silent, </p><p>‘The answer to that Mr Black is two-fold. I will trust you to use magic only when necessary- I urge you to use your common sense, if I return to the school to find you’ve burnt down the Gryffindor common room or flooded the kitchens then you will not be permitted to stay at the castle alone again’.</p><p>Sirius looked like Christmas had come early. </p><p>‘Will the library be open to us?’ James asked, and Sirius looked at him disgustedly. </p><p>‘You will be able to use the library yes’, McGonagall said suspiciously, ‘I would like you to leave a note of any books you borrow and when you returned them for Madam Pince to check when she returns’. </p><p>James nodded quietly, still looking at his knees. He wasn’t nearly as excited as Sirius at the prospect of staying at Hogwarts over the summer- really, he would prefer to be going home to his parents like everyone else. Sirius, however, hated his house, he would rather sleep on the streets than go back to Grimmauld Place. </p><p>‘I think that’ll be all’, McGonagall said after a beat of silence, ‘You can ask any other questions you think of over the next few weeks before term ends’. </p><p>They thanked her and stood to leave, but James lingered, sending Sirius ahead of him. </p><p>‘Professor’, he began, ‘I wanted to ask…’ he hesitated, scuffing his toe against the leg of the chair Sirius had just vacated.<br/>

‘You want to know if the aurors found anything suspicious about your parents death’. </p><p>He nodded. ‘I know they were old’ he said quickly, ‘and I know that Dragon Pox can kill you quickly when you are that age, but I don’t understand where they can have gotten it from- they hardly ever left the house’. </p><p>McGonagall sighed- ‘The aurors have not concluded their report yet, but yes, it looks like someone may have introduced to virus into your household somehow’. </p><p>James felt his heart sink through to the floor. </p><p>‘I’m telling you this because I don’t see the benefit in hiding it from you’, McGonagall said frankly, ‘Your mother was an incredibly powerful witch- she was an auror for over 50 years, I think you know that there are people who would see her as an adversary to be rid of in the current climate’. </p><p>James nodded glumly, ‘Death Eaters’. </p><p>‘We don’t know anything for sure yet James’, the use of his first name surprised him enough that he looked up, meeting her eye for the first time since he stepped foot into the office, ‘I don’t think a single death eater could have taken your mother down in a fair fight, that’s for sure’. </p><p>James laughed weakly, ‘I did say once they should let mum go after you-know-who, he’d be dead within the week’.<br/>

‘Your mother was Prefect, Head Girl and Quidditch Captain in her day’ McGonagall said fondly, ‘she was the bravest woman I ever met, I always said she should have been in Gryffindor’ </p><p>‘Yeah, she never did let me live it down when I got sorted into Gryffindor like Dad, instead of Slytherin like her’. </p><p>‘They would be very proud of you’ said McGonagall- ‘You have handled this very maturely’.</p><p>James blushed, suddenly becoming very interested in the fingernails on his right hand. </p><p>He didn’t feel mature. On the contrary, he had never felt so incredibly young. </p><p>‘Now, don’t you have some studying to be doing?’ McGonagall said, returning to her usual brisk tone. </p><p>‘Thank you Professor’, James said quietly, turning to let himself out of the office. </p><p>***</p><p>Their second to last exam was Defence Against the Dark Arts. It was Thursday morning and Lily couldn’t remember the last time she had been so relieved for a week to be almost over. At 1pm tomorrow, she wouldn’t have to worry about school work until September, a blissful three months away.  </p><p>‘I think we should take a picnic out onto the grounds after the exam’ Mary was saying as she twisted her dark hair into two plaits, ‘it's going to be an absolutely beautiful day’. </p><p>‘Ohh yes!’ Cynthia cried from the bathroom, poking her head around the door- ‘Let's go swimming in the lake, we haven’t done that since third year!’. </p><p>Lily, who was reading over her DAtDA notes so fast her eyes appeared to be blurring, wasn’t listening to them. At least not until one of Dorcas’ trainers hit the side of her head;</p><p>‘Oi! Earth to Lily!’. </p><p>‘What was that for?’ whined Lily, rubbing her ear, ‘you could have just said something!’. </p><p>‘I did’ Dorcas snorted, ‘twice. Now, are you going to come for a picnic and swim with us after the exam?’. </p><p>She gave Lily a searching look. Of all their housemates Lily had always felt Dorcas was the most perceptive. While Lily hadn’t told any of them about her disagreement with Snape, Dorcas seemed to instinctively know that something was wrong. </p><p>This was an olive branch, Lily thought. An invitation to spend time with them outside of their dorm or classes. </p><p>‘That sounds lovely’ Lily smiled, ‘I’ve got some ginger beer left from the last time I went to a muggle shop- I’ll bring that shall I?’. </p><p>‘Ginger beer?’ Dorcas said, wrinkling her nose, ‘What on earth is that?’ </p><p>‘It is a picnic staple is what it is!’ Mary said fervently, ‘Although there aren’t enough of us to be the Famous Five’ she pointed out to Lily.<br/>
Dorcas and Cynthia were looking very confused. </p><p>‘We could turn Sirius into a dog?’ Lily suggested, ‘he could be our Timmy?’. </p><p>For some reason Dorcas found this very funny. </p><p>‘No books’ Mary said, looking between pointedly at Dorcas, ‘we can study for Transfiguration tonight in the common room- it’ll do us good to get out in the sun for a while’ </p><p>Dorcas rolled her eyes and slid her transfiguration book back into her bedside cabinet.<br/>
‘Fine’ she said, ‘but one of you had better test me later’. </p><p>It was everyone else’s turn to roll their eyes,<br/>

‘Why? You’re already going to get an O’ Cynthia said incredulously, ‘You’re top of the year at Transfiguration!’<br/>

‘Second’ Dorcas sniffed, ‘James is ahead of me’. </p><p>Lily raised her eyebrows at the tall girl's expression, ‘Why does that matter?’ she asked, ‘Surely it’s the exam result that you need to be worried about?’. </p><p>Lily didn’t feel the need to compete with her classmates- possibly why the sorting hat hadn’t put her in Ravenclaw or Slytherin. As far as she was concerned, she would work to the best of her ability, and if someone else was better than her, well, bully for them. </p><p>‘I just want to prove that his “natural ability” isn’t better than actually studying’ Dorcas said crossly, ‘McGonagall raves about him but I don’t think he’s opened a book in the last three years!’</p><p>Lily could see her point. Dorcas was top of the year in most every subject, not because she was the most naturally gifted, but because she was the most diligent, hard working witch Lily had ever met. </p><p>‘I’ll see you later’ Lily said, ‘I want to read these notes while I have breakfast’. </p><p>‘We’ll meet you by the sycamore tree at the edge of the lake after the exam alright?’ Mary said, curling her eyelashes around her wand. </p><p>*** </p><p>The exam went better than Lily could ever have hoped. While not her best subject by any means (changing teachers every year was hardly indicative of a good learning environment), she was pretty sure she had just achieved an ‘O’ for Defense Against the Dark Arts. </p><p>She headed out to meet her dorm mates feeling as though she was floating- the sun was beating down against her neck and she shrugged her robes off to walk across the lawn in just her skirt and blouse. Transfiguration was all that was left, and Lily felt privately that she would achieve at least an ‘E’, even if she didn’t study at all that evening. </p><p>‘Hi!’ she called out to the girls who were all sunning themselves by the edge of the water, ‘I brought crisps!’ </p><p>She dumped the bag holding bottles of ginger beer and ready salted crisps at the edge of Mary’s towel, before toeing off her shoes and flopping down next to them. </p><p>‘Hey Lil- what did you think of question 7?’ Dorcas asked, reclining to look up at Lily. </p><p>‘The one about vampires? I put-’ </p><p>Cynthia put her hands over her ears and began to sing tunelessly. </p><p>Dorcas threw up her hands in defeat, ‘ok, OK!’ she said, tugging Cynthia’s hands away from her ears, ‘No post exam discussion here’.</p><p>‘We’re supposed to be relaxing’  Mary pointed out, stretching luxuriously on her towel, ‘What’s the point of discussing the exam now? We can’t change our answers’ </p><p>‘It’s a good way of learning’ Dorcas argued, ‘If I know I got something wrong I’ll know what the answer is next time’ </p><p>‘<em>Merlin</em> you should have been a Ravenclaw’ Cynthia sniggered.</p><p>Dorcas didn’t answer. Instead she picked up one of the bottles of ginger beer and took a deep swig. </p><p>And promptly spat it back out. </p><p>‘What in Agrippa’s name is that?!’ She cried, foam dripping from her nose, ‘I thought you said it was good!’ </p><p>Mary and Lily were paralyzed with laughter, Lily had forgotten that fizzy drinks didn’t exist in the wizarding world, and Dorcas had most definitely not been expecting it. </p><p>Dorcas was now wiping her streaming eyes and nose on a handkerchief she summoned from thin air- looking very disgruntled. </p><p>‘I’m so sorry Dorcas’ Lily said, blotting her own eyes on the end of her tie, ‘I didn’t think to warn you it was fizzy!’ </p><p>‘Muggles are so weird’ Dorcas said fervently, ‘why on earth would you want a drink that feels like it’s burning your mouth?!’</p><p>‘Try taking a smaller sip, now you’re expect-’ Lily broke off. </p><p>She could hear a commotion behind her and it sounded like- </p><p>‘Oh fuck no’, she breathed, turning around the survey the scene a little way along the shore. </p><p>The others had turned around too at her whispered curse. </p><p>‘Lily, don’t-’ Cynthia began, ‘You’ll just make it worse-’.</p><p>But Lily wasn’t listening. Rage was pounding in her ears and she was furious- why? Why couldn’t they just knock it off for five minutes? Why couldn’t they all just sit by the lake like civilized people for five minutes?</p><p>She stood, and without consciously telling her legs where to go, found herself storming up the lawn, just in time to see Severus gagging, choking on soapy suds that were pouring from his mouth…</p><p>‘Leave him ALONE!’ she yelled over the cheers and laughter of surrounding students, she was pleased to see some of them were looking shifty now, others were moving away entirely. </p><p>‘All right Evans?’ James said, ruffling his hair casually, his voice going ridiculously deep. </p><p>‘Leave him alone’ she repeated, her eyes narrowing to slits at James, who was looking wildly unconcerned by the entire situation. ‘What’s he ever done to you?’</p><p>‘Well,’ he began thoughtfully, ‘it’s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean’.</p><p>Lily did know. She had spent the last four days wanting to hex Severus into a literal ball of slime- but she didn’t, because attacking him unprovoked would make her no better than him and his so called ‘mates’. </p><p>‘You think you’re funny’ Lily said coldly, ‘but you’re just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him alone’.</p><p>‘I will if you go out with me Evans’ James said quickly, ‘Go on… Go out with me and I’ll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again’.</p><p>Lily gaped at him, ‘I wouldn’t go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid’ she spat, trying not to focus on how pleased Severus looked as she said it. </p><p>‘Bad luck Prongs’ Sirius said, before turning back to Severus and crying ‘Oi!’ </p><p>There was a flash of light and suddenly, Lily was horrified to see, James’ robes were splattered with blood. </p><p>In a movement too fast for her to follow, one of the Gryffindors- Lily would never be able to tell who- had Severus dangling upside down by his ankle.</p><p>It took everything in her to repress a satisfied smirk when his graying underwear was put on show to the surrounding crowd. He had clearly forgone trousers today due to the repressive heat, and was now dearly paying the price. </p><p>‘Let him down!’ she shouted, feeling that all of this had gone on long enough. </p><p>‘Certainly’ smirked James, and Severus came crashing down to the ground in a heap.</p><p>‘<em>Petrificus Totalus</em>’ cried Sirius, and Snape fell forward rigid as a board.</p><p>‘LEAVE HIM ALONE!’ Lily cried again, drawing out her own wand now, </p><p>‘Aw Evans don’t make me hex you’ James said earnestly, </p><p>‘Take the curse off him, then!’ she said, jabbing her wand towards him to make her point. </p><p>James sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the counter-curse. </p><p>‘There you go’ he said as Severus struggled to his feet, ‘You’re lucky Evans was here Snivellus-’</p><p>‘I don’t need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!’ </p><p>It might have hurt less if he had crucioed her. </p><p>She blinked stupidly, trying to process what he’d just said.</p><p>‘Fine’. She said stiffly, ‘I won’t bother in future. And I’d wash your pants if I were you Snivellus’.</p><p>It was petty- so very petty and beneath her but she couldn’t help but smile as he flushed at the taunt. She had spent so long, so long making excuses for him, standing up for him, and all along he had thought of her as a mudblood. </p><p>‘Apologise to Evans!’ Roared James indignantly, his wand raised threateningly. </p><p>‘I don’t want you to make him apologise’ Lily shouted, raising her own wand again, ‘you’re just as bad as he is!’ </p><p>‘What?’ yelped James, ‘I’d NEVER call you a- you-know-what!’ </p><p>Lily was looking at Remus now, who was very deliberately not meeting her eye. He was looking pale and wan- the full moon was only two days away and he must have been feeling terrible. He was her fellow prefect, he should have stopped this before it happened; but he was so afraid of losing his friends that he sat silent, letting them walk all over him. Lily’s stomach turned over and she span around the face James, her wand raised threateningly;</p><p>‘Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you’ve just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can - I’m surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK’. </p><p>She turned on her heel and hurried away, before she could do something she might regret, like hexing them all into oblivion.<br/>
‘Evans!’ she heard James shout after her, ‘Hey EVANS!’.</p><p>She didn’t turn back. Instead she marched right over to where her dorm mates were sitting, open mouthed and staring at the scene in front of them. She snatched up her things and muttered ‘see you later’, before hurrying back into the castle, her fingernails cutting into her palm and angry tears burning at the back of her eyes. </p><p>*** </p><p>‘We took it too far this time mate, you know it’ James was saying patiently as Remus stepped into the dormitory several hours later, </p><p>‘You’re just pissed off that Evans shouted at you’ Sirius said, eyebrows raised, ‘you wouldn’t give a toss otherwise’. </p><p>‘It was three on one’ </p><p>‘It's always three on one’ </p><p>‘People saw though; it wasn’t like when we prank each other normally- everyone was laughing at him’. James was looking shamefaced, nothing like the cocky, arrogant prat he’d been earlier.</p><p>‘Because he’s a great slimy git!’ Sirius said loudly, ‘You know as well as I do that if the roles were reversed he would have done much worse’.</p><p>Remus quietly sat down on his bed, sorting through the books in his bag as he toed off his shoes. He didn’t want to get involved in this- every fight they had recently was because of Snape. Him knowing Remus’ secret had changed everything, and Remus’ wasn’t ready yet to deal with the consequences of that; they still had one exam left after all.</p><p>‘He called Evans a- a- mudblood though’, James whispered the last word, revulsion clinging to every syllable, ‘I thought they were best friends?’. </p><p>‘Not any more’ Remus said quietly, and the two dark haired boys span to face him, possibly noticing for the first time that he’d entered the room. </p><p>‘What do you mean, “not any more?”’ James demanded, ‘What do you know?’. </p><p>Remus sighed, wishing he hadn’t said anything at all. </p><p>‘Lily’s known I’m a werewolf for nearly eight months’ he said, almost laughing at the identical expressions of shock on both their faces, ‘but she didn’t tell Snape because she knew how he would react’. </p><p>‘How did she know?’ Sirius asked.</p><p>‘Same as you did- she worked it out and says it doesn’t matter to her’ </p><p>‘That’s Lily though’ James smiled a little sadly, ‘She sticks up for everyone’. </p><p>‘I’m not telling you anything else’ Remus said sternly, ‘She was there for me these last few weeks and I’m not going to betray her trust’. </p><p>Remus felt desperately sorry for Lily- in one afternoon she’d been humiliated in front of half the school, had her best friend call her a horrid slur, and was now stuck on prefect rounds when he knew she would rather be studying. </p><p>‘I’m going to find her’ James said decisively, ‘I need to apologise’ </p><p>‘No, you want to go and flirt with her, there’s a difference’ said Sirius derisively. </p><p>James blushed, ‘No, I don’t want to- why do you always make everything about me fancying her? I don’t’</p><p>‘Sure you don’t mate’ Sirius snorted, lounging back against his bed, ‘that’s why you asked her out this afternoon, yeah?’ </p><p>‘That was to wind Snape up and you know it’ James snapped, rummaging around in his trunk- ‘Where the bloody hell is the map?’.</p><p>‘I think Peter took it’ </p><p>‘Why?’ demanded James,</p><p>‘Something about a “special anniversary” with Cynthia, quite frankly I was too horrified to ask for details’. </p><p>‘Urgh, how is it that Peter is the only one getting any action out of the four of us?’ </p><p>‘Who says he’s the only one?’ Sirius said, sounding slightly affronted. </p><p>James rolled his eyes, ‘Flirting with Sarah Falkenberg in Care of Magical Creatures absolutely does not count’. </p><p>‘Yeah? Well neither does making doe-eyes at Evans’ Sirius shot back. </p><p>‘Deer puns? Really?’ </p><p>Remus rolled his eyes, ‘Lily is on prefect rounds’ he said loudly, checking his watch, ‘she usually likes to do the Transfiguration corridor last as it’s the closest to the tower, so she’ll probably be there in fifteen minutes’. </p><p>‘You’re a lifesaver Moony’ James said, snatching his wand up from his bedside table. </p><p>‘Just-’ Remus hesitated, ‘Be nice to her?’.</p><p>‘I’m always nice to her!’ </p><p>Remus raised his eyebrows disbelievingly. 	</p><p>‘Most of the time’ James amended, looking sheepish.</p><p>***</p><p>Somewhere between the Great Hall and the statue of Maximilian the Magnificent on the sixth floor, Lily felt her anger fade into misery. She had never been the self pitying sort, but this bone deep depression was impossible to shake. Even fighting with Petunia didn’t leave her feeling this unhappy- Petunia was family after all, and she knew that deep down, they loved each other really. </p><p>But to have her best friend call her such a disgusting slur in front of all her classmates was inspiring self-pity in her that she had never thought she was capable of. </p><p>‘Hi’ a quiet voice said behind her, and she span around so quickly the toe of her left boot caught on the heel of her right, and she stumbled straight into a suit of amour. </p><p>‘Shit’ she panted, righting herself and glancing up, ‘You could warn someone Pete- you’re quieter than a bloody mouse’</p><p>‘More rat-like I’d say’ he said with a patented Marauder smirk, and she frowned. ‘I wanted to come and say sorry’ he said quietly.</p><p>‘You don’t have to-’ Lily began, but he cut her off.</p><p>‘I should have stopped them’ he looked shamefaced, ‘I know Remus thinks he should have to’ </p><p>‘Yes’ Lily said frankly, ‘You should have’. </p><p>‘I’ve never been very good at standing up for myself’ he said with a sad smile, ‘much less standing up for other people.’</p><p>‘Perhaps it’s time you learnt’ </p><p>‘That’s what Cynthia says’</p><p>‘I’d listen to her, sounds like the most sensible thing she’s said this year’. </p><p>He scowled at her and she held up her hands in surrender,</p><p>‘Sorry, sorry’ she sighed, ‘that was bitchy. It’s been a really long day’. </p><p>‘I’ll say’ he said, ‘I’m sorry’</p><p>‘You already said that’</p><p>He shrugged, ‘I meant it’. </p><p>‘It’s not your fault my best friend of eight years turned out to be a giant racist tosspot’ </p><p>He snorted a laugh, ‘No, I guess it isn’t’. </p><p>They had reached the staircase that lead back down to the main hall. Lily only had the transfiguration corridor left now, then she could go and collapse on her bed like she’d been dying to do all day.</p><p>‘You’re out after curfew you know’ she said slyly to Peter, ‘I could give you detention’. </p><p>‘You could’ he agreed, ‘But I didn’t really want to have this conversation in front of a lot of people’. </p><p>She smiled gratefully. She couldn’t understand why Peter worked so hard for Potter and Black’s approval- he was a wonderful person all on his own. Not as talented, and a little quieter, but he genuinely cared about people. </p><p>‘Now, I’m off to steal some chocolate from the kitchens’ he said, tugging a worn piece of parchment out of his pocket, ‘It’s mine and Cynthia’s anniversary and I want to surprise her’ </p><p>‘Your anniversary was in February’ Lily said, frowning.</p><p>‘I didn’t say what anniversary’ he said with a wriggle of his eyebrows, </p><p>‘Urgh! Peter I don’t want to know!’.</p><p>She turned to head up the stairs and heard his laughter follow her all the way down the corridor.</p><p>***</p><p>He waited at the corner of the seventh floor corridor, his stomach churning. Had Snape deserved what they’d done today? Yes. He was a racist slimy tosser who couldn’t wait to join you-know-who and start murdering muggle-borns and people like his parents. Had Lily deserved it? Absolutely not. </p><p>He didn’t fancy her- he didn’t. But he couldn’t deny that he was fascinated by her. She was clever and funny and kind. She could be the most popular girl in school and yet she never seemed interested in socialising with anyone outside of the classroom. Most people considered her a friendly acquaintance, being paired with her in class was always a relief, and yet James didn’t even know her middle name. He doubted, in fact, if anyone knew much about her at all. </p><p>‘Oh James I am not in the mood’. </p><p>He had been so lost in his thoughts that Lily had turned the corner and found him leaning there without him even noticing. She walked straight past him and he jogged quickly to catch up, keeping pace beside her.</p><p>‘I came to apologise’. </p><p>‘That seems to be the theme of the evening’ she said, rolling her eyes, ‘But really it’s not me you need to be apologising to’. </p><p>He swallowed thickly, ‘I know’</p><p>She quirked her eyebrows in surprise, but he continued, ‘but I can’t. I can’t apologise to him Lily- not when he’s-’ he stopped.</p><p>‘Not when he’s a racist, dark arts loving slime ball who called his best friend a mudblood just because he was embarrassed?’ she finished for him. </p><p>James seemed to deflate, ‘I’m sorry’. </p><p>‘He’s a prick, but you acted like one too’ </p><p>‘I know’ </p><p>‘You know he’s a prick or you know you are?’ </p><p>‘I know I’ve been a bit of a prat lately’. Lily couldn’t help but smile at this, but it was hollow.</p><p>‘You’ve nearly knocked me out with the snitch three times this week while I’ve been studying, and you upset Remus so much after what happened last full moon and I’ve just been so angry and-’ she went quiet for a moment, ‘You might have been a prat lately but I was a cow earlier, so let's just call it even’.</p><p>He stopped walking and turned to face her, making a point of not noticing how nice her eyes looked today, even if they were rather red.<br/>
‘What about Remus?’ he said, concerned, ‘Has he said something to you?’ </p><p>Lily frowned, ‘I shouldn’t have said that- I shouldn’t be getting involved at all’ she looked worried now, gnawing on her bottom lip like she did when faced with a particularly difficult charms problem. </p><p>‘No no’ James said quickly, ‘it’s good- Remus will never tell us if he’s upset, I like knowing there is someone looking out for him’. </p><p>‘Has Black apologized yet?’ Lily asked, and James looked taken aback; ‘For what happened at the full moon last month?’ she clarified. </p><p>‘How do you know about-? You know what, never mind’ he said at her amused expression, ‘Of course he’s apologized- he is really sorry’.</p><p>‘Has he actually sat Remus down and explicitly told him that he’s sorry?’ </p><p>‘Well-’</p><p>‘Or has he just been telling you how sorry he is, and waiting for you to pass the message on?’.</p><p>James looked thoroughly miserable as he thought this through. </p><p>‘Remus is still absolutely terrified that he nearly killed someone’ Lily said, who couldn’t seem to stop talking now that she’d started, ‘And then you all fell out and he had no one to talk to, and you and Black have been acting like absolute tossers, and Peter has been avoiding all conflict and spending all his time with Cynthia and then he was so miserable and stressed and lonely that he went back to hanging out with you even though Black still hasn’t apologized’. </p><p>‘Sirius made a mistake-’ James started, but Lily was clearly getting angry again, and he took a tiny, cautionary step back. </p><p>‘You don’t need to tell me’ Lily said, ‘I don’t give a fuck what goes on between you’ </p><p>‘But-’</p><p>‘No, Potter’ She said sharply, ‘I care about Remus because he is a good friend and deserves much better than you morons, but you’re his friends too and I can respect that, as long as you respect him’. </p><p>‘Okay- okay’ James sighed, tugging his hand through his hair, ‘I’ll tell Sirius he needs to apologize properly’ </p><p>She studied him for a moment and James felt distinctly exposed, ‘Good’ she said finally, ‘Now, you’re out in the corridors after hours, I’m going to have to give you detention’. </p><p>‘Aw no Evans!’ he said, looking at her with a horrified expression on his face. But as soon as he caught her eye she immediately dissolved into giggles. </p><p>‘Oh Merlin’ she gasped, still laughing, ‘your face!’</p><p>‘That was a mean trick Evans’ he grumbled, trying not to smile, ‘A blatant and flagrant abuse of power’. </p><p>She snorted, ‘Like you wouldn’t if they’d made you a prefect’ </p><p>‘No one in their right mind would make me a prefect’ he said laughing, ‘I’d use my position to give detention to all the first years who get in the way in the corridors’ </p><p>‘I’ve been tempted to do that myself’ she admitted, ‘I swear we were never that small and irritating’. </p><p>‘You definitely were’ he said with a grin, ducking as her hand came up to cuff him over the back of the head. </p><p>They’d stopped walking now, they could see the Fat Lady snoozing in her frame up ahead. </p><p>‘I’m sorry I said you were no better than him’ she said quietly, not meeting his eye, ‘Just promise me you’ll stop hexing people for fun?’ </p><p>He felt a funny little flip in his stomach as she said this, although he couldn’t for the life of him work out why. </p><p>‘I promise’ he said, ‘Although Snape does hex me first a lot of the time-’ </p><p>‘So turn the other cheek’ she said looking at him in the eye now. His confusion must have shown on his face because she added, ‘It’s a muggle expression, it means if someone hits you you shouldn’t retaliate, you should turn the other cheek and walk away’.</p><p>James nodded slowly, ‘I don’t think I can do that Evans’ he said, ‘I can’t let people like Snape walk away unpunished’</p><p>‘It’s not your job to punish them’ she snapped, ‘you’re sixteen for Merlin’s sake- if he attacks you, walk away and go to a teacher!’</p><p>James evidently looked flabbergasted at this, as she sighed again, looking long suffering and annoyed. </p><p>‘I can’t just run to a teacher Evans’ he said fiercely, ‘there are no teachers to run to in the real world’ </p><p>‘But we’re not <em>in</em> the real world’ she said, ‘not yet’.</p><p>They walked slowly up to the portrait of the Fat Lady, who woke with a start and immediately glared at them for interrupting her nap.<br/>
‘Facta non verba’ Lily said tonelessly, ignoring the way James was still gaping at her. </p><p>The portrait swung open and they scrabbled through. The common room was crowded, everyone pouring over books before the last day of exams. James was immediately spotted by Sirius, who waved at him. James waved distractedly back and continued to follow Lily further into the room.</p><p>‘Evans I-’ </p><p>‘I don’t want to talk about it any more Potter’ she said wearily, ‘I need to read over my Transfiguration notes and it’s already nearly eleven’.</p><p>‘Ok’ he said, running his hand through his hair agitated, ‘But again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have hexed him and I shouldn’t have wound you up’ </p><p>She smiled up at him from where she’d dropped into an armchair in the corner, ‘Thank you’ she said, ‘and I’m sorry too. I shouldn’t have shouted at you, even if you were being a tosser’ </p><p>She said the last bit with a grin, and James resolutely ignored the way his stomach flipped as he returned it and headed over to where his fellow marauders sat. After all, he absolutely <em>didn’t fancy</em> Lily Evans.</p>
