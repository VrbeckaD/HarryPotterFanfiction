          <div class="userstuff"><p>The year is 1993 and our tale begins in the Hufflepuff common room where Hannah Abbott gets a shock from an unexpected visitor.</p><p>A ghost like figure of a teenage boy appeared in front of Hannah and she screamed. "G-G-Ghost!"</p><p>The boy corrected her, "Memory ghost."</p><p>Hannah asked, "What?"</p><p>The boy introduced himself, "I was the memory of Tom Marvolo Riddle when he was 18 before Harry Potter destroyed my vessel."</p><p>Hannah gasped. "So you're a memory ghost? Is that a thing?"</p><p>Tom smirked. "It is now."</p><p>Hannah inquired, "So, why have you come to visit the Hufflepuff common room?"</p><p>Tom sighed. "I got bored wandering around The Chamber of Secrets, so I started exploring other parts of the castle and this room seemed like the best place in the whole castle."</p><p>Hannah grinned. "It's the best place in the whole castle because it's beside the kitchens."</p><p>Tom beamed, "I love food too."</p><p>Hannah suggested, "Do you want to go there now?"</p><p>Tom said, "Sure, after you."</p><p>Hannah led the way to the kitchens and announced, "Welcome to the second best place in the whole castle!"</p><p>Tom chuckled. "You sure are funny, sorry what was your name?"</p><p>Hannah giggled. "Silly me, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Hannah Abbott."</p><p>Tom smiled. "A pleasure to meet you, my dear."</p><p>Hannah responded, "I'm going to make you something."</p><p>Tom pointed out, "I'm a ghost, I can't eat food."</p><p>Hannah chortled. "I know, so that means I'll get to eat it."</p><p>Tom grinned. "You're pretty smart for a Hufflepuff."</p><p>Hannah retorted, "Just because us badgers aren't known for our brains, doesn't mean we don't have any!"</p><p>Tom muttered, "I'm sorry, I've just never met a girl like you before."</p><p>Hannah snorted. "You're embarrassed."</p><p>Tom admitted, "Yeah, I am."</p><p>Hannah smiled. "You know what, I think we should head to my dormitory instead."</p><p>Tom asked, "Why?"</p><p>Hannah told him, "So, we can get to know each other better somewhere more private."</p><p>Tom insisted, "After you."</p></div>
