  <u>Lionhearted: Prologue</u>

The whole room was a bit on the run down side, but as it was nothing but a cobbled-together last-minute hideout, it was functional. It was a little previously-abandoned hut that Sirius had found and tried to fix up to make it more comfortable for him, but even his efforts hadn't been enough to rid it completely of the feeling of worness and lingering stench of neglect. The stirrings of guilt filled his chest at the thought that those efforts would be in vain. Very soon he wouldn't be needing the safe house anymore.</p><p>He heaved a heavy breath and sunk into the threadbare sofa, wringing his hands as he looked towards the clock. There was a strange sense of both dread of the approaching hour, and the deepest wish that it would just hurry up already so that his torture would finally be over. Just one more hour. Then he would be meeting face to face with the Dark Lord for the final time. He slumped in the seat, his head leaning back to stare glumly at the ceiling, and he wondered to himself just how everything had come to this.</p><p>It had started out at first as an act of self-preservation.</p><p>How could he not betray the Order when the only choices were of dying a brutal and torturous death at the hands of the Dark Lord himself, who surly would have made an example of him if only to show the Order what happens to those who refused Lord Voldemort, or, of keeping his life at only the cost of leaking a few bits of information, just details of a plan here, a few names there?</p><p>With those being the only choices, was there really a choice at all? How could anyone blame him for deciding that living was better than becoming a martyr for the Order's cause?</p><p>After all, what loyalty had he to Dumbledore's Order?</p><p>To the old headmaster who'd never acknowledged him at all, who'd never so much as given him a second glance not only through all those seven years of school where everyone thought of him as just a talentless and dumb hanger-on to his Marauder friends, but worse, even now after years of faithful service to the Order? He, and also Mad-Eye who favored his much more talented and accomplished friends while never caring much for Peter, the man himself; only of what he could do for the greater good, for his role as canon fodder in the war.</p><p>And what loyalty had he to Fabian and Gideon who'd always made him the butt of their jokes even in important meetings with their peers, or to Dorcas and Marlene who never spared a second thought to poor useless Peter? The Longbottoms at least were more than decent to him, although they were still much more estranged to him than they were to Lily and James.</p><p>But of the whole Order, none of <em>them</em> had given a fig about him, or so he told himself to assuage his guilt as so many of their members had fallen to the Dark Lord's forces. He'd managed to fight that guilt for a whole year, an entire year of lying and hiding, and betraying out of desperation for his life, but now, finally, there was one thing that not even his desperation to live could have convinced him to do.</p><p>The Dark Lord wanted him to give up the Potters.</p><p>Anxious again, Peter heaved himself up to walk around once more before stopping at the small frosty window. The moon, besieged by thick dark clouds, was waning and he was grateful on Moony's behalf. His poor friend was out there, undercover with the werewolves. He winced at the thought of him, surrounded by dangerous enemies while at his most vulnerable, and he glumly thought to himself that this was part of why, in retrospect, all his former bitterness and excuses paled in comparison to what his friends had been willing to do, to give up for the greater good.</p><p>He'd been selfish. Completely selfish.</p><p>He'd let his own petty grudges put his friends lives in danger. How could he have lived with himself if he'd survived the war with the knowledge that it was at the expense of his friends?</p><p>His friends...</p><p>Kind, patient, Remus who'd befriended him first and foremost and brought him into the fold, and who Peter had risked life and limb to keep company on those horrible, painful, nights of the full moon… Bold, daring, James who he looked up to as a brother and who had always been there to encourage and lead him through a crisis…Loving, beautiful, Lily who'd treated him just as much as one of the family as all the others…Little baby Harry who was like a bright light in a world of darkness and chaos, a symbol of hope for the future, and at one years old was just as much a Marauder as any of them; James and Sirius had seen to that… and even Sirius, who despite it all, even if he was the quickest to loose patience with him for being thick but who still never gave it a second thought to fight off his bullies, and who would have given his very life to protect him if he were ever given the choice… He just couldn't do it. He just couldn't give up his friends.
And so, that was exactly the choice that he, Peter, would have to make now.</p><p>He knew it, the moment that James, Lily, and Sirius had summoned him, baby Harry in his mother's arms sleeping safely and soundly, asking him to become their secret keeper, that if only to repay them for all those years of love and comfort, that he would choose to protect them.</p><p>And it wasn't a decision he made lightly.</p><p>Even as he stood now in the midst of his tiny ramshackle hide out, he could feel the panic and fear threatening his resolve.</p><p>But he knew he could do it… <em>would</em> do it.</p><p>Poor Lily, and James, and Sirius, and Remus.</p><p>They had no idea what he was about to do, what he had been doing for the past year. He wondered what they would think when they learned the truth of what's he'd been hiding from them for so long, the people he'd helped to get killed.</p><p>Turning away from the window once more, his eyes landed on the tiny lopsided desk in the corner, and he contemplated writing a letter, a last farewell to his greatest friends and greatest loves, explaining what he was going to have to do and hoping that it would be enough to earn their forgiveness. The clock was counting down the last ten minutes before the moment of truth would arrive, and he scrambled over, scribbling in his own clumsy writing his final words.</p><p>He was going to miss them so much, his family in everything but blood, of all the memories of their school days that had started it all. There was a painful prick in his eyes, the welling up of tears that fell and splattered into the ink of quill, blotting his words with both his regrets and nostalgia.</p><p>The thought almost made him suddenly giddy; it was almost like a prank; Mr. Wormtail's final hurrah, and on the Dark Lord himself!</p><p>He had to hold himself to keep from laughing.</p><p>Just then, the clock on the mantle chimed, and with shaking hands, from mirth or fear he wasn't sure, he hurriedly placed his last note in an envelope on his desk. It was time. He shuffled over to the fireplace to put his shaking hand on the timepiece. His back straightened as if bracing himself for what was to come as he gripped his wand, and the clock began to glow blue as the Portkey began to activate.</p><p>It was time.</p><p>Time to face the Dark Lord.</p><p>Time to face his destiny.</p><p>He closed his eyes and gathered all his courage, and with one final blue glow Mr. Wormtail bid his friends a good life, and was whisked away, feeling a lot less like a Rat, and more like a Lion.</p><p align="center">:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.::.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
