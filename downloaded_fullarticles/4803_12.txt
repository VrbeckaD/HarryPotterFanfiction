    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>It was late at night and I was bored out of my skull, everyone I cared for had pulled away from me when I was sent to Azkaban after killing the dark lord, the ministry was scared of me and it turned out most of the magical citizens of Britain were too. Their main fear was that I would turn dark; after all, I had killed Voldemort when even Dumbledore couldn’t… I looked up through my skylight and wished on a shooting star that things could have been different.</p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Harry awoke with a start, and slowly moved his muscles, for some reason he was in pain “Bugger, I haven’t felt like this since before Hogwarts” he says as he sits up in bed cracking his spine to get the kinks out, that’s when it registered in his mind that something was off, his voice sounded different and his body just felt weird. Harry took a deep breath and opened his eyes, taking in his surroundings, he was in a dark cramped space that seemed like it had a slanted roof, and it felt extremely familiar. He went to rub at his face when he felt glasses on his nose and it seemed to all come crashing down on him “Merlin mother of a banshee, I’m in my cupboard…” he had barely spoken when there was an incessant pounding on the door of the cupboard “Get up you freak, I expect breakfast to be ready in five minutes and if anything is burnt again you will wish that I had rather given you to Marge’s dogs!” He stared in disbelief at the woman on the outside of the door, before getting up and doing as he was told, and to be honest, cooking had always helped him think so he didn’t particularly mind. </p>
<p>It all felt like a bizarre dream, but here he was, at the Dursley house in surrey, a few days away from his eleventh birthday (24th July 1991). Harry’s mind was whirling with questions and possible answers as to how and why he had ended up back here. Last thing he remembered before waking up in the cupboard was laying on his soft bed staring at the stars through a skylight in his flat in Knockturn Alley. An absurd thought struck him, perhaps something he had done while stargazing had caused this. He inwardly sighed, it was just his luck that a stupid wish on a shooting star would actually come true, he had a feeling it had more to do with the immortal entity called death than it did with actual magic in a shooting star. Stupid death he made a mental note *note to self, kill death*<br/>
This was honestly not what he had meant when he wished that things could have been different. He had actually just hoped that people would stop treating him like a pariah.<br/>
After he had finished making breakfast he heard the mail dropping through the slot and went to get it without argument, knowing that his Hogwarts letter would be amongst that day’s post. As he passed his cupboard he slipped his letter through the crack at the bottom and went to clean up the kitchen, trying his best to act as if he was actually the eleven year old boy his relatives thought him to be.</p>
<p>That afternoon he took his letter from his cupboard and went to the park to read it, knowing that he would be safe there with the Dursleys visiting Marge for the afternoon. He knew what it said though but as he read it again he started wondering why he had to go to Hogwarts of all places? Why not Beauxbatons, or Durmstrang, or even Ilvermorny? Shouldn’t schools be clamouring for the “Boy who lived” to attend their schools? Was this one of the pieces of Dumbledore’s game? Him attending Hogwarts specifically? He had no idea.</p>
<p>So Harry let his mind drift, thinking up ways he could fuck with the old goat’s plans. He really didn’t want to kill Tom, not that he wanted to join him, the man was completely out of his damned mind. He could try and write the other schools, but he would need an international owl post office for that… He would really need to go to diagon alley and get away from the Dursleys while he was at it. Would he be able to claim his lordships and get emancipated at this young an age? Would that oaf come looking for him if he didn’t reply to the letter? He really hoped not.<br/>
With his mind made up he left the park to get a few things from privet drive before leaving it forever. He stole enough money from his aunt’s emergency stash (read Dudley’s lunch money) to get a cab to London, packed a few items into his school bag and left a note painted on their pure white lounge wall<br/>

 “To my loving relatives<br/>
Thank you very much for taking such good care of me for the last ten years.<br/>
I hope you all rot in hell.<br/>
With love Freak<br/>
HJP”</p>
<p>The paint dripped thickly like the sarcasm he would’ve added if he could. He might’ve added a wandless permanent sticking charm to the paint so they would remember him for a while. Leaving privet drive with a smirk that didn’t belong on a child who looked eight, he made his way to the main road and took a cab all the way to London, about a block away from the leaky. He couldn’t wait until he had a wand again, then he could take the entrance to knockturn instead of the busy diagon entrance. He quickly walked to the Leaky and making sure his damned scar was covered up he entered asking the barman if he could open up the entrance and sent him a smile before lowering his head and quickly making his way to Gringotts. He wasn’t sure if their magic would realise he was from the future or not but he hoped it wouldn’t. He walked up to an open teller and bowed to the Goblin “May your gold ever grow and your enemies fall before your feet Master Goblin, I would like to speak to someone about my vaults”<br/>
The Goblins eyes almost popped out of his head at the traditional greeting, it hadn’t been used since before the last goblin war and here was a wizard child looking barely school aged giving it, the Goblin shook his head to clear it before answering the young child with a lifted eyebrow “May your gold ever grow and your enemies fall before your feet young wizard. Shouldn’t this be business for your parents young one?” he asked as he got up and led the child to his office so they could speak without all the curious eyes on them<br/>
Harry could almost see the wheels turning in the Goblins mind as his greeting sunk in “If I had any it would have been their business but seeing as they died on samhain night 1981 it is my business” he answered him when they entered the office.</p>
<p>The goblin was startled, this small child was Harry Potter?! He took a closer look and realized that the magic this child possessed was matured, like an adults would be, though it was much stronger than any adult he has ever met, greater than that of Dumbledore and Grindewald combined “Heir Potter, my apologies, I did not realize it was you, my name is Crystalclaw. What is it I can do for you today?”</p>
<p>Harry chuckled softly “It is good to meet you Crystalclaw, if I can fool a Goblin, I was clearly hiding perfectly. Now as to my business here today, I wish to be emancipated and possibly take up my lordships, I also wish to block all access to my vaults that isn’t authorized by me, and whilst doing that I want a full audit of my vaults and any money or items removed has to be returned to me, no matter what.” He stated matter of factly, already having decided to royally fuck the old man over. “Oh and could you possibly find out for me, why I have to attend Hogwarts when it is one of the worst magical schools in the world?”</p>
<p>Crystalclaw liked it when wizards knew what they wanted, and Harry clearly knew what he wanted. He jumped to work, ordering a couple of younger Goblins to get him some of the needed paperwork, and to bring a healer in as soon as they could “Now Heir Potter, I will need to do a lineage test on you to determine which lordships you qualify for and at which age you can take them up, though most can be attained at eleven years of age. Emancipation in the wizarding world can occur also from the age of eleven or a few weeks prior to that age, if the child has a valid reason for it. Luckily for you it only has to be approved by us Goblins and not by the ministry. Everything else will happen as you as for it. Now, I have called for one of our healers to come and check you over as I’m guessing that the reason you want to live on your own is due to abuse.” The goblin could clearly see how small this child was for his age.</p>
<p>“You are absolutely correct in your assumption, I have lived with my abusive muggle relatives for the last ten years of my life, and they are magic hating fools” when talking about his relatives Harry sneered and hatred burned in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Heir Potter… If I may ask, how is it you know so much about the magical world when you have grown up with muggles? Also, are you aware that your magic is fully matured?” the goblin had a feeling that this boy was not a boy at all, but something much more.</p>
