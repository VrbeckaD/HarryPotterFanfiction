    <p>As the car pulls up to the wedding venue, Harry knows he’s made a mistake. He exits the magical vehicle on shaky legs, his palms sweaty and his breaths quick. In this moment, he is thankful Cedric is not with him, not yet. </p><p>Cedric was Harry’s second chance at love after his falling out with Tom. Unlike Tom, he was warm, kind, and endlessly caring, helping Harry get over his breakup with his first love. </p><p>Back at Hogwarts, Harry had always been drawn to him. The charismatic Slytherin won the hearts of many, but few people knew the real Tom Riddle, the dangerous side of him. They started as rivals, constantly challenging each other in classes, but a midnight duel during his fifth year changed their relationship forever. </p><p>As they flung curses back and forth at each other, Harry watched the sweat drip down Tom’s face, his perfect hair finally messed up in the heat of the moment. When he disarmed Tom and held his wand against his throat, Harry met Tom’s stormy gray eyes, reveling in the anger and passion in them, and Harry realized with a sinking feeling he wanted Tom. And when he leaned down for a kiss, Tom captured his lips possessively, and Harry fell hard. </p><p>Their intense relationship consumed Harry in his later years at Hogwarts, but a single momentous, terrible argument had ruined everything with Tom, who’d taken Harry’s heart with him the night he’d left. Harry’s nightmares were still haunted by Tom’s cold expression, his jaw twitching in disgust, a look he had never given Harry- never his Harry. </p><p>Harry had crumpled to his knees, tears streaming down his face, but he couldn’t bring himself to call for Tom as he turned away, never to look back again.</p><p>Harry hadn’t seen Tom Riddle since he’d left for his journey around the world, eight years ago today.</p><p>A year after Tom left his life, Harry hadn’t intended to fall in love with Cedric, but it was just so natural, so effortless. While Harry was still deep in depression, Cedric had appeared. </p><p>He had stood by Harry through his tears, his anger, and his hopelessness. Cedric was his lifeline, and the only way Harry could ever repay him was with his love.</p><p>After many happy years, Cedric had proposed to him on a starry Christmas night in Godric’s Hollow. With their families tucked away inside his cozy childhood home, with the snow flakes glistening in Cedric’s dark hair, Harry couldn’t help but say yes. </p><p>But as their wedding drew nearer, Tom began haunting his dreams once more. To be honest, the memory of Tom had never left Harry, but the frequency with which he thought of him became alarming as the days went on. </p><p>During his waking hours, Harry’s thoughts were consumed by day dreams and what ifs, thinking wistfully of the life he could have had with Tom, that he could have with Tom. But by night, his dreams were full of Tom and his ghostly touch, preparing him carefully, whispering his name so seductively, making Harry scream his own name.</p><p>Tom used to be mine, his traitorous mind recalls as he enters the building, ushered into a back room before his groom or guest can spot him. </p><p>Hermione and Ginny fawn over him, adjusting his collar, fixing his hair, applying a fine layer of expensive make-up to his face. Ron and Neville stand at the far side of the room, watching the women with awe and just a hint of fear. </p><p>They all made idle conversation, the excitement in the room palpable, but Harry tunes them out. He has no idea what he says to them, a mask of happiness on his face. He’s used to lying about this; his wedding day is no different. </p><p>His mind is numb as he watches his closest friends gossip and banter, all focused on the countless guests in attendance. After what feels like ages, he watches them slowly leave the room, giving Harry hugs and pats on the back as they leave him to his final moments. Distantly, he mourns the fact that none of them realize how much he is suffering, how much he is about to sacrifice for some semblance of happiness.</p><p>Ron is about to leave when he pauses and walks back into the room, his eyes flashing with concern. </p><p>“Are you sure you’re alright, mate?” Ron asks tentatively. Harry looks up at Ron and finds he still can’t be honest, even to Ron. A fake smile is plastered on his face, but he can’t bring himself to meet Ron’s eyes.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m alright. Just nervous,” he lies, and Ron, his trusting best friend, believes him. He gives Harry a pat on the shoulder and nods his head, leaving Harry to his suffering. </p><p>When Harry is finally alone, he slumps into the nearest chair and puts his head in his hands. His thoughts are filled with Tom. Would he show up? he thought bleakly, trying his best to hold back his tears. </p><p>Weeks ago, in the dead of night, Harry had gotten drunk and sent an invitation to Tom to attend his wedding. When he awoke in the morning, realizing his mistake, the letter was gone, and the damage done. </p><p>So Harry sat in the uncomfortable wooden chair, silent sobs wracking his body, hoping with all of his being that Tom would come and save him. That he would whisk him away from this nightmare and they could be together again at last.</p><p>Harry shakes his head at the futility of his thoughts and forces himself not to cry. It is a broken, pitiful dream, and Harry would need to face the truth: Tom is never coming back.</p><p>But when Harry looks up, there is an innocent letter sitting on the dark table in front of him, with his name written in golden ink on the envelope. </p>
