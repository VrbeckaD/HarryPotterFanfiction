          <div class="userstuff"><p>She was a blood traitor and he had blood as pure as it came, at least in the Magical sense that is.  He thought eventually he would be able to walk away from her, but that just ended up not being possible for him.  If you were to ask him when he realized he fell in love with her it would have been one of the many nights they had been sneaking around behind her boyfriend and his best friends back. </p><p>He decided that he was tired of it all now and that he was going to spend this night behind honest with her and if she didn’t feel the same then that would be that.  As far as his best friend went, well that road would be crossed depending on how the night went. </p><p>“I’m not supposed to love you” He said to her after they had been drinking in the Astronomy tower. They snuck out there while his best friend was on Head Boy patrol for the evening, and knew he wouldn’t come looking for anyone up there.  </p><p>“What are you talking about?” She giggled.  </p><p>“I do….you know.  I’m so tired of this sneaking around behind his back. He’s going to figure it out.  I know you love him and he loves you, but once upon a time he was my boyfriend too.”  He said </p><p>“What do you want to do? I don’t think he will exactly be fond of finding out his Girlfriend has been sleeping with his best friend, we can’t break that news to him.”  She hissed at him. </p><p>“I just think that you needed to know my feelings on this and that is, I am so completely in love with you and I want to be apart of something with you. I know you love him too. I want you to honestly think about this, how would you feel about sharing?”  He asked her. </p><p>“Sharing? Sharing what? Me….In what capacity?”  She questioned him.  He hoped that by her engaging in the conversation more, that would mean she was partially or wholly invested in his idea. </p><p>“Yes you, we can be a tri-ad, a tri-pod..no that's not right...a tri-pair...something like that.  We already know that he and I can be friendly, given we used to fuck around in the dungeons. It's you I want to know about. Would you be open to all 3 of us dating, courting...because I can’t just have you. I want him too.  I miss him..you know that.  He gives me these looks and it takes everything in me to pretend I don’t care for him like that anymore. “  He stated thinking he was going to lose her the more he carried on.  </p><p>“Theo...I’m not sure about all of this.  You telling me you love me complicates so much, but now you are telling me it doesn’t have to be.  No one will be okay with this. Wo don’t even know if he will be okay with this. What do we do if he says no. You are putting all your faith into the fact that he won't.”  She responded skeptically.  </p><p>He had reached up to move her red hair out of her face and tuck it behind her ear when the person in question showed up.  </p><p>“Would you just imagine...the surprise I got yesterday when I found my girlfriend and ex-boyfriend snogging in the back of the library, while I was supposed to be making my rounds.”  He said pointing at each of them. </p><p>“It’s….” Theo began to state but then he was interrupted.</p><p>“Not what it looks like?...Pray tell, what do you think I think this looks like” He challenged them. </p><p>“It looks like your best mate is moving in on your girl.  But that just isn’t it.  I love her.  I know you do..but I do too.  Yes we’ve been sneaking around and I am sorry for that, but somewhere along the way I fell for Ginny.”  Theo stated. </p><p>“Sorry, Theo! We used to sleep together, Theo. Your ass used to take my cock in all the way.  You want to pretend like I don’t know what's going on.  I heard your little plan.” He said</p><p>“Wait a minute you two…”She held her hand up.  “What are you saying Draco?  Would you really want to open this up?”  Ginny asked him brows furrowing. </p><p>“Love, you have been extra cheerie since your little tryst started.  Not to mention every time we have sex, you are spot on with the blowjobs I can’t complain.  I knew you had to be doing something or shall I say who, and I'm okay with it.” Draco Explained</p><p>Theo could not believe the things Draco was saying.  He had been waiting for this day for a very long time and he was about to get exactly what he wanted.  Them all together as one. </p><p>“What I am saying is, I want you, both of you.” Draco admitted</p><p>The other two took his words in and once they processed what he was saying each moved close to him.  Ginny took his hand first not sure how things would work out Draco realized each one took a chance on the other.  If this was truly going to work he would have to rebare his soul to Theo and Allow Ginny in.  It wouldn't be easy but then again...he was Draco Malfoy.</p></div>
