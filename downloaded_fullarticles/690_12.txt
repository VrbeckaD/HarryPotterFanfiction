<strong>Dear Mum</strong>

<p>
    <strong>I'm in GRYFFINDOR and it's BRILLIANT! Guess who's my best friend ever! HARRY POTTER!</strong>

    <strong>Tell Ginny he has the scar and everything!</strong>

<p>
    <strong>Also I am writing this under d̶u̶e̶ ̶d̶e̶r̶e̶s̶ Percy made me write this. Percy said to tell you I didn't brush my teeth, please please tell him to stop! I know when to brush my teeth!</strong>

  <p>Dearest Mum,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In case you were wondering, this is your favourite son Fred Weasley, penning a request.</p>
  <p>George has forgotten his lucky socks and asks if you could send it on, it's under his bed. Tryouts is soon and my dear twin needs all the help he can get.</p>
  <p>If for any reason you feel the need to send Percy a Howler, you may add to it our love. We fear that being a Prefect has gone straight to his head, making him impossible to live with. George tells me Durmstrang have discount for snitches, you might want to look into that.</p>
  <p>Send our best regards to your husband, our father, and also tell Ginny not to cry, she can come c̷a̷n̷o̷o̷d̷l̷e̷ ̷w̷i̷t̷h̷ ̷H̷a̷r̷r̷y̷ next year!</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Love Fred</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>P.S. George says if it is not under the bed then try looking in his pillowcase.</p>
  <p>P.P.S. If Precious Percy says anything, don't believe him, we are NOT up to anything nefarious.</p>
  <p> </p>

Dearest Mum,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In case you were wondering, this is your true favourite son, George Weasley, penning a second request.</p>
  <p>This letter is meant for Dad, please pass it on and don't read. It concerns male body parts and I would not like to upset your fine sensibilities.</p>
  <p>Dad, Ron found a wart on his nether regions and we are concerned for his future progeny. Is she still reading? Do you have a list of passwords that wizards (not Dark!) might use on parchments (not Dark!) that they've found lying about? Just to give us an idea. We are not up to anything, I swear.</p>
  <p>Let us know soon! Sooner if you can!</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Best regards,</p>
  <p>George.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>P.S. Wands crossed for Quidditch tryouts!</p>
  <p> </p>

<em>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>1 September 1991</em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em>Dear Mother and Father,</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>We've arrived safe and sound at Hogwarts, though the train journey seemed exceptionally long this year. Emotions were running high and one of the firsties lost his toad. We found him in the toilets (the toad), attempting a daring escape, and I dearly hope he will survive the Kneazle I saw with the girls. Professor McGonagall commended me on keeping a calm head, and sends her regards to you both.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I am very glad to announce that Ronald is now officially a Gryffindor. He has already made a little friend and is doing well. This year's group of firsties is twice the size as last and they seem to be quite a nice lot, I am sure he will fit right in.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Things to send on:</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>1. Ronald's toothbrush.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>2. George's favourite socks. The purple ones with the snitches on. DO NOT WASH, George insists it will wash the luck out. If you did wash it (which I have never done) then please walk around with it in the mud, he will not know the difference.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>3. The tin of polish for my badge. Fred says it is not hidden under the kitchen sink so that is probably the first place to look.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Mother, I am sorry to say, I already had to give both Fred and George detention. They've been running about on the train scaring girls with Lee's spider and an Engorgio. They refuse to attend it. Please talk to them.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Send all our love to Ginevra, I hope she is not sad still, only one more year then she can join us.</em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em>Your loving son,</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Percy Weasley</em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em>P.S. included are letters from my siblings. I apologise in advance for their lack of sense.</em>
