          <div class="userstuff"><p>Quirinus flicked his wand, envisioning grateful villagers kissing his robes for defeating the malicious spirit that had been haunting their forest. He'd be full professor when he returned. Gilderoy Lockhart would have to eat his lilac wizard's cap when he saw Quirinus's book sales figures. The possessed snake vanished in black smoke, and Quirrell turned to leave.</p>
<p>Then something cold gripped his mind. <em>My servant</em>, it whispered.</p>
<p>"Out!" Quirrell cried, raising his Occlumency shieldsâ€”to no effect.</p>
<p>
  <em>I will leave you in possession of your body for now. You will return to Hogwarts and request the Defense professorship immediately.</em>
</p>
