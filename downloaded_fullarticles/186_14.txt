    <p>Snow and sleet cover the ground. Two gravestones are gray and cold, jutting out of the ground like they’ve roots that go down to the Earth’s core. A dog has just turned into a man. </p><p>Sirius stands in front of the gravestones, bare hands resting apathetically at his sides, unbothered by the cold, tendering a completely unrelated tremble.</p><p>“Hi James…I’m sorry—” Sirius squeezes his eyes shut, gritting his teeth hard. Why can’t he say one <em> goddamn </em>thing without apologizing? </p><p>Little flurries of snow keep falling. Swirling in the air. Too light to be taken all the way down to the ground. </p><p>“You...You’ve been gone for a really long time now…” Sirius’ face screws up, feeling the water springing to his eyes. Fascinating how fast you can learn to cry again. His lips part, and he starts breathing through his mouth because his nose is all stopped up, but he can’t seem to hold on to his air. “And—and I really, really—” </p><p>Finally, Sirius opens his eyes again. A couple tears drop from his lashes. Join the snow at his feet. </p><p>He brings his hands in front of him, picking at the nail of his thumb, peeling back thin sections. He stares down at his hands. </p><p>“I don’t mean to cry…” he whispers quietly. “‘Guess the cemetery’s a good place for it,” he says, trying for humor, “bit awkward for anyone who wants to cry there, though,” Sirius says, and half-heartedly points at the gravestone closest to James and Lily’s. He chortles thickly. </p><p>“You, um…” Sirius finally looks up again, staring at the engraved name. “You’re always the one I would come to, you know?” He whines weakly, clasping his hands and squeezing them tightly. “With...with anything...Moony stuff…” Sirius stops, a short bark of laughter escaping him as his hands fly up, pressing closed fists to his eyes. </p><p>“Merlin, if I could just get <em> one </em>fucking sentence out!” </p><p>He drags his nails down his scalp as he tries to take a deep breath, and suddenly locks eyes with the gravestone. He chokes back a noise that erupts from his throat, like a sob. </p><p>“We won the war,” Sirius chokes. The wind howls between the nearby buildings. Sirius presses his wobbling lips together briefly, trying to get a handle on the uncontrollable tears. “Har—<em> Harry </em>won. Harry did it. Your baby, James, he—”</p><p>Sirius jerks his head to the side, staring out at the distance to his left. Dark and foggy. Bits of shapeless specks in the sky. He bites his lip, determined to not fall apart. </p><p>“So you should know that,” he says, nodding solemnly. “You should know that he won. But more importantly he—he’s <em> okay </em> ,” Sirius turns back to the gravestones, facing them with all the lines on his face showing, eyes shining. “He’s amazing— <em> brilliant </em>. And good.” Sirius flexes his fingers, blinking several times to clear his blurred vision, Sirius laughs. He crosses his arms, rubbing his hands up and down them. “I think you’d be happy to know that. And he—” </p><p>Sirius closes his eyes for several long seconds. Long enough that if he were talking to anyone alive, they’d frown and ask if he was okay. “He’s so <em> happy </em>, Prongs, Lils...a little broken, but...aren’t we all.”</p><p>The wind howls, audible silence, as Sirius fidgets with his fingers again. </p><p>“Harry makes me happy, too,” he says, suddenly looking up again. “Makes me smile. You’d probably like to know that, too. That...<em> you’re </em>still making me happy in a...indirect way. Because Harry’s your…” Sirius trails off. Eyes wander over the stones. </p><p>“He’s just like you. Both of you—he’s the best of both of you, so, you know, he’s all of you,” Sirius’ mouth quirks up in a half grin as he rambles. And then he sniffs, pushes a hand underneath his nose. He inhales deeply, and, in a rush says: “<em> I’m still alive </em>.” </p><p>Sirius stares directly at James’ name.</p><p>“I didn’t—...Rem’s still alive,” Sirius finishes, pressing his mouth closed again. He nods, eyes shifting away. “We’re...we’re both still here, uh...We’re alive, and, uhm...I didn’t...mean...to be.” </p><p>Sirius clears his throat.</p><p>“He’s happy, too,” he says, nodding though his voice breaks. “Yeah, he’s...he’s—” Sirius tries to breathe again, “<em> happy </em>.”</p><p>“He’s with Tonks.” </p><p>He stares down at a brown patch of dead grass sticking up out of the snow. </p><p>“My cousin, Tonks. Meda’s kid, I...don’t know if you remember. She’s...<em> good </em>,” Sirius nods slowly, letting his head fall back, hanging limp from his neck briefly to look up at the sky. “The best of us, you know? Best of the Blacks—” Sirius’ face pinches, he looks down again, “—not really a Black. Pink. And vibrant, and whole, and—better...the better version of me,” Sirius half-grins, no humor, “you know, at least that’s—” He stops, and presses his hand to the side of his face, closing his eyes. </p><p>He tries to breathe again. Shakes his head. </p><p>“That’s not true, she’s not...She’s a <em> good </em>person…” Sirius says, sincerity making his throat clench around the sick syrupy thickness of it. </p><p>Sirius moves his hand, curling his fingers to press on his lip, chin resting on his palm. </p><p>“...She’s so, <em> so </em> much better than me,” he whispers, lower lip quivering. “He’s so <em> happy </em> ...she makes him smile.” ‘ <em> Smile </em>’ comes out as barely anything more than air. Sirius drops his arms to his sides. </p><p>“I hate her,” he says, then chortles once, shoulders jostling with it. “Not really, she’s...she’s so <em> good </em> . <em> They’re </em> good. And that’s...that’s... <em> good </em>,” Sirius’ mouth curls into a sneer around the word. </p><p>“And everyone else gets to be happy, and then there’s...you know, us,” Sirius says. He exhales a shaky breath. “...I want so badly for me to be dead and you alive.” </p><p>Sirius clenches his hands into tight fists at his sides. </p><p>“You would be <em> so happy </em> , Prongs, I can <em> see it </em>.” </p><p>The harshness with which he spat the words, ‘<em> see it </em>’, was more than he intended. </p><p>“That’s how it was <em> supposed </em>to be, you know? And now…” Sirius laughs shortly, eyes falling shut. </p><p>“Remus doesn’t love me anymore...even though he said he—” Sirius bites down on the words. Pauses. Face screws up again. His body rocks with a shudder. </p><p>“...It’s been a long, long time since you’ve been gone,” Sirius says, looking again at the gravestone with a small nod, “and at the same time…” Sirius’ features twist into a deep frown, “it <em> feels like </em> it’s been a night. <em> One long fucking night </em>…” </p><p>Sirius shuffles his foot in the snow. </p><p>“And <em> Remus </em>had twelve years to realize he didn’t love me anymore, but I’ve only had the five, so…” Sirius stops again, staring at some point in the distance down the street where everything just slips off into the dark. </p><p>“ We...were gonna be together forever,” Sirius says, and immediately turns his head to press his face into the crook of his arm. </p><p>He shakes his head hard, furious at all the tears he still has. </p><p>He raises his head quickly, sucking in breath, unable to see past the onslaught of liquid gathering in his eyes and rolling down his cheeks. </p><p>“I <em> really, really </em> want you to come home, now, Prongs,” Sirius <em> hears </em>how miserable he sounds. Like the pitiful whining was coming from someone else. He pauses. Lifts his shoulders, as though in helplessly shrugging. “I’m all alone,” he says, voice full of tears. Feels selfish.</p><p>“I just...I want…” He stops. Without much thought, he sits down heavily, legs outstretched and bent at the knees. He twists his hands together in his lap, and stares at the gravestones of <em> James Potter </em> and <em> Lily Evans Potter </em>. </p><p>Sirius chokes. He keels forward, shoulder hunched over his legs, body wracked with sobs he cries into his hands. It’s the closest he’s been to his best friend in twenty years.</p><p><br/>

  <b> <em>- Earlier, 12 Grimmauld Place -</em> </b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>He feels it. In this old cracked house. Spiritually broken. Or maybe it was just him.</p><p>The irony of the situation was not lost on him. </p><p>Ending up right back in the very same house he tried so hard to get away from. Sixteen years in one prison, a few precious years of freedom he can’t bring himself to think about, some wartime funtimes, a dozen more in another prison, one in a <em> cave </em> , and finally, the journey makes its roundabout way right back where it all started. This old <em> cursed house.  </em></p><p>Circle of life. </p><p>Sirius Black does not feel like he is alive. </p><p>Or rather, he feels very much like he is alive and that whole feeling is entirely too much of <em> too much </em>and so he would really rather stop right now please. </p><p>But that’s always a nonstarter. Always. Never. <em> Harry </em>. </p><p>Shut him and his rooftop-flung thoughts right up. </p><p>Sirius sways gently, side to side, in front of the window. It’s raining outside. Really proper rain. Dark skies and thunder cracks. Very <em> moody </em> , very <em> angsty </em>weather...he picks at the skin on his lip. </p><p>Somewhere below him in the house, a floorboard creaks and he flinches. </p><p>And then there’s Moony. </p><p><em> There; </em> Moony. Remus. <em> Moony </em>. </p><p>Asked him <em> not </em> to call him Moony. But then never minds the slipups. Or doesn’t say anything. Maybe too polite. <em> Always </em> too polite. Most of the time. To <em> Others </em> . Only ever to Others. Never to <em> us </em>. We always knew Moony as that sarcastic, witty little bastard. Never without a retort, that Moony. Our best friend, Moony. The love of my life, Moony. </p><p>Moony is <em> polite </em> to Sirius now. Sirius is <em> Others </em>. </p><p>Sirius hasn’t been Others since he was eleven years old. </p><p>Only, no, <em> thatisn’tquitetrue.  </em></p><p>Sirius closes his eyes. Reaches a bony hand into his mind, feeling around in murky water for some semblance of memory. </p><p>
  <em> The fighting, the avoidance of eyes, the crying in the bathroom, the days without contact.  </em>
</p><p>Sirius supposes the otherness had come sometime sooner. He <em> remembers </em> the otherness having come. Take root somewhere between their two hearts and not let fo for <em> anything. </em></p><p>Though, if Sirius remembers, he can’t put the blame solely on the root for not letting go. </p><p>Sirius wouldn’t let go of it either. Sirius, the one who pruned it, and watered it, and watched it grow. <em> Made </em>it grow. Sirius was the one who— </p><p>Oh, we’re getting <em> dangerously </em>close to October now. </p><p>Octobers are Not Allowed. </p><p>Not Novembers, because Novembers are just as bad. </p><p>Decembers can exist—but only <em> just.  </em></p><p>Septembers stop somewhere in the middle and jump somewhere comfy—somewhere after the New Year. </p><p>Sirius flinches at the soft knock on the bedroom door behind him. The door is slightly ajar already. It opens completely without waiting for a response. It’s Moony, Sirius knows. Moony is the only one who comes in here. </p><p>He comes in quietly. Walking a little bit in Sirius’ direction, and stopping a respectable distance away. To far, even, to reach out and touch. Too far, even, to see his eyes well, if Sirius turned around. </p><p>“Alright?” Moony asks softly, because Moony only ever asked Sirius things <em> softly </em>now. </p><p>Sirius unfocuses his faze outside the window, and looks at the reflection in the dark glass instead. He can see himself in it. He can see Moony. Sirius turns around, uncomfortable by their dark, unnaturally haloed silhouettes. Immediately, Moony’s brows furrow. </p><p>“Why are you all wet?” </p><p>Sirius looks down at himself. It’s true, he’s all wet. His clothes are dripping, hair, end of his nose, tips of his fingers. The spot he’s standing on the floor is quite damp. He’s wet because he’d been out on the roof, and hadn’t come in when it rained. He’d only just closed the window a moment ago, before Moony came in. </p><p>Sirius sniffs, realizing his nose is running also. </p><p>Remus comes toward him—right up towards him. Crowding into his space, telegraphing his movements as he goes to take Sirius’ arm. </p><p>Sirius yanks the limb back and recoils, back hitting the window, setting the glass arattle. </p><p>Remus recoils the same, one foot retreating and then the other. He stares at him in surprise for a split second, then schools his expression into calm. </p><p>“Sirius? What’s wrong?” </p><p>Sirius scoffs—ugly, derisive. </p><p>“Don’t touch me,” he says. </p><p>“Okay,” Remus replies, maintaining his distance. Careful composure. </p><p>Sirius turns, and pushes his hands through his wet, tangled hair. </p><p>“Don’t <em> touch </em>me,” He spits again, turning his head slightly over his shoulder as to throw the words in Remus’ direction. </p><p>“<em> Okay </em>,” Remus says again. </p><p>Sirius bites into his already bleeding lip, and reaches up to tap the window. The rain is tapping on it from the other side. QUite a nice little morse code dance. </p><p>“Don’t touch me,” Sirius murmurs, repeating himself for the third time. He repeats it twice more, but the words have lost all their meaning. </p><p>“Sirius, would you like to step away from the window?” Remus asks. </p><p>“No,” Sirius says without actually giving himself a second to register what Remus had asked. Then, he blinks, and realizes the right answer really <em> was </em>‘no’ anyway. </p><p>“You’ll get sick.” </p><p>Sirius shrugs. </p><p>“I’ll get better,” he mutters almost bitterly. </p><p>“Not if you stay in wet, cold clothes all the time.” </p><p>“I <em> lived </em> in ‘ <em> wet, cold clothes all the time’ </em>for twelve fucking years, what do you care?” </p><p>“You’re not in Azkaban anymore, Sirius.” </p><p>“Yes, the lack of Dementors was a clue.” </p><p>“You’re shivering, Sirius.” </p><p>Sirius moves. He pulls his heavy wet shirt off with some difficulty, then his trousers next, stepping out of them and kicking them over to a corner of the room. </p><p>“Happy?” Sirius spits, only sparing a glance back at Moony before returning back to face the window and staring at the rain running down in rivulets. </p><p> Remus walks away a few steps, then comes back. Sirius feels something wrap around his shoulders, and flinches hard, but it’s only a blanket. Sirius’ eyes fall closed as he allows this. </p><p>“No,” Remus mutters, more to himself than Sirius, but Sirius barks out a laugh. </p><p>Remus tentatively puts a hand on his shoulder. Sirius shrugs out of it. Instead, Remus hovers by his side, and, in that way, without touching him, leads him toward the bed almost perfunctorily. </p><p>When Sirius glances at his face, he sees the most miserable, tired expression he’s ever seen. </p><p>Sirius chortles again, and shoves him in the chest. Remus stumbles back a step, and then fixes him with a wide-eyed, angry stare. </p><p>“Get the fuck out,” Sirius says bitterly, all traces of unsane mirth gone from his eyes. </p><p>Remus stands up straight, upper lip <em> curling </em> with rage, shoulders tense with it, skin practically <em> radiating </em> it. Sirius can <em> taste </em>it. Whatever is on the tip of Remus’ tongue. His fingertips. He wants him to crack. </p><p>Then, he deflates. </p><p>Just like that, in an instant. All the anger is gone. Drained out of him. And the miserable look is back. Sirius can’t bear to look at it. <em> Not Worth It. </em>He fixes his eyes on the floor, and holds tight to his anger for the both of them. </p><p>Remus leaves quietly, leaving the door cracked open. </p><p>Sirius’ mouth twists into an ugly sneer, and then he collapses onto the bed face down, pulling the blanket up over the entirety of his cutled form, closing his eyes tightly. </p><p>He hears the creaking of the stairs as Moony goes down them. Sirius shifts around, and changes into Padfoot, listening to him downstairs. He can hear what room he’s in—the kitchen. A chair scraping. Silence. Or—if anything is going on, it’s too quiet for Sirius to hear. </p><p>There is nothing else for a long time. </p><p>The storm outside continues, and Sirius pretends like he doesn’t hate it. </p><p>Then someone comes into the house. </p><p>He hears the front door opening. Closing. Footsteps. Creaks on the floor. A scrape of the chair in the kitchen. </p><p>Padfoot lifts his head, and then jumps off the bed without making a sound. He learned how to move silently as Padfoot in Azkaban...<em> no, no...it was Hogwarts, first </em>. He puts the skill to use and creeps quietly to the door, where he shoves his muzzle in the crack Remus left between the door and the wall and noses it open. </p><p>Sirius pauses on the middle of the staircase. From here, he can peer between the rails of the bannister into the sitting room where Remus and the person who just arrived are. The person is Tonks. Remus and Tonks sit on the same couch, murmuring to each other. </p><p>Remus has his legs all stretched out, hands folded over his chest. Sirius can only see the side of his face, but Tonks is turned towards him, so Sirius can see all of <em> her </em>face, and she’s looking at Remus like...like...like Sirius forgot how he used to look at Remus. </p><p>He remembers now. Seeing it again, as it is. Seeing it on someone else’s face. </p><p>And Remus is looking at her. </p><p>They’ve been looking at each other the whole war. </p><p>Sirius goes back upstairs. In the room, he changes back to human form, grabs a long coat, and his wand. From there, it’s as simple as sliding open the window again, slipping out onto the roof, and apparating with a <em> crack! </em>, masked by thunder.  </p><p><br/>
<br/>

  <b> <em>- Back in the Cemetery -</em> </b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Snow crunches underneath Harry’s feet as he walks past all the gravestones. He can already see the black mass of fur curled right in between the two he was walking towards. Harry feels his chest constrict at the sight. </p><p>Slowly, he approaches, casting a glance at the names of his parents before focusing his attention on the sleeping dog he crouches in front of. </p><p>“Pads…” he says quietly. </p><p>His ear twitches, but otherwise he stays still. Asleep. Harry doesn’t know if he’s ever seen Sirius sleep so deeply. Right between the gravestones of his parents, in a cemetery entirely too fitting for the form of Sirius’ animagus. </p><p>“Padfoot,” Harry tries again, a bit louder now, and Padfoot tenses. </p><p>After a moment, his eyes drop open. He lifts his head. And then he’s Sirius again, pushing himself up into a sitting position. He’s soaking wet, skin pale as the snow, lips dangerously blue. </p><p>“Harry,” Sirius says, and sniffs. Sirius looks around, the lines of his face deepening as he frowns. </p><p>“What are you doing here?” He asks, gaze coming to rest again on Harry. </p><p>“I went to Grimmauld Place...Remus was there. We couldn't find you.” </p><p>Sirius does nothing for a moment, and then nods. He wipes his hands on his pants, and goes to rise. Harry holds out a hand, and Sirius’ takes it, and they stand together. </p><p>“I figured you’d be here,” he says. </p><p>Sirius looks over his shoulder at the gravestones. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Sirius says. </p><p>Harry shrugs, still holding his hand. </p><p>“It’s alright. I come here, too.” </p><p>Sirius turns and looks at him again, the shadows underneath his eyes are darker than usual. Sirius sighs, shoulders sagging low. </p><p>Harry squeezes his hand. </p><p>“You’ve gotta get out of that house, Sirius.” </p><p>Harry’s chest constricts again as Sirius just closes his eyes. </p><p>“Come on, Mate...you ready to go?” </p><p>Sirius opens his eyes again, and they both look back at the gravestones. After a second, he nods. </p><p>Harry grips his hand tighter, staring at the two names. </p><p>“Bye, guys.” </p><p>
  <em> Lily Evans Potter. James Potter.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Crack!  </em>
</p><p>The wind howls. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>- Harry’s - </em> </b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry you had to come get me,” Sirius says as Harry hands him a steaming mug and sits beside him on the orange couch in his living room. </p><p>“No worries,” Harry says. </p><p>Sirius nods, and sips his drink. </p><p>“Did something happen?” Harry asks. </p><p>Sirius lowers his mug, tip of his tongue burned. He raises an eyebrow at Harry’s question. </p><p>“At Grimmauld Place.” </p><p>Sirius looks into his mug again. </p><p>“Ah,” he says. </p><p>Harry waits. </p><p>“No, not...no, Harry,” Sirius says, and looks at him again to reassure him that it’s the truth. </p><p>Harry hums. </p><p>“Just...one of those days?” Harry asks, scoffing in half-amusement, looking away. </p><p>Sirius manages a small grin. </p><p>“Perhaps,” he says. </p><p>Harry nods. </p><p>“Yeah, I…” he sighs, “I get that.” </p><p>“Are you alright?” Sirius asks, concern seeping into his voice. </p><p>Harry looks at him again quickly. </p><p>“Yeah, of course, everything’s fine right now, just…” He trails off. </p><p>Sirius nods. </p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“...It must suck living in that house.” </p><p>Sirius laughs, the force of it knocking him back against the couch. </p><p>“Yeah, it does suck,” he says. </p><p>“Have you ever thought of...leaving?” </p><p>Sirius cocks an eyebrow at Harry. </p><p>“To <em> where </em>?” He asks, not meaning it to sound so cynical. He sips his tea again. </p><p>Harry bites his lip. </p><p>“You could stay here.”</p><p>Sirius thinks back to earlier. The window. Remus. His overall...<em> instability </em>. </p><p>He can’t do that to Harry. </p><p>“I don’t know, Harry, I…” Sirius pauses. He fixes Harry with a sincere look. </p><p>“You have to live your life. I can’t come in a be a burden on you like that, I can’t—” </p><p>“No, Padfoot, don’t do that.” </p><p>Sirius stops with a sigh, and leaned forward to set his mug on the table. </p><p>“I need <em> you </em>, Padfoot. You’re my...you’re my family,” Harry says, leaning forward. “You promised during the war that we’d stay together.” </p><p>Sirius’ brow furrows. </p><p>“We are together,” he says quickly, “I’ve never left you” </p><p>“I know,” Harry is fast to reply. “So just...just move in with me, okay? You don’t deserve to spend all your time in that house. I have plenty of room, <em> more </em>than plenty of room, and...well, I’d like the company.” </p><p>Sirius bites his lip. Unsure if his company is the kind Harry really wants. Sure, it’s all fine and well and good when they see each other, when Sirius is Right and <em> Stable </em>. When Sirius can smile, and laugh, and joke, and talk about James and Lily without losing his fucking mind. When he’s not angry, or confused, or…</p><p>“Please, Padfoot, at least give it a try?” Harry asks. “We’re family. We’re here for each other. I know you’re here for me...let me be here for you. Please.” </p><p>Sirius looks down. </p><p>“We <em> are </em> family, Harry,” He says quietly. </p><p><em> That house </em> . He <em> detests </em> it. Every sodding <em> inch </em> of it. Maybe...maybe if he wasn’t there anymore, it’d be better...like when he moved in with James in sixth year. <em> Everything is better when you’re out of that damn house </em>. </p><p>Sirius leans back, and scrapes his hands through his hair. He looks to Harry, who watches him, anticipation clear on his face. </p><p>Really, how did Sirius think he was ever going to be able to say no to him anyway? </p><p>“Alright…” Sirius says quietly, “we can...try that out,” he murmurs. </p><p>Harry’s face breaks out into a grin. James’ grin. </p><p>Sirius takes his mug again, and looks around. The cheerful flat with thrift store furniture, three lit candles on the counter separating the living room from the kitchen fill the room with smells of warmth and baked goods, a plant dominates an entire corner, reaching up towards the ceiling, a muggle television, a large collection of films stacked in the cupboard beneath it. </p><p>Sirius imagines calling it home. His and Harry’s home. The way it could have been. </p><p>Sirius lets himself smile a little bit.</p>
