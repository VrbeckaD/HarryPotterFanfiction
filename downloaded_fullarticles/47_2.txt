    <p>
  <span>In her defence, Luna gave him plenty of notice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It’s not her fault that everyone who wants to take her place on the lease is either useless, a complete and utter moron, or both.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He truly didn’t know how he’d gotten so lucky with her. Five years of having the perfect flatmate gone just like that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He can’t blame her for wanting to move in with her boyfriend. If he had a boyfriend, god knows he’d want to live with him instead of Luna, much less some random person he’s never met. (Though Draco, personally, doesn’t think he could handle knowing his boyfriend is also dating someone else. Luna seems happy, and she even seems to </span>
  <em>
    <span>get on</span>
  </em>
  <span> with Rolf’s boyfriend, so he doesn’t try to talk her out of it. Too much.)</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re going to have to pick someone sooner or later,” Luna says on a Thursday. “I move out in a week.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know.” He’s known that for </span>
  <em>
    <span>months,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and now… now he’s starting to think he might have to ask his godfather for help.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He can’t fathom doing that. He knows his godfather will help him, and he won’t even ask too many questions, but his godfather has already helped him so much. He can’t ask him for more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So he has to figure </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know… Harry’s just heard that his landlord is converting his flat. He has to find a new place to live.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, Jesus Christ, Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luna knows about Harry. Luna’s the only friend of his who </span>
  <em>
    <span>knows</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry. It’s his own fault; he introduced them, after all. He can’t be blamed for not thinking they’d get on; it’s hardly the first time he’s underestimated a situation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Absolutely not,” he says. He can’t fathom living with Harry Potter. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Or, rather, he can’t fathom being </span>
  <em>
    <span>flatmates</span>
  </em>
  <span> with Harry Potter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I understand if you’d rather talk to your godfather about handling the entire flat on your own, but I think Harry would be a good flatmate. He’s quiet, clean, and his parents can cover his rent if one of his jobs falls through.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco has to admit that she makes a good point.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not asking him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can ask him for you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He knows he doesn’t deserve a friend like Luna. That Luna, despite all her quirks and her strange, dreamy bluntness, is good and kind and values her friends highly. He knows that if he really begs and pleads, Luna might even be persuaded to remain his flatmate, but he isn’t going to do that to her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Besides, maybe living with Harry Potter will be the final kick in the arse he needs to get rid of this childish infatuation. Lord knows it’s gone on long enough, and Draco desperately needs something to just end it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Seeing Harry intermittently at events his godfather throws, or sometimes out with Luna, is not enough to do that.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Living with him just might be. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After all, everyone knows that living with your friends – and even, quite often, your significant other – is all too frequently the thing that kills any sort of warmth between you.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Why, then, should it not also apply to killing ridiculous infatuations that have gone on years too long?</span>
</p><hr/>
<p>
  <span>Luna shows Harry the flat while Draco is at his obnoxious valet job. He detests everything about dealing with rich people as a service worker – especially when they recognise him, which happens far too often for his own comfort. He never thinks he looks overly like his father until someone he’s never met gives him that </span>
  <em>
    <span>look.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wonders if this would happen if he took more after his mother.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wonders if his godfather would help him pay for cosmetic surgery. But no – that’s absurd. He doesn’t have any issue with how he looks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If only his father didn’t look so much like him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Needless to say, he is </span>
  <em>
    <span>far</span>
  </em>
  <span> from in a wonderful mood when he arrives home, and the last thing he wants, as he takes off his shoes in the foyer, is for Luna to call him into the sitting room where she’s sat with Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That is, of course, exactly what happens.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He tries to steel himself, but Harry Potter is as gorgeous right now as he ever has been, wearing a lazy outfit Draco would never let himself be caught dead in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello,” he greets.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So,” Harry says, cutting right to the heart of the matter: “what’s the catch?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you mean by that?” Draco asks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I mean this is an amazing flat in a good neighbourhood, and I can </span>
  <em>
    <span>afford</span>
  </em>
  <span> it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oh. That. “My godfather owns it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry raises an eyebrow. “And he doesn’t let you live here for free?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s tried, but I’m not going to accept his charity. It’s enough that he drastically undercharges for the flat rather than sell it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius would kill him if he knew he were charging you at all. If </span>
  <em>
    <span>Sirius</span>
  </em>
  <span> had a spare flat, I think he’d be offended if I tried to even pay the utilities.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco rolls his eyes. “Regulus isn’t Sirius, is he?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The truth of the matter is that Draco is </span>
  <em>
    <span>fairly</span>
  </em>
  <span> certain Regulus is taking his rent checks and depositing them in some sort of trust. For all he knows, Regulus has never cashed a single one of Luna’s checks; he wouldn’t put it past his godfather to try to be sneaky like that. He’s never asked, mostly because he doesn’t want to know the answer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Besides, it’s hardly as if Regulus needs any extra income.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did he decorate this sitting room?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No. I did.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry looks around and snorts. “Should have figured.” He rolls his eyes, and Draco bites back a retort. He does need a flatmate. “All right,” Harry says. “But I’m only moving in because my dad will </span>
  <em>
    <span>kill</span>
  </em>
  <span> me if I get involved in a dispute with my landlord. And worst case, I can always have Sirius talk sense into Regulus.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco does snort at that. “Good luck with </span>
  <em>
    <span>that.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> It’s not that Sirius and Regulus hate each other. Really. Draco knows they don’t. But they are </span>
  <em>
    <span>quite</span>
  </em>
  <span> different people, and Regulus is cleverer than people give him credit for (though, to be fair, that might just be because most people who make it as footballers aren’t very clever to begin with). They’re both grown men, besides; there’s no reason for Regulus to listen to his brother.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So Luna moves out in a week, and my lease is up in three… I assume I can move in any time after Luna leaves?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Draco says. “I’ll have Regulus get someone to draw up a lease addendum.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This is a good thing. He’ll realise how annoying and disgusting and obnoxious Harry is, and wonder how he ever could have fancied someone like him in the first place, and then it’ll all be fine.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Maybe one day they’ll all have a laugh about it. One day far, far into the future. Once he’s completely over Harry Potter. Perhaps they’ll even become friends.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Well, he can dream, can’t he?</span>
