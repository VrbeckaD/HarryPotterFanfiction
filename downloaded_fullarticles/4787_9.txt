<p>Secret Divulged</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry groaned. “You’re not playing fair,” he whispered. </p>
<p>Draco laughed softly, snuggling closer. “Have I ever?”</p>
<p>Sighing, Harry said, “I don’t want this to make things weird.”</p>
<p>Draco hummed. “Are you trying to tell me you’re married?” </p>
<p>“What?” Harry drew back. “No!”</p>
<p>Draco smirked. “Are you a Potter from the future who’s here to save the world, but who got distracted by my captivatingly gorgeous body?” </p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes. “You’re impossible.” </p>
<p>“No, I’m gorgeous. Get it right.” Draco chuckled as Harry stuck his tongue out at him. “Right, now that you’re out of your funk, tell me what’s wrong.”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry stared at Draco. </p>
<p>Slowly, Draco’s smile faded. “You look so serious. Is it that bad?” </p>
<p>Harry exhaled. “No. At least, I don’t think so? It just may not be something you’re prepared to hear now. Maybe in the future, when…if we’re still together, but as it is, it’s probably too early— Mmf.” </p>
<p>Sighing into Draco’s mouth, Harry relaxed as he was kissed calm again. </p>
<p>“You were babbling,” Draco said when they broke for air. “Now, just tell me. Whatever it is, I’ll deal with it.” </p>
<p>“I’m in love with you,” said Harry. And closing his eyes, he waited. </p>
