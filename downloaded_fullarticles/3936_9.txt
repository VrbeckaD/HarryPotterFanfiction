    <p>The war. Completely successful in destroying both happiness and misery. It left none unaffected, and none affected more than the worlds favorite hero, me, Harry Potter. Since the war, I constantly felt as if I was holding my breath. Waiting for something more. For a reason to get up and carry on. Another dark lord perhaps? I had hoped that becoming an Auror would give me a reason, and it did. But it wasn't what I was looking for. I felt empty. Like a piece of my soul had been ripped out. I supposed it had… sort of.</p><p>It had been two years since the war. I had never gotten back together with Ginny, neither of us had really felt it, you can imagine why. Auror training was the only reason I got out of bed anymore. Ron and I had been roommates for a short while but he grew tired of my antics, well no, he bought a house with Hermione, not important though. It was humorous how clean my house was. I'm pretty sure I hadn't cleaned since Ron left, but I really only slept, fucked, and got ready there so I suppose there wasn't much room for mess.</p><p>*******************</p><p>Harry's eyes fluttered open, and he was met with an immediate onslaught of pain. Hangover. A regular occurrence for Harry, either because he decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol or because he had spent the night at the club. This time, it was the latter.<br/>
“Get up,” Harry shoved at the man next to him, Nate? Or Nash, maybe? “I'm taking a shower, be gone when I get out.” The man grumbled and tore the warm covers of off his naked body and began to gather his belongings as Harry set off down the hallway for the shower, not bothering to close the door.</p><p>He turned the water all the way up, an unconscious action hoping for pain. In his book, pain was better than empty. Today would be his last day. He was tired, all the expectations were dragging him down. Be the perfect auror, marry the perfect girl, save the world yet again. It was too much. Why was that so hard for people to grasp. He had been calling out for the past year, hoping someone could help. He stopped eating, he stopped sleeping, he started drinking, he started smoking. But of course, no one really noticed, seeing as he had no problems with Auror training. It took awhile to come to terms with how he felt. But was there, he had made it, and he was done. So today would be his last day.</p><p>Harry scrubbed away the dirt, cum, and the pain. He turned off the scalding hot water and stepped out of the shower. Every day his reflection came as a surprise to him, he still looked like his father, but he was skinnier and more feminine. Because of the Dursley’s malnutrition, he never grew into the tall toned man his father had been. He had the same tanned skin, but with bags under his eyes, higher cheekbones, a slightly sharper jaw, and fuller lips. He had his mother’s upturned, green eyes, and his father’s messy hair but it had calmed down a little since he grew it long, and surprisingly he gained a few freckles on the bridge of his nose, which as of last month, was now pierced with a septum ring.<br/>
</p><p>He decided against going to work today, and he slipped on his ripped black jeans, black and white short-sleeved floral button up, and his new dragon-hide boots he got from Mrs. Weasley. Harry wanted to spend his last day in peace, lounging on the beach. He grabbed the picnic he had prepared the night before, a basket full of his favorite food and drink. He might not have had a good life but he wanted a good last day. So he apparated to Sunny Sands beach in Kent, and just sat, watching the waves hit the beach.<br/>
He ended up falling asleep, and in his state didn't notice a man walking over to him and placing an ornate pendant around his neck.</p>
