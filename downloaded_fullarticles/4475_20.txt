    <p>A week after the end of his fourth year the Fifteen year old Harry Potter sits in Dudley's second bedroom, on the bed. His Uncle had locked the door, not that it really mattered to Harry as he wanted to be alone to think and he could unlock easily with his magic. He is thinking about the previous school year, the fact that he had been entered into a dangerous tournament that he was forced to compete in. Harry had found out that he didn't have to compete, he in fact had several ways to forfeit the tournament, one being that his magical guardian could pull him out of the tournament and the other is that the Headmaster of the school could pull him out of the tournament which the Headmaster obviously didn't do.</p><hr/><p>He gets up from his bed, he goes to check the door which is most definitely locked. Harry goes over to his magical pouch that Hermione had given him, he takes out some of his lock picking tools that he had picked up during the year, he heads to the door, he uses the lock picking tools in the lock (as he doesn't wish to waste his magic on such a task) until he hears it unlock, he opens the door and says to himself "I'd make an awesome cat-burglar and I don't even have to use my magic" Harry walks downstairs, the house is empty as the Dursleys had gone out for the day, to pick up Auntie Marge and spent the day with her before returning so Harry heads into the kitchen to make himself something to eat, after he had finished his meal Harry uses his lock picking skills to unlock the door to the Cupboard Under the Stairs to grab his cloak and some other things, he then frees Hedwig from her cage, he then disappears in a whirl of Indigo smoke.</p><hr/><p>An hour later Harry is in Gringotts Bank talking to the Goblin King who is telling Harry about all of his vaults/accounts, the fact that he is emancipated thanks to Dumbledore allowing him to compete in the tournament, that Dumbledore had been stealing from his vaults to pay his many debts that he had collected (lucky Dumbledore never knew about the Peverell Ore and Gemstone Vault or it would be empty) and that Dumbledore had planned to marry him off to Ginny Weasley much to Harry's disgust as he sees Ginny as his sister and nothing else, Harry, in fact doesn't wish to marry any girls. Harry also finds out that he is something known as a carrier, a male who can get pregnant. The goblins give him some Birth Control Pills which Harry will start to use once he starts having sex along with some Moon Tea Pills to serve as a morning after prevention to make sure that he doesn't get pregnant. Harry finds out that his true mother's name is Queen Regina Mills who had slept with a man named Stefan Lucas who had fathered a daughter with a woman named Anita Lucas, Stefan had taken Anita's last name as he didn't have one.</p><hr/><p>Harry is pretty pissed off that he hadn't been told of his carrier status and that he was adopted, he messages his friend Hermione using a magical messenger to tell her of his status and his true parentage before he returns to the Dursley house. The response from Hermione is soo sudden that Harry hadn't even sat down to relax before the Dursley doorbell rings, he opens the door to find his best-friend/sister standing at the door, as soon as the door opens Hermione rushes inside to give Harry a hug and she starts talking a mile a minute about everything she knew about Carriers as her mother stands behind her looking at Harry with a look of shock on her face once she hears her daughter say the word Carrier and she suddenly says "Hermione, you can tell him later, I want to offer my congratulations to your friend on his Carrier Status, and that I hope that he is taking Birth Control" giving Harry a certain look that he's seen on Hermione, giving Harry an idea on where the look had come from.</p><p>"yes, I have some Birth Control Pills from the Goblins after I had found out, I didn't even know about Carriers until now, I was shocked that I was one"</p><p>"not even from the teachers at Hogwarts ?" asks Mrs Granger with shock in her tone.</p><p>"no, but I have a feeling as to why, I know that Hermione has read almost every book in the Hogwarts Library and the Muggle Library so it's obvious as to how Hermione knows about Carriers" says Harry with a smirk as he says the last bit gaining a smack from Hermione. Harry invites Mrs Granger inside, they go into the living room where the three of them talk until the front door opens and in comes the Dursley Family with Marge, when they see Harry, Hermione and Mrs Granger in the Living Room they are shocked, Vernon is turning purple, Petunia sees Mrs Granger and smiles at her while Dudley is narrowing his eyes at Hermione as if he is trying to figure out who she is, Marge is the only one who isn't shocked so she asks Harry "who are they, boy ?"</p><p>"this is Hermione and her mother, Mrs Granger, they had decided to come over, well mostly Hermione but Mrs Granger is supervising the visit" Harry arches his eyebrow daring his relatives to say something.</p><p>"is she your girlfriend or something ?" asks Dudley getting two looks of disgust at the thought of them being together making Dudley say "I guess that's my answer"</p><p>"damn, Dud, Hermione and I are like brother and sister"</p><p>"really ?" asks Petunia.</p><p>"yea, she, in fact goes to my school, that's how we met" replies Harry telling his aunt that Hermione was a witch before he says "she's actually the smartest girl in our entire year" Petunia steps back a bit at the wicked look that was on his face before he says "good news auntie, I'm not Lily Potter's son, she adopted me"</p><p>"what ?" asks Marge in shock.</p><p>"yep, that whore as you call her, had adopted me, blood adopted me to be correct, after my true mother had sent me here"</p><p>"what, she didn't want a freak like you ?" asks Vernon. Harry scoffs, he then says "oh, she was just like me" he then suddenly lights a fireball in his hand and says "she was a powerful user of magic, mostly dark magic but still"</p><p>"dark magic ?" asks Hermione.</p><p>"yes, that's what the Goblins told me but I have no idea how she had used her magic and I truthfully don't care, I already have used it against Peter Pettigrew to clear my Godfather who is still a black, it also turns out that a woman named Maleficent is my godmother, as she was the only one who knew of my birth and appointed herself that position"</p><p>"Maleficent ?" asks Hermione wide eyed, she then says in a whisper "that's impossible" she then asks Harry "are you going to try and find her ?"</p><p>"yes, I will but later on, after Voldemort is dead" replies Harry. Marge has enough, she orders her dogs to attack Harry but they don't just like they had never done thanks to the wolf in Harry which Harry explains to Marge who is then knocked out by Harry. He then turns to Vernon and says "your sister won't remember the magic I used, just be glad that I didn't inflate her like last time" Vernon then explodes with rage, he charges at Harry, not caring about Hermione and Mrs Granger seeing him. But he is blasted away by an energy blast that Harry had created, Petunia runs to her husband to take care of him. Mrs Granger and Hermione tell Harry that they need to head home, Harry makes them promise not to tell anyone what goes on inside the house as he can take care of it all by himself, the two Grangers agree before Hermione tells Harry to start taking the birth control pills gaining Petunia and Dudley's attention, Dudley knows what that means and he says to Hermione "I'll make sure that he does, I promise"</p><p>"good, thank you, Dudley" replies Hermione, she walks past Dudley with her mother. The two Grangers leave the Dursley house, leaving Harry to deal with his relatives.</p><hr/><p>That night Harry lays in his bed, he is wide awake as he lays on his back. He is thinking about the many possible reasons that he had been sent away by his mother and none of the reasons that he can think of are selfish reasons as he knows that his mother had loved him from the moment she had found out that she was pregnant with him which is in a letter that had been sent along with him which he had gotten from the Goblins. The letter had been in Lily Potter's vault since she had gotten it the day that Harry had been sent to her and her husband.</p>
