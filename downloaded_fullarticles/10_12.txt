I won't harp on how important it is to maintain our integrity when reading and writing books, especially fanfiction. It falls prey to plagiarism and stealing so often; writers deserve to receive credit for the things they spend days, months, years on! All I ask is that you ask for permission when creating anything off of this plot or book in general. 
Thank you! </p><p align="center">In general, don't copy my:</p><p align="center">1) Plotline</p><p align="center:&gt;2) Original Character(s)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p align=">3 ) If you're going to quote me, cite me (we're taking it back to high school beans of all sizes)</p><p align="center">
  <b>Content Warnings:</b>
</p><p align="center"><b>1) Panic Attacks/Nightmare Sequences -</b> I'm putting this one first because it is of the utmost importance to me. War and trauma - traumas of all types and severity - leave marks on us all that we can't always undo. It can remain with us for the rest of our lives if not taken care of properly. I say this because I am going to show you the consequences of war. If you get triggered easily, I ask you to skip over all chapters with a star symbol in the chapter name (No Time to Die☆). Your comfort is important to me. Please, do not hesitate to private message me if the scenes get too intense. I mean it.</p><p align="center"><b>2) Foul Language - </b>If you're a returning member, you know... you know Remus and Sirius swear like sailors. We're all adults, or you're grown enough to be reading a book, so if you don't like foul language, tough tits.
3) Violence/Major Character Death - Once again, if you are here from Mischief Managed you'll know that I don't hold back. There will be people dying. I was nice last time. This time, important people will be at high risk. I love you all, but as my saying goes: It must be done.</p><p align="center"><b>4) LGBTQ+ / Sexual Content</b> - I think the main reason the last book didn't have a ton of sexual content was because they were so young. Don't get me wrong; 18-year-olds have sex. All the time. But it just wasn't my style. All that to say, it might be a little different this time in terms of smut. For some of you, that's wonderful. Others don't care. We'll see where this goes, honestly. As for LGBTQ+ content... I don't think you'd be here if you were uncomfortable with it. It's literally about two doods being in love.. AND MORE! </p><p align="center"><b>5) Alcohol/Drug Use -</b> I mean... they're big beans now. So. They might dabble in big bean things? I don't know. </p><p align="center">Moving on.</p><p>Cast List</p><p><b>Jude Law</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/05/00/44/05004428ed84e8219fd35bff12b1e24b.jpg" rel="nofollow">Remus Lupin</a></i></p><p><b>Johnny Depp</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/b3/e0/f4/b3e0f4af7f3ca96ae0c3d4b398082a84.jpg" rel="nofollow">Sirius Black</a></i></p><p><b>Daniel Radcliffe</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/ef/ab/0d/efab0dec4c3a11db8e7120ac00f45979.jpg" rel="nofollow">Harry Potter</a></i></p><p><b>Kit Harrington</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/e0/64/68/e06468ea4f01d49aca4322d28ea924eb.jpg" rel="nofollow">James Potter</a></i></p><p><b>Eleanor Tomlinson</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9c/9c/8f/9c9c8f44ec3723e66022c008dc6cdb0d.jpg" rel="nofollow">Lily Evans-Potter</a></i></p><p><b>Rupert Grint</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9f/0e/c2/9f0ec2ffade5c8a729104bbcb00d1aa5.jpg" rel="nofollow">Ronald Weasley</a></i></p><p><b>Emma Watson</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/1d/e9/37/1de937bd0734a6ce4f34b8822a7fd13f.jpg" rel="nofollow">Hermione Granger</a></i></p><p><b>Alex Storm</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/82/29/26/8229265890216cd6905667f78fc03eb6.jpg" rel="nofollow">Regulus Black</a></i></p><p><b>Ralph Fiennes</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9a/2d/47/9a2d4700df8a9e657d65b3967f430fa2.jpg" rel="nofollow">Lord Voldemort</a></i></p><p><b>Ástrid Bergés-Frisbey</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/66/24/0b/66240bdd69ce0adfe84c4bd2b741cdd2.jpg" rel="nofollow">Valentina Bonneville</a></i></p><p><b>Tom Felton</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/65/e5/32/65e532ad02271b2d1891e9c785730881.jpg" rel="nofollow">Draco Malfoy</a></i></p><p><b>Jasson Issacs</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/29/b7/c1/29b7c1ad91f3f8d70a6f80bf6fe7d2b1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Lucius Malfoy</a></i></p><p><b>Nicole Kidman</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c7/40/e6/c740e6e06c40a367d79534ee5276c32e.jpg" rel="nofollow">Narcissa Malfoy</a></i></p><p><b>Sir Michael Gambon</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c6/5e/21/c65e216549505247e75cfe3b9a62082a.jpg" rel="nofollow">Albus Dumbledore</a></i></p><p><b>Adam Driver</b> as <i><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/89/35/8a/89358a0219c48407a3b8a8783e0eddb5.jpg" rel="nofollow">Professor Severus Snape</a></i></p><p>
