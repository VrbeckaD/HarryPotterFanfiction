    <p>It was with a drowsy awareness that Cho Chang realized she was utterly lost. This wasn't the first time that she'd woken up in a place other than her own bed, but waking up in a forest was certainly new. The air felt warm and humid, a stark contrast to the cold and damp of home.</p><p>The last thing she remembered was going to work at the Department of Mysteries. Cho worked in the Space Chamber now, as opposed to the Hall of Prophecy or the Room of Discovery before that. While her work wasn't as groundbreaking as the research of the Discovery Room, at least she no longer had to organize and file documents for endless orbs in the Hall of Prophecy.</p><p>The Space Chamber defied gravity, often allowing the Unspeakables inside it to float gently in the air. It was disorienting, but the soft hum of residual magic was always comforting in its own way. This style of disorientation where Cho was left lost, blinking, and confused was not comforting.</p><p>She removed her wand from her bun, in the process releasing her long black hair from its constraints. Cho cast Finite Incantatem, expecting the General Counter-Spell to remove any illusions or mental influences present. It wouldn't surprise her if Unspeakable Raven had convinced Unspeakable Croaker to test Cho again. Last time he'd hit her with a Confundus that made her think she was back in at the Battle of Hogwarts. She'd broken out of it eventually, but it had been more of a struggle than either of them could've expected.</p><p>Apparently, her appreciation for deepening her understanding of the intricacies of magic was a sign of maladaptive coping. Cho preferred to think of it as her search for truth in the world, her way of doing something because there wasn't any point to anything else.</p><p>Nothing changed when she cast the spell, however, leading her to believe that whatever this was, it was real. It was unfortunate, in her opinion, because she had no idea what to do in this situation. The last time she'd been in a forest was five years ago at the Battle of Hogwarts. She'd been so afraid then, but she wouldn't back down from fighting for her friends and family.</p><p>It was also unfortunate that of the people she'd rebelled for, Marietta was gone, her Mum and Da were gone, Cedric had been gone for years, and none of her other ex-boyfriends or ex-friends were worth mentioning anymore.</p><p>Without any other ideas about what was going on, Cho decided her next order of business was to find out when and where she was. While she doubted she'd actually travelled back in time, it was important to consider all the ways she could have ended up in an unfamiliar forest.</p><p>The forest was expansive, full of plants as far as Cho could see. She didn't recognize any of the surrounding foliage; as she'd been proficient at Herbology, the lack of familiar greenery suggested she was in a completely different biome. With this new information, Cho considered her options. Apparating could be dangerous to attempt depending on how far she was from home due to her average stamina. She didn't have a Portkey, and since it was illegal to make them unauthorised, she didn't trust herself to create one without prior studying. There certainly wasn't a Floo nearby for her to jump through and Cho didn't have her broom with her.</p><p>As she considered how unprepared she was for this type of situation Cho let out a sigh. She'd heard that some folks continued to stay battle-ready after the war; while it was hard for her to stop dwelling on the past and those who were no longer alive, she'd never acted upon that idea. She was an Unspeakable - no one outside of her boss knew who she was or what she did. Cho wasn't strongly connected with anyone; while she had participated in Dumbledore's Army and acts of resistance during Voldemort's Ministry, she wasn't a major player to the public like the Weasleys, Granger, Longbottom, Lovegood, or even Malfoy. She also lived in Muggle London, which made it unlikely that a Pureblood Fanatic would ever find her there.</p><p>A shrunken trunk or a bottomless bag full of supplies would've been extremely useful to have on her person. Instead, she had her work robes and court shoes, both highly inconvenient for anything besides bureaucracy and esoteric research. Cho wished she had her tools from the Room of Discovery on her, then she'd at least have some sharp tools to help her survive in this new place. Her nine N.E. meant nothing if she couldn't survive wherever she was. Still, she was thankful for her wand and decided to Transfigure her court shoes into more practical boots. She regretted the loss of her Jimmy Choos, but it was a sacrifice she'd have to make if she wanted to move around.</p><p>Once the Transfigured boots met her standards, Cho hemmed her work robes to mid-shin length with a Sticking Charm for better mobility. She then cast the Four-Point Spell, Point Me. Since Cho knew nothing about her surroundings, she'd come to the conclusion that going North until she met someone or something helpful was a decent plan. While not all Ravenclaws valued order, Cho did love a good list, so she catalogued everything she knew about her situation as she walked.</p><p>1. The last thing she remembered was the Space Chamber</p><p>2. Her current location was unknown</p><p>3. She had all her body parts attached and she felt physically fine</p><p>4. She didn't know how long she'd been in this new place (but she suspected it hadn't been long as the sunlight and shadows suggested it was still morning)</p><p>5. She needed to find food and shelter (she didn't worry about water - Aguamenti was a lifesaver)</p><p>6. She needed to find people to gain information (but cautiously - no breaking the International Statute of Secrecy or dealing with magical terrorists!)</p><p>7. She needed to find out how to get back home</p><p>Sticks and twigs crackled under Cho's feet as she weaved her way through the forest. She didn't consider being stealthier because it wasn't something she had to worry about at home. When she suddenly sensed a malicious intent, Cho's pondering of her list came to an abrupt stop. Cho felt tense and afraid; the last time she'd felt this weak was when Voldemort had declared Harry dead.</p><p>"誰ですか?" asked an unfamiliar voice. Cho didn't understand what the person was saying.</p><p>"Who are you? What do you want?" Cho asked in English, hoping that it could serve as a lingua franca.</p><p>The sensation of deadly pressure increased in response to her questions. This person had such overwhelming power. While Cho couldn't see this mysterious person, she could feel their killing intent. It was so intense that she began to see her own death.</p><p>"あなたは外人," said the voice. Cho thought the language sounded vaguely familiar, but she was unable to place it in her progressively worrying state.</p><p>Feeling desperate Cho asked "你是谁？你想要什么?" in Mandarin, the only other spoken language she knew. It didn't help. The murderous intent seemed to increase further, leaving Cho unable to think as clearly as she wanted. She felt so powerless under this stranger. It was awful not having control of herself or her actions.</p><p>Cho liked to think that she'd done the best she could to cope with her various traumas. After Cedric's death, she'd joined Dumbledore's Army and learned how to defend herself. Once she graduated, she joined the Department of Mysteries as an Unspeakable to further her pursuit of knowledge. While the Department was compromised due to Voldemort's puppet Ministry, Cho did what she could to protect those she cared about. She knew that the supposed data proving Muggleborns stole magic was baseless, so she snuck as many Muggleborns as she could out of her flat near Charing Cross Road. Later that year she returned to protect Hogwarts and the future of magical Britain, fighting in that last battle with memories of Cedric and her parents leading her actions. After it all, she'd done her best to find a sense of normalcy by throwing herself back into work. She kept herself busy and she always managed to do something - so unlike her current setting!</p><p>Cho felt her eyes water, angry tears biting at her cheeks in frustration. While Cho didn't necessarily feel happy about her life, she still didn't want to die. She was better than this - she survived the Second Wizarding War! She was a brilliant researcher who was skilled in magic far beyond the average witch or wizard. The witch had moved past being the romantic write-off of heroes and rose above it all to reveal herself as a steadfast and determined individual. Yet here she was, legs shaking from this unknown force. Cho promised herself that if she somehow survived this encounter she'd take initiative and become strong enough to destroy future threats. As darkness began to creep over her vision Cho continued to struggle against her body's urge to give up. She would not lose to this stranger!</p><p>Suddenly, it all stopped with the sound of metal clashing against metal. Overcome by the sudden removal of imminent death, Cho fainted.</p>
