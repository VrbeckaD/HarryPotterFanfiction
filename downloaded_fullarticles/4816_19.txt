    <p> </p><p>Percival’s first impression of Mr and Mrs Scamander is one mixed with the strong scent of Earl Grey and rich chocolate.</p><p> </p><p>He arrives at teatime and is immediately pulled into an enthusiastic embrace by a grinning Theseus. They haven’t met since the latter’s nine-month stint in New York City four years ago, part of the bilateral program to improve the increasingly rocky relationship between MACUSA and the British MoM. His friend, Percival notes with some pleasure, has hardly changed at all—still the same charming combination of flaming red hair, lively green eyes, and irreverent smiles, intensified by a force of personality of such magnitude that it never fails to command attention wherever and whenever.</p><p> </p><p>“So glad that you can come down here early,” he says in a lower voice after the initial effusiveness of his welcome. Percival raises his eyebrows, but a gentle press on his shoulder keeps his question silent for the time being. Theseus is already turning around to introduce him to his parents.</p><p> </p><p>“We are very pleased to have you staying with us.” Pleasantries flow easily from Mrs Scamander’s lips, after he has taken her hand. “Theseus talked so much about you.”</p><p> </p><p>Theseus’ stepmother, Katarina, is a beautiful woman with midnight dark hair and elegant features. An excellent lady of the family, Theseus described her once, in that lazy, drifting silence between one drink and another at the end of a long day. Now Percival understands what he meant. Her ivory smooth beauty is a sure mark of her blood, but it’s her refined manners, the way she moves with such aristocratic fluidity, that truly leave no doubt in anyone’s mind of her highborn status.</p><p> </p><p>Mr Scamander, on the other hand, strikes him as a man steeped in perpetual discontent. He must have been a handsome man, once upon a time, but what beauty there was is now marred by the creases on his brow, the constant frown, the small, deep ravines between his eyes—the same eyes Theseus has inherited, and yet with none of their vivacity or good humour. He shakes Percival’s hand with little more than a hint of a smile, varnished by perfunctory politeness, before retreating to his silent contemplation on one disagreeable subject or other.</p><p> </p><p>Percival takes his seat next to Theseus in a high-backed sofa. A cup of tea is pressed into his hand, followed by a plate filled with pastries of all kind. It feels like he has been thrown back in time. Afternoon tea is a tradition that his life back in New York has largely dispensed with. To sit in front of a table laden with tea paraphernalia and plates of dainty cakes and tiers of scones and neatly cut sandwiches reminds him to his childhood, the scent of his grandmother’s perfume, her gentle fingers on his scalp—quite another lifetime.</p><p> </p><p>The conversation flows quietly, along strictly formal lines. Mrs Scamander inquires after his family, his time at Ilvermorny, his choice of profession, all done with the most delicate civility. Proficient in the language of social graces, Percival is aware when a picture of a gracious hostess is being presented to him, and so responds accordingly. The Scamanders may be an old pureblood family, but it seems that his position as an Executive Auror and the right-hand man of MACUSA’s Director of Magical Security, in conjunction with his impeccable lineage, is enough to earn him a warm welcome.</p><p> </p><p>“Where is Newt?” Mr Scamander suddenly speaks, emerging from his silence with an even deeper scowl.</p><p> </p><p>“Away with his animals again, I suppose,” Mrs Scamander answers in a nonchalant tone, but her smile has gained a cool, brittle edge.</p><p> </p><p>“He should be here,” Mr Scamander declares irritably.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe he’s just lost track of time,” Theseus interjects. There is an oddness in his voice that makes Percival glance at him, just in time to catch the strained half-smile thrown his way. “My brother is a real talent with creatures, magical or otherwise.”</p><p> </p><p>“If you could call it 'talent',” Mr Scamander interrupts coldly.</p><p> </p><p>“Especially considering the wide array of opportunities available for one so privileged.” Mrs Scamander sighs, as if unaware of the change in Theseus’ expression. “It is rather unfortunate that his interest lies solely in such a… peculiar direction.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence stretches. There is a clink of china as she puts down her cup. Theseus, Percival notices, is now scowling at his parents, and the expression on his face is so like his father that no one can ever mistake them as anything but father and son.</p><p> </p><p>“He wants to be a Magizoologist. Let him be.”</p><p> </p><p>“There is no such thing as a ‘Magizoologist’, Theseus dear.”</p><p> </p><p>Theseus’ face turns red with anger, but at that moment Mrs Scamander decides to steer the conversation to safer waters. Percival doesn’t think twice before following her lead, glad for an opportunity to escape from the brewing hostility. Father and son are still glowering at each other, but a constant chatter on the upcoming house party is fortunately enough to defuse some of the tension.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course it’s all rather informal,” Mrs Scamander says mildly, after listing the many activities and entertainment planned for the event. Percival limits his answers to one or two harmless comments in return, just enough to keep the conversation going. (After all, how <em>informal</em> a weekend party involving the British Minister of Magic and official representatives from MACUSA could be?)</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose you hunt, Mr Graves?”</p><p> </p><p>“I had the privilege to learn from my late grandfather.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, do you mean former MACUSA President Erastus Graves?”</p><p> </p><p>“Erastus Graves was my great-grandfather. My grandfather Vincentius Graves was Director of Magical Security during the American No-Maj Civil War.”</p><p> </p><p>The topic returns to the many successes in his distinguished family. Percival bears it as well as he can until the questions lead to matrimonial realms—(<em>and you are… unmarried?</em>)—at which point Theseus decides to rescue his friend and excuse themselves from the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, let’s find Newt.”</p><p> </p><p>Percival follows him out of the house through a pair of French doors, down to the extensive grounds of the estate. The sun is blissfully warm on his face, with an open sky above and a soft trim of clouds across the serene blue. He tips his head backward, drinking in the summer air. Before his eyes is a vast parkland dotted by trees and bizarre stone statues, in the shapes of some creatures or other. Those, Theseus explains when he notices Percival’s gaze, are part of the estate’s protection charms, installed by a paranoid great-great-grandfather to guard the family against a hostile neighbouring clan.</p><p> </p><p>“Your family history sounds rather colourful,” Percival says as they pass near one of the statues, this one a cross between a toad and a bird. There is a quiet thrum of magic in the air, and yet different from anything he has ever felt in his life. Older. Deeper. Subtler.</p><p> </p><p>Theseus sighs, shoving his hands deep in his pockets. “It’s the curse of all old families. <em>You</em>’d know, with your pedigree and all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing compared to yours. And this place, it’s really something.”</p><p> </p><p>Theseus snorts. “It’s mostly for appearance, believe me. There’s really no purpose in maintaining so much Unplottable land at this day and age—except, of course, to show it off to envious neighbours and visiting guests.” He pauses, shooting Percival a wry, wistful smile. “I rather envy you, living in the States. None of this Sacred Families bull.”</p><p> </p><p>“We have our share of aristocrat wannabes, believe me,” Percival tells him dryly.</p><p> </p><p>That, at least, makes Theseus laugh. He is one of very few whom Percival has ever brought to the Graves’ family house in Vermont. Neither of them, he remembers, cared much for the experience. It has stood empty ever since, with only loyal house-elves tending to its care.</p><p> </p><p>“You mustn’t worry about Katarina,” Theseus changes the subject as they walk to the direction of a forest that borders the land. “She’s always tossing her horde of nieces to the most eligible bachelors around. You, of course, are a very tempting prospect.”</p><p> </p><p>Percival raises an eyebrow at this. “And you’re not?”</p><p> </p><p>“She knows she won’t get anywhere with me,” Theseus says blithely, but Percival doesn’t miss the edge in his voice. Theseus lost his mother to an accident involving Hippogriffs when he was seventeen, mere weeks before his graduation from Hogwarts. He remembers the short, stilted letters that had lasted for months, until constancy prevailed and they slowly regained their old ease and cheerfulness. There was a passing mention of Theseus’ father’s second marriage about a year later, but the terse wordings discouraged Percival from offering more than a small, polite congratulation in return.</p><p> </p><p>Percival himself was brought up by his grandfather, the most formidable and decorated Auror of his time. There was a period in his childhood where he liked to make up for what knowledge he lacked about his parents with great, romantic notions: brave defenders of justice, tragically silenced by their enemies; misunderstood geniuses, unfortunate victims to their own brilliance; undercover officers of the law, perishing in the line of duty.</p><p> </p><p>The truth found him when he was fourteen. It was nothing short of a rude awakening, and for a long time, Percival hated Vincentius Graves for it; now, he thinks he understands his grandfather better, having walked the same rigid path of an Auror. There are blessings, even in disguise, and he certainly does not envy Theseus’ strained relationship with that bitter man he calls his father.</p><p> </p><p>The forest is beautiful in summer. They follow a trail into its depth, the ground sloping gently under their feet. A rich, earthly scent fills his nose and the gentle sounds that caress his ears are such a far cry from the hustle and bustle of his city that Percival finds himself listening intently to every chirp and drone, rustle and snap.</p><p> </p><p>“There he is.”</p><p> </p><p>Percival’s first glimpse of Newton Scamander is even more memorable than that of his parents.</p><p> </p><p>He notices, first, the pair of large, expressive eyes, so striking in their greenness that even the colour of his hair almost falls mute as the result; almost, because then he turns his head at his brother’s call and a shaft of sunlight falls upon it and drenches every strand with colour. The pale face that stares back at him is strange, a combination of too soft features and too sharp lines, and aside from the abundance of freckles, it bears virtually no resemblance to Theseus’.</p><p> </p><p>He looks young, too young for his long limbs and the peculiar ease in his posture. Sitting high on a sturdy branch of a tree, he looks as much a part of the landscape as the leaves dangling over his head and the deep cracks carved into the tree trunk.</p><p> </p><p>And he has a sleeping Jarvey in his lap.</p><p> </p><p>“A Jarvey?” Theseus sounds both exasperated and amused. “Really, Newt?”</p><p> </p><p>“Perfectly harmless, brother mine.”</p><p> </p><p>His voice is soft and light, the words shaped by the same distinct accent as his brother’s and yet somehow sounding entirely different. Like clothes made in the same cut but from different fabrics.</p><p> </p><p>“Come down,” Theseus tells him. “I want to introduce my friend.”</p><p> </p><p>This is when the striking eyes finally settle on him. They are darker from this angle, but before Percival can determine their <em>exact </em>colour, they already hide behind a sweep of thick, curly hair.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you know what will happen if you forcefully wake a Jarvey from his sleep, Mr Graves?” the boy asks quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Percival watches him for a moment before answering, “It will curse at you.”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a hint of a smile curling on the corners of Newton’s mouth. “You’re not really ignorant, I see. Theseus’ friends usually only know how to throw hexes at each other.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what Aurors usually do,” his brother says wryly.</p><p> </p><p>“Neanderthals with wands, really.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, don’t force <em>this</em> Neanderthal to hex you down the tree.”</p><p> </p><p>Newton purses his lips. As if sensing an imminent change, the Jarvey stirs, eyes flashing, before breaking into a long string of disjointed insults. Percival winces, both at the volume and the vocabulary. His first instinct is to cast a quick <em>Silencio</em> on the screaming Jarvey, but then Newton’s hand moves, fingers slightly parted as they sink into thick brown fur, caressing down the length of its back. He repeats the motion until the creature quietens, screeches petering out to soft, high-pitched whines.</p><p> </p><p>“Good boy,” he murmurs, smiling in a way that reminds Percival to young mothers. “Off you go now.”</p><p> </p><p>The Jarvey makes no move, only its beady eyes darting between Percival and Theseus. Newton sighs and carefully removes the creature from his lap. There is a soft whine of protest, but the Jarvey doesn’t try to reclaim its throne, watching mournfully, instead, as Newton comes down with an easy leap.</p><p> </p><p>“What? I already missed teatime, didn’t I?”</p><p> </p><p>Theseus rolls his eyes, but no one can miss the softness in them when he looks at his brother. “Yes, you dodged that all right. But you can’t miss dinner.”</p><p> </p><p>“Because we have a guest?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t embarrass my friend.”</p><p> </p><p>Newton glances his way, but once more, his gaze doesn’t linger. “Are you easily embarrassed, Mr Graves?” he asks instead, staring at a spot somewhere to Percival’s left.</p><p> </p><p>Percival smiles. “There has been no proof of that so far.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s a cold-hearted bastard,” Theseus declares firmly.</p><p> </p><p>Newton hums, a small quirk of his lips. “That sounds like a challenge.”</p><p> </p><p>“Little brother,” Theseus warns, wrapping an arm around Newton’s neck in a playful chokehold. “Do behave yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>The smile widens into a grin. “I’ll try.”</p><p> </p><p>
