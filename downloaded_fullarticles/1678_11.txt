</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Hermione looked at the devastation around her. So many dead, so many families torn apart. Voldemort was destroyed, but they’d laid waste to their own world to do it. Harry was dead, the Weasleys were trying to deal with the loss Fred, and little Teddy Lupin was an orphan. She walked away from the carnage in the Great Hall and climbed the steps, finding herself standing in front of the rotating staircase that led up to the Headmaster’s office. It was open, as if waiting for her.</p><p> </p><p>She mounted the steps and entered the room, spotting an open door at the back of the office, a sliver of light beckoning to her. She pushed the door open carefully and saw the most curious thing. It looked like a slightly different time turner to the one she’d had back in 3<sup>rd</sup> year. There was a note with it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>If the end is to dark, best to alter the path. There will be no returning from this endeavor. 53 and a half turns should do the trick. Have on you what you require and be prepared for what lies ahead. Goodbye Miss Granger. Might I suggest engaging this in the corridor outside the library? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Just touching it, she could hear the Headmaster’s voice wrap around her and it brought tears to her eyes. She knew what she had to do. Her feet took her up to the Prefect’s bathroom, the door opening for her as if the castle sensed that she was on a mission. Once inside she set the bath to filling, and rummaged through her tattered beaded bag, pulling out her school trunk. She pulled out one of her uniforms and laid it out, slipping out of her muggle clothes. She sank into the water and scrubbed off the blood and dirt that layered her skin, thinking about everything. She had to prevent this from happening, but the time line would be altered, which meant she could never return. She’d have to live out her life in the new timeline and this world would cease to be. The thoughts were running through her head, but she just felt numb inside.</p><p> </p><p>Once she was clean, she dressed in her uniform needing to use a couple of alterations spells to take it in. She’d lost a fair bit of weight over the year on the run. She needed to find Riddle and either change his plans or kill him. She found her book bag and put a couple texts in, and tucked everything else into her beaded bag and stuffed it into the leather book bag. She looked in the mirror and shook her head. She looked like a school girl again, save for the haunted look in her eyes. She put the time turner around her neck and went down to the Library, standing in the hall way as she started counting her turns. At the end she hesitated…had she done 53? Or 54? No, she’d done 53 like she’d been told. She did one half turn more.</p><p> </p><p>As she released it, the world blurred around her in a dizzying parade of years, children changing but the rhythms unaltered. Time flowed around her like water, when suddenly it stopped. The dark hallway lay quiet around her and the time turner began to smoke. She took it off and frowned as it disintegrated in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s well after curfew.” A voice came from behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione turned, eyes widening at the tall, dark haired student standing behind her. “What….what happened? Who are you?” she said, deciding it was best to claim this had been an accident. The boy walking towards her was undeniably handsome, but he moved with a sense of contained malice.</p><p> </p><p>His eyes narrowed in the moonlight. “I don’t know you.” He cast a silent lumos and it was clear he was evaluating her. “Identify yourself.” A shining prefect’s badge glittered on his chest.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione Granger. I was heading to the library and something hit me from behind…” She looked around, as if trying to figure out what had happened. She was not prepared for the strange boy to hit her with a full body bind. She fell backwards, head smacking on the stone floor.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s figure out who you really are, shall we?” The dark haired boy smiled then, and levitated her up, moving through the hallways to an unused classroom.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was panicking, she’d never seen a picture of Tom Riddle but there was something about this boy that made her blood run ice cold. She watched and realized he was warding the room, setting silencing spells. He knelt beside her and plucked her wand from her pocket and slipped it into his. She fought against the spell but it was too strong. His hand smoothed a stray bit of hair off her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Pretty thing aren’t you, mudblood by the sound of your name.” He sneered and then pointed his wand at her and whispered, “Legillimens.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione felt him force his way into her mind. She’d never learned to occlude, there had always been other things to worry about. He ransacked her mind, delving deep into everything. He lingered here and there, seeming to savour certain memories. She fought him as best she could, but every time she struggled trying to push him out he’d punish her, twisting something in her mind that sent pain searing through her. She could hide nothing. She’d tried to come back and stop him, only to fall right into his hands. She felt something hot and wet streaming down her face, distantly she realized her nose was bleeding. Then suddenly the presence in her mind was gone and he released her from the body bind.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione rolled over, after just lying there dazed for a long time, getting to her knees unsteadily. A handkerchief was abruptly thrust into her hands. She pressed it to her nose to staunch the bleeding, unable to account for the small courtesy. Her head hurt so much that she felt queasy, the stone seeming to spin under her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d accuse you of manufacturing those memories, but you’ve no talent for it.” His voice came to her, cutting through the pounding in her head. “All my great works undone, by mere children,” he said quietly, feet sounding on the stones as he walked, pacing angrily.  </p><p> </p><p>Hermione finally managed to look up at him. “Not just undone, destroyed,” she said, chin lifting a bit in defiance. If she was going to die here tonight, she wouldn’t grovel.</p><p> </p><p>“From your memories it wasn’t just me that was destroyed,” he said and turned those black, pitiless eyes on her. “You’re a clever thing, so I assume you can understand your situation. No one knows you’re here, that you even exist. I could kill you right now and no one would ever be the wiser for it.” He stroked his fingers along his wand, as if trying to decide just how to end her life. “If I let you live, you’ll belong to me. You will do what I say, when I say and you will help me make sure that the future you’ve shown me tonight never comes to pass. It’s your decision mudblood, and I don’t particularly care which option you choose.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione removed the bloody handkerchief from her nose and considered. She didn’t want to die, but serving him, doing his dirty work…she didn’t know if she could. “I won’t help you kill muggles and muggleborns,” she said, tears stinging her eyes. She knew the second she began to bargain with him that he’d won.</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps that doesn’t need to be necessary, this time,” he said. “Your choice, Miss Granger? I don’t have all night.” He stroked his wand while he looked down at her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll agree to your terms,” she whispered, tears falling down her cheeks. The weight of the last 24 hours hitting her like a brick wall. She just couldn’t fight any more.</p><p> </p><p>“When we are alone, you will address me as ‘My Lord’,” he said darkly.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione felt bile rising in her throat. “Yes…my Lord.” She managed to choke the words out, shoulders slumping down. When he stepped forward and offered her a hand, she looked distrustful of it, but took it and stood shakily. “Thank you,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“Hold still,” he said and cast a gentle cleaning spell to remove the blood from her face and clothing. “Now, I’ll need to take you to the Headmaster. You will tell him there was an accident, you were walking to class and someone must have been practicing a dangerous charm. You were caught in the blast.” He grabbed her robe and deftly tore the sleeve. “Your name is Hermione Granger, but you are a half-blood. Your mother was a witch, pick a name so long as it’s a good family. You’re starting your sixth year.” He cast a fire spell, just enough to singe her robes and then extinguished it. “You are a Slytherin.” His transfigured the crest on her robes with an easy wave of his hand.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was feeling off balance but nodded. “Yes, my Lord,” she whispered, knowing somehow that failing to use his title would be a very bad thing. She was unable to help the instinctive flinch as he touched her face.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a good little witch.” He smiled charmingly. “Do what I tell you and I’ll make sure you’re protected. After all, what you’ve shown me will prevent me from making foolish errors. Such a gift should be treasured.” He continued to stroke her face, examining every inch of her. “If you breathe a word of any of this to Dumbledore or anyone else…it will take you a very long time to die. Tell me you understand.” His thumb was stroking along her bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p>“I understand, my Lord.” She met his eyes and felt another tear slide down her face. What had she done?</p><p> </p><p>He gently wiped it away. “Good. Now, let’s go and see Headmaster Dippet.” He slipped her wand back into her pocket, cancelled his wards and then wrapped an arm around her. “You’ll be all right, little witch,” he said soothingly and led her back out into the hall and guided her through the darkened school.</p><p> </p><p>“What is this, young Tom?” A voice stopped them as they approached the Headmaster’s office. A younger Horace Slughorn appeared, taking in the strange witch tucked under his Prefect’s arm.</p><p> </p><p>“I found her collapsed outside the Library, Sir. We need to take her directly to the Headmaster and summon Madame Tillsby, I think she may need healing,” Tom said, sounding very concerned.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll take the young lady up to see that Headmaster, you fetch Madam Tillsby. There’s a good lad. Come my dear, it’s all right.” Horace gently eased her out of Tom’s arms and guided her up to the headmaster’s office. “What’s your name child?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione Granger, Sir,” She said as she watched Tom run down the hall, ostensibly to get the school nurse. She was quiet as they rode the spiral staircase up to the Headmaster’s office and went directly inside.</p><p> </p><p>“We have a strange situation, Armando. Can you tell me how you came to be here tonight?” He asked, getting her inside and nodding to the Headmaster, who came out of the back room as he heard them enter.  </p><p> </p><p>“You poor thing, set her down here, Horace.” The old wizard came forward and helped guide the shaky young witch to a chair. He looked frail but there was a fierce intelligence in his brown eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I was heading to the Library to study and there was this explosion…the next thing I knew I was lying on the floor and that boy, Tom he said his name was, was leaning over me, asking me if I was all right.” She touched her head, it was still throbbing. “I know you, Professor Slughorn…but I don’t recognize anyone else. What year is this?” she asked, looking very frightened.</p><p> </p><p>“What year do you think it is?” Horace asked.</p><p> </p><p>“1996,” she said, keeping to the lie that Tom had insisted upon. “I was just starting my sixth year.” She swallowed, looking at the Professors as they exchanged looks.</p><p> </p><p>“My dear, I’m afraid it’s October 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1943.” The Headmaster said very gently. “If this was the result of some bizarre magical accident, it’s unlikely that we will be able to return you to your own time.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione closed her eyes, just letting all the emotion of the last 24 hours hit her, tears coming without much trouble. “But my parents, my friends…” she whispered, her words catching in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“I am very sorry my dear.” He patted her hands. “We will, of course, do everything we can to help you. Ah, here is our nurse, Madam Tillsby,” he said as the kindly matron swept in.</p><p> </p><p>“Give the poor girl some space,” the woman said, her manner reminding Hermione very much of Madam Pomfrey. She shooed the Headmaster and Potions Professor back from her chair. “Now let me have a look at you dear.” She checked her for injuries and clucked her tongue here and there, while Headmaster Dippet spoke in hushed tones with Professor Slughorn. “Well, it seems you have some not so mild magical exhaustion, which makes me think that your magic is responsible for all of this. Likely protected you by flinging you back into the past.” She surmised.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s eyes flicked to Tom, who was standing there quietly against the far wall. “I suppose that makes sense. I do have a terrible headache,” she said shiver at the grin that crossed his lips, hidden from all but her.</p><p> </p><p>“Here…” She opened her emergency kit and handed her a slender bottle. “Drink this, it should help. More than anything I think she needs some rest, Headmaster. I’d like to take her to the infirmary so I can keep an eye on her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Perhaps she’d be more comfortable down in the dorms, Headmaster. She’s had quite the ordeal, familiar surroundings may be more what she needs,” Tom interjected smoothly.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, familiar surroundings are just the thing, good thinking my boy. Why don’t you escort Miss Granger to the dorms, I’m sure the Castle can add a bed to the girl’s dorm for her,” Horace said.</p><p> </p><p>“If it hasn’t already, Hogwarts always knows what its students need,” Dippet said sagely. “After breakfast tomorrow if you’d be so kind as to escort her back here Tom, and we’ll get her class schedule sorted out, and get her properly added to the register,” he said to Tom.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course Headmaster. Miss Granger?” he said charmingly and took her book bag for her, looking for all the world like a solicitous young wizard.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, Mr. Riddle,” she said and stood, going with Tom, heart pounding a little as they descended down towards the dungeons. As they turned down a corridor, Tom took her arm in a tight grip and spun her, her back impacting the wall with a dull thud. She sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p> </p><p>“A touching performance,” he said. “Now, since you were a Gryffindor this is going to be hard for you. You’re in Slytherin House now, you will need to be quiet and observant. You’ll defer to me, and I’ll make certain the others treat you with respect. You do not want to stand out here, any more than you already do.”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded. “I was only in Gryffindor because I told the hat to put me there,” she said, rubbing her arm where he’d grabbed her. “It actually debated for a while between Ravenclaw and Slytherin.”</p><p> </p><p>He snorted. “A mudblood in Slytherin…how ridiculous.” He sneered.</p><p> </p><p>Her jaw tightened and she had to bite her tongue to keep from tearing into him. “Shall we continue?” she said primly.</p><p> </p><p>“After you.” He gave a mocking bow and they continued down the dark corridors. He stopped in front of a stone wall and whispered, “Alihotsy.” He said and the stone melted away to reveal the entrance.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione entered, carefully hiding her interest as she flicked her eyes around the room. The light from the lamps gave a green cast to everything and there was a fire crackling merrily away in the hearth. She saw a few students scattered around the room on leather couches, a pair of older boys were playing a game of wizard’s chess. As they entered, everyone’s eyes turned to fix on her. She schooled her features, aware they were sizing her up.</p><p> </p><p>“Who’s this then, Tom?” A lanky boy stood and strode over. He was of a height with Tom, inky black hair brushing high cheek bones.</p><p> </p><p>“Hadrian Nott, may I present the newest member of Slytherin House, Miss Hermione Granger.” Tom made the introduction smoothly.</p><p> </p><p>“Granger?” The boy raised an eyebrow, giving her an appraising look. His tone telling her that he knew she was no pure-blood.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m a Half-blood,” she said, meeting his eyes boldly, daring him to say anything.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s the victim of a rather spectacular magical accident,” Tom said, getting in the middle of their conversation before it devolved. “She is a member of our house, but from the year 1996,” he explained, and watched as their eyes widened, taking her in with new appreciation.</p><p> </p><p>“Who were your year-mates in Slytherin?” Hadrian asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Pansy Parkinson, Daphne Greengrass, Millicent Bulstrode, Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle,” she said smoothly, leaving out Tracey the half-blood. She was already putting the future into the blender, might as well go for broke.</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian nodded politely. “Won’t you sit down, Miss Granger?” He offered her his hand, cool hazel eyes on hers.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione politely took his hand and let him lead her over to sit in one of the chairs. “Thank you. I apologize if I come across a little blunt, it’s been a long night.”</p><p> </p><p>“I imagine. Would you care for some tea? I’m sure we can convince the elves to bring us something,” Hadrian asked, sitting across from her.</p><p> </p><p>“That would actually be lovely,” she said, relaxing into the chair and trying hard not to feel like a mouse that had been dropped into a viper’s nest. It was eerie how much this boy looked like Theodore. He was just a little more handsome, his features not as pinched. His lips were fuller and seemed to exist in a state of perpetual smirking. The very bold eye contact was different too. Theo had always been rather reluctant to engage with much direct conversation.  </p><p> </p><p>Tom sat down on the couch, sprawled elegantly. “Let me make some introductions.  These are two of your new dorm mates, Constance Fawley and Adelaide Yaxley.” He nodded to two pretty blonde girls who had come over. “Ladies, this is Hermione Granger. I trust you will make certain she feels welcome.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course Tom.” Constance smiled at him. “We’d be happy to.” She and her friend settled down on the couch, but gave Tom some space.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve met Hadrian, over there is James Rosier and Marcus Avery…you’ll find them playing chess most nights.” The two in question were frowning over the game. “And over in the corner there is Renaud Lestrange.” He nodded to a boy sitting in the far corner at a table, books and notes scattered around him. “Don’t ever get between him and his research, he’ll hex first and ask questions when he’s done reading,” he warned.</p><p> </p><p>“I consider myself duly warned,” she said and smiled as tea and a few plates of biscuits appeared on the low table.</p><p> </p><p>“How do you prefer your tea, Miss Granger?” Hadrian asked the girl.</p><p> </p><p>“Just a little honey and milk.” She watched as he made the cup up for her and handed it over. “Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>“So, I’ll just get this out of the way so that no one feels the need to be rude about it. Who are your parents?” Riddle asked her.</p><p> </p><p>“My father is Thomas Granger, he’s a muggleborn and is a potions researcher. My mother is Amelia Urquart. They were both in Ravenclaw, and married after graduation,” she said politely. She knew there had been an Amelia Urquart, she’d seen the name once while researching something from the Marauder’s school days.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you end up in Slytherin then?” The other girl, Adelaide asked.</p><p> </p><p>“My love of knowledge was less for knowledge sake and more for what it could get me.” She shrugged. “The hat dithered and decided Slytherin would benefit my ambitions.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wonder how you being here will affect the timeline,” Tom mused aloud. “Just meeting all of us could drastically alter future events.”</p><p> </p><p>“I imagine it will,” Hermione said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>“It must be frightening, to suddenly find yourself alone without your friends or family,” Hadrian said sympathetically, but there was an undercurrent to his words.  </p><p> </p><p>“Daunting might be a better word. I don’t scare easily,” she said, avoiding Tom’s piercing gaze. “But yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Where’s Harriet?” Tom asked Constance.</p><p> </p><p>“Still patrolling, she should be back soon. She mentioned something about ruining some ‘Puff’s night.” She grinned.</p><p> </p><p>He nodded. “We’ll introduce you to everyone else in the morning, and I imagine the Headmaster will make a short announcement.”</p><p> </p><p>“What Newts were you taking?” Adelaide asked politely.</p><p> </p><p>“Charms, Defence, Transfigurations, History of Magic, Potions, Herbology, Astronomy, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Care of Magical Creatures,” she said, listing them all off. She’d dropped Divination and Muggle Studies after third year, deciding they weren’t worth her time. </p><p> </p><p>Tom’s eyebrows lifted. “That’s even one more than Renaud.” He looked strangely interested. “What were your Owl Scores?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nine O’s and one E in Defence. It’s never been my best subject and we’d had a horrid string of teachers.” She made a face. Her DADA OWL score had always bothered her.</p><p> </p><p>“If you want to ace your Defence Newt next year you should join the study group,” Hadrian said and subtly looked to Tom.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll see if she fits there,” Tom said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Hadrian nodded, letting it be.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione watched the byplay and just helped herself to one of the biscuits. As she finished her tea, Constance stood.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s head up to the dorm and get you settled,” she said to the other girl.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, sounds good.” She picked up her book bag. “Goodnight,” she said to the boys, who nodded politely.</p><p> </p><p>“Sleep well,” Tom said, holding her eyes for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione swallowed nervously before falling into step with Constance. The other girl walked ahead and they entered the 6<sup>th</sup> year girl’s dorm. There was, as the Headmaster had predicted a bed waiting for her. She set her book back down and took off her robes, setting them aside and looking with a frown at the tear in the sleeve.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re about my size,” Constance said and went to her trunk taking out a folded pair of soft cream pajamas. “You can borrow these.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you, you’re a lifesaver,” she said sat them on the edge of her bed, realizing that to convince everyone that this had been an accident she’d need to buy all new things, and how would she even do that?</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to help you purchase some new things,” Constance said, able to see the other girl’s worries.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not just that, it’s all my books and notes, all my things…it’s all gone,” she whispered quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Constance went over and took her hand. “It’ll be ok…you’re a smart girl, you’ll land on your feet.” She squeezed her hand reassuringly. “Besides, you’re very pretty and some rich wizard is going to snap you up quick.” She winked at her.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione blushed darkly.</p><p> </p><p>“Just be careful around Hadrian, he’ll take advantage if he thinks he can,” she warned. “A well placed stinging hex is usually enough to warn him off if he gets a little pushy. But we do assign bonus points for inventive hexes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind.” She was put in mind of Cormac. “I’m just going to get cleaned up and changed,” she said and headed into the bathroom that the four girls would share. Her initial reaction was that it was MUCH nicer than the bathrooms in Gryffindor tower. There was a dressing table with a padded bench and a pretty privacy screen. There were two shower stalls and a toilette closet off to one side. She washed off her face, finding a little blood that Tom’s spell had missed and she went behind the privacy screen to change. She frowned as the neckline of the pajamas dipped a bit low over her cleavage, showing the top of her scar that Dolohov had given her. A quick glamour hid her ‘mudblood’ scar, it was small enough that no one should notice. The Dolohov scar however….that was too big to conceal regularly. Someone would notice the glamour.</p><p> </p><p>She came out and unclipped her hair, letting it fall around her shoulders. She turned around, jumping a bit as she realized Constance was sitting at the vanity, watching her. “What’s that scar from?”</p><p> </p><p>“Dark curse. I got into a duel with someone beyond my level and they weren’t exactly playing fair,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Constance’s eyebrows lifted. “I’m assuming you don’t glamour it because it’s large?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione nodded and traced her finger from the tip of the scar that she could see, down her body to where it rested against her hip. “It was a pretty nasty recovery actually. I’m lucky I survived it.”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded. “You’ll have to tell me the story sometime, when you’re not reeling from getting hurled back in time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Connie!” A voice called from the main room.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re back here Hattie!” Constance said.</p><p> </p><p>“So they weren’t pulling my leg.” A shorter, heavier set girl came in. She had a slightly round face with a pleasant smile and red curls framing it. “Sorry I wasn’t here to greet you properly, I’m Harriet Rosier…but please call me Hattie.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nice to meet you Hattie, I’m Hermione Granger. My friends call me ‘Mione.” Hermione managed a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Well if you need anything at all, please let us know,” she said. “I imagine that right now what you really need is some sleep.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I’m pretty exhausted actually,” she admitted.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll size one of my spare uniforms for you until you can get your own,” Constance said as the girls headed back into the dorm.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione fell into her bed, utterly exhausted. She pulled her curtains closed and cast a quick privacy spell and laid back. She looked at the wand in her hand and scowled. It was Bellatrix’s. It still fought her, but with its Mistress now dead it seemed to be accepting that it was hers. Her new Dorm mates seemed very nice, but Tom terrified her. There was nothing at home in his eyes…a true deep darkness.</p><p> </p>
