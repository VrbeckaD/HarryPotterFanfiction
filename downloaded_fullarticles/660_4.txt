    <p>A/N my new idea. I hope you like this. </p><p>Inspired by The Beguile and Devotion of a Black Heir by StarLight Massacre. </p><p>Warnings: check profile. </p><p>Corbin's POV </p><p>He was sitting in his office going through papers. As Lord of the Yaxley family he was always going through papers it seemed. There was little else for him to do as of yet. </p><p>It had been a few weeks since his Lord's return and so far he had only been called once. While he still went to the parties hosted by other families he didn't see much action any longer. Corbin knew the reason behind it. </p><p>His younger brother Zachariah Yaxley had perished in the last war. As had his family. This left Corban as the last remaining member of the Yaxley family. </p><p>With his own wife Anna's death during childbirth, he could not bring himself to marry another. Their relationship had started out as an arranged one but they had grown to love each other. The child had died with her leaving him even more heartbroken. </p><p>At this point, the only other way for his line to survive was if he adopted a child. With Dumbledore in power that wasn't likely to happen any time soon. The darker families had trouble adopting legally without paying a fortune through the goblins. </p><p>Corbin was a single Lord with no remaining family. In times past that would have put him at the top of the list. The Ministry during that time cared if a line was about to extinct. Then Grindelwald happened. </p><p>His attention was drawn when his wards pinged. Someone was fire calling him. He moved towards the floo of his study.</p><p>A familiar head of Tarloc entered his fire. He greeted, "Grandmaster Tarloc, what do I owe the pleasure?"</p><p>The man inquired, "Can you come through? It's not something one would want to say through the floo."</p><p>Now he was intrigued. He asked, "Are you at the guild?"</p><p>"No, call out Huntik Foundation, London. I have permission to allow you through."</p><p>Oh, that couldn't be good. The Foundation wasnt in very good standing with the Wizarding World. Seekers and wizards had been fighting for decades. He hoped that wasn't what happened this time. For once he hoped his life would be easy. </p><p>When he stepped through the floor he found Lucius Malfoy and Tarloc waiting. Tarloc was in his mid-fifties now. Nearly twenty years older than Corbin himself. </p><p>Hanging from his belt was a ward stone with a master level inscription. It was the symbol of the ward masters. Each had one even if it was normally hidden by their robes. </p><p>The room they were in was tan in color. It had a non-moving picture of twelve men in a circle. A dirty blond-haired man entered drawing their attention.</p><p>The man said, "Sorry for the wait, Tarloc. Alec isn't in the greatest of health and the boy wanted to see him. I assume these are the people who you want to be considered."</p><p>Tarloc answered calmly, "Yes. This is Lord Corbin Yaxley and Lord Lucius Malfoy. Lords this is Jason Guggenheim."</p><p>Both men greeted, "Nice to meet you."</p><p>Guggenheim motioned for them to follow. They went out of the room and down several hallways. Anytime they passed people the people would almost hug the walls to give them space. </p><p>They were led to a door where Guggenheim knocked. Then they entered without waiting for an answer. </p><p>On one bed was a black-haired boy with killing curse green eyes. Corbin spied a scar on the boy's forehead. It didn't take him long to realize that it was Harry Potter the Boy Who Lived. </p><p>At first, there was no reaction as the eyes landed on him. Then they fell on Lucius. Hatred like Corbin had never seen entered the green eyes. There seemed to be a history between these two. </p><p>There were several bruises all over the boy's face. His right arm was in a sling. Despite all of this the boy's glare was fierce. Corbin felt respect for the boy to grow. </p><p>The boy asked ignoring courtesy, "Master Tarloc what are they doing here?"</p><p>Master? Not Grandmaster? Then it hit him. Of course not Grandmaster. That was too formal between master and apprentice. </p><p>Tarloc replied, "This is Lord Corbin Yaxley and Lord Lucius Malfoy. With everything that happened at your aunt and uncle's house this morning, it's no longer safe for you there."</p><p>There was a brief flash of anger in the boy's eyes. A history there. An unkind one perhaps?</p><p>A coldness seeped into Guggenheim's blue eyes as he asked, "Did they do this to you, Harrison? Why didn't you say anything? To me? To Dante?"</p><p>Corbin knew why without even knowing the boy. An abused child rarely if ever will speak of what happens. Even to those they trust. </p><p>The boy snapped back, "Even if I told you, you would have sent me back. There wasnt a Foundation member to look after me. Not after Metz grew ill."</p><p>Guggenheim flinched but continued on, "We would have found someone. The Foundation despises abuse you know this."</p><p>"It wasn't abused," sighed the boy, "I only have to deal with them until my birthday. Then I can go to the Weasley's."</p><p>The clenching in the men's hands were the only thing that betrayed their anger. No child should have that view on life. </p><p>Corbin didn't hate the child in front of him. He never had even when the boy defeated the Dark Lord. In the Lord's eyes, everything came to an end eventually. It was only a matter of when. </p><p>Tarloc sighed, "Harrison you will not be returning to them ever. That is why I have called Lord Yaxley and Malfoy here. They both have ties to Wizardry Protection Movement. As you revealed to me in your letters you have no idea of your inheritance."</p><p>Corbin questioned finally speaking up, "You don't know about your Lordship?"</p><p>The boy shook his head ebony locks falling into his face. Corbin turned to Tarloc who said, "I only found out a few weeks ago myself. I was preparing to find someone to mentor him when I got the call."</p><p>"You didn't have to come," grumbled the child, "Dante and Guggenheim have known me for years."</p><p>Tarloc retorted, "Of course I would come. You're my apprentice, Harrison."</p><p>Harrison growled, "I don't trust Malfoy."</p><p>That Corbin could understand. The Malfoy's were a slippery bunch. If you won a place in their hearts though they would look after you forever. </p><p>There was a wariness in his eyes when he looked at Corbin. However there wasnt the sheer hatred that was there before. </p><p>Corbin said drawing the child's attention, "Would you give me a chance? I don't have a wife or children myself. Though I'll teach you anything you need and want to know."</p><p>Harrison asked Tarloc, "Do you trust him?"</p><p>"I do. Corbin will teach you and will treat you well."</p><p>Green eyes turned back to meet his cobalt blue. The mistrust was clear in them as he said, "If you trust him I'll give him a chance, Master Tarloc."</p><p>Harrison's POV </p><p>His body ached from the beating that Vernon had given him. The fat bastard thought that he stole money. The only money he had was what he earned through jobs with the Foundation. </p><p>Not only had Vernon taken all his money but he had beaten Harrison. At first, it was just a punch to his face. Then it was kicked to his sides. When Harrison tried to block the attacks his arm had broken. </p><p>Harrison couldn't use his seeker magic to protect himself. It was against the seeker code except in times of distress. While this would have counted his center had been destroyed in his fight with Voldemort. Powers were extremely difficult for him to use. Summoning titans was almost impossible. </p><p>Eyeing Tarloc he thought back to the beginning summer of last year. Tarloc had found him just outside of Surrey. Once again Harrison was considering running away. </p><p>Tarloc told him that he was a Ward Master. Having heard of them through the books that he read away from Ron and Hermione. </p><p>Only Neville in the Gryffindor house knew that he liked reading. The timid boy helped Harrison hide it in the previous years. In return, Harrison taught him basic magic. </p><p>It was Harrison who figured out that Neville was having difficulty with magic because of his wand. When Harrison first got his wand he was told the wand chose the wizard. Not the other way around. Neville never went to Olivander's shop because his grandmother wanted him to use his father's wand. </p><p>Tarloc had convinced him not to run away. Instead of giving him something to do while still within the wards. So many books were given to him. They held runes that allowed Harrison to shrink and grow them without having his trace go off. </p><p>Harrison signed a contract that had him be an apprentice for no less than three years but no more than seven. He was already a silver level apprentice. There was only a gold level before he could take his mastery exams. </p><p>During the tournament, he had spent a lot of time away from the Tower. With only Neville believing that he didn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire, Harrison trained hard alone. At least alone at first. </p><p>Moody had came to his two weeks into the year and gave him a safe place to study and train. Despite being fake Moody the man taught him a lot. </p><p>There was a journal under his bed back at the house. It held all of his potions and their adjustments. Spells and their combinations how they flow together. Stances that fake Moody had given him. </p><p>When it was revealed that Moody was actually Barty Crouch Jr. he was hurt. During the tournament, there were only three people he trusted completely. Moody, Neville, and Tarloc. Finding out one was lying to him the entire time caused him to grow cold in his heart. </p><p>Dante had saved him from the worst of the beating. It would have only gotten worse as he continued. Upon seeing Harrison lying on the floor he immediately took him back to the safe house. Then they flooed to the Headquarters in London. </p><p>Tarloc had been named his emergency contact. So as soon as Harrison was brought in Guggenheim made contact with the Ward Master guild. </p><p>The Yaxley Lord questioned as the doctor came in, "How bad are his injuries?"</p><p>The doctor looked to Harrison who nodded before he began, "His right arm is broken in three places. No doubt by the whale. There are also three broken ribs and two cracked ones. You will have to take it easy for a couple of months. That means no missions, Potter." </p><p>A faint smile twitched at his lips. He was too much like Metz and Dante. The likelihood of him actually listening to the orders wasn't very high and the doctor knew it. </p><p>Guggenheim said, "He's a seeker. The likelihood of him listening to orders is about as high as Dante."</p><p>The doctor rolled his eyes but nodded his assent as he replied, "He's clear to leave. Mr. Yawxley his arm stays in the sling until it heals. Putting a cast on it is useless at this point. Just don't let him use it. If he goes on a mission though it's on your heads."</p><p>Harrison was already moving to the side of the bed so that he could stand. Tarloc helped him carefully to his feet mindful of his injuries. </p><p>Malfoy had begun writing a piece of parchment the books that he would need. He didn't give the list to Harrison but to Yaxley. The boy didn't trust either man but he trusted Tarloc. His master would not lead him astray. To do so would break the contract between them. </p><p>Yaxley said as they moved towards the floo, "We will go first to Gringotts. There we will get your Lordship rings. You won't be fully emancipated until your sixteen but this will get your seats out from under Dumbledore's control. They will file the paperwork to have your guardianship transferred to me."</p><p>Harrison said a thought coming into his head, "I want an oath before I go anywhere with you. Swear that you will never willingly cause me harm."</p><p>All three men started in surprise at his demand. Yaxley's cobalt blue eyes searched his killing curse green for a moment. </p><p>Then nodded and drew his wand swearing, "I, Corbin Antilles Yaxley, swear upon my magic that I will never willingly cause harm to Harrison James Potter. That I will protect him to the best of my ability. So I say it. So mote it be," a white light surrounded both of them before fading. </p><p>It was a binding oath that would stay with both of them until one died. This caused Harrison to have slightly more faith in the man. Though not much.</p>
