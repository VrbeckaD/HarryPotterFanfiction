From his place in professional league quidditch, to his position at the Ministry. Well this was one thing Draco managed to acquire all on his own. It may have taken a potion, and years of apprenticing to Snape, but he could honestly say that he brewed the drought that got Harry into his bed whenever he wanted him there. He transmuted it into an emerald and told Harry that it matched his eyes. Soft-hearted to a fault, the other had been rendered speechless as Draco held his hand and slipped the ring on his finger.</p><p>“We’ll start slow. No one has to know.”</p><p>The only thing he regretted, was that Harry had no idea how far their relationship had escalated, or the things he did for Draco in bed. But in a way, that was perfect too, for Draco didn’t want to part with his virgin bachelor by day, and his private whore by night. Harry was his plaything, maybe even his best, beloved thing, and his father’s money had nothing to do with it. Draco’s ambition had managed that all on its own.</p><p> </p><p>End</p>
