</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Balthasar was only nine years old the first time he died.</p><p> </p><p>But we wouldn’t need to rush, would we?</p><p> </p><p>The tale starts when he was born.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The weather was sunny on that day. It was a sky filled with orange and blue, yet red and rose. A weird sky, that was, but beautiful to its core.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe that was why things got wrong.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Arisha and Balthasar Kano were born on the same day. They were twins, after all. They looked unearthly, their mother always told. They looked like angels, their father always told. With their golden crowns, and their golden eyes. It was unlike anything people may have seen before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>People all around the world came to see the new borns. From France, from Germany, from Africa. They were mesmerized and fell into a trance because of their beauty and grace.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe that was why things got wrong.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Arisha was a cheerful delight, the servants told. She was everything good in this world, as I heard.</p><p> </p><p>She loved to play with her dolls, and her parents always bought the most expensive one. They made sure to follow the trend, made sure Arisha had everything they needed. She had many friends from other Pureblood families, and she was never mean to anyone. She took it after her father, I was told.</p><p> </p><p>She was a quiet child but she loved her brother more than anything. They played all day, every day and had fun. They spent a lot of time with each other and made sure the other one was never alone.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe that was why things got wrong.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>––––––––––––––––</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Balthasar was a calm storm, the servants told. He was everything that a child was not, as I heard.</p><p> </p><p>He loved to read, he had the best tutor in all of the world. His parents made sure he got the best education anyone could ever have. He never raised his voice, but people knew when he was angry. He took it after his mother, I was told.</p><p> </p><p>He loved his sister more than anything. They played all day, every day and had fun. They spent a lot of time with each other and made sure the other one was never alone.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe that was why things got wrong.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>The first sign of Balthasar’s peculiarity happened on a Tuesday afternoon, but I’m not sure in that myself anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>On that day, Arisha found a dead bird in the garden which was blessed by red, gold and silver roses. It looked like a place straight out of a fairy tale.</p><p> </p><p>Arisha was looking at the dead, bleeding Woodpecker and with tears coming out of her eyes, she said, “I hope he didn’t feel much pain.”</p><p> </p><p>Balthasar sent his sister a comforting smile and gently patted her shoulders. “It’s okay, ‘Risha,” he whispered. “He can’t feel anything anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>But his voice had no warmth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And his sister froze and stayed</p><p> </p><p>silent.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe that was why things got wrong.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>––––––––––––––––––––––</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>I heard that story many many times, but it still makes the hair on my arms go nuts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Why, you ask?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After midnight I had to clean the little boy’s room, one of the servants told me.</p><p> </p><p>I had to do my job, I expected nothing, one of the servants told me.</p><p> </p><p>I saw him pull off his gloves, one of the servants told me.</p><p> </p><p>And then washed the blood</p><p> </p><p>off</p><p> </p><p>his hands.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>–––––––––––––––––––––</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>If Arisha would have told Balthasar that he felt different, our story had turned out to be entirely different.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>But she stayed silent.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>–––––––––––––––––––</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>When ninth Winter of Balthasar’s year came around – he started to notice things, as children do around that time period of their life, I might add.</p><p> </p><p>Balthasar on one beautiful sunny Friday, decided to go hunt in the woods. He brought his dog with himself and used his eyes, as I’ve been told.</p><p> </p><p>But Balthasar didn’t search for rabbits, deers or birds.</p><p> </p><p>No, my dear child.</p><p> </p><p>Balthasar was hunting for wolves.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>––––––––––––––––––</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>He always caught one throughout a week, one of the servants told me.</p><p> </p><p>He asked us to skin them and give him their fur, the head butler told me.</p><p> </p><p>Why, I dared to ask.</p><p> </p><p>The answer to this day, still haunts me.</p><p> </p><p>Because he wanted to feel something.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>––––––––––––––––––</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>A beautiful child, people sang.</p><p> </p><p>Clever, magnificent, they sang.</p><p> </p><p>He has a bright future ahead, they sang.</p><p> </p><p>The mother and the father smiled, even Arisha who knew something was out of place yet never did anything or spoke up about it.</p><p> </p><p>But the servants were terrified.</p><p> </p><p>I asked why.</p><p> </p><p>They looked at me, dead in the eye and whispered with shaking lips:</p><p> </p><p>Because you have no idea what we see during night.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>––––––––––––––––––</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>When Balthasar finally turned nine, on the first day of December, he committed suicide.</p><p> </p><p>Don’t be surprised, My dear child.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>You know the legend of The Golden King – you knew he would die.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>There’s another side of this tale, which may not be so known for people other than myself. But tonight, tonight I will tell the old tale.</p><p> </p><p>It starts with the King who met Death.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>––––––––––––––––––––</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>When Balthasar met Death, I heard he knelt before him.</p><p> </p><p>Death was no surprised because he knew the kind of beast he was staring at.</p><p> </p><p>He had respect for Balthasar, I was told.</p><p> </p><p>Because Death has never met someone, who knew whom they were about to meet, after their death.</p><p> </p><p>But then I heard Balthasar only said, “Is there a reason for my existence?”</p><p> </p><p>And Death only bowed and said,“Why... do you have a wish?”</p><p> </p><p>“I want others be able to feel safe and powerful,” the kid said.</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Death asked with hesitance.</p><p> </p><p>And Balthasar said, with eyes full of gold,</p><p> </p><p>“Because I know what it feels like when you have nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>Death give him a power, I was told.</p><p>
