  <b>November 2, 1981: Waxing Crescent</b>
</p><p>Hoots and hollers bounced around the buildings on the small wizarding street as witches and wizards gathered in the street in celebration, not even bothering to conceal any of the magic from prying Muggle eyes. Colourful sparks lit up the rooftops and shouts of “Long Live Harry Potter!” rang through the air. All the world seemed to be in a tizzy; He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had been defeated two nights previous, and it seemed as though the entire wizarding community had joined together to commemorate the occasion and wasn’t planning on stopping any time soon.</p><p>Well, almost the whole community: Severus Snape laid in his bed, looking up at the ceiling and wondering where it had all gone wrong. It came down to his failure at every turn: he failed to see the Dark Lord for what he really was until it was too late; he failed in redeeming himself to Dumbledore; and he failed to keep the woman he loved alive. He stayed in bed for days, not willing to face a world without Lily Evans in it.</p><p>Severus sat up and shook the thoughts from his mind. Opening the doors to the small balcony off his bedroom, he stepped out into the chilly night air. The night sky, inky black tonight, was peppered with pinprick stars, and a crescent moon peeked through a lone cloud. </p><p>A faint scent of chamomile and vanilla wafted from another balcony. Severus inhaled deeply, letting the fragrance pull memories of when he and Lily Evans were children: Lily inviting Severus to her house for tea one day, the first time Severus had been allowed to visit her home; Lily and Severus sitting on a bench, eating vanilla ice lollies her mother had purchased for them; Lily excitedly telling Severus that she would be joining him at Hogwarts; and Lily turning away from him as the word “mudblood” fell from his lips after his altercation with James Potter.</p><p>The faint scent somehow became overpowering to him. Walking back inside, he pinched the bridge of his long nose in frustration. So many years he’d wasted, dreaming about what could have been. He thought of the million different ways things could have been different, and he knew that he should have let Lily know about his feelings for her instead of letting his fucking pride get in the way.</p><p>Severus looked back at the crescent moon, a sliver of light in the black night, much like Lily had been for him. He’d been holed up for two days in his bedroom, and the air was stale. He suddenly felt as though the walls were closing in on him. He needed to get out.</p><p>The rickety old stairs creaked as he rushed down them, frantic to get back outside. The door to the building he lived in flew open when he swished his wand, and the cool night air filled his lungs. Candles flickered in the street lamps, softly illuminating the cobblestone pathway under his feet. Stragglers and people still making merry lingered in the street, raucously singing about Voldemort’s defeat, another niggling reminder to Severus of what he had lost. He stalked down the street, letting his feet carry him wherever they felt like, the sneer on his face frozen.</p><p>A group of young witches and wizards staggered near him, passing a bottle of firewhisky between them. A copper-haired witch eyed him and broke off from the pack. She lingered as her companions went along without her, inching closer to Severus. “Are you okay?” she asked gingerly, not an ounce of inebriation in her voice. Severus kept walking, head down, but the witch carried on. “It’s all right, you can talk to me,” she called after him.</p><p>Severus stopped and turned to face the gnat following him. He quickly studied her face: the witch’s pale skin seemed to glow under the light of the street lamps; she bit at her lower lip, full and glistening; and impossibly green eyes, shining and searching…</p><p>‘Gods, she’s everywhere I fucking turn,’ Severus screamed in his head. He could see Lily in this stranger’s eyes, almost as if she were trapped in there. He clutched at his lank black hair in frustration.  “I don’t want to talk to people I don’t know,” he growled at the witch. Turning away, he started back up the street, only to hear her footsteps following him.</p><p>“Everyone has been celebrating the war ending for the past couple of days, yet you don’t seem to be sharing in the festivities, and it looks like you could use a friend.”</p><p>Severus hesitated for a split second. She left her friends to talk to him, so she did seem to care, if only the tiniest bit; but it was true that he didn’t want to talk to anyone, let alone someone who reminded him so much of Lily.</p><p>Looking ahead, Severus saw a sign for an inn hanging on the side of one of the older buildings on the street. He darted inside, hoping to lose the witch, but to no avail. She followed him like a shadow. Without saying a word to anyone, he barged up the stairs and found a room that didn’t seem to be occupied. He entered the room and flung the door closed, not bothering to lock it.</p><p>
  <span>The tap-tap-tapping of footsteps outside his door indicated that the witch was pacing, and just as Severus raised his wand to cast a </span>

  <span> charm, she opened the door, gently knocking on it as she did so.</span>
</p><p>“What’s the point in knocking if you’re just going to barge in here uninvited?” Severus snapped at her.</p><p>The witch gave a small smile and cocked her head to the side. “Like I said, it looked like you needed someone to talk to, or someone to just be with. Either way, it looked like you shouldn’t be alone.” She took off her heavy over-robe and tossed it onto the chair.</p><p>“This isn’t my room, and I think we’d both better leave before the rightful guest comes back,” Severus said coldly, not knowing if the room was in fact occupied at all but desperate to get out of this situation.</p><p>
  <span>She looked around, as if searching for someone. “I don’t see anyone here. Do you?” She took her wand out and flicked it toward the door. Severus heard the </span>

  <span> of the door locking.</span>
</p><p>He carded his hands through his hair. “What does it take for you to leave?” he growled, advancing and pinning her to the door with his fierce glare.</p><p>She made to kiss him, but he turned his face away before their lips could meet. He backed away and let out another frustrated growl but all this did was draw the witch closer to him. She caressed his face and cupped his cheek in her hand. “It’s okay, love, whatever you’re feeling, let it out.” Her hand was gentle and, despite her actions to this point, her tone was undemanding. Giving in to her, he placed his hand on top of hers and leaned into her touch. She leant in to kiss him again, but he stepped back. “Why are you doing this? You don’t even know me.”</p><p>“You-Know-Who is gone. You should be celebrating, and I figured I could help you,” the witch said, softly running her hand along his jawline. “I can help you.”</p><p>
  <span>Severus searched her face, looking for a sign that she was having him on. He tried to read her thoughts but saw nothing. Bunching up the left sleeve of his robe, he revealed to her the Dark Mark, now dormant on his pale skin. “And what of this?” he demanded. “You would </span>

  </em>
  <span>a bigot and a traitor?”</span>
</p><p>The witch just looked at him, her eyes seeming to penetrate him just as fiercely as he tried with her. Severus threw up his defences, afraid that she was a Legilimens as well. “Doesn’t matter. I can tell you’ve given that up.” She looked at his arm, running her fingers along the black snake, a constant reminder of his betrayal. “I can help you forget.” She took his hand and raised it to her mouth, kissing his palm. His cock gave an involuntary twitch when she brought her eyes up to look at him, burning into his own. “Let me help you.”</p><p>Severus sighed heavily, and as he did, the witch pulled him in hard and finally kissed him. He watched her as they kissed; her eyes fluttered slightly and she gave a small smile against his lips, seemingly happy in her triumph. He broke from her, and she pulled down the shoulders of her robes. Severus lifted a hand, motioning for her to stop. “Are you sure you want to do this?” he asked, his voice gravelly with simultaneous desire and despair.</p><p>“Yes,” she said with a breathy voice, slipping her robes off completely, revealing square shoulders and small breasts, and to Severus’ surprise, a lack of pants.</p><p>“Get on the bed then.”</p><p>The witch complied eagerly, flinging her robes to the side and climbing up onto the mattress. She scooted up toward the headboard and watched him as he removed his pants and gave his cock a few rough strokes. Surprisingly, he hardened quickly as he watched the witch start to massage her mound, then dip her finger inside her labia and touch her clitoris lightly. Severus wasted no time as he descended on the witch, casting a silent lubrication charm on his dick and sliding it into her. The witch let out a groan as he pushed in deep, touching his face as he thrusted into her.</p><p>“Remember, it’s me taking care of you,” she said as she sat up slightly. She pulled on him, signaling to him that she should be on top. Severus then shifted so that she could have her way, straddling across him and taking him in deeper in her new position.</p><p>He closed his eyes and imagined that Lily was the witch above him, the image in his head beautiful: her long auburn hair grazing her small breasts, green eyes burning with lust, skin practically glowing as she moved over him. He breathed in and could smell Lily’s scent, floral and feminine. In his mind's eye, she was kissing him, her tongue warm and soft against his. There was no harshness in her kiss or her desire, and as he moved his hands down the smooth skin of Lily’s back, he let out a moan, muffled by her passionate embrace. His hands roamed over her arse, small but pert. He brought his hand forward and grazed her vulva, giving a little pressure with the heel of his hand and deepening their kiss. Lily felt amazing to Severus, so soft under his touch, so gentle with her brushing fingertips, and so giving with her fervent kisses.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt the harshness of a bite on his bottom lip. Severus’ eyes flew open and he gripped her hips, holding her down and stopping her from moving. “Why’d you stop, love?” she panted.</p><p>Severus stared at the witch, her lips swollen from the kiss they shared. It had all been in his head. Of course it was; this wasn’t the woman he loved. Lily was dead and he had helped kill her.</p><p>A fresh wave of self-loathing washed over Severus. Moving fast, he shifted them so that he was behind the witch, thrusting his cock into her folds again. She giggled, then moaned in pleasure as he took her, but all Severus could hear was Lily laughing at a joke he told her, her chiding him for egging James Potter on during their school days, and her pleas to the Dark Lord as he cast the spell that took her life. He imagined her begging the Dark Lord for Harry’s life, and the strange look of fear that must have been painted on her face as the fatal spell hit her. He remembered the Dark Lord’s elation when he passed the prophecy along and his own self-hatred when he saw Lily’s lifeless body.</p><p>For the first time since leaving the Potters’ cottage in Godric’s Hollow, Severus allowed himself to cry, fucking the witch that looked like Lily, and he had never hated himself more.</p>
