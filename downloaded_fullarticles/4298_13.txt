</blockquote><p align="left">There she was.</p>
<p align="left">Sitting with her two dorky friends eating while laughing about some stupid joke the Hufflepuff guy said.</p>
<p align="left">Finn, aka the Hufflepuff guy, with his short curly hair and his robes perfectly put on.</p>
<p align="left">Poe Dameron, the Slytherin guy every house liked except his own. He was one of the most wanted guys by almost every girl in Hogwarts. </p>
<p align="left">And then, Rey Kenobi.</p>
<p align="left">That girl was a pain in the ass. A beautiful girl with blue eyes, dark hair and some freckles over her nose and cheeks. </p>
<p align="left">A filthy mudblood.</p>
<p align="left">At least that's what Ben Solo thought of her.</p>
<p align="left">Ben Solo was a Slytherin Prefect. He dominated almost every spell perfectly and had every girl at his feet. Boys wanted to be like him and teachers respected him for the great student he was.</p>
<p align="left">Except, obviously, Rey Kenobi.</p>
<p align="left">She had hated him since the first time they saw each other. It was in their first year in the train on their way to Hogwarts.</p>
<p align="left">Ben was a pureblood, he had spent all his life in the Wizarding World and knew everything you had to knew about it. Rey, on the other hand, was a muggleborn and knew nothing about this world. She lived in a little town not too far from London with her parents and they were pretty amused when her letter arrived.</p>
<p align="left">Eleven-Years-Old Ben Solo noticed her when she got into Platform 9 3/4 looking confused while holding her things and her Persian cat.</p>
<p align="left">She looked pretty, but the confusion on her face made him realize her blood status. Anyway, he walked towards her.</p>
<p align="left">“Let me help you with that” he said politely as he grabbed her things and helped her get inside the train.</p>
<p align="left">She followed him shyly until they got in an empty wagon.</p>
<p align="left">“T-thank you...” she managed to say. The way this boy just offered to help her without knowing her seemed really nice to her. She let herself down on the couch.</p>
<p align="left">“I'm Ben Solo” he sat down in from the of her and stretched his hand with hers.</p>
<p align="left">“Rey Kenobi... a pleasure, Ben Solo” </p>
<p align="left">Little Ben had been really amused by her politeness and well mannered self. But he mustn't forget who he ought to choose as his friends, so he asked her the important question.</p>
<p align="left">“Are you a pureblood?”</p>
<p align="left">Rey was astonished. Of all the things someone at Hogwarts could have asked, this boy chooses probably the most embarrassing.</p>
<p align="left">But he was sitting there waiting for an answer and it would've been impolite of her to just ignore him.</p>
<p align="left">“Well, my parents are... muggles” she said quietly, her cheeks turning red as Ben started laughing at her.</p>
<p align="left">“I knew I shouldn't have wasted my time on you, filthy mudblood” he said as he got up and turned to the door.</p>
<p align="left">“W-what?” Rey said almost in a whisper, holding back the tears.</p>
<p align="left">“Goodbye, you freak” and without letting her say anything else, Ben Solo left Rey alone in the wagon, where she stayed the whole trip, crying because of some stupid boy with some stupid standards.</p>
<p align="left">And since that moment, she had hated him. </p>
<p align="left">Rey got into Gryffindor while Mr. Perfect Blood Status got into Slytherin, which wasn't a surprise for her because he got to be...</p>
<p align="left">“With a bunch of air heads who think just like him with his fucking pureblood” Rey said angrily. “You know what? Ben Solo and all his Slytherin stupid gang can shove their fucking blood status up their asses”</p>
<p align="left">Finn and Poe exchanged sights.</p>
<p align="left">“First of all...” Poe began. “Ouch”</p>
<p align="left">“I'm not talking about you! I said his whole Slytherin gang, and you are not part of it” Rey put his hand on his. “You're my friend, the only cute and caring Slytherin I know”</p>
<p align="left">“Thank you” he smiled and Finn rolled his eyes. “Now, second of all, I secretly think he drives you crazy”</p>
<p align="left">Rey's face was so pale and confused that Finn and Poe couldn't help but burst out laughing.</p>
<p align="left">“What do you mean? Of course he drives me crazy!” she said taking her hands to her head. “I hate him, and I know for A FACT that he hates me to”</p>
<p align="left">“Dude, Poe didn't refer to that kind of drives-you-crazy...” Finn tried so hard to cointain his laugh but it was very difficult for him.</p>
<p align="left">“He's totally right” Poe did laugh. Intentionally.</p>
<p align="left">“What the fuck are you talking about?” she was getting mad and pretty blushed.</p>
<p align="left">“You have fellings for Ben Solo, Rey” Finn said, a little terrified that she would jinx him or simply Avada Kedavra him.</p>
<p align="left">“What has gotten into you?!” she shouted, getting some look at the Great Hall. “I don't have feelings for him, and I will never do, okay?”</p>
<p align="left">Both guys nodded half scared of her and half amused by her blushed face.</p>
<p align="left">Rey got up.</p>
<p align="left">“I need to take a shower” she said without making eye contact. “See you later”</p>
<p align="left">Ben Solo, sitting with his friends, didn't take his eyes off her until she left the Great Hall, and a great idea crossed his mind.</p>
<p align="left">“Guys, I'll see you later at the Common Room” he said while getting up.</p>
<p align="left">“Where are you going?” Cassian Andor, another Slytherin, asked him.</p>
<p align="left">“I just remembered I had a meeting with Snape” Ben answered almost ignoring him and rushed to the door to see if there was any sight of the girl.</p>
<p align="left">He smiled when he saw Rey was talking to McGonagall. She was right there, distracted, and once the professor left, he started following her.</p>
<p align="left">She was walking fast, probably stressed about something.</p>
<p align="left">Ben had noticed over the past six years knowing her that she used to walk fast and alone when something stressed her out. Not that he put to much attention at her and her problems, but he was observant.</p>
<p align="left">She jumped into one moving staircase and he saw she was going into the prefect's bathroom.</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>That should be interesting.</em>
</p>
<p align="left">He<em> </em>waited until she got into the bathroom before he ran up the stairs to suprise her in her shower.</p>
<p align="left">Ben noticed she locked the door and laugh. </p>
<p align="left">“Poor mudblood, don't you know what <em>Alohomora</em> is?” he said to himself and pronounce the spell to open the lock.</p>
<p align="left">He decided it would be much better if he caught her naked and watch her blush while yelling to him. He briefly asked himself how her body would look without any clothes on it and the sudden feeling of his pants tightening forced him to think about something else.</p>
<p align="left">Ben heard water running and he knew it was his moment. He pushed the door quietly and sneaked in the bathroom.</p>
<p align="left">He, as a prefect, went there usually so he knew every inch of the room perfectly. He walked a little closer to the water and noticed she was nowhere to be seen. Ben smirked to himself and took off his own clothes and slid into the warm water.</p>
<p align="left">It felt pretty relaxing and for a moment he forgot he was waiting for her.</p>
<p align="left">But suddenly, Rey appeared wearing nothing. She didn't see him, because he was at the other side of the giant bathtub, and so she lowered her body into the water. </p>
<p align="left">She began washing her hair and saw her face relax.</p>
<p align="left">Rey looked a little troubled when she saw her leaving the Great Hall but now she was there relaxing.</p>
<p align="left">He decided it was time to reveal himself, and so he did.</p>
<p align="left">“It seems I'm not alone anymore” he said and could see her shiver.</p>
<p align="left">“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE, ASSHOLE?”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
