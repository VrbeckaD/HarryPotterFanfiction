    <p>Harry had been living in Shreveport for what seemed like two years now. Ever since the war and Vampires coming out of the coffin it was a whole new world that he was still adjusting to. He knew about the vampire bar, Fangtasia and about the Vampire Sheriff but to him it really didn’t matter. He had acclimated himself to the muggle life. Now a days he was known as Ryan, Snake Wrangler. That’s right, he ran around every day cleaning snakes and other reptiles out of people homes and keep them safe. </p>
<p>See when the war ended things went just as he had suspected. He lost his magic and the Wizarding world turned on him. It was then that he got a letter from Sanguine telling him that vampires where about to come out of the shadows and reveal themselves thanks to the new drink, True Blood. So with the help of his vampire friend and the goblins he had sealed all of his Wizarding accounts and assets and hooked himself a cute little three bedroom house in a little area outside of town. </p>
<p>The house wasn’t all that fancy it was more of one of those homey houses. It was painted a off white color and one bedroom was on the first floor with the kitchen and living room. While the other two were on the second floor with a large open area in between where harry situated his office.  The only thing Harry had to change was beneath the house. He had the goblins dig out a small underground area large enough for three full sized coffins. He already had a coffin down there for Sanguine when he chose to visit, then two more spare regular coffins in case of guests. It was also the reason he kept a full stock of True Blood and Blood Pops. </p>
<p>Both bedrooms upstairs where fully made up in case of company, he was still known for having a few people of the Wizarding world to discreetly pop in. The room he slept in was on the first floor and it was anything but normal. The room was always kept nice and dark and it was a snake’s haven. That’s how he preferred it. When he couldn’t release a snake into a new area without potential threat he kept them with him instead of killing them. After all it’s not like they could hurt him. More than half of them had been living with him for over a year already and they were great conversationalists once you got them going. </p>
<p>Sighing deeply Harry turned and looked about him he really couldn’t be thinking about the past now was not the time. He had a rattlesnake in the area and worst of all is it was one he had yet to encounter. He never knew how these encounters where ganna turn out. See despite the fact that he could talk to them snakes where still very aggressive creatures. Sometimes a snake just refused to listen or the heat made it so agitated it would attack regardless of anything. </p>
<p>Harry looked behind him towards the window he could see the small family outside cuddling together. They sure as hell hadn’t expected to come home to a rattler in their home. Turning away he looked about the home and hissed softly.</p>
<p>“Hello? You in here little guy?”</p>
<p>He slowly got down on his hand and knees as he heard a small rattling sound. Looking up under the couch he smiled coming face to face with the little one. Slowly moving his hand toward it he was not surprised for the rattle at the tip of its tail to shake loudly. Pulling his hand back he frowned at it looking closely at the pattern and size.</p>
<p>He smiled sweetly not moving forward or back from where he was laying on the floor, “My apologies madam. I was not aware you where female. Want to come on out of there? You are really causing a lot of trouble for this family.”</p>
<p>The snake hissed curling into the classic s shape to attack, “They endanger mine! Back!”</p>
<p>Harry smiled sweetly, “Come on now. I can relocate you and your family somewhere safe. “</p>
<p>The snake whipped her large head about in anger, "silly speaker thinks he can solve everything. Back with you!"</p>
<p>Wincing he extended his hand slowly, "Come on I don’t want to hurt you. I have a warm furred bag for you and your eggs and once we are in the car you can sit in the front seat with them so you know I am not lying."</p>
<p>The snake paused her agitated rattle before nodding slowly, "Hurt my eggs and you die next"<br/>Harry smiled and stepped back giving a soft commanding for it to wait there. Walking out to the family he gave them a nod adjusting the black cowboy hat he wore, “You have a female rattler and her eggs. So I need all of you to step back when I start bringing her out. She is not a happy snake right now”</p>
<p>The mother grabbed her daughters hand and steered her further away while the husband nodded, “Alright you just get that there snake out of here. Things lucky I didn’t chop its head off with that there axe on the porch!”</p>
<p>Harry glared darkly before walking to his trunk and grabbing the thick furred sack he used for transporting eggs. Walking back into the house he shut the door lightly before laying belly down in front of the snake, “Hello again. Alright how about you inspect the pouch before I place your eggs inside hmm?”</p>
<p>The mother snake slither and coiled herself inside the pouch before hissing darkly, “I will stay here with my eggs”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind that but I will have to lift the lid to show them I at least caught you. I won’t be paid unless I do and I do kind of need the money.”</p>
<p>The snake gave a hissing laughter, “As you wish. I won’t bite…for now”</p>
<p>Harry frowned before carefully lifting the three eggs and placing them gently in the pouch brushing his fingers along the rattlers scales gently. Nothing made him smile more than helping snakes find new homes where they can’t get hurt or hurt others. Walking back outside he smiled at the family, “I’ve got all four of them out of there for you. You’re lucky she wasn’t as hard to catch as I thought.”</p>
<p>The husband glared darkly, “You got that there rattler without yer tongs? I dare say you be lying to me and my wife here”</p>
<p>The snake speaker smiled before lifting the lid carefully and tipped it just enough to show the husband the bright yellow slitted eyes of the rattler and rather enjoyed it when the man jumped back in surprise.</p>
<p>Smiling Harry cleared his throat closing the lid, “I will be sure to send the bill later.”</p>
<p>Slipping into the dark gun grey Ford F350 he placed the snake and eggs gently in the passenger seat smiling he lifted himself into the driver’s side and buckled in. He hissed gently at the mother snake, "Now I can drop you off in a nice forest or I can take you and your eggs back to my place. I have a nice spot in my room that you could use. Of course there would be rules if you chose my place."</p>
<p>The snake lifted herself up sliding across her eggs lightly, "Forest please. I wish not for human company."</p>
<p>Harry nodded and revved the engine up turning along the roads with a swift confidence. After dropping this feisty mother off he was done till his next call which who knows when that would be. He was going to get home and wait for Sanguine. The vamp was supposed to stop in today and he was anxious to see a familiar face once more. He hadn’t seen the vampire in almost two months now. Pulling off onto a rocky path he hissed darkly and the jarring motion. Apologizing to the angry mother snake. Pulling to a stop he lifted his precious cargo and began to walk out into the woods. This was the same woods he dropped all his snakes off into. Every snake he dropped off he made promise not to bother other snakes and he often came out to visit a few of them. Smiling he found a nice fallen tree and set the mother and her eggs down letting the snake settle in. With short goodbyes he left them to their new home and climbed back up into the ford and headed homeward with a large smile. </p>
<p>He made it home in a timely fashion and walked into the house with a sigh at the cool temperature that most of the house was kept at. Tossing his keys into the small bowl ad his vest up on the coat hook he allowed his body to slowly stretch and unwind as the hat was put with the vest. The shriek of his cell phone only made him groan again in disgust. Lifting it to his ear he murmured out, "This is Ryan the Snake how might I help you today?"</p>
<p>A snort came across the line and Harry smiled brightly before commenting happily, "Sorry San didn’t look at the calling number. What ya need?"</p>
<p>"There accent is wearing off on you childe. Look the Sheriff of Shreveport wants to tag along tonight and meet you."</p>
<p>Harry raised a brow, "Come again Sanguine?"</p>
<p>The vampire sighed, "I have to sign in with him every time I come to visit you. He wants to meet the man that I visit so often. Apparently it is strange for a vampire to visit a living friend."</p>
<p>The young wizard hissed lightly, "Sure bring him over. I will break out the blood wine. When will you get here?"</p>
<p>"Just after sundown. Most of us are already awake"</p>
<p>Harry nodded and looked out the window, "Alright see you then. Bye"</p>
<p>Closing the phone with a click he placed it next to his keys and walked across the room into the closed door. A warm moist heat consumed him and he took a large deep breath. Several hisses of welcome met his ears and he said hello to them as well. Shedding his clothes he fell into the bed his naked flesh sliding across the soft silk and the occasional scaled body of a friendly snake. It wasn’t long before the 14 snakes in his care where sliding across him in welcome helping him ease away the stress of the day. They always knew when things where tough on him. </p>
<p>He thanked them and slowly stood up removing each friendly snake and set them back where they desired to perch the most often. A familiar weight dropped onto his shoulder and Harry smiled as he walked into his large bathroom and began to fill the large walk in bath tub. He had fallen in love with the large floor baths at Hogwarts so this house had one specially made for him. Sliding into the warm water he watched the long deadly snake skim the water about him its black lined mouth opening every few minutes in pleasure at the warm depths. </p>
<p>"Cassius you are just so spoiled"</p>
<p>The snake looked up at him, "I am your snake, before the others. You are my human. Yes I am spoiled. I am king over the other snakes yes?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded and let his fingers drag along the beautiful brownish grey scales, "Yes Cassius you are my king snake"</p>
<p>The two bathed before Harry noticed it was time to get out and dressed. Climbing out of the water he shivered as the snake slid up over his skin till he draped about his neck. Rolling his eyes he turned his head to kiss the deadly snake on the coffin shaped head. “My sweet King.”</p>
<p>The snake raised his head and laughed hissingly his black mouth revealing razor-sharp fangs, “My human”</p>
