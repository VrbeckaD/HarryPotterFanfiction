</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Isabella watched as the clouds steadily moved across the sky following the breeze.</p><p> </p><p>She watched as they hid the stars and moon from her sight, but the light still shined through small breaches in the mist.</p><p> </p><p>Shadows were cast on the stone floor in front of her and across the faces around her, shrouding them all in darkness.</p><p> </p><p>She knew, looking up at the sky, that it wasn't real.</p><p> </p><p>Others would believe it was, and she pitied them for that. They would believe that the great hall they were currently crowding had no ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>But the rain that fell from the skies did not touch her face, and the breeze did not cool her down or play with her hair. It was simply an enchantment, a parlour trick designed to impress the foolish. A minuscule piece of magic made to astound, and by the sound of the chatter around her it had worked. The dark faces surrounding her gasped and pointed amazed by a sky that was shown on the inside of a building.</p><p> </p><p>‘Pathetic’ she thought to herself as she looked around, turning her nose up at the easily impressed and less educated individuals. The small group were all packed in close together as they slowly shuffled through the noisy hall.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not real the ceiling. It’s just bewitched to look like the sky outside, I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.’</p><p> </p><p>The obnoxious and high-pitched voice broke through the loud chatter in the room. The girl that belonged to the voice was more hair than person. She looked almost like a distant relative of the half-breed who brought them from the train. The monstrosity was loose and frizzy covering the swotty little girl’s face from view.</p><p> </p><p>“Mudblood?” Her cousin suddenly whispered in her ear. She turned to see the look of disgust on his face, as he peered at the girl.</p><p> </p><p>“Most-likely.” She whispered back quickly meeting his eyes with a smirk, before looking forwards again. “You’ll have to learn tolerance Draco, they’re all over the place here, especially the half bloods.”</p><p> </p><p>His face dropped at that and he turned his head away to begin looking out at the crowd with narrowed eyes, trying to discern just by sight who had pure-blood and whom among them were less worthy. They continued their march down the hall following the path laid out: between the four extended tables and towards a single stool, with an old and moth bitten hat resting atop it.</p><p> </p><p>'Now that’s impressive magic.'  To bring an object to life and give it intelligence, judgement and a will of its own. She didn’t hear the obnoxious girl admiring the hat though, it obviously wasn’t as show-stopping as a see-through ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>‘Short-sighted fools, the lot of them.’</p><p> </p><p>The older woman at the front of the room had introduced herself as Professor McGonagall. The stern old witch, dressed in traditional wizarding robes and hat, had already begun looking down her crooked nose at the new students in front her. Isabella already knew her to be the head of the Gryffindor house.</p><p> </p><p>When she stood before them everyone immediately fell silent, including those already seated at the tables. She was the type of person that demanded your attention with a single look, and no-one seemed to go against her ruling.</p><p> </p><p>Standing beside the stool, she stood and spoke out it a strong voice:</p><p> </p><p>“Now before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.”</p><p> </p><p>An old man slowly raised himself from his seat at the head of the hall. His beard reached all the way to his knees, and the robes he wore were deep purple with twinkling silver stars all over them. Another way to impress the ignorant souls, Isabella thought to herself as she rolled her eyes upwards at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>“I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce.” Professor Dumbledore began in a loud voice. “The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker Mr Filch has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right is off limits to all those who do not wish to die a terrible death. Thank-you.”</p><p> </p><p>As he sat back down he kept his attention solely on one person who stood at the front of the crowd. She would have bet her cousins' life that it was Harry Potter, she wouldn’t be betting her own life on anything.</p><p> </p><p>“Now, when I call your name, you will come forth. I will place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses.” McGonagall peered over the parchment she was holing up in front of her, making sure that they were all listening closely. Her eyes were serious and narrowed slightly as if looking for any trouble makers before they could even cause trouble. She must have been pleased with her assessment as she promptly returned to her list and began summoning students in that broad Scottish accent:</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione Granger”</p><p> </p><p>The displeasing girl from before walked forwards, lecturing herself in a quiet voice as she went. Taking excessively deep breaths, she perched on the very edge of the stool uncomfortably as the hat was placed atop her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Mental that one, I’m telling ya,” Weasley whispered quietly to Potter who stood by his side.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe he does have a semblance of intellect after all.” She murmured to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous. Even a blood-traitor would be able to tell that she’s mad, maybe all the magic has got to her muggle brain.” Draco muttered back snidely making her smirk to herself. Maybe it’s true, they must feel insane when they first come here, the girl could already be touched.</p><p> </p><p>“GRYFFINDOR!”</p><p> </p><p>The hat gave out a yell startling the crowd. She and Draco tried remained still and stoic though, they had been taught better than to show emotion. As Hermione ran to the Gryffindor table McGonagall called out the next name, then the next and then the next.</p><p> </p><p>Hannah Abbott, Hufflepuff.</p><p> </p><p>Susan Bones, Hufflepuff</p><p> </p><p>Terry Boot, Ravenclaw.</p><p> </p><p>Mandy Brocklehurst, Ravenclaw.</p><p> </p><p>Lavender Brown, Gryffindor.</p><p> </p><p>Millicent Bulstrode, Slytherin,</p><p> </p><p>On and on it went as names were called and children sorted. Slytherin welcomed their new members respectably with hand-shakes and cool indifference. The first years sat at the very end of the table poised and proper, that was where Isabella would be sat, that was where she belonged. They didn’t give the extravagant and emotional greetings the other houses seemed to hold preference over.</p><p> </p><p>Every time someone was sorted into Gryffindor the entire house stood from their benches and cheered, banging their hands on the tables, stamping their feet and whistling in celebration. They were very uncouth, and by far the loudest and most energetic of all the houses.</p><p> </p><p>Ravenclaw was better, they welcomed their members with warm handshakes and conversation. Very dry conversation however, they immediately talked to them about the lessons they would be taking and asking which they were most excited about.</p><p> </p><p>Hufflepuff was a mess. Every new member was greeted emotionally, she swears some of the students cried at each new student joining them. They were all hugs and sympathy and kindness. It was ridiculous.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t need to worry about that, she was a Slytherin through and through. That was how her aunt and uncle had raised her. It’s how her mother and father would have raised her if they could. If the ministry hadn’t wrongfully imprisoned them.</p><p> </p><p>Neville Longbottom, Gryffindor.</p><p> </p><p>Unbelievable. The boy that had stood before her was the reason her parents were in prison, if only they could have seen him now. There is no way this boy would have been the one to vanquish the dark lord; he was short, fat and one-hundred percent should have been sent straight into Hufflepuff, if the quivering of his chin was anything to go by.</p><p> </p><p>As he ran back from the Gryffindor table to return the hat he had left on his head, he caught her eye. Clearly, the glare she was wearing on her face was enough for him to get the message. His eyes widened in shock, taken aback by her cool reception, he obviously couldn’t understand why she disliked him so much already. But then again, he didn’t know who she was yet.</p><p> </p><p>

    <em>Lestrange Manor – December 20<sup>th</sup> 1981</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>

</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>         Isabella had only been an infant at the time so she couldn’t actually remember what happened, but the story had been told so many times that she could picture it in her head. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em> </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Her mother and father had come storming through the doors of her bedroom in a frenzy, shocking her Aunt Narcissa who had been looking after her while they were out. Her mother’s beautiful dress was covered in blood, her hands were dripping red and there were splatters all over her face, her father’s state was just barely better off. He had immediately stormed to her wardrobe and began to pack her things, while her mother went straight to her aunt. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em> </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Isabella did vaguely remember hearing her mother’s, frantic and rushed whispers to her aunt as she walked over to Isabella. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em> </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>She had been picked her up from her bed as her mother began putting a coat on ready to take her somewhere. By this point her bags were packed and her father was waiting at the bedroom door, sharply telling his wife to hurry. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em> </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>They had managed to get to the main staircase in the foyer, heading straight to the apparition point when the Aurors had arrived. They knocked down the doors so quickly that her parents didn’t stand a chance of escaping. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em> </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>She definitely remembered hearing her mother’s screams as they magically bound her, taking her away with her feet dragging on the floor. Her father had managed to put up a better fight, 3 aurors lost their life that night in a flash of green, but he had eventually been subdued as well. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em> </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>She hadn’t known it then but that was the last time she would see her mother and father free. That was the day they were taken to Azkaban. </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em> </em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Her Aunt had managed to get away unseen, leaving Isabella on her own in the foyer screaming for her parents. One of the Aurors picked her up and tried to calm her while the others raided and stripped the entire manor of all magical objects.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Draco Malfoy.” Professor McGonagall’s drawl was enough to interrupt her thoughts again. She watched her cousin leave her side and strut towards the hat. He seated himself on the stool comfortably with no trace of nervousness on his face. She nodded at him when his eyes passed over her, letting him know he did well. The hat had barely touched even a hair on his head when it shouted out:</p><p> </p><p>“SLYTHERIN!”</p><p> </p><p>She smirked at him as he passed by, walking slowly towards Slytherin where he was eagerly greeted by some of the older students – the Malfoy name would certainly carry some weight here.</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter’s turn was next. As his name was called out whispering descended upon the hall, everyone craned to get a look at the boy-who-had-the-audacity-to-live. She rolled her eyes up again, these people were starting to test her patience. He was, typically, sorted into Gryffindor and received the largest applause yet.</p><p> </p><p>Several of the Gryffindor students started chanting:</p><p> </p><p>“We got Potter! We got Potter!”</p><p> </p><p> ‘As if that’s something to celebrate.’ She thought to herself.</p><p> </p><p>Ron was sorted soon afterward, of course, he made Gryffindor along with all his other siblings.</p><p> </p><p>And then, finally, it was her turn.</p><p> </p><p>“Isabella Lestrange.”</p><p> </p><p>The reaction to Potter’s name was nothing compared to this.</p><p> </p><p>Silence immediately stretched across the hall. Everyone stopped what they were doing and turned to watch her, even Professor McGonagall seemed to take a deep breath after she read the name aloud. Isabella was used to this; her name was just as infamous as Potters was famous. The only noise heard throughout the hall was a small gasp from the Gryffindor table.</p><p> </p><p>It was Longbottom, he finally understood. His face had gone pale as all the blood left it, he was in utter shock as he stared at her and looked as if he would be sick. One of the older students came and sat by his side to give him support – they knew what happened. They all knew the story.</p><p> </p><p>She threw the sweetest smile she could his way as she looked directly into his eyes, he quickly turned his head away.</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter was looking around himself in complete confusion, he nudged Ron in his side so that he would tell him what was going on, but Ron never moved his eyes away from Isabella’s face.</p><p> </p><p>She slowly walked up the steps with intent, letting everyone take a good look at the Lestrange girl they never thought they would know. She smiled again at McGonagall as she sat on the chair, and received nothing but a narrow-eyed stare over thin pale lips in response. The hat was placed on her head and she heard the only noise in the hall.</p><p> </p><p>The hat was speaking to her.</p><p> </p><p>“Interesting. Very Interesting. You have the same morals and beliefs as your cousin, yes that’s true. All that blood purity <em>rage</em> and an interest in dark magic. On the surface, you are Slytherin through and through, just like your mother. Just like your father. But there is something else… something deeper that even you don’t know of yet. How very curious.</p><p> </p><p>“There is more to you than meets the eye, Miss Lestrange, more to you than even you know. Your soul runs deeper than many, especially those in Slytherin, hmmm…what to do with you?”</p><p> </p><p>Isabella began to feel confused and annoyed. She was Slytherin. She knew she was. So why hadn’t the hat shouted it out already?</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, yes I suppose you are. Well… you are right now. But there is so much room for change. The power you will possess will be immense, and the role you take on will be even more so. These things may change you, so will you be Slytherin for long? …I think not. Believe me, you won’t like this my dear, but it’s better for you this way. In fact… it’s better for everyone.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a pregnant pause in the hall as Isabella’s eyes widened in shock. This was not happening. The hat said she was a Slytherin, so she should be put in Slytherin.</p><p> </p><p>Blind panic overtook her, what if it put her in Gryffindor?</p><p> </p><p>The hat was trying to mould her, make her good and change her beliefs by putting her in the most disgusting house of all Hogwarts. It was wrong! The panic immediately changed to rage, and heat flowed through her body as she took a deep breath and tried not to let it show. All the emotion was swirling around her body and thoughts flying through her head. She was half surprised her magic didn’t lash out and wreak havoc. McGonagall however seemed to sense a change and took a tentative step backwards.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know if she wanted to cry, to scream, to incinerate the damned hat before it could speak, or to simply kill Longbottom then and there to prove how Slytherin she could be, consequences be damned. At least then she could be with her mother and father even if it was in Azkaban.</p><p> </p><p> Just as she was about the act the hat yelled out, and in her panic, Isabella was surprised she even heard what it had said.</p><p> </p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!”</p><p> </p>
