  <em> 1) at my mother’s table </em>
</p><p>Regulus is dying. He is dying and he deserves it, the drink of despair coursing through his veins like poison, like the shame and guilt and horror at his own actions on behalf of the Dark Lord. Far too belated to help his victims, far too late to do them any good.</p><p>But not too late to avenge them, he hopes for a brief, fleeting moment, imagining an impossible, bright future where Kreacher somehow destroys the Dark Lord’s Horcrux, his foolish older brother’s gang of friends actually manage to defeat the Death Eaters, and perhaps Albus Dumbledore--the only man the Dark Lord ever feared--would finally do his damn duty and fight.</p><p>But this drop of optimism is washed away, a flood of fear drowning it, and all these damned water metaphors do nothing because he is so thirsty, dying of it.</p><p>The lake! The lake, so close and so full. If he can just get to the shore, just dip his hand in, just to drink, a small drink.</p><p>Just close enough to reach.</p><p>Regulus forgets, in his delirium and desperation, that there is more in the lake than just water. Or perhaps he doesn’t forget. Perhaps he is just so thirsty, so eager to quench this magical thirst that all he cares about is the water, the soothing, cooling water.</p><p>He drags himself to the shore, face mere inches above the lake’s surface, his reflection already the grotesque corpse he knows it is destined to become.</p><p>He reaches for the water, his reflection reaching back. Then through. Pale, skeletal arm breaching the surface and grabbing, pulling, dragging, drowning!</p><p>Regulus is dying. He is dying and he deserves it and is prepared for it…</p><p>… but Regulus doesn’t want to die.</p><p>I don’t want to die, he thinks, even as he weakly thrashes against the inferi’s grip. I don’t want to die, he thinks, as more of them appear, grabbing and pulling, into the water that he had been so desperate to reach before.</p><p>I don’t want to die. I don’t want it to end like this. Someone help me!</p><p>“Yeah, alright,” a voice says, young and completely out of place, right before a sword--crackling and bright--slashes through the arms holding him down, “But mostly because I really hate the undead.”</p><p>Now freed, Regulus splutters, hacking and coughing up water. He thirsts, still, but the mortal danger has reordered his priorities. </p><p>A hand fists itself into the back of his robes. He flinches away at first, instinctively, before he realizes he’s not being dragged down, but lifted up. To his feet. And his wand--which he had somehow forgotten in all this, discarded in his delirious crawl to the lake’s edge--is placed into his hand. He’s shaking so hard he can barely grip it, but the hand that secures him, while smaller, is far steadier.</p><p>“Are you okay?” says the voice behind the hand, a young woman shorter than him in strange garb. Behind her, Regulus can spot more people in similarly unfamiliar clothing--a young man near her age with dark hair, fending off inferi with a sword of white light; an older man with hair gone grey but sprightly nonetheless, somehow walking on the surface of the lake; and an alarming number of identical blondes all of whom are, horrifyingly, trying to fight the inferi with their fists.</p><p>“Fire,” Regulus rasps out, because he is soaked and dying and either he or the world has gone mad but on the off chance neither of them have, he may as well aid in their continued survival. “Inferi are weak to fire.”</p><p>“Huh, that’s useful,” the young woman says, before calling out something to her fellows--each of them changing tack in response, the dark haired man going so far as to <em> set himself on fire </em>. The woman, however, looks up at Regulus, perfectly calm, and so he suppresses his confusion and panic. “Thank you for that intel,” she says, “You’ve got some kind of toxin in your system, but I don’t know enough healing to filter it out of your system for you. I could try something else if it needs urgent treatment?”</p><p>A kind offer, on top of already saving his life, but Regulus isn’t going to let a novice attempt mysterious medical practices on his person, “Not fatal,” he says, voice rough from the near drowning and also the parched throat, “No antidote, but it’ll pass…” He hesitates, a foolish, weak habit, but he also doesn’t want to seem ungrateful by asking for more. But he is still so thirsty. “Water?” </p><p>“Sure,” she says with an easy shrug, conjuring--or, no, it’s not transfiguration at all--a metal canteen into her hand, “I have a packet you can add to it, if you need electrolyte--oh, well, okay...” she trails off as Regulus behaves positively boorish, snatching the canteen from her and drinking from it without even allowing her to finish speaking.</p><p>But he drinks and he drinks, the canteen endless, and without the threat of inferi--or, that is, with an increasingly lowered threat of inferi--the quenching of his thirst is the only thing his mind can focus on.</p><p>That is, until the young woman says, “Now let’s talk about how to stop a creepy old snake guy from becoming immortal.”</p><p> </p>

  <em> 2) upright in the gloom </em>
</p><p>“It’s a flaming cup with enough sentience to be tricked by genjutsu but not enough sentience to protect itself from being tricked and they let it pick teenagers for a dangerous competition based on names?” Sasuke summarizes dryly after Shikako has translated the situation as best she could.</p><p>“It’s a goblet... and the tournament isn’t any more dangerous from the chuunin exams, from what I can tell,” Shikako demurs, a defense so mild it hardly counts.</p><p>“But they don’t even get to have their teammates!” Naruto exclaims, causing the circle of magicians to eye them warily. Kakashi-sensei, with his lone visible eye, does his best to reciprocate.</p><p>Shikako shrugs.</p><p>“And even after they already knew it was tampered with,” Sasuke continues, almost horrified with how stupid the tale is, “They decided to accept the flaming cup’s--”</p><p>“--goblet--”</p><p>“--chosen champions. Including the fourth one. Even though the flaming cup--”</p><p>“--goblet--”</p><p>“--is only supposed to choose three. And they didn’t even bring it to a sealing master to get it checked?” Sasuke finishes, so incredulous it hurts. He joins Kakashi-sensei in staring down the circle of magicians with disparaging disbelief.</p><p>“... yes,” Shikako says, voice thick with secondhand embarrassment on behalf of the Hogwarts faculty, “... that’s correct.”</p><p>“Then I don’t see why they should have a problem with us being here,” Sasuke says stubbornly, crossing his arms to punctuate.</p><p>Shikako snorts, “You don’t see why they might have a problem with a team of unknown people suddenly appearing in the middle of their school? Their school full of children.” Konoha would have immediately responded with considerable force to an infiltration attempt at the Academy, suspicious staring is mild in comparison. Although that may just be proving Sasuke’s point:</p><p>“Their school full of children that they let a flaming cup--”</p><p>“--goblet--”</p><p>“--whatever, goblet, fine--it still decides their fates.” Sasuke huffs.</p><p>“And ours, apparently,” Kakashi-sensei finally says. Given the way Sasuke tenses further and falls silent at that, their sensei has hit on the uncomfortable, unspoken question.</p><p>Why did the Goblet of Fire bring them here?</p><p>“Maybe Goblet-san was trying to fix its mistake,” Naruto suggests, breaking the oppressive silence.</p><p>The rest of the team look at him in various level of surprise and confusion.</p><p>“What?” Shikako asks.</p><p>“Well, Goblet-san made a mistake when it was under a genjutsu, right?” Naruto explains, “And even though it’s not Goblet-san’s fault, it still put a kid who’s not even a genin yet into the chuunin exams.”</p><p>Not exactly right, but close enough. “Okay,” Shikako says, encouragingly.</p><p>“But there’s only supposed to be one person per village in this exam.” Naruto continues, the mixed metaphors somehow following his train of thought, “And there was already a genin for this village. Which means the Academy kid doesn’t have a village, even though he’s still in the exam.”</p><p>Shikako nods, “Right… so?”</p><p>“Well, maybe we’re supposed to be his village. Maybe that’s why Goblet-san brought us here! Maybe we’re here to make sure nothing bad happens to the Academy kid outside of the exams and also train him so he can put up a good fight against the genin!” Naruto finishes, excited at the prospect of a cool mission and a fun competition, even if it’s not him competing.</p><p>Shikako considers it, turns to Sasuke and Kakashi-sensei who are also considering it. Sasuke rolls his eyes, but doesn’t say anything against the idea. Kakashi-sensei shrugs, “I don’t see why not. He can’t be any more trouble than you three.”</p><p>Shikako smiles, “That settles it, then,” she says, before turning to the Hogwarts faculty and explaining their decision.</p><p>Even through the language barrier, it’s easy to interpret the surprise, confusion, and denial that the adult magicians respond with...</p><p>… but the scrawny kid with glasses looks at them with hope on his face so, really, that decides the matter right there and then.</p><p> </p>

  <em> 3) those unending fables </em>
</p><p>Harry opens the door.</p><p>Harry opens the door not knowing what will be inside, but hoping it’ll be something new, something useful, something that will <em> actually make the DA strong enough to defend themselves </em> and not just a bunch of school children waving disarming spells against seasoned killers.</p><p>Harry opens the door not knowing what will be inside, because as he paced back and forth and back and forth and back and forth in that seventh floor hallway, his head had been muddled. Thoughts twisting about what the DA needed, what he needed to help the DA, what they needed to give them an edge that wouldn’t have the Order continuously dismissing them, what they needed to be able to survive the Death Eaters.</p><p>Harry opens the door, not knowing what to expect, but certainly not this: an expansive blue sky, trees and grass, a stream cutting through a field with a red bridge above it. In the distance, the tops of unusually shaped buildings, and even further away a massive mountain with what looks like faces carved into it. Up close, three strangers all looking at him in surprise.</p><p>Harry opens the door and must make some kind of sound because Ron and Hermione--on watch for the Inquisitorial Squad--go to his side, peeking into the doorway, and spotting the… room?... for themselves. Meanwhile, two of the strangers turn to the third, expectant, only for her to shrug and say something in a strange language.</p><p>“Bloody hell, this place is huge!” Ron says, looking about, “I didn’t know the Room could make places this big.”</p><p>“I don’t think the Room made this place,” Hermione says, “I mean, unless this is all exceptionally thorough illusionary magic--which we’ve proven it’s not since we were able to interact with objects in the Room last week--then it’s more likely the Room created an opening to wherever this is,” she rambled, hypotheses on the Room’s capabilities discarded, adjusted, and created as she spoke, “Since I doubt even Hogwarts has enough magic to create a whole environment much less people,”</p><p>Speaking of people. “Er, hello?” Harry tries, because the whole ‘unknown language’ thing doesn’t bode well, but given from their point of view Harry and Ron and Hermione all just invaded their space, the strangers are being surprisingly non hostile.</p><p>“Hello,” the woman says, and before Harry can wonder if it’s just a matter of her repeating what he said, she continues, “You’re far from home, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Not really?” Harry says.</p><p>“Yeah, on this side of the door, we’re still home.” Ron adds, gesturing to what, for them is still the Hogwarts seventh floor hallway.</p><p>“Fair enough.” the woman accedes easily, “I suppose this makes us temporary neighbors, then.”</p><p>Her two companions stare, watchful but not concerned. Also, a little blankly. Not the same way Crabbe and Goyle do as they flank Malfoy--as if they had a quota on thoughts and didn’t want to use it up too soon--but literally uncomprehending of the words being said.</p><p>“So…” the woman continues, “Why are you here?” she asks simply, which Harry appreciates. “Or, rather, why did you have <em> your </em> ‘here’ meet <em> our </em> ‘here’?” Which is less simple, but not entirely wrong, he supposes.</p><p>Why did the Room bring them here?</p><p>“That’s it?” Hermione asks, tone in that mix of baffled and pointed she gets whenever he and Ron slack off on their essays in order to do basically anything else instead, “Not who we are or how we got here? Just, why?”</p><p>“Well, who you are largely depends on why you’ve brought yourselves unannounced to my home. At this point, you’re strangers, so your names don’t mean nearly as much as your intentions. As for the how,” the woman shrugs again, “it’s not the first time I’ve dealt with an interdimensional rift, though you are far more pleasant to deal with than an eldritch god of destruction and suffering.”</p><p>What?</p><p>“What?” Hermione asks, the question strangled and warped with confusion, curiosity, and horror.</p><p>One of her companions, the one with dark hair, says something. Looking at her and the, no doubt, alarmed expressions on their faces. She responds sheepishly, the blonde laughs, and the dark haired man rolls his eyes.</p><p>“Sorry about that. Sasuke says I shouldn’t inflict my terrible sense of humor on other people,” the woman says which explains absolutely nothing, “But since he’s not my captain anymore, he doesn’t get to tell me what to do.”</p><p>Now that’s something, “Captain like in an army?”</p><p>“Could be for quidditch,” Ron mutters, as if compelled to say so even though he didn’t really believe it himself.</p><p>“No,” the woman says, “not for the army.” Which brings Harry’s hopes down just a little, before she continues, “For covert ops. Although, during the war, I technically outranked him. But that’s mostly because at the start I had to deal with managing the platoons while he actually got deployed with them.”</p><p>“So you know how to run an army,” Harry says, that twisted web of thoughts untangling.</p><p>“Harry!” Hermione gasps, though he can’t tell what she means by it.</p><p>The woman shrugs, “Enough.”</p><p>“And you won your war? Everyone survived?” Harry asks, voice thick with something, he doesn’t know, but it makes the woman stare for a long, riveting moment, before her expression and tone both soften.</p><p>“We won,” she says, simply, deliberately stepping aside the second question, “Is that why you’re here? You need an army?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Ron says.</p><p>“No!” Hermione says.</p><p>Harry doesn’t listen to their argument, doesn’t turn to look at them. He maintains eye contact with the woman and says, “We need to win a war.”</p><p>She turns to her companions, says something to them and they listen, consider, nod. The dark haired man conjures a hawk, speaks to it before sending it flying back towards the town in the distance. The blonde man <em> duplicates himself </em> for a moment, before the copy disappears in a puff of smoke.</p><p>Then the woman turns back to him and smiles, a sharp and vicious thing, “We can help with that.” </p><p> </p>

  <em> 4) shrines never made </em>
</p><p>When Shikako walks through the vast emptiness of what she hopes is sealing space and not, in fact, purgatory she walks for what must be an entire lifetime before finding something else. Someone else, that is.</p><p>The man with dark hair, green eyes, and a shimmering cloak looks at her and asks, “Oh, you too?”</p><p>“Me too what?” Shikako asks, the words so simple they crash into each other, molecules of air in an atmosphere that doesn’t exist. Not here.</p><p>He pauses, confused by her confusion, which frankly seems a little unfair given he barely asked a proper question and there is literally nothing about this place that could provide context.</p><p>“Are you Death?” he asks instead, which is so far on the other side of answerability of questions that Shikako immediately denies it:</p><p>“No,” she says, quick and sharp. Then, slower and softer, “... are you?”</p><p>“I’m… fairly sure I’m not,” he answers, the lack of confidence not exactly inspiring.</p><p>They stare at each other.</p><p>There is nothing else in this place to look at.</p><p>“What did you mean by you too?” Shikako finally asks, because if this is her only company for who knows how long, it’d be best not to alienate him. “I’m Shikako, by the way.”</p><p>“I’m Harry, nice to meet you,” says Harry, pleasantries making for a quick response, “And, well, I assumed maybe you also collected the Hallows.” He says the last word with almost visible importance, but it’s tinged with an almost conflicted contempt.</p><p>Shikako looks down at herself. Ever since hammerspace, she never really carried much on her person--so she doesn’t have much in the way of pouches or pockets. Even if she did, would they still contain the physical items or is it all just a mental representation of herself? Can she even access hammerspace from here?</p><p>“What are the Hallows?” she asks instead. Maybe she did collect them but without knowing what they are.</p><p>“Do you want the quick version or the fairy tale?” Harry asks.</p><p>Shikako looks around them, the open blankness that stretches in all directions, then back at Harry. “I don’t think there’s anything else I’m scheduled for today,” she says dryly, before adding far more sincerely, “And I do like a good story.”</p><p>She crosses her legs and lowers herself to the not-ground, as if she were a child waiting for story time. She even pats the not-ground next to her in invitation.</p><p>“It’s not that good a story,” Harry mutters, but he drops down beside her, so Shikako certainly won’t complain.</p><p>“It starts with a river, a broken bridge, and three brothers…” he begins, reluctant, but the words and the cadence speaks of a story often told and well remembered, and the recitation of it takes over before long.</p><p>He’s right, though, it’s not that good a story. Two of the brothers die in grisly, gruesome ways, and while the third had a fulfilling life it doesn’t make up for the bleak undertone of the whole thing. Not to mention the real life effects of the items: Dark Lords and Headmasters; traitors and loyal servants; inheritance, rights by conquest, futile attempts at immortality, and the boy stuck in the middle of it all.</p><p>“So because you’re the only one who owned all of them at the same time, you’re stuck here?” Shikako asks, now that would be a terrible ending.</p><p>“I guess,” Harry says, fiddling with the stick--<em> the </em>Deathstick--in his hand.</p><p>“Your Headmaster got awfully close,” Shikako says, “He had the cloak and the wand before you went to school. If he had been proactive about getting rid of Tom instead of waiting to use you, he could’ve looked into Tom’s significant places and found the ring way earlier.”</p><p>The wide-eyed expression on Harry’s face could just as easily be heartbreak or horror, maybe both.</p><p>She looks away from his face, somewhat guiltily, eyes the dark, cracked ring on his finger instead. “Anyway, I don’t think I’ve encountered anything like those items before,” Shikako says, shrugging.</p><p>“Yeah, I figured not, but still. I had to ask,” Harry says with a sigh.</p><p>“It could be I--maybe--might know…” Shikako starts, stops, stammers her way into an explanation, “... given your story and what I can remember of what I was working on before I got here--wherever here is--I think I might know why I also ended up here.”</p><p>He stares at her, curiosity obvious.</p><p>“It could still be two different things, though,” Shikako hedges. She doesn’t want to be misleading, after all, “I mean, we could both be dead and this is a really weird afterlife.”</p><p>“Great,” Harry says with all the cheer it deserves. “And the other option?”</p><p>She hesitates, “Before I ended up here, I was working on a technique. Well, trying to reverse engineer a technique, more like,” Shikako pauses, “Actually, now that I think of it, there could be a third option.”</p><p>“You didn’t even finish saying the second option,” Harry prompts impatiently.</p><p>“What was the title again? Master of Death?” Shikako asks, seeking confirmation.</p><p>Harry nods, then makes a gesture as if to say ‘get on with it’.</p><p>“Well... the technique I was trying to reverse engineer was to summon the god of death in order to have it enter a contract,” Shikako admits, grimacing at how awful it sounds spoken out loud.</p><p>Harry stares at her.</p><p>He says nothing.</p><p>She understands. If someone implied she was the god of death she doesn’t know what she would say either.</p><p>“There’s always the third option which is a fun combination of the two?” she says, grimace now a painful apologetic smile.</p><p>Still, Harry says nothing.</p><p>“I could have failed horribly and you’re supposed to tell me a story about the hubris of humankind trying to outsmart Death before I shuffle off in whatever direction of afterlife I’m supposed to go in,” she says, even though Harry probably isn’t all that interested in what she has to say now. Though she does appreciate the fact that he didn’t just get up and storm off...</p><p>... after a not-lifetime of awkward silence, Harry finally says, “I think you’re selling yourself short here.”</p><p>Confused, Shikako asks, “How so?”</p><p>“A person who can summon Death could also be considered the Master of Death,” Harry says, “And if you’re supposing that becoming the Master of Death means they become Death…”</p><p>“That seems very cyclical and maybe paradoxical?” Shikako argues, “And I don’t even have anything like the Hallows.”</p><p>Harry looks at her and--maybe it’s because they’re surrounded by unending nothingness, but maybe they were always like this--his eyes seeming to glow an ominous, otherworldly green.</p><p>“What were you reverse engineering?” he asks.</p><p>“A summoning technique?” she answers, uncertain but unable to refuse.</p><p>Harry shakes his head, “No--what was the object?” he clarifies, though given how leading the question is, he must somehow already know.</p><p>“... a mask,” Shikako admits reluctantly.</p><p>“A sword, a necklace, a mask,” Harry lists out, the objects--the Sword of the Thunder God, her Gelel pendant necklace, and the Death God’s Mask--appearing between them as if summoned in the infinite void. Harry continues, “Not too different from a wand, a ring, and a cloak.”</p><p>Shikako stares at him. She realizes, belatedly, that not only is he holding the Elder Wand, but he is also wearing both the Peverell ring and the Invisibility Cloak.</p><p>She looks at her own versions of the Hallows, the way they beckon to her to hold them, wear them.</p><p>She says nothing.</p><p>What can you say after being told you might be a god of death?</p><p> </p>

  <em> +1) heal this broken picture </em>
</p><p>“And is this the first time you’ve seen a human?” Luna asks, notebook and quill floating at her side, transcribing the exchange and taking other notes of the interview in progress. She is surrounded on all sides by dog like creatures--ninken is the term they self identify with, she’s been told--but most of them only nose at her curiously, tails wagging, or loll about hopefully within petting reach.</p><p>Pakkun--one of the smallest ninken, but likely the most respected given his easy claim to the place of honor that is Luna’s lap--snorts. “No, I’ve seen plenty of humans before. I’m contracted to the Hokage, you know,” he says. Luna, in fact, does not know what a Hokage is, but she doesn’t want to interrupt, “But this is the first time I’ve seen one here without a reverse summoning.”</p><p>He presses his snout to her belly, sniffing deeply. Luna’s a professional, so she refrains from laughing no matter how ticklish it is--she doesn’t want to insult anyone.</p><p>“You don’t smell like one of ours, but you also don’t smell like any of the other clans,” Pakkun decides--other clans of ninken, perhaps? Or is that how the ninken refer to other creatures who live nearby. “How’d you get here if you didn’t reverse summon yourself?”</p><p>Luna shakes her head solemnly, “Apologies, I don’t know what that means. Could you explain what reverse summon is?”</p><p>Before she finishes asking, some of the ninken--Pakkun included--prick up their ears as if hearing some other sound that Luna cannot. That makes sense, she only has human hearing.</p><p>“I’ve gotta cut this short,” Pakkun says, even as one by one, some of his fellows disappear in puffs of smoke, “But if you want to know what summoning is, you can tag along.”</p><p>“If you don’t mind,” Luna says, letting Pakkun jump off her lap before getting to her feet. It’s an honor to be included in their customs so quickly, but she doesn’t want to be caught off guard.</p><p>“It might be a dangerous situation, but more likely Kakashi’s just trying to avoid paperwork again,” he says. Luna stashes her quill and notebook away just as Pakkun presses a tiny, gentle paw to the top of her foot.</p><p>Then, in a puff of smoke and a strange tugging sensation not unlike disapparating, she and Pakkun disappear…</p><p>… and reappear in some kind of office. Luna has a moment to register that, the presence of the ninken that had poofed before her, and a tall, lanky man in white robes, black face mask, and a strange pointed hat, before she is surrounded and yanked away by three figures in black robes and white masks.</p><p>The part of Luna that fought against Death Eaters years ago recoils at the similarities, reaches for her wand. But the other part of her--the part that has grown up and traveled the world and met all sorts of new and fascinating beings--carefully shows her empty hands, palms out, in peace.</p><p>“Hey, don’t do that. She’s my guest,” Pakkun’s low voice calls out, drawing closer as he weaves his way around the legs of the black robed figures and sits at her feet. “You really think I’d bring a threat to Kakashi?” The figures relax, the one with a grip on her upper arm lets go, and they back away with silent half bows as if in apology. Probably to Pakkun, but Luna accepts it anyway.</p><p>“A guest?” The man in white asks, crouched down amongst the rest of the ninken who are all greeting him with overly enthusiastic head butts and soggy kisses, before wandering off and giving the same greeting to the figures in black. Now that she examines them closer, they’re not that similar to Death Eaters at all, the masks painted in red, reminiscent of animals.</p><p>“Found her in the summon realm,” Pakkun explains, trotting back to the man in white--Kakashi, perhaps?--to claim his own pets now that he’s determined she’s safe, “Somehow got there without reverse summoning, doesn’t smell like any clan in particular so I’m inclined to believe her.” Then, to her, she introduces, “This is my human, Kakashi. He’s somehow Hokage, so if you need help getting back to where you’re from, he’ll probably make someone else do it.”</p><p>“How did you get to the summon realm without reverse summoning?” asks one of the black robed figures, the one whose mask has a wide open mouth.</p><p>“Mostly walking,” Luna answers easily. She doesn’t include the fact that she was walking through the magical parts of the Valdivian rainforest in Chile, stepped between two trees, and ended up in a completely different forest where she found dog like creatures capable of speaking language, with that language being Japanese. She has long ago learned to accept and adapt to the strangest situations.</p><p>“Luna Lovegood, magizoologist,” she introduces herself, “Pleasure to meet you all.”</p>
