    <p>The air thrummed with anticipation. </p>
<p>Something important was going to happen today. </p>
<p>Whether it was something good or something bad, had yet to be seen.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Shadows had been near vibrating with their anticipation the night before. Had it not been for the near constant state of exhaustion that he lived in, Harry doubted it would have been possible for him to fall asleep.</p>
<p>As rested as he ever came to be, Harry climbed out of his cupboard on soft and silent footsteps. He even managed not to hiss in pain as he set off towards the kitchen. Just as he was beginning to cook the bacon- <em>head swimming with the squeals of terror as he lived the pig's final moments</em>- his token-aunt came down. </p>
<p>Petunia scowled as she caught sight of him, muttering about Devil children and such. Why the woman found it so disturbing that Harry was awake before her, he had no clue.</p>
<p>Though perhaps it had more to do with Harry being able to open his cupboard? There were a lot of locks on it…</p>
<p>Whatever the case, he had long since stopped caring what his relatives said. Half the time he couldn’t even hear them over the Shadows. </p>
<p>His friends could be quiet for hours at a time, before suddenly rising into a near deafening crescendo that made him incapable of discerning anything else. They were always there with him, watching and whispering. A guiding force in his life that had never steered him wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps he should question what they didn’t want him to hear, but as a child he had done such once. He did not wish to go through what had happened after again. He was sure it would break him.</p>
<p>By the time Dudley and his token-aunt’s chosen came down; the oily, fat-filled slop that they considered breakfast was ready to be served. Harry had barely placed the final plate down when Dudley shoved him out of the way with a glee filled laugh. </p>
<p>The pain as his head hit the wall had him seeing stars, even though his Magick was already healing the contusion that had barely begun forming and now never would.</p>
<p>Pulling himself up, Harry slipped from the room as softly as a summers breeze and moved towards the front door. He reached it just as the postman did.</p>
<p>Picking up the post from the floor, flashes passed through his mind as the brief memories attached to the letters flickered and died. Each leaving mostly useless information in Harry’s increasingly frazzled mind.</p>
<p>He always hated picking up the post. Most of the people who wrote to his relatives were either incredibly dull, or just as vile as they were.</p>
<p>It was only as his hand brushed against the last letter that Harry stilled. His mind exploding with the rich history that was attached to the thick parchment.</p>
<p>A castle steeped in <strong><em>Magick</em></strong>, Ghosts, Alchemy, Charms, <em>Hufflepuff</em>, quills, Divination, laughter, fear, a talking Hat, Potions, <strong><em>MagICk</em></strong>, Astronomy, celebrations, forbidden forest, Herbology, <em>Gryffindor</em>, Unicorns, Transfiguration, gleeful squeals, <em><strong>MaGIcK</strong></em>, school children running through hallways, Defence, Quidditch, brooms, fields, acromantulas, <strong><em>MAGicK</em></strong>, Power, <em>Slytherin</em>, Monsters, Snake-Basilisk, terror, joy, <em>Ravenclaw</em>, Goblins, <em><strong>MAGICK!</strong></em></p>
<p>After what felt like a Millenia but was less than a second, Harry was able to focus again and read the letter that he quickly realised was addressed to him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Mr. H. J. Potter,</em><br/>
<em>The Cupboard Under the Stairs,</em><br/>
<em>4 Private Drive,</em><br/>
<em>Little Winging,</em><br/>
<em>Surrey.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, it had arrived.</p>
<p>For a second, an ever so small second, Harry debated whether or not to hide the letter. Should he allow his not-aunt and her family to see this? His instincts said yes but logic said that doing so would be all but asking to be punished. He might not be able to see how she would react to his letter, but he knew it would almost certainly be worse than her reaction to his mothers.</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>- <em>“Freak! You’re a Freak! I’m going to tell Mummy and Daddy on you Lily! You’re a Freak and you can’t even hide it now!”</em> -</p>
<p>
  <em></em>
</p>
<p>But then the Shadows, obviously sensing his indecision crooned in his ears <strong>“do not hide it Little Treasure. Whilst it will cause pain in the short term, this route is the one that will work best in the long run. Trust in us, if not in yourself.”</strong></p>
<p>The decision made, Harry made his way back to the kitchen. Wordlessly he passed all of the letters to Petunia. Acting for all to see as if he had not looked at them and did not know who they were addressed to.</p>
<p>So quickly did Harry flee from the presence of those titled aunt and uncle, that he did not see the flicker of Shadows that broke from him in order to partially obscure his address on the letter.</p>
<p>It was unlikely to work, but if who’ve went to check on why their Little Treasure was not answering their letters saw where it was addressed? They might, just might try to get him somewhere safer. It was unlikely though, considering just <strong>who</strong> had left him here all those years ago, but they had to try.</p>
<p>“Vernon!” shrieked the harpy like woman. “it came! Those freaks-” cutting off sharply, Petunia eyed both Harry and Dudley suspiciously.</p>
<p>Recognising the look in her eyes as nothing good, Harry quickly left the room. It wasn’t like he was expecting to get breakfast anyway. at least, not from them. The Shadows would sometimes bring him food. It was often times strange -<em>tasting like sunlight and laughter, with a sprinkling of tears and sorrow</em>- and unlike any that a regular human might eat. But then, he wasn’t truly human, was he?</p>
<p>Less than a moment later a screaming, red faced Dudley was thrown out of the kitchen as the so-called adults began a heated argument that would have dissolved into a screaming match were they not so fearful of what ‘<em>the neighbours might think!</em>’</p>
