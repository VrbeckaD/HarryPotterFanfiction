    <p>The night was heavy with foreboding.</p><p>Screams rent the silence as an army of Death Eaters stormed the Ministry strongholds. The wizards were cloaked in dark robes, their eerie, bone-white masks gleaming in the pale moonlight. Panicked Ministry personnel erected flimsy barricades and desperately attempted to procure an exit, but they were helpless in the face of the formidable Death Eaters. In mere moments, the Death Eaters tore through the Ministry wards with sheer, brute magical force.</p><p>They slipped through the faltering protective spells and unleashed their full fury upon the besieged Ministry. Aurors and Hit Wizards responded with haste, matching the first wave of Death Eaters' attacks with their own. The night was lit with flashes of lethal curses, both sides whirling as they dodged and struck.</p><p>Bodies fell as ruthless Death Eaters advanced past the Ministry's pitiful defenses. They spread through the building, taking captive any and all wizards in their sight. To their credit, they kept the killing to a minimum. Lord Voldemort was known for his respect for all magical blood, and he did not appreciate unnecessary deaths. And though the Death Eaters' leader had not yet arrived, the might of Voldemort's men alone was sufficient to bring the Ministry to its knees.</p><p>Meanwhile, Minister Harold Balium and his closest guards were frantically fumbling in the Minister's hidden office, trying to activate the getaway sequence. The Death Eaters had placed the strongest anti-escape and anti-apparition wards, and even the getaway tunnel in the office was refusing to open.</p><p>From the corridor outside their office, they heard the mad cackle of the infamous Bellatrix Black. Black, who was Lord Voldemort's right hand duelist, was as ruthless as he and far more insane.</p><p>She sauntered lazily towards the concealed doors to the Minister's office, all the while singing a twisted nursery rhyme under her breath. Finally, they heard the click of her heels stop as she paused outside the office.</p><p>"Is the Minister here? Is he hiding? What a naughty boy!" She tsked. From the other side of the door, the Minister's guards already in protective formation as they braced for Black.</p><p>"Dear, dear. It's a good thing for our Minister that I do… <em>enjoy</em> such games." She said cruelly, a mad smile contorting her crimson lips. "I suppose we'll just have to play hide and seek!"</p><p>Without warning, the room was blasted open in an explosion of plaster and wood. Minister Balium frantically redoubled his efforts to open the tunnel, and Bellatrix laughed delightedly at the sight of the man's fruitless attempts. She began to duel the guards, and because the Minister's men were top Aurors, they were able to hold their own against Black, albeit just barely. Balium considered escaping while Black was distracted, but the vicious glint in her eye dissuaded him.</p><p>Just then, the shattered Ministry wards groaned as a new surge of impossibly powerful, intoxicating magic pushed through. Balium almost collapsed. There was only one person who had such a strong aura, and he knew that the man's appearance spelled the definite end. For, now that Voldemort was here, all was lost.</p><p>Lord Voldemort materialized to the side of Black, taking in the scene with a cold expression in his bloodred eyes, his breathtakingly handsome countenance devoid of all emotion. A single, dark lock slipped to the side of his alabaster-fair visage.</p><p>"M-my l-lord." Balium gasped, his heart constricting in palpitating terror.</p><p>Without even glancing at the man, Lord Voldemort flicked his wrist and instantly, Balium and his men were sprawled across the floor, dead before they even fell. Another swipe of his hand wandlessly sent sparks into the night sky for all to see. His mark of the snake and the skull glittered emerald in the darkness, signaling that it was over.</p><p>"You have triumphed, my Lord." Bella breathed, kneeling before her mighty master.</p><p>"Yes, Bellatrix. You have done well." He deigned notice of his best lieutenant. "Stand, and attend to the rest of the situation." </p><p>Bellatrix knew what her Lord wanted her to do. She strode into the Atrium, where the captives were being held and the majority of the Death Eaters were stationed.</p><p>"The Ministry has fallen." She shouted gleefully, the Death Eaters holding their heads high in dignified pride. "Now, we finish this." </p><p>With Lucius by her side, Bellatrix and a legion of forty Death Eaters apparated into Godric's Hollow. The Order headquarters shimmered into visibility as their Ministry-enhanced enchantments fell, and Death Eaters surrounded the premises and enacted their strongest containment wards to prevent escape.</p><p>Inside the headquarters, members of the Order of the Phoenix were terrified but trying to make the most of what very well may be their last moments. Friends murmured words of reassurance and comfort. Lovers held on tightly to their partners, whispering softly and tracing their soulmarks to commemorate their destined love and brace for their inevitable tragic end. The few children present were crying, sensing the unease and hopelessness of their parents.</p><p>And yet, there was still hope. They rushed towards the back pantry of the house, where there was an escape apparition point to a safehouse in Italy. However, it didn't seem to be working, and a sense of dread settled as they realized the Death Eaters had placed trapping wards on the house. They looked towards their leader for a solution, a way out, and Albus Dumbledore knew he could not disappoint.</p><p>"My good friends, we have roughly ten minutes before our wards break." He began gravely, and a fearful hush settled over the amassed Order members. "You have all done well in this fight. We have persisted in the face of darkness, refusing to succumb to evil. We have maintained our honor as we bravely maintain what we hold dear. And above all, we have always fought for what is right.</p><p>So, it is with utmost determination and urgency that I ask you to listen closely to my next words. Yes, the escape route has been temporarily blocked by the Death Eaters. However, once they break our protective enchantments, their wards will be weakened as well by the magical backlash. I require our team of warders to begin dissembling their wards the moment they enter the headquarters. Once their wards are down, the escape route will function again. I will hold them off and join you. Enter the back rooms for preparation. Remember, we will not fall. We will fight on."</p><p>The moment Albus finished speaking, the Order immediately set about following his orders. Once Albus saw that preparations were complete, Albus knew he had one last task to complete.</p><p>"We have little time, so I will be direct. Leave Harry behind." He said quietly.</p><p>Lily's eyes were wide open in shock and horror. "A-Albus, why?"</p><p>"I do not have the time to explain." Dumbledore said, his voice sorrowful.</p><p>"He is our <em>son</em>!" James cried. He reached out for his wife, allowing his magic to envelop her soulmark in a token of comfort. Lily stifled a sob and sank into James' arms.</p><p>"James, being on the run is no place for a child. He will be safe, I promise it." Dumbledore reassured him.</p><p>"But our baby boy!" Lily pleaded, tears in her eyes.</p><p>"He will be in more danger in hiding. Here, however, he will be alive." Dumbledore said softly. Of course, there was a much larger reason why he wanted to leave Harry behind, but he couldn't tell them. Matters of prophecies were sensitive, and he would certainly not disclose what he knew about Harry, Voldemort, and the Order until later.</p><p>"Voldemort will kill Harry!" Sirius exclaimed, distraught. "I can't allow that to happen."</p><p>Dumbledore closed his eyes in anguish. He was separating a baby boy from his parents, and the thought of it weighed heavily upon his old chest. "Harry will be safe. Voldemort does not kill magical children unless he has to. Trust me and accept that doing this will benefit Harry and the greater good. I beg you to trust me, <em>please</em>." He said emphatically.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, their resolve crumbled and the tears fell freely. Lily and James kissed Harry, words of love falling from their lips. Lily conjured a silken handkerchief and used her wand to embroider words upon it with green thread the color of Harry's eyes. Sirius placed a paw on it when she was finished, leaving an imprint of his Padfoot self. James hugged Harry tight one last time before returning him to Lily, who swaddled Harry in a thick quilt and placed the handkerchief under it. She then cast strong wards around Harry and hid him in Dumbledore's office.</p><p>Right as she finished, the wards buckled and Death Eaters flooded the headquarters. The Order's wardbreakers worked feverishly and were able to take down the Death Eaters' wards in a few minutes. Albus breathed a sigh of relief as he saw the Order members disappear from the house through the exit channel, Lily, James, and Sirius with them. Casting a final barricading spell, he too disapparated for the Italy safe house.</p><p>Bellatrix screamed in fury, her wand slashing through the air and incinerating the floor where Dumbledore had been standing moments before. She strode through the mangled doors, blasting everything in her path as she killed the remaining Order members.</p><p>From the number of bodies on the ground, she estimated that even still about half of the Order members were able to escape. As a precaution, however, she cast a spell to detect if there were any living beings remaining in the destroyed Order headquarters. To her great surprise, there was a single life force that appeared to be located upstairs. Bellatrix ordered the Death Eaters to remain where they were, not telling them what she had detected.</p><p>She was in Dumbledore's abandoned office, and a thorough inspection revealed that there was indeed a life force present. It was a boy, who looked to be about one year old. He was bundled in a thick quilt and his eyes closed. Bellatrix stared at the tiny child before shrugging and dismantling the protective enchantments around him.</p><p>Just as she was about to kill the boy, his eyelids fluttered open. Bellatrix was almost startled by the intensity of the bright green eyes peering up at her.</p><p>She pulled on her most ferocious expression and leered at the boy, intending to have some fun before casting the Avada Kedavra. To her great astonishment, the boy only tilted his head to the side and began to giggle. He ceased his childish laughter just long enough to try arranging his impish features into a mimicry of hers. </p><p>Bellatrix was delighted. "Aren't you a funny little one." She crooned, leaning close, her thick curls brushing against the boy's own, equally dark locks.</p><p>"Pretty." The boy gurgled without a lisp, reaching out with a chubby fist to grasp Bellatrix's hair.</p><p>"You dare touch me?" She hissed, hiding her amusement. When the boy began to laugh again, she idly wondered if she should continuing playing with the boy before killing him, or if she should spare him for his worth as a plaything.</p><p>"Lady is not scary." The boy said defiantly, far more coherent than any other toddler Bellatrix had met.</p><p>"Oh, you don't find me intimidating?" Bellatrix whispered delightedly. "Even when I do this?" She lunged forward with her hands in claws, eyes alight with malice.</p><p>The boy blinked at her, taken aback for only the briefest of moments before giggling again. "Lady is funny." He poked her.</p><p>Bellatrix considered killing the boy for fun, but decided against it in a fit of boredom. She yanked the quilt off the boy, a snow-white handkerchief falling out. It was embroidered with green thread to form the words, "Fight on, Harry James Potter". There was an inky pawprint of what was probably a dog to the side.</p><p>"So you're an itty bitty Potter." She said gleefully, looking at the boy again. "How odd. I didn't think your mummy and dada would abandon you."</p><p>Potter frowned. "Not itty bitty." He jutted his chin out, looking as pouty as a one-year-old could.</p><p>"You don't talk like an itty bitty boy," Bellatrix conceded, "What should I do with you? Shall we play little bit more?"</p><p>"Like playing." Potter affirmed, nodding his head with adorable seriousness.</p><p>Bellatrix mused over what she should do with Potter. "I suppose you can live for now, baby Potter."</p><p>Pocketing the handkerchief for the moment, she took the boy and disapparated to the Ministry Atrium. They had begun collecting newly orphaned magical children off to the side, intending to place them in orphanages. She ungracefuly thrust the boy into the mix before striding away.</p><p>Lucius apparated right behind her, walking towards their Lord.</p><p>"My Lord, we have killed half of the Order." He began hesitantly.</p><p>"And?" Voldemort prompted, his voice deadly quiet.</p><p>"A-and the rest of them escaped." Lucius finished, cringing.</p><p>Voldemort gritted his teeth, his flawlessly handsome features twisting in disdain. "You incompetent fools." </p><p>"Please, my Lord!" Lucius said hastily. "We avoided killing when we could, but we taught the Order a lesson. Their headquarters have been thoroughly decimated, and their members are now fewer than twenty. Mulciber and his crew are already inspecting their getaway chamber for traces of magic that could indicate their new location."</p><p>Voldemort remained incensed, but calmed slightly. "How did they escape?"</p><p>"Their team of wardbreakers attacked our anti-escape wards while our warders were distracted." Lucius said shakily, his head still pressed to the floor in his kneeling position.</p><p>Hissing with displeasure, Voldemort pointed his wand at Lucius. "And who were the warders that managed to be defeated by a cornered group of meagre Order wardbreakers?"</p><p>"D-Dolohov, Goyle, Crabbe, and Mulciber." Lucius managed.</p><p>Voldemort's lip curled. "I am most displeased. However, you have done well otherwise. I will not punish you further." </p><p>Without a second glance, he swept out of the room to finish his preparations. They would announce the new regime, rebuild the Ministry, seize Hogwarts, and set up orphanages for muggle-borns and homeless magical children. He would not waste his time with the failings of his followers, but move on.</p><p>The sun would rise to a new world.</p>
