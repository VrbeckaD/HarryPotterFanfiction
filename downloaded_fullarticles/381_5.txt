    <p>
  <span>Headmaster of Hogwarts Minerva McGonagall sat behind her desk with fingers interlaced, her mouth pinched and her eyebrows knit together. The expression of deep disapproval was painfully familiar to the two students sitting across from her. The shorter and darker of the two boys looked up nervously, his eyes landing on the newest and largest painting mounted on the wall, behind McGonagall’s desk. Albus Dumbledore winked down at him from the comfort of his portrait, half moon spectacles glinting merrily.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You two,” she began, her voice stern even as her expression softened. In years past she would have been more angry and more shrill, but after all that had happened, the travesty the three of them had lived through, this was a welcome change. “You two just cannot keep clear of each other, can you? I would imagine after all your...history, you could put this feud behind you. You’re eighth years after all, and already prominent young wizards. You are both destined for the Ministry, I’m sure, where it will be impossible to avoid one another. I think it’s time you two got along.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy’s blonde head swiveled to his left, his chilly gaze assessing Potter with a derisive snort. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not likely,” he muttered. A fresh trickle of blood dribbled from his nose over his lips. Harry tried to hide his smug grin as McGonagall retrieved a fresh handkerchief from a drawer and handed it to Malfoy. The Slytherin took it between slender fingers and gingerly pressed it to his face to absorb the blood. He refused to give the Gryffindor the satisfaction of even a glance.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That you two got into a brawl before you even left the train does not bode well for the rest of the term. It sets a terrible example for the younger students and reflects poorly on your respective houses. Frankly, I’ve had enough.” McGonagall stared down her nose at Harry in particular, though she spared some of her frostiness for Malfoy to be sure. She expected a much higher level of maturity from the savior of the magical world and he knew it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boys made brief, almost involuntary eye contact with one another and looked away sheepishly. They both had to admit that she was right. After everything that they had endured- Harry’s rescue of Draco from the Fiendfyre in the Room of Hidden Things, Draco’s baffling choice to protect Harry’s identity at Malfoy Manor, Narcissa’s lie to save them both in the Forbidden Forest- their fiery hatred had ebbed away, replaced by a dull but sturdy mistrust. They certainly weren’t friends but the last year had taught them what it meant to really have a sworn enemy and enemies they were not.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All the rotten things they’d done to each other- Malfoy knew he was guilty of the most heinous of them- seemed trivial in the wake of the harrowing battle they’d been forced to fight. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In another lifetime, Malfoy wondered if they could’ve been friends. He’d certainly tried, all those years ago, holding his hand out proudly only to have Harry rebuff him. Sure, he’d been a pompous arse, but he didn’t know that at the time. The searing pain of that public embarrassment had likely sparked their incendiary rivalry. Malfoy had been punishing Harry for that rejection ever since.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, Professor. It won’t happen again,” Harry said, hoping to convey a satisfactory level of contrition. He didn’t intend to revisit the incident but hitting Malfoy <em>had</em> felt good. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It certainly won’t. It is my intention to end this rivalry for good before the year is through. Starting next week you will serve two months of detention together under the supervision of our caretaker, Mr. Filch, with whom you should be well acquainted.” She spoke with an air of finality and Harry knew better than to challenge her, but he couldn’t stop the groan that spilled out of him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Two months? Are you sure that’s necessary?” Malfoy croaked. Harry would have laughed at the blonde's misfortune if they weren’t sharing it. “Don’t they say that familiarity breeds contempt?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mr. Malfoy, has it occurred to you that you are not in a position to bargain with me?” Her voice and gaze were icy and the Slytherin boy quelled beneath her stare. “You will serve detention together over the course of the next eight weeks and you will resolve your differences.” Her tone brooked no argument. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The boys were dismissed to join the other students in the Great Hall for the end of dinner. They slunk silently out of the office and made the awkward trip together. Harry was glad he wasn’t going to miss the feast entirely, but he was a bit sad to have missed the Sorting. It was a nice tradition, something he looked forward to at the beginning of each year, but especially after the war. He could remember the devastation the final battle had wrought on parts of the castle and was thankful the school had survived for him to return to at all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’ve missed the Sorting,” Harry said, mostly to break the ice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s right. Bit of a shame, really. I like to watch,” Malfoy said, surprisingly pleasantly. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I do, too. All the little first years are so awestruck,” Harry laughed. “It’s nice to see.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, well,” Malfoy sniffed. He felt things were suddenly too convivial. It wouldn’t do to appear too eager, even if Potter did have a winsome smile. “I’d have liked to see who the new Slytherins are. Make sure they pass muster.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The best of the bunch went to Gryffindor, I’m sure,” Harry replied wryly. They paused outside of the heavy doors, preparing for their delayed entrance that was sure to spark conversation. They both took a steadying breath and shared a nervous smile, something they had never had reason to do before. Finally, Harry opened the door and ushered Malfoy through. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The hall was resplendent, as usual, filled with banners in the house colors and the warm, enticing aroma of delicious food. The enchanted sky above their heads was inky blue and laced with stars. The sight of it made Harry’s chest swell with warmth. It was so good to be back. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That at least half of the students were unabashedly staring and whispering to each other behind their hands was not lost on either boy. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Make nice, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Draco told himself. He turned toward Harry, cleared his throat and stuck out his hand. Harry was mildly startled, but managed to smooth his expression and take Malfoy’s hand in his own to shake. It was just a bit softer than his and pleasantly cool. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right then,” Malfoy said, when the shaking had gone on a moment too long. The unusual contact with the other boy’s lightly calloused hand was making his stomach feel funny. “I’ll see you ‘round.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You will.” Harry held his eyes for a beat before turning toward the Gryffindor table. Unnerved by this strange truce they’d struck, Malfoy slid distractedly into the spot Blaise and Pansy had saved for him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What was that about?” Ron asked around a mouthful of roast potatoes, one ginger eyebrow cocked. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you shake hands with Malfoy in my life.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t choke, Ron,” Hermione chastised with a slight grimace. She turned to Harry, a keen interest alight in her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re on strict orders from Professor McGonagall to ‘put aside our differences’,” Harry told them, loading up his plate. Ron snorted derisively. “We’ve got two months of detention together so we’d better get used to one another.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, Harry, that’s awful!” Hermione exclaimed. “You’re bound to fall behind on your homework.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Or be cursed by Malfoy,” Ron protested, and Harry couldn’t help laughing. The whole scenario was so ridiculous that it hadn’t even sunk in. Harry had served detentions before. He couldn’t imagine a few hours toiling alongside Malfoy could be any worse than what Umbridge had put him through. In fact, the little flip flop his stomach did when he thought about spending his evenings with Malfoy made him wonder if he wasn’t a bit excited. He did like a challenge.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’ll be alright,” he replied, only half certain. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron and Hermione filled him in on what he’d missed. They pointed out a few of the first years who’d joined the Gryffindors, as if their beaming faces and short statures weren’t enough to identify them. Slughorn, who had made opening remarks in McGonagall’s stead, had apparently referred to the students who’d returned for an eighth year as the Veteran Class. It was a strange word to hear, but it was accurate. Many of them had fought and lived through the battle not so many months ago. It would take some getting used to. The common room situation, which had been briefly addressed in their school letters, was explained further.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>First through seventh years would live in their respective house dormitories as usual. The overflow group from the returning veteran class would be living together, in a part of the castle that had been repurposed to house them. Together, the returning students from the various houses made up about one house worth in numbers. Living and sleeping would be more comfortable this way, they were assured. Any points earned or lost by individuals would still be reflected in their house tallies.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Malfoy realized what this meant. All the students in his year would be sharing space, mixing as they studied and slept. He’d have to rub elbows with the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hufflepuffs </span>
  </em>
  <span>for Merlin’s sake. His stomach waffled as he considered that he might be sharing a dormitory and bathroom with Potter. That made him more nervous than anything else. He would have nowhere to retreat to now.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d come up with the Slytherin boys: he was used to showering near them on occasion, when he didn’t get to the showers before everyone else had woken. They knew that he liked to be left in peace while he carried out his meticulous grooming. They hardly ever snuck a peek at him anymore, and carefully avoided a confrontation if they noticed him eyeing them. It was a delicate balance cultivated over seven years. Now he would be surrounded by a crop of new people whose bodies and habits he would have to familiarize himself with. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He might have to shower near Potter. The thought excited him far more than it should have. He could feel the burn of shame deep in his belly, a familiar companion.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry felt the peculiar sensation of being watched periodically throughout the remainder of dinner and dessert. He thought it might be Professor McGonagall eyeing him from her perch at the faculty table, but when he looked up she was engaged in discussion with Professor Binns. Harry spooned a bit of treacle tart into his mouth as he casually cast his eyes about the room. When he passed over the Slytherin table, he caught Malfoy out. His silver gray eyes were the ones that had been locked on Harry. When the other boy realized that Potter had noticed him, he blanched and ducked his head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Could you be more brazen? Stop being weird, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Malfoy told himself. Still, when the plates were cleared a few moments later and the students stood and filtered out of the hall, he couldn’t stop himself from picking Harry out of the crowd. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm as they exited, pulling him out of the stream of students. She led him to a corner just next to the doors.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What were you two even fighting about?” she asked in a hoarse whisper, hoping not to be overheard by the students passing them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t even remember. He was being a wanker, obviously trying to provoke me…” Harry gingerly probed his swollen lip with his fingertips. “He just makes me insane. I can’t control myself when it comes to Malfoy.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>That’s for sure, </span>
  </em>
  <span>she thought to herself as the pale blonde in question strode out of the doors behind Harry. She thought she saw the corner of his mouth quirk up and wondered if he’d overheard them. He had always loved to get a rise out of Harry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You don’t have to fight anymore, Harry. The war’s over.” She reached out and squeezed his arm reassuringly. “Maybe you and Malfoy can turn things around this year.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s exactly what McGonagall said,” he grumbled. Hermione and McGonagall were two of the smartest witches he knew. Perhaps they had a fair point. He wasn’t keen on being humiliated by Malfoy’s rejection but he knew he at least had to try. “We’ll see.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When they’d gone up to the eighth year common room, Harry begged off immediately and went up to the empty bedroom. He wanted to savor his return to Hogwarts in private for a moment, before the room was flooded with boisterous voices. Everything had moved so fast since he’d arrived at the castle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He slowly readied himself for bed, his mind eventually- inevitably- drifting to the notorious Slytherin with whom he shared a disciplinary fate. He knew that the other students were already gossiping about it, speculating about what would happen. He knew that they probably expected more fighting, perhaps even a duel. If they’d heard the conversation that had taken place in the headmistress’s office they’d have been sorely disappointed. The truth was that Harry was more than ready to bury the hatchet.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After the battle had ended Harry had spent a lot of time alone at Grimmauld Place, mourning the loss of many friends and processing the arduous journey of the last year. He’d picked apart details that he’d never expected to remember. As it happened, his memory had served him well. The Wizengamot convened every day that summer to preside over the myriad trials that had been set as a result of the war. Harry, having been a central figure of the final battle and having known more than most thanks to his mental link with Voldemort and his close relationship with Dumbledore, had been summoned as a witness to many of them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was no secret that Harry disliked Malfoy but he wasn’t going to lie, especially not if it meant sending Malfoy to Azkaban. Harry had told the absolute truth, sitting tall in the straight backed chairs of the cool, dreary court chambers. If it had ultimately been his testimony that had cleared the younger Malfoy’s name, Harry supposed that was alright with him. After all, aside from being an absolute shit, there wasn’t much Harry could really think of to blame him for. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After testifying on behalf of Malfoy’s innocence in the death of Vincent Crabbe, testifying that he had not been the one to cast the killing curse against Dumbledore in the clock tower, testifying that Narcissa had helped Harry defeat Voldemort by lying for him in the Forbidden Forest, Harry had realized that Malfoy had had about as much choice in his role as Harry had in his. He had done nasty things and behaved like a coward at times, but Harry recognized that Malfoy had been terrified of and beholden to Voldemort in a way Harry would never understand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Voldemort had made plans for Draco, plans that would succeed or result in Draco’s death. Sharing a home with Voldemort and living under his thumb would have been intolerable. To defy him in any way would be a death sentence, not just for Draco but for his family as well. Beyond that, Malfoy had always admired his father, done as he was told. How could he have seen the path that Lucius was setting him on until it was too late? After all, Harry had never really had a family until the Weasleys came along. He could never imagine forsaking them. How could he expect Malfoy, raised on cruelty, to leave that life when it was all he had ever known? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was one of many things Harry had turned over in his mind on the nights that sleep eluded him- and there had been many of those. Harry’s hatred of Malfoy had burned away months ago. In a strange way, Harry could almost empathize with the other boy, could see how he’d behaved much like an animal backed into a corner might. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He pulled a book from his trunk and dropped it onto the bed, climbing in after it. It was early yet but the peace and quiet was just what he wanted. His eyes rested thoughtfully on Malfoy’s empty bed for a moment before he pulled the drapes shut on his four poster. He might not trust Malfoy now, or ever, but he was fairly certain he could forgive him.</span>
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d switch with you if I could,” Pansy offered mirthfully from the corner she shared with Malfoy and Blaise Zabini in the new common room. “He may be a goody two shoes but he’s lovely to look at.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You slag,” Blaise teased. Malfoy eyed the other students in the room warily, hoping they weren’t being overheard. He wasn’t used to the acoustics in the new room yet, though there was more sound absorbing cushy furniture here than in the dungeons and the fire crackled loudly in the hearth. It was an altogether more welcoming space than he was used to. Dryer, too. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll be sure to give Potter your regards,” he said coolly, turning back to his friends.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Please do. I can give that Ginny a run for her money,” Pansy bragged, tossing her glossy raven hair over one shoulder and pouting. Draco couldn’t help laughing at Pansy’s exaggerated- and warranted- vanity. He couldn’t deny that she’d grown into her looks over the last few years. She was probably the most beautiful Slytherin girl in their year, but a Slytherin nonetheless. That Potter had never considered her in that way, Draco was almost certain. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s the world coming to? You befriending Potter and Pansy jonesing for a ride on his broom,” Blaise did his best to look scandalized, making Pansy dissolve into a fit of giggles. Even Draco smirked. It was crazy, wasn’t it?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hours later Draco sat alone in the common room, his eyes beginning to itch with tiredness as he stared into the waning flames. He knew he ought to join the other boys in their dormitory, but he had avoided the room all night. He would be tired for classes the next day but he had wanted to wait a bit longer to be sure that he could sneak into bed unobserved. He recognized the churn of anxiety in his gut as he turned the same thoughts over in his head. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What if I’m next to Potter? What if he sees me undress? What if I see </span>
  </em>
  <span>him</span>
  <em>
    <span> undress? I’ll have to eventually. Oh god, what if I get an erection?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He knew that these things weren’t worth the stress he was creating for himself. They’d all been sharing rooms with other boys for ages and anything Harry might see was sure to be nothing new. He also knew, from past experience, that the only way out was through. He stood with a jaw cracking yawn and began to climb the stairs. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was relieved to find most of the boys asleep already, the dormitory lit only by soft moonglow through the leaded windows. Each of the four beds against the opposite wall was made with linens in the occupant’s house colors, resulting in a cheery if mismatched row of four posters. He spotted his own bed, the only one empty and unruffled, his trunk waiting at the foot. To the right, Blaise slumbered quietly on his back. It looked like Seamus Finnigan was on the left but in the dim light he couldn’t be entirely certain. At the end of the row, next to the door that led to the shared bathroom, the drawn curtains of the last bed glowed scarlet. Draco didn’t need to read the letters stenciled on the side of the trunk to know who it was that was still awake and, from the looks of it, reading by wand light. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He retrieved his pajamas as quietly as possible from his trunk. He removed his shoes and trousers and slid on the seersucker sleep bottoms, settling the waistband around his trim hips. He carefully unbuttoned his shirt and cuffs and laid it aside, tugging a well worn tshirt over his head. He made his way into the bathroom as quietly as possible, but he thought he heard the rustling of curtains as he passed Potter’s bed. He relieved himself, feeling a bit of the worry fading away as drowsiness overcame him. The first night in the new dorms was nearly behind him. He washed his hands and brushed his teeth quickly and tip toed back to his bed. The light in Harry’s bed had been extinguished but the curtains parted ever so slightly as Malfoy slipped under his covers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Night, Malfoy,” Harry mumbled sleepily. Malfoy’s body went rigid with surprise, unaccustomed to the husky sound of Potter’s drowsy voice in the dark. He turned on his side, facing the end of the row where the other boy slept.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good night, Potter,” he called softly, using his wand to draw the curtains around him before stashing it under his pillow. </span>
