    <p>Harry woke to the sound of Teddy banging on the bars of his crib. He wanted so badly to fall back asleep. Maybe when Teddy laid down for a nap, he thought. Then he looked at the time. It was almost 1pm. Harry jumped out of bed and ran over to Teddy. Harry was sleeping in Sirius’s old bedroom. Teddy’s crib was in the corner of the room. He liked having his godson close. </p><p>Teddy was soaked through his diaper. He smelled like urine. His cute little monkey sleeper was wet. But he still smiled and giggled when Harry took him into his arms. Harry immediately ran them both to the bathroom. He striped Teddy naked and climbed into the shower. He didn’t care that he was still clothed. He turned on the water. The cold shocked both of them at first making Teddy cry. Harry comforted the little boy but he couldn’t stop the tears that fell from his eyes. </p><p>Remus would be ashamed, he thought. He let his godson sit in urine for hours. Who knows how long he has tried to get him up. Harry stood patting Teddy on the back speaking comforting words into the boy’s ear. Something had to change. Only problem was Harry didn’t know what.</p><p>Once they were both dressed and Harry had breakfast going or lunch at this point, he decided that they would go to the park. Harry was living in Grimmauld place. He wanted to have his parents house rebuilt but right now he didn’t have the energy to do much. Everywhere he went people recognized him as a celebrity. He couldn’t even take Teddy to the doctor without people wanting to hound him with questions. Thankfully the Daily Prophet laid off. He was sure Hermione had something to do with that.  </p><p>Harry put on his best outfit to blend in with the muggles. Jeans, t-shirt and gym shoes, only problem was this was his everyday attire. He dressed Teddy in practically the same thing. Most people thought Teddy was his son and after the first few times of correcting them he decided to leave it be. As long as Teddy knows where he came from that's what matters.</p><p>Harry got Teddy’s pram ready. They left Grimmauld place and set out for the park down the street. It was less than a block away. Harry listened to the gibberish that Teddy was speaking as they walked. He pointed at things like birds and cars. Occasionally Harry would point at something for Teddy to see. </p><p>The park was empty to Harry's delight. Harry sat the pram to the side of the bench and got Teddy out. Teddy wanted down to play. Harry watched him run towards the sandbox. There was various shovels and buckets for him to entertain himself with. Harry cast an alert charm on Teddy to notify Harry if Teddy gets hurt. It was a warm spring day. The weather should hold up for a while. Harry decided to rest his eyes for a moment.</p><p>******hp</p><p>The rain fell gently on his face waking him up. Harry opened his eyes taking a moment to search his surroundings. He was in a park. He doesn't remember getting there. Then he remembered this morning. “TEDDY!” Harry cried out. He startled the parents around him that were packing up their children because of the rain. </p><p>“Oh god. Have you seen a little boy? He would be this big?” Harry made the gesture with his hands. “He has black hair and green eyes.” Teddy doesn't realize he does it but he takes on the appearance of the person he is around the most. The parents around him were almost afraid to answer because he was acting like an irate psychotic. </p><p>Harry gave up looking around the park. He left the pram and ran to Grimmauld. Once inside he cried in anguish. “Teddy please.” Harry wiped his eyes and walked over to the floo. He was going to go to the ministry. Anyone could be involved. The amount of hate mail that he used to receive, it could have been one of them or one of his fans hoping for a piece of him. That made him angry. </p><p>Harry turned on the floo but then heard a laugh and a woman’s voice. Harry jumped off the floor and ran to the voice. Hermione was in the kitchen feeding Teddy. Harry relaxed once he saw the bushy haired woman. Harry immediately hugged them both. Hermione had to calm herself before she spoke. </p><p>“Thank Merlin ‘Mione. I thought someone took him. I was beside myself.” Harry said. He was now wiping away happy tears. Hermione bit her lip but continued to feed Teddy until he was finished with his food. </p><p>Hermione cleaned up Teddy while Harry composed himself. This time there was barely any peas on her white blouse. She spent the whole time feeding Teddy trying to come up with the right things to tell Harry. Harry needs help. She let out a sigh after cleaning up the high chair. </p><p>“He manages to get more on his seat then in his mouth.” Harry said when he entered the kitchen. Hermione nodded. “Thanks for taking care of him. I must have just dozed for a second.” Harry said. Hermione scoffed. She glared at her friend. </p><p>“Want some tea?” Harry asked. Hermione stood there staring at him. She was debating on how to approach the subject. What she really wanted was to slap some sense into him. </p><p>“No. I want to talk.” Hermione said continuing to stare at Harry who found her intimidating suddenly. He looked away from her. </p><p>“Everything ok with Ron?” Harry asked. </p><p>“That's not what I want to talk about. Where is Teddy’s pram?” Hermione asked. Harry left it. He felt like shit for leaving it. Hermione knew the answer already.</p><p>“Do you know that I put a tracking charm on Teddy because of the time that crazy girl grabbed him and wanted to raise him thinking that would make her attractive to you? I used it to track him when I couldn't find either of you earlier. Do you know how despicable it is to find the parent of the child asleep? While the child plays alone in a public park? Harry, forgive my language, but what the holy fuck were you thinking?” Hermione took a deep breath. Harry looked pale. Hermione has never laid into him like this.</p><p>“I know that you are depressed Harry. You can't work because of the bloody public and Andromeda passing away leaving you with a child didn't help but Remus and Tonks knew you were responsible enough for this, for their Teddy, their son Harry.” Hermione was in tears. Harry was in tears now too. </p><p>“I wish Ron would get his head out of his ass. Ginny cheated on you. It's a bloody fucking fact no matter how Ginny tries to spin it. The fact is Harry you have a son, not a godson, he is your son to raise, you need to get on with your life otherwise Teddy will get taken away.” Hermione hated to say that. Harry looked up at her with fear in his eyes.</p><p>“I can't lose him. He is the only thing I have that's holding me together.” Harry admitted. Hermione walked over to Harry and wrapped him in a hug. He broke down crying on her.</p><p>“I think I have something that could work. Harry, I want you and Teddy to go away for a while. Luna has this Bed and Breakfast in New York that I think would help you.” Hermione said. </p><p>“But.” Harry started to say that his family was here but honestly they weren't. The only true family was Teddy. Everyone else was only there when it was convenient except for Hermione. Harry had a feeling she was his sister deep down. She always knew when he needed her.</p><p>“Luna said there is everything a wizard needs to relax and she mentioned that the child care there is impeccable. I know you wanted to raise Teddy completely on your own but there isn’t anything wrong with asking for help. And don't worry I've already arranged everything.” Hermione said. She grabbed her bag pulling out 2 plane tickets with passports and a muggle credit card.</p><p>“This is linked to your Gringotts account so it should never run out.” Hermione said handing the things over. Harry felt overwhelmed. “You'll be fine Harry. Do this Harry so you’ll be the father Teddy needs. And go find yourself in the meantime.” Hermione said kissing his forehead.</p><p>“Says you. How long are we staying there? And what in the bloody hell does go find myself mean?” Harry asked. </p><p>“As long is as needed. And you’ve never had time to be yourself Harry, at least not really. Go have fun for once.” Hermione threw her bag over her shoulder and headed toward the floo. She kissed Teddy on the cheek. “Be safe Teddy.” </p><p>“That sounds like something Luna would say to both parts.” Harry said. He picked up Teddy and followed Hermione. </p><p>“It’s because she did say it except for that last part. I’m allowed to say things like have fun! I have fun, I’ll have you know.” Hermione scowled at Harry. “Love you both. Floo me when you get there.” Hermione added.</p><p>“Love you too.” Harry said to the green flames. “Well Teddy, how about an adventure?” Teddy cooed. Harry kissed his raven hair. </p><p>*****hp</p><p>Harry was sure he forgot a hundred things by the time the plane landed in New York. Teddy enjoyed flying and slept through most of the flight. However Harry didn’t like flying. He loves flying on a broom of course but flying in a floating tube was not the same. Not to mention he didn’t like his and Teddy’s lives being at the hands of two pilots that he never met.</p><p>Harry was expecting to find Luna waiting for him and Teddy but instead found a man who was tall, bald and wore dark blue robes. “My name is Ora. I’m sorry Luna couldn’t make it. She is otherwise detained with the birth of the baby nifflers. We have been raising them.” Ora said. Harry nodded. Teddy was asleep in his arms. The kid could sleep anywhere. Thankfully he was because the airport was very busy. </p><p>“I’m Harry Potter.” Harry wanted to hold out his hand but couldn’t. Honestly Harry felt like he didn’t hold Teddy enough.<br/>
Ora smiled. It warmed Harry immediately. He must have some sort of empathic emotion manipulation, Harry thought because he didn’t find the guy attractive really. He had a unique beauty, much like Luna. They walked over to the luggage carousel.<br/>
“Luna has talked about nothing else since we heard of your arrival. I must confess I was starting to get a little jealous.” The man said. Harry noticed he had a tattoo of a crescent moon on the side of his head. Harry laughed. He would have to find out when Luna and Neville broke up.<br/>
“Luna is an amazing person. You have nothing to worry about.” Harry said. Teddy started to wake up now. Harry cast a featherweight charm on the boy so his squirming didn’t hurt his back.<br/>
“She really is. I’m very lucky. We are getting married this fall.” Ora said smiling.<br/>
“Oh wow. Congrats then.” Harry held out his hand to the man. Ora shook it. His skin felt very soft. Harry wondered if there was anything else unusual about this man.<br/>
“Thank you. Luna is my moon drop.” Ora said. He picked up Harry’s bags before Harry even spotted them. Then he realized that maybe Ora has a touch of what Luna has.   </p><p>It was dark outside when they sat in Ora’s car. Harry had no clue what make or model it was only that it was very small. Too small for a man that tall, but somehow Ora fit perfectly. Luna was nice enough to get a car seat for Teddy to sit in. “You might want to relax. You have a little ways before we get close to the Inn.” Ora said. Harry didn’t want to fall asleep yet but he found the urge overwhelming. Then his eyes slipped closed. </p><p>*****hp</p><p>Harry woke up with the sun shining through the curtains. He quickly jumped out of the bed. There was a playpen at the foot of his bed where Teddy was still asleep. “Thank Merlin.” Harry collapsed back in the bed. He doesn't remember arriving here. The room was large with a balcony. The bed was a king size bed. The room was swathed in colors of blues and green hues. The duvet was almost like sleeping with feathers.</p><p>Harry cast a quick tempest and found it was almost 9am. He felt completely rested for the first time in months, years. He thought that a shower sounded like a good idea. Harry checked on Teddy again before grabbing a change of clothes. He looked around and realized there wasn't a door to a bathroom in his room so he checked in the hall outside his room. </p><p>The woodworking throughout the Inn was incredible. Harry found various animals like unicorns, Phoenixes, and demiguises. They came alive in the woodworking when a person walked over them or near them. Harry spent 10 minutes playing hide and seek with a very frisky wampus cat. </p><p>Finally he found his way past a few doors with names etched in them. Brutus, Titus. Then another that says Moon Drop, Sun Beam and Wind Star. Harry was curious about that door. Then there was the one with a shower on the door with the animation of a man getting scalded by hot water. Harry found that hilarious. </p><p>Inside he never expected a bathroom to look like this. It was as if he stepped foot in the rainforest. There was a bin for his clothes to keep dry then he striped and continued the rest of the way in. There was a tree stump that was actually a toilet. Harry rolled his eyes at Luna. </p><p>Then Harry looked around. There were fresh green vines and moist ground under his feet. He wondered how he was supposed to actually get clean. There was a mist in the air. Then a knob lit up on the far right wall. </p><p>Harry looked at the knob for a moment. To the right it said “For a quick thorough wash.” To the left it said “For a relaxing leisurely wash.” Harry shook his head. He had no idea how much longer Teddy was going to sleep so he wanted a quick thorough cleaning. </p><p>Harry turned the knob but nothing happened. A moment later the room started to get windy. Then water came from all directions as if attacking him. Luckily Harry was prepared for the unprepared. He cast a quick bobblehead charm before the water became too much and he ended up going under. Then it was as if the water took on a life of its own. </p><p>Finally the tsunami finished and Harry stood hoping that was it. Unfortunately it was not. The warm wind swept through as if the sun beat down and wind swirl with it drying and warming him at the same time. Harry felt surprisingly relaxed afterwards despite the shock.</p><p>Harry left the bathroom after getting dressed. Next time he would only take a robe. He was afraid his clean clothes were damp from the bathroom atmosphere. Harry went to wake up Teddy. He would take Teddy with him downstairs to meet with Luna and Ora.</p><p>Luna was sitting on Ora’s lap when Harry found them in the outside around a large wooden table. “Come eat, Harry. We have plenty of food that Teddy can eat too.” Luna was nearly out of breath. Harry stared at her for a moment. He realized quickly that he was interrupting an intimate moment between Luna and Ora. He cast and muffliato on Teddy so he couldn't hear and he refused to watch though he knows a blush appeared on his cheeks. </p><p>When they finished Luna appeared in front of Harry and pulled him into a ferocious hug. He didn't expect her to extremely pregnant. “Come eat. I know you're a prude but fill your belly.” Luna said. She took Teddy from him and removed the charm. “Teddy bear!” She squealed and kissed his little face. Teddy changed his hair white to match hers. And Luna took Teddy over to sit in a high chair that appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>“Harry.” Ora said. He was putting various breakfast foods on his plate.<br/>
“Morning.” Harry said finding his voice.<br/>
“I see you found the bathroom.” Luna said smiling. Harry nodded.<br/>
“But I don't reckon I'll take Teddy in there.” Harry was getting a plate of food loaded with eggs, bacon and gravy. It was an American breakfast.<br/>
“Why is that? He needs a bath too?” Luna said. She had a spoon and was feeding Teddy some oats.<br/>
“It nearly drowned me, it did.” Harry said glaring up at the house which he now realized was a giant tree. They were staying in a giant tree. Luna snorted. Ora laughed. Harry's eyes widened.<br/>
“You got cleaned right? It did its job!” Luna said but she was smiling. Harry took a sip of orange juice.<br/>
“Harry, for future reference there is a standing shower in the corner of the room. Take your wand and tap the vines three times. When you take Teddy in the shower will change to a bath on its own.” Ora said. Harry nodded.<br/>
“At least someone is helpful.” Harry said after eating a bite of egg. Luna laughed.<br/>
“I've missed you Harry.”<br/>
“I've missed you too Luna dear.” Harry said. “When did this happen?” Harry made a gesture with his hand at his belly.<br/>
“I'm due next month. This little fella is bouncing on my bladder but my sex drive has been going crazy.” Luna grinned.<br/>
“No complaints there.” Ora said. “We may have to actually plan on children of our own then once Leif stops traveling for his book.” Harry didn't know what to say to all of that.</p><p>Luna watched Harry closely. “Confused Harry?” She asked. Teddy finished his breakfast and wanted to play with the kittens that roamed the grounds.<br/>
“No just surprised about somethings. I thought Ora said you two were getting married this fall.”<br/>
Luna’s smile widened. “Open your mind a bit Harry. I’m marrying Ora and Leif in a traditional wizarding ceremony. We have a...open relationship you could say. I'm carrying Ora’s sister’s child. They couldn't conceive so I volunteered to be a vessel for their child.” Luna smiled down at her stomach.<br/>
“Wow. That's amazing. And it's your life Luna. I'm not here to judge. Is that why you left?” Harry asked. </p><p>“I left because I had a dream about Ora and Leif. Leif was raising his two sons alone and Ora was struggling with his depression. I brought them here. That's how this place started.” Luna said.<br/>
“What about Neville?” Harry asked. The last he heard Luna and Neville were happy.<br/>
“Harry, that was over a year and half ago. Almost 2 years. Teddy is almost 2. Neville and I drifted apart. It was great at first but then it changed. I can't even entirely say when it changed, just that it did. I moved on instead of wallowing in my pain.” Luna was sipping her tea.</p><p>Harry noticed the tattoo on Ora’s head was now a sun. His tattoo changed with the hours of the day. He looked over to see Teddy petting a black kitten. For some odd reason it reminded him of Snape. </p><p>“It’s not easy for everyone to move on.” Harry finally spoke.<br/>
“You're right. But it is time Harry.” Luna said somehow she moved sneakily and was standing beside him. She engulfed him in a hug. The scent of lavender in the air calmed him.<br/>
“You're Harry fucking Potter. You're not supposed to be a hollow person. You'll get better. I'll help you. Just listen to what Luna tells you ok?” Luna said with a grin. Harry found it terrifying but the glow on her face and the feeling of calmness made him weak so he agreed.</p>
