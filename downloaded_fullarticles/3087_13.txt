    <p>Peter’s eleventh birthday was one of his most exciting ones yet. </p>
<p>August 10th Peter woke up to shaking from some nightmare. It was strange, usually he could remember his dreams when he woke up but this one was different, at first, he thought he could remember most of it but as he woke up further the images of a red and blue suit, aliens, and superheroes faded from his mind. Within a minute the dream had faded fully and left Peter alone to shake the slightly haunted feeling.</p>
<p>Eventually, Peter gathered himself and decided that it was time to get out of bed. He got up and started getting dressed. Once he finished getting ready for the day he left his room only to run into Aunt May; she was preparing breakfast for him before he ran off to the library to read. School would be starting soon so the two of them were excited for a day of fun together before Peter would have a lot more on his plate. As they sat down to breakfast there came a knock on the door. Both May and Peter were confused because they weren’t expecting anyone over until Ned came later that night.</p>
<p>Getting up, Peter went and answered the apartment door. Standing outside was a confident looking boy in some odd looking robes. </p>
<p>“Hello, I’m Tony Stark, may I come in?”</p>
<p>Peter stepped to the side, confused. Tony strode into the small apartment, humming and glancing around, seemingly judge his surroundings. Once they got to the dining area May looked at the two boys bewildered. </p>
<p>“Peter, who is this?” May asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not entirely sure.”</p>
<p>“As I told Peter here I’m Tony Stark. I go to a school called Hogwarts and I was asked to deliver this to you.’ Tony said, pulling a letter out of nowhere and handing it to Peter.</p>
<p>Peter opened the letter and started to read it aloud. “We are pleased to tell you that you have a place at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Wait,” Peter interrupted himself, “I didn’t apply for any school, so why am I getting an acceptance letter? And what does it mean that it’s a school of witchcraft? Does it teach people how to do magic tricks?”</p>
<p>“Do you not know about magic?” Tony quizzed. </p>
<p>“What do you mean magic?” May needled back. </p>
<p>“Have you guys ever noticed things happen around you? Things that shouldn’t be able to happen, especially when you have high emotions?” </p>
<p>Thinking back on several instances that had been brushed off throughout his life, Peter’s mind settled on the night Ben died. </p>
<p>“Yes, there have been times when a couple weird things have happened but that doesn’t mean I can pull a rabbit out of a hat.”</p>
<p>“Of course not, you, Peter, are a wizard, not some wanna be pretender.”</p>
<p>“How do you even know this?” </p>
<p>“The school I go to, that you are being invited to attend, has a magic quill that records the name of every magical child in England. Peter, you made the list. That means you have magic even if you don’t realize, which is entirely possible because you are surrounded by muggles.”</p>
<p>Aunt May found her voice with a befuddled “muggles?”</p>
<p>“Muggles are what wizards call non-magic people. You would be considered a muggle because you are not a part of the wizarding community and have no magic.” Tony explained, already starting to get annoyed and bored with the conversation. “But explaining the wizarding world is not why I’m here. I’m here to deliver his” Tony pointed at Peter “letter and I am willing to help you out a bit if you decide to accept this.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean help me?”</p>
<p>“I get that muggle-borns sometimes have a hard time finding their supplies so I’m volunteering to help you out by bringing you back-to-school shopping. I’ll take you along and help you know what to get and what to do.”</p>
<p>“This all sounds fantastic, Tony, but I can’t go to Hogwarts!”</p>
<p>“Why not? Tony asked, genuinely curious.</p>
<p>“I can’t leave May alone.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Peter, sweetheart, don’t stay for me. I understand if you have your own reason for it but don’t make me be the reason you don’t do this.” May implored her nephew in a gentle voice. </p>
<p>“But, May, we just lost Ben, and I don’t want to leave you all alone. It’s only been six months.”</p>
<p>“Peter, I’ll be alright, we always knew you were special, now you have to go show someone new. I’m sure that Ned and I will keep each other company if we get too lonely.”</p>
<p>“Alright then,” Peter turned to Tony, jaw set in determination, “I’ll go. When do you want to meet to go shopping?”</p>
<p>Tony just nodded to Peter’s choice. “I’ll come pick you up at 8 AM this coming Saturday, so you’ve got two weeks to prepare before we leave for school. The rest of what you need to know about the school is in the envelope. See you Saturday!”</p>
<p>Tony turned and was nearly to the door before Peter stopped him with a question. “Where are we going to go?”</p>
<p>“I’m guessing you’ve never heard of Diagon Alley?” With that Tony turned and left.</p>
