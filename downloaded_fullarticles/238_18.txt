    <p>(Why java ?! Why must you hurt me this way ?! I can't go on like this!)<br/>Hermione Granger, a young woman of twenty-one with long brown hair in brushwood and brown eyes like melted milk chocolate, works in the specialized bicycle shop of her mother, Jean Granger. She has been doing this job since she returned to her hometown of Las Vegas a few months ago, leaving medical school behind.</p><p>In general, this work is going well for Hermione, but getting up practically at dawn is not really a pleasure.<br/>(Because I really need my cold caffeine brew, so badly needed.)<br/>"Late, late ...!" Hermione breaths, rushing to her mother's store.<br/>She searches for the keys to trade in her jacket pockets and that's when two things happen almost simultaneously.</p><p>In the first place, Hermione enters head on into something warm and solid.<br/>"Ooof!" She said surprised.<br/>In reality, it is not something but rather of someone warm and solid. Then Hermione stumbles backwards. Hands clasp around her arms to stabilize her, and the young woman is thus spared a bad fall on one of the dirty sidewalks of Las Vegas.<br/>"Whoa ... wow, I'm so sorry, thanks for ...!"</p><p>Hermione looks up to see the face of the person who saved her.<br/>( Oh my God! )<br/>Standing right in front of her, touching her arms, is the most beautiful woman she has ever seen before. The woman's long black hair streaked with blondes shines in the rising sun like a delirious riot of a colored yin yang.</p><p>(And her eyes ...! Well, I am far from being an expert in precious stones, but ... it looks like slightly faded sapphire, her eyes .... they are the most beautiful blue-gray I have never seen. )<br/>The eyes in question are currently wide with surprise. While Hermione looks at the aristocratic, almost royal-looking woman, the sapphire gaze softens, taking a full measure of Hermione.</p><p>The mysterious woman has a slight smile on her face and then addresses Hermione with her voice, seeming to be a low purring sounding like the sensation of her fingers caressing the bottom of Hermione's elbow, a caress of velvet.<br/>"Okay now, someone was in a hurry, hm? Are you okay, honey?"</p><p>Hermione opens her mouth and closes it quickly, too stunned by the other woman's beauty to speak.<br/>(How does someone around this woman work? She is so ...)<br/>Fortunately for Hermione, the woman rescues her from herself again, smiling gently at her.<br/>"You should be more careful."</p><p>The woman's voice drops, she leans towards Hermione, her long eyelashes, so long ... her fingers almost burning as she moves two on Hermione's arm towards the crook of the young woman's elbow.<br/>"You never know what danger awaits you in this city of sin." Said the woman.</p><p>Hermione feels shyly blush.<br/>(She still touches me.)<br/>The woman's hands are gloved, Hermione has just realized. The fabric, silver lace, whispers on the brunette's skin as the mysterious woman loosens her grip ... and she gently runs her hands along Hermione's arms, as if to make sure that she will no longer fall.Â </p><p>Even when gloved, the woman's fingers are hot.<br/>"Thank you, for uh ... catching up with me, it was really nice, and I'm really sorry I got you in there! Are you ...?" Said Hermione before interrupting herself.</p><p>Hermione notices with nascent horror that there is now foam on the woman's cheek, foam that comes from Hermione's coffee. The young woman raises her hand without thinking to try to wipe away the damage she has done by accident.<br/>( Oh! )</p><p>Too fast for Hermione's gaze to follow the movement, the hand of the mysterious woman dashes forward and closes around her wrist. Her fingers are firm but not hurtful and the two women find themselves frozen on the sidewalk in this position, staring into each other's eyes. Hermione almost hopes that the ground will open and engulf it entirely.</p><p>(Oh my god! I just tried to touch the face of a complete stranger who is also totally attractive ?! Did I really just do that? Why Hermione? Why did you do that?)<br/>"I'm really sorry, I didn't mean ...!" Said Hermione embarrassed.<br/>The very image of grace and coolness, the woman gently shakes her head and smiles at Hermione. Gently kissed the gloved finger drink with her free hand and then tapping Hermione's cheek with it.</p><p>Then the woman releases Hermione.<br/>"Now, now, never apologize for reaching for what you want, especially when what you want is so obvious." She said, her thumb touching the brunette's chin, one second and then leaving the next.<br/>"Hah! I want ...! I was just ...!" Said Hermione blushing again.</p><p>(Okay, Hermione, breathe! Oxygen! It's necessary to live!)<br/>Hermione's face feels on fire and her heartbeat explodes, but she tries to pull herself together.</p><p>(I am capable of finesse, I can perfect a basic conversation, I understood it.)<br/>"I was just, uh ... opening my bicycle store," said Hermione, shaking her keys and nodding toward the store behind the mysterious woman.<br/>"Oh? A specialty bicycle store?" Said the woman, looking intrigued.</p><p>The woman turns around and inspects the Granger store window, then looks at Hermione again, staring at her with a sort of persistence.<br/>"To lead a state like this, you probably need strong thighs, right?" She asks a little smirk.</p><p>(Is she ... she thinks of my thighs?)<br/>Hermione tried not to burn any discomfort on the spot.<br/>"We ... well, yeah, I'm fine, except to arrive on time today." Hermione sighs.<br/>The woman wrinkles her aristocratic nose, then together, the two women walk the otherwise empty street at this early hour.<br/>"Um, yes, tell me, why open so early?" Asked the woman.<br/>Hermione sighs again.<br/>" It's just... "</p><p>( My mother. )<br/>"This is what is expected of me, a rule I must follow." Hermione replies.<br/>The woman leans a second time towards Hermione.<br/>"Oh, but no one ever told you? Rules are such a nuisance, darling." She said.<br/>The woman's smile is slow, sweet and attracts Hermione like the flame butterfly.<br/>"It's so much more fun breaking the rules," said the woman, straightening up.</p><p>The woman glances at the Granger store window and downstairs are staring at the now almost empty cup in Hermione's hand.<br/>"Work so hard, so early ... if I had something to say about this, someone will bring you your coffee."<br/>Hermione smiled at she.<br/>"A delivery of java? It would be nice, a girl can dream, huh?" She said.</p><p>(God, Hermione, where did your manners go?)<br/>"Oh, by the way, I'm Hermione Granger."<br/>The woman looks at Hermione through her eyelashes. She spreads the foam off her pale cheek, then licks it lightly from her glove, and her smile ignites everything in Hermione.<br/>-Dreams can come true for those who deserve it, Hermione, and I am Narcissa Black.</p><p>That said, Narcissa turns and walks away on the sidewalk, leaving Hermione stunned and breathless in her wake. The young woman remains silent for several minutes ... watching the graceful figure of Narcissa fade on the edges and finally disappear in the scorching morning mist of Las Vegas.</p><p>(It could just as easily have been a waking dream, a kind of wonderful mirage.)<br/>Hermione slowly looks towards her cup of java which now contains only melting ice.</p><p>(But it was not a mirage, it was indeed real and here with me.)<br/>Hermione lets out a breath that she didn't even know she was holding. It's probably her imagination, probably, but she can almost feel Narcissa's hands on her arms again. The warmth of lace, the strength of her elegant fingers ...</p><p>(I wish ... I wish that I ...)<br/>A knock on the window of the bicycle shop, coming from inside it, attracts Hermione's attention. A woman in her mid-forties looking slightly like her but green eyes instead of brown stares at her. Her mother, Jean Granger, points her wrist excessively, she doesn't even wear a watch, but Hermione gets the message clearly.</p><p>Moaning softly, Hermione tosses her cup of ice in the trash can in front of the store entrance and heads inside.<br/>(Another day, another adjusted bicycle seat, ugh ...!)</p>
