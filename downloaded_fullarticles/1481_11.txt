    <p>There were times when Draco wondered if life would have been easier if he had been killed in the war.</p><p>Appearing in public now required nerves of steel. If he thought his final two years at Hogwarts were hellish, now he saw a similar future stretched out ahead of him. It didn't help his father had recently been on trial; sentencing would happen in the coming week. Because of that, public appearances were deemed politic, especially tonight, one year to the day of the last battle that had taken place at Hogwarts.</p><p>A commemorative event was to be held at the scene of the crime, now that Hogwarts was successfully rebuilt. Efforts toward its reconstruction had been made, in some small part, with Malfoy money. Draco resented it—it would have been far less hypocritical, he felt, if they had just come right out and fined them. Instead, the Ministry in all its infinite wisdom had asked for donations, by hinting at how the Malfoys would soon have to go without.</p><p>It was simultaneously blackmail and a threat, both to which Draco and his mother had caved. What could they do now but dance to the whims of the new Ministry?</p><p>Harry Potter would be speaking tonight, and their counsel had informed them of his intent to give due credit to Narcissa Malfoy. That was the reason they had come and not stayed locked up in their home, pretending that life went on as normal.</p><p>Draco would have much preferred not to be back in Hogwarts. This place was filled to the brim with his misdeeds and being here was suffocating. He wouldn't have put it past his mother to slip him a relaxation draught in his aperitif before they came. Unfortunately, if she had, she hadn't put a strong enough dosage and now he felt distinctly ill at ease. His shirt collar seemed hexed with a shrinking charm guaranteed to strangle him before the night was out.</p><p>He sat at the edge of the fray with his back to the wall, nursing what was probably his fourth—fifth?—glass of wine, wishing his mother weren't so consummate a politician that she felt inclined to speak with everyone in the room. He wished the night were already over. When he looked up at the sky, it was dark and he could make out a faint smattering of stars. Not a cloud in sight. If only there could be a giant storm that blew in right now, he could make his getaway.</p><p>Most of all, he wished that the wine weren't watered down and that he was drunker. He couldn't see the difference between being here and sitting in Azkaban—all the happiness was currently being sucked out of him by slapping him in the face with his worst decisions.</p><p>Failure upon failure, with only the briefest punctuation of success at actions that only led to what was now considered evil in the extreme. Or deluded, as he was lucky to have been labeled. Poor, deluded Draco bogged down with extortionate demands on his life, was how his lawyer was planning on spinning it. It was possibly how he would be seen for the rest of his life—either evil incarnate or the biggest simpleton to ever walk the Hogwarts grounds.</p><p><em>Here</em> was where he tried to get glory by winning the House cup—and failed.</p><p><em>Here</em> was the place he allowed rabid Death Eaters to enter to do their worst. Here was the place where he dueled with Harry Potter—and failed.</p><p><em>Here</em> was the place where he plotted and planned to do just that, and failed.</p><p><em>Here</em> was the place where he watched Professor Snape—a man he trusted beyond a shadow of a doubt to do the right thing—kill the headmaster.</p><p><em>Here</em> was the place he watched as the Carrows tortured students as punishment.</p><p><em>Here</em> was the place he watched his friend get swallowed by a great whorl of cursed fire.</p><p>There was a humming sound in his head at that very last thought. Images threatened to override his vision, only halting with the striking of the Hogwarts clock. Nine o’clock.</p><p>Draco made up his mind. He stood abruptly from the deserted table, with every intention of leaving this place. His mother would understand.</p><p>That was when he bumped into someone and splashed his drink all over their shirt and slacks. When Draco saw who it was, he could have cursed his luck through the seven seas, because of all people, he would have to run into Hermione Granger. Of course.</p><p>“Ergh,” she said, looking every bit as put out as he was.</p><p>The funny thing about Draco's life was that nothing ever happened when it should have happened. This sort of thing would have been exceedingly amusing back before the Dark Lord began to live rent-free in his house. Now, after Hermione Granger was just hailed as the brains that saved Harry Potter at least seven times in the past, it was a sign of things to come.</p><p>“I beg your pardon,” Draco said through stiff lips. This was horrible, horrible, horrible, and, cowardly though it might have been, he cast around for his mother to come save him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Granger seemed not to have even noticed who it was had done the bumping, or else she might have accused him of doing it on purpose. She was attempting to clean up her shirt with her wand and failing.</p><p>All Draco wanted to do was to exit this situation, so he coughed and said, “Maybe I can help?” It was a question on his end, because he didn't need his helpfulness to be misconstrued as intention to hex.</p><p>She shrugged. “Why not?”</p><p>He didn't think she had even registered to whom she was saying this, so he slowly said the charm and aimed his wand carefully toward her shirt, keeping wary eyes on her at all times.</p><p>“Thanks,” she said, squinting down at herself in a way that would have been comical if Draco had been capable of humour at that moment. She then waved her wand a bit and he stepped backwards, thinking for just a moment that now he was going to get cursed.</p><p>“I was in a hurry and brought the wrong wand. And I couldn't Apparate from the premises, so—” Granger waved her wand around again and he weaved along with her motions, trying to keep clear of the tip.</p><p>Then he recognised the wand. “Isn't that—” He didn't even finish. It was. It definitely was Bellatrix's wand.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said with a sigh, rotating it a little in her hand in a way that was just a bit too careless. In fact, now that he thought about it, she looked distinctly tottered. As the thought crossed his mind, she stumbled to the other foot as though she had fallen asleep standing up.</p><p>“Are—are you alright?” Draco looked around the room and back to her uneasily. The last thing he needed was for her to fall on him. Then he would be dead. Hexed to death by her friends and a litany of bad spells. He looked around for red hair.</p><p>She waved a hand. “Oh, fine, fine. I've just helped win the war, so everything's just brilliant, isn't it? Except my personal life's now on the blitz.” She peered at him a bit. “Malfoy, is that you? I thought you were Luna.”</p><p>“Except we look nothing alike and I'm about five feet taller than her. Either your eyesight has gone or I've reached new lows if I'm being mistaken for a woman.” He was caught off guard enough that he resorted to sarcasm.</p><p>“The hair's kind of similar,” she said, unblinking eyes now staring at him with an intensity that made him try to duck away.</p><p>“I'm pretty sure I know my own family tree and we're not related.”</p><p>“It's probably been tampered with,” she said before she started scrubbing at her eyes. Before he could do more than stare at her with unusually gape-jawed idiocy, she burst into tears.</p><p>He stared at her in horror, feet fixed to the ground when he should have been sprinting away. He wasn’t quite sure what he had done this time—surely he had done much worse in the past and she had merely tossed her hair and narrowed her eyes at him as though he were a slug too low to engage.</p><p>To give her credit, she recovered fairly quickly. She took one long sniff and placed a hand on her chest, shaking her head all at the same time. “No, it’s—nothing to do with you. I have—other things on my mind, that’s all.”</p><p>“Right. Alright.” He was just muttering words that he thought she liked to hear now as he thought at a furious pace just what he said to make her go off like that. He was fairly sure he hadn’t used any unpleasant appellations toward her.</p><p>She sniffed and looked at him with red but mercifully dry eyes. “All you blondes look the same to me anyway.”</p><p>Somehow Draco had the feeling this wasn’t about his hair colour anymore, but he had no idea what that something was. At least she wasn’t making those horrifying gasping cries now. “I mean, if you go back far enough, maybe all blondes are related.”</p><p>That, apparently, was something to set her over the edge. She made a pathetic hiccoughing sound that had him reach out one awkward hand.</p><p>She held him off as she started to talk as though he weren’t even there. “It’s not as though I don’t have it all under control,” she seemed to be muttering in between furiously scrubbing her eyes. “And it’s not like I don’t still have parents somewhere. A lot of people are a lot worse off than I am—argh! What did they put in this wine!” she yelled suddenly, making him jump.</p><p>He had no idea what she had been about to do next, but when she pointed the wand at her dripping nose, he leaped forward and knocked the wand away from her. He heard the distant clatter as it fell to the ground, and then both of them dropped down to look for it.</p><p>“Why’d you do that?” she asked him over her shoulder, now awkwardly on all fours. She lifted one arm and furiously scrubbed at her face with her sleeve.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something, and then shut it. Instead, he pulled out a handkerchief, shook it out and leaned down to hand it to her. The effort of speaking to her and the ensuing acrobatics made him dizzy and he decided that—as crazy as the bane of his life was behaving, he might as well have a rest right here on the floor against the wall. He angled his knees up in front of him.</p><p>“Thanks,” she said, pulling herself up to rest on her haunches. She apparently had no idea how to wipe her face gracefully. Instead, all he could say was that she used his handkerchief thoroughly.</p><p>There was a burst of laughter somewhere on the other end of the hall and suddenly the lights from that direction extinguished. Any second now, they would be in the center of attention. Where once he had yearned to be adulated by all, Draco now just wanted to hide away in the manor, free to languish unknown for all of perpetuity. Instead, he was secluded behind this empty table, with someone with whom he’d had varying degrees of intense enmity over the years.</p><p>He wondered why she was crying when the rest of her clan were celebrating—they’d won, hadn’t they? They weren’t the ones who had most of their relatives killed and imprisoned and their house gutted like meat for the frying pit. His first instinct on seeing her had been to avoid her and any possible gloating words she’d cast at him. Or worse, words of pity.</p><p>Bugger. He couldn’t think of a worse reaction from <em>her.</em></p><p>A bemused expression crossed her face. “I was about to do something,” she said with a confused frown. “But I’ve forgotten what it was.” Instead of peering around, both her hands were on her thighs as though in meditation and she was staring blankly into space.</p><p>She was drunker than how his head felt, and it felt like it was floating about six feet from the top of his neck. Using his wand, he pointed in the direction her wand had rolled. “Your wand.”</p><p>It should have been funny that a drunk Hermione Granger was so slow-moving, when the real one would have stomped over his hand to retrieve anything that she had dropped. The wand had rolled under one of the chairs on the other side of the table. After a moment of watching as Granger ducked unathletically to avoid banging her head on the rungs of the chairs—was she trying to crawl under them?—and failing, he summoned the wand into his hand and held it gingerly out in front of him. “Here,” he said. “You shouldn't be using this anyway. You should—”</p><p>Her hand was outstretched and her shirt sleeve had pulled up along her arm, revealing a reddened scar on the inside of her wrist. His eyes flickered over the mark and he dropped the wand.</p><p>Images danced on the inside of his eyelids.</p><p><em>Mudblood</em>, <em>I'll make you talk</em>, his aunt had screeched and he had stood there, feet frozen. In that instant, on the floor of his drawing room where he used to play with his toys, Granger's eyes had flown to his in an unconscious search of reassurance before she was pinned to the ground. Screams were ripped from the back of her throat; incoherent, high-pitched sounds that were a mixture of crying and begging—the type that no one in their right mind could ignore or refuse. Draco himself had been on the verge of begging his own aunt to <em>make it stop.</em></p><p>Bellatrix hadn’t been sane, though he hadn't realised the extent of it until that moment.</p><p>He hadn't interfered, and his father had later congratulated him on his spine of steel.</p><p>Some compliment.</p><p>Of the two ot them that day, Draco would wager he had been more terrified. He had been terrified he would be ordered to kill her. Every time he thought things couldn’t get any worse, they did.</p><p>Hermione Granger had barely been able to stand when Weasley and Potter escaped with her. Draco had seen the Carrows torture kids, but in a teasing sort of way, lazily, to demonstrate how it should be done. It hadn't been executed with such maddened relentlessness, punishing everything that this girl was and wasn't, in order to scar her for life in a way that took viciousness to a new level.</p><p>Seeing someone tortured before they were killed was just about the most excruciating thing Draco could think of. He had barely been able to stop himself from throwing up. Some spine of steel. He wanted to scream at her to <em>run, you stupid Mudblood, why are you still here?</em></p><p>Draco could hardly breathe now, seeing that marred flesh on her arm. The inscription looked burnt, and suddenly that description took him back to the Room of Requirement, where he had seen the look on Crabbe's face as he fell. Surprise mixed with anxiety, then dominated by terror as he lost his balance. The fire had curled hungrily around Crabbe’s body, eager to consume him, tendrils of flame incinerating his skin even before he had fallen from view. That view was a common recurring nightmare for him whenever he had had a particularly bad day.</p><p>That fate would have been his, if this girl and her friends hadn't circled back for him. They didn't have to; he certainly never did likewise for them.</p><p>Even if he'd wanted to, he couldn't have.</p><p>He’d failed at most things in his life, he now realised, and the worst failure had resulted in the death of Crabbe. Stupid, foolish, loyal Crabbe. Screaming, burning Crabbe—</p><p>
  <em>     no, Crabbe, don’t let go—CRABBE—</em>
</p><p>“Malfoy. <em>Malfoy!</em>”</p><p>He realised with a start where he was, crouched down near a wall in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, hidden by a round table set out for the memorial speeches. The sound of screaming—always Crabbe’s screaming—gradually faded away as he blinked his eyes and unclenched his jaw where it had been grinding down so hard even his neck was tense.</p><p>He wasn't inside the Room of Requirement. He wasn't even in the Manor. This wasn't his Hogwarts years; it was another day.</p><p>He slowly took his hands down from the sides of his face and noticed there was a hand attached to his sleeve; it belonged to Granger. Yes, she was there too. It wasn't a snake this time. His breathing slowed and he fell backwards to sit against the wall, unclenching his jaw from its closed and locked position.</p><p>She stared at him with wide eyes and held her hands aloft, as though talking to a wild animal. “It's okay,” she said in a soothing tone. “It's okay.”</p><p>He rubbed one cheek against his shoulder and found that his eyes felt gritty, stinging. How humiliating. If only he had left an hour earlier, none of this would have occurred and he would still have his dignity.</p><p>“Here,” she said, her face all scrunched up as though she were trying desperately not to cry alongside him. She held out his handkerchief, which fell cleanly into neat lines—she had cleaned it. He didn’t take it back. Any overt movements and he’d shatter. Just break apart into little pieces, hopefully so fine that nobody would ever know he had been there.</p><p>Eventually, he had to look up. Thankfully, she had the sensitivity to be looking anywhere but at him although she hadn’t had the tact to take herself off. She did manage to make him laugh when he saw that she was using the tablecloth to blow her nose.</p><p>“Keep the handkerchief,” he said finally. “You look like you need one.”</p><p>“It’s supposed to be a happy day—you know?” she said, looking at him as though it were natural for her to look at him for reassurance. “But when they started talking about all the people who’ve—” She couldn’t finish her thought, and her knuckles turned white as her grip on the tablecloth tightened.</p><p>“I didn’t think I’d still be alive,” he found himself saying. A moment later, when she blinked at him, eyes sharpening for a moment, he deeply regretted his words.</p><p>But instead of asking questions, she nodded. “Me neither,” she said and lapsed into silence.</p><p>Once he thought she had a monopoly on questions, as though she earned a Galleon for every question mark she sent into the world. Right now, she looked fragile enough to break, eyes red and brimming with unshed tears and a quivering mouth. He had never seen her look less than confident, but now any pretensions at happiness was gone.</p><p><em>Survivor's Remorse</em>, they had called it earlier in the evening, and he had almost snorted at the incongruity of such a thing. Yet, without her coming to cry in his corner, he wouldn’t have understood such a phrase. They were both marked-up individuals; he out of some mistaken past ideas of fame and glory and she out of excessive loyalty to her friends. Which of them was the bigger fool? He didn't know, but somehow he wondered if it wasn't him.</p><p>They sat there for a moment that felt like anywhere from five minutes to half an hour. It was a strange intimacy being there, shielded by the table with only the partygoers’ feet walking about them to disturb their momentary isolation. It was as peaceful and quiet as was possible to find in the midst of flashing lights and determined frivolity swirling overhead.</p><p>He broke it by rising quickly to his feet. Too quickly. He had to brace himself on the back of a chair to steady himself, only faintly aware of her slowly getting up a few feet away. Perhaps she wasn't the drunk one, but him. “I'm sorry,” he said, the words coming out abruptly and without clarity. For what was he apologising? He couldn't say, but possibly for too many things to catalogue. He thrust Aunt Bella's wand at her, which she took after a moment's hesitation. “Get rid of it. That wand. It's—it's evil.”</p><p>She turned the wand over in her hand before looking back at him. “It's just a wand.”</p><p>“It's a magical artifact, capable of storing trapped magic. She—You should get rid of it.”</p><p>She nodded slowly. “Okay. I will.” She opened her mouth to say something more, but nothing came out and he turned away, raking his hair back with shaky fingers. He was never coming back here again.</p><p>“We all have bad dreams... you know?” she said suddenly, and he looked back at her. Her eyes were locked on his face with that single-minded intensity that he always equated with her swottiness.</p><p>Time and again, he had made fun of her dedication to schoolwork, trying to mask his annoyance at always coming second. There had never been any denying her intelligence and there was no denying it now. She had seen more than he had meant to reveal and she knew now that his insides were scrambled and in turmoil and had been for awhile now.</p><p>Time was when he would have rejected her overtures and said something rude in passing. Now, he lifted his lashes to stare at her, for the first time really seeing her. He had seen her full of herself, self-righteous, haughty, <em>maybe </em>even pretty that one time, and he'd seen her crying and begging, which was more horrible than he'd thought possible. Worried and compassionate for him, never. Her eyes were slightly red and her hair was starting to pull free from the clip on the side of her head. Her lips were slightly pinched from her early teary outburst and her freckles stood out in stark contrast against her white face. She was looking far from her best, but the sympathy was unmistakable in her eyes and made her look like the best friend he never realised he needed.</p><p>“It’ll get better,” she said and he latched onto her words like it was a personal promise. It never occurred to him to scoff at that, at what was a rote phrase, useless as prophecy.</p><p>She had always known the answers to everything; there was no reason for him to start disbelieving her now.</p>
