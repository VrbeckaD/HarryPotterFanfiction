    <p>Unknown to Western-Europe muggle storytellers, this Dragon isn’t, in fact, green, but has highly valued golden scales.</p><p>Its green color comes from its diet of animals (and some plants) often found in marshes and lakes rich in algae, and, often the Mediterranean shores. The remains of these waters make it easy for moss to grow harmlessly on this Dragon’s scales.</p><p>The Western Green has been an unusually numerous species of Dragon through history thanks to the fact that its corpse tends to explode if it dies violently, fact that has cowed any poachers interested in selling the Western Green's golden scales; this ‘ability’ aids the Dragon to remove any potential threat to its offspring even if the specimen is not strong enough to do it in live.</p><p>This defense mechanism is suspect of being the cause of the extinction of various Dragon-eating species* documented to have lived up until the fall of the Roman Empire.</p><p>Thought due to the witch hunts carried through the middle ages* have cut down its numbers, the fact remains that this species is the more common among Dragons in all of Europe.</p>
