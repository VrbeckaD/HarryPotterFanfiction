    <p>The rain came swiftly to Diagon Alley. It bounced off the stone paved road, puddling quickly along the path as those caught in the down pour ran for shelter. She felt the water seep into her shoes and pulled the hood off her head looking up into the sky. People ran past her; laughter broke out from behind a quickly closing door. Lights shone brightly around the closed shutters of the shop windows; minutes ago, she had been unable to walk through the crowded pathway, now the road was clear as the last door shut leaving her alone in the silence. She embraced the cool water hitting her face as it wiped away the tears she had been trying to hide moments before. The lights and sounds from the fire works had tried to bring her back to that night and she could still smell the odor of burned flesh in the air. She felt the ache in her chest as the walls she built around the memories threatened to fall.</p>
<p>Memories of those that had perished before they had been unable to do anything. The rain had been a blessing. The smell had begun to fade, and the fireworks had disappeared as the happy people retreated behind their walls. She could breath still. That panic attacks that used to take hold of her over the slightest noise was gone.</p>
<p>It had been two years since they won the war. Every year the Wizarding world celebrated the defeat of the Dark Lord by recognizing those that had died, every year she walked this path and was brought back to the past. She moved silently allowing the rain to wash away the memories. It had begun to thrive again as the year passed. Families walked the streets and enjoyed that pleasantries that the alley could bring them. She made it a mission to avoid the section as much as possible. They had been hailed as heroes at the conclusion of the battle. Those that had hidden away safely, refused to come out to join the cause, suddenly came in waves when the fighting was done. They had hosted parties and feasts in celebration. Money that could’ve been used during the fighting was thrown around wildly. It was better that she stayed away from it all. It was the great orange building and its inhabitants inside that lured her out on this day. She opened the door to the shop and shook slightly letting the rain fall off of her.</p>
<p>                “Hermione you made it!” Ginny yelled bouncing down the staircase and pulled her in close wrapping her arms around her thin frame. She quickly scolded pushing her back. “Why are you so wet? Did you play in it?” Ginny took her wand out and aimed it at her, she flinched as the warmth took over her. She smiled as the witch took her in for another hug and she lifted her arms to return it.</p>
<p>                “You just missed Harry, he went out to get something across the street, he’ll be back before its time don’t worry about that. Ron and George are here on the roof. We’ve been waiting on you to show. I was starting to wonder, but I know how this day is for you” Ginny smiled and squeezed her arms before releasing them. Hermione could only stare in return as the witches smile faltered. “This year still bad as the last?” Ginny asked quietly. As if talking about it was going to break her. She shook her head and smiled at last.</p>
<p>                “I’ll be fine Ginny. Really.” She walked past the witch and up the stairs to the top of the Weasley brothers famed shop. She stood in the doorway and observed the laughter of those on the roof. The boys had protected it from the rain and she could see the drops trying to force their way through. She let her eyes scan across the happy couples that ran around the room. George and Angela toasted to the crowd and cheers rose up to meet them. Angela lounged resting comfortably on Georges side. Hannah and Neville passed a cup back and forth laughing at a joke she had missed. Luna sat smiling with her eyes closed enjoying from the cup that she too held in her hand. They were healing, happy even, those that wandered around the rooftop talked and mingled as if this was any other day.</p>
<p>She didn’t belong here.</p>
<p>                She turned back towards the door as Ron shouted her name and she felt her shoulders stiffen slightly. “About time you decide to join us. We almost started with out you.” He said walking up to her and taking her hand, leading her to the rest of the survivors. That’s what the meeting was, those that survived, the original groups that help reform the Order, to remember those that they had lost. As if any of them truly needed help remembering. Hannah Abbott had suggested it before the anniversary last year, thought it would help them heal. Drinks and memories fixed everything in the mind of the barmaid. She had rolled her eyes at the Hufflepuff then, but still had dragged herself to the meeting that year and this.</p>
<p>She felt a hand touch her shoulder and she flinched and turned quickly. Harry raised his hand and smiled slightly handing her a cup that she quickly put to her lips, allowing the burning liquid to flow down to her empty stomach.</p>
<p>“Are we ready?” He looked at the group as the laughter stopped and those seated rose to their feet. She followed Harry and Ron to the center of the group as the eyes landed on the trio. Slowly she raised her wand to the sky and let off the first spark, the gold light burst through the barrier above them and allowed the rain to find her again. She lifted her face to the sky and let the newly formed tears mix once again with the water falling down. The group followed their lead pointing at the sky and letting their own golden lights fill the night air. The roof tops of the alley lit up with those that had their own to remember. A light for a body. For each and every soul that she had betrayed.</p>
