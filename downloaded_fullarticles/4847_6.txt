<p>Little bashing: Maruders, Lily and Dumbledore<br/>
Main character: Severus Snape<br/>
Action time: after the "Mudblood"<br/>
Severus wanders alone in the corridors of Hogwarts.<br/>
He finds an old dusty portrait of one of the Founders of Hogwarts.<br/>
Severus is making a strange acquaintance/mentoring/friendship with an old wizard / witch.<br/>
If Severus Snape had someone trusted who would support him, advise him and teach him, how would his life change?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CAN HAVE:</p>
<p>The choice of one founder belongs to the author:<br/>
Salazar who can will show him what it means to be a real Slytherin.<br/>
Godric who will show Severus that not all Gryffindors are tyrants.<br/>
Helena will show Him that loyalty and diligence aren't weaknesses.<br/>
Rowena who will show him that even the wisest have done many things wrong and the asking for help isn't a weakness.</p>
<p>The founders may appear with the development of the storyline.<br/>
Severus may try to find portraits of the rest of the founders so they can be in one room.<br/>
His actions will help him win favor at ghosts, elves and other portraits.</p>
<p>Severus gets friends from different Houses (NOT Lily)</p>
<p>Paring: not earlier than the 7th year of Hogwarts. Severus is a damaged and abused child. He loves Lily, but I think he also has an obsession with her. They relationship wasn't healthy.<br/>
Severus must first opening up to other people before he dating with someone (it doesn't have to be Lily).</p>
<p><br/>
CAN'T HAVE:<br/>
Slytherins (students) abusing unforgivable spells, Slytherin - evil as an entire House, Gryffindor - good as an entire House, Snape sorted into Gryffindor because he was abused by the Slytherins</p>
