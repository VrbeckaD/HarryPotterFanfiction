    <p>Sunlight filtered through the curtains. The windows were left open overnight to combat the sweltering heat. Not enough cooling charms around the room worked.</p><p>A groan emerged from the bed, the owner’s leg kicking the thin blanket off of their body. They didn’t know why their partner insisted on having the blanked in the night. <em>That’s because of night time demons coming to steal me in my sleep. Just humour me.</em> Yeah right, as if they’d risk their lives trying to take him in their sleep. Harry was way too much of a light sleeper to have demons be a threat.</p><p>Speaking of said partner, he wasn’t there.</p><p>Draco groaned again, his hands reaching across to Harry’s side. It was still somewhat warm which meant Harry hadn’t been awake for long. With an annoyed huff, Draco wiped whatever sleep he had left off his face and sat up.</p><p>He felt something on his finger that wasn’t normally there. All of a sudden what happened last night came to him in a rush. A stupid grin started to make its way onto his face, and for once Draco didn’t care that he was showing too much. He was happy. Or happier. Details.</p><p>Stretching his back as he stood, he looked around for his loungewear. The last he saw of it last night was in the living room, but knowing Harry he probably spelled them onto the chair slash laundry pile. Draco knew the first thing he would change and it was that damned chair.</p><p>He finally found them and put them on. He checked the full length mirror in the corner of the room, making sure his hair wasn’t too unpresentable and proceeded to find where Harry was. He was either in the living room catching up on the morning news and answering owls, or in the kitchen having his morning coffee.</p><p>From the sounds he could hear, the kitchen seemed most probable.</p><p>“Morning fiancé.” Draco greeted.</p><p>Harry’s answering smile was blinding. Merlin, this man was all his? <em>Forever?</em></p><p>“Good morning to you too, love.” Harry put his mug down and crossed the short distance to hug Draco.</p><p>He hummed when Draco returned the hug and tightened his grip.</p>
