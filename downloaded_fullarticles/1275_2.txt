  <em>The Manor’s dining hall was silent and still, each cloaked figure waiting anxiously for news of their Dark Lord and his second-in-command. They filled the chairs around the long table, only moving to sip the wine the Malfoy's house elves provided. Lucius Malfoy sat at the head of the table. He hadn’t moved since the Dark Lord left them. His wife was the only person standing; she had her golden wine glass clutched in front of her as she stared into the fireplace. Internally, she hoped that this would be the night it ended. God willing, there would be no more victims in her home. No more monsters traipsing about terrifying her son or snakes slithering around threatening his young life. There would finally be peace in her home, whether He returned or not.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The house elves returned again to refill her guests’ wine. She waved off the squeaky little thing that tried to refill her glass and placed it on their tray instead. She hadn’t even sipped her first cup.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>She needed to check on Draco. It had been hours since she put him to bed.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Right as she turned to head upstairs, an ear-piercing scream broke the tense silence of the dining hall. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Even with the horrors of the war, Narcissa had never heard a scream that terrified her more. She had heard people shriek in the agony of torture, played witness to people pleading for their lives, listened to mothers wailing over their dead children, but nothing chilled her more than this scream. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>This one came from her son.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>She practically flew up the stairs, clutching the hem of her dress to her hip so she could run unimpeded. In her panic, she completely forgot the magic she had nurtured all her life. Apparating didn’t even cross her mind.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>A house elf – Dobby, if memory served – was already reaching into Draco’s antique crib when she burst into the room.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>She rushed in and scooped her only son from his bed before the startled creature could. Draco had stopped his unholy screaming and switched to a miserable sort of wailing cry. Narcissa had never heard this cry before. Like most babies, Draco had a distinct cry for each of his needs; shrill and insistent when he was hungry, whiny and huffy when he was tired, sad and tearful when he felt neglected, or long and screeching when he needed something out of reach. She had even heard him scream out in fear when that wretched snake had slipped into his bed. But none of his cries compared to the horrendous sound coming from him now. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Narcissa searched him and the room for a cause. His napkin was clean, he hadn’t had anything spilt on him, his dummy and favorite bear were intact and waiting in the crib, nothing was where it shouldn’t be... She turned to the elf. “What happened?" she demanded to know.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Dobby looked absolutely terrified. “Dobby doesn’t know, Madam. Dobby was cleaning the Master’s bedroom. The Little Master was sleeping so nicely. Then the Little Master started screaming," the little creature squeaked loud enough to be heard over Draco.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Narcissa pressed her lips to Draco’s forehead in search of a fever. His skin was so hot, her lips felt burned. The rest of his face, however, was cool to the touch.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Dobby finally lit the chandelier above their heads, allowing Narcissa to get a proper look at Draco’s face. His cheeks were flushed from wailing, predictably. What was worrying, however, was how vividly red his forehead was. Narcissa looked down in his cradle for something that may have burned him, barking at Dobby to do the same when she saw nothing that could have.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>She looked back at Draco just in time to see an alarming lightning bolt shaped laceration appearing on his forehead.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>At a loss, she sank down on her knees and cradled Draco close. His screaming continued.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>“Shh, shh, Mummy's here,” she whispered soothingly. It was all she could do. The wound wasn’t bleeding, seemingly hadn’t come from anything, and she had no idea how to heal it. She lifted her head to look at Dobby and said, “Fetch a Healer. Quickly.” It was meant to come out as a command, but to both of their ears, it sounded more like a plea.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The elf bobbed his head and disappeared with a snap.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Narcissa was left alone with her wailing child in her arms. She held him, feeling more helpless than she ever had before. He must have been in tremendous pain and been so scared; he just kept crying. She felt him clutching at her and had to stop him from grabbing at his head. His sweet little grey eyes were so wide with fear it broke her heart and his voice grew raspy with strain. He looked up at her, seemingly realizing for the first time who was holding him, and cried, “Mama!”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Her heart felt like it was breaking. Her beautiful, clever boy. She had been so proud when he learned her name. Now she wished he hadn’t, just so she wouldn’t have to hear him sob it. He wanted her help, wanted her to make the pain stop, and she couldn’t do anything. She started crying right alongside him and buried her face in his hair so he might not see. His little fists clutched at her robes.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Dobby returned to see his proud lady sitting on her knees, holding her precious child to her chest while they both sobbed wretchedly. He was struck still at the sight. He had never seen her cry before. None of the Malfoys did, as far as he knew. They were a proud, noble house and would never allow themselves to breakdown in front of people like that. But there she was, the lady of the house, crying just as wretchedly as the baby in her arms. It made him want to cry too.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The Healer he had brought with him, however, was unmoved. He rushed forward and knelt to gently extract Draco from his mother’s arms. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Narcissa lifted her head when she felt him trying to and nearly whimpered, “Healer Redgrave,” in relief. She relinquished Draco to him without hesitation.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Healer Redgrave was a stern old man that looked after the children of every Pureblood family of means in the UK. He was at least ninety and had looked after both her sisters, herself, and Lucius when they were children. He had been Draco’s Healer from the moment he was conceived. He knew everything about children’s treatment and illnesses. She felt better knowing he was here. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>He stayed kneeling beside her and laid Draco on his raised knee to examine him. Draco reached his hands for his mother. She took one in hers and pressed a kiss to it, whispering, “Let him see you, darling. Be good for me.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Redgrave pulled out his wand when he finished looking at Draco, prodding the strange laceration, and frowning at him. He cast one quick spell and the laceration on Draco’s forehead glowed white. Whatever it revealed to him seemed to be relieving; he passed Draco back to Narcissa and guided her to stand with him. Once they were standing, he cast a spell that showered Draco’s little head with bright blue sparks and his eyes slipped closed abruptly. He had put him to sleep.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Narcissa looked at him for answers. He patted her on the shoulder; the most comforting the old man could be despite decades as a family Healer. “Phantom pain,” he said by way of explanation. “He’ll be fine in an hour.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Impossible! Phantom pain was a phenomenon that toddlers were supposed to be protected from. They weren’t strong enough to handle it and didn’t have the ability to understand what was happening. Random pain that their parents couldn’t fix would be terrifying before your mummy or daddy could explain why it was happening.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>“How can that be?” she asked. “Children aren’t supposed to experience phantom pain until they’re at least five. Draco is a year old!”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>“His soulmate must have gone through something truly spectacular. Agony, both physical and emotional. Something strong enough to break through the natural protections that children have.” He removed his spectacles and began to clean them with a cloth he produced from his sleeve. “I can’t tell you much more than that. To know what caused this, you would need a Seer.”</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>That much she knew. Her mother had taken her to a Seer when she was eight, to find out exactly who her own soulmate was. She had taken each of her daughters. Draco was supposed to go at eight, just like them, so that she and Lucius could start thinking about his future marriage. If his soulmate was from a decent family, they would reach out and start planning the marriage, the way her parents had for her. If not, they would start arranging a marriage to someone suitable, like her parents had done for Bellatrix and Andromeda, prior to the latter running away.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>She would take him straight to a Seer in the morning. They had to know what had happened to his soulmate and what effect it would have on Draco.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>She thanked Redgrave and he gave her the contact information for a Seer he knew. And then Dobby took him home and she moved to the glider in the window with her son.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Lucius found them there a few hours later. He sat on the footstool in front of her and gave her the news that she had been simultaneously dreading and hoping to hear for years; the Dark Lord had been defeated.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The Seer would have to wait.</em>
