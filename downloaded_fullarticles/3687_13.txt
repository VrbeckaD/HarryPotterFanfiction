    <p>Harry jerked at the collar of his dress Auror robes for the hundredth time.  They were beyond itchy and he felt foolish wearing them in the summer heat.  Ginny swatted his hand away.</p>
<p>“Don’t.  You’ll stretch it out,” she scolded, sounding for all the world like her mother, though Harry knew not to tell her so, lest he keep his bollocks intact.  </p>
<p>“I don’t care,” he grumbled.</p>
<p>“Well, since you’re shit at laundry spells, you should keep your hands off it.  You have to wear it all week.”  She reached up as if to straighten it, seemed think better of it, and put her hand down.  “Maybe they have a laundry at this posh French hotel.”</p>
<p>Harry detected a note of jealousy in Ginny’s voice, but he chose to ignore it.  Things were on shaky ground as it was- the fire that had been present early in their relationship had somehow fizzled out, and he no longer understood where he stood with her.  They’d lived together in Grimmauld Place for a couple of years, but it was finally in good enough shape to sell, so they were talking about moving to a new place.</p>
<p>Problem was, they’d been talking about it for six months.  </p>
<p>It seemed every time it came up, they would mutually acknowledge that yes, they needed to look at flats in the city.  However, after so many passive conversations about it, Harry began to wonder if maybe Ginny didn’t <i>want</i> to move into a new flat.  It wasn’t that she wanted to stay in the once decrepit Most Ancient and Noble House of Black- she took every opportunity she could to complain about the state of it.  So most likely it was that she didn’t want to move into a new flat with <i>him.</i></p>
<p>He could understand her hesitancy at breaking it off with him.  He was notoriously moody these days.  Work at the Ministry was chaotic as usual, and since Kingsley had been promoted, it had fallen to Harry to take over as Head Auror of the Greater London Area. </p>
<p>He loved his job, most days, and it made him feel productive and useful.  But it seemed to take up every waking moment of his time and attention.  And maybe he might have been a little distant from his girlfriend.  When they fought, she’d say it was too hard to share him with the entire Wizarding world.  He wasn’t quite sure what she meant by that, but it had to be that work became his life or something similar.</p>
<p>But in the end, didn’t he owe it to the witches and wizards of England to keep them safe?  Wasn’t that why he existed in the first place?  </p>
<p>Which was why he volunteered to be the one to go on a week-long trip to Paris to a  Conference on International Relationships in the Auror community.  It seemed like a good idea to get out of the office for a while, even if it was work-related.  A change of scenery might do him good- or so Ginny had said when she pushed him to go.  It occurred to him that she might have motives for making him leave, but he really couldn’t be arsed to care.  </p>
<p>“Harry, we need to talk.” Ginny was chewing her lip. </p>
<p>Harry checked the time.  His portkey was due to activate any moment.</p>
<p>“Can it wait?  I’m about to have to-”</p>
<p>“I think we need to break up.”  Ginny said quickly.</p>
<p>Harry froze.  “What?”</p>
<p>Ginny winced.  “Yeah, sorry about the timing, but won’t it be nice to get away?  You really need the vacation, and this is as close as it comes-”</p>
<p>“I mean-”  Harry blinked rapidly.  “I mean, I thought we were okay?”  It sounded like a lie to his ears.</p>
<p>Ginny gave him a withering look.  “We haven’t been okay since...since, I don’t know.  What I do know is that I really need to do some time alone- really try to figure things out by myself-”</p>
<p>“Bullshit,” Harry narrowed his eyes.  </p>
<p>“Fine,” Ginny sighed.  “It’s not me, it’s you.”</p>
<p>Harry sputtered.</p>
<p>“All you do is work, sleep, and then work again.  When you’re home, you’re unhappy.  You never seem to hear me when I talk to you, we never have sex anymore, and when we do, you’re a million miles away, and I swear to Merlin if I don’t get out of this nightmare I am going to fucking lose my shit.”  She was waving her arms around by the time she finished.</p>
<p>Harry heaved a deep breath.  She had a point.  He was a crap boyfriend.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Ginny.  You’re right.”</p>
<p>She looked shocked.  “Well, that’s unexpected.  I thought you’d be more... upset...but I guess this is best for us both.  I don’t think you even know what you want for your life, Harry.  And neither of us can figure out what we want stuck together in a stale relationship.”</p>
<p>Harry was silent for a moment.  The chipped painted ceramic cat sitting on the table that served as his portkey began to vibrate slightly.  </p>
<p>“Well, that’s me,” he said lamely. </p>
<p>“Have a good trip, darling, I’ll be moved out by the time you get back.”  She kissed him on the cheek as he reached for the cat.</p>
<p>“Sure, yeah,” he said distractedly.  His fingers came in contact with the cool ceramic and the world twisted around him and he was wrenched through space and time.</p>
<p>He came to an abrupt landing in the entryway of the Paris portkey office, tumbling over to his left, running smack into someone.</p>
<p>“Oi!  Lookout, this is silk,” a distinct smooth low voice came from behind him.  </p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>Harry straightened his robes again and turned to face the voice.  Draco Malfoy stood about a full head taller than Harry, and he was dressed impeccably as usual, his robes fitted, accuating his lithe, strong body.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Malfoy, didn’t see you there,” Harry sighed.</p>
<p>“Maybe you need your glasses checked,” Malfoy sneered.  Or maybe it wasn’t a sneer.  Harry looked at him quizzically.  Malfoy was reading a small folded piece of parchment in his hand.</p>
<p>“Actually,” Harry said absently, checking his pockets for his own papers regarding the location of the hotel, “it <i>has</i> been a while since I’ve had my eyes checked.”</p>
<p>Malfoy didn’t answer but spun to stomp up to the Portkey office’s reception desk.  He asked a few questions in smooth, perfect French, and was given an answer along with a wink and suggestive smile by the wizard manning the booth.  Malfoy smirked and leaned on the counter, continuing the conversation Harry couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Harry blushed and looked away.  His paper told him the floo address, so he moved to get into the queue.  Soon he was swirling through the floo network and landing in the lobby of a very posh, decadent hotel.  He followed the crowd of uniformed wizards and witches, all patrons of the conference, he assumed, and waited to check in and get his key.  </p>
<p>It was taking a moment, so his mind wandered back to Malfoy.  </p>
<p>Was he gay?  He seemed to take the flirting in stride, but then again, who knew if it was real or just some way for Malfoy to get what he wanted.  That seemed more likely, didn’t it?</p>
<p>Somehow, mostly thanks to Harry, Malfoy had survived the trials after the war fairly unscathed.  Harry had submitted evidence and witness statements from himself, Hermione, Ron, and Luna that Malfoy had been just as much a prisoner in his home as the rest were.  Luna testified that Malfoy had snuck food down to her, Griphook, and Ollivander during her stay, and Ron knew he could have told Bellatrix LeStrange their identity, but defied her and stayed silent.  Harry wasn’t sure if Malfoy had done that intentionally, but he had later learned that Bellatrix was an accomplished and powerful Legimens, and could have pulled the information from his mind.  But Malfoy had used his Occlumency to hide it from her.  </p>
<p>Harry had testified about Malfoy and Dumbledore’s final words to one another, and Dumbledore’s implicit forgiveness, and the Wizengamot saw reason, releasing him without punishment.  Lucius was remanded to the Manor, and Narcissa had left him to live with her sister.  </p>
<p>But Harry didn’t know much about what happened after the war besides that.  </p>
<p>He’d been too busy with work, nonstop it seemed, to keep track of Draco Malfoy.  He’d heard that the former Slytherin had got a lower-level job at the Ministry with the curse-breakers and had worked his way up to a supervisory position as quickly as Harry had.  Which explained why he was at the conference.</p>
<p>“Monsieur Potter?”  a thick accent broke him from his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Harry fumbled, approaching the counter, setting his bag down. “I mean, erm, pardonne moi?”  The witch behind the counter smiled tightly and continued in neatly accented English.  </p>
<p>“Here is the packet for the first day, and your room keys.  If you need anything, call seven on the floo.  Next!”</p>
<p>Harry moved to the side, grateful for the French people’s inability to be impressed by him.  Every time he was in the country, even if someone knew his name, they treated him as they would anyone else, and it was a relief.  </p>
<p>The lift was crowded, and Harry spied Malfoy in the back, talking to a familiar brunette man.  Was that the man from the portkey office?  Harry didn’t want to turn back to see for sure, so he strained to hear their conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn’t understand French in the slightest, and they were whispering.  The rest of the lift riders were ignoring them, so Harry tried to as well.</p>
<p>They made two stops before he got to the fifth floor where his room was, and he looked back and saw it was just he and Malfoy and the portkey bloke.  He smiled awkwardly and tried to will the lift to move faster.  </p>
<p>After a short silent ride, the door opened and Harry very nearly dashed out into the corridor and scanned the doors for his room number.  To his relief, Malfoy and his companion went the opposite direction.  </p>
<p>Harry watched the numbers descend as he walked, realizing he should have gone the other way as well.  The pamphlet on the hotel had stated that all floors circled a large atrium, so if he kept walking, he’d end up back where he started.</p>
<p>The numbers started going up again and soon he found his room.  He sighed and used his key, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>“Wow,” he whispered to himself as he entered the room.  It was decorated in gold and white, and the high ceiling had been charmed to show the deep blue sky.  There were a few lonely clouds drifting by, and Harry watched as they joined and floated away.</p>
<p>He dropped his bag and folder and stipped off his robes.  He might have a while before dinner was served to rest, so he got down to his boxers and flopped back onto the soft duvet, sinking into the mattress.  It felt wonderful.  He closed his eyes and relaxed, pushing away all thoughts of Ginny, the DMLE, Malfoy, and the long boring conference that would devour his week.</p>
<p>He was almost asleep when he heard a noise through the wall.</p>
<p>His eyes popped open and he waited, hearing it again.  It sounded like a moan.</p>
<p>Harry smirked.  Someone was having it off in the middle of the day.  </p>
<p>There was another moan, and an answering male moan.</p>
<p>Harry sat up straight.  <i>It was Malfoy, of course it was.</i></p>
<p>Harry moaned a different sort of moan and flopped back onto the bed and covered his face with a pillow.</p>
<p><i>Of course</i> Malfoy was in the room next to his, they were coming from the same Ministry.  <i>Of course</i> he was having sex in the middle of the day, and <i>of course</i> it was with the attractive bloke from the portkey office.</p>
<p>Harry could picture them, tangled together, fucking.</p>
<p>Was Malfoy on top?  He had no idea what the criteria for being a top during gay sex was, he’d never thought about it before.  It seemed an appropriate time as ever to think about it, so he considered what he knew about Malfoy.</p>
<p>Malfoy was bossy and a perfectionist, and a control freak by all accounts.  He seemed like he would be a firm hand, but maybe not.  Maybe he liked to be fucked, pounded into the mattress, submitting with his pert little perfect arse up in the air, face in the pillows, moaning as he wanked himself in time with thrusts-</p>
<p>Harry’s hand had somehow wandered down to his cock and was stroking it through his pants.  Was it weird?  Getting turned on by his old nemesis and coworker sort of weird, right?</p>
<p>The moans grew louder, and Harry was sure he recognized Malfoy’s voice, coming lower through the wall than the other.  </p>
<p>So he must be the one sprawled on the bed with the brunet bloke holding him down and fucking him.  Harry found he could picture it very well, the moaning spurning on the fantasy.</p>
<p>Harry paused fondling himself to discard his pants and spread out.  He grabbed his wand and held it to his palm and mumbled a lubrication spell, filling his hand with warm wetness.  He curled his fist and flipped over to his stomach, the two men in his mind fucking hard, the sound of skin slapping being heard through the wall.  </p>
<p>Harry pushed his hard and leaking cock through the circle of his tight fist, muffling his own moan with the pillow as he imagined the bloke next door sinking into Malfoy’s tight hole, and began to thrust in earnest.  </p>
<p>The moans through the wall turned to cries of pleasure and he heard Malfoy’s voice clearly through the wall.</p>
<p>“Je vais jouir!” he shouted.  Harry wasn’t sure, but it sounded like Malfoy was about to come. </p>
<p>Harry fucked his fist with vigor, biting his pillow to keep quiet.  There was a shout and he knew Malfoy came, and his own orgasm overtook him, and he thrust through it, smearing his come on the mattress.  The was a second shout from the companion, and then there was silence.</p>
<p>Harry heaved breaths and wiped sweat on the duvet.  He rolled over and looked at the sticky mess.  He vanished it with a flick of his wand, and then sprawled back out.  </p>
<p>Well, that was something.  </p>
<p>As the post-orgasmic haze began to fade, guilt and shame began to sink in.  </p>
<p>Harry covered his face with his hands and suppressed a moan, knowing his neighbors could hear him.  He’d just wanked to the sound of Draco Malfoy getting buggered by some rando from the portkey office.  And he’d come harder than he had in <i>years</i>.</p>
<p>Sure he had a fantasy life.  When he could find time to.  </p>
<p>Ginny was out of town often, so he had to make do with his hand, and he had plenty of wank magazines stashed in Grimmauld.  </p>
<p>And maybe every once in awhile, he’d have a look at one of Sirius’ old gay porn mags just for fun.  No big deal.  The wizards in those magazines had 70’s sideburns and were very hairy, but he enjoyed when they winked and bent over to spread their cheeks and show off their arsehole.  </p>
<p>Harry liked anal sex more than anything.  Ginny sort of knew this, and thankfully she was rather adventurous and preferred it some nights.  She was wild in bed, and he’d even let her peg him- it was only a small sized dildo in the strap-on, but it made her happy, and it had felt pretty good.</p>
<p>Maybe that was what was wrong with their relationship.  They were both tops.  She was forever flipping him to his back and riding him, which he didn’t mind- after a hard day of work, he had little energy to meet the needs of his insatiable girlfriend.  Well, ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>He thought maybe she’d taken a lover while out of town.  The notion didn’t bother him terribly if he thought about it.  He sure as hell wasn’t trying very hard in the relationship, that was clear.  Ginny really deserved to be treated well, and maybe it was for the best.</p>
<p>Satisfied that he’d narrowly avoided an emotional crisis, Harry got up and dressed for dinner.  He rolled his eyes at the dress robes he’d just taken off, and pulled his favorite jeans out of his bag- the ones without holes- and a clean t shirt.  He shoved his feet into his Vans, and pulled on a muggle blazer.  He looked in the mirror and shrugged.  Looked fine to him.</p>
<p>His hair wouldn’t stay down, of course, so he gave up and tucked his wand in the inside pocket of the blazer and grabbed his room key and headed out.</p>
<p>“Oh, Potter,” Malfoy said pleasantly, “headed to the dining room?”</p>
<p>Harry turned and raised his eyebrows in surprise.  Malfoy was locking the door to his room, impeccably dressed for dinner in blue robes, the portkey bloke looking between the two of them.</p>
<p>“Erm, yeah, headed down now.” Harry saw the plea in Malfoy’s eyes and sighed.  “Yeah, the opening speaker is in a few, so yeah, headed down.  Want to join me?”</p>
<p>Malfoy smiled brightly and turned to his companion.  He rattled off a few words in French and pointed to the lift down the corridor.  The bloke frowned and shot Harry a murderous look and crossed his arms, clearly pouting.  Malfoy spoke in soothing tones and pulled the bloke toward the lift, leaving Harry to wait, annoyed.</p>
<p>After a farewell that was clearly insincere, Malfoy waited until the lift doors closed and sagged, an annoyed look on his face replacing the smile.</p>
<p>He marched over to Harry and huffed.  </p>
<p>“Well, Potter?  Any idea how we can get down to the dining room without running into clingy Frenchmen?”  He sniffed and brushed the front of his robes.</p>
<p>Harry blinked.  “Yeah, I saw a freight lift around the other side- just come on.”  He started off, kind of relieved for Malfoy being his usual self.  Malfoy caught up.</p>
<p>“You don’t mind, do you?”  he asked.</p>
<p>“That you’re a poof?”  Harry shot back, regretting his choice of words, but rushing to continue.  “No, not a problem.  Sirius Black was gay, you know.  My godfather?  Yeah, and Seamus and Dean from school?  Also gay, so yeah, doesn’t bother me a bit.”</p>
<p>Malfoy had stopped walking.  Harry stopped and turned, rolling his eyes at Malfoy who had his arms folded and a smug, amused smile on his face.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t at all the meaning of my question, Potter, but good to know.”</p>
<p>Harry groaned and turned to keep walking.  Daft idiot, he was.  </p>
<p>Malfoy jogged to catch up again.  “I just meant do you mind if I accompany you to the dining room.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Harry said.  “Yeah, s’fine.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for covering for me, I know Francois from when we were children, and I really wasn’t trying to make a habit out of blowing off a little steam with him, you know?”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know, but he nodded like he did anyway.</p>
<p>The found the other lift, being used by some house elves to move a large amount of baggage.</p>
<p>“Oh good!” Malfoy exclaimed.  “My luggage has arrived.”  He stood to the side so the elves could levitate it out and down the hall.  He stepped in and stared at Harry.  “You coming?”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head.  “Don’t know what I was expecting, of course it’s your luggage.  Half your house in there?”</p>
<p>Malfoy grinned.  “Basically.  I plan on spending holiday time when this is over.  Stay an extra week or so.  Never know what I might need in the span of a week.”</p>
<p>His voice was almost suggestive.  Flashes of Harry’s fantasy ran through his mind.  He shook it off, worried Malfoy might be able to read his thoughts.</p>
<p>The doors slid open again, showing they had landed in the back of the kitchens.  Some squeaking elves grabbed them by the hands and lead them quickly through the steaming pot and good smells to the door to the spacious dining room.  </p>
<p>Harry smiled a tight smile at Malfoy before looking for his assigned table.  </p>
<p>“Hello lads!”  Gibson’s cheerful voice met him as he found the table with the tiny Union Jack Wizard flag floating above it.  He looked back and saw that Malfoy had followed him, and was to be seated next to him.  Perfect.</p>
<p>Apparently Malfoy and Gibson were great friends, because they bantered back and forth until the food was served.  There were a few empty seats at the table, and Gibson assured them that the occupants would be there by the morning when the conference officially began.  </p>
<p>Harry poked at his dinner, not sure what he was eating, until Malfoy sighed, sounding put out, and snapped to call a server over, speaking in rapid French.</p>
<p>Soon a steak and kidney pie with a side of garlic mash appeared at Harry’s place setting, the mystery food now gone.</p>
<p>Harry looked over at Malfoy who was back to ignoring him in favor for gossiping with Gibson- he was head of the Spell Damage Insurance department, and apparently it was a lot more exciting than it sounded like.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged and tucked into his food.  It was delicious!  He hadn’t had pie this good since Hogwarts.  It wasn’t a favorite of Molly Weasley’s, so Harry hadn’t had it in some time.  And Ginny missed the cooking gene in their family- that was reserved for Ron.  So having a complete meal like this was a treat.</p>
<p>Soon he was sighing with a full belly contentedly.  He pushed back from the table and stretched out, looking around the room.  It occurred to him that he was now a free man, just having been dumped, and whatnot.  But he’d had such a satisfying wank earlier, he didn’t feel like trying to pull; so he told himself it was alright to look around the room and see what there was on offer.</p>
<p>There was a full table of women at the India table, wrapped in bright gorgeous silks, laughing and talking.  They were beautiful, but looked like a tight-knit bunch, like a bridal hen party the night before the wedding.  </p>
<p>The French were generally unimpressed by Harry physically as well as his celebrity, so that was right out.  There were several tables from muggle war-torn countries with occupants that seemed to be having glaring contests.  The Australians seemed drunk already, and the South American Countries were said to have just arrived at the hotel.  There was always the American table- those birds reportedly loved English accents and liked to let loose when overseas.  But all Harry saw were men.  There were three about his age and a two older ones.  They were loud, of course, saying words like, ‘bro,’ and ‘totally,’ but they seemed nice enough.</p>
<p>“Looking for dessert?” Malfoy was suddenly close to his ear, looking in the direction Harry was staring.</p>
<p>“No! I mean, no, just seeing who’s here,” Harry blushed, noting that even he heard the lie in his voice.  “I don’t, you know, go that way, or whatever.”</p>
<p>“Or whatever,” Malfoy hummed.  “I could go for a little bit of whatever, myself.  How about the one with the desperate need for a haircut?”</p>
<p>Harry stared at Malfoy.  “Didn’t you just come from a shag?  Are you trying to break a record or something?”</p>
<p>Malfoy sniggered behind his hand.  “Not exactly, but I <i>am</i> on holiday.  Besides, I didn’t mean for right now, but prospects. For later.”  He was looking sideways at Harry, but there was a twinkle in his eyes.  </p>
<p>“You’re having me on, mate,” Harry snorted.  “No way that bloke is gay.  Look at him!  He practically screams hetero.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, sounds like a challenge,” Malfoy smiled.  “You’re on, Potter.  I shall have him in my bed before the end of the week, or…  What terms shall we set?”</p>
<p>Harry pretended to think.  “Hmm, how about the loser has to attend the last two days of the convention and take notes for the winner so they can do what they want.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I like that,” Malfoy grinned.  “You’re on.”  They shook hands quickly, a small jolt traveling up Harry’s arm.  Malfoy didn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p>“Time to bait the hook,” Malfoy stood, brushing off his robes, drawing the eyes of nearly everyone in the room by how good he looked, and made his way casually through the tables.</p>
<p>He paused at the American’s table and pointed to the shaggy haired bloke.  Harry could tell he was pretending to recognize him. The other lads at the table were puffing their chests up and sizing up Malfoy.  He met each one of their eyes, seductive smile in place, and one by one, they looked away, blushing slightly.  </p>
<p>The bloke Malfoy had picked looked like he was desperately trying to remember where they had met, and Malfoy laughed it off and shook his head and swished away, wiggling his fingers farewell in their direction.</p>
<p>As soon as Malfoy was far enough away, the American wizards started whispering amongst themselves, firing questions at the shaggy haired fellow.  </p>
<p>Harry looked around for Malfoy but he’d gone.</p>
<p>He sighed and said goodbye to Gibson, and headed to the lobby to take the main lifts.</p>
<p>He took a quick shower and collapsed into his bed, still full of food and worn out from travel.  He wondered how Malfoy knew which wizards were tops, and if he’d hear them fucking through the wall when he inevitably got him into his bed.</p>
