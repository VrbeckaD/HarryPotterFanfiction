    <p>The first time they heard about each other was thanks to Newt.</p><p>Leta and Newt had come closer in their school days. They were marginalized, neither of them fit. They had found this way, a partner in themselves. In their initial meetings they began to get to know each other. Newt discovered that Leta had no family other than her father: Corvus Lestrange. Her mother died at the time of giving birth; She also had a brother, son of his father's second wife but according to Leta, he died when he was a baby and so Newt realized that she did not like to talk about it.</p><p>-and what about you? - she asked him</p><p>-I?...-</p><p>- you have a mother? Father? Siblings?-</p><p>-ammh .. yes, I have my mother, she breeds hippogriffs ... and my brother. My father died when I was 4 years old ... -</p><p>-Oh! I ... I'm… sorry ... - interrupted Leta</p><p>-Yes... thanks ... as I was very small, I do not have many memories of him anyway. My brother Theseus talks to me about him often and shows me photographs. He esteemed him very much. After he died ... my mother had to work twice as hard and Theseus took seriously the role of man in the house. He takes great care of my mother and me. I guess that's why he decided to become Auror-</p><p>-Oh, then it's an Auror? -</p><p>-Yeah, well ... Auror junior-</p><p>-Why you do not sound very pleased about that? - she scoffed</p><p>-What? No! Of course I'm happy for him ... he's just ... well Theseus is ... - Newt was trying to find the right words- he and I are very different ... he's very ... systematic and somewhat overprotective-</p><p>Leta understood that her brother was her antithesis and why maybe none of them fit very well with each other, but as she listened to Newt talk about him, she realized that there was undoubtedly great affection among the Scamander brothers.</p><p>-And he is also a hugger- Newt finished with a small tone of annoyance. Leta laughed, Newt smiled at her. After a moment she said:</p><p>- It must be nice-</p><p>-What? ... Do you think Theseus is nice? - replied Newt a little shy and uncomfortable. She will have liked his brother?</p><p>-What?! Do not! I mean ... well, I do not know ... but I know you so I guess it must be nice ... .- she was trying to find the words. She was blushing. - But no, I did not mean that ... I mean it must be nice to have a brother who loves you and cares for you ... a family ... that's what I mean- Leta under the eye avoiding looking at Newt</p><p>Newt looked at her. -Oh ... well yes, it is ... sometimes it can be frustrating but ... - he smiled- it's good to know that someone is there for you-</p><p>-I'd like to have one of those. A family that makes me sad again - someone who cares about me like they do for you ... but I guess some are more fortunate- Leta opened a book trying not to seem to be affected. It was good to know that Newt had a family. One that would like it. But she could not avoid comparing it with his and well ... the differences were gigantic.</p><p>-Well, you have me- said Newt timidly. Leta looked up from the book and looked at him, then smiled.</p><p>- Yes… I do-</p><p>Both looked for a moment shy but with affection.</p><p>-Let's go to dinner? - Newt asked</p><p>-Of course- Leta answered leaving her book</p><p>-Hey Leta .. about the task of Charms ... -</p><p>-You can take mine after dinner-</p><p>-Thank you…-</p><p>And while they were talking they went to the Great Hall. They were good times. That was the first time Leta heard of Theseus.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For Theseus it happened months later in the Christmas holidays. He had taken a few days off from work to spend the holidays at home. His younger brother also returned from Hogwarts although he seemed a little more anxious. He wrote many letters to someone and Theseus guessed that it was a friend.<br/>
Shortly before the Christmas Eve dinner, he and Newt were in the stables with hippogriffs. Newt loved being with them, Theseus also liked him but he knew that magical animals were not his thing. He take this moment to ask his brother about the school.</p><p>-Everything is fine- replied Newt</p><p>-What about the classes? – asked again Theseus</p><p>-I think it's good, I'm anxious to study Care for Magical Creatures but for now I really like Defense Against the Dark Arts ... mainly by Professor Dumbledore-</p><p>-Why I'm not surprised- theseus mocked at the mention of his brother to the matter of Care of Magical Creatures- but you'll have to wait until the third year for that ... and it's true, I also studied with Dumbledore. He is a great teacher.</p><p>Newt nodded</p><p>-And what about your colleagues? Make friends?</p><p>- Yes ... No ... well, everyone does not like me- Theseus made a face - But I have more spare time to dedicate myself to look for and take care of creatures-</p><p>Theseus smiled at this latest cometary. It was classic for his brother to feel more comfortable among animals than among his own species. And he deduced this way, that the lack of friends of his brother besides the rejection of the people was also because he did not try to look for their company either.</p><p>-All right, and I suppose then that one of your creatures has learned to write and that's why you write it almost daily, right?</p><p>Newt looked up and looked at his brother as if he had caught him doing something wrong. Theseus laughed at his reaction.</p><p>-Well, do you think I have not noticed? You are not so subtle.</p><p>Newt blushed.</p><p>-Then this friend of yours ... because you have a true friend? A human friend</p><p>-Yes I have - responded Newt avoiding the look of Theseus</p><p>-How you met him?-</p><p>-Well .. None of us fit into the school ... so we ... we approach ... I guess-</p><p>-And well, how is he? -</p><p>- Well ... she is ... -</p><p>-AH! Then it's a she? - Newt blushed- Newton Scamander you have a female friend ... now I'm surprised- Theseus said funny noticing how red his brother was, he laughed.</p><p>-Relax…. So how is she? -</p><p>Newt calmed down.</p><p>-She is very intelligent ... and brave ... and kind ... and she goes in my same year only in Slytherin ... and ... -</p><p>-Is she pretty? - interrupted Theseus</p><p>-What?! ... ammh ... yes ... I guess she is ... - Newt turned red again. Theseus smiled-</p><p>-What is her name?-</p><p>-Leta ... Leta Lestrange-</p><p>Newt watched his brother when he said her name, expecting some negative reaction to his friend's last name. To his relief, this did not happen. Theseus knew that his brother was analyzing his reaction but what could he say about someone he did not know? It was not fair to judge someone for her family despite their reputation. Besides, if her brother was her friend it meant that she must have something good.</p><p>-She likes you? -</p><p>-Yes-</p><p>-And you like her? -</p><p>-Yes…. Yes, it seems to me that-</p><p>-Do you trust her? - Theseus knew that it sounded something hard. Newt looked directly at Theseus.</p><p>-Yes I do-</p><p>They looked at each other for a moment, and then Theseus smiled.</p><p>-Well, I'm glad you have someone to hang out with-</p><p>Newt sighed in relief.</p><p>-Although you stop writing her so much ... at home they must be tired of seeing owls come and go at all times- said Theseus</p><p>-She stayed at Hogwarts - said Newt</p><p>-Oh ... Did not she go home? -</p><p>-She doesn’t go home on vacation ... it's ... complicated-</p><p>Theseus understood Newt's reason for writing to her every day. He is trying not to make her feel she was alone. That was his little brother, always taking care of all that damaged creature that needs it-</p><p>-Well, then send my regards and a happy Christmas from me ... and some mommy cakes-</p><p>-Yes, of course ... I just thought about asking mom if I could take some for Leta ... -</p><p>-I'm sure she will not object- Theseus told Newt taking him by the shoulder to walk- Now go, we have to wash for dinner.</p><p>And they went like that to the interior of the house.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That was the first time Theseus and Leta listened to each other. It was the first of many first times.</p>
