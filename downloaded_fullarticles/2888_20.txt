    <p>It had been a very normal day of listening to Sirius and James plot on ways Prongs should ask Lily out to Hogsmeade, as they made their way to Transfiguration class. </p><p>Â </p><p>"Could you be serious for once Pads? I really want her to say yes this time." James whined at Sirius as they turned yet another corner. "And by the way, I'm not going to chase her as Prongs down the corridors and then ask her out." They got into class and it was one of those rare occasions where Professor McGonagall was late to class. Taking this as an opportunity to continue their discussion, Sirius merely shrugged his shoulders and commented, "I'm just saying, she'll be far more pleased it was simply James Fleamont Potter and not some mental stag with a 'kill Evans kink' and she'll say yes because she did not get trampled by a deer that day." James simply scowled at Sirius and turned to Remus. "Say, Moony, you're wiser than all of us put together. What'd you say?" Remus replied after getting his quill and books out, "For the record, Pads, Lily would very well hex Prongs the moment he chased her." James then threw Sirius a 'I told you so' look, "And I'm no relationship expert but I'm sure a decent smile and polite, "Would you go out on a date with me to Hogsmeade," would be your one-way ticket to seeing Evans smile and say yes." Hearing this James clapped Remus on the back and turned to face the front of the class, seeing as Professor McGonagall had already entered.</p><p>Remus could tell Sirius was acting up that day as if he were anxious or maybe even nervous. Sirius Orion Black and nervous?? Never! But Remus could not help but think so by noticing Sirius's smallest actions, like how he was very jittery and kept biting his nails and as of now, Sirius was rapidly shaking his leg under his desk. He spoke lesser than usual and his mind was elsewhere. Remus blamed his knowledge of Sirius's usual actions to his keen eye, not thinking much of it.</p><p>Professor McGonagall's voice shook Remus out of his thoughts as she walked towards Sirius, seeing as he wasn't paying attention. "I would greatly appreciate, Mr Black, if you wouldn't send notes to your friends in the middle of my lesson. Now, I'm sure if you do have a message, the whole class should hear it as well." There were small chuckles from people around the class, knowing that Sirius was mischievous but Remus noticed that Sirius was trying his best to keep the note out of Professor McGonagall's reach. However, with a flick of her wand, the note went flying into her hands. Sirius's eyes went wide and his pupils shrank. The next words to escape Professor McGonagall's mouth sent Sirius running out of class.</p><p>"I love you Remus."</p>
