  <span>Harry took a deep breath and opened his eyes. He realizes he is lying naked on some sort of bench in a brilliant bright white room. He swivels his head around and realizes he's been in this building before 'its kings cross station' and then 'why is it so clean?'. Suddenly he hears a soft whimper and he whips his head to the source, he gets a little close and crouches down to see what looks like a small flayed-looking naked child, barely alive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You cannot help." says a voice, ringing in the empty station. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry jumps around in shock and sees the newcomer is a tall skeletal form wrapped in a large dark cloak.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>" Who are you?" Harry asks. "I would have hoped that would be fairly obvious. However, I suppose I will have to not judge too harshly as you have after all just been through a rather traumatic event. I am Death, young master." Death ends the little speech with a half bow and a flourish.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry just stands there with his mouth gaping open 'Okay so that's Death. It makes sense as I should be dead right now. Not sure why I'm meeting death itself, they have got to be busy. Maybe they have' </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Death cuts his internal freak out short by saying " yes I am rather busy but you, as I said earlier, are my master. You shouldn't have died this soon. I wasn't expecting you for another hundred years or so."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>" Oh you can read my thoughts" Harry looked down as he mumbled only to then look back up sheepishly as he realized he was still naked. As he had the thought a neat stack of robes appeared beside him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> Death laughed as he rushed to put them on. " It's not exactly anything I haven't seen before Harry. Why don't you take a seat we have lots to discuss." Death took a seat on a newly appeared armchair and gestured harry towards the other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>" To put what would otherwise be a long story short. Albus Dumbledore has manipulated your life to this outcome since before you were born. He was losing his second war despite having organized it you see the first war was planned between himself and his lover Gellert Grindelwald to take control of the wizarding world. Albus controlling the light and Gellert the dark. When Albus saw that this wasn't working as expected, he betrayed Gellert so that he could maintain his power and influence. As the years went by he lost some of this power and influence. So he began plotting another war. He influenced one of his students with the use of potions and charms like the Imperious. Once Voldemort had come to power however, he lost a lot of his influence over him. So he planted his 'information' around him in the hopes that Voldemort would do what he wanted without realizing it l. The last piece of 'information' that Albus planted and Voldemort took always the fake prophecy. This resulted in the death of Voldemort that Albus could use to his advantage, it also has the bonus of you giving him access to you, you're money and your seats on the Wizengamot. Giving him even more power than he has before."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Wait, wait, wait, you're telling me that if it wasn't for Dumbledore my parents would still be alive!?" Harry interrupted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Yes I'm afraid so" Death replied in a sorrowful tone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Harry went off on a rant about Dumbledore that had some very colourful swears in it until something clicked"what money?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You have access to more than one vault at Gringotts harry. That one was just for your education. Albus has in the time since your parents died taken over one million galleons just for himself. He has also paid others using those vaults."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"That bastard! Okay, so what about the seats on the Wizengamot. What do you mean he took them. Why in the world would I have any seat in government?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You are, at least, Lord potter and Lord black and therefore would have two very powerful seats on the Wizengamot. Albus claimed proxy illegally to use these seats to pass laws almost uncontested and control wizarding Britain even further." Death finished for a moment to let Harry take it all in</span>
</p><p>
  <span> "he also put several blocks and leeches on you over the years. The main three being a power block, a soul bond block, and a gender block" Death stated calmly preparing for the oncoming shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A gender block, does that mean what I think it means?" Harry whispered rather quietly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes I'm afraid it does, you were born Harriet Evans Potter"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm a girl... Oh, my Gods, I'm a GIRL. That's such a relief. Wait why are you telling me all this? It's not like I can do anything with this knowledge unless that is the point and this is my hell."Harry wondered out loud.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, Harry I'm glad you asked. I'm going to send you back in time so that you can deal with that old coot." Death stated with their voice rising to a snarl towards the end. Harry just looked at death in confusion but also in hope.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What, H-How, WHEN?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I'm going to send you back, with most of your memories, to when you were either last dead or close to death"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What do you mean last dead. I could understand almost dead but I think I would remember being dead?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You have died twice in your life. The first was when you were a toddler and your aunt and uncle locked you in the cupboard but forgot about you, you died of dehydration and they panicked and called Dumbledore who did some basic necromancy, which I allowed, to bring you back. He wiped both you and your relatives' memories of it. The second time was shortly before your eleventh birthday when your uncle got very drunk and pushed you down the stairs in his alcohol-fuelled rage, once again Dumbledore came to fix it. You have nearly died at least once a year since then." Death indignantly informed Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I would have sent you to when you were a toddler but it would be hard for you to accomplish anything at that age so I would recommend the time before your eleventh birthday so that you can get more done."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry took a deep breath and ordered his thoughts "Is there anything else I need to know or can you send me back now?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Death smiled"I can send you now. I would recommend going to the goblins as soon as possible, they don't take kindly to theft and should be willing to help you out." Harry nodded in agreement."I wish you the best of luck young master, I can't wait to see what havoc you wreak." And with a wave of Death's hand, Harry felt a pulling sensation in his heart as he disappeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Death at contemplating for a moment before giving a small laugh "This should be fun."</span>
