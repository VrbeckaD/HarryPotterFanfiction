  <strong>September, 1971.</strong>
</p><p>She gripped the covers of her bed tightly, hearing screams coming from outside of her room. Slowly, she shrugged herself off the blanket, slipping her feet in her slippers and making her way to the door, though, before she could open it, she heard the screeching voice of her mother again. "Sirius Orion Black wake your sister up right now or I will make sure she'll never want to leave that room ever again!"</p><p>It seemed like she had slept in again, she groaned mentally.</p><p>"Calm down, she's just bloody sleeping."</p><p>Hermione bit down a smile. She could picture him rolling his eyes at her. While she didn't want to face the wrath of her mother, she definitely didn't want her to get mad at Sirius too. Turning the door knob, she left the comfort of her bedroom and descended the staircase, padding to the kitchen. Kreacher was standing in front of the stove, while the rest of the family surrounded the large table.</p><p>"Good morning," she said as she plastered a bright smile and approached them. She wanted to distract her mother, no matter how poor her attempt may be.</p><p>"When are we leaving? Do you think I should pack more books? Wait, Sirius do you mind if I put some of my stuff with yours?"</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes. "Good morning to you too, but I am not letting you get excited over books today. You should be thinking more about how you get to go to Hogwarts with me."</p><p>"Sadly, I am," she granted with a defeated expression.</p><p>Her twin narrowed his eyes at her and asked, "What's that supposed to mean?"</p><p>"What she wants to say is that," Regulus began as he put his arm around her shoulders and gave her a smile, "she would much rather go to school with me instead."</p><p>She grinned and nodded vigorously. "Oh, yes. You're practically the same height, so no one will notice who's who."</p><p>Once Walburga raised her wand, everyone quieted down and stared at her, not surprised at all by her stance.</p><p>"That's enough! Be silent and let me remind you of what <em>must</em> happen when you get to Hogwarts." She glared at the twins and continued, "You two will be sorted in Slytherin and make it known that you are part of the noble and most ancient house of Black. Interact with purebloods and purebloods only. I would better hope that's clear!"</p><p>Sirius pinched the bridge of his nose and Hermione watched the woman wearily. Of course, she knew well that it was all they would get to hear until they boarded the train.</p><p>"Well . . ." Hermione interrupted her, "it's crystal clear, and while I would love to continue this conversation, I know how much you hate being late and I think Sirius still has some packing to do. He might need help. Don't you, Sirius?"</p><p>She arched a brow at her twin, who gave her an enthusiastic nod. She moved to hold his hand and dragged him away from the room, not waiting for him to burst at their mother and get reprimanded for it.</p><p>After they reached his bedroom, he pulled Hermione into a tight embrace and choked the breath out of her.</p><p>"Thank you <em>and</em> your brains for getting her off our backs," he exclaimed, his voice muffled through her bush of hair.</p><p>"You know I won't always be able to help you once we get there. What if we get sorted in different houses?" she reminded him, pulling back and looking at him carefully.</p><p>Sirius waved his hand nonchalantly and pointed at his luggage. "We can figure that out later, but can you <em>really</em> help me with this mess please?"</p><p>Hermione sighed. It was going to be a long journey.</p><hr/><p>"Hurry up!"</p><p>"It's not my fault you were busy with that mess you call your hair."</p><p>"I wouldn't have taken so long if you had packed the day before!"</p><p>"How would I have known it would've taken me so long?"</p><p>"Are you serious? If you didn't know how long it would've taken, that's one reason why you should've packed sooner."</p><p>"First of all, I am Sirius and I—"</p><p>"Would you two care to shut up before I apparate you two in the middle of the tracks?" their mother bit out. Hermione nodded carefully; she knew better than to continue talking.</p><p>It wasn't that she was scared of her.</p><p>No, perhaps she <em>was</em>. But the main reason was that she wanted to get farther away from the woman, her rules and orders included. So instead, Hermione stepped forward and reached for her mother, in an attempt at hugging her. Perhaps a little physical contact that wasn't not from her husband would do her some good.</p><p>Had she known that she'd trip and land right on the ground, she wouldn't have bothered. But here she was, trying really hard to get up with her hands on the hard ground, and not wanting to hex her brother at the same time for snorting, instead of helping her.</p><p>He better not dare ask for help packing next time, she thought darkly. She got up on her knees, hoping they wouldn't get scraped, and saw a hand make its way in front of her face. Hermione clasped it and looked up, to see a raven, messy—truly messy—haired boy grinning at her.</p><p>Her own lips curled up in gratitude. "Thank you," she said, looking back to glare at Sirius.</p><p>Her brother stopped laughing, probably after realizing he was in trouble. The other boy looked at both of them and beamed, "James Potter at your service."</p><p>Sirius dramatically bowed and shook his hand. "Sirius Black, the Third would like to show his gratitude for saving this young lady, that is Hermione Black."</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes at his theatrics, but shook James's hand regardless and smiled tentatively. His hazel crinkled slightly in amusement as he brought it up for a kiss.</p><p>She let go of it and turned around as she heard someone clear their throat behind her.</p><p>"I don't believe we've met," the woman smiled. She had a few graying hairs, but sported a familiar head of black curls.</p><p>"I'm Dorea Potter and this is Charlus Potter. I highly doubt your mother talked about us. Am I right, Walburga?" she turned to her, arched brow and a challenging look on her face.</p><p>Her mother glared at Dorea and her lips thinned. "I didn't deem it necessary for me to introduce my kids to blood traitors. Though, I suppose it's best for me to warn them about your son, don't you think?"</p><p><em>Really</em>? This could not be happening. They barely had ten minutes left and their mother was getting into a fight, instead of saying goodbye to her kids. Hermione looked at Sirius worriedly and he seemed to understand her concern instantly by the way he sighed.</p><p>"Mother, I'm <em>not</em> letting your blood purity nonsense let us be late. It was a pleasure to meet you Mr. and Mrs. Potter. Come on Hermione." He reached for their luggage as Walburga gasped and listed several profanities.</p><p>Hermione ignored her and turned around to hug Regulus tightly. "I really wish you could come with us," she grumbled, "I'm going to miss you so much."</p><p>Regulus looked at her with innocent eyes and whispered, "Please don't get in trouble. I love you, 'Mione."</p><p>Hermione knew of the message underlying the word 'trouble'. She gave him a firm nod and waved, running to catch up with Sirius.</p><p>Once they boarded, they dragged their feet in search of a free compartment, and once they saw James already sitting with two other boys, they mutually agreed to join them. Sirius slid the door open and sat by the entrance, speaking up first. "Sorry about that, mate. That woman is kinda crazy. You see, the inbreeding got to her badly."</p><p>Hermione smacked his head as she sat beside him, and James laughed. "No worries mate. I was waiting for you to join us. We've been discussing a few pranks we have in mind," he reassured and wiggled his eyebrows.</p><p>Sirius's eyes brightened and Hermione rolled her own. She could tell they were all going to get on with each other just fine.</p><p>"Anyways, this is Remus Lupin", he said as he pointed to the boy in the corner. His face was covered with light scars and he seemed to be very nervous. A small tinge of pink appeared on his cheeks when Hermione offered her hand and he shook it.</p><p>Then, James turned to the other guy who was sitting right next to him. His blue eyes were boring into hers and Hermione tried to hide the gut wrenching feeling she got when she stared at him. She couldn't place as to why he scared her so much. Regardless, she smiled and offered her hand as she heard James say his name, "This is Peter Pettigrew."</p><p>Sirius followed, shaking both of their hands, "I'm Sirius Black and this is my little sister, Hermione Black."</p><p>She gave him a glare and corrected, "I don't think a two minute difference makes you older than me, Sirius."</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat, fidgeting with her hands slightly as she looked at the boys. "Sirius is right, though. I really hope you don't mind our mother. And I also hope you don't have to meet her again. She can be a bit . . . overwhelming."</p><p>James looked at her through his round glasses and slung his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>"You know what? It doesn't matter as long as you're there." He ignored Sirius' protests in the background about 'sister' and 'kill'. Instead he stared at her as he continued, "And, I have a feeling we'll be seeing each other quite often."</p><p>Her eye twitched and really, it had to be the first time she couldn't come up with anything to say. Her throat suddenly felt dry when she said distractedly, "If you are talking about us being in the same house, I hope you're right."</p><p>Sirius caught their attention with a hum and explained, "Our mother wants us to be sorted in Slytherin, since we are the Blacks, but we don't want to and I doubt we'd even have a chance."</p><p>"Eh. Gryffindor is in the Potter blood and who wants to be in Slytherin anyways—"</p><p>"I will have you know Slytherin is the best house to be in. I doubt you would have the brains to be sorted there," a voice interrupted James.</p><p>Sirius glared at the guy standing in the middle of the entrance and jumped in defense of his new friend. "No one asked for your opinion. Maybe your greasy hair let you think otherwise."</p><p>"Sirius!" she reprimanded. Hermione should've known his temper would get him into a fight soon, but she didn't think it would be <em>that</em> soon.</p><p>The lanky boy narrowed his eyes and opened his mouth to speak, just to be cut off by the red haired girl standing next to him. "Come on Severus, let's sit somewhere else."</p><p>"Well," said Peter once they left. "That was interesting."</p><p>Hermione groaned. They hadn't even stepped foot in Hogwarts yet and two people already hated them. She let out a huff and pulled out a book to read, ignoring the boys when they started talking about Quidditch.</p><hr/><p>When Hermione woke up, she saw all the boys asleep. Sirius's head was on her lap, while James was leaning on her shoulder. She noticed students walking on the other side of the door and realized they might be getting closer to the castle. She pulled her brother's head up and let it rest on the side of the wall. Then, her fingers reached up to cup James's cheek as she let his head lay against the window. His glasses looked slightly askew, and smiled as she blew away a small strand of hair away and fixed them on his face.</p><p>After heading to the washroom and wearing the robes she was meant to put on, she felt excitement enter her body, throbbing fiercely in her veins. She had been waiting for this moment for longer than she could remember. Learning had become a part of her, just like eating and sleeping. Reaching for her wand in reassurance, she made her way back to the boys, but slamming right into someone's chest and falling for the second time that day.</p><p>"I'm sorry. I didn't—" A scoff stopped her and she looked up to find the same boy, Severus, that she had seen previously. A sense of guilt kicked in her gut and she realized as she stood up, that she really didn't want to start things badly with anyone.</p><p>So, she gave him a small, apologetic smile. "I'm really sorry for what my brother said earlier. I'm sure he didn't mean to be rude." Well, she wasn't actually sure but— "I hope we can be friends. I'm Hermione Black."</p><p>"I don't care who you or your friends are. Move out of the way," he told her with a biting tone.</p><p>A guy, with a badge and ridiculous blonde hair, stepped in between them and scowled.</p><p>"What's going on here?" he questioned coldly.</p><p>She stared at him in confusion and frowned at the intrusion. "Nothing. We were just talking."</p><p>Severus butted in and said, "Actually, she was the one talking, and I was asking her to stop bothering me."</p><p><em>This lying piece of </em>... No, she was starting to sound like Sirius<em>.</em> Hermione suppressed the urge to argue and before she could think of something to say, the other boy looked at her and arched a perfect brow at her. "Listen here girl, leave now before I make you."</p><p>"First of all, that was quite rude," she exclaimed, affronted at the behaviour of the student, but immediately noticing the green in his robes. Then, she turned to Severus, "And I was apologizing for something that wasn't even my fault, hoping you could be the bigger person and listen!"</p><p>Hermione stormed past both of them and entered the compartment, looking at the boys, still asleep. She wondered what she had just gotten herself into.</p>
