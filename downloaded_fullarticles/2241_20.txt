    <p>“Mr. Javert, look at me when I’m addressing you.” Professor McGonagall looked everything but happy with Slytherin’s Prefect, who was defiantly staring ahead, his hands folded behind his back. Reluctantly, he raised his head to meet her eyes. “I understand that this little …feud has grown very important to you, but I must ask you to act more maturely and according to your position. Other students rely on you. And on a different note, it’s time you perhaps start investing in your future instead of getting wound up on petty fights in the present.” Javert’s eyes blazed. He pushed his chin upwards and replied, his words thick with childish arrogance: “My future’s invested in all right, Ma’am.” “How delightful to hear,” McGonagall didn’t move a muscle, she was evidently unimpressed, “You’ve probably had this conversation with your own head of house already, but do tell me: What lies ahead for the boy who won’t leave Jean Valjean alone?” Said boy swallowed, repelled to be called a boy once more – he was sixteen, almost seventeen, old enough to be treated as a grownup – and he straightened his posture. “I’m going to become an Auror. The best there is.” “Great aspirations, I see. You do your house justice. If you quit attempting to prove something with this Valjean boy, you would even bring it honour.” McGonagall turned, her sleek green robes ruffling along her feet. At the same time as she said “You’re dismissed”, Javert burst out: “You’re telling me to quit only because he’s a Gryffindor!” “It seems you haven’t quite been listening to me. Try considering it, yes?” Suddenly very exhausted, Professor McGonagall signalled to the door: “I have matters to attend to. And you have duties. Be off, Mr. Javert.” Without another word, Javert stalked out of her office, head held high as ever, his hands clutched as fists.</p><p> </p><p>“Your name” ordered the new Prefect, Javert. “I don’t have to tell you my name!” The Fouth-Year with the shabby brown curls shot back. “You do. Students breaking rules are my responsibility, and you were stealing.” “I was not stealing. I’m just taking some bread from the kitchens because a girl in my house missed breakfast and she has Quidditch practice coming up – “ “Your <em>name</em>.” Jean Valjean was interrupted. Defiantly, he told the older boy. “That’s twenty points from Gryffindor. Ten for trespassing – everyone knows the kitchens are off limits unless you’re told otherwise – and ten for stealing.” “It’s a <em>loaf of bread</em>!” Valjean complained. “Argue with me and loose more points. The name’s Javert.” They stared at each other angrily. “Well, good for you. Want me to write it down?” The Gryffindor deadpanned, causing Javert to clench his fists. “You might as well. Stay out of trouble, Valjean.” Composedly, Javert strutted away towards his Common Room, where he’d break up a fight between two First-Years. In the following year, Valjean did not entirely stay out of trouble. And every time, the Slytherin was ready to catch him red-handed, even if it was only the slightest bending of a Hogwarts rule. All because of a loaf of bread.</p><p> </p><p>“The two of you in one room, not at each other’s throats. I’d say that’s a sight for sore eyes.” Horace Slughorn grimaced, and the boys took turns in furiously glaring at each other. “Because, as you most likely know, you’re both such promising students. Nobody casts a Stupefying Charm quite as well as Mr. Javert. And there is no match for Mr. Valjean when it comes to Protecting Spells. Your future holds a lot, no doubt, and yet you’ve chosen to stand in each other’s way.” Slughorn went on, and when both of them wanted to interrupt, he ignored them. Or maybe he simply didn’t notice, lost in his own ramblings. “I’ve had a talk with my young colleague Minerva, and it’s disappointing how you decided to keep this pointless rivalry up. We wish you’d profit from what the other has to offer, or at least stop wasting valuable energy on… I don’t even know what it is you do. It just has to stop. Which is why we, Minerva and I, being your Heads of House, determined the <strong>suitable</strong> measure that needs to be taken: For the next months, you, Mr. Javert, will assist Mr. Valjean in studying for his OWLs. You’ve taken the exams last year, therefore there’s no one better suited to prepare him for it, especially since it was you who wasted away the time he should’ve spent studying in the first place. I will hear no complaints!” He raised his voice when both of them attempted to start arguing, and continued: “Every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday my Potions classroom is at your disposal, and I have installed a portrait to control whether you come to each meeting. Should you not, there will be worse punishments for each of you. Take this as an opportunity to put this childishness behind you, boys. Dismissed.” And Slughorn walked out of the room, leaving the two of them. “This isn’t fair!” Valjean exploded, “I did nothing wrong! He’s the one who keeps pursuing me, pretending I’m the criminal of the century, while there’s a Second-Year in Hufflepuff who morphs herself into teachers and blows up firecrackers in the Courtyard!” But Slughorn was out of hearing distance. “Quit shifting the blame!” Javert hissed, turning away from the Gryffindor. “Quit finding blame to put on me, Javert. Why can’t you just leave me be?” Valjean thought the conversation was over when Javert grabbed his stuff and stormed towards the door, but he stopped in the frame, replying: “’Cause you’re the worst.” Then he was gone.</p><p> </p><p>They successfully avoided each other until Thursday, their first day of forced extra lessons together. When Jean got there, Javert was already sitting at a table near the front of the classroom, hands folded, quill and ink laid out. He looked at his watch to see he was just on time, and the other boy must’ve been way too early. Javert turned around to him, scanning him dismissively. “I checked in with the portrait. It requires us to stay for two hours and then it’ll report back to Professor Slughorn that we did as was asked.” Putting down his cape and bag on the chair next to Javert, Valjean shrugged. “Two hours three times a week, that’s not so bad.” Narrowing his eyes, Javert still didn’t turn away. “Are you being sarcastic? Cause that’ll cost you – “ “I was not.” Valjean cut him off, taking his seat. It felt like the high ground belonged to him now. Confidently, he went on: “My best subjects are Charms and Defense Against The Dark Arts, I don’t need your help there.” “Someone’s particularly arrogant today.” The Slytherin snorted, unasked for, but Valjean was quick to retort: “<em>Someone</em> can’t tell apart arrogance and the healthy ability to self-asses. What are your best subjects? What do you think you can help me with?” “Defense Against The Dark Arts. Potions. …We should see who’s better.” Javert’s always so stern mouth twitched into a smile, only for a second, and Valjean could barely believe his eyes. “…That’s nonsense.” He replied, “You know more spells than I do, it wouldn’t be fair - “ But Javert was already up, drawing his wand: “You want to learn something? There’s no better way than to actually practise.” Reluctantly, Valjean found himself getting up as well, while trying to argue. “I told you I don’t need help with Defense Against The Dark Arts. Besides, Duelling is forbidden.” “It’s not a duel if we don’t do the official stances first. <em>Stupefy</em>!” A red bolt sprung from Javert’s birch wand, meeting the invisible wall Valjean put up in the last possible second by yelling “<em>Protego</em>!” The smile started dancing around Javert’s lips again. “There’s the famous protection charm Slughorn talked about. Is that all you got?” “This is ridiculous, Javert.” Valjean gripped his wand a little tighter, brushing a brown curl out of his face. At the same time, he was hit with Javert’s <em>Diffindo</em>, which sliced his uniform jacket open. He stared at it with disbelief. “Are you insane? You could’ve hurt me!” “Don’t worry. I’m going easy on you, Valjean.” The smug smirk on his opponent’s face flipped a switch somewhere inside Valjean. “Don’t.” His teeth clenched and shouted the Body Binding Charm, which was deflected by Javert. “You know First Year spells? You’re right, you’re incorrigible.” He laughed, throwing another <em>Diffindo</em> Valjean’s way. But Jean’s shield was up in time. “Third Year.” He corrected, only lowering his shield to cast <em>Depulso</em> as Javert got ready to hex him again. The charm hit its target full frontally, throwing the Slytherin into a shelf of empty vials with a loud crash. Only for the briefest second, Valjean felt victorious, then everything was replaced with regret. Javert seemed puzzled at first, but as he pushed himself up from the debris his eyes were flaring with anger. “You’re paying for this.” He announced, and Valjean didn’t flinch back as he approached. “I only did what you told me to.” He reasoned, head high and voice clear. It only pushed Javert further over the edge. “<em>Stupefy</em>! <em>Confringo</em>! <em>Incendio</em>!” Sweat formed on Valjean’s brow as he deflected each one of the spells. “Stop it, Javert!” He shouted in between conjuring shields. “I thought you wanted to learn something!” Javert quipped back, face contorted with focus and fury, “<em>Flipiendo</em>!” When Valjean decided to give up the defense to go into the offense, his <em>Expelliarmus</em> collided with Javert’s <em>Bombarda</em>. The two connected in the middle, sizzling and crackling, sending shocks up each of their arms. But they didn’t pull back. “Javert, don’t you see this is pointless!” Valjean strained, not bothering to not let it show. “What’s pointless? Your sorry life?” Javert’s face was glistening with sweat by now. And Valjean had had enough. He stepped closer, pushing the collision point of the charms closer together, and he socked Javert on the jaw. The Slytherin went down. As soon he was on his feet again, he found Valjean’s ebony wand pointed into his face. “This is against duel regulations. You cheated.” Javert spat, unwilling to accept his defeat. “I thought this wasn’t a duel?” For the first time, a hint of a smile flickered across Jean Valjean’s face. He went on: “I’m going to take down my wand now. We can try to get some actual work done.” They sat back down at the desk. Javert felt like a kicked dog, and he hated every bit of it. Minutes went by until he opened his mouth again. “I’m one of the students who didn’t completely fail History of Magic. If you need – “ “That’s perfect!” Valjean interrupted, relieved, “Binns always sleeps during the lectures, so we don’t learn anything from him and I actually need a good grade in History of Magic if I want to make Minister one day…” “You want to become Minister?” Surprised at his own interest, Javert didn’t notice how quickly the question had slipped out. Embarrassed, he attempted to go over it: “We can start with the Goblin Rebellion in 1612. I remember that well enough, plus it’s an interesting topic…” Two hours were over in no time. With a look at his watch once they’d finished the topic, Jean realised they’d even worked half an hour longer than they were required to. “Thanks for helping me.” He said quietly while packing away his stuff. Only then he looked up at the dirty blond boy next to him, and noticed the red-turning-blue imprint of his punch underneath his mouth. “Let me <em>Episkey</em> that for you.” He offered, reaching out, but Javert violently jerked back. “I can take care of it myself.” The excuse wasn’t enough to make his behaviour seem normal, but since he didn’t know what else to do he grabbed his coat and went for the door. “See you Sunday.” And Javert had disappeared. Valjean was left to charm the vials they’d broken in their confrontation to be whole again, and to try a <em>Reparo</em> charm on his jacket. Then he turned to the portrait next to the teacher’s desk. “Are you going to tell Slughorn that this went well?” But the veiled lady only smiled mysteriously at him.</p><p> </p>
