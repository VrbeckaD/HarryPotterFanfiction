    <p>Harry's POV-</p><p>    When Harry turned six, his soul mark appeared on his wrist. Every magical being had a soul mark, whether you got it when you were three or eighty-one they always had one. That one little mark changed everyones life, one way or another.</p><p>    And for Harry, his soul mark changed everything because on his wrist, in an elegant cursive witting, was the name 'Tom Marvolo Riddle'. The second he told his parents his name, he stopped being Harry James Potter and became Hadrian Orion Evans.</p><p>    Although he was young, Harry wasn't stupid. His parents, for one reason or another, didn't want him to meet his soulmate. So, at the young age of six, Harry began researching. He looked and looked and looked and, at the end of his research, he found a old journal in his Uncle Regulus' room when he was ten.</p><p>    When he found the brown leatherbound  journal, Harry was ecstatic. He finally had a clue to his soulmate's identity! So when he saw the pages were blank, he was terribly disappointed. Still, not one to be easily discouraged, Harry rejoiced at the fact that he, at least, had an object that had belonged to his soulmate.</p><p>    That night, Harry took a quill and wrote, "August 17, 1990- Dear Journal, today I found my first clue to who Tom is! It's been four years but I've found you in Uncle Reggie's room. But I'm pretty sure mom and dad made him, Siri, and Remy swear an oath to not reveal who Tom is. At the very least I know that they knew one and another! I still don't know why they don't want me to know my soulmate. For Merlin's sake, they even made me completely change my name!</p><p>    Maybe he's a dark wizard or something. Still... He's MY soulmate, shouldn't I get the right to choose? I know I'm only ten and that I don't understand everything but it's still not fair." And with that, Harry closed the diary, hid it, and went to sleep.</p><p>*</p><p>  The next day, when Harry opened the journal, he stared in shock at the elegant cursive letters written underneath his entry. "Hello Harry, it's a pleasure to meet you little one. I'm glad to hear you've been looking for me and I can assure you that I've been doing the same. I'm eager to continue our correspondance once you've gotten over the shock that I can speak too. -Tom M.R."</p><p>Harry just stared and stared and stared until his smile turned into a grin and he began to write back. He had trouble believing that he would be able to speak with his soulmate, but it really was happening. This was better then the day Siri had taken him to the Quidditch Championship.</p><p>*</p><p>  The next few years passed by in a flash as Harry went to Hogwarts and befriended Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. And as he grew older he discovered more and more, like the fact that Tom was Lord Voldemort. As in The Dark Lord who rules Magical Britain and the strongest wizard since Merlin.</p><p>  Harry admits that upon finding that out he had freaked out a little... okay, more like a lot, but who wouldn't? But that was what motivated him to excel in his studies. He wanted to become as strong as Tom and make the man proud that he was his soulmate. Still, he was unsure about telling Marvolo. After all, what could he possibly offer him? Tom often told him that all Marvolo would need is for him to just be there... but Harry couldn't help but have doubts.</p><p>  Nevertheless, they were soulmates and soulmates always found a way to one and another. So really, he shouldn't have been so surprised when Headmistress Mcgonagall announced that the Dark Lord would be attending this year's graduation ceremony. Harry wouldn't have been too worried about that -considering he was Hadrian Evans and not Harry Potter- but he just had to loose Tom's journal on the very day Marvolo arrived.</p><p>*</p><p>    The day had begun with the Weasley twin somehow entering the tower and pranking everyone as a graduation gift to the seventh year, much to Harry's amusement and Ron's annoyance. Everyone who had been in the common room had ended up being covered in green goop and whoever had eaten something had ended up as animals. It had taken two hours for the Hogwart's staff to turn them back since the twins had gotten caught in their prank as well.</p><p>   Spending the rest of the morning with 'Mione at the library for the last time, Harry had only noticed the journal's disappearance at lunch when he looked inside his bag to write to Tom and realized he wasn't there. To top it off, he remembered that Marvolo would arrive in the hour... if the man found the journal he didn't want to think about what would happen.</p><p>*</p><p>Marvolo's POV-</p><p>    When Marvolo had gone on a stroll through Hogwart's halls, he hadn't expected to meet such a beautiful boy searching frantically for something. Without realizing it, the Dark Lord had walked up to the boy and asked, "What are you looking for?". The boy, startled, jumped away before turning around. That was all it took for Marvolo to be mesmerized.</p><p>    The boy was the most stunning creature he had ever had the pleasure to lay his eyes on. Soft, untamable, silky black curls, Avada Kedavra eyes which showed all of the boy's emotions, soft, kissable, cherry red lips, lithe,  and an absolute air of innocence which Marvolo yearned to taint. Looking at the boy's uniform, he noticed the emblem of Gryffindor and couldn't help but think that as much as he loathed the house, he'd adored the boy in front of him.</p><p>    The boy bit his lip nervously, eyes shifting toward the ground before he answered, "I'm... I'm looking for my journal.". "How does it look like? I'll help you look." Marvolo offered, finding the angel's shyness rather endearing. At this, the boy's eyes rose to meet his own, panicked, and said, "Oh, you don't need to! I'd rather not be a bother.". "Don't worry little one, " Marvolo said, seeing the boy's eyes widen when recalled him so, "I don't mind. I was getting rather bored myself.". Hesitantly, the boy nodded and said, "If you're sure... My journal isn't much to look t. It's rather old and quite plain. It's just a brown leather bound journal with the name T.M. Riddle in it.".</p><p>    Marvolo  froze. this sweet, beautiful angel had his horcrux? Meaning he had contact with Tom and considering he was still alive, Tom was fond of him... Well, wasn't this just interesting? "Your name?" he asked. "Ah no, I'm Har... Hadrian. Riddle was one of my relative's acquaintance." Hadrian answered. Marvolo smiled, wondering at the relation between him and Regulus and said, "Thomas, it's a pleasure to meet you.".</p><p>*</p><p>    It hadn't taken too long for Marvolo to find it. He'd put a tracking spell on the journal when he'd turned it into a horcrux so all he had to do was activate it and find the precious book. Still, his favorite moment had been when Hadrian had given the journal a fond, almost loving, look and had kissed the cover with those perfect lips of his before giving him a blinding smile. At that precise moment, it took all of Marvolo's self-control to not grab the boy, slam him on the wall, and kiss him into oblivion. Unfortunately, before he had the chance to do so, Hadrian's friends came to get him and his angel left.</p><p>*</p><p>    Hadrian Orion Evans. Hogwart's prodigy, being second -after himself- to get all O's on his O.W.L's and N.E.W.T's. Marvolo smirked as he looked at his little one's file as he attended the ceremony from his stand. The only thing bothering him in his boy's records was the lack of information. Except for his medical file, the file had nothing on the boy's life before Hogwart's. All he knew was that his parents were Jameson and Liliane Evans, but except for that it was almost as if he didn't exist before his sixth birthday.</p><p>    "Lucius." Marvolo called. The blond aristocrat looked at him and asked, "Yes My Lord?". Handing him Hadrian's file, Marvolo ordered, "Find everything about him... especially if he's using an alias.". With a nod, the Lord Malfoy was gone and the Dark Lord returned to the ceremony, eyes locking with Hadrian's as he stood to make his speech.</p><p>*</p><p>Harry's POV-</p><p>    Harry's eyes widened when he saw the Dark Lord come on stage. Voldemort was Thomas and Thomas was Marvolo. How could he have been such an idiot? It was ridiculously obvious! For Salazar's sake, his name was Tom Marvolo Riddle! </p><p>    The second the ceremony ended, Harry ran back to his dorm and wrote to Tom the day's events. 'If what you say is true and Marvolo saw me then he's doing a background check on you as we speak and shall, in a matter of days, know of your real identity and any other relevant information. Good luck... You'll need it. -Love, Tom' Harry glared at the journal, wishing he could set it on fire, knowing that Tom was more then happy with these turns of events. Sighting he thought of how little time he had to man up and own up to the truth... Merlin, he really needs Remy's advice. Tom is way too biased to be of any use and he could do with seeing his honorary godfather.</p><p>*</p><p>    Apparating to Remy's and Siri's cottage, Harry was quickly greeted by his godfathers. After telling Remus about what had happened and what Tom had told him, Remus smiled and said, "Tom is right pup. Voldemort has a right to know. Not to mention that Padfoot and I never agreed with your parent's method... but it was either we swore the secrecy oath or they disappeared with you." Harry was stunned at this new information. He'd been used to have everyone who knew of his soul mark -except for Tom- telling him to keep it a secret and hide, for his godfathers to tell him this... he was happy.</p><p>    For the rest of the day, Remus' words haunted him. Even while he planned a revenge prank worthy of the Marauder's for the twins, Harry kept thinking about the conversation. By nightfall, he had made his decision.</p>
