    <p><b><em>Author's Note: </em> </b> <em> Hello, friends! My name is Grace Ann. I'm new to this whole fanfiction thing; but recently, I've encountered a problem that I believe this is the solution to. My little ones have been asking to read the Harry Potter books; and of course I'm happy for them to be reading; but I don't want them turning into witches! So I thought….. why not make some slight changes so these books are family friendly? </em> <b>[Family friendly?  They are literally categorised as children’s books]  </b> <em> And then I thought, why not share this with all the other mommies who are facing the same problem? So—Ta da! Here it is! I am SO excited to share this with all of you! So, without further ado— </em></p><p> </p><p>Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Harry Potter who lived under the stairs in a house on Privet Drive with his aunt and uncle. He was a good, obedient boy who did all his chores <b>[I will give you credit: you are half right.  He isn’t obedient, but he is forced to do all of his chores]</b> ; but he felt that there was something missing in his life. Something big and special; but he could not quite name it. He stayed up every night; and wished for this special something; but then one day, there was a knock at his door—and everything changed. "Answer the door, Harry!" his Aunt Petunia, a career woman, barked from her armchair where she sat with her feet up. She had short, curly blonde hair and never wore any makeup. <b>[Tell that to my mom.  She worked hard for almost twenty years to support our family as a DOCTOR and she wore makeup] </b> Uncle Vernon nodded sheepishly from the kitchen; and put a tray of moist, chocolatey brownies in the oven.   <b>[My dad loved baking.  He still does, and he worked!]</b></p><p><em> Shouldn't you be doing that? </em> <b>[Who should be doing what, exactly?] </b> Harry thought; but he was a very obedient young boy, so he answered the door right away. He turned the brass, metal doorknob; and pulled open the heavy, wooden <b>[There is no need for a comma there] </b>door.</p><p>On the porch was standing a huge, muscular man with a big, manly beard; and he was dressed in a plaid, red shirt, blue jeans, and sturdy, leather boots. His chest was covered in a thick, unruly carpet of coarse, brown hair <b>[Is that required in a children’s story?]</b> . He wore a necklace that looked to Harry like a lowercase T. Just looking at Harry feel happy, peaceful somehow <b>[Oh.  My. Gosh. I look at crosses every day, and I never feel that.]</b> ; but he couldn't say why! <b>[Harry, you are an idiot.]</b> "Good morning, kiddo," the man greeted amiably; <b>[THIS SHOULD BE A COMMA!] </b> and smiled at Harry. He had the peaceful, friendly sort of face you just knew you could trust. <b>[STRANGER DANGER!  STRANGER DANGER!] </b>"My name is Hagrid. Could I speak to your mommy and daddy?"</p><p>"I don't have a mommy or daddy," Harry replied sadly; and looked at his raggedy, old shoes that were blue. <b>[Okay, lady, a little less description please!] </b>Perhaps that was why he felt so lonely, he thought, not for the first time. Maybe that was what he was missing— a mommy and daddy. But no, that was not quite right.</p><p>"I am so sorry to hear that!" Hagrid uttered empathetically.</p><p>"You can speak with my auntie and uncle," Harry retorted politely <b>[Retorted politely?  That makes no sense]</b> ; <b>[Okay, next chapter I am counting the semicolons] </b> and blinked his big, blue, childlike eyes <b>[Does he not blink the rest of the time? And why are his eyes blue?]</b>.</p><p>"What do you want?" Aunt Petunia peered out the door with her narrow, suspicious eyes; and she was wearing a baggy, unflattering pantsuit <b>[What does that have to do with anything?]</b>.</p><p>"Hello, neighbor! I was wondering if you have been saved," Hagrid exclaimed brightly; and tipped his wide-brimmed, straw cowboy hat <b>[Oh, Hagrid, you walking stereotype, you!]</b>. Aunt Petunia laughed a gravelly laugh; and leaned forward on her sturdy, practical boots.</p><p>"Saved? Don't tell me you are you one of those Christians?" Harry did not know what that word meant <b>[How?  It’s the world’s most practised religion!]</b> ; but Hagrid's smile was the most peaceful smile he had ever seen. It made Harry feel warm and happy inside just seeing the glowing, radiant grin on the kind, friendly stranger's face <b>[STRANGER DANGER! AGAIN!]</b> . He wondered why Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon did not smile like that… <b>[There is no need for an ellipse here.  Just a period.]</b></p><p>"Yes, I am," Hagrid replied kindly. "Are you?"</p><p>Aunt Petunia laughed again; and stuck her pointy, sharp nose up in the air. "We are too smart for that. Haven't you read Dawkins? God is dead! Dawkins proved that. Would you like us to educate you on the Dawkins?" <b>[There is no ‘the’ before Dawkins.]</b></p><p>"What is a Christian?" Harry queried innocently; and scuffed his shoe on the shaggy, yellow carpet which had not been vacuumed in quite some time <b>[As far as I know, men can clean too.]</b>.</p><p>"Christians are people who want to be good," Hagrid explained wisely; and crouched down so he was on eye level with Harry. <b>[Harry ain’t that short.] </b> "We want to go to heaven after we die. Do you know what heaven is, Harry?" Harry shook his head; and his big eyes were wide and curious. <b>[Oh dear Lord.  Harry is officially a three year old.] </b>"Heaven is a beautiful place where we can be with God."</p><p>Aunt Petunia smacked her hands over Harry's young ears; and her voice was sickly sweet when she said, "Thank you very much for your concern, sir, but he does not need your religion, he has science and socialism and birthdays <b>[Birthdays.  Wow, I guess I’m an atheist then, which I am not.]</b> . Haven't you heard of Evolution? I have a very good textbook on Evolution that I could give you on it if you would like to learn things.” <b>[Yes, please!]</b></p><p>Hagrid laughed wisely<b> [Right.  Nope. Not possible to laugh wisely.]</b>. "Evolution is a fairytale. You don't really believe that, do you?"</p><p>"Yes, I do!" Aunt Petunia screeched. <b>[I’m Catholic and I believe you! (I personally believe that God made the apes and then just set a plan in motion to make them evolve)] </b> "Well then prove it!" Aunt Petunia could only stare at him; and her big mouth hung open dumbly. <b>[Sure it did.  I don’t believe you, but whatever.] </b> Here she thought she was so educated; and always demanded that Christians prove what they believed in; but she couldn't even prove her own religion. <b>[As my Orcs say: Love, yer fucked in the ‘ead! Evolution is not a religion.]  </b>It was then that Harry knew who the smart one here was!</p><p>"Tell me how to get to this heaven place!" Harry cried wistfully, clasping his hands together. <b>[Is he five or something?] </b> Sometimes, the wisdom of little ones is really amazing. We think we grownups know it all; but then God speaks through the mouths of little ones; and shows us how we are all mortals struggling along the path of life. Humility. <b>[That’s not a sentence.</b></p><p>"All you have to do is be saved. Do you want to be saved?"</p><p>"I do, I do!" Harry squealed, jumping up and down. <b>[He’s ELEVEN.  NOT GODDAMN TWO.]</b></p><p>"Then pray the sinner's prayer!" <b>[That’s not how you become a Christian.]  </b> Aunt Petunia tried to stop him; but she was powerless against Harry's pure, innocent, holy energy. Soon, Harry had said the prayer. <b>[How does he know the prayer?] </b> Hagrid beamed happily. <b>[As opposed to beaming sadly.]</b></p><p>"You're a Christian now, Harry!" Hagrid cried proudly.  <b>[Yay, great!]</b></p><p>Harry smiled but then interrogated, "But how do I be a Christian? I don't know how!" <b>[How do I English?  I don’t know how!] </b>Hagrid grinned widely. "There is only one place to learn that—Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles!"</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Author's Note: </em> </b> <em> SO what do you all think? </em> <b>[Absolute trash, love.] </b> <em> I may not be a professional writer; but I think I am being given the talent to pull this off in service of a greater </em> <em> mission </em> <b>[Nar.  Yer jus’ effed in the ‘ead.] </b> <em> =) Blessings! —Grace Ann </em></p>
