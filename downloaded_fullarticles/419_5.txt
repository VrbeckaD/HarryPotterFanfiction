  <span>Sirius could still see the spark in James’s eyes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We’ll be Animagi,” he had said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus had protested, Sirius remembered, running his finger up and down the nearest rubbish bin. He’d said he wasn’t worth that.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They’d done it anyways, of course. He and James and Peter.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Peter…</span>
  </em>
  <span> There was a horrendous grinding noise and Sirius pulled his hand from the bin, flicking dried paint off his dirty fingernails.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <em>
    <span>Peter.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius watched his hand shorten and cover itself in mangy black hair. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Peter.</span>
