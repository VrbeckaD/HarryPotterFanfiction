          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Sit.” </p><p>She sat. </p><p>“Stand.” </p><p>She stood. </p><p>“Look at him.” </p><p>Hermione’s honeyed eyes peered in through the slats of the cell door, her eyes finding his immediately. They were green, piercingly so, and so tired. </p><p>They were all so tired. </p><p>“Isn’t she lovely Potter? My own,” she trailed a sharp nailed finger along the outside of Hermione’s jaw, “Pet, obedient and well-trained. Sit, Pet.” </p><p>Hermione sat back down on the low stool centered in the hallway outside the row of cells. It was small and circular, not a particularly appealing spot to sit if she was honest, but Bellatrix had bid her to do so, and so she did. The compulsion was too strong and she was far too tired to fight it. </p><p>“You’re lucky Potter. I would have petitioned for more… Spectacle. Something the masses could enjoy. But my Lord,” she leaned in to the bars, fingers twisting around the cold steel and sharp toothed smile bright in the dim light, “Well, my Lord desires that you fade from memory. Martyr’s are harder to fight than forgotten cowards.” </p><p>With a burst of speed he shot forward in his bonds, spitting on the green dress hanging down to her feet. A look of disgust crossed Bellatrix’s face at that, wordless and soundless she pierced him with a dark glare. </p><p>“Well then, if that’s all you have to say on the matter, I have better things to attend to. Pet,” she turned around towards Hermione, hands coming to rest on her hips, “Clean this filth.” </p><p>Hermione whipped out her wand and cast a silent scourgify on the soiled garment, wiping away Harry’s latest effort at non-compliance. With that done Hermione leaned back in her seat, wand coming back to rest inside the sheath strapped to her wrist. It was an improvement from her own time in the dungeons, now two weeks past, and even if her magic was at the beck and call of Bellatrix it was better than being away from it entirely. </p><p>“Wait here Pet, I’ve one last thing to check on and then we’ll be rid of him. Keep him company,” Hermione felt the slick feel of magic against her skin as the words became an order, became compulsion. “Sit here, watch over him. Do not speak to him and do not assist him in any manner. Understood?” </p><p>“Yes,” she answered almost mindlessly, letting the magic ride out her actions. </p><p>“Oh, before I forget,” Bellatrix leaned down beside Hermione, cheek to cheek as she looked through the bars and caught Harry’s eyes, “Kiss me.” </p><p><em> THUMP THUMP</em> </p><p>Her heart was driving towards her throat as the words fell into still air, ears burning and stomach churning in embarrassment at her predicament. With automatic lethargy her head turned into Bellatrix’s cheek as her lips sought out the dark witch’s own. She could hear a gasp in the background from Harry as he watched the order unfold, certainly confused and likely worried, least she hoped. It was also likely he’d jump to the wrong conclusion, think she was doing this of her own volition. Nostalgic memories of his fire and anger, however wrongly placed, surfaced in the back of her mind and stayed there as the primary consideration of fulfilling Bellatrix’s order took first place. </p><p>Teeth nipped her lips, harsh, sharp, pulling and demanding entrance without even a word. There was no compulsion here, no stinging pain in the back of her skull if she refused. It was just easier to acquiesce after so many hours of failed disobedience. The lighter part of her mind focused on that, that it was easier to simply agree and let the witch do as she pleased. It was easier that way, easier to ignore the darker part that said she enjoyed the action. Enjoyed the direction after months of being directionless. </p><p>She refused to give that darker part any traction. </p><p>With a last swipe of her tongue Bellatrix leaned back and then stood tall, regal and imposing in the small corridor.  </p><p>“I’ll be back soon Pet, just do as I said.” </p><p>“Yes, Lady Black.” </p><p>--- </p><p>It took Harry all of three seconds after Bellatrix left the hall to begin trying to coax her into helping him. But she had her orders. </p><p>“Hermione, ‘Mione, help me, please-” </p><p>She sat there, unable to speak to him and unable to leave her perch. </p><p>“Hermione!” He shook the bars with all his weight, desperation and fear evident in his now sickly green gaze, “PLEASE!” </p><p>--- </p><p>An hour passed before anything much happened again. She’d sat there, obediently, as Harry raged for a number of minutes. Eventually he must have gotten tired, or too depressed, and he’d slunk down into a corner of the cell between piles of hay and dirt. Meanwhile she had remained inside her head to think and connive a way out of her predicament. A way to help. </p><p><em> ‘Can’t talk to him, mustn’t talk to him, but-’</em> </p><p>It struck her in an odd moment of brilliance that the intention behind the words was half of what controlled her. The <em> words </em> were the other half. If Bellatrix didn’t word it right… </p><p>“I’m talking to myself.” </p><p>Her voice echoed against the harsh stone walls and bounced back to her own ears. No pain. No driving need to be punished for transgression.  </p><p>She’d done it. </p><p>“I’m talking to myself because I am not allowed to talk to the prisoner, I am inside Malfoy Manor!” Her words came out in a rush of air and sound while Harry pushed forward from his seat against the wall and clambered back in front of the bars. His face pushed up against the bars and for the first time in hours it seemed he had life within him yet. </p><p>“I was captured by Bellatrix Black and brought to Malfoy Manor, whereupon I was involved with a ritual, and no longer have free will to defy Bellatrix Black.” </p><p><em> ‘Oh gods that hurts to say aloud.’</em> </p><p>Harry’s eyes widened at that, and Hermione prepared to tell hi- herself, exactly what had happened in the ensuing two weeks. </p><p>--- </p><p>Her tale took an hour, after which she could do no more than stare pitifully at him with an expression of sorrow and loss. He’d retreated back into his corner again when she’d finished, shuffling along on the ground as he tried to make himself comfortable. There was no rescue, she made sure to make that clear when she spoke to ‘herself.’  </p><p>There was nothing that could be done. </p><p>The crashing of the door leading to the dungeons alerted her to Bellatrix’s return. The witch sauntered in with a crooked smile on her lips and her heels held in one hand so that her feet moved silently upon the hard stone floor.  </p><p>“Pet,” she crooned out, voice dark and heavy in the stillness of the room. “Were you good?” </p><p>“Yes, Lady Black.” </p><p>Bellatrix stopped in front of Hermione, one hand underneath her chin while the other let the shoes fall to the floor. Sharp nails traced a line from the bottom of her jaw and up to her left temple, a warm line if red following in their wake. She leaned in, cheek to cheek, warmth spreading throughout Hermione’s face as she saw Harry rise from his spot.</p><p>“Were you really a good girl?” </p><p>“Y-yes, Lady Black.” </p><p>“Hmm…” Bellatrix leaned in and turned her head, biting Hermione’s earlobe and tugging gently with sharp teeth. “No, you weren’t.” </p><p>In a flash Hermione’s eyes were wide as saucers as the breath in her chest exploded outwards in a huff of fear. <em> ‘What did I do? How does she know?’</em> </p><p>“I have my ways, Pet. Regardless,” the dark witch leaned back and stood to her full height, turning towards the bars of Harry’s cell, “You need to be punished. You broke my rules, even if you weren’t in pain for it. But I have the perfect solution.” </p><p>She left her position and walked up behind Hermione on the stool, hands coming to rest upon her shoulders and nails digging painfully into the skin. </p><p>“Stand.” </p><p>She stood. </p><p>“Take out your wand.” </p><p>Hermione dropped the wand from its holster and into her waiting fingers, pulse steadily rising as she stared in Harry’s eyes. </p><p>“Kill him, use Avada.” </p><p>“No-” Her next words were unintelligible as a wave of crushing pain burst forth from somewhere right behind her eyes, clouding her vision and shutting off all thoughts.  </p><p>In a blink the pain had disappeared, her body stilling as the hand holding her wand came to point at Harry’s chest in between the bars of the cell. </p><p>“Avada K-” </p><p>“Wait!” Bellatrix released her grip from her shoulders only to slap them back down with extreme effort, Hermione shuddering and nearly falling back onto the stool. </p><p>“Hermione please-” </p><p>“Quiet Potter, she’s more important people to listen to now. Pet,” Bellatrix leaned low to press lips against her ear, “What is he?” </p><p>“A… a…,” Hermione’s voice caught in her throat while the compulsion tried to make her obey. It couldn’t. There were too many ways to answer that question. It was too vague. Too unsure. </p><p>“He’s Mud, Pet. Mud. Just like every Muggle. Now, what are Muggles?” </p><p>“Mud,” her voice supplied, augmented by how Bellatrix wanted her to think of them. </p><p>“And what is he?” </p><p>“Mud.” </p><p>“Good Pet,” a nip against her neck, “Now, we’re going to kill him. Tell him what we’re going to do.” </p><p>“Mud, we’re going to kill you.” </p><p>Another bite. </p><p>“Tell him what <em> you’re </em> going to do.” </p><p>“Mud…,” Hermione’s eyes filled in with tears, “I’m going to kill you.” </p><p>Harry stood back from the bars, releasing his hold on them and staring straight ahead, a soft and sad smile upon his face. </p><p>“Do it.”</p></div>
