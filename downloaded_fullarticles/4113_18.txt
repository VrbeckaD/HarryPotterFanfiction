  <em>Dear Diary,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She’s left me.<br/> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I hate her for it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em><b>I</b> hate myself for it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I <b>can</b> still recall everything about her - every detail, every sound, every scent, every touch.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And I wish I could forget.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I want to forget, but that would be impossible now; wouldn’t it?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>She’s taste; she’s sight; she’s sound; she’s smell; she’s touch. Wouldn’t forgetting her be abandoning all five of my senses?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And you know what? I miss the agony of before - of her being just out of my reach. I miss the suffering I endured keeping her at arm’s-length, but I’m a selfish person; aren’t I? I couldn’t be content with my own anguish by keeping her afar, could I?</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>No, of course not, because I must be some sort of fucking masochist. That’s what she’d always tell me, anyway. She’s probably right, but…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I made the mistake of pulling her in too close, and let myself choke on her. I let her get too close and I became claustrophobic.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And I couldn’t get enough of her. I just couldn’t stop and I -</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I just needed to <b>breathe</b> again.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I needed air again.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>And so, I took hers.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Now, she will forever be at arm’s-length.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>One day, I know I will forget.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Because I will forever have a soul that cannot be built <b>again</b> from scratch like Hermione thought it could; so, why should a fragmented soul like mine need all five of their senses?</em>
