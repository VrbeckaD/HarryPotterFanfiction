    <p>
  <span>Welcome to the multiverse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Cassandra and Selene are in charge. The Ancients take care of the details. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not many people are left unscarred. Cassandra and Selene had to work hard to fix things after the wreckage their predecessor left. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So many dead. The last heroes left standing- Batman, who lost all of his family, all his friends. Captain America, a lone symbol of righteousness. Spider-Man, alone and dying. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dead. Dead. Dead. So many dead. It took years to change this, endless rewrites and long conversations, mountains of paperwork. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the end, Cassandra and Selene should have been lauded for their work, but mild immaturity on their part left one of their teachers constantly scolding them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They are in charge of an incredibly fragile multiverse, yet the professor of Responsible Ruling calls them immature. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least the Being believes in them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Do you wish to learn more about this place? Would you delve into the horrors of the current Multiverse? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Want to see the scars?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kid Flash will forever remember his father. It was left irreversibly scarred into his skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane Hopper will never forget the Lab. Papa is not dead and she is not free. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Peter Parker can’t forget Skip Westcott. It’s a part of him that he wishes would disappear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione Granger is a witch with adoptive magic-hating parents. She can’t get away from them, even at Hogwarts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Beverly Marsh can’t forget. Her life in Derry, her friends… her father. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will Vandom doesn’t know what to think. Her life seems good now, with peace in the dimensions, but something’s wrong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Adrien Agreste wishes. His father was a good man, but now his house is cold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>(selene would like to disclaim that most of the changes were cassandra’s idea)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(cassandra would like to disclaim that she is totally not to blame)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wizarding Britain reaches into seemingly every family, seemingly every group. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Blacks spawned Hermione, through her mother Bellatrix. Dorea Black is the mother of James Potter. Cassiopeia Black’s daughter married Jacob Wheeler and became mother of four- Theodore “Ted”, Henry, Magdalena “Maggie”, and Gina. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ted married Karen Tozier and had three kids- Nancy, Mike, and Holly. Henry never married. Maggie married Wentworth Tozier and had a son, Richie. Gina had four kids with various men. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Molly, Gideon, Fabian- they had more siblings, Squibs who changed their last names and left. Donald changed his name to Dare and fathered one Rachel Elizabeth Dare. Thomas was adopted by the Vandoms and became father of Will Vandom. Ira become father of Rudolph West, who fathered Wally West, who became Kid Flash. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone is connected to everyone. It’s impossible to truly get away from your family, your history. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So many superheroes exist here. The Avengers, the Justice League, the Teen Titans, the Miraculous. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So many gods exist here. The Greek gods, in multiple forms- the true gods, who bore such children as Perseus Jackson and Annabeth Chase, and the semi-gods, who bore Diana and created the Amazons of Themyscira. The Norse Gods, again in multiple forms- the true gods, who bore such as Magnus Chase and Samirah al-Abbas, and the semi-gods, like Thor who joined the Avengers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So many creatures. There are two levels of dragons here. The first level consists of most powerful dragons, who speak many languages including human ones and can change into a human shape. They can use magic and many dwell in ancient sanctuaries, like Wyrmroost and Frosted Peaks. The second level cannot speak human languages and are kept restricted by the wizards of the Wizarding World. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There are, of course, outliers. Rare dragons. Some exist from myths. There are the ancient and believed-mythical elemental dragons. Xin Jing became an elemental dragon when she created the jewel that would become the Heart of Kandrakar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So many changes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Would you want to know this place?</span>
