    <p>It was James' last year and he still hadn't been able to convince Evans to date him, neither did he had any succesfull pranks lately. But that chilly night in October, he came up with the best plan for a prank while he was in bed. The other marauders were asleep already.</p><p>Peter was rolled up into a little ball and he was hugging his pillow. While Sirius laid together in bed with Remus again, in his bed. Remus had his face pressed against Sirius' chest and Sirius had his arm loosely wrapped around his hips.</p><p>James wasn't weirded out by it, in fact, it was a well kept secret under the four of them that Sirius and Remus were dating. Remus didn't want it to be public as he was a private person when it came to relationships so that's why only the marauders knew about it. And so far, they had been able to keep the secret since the start of sixth year, when Remus and Sirius started dating.</p><p>James looked at Peter before looking over to Sirius and Remus and then he sighed. 'Is it a good idea to prank them?' he thought and adjusted his position so he laid on his right side. 'Of course it is.' he thought right after. Though James had one massive obstacle.</p><p>That being that the person who would be a part of the prank was probably not going to agree on helping him with doing this prank. But of course James wasn't going to give up without trying so he smiled confidently to himself and then fell asleep.</p><p>The next morning on their way to breakfast, James said to the other marauders that he would catch up with them soon. "I need to do something first." James said.</p><p>"Are you going to chase Evans again?" Sirius mocked with a grin.</p><p>"That'd be stupid." Remus said.</p><p>"No? I'm not going to chase her. I have better things to do." James said but the marauders laughed at that.</p><p>"Oh sod off..." he groaned and he left them. When he was in a safe distance from them he took out the map, said the magic password and looked on the map if he saw Severus anywhere. When he saw him approaching the dinner hall as well, James put the map away and went into the direction Severus Snape was.</p><p>Of course when they crossed paths, the Slytherin tried to avoid him but James held him back.</p><p>"We need to talk, Sni-- Snape." James said calmly.</p><p>Severus looked up, his hair covered his face for the most part so James couldn't tell what kind of expression he made. "No, we do not, Potter." Severus replied without any emotion besides frustration.</p><p>"Yes, we do. Come on." James attempted to pull Severus by his arm to make him follow but the Slytherin pulled his arm back quickly.</p><p>"Do not touch me, Potter." He scoffed and he then tried to walk off but James held him back again.</p><p>Severus groaned and was about to pull his wand out but James smiled at him. "If you come with me to talk, I'll leave you alone for the week and I will convince the others to do the same as well." James said.</p><p>Reluctantly Severus nodded after a short silence and he followed James to an empty corridor.</p><p>"Make it quick, Potter." Severus said.</p><p>"Was planning that already. Now, Snape. I have this big plan to prank my friends and Evans and I need your help." James said.</p><p>"And why exactly do you think I would be willing to help you?" Severus asked.</p><p>"Well...perhaps there might be something you'll get out of it." James suggested.</p><p>"One week of leaving me alone isn't going to be enough." Severus frowned.</p><p>"What do you want then? It can be anything." James said.</p><p>"Anything?" Severus asked and then he thought for a bit.</p><p>"Well what do you want?" James asked, getting a bit impatient.</p><p>"New robes, a new bag and new shoes." Severus demanded.</p><p>"Hell no I'm going to give you all of those things." James said back.</p><p>Severus turned around on his heels. "Then I guess you'll be doing this prank by yourself, Potter."Â </p><p>"Fine! I'll give those things but then you'll have to make sure you don't mess this prank up." James said and he crossed his arms. Severus turned back to look at him and he smirked a little bit.</p><p>"Now, what's the prank?" Severus asked.</p>
