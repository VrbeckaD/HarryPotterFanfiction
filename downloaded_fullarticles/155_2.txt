    <p>Louise Delacour left her seat to venture away, when her family got distracted with a score for Ireland, which was the team they were supporting.. Louise wasn't a big fan ofg Quidditch. It didn't make sense, with only the seeker being the important player and the rest being supporting members of the team. The rest of her family though was absolutely crazy about the game, like most of the Wizarding world. </p><p>That was the reason that she was here, at the finals of the Quiditch World Cup in Britain, only to get bored enough to leave her seat ten minutes into the start of match. </p><p>Towards the back of stands, she saw a line figure staring out at the night sky instead of the match going on. She made her way over to him, observing him subtly. He was good looking enough, probably her age, with curly ebony hair and tanned skin. </p><p>"Am I lucky enough to find a fellow quidditch apath at the finals of the quidditch world cup?" she asked, drawing his attention. </p><p>He turned towards, apparently already had heard her coming, as there was no surprise on his face. "It must be your lucky day." he answered. </p><p>"I am Louise Delacour and I was brought here by the power of puppy dog eyes by my little sister." she offered her his hand, if he shook instead of kissing. He was already making a good impression. </p><p>"My name is Aries and I am here to use a gift given to me by my grandfather two weeks before his death." he answered her unasked question. </p><p>She found the lack of family name curious. From his accent, she knew he was British and he had a wizard grandfather, which would make him British half blood or pure blood, who took a lot pride in their family names.</p><p>"You go to Hogwarts, then?" She asked.</p><p>"No, I go to Durmstrang. My grandfather didn't have a nice opinion on Dumbledore."</p><p>"He must be a smart man, then." Louise told him.</p><p>"He was. His reasons might be different than yours though." He looked at her curiously.</p><p>"Albus Dumbledore is ruining the Magical World" she proclaimed. At his raised eyebrow she added, "how do explain this? How well are you informed about recent British politics?" she asked. </p><p>"Fairly well."</p><p>"Well, he is politically the leader of the liberal section while all his political actions are secretly traditional. He has been subtly changing the laws that make the creatures and muggleborns marginalized, while giving the appearance that it is for their benefit. On the other hand, he is banning traditional magics in the name of dark magic, slowly destroying the innate magic of earth. He has been doing this in Britain for decades, either maliciously or with ignorance I don't know, but since he became the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, he has been slowly spreading this to other countries, and what is worse is that people are actually buying it." she ranted.</p><p>Aries' face was contemplative. "You are right. I've never looked at his political moves this way. You clearly have a flair for politics." he complimented.</p><p>"Thank you." she blushed. It was rare that boys gave her compliments on her brains rather than her looks. "I wish to enter the political arena after I complete school."</p><p>"You'll do well. I wish I had your talent for politics. I'm supposed to be an join the Wizengamot, when I turn seventeen." he admitted.</p><p>Louise looked at him again. A boy he age, Heir to an old family who's grandfather recently passed away. "You're Heir Lestrange?" she asked, stunned.</p><p>He smiled sardonically. "Yes. Surprised at the lack of goth look?"</p><p>"No, it was the absence of pureblood arrogance and every sentence not ending with 'mudblood', that got me." She replied, honestly. "Wow, you're really going to shake things up, aren't you?" </p><p>"What do you mean?" </p><p>"The Lestrange family had a fair number of seats, which were aligned by neutrals up till now, presumably your grandfather didn't want to align with traditionalist on the fear of being called dark, especially after his sons' imprisonment. But I have a feeling that you are not going to follow that pattern. You'll align with either traditionalists, which would remove Dumbledore from his majority and thus Britain's ICW representative would be changed and he'll no longer be the Supreme Mugwump. Or you'll align yourself with liberals which would make headlines on his own, and cause rift between Dumbledore's cronies who'd want to ostacrize you or real liberals who'd want to welcome you. Either way you'll be changing the game."</p><p>"You presume too much. What makes you stay I wouldn't stay with the neutrals?" he questioned. </p><p>Louise shrugged. "You aren't afraid to make a statement. You came to the biggest gathering of Quidditch fans in the world in their rabid mode, and had the balls to stargaze from the stadium." </p><p>That was when they were interrupted by loud cheers. Apparently, Krum had caught the snitch. "My family would be looking for me." she said, surprisingly reluctant to leave. </p><p>"Will you be staying for celebrations?" he asked. </p><p>"No, we are portkeying back directly."</p><p>"It was very nice to meet you Ms. Delacour. I hope I'm fortunate enough to meet you again."</p><p>"I've got a feeling you will." she told him. </p><p>"Me too." he said, walking away.</p>
