    <p align="center">In the Process of Forgetting</p><p>                                                                                                                                 Prologue</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The war was over.</p><p>That meant everyone got their happy ending right? Well, unfortunately, reality is a bitch.</p><p>“ I’m leaving you, Harry,” Ginny said as she packed a bag.</p><p>“Wha- why!? What did I do? Tell me and I’ll fix it.” He pleaded.</p><p>“Harry, it’s nothing that you did,” she said turning to face him. “But we don’t fit together the way we used to.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Harry I love you, but when I come home from a long trip, I don’t want to curl up on the sofa by the fire, I want to have hot, heavy, wall slamming sex until I can’t walk anymore. That’s not what you want, and that’s fine, but we both have needs and this relationship isn’t helping either of us.”</p><p>“ I can try harder!”</p><p>“Harry I’ve already met someone else…” it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“We met a while ago, but I was hesitant to do anything because of you, but I’m tired of worrying and wanting Harry. I just… we want different things now. You want a family and a quiet life. But I want to go out and party, make mistakes. I want to be with someone who makes my pulse race every time he looks at me. I want to be famous for being me, the seeker of the Holyhead Harpies. But instead, all I’m known for is dating you.”</p><p>Harry Stayed quiet as he listened to her tirade, too astounded to interrupt.</p><p>“I still love you Harry, but I don’t want to wake up one morning and find myself hating you because I didn’t take my chance while I had it. I also really don’t want you to hate me for wanting something else. Please understand Harry, I know it seems selfish, but I’m doing this for both of us.”</p><p>“I-I understand, you do what you feel is right Gin,” Harry said weakly.</p><p>“Harry, are you gonna be okay?”</p><p>Harry wasn’t sure if he answered her or not, everything became a blur after that. Not surprisingly, their break up made headlines. The first day it was in the papers they attacked Ginny saying she had been unfaithful. Harry had shut them right up and a retraction was printed that night. Of course after that one thing after another. None of the Weasleys seemed to understand why it had happened, constantly questioning him about it. After almost a month of being stalked by reporters and gossips, he decided he needed to get away for a while. So he bought a house in Staten Island USA and he was off. Maybe he would give socializing a try.</p>
