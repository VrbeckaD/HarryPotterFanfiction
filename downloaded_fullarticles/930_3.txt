    <p>“You want another?”</p><p>Hermione Granger lifted her eyes from the empty glass she was fiddling with and up to the handsome bartender.</p><p>“Well, there’s not two of you, so I’m obviously nowhere near drunk enough to forget this rubbish week,” she replied.</p><p>He chuckled at her and she pushed her glass over to him and he caught it smoothly, quickly refilling her glass with her choice of poison, double vodka and coke, before pushing it back over to her and she caught it before it tipped over the edge of the counter.</p><p>He pulled the cloth that was hanging over his shoulder and picked up a glass, polishing it as he spoke his next words.</p><p>“So, what brings you here? You’re a long way from home,” he spoke.</p><p>Yes, she supposed her accent was a dead giveaway as to where home was for her.</p><p>“I’ve been relocated in my job; I had a meeting with my new boss to iron out the final details before I make the move permanently.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow and picked up another glass.</p><p>“Not going to tell me what it is you do?”</p><p>“No,” she replied, picking up her glass and downing her drink, before pushing it back over to the blue-eyed, brunette and he refilled her glass silently.</p><p>“Okay, I like a little mystery,” he winked at her. “I’m betting I know all of your secrets by the end of the night, I can be very persuasive.”</p><p>“There’s a pretty blonde over there that hasn’t taken her eyes off you for the last ten minutes,” she spoke, gesturing with her head to the right and effectively turning his attention away from her and to someone he actually had a chance of charming into his bed that night. </p><p>He turned his head to the right, his mouth twitching into a smile and he turned his eyes back to her.</p><p>“Off you go, I’m sure she’ll happily give you her full attention, I’m not in the right frame of mind to do so.” He tilted his head slightly and she sighed, before lifting her hands and shooing him away. “Go on, she may have her eyes on you, but the red-head sat at the booth behind me has his eyes on her.”</p><p>He gave her a slight smile and strode off down to the other end of the bar and she sighed in relief, allowing her head to drop and her eyes to fall back down to her glass. She lifted her hand to push back the fallen curls from her face, and then rubbed at her tired eyes. When she pulled her hand back, she caught sight of the small diamond glittering in the low lights of the hotel bar she was currently in.</p><p>The silver band was a little too big for her small, thin fingers, but it wasn’t so big that it would fall off. The small round diamond sat in the centre of the band, looking innocent and simple. The ring was a reminder of the love she shared with another, a promise that they would spend the rest of their lives together, and love no one but each other.</p><p>What a load of crap that was!</p><p>She ran her thumb over the ring that sat on her left ring finger and her eyes looked at it distractedly, painful memories that were still fresh in her mind playing on a loop. She shut her eyes tightly, fighting off the tears. She wasn’t sad or hurt, she was angry, and her hand clenched around her glass tightly before she took a calming, deep breath, reminding herself to count to ten and allowing positive thoughts to fill her mind.</p><p>
  <em>You’re strong. You’re powerful. You’re Hermione Granger, don’t let him win. </em>
</p><p>She breathed out slowly, her hand loosened its grip on the glass and her eyes fluttered open, the ring once more filling her vision.</p><p>She wasn’t going to be needing it anymore, in all honestly, she didn’t know why she still wore it. She supposed it was habit. She never took it off, so she hadn’t. But now it was time.</p><p>She brought her hand away from her glass and up to her ring, and without any hesitation she swiftly pulled it off, feeling a weight being lifted off her shoulders. Feeling a sense of freedom and calm wash over her.</p><p>The ring sat in her palm as she lifted her glass to her lips and sipped at her drink, a small smile pulling at her mouth as she stared at the piece of jewellery. To think, that up until a month ago she was going to marry Ronald Weasley in three months time was almost laughable. She just thanked her lucky stars that she’d been able to see him for the arsehole he was before she walked down the aisle and tied herself to him.</p><p>When the opportunity for her to transfer to the States came up, she’d been so excited to have the chance to explore new cultures and places, to meet and work with new people, to experience new and exciting challenges, but Ron had put an immediate damper on the situation. But now, it didn’t matter; now she could do whatever she wanted, and she had snapped up the opportunity like Dudley Dursley eating the twins’ pranking candy from the floor.</p><p>She’d had the final meeting with the Department Head of the American RCMC Department, and she was set to officially move across the pond in two months time. She’d wanted to start sooner, but she needed to work her notice back in Britain, she needed to sort her affairs back home, ensure her paperwork was all sorted since she would be living in the Muggle World, and she needed to find herself a place to live. Whether or not her move would be permanent she didn’t yet know. She was contracted for three years and once that was over, she had the choice of either staying for good or returning to Britain.</p><p>She downed the rest of her drink and then lifted her clutch purse from her lap and onto the counter, with one last look at the ring, she dropped it in, not caring if she would never see it again. A smile pulled at her mouth and she let out a sigh and a little laugh of relief, before pulling out her purse and placing a tip on the bar, underneath the glass for the bartender to collect once he realised she was gone.</p><p>She stood from the stool and readjusted her black cocktail dress before picking up her clutch and turning to leave, except she didn’t get the chance to.</p><p>She felt eyes on her and a nearby presence that sent her instincts on edge and the hairs on the back of her neck standing up. It wasn’t the feeling of danger, but the feeling of a powerful presence, and in her line of work, she knew that feeling all too well. She felt her hand move to rest on her thigh where her wand was held in the holster attached to her inner thigh, if she needed to, she could retrieve it and defend herself before blinking. Her reflexes had improved massively over the years, what with the war and her current career being just as dangerous.</p><p>She steeled her nerves before slowly turning around, her eyes searching the room in the dim lighting of the bar, until they landed on a man sat several seats down from her. He was the epitome of tall, dark and handsome, she realised. With his dark hair spiked up a little at the front, his dark eyes surrounded by darker lashes, and his facial hair short and neatly trimmed, almost appearing as it being stubble that surrounded his mouth, covered his jaw and chin and disappeared into his sideburns. She didn’t really like facial hair, but she admitted that this man suited it; she couldn’t imagine him without it. He wore black dress shoes, grey suit trousers and a white button-down shirt that did nothing to hide his impressive physique, especially since his sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, the first two buttons were undone and his black tie was loose.</p><p>As soon as he realised she’d caught him staring, he shifted in his seat and raised an eyebrow in challenge. She felt her mouth twitch in amusement.</p><p>It wasn’t difficult to imagine what he wanted from her or that she had caught his attention. As it was, she was one of the few young women in the bar that night that didn’t already have a companion or that wasn’t already being chatted up by another man. And that night she actually felt pretty.</p><p>She would’ve considered herself to be average but when she dressed up and put a little effort into her appearance, she knew she was a lot prettier than she gave herself credit for. Her hair had finally calmed down, it still being an untameable mass of wild curls, but the frizz was no longer a problem. Her skin was as pale as it had always been, her eyes large and soft and a chocolate brown colour, her nose small and button-like and her lips soft and plump. </p><p>Of course, she was nowhere near Ginny’s striking beauty, or Fleur’s veela beauty, but when she was by herself, she attracted a fair bit of attention and that was one of the problems she’d had with Ron. His jealousy had been ridiculous. He didn’t trust her, when in fact it should’ve been her that shouldn’t have trusted him.</p><p>She shook her head of those thoughts, feeling her loose curls tickling her face. That night she’d had a dinner meeting with the RCMC Department Head at the restaurant of the hotel she was staying in, and shortly after she’d retired to the hotel bar alone. She’d dressed up a lot nicer than she usually would’ve, but this hotel was particularly expensive and filled with residents that had money to waste.</p><p>Her curls were tied up in a bun but some had broken free of their restraint and framed her heart-shaped face. She wore a black cocktail dress that was fairly simple compared to some of the designs other women were currently wearing. Hers had thin straps, a sweetheart neckline and moulded to her figure as it fell down to her mid-thigh. The skin that was on show was modest and she’d been sure to glamour the scars she’d earned over the years, not being in the mood for the judgemental looks she’d receive from the snobby crowd in the hotel. Her silver strappy heels and matching clutch purse completed the look, and when she’d looked at herself in the mirror, she felt pretty.</p><p>Her eyes moved over to the exit that would lead her into the corridor, to the elevator and up to her room on the eighteenth floor, and then back to the man. She nibbled at her lip; she had a decision to make. She could leave and go back to her room, take a relaxing bath and get some sleep before she left for London in the morning, or she could spend the night doing something that would likely be a lot more fun.</p><p>She was a free, single woman with no one to answer to but herself. She could make her own decisions without the need for the opinions of anyone else. She could do whatever she wanted, and although it was something she’d never normally do, she found herself needing a bit of attention. After all, that was where the night was sure to lead and she hadn’t had attention such as that for months now and she could do with the stress relief. And if it happened to be with a man that was so handsome she could already feel her body responding to his stare alone, then it wouldn’t hurt.</p><p>With her clutch in hand and her heels making little noise against the floor, she made her way over to the man, his gaze never leaving hers as she closed the distance between them. She sat on the stool beside him, carefully hooking her leg over her knee to prevent herself from flashing him, and she rested her clutch purse on her lap and leaned her side against the bar, tilting her head slightly. His gaze still never left hers, even as he lifted his tumbler –whisky, she thought- and took a sip, swirling the remaining liquid in the glass as he brought it back down onto the counter.</p><p>“So, would you like to explain why you were staring at me?” She questioned.</p><p>If he was surprised by her accent, he didn’t show it.</p><p>“What else is a man to do when someone as beautiful as you is sat alone and without a companion?” He spoke, his voice smooth and charming.</p><p>“If that is your way of asking if I am involved with another, then my answer would be no, I am not. And you could’ve always approached me and spoken to me, it’s less creepy than getting stared at by a strange man. For all I know, you could be a serial killer and you’ve chosen me as your next victim.”</p><p>An amused twinkle filled his eyes as he took another sip from his tumbler.</p><p>“Then I suppose it’s a good job I’m not a serial killer and thought it best if you approach me first, as I didn’t wish to make you uncomfortable. It would be such as shame for someone as beautiful as you to fall victim to such a fate,” he replied.</p><p>“You’re laying it on thick with the compliments, hoping I’ll be flattered by it?” She questioned.</p><p>“No, I’m only stating the obvious; surely you’re used to being complimented on your beauty.”</p><p>She snorted at him. “Surprisingly, it doesn’t happen as often as you think it does. I’m complimented on a lot of things, my work ethic, my achievements, but never my appearance.”</p><p>“That I don’t believe,” he spoke, deliberately trailing his eyes over her.</p><p>“You should, it’s not often I dress as I have this evening,” she shrugged her shoulders. His eyes held hers before he lifted his free hand from the counter and held it out to her.</p><p>“Derek,”</p><p>She lifted her much small hand and slipped it into his, sharing a gentle, but firm handshake.</p><p>“Hermione,” she replied.</p><p>“Unusual name,” he commented.</p><p>“Not the first time I’ve heard that, most can’t even pronounce it.”</p><p>He chuckled at her, before lifting his tumbler to his lips and downing the rest of the alcohol.</p><p>“Can I buy you a drink?”</p><p>“I’ve think I’ve had enough, thank you, and I think you’re done for the evening, too.” He raised an eyebrow in question. “You and I both know what your intentions are towards me, and to be honest with you, I’ve had a pretty shitty week and I’m hoping you can be the distraction I need for the time being.”</p><p>A smirk pulled at his mouth and he turned in his seat to better face her, he leaned forward and his arm brushed against hers which was resting on the counter.</p><p>“If you’re looking for a distraction, why did you send the bartender over to the blonde?”</p><p>“You’ve been watching me longer than I realised,” she commented. “And let’s just say you were right about your decision to not approach me first. That bartender happened to be getting on my nerves whilst I was trying to sulk in silence.” He chuckled at her. “As for the blonde, she’s more of his type than I am.”</p><p>“You’re a beautiful woman, what makes you say that?”</p><p>“He couldn’t handle me, and you? Well, it’s your decision if we find out or not.”</p><p>She stood from her chair, righted her dress and then walked away, feeling his eyes on her retreating form. She made her way out of the bar and towards the elevator, and once it opened she slipped inside. Since it was empty, she quickly removed her wand and the holster from her thigh and slipped it into her clutch purse, and just as the doors were closing, he slipped inside the elevator and stood at the other side, now wearing a matching grey suit jacket and his hands were stuffed into his trouser pockets. She looked at him silently with a questioning gaze, as he leaned back against the wall with his dark eyes watching her.</p><p>“Twenty-second floor,” he answered her unasked question.</p><p>“Eighteenth,” she replied, pushing the button for her floor seeing as hers was closer.</p><p>They made the journey in silence, never taking their eyes away from their shared intense gaze and when they reached her floor, he followed her to her room. She took the key card from her clutch purse and entered into the room, allowing him to shut the door behind him as she flicked on the lights, the room being dimly lit. She threw her clutch purse onto the couch in her room and slipped off her heels, before walking straight past the massive bed and over to the large windows, looking out to the beautiful view of Washington D.C in its nightlife.</p><p>She sighed and brought both hands up to the back of her neck, turning her neck this way and that until it clicked. She caught his reflection in the glass, he had removed his jacket and settled it on the couch, before he moved to stand behind her, not quite touching her but she could feel his presence and hear his breathing.</p><p>“It’s been a long day,” she muttered, her eyes fluttering closed when his hands came up to grip her hips and he tugged her back gently until she was flush against him.</p><p>She allowed her hands to drop to her sides and a sigh passed through her lips when he bent his head and placed kisses to her neck and shoulder, his tongue darting out to lick at her skin and his facial hair scratched against her deliciously, sending bolts of pleasure to her core. A deep chuckle left him when she sagged back into his body and his grip on her hips tightened.</p><p>Not liking him having so much control over her, she turned the tables, spinning in his hold until they were face to face, and now that she’d taken off her heels he was much taller than she was and she was forced to reach up on her tiptoes, her hands wound around the back of his neck and she pulled his head down to hers, her mouth crashing against his.</p><p>It was clear she had surprised him with the sudden fiery passion of her kiss, but when she bit at his lip and soothed the sting with her tongue, his hands moved to trail over her body, slipping the thin straps off her shoulders and his hands moving to her back, easily pulling the zip down and exposing her soft skin. She tugged his shirt out of the waistband of his trousers as his tongue entered through her parted lips and she quickly undone the buttons, revealing the expanse of the thick muscle of his torso and her hands greedily ran over his hot skin.</p><p>He brought his hands away from her body, allowing his shirt to fall to the ground before his hands moved to her arse, and she hopped up when he hauled her off her feet and pressed her against the cold glass of the window, her legs wrapping around him and locking her ankles at the small of his back.  </p><p>She wasn’t wearing a bra beneath her dress and his hand ran the length of her back, her skin erupting into goosebumps and her hips bucked against him when one hand squeezed her arse and the other skimmed the skin of her thigh.</p><p>He let out another chuckle until she wound a hand into his hair and tugged, earning a wolf-like growl rumbling from his chest. One of his hands slipped between them, hiked her dress up further before it burrowed under the fabric and without warning, he pushed her underwear aside, ran his fingers through her slick folds and then plunged two fingers into her.</p><p>A gasp of surprise and pleasure tore from her as she pulled back from him and her head fell back against the window, as her eyes closed tightly, she breathed heavily and her hand tightened in his hair whilst the other clung to his shoulder, her nails digging into him and leaving marks.</p><p>He moved his mouth to her neck, nibbling and suckling at the skin as he turned her into a writhing mess against him. A moan fell from her lips when his thumb found her nub and her walls started to flutter around his fingers. He was muttering against her skin, she couldn’t hear what he was saying or understand it for that matter as it sounded foreign, Spanish she thought.</p><p>He knew she was close to the edge and it wasn’t hard to see that, she clung to him tightly; her body shaking in anticipation and her noises of pleasure were getting louder, breathier and happening more often. And just as she was about to be sent hurtling off the edge, he pulled his hand away from her and a whine she was unable to stop left her.</p><p>He chuckled deeply, his head still buried against her neck and his stubble-like facial hair still scratching against her skin, driving her crazy.</p><p>“I swear to God, I’ll bite you,” she breathed out, a slight growl wrapping around her words.</p><p>He pulled back to look at her, a smirk on his face and his dark eyes filled with amusement and heat. “That’s usually my way of threatening someone,” he said amused.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him and tightened her hand in his hair, deliberately tugging hard on the strands and much to her annoyance, it only seemed to amuse him further.</p><p>“Not tonight.”</p><p>“We’ll see,”</p><p>“I <em>will</em> bite you,” she promised.</p><p>His smirk seemed to widen and before he could retort, she pulled his mouth back to hers and silenced him with a fierce kiss, as the hand on his shoulder slipped down his chest and over his rock hard stomach until she reached his trousers. Unable to undo the belt without both hands, she had to bring the other from his hair and she made quick work of pulling the belt from the belt loops and dropping it to the floor with a clatter.</p><p>She unzipped his trousers and unfastened the button and slipped her hand beneath his trousers and underwear and wrapped it around his length, squeezing gently. He muttered a curse against her mouth and she smirked, before sweeping her tongue into his mouth and meeting his own.</p><p>As she moved her hand over him, she pulled her mouth from his and buried her lips against his neck, nipping and suckling at his skin as she took note of his reactions to certain speeds, motions or pressures used, figuring out how best to work him up. It was her turn to laugh as his hands gripped at her hips tightly, likely to leave bruises, and his forehead dropped to lean against her shoulder, and he turned his head so his nose nuzzled at her throat.</p><p>Another growl left him when she pulled his earlobe into her mouth and suckled at it, and then she pulled back from him and dropped her mouth to his shoulder, where she ran her teeth over his skin, before gently sinking them into him.</p><p>A louder, more animalistic growl left him and she laughed against his skin as she did it again.</p><p>“Told you I’d bite you,” she breathed against his ear.</p><p>He muttered something she didn’t understand before she hissed in surprise when he did the same, gently biting at her shoulder. She knew he was close, his breathing was getting heavier and his hips had started moving more erratically. His breath hitched and before he found his relief, Hermione pulled her hand back from him and he let out a noise of warning but she ignored it. He lifted his head from her shoulder and gave her a less than pleased look and she smiled at him innocently.</p><p>“It’s not nice to tease, is it?” She said sweetly.</p><p>“Lesson learned,” he replied, his eyes darker than she’d seen them.</p><p>“Good, because I really will bite you and I’ll be sure to mark you.”</p><p>Her words seemed to amuse him more than anything and she was going to say more, but he closed the distance and latched his mouth back onto hers, silencing her and putting her attention elsewhere. She returned her hands to running back over his torso and felt him remove a hand from her arse, before hearing him looking for something in his pocket.</p><p>She pulled back from him to see the familiar foil wrapper being pulled from his wallet, which he then dropped to the floor. She took it from him and brought her mouth back to his as she moved her hands to shifting his trousers and underwear down his legs until his length was free from its restraints.</p><p>She knew what a condom was, she was still raised in the Muggle World after all, and Ron had once gotten curious and used one, quickly deciding afterwards that he didn’t like it and much preferred the use of a Contraception Charm. She wasted no time in ripping open the wrapper and quickly putting it on him. She didn’t see the point in telling him she was already on contraception; it wouldn’t do any harm to use other protection, too.</p><p>“Just do it,” she told him when she felt him fiddling with her underwear, knowing they would get in the way and the only way to get them off would be for him to put her down, but he didn’t seem to want to. In fact, he was a lot stronger than she realised. He’d been holding the majority of her weight for a long time and didn’t even seem the least bit bothered.</p><p>He breathed against her neck before she heard the tearing of her underwear and he pulled the ripped fabric from between them and dropped them to the floor. His breath hitched a little when she wrapped her hand around him and pumped her hand up and down, before guiding him towards her centre. He shifted her weight slightly and she bit her lip when she felt him nudge at her entrance before he slipped into her.</p><p>“Oh Gods!” She gasped, her head falling back against the window as he stretched her and reached places she didn’t even know she had, and Ron certainly hadn’t either. As if, sex with a stranger was better than sex with the man she’d once loved.</p><p>He muttered something against her neck, his grip on her hips was tighter than it had ever been and she was half worried he’d break something, until he took a breath and his grip loosened. When he didn’t move or pull back, she deliberately clenched her walls around him. He grunted in surprise before pulling back from her, locking his gaze on her.</p><p>“Message received,” he murmured, before taking her mouth in a consuming kiss as he pulled his hips back and thrust into her slowly, wishing to draw it out.</p><p>She caught on to his intentions and she tugged at his hair, squeezed her thighs around him tighter and bit at his lip, effectively breaking his control and he increased his pace. She was so tightly wound that the climb to the top took no time at all and when he hit a particular spot inside of her, her walls clamped around him without warning and a keening whine tore from her throat and was caught in his mouth.</p><p>She pulled back from him, her breathing heavy, her mouth parted and her skin flushed pink. She pressed herself against the glass behind her, feeling the coolness helping to cool her skin and he slowed his thrusts, allowing her time to gain her bearings.</p><p>“Okay,” she said, lifting her head and looking into his eyes as he raised an eyebrow. “Your turn,” she told him, before pushing away from the window entirely and leaning into him as she pulled him into a kiss.</p><p>To her surprise he didn’t topple backwards or stumble under her full weight as he supported her, he barely even moved. He pulled away from the windows and quickly made his way to the bed, lowering her down onto it until her back pressed against the soft sheets and he was hunched over her, his forearms pressed on either side of her head as he kissed her hungrily and her hips moved against his.</p><p>Much to her surprise, he quickly brought her to another orgasm when his hand snaked between them to play with her bundle of nerves, and she tore her mouth from his and threw her head back, a high pitched noise leaving her as she raked her nails down his back, a hiss of pain leaving him but it didn’t stop his thrusts as he prolonged the pleasure.</p><p>She’d never had two orgasms during sex before; with Ron she was lucky if she even got one. At the beginning of their relationship when they were still teenagers he’d been too excited, but as the years passed by he just wanted to get it over with. This was a new experience for her and she wasn’t sure how to handle it.</p><p>She shook her head slightly when she heard him chuckling and it brought her attention back to the handsome man above her.</p><p>“I thought I said it was your turn,” she spoke, deliberately digging her nails into the small of his back and he hissed, before chuckling once more.</p><p>She brought her hands away from him and gripped at the tie that was still around his neck, and with it, she pulled him down so she could kiss him until it stopped his laughter and a growl left him when she nibbled at his lips, and then at his jaw.</p><p>“So that’s why you left it,” he murmured.</p><p>She hummed against his skin in response, dragging her teeth across his jaw and down his throat, causing his breath to hitch. She laughed this time, before tugging at the tie once more until he fell on top of her, his body pressing hers into the mattress. With a strength that clearly surprised him, she was able to roll him onto his back and she followed after him, moving to straddle him.</p><p>She locked her eyes with his before crossing her arms at the hem of her dress and pulling it up and over her head, dropping it to the floor and leaving her completely bare to his gaze. He must’ve liked what he saw as his eyes flashed a bright blue -that she thought she’d imagined- and they trailed her body hungrily. She brought her hand up to her hair and removed the clip keeping the rest of her wild mane from her face, and it spilled down her back and over her shoulders in an untameable mass of curls until it stopped at her waist.</p><p>“It’s a lot longer than it looks,” she shrugged her shoulders when she saw him eyeing her hair strangely.</p><p>Before she could blink his hands had lifted to bury in her hair, getting tangled in the soft strands and he pulled her down to kiss him hungrily. She kept her balance as she pressed her elbows on either side of his head and she started to move her hips as he moved beneath her, and every so often, she was sure to deliberately clench her pelvic muscles and every time she did, he would mutter a curse word against her mouth or he would tug at her hair, his hands still buried in the mass of curls.</p><p>She was growing tired and she was grateful when he finally found his release, his thrusts becoming erratic and he pulled his mouth from hers and buried his face against her neck as a growl left him and his movements slowed to a stop.</p><p>They stayed in their positions until Hermione had gotten her breathing back and then she climbed off him -after disentangling his hands from her hair as he didn’t seem to want to let go- and collapsed beside him, staring up at the ceiling and feeling tired, boneless, and more sated than she had in her entire life.</p><p>“So, was I the distraction you needed?” He asked, breaking the silence in the room.</p><p>She turned her head to look at him, seeing that he had done the same and their gazes locked.</p><p>She felt a smirk pull at her mouth as she answered him. “I don’t know, it’s barely ten o’clock, the night isn’t over.”</p><p>A smirk of his own appeared on his face.</p><p align="center">~000~000~000~</p><p>Hermione was woken by sunlight streaming through the windows of her room and partially bathing the bed and her in its warmth. Her eyes fluttered open before squinting in the light and she groaned in annoyance. A shifting behind her pulled her attention and that was when she was reminded of her actions of the night before, and she felt a blush cover her cheeks as she buried her face in her hands.</p><p>She wasn’t a person to have a one night stand, especially with a random stranger she’d just met in a bar, and despite being a little surprised by her own decision making, she found that she wasn’t ashamed by what she’d done. She was a single, free woman who could do whatever she wanted without having to explain herself to anyone. And she didn’t regret what she’d done; she needed the distraction and the relief he brought her and she’d never felt so calm and relaxed in her life. A smile pulled at her mouth and she had to fight back a giddy laugh.</p><p>There was a heavyweight over her waist and a hot hand pressed against her stomach, and she carefully turned over in bed to face the man responsible for her good mood. He was laid on his stomach with his face turned to the side facing her, the sheets pooled around his waist leaving his back bare to her gaze and for the first time she noticed the large tattoo that sat in-between his shoulder blades below the back of his neck. It was a strange design of three spirals being joined together in the centre and it was done in black-blue ink. He had one arm hooked over his pillow and the other flung over her waist.</p><p>Hermione bit at her lip as her eyes trailed his face; he really was very handsome. Looking over her shoulder at the alarm clock that sat on the bedside table, she knew she didn’t have long before her port key was scheduled to leave and she had to get a move on. With one last look to her handsome bedmate, she was careful to slip from his hold without waking him, which was a lot harder than it looked as he kept trying to pull her back into him.</p><p>Not wanting to wake him, she tiptoed through her room, took her wand from her clutch purse and headed into the bathroom, closing the door behind her and putting up a Silencing Charm so the noise of the shower wouldn’t wake him. She would’ve just used a few Cleaning Charms if it had been any other day and she was running late, but she and Derek had been <em>very</em> active the previous night and it would be better if she showered. Her body and muscles ached like they’d never before and she was hoping the heat of the water would ease the aches.</p><p>She hopped into the shower and quickly washed and then dried, summoning her regular clothing of trainers, skinny jeans and a t-shirt, before pulling her hair into a ponytail and leaving the bathroom, seeing that he was still asleep and now clutching at her pillow.</p><p>She quickly collected her belongings and packed them all away, making sure she hadn’t missed anything and before she left, she gathered Derek’s clothing and set them on the end of the bed, along with his belt and wallet on top of his clothing.</p><p>She spotted the notepad and pen on the table and decided to leave him note, which she read over three times.</p><p>
  <em>Derek,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You were the exact distraction I needed. I’d be sure to be out by noon; otherwise, the maid will get a lovely surprise in the form of a half-naked male and I’m sure it’ll just make her day. I found your wallet underneath the couch, everything’s there. Not everyone is as honest as I am; be careful where you leave it.</em>
