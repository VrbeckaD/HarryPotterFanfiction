    <p>Draco slipped out of the Room of Requirement, feeling completely and utterly hopeless.</p>
<p>Well, this was it. He was going to die. There was no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Dread clawed its way up his throat at the thought, and he felt like vomiting. He rubbed a trembling hand over his face and released a shaky breath.</p>
<p>Christ, he was <em>fucked</em>. As fucked as anyone could be.</p>
<p>He'd failed, yet again, to fix the Vanishing Cabinet. He simply couldn't do it. He had tried everything, <em>everything, </em>and it...</p>
<p>Draco whipped his head around, eyes darting around the deserted corridor. He could have sworn he'd just heard something. He narrowed his eyes and stared into the shadows, but nothing was there.</p>
<p>Great, now he was paranoid on top of everything else. Though given the current situation, he probably had good reason to be.</p>
<p>It was probably Potter, the specky git, he had been following Draco around, under that ridiculous cloak of his, every chance he got.</p>
<p>Draco breathed in deeply, trying to calm his frayed nerves. If Potter was spying on him right now, he really ought to be careful. He couldn't give anything away. He had to act normal.</p>
<p>Draco continued down the darkened corridor, shoving his hands into his pockets in a relaxed manner. Every so often he would glance out of the arched windows as he strolled by them at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>Nothing to see here, just a student taking a midnight stroll through the castle, everyone did it, it wasn't really <em>that</em> suspicious... Except maybe it was. He was a Death Eater now after all, and he was pretty sure that Potter had almost figured it out because why else would the annoying twat follow Draco around and glare at him knowingly whenever they shared a class together?</p>
<p>Draco tried not to dwell on that thought because if Potter really did know, then he was <em>definitely</em> fucked, and it was only a matter of time before the Order of the Phoenix took him in.</p>
<p>Maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing. They wouldn't outright kill him, and perhaps if he cooperated, they would cut him a little slack, eventually... but his Mother - his heart dropped to his stomach - she would die for his treachery. She will probably die anyway because he couldn't complete the tasks the Dark Lord had set him.</p>
<p>Either way he was totally fucked.</p>
<p>Draco was suddenly angry. Angry at everything. Angry at the fact that he couldn't do what was needed of him and especially angry at Perfect, Fuck-Boy, Potter.</p>
<p>Life just wasn't <em>fair</em>.</p>
<p>Draco felt so alone, he felt like he couldn't trust anyone, not his friends, <em>no one</em>. The only person he was certain he could trust was his Mother, but he'd been cut off from all contact with her until the tasks were complete. He had no one to talk to about this, he was bearing this burden alone, and he could barely stand the weight of it.</p>
<p>Draco heard a shoe scuff on the stone floor behind him and knew for certain now that Potter was following him. Again. The <em>Bastard</em>.</p>
<p>Draco spun around to face the seemingly empty corridor, grey eyes narrowing dangerously. He heard the unmistakable sound of a sharp intake of breath just off to the left of where he stood, and sneered before charging in that direction. He felt his body come into contact with an invisible, yet solid, form and propelled himself forward until he rammed the arsehole right into the stone wall.</p>
<p>There was a pained wheeze followed by a gasping splutter, and then Draco gripped a handful of the invisibility cloak and pulled.</p>
<p>"<em>Granger?</em>" he said, disbelievingly. "What the fuck are you doing? Where's Potter? And why do you have his cloak?"</p>
<p>Hermione, still gasping for breath after having the wind knocked out of her, gazed up into partly confused but mostly angry grey eyes.</p>
<p>"Well?" the blond demanded.</p>
<p>"Can't," <em>gasp, </em>"breathe,"<em> gasp.</em></p>
<p>Draco released her and took a step back, rolling his eyes in disgust as he watched her bend over and attempt to even out her breathing. "This is what you get for following me around," he hissed angrily. "This is an invasion on my privacy."</p>
<p>Hermione simply glared at him and continued to wheeze.</p>
<p>"I know that Potter has been following me around for weeks, I'm not simple and Potter isn't as stealthy as he thinks he is, even with his stupid cloak. I must admit though, I didn't know that you were in on this farce too, though I shouldn't be surprised. I suppose Weasley's involved as well," he continued. <em>Fucking Gryffindors</em>. "What is the bloody meaning of this? I've been keeping to myself since the start of term. All I want is to be left alone."</p>
<p>"Well that's just it," Hermione said, straightening up, her breathing almost back to normal now. "You're acting strange, Harry thinks you're up to something. <em>Are</em> you up to something, Malfoy?" she asked with a slight lilt to her tone.</p>
<p>Draco stared at her, his heart kicking up a notch. Potter was onto him, he'd known it, but now it had been confirmed.</p>
<p>"Potter's an idiot," he answered calmly and matter-of-factly. "I thought you were supposed to be smart, Granger? Clearly you're not if you're listening to the likes of him."</p>
<p>Hermione gritted her teeth in annoyance. Truth was, she didn't really think Malfoy was up to anything. She was doing this purely to satisfy Harry's suspicions. Harry seemed to think that Malfoy had taken the Dark Mark, but Hermione and Ron weren't convinced, he was 16 for Christ's sake, but even though Hermione didn't believe Malfoy had fully joined the dark side, she had to admit that the blond was acting very peculiar indeed.</p>
<p>"You're acting strange, Malfoy," Hermione reiterated. "It's a fact and everyone has noticed. You barely talk to anyone, even your friends. You've completed isolated yourself. Why?"</p>
<p>"That's none of your fucking business," he spat. "Don't concern yourself with what I do or do not do."</p>
<p>Hermione sighed impatiently and rolled her eyes. "You're drawing attention to yourself, think about it. You've gone from being the loud, obnoxious, school bully to this quiet, introverted, person who ignores everyone he comes into contact with."</p>
<p>Malfoy's face went eerily blank at her summarisation of the sudden changes in him.</p>
<p>Had he really been that obvious? He tried to think back over the last few months but couldn't recall anything other than trying to fix that goddamn cabinet. It had literally taken over every aspect of his life. It was all that mattered these days. "I don't have to explain myself to you, Granger," he told her, voice quiet yet firm. "Just stay out of my fucking way and, while you're at it, tell Potter to go fuck himself."</p>
<p>At that, Draco turned on his heel, done with talking to the interfering cow.</p>
<p>"Harry's not going to stop," Hermione called after him. "He's convinced that you're up to something. Maybe if you didn't disappear into the Room of Requirement nearly every night, he wouldn't think anything was off. He knows that you go into the Room of Hidden Things, you spend hours in there. What is it that you're doing?"</p>
<p>Draco stopped dead in his tracks, his heart beating wildly in his chest. Potter knew a lot more than he'd originally thought. <em>Fuck</em>. If Potter found out, Draco was dead, Draco's Mother was dead.</p>
<p>"He will find out what you're up to," she added with certainty, and as the final word left her mouth, something in Draco snapped.</p>
<p>He spun around to face her, his expression cold and unnerving, as he stalked back towards her.</p>
<p>He felt wild inside. Wild with anger, fear and desperation. He was fighting a losing battle and, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't change the outcome, he had but four months to complete his tasks, and if he didn't... he swallowed thickly, not wanting to think about what would happen. And <em>Potter -</em> he cursed the name to the depths of hell and back - along with his little posse were onto him. They just couldn't leave well enough alone. They had to stick their noses in where they didn't belong. Draco felt positively murderous, he wanted revenge, he wanted to <em>hurt</em> Potter, but seeing as he wasn't here, the mudblood would have to do.</p>
<p>Draco aimed his wand at the nearest classroom door, and with a whoosh it opened to slam against the stone wall.</p>
<p>Hermione cringed at the sound and glanced up and down the corridor, fearful that they would get caught out after curfew.</p>
<p>Draco sneered, not giving a toss if they were caught or not, he was beyond caring now. He gripped her upper arm and dragged her into the old disused classroom, swiftly closing and locking the door behind them before giving her a shove, which nearly had her falling flat on her face.</p>
<p>"Malfoy," she bit out, righting herself. "What on earth are you doing?"</p>
<p>Draco ignored her and flung up a series of privacy wards that had Hermione's eyes darkening with apprehension.</p>
<p>"Malfoy?" she said, firmer this time. "<em>What</em> are you doing?"</p>
<p>In truth, Draco hadn't a clue, he was just <em>doing</em>. He needed a release of some sort. He felt caged. Trapped. He figured that taking his anger out on one of the golden trio should make him feel marginally better.</p>
<p>He continued to ignore her as he stalked towards her.</p>
<p>"Malfoy-"</p>
<p>"Shut up."</p>
<p>Hermione gritted her teeth in annoyance, <em>how dare he tell her to shut up. </em>She raised her wand to hex him a good one, but he was quicker than she anticipated, and he had her disarmed before she even had the chance to utter a single word.</p>
<p>Draco threw her wand, as well as his own, to the far corner of the room before advancing on her again.</p>
<p>Hermione frowned in confusion as both wands rolled to rest against the wall, far out of reach.</p>
<p>"Why did you do that?" she asked, backing swiftly away from him. She wasn't scared of him, but she didn't want him near her either.</p>
<p>He smirked when he reached out and she dodged him by slipping under his arm and spinning away in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>
  <em>Smooth.</em>
</p>
<p>Draco turned slowly to face her. "You and those two dickheads you call your best friends have gotten on my last nerve, Granger," he told her calmly. "You're always there. Always getting in my way. Always <em>fucking</em> everything up. It's a shame, I don't really have anything against you or the weasel, except for the fact that you're a mudblood and he's a bloodtraitor, of course. Oh, and that you're friends with the chosen-pillock. Actually, come to think of it, I fucking <em>hate</em> you. <em>Despise you</em>."</p>
<p>Hermione narrowed her eyes. "The feeling's mutual, I can assure you."</p>
<p>This caused Draco to bark out a deep laugh.</p>
<p>Hermione stared at his perfectly straight, pearly white teeth and hated him just a little more.</p>
<p>Draco took another step towards her and then another, while Hermione took several steps back, always keeping a safe distance, until suddenly the backs of her legs connected with something hard, a desk by the feel of it, and she winced.</p>
<p>Malfoy's silver eyes flashed victoriously, and before Hermione knew it, he was right in front of her, trapping her against the desk.</p>
<p>"I'm not scared of you, Malfoy," she told him firmly, brown eyes staring up into captivating silver.</p>
<p>"You should be, Granger," he responded lowly, and she shivered. The way he'd said it, it was like a warning. Not in a threatening sense, more like a grave exhortation that shouldn't be ignored, which in her opinion was very scary indeed.</p>
<p>There were only a few inches between them, and Hermione could literally feel his body heat and smell the subtle scent of his alluring, likely expensive, cologne.</p>
<p>They stood staring at one another for long moments, too long to be acceptable by any means, both examining each other's faces like they'd never done before. They had never been this close before. It was strange, it was like they were looking at completely different people. Neither one of them moved or said a word for what felt like a very long time. The room was deathly silent, except for their slightly accelerated breaths.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do to me, Malfoy?" Hermione eventually asked, not being able to take the silence anymore, her voice quiet and timid. So unlike her usual confident, sometimes bossy, tone.</p>
<p>Draco lifted a slightly trembling hand to her face and ran it softly over her jaw before cupping the back of her head firmly.</p>
<p>Hermione's breath hitched, alarm bells sounding in her brain. She parted her lips to say something, but no words came forth. He looked fierce and determined, his silver eyes boring into hers, and it scared the shit out of her.</p>
<p>He inched forward, pressing his lithe, yet toned, frame against her shorter form. "Malfoy," she breathed, and just as the last syllable left her mouth he crashed his lips against hers.</p>
<p>Hermione's mind went blank of all thought, all thought expect for the lips moving tantalizingly over hers. Taking. Claiming. She fully lost herself in the rousing sensations of the dominating kiss. It was like nothing she had ever experienced before. It was raw, desperate, and maddening, all at the same time.</p>
<p>She felt the hand at the back of her head grip a handful of hair and pull, tugging her head back to deepen the kiss further. She moaned deeply, fully submitting to the tongue that forced its way past her lips and swirled against her own.</p>
<p>Her body zinged and pulsed with an arousal she had never felt before, it was like she couldn't control it. It was taking over every stray thought, as well as all her senses, whilst simultaneously sending her morals and values packing.</p>
<p>Hermione gasped as she felt herself being suddenly lifted, as if she weighed nothing at all, to be deposited roughly on top of the desk.</p>
<p>Hungry hands parted her legs and then ran up the outside of her thighs, under her skirt, gripping her hips firmly and pulling her flush against something long and hard that she felt jab her right in her core.</p>
<p>"<em>Ah</em>," she groaned, throwing her head back and breaking the kiss, spikes of pleasure radiating through her body.</p>
<p>She felt lips on her neck, sucking, kissing, and teeth grazing the sensitive skin. It was heavenly, and she never wanted it to stop.</p>
<p>Hermione pressed herself more firmly against the solid flesh at her core and rutted wantonly, moaning at the delicious friction and heightened sensations it caused. It was addicting, it was like a drug. She wanted more. She wanted to consume it all and drift away on a pleasure-filled high.</p>
<p>"<em>Fuck</em>," came a deep gravelly tone. "I fucking knew you'd be like this, Granger. Such a cock hungry <em>whore</em>."</p>
<p>At the sound of that despicable voice, Hermione's blood instantly turned to ice in her veins, her senses rushing back to her vividly and painfully acute.</p>
<p>She took in his swollen lips and flushed cheeks and then looked down at where their hips were fused together, her skirt bunched around her hips, exposing her bare thighs, and felt his erection pressing obscenely against her vagina.</p>
<p>What on earth was she <em>doing? </em>Had she lost her goddamn mind? This was Draco Malfoy!</p>
<p>Hermione pushed at his chest, causing him to stumble back a few steps. "Get away from me," she said, voice weak and trembling.</p>
<p>God, she felt sick.</p>
<p>Malfoy narrowed his eyes at her and then advanced on her again.</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes widened in fear at the wicked look on his aristocratic face, and she kicked her legs out to keep him from coming any closer. The toe of her shoe connected with his shin, and she watched him grit his teeth and let out a fowl curse.</p>
<p>"Stop," he growled menacingly. "Goddammit, stop!"</p>
<p>"Don't!" she yelled as he forced himself between her legs again and pinned her arms to her sides. "Please, don't, just let me go," she wiggled helpless for long moments before finally slumping against him in defeat. He was too strong for her. She couldn't get away.</p>
<p>"Don't act like the victim, Granger," he gritted in her ear. "You were rubbing yourself against me like a horny little slut. You were loving it. <em>You fucking wanted it</em>," he spat incredulously.</p>
<p>Hermione closed her eyes tightly as shame engulfed her. He was right, she did want it. And in some sick part of her mind <em>still</em> wanted it. What was wrong with her? <em>What was wrong with her!?</em></p>
<p>"<em>You</em> kissed <em>me</em>," she suddenly seethed, needing to defend herself in some way. "Why did you kiss me, Malfoy?" Malfoy stiffened against her, and she continued, feeling bolder by the second. "You started this. Not me. Why did you kiss me?!"</p>
<p>He snarled at her in response.</p>
<p>"You lifted me onto the desk," she hissed through gritted teeth. "You pressed yourself against <em>me</em>. You're hard! You want this too. So don't you dare point the finger and make me feel like a whore. You -"</p>
<p>"But you are a whore!" he proclaimed loudly and menacingly.</p>
<p>Hermione's hand whipped out, and she slapped him hard across the face, breathing hard from the rage coursing through her veins. She instantly cringed away from the crazed induced fury written all over his face, or at least as far away from him as she could in her current situation, expecting him to retaliate.</p>
<p>He did retaliate, just not in the way she expected him to.</p>
<p>One minute she was looking into storm-grey, livid eyes, and the next he was kissing her again like there was no tomorrow.</p>
<p>It was more desperate this time, more wild and animalistic.</p>
<p>Draco broke the kiss for a fraction of a second while he yanked her jumper over her head before crashing his lips back to hers, hungrily.</p>
<p>Hermione groaned, pressing herself closer to him, hands gripping his hair, nails digging in his neck, his shoulders - surely drawing blood. She needed <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>They broke apart, panting, as she attempted to rid him of his jumper and shirt. He ended up pulling his jumper off himself as Hermione tore at his shirt buttons, hastily yanking them through the holes.</p>
<p>Malfoy didn't bat an eyelid, instead he carefully undid her shirt buttons one by one, so calm in contrast to Hermione's frenzied manner, while she tugged on his belt and fumbled at the zipper on his trousers, her hands skimming over taunt abs and lean muscle.</p>
<p>Malfoy hissed when her fingers gripped him through his boxes, and he doubled his efforts, finally getting her shirt open and reaching around to deftly unclasp her bra and pull it down.</p>
<p>His hands cupped her bare breast, needing, squeezing, as she thrust her chest out arching her back towards him.</p>
<p>Draco hungrily kissed his way from her mouth down her neck and over her collarbone, until he found her right nipple and sucked it sharply into his mouth, ripping a high-pitched moan from her throat. His fingers grazed her thighs before hooking into her knickers and dragging them swiftly down her legs to her ankles.</p>
<p>Hermione felt a finger brush teasingly against her dripping wet slit before pushing through her folds, finding her clit and rubbing. She cried out as pleasure lanced through her body and unfurled low in her pelvis.</p>
<p>"Fuck, you're so wet," he groaned in her ear, sending shivers down her spine. "Do you like that?"</p>
<p>She felt a finger probe at her entrance and then slip in all the way to the knuckle. She rocked her hips on his hand as she pulled his head towards her and sucked his bottom lip into her mouth, biting and nibbling the flesh.</p>
<p>All too soon, he was pulling his hand away and replacing it with something long, thick, and hard.</p>
<p>Hermione gasped as she felt the blunt head of his cock press firmly against her entrance, stretching her out in a way she had never felt before. She hissed in pain and tried to pull away as he continued to push in further.</p>
<p>"No," he said firmly, gripping her hips tightly. "There's no going back now."</p>
<p>Hermione stared into wild, lust-filled silver eyes, pupils blown wide, and felt him thrust sharply into her, ripping her wide open and burying himself all the way to the hilt.</p>
<p>Hermione screamed in agony, fire burning her up from the inside out. "You bastard!" she sobbed.</p>
<p>"Ssh, ssh," he hushed her, smoothing the hair away from her face in an uncharacteristic gesture. "It will feel better in a minute, I promise. Just relax, please, just relax."</p>
<p>He withdrew a little and then pushed back in, groaning deeply as he did so.</p>
<p>Hermione squeezed her eyes shut and gripped at his shoulders, burying her face in his neck and wincing at the increased pain, wishing fervently for it to end. His dark musky scent surrounded her senses, slightly distracting her from what was happening.</p>
<p>Draco continued to thrust in and out of her, slowly at first, but then increasing the pace and driving in deeper. It was then that Hermione started to feel it, a small spark of pleasure deep in her pelvis. She gasped and angled her hips forward, meeting his thrusts, seeking more of it. She dug her nails into his bare back as he drove his cock into her again and again and again.</p>
<p>Malfoy lifted her up slightly and pushed her back on the desk before climbing on top of her and lifting one of her legs to rest on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Hermione cried out as pleasure shot up her spine and down her legs, shocking her with its sudden intensity. "Oh god, <em>yes</em>."</p>
<p>"Mmm," Malfoy hummed, pressing his face to her neck and licking. "Do you like that?"</p>
<p>"<em>More</em>," she choked out.</p>
<p>Draco pounded into her hard, sucking the skin of her neck into his mouth and biting the delicate flesh.</p>
<p>"Fuck," he groaned brokenly. "I'm gonna come. <em>Fuck</em>. I'm gonna come."</p>
<p>His admission, along with the way he proclaimed it - like he was in sweet agony - was enough to push her over the edge. She arched her back up and thrust her hips as her orgasm rocketed through her, sending her body spasming out of control as she screamed her release.</p>
<p>Malfoy felt the muscles of her walls pulse and clamp down around his cock and grunted lowly as he came in long spurts, come coating her insides. He collapsed on top of her with a satisfied groan and closed his eyes, sweet relief and peace washing over him for what felt like the first time in months.</p>
<p>Hermione lay with her eyes closed, basking in the aftermath of her blissful orgasm. It was like nothing she had ever felt before. She reveled in the feel of his full weight pressing her into the desk and allowed herself to get lost in the moment.</p>
<p>After a time, Draco opened his eyes and gazed at her face. She looked so relaxed and unconcerned, her eyes gently closed, cheeks flushed, and red swollen lips slightly parted. He looked at her hair, wild and out of control from his fingers combing through it, and wondered if this was what it looked like when she woke up every morning.</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes fluttering open, pulling him from his irrelevant thought, and he found himself staring into soft brown eyes.</p>
<p>He jerked upright as if startled and watched her wince as his cock slipped free of her. He glanced down at her open thighs, which were smeared red with blood and other bodily fluids, and felt his stomach churn unpleasantly.</p>
<p>
  <em>Shit. What had he done?</em>
</p>
<p>Suddenly, the weight of what had just happened bore down on him, almost crushing him. He felt panic grip him tightly by the throat. He could hardly breathe.</p>
<p>Draco looked back up at her and found her staring at his cock. He looked down at his mostly flaccid length, to see what she was looking at, and found it was covered in his come and her blood and juices.</p>
<p>He felt sick and <em>dirty</em>. What the fuck had he done?</p>
<p>Draco slid down from the desk and pulled up his boxers and trousers, fastening them hastily.</p>
<p>Hermione watched him silently, her heart thudding in her throat as she quickly scrambled off the desk and attempted to right her clothes, all manner of thoughts running through her mind at a million miles per second. Then, just as she was buttoning her shirt up, Malfoy rounded on her, his own shirt still gaping open and disheveled.</p>
<p>"You speak of this to <em>no one</em>," he growled, pointing his finger in her face. "Do you understand?"</p>
<p>Hermione felt a mixture of irrational hurt and very rational anger unfurl in her chest. She smacked his finger away. "As if I would," she spat back at him.</p>
<p>"This never happened," he swallowed. "Do you hear me? It never fucking happened."</p>
<p>"Forgot about it already," she told him and didn't feel bad at all that her hand print was still glowing on his cheek from when she'd slapped him earlier. In fact, she had a mind to give him a matching one on the other cheek.</p>
<p>His nostrils flared, and he glanced over her shoulder, virtually vibrating with anger, and then he spun around and snatched his tie and jumper from the floor before storming out of the classroom without so much as a backwards glance.</p>
<p>It was a long walk back to the Slytherin dungeons, she hoped he got caught on the way. She wondered how he would explain the state of his undress and found that she didn't care one iota.</p>
<p>Hermione bent and picked her jumper up from the floor, wincing at the ache she felt deep in her stomach. It brought what had just happened swiftly back to the forefront of her mind, but she instantly expelled it and pulled her jumper over her head. She couldn't think about any of that right now because if she did, she would surely fall apart.</p>
<p>She was glancing around the classroom, making sure there was no evidence of what had transpired, when she spotted two wands in the corner of the room by the door.</p>
<p>Hers and Draco Malfoy's.</p>
<p>She walked over and picked them both up, gripping them tightly in her hand before exiting the classroom and making her way back to Gryffindor Tower.</p>
<p>She had a feeling she wouldn't be getting any sleep tonight.</p>
