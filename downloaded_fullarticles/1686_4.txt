          <div class="userstuff"><p>There was something odd about Tom.</p><p>When he looked at Harry and smiled, Harry's heart filled in response. Distantly, as if he were underwater, he heard the sound of trumpets, a beautiful choir, nothing like he had ever heard before. And then Tom spoke and it faded back into the background.</p><p>"Angel," Tom greeted, holding out his arm. Harry fitted himself underneath it, basking in Tom’s presence and warmth. "What are you doing up?”</p><p>"I had a bad dream," Harry said. He buried his head in Tom's chest, breathing in the scent that was so uniquely Tom, and Tom wrapped his arms around him.</p><p>"About?" Tom's hand stroked down the length of his back, soothing him, a gentle up and down until his hand rested on the back of Harry's head.</p><p>"I don't remember." His voice came out muffled against Tom's shoulder. He closed his eyes. All he had was the vaguest impression of bright light, an endless, unearthly blue, and the feeling of falling, falling, falling…</p><p align="center">*</p><p>Tom rested his hand on Harry’s nape, feeling the softness of the hair there before he slid it up, all the way to the top of Harry’s head. The ring of fire above it was bright, blinding, and Tom could feel the heat of it against his skin.</p><p>He wondered if it’d hurt to touch it. If his very hand would burn from the halo that marked Harry as divine.</p><p>Harry didn't give him the chance to know. He pulled away from Tom and Tom’s hand slid free from his mess of hair. Harry gave him a strained smile, fatigue dragging at his features.</p><p>"What are you thinking about?" he asked. Tom smiled back, slow and amused.</p><p>"Angels," he said honestly.</p><p>"You believe in them?" Harry asked dubiously. It was ironic; the halo above his head was brighter than any Tom had ever seen before. The brilliant gold that lay just behind Harry’s green eyes was evidence enough of the boy's power and blood.</p><p>"Of course.”</p><p>"If there are angels," Harry mused, "then there must be demons as well.”</p><p>"Oh?" Unseen to Harry, Tom’s pointed tail flicked up and wrapped around Harry’s waist, lazily possessive. Harry nudged their foreheads together, and Tom wondered, not for the first time, if Harry could feel the horns protruding from Tom's temples, even if he was blind to them.</p><p>"I suppose there are." Tom held him close. What God had put together, no man could tear asunder. </p><p>No god had brought them together, but Tom was sure now.</p><p>There was nothing in the world, nothing in the heavens nor the realms of hell that could separate them.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>Harry Potter was marked with the Divine.</p><p>The day they met, it only took one look. Harry was across the room then, but even on the other side and through the crowd, Tom saw it.</p><p>A ring of fire encircled Harry's head, illuminating the space around him. A beacon that drew the eye, a lighthouse in the dark. Tom had never seen anything so brilliant, so bright, as if God himself had plucked the stars from the sky and crowned this boy.</p><p>Danger, it warned other demons. <em>Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.</em></p><p>But Tom wasn't like other demons. He had power. He walked the Earth amongst the humans, whispered into their ears, made deals with the desperate only to bring them lower. He was temptation incarnate, and everyone was weak to temptation.</p><p>He just needed to find the one.</p><p>He walked up to Harry Potter then and stuck out his hand.</p><p>"Hello," he said, and Harry turned. "My name is Tom."</p><p>Harry blinked up at him. He had no wings—not yet, not ever, if Tom had his way—but Tom was struck by the eyes that met his. An unreal shade of green and gold that befitted God's favored and only hinted at the grace that lurked underneath. Celestial. Tom didn't falter, his interest only further piqued.</p><p>Scholars defined the Devil through Before and After his Fall. He was Lucifer before it, the light-bringer, God's most beautiful angel. And After, he was only Satan. The Liar. The Deceiver.</p><p>How would they define Harry Potter? Tom wondered. He already knew.</p><p>Before Tom and then—</p><p>There would be no After Tom, Tom abruptly decided. He would make sure of it.</p><p>Harry took his hand.</p><p>"Harry," he said and smiled, friendly and guileless. So lovely and innocent. Tom couldn't wait to see him ruined. "It's nice to meet you."</p><p align="center">*</p><p>"Come with me," Tom said. He was unnaturally handsome, far too perfect, his face symmetrical and unblemished. His smile was sly, but there was just something about him that drew Harry like a moth to a flame. They had only just met, but Harry was already rapt, unable to look away.</p><p>Tom held out his hand, expectant and waiting, and his eyes were dark and endless.</p><p>Did the moth know its fate? Did it know the flame would burn?</p><p>Danger, something in him warned, because Harry was neither a moth nor entirely oblivious. It came straight from the deepest parts inside him, that instinct-driven creature that feared the dark and what lay in it.</p><p><em>Fight! Flee!</em> it said.</p><p>"Where are you taking me?" Harry asked instead, breathless and drawn in. He had always been weak to beautiful men. He took Tom's hand and Tom pulled him in, his eyelids at half-mast.</p><p>Tom reached up to stroke his hair back, lingering over the top of his head.</p><p>"Everywhere," Tom replied. His eyes were intense on Harry’s, searching for something in them. What, Harry wasn’t quite sure.</p><p>When he tipped Harry’s head back and then kissed him, firm and unhesitant, Harry knew then that he’d do anything for Tom.</p><p>Tom pulled away.</p><p>A car passed by them, and for a moment, the headlights illuminated Tom's face.</p><p>His eyes looked red.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>"Open your mouth."</p><p>Harry's lips parted, and he almost moaned as he bit down on the peach slipped in between his lips, ripe and juicy. His tongue darted out to take it in, to taste, and he sighed in pleasure as Tom followed it up with a sweet kiss. It was almost as sweet as the peach itself.</p><p>"Good?" Tom asked, voice velvet-smooth. He had a small, satisfied smile on his lips as he watched Harry eat.</p><p>Harry swallowed. He cleared his throat. "Yeah," he said, his voice still coming out in a rasp. He licked his lips. "Another?"</p><p>Tom held out the peach in his hands, and Harry leaned forward, closing his lips around it to bite down once more. His eyes went half-lidded as he hummed. The mere brush of Tom's fingertips against his mouth had him shivering.</p><p>The fruits were fresh, decadent, and rich. It was better than anything Harry had ever had before, each taste only leaving him hungry for more. The wine they had been consuming was warm in his stomach, leaving Harry's limbs lax and loose. The price tag on this was astronomical, he knew. Only the best for him, Tom had said.</p><p>He opened his eyes, and he saw the look on Tom's face. He looked ravenous, ready to devour Harry, and Harry's mouth went dry.</p><p>"Why are we doing this again?" he asked, just slightly breathless, and Tom smiled at him.</p><p>"You've grown up so sheltered," Tom said, reaching out to press his fingers against Harry's mouth. Harry's tongue darted out, teasing the tips of them, and Tom's eyes darkened. "I'm showing you how much the world has to offer, angel."</p><p>"You keep calling me that." Harry's cheeks were stained with embarrassment and alcohol, and the drink encouraged him to continue, "I like it."</p><p>Tom looked amused. His gaze slid down to the peaches between them, the pink color of them utterly tempting. "Eat more," Tom prodded, but Harry shook his head.</p><p>"I'm full," he admitted, and Tom made a disapproving sound. Harry huffed and dropped his gaze, picking up his glass of wine. They had gone through an entire bottle, already on their second, and while Harry was already past tipsy, Tom looked unaffected still. He had unbuttoned the top two buttons of his shirt, revealing a pale strip of tempting skin that Harry couldn't stop staring at, but that was all.</p><p>"One last," Tom prodded, holding out the fondue fork. Harry opened his mouth, and Tom fed him, the burst of sweet flavor somehow better when it came from Tom.</p><p>"Did you like it?"</p><p>"I love it," Harry breathed. He wasn't looking at the food.</p><p>"Come here." Tom's smile was full of tempting promise. Harry went.</p><p>Tom pulled him into a languid kiss then, mouth hot and wet, and Harry burned. It was nothing like anything he had ever felt before. Harry's nerves lit up raw. He felt as if he was being buffeted by strong winds, helpless to his all-consuming pleasure. There was nothing but Tom, nothing but Tom and Harry alone.</p><p>"I've never done this before," Harry confessed, scarcely able to breathe as Tom pushed him onto his back. He wetted his lips, staring up at Tom above him. The moonlight from behind him framed his face in a delicate halo, illuminating his handsome features.</p><p>"Don't worry," Tom murmured, kissing down his throat, his chest, all the way down to his navel. He laid his cheek there on the jut of Harry's hip for a moment, inhaling, and Harry shuddered.</p><p>Harry squirmed, panting, and all he could do was hold onto the sheets for dear life as Tom brought him over the edge, the cliff, the peak, and Harry was falling, falling, falling…</p><p align="center">*</p><p>Harry Potter was the sort of boy that deserved to be worshipped, to be touched with reverent awe in wordless praise until he was brought to the heights of ecstasy.</p><p>But Tom wasn’t the sort to give worship, no, not even to a masterpiece of God. He was the worshipped, not the worshipper, and vicious, visceral satisfaction filled him as he gazed downwards.</p><p>On his knees, pious and prostrate, Harry Potter stared up at him. His face was tipped upwards, the light from the ring of fire above his head delicately framing his face. He looked radiant, splendid, and his smile was beatific even as he reached out to touch Tom's thighs with both hands, sliding them up to frame Tom's hardening length, inexperienced yet bold.</p><p>Tom reached out, and the back of his hand was gentle on Harry's cheek.</p><p>Harry's eyes turned half-lidded at the contact, hiding the unearthly gold.</p><p>It was the last gentle touch he had that night. Tom's reached out to grab onto the back of his head, rough, merciless, and he fucked into Harry's pretty pink mouth with no remorse. Harry's messy hair threaded through his fingers, and the fire burned in Tom at the sight of tears brimming at the corners of Harry's eyes.</p><p>Harry's fingers at his hips dug in, his blunt nails providing little pinpricks of pain even as he took Tom's cock into his mouth.</p><p>The real purity of a soul couldn't be measured in terms of virginity or sexual innocence. This, Tom knew all too well.</p><p>But oh, Harry was so pliant, clay to be molded in Tom’s likeness, and Tom greedily took him in hand.</p><p>Tom lifted Harry up into his lap, his hands on Harry's waist firm as he guided him to sink down onto his cock. Harry moaned and threw his head back, sightless eyes directed to the heavens. Tom fucked into him, the slap of skin loud in the room, Harry's gasps and moans so sweet in the night air.</p><p>Tom dug his teeth into Harry's shoulder, hissing, taking his pleasure without care for Harry's own. He bit down, licking and sucking until there was sure to be a mark there, a dark bruise with Tom's name on it.</p><p>Harry cried out as if it hurt. He cried out as if he loved it.</p><p>He flipped them, Harry beneath, and lifted up his sweet angel's leg to his shoulders. He pounded into Harry, his teeth gritted, and was blessed in return with Harry's sobs of pleasure as his toes curled, his back arched, his hands dug into Tom's sheets.</p><p>Harry begged for him, writhing in wanton desperation, and Tom took it in.</p><p>"Please, Tom, please—I," his voice cracked, so, so lovely, and Tom reached up to wrap his hand around Harry's throat.</p><p>"Oh God," Harry gasped out, his eyes slipping closed, and Tom squeezed.</p><p>"Look at me," he demanded, voice gravel-rough, and Harry's lids fluttered open. The green in his eyes was swallowed up by the black of his pupils, dark with lust and desire, and Tom hissed low and pleased as Harry cursed and pled and took God's name in vain.</p><p>And yet, and yet, the bits of Harry's soul that Tom could see were still a blinding white, untouched, Tom's darkness dissipating into it as if it was nothing.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>"You've been coming home late."</p><p>Harry looked up, and his heart pounded in his chest. Hermione didn't look mad, but there was a furrow in her brows, disapproval clear in her tone.</p><p>"I'm sorry," he said. "I've been—" he faltered. Flushed. The mere memory of what he had been doing the night before made him feel hot. It was tinged with a drunken haze, but Harry could still remember clearly Tom putting him on his hands and his knees, fucking roughly into him from behind, his grip on Harry's hair painful. He ached still.</p><p>"Busy," Harry finally said, but at Hermione’s flat look, he grimaced.</p><p>"Who have you been hanging out with?"</p><p>"I—" Harry swallowed. He didn't know, but he didn't want to share Tom with anyone. He didn't want to even put a voice to what they had, the thing between them still too new and raw. "Just the others on the team. The usual."</p><p>"Oh?" Hermione asked. "Doing what?"</p><p>Harry wetted his lips. "Exploring," he said, and it came out breathy. "Trying new things."</p><p>Hermione gave him a searching look.</p><p>"Just be careful, Harry," she finally said. A warning.</p><p>Harry ducked his head. "Of course, ‘Mione."</p><p align="center">* </p><p>"Tom," Harry breathed, as if his very name was sacred, a prayer on his pretty pink lips. "This is—it's too much. I can't accept this. It's so expensive."</p><p>Tom had taken to spending money on Harry. He couldn't resist, and Harry took to it so beautifully. He accepted each gift as if it was a blessing, a miracle from up high, and Tom would never say no to some properly placed gratitude.</p><p>"You can," Tom soothed. He stepped up behind Harry, eyeing the both of them in the mirror, and slid his hands to frame Harry's slim hips. His lithe figure looked even better clothed in a bespoke suit. "It looks perfect, angel."</p><p>Harry flushed, so full of vitality and life. He bowed his head in modesty and Tom smiled.</p><p>Tom dipped his head then to skim his lips against Harry's neck, his grip tightening around Harry's hips. When Harry tipped his head up, Tom's mouth met his. He could taste the Grace, the light inside Harry, everything good given human form. All good and perfect things came from above.</p><p>He bit down until he could taste blood.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>"Eat this," Tom said, and Harry ate.</p><p>"Drink this," Tom said, and Harry drank.</p><p>"Try this," Tom said, passing him a white, innocent-looking pill, and Harry faltered.</p><p>"I'm not sure," Harry said, uncertain. This was different, miles away from decadent food or lavish gifts. He looked around nervously. He felt as if a thousand eyes were upon him, his neck and his back pricking in discomfort.</p><p>"Just once," Tom pushed.</p><p>Harry's breath came short, and his eyes darted up to Tom's impatient gaze then back down to the unassuming pill.</p><p>"I'll be here with you." Tom touched his hand, anchoring and steady. "Don't be afraid."</p><p>It was dark. A valley of darkness where Harry could see nothing beyond Tom's eyes, could feel nothing but his touch. "I fear nothing when I'm with you."</p><p>He opened his mouth and swallowed it down.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>"My lord, you've been absent."</p><p>"Am I beholden to your whims?" Tom asked, voice cool. He scowled. "I've been busy with greater things."</p><p>Rosier didn’t need to ask.</p><p>"Does he still have no wings, my lord?" Rosier asked as he bowed his head. His face was carefully blank, but the flick of his tail behind him betrayed his curiosity.</p><p>"No," he said, unable to hide his satisfaction. That, at least, was true. His hand flexed over the armrest of his throne, and he tightened his grip on it, tipping his head up.</p><p>"His halo?"</p><p>Tom’s lip curled in disgust. Yes, Harry still had his halo. Golden and pure still, filled with Grace despite Tom’s greater efforts. "We have time still, Rosier. Don’t question me.”</p><p>Tom wasn't patient, nor was Tom kind. But Harry was the beginning and the end of everything, and for that, Tom could wait.</p><p align="center">*</p><p>"What are you doing?" Harry asked, and his voice was thick with the sleep that clung stubbornly onto him. The fingers that had been tracing over his shoulder blades paused, just for a moment, before they continued. Soft and sweet and gentle, enough to make Harry’s eyes droop once more. An easy glide up and down, seeking almost, searching for something, Harry didn’t know what. His back felt hot, like there was something prickling beneath it, aching to be set free.</p><p>"Just admiring how lovely you are, angel," Tom murmured.</p><p>Harry hummed. He basked in the warmth of Tom behind him, and the scrape of Tom’s nails down his back. It was everything he wanted, everything he needed.</p><p>He turned, slow and clumsy, and buried his nose into Tom’s neck. Tom held onto him, his grip tight, and Harry felt overwhelmingly safe and full of need. As the deer panteth for the water, so did Harry long after for Tom.</p><p>Even pressed up this close, it wasn’t enough. He wanted to be nearer. He wanted everything in them, spirit and soul, to have nothing in between them.</p><p>"Do you think that God brought us together?" Harry found himself asking, breaking the peace of the night.</p><p>Tom didn’t stiffen, didn’t pause in his gentle strokes up and down of Harry’s back, but Harry felt the change in atmosphere. It was heavy now, imposing, and Harry held his breath, his heart stuttering in his chest.</p><p>He felt awake now, all vestiges of sleep driven away from him.</p><p>"It could only be with the help of something supernatural for me to meet someone like you," Tom said, carefully controlled. "But divine intervention? No."</p><p>"What, then?" Harry teased, laughing off the tenseness he could feel. The tenseness he couldn’t understand. "A deal with the devil?"</p><p>Tom’s eyebrows flew up, a ghost of a smile on his lips. He seemed amused, as if in on a private joke that Harry wasn’t part of.</p><p>"Would you like to make one?" he asked, and Harry laughed again.</p><p>"You know I don’t believe in those things." Harry grinned at Tom to take off the edge, and Tom hummed, the curve of his lips lazy and still painted with humor.</p><p>"What do you believe in, then?"</p><p>Harry felt his cheeks flush, warmth filling him, and he reached up to cup Tom’s cheek. Tom leaned into his touch, his eyelids going half-mast.</p><p>"You," Harry said, and it came out rushed and heavy. It felt like a confession, it felt like Harry needed to be on his knees. "I believe in you."</p><p>Tom stared at him. He wasn’t breathing. His eyes had never been this dark, and Harry felt lost in them.</p><p>"I love you," Harry continued honestly, and Tom inhaled, sharp. Harry had never said it before, but oh, he had felt it long before this moment. He held no regrets, no qualms about telling Tom now. "I love you so much, Tom."</p><p>Tom reached up, his hand covering Harry’s that was on his cheek. He pressed a kiss to Harry’s palm, smiling, and another to Harry’s ring finger.</p><p>"I’m everything you need," Tom stated, and Harry huffed, amused despite the arrogance, loving him for it. Tom let go of his hand to cup Harry’s face, his fingers sliding through Harry’s messy hair, worse now from the night in bed. He was looking at something above Harry’s head, gaze thoughtful.</p><p>Harry let him. Everything that he was in the hands of his lover, leaving everything to him and trusting that Tom would make something beautiful out of him.</p><p>"I love you, too,” Tom said.</p><p>And all was good.</p></div>
