    <p>I watch out the window of the compartment at the stunning youngest child of the Weasley's Ginny. She is so beutiful, fiery and challenging. I would love to have her all to myself. Oh but not just get no. I want her and Luna Lovegood. As this is my eighth year I might actually stand a chance. All I have to do is be nice to everyone especially when they are near and say sorry to them. </p><p>"Earth to Pansy Parkinson. Is it alright if me and Luna sit in here with you Everywhere else is full." I hear a soft voice behind me. I look back at the platform, or where it was cause we had begun to move.  Slowly, I turn to face the two girls of my dreams and nod shyly. Ok, old plan is out the window. This is gonna be a long year. </p><p>I try to look at the girls when they are not looking. As I look out the window at the clouds and fields going by i strangely begin to feel fingers walking up my thigh and up my arm whilst a foot is rubbing up the inside of my leg. Tentatively i look at the two girls and notice that Luna is now right in front of me and Ginny is sitting right next to me. "Uh, w...what are you two doing?" I ask them trying to mask my hope. "Look here's the thing we want you and with you glancing at us every ten seconds and the list in your eyes is anything to go by then that means you want us to." Ginny answers me happily. </p><p>That is when I realise that their eyes have darkened with lust. Then I feel nimble fingers playing with my robes, struggling to get them off. So I decide to help them out and take off my robes and slowly unbutton my school shirt after taking off my jumper. I snap my fingers and all curtains close and lights come on instead. That is when I can not take it anymore and kiss Ginny on the lips. It is a bit messy at first but it slowly gets better, her lips taste of strawberries and cream. I lick her bottom lip silently asking for permission to enter and to my delight she opens her mouth for my tongue to dance with hers.</p><p>I can feel Luna tugging off my skirt and Ginny's clothes as well. Then me and Ginny have to come up for air, sadly. After a couple of punctual of air Luna drags me in for a kiss. It isn't messy at all unlike with Ginny, no it is tongue straight away. She also tastes different from Ginny instead she tastes of rhubarb and custard. </p><p>I try to unclip her bra but she stood me and ends the kiss. I whimper at the lips of her lips on mine. "Before we go any further, we need to know if this is one time or if you wanna be girlfriends?" Luna asks me.<br/>
"I want to be girlfriends if it is alright with both of you and I think we should take it slow." I reply calmly , luckily both girls now and kiss me one at a time quickly then eachother. Then all I can think is I am the luckiest girl in the world.</p>
