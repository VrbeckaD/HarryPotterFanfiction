</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Severus massaged his temple and scowled at the letter he’d tossed angrily onto the table. Goblins. He’d survived a war, against all the odds, but now there was a price to be paid. He’d always known there would be, though he’d expected something more along the lines of Azkaban or his life. Not gold for the goblins because he’d been an idiotic teenager and sworn his life to an insane Dark Lord.</p><p> </p><p>They had negotiated a new peace accord with the Ministry, citing the slaughter of their people at the bank a violation of the treaties. So, they had been given license to seek reparations from all the followers of the Dark Lord, and the members of the Order that had caused so much destruction in their attempt to ‘liberate’ a horcrux. They had cut him a break, because of his personal service during the diamond plague six years ago, but he still owed them a small fortune. What rankled more was that there was a rather large fortune he could pay it with, if only he had access to it.</p><p> </p><p>‘Bet you’re laughing now, old man,’ he thought darkly. His bastard of a grandfather had died nearly a decade ago, and left everything to him. Taking pity on his dirt-poor, half-blood grandson. There had been only one condition on the inheritance. He had to marry a witch. If he married a muggle the money would then pass to the Ministry, a charitable donation to be directed to the Hogwart’s fund for underprivileged students. Refusing to have his future controlled by anyone, least of all the man that had disowned his mother and left her destitute and dependant on the abusive bastard she’d married, he’d simply refused to marry at all. It wasn’t like he was the sort of wizard that witches would fall all over themselves to marry, and the idea of bending to old Tiberius Prince’s demands made him want to spit.</p><p> </p><p>But now, it didn’t seem like there was any other choice. They wanted nearly two hundred thousand galleons, and he had sixty days to find some way to acquire it. His home in Cokeworth had been burned to the ground, by someone expressing their displeasure at his acquittal no doubt. The small plot of land was basically worthless anyway, and paying a barrister to defend him at his trial had eaten through all of his savings. He could sell the patents to his potions, but even that wouldn’t bring him half the sum he needed. No. There was simply no other choice than to find a witch that would be willing to marry him.</p><p> </p><p>The door to the Library opened and he looked up. Hermione Granger entered and sat down across from him. Her face was ashen and she looked, utterly defeated. He saw a similar letter in her hand and sighed. Like him, she had taken Potter up on the offer to live here at Grimmauld Place until they got themselves on their feet. Potter had finally gotten the deed to his parent’s old cottage in Surrey, and was living there now. Kreacher saw to their needs, and mostly they just avoided one another. He imagined he made her uncomfortable, and the feeling was assuredly mutual. He didn’t like owing his life to the young witch, and her eyes were always brimming with unasked questions.</p><p> </p><p>“How much are they demanding from you?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Half a million galleons.” She shook her head. “I can’t pay them.” She closed her eyes for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t Potter…” he trailed off.</p><p> </p><p>“They already seized the funds for his share from his vault. He…doesn’t have much left.” She shook his head. “He offered to try and sell some property, but I can’t ask him to do that. Besides, breaking into the bank and escaping on that dragon, it was all my idea. So this is my fault.”</p><p> </p><p>“I imagine Weasley’s brother is helping him?” He surmised.</p><p> </p><p>“Bill’s worked out an agreement for Ron. He’ll be working off his debt with the Goblins. Given what they’re setting him to do, it might well kill him, but because of Bill they’re willing to make arrangements.” She shook her head. “Bill tried to offer the same for me, but they refused. They know it was my plan. I have to pay, in either gold…or blood.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus was quiet for a long time as he looked at her. For a debt of that size, they would kill her and bleed every drop of her blood into the ancient protections on the bank. Goblins hated thieves with a passion, and she had led the first successful theft from the Bank since its founding. Their anger was unlikely to be soothed.</p><p> </p><p>“There is a solution…” he said. The life debt tugged at him, knowing that he could save her at the same time as saving himself. The Goblins likely would have accepted an arrangement from him, potions in payment over time, but they would of course prefer gold. They always preferred gold.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>“About ten years ago, my grandfather died and left me a sizable bequest. Even combined, our respective debts wouldn’t put too large a dent in the funds. I haven’t been able to access the money because there is a condition on the inheritance,” Severus said.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione looked over at him and he saw understanding bloom in her dark brown eyes. “You had to get married.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, with traditional magical bonds to a witch. If I married a muggle, I would forfeit the inheritance,” he said. “I know that it’s not an ideal solution, but if we got married, both our debts could be settled without much trouble. As badly as they might want you dead, they always keep their word. If they said your debt will be satisfied with gold, it will be,” Severus said.</p><p> </p><p>“You’d really marry me? Just to clear a debt?” Hermione looked dubious.</p><p> </p><p>“You saved my life, at great risk to your own and before you knew the truth. When you chose to send Potter and Weasley back to the castle and stayed to try and heal me…you didn’t know I was anything more than a traitor and a murderer. Marrying you is a small price to repay that,” Severus said quietly. He’d never understood why she’d stayed there, with the very real risk that Voldemort or another Death Eater could have come back to confirm that he was indeed dead.</p><p> </p><p>“I never really believed it. Well that first night I did, but once I’d had time to really think…it never made any sense.” She sighed. “But trying to convince Harry or Ron that you weren’t evil was pointless. They’d never have listened, so I kept it to myself. When I saw you there bleeding to death…I couldn’t just leave.” Hermione looked over at him.</p><p> </p><p>“Given our respective talents and personalities, I imagine we can find a way to co-exist fairly effectively. There is the requirement of the wedding night, but beyond that…I wouldn’t expect anything more,” Severus said. With traditional bonds, they wouldn’t be able to seek their pleasure elsewhere, but he was hardly going to require the young woman to share his bed. He imagined she found the idea repellant and he could hardly blame her.</p><p> </p><p>“It just seems…empty,” Hermione said quietly. “Shouldn’t marriage be about love?” She gestured a little helplessly.</p><p> </p><p>“Some are, but arranged marriages are still quite common in our world. Those arrangements have very little to do with love. It’s about combining and protecting wealth or influence, and creating beneficial alliances. Affections can grow over time, but it’s not required that it begin that way,” Severus said, trying to help her wrap her mind around it. “We have time and you should give it careful consideration. Traditional Bonds are for life, they can’t be broken. We would be stuck with one another.”</p><p> </p><p>“You just finally earned your freedom. Why would you give it up so easily?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I served two very powerful and equally cruel masters in my life. I served both of them reluctantly, and really without much of a choice. This is my choice, and I don’t believe you would take delight in petty cruelties,” he said gently. No, he didn’t fear that the girl who had once campaigned for the fair treatment of House Elves, would spend her days ripping at old wounds for her own pleasure. “I’m not a nice man and I won’t be easy to live with…but I will try to treat you with the respect you deserve.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll need a little time to think about it,” Hermione said after a long moment of looking into his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“We have time, but I would ask for your answer by the end of the week. If it is no, I will need to find someone else. Loathe as I am to consider that.” He repressed a shudder. He could imagine finding a way to live with the intelligent witch, and the prospect of having to search for some random woman in her place was…uncomfortable.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll have an answer for you by Friday,” she promised and stood. “I’ll see you at dinner, Severus.”</p><p> </p><p>“Until later, Hermione.” He made himself use her first name in return. It was the first time she hadn’t called him Professor, and he hoped that was a positive sign. Now that the possibility was in front of him, he very much wanted her to say yes.</p>
