<p></p><div class="pi-data-value pi-font"><hr/><p align="justify">The day of Diane Potter's 3rd birthday, she could tell her parents were skittish. They didn't do much to celebrate, but she was okay with that. She was only 3, after all. Her uncle Sirius visited for a short time before riding off on his flying bike. When she asked when she could ride it, he told her he'd soon be giving it to Hagrid, a staff member at Hogwarts. Diane was playing with her little brother when there was a knock at the door. Her mummy had jumped then started shaking. Her Daddy went to go downstairs and the three upstairs heard a fight breaking out. Diane's mummy picked up her brother and, with him on her hip, slammed the door shut. She put him in his crib, pulling Diane on her lap, whispering, "Oh, my babies. You are so loved. So loved. Harry, Diane, mummy loves you. Daddy loves you." </p><p align="justify">Diane couldn't tell why, but she felt the weight of the words as though they could crush her. Perhaps they could. </p><p align="justify">The door flung open and Lily's shaking intensified. She whispered. "My babies, be safe. Be strong." She kissed Diane's forehead. "Be brave, my darling. Protect your brother." </p><p align="justify">With silent tears streaming down her face, Diane nodded. </p><p align="justify">A pale and scary man walked in the room and pointed his wand at the three of them. "Step aside," he hissed at Lily. </p><p align="justify">The redhead stood, turning to the serpent-like man. "Please don't hurt my babies!" Lily begged. </p><p align="justify">"Step aside and you shall be spared." </p><p align="justify">"No!" Lily snapped, her voice full of defiance. "You can't have them. You can never have them!" </p><p align="justify">The man raised his wand above his head, pointing at the babies' mummy. "<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!" he yelled. </p><p align="justify">Diane's mummy fell to the ground. The girl stood, wiping her tears. "Go away," she ordered, her high pitched voice surprisingly strong for a girl who just watched her mother be murdered. </p><p align="justify">The snake-man laughed. "I imagine you'll be powerful when you grow up. Shame we'll never see just how powerful." He went to point his wand at her, but hesitated, thinking on her power being used for his side. He swept his wand sideways and she was shoved out of the way. He pointed at Harry. "<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!" he yelled. </p><p align="justify">At the same time, Diane screamed, "No!" Her terror was showed by the screech in her voice. She managed to run forward, grabbing at the green light. Like smoke, some slipped around her hand, but she managed to shove the spell back to sender.</p><p align="justify">The man crumpled down, his cloak billowing in on itself. He was left as a pile of ash. </p><p align="justify">Harry was crying. </p><p align="justify">Diane looked to him to see a cut on his forehead. She frowned and walked over to him. Grabbing the bars of the crib, she hissed, pulling back. She looked at her hands to see them burnt raw. She stood in front of her brother, shushing comfortingly. She just sat there, not sure what to do. </p><p align="justify">Goodness knew how long later, a man walked in. He fell sideways against the wall as he spotted Lily. A gasp fell from his lips. His body slumped to the ground before he crawled to her, cradling her limp body. He rocked back and forth, sobbing. </p><p align="justify">"Who're you?" Diane asked innocently. </p><p align="justify">The man looked up at her, took one look in her eyes, and sighed raggedly. "I knew your mother when she was a child, a student." He looked down at those once expressive green eyes, now flat and empty. </p><p align="justify">Diane crawled over beside him. "You love her, don't you?" she asked. "The same way my daddy does." </p><p align="justify">He looked down at her in awe of a child's perceptiveness. He nodded jerkily. </p><p align="justify">"I've seen in cinemas... You close a person's eyes when they've fallen."</p><p align="justify">"She's dead, I'm afraid," he corrected softly. </p><p align="justify">Diane flinched - barely perceivably, but he was well trained at noticing these things - and her form slumped a bit. But she forced it to straighten once more, looking back up into his eyes. "Do you want to, or shall I?" she asked. </p><p align="justify">He nodded for her to do it. He caught sight of burns on her hands. He watched her go into the hall to close her father's eyes as well. Ignoring the extensive vocabulary for a 3-year-old, he sobbed silently. He had only a few minutes before the dreadful sound of Black's flying motorbike revved into his hearing. He turned to the girl who had sat in front of him once more. "I shall see you within a decade." Lowering his love gently, he stood, turned, and Apparated away.</p><p align="justify">With no one who would remember her weakness around, Diane bent over her mother and sobbed her heart out. She gripped at her mother's shoulders tightly and she felt her nails digging into the shoulders which would never again bleed. A large man entered the room, but Diane paid him no mind. She didn't even notice or she might've ceased her crying. </p></div></div>
