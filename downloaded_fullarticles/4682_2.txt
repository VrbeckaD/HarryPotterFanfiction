  <span>Pov Draco</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was always Potter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It would always be the chosen one, the one of three, the one with the messy brown curls and ridiculously intriguing eyes. I was staring at him once again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, he passes me a note from under the table. I grab it and see my name on it. I'll wait with opening it, I'll get caught. You see, the war is over and Potter and I both returned for our last year, but I've been having trouble sleeping. I had my own room, sort of. I spelled it so that we don't see our hear each other. We? Yeah, my only two friends, stupid friends, and I.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I open the note after my last lesson and read it carefully while sitting on my bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I'll be coming over around midnight, keep it a secret.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>-Potter</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>My heart somewhat jumps. Alone, with Potter? No way. Why? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hours pass and we have dinner. Potter doesn't even look at me, but I look at him constantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The time goes by slowly and my nerves keep me up tight. How will he even get here? The door is on my side of the room and I open it slightly before midnight. It's the only thing they can hear. It opens a bit further before closing and I stare at the happening. Potter takes of his invisibility cloak -it still looks like a cape to me- and looks at me awkwardly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can talk, the other two won't hear you,” I say and he quickly sits down on my bed. “What did you want to talk about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can you sleep?” He asks and I furrow my brows at him. I nod slowly and he turns his head away. “I can't sleep. I keep dreaming about people dying, especially you but you're alive and I need your help,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You need my help, Potter?” I'm slightly taken back by his words and I move closer to him. He sighs loudly before looking at me again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, can you, how do I say this. Can you help me realize you're still alive?” He asks and my eyes widen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How?” I ask and he shrugs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Anything, you can literally try anything,” he looks away and I instinctively grab his hand. His eyes flicker towards mine and then to my lips, and back to my eyes. “Kiss me,” he says and I won't let him tell me that twice. I move in and press my lips against his, although we don't go any further.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I pull away and he looks at me again. He moves slightly to face me before grabbing my neck and pulling me towards him. I place my hands on his waist while I sit down on his lap and we kiss again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This time, we move, and it's way more heated than anything I could've ever imagined.  He pushes me down on the bed and straddles me while continuing to kiss me.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Potter, wait,” I manage to get out as he puts his hands under my shirt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What's it?” He asks. His eyes show me that he cares and I prep myself up on my elbows. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you like me?” I ask and he looks away while biting his lip. “Potter?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought it was obvious, Malfoy,” he whispers and I pull his chin towards me. He gulps but his eyes meet mine after a moment of hesitation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good, because I've liked you since fourth year, and I want this to be mutual,” I say before pulling him down for another kiss. My mind is racing and my heart is beating fast. I don't know how I was able to make clear sentences just a second ago, my mind doesn't seem to know how to think. “Please,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He starts placing kisses down my neck and I moan softly. I can feel him smirk and he starts sucking. I dug my nails into his back while pushing him closer and he grinds right into my groin. “Oh my God Potter,” I moan out and he moves away with a plop. He puts his forehead against mine and places a few kisses on my lips before just staring at me.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“God you're still handsome,” he mutters after a while and I feel myself blush like crazy. “Do you want to be mine?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about Ginny?” I ask and he chuckles softly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Never had a thing for her anyway,” he says and I feel my face light up. “So, what do you say? Do you want to be mine, Malfoy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please.”</span>
