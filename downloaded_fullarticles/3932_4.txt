    <p>The Weasely family was on there way, raiding another suspected location of you know who. On the list of things being that they also were in need of finding a new location to live in, as the Death Eaters had discovered Grimmauld place.</p><p>Being as such, the black sheep of the family had to go with them much to the others discomfort. Seraphina Weasley, was somehow the twin of one Ronald Weasley. She looked nothing like the rest of her family of carrot tops, but instead with long deep brown hair brown eyes, pale skin, and the hint of freckles around her nose.</p><p>You've never heard of her, you weren't supposed to. There are eight Weasley children, people simply don't notice all of them unless they do something big. All of them had, except for little Fina. The biggest thing she had done that the world had taken notice to was being sorted into Slytherin house when she was eleven. Her family stopped paying her attention and started pretending she didn't exist.</p><p>That's not to say she didn't have any other accomplishments that would have been noticeable if she had actually told anyone. She was the top student in her class, being above Draco Malfoy and Hermione who were directly below her. No one knew and simply assumed Hermione was the top of her class, when in reality Seraphina was. She simply did all her homework and studied, not having many close friends all together. The only people that noticed were Severus Snape who wanted her to stop being so humble about it, Remus Lupin who pretended it wasn't so, and Dumbledore who respected Seraphina's request to stay out of the limelight.</p><p>Aside from that, she had gotten her GED and associates online in the muggle world, mastered five languages and was learning two, and knew a bit of hand to hand combat.</p><p>Her family was unaware of all of these things. All her siblings and there friends were prideful, and let everyone know of there successes. Slytherin all knew about it, but unlike the other houses were good at keeping secrets. Which also meant that all of the elite families knew and approved of her.</p><p>Most of all though, the fact that no one knew was that on her skin on the top of her right shoulder hidden from the world, was a heart made out of snakes. It had appeared when she was twelve, when she started her mensuration cycle.</p><p>Which seeing as it was in second year, her parents and family wouldn't have cared. So she went to the library for hours and hours looking for something, anything, to let her know what was on her arm. No one noticed though, it was the same year as the chamber of secrets. Who would have seen the fear.</p><p>Then in her fourth year, finally she found what it was. They had moved to Grimmauld palace, and they had given her a room to herself. No one wanted snake ears to hear what was going on.</p><p>In the room though, below the floorboards, was an old worn out book. It was in Russian, which Seraphina had recently finished taking the last college class for. In it, it talked of all the most rare raritys in the world. Then one single chapter was dedicated to the world of soulmates, and the soul marks thereof.</p><p>She had been shocked. Fina had no one, literally no one who truly gave a damn about her anymore. Yet, this book was saying that somewhere in the universe someone was destined to be with her. Made to be with her, the perfect companion. As it looked not only companion, but whatever the person in question was in need of. A parent, a sibling, a friend, a teacher, and even a lover a lot of the time.</p><p>That was all it had said but it was enough. So during fifth year before all the exciting things happened, she took the library by storm reading anything and everything on the subject. There was hardly anything at all, including the fact that all of it was outside of the restricted section.</p><p>That was a year ago, and now where did the sixteen year old girl find herself. Sitting on a park bench doing some schoolwork. Why, because her family was forced to bring her with them yet desperately didn't want too. It was November, and to be fully honest freezing. She hadn't expected to be out here when she got dressed this morning. Fina sighed looking at her watch on the fingers she could no longer feel anymore.</p><p>They had left her four hours ago, with the excuse of going out to get something to eat. She scoffed, then they'd come back remember the excuse and apologize saying that they had forgotten her.</p><p>She knew they weren't eating anything, but she always believed about the part of being forgotten. So the Slytherin sat, cringing still at the fact that it was midnight. Deciding that it was late enough now that her family had probably found a place to sleep she figured she should too.</p><p>She curled up on the bench that she could call her own. All 4'9 1/2 fitting smugly on it, shuddering at the cold win that was blowing, and did her Bosnia homework before falling asleep.</p><p>Because of the cold she didn't sleep very deeply at all. An unknown amount of time later a specific pop was made, waking her up immediately.</p><p>Seraphina snapped up like a twig, and quickly ran to the bit of pavement behind the bushes. More pops rang out, and slowly she saw people apparating to where she was. A closer look and she had to hold herself back. It was death eaters, she recognized them all as so. Now you can be sure she wasn't at all affiliated with the wizarding KKK, but she knew there children. And she knew what they were capable of.</p><p>She may be smart, but Seraphina was only sixteen and couldn't legally perform any magic. Her options were low, but she had them. The best one was to just run away, acquire a fake ID, and go on with her own life because this wasn't a fight she could possibly win. Most of her body was either asleep, too cold to feel, or both. As quietly as possible she rubbed her hands together and tried shaking out her legs.</p><p>Running would be of no use when she couldn't feel her legs. Hating her family for leaving her alone, she looked at her watch again. Holy shit, it was 2 am. They had honestly left her alone on a park bench for six hours, which was a new record. Deciding to just wait it out for a few minutes, she watched as they all gathered and went in a specific direction, opposite of where she was.</p><p>It was unexpected and unlikely which she ignored because of how extremely exhausted she suddenly was. Not to mention how cold.</p><p>Wringing her hands one last time, she was about to leave her spot and run, there was one last pop.</p><p>Directly behind her.</p><p>Her whole body tensed up, trying so hard not to make any noise. Fina had done a good job at being Switzerland all these years. Why would anyone come after her.</p><p>The leaves crunched behind her, the other person surprised.</p><p>"My, my" the male voice drawled on.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>That wasn't the voice of anyone she recognized.</p><p>"What do we have here."</p><p>That voice was silky, dark, and I knew who it was.</p><p>The weirdest thing started happening, and none of it out of fear. My right shoulder, where the mark was, starting a slight burning sensation. My hands got all clammy, my mouth suddenly dry.</p><p>No way.</p><p>My heart beat was thumbing loudly in my ear, as I heard the other put up his wand. I suddenly unable to move much, not because of cold or fear though.</p><p>If what I had read was correct, this meant I was meeting them. One in the universe. All meant for me. Lord wicked Voldemort.</p><p>"Petrificus Totalus" His voice said, and I went down without a hint of a fight. Soft hands caught me before I hit the floor, and cradled me to the man I had been raised to fear. He caressed my hair softly, treating me like expensive antique china.</p><p>I had never felt more fear in my life in that one moment. I didn't show it but he'd know how I feel. Just like I could feel how purely excited he was.</p><p>"Sssh," he hushed me, "there's no need to fear, I won't harm you."</p><p>Gently he went over and ripped my shirt at the right shoulder, revealing the heart made out of snakes. Voldemort gasped as he saw it, rubbing against it softly.</p><p>He ran the back of his hand on my face.</p><p>"I have been waiting for you for so long, my Angel."</p><p>I finally opened my eyes looking up at him. His eyes were dazed as he looked at mine. Grey eyes were suddenly beautiful, smiling in happiness that probably wasn't seen there often. I felt safe, awkward as it is, for the first time since I was eleven I felt okay. Then suddenly his eyes went back to normal, looking surprised, angry, shocked, and something that could only be described as fondness.</p><p>"You're cold." he dead panned seriously, looking me up and down. He put his hand up to my face again</p><p>"Darling, you're freezing."</p><p>Surprisingly he looked genuinely concerned. Only thing was is in that one moment, I remembered who I was and whose arms I was in and I started getting scared again. Oh my god.</p><p>This was voldemort, man who raged war, killed Sirius, burned down my childhood home, and wouldn't leave my family alone. Fear turned into panic very quickly, and of course as soulmates voldemort felt it come as well.</p><p>His eyes widened, seemingly not knowing what to do.</p><p>"Love, it's alright I'll fix this. that damn family of yours left you out here to freeze."</p><p>Then he kissed my forehead and within seconds I was in a deep sleep</p>
