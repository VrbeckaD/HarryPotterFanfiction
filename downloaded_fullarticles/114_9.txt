<p>She arrived the minute the first punch hit the shady Russian brother. Neither man noticed her as she watched the mysterious Mr. Fisk batter the foreign criminal black and bloody. However, once the larger man started dragging the near unconscious Anatoly towards the open car door, she felt she should step in.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Fisk. But that’s my Russian you’re beating.”</p>
<p>Wilson Fisk froze with his hand on the car door for two reasons. One; he neither recognised the voice of the woman behind him nor realised that there was even someone else in the vicinity other than the Russian, Wesley and himself. And two; a force was stopping him from moving anything but his eyes, which quickly darted to Wesley, still seated in the limo. Whatever it was that had frozen him; be it instinct, fear or a supernatural force, it didn’t seem to be affecting Wesley, who was slipping out of the car to observe their new companion.</p>
<p>“Ah, Mr. Wesley,” the young woman purred with an English lilt; “Be a dear and pull that body away from the car, would you? What your employer has planned will ruin not only the interior, but my evening as well.”</p>
<p>Wesley couldn’t really see the woman, standing back and in the shadows as she was, but Wilson wasn’t moving and it really would have been inconvenient if his friend and employer had followed through to where they all, apparently, knew it would. Moving closer to the battered body, Wesley glanced at Wilson to be sure that he was doing the right thing. A movement of the other man’s eyes had him quickening his pace in moving the Ranskahov brother. No sooner had he been moved from the car door than Wilson felt his ability to move return to him; slowly and as though he were moving through mud, but returning to him all the same. He turned to look into the darkness with Wesley, as the woman revealed herself from it.</p>
<p>“Young miss, may we inquire about your name?” Wesley asked charmingly, his gaze noting her small stature, crimson hair, blood red eyes and near translucent skin.</p>
<p>“No, you may not,” was the abrupt reply. “But if you must be polite, you may call me Ms. Black for now.”</p>
<p>“Black?” he confirmed uncertain, thinking red would be a much more appropriate colour.</p>
<p>“As my current thoughts, coincidently.”</p>
<p>Wesley shuffled slightly, unnerved by the sharp smile of pearly white teeth that accompanied the confirmation. His pause allowed Wilson to step in, being much more experienced in ignoring his unsettled nerves.</p>
<p>“Ms. Black, this man and his business with us should be none of your concern, as I am his employer and thus am responsible for the consequences of his failure,” Wilson explained in a gruff but even tone, hoping to buy Wesley and himself time so they could deal with her before she became more of a liability than she was.</p>
<p>“You see Mr. Fisk, that’s where you’re wrong,” the woman countered, “while I have no connection to the criminal organisation he runs with his brother for you, oh don’t look so shocked Mr. Wesley, he is one of my people. Both he and his brother have offended me greatly on a personal level, which I personally think trumps his failure as a criminal layman to you. Ignoring that however, I am offering to deal with him for you.”</p>
<p>The men stared at her dumbly for a moment before their expressions shifted into suspicion. Ms. Black rolled her eyes, looking younger and more put out than the males had previously given her credit for;</p>
<p>“Mr. Fisk, you are a hard man to find and an even harder man to get information on. I’m sure there is a reason for that. It’s probably the same reason you don’t run these organisations yourself, rather the people who currently do. I’m willing to bet it’s also a reason you don’t let yourself get your hands dirty with the small fry like you were about to before I stepped in. Letting me deal with this means the Ranskahov brothers disappear, you keep your hands clean, Mr. Wesley doesn’t get extra work and I walk away satisfied.”</p>
<p>“And what do you want from this?” Wesley asked, all previous charm from his voice gone in favour of protecting his friend the best he could by getting to what he saw as the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>The blood eyed woman tilted her head with a curious quirk of her lips;</p>
<p>“You seem to have misheard me, Mr. Wesley, which is not something I thought possible but I shall reiterate for your benefit. The brothers have offended me greatly on a personal level and I want nothing but the satisfaction of dealing with them personally. There will be no loss on your part. It will cost you nothing because I am willing to do this for free.”</p>
<p>Wilson blinked in surprise, but Wesley wasn’t convinced; “A generous offer, but it’s not enough.”</p>
<p>Red eyes narrowed; “You want more? What more could possibly want? My credentials? A reference? No, I will give you no more than proof that they are gone.”</p>
<p>This time Wesley narrowed his eyes; “You would return with proof they have been dealt with?”</p>
<p>The redhead sighed in frustration, her accent becoming mixed with a thicker language; “Of course, I would. I’m only selfish up to a point. I want to be the one to kill them but I’m very willing to share the satisfaction for their demise with you.”</p>
<p>Wilson’s head tipped curiously and Wesley asked; “And if we wanted to get in touch with you aga-?”</p>
<p>“You don’t,” she cut him off, “I’ll find you in a private setting with a beer and whatever concrete proof I decide to show you, a week from now. As I said, I’ll give you no more than proof they’re gone. Not even a way to contact me.”</p>
<p>“What if we were to desire your services-?”</p>
<p>“You won’t, because this isn’t a service or a business and I work for no one; particularly not those who can’t be trusted.”</p>
<p>A groan stopped any argument Wesley would’ve come up with, as the woman’s focus centred purely on the bloody Anatoly with a malicious smile. She moved to stand above his head so that when he eventually fought his way to consciousness, her bloodthirsty grin was the first thing he saw. He gasped in fear and backpedalled away from her and the other two men with a hushed; “Tryapichnaya kukla<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.”</p>
<p>“Oh Annie, my little krolik<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, it’s so nice to see that you remember me!”</p>
<p>Anatoly struggled to his feet, ignoring his broken nose and aching face but cradling his ribs to the best of his abilities. He glanced between the three people standing in front of him uncertainly and much to Wilson and Wesley’s consternation, he seemed far more nervous of the tiny woman in front of him rather than the two of them, despite what had happened not even ten minutes previously. Anatoly gulped; “I’m sorry. We’re-“</p>
<p>“No, you’re not,” Ms. Black smiled sweetly. “But you will be. Now, I’m giving you a head start, so I would get walking if I were you.”</p>
<p>He spent three seconds gazing at her expression before he turned swiftly and shuffled off as fast as he possibly could. The remaining three people watched him go.</p>
<p>“Are you sure it’s wise to let him go off like that?” Wilson asked in monotone, curious and slightly dubious of the woman’s actions.</p>
<p>“Well Mr. Fisk, you certainly did a number on him, so if I get lost, I’ll just follow the bloody breadcrumbs he leaves behind. Besides, even if he wasn’t leaving blood everywhere, I’d still know where to find him. I tracked him to you after all, didn’t I?” she queried rhetorically, with a sly smile and a peripheral glance. Two sharp looks were sent her way as she stretched and continued speaking;</p>
<p>“Well, normally I would give him a longer head start. More fun that way but as I’m not sure I entirely like your company, despite how pretty you both are, I think I’ll get going. Mr. Wesley, I’ll see you in a week’s time. Good evening, Mr. Fisk.”</p>
<p>Then she was gone. Slipping into the shadows like the darkness itself before the remaining pair of men could even comprehend her parting comment. Even when comprehension came to them, they still weren’t sure what to make of it.</p>
