  <strong> <em>Orion Black looks at his family Tapersity and He sees his grandson there. He just gets out of those filthy muggle hands Tom would be so disappointed that his only grandson is there. He looks at the name Apollux Harrison Orion Lestrange - Black. He is almost 13 he goes up to Sirius room and sees him rest when he came to him 15 years ago saying " he was with Rodulphus child." He was shocked but Rolulpus and Sirius both agreed that James would take the child till it was safe to take their child. </em> </strong>

  <u> <em>Dear Lucius Malfoy, </em> </u>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> <u>This letter is about Harry. He needs you to take him in since Sirius can't take him in since he is on the run. Harry needs his Godfather and to be away from Dumbledore he is wanting Harry as a pawn and Rodophus is in Azkaban for a stupid crime Please I will pay you monthly for Harry's wellbeing and protection. </u></em>
</p>

  <em> <u>sincerely, Orion Black from the most ancient house of Black </u> </em>

  <strong> <em>I send the letter with my owl and I head to my room and I look at my only picture of my <a href="https://potterheadonline.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gilderoy-lockhart-and-harry-potter-hogwarts-professors-30368896-500-300.png?w=500" rel="nofollow">grandson</a> and it was with Gildroy Lockhart that scam artist he is the fakest of fake. I hold the picture and I look at his disturbed face that he got pulled into the picture. I put it on the bedside table and I sigh and I get up and I go to the living room and Kreacher brings me a cup of tea and Sirius comes down in one of the new pairs of clothes and he also has a cup of tea and he looks at me and says " I want Harry out of that muggles house at once." I nod but it is hard to get him out those dreadful muggles hands. I know it hurts Sirius to be away from his son and to let Harry only know him as his godfather but I am gonna change that for both of there sakes.  I get up and I head to my study and I grab one of my dark arts book and I read a few chapters and I hope Dumbledore knows what he is doing. </em></strong>
