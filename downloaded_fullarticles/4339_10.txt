          <div class="userstuff"><p>Fred slowly looked around wondering how he had gotten to Zonko’s Joke shop. He was very sure that he had just been fighting in a war and yet suddenly he was here, in Zonko’s. He wandered through the shop for a moment looking around. It was very quiet in here. Perhaps he was dreaming? But then where was George? And why was there nobody else in his dream?</p><p>The jangle of the bell caused him to look up suddenly to see an entirely unexpected face. <br/>“Sirius Black?”<br/>“The same.”<br/>“Where am I?”<br/>“Well, it kinds looks like Zonko’s to me.”<br/>“Yeah, but why am I here? Where is everyone else?”</p><p>Sirius looked at him kindly and sighed.</p><p>“You don’t know?”</p><p>Outside came the loud whistle of the Hogwarts Express. Fred glanced out the window to see the train there waiting.</p><p>“Why’s the train here? Are we going to Hogwarts?”<br/>“No,” replied Sirius quietly. “I believe that I have been sent to come get you. I thought that you’d realize - “</p><p>Sirius trailed off.</p><p>Fred looked around and suddenly felt very frightened.</p><p>“Where’s George?”<br/>“He’s still there.”<br/>“Where?”<br/>“Fighting.”<br/>“Do I have to go?”<br/>“I’m afraid so.”<br/>“Are they going to be alright?”<br/>“The good always are Fred.”<br/>“I have to be there for him. We’ve never been apart.”<br/>“You’ll be with him always.”</p><p>Fred took a deep breath. A tear silently rolled down his cheek as he looked around Zonko’s for the last time.</p><p>“Give ‘em hell Georgie.”</p><p>He followed Sirius out the door of the shop and boarded the train.</p></div>
