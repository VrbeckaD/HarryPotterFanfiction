    <p>It was a cool and windy autumn evening as a one Petunia Dursley stepped out of her London flat clad in a dark wool coat and clutching her purse's strap. She had forgotten to buy eggs, matches and filet mignon for her precious Dudley and his family who were to visit tonight for their usual Thursday family dinners. As she walked swiftly, eyes gazing sharply forward like those of a hawk she swerved from the other passersby on her way to the grocery shop. Suddenly though the wind felt stronger and even more cold, seemingly slapping her face. She felt a strong tug to her heart strings and for an entire second (far too long) she felt as though there was no oxigen in this world. She stopped, grasping for air. It didn't take long for her vision to become blurry and for her to suddenly not see anything at all. In the background she could hear gasps, cars honking and desperate cries and murmurs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When she opened her eyes she was in the emergency room. The strong smell of bleach and disenfectant insulting her senses. She franctically called for a nurse or doctor, someone, anyone. She felt something was entirely wrong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Please telephone my Dudders...” She would murmur in between tears and sobs. She hadn't called him Dudders since he left for university, or was it on the day she finally said her goodbyes to Vernon. Petunia couldn't for the life of her recall. Either way she needed him here, to talk sense into the doctors that she hadn't had a nervous breakdown, that they were about to sit down for dinner, that he was still <em>here</em>. And Abigail his wife and her beloved little Daisy too. The nurse came, eyes with dark circles below them, pale blond hair. Everything about her screamed tired and miserable, she huffed and gave Petunia a trio of pills to swallow, a plastic cup of distasteful water. Petunia spit it all out. She squirmed and screamed and called out for her Dudley. He never came.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Late in the morning, she awoke from fitful sleep and she was sure more tired than she had been before it. A different nurse came in, plump and rosy cheeked, a friendly smile crowned by light freckles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Dursley. Sleep well?” She asked, checking the clipboard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>No!</em> No I did not, thank <em>you</em> very much.” Petunia was dismissive and irritated and wanted desperately to go home.</p>
<p><br/>
“Mrs. Dursley, a one Mr. Temple is here and wishes to see you. Is he a relative?” Petunia's eyes widened. Why on earth would John be here? And then she remembered yesterday's horrible sensation. She'd made a fool of herself in front of everyone in the middle of the street. In public. Petunia was mortified... and above that, not enjoying the strange chain of events not one bit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Let him in.” She finally responded dryly, as another nurse popped in carrying the breakfast tray (Petunia's scrambled eggs were a lot better, she could tell by the smell. And the biscuits and oatmeal too...).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr. John Temple followed the nurse inside the room, eyes glued to the floor which was very, very unlike him. Mr. John Temple was the most annoyingly happy person Petunia had ever the displeasure of knowing. Perhaps, and she would never, ever admit this, because she was the most annoyingly <em>un</em>happy person she had ever known. He stopped at the side of her bed and finally raised his brown eyes to look at her, matted brown hair and blue eyes as sharp as ever and of course <em>that </em>frown. But despite her demeanor, Petunia wasn't at all unattractive and her now seven years of being a widow had done wonders to her complexion as she spent quite a lot of time outside, her skin having a slightly golden glow and she wore red lipstick most days and even jean trousers that fit her nice. Not bad for fifty-nine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Dearest Petunia...” he started, suddenly very much fascinated by the hem of his sweater. He was always so full of words to say and Shakespeare and William Blake quotes and films that he'd seen and untamed horses he'd ridden on. Awfully too little words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Please, just tell me already.” She finally whispered, impatient and resigned because she feared for the worst and the worst was what she was expecting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Our Abigail and our Dudley, have regretfully departed us.” He said all at once, words jumbling together, choking out a sob and then opening a dam of tears, all falling from his eyes. He grabbed her hand and squeezed it, more for his reassurance than hers. She let him even though it made her uncomfortable, no one had held her hand, no one since Vernon. But now... She blinked. She blinked several times before she felt an imaginary dagger to her chest and her heart beat madly. Petunia too choked, but headstrong as she was held her own, refused to make a fool of herself and cry before John and everyone else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do you mean by they departed us?” She managed to say, voice trembling, hands trembling, heart pounding in her chest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>They</em> are no longer, Petunia. Dead is what they now are.” He told her, whiping away the tears, breathing coming back to normal. John was only sadness however, and that was so, so unlike him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“D-<em>dead</em>?” He nodded vigorously, more tears threatening to fall. He squeezed her hand once more and was able to control himself. “And Daisy?” She asked of her granddaughter, just two years old.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Doing fine. At my house, with a nanny, the poor little thing.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The day after the funeral, Daisy moved into Petunia's flat. The grieving grandmother set up her cot, little books and little toys in the small crafting room, her clothing all in the large wooden dresser. Daisy was a sweet little thing, barely cried, always smiling, ate very well, slept through the night... bless her soul. Petunia loved her more than anything, but still, each time she gazed upon her only grandchild, a piece of her heart would break. Big emerald-colored eyes would gaze back at her and all Petunia could see were the beautiful eyes of her late sister, because even in that the late Lily had beaten her to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Petunia Dursley went about her daily chores around her tiny home, caring for Daisy as best as she could and never forgetting to water her potted plants by the kitchen window, one thing reverberated in her mind: once again an emerald eyed baby, an orphan, a little someone for her to rear and nurture. More than that even, what haunted Petunia the most, more so even than the loss of her precious son was the fact that this was it, that this was her last chance, her redemption, the only thing that could perhaps ease the guilt in her heart, towards her sister Lily and towards Harry, Lily's son. Always those emerald eyes to haunt her.</p>
