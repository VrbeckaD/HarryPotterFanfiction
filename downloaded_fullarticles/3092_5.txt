          <div class="userstuff"><p>He didn’t know where to place his arms.</p>
<p>It looked like every inch of his body was damaged.</p>
<p>His skin was hot to the touch and wet with blood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> They heard the voice of a man coming near the stairs. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His partner started whispering spells under his breath.</p>
<p>His dark wand touching lightly against pale skin.</p>
<p>The skin wasn’t healing, but the blood flow was slowing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>He could feel the beast within him awaken.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leaving the healing to his old rival he started for the door.</p>
<p>He could feel a rage building within him,</p>
<p>Each breath it seemed too grow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> The man yelped as he entered the hall with a snarl that wasn't fully human.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The man was overly large.</p>
<p>His face quickly darkened with anger.</p>
<p>His pace quickened up the stairs towards him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> He wasn’t sure what was happening but he didn’t stop it. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He rushed forward, the rage blinding him.</p>
<p>Knocking into him the larger man slammed down the stairs.</p>
<p>Faster than he ever moved before, he was over him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> It felt like he was merging with someone else. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He could feel the wolf awaken behind his eyes.</p>
<p>It was enraged and he fed off it.</p>
<p>He encouraged it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> With something else. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a growl he grabbed the man’s neck and threw him.</p>
<p>His body slammed into the wall missing a window.</p>
<p>The dry wall dented underneath his weight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> He felt more in control then he ever has. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He could feel himself shifting in his clothes.</p>
<p>Not quite a man.</p>
<p>Not quite a wolf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> His opponents eyes were wide with fear and it fueled both of them. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He threw a hand, that was half morphed, out.</p>
<p>His fingertips were clawed at the end.</p>
<p>They sliced through the side of his face with ease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> He wasn’t divided anymore. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The man below him screamed.</p>
<p>To the right of him he could hear the screams of two others.</p>
<p>He ignored them all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> He knew what he was. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He grabbed the man by the throat.</p>
<p>His hand, covered in fur and sharp, dug into his flesh.</p>
<p>He glared down at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> He knew what he had to do. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The voice that came out was deep.</p>
<p>It was feral and terrifying.</p>
<p>“Pathetic.” And the body fell from his grasp.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> He had to protect his friend’s son. </em>
