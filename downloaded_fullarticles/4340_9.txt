    <p>“You know, it’s really more humane to kill them, first.”</p><p>Harry paused to look at Draco, fangs sunk deep into the neck of a squirming, squealing badger.</p><p>“Quieter, too,” Draco added.</p><p>Harry unlatched his fangs, blood pouring from the animal as its life faded. “That takes too long; I was hungry.”</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh, sorry, I forgot snapping a neck takes the excruciatingly long wait of ten seconds. I think I’m going to ask Sirius to kill them before bringing them to us.”</p><p>“No! The blood will get cold!” Harry complained. </p><p>“Then kill them first,” Draco told him. “Seriously, I’m starting to think you might have a bit of a sadistic side,” he teased.</p><p>Harry sneered playfully. “What, the fact that I always drive my fangs much deeper into your neck than necessary didn’t clue you in?” </p><p>The two vampires were sitting in a shed outside Grimmauld Place. They had slipped out to it soon after arriving, as Sirius had mentioned that he left them some “treats” there, to enjoy during the Order meeting that they still were not permitted to attend. Harry and Draco visited the place once or twice weekly, when their respective caretakers-- Mrs. Weasley and Snape-- travelled there for the meetings. Ron always asked to go, too, but would change his mind once Harry reminded him that he would be visiting with Draco whilst there, so unless Ron suddenly had a change of heart and decided he wanted to be friends with the Slytherin boy, it was not recommended.</p><p>The door to the shed opened, causing the pair to freeze.</p><p>“Sirius…?” Harry asked, hoping that it was merely his Godfather and not anyone who didn’t know they were vampires-- or worse, Snape, who highly disproved of their penchant for animal blood.</p><p>“Harry, are the wrackspurts messing with your brain again?” Luna asked, entering the shed. “I am pretty sure I don’t look like the dog-person…”</p><p>“Sirius. His name is Sirius,” Harry told her, for must have been the umpteenth time.</p><p>Luna had found Grimmauld Place entirely of her own accord. To everyone’s utter surprise, she simply walked in one day as people were arriving for an Order meeting. All but Harry and Draco were utterly perplexed, and subsequently began frantically checking the wards and charms upon the house. Dumbledore then arrived and shrugged it off, saying that the spells were all in order-- it was merely Luna being Luna; it seemed even he had learned not to question what the blonde did. After that, she would randomly show up-- sometimes to just say hello and leave, but at other times to actually catch up and spend time with the boys.</p><p>“So, what’s up, Luna?” Draco asked the girl.</p><p>“Harry, you should finish that,” Luna gestured to the bloody badger in Harry’s hands, completely unperturbed. </p><p>“Er, right,” Harry blushed and began draining the animal’s blood once again while Luna watched with a look of pure fascination painted upon her face. She really disturbed him sometimes. </p><p>Luna finally spoke up again. “I found something you might like,” Luna told the boys, holding out a large vial of a murky deep purple potion swirling with silver. “It will let you dream again.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Harry asked, taking it from her.</p><p>“It can make those who don’t sleep, sleep, and have dreams you control. This way, you can go on the White Ship with me. I’ve been getting lonely on the dream voyages, you know. I keep remembering the one we went on together.”</p><p>Draco stared at her. “That sounds great and all, but if you don’t mind me asking, where did you get such a potion? It sounds like the lucid-dreaming draught, although I’ve never heard of it making non-sleeping creatures sleep… also, it’s completely illegal.”</p><p>“Oh, yes, I think that is what they called it. Or, something similar; I don’t recall exactly. I found it,” Luna told him.</p><p>“Right; but where did you find it?”</p><p>“The Plateau of Leng… a goat-man told me what it does. You should use it. I usually go on the journeys once every week or two; you don’t need to go on all, but on occasion it would be nice.”</p><p>“How do we know when to use it?” Harry asked her.</p><p>Luna looked thoughtful. “I suppose if you use it, the White Ship will know, and collect us.”</p><p>“Hold up a second; you want us to use a strange, probably highly illegal, potion that a goat-man told you will put us to sleep?” Draco pressed.</p><p>“Draco… she left,” Harry informed him.</p><p> </p><p>*******</p><p> </p><p>A few days later at The Burrow, Harry found himself hunched over the toilet. Mrs. Weasley had forced him to eat a huge portion of shepherd’s pie; this had not clashed well with his digestive tract. It seemed to be getting more difficult for him to digest any food other than meats and blood; eating human foods had always been mildly unpleasant since becoming a vampire, as it was all as tasteless as stale bread, but never before would it make him nauseous, or cause him to expel it like this, even if he had eaten a lot; Harry wondered if maybe some vampires were simply more sensitive to human food, and if that could develop over time.</p><p>Someone rapidly knocked on the door. “Harry, are you in there?” Hermione. Great, just what he needed. She had arrived the night prior, and would be staying there for a few days; Harry should have known that she’d be watching his eating. </p><p>Harry collected himself, cleaning up with a few spells before exiting the bathroom. “Sorry, guess I was in there a while; you can use it now.”</p><p>“That’s not why I’m here.” She glanced suspiciously into the bathroom. “Are you feeling okay? You seemed a bit queasy after dinner, and ran here straight away…”</p><p>“Queasy?” Harry laughed. “Nah. Just had a lot to drink. It was a lot of food though-- think I’ll go sleep some of it off.” He blinked. She wasn’t there; huh, usually she didn’t let him go that easily. Harry headed to his room-- the one that had formerly been Percy’s. The Weasley home had a lot of empty rooms now, with five of their seven kids having moved out, although some of them did still visit and stay overnight fairly often. Not Percy, though; Harry-- and everyone else-- doubted he’d ever stay overnight here again.</p><p>Hedwig hooted at Harry in greeting as he entered the room.</p><p>“Hey, girl.” Harry ruffled Hedwig’s feathers a little before heading to his trunk, withdrawing from it some owl treats and a blood potion-- his hand grazed across the strange potion Luna had given him, and Harry vaguely thought about using it that night. No, he couldn’t, not without Draco-- he wondered if maybe he’d be allowed to stay overnight at Grimmauld Place with Draco one night. Odds of that were slim though, since Lupin was currently away on Order business and the rest of the adults seemed to think it was a bad idea of leaving them alone with only Sirius. Guess it would have to wait until the school-year began.</p><p>Ten or so minutes later, footsteps were heard, stopping at his door. Harry sniffed, then rolled his eyes and sighed. “Come in, Ron,” Harry called, not looking away from his book.</p><p>“How’d you know I was there?” Ron asked, confused as he entered the room.</p><p>“You weren’t exactly subtle; what, are you wearing lead boots or something?” Harry snapped.</p><p>“Hey!” Ron complained. “I don’t-- argh, nevermind. What’s got you in such a bad mood?”</p><p>Now it was Harry’s turn to be confused. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well, mate, you fled after dinner, and now are in here brooding.”</p><p>“Brooding?” Harry scoffed. “Ron, I’m reading a book. Last I checked, that’s not brooding.”</p><p>“Well, then, what’s with the attitude?”</p><p>Harry closed his eyes. Maybe he had been acting a little moody. “Look, just… I guess I’m a little overwhelmed. I’m sorry if I seem snappish; I don’t mean to be.”</p><p>“Overwhelmed? What would you be overwhelmed about?”</p><p>“I’d imagine,” Hermione said, as she entered the room as well, “that he’s overwhelmed with having so much attention on him. Right, Harry?” Harry responded with a nod.</p><p>“Attention?” Ron blinked. “But Harry, you get attention all the time! The press, classmates, all of that. You get less attention here, if anything.”</p><p>Hermione sighed. “Ron, that’s not the kind of attention I’m talking about; I mean the kind your mom gives him. Coddling, forcing him to eat everything, always checking up on him, and all that.”</p><p>Ron was still confused. “But that’s just normal parenting stuff.”</p><p>“Which I never had,” Harry pointed out, jumping on the excuse Hermione had presented. He was overwhelmed about much more, but it was true that the coddling didn’t help. Mrs. Weasley had been taking her role of official guardian very seriously. “I was lucky to get a slice of bread for dinner some nights, before getting locked in my room and ignored, and when they didn’t ignore me it was not pleasant at all. The kind of attention I get here is still pretty foreign to me.”</p><p>“Right, I forgot…” Ron trailed. “But, wait, you’ve been here before in the summers, yet seemed fine.”</p><p>“A couple of weeks being treated as closer to a guest verses over a month of being treated as an actual son is a lot different, Ron,” Hermione replied.</p><p>“What she said,” Harry confirmed. “Now, can you give me some time alone, please?”</p><p>When his two friends left, Harry leaned back onto the bed, closing his eyes, pondering upon what had just occurred. Had he really been acting that moody lately? Well, the past few days he definitely had been, since he was squandering the few blood potions he had left-- like the idiot he was, Harry had left the new batch Snape had brought him at Grimmauld Place. Plus, even if that weren’t the case, who could blame him for being a little moody, with what had happened just over a month ago… Harry shook his head vigorously. No, he was not going to think about that. Not going to think about how he screwed up so badly, led his friends into danger… not going to think about how he taunted the Old One, causing her to break free… not going to think about the people thrown into her maw, how she still held Tonks in her tentacle when… Harry dove towards his trunk, frantically digging through with shaking hands to find a calming draught. Where was it? Had he run out? Crap, he had run out already. Harry sat back, leaning against the leg of the bed, arms curled around his knees. He took deep breaths, despite not needing them, trying to calm down the shaking, trying to stop thinking about all the death and pain he had caused…</p><p> </p><p>*******</p><p> </p><p>“Harry! Harry, wake up!” Hermione called urgently, banging open his door. “...Harry? Ron, Harry’s gone!”</p><p>Harry, hearing this from outside, dashed back to the house, entering the kitchen as the two descended the stairs. Mrs. Weasley, Ginny, and Fleur-- she and Bill, engaged, had been staying there too this summer-- looked at him surprised as they sat at the table eating breakfast. Mr. Weasley and Bill must have already left for work, Harry surmised.</p><p>“Harry!” Mrs. Weasley stood up, pulling him over to sit at the table. “Why were you outside? You know it’s dangerous to be out alone!” she scolded.</p><p>“Especially when no one knows you were there,” Ginny added. “What were you even doing?”</p><p>“I was, er, just talking a walk,” Harry told then sheepishly. ‘And grabbing a snack,’ he added to himself. He often went out at night, but usually returned well before they had woken; this time, however, his hunt for a snack had taken him much further than intended, and by the time he realized this it had already become too late to get back before being noticed.</p><p>“Well, next time, tell someone, so we can get you an escort and put proper protections in place,” Mrs. Weasley scolded. “You cannot be out alone in these trying times!”</p><p>“Right, I understand. So, er, what did you want, Hermione?” Harry quickly changed the subject, then cringed, realizing no human would have been able to hear her calling from that far. Luckily, she seemed too preoccupied to notice.</p><p>“Right! Harry, look, Ministry letters arrived, one for each of us-- I think they’re our OWL results!” She shoved an official-looking letter into his hand. “Oh, I hope I did okay, I know I messed up in quite a few places, what will happen if I fail everything?” Hermione seemed quite frazzled.</p><p>Harry chuckled. “Hermione, I think you’ll be fine. It’s Ron we have to worry about,” Harry teased.</p><p>“Hey! I’m not that bad!” Ron complained. “Let’s just look at them, alright?” He tore his letter open, with the other two following suit.</p><p>“I can’t look,” Hermione squealed, eyes closed tightly, what looked to Harry like a spiral of orange passing around her, but only briefly.</p><p>“Hermione,” Ron glanced over her shoulder, “you’re fine, trust me.”</p><p>“Oh. Yes, I suppose so,” Hermione blushed, seeing she got a single E amongst all O’s-- the latter were the highest grade possible, the former just below.</p><p>“I didn’t do so bad myself, see?” Ron proclaimed proudly. “I only failed Divination and History, which I had no chance of passing anyway! No O’s, though. How’d you do, Harry? O in defense of course, I assume?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry confirmed, blushing, unsure how to tell him the rest of the grades.</p><p>“Did you get an OWL in Divination?” Hermione asked curiously. “You were doing really well in class this year.”</p><p>Harry laughed at that. “Yeah, well, unfortunately centaur magic isn’t approved Ministry curriculum; I completely bombed that one. Somehow managed to pass History though.”</p><p>“Seriously?” Ron marvelled. “That’s amazing! I bet half the class or more didn’t.”</p><p>Hermione gasped as she looked over Harry’s shoulder. “Harry, that’s more than just ‘managed to pass’!”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Ron grabbed the letter from a red-faced Harry. “Bloody hell, mate! An ‘E’? Seriously? Since when are you that good at History? And, wait a second…” Ron’s eyes widened. “An ‘O’ in everything else?”</p><p>“Not Charms,” Harry pointed out. “That’s an ‘E’, too.” He had expected much worse a grade there, seeing as he had ended up with a large purple rat rather than a small lilac one on the practical, but maybe he had done especially well on the written.</p><p>“That’s still amazing! Blimey, even an ‘O’ in Potions…” Ron shook his head in disbelief as he handed Harry back the letter. </p><p>Hermione smiled, amused. “Ron, are you honestly that surprised? You’ve seen how well Harry’s been doing on his assignments this past year… besides, you did awfully well, too! Look, an ‘E’ in Potions; that’s definitely much better than you thought! Your hard work paid off.” Hermione beamed proudly. “In fact, you also got an ‘E’ in Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology, and Defense-- those are all the ones needed to be an auror! Ron, you did it!”</p><p>Ron turned beet red. “Yeah, I guess,” he mumbled. “But, wait, doesn’t Snape only accept those with an ‘O’ into NEWT level Potions?” His face dropped as he turned to Harry. “Sorry, mate, guess we won’t be becoming aurors together…”</p><p>Harry looked down; he still hadn’t told his friend that he did not want to be an auror anymore-- after all, if he did, it would bring the question of ‘why not.’ However, Harry had known he would have had to say something eventually. “Ron…”</p><p>“Hey, maybe you can convince him Snape change his mind, Harry!” Ron piped up. “He seems to like you now.”</p><p>“That might be putting it a bit strongly,” Harry told him. “Pretty sure he’s still not that fond of me…” Although, that wasn’t actually true, Harry realized, once again-- he had grown so accustomed to thinking Snape hated him that such a response came automatically despite the past few months counteracting that thought.</p><p>“Bollocks,” Hermione told Harry. “For whatever reason, you’ve seemed to have grown on Snape; Ron’s right, maybe you can convince him.”</p><p>Harry found himself promising to do so, despite knowing that such merely continued to falsely lead Ron on.</p>
