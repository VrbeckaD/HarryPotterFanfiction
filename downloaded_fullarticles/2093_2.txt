    <p>Harry had even start to appreciate the potion lessons now that he didn’t need to see Snape's face in them, and now that he had the half-blood prince's book to aid him in all the tasks the teacher requested. It was amazing how small changes could do good for some people. Unfortunately, something that hadn’t changed was that gryffindor and slytherin still had this class together. Although, since only 12 students had obtained a grade to continue in the class, they shared that class with all the other houses. Harry sat next to Ronald, Ernesto Macmillan, whom Harry liked, despite his pompous manner, and Hermione. Four Ravenclaw students shared a table farther apart, and another table, the nearest table, was occupied by four Slytherins. The professor had just entered the room and organized his material for the class of that day when Harry noticed the cauldrons standing in front of the class and heard that drawn voice, which he could recognize anywhere, exclaim with contempt.</p><p>- Hey, Potter! This horrible potion stinks like you. Disgusting, isn’t it? – The Slytherins laughed contemptuously. Malfoy was sitting with Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson and another student who Potter didn’t remember the name, maybe it was Nott.</p><p>-  Shut up, Malfoy. I can’t smell anything because of the disgusting stench of your disgusting shampoo. – He replied irritably, causing the gryffindor to mutter in approval.</p><p>Slughorn laughed. He missed being young and able to bark that way, but his smile widened as he turned to the group and asked:</p><p>-  Now class, after this incredible demonstration of good manners, who could tell me what a potion that is? – Hermione raised her hand quickly, as was her custom, receiving a smile of approval from the teacher who soon gave room for the girl to respond.</p><p>-  It’s Amortentia, sir. – She started, stiffening in her chair. - The most powerful love potion available. It smells different to each of us, according to what attracts us. And yes, boys. - She continued, now with a smile on her face. - We've all heard your previous comments.</p><p>The two boys were as red as possible in the midst of laughter from the other students and a frown from Ron. The eyes met and were quickly diverted as the teacher turned again to the students:</p><p>- Take the scales and the potion kits and don’t forget the Advanced Potion-Making...</p><p>Harry took a deep breath as he began to pick up his materials with the whole class, the noise filled the classroom, and he again glanced at Malfoy, who gave him a pleasant smile, making something similar to spring on his face.</p>
