    <p>Harry was panicking, to say the least. Thankfully, Ginny had been the one to take charge and ensure that James and Albus were ready for Hogwarts; and that Lily wouldn't throw a fit when she watched her older brothers leave. Harry didn't know what he would do without Ginny, but lately he found himself wondering what he could do without her a lot lately. </p><p> "Dad!" Albus whined. They were all standing in front of the train. Albus had been trying to get Harry to snap out of whatever spell had gone over him. "We're about to leave. Are you gonna take the train with us?" </p><p>"I don't think so, son. You go ahead with James; socialize. This is gonna be your first year! And mine too." Harry chuckled nervously. Harry had quit his Auror job for the Defense of the Dark Arts Professor gig. Headmistress McGonagall had ringed him to offer him the position, but Harry knew she wasn't offering. She needed him to take it; she wouldn't have bothered him if she didn't. </p><p> "Okay, then. See ya!" Albus smiled and hugged Harry tightly before doing the same to Ginny and Lily. James merely waved goodbye and hurried off to his friends. Ginny smiled that smile Harry fell in love with so long ago. The one where the ends of her eyes would crinkle and her dimple would show. Her eyes were glazed with tears and Harry knew she was holding back from crying because she was holding his hand with all her might. Lily waved goodbye sadly, she wanted to go to Hogwarts already, she had told Harry and Ginny when they asked what was eating at her. </p><p> Harry waved the train goodbye as it became smaller and smaller in the horizon. Suddenly, Harry became distracted by light footsteps coming from behind them. The stranger became familiar when Harry saw short blonde hair, a lean body, and striking blue-grey eyes. </p><p> Draco Malfoy stood at the edge of the platform, cursing and pinching the bridge of his nose. Harry felt Ginny release her hold on him. </p><p> "I'm gonna check on him," Harry mumbled quietly. "I'll catch up with you." Ginny nodded slowly before taking Lily out of the hidden station and to their car. "Malfoy?"</p><p> Draco looked over at Harry. "Potter? Good to see you," Draco smiled and turned to him. "You're heading to Hogwarts too, right? I mean, it's all over the news. 'Handsome prat goes from respected Auror to boring Hogwarts teacher'." Draco grinned when Harry laughed and shook his head.</p><p> "Never stopped being a git, have you?" Harry snorted. </p><p> "Of course not, Potter. Who am I? Ronald?" Draco sighed and scratched the back of his head. Harry laughed and asked Draco why he was still at the station, which had become suddenly empty. "Truth be told, I was supposed to go by train with my son, Scorpius. But I needed to use the men's room and, well, now I have no way of getting there."</p><p> "To Hogwarts? Why would you need to go?" Harry asked, making sure to make a mental note of how the hell Draco Malfoy has a son.</p><p> "I'm the new Potions Professor." Draco grinned and Harry felt his chest tighten at his gorgeous smile. "Severus always told me to stay away from the job. 'Hell', was the word he used to describe it. He told me to be a medic." Draco shook his head. "But who would hire a Malfoy now? Our name is disgraced. I practically begged McGonagall for this job." </p><p>Harry frowned. It had been a while since he heard anything bad about the Malfoys, but that didn't mean that people forgot. Everyone knew Draco Malfoy isâ€”was a Death Eater; it's a difficult thing to ignore when he has the Dark Mark permanently on his arm.<br/>
"I forgot about that." Harry said without thinking.</p><p> "Right. You would forget." Draco muttered, losing eye contact. Harry mentally punched himself.</p><p> "Right. Well, look, um...I can give you a ride. I'm driving there anyway." Harry offered.</p><p>Draco smiled. "Sure, I can take that up." Harry smiled in return and the two men walked out the station. Harry quickly manuvered his way to his wife and daughter. Harry picked Lily up. </p><p> "Are you leaving right now?" Lily asked with a pout. "Why don't you stay a bit longer?" </p><p>Ginny giggled. "Sweetheart, daddy needs to be there before the students. It's unprofessional if he's late." Ginny gave Harry a kiss before greeting Draco. "Hey Draco, how are you?" </p><p> Draco looked baffled for a second, but recomposed himself quickly. "I'm good. I missed the train, so Harry offered to drive me to Hogwarts. It's a long story, but I'm the new potions professor. How are you Ginny?"</p><p> "I'm good," she smiled. "I'm working as a trainee medic. The Quidditch thing is starting to die down with age." She laughed, making them all laugh.</p><p>"And who's this adorable little one?" Draco turned his attention to Lily, who giggled with amusement. </p><p> "I'm Lily Luna Potter!" She gleamed with pride. </p><p>"Such a beautiful name. I suppose it's only fitting for an equally beautiful girl." Draco grinned when Lily giggled with laughter. </p><p> "Thank you!" Lily reached out to give Draco a high five, which he gave her. "I like him, dad!" </p><p> Harry laughed. "I'm glad you do, sweetie. But Draco and I have to go now." </p><p>Lily sighed when Ginny took her from Harry's arms. Harry shared a quick hug and good-byes with Lily and Ginny before he and Draco started walking towards another car that was closely parked to Ginny's. </p><p> "You have a nice family, Potter." Draco said when they were both seated in the car. Harry started to drive with a smile.</p><p> "Thank you. I have two older boys too, ya know. James and Albus." Harry looked over at Draco. "You have one son?"</p><p> "Yup. Little Scorpius." Draco shifted uncomfortably. "He's starting his first year today." </p><p> "Hey! Albus is too!" Harry laughed. "Before I get side tracked though; what poor woman did you knock up?"</p><p> "Actually...I got knocked up." Draco said bashfully. "I had a one night stand with some guy."</p><p>  Harry put on a confused face. "um...sorry to argue but, guys can't get pregnant." Harry could practically hear the eye role.</p><p> "Vela guys can." Draco explained briefly. "Did you ever pay attention to Health class, Potter?" </p><p> "Oh, sorry." Harry said sarcastically. "I was too busy saving the world."</p><p> They laughed in unison. They sat quietly for a bit before they began to reminisce on old memories of Hogwarts, like Hogsmeade and classes, up until they began to talk more specifically.</p><p> "You were an arsehole, you know that?" Harry snorted.</p><p> "I know." Draco sighed. "I actually wanted to talk to you about that."</p><p> "What is there to say man?" </p><p> "I'm sorry." Draco said slowly. As if tasting the words. "I'm sorry." He said more naturally. </p><p> Harry glanced at him. "Oh. Okay." He said awkwardly. Never could he imagine Malfoy saying sorry. No, this is Draco. "Thanks."</p><p>"Yeah,"</p><p>They shared a comfortable silence. Harry's lips were tugged up into a smile and Draco leaned his forehead against the cool glass window. </p><p>--------</p><p> They arrived before the train and entered Hogwarts at it's full glory. Decorated and vibrant, ready for the old and new students who were bound to be nervous for the new year. When everyone did arrive, Harry and Draco sat next to each other in the front of the room near the sorting hat. The two fathers watched carefully when their sons were up next. Surprisingly, the two looked like they had become friends and were standing beside each other in line. </p><p>First was Scorpius; the two fathers watched carefully as the Sorting Hat sat snuggly on the blonde's head and them screeched: "SLYTHERIN". Draco smiled fondly. "I honestly thought he would be a Gryffindor."</p><p> "No? Really?" Harry chuckled and sent a curious look towards Draco.</p><p> "Really. He's nothing like me. He's honest and innocent, but maybe my perception of him is deceived because he's my son." Draco shrugged. "Nonetheless, I'm proud." </p><p> Harry nodded in agreement, only half stening because Albus walked up to the hat next. There was an uncomfortable silence that fell amongst the children and teacher because the hat had been on Albus for a good minute. </p><p> "SLYTHERIN! SLYTHERIN! SLYTHERIN! I SHALL NOT DECEIVE MY JUDGEMENT EVER AGAIN. SLYTHERIN!" The hat screeched. Albus looked near tears as he ran off, out of the dining hall and into the corridors. Harry stood to follow him hut Draco made him sit back down.</p><p> "Go now, and he'll only feel more shame." Draco hissed, not looking Harry in the eye. Harry nodded and realized Draco is right. </p><p> The evening continued and somewhere towards the end Albus had returned with Scorpius who had discreetly exited the hall only minutes before. Draco smiled and shook his head. "How silly." Draco said when all the teachers stood to exit. </p><p> "What?" Harry asked. "What's silly?"</p><p> "A Potter and a Malfoy, already best of friends." Draco snickered. "Our sons, I mean. Obviously, still need work on our relationship."  </p><p> Harry laughed, drawing attention from some students. "Bloody Malfoy." He snorted. "You're right! We were enemies, and now our sons look like they could be bloody brothers." </p><p> Draco smiled awkwardly. "Right. Well, if you're done making a fool of yourself, where in the hell are our quarters?" </p><p> "You'll be sharing a room, boys." McGonagall said from behind them. Making the two men jump.</p><p> "What?" Harry asked, no longer smiling.</p><p> "We ran out of rooms. Some of them are under repair. Here's the key, make a copy if you need it. It's in the Slytherin tower." McGonagall walked away, leaving Draco and Harry shocked.</p><p> "Well, roomie," Draco patted Harry's back. "I'll take the top bunk." </p><p> Harry laughed and shook his head. "When did you become a bloody comedian?" </p><p> Draco rolled his eyes and lead the way to the Slytherin Common Rooms.</p><p>---</p><p>When they walked in, they realized how chaotic children really are. All of them were laughing and bouncing around and throwing things at each other. Draco searched the crowd for Scorpius and Albus but didn't see them. </p><p> "Why in the hell would they give us a room in the tower?" Draco whispered to Harry.</p><p> "It's probably that one room at the very top, the one we weren't allowed in?" Harry responded and Draco nodded in agreement. The two walked up the steps and found the room Harry had mentioned. Luckily, the key fit and they went in. There was one massive bed, but still it was only one.</p><p> "Luckily, we've slept together before." Draco huffed. "At least I know you're not atrocious." </p><p> Harry glared. "Shut up, Malfoy." </p><p> Draco tossed his luggage down and laid on the left side of the bed. "Oh, quit your whining. We've got to make the most out of this you know."</p><p> Harry did the same, but laying down on the right. "Of course." They laid in silence for a long time. "Do you think..maybe that was a mistake?" Harry said in a hushed tone.</p><p> "Us sleeping together?" </p><p> "No. I mean, taking this job?" Harry sighed, staring at the grey ceiling. "Should I have stayed an Auror?" </p><p> "For the muscles? Maybe. For what's right?" Draco sat up, and looked at Harry. "For yourself? No, Potter. You shouldn't've stayed an Auror. You're doing right by being here. You belong here." </p><p> Harry turned his gaze to Draco's. "You really think so?" </p><p> "Yeah." Draco said quietly while he laid back down to stare at the ceiling. "I do."</p>
