    <p>Harry darted around a corner, ducking as he went to dodge a suit of armor. He charged down the corridor at top speed, chancing a look behind him just in time to see a light flicker from around the corner. He whipped his head back around to see where he was going and was startled to see that he was near the Astronomy Tower.</p><p>He made a split-second decision to sprint up the spiral staircase in the, likely vain, hope that Filch would assume he had gone right towards Gryffindor Tower.</p><p>After what felt like an interminable period of panting and the sound of his pounding heart filling his ears, Harry made it to the top of the tower. He braced his hands on the railing along the top of the tower and rested his forehead against his hands as he attempted to regain his breath. The moonlit view of the grounds, the stars, and the lake was simply breathtaking, but he took in none of it.</p><p>Once he could breathe again, he lifted his head off of his hands and took a step backwards, away from the edge of the tower. Then he continued backing up until his back was braced against the doorframe, immediately flinching away from it.</p><p>Harry clenched his fists to stop himself from rubbing at his back and making things worse. He wasn’t sure how he had managed it, but he had somehow managed to forget that his back hadn’t yet healed from his last encounter with Vernon’s belt. Harry sighed and sat down on the rapidly cooling stones of the tower’s roof, gently resting his back against the door frame so as to not aggravate his injuries a second time. He closed his eyes and waited for his heart to stop pounding.</p><p>After a few quiet minutes, Harry opened his eyes again and looked up at the sky. As had been his habit for the past few months, he scanned the sky for Sirius, the dog star.</p><p>After a long silence in which Harry stared at the night sky, he began to speak. “I miss you, Sirius. I’ve never felt so alone in my life. At least when I was a kid at the Dursley’s, I didn’t really know what I was missing. But now I do know, and you’re not the only one who’s left me. Ron and Hermione have started dating, so they never seem to have time for me anymore. I see them every day, but we rarely talk like we used to. I want to tell them I want to spend more time with them, but I don’t know how to do that. Every time I try, I clam up and can’t go through with it. I’ve never had friends before Ron, you know.” Harry paused, and took a deep, steadying breath.</p><p>“At least I can take advantage of their absence to make up for all the time I should have spent studying over the years. I have to be ready to face Voldemort next time I face him. I can’t be responsible for any more people dying. I just can’t.</p><p>“I wish you were here, Sirius. I’m sure you would have some great tips for dueling, and you could help me figure out how to tell Ron and Hermione that I’m being left out. Maybe I’d even tell you about this summer at the Dursley’s. They were worse than they’ve ever been before. I guess they blame me for the dementor attack, and that therapy that Dudley had to do. I don’t even want to think about it.” Harry sighed and closed his eyes.</p><p>With his eyes closed, he was inexplicably reminded of Occlumency lessons with Snape. And with the reminder, he was filled with the same remorse, shame, and rage he always felt when he thought of Occlumency– and specifically of the way that the lessons were terminated.</p><p>The memory of Harry's invasion of Snape’s privacy brought about the shame and remorse. But then the memory of his genuine efforts to learn Occlumency came forward and shame morphed violently into rage. Because he <em>had</em> tried as hard as he could, but the instruction he had received had not been adequate for him to learn. And his frustration with his inability to learn Occlumency led his thoughts back to that confrontation in Umbridge’s office. But before Harry could spiral further, he did his best to clear his mind.</p><p>Harry managed a small degree of success at clearing his mind. Sometime later, he opened his eyes and looked at his watch. He stared at it blankly for a few seconds before remembering that it hadn’t worked since the second task last year.</p><p>“<em>Tempus</em>,” Harry incanted under his breath. At the result, he made a sound of shock and got to his feet.</p><p>Harry looked up at the sky for one last look at Sirius.</p><p>Then Harry shook his head and hurried out of the tower. He hadn’t meant to stay for long, and now it was long after midnight. Hours had passed since he had charged up to the tower to escape Filch.</p><p>Harry thought longingly of the Marauder’s Map and invisibility cloak sitting uselessly in his trunk and sighed. There was nothing for it but to head back to his dorm and hope it was too late for any professors to be patrolling.</p>
<hr/><p>“Harry! Where were you last night?" Hermione exclaimed. "Ron and I were worried sick! We thought for sure that you’d had a vision, or that something unspeakably horrible had happened to you, or that-“</p><p>“Relax Hermione! Let the poor guy get a word in edgewise.” Ron broke in, sharing an exasperated look with Harry.</p><p>Harry grinned at Ron. It felt just like old times.</p><p>“It was neither of those things," Harry said. "You didn’t really need to worry. The worst thing that could have happened to me was detention with Filch.”</p><p>“But how were we to know that? There’s always trouble and danger following you.” Hermione said with a concerned look.</p><p>“It’s nowhere near the end of the year though! You know that trouble keeps its distance until right around finals,” Harry said with an unmistakable tone that meant he thought Hermione ought to have known that. “Anyways,” Harry continued, “did I miss anything other than a Hermione-panic?”</p><p>“I’ll tell you on the way to breakfast, I’m absolutely starving!” Ron said with typical enthusiasm.</p><p>“A nutritious breakfast is essential to a healthy diet, but Ron and I made plans to have breakfast with Professor McGonagall to discuss our career options,” Hermione said, sending a significant look at Ron.</p><p>“Didn’t we already do that last year?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the rising suspicion that Ron and Hermione were lying to him so they could go off alone.</p><p>“Of course we did, Harry," Hermione said with an airy laugh. "But I’ve done some more research, and I have some more questions that intrigued Ron, too, so we want to go ask Professor McGonagall," she said, looking to Ron for support.</p><p>Ron nodded belatedly.</p><p>Then Hermione quickly added, “You should go and eat breakfast without us in the Great Hall, but we’ll be late if we don’t leave now!” The last few words of that were said as she grabbed Ron’s arm and began dragging him to the portrait hole.</p><p>“See ya mate!” Ron called over his shoulder as he disappeared into the hallway.</p><p>Harry looked away to hide the flash of hurt he felt. This would be the third time he had been abandoned for breakfast in as many days. There had been a time when practically nothing would have prevented Ron and Hermione from eating with him– never mind ditching him specifically so they could have time without Harry and then lying about it on top of that.</p><p>Harry shook his head to clear it of his thoughts and turned to go down for breakfast. </p><p>“Wait up Harry!” Ginny called as she rushed down stairs.</p><p>Harry stopped and turned to face Ginny. “Hey,” he said, a lingering tone of sadness in his voice that he couldn’t quite manage to stop.</p><p>“Did you want to get breakfast with me? I heard Ron and Hermione 'had an appointment with McGonagall’ and that they’re ditching you again,” Ginny said, the disbelief evident in her voice.</p><p>Harry cleared his throat. “Yeah, Hermione said that she and Ron have more questions for McGonagall," Harry said. "And I’d love to get breakfast with you,” he added. After a pause, Harry continued, “Maybe you can tell me about whatever it was that Ron was going to tell me about.”</p><p>“I can definitely do that! He was probably going to tell you about Gryffindor’s newest student, not that there’s a whole to tell, but can we walk and talk to breakfast?” Ginny suggested as she moved towards the portrait hole. “I’m starving!” she exclaimed beckoning Harry to follow her.</p><p>“That sounds good,” Harry said and followed Ginny out of the common room.</p><p>Harry and Ginny walked through the hallways in companionably silence. Harry rarely got to spend time with Ginny without the company of one of her many brothers, regardless of if that time was spent here at Hogwarts or at the Burrow, so this was different, but nice. </p><p>After some time, Harry broke the silence and asked, “So, what’s the deal with this new student? Why weren’t they at the sorting ceremony? They’re not a first year, are they?”</p><p>Ginny shrugged. “Like I said, there’s not a whole to tell. McGonagall didn’t really say much about him. All we know is that his name is Alfonse, he’s in your year, and he’s really standoffish. At least," she added, "We think he's standoffish because he refused to at all talk to anyone last night and left immediately after McGonagall announced him– which was really weird, too.”</p><p>“A mystery then,” Harry said with a jocular lilt to his voice. “Hopefully a less dangerous mystery than the ones I usually deal with.”</p><p>A group of Hufflepuffs walked by, so Harry and Ginny paused their conversation until they had passed.</p><p>Harry continued, “It’s weird, I didn’t see an extra bed in my dorm last night. Does that mean he’s sleeping somewhere else?”</p><p>Ginny pushed open the doors to the Great Hall and said, “I think McGonagall said that he would be properly moving in later today– maybe that means furniture, too.”</p><p>“So, I guess we’ll meet him soon,” Harry sat down and scanned down the table away from the door trying to spot an unfamiliar face, “It doesn’t look like he’s here yet.”</p><p>Ginny followed suit. When Harry suddenly nudged her in the ribs, she startled. "Sorry," Harry said quietly. Then he discretely pointed at a student down at the end of the table away from the doors. “Is that him?” </p><p>“No, you arse, that’s Satchel Montmorrison. He’s a seventh- “</p><p>“Can I sit here?” someone said, causing Harry and Ginny to quickly snap their heads around.</p><p>Standing across the seat from Harry and Ginny, there was a tall, blonde student with cropped hair, a short stubby nose, and light brown eyes.</p><p>The student gestured at the empty seat and said, “My name is Alfonse, by the way.”</p>
<hr/><p>Severus narrowed his eyes at the bubbling cauldron. It had just turned a sapphire blue and all of the previous trials had gone terribly wrong not long after the potion had achieved this particular shade of blue.</p><p>The urge to start adding any and every ingredient in his immediate vicinity to the cauldron in the hopes of salvaging the potion settled in, as it occasionally did when a trial started going wrong.</p><p>However, his common sense prevailed, and he continued with his original plan. He had based his plan on the latest research and the results of previous experiments, hopeful that this time he had pinpointed- and corrected– the problem with the potion.</p><p>According to his plan, Severus then added exactly 10 mg of finely ground erumpet horn to the cauldron, stirred three time clockwise, and was about to stir six times counterclockwise when he heard someone enter his quarters.</p><p>After he had been discovered as a spy, his personal quarters had been warded even more heavily than they had ever been before. Since his quarters had already been one of the highest security areas of the already secure castle, this was fairly significant. After the warding increase, only Severus and Albus Dumbledore had access. And even then, the only reason Dumbledore had access was because he had insisted that someone needed to have access in the event that Severus injured himself while conducting one of his experiments.</p><p>Severus had agreed only reluctantly. While on some level, he did agree that it was safer to have an exception to the wards, another equally loud part of him had screamed warnings at the thought of even one chink in the armor that was his wards. </p><p>Returning his thoughts to the present, Severus was able to easily contain the explosion that resulted from Dumbledore upsetting the balance of the magical energies in the lab.</p><p>Severus reached up to grab the neutralizer from where he kept it on the shelf above his cauldron. He dumped in the appropriate amount to prevent what was left in the cauldron from reacting with anything and then sprinkled the powder over the rest of the splashed potion. Finally, Severus turned around to confirm that, yes, Dumbledore had in fact walked into his lab without knocking, or better yet, giving Severus advance warning of his visit.</p><p>“Is there something you wanted, Professor?” Severus ground out, glaring directly at Dumbledore. “Because this trial was nearly complete when you walked in and caused an explosion with your vast levels of ambient magic. As I remember, I agreed to have you keyed into my wards to help keep me from danger, not so you could put me in more danger with your thoughtlessness.”</p><p>“Why yes, there was something of great importance that I wanted to discuss with you. I am very sorry that I disturbed your brewing, though I am sure you were perfectly equipped to handle any damage I may have done,” Dumbledore said regretfully. “You see, I was quite unaware that you had moved on to an experiment that was so very sensitive. Last I heard, you were experimenting on a potion that cared not at all about the magical environment.”</p><p>Severus growled inwardly at the implication that he was supposed to keep Dumbledore constantly up to date on his experiments. With all the free time he now had thanks to not having spy duties, he was moving through trials faster than ever before, and to keep Dumbledore updated would require seeing the man far more frequently than Severus was willing to.</p><p>“Would you like to move this discussion to my office? After all, the only reason I came in here and interrupted your brewing was because you have a distressing lack of tea in your kitchen,” Dumbledore concluded.</p><p>“You should know by now that I rely upon the house elves for tea, and while you may have been unaware of the sensitive nature of my experiments, it seems as if you were merely too impatient to wait for me to see you.” Severus said with a hard look in his eyes.</p><p>Dumbledore hummed as he looked at the ceiling in a rather guilty fashion and popped a lemon drop into his mouth. “It appears you’ve caught me,” he said around the lemon drop. “I do still wish to move this to my office, though.”</p><p>“Fine. It’s not like I have anything urgent to do, now that my experiment has been utterly ruined.” Severus looked at the disgusting mess in his cauldrons and resolved to assign Potter to clean them in his next detention. If only in the privacy of his mind, Severus had to admit that the brat could get a cauldron clean.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled happily and stepped aside so Severus could lead the way to the fireplace. Severus grabbed a handful of floo powder and threw it into the gently crackling fire, making the flames grow and turn a vibrant shade of green.</p><p>“Headmaster’s office,” Severus called as he stepped smoothly into the fire.</p><p>Severus landed on his feet in Dumbledore’s office. He stepped to the side of the fireplace and meticulously removed any ash or dust that had managed to cling to his robes with a quick <em>Scourgify</em>.</p><p>He looked up from his inspection of his robes just in time to see Dumbledore land in front of the fireplace. Dumbledore immediately went to sit in the chair behind his desk, gesturing for Severus to take one of the guest chairs as he went. Severus glared distastefully at the discordantly-patterned plush armchair, and immediately transfigured it into a more practical chair.</p><p>“I see some things never change” Dumbledore said, “I remember when you were a student and-"</p><p>Severus tuned out Dumbledore at this point. He longed to interrupt Dumbledore and put an end to his useless reminiscing with a snide, 'I may have more time now that I no longer have to spy, but I do still have things to do. Lessons to plan. Potions to brew,' but really, he had to much respect for the man to do that. So he continued to sit in bored silence.</p><p>Eventually, Dumbledore reached the point he was trying to make, and Severus tuned back in in time to hear Dumbledore say, “As you know, Harry is destined to play a vital part in this war, however much I may wish it weren’t so. After the unfortunate events at the end of last year, I have a feeling that Harry has grown up enough to begin to take on a more active part in the war.”</p><p>The twinkle in Dumbledore’s eye dimmed ever so slightly, but he continued, “Yet I do not know for sure where his maturity level is, and I must be sure that he can handle it, before I tell him about Voldemort’s horcruxes; it could be disastrous if he is not,” Dumbledore sighed and stroked Fawkes lovingly.</p><p>Severus had begun to feel an inkling of forboding rise within him, and he quickly Occluded so he could listen without doing something rash.</p><p>“And since the events of this past summer put you in grave danger from Voldemort's lackeys, I fear that our best efforts to protect you with increased wards on your quarters are not enough to guarantee your safety. Additionally, you have never been subtle about your distaste for teaching. And, on top of all that, I suspect you may have some feelings of impotency from the loss of your spy duties. These are, of course, all problems that need a solution, and I have finally sorted one out.</p><p>"You will deage yourself to Harry’s age and become his friend!” Dumbledore exclaimed, causing the twinkle in his eyes to come back brighter than before. “You can get to know Harry and judge his maturity level.” Dumbledore leaned back in his chair and steepled his fingers as he smiled in satisfaction. “I’ve made all the arrangements with Minerva. Your name will be Alfonse Hopkirk. You-"</p><p>Up until Dumbledore had said that, Severus had been sitting in stunned silence, though the casual observer would not have been able to discern any such emotion from his face. A small, distant, part of his mind resonated with familiarity at the last name, but he shook it off as the impact of both parts of the ridiculous pseudonym Dumbledore seemed to expect him to adopt sank in. This snapped out of his stunned silence, causing him to abandon his resolution to not be rash.</p><p>“Headmaster,” Severus snapped, “Are you joking? Because this has none of the usual hallmarks of your jokes. Those, at least, tend to have some element of humor.”</p><p>“Aha! So, you admit that my jokes are funny!”</p><p>“Headmaster, you know that’s not the point," Severus said exasperatedly. "Why did you really call me here?” Severus rather hoped his Occlumency shields were sufficient to keep the note of horror out of his voice.</p><p>“I’ve told you, my dear boy, I need you to go undercover as a student in Harry’s year and assess his character for me.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Severus- “</p><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>“It’s this or accompany Remus on an envoy to the werewolves.”</p><p>There was another shocked silence as Severus assessed the possibility that Dumbledore would carry through with the threat. He came to the regrettable conclusion that he couldn’t say, with any degree of certainty, that the threat was only a threat. Severus narrowed his eyes and said, “That’s low even for you.”</p><p>“I can’t think of an easier way to get you to agree to do this for me. Except for bringing up Lily, but I think that’s a lower blow.” Dumbledore said with the happiness that only one who has just gotten their way can achieve.</p><p>Severus crossed his arms and stared stonily at one of the many trinkets in Dumbledore’s office. A part of Severus knew he looked like a petulant child in that pose, but he decided that given the situation and what he was being asked to do, he was allowed to indulge himself.</p><p>And if anyone asked, he was simply getting into character.</p><p>After some time, Severus heaved a sigh and muttered an agreement before rather hastily heading for the fireplace.</p><p>“Wait, Severus, we have details to discuss” Dumbledore called after him.</p><p>Severus paused mere feet from freedom and turned around. “Since you clearly have this all planned out,” he began slowly, desperately trying to find the words that would allow him to escape as he continued to talk, “you can send me the details in a letter. In the meantime, I have some brewing to do, since I evidently must build up a stock for Poppy.”</p><p>Sighing deeply, Dumbledore said, “If you insist, though I really think you ought to play some part in developing the identity you will be assuming for some time.”</p><p>Severus gave Dumbledore a disdainful look and moved the last couple feet towards the fireplace and picked up a handful of floo powder. He turned back towards Dumbledore, floo powder still in hand, and said, “Really, how long could it possibly take to confirm that Potter is an immature brat?”</p><p>Turning back around for a final time he tossed in the floo powder as he called out, “Severus’s Quarters.”</p>
<hr/><p>Albus watched Severus disappear into the fireplace and smiled happily to himself. That could have gone worse, much worse. Albus reached into his desk and pulled out quill and parchment to send Severus a letter. In code, Albus outlined the details of Severus's latest undercover assignment. Though really, there really wasn’t much to put down– just the pseudonym and things like 'Alfonse's' birthday that were in the file that Albus had fabricated specifically for this purpose. The rest, Albus had left for Severus to fabricate on his own. He was certainly skilled enough to do so.</p><p>With a flourish, Albus signed his name and banished the letter to appear on Severus’s desk.</p><p>Albus leaned back and put his legs on his desk, secure in the knowledge that Minerva was halfway across the castle teaching the third year Ravenclaw’s and Hufflepuff’s, and thus unable to scold him for his childish behavior.</p><p>As he reclined in his chair, he reflected on the crucial nature of Snape’s success. Despite what he’d like Severus to believe, getting an accurate assessment of Harry’s character was not the primary objective for Severus’s time undercover. To be completely honest, and Dumbledore could be in the sanctity of his own mind, it wasn’t even an objective at all. Harry had always been far too mature for his age, and Albus could have, and probably should have, told Harry about most of the things that he needed to know years ago.</p><p>However, the fact remained that Albus had told him nothing over the years, and this gave him an excellent façade for the real reason Severus was being sent undercover.</p><p>Albus had a growing conviction that the animosity Severus persisted in holding against Harry was unnecessarily hindering the war effort. Were they on better terms, the events that had lead to the demise of Harry’s godfather may have been prevented. So, to end the animosity, Albus concluded that forcing Severus to get to know Harry was vital, and that having Severus go undercover as a new Gryffindor was the way to go about it.</p><p>And, Dumbledore supposed, at the end of the whole thing he could, and should, start divulging some of the important war-relevant information to Harry.</p><p>Albus congratulated himself on a plan well plotted with yet another lemon drop.</p>
<hr/><p>It was time. Severus was once again in Dumbledore’s office, glaring at the bottle containing the potion that he was soon to drink. This whole affair was utterly ridiculous, and Severus half-expected to wake up any moment now. If he was being honest, it was more of a desperate hope that he would wake up and find that this whole nightmare had only been a fever dream.</p><p>In less than an hour, Minerva would be introducing him to the denizens of Gryffindor Tower as their newest housemate, Alfonse Hopkirk. Thankfully, Dumbledore had left most of the details of his past up to him. Severus shuddered to think what Dumbledore would have come up with on his own.</p><p>Really, the name was bad enough as it was.</p><p>“You know glaring at that potion won’t make this situation disappear,” Dumbledore said with a self-satisfied smile and a twinkle in his eye.</p><p>Severus shifted his glare from the potion vial to Dumbledore’s face, and said, “No, but it is the conduit of your asinine plan.”</p><p>“Really, Severus,” Dumbledore said, “It’s not that odious of a task, nor should it take you too long. You should be taking the antidote, and returning to your usual form, well before winter break.”</p><p>“Winter Break? As in three months from now? You can’t possibly believe that it will take me that long to befriend the Potter boy and assess his character?” Severus asked incredulously.</p><p>“Now, now Severus, it’s unlikely that you’ll get any deeper understanding of Harry’s character in less time than that.”</p><p>Severus hated to admit it, but he rather suspected that Dumbledore was right about that. He had, however unwillingly, observed that Potter did tend to keep to himself, with the obvious exceptions of the youngest Weasley boy and Granger.</p><p>Dumbledore gestured to the potion vial that Severus still, somewhat unwittingly, clutched with a tighter grip than absolutely necessary. “Why don’t you go ahead and drink that so Minerva can introduce you to the Gryffindor’s, and you can get back to your last night in your quarters?”</p><p>Severus grimaced at this reminder that he would not have access to his quarters, but did as Dumbledore suggested, knocking back the potion as quickly as he could to avoid tasting it.</p><p>At first nothing seemed to happen– Severus felt no changes to his physiology and there was no other indicators of magic occurring. After another moment, Dumbledore opened his mouth, perhaps to speculate about what had gone wrong, when a bright white flash filled the room, blinding Severus.</p><p>Severus blinked until the spots cleared him vision, realizing at some point during this process that the expected physiological changes had occurred. He was now viewing the world from a significantly lower vantage point. Looking around, it began to sink in that Severus was gone and that, in his place, was Alfonse Hopkirk.</p><p>“Well, the books certainly didn’t warn me of that startling transition,” Dumbledore said brightly as he conjured a mirror in front of Severus.</p><p>Severus took a steadying breath before examining himself. Alfonse was obviously shorter than Severus was. Though, Severus was extraordinarily tall, so even with the height reduction, Alfonse was still quite tall. Where long, dark, greasy hair had hung about a long face and even longer nose, there was now spiky blonde hair that refused to stay flat even as Severus pushed it down. His nose was no longer the crooked monstrosity that others had described it as in their taunts, but was short and rather stubby. Light brown eyes sat underneath thick, untamed eyebrows that arched elegantly and clashed peculiarly with his stubby nose and completely ordinary mouth.</p><p>“I look ridiculous,” Severus said, keeping his other observations to himself.</p><p>“You look fine, dear boy, and in any case, it’ll only be a couple weeks, just avoid mirrors for that long! You won’t even start anymore vampire rumors since you won’t be you!”</p><p>Severus held very still to suppress any reaction to the terrible joke, and in doing so noticed how different his body felt. To distract himself from the uncomfortable feeling, his mind drifted off to think about the potion that brought him into this position.</p><p>Originally, the potion's intended use had apparently been to cure warts. Dumbledore had found the potion in an obscure book by an obscure author, and in a footnote, the author had noted that one of the potion's side-effects was that it would allow the drinker to take on a different appearance for any period time of time. Almost as an afterthought, the author had added that the effect would last until the antidote was consumed.</p><p>Further research had revealed that the appearance seemed to be completely up to the whims of magic Herself. Someone had discovered that the age and gender desired could be specified with subtle adjustments to the recipe. But even at the peak of the potion’s use, nobody had ever found a way to specify the appearance the potion would give- though, for obvious reasons, the potion never gave an appearance with warts.</p><p>Then, as with many appearance altering methods, the potion came into popularity with the seedier elements of the world. At around the same time a side-effect free version of the wart-removing potion was developed, and the use of the original was outlawed. Then, with time, the potion was subsequently forgotten by most. That is, until Dumbledore dug up the recipe, and Severus brewed it.</p><p>Thinking of it now, Severus had to wonder if this hare-brained plan hadn’t been conceived of as a result of Dumbledore finding the recipe. After all, it would have been incredibly difficult to find, if Dumbledore had simply been looking for it, rather than if he had stumbled across it accidentally. Of course, it was also possible that Dumbledore was old enough to remember when the potion was in use. </p><p>Severus brought his mind back to the present now that he felt more settled. He noticed, then, that his trademark robes hung loosely off his shoulders, making him look younger than he was supposed to. Severus held his arm out in front of him and inspected the increased amount of fabric hanging down and covering his hand.</p><p>If Severus had had less experience with hiding his emotions, he’d probably have sworn angrily or, at least, sighed resignedly at the sight of his robes. However, Severus did have extensive experience with hiding his emotions, and however much he may have wanted to give in to those urges, the only indicator of the anger and resignation he felt was an additional glint to his now light brown eyes. He waved his wand and resized his robes to the proper size.</p><p>Dumbledore clucked disapprovingly and waved his own wand. Severus’s robes were now the Hogwarts uniform, complete with Gryffindor crest and tie. A brief shadow flitted across Severus’s face, too fast for the casual observer to notice, indicating his anger at the change forced upon him.</p><p>“Well that certainly worked. You look almost nothing like yourself, Alfonse.” Dumbledore said.</p><p>Severus began, a little incredulously “Of course it worked! I made the potion after all.” He continued, now a little annoyed, “and why are you calling me Alfonse? I may have to go by that ridiculous pseudonym for your little charade, but my name is still Severus.”</p><p>“For you to be most successful at adopting your new identity, a complete immersion is necessary. That includes being called Alfonse by everyone, including myself, until your mission is over.” Dumbledore explained.</p><p>“I suppose I have no choice in this.” Alfonse said bitterly.</p><p>“It really is for the best.” Dumbledore said, the twinkle in his eye undiminished.</p><p>“And, I suppose I must now alter all my clothing for this hare-brained scheme of yours, then, Professor?” Severus said, with particular emphasis on professor.</p><p>“Of course not, my dear boy! I’ve purchased all the supplies you will need to succeed for the duration of your mission.” Dumbledore smiled benignly, and continued “Now why don’t you and Minerva head over to Gryffindor Tower and get introductions out of the way before you lock yourself in your quarters for the night.”</p><p>“Right. Come along Sev-Mr. Hopkirk.” Minerva said briskly, turning to walk out of Albus’s office.</p><p>Severus paused, staring blankly at the wall for a moment, before turning to follow Minerva. Or, rather, Professor McGonagall, he mentally corrected himself, because he knew, even if he didn’t want to admit it, that Dumbledore was right about the need for immersion.</p>
<hr/><p>Minerva strode with purpose down the corridor leading to the Gryffindor Common room, her colleague-turned-student trailing behind her. They had started out in line with each other, but after several unfortunate incidences of Severus– Alfonse– Mr. Hopkirk– tripping over legs that were the wrong length, Mr. Hopkirk began walking behind her.</p><p>When Minerva tried to pause long enough for him to catch up to her, he slowed down enough to allow her to take the lead again. Minerva supposed that he was simply embarrassed to be suddenly incapable of something as simple as walking without tripping, and allowed the distance to remain.</p><p>Before too long, they arrived at the portrait of the Fat Lady. The Fat Lady had been disappointedly inspecting the completely, and stubbornly, intact wineglass that she had been attempting to shatter with her voice, but when she caught sight of Minerva leading an unknown student down her hallway, she immediately perked up.</p><p>The Fat Lady opened her mouth, but before she could get any words out, Minerva cut her off with the password, “Salve”.</p><p>Minerva simply did not have the time or patience to explain the situation to the portrait, when the Fat Lady could simply wait to get the gossip from one of the students trying to curry favor after getting in after curfew.</p><p>As Minerva entered through the portrait hole, she brushed off any guilt that she may have felt at being so brusque with the portrait. She was, after all, in quite a hurry, and in no mood to stand around gossiping.</p><p>Mr. Hopkirk was still trailing behind her as they crossed the common room, comfortingly decorated in reds and golds and packed with students all dressed in the same, to stand in front of the merrily dancing fire.</p><p>The volume level in the common room had been nearly deafening when Minerva had first entered the room, but by the time she turned to face the common room, Mr. Hopkirk off to her side, it was nearly silent.</p><p>She had a quick recollection of the first time she came into the common room as Head of House. Almost nobody had stopped talking, and the noise level had seemed to crescendo. It had taken years before her reputation was substantial enough to produce the effect that she now enjoyed.</p><p>Minerva raised her hand, silencing the remainder of the students who had been talking, and began to speak.</p><p>“I have a quick announcement that is no less important for its brevity. There is a new student,” here she gestured to the man-turned-boy standing to her side. She continued, “named Alfonse Hopkirk. He transferred here from the United States and will be joining our sixth years in their dormitory tomorrow. Any other questions should be directed at Alfonse himself tomorrow. For tonight, your curiosity will have to keep.” Minerva concluded.</p><p>At this, the common room erupted into noise, and Minerva grimly ushered Alfonse out of the room. Really, she should have known better than to bring him all the way into the room for the announcement.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she agreed with Albus’s decision to announce Alfonse the night before he joined the general population. Albus had said it would allow the students to get used to the idea without harassing Alfonse, but it would probably make things worse the next morning by forcing them to delay their curiosity.</p><p>They hurried through the portrait hole. About halfway down the corridor, Minerva turned into an empty classroom, gesturing behind her for Sev-Mr. Hopkirk to follow.</p><p>As soon as he closed the door behind him, Minerva set a variety of privacy wards, not trusting her lions in the slightest, despite the departure of the twins Weasley. She thanked anyone who might be listening for that small blessing, as she always did when she remembered that the twins were now gone for good.</p><p>“Alright Mr. Hopkirk, that went decently well. My lions will be inclined to be friendly, at least until the mystery surrounding you is resolved. Their continued friendliness is dependent on your response to them.” Minerva said sternly and with little hope that he would even attempt to be friendly back.</p><p>Minerva looked Mr. Hopkirk up and down. The transfiguration Dumbledore had applied to Alfonse’s robes was wearing off, and they were beginning to look like Severus’s trademark black robes again.</p><p>Mr. Hopkirk saw Minerva inspecting him, and looked down to examine himself. He obviously saw the state of his robes, smoothed them down as if trying to remove lint that was not there, and said, “I suppose that this is my cue to head back to my quarters and inspect the supplies Albus has provided.” He looked longingly over his shoulder at the door.</p><p>It was quite clear to Minerva that the poor boy just wanted to be alone, so she gestured for him to precede her in exiting the empty classroom. As Mr. Hopkirk went right towards the dungeons, and Minerva went left towards her quarters, she mused that this would be quite the semester, and it was only the first Friday of classes.</p>
