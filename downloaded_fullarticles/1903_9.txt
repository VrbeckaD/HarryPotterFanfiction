  <strong>One: The Black Hart</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>September 28, 2011, BAU Roundtable Room, Quantico, Virginia</em>
</p><p>“What do you have for us Garcia?”  Supervisory Special Agent and Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner asked the team’s technical analyst-slash-communications/media agent as everyone gathered in the roundtable room after welcoming Prentiss back officially.  Though everyone was ecstatic to have her home and moreover alive, there was a distinct <em>chill</em> between their polymath and genius Dr. Spencer Reid and several of the others, most notably JJ, who he seemed to blame even more than Hotch despite it having ultimately been the SSA’s call to put Agent Emily Prentiss in hiding to protect her from her now-deceased attacker terrorist Ian Doyle.</p><p>The bubbly blonde analyst popped up from her seat between her best friend and chocolate god of love Supervisory Special Agent Derek Morgan and the new “rookie” profiler on the team Special Agent Jennifer “JJ” Jareau who was their former communications agent and media liaison before her promotion to profiler and special agent to give the rundown on the current case that had been flagged for the BAU team.</p><p>Clicking on the television monitor they used most often for briefings at the rear of the room Penelope began as the agents including the newly “undead” Special Agent Emily Prentiss and SSA Dave Rossi to round out the full team.</p><p>“Loraine Howard, 33, professor of English.”  Garcia rattled off, clicking madly to bring up more and more pictures.  “Murdered a week ago at approximately four a.m. on the 21<sup>st</sup>, her body was found in a dumpster in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle.”</p><p>“The ante- and post-mortem stab wounds are excessive.”  Spencer noted with a frown as he studied the autopsy report.  “Seventy-seven altogether clustered over the upper torso and genitalia.”</p><p>“That’s a lot of rage.”  Prentiss said, half to herself and half to the team.  “That’s not just excessive it’s massive overkill.”</p><p>“The coroner reported that she was dead within the first five or six blows but can’t pinpoint it any further than that.”  Garcia told them.  “That’s not the bad part.”</p><p>The team continued to flip through the files, quickly understanding what she meant.</p><p>They weren’t so thick because of an orgy of evidence.</p><p>They were thick because they encompassed over a dozen confirmed and/or possible victims that partially matched the same modus operandi as whoever killed Loraine Howard.</p><p>Rossi did a quick count.</p><p>“Four definite and multiple possibles.”  His tone was incredulous.  “How did no one notice this earlier and call us in?”</p><p>“That’s the bad part.”  Garcia hit another button and had another twenty pictures flying onto the screen surrounding a map with pinpoints for each one.  “None of them occurred in the same city within less than three months until Loraine.  June 24<sup>th</sup> Theresa Sokolovsky, 26, was raped and murdered with multiple stab wounds including the same clusters and overkill present in Loraine’s murder, again in the Seattle area, this time her body was found in the nearby city of Kent.”</p><p>“If it wasn’t for the distinctive clusters, no one would have noticed or connected the two with the different police forces involved.”  Morgan said, eyes dark as he saw autopsy picture after autopsy picture of women who somewhat matched.  “What were the search markers Seattle PD used to put this together?”</p><p>“They stuck with the West Coast: female, stabbed and raped or with similar mutilation, mid-twenties to early thirties.  That gave us,” Garcia highlighted the corresponding pictures.  “Jessica Santos, 24, of Los Angeles, raped and stabbed October 22, 2010, body dumped in an upper middle-class neighborhood of LA.”  She reported, shoulders slumping a bit.  “I expanded the net and found some others: all female, all in the right age group with similar wound clusters, then excluding the sex gave me the three males, one of which was a domestic abuse gone off the rails and the other two showing significantly escalated mutilation from what was found on the females.  But right age and similar wounds.”</p><p>“It’s more than that.”  Hotch frowned, flipping between many of the pictures.  “If some of these are excluded by evidence similar to the one male, then there’s a dozen young professionals of similar age.”</p><p>“All very attractive, more so than the norm even in a place like Los Angeles.”  Spencer mused, cocking his head a bit.  “And physically fit.  None would be easy to attack.”</p><p>“It’s more than that.”  Rossi cursed in Italian.  “The crimes span the country but long hair, similar age, successful.”</p><p>“No kids.”  Prentiss added.</p><p>“And in committed relationships according to the police notes.”  JJ sighed, eyes sad.  “I can’t believe this has been going on more than a year and we’re just now catching it with such similar victimology.”</p><p>“It’s not unusual.”  Hotch told them – well, more reminded them.  “Preliminary overview shows that these crimes were spread out not just in vicinity but also time until recently.  If he hadn’t returned so soon to Seattle it could’ve gone on indefinitely until the connection was made.”  He scowled.  “He’s escalating.”  Climbing to his feet, he gathered up his files.  “Wheels up at 0800.  Let’s make sure he doesn’t get to add another picture to that map.”</p><p>…</p><p>Hotch walked through the front-door of his quiet home in a simple middle-class neighborhood, already braced for the rocketing form of his soon-to-be six-year-old son Jack to slam into his legs as was their routine.</p><p>Just that quickly, as he stepped over the threshold of the three-bedroom home, Hotch turned off and Aaron who was a single-father trying to raise his son in the wake of his ex-wife’s murder flipped on, Aaron setting aside his briefcase and hefting Jack up onto his hip.</p><p>“Daddy!”  Jack cheered, ecstatic as always to see his father come home before he went to bed.</p><p>“Hey buddy.”  Aaron gave his son a smacking kiss on the cheek before setting him back down and grabbing his case – with the contents, locked or not, it was going straight into his home office – held out his hand for Jack to walk with him back towards the den that Derek had helped him convert when he decided to move out of the tiny apartment he’d moved into following the divorce and hire live-in help rather than have Jack shuffled between Aaron and his aunt Jessica – his ex-wife Haley’s sister – who had offered to take over his care.  “What did you do today?”</p><p>As Jack burbled along like spring water over rocks, Aaron nodded at the motherly older woman who hadn’t been frightened of the circumstances that provoked her hire – namely the murder of his ex-wife by a serial killer Aaron had been hunting – and had also passed Aaron’s rigorous background investigation.</p><p>Sally Mayfield was in her mid-sixties, grey-haired, and as no-nonsense as Virginia bedrock and just as reliable.</p><p>A widow with no children, all Sally required as an “extra” for the sometimes round-the-clock care she provided Aaron’s son was two-weeks off in December and April to visit family, a request Aaron was more than happy to oblige considering that she took total care of the house and was Jack’s main caregiver at times due to Aaron’s high-stress and high-demand vocation.</p><p>Sally gave a small smile and nod back to her visibly-tired employer who had the grim-but-hidden-from-his-son lines bracketing his mouth that spoke of a bad case.</p><p>Not that any case Mr. Hotchner worked was <em>good</em> by any means.</p><p>But over the time Sally had worked for and with the pair of Hotchners, she’d come to recognize the signs of a case that would have him disappearing sometimes for a week or more and returning with bruises under his eyes, hollow-cheeked, and world-weary.</p><p>“I’ll put dinner on, Mr. Hotchner.”  Sally told him.  “Mac-and-cheese.”</p><p>“Mac-and-cheese!”  Jack broke off his recitation of his spelling words they’d worked on at school to cheer over the treat, one of his favorites.</p><p>“Thank you, Sally.”  Aaron told her with a quiet sigh of gratitude as Jack towed him towards his office to set aside his case and then to his bedroom to change, Jack going a mile a minute the entire time.</p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>Seattle, Washington, The Next Day</em>
</p><p>“Have any further connections between the two local victims been found?”  Morgan asked after the round of cursory introductions had been performed between the team – all save Garcia who was back home in her office at Quantico – and the local police.</p><p>“Nothing.”  The lead detective, one Jason Thorston told them, arms crossed over his chest as he glared at the board with the current known information pinned up on each woman.  “Theresa was late twenties, Loraine early thirties.  Both professionals: a management analyst and a professor.  Theresa was married, Loraine engaged.  Blonde hair just passed her shoulders, dark brown to mid-back.”  He flicked a finger at one of the pictures.  “Honestly, if it wasn’t for the wound patterns, there’s no way we would’ve considered them connected especially with Theresa’s rape.”</p><p>“That’s not surprising.”  Reid told them in his calm, meticulous manner.  “Mrs. Sokolovsky was the last victim we’ve identified to have been raped out of all the potential victims of this unsub from across the country.  It’s possible that his failure to perform with the more recent victims is one of the triggers behind his escalating brutality.”</p><p>“What about places they visited, local coffee shops, hair dressers, anything?”  Prentiss prompted as the team looked through the police notes that hadn’t been digitized or forwarded to Quantico as well as the physical evidence such as Theresa’s journal.</p><p>“Coffee shops would be a dead-end.”  The lead from the Kent police snorted with a roll of expressive brown eyes.  “This is the home of Starbucks.  There’s a shop or café on every block.  Aside from that no, nothing that stands out.  Seattle’s a major city for all that it’s not as large as LA or New York.  When you add in the rest of the metroplex?  Bellevue, Kent, Renton, the islands?  Theresa and Loraine could’ve both lived here all their lives and never crossed paths once.”</p><p>“We know this unsub is traveling.”  Hotch reasoned.  “That shows intelligence.  He stayed undetected this long by spacing his kills by both distance and time.  Morgan,” Hotch’s deep brown eyes flicked over to Garcia’s best friend.  “Call Garcia.  See if she can pick up any further patterns from the kills.”  He scowled down at the smiling picture of Mrs. Sokolovsky.  “Then take Reid and interview the significant others.  See if there’s anything they forgot to mention or didn’t think applicable.  JJ, Rossi, the dump sites.  Prentiss and I will continue combing through the physical evidence to see if anything stands out.  We know his type but we don’t know how or why he’s choosing them, figuring that out is going to be key to finding this unsub.”</p><p>“We’re not even one hundred percent on his type yet.”  JJ murmured to Rossi as they broke up for their assignments.  “We still don’t know if the male victims are his or if the stab wounds are a coincidence.”</p><p>“What do your instincts tell you?”  Rossi arched a dark brow at the young profiler, who sighed as she climbed into the passenger seat of their SUV to battle Seattle’s traffic to get to Queen Anne, the closer of the two dump sites.</p><p>JJ nodded her head to the side.</p><p>“That he’s not going to stop.”  She said.  “And that at least some of those potentials Garcia flagged are going to be added to this one’s tally before we’re done.”</p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>Howard Condo, Queen Anne, Seattle</em>
</p><p>“Mr. Johnson, I know this is difficult.”  Reid began coaching the grieving fiancé of Loraine Howard, one Derek Johnson, high school counselor at a Christian private school, age thirty-four, through the days leading up to his fiancé’s attack and murder.  “Going through all of this again, but anything you can tell us about the day-of and the days leading up to Ms. Howard’s death can help.”</p><p>“Even the smallest things,” Morgan added, his voice not as naturally soothing as Spencer’s but his face and eyes softer.  “Can lead to an arrest.”</p><p>As the red-eyed man picked his way through his last day with his fiancé with all the delicate precision of a bomb-tech navigating a mine field, Reid split his attention between the facial expressions, body language, and vocal inflections of the man, ruling him out easily within moments of being guilty of Loraine’s murder, whilst also cataloguing everything he could see of the open-plan condo from the magnificent view of the Space Needle from the picture window beside the balcony’s French doors to the requisite “couple’s” photo on the fireplace mantle.  Everything screamed happy, successful, upwardly-mobile couple.  No pets, no kids, nothing to distract them from their career ambitions and each other.</p><p>“We woke up at the normal time.”  Johnson got out in fits and starts, visibly gathering himself as he continued.  “Loraine didn’t have class but she likes…<em>liked</em>,” he caught himself with a hiccupping breath on the tense.  “Waking up with me anyway on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  It gave her time to get in a jog or a yoga routine and breakfast before heading to campus.  Had coffee, talked about our plans for the weekend: we were going to go to the ‘hawks game.”  Johnson buried his head in his hands to hide his sobs from the empathetic audience.  “Went to work.  Everything was normal.”</p><p>Until it wasn’t.</p><p>“What time would Ms. Howard have normally arrived home from campus?”  Reid asked by rote.</p><p>“Six-thirty.”  Johnson told him, scrubbing away his newest round of tears with the heel of his palms.  “Maybe seven at the latest if traffic was worse than normal or one of her students wanted a last-minute meeting.”</p><p>“When did you realize something was wrong?”  Morgan took over, Reid already aware that there were no out-of-the-norm traffic issues on the 27<sup>th</sup>, just the regular Seattle gridlock.</p><p>“Uh, about eight.”  Johnson told them after a long moment.  “She wasn’t picking up her cell – both our cars have hands-free units.  It just wasn’t like her to be that late and not have called.  Seattle,” his breath caught again but he continued on.  “Seattle isn’t as crime-heavy as LA or New York but it isn’t Utopia either.  Neither of us would worry the other like that.”</p><p>“And that’s when you called the college and found out she never arrived for her late-morning class.”  Reid led him a bit, Johnson nodding along.</p><p>“Classes run until almost ten at night.”  Johnson shrugged.  “I knew I could get someone at the security office to check on her.  But she wasn’t there.”</p><p>Morgan and Reid exchanged a look.</p><p>That meant Loraine was taken anytime between Johnson leaving for work at six – according to the police report Reid had memorized with his eidetic memory – and missing her first class at eleven.  A five-hour window to take her, giving the unsub anywhere from seven to fourteen hours before anyone was even aware she was gone, and her body wasn’t found until the next day.  It took less than twenty-four hours for the unsub to kidnap, mutilate, kill, and dump Loraine Howard.  Given the time of death, but the time anyone knew she was missing…she was already dead.</p><p>Derek gave an internal grimace.</p><p>Heaven save him from intelligent unsubs.</p><p>“What about the days leading up to that Thursday?”  Reid asked.  “Did Loraine take a new class at the gym, see a new stylist at the salon, go out with friends, anything?”</p><p>Johnson shifted and the two agents perked up, nearly coming up on point.</p><p>“There was, well.”  Johnson grimaced, rubbing the back of his neck.  “There was one thing.  I didn’t want to mention it before.  These things have a way of getting out and I didn’t want anyone <em>talking</em> about Loraine like that.  Let alone what it could do to my career if people make certain assumptions.”</p><p>“What, what happened?”  Reid urged, neurons firing as Derek got that <em>intensely intent</em> look that said he <em>knew</em> whatever was coming next was big.</p><p>“There’s this club.”  Johnson heaved a hapless breath.  “We’re not members or anything but Loraine’s sister and her husband are and they got us a guest pass as an engagement present.”</p><p>“What kind of club?”  Morgan prompted when Johnson faltered.</p><p>“The kind you don’t talk about in polite company.”  Johnson said with no little amount of exasperated bravado.  “<em>That</em> kind.”</p><p>“Sex, BDSM, what?”  Morgan continued, not letting this go.  He knew this was something that could’ve helped the SPD a week ago if Johnson had just <em>said something</em> and damned his reputation.</p><p>Unfortunately, as Derek and Spencer both knew all too well, a person’s reputation often became something most friends and family members were near-rabid about protecting in the wake of a tragedy like a murder.</p><p>“All of that and more.”  Johnson grimaced, clearly still uncomfortable with it even more than a week later.  “It’s called <em>The Black Hart</em>.  Members and guests only, <em>extremely</em> exclusive.  The sort of place where anything goes.  It was too much for us, even with the excellent food and drinks, the great dance floor, the rest of it was way too edgy, even with the discretion and non-disclosure agreements you have to sign to get inside.”</p><p>“Sounds like they take their customers’ privacy seriously.”  Reid noted, something about the name niggling at him but the connection wasn’t quite <em>there</em> yet.</p><p>“I wouldn’t know.”  Johnson shrugged, even as his grief crashed back down and bowed his shoulders.  “Like I said: too much for us.  We stayed all of an hour before taking off with no intention of applying for membership or ever going back.  Now I wish we never went in the first place, Susan’s upset feelings be damned.”</p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>Seattle Police Department Headquarters, That Night</em>
</p><p>“What have we got?”  Hotch asked after a long day of interviews, site inspections, and trolling through the physical evidence of two vicious murders.</p><p>“Ms. Howard’s fiancé mentioned going to a new club eight days before she went missing.”  Reid began.  “Morgan asked Garcia to look into any club activity in the victims’ finances.”</p><p>“And hit paydirt.”  Garcia piped up from where she was on-cam via laptop.  “Of our possible victims thirteen including Howard, Sokolovsky, and Santos visited nightclubs within a week to ten days before their deaths <em>or</em> had recurring membership fees being paid out to one or more.”</p><p>“Good.”  Hotch nodded, thinking furiously as he paced.  “But don’t exclude the others yet.  Have the detectives in the various cities check with the victims’ family and friends.  See if any of them went to nightclubs regularly or in the weeks immediately prior to their deaths.”</p><p>“There’s more.”  Morgan leaned forward, hands clasped before him.  “We checked with Theresa’s husband during the interview.  They were members at <em>Black Temptations</em>, a sister-club to <em>The Black Hart</em> where Loraine and her fiancé visited with a guest pass.”</p><p>“The Black Heart?”  JJ arched an unimpressed brow.  “That’s a little morbid isn’t it?”</p><p>“Hart as in a male deer, specifically a red deer stag over five years old.”  Reid corrected.  “From the Old English <em>Heorot</em>.  In literature a hart is usually a symbol of a quest.  In England during the middle ages and feudal period the hart was a "beast of venery" representing the most prestigious form of hunting, as distinct from lesser "beasts of the chase", and "beasts of warren", the last of which were regarded virtually as vermin.”</p><p>“Right.”  Garcia blinked then continued on.  “However, JJ was spot-on.  The same company that owns both <em>The Black Hart </em>and <em>Black Temptations</em> owns dozens of clubs all over the world.  All exclusive members-only places all owned by Potter-Black Consolidated headquartered in London.  The club Jessica Santos was a member of is called, surprise surprise, <em>The Black Doe</em>, one of four Potter-Black clubs of that name.”</p><p>“The unsub could be an employee or management.”  Prentiss nodded thoughtfully.  “A traveling dj or entertainer under contract, anything.”</p><p>“It’s the first solid connection between these crimes outside of the victims.”  Rossi noted.  “Garcia, did any of the identified victims visit or have memberships to the same club?”</p><p>“No.”  Garcia answered after a flurry of keys, shaking her head.  “Several were members or visited clubs of the same name but in different cities such as Josephine Boer of Chicago’s visit to that city’s version of the <em>Black Hart</em>, after which her body was found by a homeless man in an alley nine days later she’d been missing ten hours officially.”</p><p>“So this unsub sees his targets in the club.”  Rossi rattled off, talking it through.  “Or coming or going from it, picks them, and then learns their routines before snatching them when they’re alone with enough time to commit the crime and then dump the body before a real search has been started or the police have been alerted.”</p><p>“Garcia, did all of the victims have significant others that visited the clubs with them?”  Hotch asked on a hunch after reviewing the physical evidence from SPD.</p><p>“That would be a yes.”  Came the answer through the screen after more flurries of typing.  “Six husbands or domestic partners, three fiancés, and five boyfriends, all solid relationships from the reports the s.o.’s were eliminated from the suspect pool almost immediately, all wrecked with the victims’ deaths.”</p><p>“This is an enraged unsub, who covets what he doesn’t have.”  Hotch began, getting a clearer look at who they’re after with the peak into the victims’ lives provided by the evidence.  “Solid relationships between desirable, professional, successful people.”</p><p>“He’ll be in this same age group.”  Reid spoke up.  “He probably just disappears into the background, overlooked by the targets of his desires.”</p><p>“As his violence progressed the rapes weren’t enough anymore.”  Rossi said, shaking his head.  “It’s control and envy, he’s in crisis and it’s only going to get worse.”</p><p>Morgan stood and pointed to the timeline, circling something thanks to the information Garcia had sorted through.</p><p>“Here.”  He pointed to the picture of Ms. Boer as something clicked.  “Theresa was the last victim raped and if we exclude the victims who don’t have the nightclub connection, then it was a steady timeline.”</p><p>“Seven weeks between victims and no repeats on the cities.”  Reid saw it at once, eyes flicking over the pictures as his brain sped through information, processing it even faster than Garcia’s computer could manage.  “Something happened between Ms. Sokolovsky in Seattle and Ms. Boer in Chicago that sent him spiraling, a second trigger event.”</p><p>Nods abounded all around, JJ adding: “the rapes stop and the violence escalates.  It’s not enough anymore.”</p><p>“There’s thirty-seven days between those two murders.”  Reid did the math at the speed of light.  “Then twenty-one between Mrs. Boer in Chicago and Ms. Evanson in DC, nineteen between Ms. Evanson and Ms. Colbert in Baltimore, and twelve between Ms. Colbert and Loraine Howard.  If this pattern continues…”</p><p>“He could devolve into grabs every week or less.”  Morgan sighed rubbing his face.  “Which means we might have a new vic anytime.”</p><p>“And with no way to determine where.”  Rossi scowled.</p><p>“Actually.”  Reid frowned and cocked his head.  “If this is an unsub that pattern and order are important too which his original timeline suggests, then the next victim will be from the middle of the country, such as Ms. Bret from Detriot following Ms. Santos in LA and Mrs. Boer from Chicago following Ms. Sokolovsky.”</p><p>“Garcia, how many clubs does Potter-Black Consolidated own in the middle of the states?”  Hotch asked.</p><p>“Focus on what are normally considered the fly-over states, major cities from the Rocky Mountains to Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, and Alabama in the east.”  Reid added.</p><p>“Ok darlings that gives us,” Garcia tsked, shaking her head.  “<em>Le Coeur Noir </em>and <em>Leather and Lace</em> in New Orleans, <em>The White Lily </em>in Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, and Chicago, and <em>Black Sins</em> in Baton Rouge.”</p><p>“There’s no way to pin-point which club is next on the unsub’s list.”  Morgan said, groaning a bit in frustration.  “That’s seven clubs.”</p><p>“Then we need to warn them all.”  Hotch decided.  “And get the surveillance footage from the clubs that have already been identified.  Our unsub might be on those tapes.”</p><p>“Ah, that’s not going to be easy, bossman.”  Garcia hated to burst her bubble with what her research had discovered about Potter-Black Consolidated and their clubs.  “These clubs are extremely exclusive with their membership and take discretion and their member privacy very seriously.  From what I’ve found online there’s not even a peep floating around about what goes on in the clubs.”</p><p>“Mr. Johnson did say that <em>The Black Hart</em> had a reputation for discretion and that they had to sign non-disclosure agreements just as guests, let alone members.”  Reid pointed out.</p><p>“And he implied a whole lot more about what goes on in there.”  Morgan cocked a brow.  “They’re not going to want to give up those tapes.”</p><p>“We’ll still ask.”  Hotch ordered, raising his brows.  “Then when we’ll get a warrant.  I want those tapes before another woman is brutalized.  We’ll fly back to Quantico tonight.”</p><p>“Hotch-man?”  Morgan frowned.  They’d only been there a day.</p><p>“He’s done with Seattle for now.”  Hotch told them.  “We need to focus on getting that information from the nightclubs and interviewing the families.  We can do that better from Quantico than we can from here.  Don’t worry.”  His humor was nothing less than dark.  “If we don’t stop him,  we’ll be back here in a matter of weeks.”</p>
