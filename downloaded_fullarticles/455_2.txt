    <p>Cleaning Grimmauld place certainly wasn't going to be the easiest of tasks even with the Orders occasional help the darkness from dozens of past generations would be hard to erase.</p>
<p>Sirius had just finished cleaning the first-floor bedroom when the sound of someone coming through the floo caught his attention. Wiping the sweat of his brow Sirius headed to the fireplace and was greeted by Dumbledore, grief clear on the old wizards face.</p>
<p>Sirius' shoulders slumped "I' guessing this isn't a social call then" Albus smiled sadly as he took a seat on one of the old sofas by the floo, Sirius couldn't tell if the creek was from the sofa or the wizard.</p>
<p>"No my boy, I'm afraid not. I have come to ask of you a very difficult task"  Albus' voice held notes of obvious tension.</p>
<p>Sirius clicked his fingers and a small elf wearing a little white cloth that looked more like a dress popped into existence.</p>
<p>"How may Pinky be serving Master Sirius?"</p>
<p>"Some tea...and maybe firewhisky, thank you"</p>
<p>The older wizards eyes widened at the sight of pinky to which Sirius chuckled as she ran off to get his requests.</p>
<p>"Long story, simply put Kreacher is with Cissy now" Sirius's Smirk did not go unnoticed by Albus chose not to ask further. Sirius finally sat opposite Albus as Pinky came into the room a tray of tea and whisky floating beside her.</p>
<p>"Is Master Sirius needing more from Pinky?" the elf popped away with a single shake of Sirius' head.</p>
<p>"So, Albus. what about this 'task' " pouring himself and Albus a cup of tea from the steaming pot, adding a generous amount of liquor to his own. A small silence stretched between the two wizards as they both took the first sip of their respective cup.</p>
<p>Albus set his cup down as he focused on Sirius with a determined look.</p>
<p>"My boy, an accident has occurred during the last meeting of the Dark Lords inner circle." Albus glanced to the ground, his breath shaking as he tried to remain calm, Sirius didn't dare interrupt.</p>
<p>"Severus' cover was blown, we don't know how or by who as of yet. But Kingsly is working on finding out as we speak, Severus, however, is currently in the hospital wing at Hogwarts he-" Albus cut himself off as he downed the rest of his drink, Sirius wordlessly refiled it adding some firewhisky to help the old mans nerves.</p>
<p>"He was tortured, extensively, I don't know how he made it out alive if only just. So, Sirius, I ask of you a favour, Severus cannot return to his home in his current state nor can he stay at Hogwarts where the some of the older students are already on the Dark Lords Side if unofficially" Albus stared deep into Sirius' eyes his own blue orbs pleading.</p>
<p>"Severus must stay in Grimmauld Place, I wouldn' ask this if there was anywhere else he could be safe"</p>
<p>Sirius stared wide-eyed at his old headmaster, a thousand thoughts rushing through his head, Severus and himself had never gotten along, hell, they hated each other but something deep within him made him want to say yes, maybe the loneliness and the quiet of his childhood home was getting to him.</p>
<p>"Yeah, of course. He can stay here I'll-I'll look after him until he can do it himself."</p>
<p>Dumbledores smile didn't reassure him at all.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>                                                           ***<br/>
What Sirius wasn't expecting, was the body of the Severus Snape floating alongside Poppy Pomfrey as Dumbledore followed behind silently as they all walked up three flights of stairs to where Sirius own bedroom was.</p>
<p>Clearing his throat Sirius turned to the mediwitch "Uh, He can stay in Regulus' room. it's tidy enough" If the former black house-elf had anything to say about it.</p>
<p>"That will be fine I'm sure, he certainly won't be moving on his own for at least a short while" the air of clinical professionalism that always surrounded the mediwitch was tinged with sorrow, Albus still hadn't said anything and it was beginning to unnerve Sirius.</p>
<p>Peering into his younger brothers old room he found that it indeed was clean, freshly pressed sheets and not a spec of dust anywhere. Without a word Poppy set about getting the unconscious Slytherin settled without causing to much discomfort.</p>
<p>With a look of grim determination, Albus looked to Sirius "I will return to Hogwarts, I am meeting with Kingsly to discuss new information that has come to light. You will take good care of him Sirius" It wasn't a question.</p>
<p>"Yes, Headmaster" Sirius felt like a schoolboy once more, the tone of voice Albus used distinctly familiar.</p>
<p>With a final nod, Albus left, leaving Sirius to watch over a tutting mediwitch and her unconscious patient. Looking at him up close Sirius saw how thin Severus was, he always has been thin but now it was worryingly so.</p>
<p>"He should wake up in a few hours, he will be very disoriented and I suggest only feeding him light meals, for now, soup, plain toast, porridge the like now, here" Poppy handed a rather large and heavy bag over to Sirius who was still taking in Severus new appearance.</p>
<p>"Apply the blue salve every morning and give him the purple bottle every night before he sleeps it should help with the damage oh and this" Poppy placed a few smaller dark blue vials into the bag "Dreamless Sleep, I can't imagine anyone suffering what he has and not having nightmares" without waiting for a goodbye the mediwitch saw herself off.</p>
<p>"what have I gotten myself into"</p>
