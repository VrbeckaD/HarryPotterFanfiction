    <p>When Harry woke up in the morning he was happy. So happy, in fact, he was smiling which was a rare case when you were Harry Potter.<br/> <br/> <br/> Ginny would be coming back home today having graduated from Hogwarts. Finally, <em>finally,</em> he would have her. By his side. All the time.<br/> <br/> <br/> <em>Okay, maybe not all the time</em> he thought to himself. He still had his rather demanding job as an Auror and she, as a fresh Harpy player, would be busy with her training schedules and Quidditch matches. <em>But at least she won’t be tucked in heavily guarded castles.</em><br/> <br/> <br/> He kicked the sheets off of himself and went to the bathroom for a quick shower. When he was done he went down to the basement kitchen where he found Ron, already up and about, trying to prepare breakfast but failing spectacularly. They both had arranged their day offs for today specifically so that they could be the ones to went to King’s Cross and welcomed Ginny and Hermione back home before accompanying them to the Burrow; where Molly would throw a feast in honor of the girls’ graduation.<br/> <br/> <br/> Harry was quickly set up to help Ron with breakfast, tahe tapped his wand to the cattle and the water in it started boiling instantly. They joked and chatted aimlessly both were clearly in a good mood. Still, hours had rolled on painfully slow but then it was finally time and they were making their ways to the King’s Cross. When they arrived, they casually leaned on the wall between the platform 9 and 10 and within seconds they were on the familiar ground of 9 ¾. The platform was already swarming with people. Parents and friends were waiting for their loved ones to return but there was no sign of Hogwarts Express yet. Harry and Ron found themselves a rather secluded area while waiting for the girls, trying not to attract any more attention than they already had. Ron kept checking his watch while Harry surveying the area. He saw a few acquaintances from his year, none were close enough to share more than greeting nods and he suspected two people to be the photographers from Witch Weekly or some other rubbish magazine like that.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Almost there.” Ron mumbled more to himself than to Harry and indeed the unmistakable whistle of Hogwarts Express heard from afar soon afterwards.<br/> <br/> <br/> They had watched from their spot as the train had approached the station to straightened up as soon as it pulled in and stopped. The doors slide opened and a pack of students burst off from each door and in the blink of an eye people started hugging and kissing each other right and left, wherever they happened to find their relatives or friends. Harry craned his neck up trying to see behind people’s head, looking for a flaming red hair. It was as though she was illuminated with spotlights because the moment she stepped out of the train his eyes snapped towards her. She was wearing a red summer dress with white spots that ended above her knees and the hem of it was rippling through her legs with her each step. His mouth went dry, she was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Ginny was looking around like she was looking for someone and her eyes found his across the station in an instant. He was barely aware of Ron as he was off from his side running to a very bushy haired girl that had appeared right behind Ginny. Everything felt like in a blur, everything but her coming to him with fast strides. He must have been walking towards her as well because all of a sudden they met on the middle and she threw her arms to his neck while he lifted her from the ground burying his nose into her sweet smelling hair. They stayed like that for a while before she withdrew her head a little only to crush her mouth into his without caring that they were in a very public area or that someone probably took a picture of the two of them just now.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Hey.” she breathed out when they drew apart to breathe. Her lips were swollen.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Hi.” he said back feeling pretty much breathless himself. He became aware he was still holding Ginny up in his arms when they started protesting due to extra weight. He slid her down agonizingly slow pressing her body to his own on the process. She chuckled.<br/> <br/> <br/> “You will hike my skirt up and entire Britain will see my bum.”<br/> <br/> <br/> That reminded him.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Yeah, you look very nice.” He did a double take on her and his eyes stopped on her bare legs that were very much in the open, muscular yet creamy. He could see the freckles sprayed among them from where he stood and could not wait to get her alone so that he could count them all one by one before wrapping her legs on his - She cleared her throat putting an end to his daydream and he tore his eyes off of her legs realizing he had been looking rather intently.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Alden Clark.” she said smiling and then signed rather exasperatedly at his blank look. “New sponsor of the Harpies. All players are going to get dressed by this new shop on Diagon Alley now. They are sending their selected clothes every week. But you already know that because I have mentioned it in my recent letter.”<br/> <br/> <br/> He remembered something about a new sponsor and clothes vaguely. But had no idea it could be something like this.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Well, I don’t know much about clothes - nor cared to be honest.”<br/> <br/> <br/> “Right. You usually prefer me naked.” She winked and blood rushed through his body. He was about to tell her how he would prefer her now when a voice behind Ginny was heard.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Hey Harry.” They turned around to see a group of three people. All of them were Ginny’s friend from her year and from D.A. last year according to Ginny. Marcus Norwood, who had been the one called out to Harry, was a rather good looking Ravenclaw; a tall brunet with blue-grey eyes. Memphis Bloxham and Iris Blythe were both in Slytherins and both had been the spies for D.A. while Hogwarts had been under the reign of the Carrows. Bloxham was a well-built bloke with curly sand blonde hair and he seemed as though he was preferring to be anywhere else but here. Blythe was a rather plain girl but she had pretty shiny black hair and eyes were so light brown that they almost seemed like yellow.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Hey guys.” Harry greeted them. He had met them all last summer on D.A.’s exclusive <em>‘Thank You All/ We Survived/ Goodbye Summer’</em> party. They were engaged in a light conversation when Ron and Hermione joined the group and soon after two Weasleys plus Harry and Hermione excused themselves to get going to Burrow.<br/> <br/> <br/> *****<br/> <br/> <br/> The table was set up at the back garden. By the time it was time for dinner the Burrow was swarming with people as all of the Weasleys except Charlie, the Grangers, Teddy and Andromeda, and Harry were all present. Even Luna and Neville came for dinner after everyone had seated to the table. Bill quickly conjured new chairs for them. The food was delicious as always, Molly had made Ginny and Hermione’s favorites since this night meant celebration for the girls’ graduation.<br/> <br/> <br/> It was the absolute rave-up but still, most nights at the Burrow had always been. They ate and drank and joked until the wee hours of the night. Bill and Fleur had to leave first since their daughter, Victorie, was only a few months old. They were followed by Neville and Luna since Neville had come right after work at the Auror office and had been exhausted therefore and Luna had wanted to go back home early so that she could help her father with cleaning the Nargles up. The crowd thinned out like that quickly after, the Grangers left leaving Hermione behind since she had claimed that she wanted to spend a little more time with Ron, Harry, and Ginny. The four of them had washed the dishes quickly before they went to sit with Arthur, Molly, and Andromeda in the living room. Teddy was already fast asleep on the couch.<br/> <br/> <br/> “I can’t believe all our children are grown ups now. It was hard to imagine these days would ever come.” Molly was saying to her husband and Andromeda.<br/> <br/> <br/> “I told you we should have made more babies.” Arthur said to his wife lips twitching and a mischievous glint in his eyes. Ron and Ginny grimaced.<br/> <br/> <br/> Fifteen minutes had passed by Mr. Weasley asking about all the muggle paraphernalia that Andromeda was using in her house when Ron yawned exaggeratedly throwing his long arms above his head to stretch.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Well - it is getting late. I will drop Hermione home and go back to Grimmauld Place to catch up on my sleep.” But the telltale blushes on both of their faces told a different story about their exact plans.<br/> <br/> <br/> “I should get going as well. Teddy needs his rest.” Andromeda got up on her feet with Ron and Hermione.<br/> <br/> <br/> “I will accompany you, Andromeda.” Harry raised from where he was sitting next to Ginny.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Oh, Harry! You don’t have to.”<br/> <br/> <br/> “It’s okay. I want to tuck Teddy in his bed anyways.” He said to her while taking Teddy on his arms gently, trying not to wake the boy.<br/> <br/> <br/> Arthur, Molly, and Ginny saw them off to the front door of the Borrow from where they would be walking to the apparetion point. Ginny pressed a kiss on Harry’s cheek before whispering in his ear.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Meet me at the paddock when you are done.”<br/> <br/> <br/> *****<br/> <br/> <br/> He apparated at the paddock exactly half an hour later. Ginny was already there waiting for him. She had stripped from her Alden Clark clothes that tortured him all night and wrapped in her beloved Harpies tee-shirt and soft cotton shorts once again. Harry thought she was looking even more beautiful. Their eyes met and without talking, without taking their eyes off of each other they started to walk toward one another. She wrapped her arms around his neck and he was positively crushing her to him. After some time she retreated her arms and brought her hands to frame his face instead.<br/> <br/> <br/> “We did it.” she said to him smiling proudly. Her lovely brown eyes were very bright in the moonlight. He smiled back at her knowing what she meant immediately.<br/> <br/> <br/> “We did it.” After all these times they had to spend apart - first, the dreadful year when he had been on the hunt and next she had to go back to Hogwarts to complete her education, they were finally together. And this time, hopefully, not to get separated again.<br/> <br/> <br/> She raised on her tiptoes and pressed her lips to his kissing him slowly but between the two of them, things always tended to escalate quickly. The need for air started growing and when it became unbearable Harry tore his mouth off of hers.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Hang on.” He growled. Taking a deep breath to clear his mind he had tightened his hold around Ginny before appareting them both to her room upstairs. He was still trying to get rid of the unpleasant after-effects of appareting when he felt her pushing him towards the bed. His knees hit the mattress and he fell on his bum on her bed bouncing lightly. She helped him to get rid of his jumper before tossing it somewhere in the dark bedroom. Straddling his hips she took off her own tee-shirt with a swift move. His hands shot up to hold her in place as all his senses were filled by her; her smell, her feel, the sight of her above him.<br/> <br/> <br/> Ginny grabbed his hands on her waist and lifted them above his head pressing them onto the soft mattress. In the process, her torso came to lay upon his and she turned her head to press her lips on his neck.<br/> <br/> <br/> “It’s been so long.” She said voice muffled and he gasped when she bit his neck.<br/> <br/> <br/> Rescued his hands with little effort he flipped them on the small bed. They got rid of the remaining clothing on record time and without hesitation, he sank into her warmth as they both moaned.<br/> <br/> <br/> He tried to keep his eyes open against the pleasure he was feeling to watch her, wanting to see her face as he kept plunging into her steadily. Red hair spread messily on her pillow, a flush was rising from her neck to her cheeks, and her mouth opened with that perfect circular shape letting small mewling sounds. He brought one hand to cup her cheek.<br/> <br/> <br/> “I love you.” The words still foreign on his tongue slipped out without thinking coming straight from his heart. She opened her heavily lidded eyes.<br/> <br/> <br/> “I love you.” She moaned back to him. His thump started tracing the shape of her lips… and all coherent thoughts left his mind as Ginny opened her mouth to take his thumb in, sucking and teasing with her tongue. He fastened their rhythm as she started to suck harder.<br/> <br/> <br/> *****<br/> <br/> <br/> The next morning Harry and Ron went back to Burrow for breakfast. Ron kept grumbling unhappily since Hermione said that she would come later wanting to have breakfast with her family instead. However, Ron’s sour mood improved significantly when they entered the house and he inhaled the delicious smells coming from the kitchen. He practically sprinted to find the source while Harry stayed behind having seen Ginny coming down the stairs.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Morning.” He greeted her while holding up his arm ushering her towards him. She melted into his arms easily.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Morning to yourself.” Her eyes lighted up with mischief “You look like you haven’t slept much.”<br/> <br/> <br/> “What can I say my girlfriend would not let me sleep much.”<br/> <br/> <br/> “Hmm.. better not let her see you like this then.” She mumbled before pressing her lips to his. He tilted his head to give her a better access. His insides were full of joy. He could easily get addicted to the morning kisses from Ginny.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Oi Gin- <em>Gah!</em>” They split apart reluctantly when Ron came bustling in a copy of Daily Prophet hanging off of his hand “I definitely did not miss seeing that!”<br/> <br/> <br/> “What is it Ron?” Ginny signed as Ron was making gagging sounds.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Oh yeah! Check this out - you are on the papers!” he held the paper up onto their faces having remembered why he came into the room in the first place and they saw two moving pictures standing side by side under the headline of ‘The Boy Who Loved’. The first one was the two of them kissing passionately on the station yesterday as Harry hold Ginny up in his arms. The other had Ginny alone showing what she was wearing from a perfect angle.<br/> <br/> <br/> “They mentioned your clothes.” Ron pointed to the small article standing next to the second picture.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Oh! That’s great!” she exclaimed ripping the newspaper from Ron’s grip and started reading. “They mentioned I was wearing Alden Clark’s new session ropes specifically.” She said grinning.<br/> <br/> <br/> “I saw a few Harpies’ showing their clothes off as well. They were on the next page.”<br/> <br/> <br/> They sat down to eat as Ginny continued reading other daily news. Mr. Weasley started talking about new Ministry laws as Mrs. Weasley was making sure everyone had enough food on their plates. When the breakfast was over Mr. Weasley went to upstairs to get his bag as Mrs. Weasley started tidying up the table. Ginny was waiting with Harry and Ron by the fireplace for Mr. Weasley to come back down so that she could see them off to work. They were in the middle of making plans for the evening when an owl came soaring down from the open window. She dropped a red envelope on Ginny’s feet and went back through the same way without stopping.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Is that a howler?” Ron asked incredulously and they all bent down slightly to investigate without touching the envelope.<br/> <br/> <br/> “No – I don’t think so. It' not smoking.” Ginny gave the letter a little nudge with her foot.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Yeah, I think it is just the color of the envelope.” Harry said but still took his wand off and cast various spells on the letter checking for any nasty spells.<br/> <br/> <br/> “It seemed safe.” He took the envelope off the ground and gave it to Ginny. She tore it open and took out the letter inside. She read it quickly eyebrows raising.<br/> <br/> <br/> “What is it?” asked Ron.<br/> <br/> <br/> “Compliment on my outfit yesterday, I guess? It’s the signature that got me a bit off guard.” She passed the letter to Ron who took it immediately. Harry bent his head down to read what was written alongside Ron.<br/> <br/> <br/> You seemed gorgeous with that dress.<br/> <em>-Limerence.</em></p>
