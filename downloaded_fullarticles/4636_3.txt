  <i>Tick, tick, tick, tick.</i>
</p><p>The clock on the Minister’s bookshelf provides Draco with an anchor to reality as the world spins dangerously around him.  He focuses on the sound of it, even as the Minister clears his throat and Potter shifts next to him.  And he waits. </p><p>And waits.</p><p>For surely Potter is going to object to this any second now, and because he’s the sodding Boy Who Lived, the Minister will glance down at his paperwork and realise there’d been a mistake. Robards’ face will clear with sudden understanding, and he’ll nod to Shacklebolt, who will pick up his quill, and strike Draco’s name as one of the Aurors from the casefile.  Probably Potter’s, too, because it <i>must</i> be a mistake.  There was no way in hell Potter would ever agree to— to—</p><p>
  <i>Tick, tick, tick</i>
</p><p>“When are we leaving?” Potter asks.</p><p>Draco rounds on him, gaping.  “We are <i>not</i> leaving!” he hisses. Potter raises his brows, and Draco draws back. He attempts to modulate his voice into something resembling professional, and forces a smile. “I just mean, there’s obviously been a mistake. Isn’t that right, Minister?”</p><p>Shacklebolt, damn him, has the audacity to look amused.  His lips twitch, and he rubs at his chin thoughtfully with his knuckle. “I’m afraid it isn’t, Auror Malfoy. Do you have an official objection you’d like to raise about being placed on this assignment?”</p><p>Draco thinks quickly. “I have a Dark Mark. Surely that will blow our cover. Everyone else with one is in Azkaban; people will know it’s me.”</p><p>“On the contrary,” Shacklebolt says smoothly. His mouth twitches again. “The Unspeakables have offered to Glamour both of you for the duration of the assignment. Their identity disillusionment charms are the most durable, so though you’ll be able to recognise one another as you are, any primary identifying features you have will be unrecognisable to the world around you. Your Mark, Malfoy--Harry’s scar. For that matter, your faces will be subtly different, as well as your hair colours. It’s not unlike Polyjuice, really, except that it lasts until the spell is broken, and your body is physically unaffected. It’s quite strong. You won’t even be able to see yourselves as you are in the mirror.”</p><p>“But— But.” Draco looks at Potter, who examines his fingernails as though they're remotely interesting.  His mouth, too, is twitching.  Fuck. “I have very fair skin,” he says lamely.</p><p>Potter snorts, then tries to pretend he’d been coughing.  Draco glares at him -- a fruitless gesture, because Potter doesn’t bother to look up.</p><p>Robards makes a coughing noise as well, and Draco whips his glare to around. “Obviously there’s some sort of illness going around,” he says icily. “So, of course, you should find different Aurors to fulfil the requirements of this job.”</p><p>“Just a tickle in my throat,” Robards assures him, clearing it.  He sighs, amusement fading.  “We need the two of you, Malfoy. Your Dark Mark may be useful. I’m told it still responds when near heightened levels of Dark Magic?”</p><p>Draco shifts uncomfortably, frowning.  “Respond isn’t the right term. It— There’s sensation, there. Even occasionally for strong magic in general.”</p><p>“Really?” Potter asks curiously, finally turning to him. He glances at Draco’s forearm, covered by his robes. “You never mentioned that, Malfoy.”</p><p>“I never had a reason to,” Draco says, stiffening. As if Potter is one to talk about not sharing personal information. “We go usually into jobs knowing what we’re looking for.”</p><p>“Right, no, I just—” Potter looks at him with consternation, then shakes his head and drops the line of enquiry at whatever he sees on Draco’s face, tone turning brisk. “But you can differentiate whether the magic is Dark or not?”</p><p>Draco nods, concealing a grimace.</p><p>“Well, the artefact being moved may radiate high-concentration levels of Dark Magic, if our intel is correct," Robards continues after a beat of silence. “We need your Mark, as well as your investigative skills.  We can’t just send Aurors around to cast revealing charms at a well-populated muggle resort; it’s too risky when dealing with Dark artefacts.”</p><p>“A muggle <i>nudist</i> resort,” Draco mutters unhappily, bringing it back to the real point. </p><p>“Well, yes. Exactly,” Shacklebolt says, apparently pleased that Draco understands. Draco rolls his eyes.  “And you won’t be alone -- we have a team of Aurors on-site already. They’re on another case, which we <i>think</i> is unrelated, although we need to be alerted about any potential connections. Anyhow, they’ll be able to take over the investigation at night and give aid if needed.”</p><p>“What about a magical empath?” Draco says. “Surely, we must have one on staff here, or be able to find someone to accompany—”</p><p>Shacklebolt’s nostrils flare and it looks like he’s trying hard not to chuckle again.  “Do you really have no concept of how rare that ability is? If we knew of anyone living in Britain able to look at someone or something and sense its inherent magical capabilities, we’d be paying them half our budget.”</p><p>Draco sags, defeated. He wants to wipe the scowl off his face, but that’s really hard to do when Potter is nudging his arm with all the enthusiasm of an untrained Crup.</p><p>“C’mon, Malfoy,” Potter says, grinning. “Sunshine, swimming, hot springs — it’s basically a free vacation at an all-inclusive resort where we get to catch a Dark wizard. Sounds like fun.”</p><p>“It sounds <i>naked</i> to me,” Draco says.  Potter laughs. </p><p>“Well, that too. But if you’ve never had fun naked then I think you may be doing it wr—” Potter breaks off, flushing. He slides a guilty glance over to Shacklebolt, who is wisely pretending to read some parchment. Draco feels the urge to hex the Minister’s mouth into immobility; damn it, this isn’t funny. Robards doesn’t even bother hiding his amusement, leaning back in his chair with a wide smile. Potter shakes his head a little. “Anyway.  Maybe we’ll find the guy on the first day.”</p><p>“Entirely possible,” Shacklebolt says, looking up, "though not entirely likely, considering the size of the resort. It’s rather large, and our intelligence claims that the wizard in question is taking his time meeting with potential buyers to move the object.”</p><p>Draco latches onto that desperately.  “Why can’t we pose as those?”</p><p>There’s a pause. “Do you think he hasn’t picked his location deliberately?. The lack of dress makes it easier to discern a lack of threat,” Robards says. “It’s one of the reasons it’s so important we have both you and Harry on the case. Besides, we’ve set it up so that you can segue into acting as potential buyers if and when the need arises.”</p><p>“Why is it so important for it to be Potter and me?” Draco asks once more, mind catching on it. He flushes. “A lot of people have magic that — works well together.”</p><p>A scowl flickers over Potter's face scowls before his expression grows bland.  “They want me for my wandless magic,” he says simply, a muscle in his jaw ticking.</p><p>“Ah.” Draco gazes at him for a moment, unable to think of anything else to say. He’s never been able to figure out why Potter is so touchy about having such an exorbitant amount of power at his fingertips. When asked, Potter brushes off the question as though he would a fly buzzing about his ear.</p><p>Potter looks down at his nails again and Draco tries to think of something to say that will diffuse the sudden tension in the room. Then the rest of the implication of Potter’s statement hits him, clicking in his head like the tumblers in a lock.</p><p>“Wait a minute!” he blurts.  “Where am I supposed to hide <i>my</i> wand?”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>The heat is oppressive – thick and muggy. Sweat beads on Draco’s skin as he and Potter trudge up the narrow dirt road, and he longs to cast a freshening charm, but the giant lodge of the resort has come into view as they crest the small hill, and he daren’t risk it. They can’t even Apparate for fear that people behind them may notice.<p>He hates not being able to do magic.</p><p>“Merlin, Potter,” he mutters. “I don’t know how you stood it, growing up.”</p><p>Potter huffs a small laugh.  “You act like the muggle world is constantly in the middle of a heatwave or something.”</p><p>That isn’t what he’d meant and is about to say so, but Potter’s gestures subtly at him and Draco’s skin turns cool and dry, just like that — though moisture immediately collects above his upper lip, and he can feel it prickle across the small of his back as soon as Potter drops his hand. He sighs.</p><p>“And stop calling me Potter,” Potter reminds him.  “If I have to carry your bags for you, you could at least show me the decency of calling me Harry. Plus,” he points out, grinning, “we’re supposed to be in love.”</p><p>Draco rolls his eyes but doesn’t bother to hide the smirk that pulls at his mouth as he watches Potter fumble with both bags again. The contents have been shrunken and the bags charmed to decrease the weight, but they are rather bulky. Something petty in Draco appreciates the fact that Potter is struggling so hard, particularly after <i>Potter</i> won the argument about getting to keep <i>his</i> first name while Draco had to change his.</p><p>“At least they require clothing for mealtimes,” Draco says. He takes a deep breath and lets it out. “<i>Harry.</i>”</p><p>Potter’s startled gaze slides to his. Draco lets his his own get caught for a moment before glancing elsewhere; it’s just that green is his favourite colour and always had been. There is nothing significant at all about the way his cheeks get warmer — it's obviously because of the stupid weather and the mile-long walk from the road.</p><p>“Draco,” Potter returns, voice lower. Draco pauses and it takes a moment for him to notice that Potter has called him by the wrong name. He hasn’t heard that tone in Potter’s voice since the night they’d almost— </p><p>“That’s just one dining room,” Potter says after a moment. </p><p>“Well, it’s the one we’ll be using,” Draco says, wrinkling his nose. “Watching people eat in the nude – that can’t be appetising.”</p><p>“I don’t know, maybe. Guess it depends on who you’re looking at,” Potter murmurs. Draco flicks a sharp glance to him; Potter's cheeks are slightly pink too, and his eyes are on Draco’s mouth.</p><p>Draco’s heart skips.</p><p>He halts on the dusty path, satisfied at Potter's stumble when he follows suit.</p><p>“Yes, I look very nice naked,” Draco says, glad to have a reason to confront it. “I’m sure you do, too.  We’re two gay men who will be naked frequently around each other and we almost shagged once and decided not to ruin our working relationship. Is this going to be a problem, <i>Harry?</i>”</p><p>The arsehole doesn’t look remotely abashed or intimidated by his little speech — which has taken no small amount of nerve to say (and is something he may have practiced more than once), if Draco is being honest. Draco wants to throttle him where they stand.</p><p>“Literally nothing you just said is a problem for me, Draco,” Potter says somberly, though his eyes are dancing with mirth Draco scowls at him to get his point across.</p><p>“Then stop flirting with me.” He starts walking again.</p><p>“<i>That</i> might be a problem,” Potter says. He snickers and rolls his eyes when Draco throws him an outraged look. “Come on, lighten up a little.”</p><p>“I think you’re light enough for the both of us,” Draco mutters, every fibre of his body pulsing with resentment as they climb the steps that lead into the lodge. “We’re here to work, not play.”</p><p>“Work can be fun,” Potter says encouragingly. He hesitates and something in his face falters with a flash of discontent, but then his smiles returns and Draco dismisses it as an anomoly.</p><p>“You’ve never had to work with <i>you,</i>” Draco scoffs, but he knows Potter can tell he’s trying to fight a smile by the way he elbows him in the ribcage before sliding an arm around his waist as they approach the front desk.</p><p>“Hi, we have a reservation under Matthews,” Potter tells the shirtless employee behind the counter, who smiles at them and clicks some buttons on his muggle machine. Draco peeks; he can’t see the waistband of any pants from the angle at which he’s standing, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the employee isn’t wearing any. Glancing around, he can see people lounging and walking in various states of undress, some down to their pants and several more completely nude. Everyone seem oddly relaxed about it. Draco’s face grows hot.</p><p>“Welcome!” The employee fiddles with something for a moment, then passes over some pamphlets and a small plastic card.  “You’re in our lakeview suite and your names have been added to our VIP lists. Please feel free to join in any activities — even those marked ‘closed,’ such as our private yoga classes.” He glances over at Draco, looking vaguely sympathetic. “I understand this can be a new experience. Take your own time finding your comfort level; we would never encourage you to disrobe before you’re ready.”</p><p>“Oh, no, this was his idea,” Potter says, squeezing him around the ribcage so tight that Draco’s automatic, infuriated objection is cut off as he tries to breathe. “I said, ‘where should we go for our honeymoon?’ and Daniel here said, ‘Harry, I want to take you somewhere you can be naked the entire time.’” Potter laughs. Draco pastes on a smile and steps on Potter's foot with all of his weight, as Potter continues, “So we’re naked all the way!”</p><p>“Oh, congratulations!” the employee says, grinning.  “Please, let me send up a complimentary bottle of champagne to your room.”</p><p>“Thanks, that’d be great,” Potter says with a grin, nuzzling Draco’s ear. Draco pinches a bit of muscle on Potter’s back and twists it ruthlessly until Potter’s arm around him loosens.</p><p>“Yes, lovely, thank you,” Draco parrots.</p><p>They make it to their room without further incident to find that they are, indeed, very lovely accommodations. The bed is over-large, covered with a crisp white duvet and half a dozen pristine white pillows; there's a fully stocked mini-liquor cabinet and muggle cooling box, a table, and cabinets filled with books. The en suite has a deep porcelain tub, so large it could almost rival that in the prefect’s bath. </p><p>Draco sits down on the bed after looking around. He slides off his shoes, toeing off his socks and sighing as the air hits his feet.</p><p>“See, not so bad, right?” Potter says.</p><p>Draco’s mouth quirks. “Do you mind telling me why you’re so excited about this, Potter?  Honestly.”</p><p>Potter shrugs. “Well, I never really get to take vacations where people don’t know me, do I? I’ve always thought I’d one day travel to America or further, someplace out of Europe where people won’t recognise me, but I haven’t had the chance  yet. Using Polyjuice to get some peace when I go out usually works, but it always makes me feel odd for a couple of days afterward.  Right now, though, we basically get to stay in this nice room and ask questions for a few days while doing some good. As assignments go, it’s not the worst.” </p><p>His eyes are on Draco’s bare feet as he speaks. Self-consciously, Draco pulls them closer. </p><p>“Oh.” Draco doesn’t know what to say — it’s probably the most personal thing Potter has ever told him, and it’s not even that detailed. A lot of people know he doesn’t like the attention he gets from the press, but for Potter to confide it in him directly is... disconcerting. “All right. Do you want to go over the files for a few minutes?”</p><p>“I don’t know, I thought naked yoga sounded fun.” There's a wicked edge to Potter's smile and Draco can’t tamp down a laugh, even as his cock responds to the idea of Potter -- wearing nothing -- in downward-facing dog. </p><p>He sighs; this is going to be such a problem.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>Two hours later, Draco has done everything he can think of to stall, having gone meticulously through the case files twice. Potter keeps shooting him exasperated glances, as if that’s going to convince Draco to strip down to the skin and go waltzing around, no matter how luxurious the resort is.<p>“My love,” Potter says abruptly. Draco’s so startled, he drops the case file he’s holding. Parchment scatters over the bedding and he hastily collects it.</p><p>“Potter?” It comes out more warily than he’d intended, but Merlin help him if Potter is suddenly under some kind of love spell.</p><p>“Just getting into character,” Potter says. Then, more pointedly, “Because we need to leave the room soon. The first blind contact for the seller is near the nude pool. I thought we could start there.”</p><p>Draco scowls, but has to concede the point. He didn’t work his arse off for three years of brutal Auror training to let his appalling attraction to his one-time nemesis turned co-worker turned sort-of-friend keep him from doing his damned job. “Fine. But try not to stare.”</p><p>“No,” Potter says. He smirks. </p><p>“I sometimes wonder if you’re still a teenager who’s just taken aging potions,” Draco mutters on his way to the loo.</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Malfoy,” Potter calls.  “As a teenager, I never would have been able to admit how attracted to you I was.”</p><p>Draco schools his expression until he’s in the privacy of the en suite, but the face he sees in the mirror — not quite his own, with wider cheekbones, brown eyes and a less patrician nose, topped by sandy-blond hair — looks flushed and… and fucking <i>tempted</i>. He glares at his faux-reflection before using the facilities and taking a quick, cool shower —even better than a charm. </p><p>When he’s finished, he reaches for his clothing automatically but stops, glaring at the folded pile.  Wrapping a towel around his hips instead, he heads back into the bedroom.</p><p>Potter is lounging on the bed, fully nude already. All of the air leaves Draco’s lungs on a rush.</p><p>“You didn’t want to bathe?”</p><p>“Charms,” Potter says blithely. His head tilts to one side and his mouth ticks up at the corner. “You okay, Draco?”</p><p>“Of course.” Draco sniffs and takes off his towel.</p><p>There’s really no point in avoiding the issue — not if Potter keeps confronting it like this. And Draco’s attraction to him hasn’t exactly been hidden anyway, not since that night they got pissed after closing a case and stumbled to Potter’s flat together, near a year ago now. Draco's ten year secret, burst with one shared bottle of whiskey. Still, that doesn’t make it easier to be see exactly what he's spent far too many hours contemplating since then: Potter’s body with its golden-tan skin, small brown nipples, and lean muscles. He's all graceful sinew and bone, and he stands and stretches, deliberately on display to Draco’s gaze. The reality of his cock, which Draco'd felt pressed thick and hard against his thigh that night, doesn't suffer upon the viewing of it, though it's (mostly) flaccid. It’s surrounded by curling black hair, which narrows into a thin trail on Potter’s flat stomach that leads to his belly-button.</p><p>“Draco,” Potter says, and it sounds like a warning. Like a promise.</p><p>Draco glances up. Potter’s eyes are dark with intent and are zeroed in on Draco’s cock, which gives a little tingle, as though it’s being stroked by Potter’s gaze. Draco sighs, consciously stretching out an arm to lean against the wall, posing in a way he knows makes him look delectable. He crosses one leg over the other and inhales deeply. “Wasn’t the point of that for me to look?”</p><p>“Yes," Potter says, with not a shred of evasiveness. He swallows, and Draco has suddenly had enough.  He pushes off the wall.</p><p>“Are we done then?” he snaps. “We’ve both looked and satisfied our curiosities. You were the one who was so anxious to get outside.”</p><p>Potter takes a halting step toward him, left hand curling closed. Draco carefully doesn’t look down again as Potter draws in a breath and releases it slowly.</p><p>“Yeah, we should go,” he says gruffly.  “Got your wand?”</p><p>Draco retrieves the forearm holster charmed to look like some kind of muggle bone brace. The slender, sculpted length of his fir wand will slot easily between the holster and his forearm, ready to be pulled with a slight twitch of his wrist. He fumbles with one hand to put the holster on, but then Potter is there, gently buckling the fastenings for him, so close that Draco can smell his skin. Leather and woodsmoke and some subtle, spicy scent lingering underneath.  Draco dutifully starts to look away, but a small marking catches his eye. He narrows his eyes and looks closer at Potter’s chest.</p><p>“Is that—”</p><p>Potter glances down, surprised. “Oh.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you had a tattoo.” He’s seen Potter shirtless plenty of times, while they duel for training or with a towel around his waist in the locker room.  Draco’s sure he would have remembered if Potter had got a tattoo. He squints at it; it looks familiar, though not on Potter’s skin.</p><p>“So what?” Potter clips out, moving away. Draco can’t help but note the muscled curve of his arse as it bunches while he walks. “You have one.” </p><p>Irrationally stung, Draco turns. He searches through his bag for a moment, eyes unfocussed, and hears Potter sigh loudly behind him.</p><p>“Sorry, Malfoy,” Potter mutters, low. “I didn’t realise that the Glamour — whatever they did to enable us to see each other — would reveal it. I keep it hidden for a reason.”</p><p>“Why would you get a tattoo on such a visible spot if you were planning on hiding it?” Draco asks, hoping he sounds more absent-mindedly curious than hurt. He spies a glint of something in his bag pulls out a black lacquer box. Opening it and lifting out the medallion that will enable them to contact each other without a Patronus while they’re on-site, he slips the chain the disc dangles from around his neck, then holds out the box. Potter’s hand lands on his wrist for a moment, gentle, as if in apology. Draco looks up.</p><p>“I—” Potter falters. “I had to.”</p><p>“Well,” Draco says coolly, “I had to get mine, too.”</p><p>Potter takes the box from him, meeting his eyes levelly. He breathes out slowly, and purses his mouth. “You don’t understand.”</p><p>Frowning, Draco looks at it once more, that coppery little triangle-circle-line, positioned right over Potter's heart. “Of course not.  You don’t explain—” He bites his lip, memory aligning with what's in front of him. “Is that the symbol for the Deathly Hallows? From the children’s story? The Three Brothers?”</p><p>If possible, Potter looks even unhappier. He glances down at it again. “Yeah.”</p><p>Draco considers that for a moment, uncertain as to how to respond. Almost certainly, he’s just learned something that no one beyond Potter’s most exclusive circle knows. Taking a chance, he ventures, “Does this have something to do with what you said at the... That night? About me being the master of the Elder Wand?”</p><p>“It does,” Potter says, looking at him with an inscrutable expression that feels significant somehow. Draco hides his shock.</p><p>It can’t hurt to try his luck once more, so he asks, “Then don’t you think I might have a right to know about it?”</p><p>It’s been one of his most burning questions for the last seven years, and probably one of Potter’s most guarded secrets. But other than the speech he’d given to the Dark Lord before felling him, Potter and his friends have never referenced the Wand again. For a while people whispered about it, and rumours still circulated from time to time, but Draco long ago resigned himself to never know the truth -- in part, because it never occurred to him that he might have cause to ask, in part because he's been too scared to.</p><p>And for good reason, it seems. At the question, Potter’s bright eyes go dark and flinty behind his specs. He moves away once more, magic snapping around him like static electricity, and plucks out his own pendant to loop it around his throat. “We should go.”</p><p>“Fine,” Draco says. It's practically a habit now around Potter to ignore any pang of interest encouraging him to ask more questions; Potter never gives up anything he doesn’t want to. “One of us should swim to make it look natural.”</p><p>“You go ahead,” Potter says tersely, not meeting Draco’s eyes. He simply stands there sullenly, the most attractive naked man Draco has ever shared a room with, and somehow manages to make Draco feel sorry for him. “I’ll look around and talk to people.”</p><p>Draco capitulates with a shrug. The water will be nice in this blasted heat, and there’s nothing that says he can’t observe the other guests from that vantage point. Besides, as fond as he is of his cock, he’s not exactly chuffing to show it off to the masses. “I’m a better swimmer anyway.”</p><p>Potter smirks and the strange, tense atmosphere finally starts to dissipate. In a conciliatory gesture, he nods to Draco. “Need a skin-protective charm?”</p><p>Draco shrugs again, not willing to outright accept the offer but not wanting to refuse, and Potter seems to take it as a confirmation. He waves his hand in Draco’s direction and the tingling, refreshing coolness of magic blankets Draco from his scalp to his toes in a slow, almost erotic ripple. He represses a shiver; he’s always gone a bit weak against the buzz of Potter’s magic.</p><p>Potter is watching him with a raised eyebrow when Draco looks up. It doesn’t escape Draco’s notice that he’s gotten half-hard in the last few moments, nor does it escape his notice that Potter has, too. His cock has thickened and lengthened and Draco doesn’t know whether to launch himself at Potter for being a walking wet dream or hex him to pieces for being everything Draco can’t have.</p><p>“We’re going to attract more attention sporting these,” Potter says after a moment, a hint of suggestion to it. Draco snorts.</p><p>“Everyone thinks we’re on our honeymoon,” he says. Potter grins, his bad mood completely banished by Draco’s grudging — though humiliatingly obvious —
 desire and Draco surprises himself by chuckling in response. “You canvas the area around the pool. I’ll talk to people and get a general idea of who’s been here the last week.”</p><p>Potter tilts his head thoughtfully at the instruction and nods. Technically, he’s Draco’s superior, having joined the Auror force over a year before Draco did.  But on the rare cases they work together, he’s been much more of a team player than Draco would have ever suspected in their youth; chalk one point up for Weasley and Granger training him right, Draco supposes.</p><p>“Yeah,” Potter says after a beat. “I’ll set up alert charms where I can around the towel-rack that the first contact is supposed to be made through.”</p><p>“Sounds good." It's a bit bewildering to have such a normal conversation while he and Potter are both looking at each other, naked and at half-mast, but Draco shakes it off. “We’ll reconvene here after dinner and discuss—”</p><p>Potter gives a muffled little laugh. “Uh, Malfoy—we’re having dinner together. I’m not likely to leave my new husband alone to eat while I wander the grounds looking at naked strangers.”</p><p>Flustered, Draco blinks and absorbs that. “Right.” It’s not as though they haven’t eaten together before. “Well.”</p><p>“For that matter, you’re probably going to have to resign yourself to being... er, <i>close</i> to me for the duration,” Potter continues. The words are teasing, but his eyes are dark and watchful.</p><p>Close to him. Close to Potter. Because they’re undercover as newlyweds who have to be naked all the time.</p><p><i>Fuck</i>, Draco thinks. Then, for good measure,
 <i>fuck, fuck, fuck!</i></p><p>He takes a deep breath and gives Potter what he hopes is an intimidating glare.  “No tongue when you kiss me.”</p><p>“I’ll do my best, but circumstances being what they are, I can’t promise anything,” Potter says loftily, pulling his chin up.</p><p>Fuck.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>The afternoon sun is glaring white-gold. Having been at the pool for over two hours, Draco is duly grateful for the strength of Potter’s skin-protective charm as a middle-aged woman named Alice chats with him about how freeing the resort is, her breasts bobbing in the water beside him. She seems completely at ease in her own skin, unperturbed by the extra weight around her middle and the softening of her jaw, or the stretch marks that shine white along the fleshy inside of her upper arms. Draco quite likes that about her. Apart from his looks, Draco's never felt at ease with himself; he's always wondered what that would be like.<p>“This is our eighth year here,” Alice continues, voice warm and friendly. Her rhinestone-rimmed sunglasses rest on top of her head, casting rainbow bursts of light at him whenever she moves. Draco keeps his face engaged, nodding at the appropriate moments as he listens with half an ear and scans the sprawling pool area. It contains not one pool but four, as well as a waterslide -- though thankfully he hasn’t seen anyone use it yet. He can’t imagine how that would look.</p><p>…Fun, perhaps.</p><p>He tips her a smile and nods again when she falls silent. “You’d thought about trying it before your daughter went to University?”</p><p>“Oh, yes. Alan had always talked about it. He came here when he was eighteen and rather liked the setting. He’s a bit of a bear when he doesn’t get a holiday,” she confides quietly, glancing at her husband, who's lounging, half-sleep, in one of the deck chairs. She giggles, but it comes out low and confident, rather than grating or childlike.  “When I was younger, it felt a lot more risqué than it does now. It’s positively addictive, coming here and allowing yourself to be on display, surrounded by like-minded people. Just watch; I bet I’ll see you here next summer. Very few people don’t come back.”</p><p>Draco’s attention narrows. He turns a subtly devious smile at her and gives her his full focus. “I doubt you’d remember me, love.”</p><p>Alice laughs again, twinkling a casually-flirtatious eye at him.  “And I doubt you’re easy to forget.”</p><p>Draco smirks. “Maybe you just have an eye for faces.”</p><p>She gives a considering nod. “I actually do. I’m a photographer, so I tend to have good recall.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Draco tilts his head back against the tiled lip of the pool and looks around pointedly. “How many people here do you recognise?”</p><p>She frowns thoughtfully, dark brown eyes roving.  “At least two-thirds. There are always new people here for the titillation factor who quickly realise that— well, it’s just not that titillating. So a few don’t come back.  But I can usually spot the ones who will.”</p><p>“And I’m destined to be one of them?” Draco asks, amused.</p><p>“I think you need a bit of this,” she says candidly, surprising him. “A way to escape those things you hide yourself in. I think you’ll find it benefits you, to be open. I have a feeling you’re quite... guarded.”</p><p>It’s an incredibly presumptuous thing to say, but surprisingly astute for all that and Draco tries not to feel embarrassed that that the inner workings of his heart are so obvious. But he nods. “Perhaps. Who won’t be back?”</p><p>“That man, there,” Alice says, pointing to a swarthy fellow in a sunning chair, dark glasses propped on his brow. “I saw him being rude to a staff member earlier; those types usually don’t return, because one of the basic tenets of this place is a sense of equality amongst us all. And see those two younger gentlemen chatting?” She gives a discreet nod to two boys, barely out of their teens, at the end of the pool. “They’re the hot-naked-women seekers. They won’t be back.”</p><p>Draco doesn’t bother suppressing a snicker, and she joins in, delighted. “That woman with the red hair—I’d wager her husband dragged her here or something. He’s probably off doing things and having a fantastic time, and she seems uncomfortable with the whole thing. And that man with the light hair at the bar, wearing his pants? I’m <i>fairly sure,</i>” she says, drawing out the words, “that he thought this resort would be a good place to take a working vacation. Honestly, I doubt he even realised what it was; maybe just saw a picture of the lodge and the hot springs. He’s incredibly tense always carrying around a laptop case. There are probably a few more, but I’m sure of those.”</p><p>Draco studies the man for a moment. He does seem tense, and there’s a black laptop case resting at his feet as he sips a blue drink. </p><p>His pendant flares hot against his chest, and Draco starts, sloshing the water a bit around them. He prepares to make his excuses, but suddenly her eyebrows fly high. Draco looks up and sees Potter approaching. “Now that one I can only <i>hope</i> comes back,” she murmurs to him, eyes widening.</p><p>Potter does cut an impressive figure, Draco has to admit. He’s all lean hard lines, and his thick, soft cock bounces slightly with each purposeful step. His eyes are gloriously green, though of course Draco is the only one who can see them as such, and his jaw is square and tight, in direct contrast to the softness of his mouth, which is pulled into a gentle, interested smile. He radiates power as he walks, leanly muscled thighs tensing, and Draco wonders if the muggles can sense it — can <i>feel</i> it — like he does, the inherent, ruthlessly coiled magical strength that emanates from him.</p><p>Potter halts in front of them and crouches down. He doesn’t seem to notice the way his balls dip and hang loose between his thighs, but he’s definitely noticed that Draco’s been staring. Draco flushes, suddenly regretting the sun-charm he was so grateful for only minutes ago. </p><p>“Babe,” Potter says, low and warm. Alice makes a small sound beside Draco.</p><p>“Harry, meet Alice,” he says, dutifully reaching up to accept the kiss that Potter leans down to bestow upon his mouth. It’s barely more than a light brush, but Draco’s lips tingle. “She was just telling me that we’ll definitely be coming back.”</p><p>Alice laughs, low and throaty, completely unabashed at having ogled Potter so openly. She holds out a wet hand. “I think Daniel here will like it,” she amends. “And you seem the type to go where your partner does.”</p><p>Harry shakes her hand and quirks a grin at her. “Husband. And I am. Pleasure.”</p><p>“Likewise.” Her eyes grow wide as she catches view of something behind him. “Oh, dear, Alan’s waving at me; he’s getting grouchy. I’d better get him back to the room before he burns.”</p><p>“It was lovely to talk to you,” Draco says.</p><p>“Yes. I’m sure I’ll see you soon,” she returns, smiling, then swims off with a small wave in their direction. </p><p>Potter shifts so he’s sitting on his bottom. He dangles his legs in the pool next to Draco. “Making friends?”</p><p>“Well, if my new husband hadn’t abandoned me after he promised not to,” Draco says snidely. Potter huffs a laugh and nudges him in the side of his stomach with his foot. Draco rolls his eyes. “She’s been here eight years running. Mentioned a few first-timers that don’t have the feel of returning guests to her. Two men and a woman, as well as a pair of younger blokes who can’t be more than twenty-one.”</p><p>Potter removes his specs and clips sun shields onto them, then slides them back onto the bridge of his nose. It looks weird to not be able to see the colour that makes Draco think of a charm gathering energy at the tip of a wand -- all of that brightness hidden. </p><p>“We’ll check them out,” Potter says. “We can feed your memory of them into the file folder they gave us, and they’ll run their faces at the Ministry.”</p><p>“All this fancy new equipment just for to find a cursed object and the wizard trying to sell it,” Draco murmurs. “I wish we knew what it was for.”</p><p>“Not our place,” Potter says quietly, but Draco can tell from the sudden tension around his mouth that it bothers him as well. All they really know is what the item looks like — small as a human palm, crystalline and blue — and that Draco’s Mark is likely to respond to it somehow. Their orders are remarkably vague and Draco may not be in the position to comment on it, but it does nag at him.</p><p>“Any one of them could be Polyjuiced or Glamoured,” Draco says, returning to the original subject.</p><p>“Yeah, but maybe we’ll get lucky and they’ll have used the identity before.” Potter rests a light hand on his shoulder, and Draco forces himself to stay relaxed
 — to lean into it, even. “You ready to go shower before dinner?”</p><p>“Yes. Grab my towel?”</p><p>Potter hops up and retrieves his towel from one of the sunning chairs as Draco hauls himself out of the water.  He pats himself dry and feels Potter’s hand slip around his waist to pull him flush, wetting Potter’s skin from chest to hip. Potter ducks his head into the curve of Draco’s throat and kisses him there, once, twice, then puts his mouth close to Draco’s ear. Draco goes a bit dizzy from the unexpectedness of the sensations, which send little shocks of pleasure straight to his groin. “I need to talk to you in the room.”</p><p>Draco huffs a little, but keeps his expression loose and besotted. “I figured as much, you idiot,” he whispers acidly, giving Potter a fond smile and tucking a lock of his wild black hair behind his ear. “You didn’t need to give me a hard-on to get that point across.”</p><p>Potter looks startled, as if only just realising that the neck kissing could have that effect, and Draco is slightly mollified -- until Potter glances down to see the truth of it and starts laughing. “S-sorry,” he gets out.</p><p>Draco wraps the towel around his waist as haughtily as he can manage and takes the hand Potter offers. He tries his best to break at least one or two of the fingers in his grip on the way back to their room.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>“What is it?” Draco snaps when they get back to their room. He immediately grabs his pants from the foot of the bed and slips them on.<p>Potter shakes his head, mouth tight, putting a palm up for silence. Draco sits on the bed and chews on his lip — the only nervous habit he still has from the war —
 as Potter pulls a small, leather pouch from his bag.  He opens it and draws out the familiar length of—</p><p>Draco tries not to goggle, he really does, but… It’s just that no one has seen Potter use a wand in <i>years</i>. He doesn’t use it now, in fact — simply palms it reassuringly as he wandlessly casts a series of extra privacy charms over the ones they set up when they arrived. But the very presence of the holly wand between them is as jarring as being asked to shake hands with someone long thought dead. </p><p>When Potter’s finished, he grabs a pair of joggers from his bag and tugs them on, then sits down next to Draco on the bed.</p><p>“That’s your holly wand,” Draco blurts -- rather eloquently, he thinks, for the amount of surprise he feels.</p><p>Potter shakes his head impatiently. “The wizard had magic-revealing charms set up around the communication site. It took me over an hour to infiltrate it enough to set up a charm that would alert us when it was in use but I had to request contact instead, or he might have bolted; his wards were too intricate to track without tipping him off. Not while people could potentially see me.”</p><p>“Alright.” Draco considers. This moves their schedule up some. “Response is usually within twenty-four hours?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Potter exhales. Gives him an apologetic glance. “Yes. Then the next contact drop to see if we’re approved for a meet. I know this changes things.”</p><p>“Not really,” Draco says thoughtfully. “We may have get the lay of the land, but Shacklebolt couldn’t really have just expected my Mark to flare up randomly around someone. He had to know that we’d need to pose as buyers eventually.” He hesitates. “The use of multiple drops is unusual for an item that needs to be quickly moved. It seems… more deliberate.”</p><p>Potter gives him a clipped nod, frowning.</p><p>“What I want to know is why the extra charms around the room,” Draco continues, watching him closely. Potter’s oddly restless — fingers drumming against his thigh, knee juddering. He tends to be rather expressive in general, but this is… different.</p><p>Potter’s frown intensifies. He opens his mouth to respond, then shuts it immediately, a confused look crossing his face. “I-I don’t know. Defensive magic flared up at me when I began unlocking the wards. But mostly it’s that… I got a sense of something at the drop sight. Like— an echo of magic I recognised. It made me uneasy.”</p><p>“You think we know the wizard?”</p><p>“No, it’s something else,” Potter says instantly. His shoulders relax at the immediacy of his own answer, as though he hadn’t been sure. His mouth curls up in a self-deprecating smile. “You think I’m mad now.”</p><p>Draco snorts. “I’ve always thought you were <i>mad</i>, Potter.” He sniffs, shrugging. “But I’ve long had a healthy appreciation for your instincts, so.”</p><p>Potter is quiet for a moment. He taps two fingers just above Draco’s bare knee and pauses, leaving them there. “Thanks, Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco stares at Potter’s hand, tanned and lean, and the two fingers resting against his skin. He looks up to find Potter studying him in that way he has that’s always made Draco feel so uncomfortable, as though Draco were a riddle and if Potter could only solve him, he’d—</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Draco manages, voice gone husky. Hearing it, Potter slides his hand closer, cupping the top of Draco's thigh with his warm, slightly damp palm. Draco looks up at him; Potter’s eyes are on his hand, pupils dilated and gaze fixed. Draco clears his throat. “This is not a good idea.”</p><p>“Right,” Potter agrees softly. “We’re working.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t be a good idea anyway,” Draco says, shaky but unable to bring himself to shift away as Potter’s thumb begins stroking the soft flesh of his inner thigh. He holds himself still, refusing let himself tremble visibly from the touch. “We tried it once.”</p><p>“Not really,” Potter says in that same hushed tone. “You went home.”</p><p>“We were drunk,” Draco reminds him. It earns him a faint smile.</p><p>“They have liquor here,” Potter says. The pad of his thumb feels like a brand.</p><p>“Yes,” Draco breathes out. He jerks and moves his leg away when Potter’s thumb ghosts a little higher. “And we’re friends. And we’re <i>working</i>. So why not get distracted: let’s get pissed and shag a bit, and let a Dark wizard get away with moving a mysterious, dangerous object.”</p><p>“You’re avoiding this,” Potter says flatly. “You have been for a while.”</p><p>And isn’t that just rich. </p><p>“I want to get back to work,” Draco says, drawing on the deep well of control that has always served him when he's needed it. “And to shelve this discussion for a better time; preferably long after we’re both in our graves.”</p><p>Potter snorts. “I thought you’d gotten over your cowardly instincts a long time ago, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Self-preservation is not cowardly.” Really, the defence just slips out, but Potter pauses to think it through. Draco’s neck warms — he can practically see the cogs whirring in Potter’s head — and he checks the clock on the nightstand for something to do. “Dinner in an hour. Would you like to shower first, or can I?”</p><p>“You go. I think you need it more, right now,” Potter says with an unsubtle, downward flick of his eyes. As always, his cock responds to the touch of Potter’s gaze, jerking.</p><p>Draco stands and flips him two fingers, sweeping past him to the loo.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>Fortunately, Potter leaves off the discussion over dinner; even more fortunately, he takes Draco to the fully-clothed dining room, where they’re served a rather sumptuous meal. If they weren’t finding subtle ways to talk about the case the whole time, Draco might even feel as if it were a <i>date.</i> Which is not unheard of for newlyweds, but there’s an element of uncertainty hovering around Potter that Draco doesn't like. Potter seems distracted as they bounce ideas back and forth, continuously looking about the room like he's trying to catch any stray glimmers of magic. They can trail about like loose threads behind Dark wizards sometimes, as the darkness slowly unravels the mind — the way it did with Draco's aunt — but the jumpy way Potter seems to search for them puts Draco on his back foot.<p>Suddenly, Potter slides a hand over his and draws Draco closer across the table. “Businessman, six o’clock,” he murmurs. </p><p>Draco smiles and waits for a moment before pulling back and casually glancing around, not letting his eyes land on anything in particular. Businessman is wearing a three-piece suit, though most of the other diners are slightly more casual. He sits at the bar again, perusing the menu.</p><p>“Can you attempt Legilimency?” Potter says under his breath. Draco starts a bit and glances over again.</p><p>“It's a little far,” he says after a moment of consideration. “And some muggles perform Occlumency without realising. Besides which, I’m not that good at it; he might know I’m trying to breach him.”</p><p>Potter chokes, coughing out the water he was about to swallow. He puts down his glass and picks up a linen napkin, patting his damp shirt. “After what I saw today, I’d say that’s a safe bet,” he snickers when he gets his breath back.</p><p>Draco rolls his eyes and gives Potter a little kick to the shin, more pleased at the compliment than he’s willing to admit or examine. Potter’s mouth tips up to one side. “What about you?” Draco asks, just as quietly.</p><p>“No. I’ve learned Occlumency, but was never able to," his lips quiver, “<i>breach</i> someone. In that way.”</p><p>It’s on the tip of Draco’s tongue to follow up on that with a ribald comment, but glares instead. “You might be able to make it seamless — I’ve heard that when it’s done wandlessly, it’s often undetectable.”</p><p>Potter wavers and finally gives a slow shake of his head. “Too uncomfortable with it. Even if I’d been better trained, that alone would ensure it was an unpleasant experience, right?” Draco nods, and Potter leans back in his chair, stroking a foot against Draco’s ankle. “The server has been gone a while, love — would you mind getting me a drink at the bar?”</p><p>It’s not an order, but there’s something uncompromising about the request anyway. Draco purses his lips. He rises and brushes a kiss over Potter’s temple and murmurs, “I’m only checking for shields.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>At the bar, Draco sits on a stool and waits for the bartender’s attention. Businessman sits two stools away and Draco allows his focus to tunnel,  mind reaching out in a whisper to investigate. The smoky, questing tendrils he visualizes to aid him are almost immediately buffered as they reach the man—surrounding him but not sinking into his skin.</p><p>Carefully, Draco begins to retract his probe, glancing at Potter to give him a small nod. But as soon as his gaze lands on Potter's face, a swarm of pain clusters in Draco's forehead. Potter’s shields blast into his mind with force, like the ricochet of a curse. Draco bites back a gasp, recoiling his mind sharply as Potter sits up straighter and looks at him, concerned.</p><p>Draco sits, panting lightly and composing himself as the pain fades. He's shaky and feels mentally nauseated. Why the bloody hell does Potter need a shield so strong, and how is it possible he can’t perform Legilimency if he can do <i>that?</i> Draco doesn’t even think the Dark Lord utilised Occlumency to such a degree. Then again, no one would have ever dared to try to peek into his mind.</p><p>The bartender comes over and Draco orders two whiskeys. He’s so shaken, he barely notices when Businessman gets up to leave, passing right behind him — not until his Mark twists in the way he’ll never become accustomed to. It’s not the burn he’d felt when it was seared onto his skin, but a sensation of… greedy <i>hunger</i>, as though the snake, uncoiling, is demanding to be fed.</p><p>Still not completely steady from his encounter with Potter’s shield, the slithering against his forearm makes Draco shudder involuntarily and when the bartender brings over their drinks, Draco knocks his own back quickly. Then, for good measure, he swallows Potter’s, too.</p><p>He heads back to the table. Potter’s eyes are green-black with worry, but the smile on his face is casual and amused. “Got thirsty?”</p><p>“Mmhmm.” It comes out grimmer than Draco’d intended, so he smiles and bends at the waist. He kisses Potter deeply, mouth moving firmly against Potter’s surprised lips.</p><p>He doesn’t know where it comes from. He could just as easily whisper in Potter's ear, then take his hand and lead him out. But there’s something in Draco -- a combination of fear and loathing and ache -- that needs the contact, and for once he can’t make himself question his own motives.</p><p>Potter makes a low, muffled sound, his startlingly cool hands coming up to cup Draco’s cheeks. He takes control of the kiss quickly, slanting his head to the side and slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth and, <i>Merlin</i>, Draco had forgotten what a skilled kisser he was by half. He rubs his tongue against Potter’s and plucks at the collar of his shirt as Potter stands and winds an arm tightly around his back. He tastes like wine and scallops.</p><p>“We’re making a scene,” Draco says when Potter finally allows him to breathe, pulling back with a gasp of his own. “Let’s go back to our room, darling.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Potter says hoarsely, his palm resting on the small of Draco’s back, the tips of his fingers firm on the upper curve of his arse. His eyes are unfocussed but Draco can see the moment they clear, the moment Potter is able to process that Draco’s used a term of endearment. His expression shutters into something affectionate, and for a second, Draco allows himself to loathe it, that false adoration hiding the smoulder of honest lust. Potter swallows. “Yes, let’s.”</p><p>At once lightheaded and anchored thanks to the simple clasp of Potter’s arm around his waist, Draco leans into him. He's shocky and dizzy from the gut-punch of forces from a few moments ago, but not from Potter’s touch, which is comforting. Potter seems to understand, because he doesn’t release Draco until they arrive back at their room, and then only long enough to open their door and shuffle him inside. Once the door is closed and the privacy charms are back in place, he faces Draco and places firm hands on Draco’s hips. They stare at each other.</p><p>“What,” Potter demands, face stark, “the bloody hell <i>happened</i> back there, Malfoy?”</p><p>Draco gulps. His hips tingle under the gentle pressure of Potter’s fingers, and he thinks of moving away but can’t bring himself to.</p><p>“He definitely has some shields up — I couldn’t tell whether they were muggle or not at first, but—”</p><p>“Wait, wait.” Potter sighs deeply when Draco falls silent. Then, looking at him narrowly, Potter leans forward.</p><p>Draco sees it coming. There's plenty of time to stop it, this kiss for no reason other than because they want to. But he doesn’t pull away, doesn’t close his eyes. Potter’s gaze is heavy-lidded and careful as his mouth brushes warmly over Draco’s. His eyes flutter shut so Draco closes his too, and then he's awash in sensation: Potter’s slick tongue sliding against his, Potter sucking Draco's bottom lip between his teeth. Their breaths catch and mingle as Potter’s slips his hands up and down the length of his back, and Draco <i>knows</i> this is a bad idea, of course he does — there’s no way Potter doesn’t, as well — but he somehow needs this so very badly that he doesn’t voice any of the dozens of objections wedged in his throat. Not even when Potter’s erection, thick and rigid, presses temptingly against his own.</p><p>When Potter finally pulls away, he's breathless, and Draco realises his hands have somehow gone and gotten trapped in Potter’s unruly hair. For all the mess it is, it’s rather silky under his palms and between his fingers; it’s with no small amount of regret that he  drops his arms.</p><p>“Malfoy,” Potter says roughly. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Draco goes utterly still in Potter’s hold. There’s a different, underlying question beyond Potter’s concern. He’s asking if Draco knows what this is, where it’s leading. He’s asking if Draco will surrender to it.</p><p>Draco has his pride, still. He wants to say no. He’s known it would come to this since they were given the assignment, goddamn it, though he’d done everything he could think of not to admit it to himself. But their kiss has wiped clean all memory of how to keep distance from this thing he’s so wanted, and the truth falls from Draco’s tongue like a prayer.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>It’s taken him <i>seven fucking hours</i> after their arrival to cave and Draco doesn’t know whether to hate his own weakness or admire Potter the persistent fortitude which so attracts him. He closes his eyes and waits for Potter’s annoying triumph.</p><p>But Potter only releases a shuddering breath. He steps away with a gentle squeeze to Draco's hips and settles into a chair a few feet away, studying Draco as he sits down on the bed with a breath.</p><p>“All right. So what happened? He had Occlumency up? What makes you so sure he’s a wizard?” Potter asks.</p><p>Draco takes a second to gather his bearings. His Mark is still and silent. “When he got up to leave, my Mark reacted. It was responding to Dark Magic — either his, or something in the case he was carrying.”</p><p>Potter’s gaze sharpens. “How strong were his shields?”</p><p>“Not as strong as yours,” Draco says bitterly, remembering it.</p><p>Blinking, Potter frowns. “You tried to use Legilimency on me?” It’s less accusatory than surprised, but Potter’s body has gone subtly tense where he sits.</p><p>“No, you daft prick.” Draco huffs. “I was pulling my mind away and merely <i>looked</i> at you. Your shields hit me like a hex to the forehead.” He pauses as something occurs to him. “That could be problem.”</p><p>Potter has no trouble following his train of thought. “No. It won’t be. People in general are unable to tell my shields are so strong. You can probably only sense them because of—”</p><p>“The Glamour,” Draco finishes for him heavily. “Well. I’d ask why you’re apparently hiding so much, but I’m obviously not going to get an answer, am I?”</p><p>“Depends on what you really want to know.”</p><p>Draco arches an eyebrow. “I’m supposed to trust you’d be forthcoming?”</p><p>Potter's shoulders hitch lazily. “You could try it and see.” But his hesitation after saying so is somehow more believable. “We should contact the Ministry, see if they’ve had any hits on the Polyjuice recognition.”</p><p>It’s a reprieve from whatever is happening between them and Draco finds himself grateful for it. He nods and pulls out the file charmed to receive communications from the Ministry. It’s empty. </p><p>“Might take longer,” he says doubtfully. “We gave them five potentials.”</p><p>“They’d have something by now.”</p><p>Draco bites back the snide comment his disappointment urges him to make. He puts away the file and removes another, along with a charmed quill that’s spelled to capture his memory of events. He jots them down quickly on some confidential parchment and presses the flattened scroll into the file, where it promptly turns green and vanishes.</p><p>“There’s something else,” he says abruptly.</p><p>“Yeah?” Potter hasn’t moved from his position on the chair except to cross one bent knee over his leg. He looks relaxed, barely interested, but there’s something vaguely leashed about the way he’s holding himself.</p><p>Draco searches his mind for what’s bothering him. His mind flashes back to the bar, to the Businessman. To the— “Fuck.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Draco checks his wand. “He was reading a menu when I sat down next to him. I think he was planning on eating.”</p><p>“Then he felt you.” Potter stands, mouth going tight. His hands stray to his pendant and a moment later, there’s the loud crack of Apparition as a partially clothed, thirty-something woman lands between them. She’s wearing a lanyard with an employee tag.</p><p>“Aurors.”</p><p>Draco doesn't recognise her, but she looks young and likely has a Glamour on as well. Draco's fleetingly appreciative that he and Potter are unrecognisable so they can avoid the star-struck admiration that Potter routinely fields from newer Aurors -- probably the reason Potter has no regular partner and is paired randomly, per assignment.</p><p>Potter cuts to the chase. “Male, dark hair, about thirty-five. Doesn’t go fully nude, carries around a laptop briefcase.”</p><p>“Room 510,” she says instantly. “He’s been here for nearly a week. We’ve had our eyes on him, too.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Potter says briefly. She gives him a nod and vanishes with another bang. Draco’s grateful for their excessive muffling charms.</p><p>Potter retrieves a small phial from his bag and hauls Draco close. “What’re you—”</p><p>“Side-along.”</p><p>“But you don’t know where room 510 is,” Draco says, alarmed. He tries to squirm away from the unyielding press of Potter’s body.</p><p>“Memorised the layout,” Potter tells him.</p><p><i>Of course</i> he did. Wanker.</p><p>He relaxes into Potter and feels the sudden nauseating twist, the vacuum of space, as they transport. They land heavily, still gripping each other, to see Businessman calmly reading Wizard’s Monthly. He begins to rise, wanded hand coming up in automatic defence, when Potter mutters “<i>Expelliarmus</i>,” under his breath, flicking negligent fingers, which then catch the wand handily.</p><p>Draco shivers, irritated with being turned on by that. He wonders what the wizard would say if he knew he’d just been Disarmed by the most famous wizard of all time in his trademark move.</p><p>It’s much more attractive when he’s Disarming someone <i>else</i>, no matter the method.</p><p>He and Potter step away from each other, and Draco twitches his wrist so his wand flies reassuringly into his grip. He points it threateningly at the man, who has faltered in apparent terror and lowered himself back into his chair. Potter hastens to bind him, and Draco begins to cast rapid-fire revealing charms around the room. The briefcase flies into Draco’s hand and his Mark flares, bright and hot, twisting with sickening demand. He barely controls a yelp, but then Potter is there, taking it from him. His palm covers Draco’s forearm, and the feeling remains but somehow becomes more manageable under Potter's touch.</p><p>Potter lets go of him and gives the man a stony glare. “Would you like to tell us about the item?” he asks, voice deceptively mild and at complete odds with the ruthlessness of his expression.</p><p>“I don’t have it!” the man squawks, no fight in him. “It’s not— I’m just getting paid for a-a piece of something. For bringing it here.”</p><p>Draco points his wand at the man’s head and, at a nod from Potter, blasts into his mind. It’s unpleasant and Businessman’s Occlumency shields are still strong enough to make Draco’s search blurry and vague, but he <i>can</i> discern that the man — Tom — is telling the truth, and comes up with a few other useful tidbits, besides. He frowns, carefully reeling his search back into the calming shadows of his own mind before looking at Potter. “He’s hiding something.”</p><p>Potter rolls his eyes, pulling the phial from his pocket. “Well, of <i>course</i> he is. Because why <i>wouldn’t</i> the criminals want to make it as hard as possible on themselves?”</p><p>He jerks his chin at Draco and Draco smirks, shaking his head. He points his wand at Tom, whose jaw drops open. Potter pops open the phial and leans over to tip a couple of drops into Tom’s mouth. Draco forces his mouth closed with another flick of his wand, and he and Potter watch for a moment as Tom struggles not to swallow.</p><p>Finally, his jaw works and he gasps. Draco loosens his hold on Tom’s mouth, but keeps his wand at the ready.</p><p>“So,” Potter says intently. “What’s going to happen when I open this bag?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Tom mutters, immediate and resentful. His gaze is on Potter’s knees. “It’s a bit of parchment my grandfather had. Has the steps to a spell, but I don’t think it’s even complete. I can’t even really read it; I just wanted the gold they were offering.”</p><p>“They?” Draco asks, Summoning another chair to sit down in.</p><p>“Whoever contacted me. It was like they knew about it,” Tom babbles, tugging futilely at his restraints. “They even knew where I should look for it.”</p><p>“Who’s your grandfather?” Draco asks, ignoring the glance Potter shoots in his direction. Something about Tom's bone structure…</p><p>Miserably, Tom grits out, “Elliot Avery.”</p><p>Draco and Potter look at each other. Potter exhales.</p><p>“Where did your grandfather get it from?” Draco asks. His pulse kicks into high gear, making him starkly aware of his wrists and the hollow of his throat.</p><p>“He was holding it for my father,” Tom says resentfully. “The Dark Lord sometimes had trusted people care for things of hi—”</p><p>“Enough." Draco holds up a hand, his forehead breaking out in a light sweat. He drags the back of his wrist over it.</p><p>“And you never thought about bringing the offer to the Ministry?” Potter asks, studying Draco before turning back to Tom. “You must know we give financial incentive to anyone who aids in the capture of someone involved in Death Eater activities.”</p><p>Tom laughs, a high, wild sound. “<i>Incentive?</i>” he spits. “It’s <i>insulting</i>. I could get more at the corner of Diagon and Knockturn, peddling my grandfather’s things on the street.”</p><p>“He’s not wrong,” Draco feels obliged to point out. Potter waves a dismissive hand at him and Draco shrugs.</p><p>“The right thing, then,” Potter continues, not missing a beat.</p><p>“I Housed Slytherin,” Tom mutters.</p><p>Well, that rankles. “Plenty of Slytherins do the right thing,” Draco says. So what if it’s as often driven by pragmatism as a desire for moral justice?</p><p>“Er, yes,” Potter says, the corners of his eyes crinkling. He’s far too amused; even more so by Draco’s glower. “In fact, I almost Sorted there.”</p><p>“I could give you a list of people from other Houses who have been seduced by the study of the Dark Arts,” Draco offers coolly, then stops.  “Wait, what?  You almost <i>what?</i>”</p><p>Potter smirks.</p><p>“How does everyone not know this?” Draco wonders aloud, petulantly shocked. It seems horribly unfair. Granted, his House didn’t play the most dignified role in the War, but with the way they’ve all been so villainised — to the point where the idiot in front of them uses his House affiliation as a defence — Draco’s offended that Potter hasn’t offered this information sooner. To the <i>Prophet</i>. “To think that for all those years, you could have been Housed in Slyth—”</p><p>“I’ll explain <i>later,</i> Daniel,” Potter says. His eyes flick to Tom, sitting bound and silent, gaze having turned more curious than afraid.</p><p>Draco rubs a hand over his face. “Right.” He pauses, looking at Tom. “Wait, why were you just sitting in here when we arrived?”</p><p>“I was reading,” Tom says, bewildered.</p><p>“But— didn’t you leave the bar because…” Draco rephrases. “Why did you leave the bar so soon after arriving?”</p><p>Tom appears to struggle with the compulsion to speak, but quickly blurts, “I’d done what I came to do.”</p><p>“What was that?” Potter asks, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>“Made contact with the bartender and gotten the confirmation for the transfer of gold,” Tom mutters sullenly. “I’ll be leaving before the bid.”</p><p>It feels natural to exchange another one of those weighted glances with Potter. “The bid? What bid? When?” Potter says after a beat.</p><p>“For the item,” Tom tells them. “I don’t know what it is. It’s night after tomorrow.”</p><p>“Where?”</p><p>“Dunno. I’m leaving as soon as I can,” Tom says, looking away.</p><p>Draco sighs, raking a hand through his hair. Their list of possible suspects has grown, if members of the sodding <i>staff</i> are in on some sort of smuggling/black market conspiracy.</p><p>“Hm.” Potter sounds bored, gives a little shrug even, but as someone who’s spent more than half his life trying to read Potter’s expressions, Draco can tell he’s interested. <i>Very</i> interested. Potter reaches into the bag and comes out with a single piece of parchment, and Draco's Mark twists again unpleasantly. The Dark Lord must have held it or charmed it, or— or been in the fucking <i>room</i> with it. He claps a hand over his forearm and the bow of Potter’s mouth draws down angrily. He flashes a look of such contempt at Tom that he shrinks as far away as he’s able, bound as he is.</p><p>“You okay, Daniel?” Potter asks gruffly.</p><p>“Fine.” Draco straightens his shoulders and releases his arm, arranging himself in a negligent pose.</p><p>Quickly, Potter makes a duplicate of the parchment and returns the original to the laptop case. As soon as it’s out of visibility, the throbbing in Draco’s arm eases. </p><p>“Sorry about this,” Potter says, not sounding sorry at all, then flicks his fingers at Tom. Immediately, his eyes go sightless, his face panicked, mouth moving silently.</p><p>“You could have explained what you were going to do,” Draco says, amusement warring with petty satisfaction at Tom’s fear. </p><p>“He’s deaf, too,” Potter says, eyes glinting smugly at his own maliciousness. His lip curls, and with it something low in Draco’s midsection does too, warmly. He can’t help but feel that Potter’s disgust is partly due to the infuriating protectiveness he tends to feel—which is telling.  “Anyway, I needed to.”</p><p>“What are you thinking?”</p><p>“Well, we can’t exactly bring him in, can we?” Potter asks practically.  “So—”</p><p>“Obliviate and monitor?” Draco murmurs. It makes sense. If Tom Apparates away or if they arrest him, it would undoubtedly scare the people behind the plan into bolting.</p><p>Potter nods, but he looks frustrated. He doesn’t like people getting away with things, even temporarily, Draco knows. But Potter is much, much smarter than many take him for, and Draco appreciates that he's willing to sacrifice his notions of immediate justice when the situation calls for it.</p><p>Draco extends his wand and murmurs the spell. As Tom’s eyes go dreamy and blank, Potter releases the sensory-binding charm, and Tom leans back a bit in his chair, eyelids sagging shut.  Potter stands, pocketing the parchment copy he’d made.</p><p>“Ready?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Potter steps closer to him. He slides an arm that feels entirely too proprietary around Draco’s waist, narrowing his bottle-green gaze. And Draco goes, confused about his own willingness as he steps into the relative shelter of Potter’s body. He’s fractionally shorter than Draco is, but there’s something calming about being pressed against him -- perhaps the hum of the magic that coasts over and vibrates against his skin, or the attraction Draco has always felt, finally being soothed in some small way.</p><p>Perhaps it’s just that it’s Potter, being who he is, wanting to protect everyone.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>Draco is on his third watered-down gin at the restaurant bar as he surveys the room.  After dinner hours, people revert to various stages of nudity, and he’s surprised to find it less and less shocking. He’s gamely stripped down to his pants to better blend, but has yet to feel that sense of freedom that Alice mentioned at the pool; mostly, he just feels a bit chilly. He considers heading back to the warmth of the hotel room, but Potter is there and Draco is in no hurry to return to his doom.<p>After Apparating back to their room, Potter had spent several long seconds just holding him, heavy-lidded eyes on Draco’s mouth, on his face, before letting go. Even the short contact had caused something warm and languid to puddle in Draco’s belly, in his groin, the way it often did when they were alone together. And Draco keeps expecting Potter to press the advantage when he has it, though of course the sod is too honourable to do so. </p><p>It was his disappointment, really, that had sent him running to see if he could talk to the bartender as Potter transferred the parchment in for examination. But of course the bartender had completed his shift, and so Draco had wandered a while, not quite sure what he was looking for, until he’d found himself back at the bar, nursing his own cowardice.</p><p>The problem is that he’s always been too delighted with Potter’s attention. He’d transmuted it into something different when they’d been at school; there would have been no way to function normally had he  acknowledged the fact that it was visions of green eyes and a crooked smile that he wanked to. Not with his father being who he was, not with the Dark Lord eventually settling in his ancestral home. Not with the expectations of his parents; those, above all.</p><p>But as adults who’d developed a tense working relationship when they’d first been paired on a case, he’d been disallowed those same delusions. He finds Potter bloody fascinating and always has. The revelation of Potter’s sexual preferences, splashed across the papers years prior, had eased some of their interactions over time into something friendly — friendly enough to complain about the press over a drink or two, at least. That it was occasionally flirtatious as well had left Draco in a state of utter disbelief that the fascination could be a mutual thing.</p><p>He thinks it was — that it is. Draco’s not fool enough to discount Potter’s obsession (justified though it may have been) with him in school, or the way they tentatively connected once Draco learned to stop being a complete tosser around him. Potter <i>still</i> watches him, in fact; his eyes linger on Draco when they run into each other in the halls, or when they’re paired for a practice duel in the training room.  He wants to take the opportunities offered, wants to let himself fall into bed with the stupidly gorgeous, reckless man who has been unsubtly chasing after his arse since the night they’d almost shagged.</p><p>Except... That night, Potter had made it clear — when he’d pressed one muscled thigh between Draco’s legs and gasped as Draco had rutted against him, fumbling with his flies — that he was interested in the night, and no longer. He’d said it hoarsely, wantonly, as though Draco wouldn’t be cracked open by the statement, just before he’d shoved his tongue into Draco’s mouth again.</p><p><i>I need to know what it’s like to fuck you, Malfoy,</i> he’d whispered. <i>Just this once. It’s been hell on my focus at work.</i></p><p>Draco would have laughed at how insulting a come-on it was if he hadn’t been so shaken by his own lust and spiralling disappointment. He’d had plenty of one-offs before, but the idea of looking at Potter in the morning, of having him or being had by him once and never again, was so patently distasteful that his erection had wilted.  He’d blamed the excessive drink and gone home, pulling back from the confusing tangle their interactions had become.</p><p>He doesn’t think Potter’s intentions are any different now. Potter is surprisingly cagey and doesn’t trust anyone beyond his small circle. He answers personal questions in the vaguest of ways, keeps things light and casual with anyone else. He’d been photographed snogging a different wizard the week after his encounter with Draco — not that he ever stopped approaching Draco with subtle innuendos, with light-hearted flirting. Potter knew, or <i>knows,</i> Draco suspects, that Draco had faltered because of his own bloody pride.</p><p>But it’s come to a head, this thing between them.  Potter’s kiss in their room, his solicitousness, his roused protective instincts… All of it has combined into the most heady, toxic sort of potion, which Draco has drunk it down, knowingly.</p><p>He grits his teeth and finishes his drink, then heads through the lodge to the front desk, where he saw the Auror from before on duty as he’d walked the grounds.  She’s alone, thankfully, a professional smile pasted on. “Can I help you?”</p><p>“Yes, thank you.” Draco smiles back genially. He lowers his voice. “We need an entire list of staff, their functions, the amount of access they have, and the hours they work.”</p><p>She nods thoughtfully, clicking buttons on the computer with such ease there’s no way she isn’t muggle-born. Even half-bloods, when raised in a wizarding household, tend to look awkward around muggle technology.</p><p>“I’ll need a few hours,” she says, her eyes moving over the screen.</p><p>“Bring it by in the morning.”</p><p>“Will do.” She passes over an extra plastic room-key card and Draco takes with a nod and another smile as though it was the reason he’d stopped.</p><p>He heads back to their room with the speed of a Flobberworm, hoping Potter will have gone to sleep, hoping he can stave off the complications of his own decision a little longer. But Draco has never been lucky, not once in his life, and tonight is no exception -- Potter is waiting, patiently sifting through documents, when Draco comes in through the door.</p><p>Draco sighs. “Anything on the translation?”</p><p>Potter shakes his head, a lock of sooty black hair falling over his forehead, obscuring his scar. “In the morning.”</p><p>“We’ll have a list of employees and their hours by then, too,” Draco says, tossing his fake key-card in the bin and dropping into a chair.</p><p>Potter grimaces. He waves his hand over the parchment spread out over the bed and watches dispassionately as it reassembles into the appropriate file-folders, then winks out of sight — presumably, into their bags.</p><p>“Enjoy your gin?” he asks quietly.</p><p>Draco snorts, but he feels strangely pleased at the echo of his own thoughts being solidified in such a perfect example. “You’re just never going to stop following me, are you? Bloody get over it, Potter; I’m on your side now, remember?”</p><p>“You were gone for a while,” Potter says without a hint of apology. “I was concerned. I went looking. It’s different.”</p><p>“I suppose.” But not by much.</p><p>Draco studies him for a moment. “When we almost fucked—” he starts, then shakes his head and falls silent as he works out what to say.</p><p>Potter straightens on the bed, muscles going taut and alert, but thankfully keeps his mouth shut.</p><p>Fortifying himself with a deep breath, Draco says, “What are you looking for, Potter? You must know that shagging will change our working relationship. Does your curiosity go so deep that you’re fine with that?”</p><p>“With you, Malfoy, my curiosity has <i>always</i> been that deep,” Potter says, voice heavy with irony. He pauses. “I thought to get you out of my system.”</p><p>The confession surprises him and Draco manages the barest of nods. “I’m aware.”</p><p>“That’s why you left.”</p><p>Draco contains the strange surge of pleasure that fills him, that Potter is so attuned to his thoughts. It’s quickly chased by something harder and darker; a kernel of bitterness he hopes doesn’t show on his face.</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong; I don’t have any desire to be <i>in</i> your system, in any way other than that,” Draco tells him. “But I dislike being used and cast aside. It’s not in my nature.”</p><p>“Right.” Potter’s breath leaves his lungs loudly; his cheeks puff out with it. “If it helps, I don’t know if it would have worked. Nothing else I’ve done has.”</p><p>“Nothing else?” Draco asks.</p><p>Potter shrugs. “Stalking you, saving your life, testifying for you. Working with you, getting to know you.” He licks his lips, face utterly at ease and in stark contrast to the seriousness of his words. “I’ve been trying to get you out of my system for a while, Malfoy,” he adds, sounding surprised.</p><p>Draco blinks. “Fuck off; you’re not allowed to confuse me <i>every single time</i> you talk!”</p><p>Potter’s mouth twitches with the trace of a smile. “I’m not being evasive.”</p><p>“Then what the hell do you mean?” Draco's palms are sweating; he feels fourteen again.</p><p>“Well,” Potter says slowly, tilting his head, “I’m not exactly sure. I want to fuck you. I think we work well together. I think we’re… friends. Right?”</p><p>Draco considers whether the occasional drink or shared plate of chips after work can be considered friendship, when Draco has tried so hard to put distance between them in the last year. Shagging someone for the experience and brushing off any personal questions almost certainly isn’t. He frowns, but gives a wobbly sort of nod.</p><p>“Well, then, I mean that,” Potter says.</p><p>“So you’re looking for…”</p><p>“Dunno. Friendship. Sex. Bonus if it’s with someone I don’t have to worry will rat me out to the papers,” Potter says honestly. “I want you. You obviously want me, too.”</p><p>Draco glowers at him. Potter’s such an arrogant prick that Draco’s brain feels itchy whenever he’s actually right. </p><p>“So I guess the question is really what <i>you</i> want." Potter stretches out, dangling his legs over the side of the bed and leaning back on his palms. It’s not an overtly sexual pose, except that Draco has been fantasising about Potter in his bed for so long, there’s really no pose that <i>can’t</i> be considered sexual.</p><p>“I’d like to sleep with you, too,” Draco admits, proud when his voice comes out smoothly. Potter’s mouth twists into a satisfied little smirk and he starts to sit up, but Draco holds up a grudging hand. He’s a Malfoy, and though his name doesn't bring him the sense of pride it used to, he can't help the twist in his stomach at the thought of being the nothing more latest scandal in the Boy Hero’s love life. “But I don’t feature being something to get out of someone’s system. Even <i>if</i>,” he stresses, “that’s not still the case, you’ve given me no indication that you want an actual friendship with me other than telling me you trust me not to call the papers and detail the exact dimensions of your cock.”</p><p>Potter snortd and scratches his nose as if acknowledging the truth of it. “Fine. Are you asking for… for fidelity? I’m not sleeping with anyone else right now. I won’t fuck around until we end it, if you don’t. We can see where it goes.”</p><p>While the phrase <i>see where it goes</i> is troublingly open-ended, it also causes an embarrassing ripple of hope inside Draco, because it indicates that Potter might not be averse to it actually <i>going</i> somewhere. If he ignores the bit about how Potter thinks it’ll end.</p><p>“So, are you talking dating or shagging?” he asks. Just for clarification, really, because at this point it doesn’t matter. He can have pride while he’s balls deep inside Potter. He can be a Malfoy as long as he’s <i>cogent</i> of what’s expected from their dynamic. And anyway, he’s so hard it actually hurts — his cock is straining at the front of his briefs — and he’ll need to do something about that, soon.</p><p>For the first time, Potter looks embarrassed. More familiarly, anger thrums beneath the surface of his expression. He flushes, cheekbones going apple-red under his spectacles. “I don’t really date,” he says, sighing. “I… haven’t been able to. And I’m not good at it.”</p><p>Draco arches a brow, examining Potter as he bites his lip. From everything he knows, that hasn’t stopped Potter from getting a leg over whenever he’s wanted to. “The press?” he guesses.</p><p>With a frustrated sigh, Potter nods. “Yes,” he mutters. Then, surprising Draco, promptly blurts, “No.”</p><p>Draco wants to ask, but Potter looks pushed to the tipping point already by the discussion. And anyway, his confusion is edged out by other things: Potter’s fluster so deeply charming that Draco's cock leaks with arousal. “Two things.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“No, three,” Draco decides. Potter's mouth quirks. “You’ll have to explain that more fully to me eventually, one. And we don’t fuck around while we’re on duty, two.”</p><p>Potter rolls his eyes. “Do you really think I’d have been flirting with you in public if it wasn’t part of our cover? No matter how badly I might want to fuck you?”</p><p>“No,” Draco says, because it's true. But Potter’s words cause a shiver of desire to zip down Draco’s spine. He sits up straighter and swallows, something Potter seems to notice, his eyes flaring with interest.</p><p>“What’s the third thing?”</p><p>“Tell me about your tattoo.”</p><p>Potter’s face closes up, turning stony. “You don’t need to know about that.”</p><p>The words splash over Draco like a bucket of ice water. He holds himself very, very still, pinned by his own dissatisfaction and Potter’s suddenly furious glare. His throat feels as though he’s swallowed a pile of dust.</p><p>“Perhaps not. But I’d like some assurance other than <i>your word,</i>” Draco says, sneering it, “that you consider me, at least, an actual friend and not one of those wizards who are photographed sneaking out of your home at three in the morning.”</p><p>“Something else,” Potter snaps, standing. “You want me so much you can barely look at me at work.  For the last year, every time we duel, every time you join the rest of us for drinks, it’s written all over your face. You want me. I’ll give you something else, for Christ’s sake. What do you want.”</p><p>It’s not the most seductive way to admit how much he wants Draco, but it’s something. Draco tries not let his surprise at Potter’s insightfulness show, and wonders how all of this got so far out of hand, Potter’s flirting, his own sullen refusals, his unhealthy curiosity. He wonders if there's a breaking point for lust, after which things like <i>doubts</i> and <i>feelings</i> no longer matter.</p><p><i>What do you want,</i> Potter had asked. Draco’s mind flashes briefly to that muggle song Pansy had teased him with in fifth year, charming his pillow to sing into his ear: <i>Potter and Dra-co, sitting in a tree…</i></p><p>Draco has blurry memories of fevered, sloppy kisses, of their soft, delighted groans mingling. He’d wanted it then, too — and managed to say no. He asks himself what’s different now, but he’s long since passed the point of ego with the man who stands across from him, vibrating with frustrated desire.</p><p>“I need to know something,” Draco admits in a low voice, throat scratchy. He wants Potter in his bed, and the words sound wrong coming from his mouth, sound like the exact things he should never say, let alone allow himself to think. But they pour out in a rapid deluge of thoughtlessness, somehow both easing and intensifying the ache in his chest he’s gotten so accustomed to. “Something others don’t. You show people one thing. Affable, heroic, Harry bloody Potter. Saviour and friend to all. No one knows-- no one <i>sees</i> how much you keep hidden. But I do. I’ve always seen the things you hide. I know you better than you think, Potter, and because of that, I can’t—”</p><p><i>Let go,</i> he means to say. But Potter is looking at him oddly, as though having just been struck by a bolt of lightning to rival the scar on his forehead, and the words fall away.</p><p>“I brought my wand,” Potter says suddenly. He turns away and heads to the window, looking out and runs a brisk hand through his hair. “You saw that I brought my holly wand.”</p><p>Draco’s stomach jangles with nerves. “I did. I saw.”</p><p>“I like having it around. I like the connection to my magic I feel when I hold it. But I’m not allowed to use it outside.” Potter sighs, a swift, loud exhalation. “I mean, I could, but I don’t. I don’t need to, but— I hate that I can’t.”</p><p>“Why?” Draco asks. It comes out as respectful as if he were approaching a wounded werewolf — respectful for how much more dangerous Potter seems in that moment.</p><p>“I can’t risk being Disarmed,” Potter says, voice cracking and unhappy. Draco wants to see his face but is afraid to move. “You know how it goes, if you are. You of all people know. The way a wand changes its allegiance.”</p><p>“This is about the Elder wand,” Draco says, going momentarily numb. The ramifications are too astonishing to even consider and his words come out as barely more than a breath, but Potter’s bare shoulders flinch and draw in a bit.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Draco stands and heads over to where Potter is standing. The skin of Potter’s back, gleaming in the low light of the lamps, shifts as his muscles grow tense with the awareness that Draco is behind him, his back  heaving slightly. Draco presses his hand flat over one of Potter's shoulder blades. His skin is so hot, Draco would wonder whether he were ill if he didn’t already know how powerful magic can affect basic biological reactions.</p><p>“Malfoy,” Potter murmurs.</p><p>“Harry,” Draco says. The name rings out like a shout, though it’s spoken softly.</p><p>Harry turns slowly. Draco keeps his hand on him while he does; it slides over Harry’s shoulder and ends up, resting, over his heart. Harry’s face is etched with conflicting emotions, but the most obvious one is… relief.</p><p>“It’s not a tattoo,” Harry tells him quietly. “It’s a brand.”</p><p>Draco kisses him.</p><p>It’s clumsily done, nothing like the smooth ease of their kiss in the restaurant or the reassuring nature of Harry’s kiss when they got back to the room after. It’s not like the instinctive, heated fumblings in the hallway of 12 Grimmauld Place.</p><p>This kiss is measured, but despite that — or perhaps because of it — it doesn't feel as simple as a kiss <i>should</i> when you’re about to sleep with someone. Draco feels the weight of it as his mouth covers Harry’s, the weight of Harry’s bewildering confession and the madness of his own want rushing through him from the simple glimpse of truth Harry shared. Their mouths bump, coasting off one another, and realign with more ease. Harry hesitates when Draco licks at the seam of his mouth, but then he opens it, and when Draco slips his tongue inside, Harry shudders and pulls him closer.</p><p>The kiss deepens, becomes more natural, slick and hot against Draco’s mouth. The room swirls around him and Draco  hears a moan but isn't sure which of them it comes from, his heart thundering is so loudly in his chest as Harry threads his hands through Draco’s hair with feverish intention. And then Harry's hands are everywhere — the heated, skillful press of them roaming and sliding down the length of Draco’s bare back to cup his arse and draw him into full, grinding contact with Harry’s thick erection. It juts out against him from under Harry’s joggers and Draco’s cock throbs with the overwhelming knowledge that Harry is— that they’re going to—</p><p>Harry pulls his mouth away. His lips are shining and swollen, his eyes dark and hypnotically focussed. “Do you bottom?”</p><p>It takes Draco a moment to process the question. His hips judder anxiously into Harry’s. His voice is embarrassingly breathless. “I—oh. Both.” He nods, dazed. “Yes. We can do that.”</p><p>Walking him back toward the bed, Harry issues a muffled laugh against his lips. “I— Yes. I’d wanted to… I’ve been having this… I thought about…”</p><p>His words fade, and they don’t matter really, not when Harry’s easing Draco down and climbing atop him, a firm, solid weight. His glasses are foggy and Draco removes them, twitching his wrist to pull his wand, then levitating them toward the nightstand.</p><p>“You’d thought about fucking me?” Draco prompts with a pointed glance when Harry continues to stare at him, eyes veiled. Draco widens his thighs deliberately. “Get to it, then.”</p><p>Harry’s hips jerk into his almost involuntarily, and then they’re kissing again, hard, hungry kisses that leave Draco dizzy and panting. He digs his fingers into Harry’s back and ruts upward against his body, tries to wrap a leg around Harry's thighs, but Harry grunts, shifting away. He drags warm, open-mouthed kisses along Draco’s jaw, down the cords of his throat and uses his teeth, scraping them over sensitive spots and biting with expertise. Harrys his hands under the waistband of Draco’s bottoms, moving away to strip them off, to wriggle his own down and kick them away.  Then he’s back again, shoulders nestled between Draco’s legs. He turns his head and bites the soft flesh of Draco’s inner thigh. Draco yelps, embarrassingly loud, even as his cock twitches, rising from where it's lying, stiff and flat, on his belly.</p><p>“I always thought you’d be a fucking tease, Potter,” Draco huffs, arching his hips.  He takes the base of his cock and angles it downward expectantly.</p><p>Harry chuckles. “Call me Harry, you prick; we’re married,” he says, and licks a slick stripe up Draco’s cock from root to tip.</p><p>Draco throws his forearm over his eyes, reconciling himself to the fact that watching Harry suck him off will result in the whole thing being over too soon. Which it might be, anyway, because—</p><p>“Oh my god,” Draco groans as Harry starts tonguing at his slit, dipping the firmed tip into it. His hand, tight around Draco’s prick, smooths the foreskin back in a slow, deliberate stroke, then pulls at it, dragging it up over the head as Harry lavishes attention over the tip with a practised tongue. Draco inhales sharply. “Just —fuck you, Harry — just… Suck it, you bastard.”</p><p>“Progress,” Harry says, sounding amused. His lips stretch over the crown and though Draco has some idea that begging would be wrong, he can’t help doing it silently. He grits his teeth and bucks upward, Harry suckling the head of his cock before dipping his head to take in more. And more and more and more until, unbelievably, his nose is brushing the curls at the base of Draco's pelvis  Draco gasps as Harry draws his head up and down, tongue moving with light swishes along the underside of his prick. Draco shifts his legs, clenching his arse to propel him further into that slick, sucking heat, and Harry obliges, relaxing his throat and bobbing his head wetly over the shaft of Draco’s prick.  A long-fingered hand fondles his balls, tugging them one by one, and Draco is unable to staunch the whine that escapes his throat. Harry makes a sound of pleased acknowledgment, cupping them both and rolling them in his palm. The light callouses there rasp against the over-sensitive skin, and Draco's balls begin to draw closer to him as Harry holds them, plays with them, his mouth sliding up and down in an excruciatingly perfect rhythm over his cock. Draco’s hand falls unthinkingly to Harry’s hair and tangles in all of those wild black strands. </p><p>Harry moans, so Draco grips him tighter, twisting the hair into his fist just as Harry’s free hand slips, slick, into the crevice of his arse. It’s lubed up already and the only thing Draco can assume — with the distant corner of his mind that’s still working — is that Harry has just performed <i>wandless, wordless magic</i> for the sole purpose of fucking him. His fingertip finds Draco’s hole and Harry rubs at it with little, flicking strokes that make Draco writhe and curl his widened legs up, baring himself completely.</p><p>Harry draws off his cock for a moment. “You like it,” he announces breathlessly, and Draco’s desire shoves over a touch to allow for reluctant amusement.</p><p>“You’re sucking me off and playing with my arse,” he says suppressing the smile that wants to break free.  “Yes, I <i>like</i> it, you utter tosser. Do it some more or I’ll murder you.”</p><p>“A choice between fucking one of the most gorgeous arses I’ve ever seen or—”</p><p>Draco sets a foot on his shoulder and nudges it forcefully. “Less chatting, more sucking,” he orders. His heart twists at the sound of Harry’s laughter, but his amusement fading when Harry obediently begins mouthing at his balls and slips a finger inside him, slow and careful, pumping it steadily deeper.  “Get me—get me open for you, yes,” Draco says, and feels more than hears Harry’s rumble of surprised arousal. "God, get me nice and wet."</p><p>Harry adds another finger, another.  Draco’s arsehole burns as it stretches, skin pulling tight before softening, but Harry shows the same dedication during sex that he does doing anything else and Draco finds himself relaxing, easing into it, bearing down against it, much sooner than he normally would. His arsehole is wet, <i>sopping</i>, and Harry screws his fingers in and out relentlessly, the tips brushing over Draco's prostate on each inner press.  It’s too much, and Draco’s cock starts to throb with familiar anticipation of an impending orgasm.</p><p>“I’m—” Draco gulps. Tries again. “Harry— Harry.  I need you to fuck me.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry mumbles thickly, pulling his fingers out with a gentle twist that causes Draco’s hips to fly up. He tumbles on top of Draco again, sliding the foot that was on his shoulder up and back until Draco’s calf dangles over it. Draco widens his other thigh, until his hipbone threatens pain from the angle. "Hey. Look at me.”</p><p>It’s an entreaty rather than an order and Draco pulls his arm away from his eyes and blinks against the sudden light. Harry hovers over him, face flushed and mouth shiny; his eyes are barely more than pupils blown wide, a thread of sea-glass green around them.  The moment stretches out and Draco feels the blunt curve of the crown of Harry’s cock prod his hole. He can’t look away, can’t make himself see anything other than his own reflection in Harry’s eyes and — beyond that — something deeper in Harry, as well.</p><p>He hisses through his teeth when Harry breaches him, despite the prep that came before. Harry’s cock is thick, opening him up wider and wider as he pushes into him with tiny little ruts. Draco grips Harry’s biceps and rocks his hips up encouragingly. </p><p>When Harry is seated to the hilt, he finally settles. He breathes raggedly for a moment, face stern and unrelenting. But his voice is soft, and breaks with a small catch when he says, “Okay?”</p><p>Draco nods, throat working silently. It’s somehow too intimate, this whole thing. Not like he’d thought it would be — facing away on his hands and knees, Harry fucking into him with ruthless strokes. The vision of it Draco's been cradling, disappears like wisps of smoke with every slow pull of Harry’s hand over his cock.</p><p>It’s <i>nothing</i> like what he'd imagind as they face each other, eyes locked and bodies connected, and Draco tries to push away the rush of something he’s gotten all too good at ignoring over the years. But linked like this it’s harder, and his chin feels suspiciously soft; his eyes sting. He turns his head to the side to break Harry’s gaze. "It’s good, yeah,” he says hoarsely. He blinks a couple of times and when his vision clears, he turns back and smirks. “Fuck me.”</p><p>Harry’s smile is filled with promise. He drags his hips back and snaps them forward, twisting them on the instroke. Draco swallows a gasp, pressing his foot into the mattress towards the sensation as Harry does it again and again, sawing his cock in and out of Draco with precise, almost mechanical proficiency. The angle pounds his cock directly over Draco’s prostate with each brutal push, and several minutes later Draco’s drifting mind snaps back, drawn to reality by a series of his loud moans. He realises that he’s outright <i>writhing</i> but has stopped doing anything beyond that to help, too lost in the pleasure snaking its way from his arse to his cock and through to the rest of his body. He’s got one hand clenched in the duvet and the other digs tight into Harry’s buttock, fingers growing slick with sweat as Harry’s rhythm picks up and his breath — hot against Draco’s face — starts to sound like a whine.</p><p>He plants his foot again and pumps his hips upward as Harry shoves his cock deeper. Does it more when Harry’s jaw clenches and he squeezes his eyes shut. “Malfoy, I swear to fuck you’d better be close because—”</p><p>With some effort, Draco releases the bedcovers and slips a hand between them. Harry comes down on his forearms, hips rocking with abandon as Draco wraps a fist around his aching cock and begins jerking it with short, sharp pumps that work in tandem with Harry’s cock sliding in and out of his arse. He takes a long pull of air and lifts up, fitting his mouth against Harry’s in a messy, wet kiss. Harry moans his name into it, Draco thinks, but he can’t be sure because his balls are drawn up so tight against his body, because Harry is fucking into his arse with his cock, fucking into his mouth with his tongue, and Draco starts to come before he realises it, as blazingly hot as the summer has been, as storm-tossed as the most broken piece of wreckage. His cock pulses so hard it <i>hurts</i> for a second as he stripes long ropes of spunk between them and coats his furiously moving fist. He cries out, shoulders pressing deep into the mattress and hips pumping up, and then Harry is no longer thrusting but grinding his cock in deeper, frantic and erratic and fucking <i>heavenly</i>. </p><p>Harry cries out. He buries his face against the curve of Draco’s neck, latching his teeth there as though he’s a damned werewolf but not sinking them in. His hips stutter and then Draco feels a new wash of warmth inside him, feels the powerful twitching of Harry’s cock against his swollen, tender inner muscles, and it spurs Draco on enough to wring out a few last drops of his own climax with a deep groan.</p><p>They lay together, breathing harshly for a several stunned moments before Harry reaches down between them, gently disengaging his body and rolling off onto his back. Draco’s leg comes down, half-numb and heavy, and he reaches up with a shaking hand to shove the hair sticking to his forehead back with a wince. </p><p>“Well?” Draco asks, still breathless from the onslaught. “Are we out of each other’s systems then?” He’s joking, of course.</p><p>He thinks.</p><p>Harry cracks a humourless laugh.  “Oh, yeah, absolutely,” he says, even as he reaches over without turning and grasps Draco’s sticky, overstimulated cock, simply holding it, in loosely-curled fingers. But his face is remote and unblinking when Draco looks over.</p><p>“Well,” Draco says lightly when Harry doesn’t go on, “at least I don’t have to worry about transfiguring the chair into a bed for one of us to sleep on.”</p><p>The fingers around his cock tighten fractionally for a moment, as though Harry’s startled by that — either by the thought that Draco had been planning on it, or by the idea that they could, in fact, sleep together.</p><p>“I--” Draco chews on his lip for a moment, hating the crack in his voice. “I mean, I still could… Of course, I’d get the actual bed.”</p><p>The silence lasts just a beat too long to be comfortable. “No,” Harry says eventually. “Not if you don’t want to.”</p><p>Well, <i>that</i> certainly implies enthusiasm, doesn’t it?  Draco relaxes his facial muscles, lest they twist into a scowl. “I don’t particularly <i>care</i>, Potter,” he snaps. “Up to you.”</p><p>“Share then.” It comes out flat. Harry releases Draco’s cock and swishes a hand at him, almost aristocratic in how bored the gesture is. The Scourgify from his fingertips is so unexpected — the warmth of it, the arousing sweep over Draco’s sensitive skin, the way it zips inside him and shimmers over his cock — that a thin moan slips out of his mouth before he can catch it. When Harry speaks again, his voice has gone gruff. “Best get in.”</p><p>If Harry assumes they’re going to fuck again after his response to the idea of sharing a bed, he’s in for a mean surprise. Draco raises a single eyebrow at him. More to make a point than anything else, Draco Summons a clean pair of pants from his case and wriggles them on, biting his lip at the twinge of pain in his arse.</p><p>He heaves himself up and crawls under the covers; the sheets have such a high thread count, Draco could almost swear they’ve been magically charmed for softness. His body aches everywhere, in that deliciously throbbing, swollen way that tends to happen after amazing sex. But his heart feels oddly tender too, as confused and twisted up into knots as it was before they’d talked, or fucked, or — bloody hell —
 after the first time they’d managed to drink together and talk for more than thirty minutes without arguing bitterly.</p><p>Harry slips in too and Draco turns on his side to face away, crowding the edge of the bed. Harry shifts, the covers rustling around them as he settles, then casts the lights out with a breathed incantation.</p><p>Several minutes pass in silence, but Draco can’t bring himself to seek sleep. His adrenaline hasn’t dropped yet, as though his body knows to be prepared for the danger that lies ahead.</p><p>“I don’t sleep with people,” Harry says into the dark. Draco's shoulders still jerk with disbelief. </p><p>“I’m supposed to be shocked by this news?” Draco rallies. “Wizards are photographed leaving your home — and vice versa — at two in the morning. You haven’t had a serious relationship since—”</p><p>“Since Ginny, yeah,” Harry finishes for him. Draco can hear the wry smile in his voice. “And look how long that lasted.”</p><p>“At least you can blame that on being gay rather than your complete lack of after-sex etiquette,” Draco says under his breath. But Harry hears it anyway and huffs out a laugh. </p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>Draco reluctantly rolls over to his other side because it’s bloody stupid — if Harry is intent on having a conversation — to not even look at him. Harry sighs a bit, scratching at his chest absently. It takes Draco a moment to realise he’s rubbing at the tattoo — or brand. Whatever it is. </p><p>“Potter, if you try to convince me that you’re not gay after fucking my arse like that, you’re dumber than you look.”</p><p>Harry’s laugh deepens and his shoulders shake a bit. A tingle of pleasure curls in Draco’s mind. “No. I just mean, I was young, yeah?  And I wanted… It was normal. My aunt and uncle were big on ‘normal’ and I guess it got into my head a bit. Thinking that being who I was could be wrong, when I already had all of these eyes on me because of other stuff. So Ginny and I— Well, I would have tried to make it work, regardless.”</p><p>There are about a thousand questions Draco wants to ask — about Harry’s mysterious, oft-whispered-about childhood, about why he and Ginevra <i>did</i> break up, about why the hell he’s sharing such things with Draco <i>now</i>, after having been on decent terms with him for so long. He doesn’t think it’s because they just slept together; if that were the case, all of the Potter One Night Stand Exclusives would be riddled with secret pillow talk.</p><p>“Why then? Don’t you sleep with anyone?” Draco settles on asking.</p><p>Harry sighs. “Nightmares,” he says briefly.</p><p>“Everyone has nightmares sometimes,” Draco says. Merlin-to-fuck if <i>he</i> doesn’t. </p><p>“My magic… surged, after the battle. Unexpectedly. It scared us both, that I might hurt her. It got really unstable afterward, and she used to sneak into mine and Ron’s with Hermione so we could sleep—” Harry swallows hard here. Draco waits with bated breath, drawing on every skill he has not to betray his shock or eagerness to know more, or even his bloody <i>presence</i> still in the room, if it might stop Potter from continuing.</p><p>Who knew that a skill learned by sharing a table with the Dark Lord would come in handy with Harry Potter, as well?</p><p>Harry’s voice goes raspy and his words flutter out fast, as though they’ve been caged and have been searching for escape. “It attacked her. It left Ron alone, left Hermione alone. But it went after Gin, because she was right next to me. I woke up and it was wrapped around her throat, great, glowing green cords of my magic, strangling her like a snake, and it took Hermione hitting me with a hex before Ginny could breathe. Like I’d done it on purpose. I almost killed her because of my nightmares.”</p><p>There are a few beats of silence before Draco realises he’s meant to respond here. It filters into his mind that Harry might be — might be <i>warning</i> him. </p><p>“That’s unfortunate,” he says at last. “But since I’m neither a seventeen-year-old child nor afraid of you, I don’t think it’ll be an issue.”</p><p>It’s not entirely true. Harry scares him far more deeply than Draco could admit to himself before this assignment. But his words seem to have their desired effect, because Harry gives a sober nod. </p><p>Draco intentionally rolls over again, presenting his back, and Harry snorts quietly. The sheets shift, and they fall asleep like that, not touching.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>The cock prodding his bare bottom is the first thing Draco becomes aware of, sometime before the sun breaks over the horizon.<p>“I’m fairly certain I was wearing boxers last night,” he mumbles into his pillow, voice grainy.</p><p>“Oh no, you must be wrong about that,” Harry murmurs in his ear. “I’m sure I would have remembered.”</p><p>Draco pushes his arse back further, feeling Harry’s stiff length press against one cheek. “My mistake.”</p><p>“I’d like to take you hard,” Harry says, in a slightly inquisitive tone.</p><p>A shiver skitters over Draco, even though he sort of feels like the question cancels out the point. Noble-as-fuck Gryffindors, determined to ask before shelling out a good, rough buggering. </p><p>“If you think you can,” Draco says, yawning. He rolls onto his stomach from his side, pressing his cheek into the soft pillowcase, and waves a hand in the air. The slide of his morning erection feels delicious against the sheets, and it doesn’t even occur to him to say no.</p><p>He expects— Well, he’s not entirely sure. Another energetic, soulful romp, perhaps. Definitely another orgasm. But not the sound of Harry hissing, not tight hands gripping his hips too hard and yanking them up so Draco’s arse is high in the air, his knees pushing hard into the mattress as he flails a bit and tries to get his wits about him, still barely awake. He doesn’t expect the way Harry spreads his arse cheeks wide, or the immediate nudge of Harry’s cock against his swollen rim. He doesn’t expect the way Harry doesn’t wait before shoving in an inch, past the resisting ring of muscle.</p><p>“Bloody fuck,” Draco groans, muffled, even as he pushes back to try and get more of Harry inside.  “A finger or two is considered polite.”</p><p>“Wanted to fuck you,” Harry grunts, sliding in a bit more. Thank Merlin he remembered to slick his cock.  “Not have tea. You said yes.”</p><p>Draco’s muscles clench automatically around the intrusion, but Harry’s prick pushes inexorably forward, quick little shoves, splitting him open. Draco has a sudden image of what it must look like, and a moan issues from his lips. With a final, forceful press, Harry is embedded completely, and he doesn’t wait before drawing away and driving in, doesn’t wait for Draco to give permission or catch up. Draco thinks he’ll die of desire as his cock plumps to full hardness and smacks against his belly with the power of Harry’s thrusts.</p><p>He scrambles a little, fingers fisting in the sheets as Harry fucks him until he’s jolted so forward by the rocking that he has to place one hand on the headboard. His knuckles whiten and he tries to keep himself in place as Harry pounds into him, gasping, his balls slapping against the curve of Draco’s arse, his thighs a warm, furred press against the back of Draco’s own.</p><p>“Do it, goddamn you,” Draco chokes, the spongy, ridged head of Harry’s cock dragging over his prostate again and again. Harry snarls behind him, plunging deep, then drapes over his back and takes Draco’s cock in a brutal fist, wanking him almost mindlessly as he grinds his own prick inside and starts to come. </p><p>Draco’s lower back dips and he ruts hard into Harry’s fist, fucking himself from both ends as Harry gasps and goes tense and unmoving but for his cock, which pulses in Draco’s arse. Draco climaxes messily with a deep groan a moment later, striping his pillow —
 which has somehow worked its way beneath him —with long ropes of come.</p><p>Harry’s chest rests against his back, slick with sweat. After a moment, he heaves himself up, gently removing his prick before giving Draco’s hip a squeeze.</p><p>“Thanks,” he says breathlessly. “I needed that.”</p><p>“No problem,” Draco returns archly, more amused than he’s willing to admit. He shoves his pillow to the floor and grabs Harry’s, stuffing it under his elbow and sinking down while his skin cools. “Can we go back to sleep before we’re on duty again?”</p><p>“That’s now, pretty much. You have time for a piss and a shower if you want, but that’s it.”</p><p>Draco turns his head to scowl at Harry, who’s put his glasses on and sits up against the headboard, flipping through their communicative Ministry file.  “How long have you been awake?”</p><p>“Just a bit. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>With a sigh, Draco heaves himself up.  “Anything?”</p><p>“The parchment was in a dead wizarding language; some archaic form of Latin,” Harry says absently, still reading. </p><p>His legs are stretched out in front of him and crossed and his cock lays flaccid against his left thigh. Draco wants to touch it and so he does, as though it’s something he gets to do all the time — fondle Harry Potter’s prick without the expectation of an immediate fucking.  His courage is rewarded with a small, swift smile before Harry’s eyes return to the parchment in front of him. Draco’s hand drops away. </p><p>“Alright then. I don’t suppose we have a translation?”</p><p>“A bit.  Something about soul-harvesting,” Harry says. </p><p>Draco considers that for a moment.  “Not Dementors.”</p><p>“No, although I thought so too at first. It’s the incantation of a spell, and—”</p><p>“Dementors are bred of Darkness and Misery, got it,” Draco finishes for him. He purses his lips and pins Harry with a look that has him raising expectant brows. He hesitates. “Granger is an Unspeakable.”</p><p>Harry’s face twists. “She is,” he says cautiously, as though Draco isn’t supposed to know.  He’s not, technically, but they all wear those same stupid robes, all work on the same floor. It’s like any time Harry almost died at Hogwarts; the whole school knew about it, though no one was supposed to mention it directly.</p><p>“We need to find out more about that stone,” Draco says. “Whatever isn’t in our own files. Soul Magic— It’s a lot darker than it sounds. Obviously, there are bonding spells and such, which is what most people associate it with. All that nonsense about soulmates. But… harvesting—”</p><p>“I know,” Harry says, voice grim.</p><p>“Do you think she’d help? See if she can find out anything?” Draco frowns. “And do we have any way of contacting her that the Ministry won’t know about?”</p><p>“Yeah, she’d help if I asked. If she could,” Harry says slowly, then surprises Draco with a sudden grin. He gestures to the muggle telephone on the nightstand.  “And as a matter of fact, we do.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>Draco half-rises to accept Harry’s kiss as he joins him at the breakfast table. It’s a relief to see him — finally. It was unnerving as fuck to find out that dinner was the only meal during which clothing was required in the formal dining room. While many people have opted to wear knickers and pants and shirts to dine, many others have not, and Draco discovered upon first entering that he was right — it isn’t the most appealing sight to behold.<p>Except for Harry, who makes Draco’s mouth flood with saliva. He’d likely be exasperated that Harry hadn’t mentioned the no-clothing-necessary breakfasts, except frankly, he doesn’t mind watching Harry walk around in tight black boxer-briefs. </p><p>“Hello, darling,” Harry murmurs with a smirk. He sits down and places a napkin over his lap. </p><p>“Hope you don’t spill your coffee,” Draco says, taking a sip of his own.  “Not much protection.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes twinkle. “Oh, did I forget to mention the dinner-only thing?”</p><p>“Yes, and thank goodness.” Draco snorts.  “I don’t know if I’d have been able to brave the dining room without these,” he says, indicating his khaki trousers and white button-down. It’s a bit hot, even with short sleeves — sweat has already caused his shirt to cling to his lower back, despite the air-conditioning — bu better than the alternative. Draco genuinely wonders how they manage to keep this place sanitary without cleaning charms.</p><p>“Well, obviously, people don’t <i>have</i> to be naked,” Harry says, glancing at the few other people who are decently covered as well. He picks up his menu. “And I enjoyed the aesthetic of you without <i>that</i>,” he adds, significantly, “quite a bit, last night. And this morning.”</p><p>Draco ignores the little, unsteady rush of pleasure. He’s certainly not going to boost Harry’s ego any further by returning the compliment. “Well?” he asks instead, lowering his voice and leaning in. “What did Granger say?”</p><p>He’d been shooed out of the room to get a table after his shower. It had been an obvious request for privacy, which might have pricked Draco’s sensibilities a bit after the previous night, but they hadn’t made each other any explicit promises except to be decent. To be friends, whatever that means.</p><p>“She’ll have something for us by the end of the day,” Harry says. “Apparently, there’s a new project on Dark items, which was all she could tell me before her tongue went Silent. She’ll figure out a way around it, though, and get us something. She has supervisory purview.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Harry’s mouth creases at the corners. “It was a good idea, to contact her.”</p><p>“You probably thought of it first,” Draco says wryly, "but decided not to put her in any unnecessary risk. Am I right?”</p><p>“Yes,” Harry says, appearing disturbed. He looks at Draco oddly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nothing.” The shake of his head is slow, as if he wants to say something more but won’t let himself.  There’s a pause — just a bit too long — and then Harry jiggles his shoulders a little, forcibly relaxing them.  He gives another minute shake of his head, and his smile grows easier. “I was thinking about today. We haven’t gotten contact notification from the seller yet, so we could do some more basic recon. The— A staff member indicated that the art class has some interesting students in it.  And then perhaps a long walk of the grounds would be good.”</p><p>Draco hates having conversations in code, particularly when someone is as bad at it as Harry apparently is. But there’s no fucking way he’s going to open up his mind to Harry’s battering form of Occlumency again. Anyway, it’s not important; obviously one of the suspects they have is in the art class, and whatever Harry meant about the walk can be explained later.</p><p>“Sounds fine,” Draco says. He nods at the server, carrying two platters over to them. "I ordered for you.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Harry’s lips curl up, pleased. He seems surprised again. For what reason, Draco has no bloody clue; they’re supposed to be married, aren’t they? They spent the night and the morning fucking, and they’re partners besides. It’s common courtesy, either way.  But the look on Harry’s face alters again, growing flat and distant. </p><p>“Something wrong with it?” Draco asks when Harry gazes down at his plate: bacon and two servings of sausage, two hard-boiled eggs and dry wheat toast with a cup of beans on the side, accompanied by orange juice and coffee. It’s not what he would pick —he much prefers his sweet porridge and full omelette; Malfoys have the metabolisms of jumpy Kneazles —
 but he knows Harry has an annoying thing about pairing high protein with carbohydrates and fats these days. He gives a wicked grin when Harry’s eyes flash up to his. “I ordered you the extra egg and sausage because you worked bloody hard last night. Eat.”</p><p>Like an Inferius, Harry reaches for the salt and pepper and seasons his hardboiled eggs, staring at Draco all the while. “Yeah,” Harry says under his breath. “Thanks.”</p><p>They eat in silence for a few minutes. Draco darts glances at Harry between bites, unsettled for some reason he can’t put his finger on. “The art class… Nudes, I suppose?”</p><p>Harry nods with a jerk of his chin, methodically eating his second slice of toast, beans piled on top.  Abruptly, he says, “I think we should split up instead, actually.”</p><p>“What?” Draco’s confusion brings a smile to his face. “We’re on our honeymoon, <i>dear</i>,” he reminds him. </p><p>“People can do separate things on their honeymoons, according to their interests,” Harry says, spearing another forkful into his mouth. He chews it slowly.</p><p>“Not— Not usually on the second day,” Draco says, though he isn’t really sure that’s true. It doesn’t sound true. Isn’t the honeymoon for shagging like bunnies and doing stupid things while glued to each other?</p><p>“I don’t like art,” Harry tells him, a bit louder, as the server comes over to replenish their coffees. The smile on his face is disconcerting. “And I know you’re not really one for hiking, so why don’t we just take this day
 — the morning, really — to explore on our own and we can meet after lunch at the hot springs?”</p><p>The hot springs are the second site for a contact-request drop that they know of — not that they’re supposed to, as they haven’t received the approval from the first yet. The server leaves and Draco leans forward again, his own smile pasted on as he hisses, “Harry, what the bloody fuck?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Harry says stonily. He finishes his hardboiled egg, chasing it with a sip of coffee, and wipes his mouth with a napkin. He eyes are on his plate, and vaguely resentful when they look back up at Draco.</p><p>Draco wants to argue, but his voice suddenly won't work. He doesn’t realise his hand has landed on top of Harry’s until Harry shakes off his touch and resumes eating.</p><p>“I told you,” Harry mutters, tone flat. Draco’s stomach sinks. “I’m no good at dating.”</p><p>“No,” Draco returns icily after a moment, contemplating him. His skin crawls with a rage he can't allow himself to express. “You certainly aren’t. In fact, it’s a wonder we ever got married.”</p>
