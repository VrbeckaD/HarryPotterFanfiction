  <i>Someone I care about a lot is fighting depression and I’d like your advice on how to deal with this. I’m doing my best, but I don’t know if it’s enough. I know that depression often gets severe enough to manifest in self harm and suicidal ideation but I don’t think they’re at that stage yet. It still worries me though. It feels like they get barely any happiness out of being alive. They’re happy sometimes but it’s always fleeting and it makes me sad because they deserve to be happy, always. They seem worlds away sometimes and it scares me. I don’t want to lose them. </i>

  <i>I know this is unexpected but I really need someone to help me figure out what to do, and I know that you’ve had friends who’ve been in similar mental situations before. How do you support someone when you care about them so much that the fear of losing them almost paralyses you? It’s too much to deal with sometimes. </i>
