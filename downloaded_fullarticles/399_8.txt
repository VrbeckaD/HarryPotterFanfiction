    <p>
  <span>Remus is seven years old when his father gives him his lyre. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looks up at Apollo, glowing with all the radiance of the sun itself, and cries tears of joy. The lyre is the most beautiful instrument he has ever seen, with a frame of gold and strings of the fibers of the heavens. It shines, and he knows without a doubt that no mortal has ever before been in possession of an instrument so fine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lyre is also very heavy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He eagerly takes it, and cries out when he drops it, his young arms too weak for the burden. It almost lands on his foot, but Apollo catches it before it can do any harm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Careful,” he says. His voice is like a ray of sunshine, warm and comforting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus sits on the nearest rock and takes the lyre once more, careful to rest it on his knee. “Thank you, Father. Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Apollo smiles. “Don’t thank me yet.” He sits in the grass and pulls out his own lyre, idly plucking at the strings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m not going to let just anyone teach my son how to play the lyre.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus’ heart soars. Moments with his father have always been few and far between, him being a god and all. But now, his father would teach him, and he would learn from the best of the best. He would be the most attentive student there had ever been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He would be the finest musician in all of Greece.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crowd before him erupts with applause. His ever-growing group of onlookers whisper to each other, sharing giddy smiles and laughs. Remus smiles his thanks, but the applause doesn’t faze him. It hasn’t meant much to him in a long, long time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It has been over a decade since his father taught him to play the lyre. The years passed and his skill grew, and soon everyone in Greece knew his name. He would go into town to play in the plaza and people would throw coins at his feet after a few seconds of listening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His music enchants people, he was quick to learn. They don’t merely enjoy a song, they fall in love with it. They can’t get enough of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first it was exhilarating. He was ten years old, and the entire town would gather to hear him sing and play. His melodies would float from his lyre, drifting through the air and the townsfolk would drink it in like it gave them life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few performances in and it became clear that Remus need not practice. He could improvise his whole set and the audience would love it just the same. He could play the same piece a million times over and no one would notice. They loved his voice and his lyre so much their ears were blinded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon word of his skill spread, and the town became a tourist attraction. Travelers came from all over Greece, all over the world, just to hear his voice once. As a child he loved it. The fame, the money, the way he could make people smile… It was a dream come true. But it became a burden. He could play the worst thing in the world and everyone would love it. He could play the best thing he had ever written, the best thing that had ever been written, and no one would notice. It all sounded the same to them. Beautiful, but all the same.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His performances now mean nothing to him. He sits on the edge of the fountain in the town square and plucks away a harmony to his song, looking out into the audience of smiling faces and feels nothing. They don’t appreciate his skill, not truly. All they hear is the voice of a god and muse’s son. They will never hear anything more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looks back at his lyre, though he knows it so well he could play it blind. His fingers dance over the strings as he sings a variation of a tune his mother once sang to him. The chorus of the song starts again and he changes the the chords on the lyre to make the melody sound strange and unfamiliar, an unsettling version of what they had just heard. He uses it to transition to a song he has written, a simple, jovial tune and the audience starts dancing along.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He searches the crowd once more. There must be over a hundred people now, all skipping in time. He slumps a little, though not enough to ruin his posture. They’re all the same. That’s been the problem since the beginning. People hear his music and are enchanted, but they all feel exactly the same way. If one person is dancing, everyone is dancing. If one person cries, they all cry. His music touches people, but he never touches an individual. They’re all the same.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Out of the corner of his eye, he notices someone. A movement. Or, rather, lack thereof. Though everyone else in the crowd is dancing, one person is standing perfectly still, arms folded. It’s almost enough to make Remus stop playing altogether from shock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man is at the edge of the crowd, leaning against the wall to a local shop. His long black locks fall perfectly around his face, which looks to be crafted by the finest of sculptors. He is the most beautiful person Remus has ever seen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus finishes the song and concludes his set, bowing graciously. The audience is still clapping even after he leaves the makeshift stage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He secures his lyre in his bag and walks towards the man. He’s the only one not clapping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man grins. “You must be Remus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed I am.” Remus scans his face, his posture. He’s clearly unimpressed with Remus’ performance, but there’s no malice behind his smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They say you’re the best musician in the world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you agree?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yet you’re not clapping.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man pushes himself off the wall, taking a step towards Remus. “Because you’re not trying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not trying. Maybe you once did, but you’re not now. Everyone loves whatever you play, so you’ve stopped trying to be good. You just let them hear what they want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How-how can you tell?” Remus should be upset, but he’s just pleasantly surprised. For whatever reason, this man can see through it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever spell they’re under just doesn’t work on me. I’m more than just a pretty face.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus smiles. It’s refreshing to hear someone not appreciate his music. “You must be Sirius.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They say you’re the most beautiful dryad in the world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius takes another step forward so they’re almost touching. He trails his hand down the strap of Remus’ bag, straightening it out. “Do you agree?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus swallows, heat rising to his face. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius smirks and turns away. “Thought so.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait!” Remus calls out, before Sirius is too far away to hear his voice. He can’t bear the thought of losing the one person who can see through his act. “Will I see you again?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That depends,” he says, slowing his steps and looking over his shoulder. “Will you start trying?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus rests his head on Sirius’ shoulder as he drives the chariot to his—no, their home. They are married. After all the festivities, overseen by Hymen, the god of marriage himself, they are finally married.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hundreds of people have joined the procession behind them, all bearing gifts from the most skilled craftsmen in the world. The townsfolk are overjoyed to take part in the wedding. Why wouldn’t they be? They are the most famous couple in Greece—the most beautiful face and the most beautiful voice. There will be talk of their wedding for years to come.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Torches light their way home, burning brightly in the night. A few flicker, but most remain steady. The night is perfectly still, not even a hint of a breeze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus takes Sirius’ hand and kisses his knuckles. “I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They pass Hymen, holding his torch high. His fire blazes brighter than any other. The fire of commitment, of love, of a life together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They pass him, and the fire goes out.</span>
