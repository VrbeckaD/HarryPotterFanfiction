    <p>Harry stared at the archway, that whispered words, seemingly to beckon him forward. He was small for his at 17, at 5'6 harry was just as tall as Hermione, his usually messy black hair grown out slightly longer, making him look a lot more younger than what he already was.</p>
<p>"You sure about this mate?"</p>
<p>Turning, he looked at his best friends, they looked at him with worry and concern, but they knew that glint in his eyes, the determination to accomplish what he sought to achieve.</p>
<p>"Positive. The ministry has decided that I'm nothing more than another Dark Lord... It's this or Azkaban," Hermione opened her mouth to protest but Harry cut across her, "In the forest, I used the stone to call for them, call for them all, but Sirius was not there!" shaking his head, he sighed and muttered, "Where ever he is... I'm going!"</p>
<p>His face was set in grim determination; Hermione was worrying her bottom lip while Ron shuffled his feet and twisted his hands. Next thing Harry knew, Hermione had flung herself at him, and had latched onto him in a tight embrace soon joined by Ron.</p>
<p>Pulling apart, Hermione half choked, half sobbed, "We'll miss you Harry."</p>
<p>"Just take care of my Godson for me, tell him of our adventures and about how brave his parents were. I may come back for him one day."</p>
<p>"You know we will mate... It wont be the same here without you here."</p>
<p>They all quickly embraced one last time before pulling apart once again, smiling sad smiles that held anticipation and excitement for one, with tears sliding down their faces.</p>
<p>"Well... This is... Good bye." With that he turned and walked straight through the veil.</p>
