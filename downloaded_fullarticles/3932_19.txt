    <p>Dear, Harry </p><p>I know your probably don’t want to hear from me. Not in a letter at least. So I'm not going to send this. I feel as though once again I have made a grave mistake. Every day that I am away from you I feel a unexplainable urge to be next you. To be next to our daughter. I thought I loved Draco. However it had become clear to me that I do not. I miss cuddling with you on the couch. Your wonderful cooking. The laughter that lights my soul on fire. Im sure when I come home tomorrow your going to call me a git and ill deserve that. I deserve to be called so much more. Your to loving, to understanding. Lately its like you trust me way to much. I know that to be false. You are not as dense as I once thought. Ive done this all before way to many time to count for you to truly trust me. You see threw me and my despicable actions. You read me like a book. I wish you wouldn’t. It makes me feel overwhelmingly guilty. I fear that this time I may have truly fucked up what we have together. I promise I didn’t mean to throw away our 7 years together. I do love you with every fiber of my being. I was misguided and confused. Draco kept insisting that we had more that it was stronger then what I feel for you. Like a fool I believed him. Im so sorry Harry. He was wrong all we do is fight. His cooking is abysmal, and the sex is horrible. I dread going to see him now. Every time where together I wish I was with you. When I saw you last night I wanted so much to touch you. To kiss you and hold you. I hope you accept me when I explain all this to you tomorrow.<br/>
Harry I love you. Im addicted to you. No matter how many times I leave I end up wanting to be with you again. </p><p>Maybe I just love breaking you.</p><p>                      Forever yours, Severus</p>
