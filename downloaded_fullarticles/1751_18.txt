    <p align="justify">"Harry, I heard the most silly rumor about you today," Ron chuckled at the dinner table as the steaks, meat pies, and mounds of corn before them magically transformed into eclairs, truffles, and other decadences. "Seamus has just told me that you're taking Luna to Slughorn's Christmas party." Ron chuckled again at the apparent ludicrity of the gossip. That is, until he noticed Harry flushing red over his goblet of pumpkin juice.</p><p align="justify">Ron's hand froze on the way to a bowl of chocolate pudding now in front of them. "Wait—" He stared at Harry incredulously. "Is it true?"</p><p align="justify">Harry reached out shamefully, filling his plate with truffles and everything else within arms reach as excuse to not answer Ron.</p><p align="justify">"It is!" Ron said indignantly, as if Harry's choice of a date was a personal insult. "You're taking <em>her?</em>"</p><p align="justify">"So what if I am?" Harry spat back defiantly, even though he completely understood Ron's astonishment. Hadn't Harry himself been astounded when he'd found himself spontaneously asking the younger student the question?</p><p align="justify">Ron didn't answer. He simply gaped at Harry as if he were insane, as if Harry had just confessed a passionate desire to kiss the giant squid. "You could've taken anyone! <em>Anyone!</em> And you chose Loony Lovegood?"</p><p align="justify">"Don't call her that, Ron" snapped Ginny, pausing behind them on her way to her friends. "I'm really glad you're taking her, Harry, she's so excited." And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean.</p><p align="justify">"I still say you're insane," Ron mumbled watching his sister's retreating form, as he seemed to dethaw and go for a large strawberry cake. "Personally, I say you should've taken Romilda Vane." He cut himself an immense slice of the cake and immediately filled his plate with other desserts. He instantly dug into it, chomping as enthusiastically as he always did.</p><p align="justify">"Romilda Vane?" Harry asked, snapping his head over to Ron so sharply, he felt it pop. He stared at the ginger just as incredulously as Ron had glared at him. "Now who's insane, eh?"</p><p align="justify">Ron simply stuffed his face heartily for a second before he answered.</p><p align="justify">"From what I've heard about her, she would undoubtedly be a more... <em>entertaining</em> date than Luna," Ron replied smugly, putting a lot of emphasis on the word as he finished up his gigantuan plate off desserts. Already.</p><p align="justify">"And what's that supposed to mean?" Harry asked dubiously.</p><p align="justify">"Well…" Ron responded lazily, stretching on the bench, having clearly had his full share of food. He lowered his voice slightly and crouched closer to Harry before continuing. "I heard from Seamus, who heard from McLaggen that she's a little extra <em>friendly</em> with the boys."</p><p align="justify">Harry scoffed. "And how does McLaggen know that?" he asked, pushing back from the table as he could see several people attempting to eavesdrop on there conversation. Ron followed him up from the table and they left the hall together.</p><p align="justify">"Well, Seamus says that McGlaggen said Romilda performed a few <em>services</em> for him last year, if you catch my drift," Ron said with a suggestive smirk as they climbed the grand staircase.</p><p align="justify">"I don't believe a word of that," Harry said dismissively. "I think McGlaggen's the kind of bloke who would make up stuff like that to make himself look him good."</p><p align="justify">"Still, surely she would be a better date than Lovegood," Ron pressed. Harry seriously doubted it. As bossy and outgoing as Romilda was, he'd rather put up with Luna's insanity. "And if what Seamus said is true," Ron continued smugly, "she just might perform a few <em>services</em> for you after the party, simply because you're <em>you</em>."</p><p align="justify">They slipped through a door hiding behind a portrait of three hags, watching a banshee perform ballet. As they sloped down the corridor hidden behind it, Harry imagined himself alone with Romilda in a deserted classroom. Even when being intimate, she would probably be just as bold and confident as she always was. She would probably try to boss Harry around, tell him where and how to stand. Or maybe she would be more obedient if she were on her knees for him—?</p><p align="justify">He had to stop himself as his brain crossed over that thought because he could already picture Romilda's dark head bobbing in front of him transforming into the long scarlet locs of Ginny's bobbing head instead, and Harry couldn't think of her like that, especially not while walking with Ron.</p><p align="justify">They mysteriously emerged on the seventh floor corridor after reaching the other end of their shortcut. Harry blushed fiercely and they made their way along to Gryffindor Tower.</p><p align="justify">"I wouldn't even know where to start if she did," he admitted. "I'd probably embarrass myself by finishing too soon."</p><p align="justify">"Yeah, I understand what you're saying," Ron agreed. "I'm a little nervous about that too, honestly. Abstinence," he told The Fat Lady as they approached and she swung forward to admit them with a curt nod. He lowered his voice again as they crossed the common room, occupied by a couple of first year girls who blushed fiercely when Harry appeared.  </p><p align="justify">"Lavender's been copping a few feels lately," Ron shared openly, to Harry's amazement, "and I think they're suggesting that she wants to try something more than snogging."</p><p align="justify">"And don't you want to?" Harry asked beaming, excited for his friend. Neither of them had ever been that far with a girl. "Have <em>you</em> copped any feels?" They climbed the stairs to the boys' dormitory.</p><p align="justify">"Yeah," Ron admitted, flushing scarlet. "She's really soft and…" Ron simply blushed harder and didn't finish the statement. "I want to do those things with her, I <em>do</em>. But like you said, what if I embarrass myself by finishing too soon?" An expression of horror crossed his face as a thought occurred to him. "Or worse, what if spill in my trousers before we even get that far?"</p><p align="justify">They entered the thankfully empty dorm room. Dean, Seamus, and Neville were all still clearly down at dinner. That or they didn't know as many useful shortcuts as Harry, which come to think of it, they probably didn't as Harry's source of information was his map, something they did not have.</p><p align="justify">"If only we could practice somehow," Ron said, thoughtfully as they flopped down on the end of Harry's bed.</p><p align="justify">"Yeah? Who are we supposed to practice with?" Harry scoffed. "Each other?" he added, his voice thick with sarcasm.</p><p align="justify">But Ron was surprisingly silent for a second, as if he were actually contemplating Harry's jibe. "We could," he said straight-faced. "I mean, it's actually kind of smart, if you think about it."</p><p align="justify">Harry stared blankly at Ron. He couldn't be serious…. Then he smiled and scoffed again, this time so hard he was surprised he didn't see bogies flying. "Come off it. Are you suggesting we blow each other?" he asked, smirking in disbelief at the ridiculousness.</p><p align="justify">Ron's face remained as straight as a board. "I guess so, yeah," he responded with a casual shrug. "Do you want to embarrass yourself with a girl?"</p><p align="justify">Well… No. Harry didn't particularly fancy the idea of embarrassing himself in front of Ginny. And the only way to avoid was that practice, as Ron had said. Who else would be willing to do this with him? Harry looked over at his friend.</p><p align="justify">"Are you serious right now?" he asked, his face now just a placid as Ron's.</p><p align="justify">"Completely," Ron pressed ardently. "I want to go there with Lavender, but I'm so nervous. <em>You</em>, on the other hand, are my best mate so I don't care if you laugh at me for coming too soon."</p><p align="justify">Well, when he said it like that it did make sense. Harry probably <em>would</em> laugh if Ron came too fast, as Ron would undoubtedly do the same to him. But Harry found that the thought of Ron laughing at him over the matter was trivial compared to a girl—Ginny—laughing at him for the same reason.</p><p align="justify">"Well you've got a point so… okay then I guess," Harry said with a shrug as casual as Ron's had been, as if they were agreeing to exchange chocolate frog cards and not something as intimate and personal as blowjobs.</p><p align="justify">"Oh," Ron said in disbelief. "Well okay then. Shall we do it now?"</p><p align="justify">"Well," Harry said with another shrug, "we're not doing anything else."</p><p align="justify">"Well okay then," Ron repeated, a little more confidently, the reality of the situation apparently sinking in. They were actually going to do it. "Let's not do it here though. Seamus or someone could walk in."</p><p align="justify">"Right," Harry agreed in a graceless attempt to remain nonchalant.  </p><p align="justify">And that's how they found themselves in the nearest unused classroom to Gryffindor Tower, the same room Hermione had set the canaries on Ron, a detail that didn't slip passed either boy.</p><p align="justify">"<em>Colloportus</em>," Harry mumbled timidly. "Don't want anyone bursting in accidentally like last time."</p><p align="justify">"Right," Ron said, now standing awkwardly tense in the middle of the room, clearly uncertain of how to proceed. "So how should we do this?"</p><p align="justify">"I'll go first?" Harry had intended to sound confident as he stepped over to stand directly in front of Ron, but the statement had inadvertently come out sounding like a question.</p><p align="justify">"Er… okay," his eyes widening in shock and red creeping up his neck. Clearly he hadn't been expecting to perform first. His large yet clumsy hands fumbled with Harry's zipper.</p><p align="justify">"Wait no," Harry said hastily grabbing the hands. Ron's eyes flicked to Harry's.</p><p align="justify">"Do you want to stop?" he whispered, though the room was empty other than themselves.</p><p align="justify">"No," Harry stumbled awkwardly. "That's not—I mean—I meant shall I do <em>you</em> first?"</p><p align="justify">"Oh!" Ron blushed even harder and fumbled with his own zipper instead as Harry lowered himself to his knees before his mate. Biting his lower lip resolutely, Harry assisted Ron unfastening his trousers with surprisingly steady hands, and then with a firm tug he pulled them and Ron's pants down his thighs a tad causing the ginger boy to gasp and jerk slightly in shock.</p><p align="justify">And that's how Harry got his first sight of a stocky, Ronald Weasley penis. </p><p align="justify">Ron was a tall and rather sturdy bloke so it made since that the rest of him would be... <em>proportionate</em>.</p><p align="justify">And proportionate he was. The large prick sprang free from Ron's pants, already semi erect where it brushed against Harry's parted lips. For a moment, Harry simply took in the sight of the impressive display before him.</p><p align="justify">Immediately, he noted Ron's larger size. But of course, Ron was larger in stature than Harry as well. Harry then noted the lack of freckles on this portion of Ron's body and wondered if he was the first person to witness the spotless area. He then noted the smell of Ron. A woodsy aroma permeated from him, dominating Harry's senses in an almost intoxicating way. If the word 'burly' had a scent, Harry figured it would be similar to this. It wasn't necessarily a bad scent, nor was it good. It simply smelled like Ron.</p><p align="justify">Harry watched the thick member slowly but steadily grow to its full extent without any physical stimulation from either of them. It grew until it was throbbing, pink, and swollen, resting beneath a small, thin patch of ginger hair and pointing directly at Harry's still parted lips, almost touching them. Then Harry flicked his eyes up and green orbs met blue.</p><p align="justify">For a moment, both boys simply stared timidly at each other, drawing short, terse breaths with Ron trembling occasionally from the feel off Harry's warm exhales on the tip of his prick.</p><p align="justify">"Are you ready?" Harry whispered.</p><p align="justify">Ron nodded stiffly, looking down at Harry.</p><p align="justify">With a final deep, steadying breath, Harry broke eye contact, staring once again at the prick of his best friend. He then gracelessly placed his hands on Ron's hips and sucked the hard member into his mouth.</p><p align="justify">Ron gasped, causing Harry's to peer back up, where Ron simply stared back down with a wide-eyed, awe-filled expression. They only watched each other for a second before Harry looked back down to focus on what he was doing. He knew that he completely lacked the necessary skills to perform this action, but he was aware that his teeth wouldn't feel pleasant, so he tried to prevent them from contacting Ron's skin and though the appendage was rather girthy, Harry thought he was relatively successful.</p><p align="justify">He was also aware that he was supposed to do more than simply put the prick in his mouth. There was a certain amount of suction and movement involved on his part. So Harry hollowed his cheeks and bobbed. He was thoroughly surprised to find that he could fit most of the sizable rod into his mouth. The heavy weight of it slid across his tongue and down his throat a bit.  </p><p align="justify">Ron swore, his voice so tight he sounded as if he were being strangled. "Harry, I'm going to come."</p><p align="justify">Harry abruptly popped off and glared up at him, speaking sternly, almost in a Hermione-ish way. "No. Not yet. Think about McGonagall in her knickers."</p><p align="justify">Ron's face contorted with disgust and he actually shivered from the fowl thoughts before he nodded for Harry to continue. Ron's prick was just as hard and throbbing as before and Harry knew that, despite any efforts, Ron couldn't last much longer. Harry could see his face still twisted from the disturbing thoughts of a certain indecent professor, but nonetheless, after a few more suctioned bobs, Harry found a string of choice swear words filling the room as a string of warm, thick liquid filled his mouth, flowing heavily from the tip of Ron's fat prick.</p><p align="justify">For moment, Harry simply rested there on his knees, startled to find his best mate's boy juice spilling into his mouth. It was a salty foreign substance and Harry wasn't quite sure how he felt about it. But before he could wrap his mind around the new sensation, his eyes widened in surprise as suddenly, like they were moving on their own accord, Ron's hands abruptly snapped up to hold Harry's head in place and he unwittingly, almost instinctively thrust into Harry's mouth, pulling the last bits of his load out. Ron swore loudly, grunting Harry's name, as his hips snapped forward in sharp, pumping jabs that fortunately didn't gag Harry. Then, with one final elongated thrust, he released Harry's head and let the softening member plop from his mouth.</p><p align="justify">With a resolute swallow, Harry peered up at his friend, astounded by what had just occurred and for a moment they were simply two heaving boys watching each other. But then, a smirk from Harry broke the tension.</p><p align="justify">"What was it? Thirty seconds? That was pathetic," Harry chuckled.</p><p align="justify">Ron scowled, though Harry could tell he wasn't too put out by the comment.</p><p align="justify">"Like you'd've done any better," Ron snapped back jovially, red creeping up his neck as bits of wispy residual come dripped from his spent prick and he tucked himself back into his pants.</p><p align="justify">"I'm sure I'll do better than thirty seconds," Harry responded with a cheeky grin as he climbed to his feet. "It's my turn now."</p><p align="justify">Instantly, trepidation replaced all emotions on Ron's face. He shuffled on his feet for a second before he hesitantly lowered himself to his knees before Harry, and unfastened the smaller teen's trousers. Then, with a much less determined tug, he snatched them down along with the pants under them.</p><p align="justify">Harry's cock popped out into the room with much contrast from Ron's. Unlike the ginger's peachy, pink flesh, Harry's prick was almost pale, and notably smaller, though just as hard and swollen. And where Ron's prick rested under thin red colored fuzz, Harry's was nestled beneath a thick patch of bushy, dark hair.</p><p align="justify">Ron peered up with a solid look of stoicism. He tenderly placed his hands in Harry's hips.</p><p align="justify">"You ready?"</p><p align="justify">Ron gave a stiff, determined nod. Then he broke eye contact and leaned in. Harry's breath came to him in short bursts of anticipation. It was happening. Oh mother of all things—</p><p align="justify">Then there it was. Harry was in Ron's mouth. And he instantly understood why Ron had emitted such an exuberant gasp earlier because—</p><p align="justify">"<em>Wow…</em>" was the only the only word Harry's mind could form. His prick was in a warm mouth… It was almost unbelievable. And then Ron moved, sucking and bobbing his head in a way that intensified the pleasure so immensely Harry's knees almost buckled.  He wrapped his arms around Ron's head to ground himself as Ron sucked on.</p><p align="justify">Harry could only tremble and grunt and gasp and—and then he was coming. It had abruptly crept up on him. So suddenly Ron gagged on it, pulling off to breathe properly and receiving several ropes of Harry's come in his face as a result.</p><p align="justify">For a second Ron simply glared up at Harry with spunk running down his cheek. He glared so intensely that Harry thought Ron might punch him. Then a smile breached the corner of Ron's lips.</p><p align="justify">"I don't think that was quite thirty seconds," he said, his tone heavy with sarcasm as a bit of Harry's come dribbled onto his lips and Ron habitually swiped it away with his tongue evidently without realizing exactly what it was he was licking from his face.</p><p align="justify">"Here let me—" Harry retrieved his wand from his robes and performed a quick Cleaning Charm on Ron's face.</p><p align="justify">"Thanks mate," Ron said smiling and climbing to his feet. "But it looks like the both of us could use some more practice."</p><p align="justify">"Yeah." Harry smiled back. "We'll have to practice again sometime."</p>
