<p> </p>
<p>"Candy stores at the end of October!" Hermione exclaimed as she made her way through the noisy store. It was packed to the rafters, no kids in sight as adults tried to get their last minute candy shopping done.</p>
<p>Hermione, usually the more organised, had left it too late, now she was condemned to go shopping on October 31st, no need to say the place was packed. She ventured from the ministry out to the Muggle district of Westminster, she promised Hugo and Rose she would get special stuff from the pop up Halloween candy store, a mother's heart was the biggest there was. She checked her basket, assorted chocolates, candied fruits shaped as brains, confection galore.</p>
<p>Hermione made her way to the till, standing in line, a long one mind. She stared at her watch as her stomach growled, shopping during lunch break was a stupid thing to do, she took her smart phone from her pocket, scanned the neighbourhood for a suitable place to pick up a sandwich, locating such a place two streets further, she could make it down there before heading back to her office. She had no appointments but still diligence felt good to her, no need to skip work or be tardy.</p>
<p>She walked the street, opening her shopping bag as she bumped into a rock solid figure.</p>
<p>"Ouch, oh excuse me... I was counting my candy and..." stopping in her apologies. Hearing a chuckle. Her eyes squinted as she peered up, she couldn't make the figure out as the sun stood behind him, the low Autumn sun, blinding her.</p>
<p>"No need to apologise, I wasn't looking where I walked, I tried to unscrew the lid of my coffee." The enormous man said. His coffee splashed all over the pavement.</p>
<p>"Oh, gods I'm so sorry for spilling your coffee." She felt stupid. "I know you." She said slowly.</p>
<p>Blond tousled hair, rumbling, devilish amused eyes.</p>
<p>"I think you do. Little witch." The figure resembling a Knight stated.</p>
<p>"Rowle?" Hermione questioned.</p>
<p>"The one and only, Granger." He replied with another chuckle.</p>
<p>His laughter struck a chord with her, one she was sure had no place between them.</p>
<p>"Again sorry for your coffee, can I get you a new one, I was about to get a sandwich from the shop around the corner." Hermione looked on the pavement, recognising the shop's logo.</p>
<p>"No need, I get you feel uncomfortable around me." He sensed her distress.</p>
<p>"I don't feel uncomfortable, you have to let me redeem myself, knocking your coffee from your hands." Now why did she insist, she had her escape right there. She scolded herself. The former Death Eater, childhood tormentor and very fit bloke, she had no place asking him for a coffee.</p>
<p>"If you're sure you want to then lead the way, little witch." He held his arm showing her where to go.</p>
<p>Hermione started to walk towards the coffee shoppe, she was hyper aware he walked closely behind her, his body heat emanating against her back. She felt all giddy, skipping would be a bad thing right? As the neared the shop she asked him what coffee he preferred and if he liked a sandwich? She wanted to buy one and eat it in the park nearby. He told her he felt peckish and wouldn't say no to her offer. They made their way into another crowded premise, what was up with people today cramming into local businesses. It must be the nicest warm Autumn day they experienced in years.</p>
<p>Again Thorfinn stood close behind her, she knew they formed a rather weird couple, she rather petite, smartly dressed, he a rugged disheveled Warrior, larger than life, scruffy, sporting this MUggle Grunge look and dead handsome. She felt mediocre with her pleated skirt and penny loafers, her hair crammed into a neatly pony tail.</p>
<p>"Which sandwich do you prefer?" Hermione pointed at the vitrines.</p>
<p>Thorfinn hunched over her to get a good look. He pointed towards a vegetarian wrap.</p>
<p>Hermione tried not to laugh, feeling him press against her buttocks, how was it possible that such a large man ate a vegetarian wrap?</p>
<p>"What?" He shrugged. "They do a mean mayonnaise on that one." His low voice resonated, sending a thrill through her body.</p>
<p>"Is fine, I'll try it." Hermione laughed, he was his funny self again, he could be so endearingly innocent when he wanted to be. "Two vegetarian wraps to go, one herbal chai latte and? Which coffee again, Finn?" Bloody murder she called him Finn, not Thorfinn, not Rowle, Finn, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>"Same as you little witch." He murmured in her hair. She was beautiful when flushed, he pretended not to hear her calling him Finn, he liked that, the woman was too pretty. She was a feisty little thing. He remembered when she put a petrificus totalis on him in another coffee shop more than a decade ago. He had trouble keeping his hands to himself, he so wanted to touch her rounded globes, he inadvertently stumbled into her as another customer tried to squeeze past. He allowed it to happen, pushing him required strength, he was massive, but for now it suited him. His hand landed on said buttocks, confirming what he guessed firm and very rounded.</p>
<p>Hermione glanced behind her, he pushed against her, he braced himself against her rear, he squeezed her flesh a tad bit, sending another tremor to her intimate area. Her gut reaction was scolding him, she didn't. Denying it felt good grew tiresome.</p>
<p>Hermione reached the till, picked up her tea to go and a small paper bag filled with napkins and their wraps.</p>
<p>"Here, little witch let me." Thorfinn rumbled. The woman was carrying her candy bag and a rather large handbag, she could let him carry their lunch.</p>
<p>Hermione took him up on his offer handing over the goods, brushing his fingers when she handed their lunch over. Gods she had trouble not too blush, when did acting like a giddy teenager come over her? She scurried past, leading the way to the park she saw on her phone. The secluded area appeared at the end of a cul-de -sac. The pair ventured quite a bit into the park as benches were taken by others, they found an empty bench in a secluded part.</p>
<p>Hermione sat down with a sigh, her feet were being a nuisance, kicking her shoes out, tucking her feet under her, she inadvertently leaned towards Thorfinn. He handed her her tea and wrap. Hermione was famished, tucking in as she pulled the wrapper aside. "Mmmmm." She devoured the delicious treat. That mayonnaise was as heavenly as Thorfinn said it was.</p>
<p>He nodded at her with a wink as she looked up to her side, giving her 'I told you so'—look.</p>
<p>They sat silently as they ate their food, sipping their tea.</p>
<p>Hermione let her posture loosen, finding Thorfinn's side as sturdy and soft. Hermione scrunched her wrapper together forming a ball, dabbed her mouth with a napkin, throwing the ball and napkin in the paper bag. "Haven't seen you around for a while Rowle."</p>
<p>"We're back to last names then?" Thorfinn smiled his white teeth bare.</p>
<p>"Yes, well... here wait you have something sticking in your beard." Hermione reached up, removing a bit of lettuce.</p>
<p>Thorfinn, grabbed her hand. It was a small hand, how could such a powerful with have such a dainty frame? His eyes landed on her dark brown eyes, he felt that same whirl in his abdomen.</p>
<p>"And you Granger where have you been hiding?"</p>
<p>"It's Granger-Weasley." She replied.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes how could I forget, you're married to the ginger auror." Thorfinn's eyes darkened.</p>
<p>"Yes I am." Happily she should have added but didn't. "I'm working as a senior project advisor at the Ministry for dark artefacts, Where are you holed up?"</p>
<p>"I own an artist studio, I'm a sculptor." Thorfinn said.</p>
<p>"You are?" She never would've guessed. Who would have guessed, nast Death Eater turning artist.</p>
<p>"It wasn't easy to find a job after the War, so I went into sculpting. I own a small studio not far from here. Being a Death Eater wasn't what I should have gotten into, adventure and bad influence, not trying to excuse myself. It's how it is."</p>
<p>"Oh, gosh." Hermione inconspicuously looked at her watch, or so she tried.</p>
<p>"You're late for work?" Thorfinn regretted that, she had to keep office hours undoubtedly.</p>
<p>"Half an hour or so." She smiled. She never played hooky.</p>
<p>"Shame." Thorfinn stood up. It was better this way, she was married with two children, children she bought Halloween candy.</p>
<p>"Never mind, I can walk you back to your studio, I don't mind being late."" Reaching under the bench for her shoes, revealing the skin below her jumper. She was never late, she never ventured out much any way. She decided keeping him company wasn't that big a deal, he looked lonely.</p>
<p>The large man, looked at her small back, she was tiny, he wanted to caress her skin, he suppressed his urge. He so enjoyed her company he didn't meet a lot of wizarding folk in his new line of business. He was kidding himself, she wasn't just any old wizard. She was Hermione Granger, War Heroine extraordinaire, a very pretty one at that. He stood up, holding his hand out to help her up. She accepted. They held hands a brief moment. Enough to exchange a tingling sensation.</p>
<p>"Thanks Finn."</p>
<p>There it was again, a sense of familiarity passing between them. They walked towards another exit, gravel crunching under feet as words were not needed. Autumn leafs paving their way, sending a symbolic sense of detachment, the bubble surrounding them as they weren't enemies, married, happily or not.</p>
<p>"This is my studio." He pointed at steps leading up to a Georgian town house.</p>
<p>"Can I come up?" She asked tentatively, taking his hand as he almost walked up.</p>
<p>He turned to look at her, his blue eyes darkened. "That's not wise, my little witch." He said softly, as he stepped closer.</p>
<p>"Why?" She knew why, she did, tension between them flamed, as his stomach brushed her breasts.</p>
<p>He leaned down to her ear. "I would undress you and fuck you up against the wall of my entrance hall, that's why."</p>
<p>Hermione swallowed as his breath caressed her ear, his promise fuelling the flame below her navel. She swallowed hard. "What if I want you to?" Her voice hoarse.</p>
<p>He moved his lips towards her mouth, "I would say let's not waste any more time." He licked his lower lip before he pulled her lower lip between his teeth, softly caressing her flesh with his tongue. A soft moan left her mouth.</p>
<p>Hermione felt butterflies erupting inside her stomach, as he slightly hurt her bottom lip. She was in for a ride.</p>
<p>Thinking about it later she had no sense how they got up the flight of stairs and inside the building, all she remembered is the staring contest that went on between them as he as promised, pinned her against the wall. His dark blue eyes filled with lust drinking in her hot chocolate ones.</p>
<p>"Tell me not too." He broke the silence. "Tell me little witch." He stepped between her legs, snaking his arm behind her, pulling her up to his face. "I'm going to fuck you so hard, baby."</p>
<p>Hermione brought her ankles together, locking herself around his hips. "I'm not going too." Her voice filled with equal lust. Inside her head her goody two shoes self, screaming at her to push him. Tell him no, tell him no, her inner voice screamed.</p>
<p>He pulled at her woollen jumper, taking it over her head, her white blouse came forth, revealing a cotton white bra, he pushed his hand under it, his hand holding her soft mount. He nipped her lips as he kneaded her flesh, her nipple came to live, poking inside his palm. His tongue went inside her mouth, swiping hers she tasted like chai, spicy and sweet at the same time. "Oh fuck, little Witch forgive it's been a while."</p>
<p>"Me too." She acknowledged.</p>
<p>He arched his brow.</p>
<p>"What can I say, not so into it?" She answered demurely.</p>
<p>"Bollocks!" His hand went between them, pulling up her skirt, pulling her knickers aside, pushing two fingers inside her. "You're fucking drenched, not so into it, my arse. Your husband doesn't appreciate a good thing." He pushed his fingers in deep.</p>
<p>"Oh?" Hermione moaned as she came instantly around his fingers.</p>
<p>"Babe you were long overdue I gather." Thorfinn smirked, as he closed his lips over hers, Hermione milked his tongue as she came down from her high.</p>
<p>Her fingers went down to his trousers, unbuckling his belt, unfastened his button up jeans, her hand went inside his boxers, enclosing his hard on in her hand. "Put in, Finn, put your dick inside me..." her eyes pleaded with him.</p>
<p>Thorfinn, hoisted her up with one arm, lowering her on his length. "You're tight Witch."</p>
<p>"Sgood." Hermione moaned, he was rather well endowed, her flesh engulfing him, he was a tight fit.</p>
<p>Thorfinn, bounced her on his hips, pushing in and out, holding her under her bum and behind the small of her back. He kissed her neck, her breasts, her mouth, anything he could reach.</p>
<p>Hermione had her arms around his neck, bracing herself as he brought her to her second wave, her womb contracted as her lips clamped down on his cock.</p>
<p>He couldn't contain himself as he spilled himself inside her, long hot spurts filling her up. "Yess, little one that feels so right." He cheered her on.</p>
<p>As they were done he didn't let her go, staying inside her as he carried her up the stairs, it was far from over.</p>
<p>He undressed her lay her on his bed and started kissing her ankles, the insides of her legs, up her thighs until he reached her rosy flesh, he couldn't care tasting his own cum as he started to lick her labia.</p>
<p>Hermione glanced down at the enormous wizard as he devoured her, making her cum a third time. She couldn't believe she lay here in bed with him, her childhood nemesis.</p>
<p>Thorfinn revelled in tasting her, she was a sweet little thing, responsive as hell, writhing and moaning his name. Gods he could do this permanently, maybe he could set up tent between her legs.. speaking of which, he was rock hard again. He flipped her over, put a cushion under her hips and pushed a finger in her back side.</p>
<p>"Ooooow, Finn?" She tightened her buttocks.</p>
<p>"Ssssshh, no relax baby, it 'll be worth it let me." Thorfinn cooed, kissing her neck, he knew where her spot was.</p>
<p>Hermione relaxed as he nibbled her lobe, feeling him push another finger inside her, he loosened her muscle. It felt strange, no one had ever gone there, Ron certainly wouldn't. It felt good and naughty at the same time.</p>
<p>"Scorgify." Thorfinn uttered, he dribbled lube on her butt. He nudged his head at her entrance, pushing slowly. He needed her to adjust to him.</p>
<p>"Oh my gods!" It stung and it was heavenly, he lodged in deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>"Good girl. Nice and easy huh." He slowly moved in and out bringing him and her closer to the edge. She was such a snug fit, edging him on to his second release.</p>
<p>Hermione felt him spill his seed once again, she didn't think it was possible, but she saw stars as he let her peak again.</p>
<p>They fell asleep, entangled in each others embrace, he spooned behind her, pressing his nose in her unfastened hair.</p>
<p>Hermione startled awake, glancing at her watch. It was five o'clock, shit, she had to get home, her children were waiting for her to go trick or treating. She moved from under Thorfinn's arm. Tip toeing as she gathered her clothes, retrieving her wand from her bag, cleaning herself as good as she managed without a shower. She glanced back at the rugged Knight sprawled on his bed, she could still feel his scratchy beard between her legs. He gave her a hell of an experience.</p>
<p>It was almost dark when she apparated to the Wizarding neighbourhood in London.</p>
<p>She felt the wards of her home ripple over her, she was a curse breaker, Ronald an auror, they had extensive wards on their home.</p>
<p>As she opened the door she sensed it was rather quiet inside, no Rose or Hugo greeting her, trying to peek inside her shopping bag, it felt weird.</p>
<p>"Rose? Hugo?"</p>
<p>"Hey Mione, where have you been?" Ron stood inside the entrance hall. His face set on storm.</p>
<p>"I went shopping to buy some Halloween candies." Hermione put her bag on the floor, reached over to Ron, kissing him on his cheek.</p>
<p>"I floo called your office they said you went out for lunch and your phone was switched off."</p>
<p>He caught her on her lie.</p>
<p>"I well I ate lunch in a park and forgot about the time so I stayed out of the office, I needed some time to think." She didn't want to look him in the eye. "Where are the kids?"</p>
<p>"They're with Ginny and Harry, they're taking them trick or treating. " Ronald came closer, wrapping her up in a hug. "I"m glad you thought about our conversation, I went ahead and reserved our spot at the Samhain fertility fest, that's what we discussed right?"</p>
<p>"Uh, yes, right I did." She forgot about his plea, he wanted another child with her, they forgone love making a couple of months to prepare for this. They never talked about it for weeks, she forgot about it as they worked so much, taking care of the children and live generally.</p>
<p>"I laid your garments out on the bed, take a shower our port key is ready in an hour.</p>
<p>Hermione went up, dreading what was to come. Her mid day romp with Thorfinn freshly ingrained in her head.</p>
