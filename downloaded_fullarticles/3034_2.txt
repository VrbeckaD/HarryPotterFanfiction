    <p>I own none of these characters; they're all the brilliant creation of JK Rowling and I'm just lucky enough to get the chance to play with them a bit. Thanks to Gracie for being my first beta - you're awesome - and to Ang, Whit, Sharon Juliet, Stephen, Laura &amp; all the Hoopers for being the only people on Earth that understand my Potter obsession, because you share in it with me! I love you guys and I hope I can do our mutual love justice!</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>As noon approached, early July sunlight peered curiously into Ronald Weasley’s room, questioning his desire to stay in on such a beautiful day. After all, if this were a couple of years ago, a day like today would be perfect for Ron to grab his Cleansweep and go see which of his brothers or Ginny would be up for a game of Quidditch.</p>
<p>Today he didn’t see the point. There wouldn’t be Quidditch this year.</p>
<p>Last year, he would have been beyond disappointed about that. This year, while it was disappointing, the thought didn’t upset him as much as the fact that he had been so close to being with Hermione in the past year and he blew it. He blew it for Lavender Brown, no less.</p>
<p>Well, maybe, given the timing and the state of things in the world around them, it wasn’t the worst thing that could happen.</p>
<p>Yes, maybe, if there was any bright side to all the horrible things that had been happening, it was that there was now a good reason for Ron’s delay in getting things going with Hermione. Now wasn’t the time. Ron didn’t soon forget how weird it was for Harry to kiss a girl in the middle of her crying. And, no, Ron knew it - the first time he kissed Hermione Granger, she wouldn’t be crying.</p>
<p>The first time he kissed Hermione Granger…now that was being awfully optimistic for someone who, in the course of a year, managed to almost have a date with her, ditch it to snog a girl he barely cared about for months, and temporarily lose her friendship to the point where he had to get himself nearly poisoned to win it back. The thought of managing to kiss his best friend – managing to kiss Hermione – was not something he should feel optimistic about anytime soon.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the fact he knew that she’d have to be completely mental to give him more than a second of her thoughts after all he’d done to her in the past year, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of hope. He couldn’t let the memory of that one particular afternoon at the lake slip his mind…</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>In a quiet spot on the grass at Hogwarts, far away from the remaining visitors at Dumbledore’s funeral, Harry was gazing across the lake. Leaning against a thick tree a couple of feet apart from Ron and Hermione, who, even at a time like this, managed to fumble through one of her many thick books looking desperately for “more information,” he just sat, not saying much of anything. Just a few minutes ago, the three had talked rapidly about the upcoming year, and it seemed to have tired all of them out to the point that they just wanted to sit and relax.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Ron felt a strange sort of relief about it. He needed time to process the many things that they’d already discussed. What else was there to say, anyway? Dumbledore was gone, they wouldn’t return to Hogwarts next year, Harry decided to ditch Ginny (which gave Ron an odd enough feeling in his gut without having to discuss it), and the three of them would be spending the next year or more on a hunt for Horcruxes with no clue as to where they should begin.</p>
<p>Silence was, most certainly, golden.</p>
<p>The only thing resembling a conversation was the occasional unspoken interaction Ron had with Hermione. When Harry would shift or look as though he were about to say something, Hermione, in her usual quest to get other people to share their feelings, responded instantaneously, managing to turn away from her book in order to shift her gaze to Harry in concern. Ron would give her a look to remind her that, if he wanted to talk, he would, and she didn’t have to press him for information.</p>
<p>She knew what that look meant.</p>
<p>Just like he knew exactly what she was thinking when she glanced anxiously over at Harry.</p>
<p>Then she would glance back down into her book and follow Ron’s unspoken advice.</p>
<p>No words needed to be spoken anymore; they simply knew each other that well.</p>
<p>After a while, the routine of trying to get Harry’s attention and failing got to be tiresome. The hum of the voices several yards away and the peaceful, lulling sound of the lake steadily moving also seemed to exhaust the three of them further. Ron followed Harry’s gaze beyond the water, staring at the sky innocently looking back at them as though none of them had a care in the world. Ron remembered previous years, looking out at the same landscape, his only concern being the fact that he would have a few weeks away from Hogwarts, from Harry…from her…</p>
<p>And then he felt it.</p>
<p>A very soft weight fell against Ron’s shoulder. He could tell right away what it was; could almost see the mass of Hermione’s soft brown hair from the corner of his eye without having to turn and look at it. Very slowly, he peeked to see that, much to Ron’s surprise, Hermione was now too exhausted to look at her book anymore. She had fallen asleep and had chosen his shoulder as her pillow.</p>
<p>Very careful not to stir her into a wake, Ron took a moment just to look at her. Yes, he could look…just as long as Harry’s gaze was fixed on the distant landscape and his mind was just as far away.</p>
<p>She looked so peaceful. The worry etched all over her face moments ago had drifted away and she looked as though she felt perfectly safe, perfectly content, lying there against him as they both leaned against the same huge tree trunk. He realized he could do that for her; even if it was just for a few moments of sleep, even if it was just because he was the person who happened to be sitting beside her - he helped to bring her to the state of tranquility she was now in.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew suddenly, and Ron cursed it under his breath, hoping that it wouldn’t distract Harry enough to direct his attention to Hermione’s current position or nudge Hermione away from him. Harry seemed as oblivious to the wind as he was to the two of them, and it seemed that he, too, was drifting off to sleep. Hermione let out a bit of a whimper and her eyelashes fluttered very lightly, but she didn’t move otherwise. Her head stayed rested upon Ron’s shoulder, which was, for the first time, happy to be falling asleep.</p>
<p>Feeling a sudden impulse, Ron turned his eyes slowly back towards Harry. His body rested against the trunk of the tree across from Ron, his head down, his green eyes hidden under his closed eyelids, and he seemed to be getting the sleep he lacked the past couple of weeks. Ron was relieved at this; not just for the sake of seeing his friend get some much needed rest, but because his impulse could be put to action.</p>
<p>Carefully, Ron tilted his head down a bit, leaning his mouth onto the top of Hermione’s head. He could feel the soft, fuzzy feeling of her hair and smell the clean, soapy aroma of her shampoo. He closed his eyes and, very slowly, kissed the top of her head, taking it all in; the warm feel of her hair against his face, against his lips.</p>
<p>He had wanted to do that for months, for years; and here he was. He had to savor it while he could.</p>
<p>He sat back up, wondering if she’d noticed. Still lost in her peaceful sleep, she didn’t seem to have been aware that anything different had happened. Harry, too, sat in the corner, just as fast asleep as he had been before.</p>
<p>Ron turned his head back to Hermione, but before his eyes met her form against his shoulder again, he was distracted by two heads of red hair standing several feet away.</p>
<p>Fred and George.</p>
<p>In his state of delusion, he had forgotten that the pair had not yet returned to the shop. If anyone was going to turn up at the most awkward moment possible, it would naturally be them – even if they were only there for a few hours. They stood transfixed, their dragon skin suits the only salient feature that Ron could attend to in order to avoid their facial expressions.</p>
<p>They saw it.</p>
<p>They’d give him hell; he knew it. By the time Hermione would get to the Burrow, they would manage to let her know that, while she was sleeping, that absolute git Ron had decided to put the moves on her.</p>
<p>And, yet, there was something curious about their reaction.</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to be laughing at him.</p>
<p>Odd.</p>
<p>After all the jokes they made about Lavender, after all of the teasing they’d done to him throughout the years, they weren’t going to laugh when they caught him kissing his best friend while she was sleeping?</p>
<p>Yet, they weren’t serious, either.</p>
<p>They exchanged a look with him, almost congratulatory. It was the same look he’d seen in their eyes as they were planning the joke shop years ago and came up with an idea that got them excited. Then, Fred whispered something to George that made George enthusiastically nod, a mischievous, but not a menacing, smile on his face.</p>
<p>Ron gave them a look to ask what on Earth they were talking about when George gave him a thumbs up and Fred decided to break the “no teasing” ice by mimicking a kiss onto George’s head as they laughed. Ron looked to the side and found a pebble, which he roughly picked up and chucked in their direction. This prompted them to laugh even harder, and they walked a few feet closer.</p>
<p>“We’re on our way out, little brother,” George whispered, still fixated on Hermione’s head lying comfortably on Ron’s arm. “That is, unless you think you may need some supervision.”</p>
<p>“Piss off.”</p>
<p>“Is that what you say to your brothers you haven’t seen for months?” Fred taunted. “Good thing mum isn’t here.”</p>
<p>“Anyhow, carry on,” George said, smirking. “We’ll see you both at the Burrow. But I’ll have to tell mum to padlock your door. Precaution, you know!”</p>
<p>Before Ron could throw another pebble in George’s direction, the two had waved goodbye and walked off. Ron didn’t think he had the energy, anyhow. Besides, after Dumbledore’s funeral, there were more important things to worry about.</p>
<p>At just that moment, Ron felt Hermione’s eyelashes blink against his arm and saw her look up at him. Her gaze was dreary and sleepy at first, but after a few seconds she seemed to realize the position in which she had awoken. Her eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Oh, Ron, I’m sorry!” she said quietly. “I didn’t mean to…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Ron assured her. “You were tired.”</p>
<p>Hermione rubbed her eyes, trying to use her hands to conceal how red her cheeks had become, but Ron knew red when he saw it. Especially in shades of Hermione.</p>
<p>“How long has he been sleeping?” Hermione asked, nudging her head towards Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don’t know, Ron thought, I was kind of busy watching you sleep and kissing you when you didn’t know it. Sorry.</p>
<p>“Just a few minutes, I think.”</p>
<p>“It’s about time he got some rest,” Hermione said, her face back to the state of concern it was in moments before. “It’s just…oh, God, Ron, I wish he’d just talk to us. He’s so…”</p>
<p>“I know. But, honestly, Hermione, do you expect him to start spitting out every thought in his head? Maybe he just wants a bit of peace.”</p>
<p>“Do you honestly think he has a moment of peace keeping everything to himself like that?”</p>
<p>Keeping everything to himself…</p>
<p>Because Ron knew nothing about that.</p>
<p>Ron never kept a single thing to himself. Ron didn’t feel safe concealing from Hermione that she consumed just about every waking moment of his thoughts. He didn’t know what it was like to find comfort in the fact that she didn’t know how many times the thought of snogging her senseless entered into his mind. He would have no clue how it felt to be kissing Lavender and wishing it was Hermione instead, hoping desperately that nobody would ever find out. Sure. Ron wouldn’t know about that.</p>
<p>“Sometimes…people don’t like to, you know, talk about things.”</p>
<p>He gave Hermione a meaningful look, the smallest part of him hoping that she’d know what he was thinking. She returned the look, her shiny brown eyes looking almost touched, and then looked away, seemingly embarrassed by the fact that she had caught on.</p>
<p>Ron didn’t need her to tell him she was feeling these things. He just knew her that well. They just knew each other that well.</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>“Pathetic.”</p>
<p>“Completely.”</p>
<p>Ron shook his head, his mind making a startled return to the present. His recollection of exactly how him and Hermione’s awkward “we’re talking about Harry, but we’re not” discussion continued was interrupted by the presence of Fred and George alongside his bed. He jumped up and pretended not to look as glum as he knew he did. The last thing he needed was the two of them finding him moping. That’d earn him weeks of unmitigated torture.</p>
<p>“It’s called knocking. D’you have to apparate everywhere?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mum, we actually do,” Fred replied.</p>
<p>“Waste of time not to.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of a wasting time, we figured you’d been doing too much of it.”</p>
<p>“Sitting around…”</p>
<p>“…like a lovesick puppy…”</p>
<p>This was it. This was when he’d finally get what was coming to him since the incident on the Hogwarts grounds.</p>
<p>“Sod off,” Ron said, standing up and turning to leave the room, when Fred stood directly in his path, George following.</p>
<p>“Not so fast there, Lover Boy,” George said, putting an arm on Ron’s shoulder. “At least hear us out. As you know, our reputation with the ladies precedes us.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. But, well, don’t listen to Magnolia Baxin over at the Leaky Cauldron. I mean, that wasn’t us; probably another pair of astoundingly good-looking gents…”</p>
<p>“Or those sisters Sandy and Cindy we hired down at the shop. I didn’t exactly plan on dating them at the same time, but, being twins, they happen to look exactly the same; can you imagine the nerve? By the time I knew one was Sandy, I had almost called her Cindy, but then Sandy did this thing with her tongue…”</p>
<p>“Oi! Really! I don’t need to hear about this!”</p>
<p>“Pointers, little brother!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, as convincing as this is, I think I can handle myself.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. You certainly proved that by the lake,” said Fred with a grin. “Funny, George, didn’t the book say to do romantic things like kissing your girl on the head when she’s, you know, conscious?”</p>
<p>“Something like that, yeah. I think they also mentioned that making your move after a funeral isn’t exactly slick.”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Ron shouted. Yet, his curiosity got the best of him and he took a minute to think. Which book were they talking about?</p>
<p>“The book also says that you should do a little with your hands, too, if you’re going to give one of those pecks,” Fred continued. “You know; play with her hair or some girly nonsense like that. Angelina loves that, you know.”</p>
<p>“Now that’s…” Ron stopped himself. This was starting to sound like it was going somewhere. “Wait, Angelina? Quidditch Angelina? Really?”</p>
<p>“Sure thing, mate,” Fred said. “You don’t think she’s gotten past that unforgettable night I gave her at the Yule Ball, do you? Well, fortunately for me, she’s away lots of the time at her job over in Egypt, but when she comes back, we relive a few happy memories, if you know what I mean.”</p>
<p>“And in the meantime, the book helps with everyone else,” George said.</p>
<p>“All right, what the hell are you talking about? What book?”</p>
<p>Fred and George exchanged smiles and looked back at Ron.</p>
<p>“I think he’s ready. What about you, Fred?”</p>
<p>“No time better than now. Merlin knows that I’d like nieces and nephews with some brains.”</p>
<p>If Ron weren’t so curious about the book, or so lost in the idea that someone other than himself saw the potential he had in being with Hermione long enough to have Fred and George’s nieces and nephews, he would have retorted. As it was, his mind was way too distracted.</p>
<p>Fred and George led him to the edge of his bed and sat on either side of him. George moved his hand to the inner pocket of the button down shirt he was wearing and pulled out a thin paperback book. Its black binding resembled Riddle’s diary, which made Ron shudder at the thought of the other Horcruxes he, Harry and Hermione would have to find. Then, when he looked at the cover, the gold and red lettering of the title seemed to shine at him, attracting his attention more than a Veela. The letters on the cover title looked masculine enough for Fred and George not to be embarrassed about owning it, but contained curls at their ends that were feminine enough to know that whoever designed it knew girls.</p>
<p>“Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches,” Ron read, thinking back to his claim that Hermione herself could write a book on the mad things girls do. He wondered if this would sound like Hermione’s know-it-all nature at all.</p>
<p>“And trust us, they’re fail-safe,” Fred said.</p>
<p>“Solid gold,” George agreed.</p>
<p>“I mean, don’t go by the one or two offsets we’ve had,” Fred advised. “Sure, we’ve gotten into a bit of trouble occasionally…”</p>
<p>“If you can imagine us being the sort to get into trouble…”</p>
<p>“But, basically, it works. It’s gotten us lots of second, third, tenth dates. Good stuff. Amazing what rubbish girls like, I swear.”</p>
<p>“Only try and tone it down for now,” George said, looking at Ron with what almost appeared to be a twinge of seriousness. “It’s fun to drive someone batty who isn’t mum. We’ve grown fond of Granger in that way.”</p>
<p>“Not as much as you have, obviously,” Fred cut in.</p>
<p>“So it’s best you stick with her. I mean, no more Lavender Brown types, then. Save those for us.”</p>
<p>“Is Lavender still single, come to think of it?”</p>
<p>“Trust me, you don’t need a book for Lavender Brown,” Ron said, turning the pages of the book and starting to skim through its contents. “Just snog her silly and she’ll be happy.”</p>
<p>“Wow. It sounds like you went through a rough ordeal with her,” George mocked.</p>
<p>“Dreadful,” Fred added.</p>
<p>“It may be a burden, but I think we can carry on for you!” George said.</p>
<p>“We?” Fred asked. “You’ve got your whole Sandy and Cindy nonsense to sort out.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, they’re bound to be a bit worried seeing as our lunch break ended fifteen minutes ago and we’ve got a dark wizard on the loose.”</p>
<p>“Right, then. Guess it’s back to business as usual. Then maybe some work if we can squeeze it in. All right, then, Ron?”</p>
<p>“What?” Ron asked, realizing again that Fred and George were in his midst after being lost for a moment on a paragraph stressing the success of complimenting a girl’s talent in dressing and decorating. Fred and George exchanged smiles.</p>
<p>“We’ll leave you to it, then,” George said, and with a pop, the two apparated off.</p>
<p>Ron skimmed back to the front of the book and read with the sort of intense interest he never had in any other book he’d read before. He hoped to see the list of twelve in a place where he could study them all at once…</p>
<p>…and so he turned to the introduction and began mid-sentence.</p>
<p>…despite what you may believe, a wizard doesn’t have to be wealthy, powerful, or even handsome to win over the object of his affections!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Ron silently thanked the author for clarifying that, for he firmly believed he was none of those things).</p>
<p>All you have to do is follow our 12 steps to winning over the witch of your dreams, listed here and described in each chapter to follow:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1 – Listen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, okay, Ron listened to her. He listened to her go on and on about SPEW; didn’t get when she was ever going to understand that the house elves liked their lot and hated her interference. He heard her talk about all the studying she had to do all the time, even though she didn’t have to do it because, unlike him, she was the sort of brilliant that didn’t need to try so hard to be something better. He heard her and he let her know he heard her. Maybe not always in the most pleasant of ways, but, hell, she deserved it sometimes. Crazy about her though he was, Ron knew that she was a right little piece of work when she wanted to be.</p>
<p>2 – Let her know how you feel about her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All right, well, there were eleven other ways. He could do without one for now…</p>
<p>3 – Surprise her with gifts and compliments she doesn’t expect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She didn’t expect that perfume! He was on top of his game already! As for compliments, he was sure he’d given her loads. Didn’t he tell her how brilliant he thought she was? He must have mentioned that he thought she was pretty. He commented on her teeth that one time, didn’t he? Surely she put two and two together and realized he thought she was good looking, no?</p>
<p>4 – Respect her goals and dreams, even if they’re different from yours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After all the times he’d listen to her gripe about tests, Ron was sure he must have done that. But then again, what were Hermione’s goals and dreams? He knew that she wanted to do well on every test, but there would be no tests this year. Where did that leave her? What did she want? Did she even want to get married? Did she want a family? Did she want to get into some competitive job field where she could show the entire wizarding world how brilliant she was and forget about Ron entirely? He could most certainly not respect that – couldn’t respect her choosing to be away from him, could he?</p>
<p>Well, he’d have to, wouldn’t he?</p>
<p>She was worth it…</p>
<p>5 – Don’t discuss the attractiveness of other girls in her presence without stressing that she is attractive first.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh, no…</p>
<p>The Yule Ball.</p>
<p>That’s why she stormed up the stairs! She thought that when he was talking about the ugly girls (trolls, did he call them?) that he was talking about her! How could a smart girl be so daft? Of course he didn’t think she was a troll! Would he be sitting here reading Fred and George’s book in order to impress a troll? How could she not know this?</p>
<p>6 – When you’re together, show that you know her and respect her feelings by doing what she likes and inviting her to things you enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron imagined his first date with Hermione involving the two of them sitting in the common room knitting elf hats and resisted the urge to giggle. He resisted it even greater with the realization that they wouldn’t be in the common room this year.</p>
<p>To alleviate the weight of the lump in his throat he read on…</p>
<p>7 – Show her affection whenever possible, no matter who else is around.</p>
<p>Showing Hermione affection; now that didn’t sound so bad.</p>
<p>But now that Krum had shown her affection, how could he compete? How must Krum have done this? As much as it pained him, Ron imagined Krum sloppily forcing his lips onto Hermione’s and felt the sudden urge to grab his Cleansweep, fly to Bulgaria and pummel him to the ground. But, then again, that wasn’t very romantic of Vicky, was it? Ron would do that finger in the hair thing that Fred was talking about. If it worked on Angelina…</p>
<p>8 – Make an effort to become friendly with the people closest to her, like family and friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, that was easy. Ron had met the Grangers on several occasions and had gotten on fine with them. As for friends, Ron and Harry were Hermione’s friends. It seemed that very few people appreciated how wonderful a person she was, and, even though Ron knew that some of her habits weren’t exactly pleasant, he couldn’t help but wonder why. In fact, thinking back to the way that Parvati and Lavender used to gossip about her and how pathetic she was, how sad it was that her only friends were two boys, one of which she was, as Lavender put, “obsessive about”, Ron felt angry at himself for not ditching Lavender on the grounds that she was completely foul.</p>
<p>He had to stop thinking about Lavender. This was about Hermione, after all…</p>
<p>9 – If she’s in a bad mood, allow her to blow off some steam before reacting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Obviously, the person reading this book didn’t know Hermione. You just had to react to Hermione; she could be maddening if she was in enough of a mood. But, then again, Harry never seemed to lash out at her alone, and the few times he did, Ron felt a sudden urge to shove him. This was Ron’s job; it was him who kept Hermione in check, who made her stop and think about what she was saying and doing, not Harry.</p>
<p>10 – When she’s upset, the greatest comfort is a little bit of intimacy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron thought back to third year when Hermione had tried to show Ron that bit of intimacy in the form of a hug. Of course, at thirteen, intimacy was a lot more intimidating, but, all the same, Ron wished he could go back to that moment and place his arms tightly around Hermione instead of having one to his side and one patting her head. He didn’t exactly make up for it in the years to follow, being the reason she was upset instead of the one who made her feel better.</p>
<p>Guilt piercing him like a rusty needle digging into his skin, he thought of all the times she’d run out on him and Lavender. He saw her every time, and, while it felt almost good at first to give her a taste of what he felt every time she shoved her contact with Vicky down his throat, he couldn’t help but feel a stabbing sensation of absolute discomfort and hatred for himself. He had done that to her – he wouldn’t wish that pain on his worst enemy and he had thrust it upon her, the one person he wanted to see happy.</p>
<p>This was getting a bit uncomfortable…</p>
<p>11 – Make her feel like the most beautiful creature that ever walked the planet.</p>
<p>But that’s not what made Ron love her so much.</p>
<p>Wait…he just admitted he loved her.</p>
<p>And, well, so he did. He loved her. Ron resolved to be certain about this point. And he didn’t love her because she was beautiful, although she was; she most definitely was. He didn’t love her because her looks surpassed everyone else’s, because, though he cared for her more than anyone else, he knew that they didn’t.</p>
<p>But she did.</p>
<p>She – body, soul, spirit, everything –was what he wanted more than anything. It wouldn’t matter if a million Veelas or Lavender Browns came around. Nobody else could be Hermione. Nobody else could possess him in the way that she did; could know him in the way that she did.</p>
<p>Surely Hermione wanted more than to just be another girl who got excited over being pretty. Surely Hermione was different; was smarter than that. He was positive she wasn’t fixated on the superficial things all of those other girls were.</p>
<p>Yet, maybe, that was just one of those crazy girl things. He’d have to reconsider that one…</p>
<p>12 – Be on her side.</p>
<p>He was…mostly.</p>
<p>Except for the times they argued and he was the opposing side.</p>
<p>Blimey.</p>
<p>This was not going to be easy.</p>
<p>Ron closed the book in frustration, flopped down on his bed, and turned to the dresser drawer alongside it. He opened the top drawer and pulled out the picture that Ginny had taken of him and Hermione two years earlier.</p>
<p>It was amazing; all the years they had been friends, and this was the only picture he had of the two of them alone. He looked at it whenever he could.</p>
<p>They were covered in soot from head to toe, giggling as they attempted to get all of it off. He remembered that that was just when they started clearing out Grimmauld Place, and they opened a cupboard door to find dust cascade out it and all over the two of them. Naturally, Ginny couldn’t resist the urge to capture this moment on her camera, and, despite the frustration of having their embarrassing moment photographed, neither one could stop laughing about it.</p>
<p>First, the two were looking in different directions, wiping dust off of their faces and bodies as they giggled and tried to turn Ginny’s attention away from them. Then, at one point, for a fraction of a second, they glanced at each other, and Ron had a feeling that, right then and there, he realized how much he needed her. This –working together, even on the most daunting of tasks, living in the same place, waking up and knowing she’d be there waiting for him downstairs – this is what he wanted.</p>
<p>And the picture, silly as it was, spoke volumes about the way that they now were. They’d stand covered in the dust and the grime of their own avoidance and the problems life kept bringing – but, nevertheless, they bore it together. They faced it as a team. That was enough to make them happy side by side, no matter what darkness engulfed them. He was on her side in more ways than any book could describe, and he always would be.</p>
<p>If only she knew…</p>
<p>But she must.</p>
<p>They knew each other that well.</p>
