  <u>Three Weeks Later</u>
</p>
<p>“You sure about this?” Peter said, running a hand through Remus’s hair.  He sounded nervous, but that was typical for him.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Remus said.  He closed his eyes for a second, took a breath.  “Yeah, just do it.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Peter turned the buzzer on, placed it at the nape of Remus’s neck.  Moved it up across his scalp, and Remus watched his own reflection in the mirror, as blonde hair fell around bare shoulders.</p>
<p>                                                                                         *</p>
<p>“You look like an anime character,” Lily said.</p>
<p>Remus turned to see her in his open doorway, then looked down at himself.  Grey skinny jeans, white sweater with the bluebell silhouette.  He already knew his eyes were three-sizes too big.  “You think so?”</p>
<p>“Mm.”  She crossed to him, pulled him in to kiss the layer of fuzz that remained on his head.  “Hope this isn’t some kind of Samson and Delilah shit.”</p>
<p>“More like Britney ’07 shit, probably.”</p>
<p>“I’d definitely fuck you if I liked guys that look like girls.”</p>
<p>“You’re already fucking James.”</p>
<p>She laughed, hopped onto Remus’s bed and opened her arms for him.  He jumped in place a few times, then tackled her - they fell with a yelp onto the blankets.</p>
<p>“I knew it, I knew it!” Lily cried in a passable Southern accent.  “On the anniversary of my descent into respectable womanhood, you’ve realized what fires I set ablaze in your loins!”</p>
<p>“The flames of a thousand dying stars,” Remus said, propping himself on his forearms over her.</p>
<p>“Well there’s nothing else for it.”  She wrapped her legs around his hips.  “Take me, Remus Lupin, and damn the consequences.”</p>
<p>Remus hung his head, low beside her ear, and whispered, “Is it okay that I’m getting hard right now - that’s okay, right?”</p>
<p>Lily shoved him off, and laughing still they both stretched out on their backs.  Remus had spent an embarrassing amount of time last semester, taping and pasting and Command-stripping a collage of pictures and quotes onto his ceiling.  It stared back at them, the ramshackle adventures of freshman year, and more than a few moments sported Regulus with his small, confident smile.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you get rid of those?” Lily said.</p>
<p>Remus knew which ones she meant.  He shrugged and said, “They weren’t always bad memories.”  Lily nestled against him, and Remus pointed up at one of his favorite quotes, scrawled in sharpie across a few pictures.  “I wasn’t scared, I was just somebody else, some stranger.  And my whole life was a haunted life, the life of a ghost.”</p>
<p>“You are trash,” Lily mumbled into his side.  “You are hipster trash.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>They were quiet for a minute, and not for the first time Remus thought how grateful he was that Lily had stuck by him.  No one had drawn a line in the sand, but James and Peter were his friends first, and the fact they all came from smaller towns had given Remus some assurance they wouldn’t vanish alongside Regulus.</p>
<p>But Lily was a Boston kid, born and bred in Beacon Hill, and her and James had gotten together within a few weeks’ window of him and Reg.  So he’d accepted and maybe expected she’d pick the city option when the time came, distance herself from James’s crowd and turn up to smile when it was appropriate, but here she was, in his bed - proving him wrong like she usually did.</p>
<p>And if she kept something up with Reg, it wasn’t his business.  She’d bring it up if it mattered somehow, and she spent enough time with Remus and James that neither could accuse her of leading secrets.</p>
<p>He wrapped his arm around Lily a bit tighter.</p>
<p>“What movie are you guys seeing tonight?”</p>
<p>“Fantastic Beasts, again,” Lily sighed.  “James said I didn’t have to get him an anniversary present if I went with him for the fifth fucking time.”</p>
<p>“But you got him the new core set, and those jeans.”</p>
<p>“Well, he probably deserves nice things once in a while.”  She rolled away from Remus’s grip, then jumped back onto the floor and pulled her shirt down from where it’d ridden.  “And the jeans are more for me than him.  If he shows up for another date in sweats I’ll castrate him.”</p>
<p>“I’ll never complain about a boy in sweatpants.”  Remus sat up, tried to swipe some of the wrinkles out of his own shirt.  “You guys doing dinner before or after the movie?”</p>
<p>“Before - plenty of time to digest for the <i>after</i>.  So we’ll meet you and Pete at Landsdowne around ten, if that works.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a plan.”</p>
<p>“And you’re sure you’re okay to go out tonight?”</p>
<p>Remus raised his head at the abrupt question, the sternness in Lily’s words.  She’d crossed her arms and raised her eyebrows, the <i>we-don’t-tolerate-bullsit-here</i> look.  How’d such a small person come off so intimidating?  Remus could never manage it.</p>
<p>“I’m not worried about you spoiling the party or anything,” she went on, voice softening.  “I just don’t want you to feel uncomfortable, or obligated, or sad.”</p>
<p>Remus leaned forward from his perch on the bed.  Ran his hand over the bristles that’d been his hair a few hours back, and smiled.  “I’m not sad anymore, I’m just ready for something to change.  It’s going to be an incredible night, okay?”</p>
