  <em>Some call it destiny, some call it fate.<br/>But for better or worse, two people are tied by a Red String and it always changes their lives.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>-The Red-String-</em>
</p><hr/><p>They meet, the first time around in a coffee shop in Venice.</p><p>Hyacinth is, for once, behaving and not looking for any new curiosities that would get her into trouble. She drinks her tea, eats her cookies and burrows deep in her novel like a proper bookworm.</p><p>Reborn, in all his un-babyfied glory, enters the shop and orders his regular, checks it for poison and finds out that all seats are occupied, save for the vacant one in Hyacinth's table.</p><p>Normally, Reborn would have just emitted his awesome hitman aura that usually cleared a room faster than a gunshot, but he is in a good mood.</p><p>So he makes his way to Hyacinth's table, asks if they could share and Hyacinth spent a couple of beats blinking because his sideburns really defied logic. After she gets over that, she nodded.</p><p>Nothing happens. But then again, it is a first meeting.</p><p>She remembers his ridiculous hair and his voice.</p><p>He remembers her brilliant eyes and how she consumed tea by the barrel.</p><hr/><p>The second time they meet, it is for an antique auction in Paris.</p><p>Hermione had bullied her to go out and stop moping. Just to be contrary, Hyacinth used her gold to splurge, buy herself a dress and throw a dart to the map.</p><p>Reborn is there to reclaim a few pieces of art from the time of Vongola Primo.</p><p>It just so happened that the auction featured some pieces with the Peverell crest.</p><p>Hyacinth wasn't alone in the bidding for the ancient pocket watch of Marcus Peverell, son of the son of Ignotus Peverell. Reborn as well, was not alone in bidding for the painting of Lady Elena and Daemon Spade.</p><p>Both won, obviously. Reborn through sheer force of personality and Hyacinth because of her immeasurable wealth. Also, both of them gained a lot of annoyed parties.</p><p>In the hallway afterwards, Hyacinth is cornered by three wizards who didn't recognize who she was. Reborn, passing by the people who parted from him like the Red Sea, caught her eye. It was as though time slowed for both of them - and there was always a reason why the Vongola Decimo, Sawada Tsunayoshi, would vow to the gods that his tutor could read minds.</p><p>Well… Reborn was never one to leave a woman in distress.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>"Thank you," she sighs. "That was getting stuffy."</p><p>Reborn nods, gives her a kiss to her fingertips and makes her blush to the roots of her hair. "That was nothing. Just don't get yourself in another of these messes."</p><p>Hyacinth flashes him a sheepish look. "Ah, I'll try. But I'm not betting in my luck," she says.</p><p>She remembers him, of course. Reborn is rather unforgettable.</p><p>He remembers her eyes two days later.</p><p>Both of them wonder if it is a coincidence.</p><hr/><p>They meet a third time in London.</p><p>Hyacinth is doing groceries when she passed by Reborn coming out from an alley, throwing away a bloodstained rag.</p><p>He smells, faintly, of gunpowder and blood.</p><p>Their eyes meet and a world of knowledge passes through that moment.</p><p>She knows that he has done.</p><p>He knows what she inferred.</p><p>Hyacinth drops her groceries with a squeak and runs.</p><p>Reborn tucks his gun and gives chase.</p><p>It was a confusing moment but Hyacinth has spent the better part of a <em>year</em> running. No matter if he is the World's Greatest Hitman, he cannot catch a person used to running for her life. Hyacinth had also the advantage of knowing the territory.</p><p>London was her playground.</p><p>He doesn't catch her, and ruminates over that for a month.</p><p>She hides, and contemplates becoming a hermit for life.</p><hr/><p>The fourth time they meet is when they finally talk and it is in Rome.</p><p>Hyacinth wanted to see the Coliseum before making a smaller replica of it for her godson's birthday.</p><p>Reborn, because of another job, though this one involves retrieval rather than death.</p><p>She was a tourist and he was a hitman.</p><p>Their eyes don't meet this time, but he smells her perfume, the exact same perfume he had hunted for three blocks, and instinctively reaches a hand to grab. Hyacinth flinches but is caught anyway, and they both meet face to face after a year.</p><p>"Ahm," she squeaks. "Hello."</p><p>Reborn recognizes her body's reaction. She is curious, wary and a bit attracted. But there was no fear.</p><p>How strange.</p><p>"My name is Reborn," he says smoothly.</p><p>Her eyes widen. "Hyacinth. My name is Hyacinth," she whispers.</p><p>She is curious.</p><p>He is mystified.</p><hr/><p>They meet again, but those meetings never end anymore.</p><p> </p>
