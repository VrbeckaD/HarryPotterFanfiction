    <p>When Fate Intervened</p><p>The Sounds of the battle were crashing around them as they made their way to the Whomping Willow and the secret tunnel to the shrieking shack.  Every minute seemed like ten as they slowly and quietly climbed through the tunnel outside of the room where Voldemort and Headmaster Snape were meeting.  Barely daring to breathe they listened to the conversation beyond the passage that they were hidden in.</p><p>“All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,” said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, “wondering, wondering why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner… and I think I have the answer.”</p><p>Snape did not speak.</p><p>“Perhaps you already know it?  You are a clever man, after all, Severus.  You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.”</p><p>“My Lord---“</p><p>“The Elder Wand cannot server me properly, Severus because I am not its true master.  The Elder wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner.  You killed Albus Dumbledore.  While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.”</p><p>“My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand.</p><p>“It cannot be any other way, “said Voldemort.  “I must master the wand, Severus.  Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.”</p><p>And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand, It did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think that he had been reprieved:  But then Voldemort’s intention became clear.  The snake’s cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.<br/>
“Kill”</p><p>There was a terrible scream.  They saw Snape’s face losing the little color it had left: it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor.</p><p>“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly and he and the snake apparated away.</p><p>“Harry!” breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view.  It lifted an inch in the air and drifted sideways silently.  As quietly as he could he pulled himself into the room.</p><p>She watched as Harry walked over to Snape who was trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck, his eyes widening as he spotted Harry and he tried to speak.  Harry bent over him and Snape seized the front of his robes and he pulled him close.</p><p>A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s throat.<br/>
“Take…..it……Take…..it”</p><p> Something more than blood was leaking from Snape.  Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do-----</p><p>A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by Hermione.  Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand.  When the flask was filled to the brim and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry’s robes slackened.</p><p>“Look….at….me…” he whispered</p><p>Harry’s beautiful green eyes met the black of Snape’s but after a second something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank and empty.  The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor and Snape moved no more. </p><p>With an inarticulate cry Hermione moved forward pushing Harry aside to try and staunch the flow of blood on the side of Snape’s neck while desperately searching her bag with one hand.  She proceeded to pull vials of dittany and blood replenishing potion that she had nicked from the potion’s classroom on their way out of the castle and started treating the wounds of their former potion’s professor.</p><p>“Mione, what are you doing?” questioned Ron as he and Harry looked on.  Why are you trying to save that greasy git?”</p><p>“Because he is a human being Ronald” she exclaimed quietly as she continued to work.  Ron tried to pull her back when she went to lay Snape down and called to Harry to begin CPR on him.  She rounded on him as she realized that neither one of them were going to help her.</p><p>“Harry, take the memories that Professor Snape gave to you and find a Pensieve.  There has to be something important in them if he was so desperate for you to see them.”<br/>
Hermione stated as she was trying to keep track of the count of chest compressions that she had done. When Ron tried to stop her from giving breaths to the professor she yelled at him and told him to take Harry and get going, the snake still needed to be killed.</p><p>“Please professor, don’t give up yet.  As she gave another breath and checked his pulse she gave a startled shout.  The professor’s eyes had opened and he stared at her just as surprised.  What had surprised her most though were the images that assaulted her as they looked into each other’s eyes.</p><p>She saw the two of them together along with another, the bond between the three of them almost visible.  They were holding onto each other, lying in bed together reading and relaxing.  Loving touches and kisses.  Wild images of love making and the gentle touch of hands against her waist, obviously swelling with their children, Children that looked like the three of them, a black haired and golden eyed baby and a sandy haired baby with green eyes. Days romping on the beach and nights rocking babes and reading stories.   The melody of a beautiful song woven through the time, more days loving and more children running around the house and the three of them growing old together.</p><p>“Mi” whispered Snape as he gripped her hand tightly.</p><p>“Sev” Hermione whispered with tears slowly rolling down her cheeks. </p><p>“And Mus” they whispered together.</p><p>Severus looked into her eyes and saw everything that he had ever wanted and wished to share with both her and Remus but he knew that his time was limited.  Reading the truth in his eyes and listening to his labored breathing she knew that she couldn’t save him.</p><p>“Mi, find him, make those visions come true and let him know that I would have loved both of you forever if I could have.”</p><p>“Sev, please don’t leave me, don’t leave us….Those babies are ours, that future is ours..please” she whispered against his lips, her forehead resting lightly against his.</p><p>His breath caught once more and there it stopped.  Her tears continued to fall against his cheeks as she touched his face and gently closed his eyes.</p><p>Standing up she stared down at one of the men that had been made for her, that she had never gotten the chance to truly know and she straightened his body out so that he no longer resembled a broken doll, she syphoned the blood from around him with her wand and with a flick of her wrist wrapped him tightly in his cloak.  Leaning over him one last time she kissed his still warm lips and then turned and walked away.  </p><p>She realized she was needed for the fighting but knew that she had to find Remus as well.  She accepted that he was with Tonks and that they loved each other deeply, but she also knew that she had to protect him.  She had lost Severus without being able to know him or love him, and even if she only had his friendship, she would keep Remus safe.</p><p>The world outside of the shack was eerily quiet as she walked back to the castle. There were fires smoldering around the ruins of the greenhouses, great pieces of rubble surrounding the castle and felled giants.  She walked as quickly as she could towards the main hall where everyone seemed to be congregated.  Upon reaching The Great Hall she stopped suddenly, amazed at the amount of people filling the space.  The injured laid out being attended to by professors and Madam Pomfrey, the dead and dying on the other side with students and order member’s holding their hands and closing their eyes.  Noticing this she spotted Professor McGonagall kneeling between two people, one of them with fushia colored hair, rapidly changing to brown and closing her eyes.  Beside her was another person, this one with sandy brown hair.  </p><p>“Oh my God, oh my God, Oh my God” kept chanting through Hermione’s head as she ran over to where the professor was now sitting, holding Remus’s hand.  As she approached she noticed the jagged mark of the curse that Remus had been hit with, knowing it was identical to the one that she had been hit with at the end of her fifth year, knowing it had been cast by Dolohov.  She kneeled beside him and he caught her eye, clearly surprised and happy to see her alive and well one last time.  Both of them knew that he would not survive the curse as it was already draining his magical core and any remaining color he might have had.</p><p>“Ms. Granger, oh goodness, it is good to see you safe,” exclaimed the professor.   Hermione diverted her gaze from Remus’s for just a second and gave the professor a terse smile.  She was feeling the drain of the fight catching up with her. </p><p>“Yes, professor, it is good to see you safe as well.” remarked Hermione, now looking once again at Remus and seeing his breathing become more labored.  She knew that she was going to lose him too.  </p><p>“Hermione dear, if you could please stay here with Remus while I get Madame Pomfrey?”</p><p>“Of course” replied Hermione, her eyes tracing Remus’s features and then meeting his eyes with a sad smile.  She didn’t know if Remus knew of the bond and she needed him to see it to hopefully give him something to hold onto.  Looking into his beautiful green and amber eyes, she tightly grasped his hand and once again saw the life that she, he and Severus were supposed to be blessed with.  The three of them together hanging out in Muggle London, napping together in a large four poster bed, relaxed and happy.  Her walking between the two of them obviously pregnant and about to burst.  Lying together in bed again, this time she was feeding one of their children while the others smiled happily at their other baby.</p><p>Mornings and nights of making love, the three of them together growing old.</p><p>“Mi” whispered Remus with tears in his eyes squeezing her hand softly</p><p>“Mus” whispered Hermione.</p><p>“Sev is gone, isn’t he?” asked Remus.</p><p>“Yes” said Hermione with tears falling from her eyes once again.  “He wanted me to let you know that he would have loved us and our future if he could have stayed.”</p><p>“Yes, and I would have loved you both too, and our beautiful future, forever” Remus whispered softly looking into her eyes and drawing another ragged breath.</p><p>Again Hermione lowered her forehead to Remus’s and against his lips begged him to stay with her.  That Sev would always be in their hearts and that she so wanted that beautiful future with him.</p><p>Remus pressed his lips to hers, his friend; his would be lover if only there was time, if only fate had shown them this gift earlier.  If only fate had intervened.</p><p>Remus took one last deep breath staring into her whiskey colored eyes.</p><p>Pressing a kiss to Remus’s forehead, nose and finally his silent lips she whispered. “I would have loved you both forever.  I would have loved our children and our life together.  Without you both, my soul mates, I don’t think that I will survive.” She closed his eyes and took his hand, placing his wand in it and placed it over his heart. With a whisper of magic she bound him in his cloak and leaned forward slightly rocking, her breath coming in harsh pants.</p><p>A hundred memories bombarded her mind, remembering times that she had seen both Remus and Severus together, speaking of different ideas about defense and seeing one Albus Dumbledore interrupting them and sending either Severus away or drawing Remus away with another mission.</p><p>She remembered times when she had worked up the nerve to approach her professor to discuss a potion that she had questions about or a defense theory she wanted clarification on and Dumbledore would discourage her, reminding her of how busy the professor was and his duties as a spy.</p><p>The times at headquarters after the disaster of the Ministry of Magic when she wanted to offer her condolences for Remus’s loss of Sirius or even just a discussion about a book that they both had read and either Dumbledore would interfere or Molly Weasley would.</p><p>Multiple times and occasions when they could have connected, even on a platonic friendly level to build upon had been denied them.  It had been denied them purposely by one Albus Wulfric Percival Brian Dumbledore.  Her loves, her future, had been taken from her by that bastard she seethed.  If he wasn’t already dead she would have killed him herself.</p><p>Her breath came out in harsher pants as she felt her heart breaking.  The tears rolling down her cheeks as she leaned over Remus’s side.  </p><p> </p><p>This is where Harry found her……</p><p>He had heard the whispers from others that Hermione had been by Remus’s side when he passed and she had kissed him goodbye and hadn’t left him.<br/>
He approached her slowly seeing how pale she looked, how the tears fell unchecked down her cheeks and the closer he got he saw her lean to the side and fall over causing him to rush to her side.</p><p>“Hermione!” Harry yelled kneeling beside her, grabbing her shoulder’s to hold her up and turning her face towards him.<br/>
“Mione, where  are you hurt? Tell me so that I can help you.” cried Harry.<br/>
“Is he gone Harry?” whispered Hermione.<br/>
“He’s gone Mi” said Harry.<br/>
At his words he felt Hermione relax slightly, though her breathing was still ragged.</p><p>“What happened Hermione? What were you hit with?” Harry asked her.</p><p>“Nothing hit me Harry, but I have lost too much.” whispered Hermione back to him.</p><p>“I’ll help you get it back Hermione, we’ll find your parents, we’ll find Crookshanks….”</p><p>“No Harry, you can’t bring back what I’ve lost, I’m sorry.  He took them from me, they both took them from me” wheezed Hermione.</p><p>“I don’t understand Hermione”</p><p>“They were mine, they were meant to be mine and he kept them from me, he kept us from each other and then Voldemort took them from me forever..”</p><p>“Who did he take, who kept them from you?” asked Harry</p><p>“Sev and Mus were mine Harry, Dumbledore kept us all apart and Voldemort killed them…” “We were meant to meet, we were meant to love each other and bring forth the most beautiful babes…, I saw it, we saw it but it was too late…they’re gone and you can’t bring them back to me and I can’t stay here without them..”</p><p>“But you don’t believe in Divination, we’ve won, he’s gone,  we can rebuild, we can start over, we can love again..” cried Harry</p><p>“Not Divination Harry, she whispered.  It was Fate that showed us what could have been what should have been and who stopped it from blessing us.  I could have loved them; we could have loved each other.  They were mine and I was theirs…”  She took in a deep breath and let it out slowly.</p><p>“I am so proud of you Harry, and so sorry that you had to suffer so much, it shouldn’t have been this way…She wheezed…If I could have saved you and Sev and Remus from the pain that you have endured for your lives…I would in a heartbeat. You deserve to be loved your whole life Harry, my three lost boys..</p><p>“Hermione, don’t speak, save your strength” Harry cried looking into her eyes, “don’t leave me, please..”</p><p>He knew though, by the words that she said and the way her breathes were coming more shallowly, by the look in her eyes..</p><p>“I love you Harry James Potter, my best friend, my brother, my family…...”</p><p>Hermione Jean Granger with a look of love in her eyes breathed her last breath and was gone and her brother in all ways but blood, leaned over her and cried.</p><p>TBC…….</p>
