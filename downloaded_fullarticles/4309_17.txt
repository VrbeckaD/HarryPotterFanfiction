    <p>"Alright, Mrs. Malfoy. You're all set. Now remember, bed rest for three days," the Nurse said as Astoria set the quill back into the ink pot, signing the last of the parchment for her discharge. She turned back to Draco where he waited by the wall, carrying Scorpius in his midnight blue carrier. Draco was smiling down at Scorpius, gently rocking their baby before looking up and noticing Astoria walking towards them. "Ready to go, love?"</p><p><br/> Draco nodded and adjusted their overnight bag over his shoulder and took her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. "Of course," he hummed and led them to the end of the reception to the fireplaces. He stepped into one with his family and watched Astoria grab a handful of Floo powder and shout "Malfoy Manor" before dropping it.</p><p><br/> Draco remembered squeezing his arm around her waist and tightened his grip on the carrier's handle. It was only a moment of weightlessness before they both landed, looking out of the fireplace into the familiar study, where on the couches Lucious and Narcissa sat.</p><p><br/> "Just on time as always," Narcissa said and stood up, meeting Astoria as she stepped out, guiding her to sit down. But that was all Draco paid attention to because as soon as he stepped out of the fireplace, he gently placed the carrier on the floor and knelt down to unbuckle Scorpius. He used his wand to sweep off any soot from his body before holding Scorpius close, assessing him with worrisome eyes. He knew the floo wasn't the best option, but he wanted to get home as soon as possible. When Scorpius gurgled and shifted around in his blanket, but didn't cough, nor was he covered in a single speck. He had been completely protected by the carrier and the dozen of protective charms Draco had placed on it.</p><p><br/> "Son, why don't you stop hogging your child and present him to his grandparents," Lucius drawled, his expression the usual disinterested, though Draco couldn't understand why but he was not surprised.</p><p><br/> "Of course, father," he said and got up. He turned to see Narcissa move from Astoria's side and go to sit next to her husband. Draco waited for her to settle before handing the small bundle to her.</p><p><br/> Draco took a step back as he watched Narcissa slowly pull the blanket away to expose the adorable sleeping face and for a moment everyone was silent and smiling. Even his father. "He is so precious," Narcissa whispered, breaking the silence.</p><p><br/> Lucius nodded in agreement, shifting closer to get a closer look. "He truly is,"</p><p><br/> Draco bit the inside of his cheeks to stop himself from smiling too hard. But it was hard not to. He was so proud of having the most perfect baby in the world, and everyone could see that. Draco turned around and walked over to Astoria, sitting by her side and placed his hand on her lower back. "You did it," he whispered into her ear as he gently rubbed her back.</p><p><br/> Draco watched her smile fondly and rolled her eyes before resting her head on his shoulder. "We did it," she added.</p><p><br/> Draco didn't protest, but he couldn't agree with her. He had done nothing. She was the one who carried that boy for nine months with all the pain and illness along with the hours of labour that came after. Draco had done nothing. Just stood on the sidelines, offering not nearly as much as he wishes he could've. He didn't deserve to share the work with her. Even in the hospital she was so calm and composed every time Scorpius cried and allowed herself to trust the staff around as they took Scorpius in and out of the room for various tests. Draco, on the other hand, froze every time Scorpius cried and had to follow Scorpius around the rooms, despite knowing the staff very well. How could Draco be considered on the same level when Draco felt as though he could only be a bumbling fool of completely shut off when it came to their son. </p><p><br/> "Draco," Astoria whispered, placing her hand on his chest. Draco blinked a bit and turned to her, not having realized he had zoned out.</p><p>He glanced at his parents were still mesmerized by their child and finally answered her. "Yes?"</p><p><br/> "Why don't you take me upstairs. I better get started on my bedrest." She didn't wait for Draco to answer before getting up and pulling Draco to his feet. Astoria turned to Narcissa and Lucius. "If you excuse us. The Healers ordered that I have complete bed rest for three days. So, I must excuse myself. It was so nice seeing you two again. I will see if I am fit enough to join you all for dinner," she added and leaned down to kiss both of Narcissa's cheeks and nodded her head towards Lucius.</p><p><br/> Draco wrapped his arm around her waist, glancing down at their son as they walked past them and out of the study. He hated to admit it, but even now in his own home, even when Scorpius was with his parents, he already missed him. He turned back to Astoria and raised his eyebrow at her. "It was not complete bed rest," he said, remembering quite clearly was the Healer said.</p><p><br/> Astoria nodded and rested her weight on him as she reached her hand to hold onto the stair railing while they made their way up. "I know. But we need to talk."</p><p><br/> "About?" Draco asked slowly. His mind tried to figure out what there was to say in private. But all he could think of was by no means worthy of excusing herself so suddenly.</p><p><br/> "About you," she said bluntly as she pulled back from him just enough to walk into their bedroom. She walked in as graceful as always, slipping out of her kitten heels before settling herself on the bed. She pulled out her wand from her pocket and with a slow twist of the wrist, her nightgown floated across the room towards her.</p><p><br/>  "Me? What have I done this time?" he asked as he closed the door. Draco made his way to sit on the bench of the vanity, watching his wife change, leaning back and rested his elbow against her tabletop. Draco was not one to gravel in his insecurities- often. But not indeed when it came to his wife. Their relationship was balanced. Neither Astoria nor Draco had ever done something to anger the other.</p><p><br/> Astoria got into the bed and pulled the blanket over her lap and looked at him. "You're scared. You need to be more confident in your ability to be a good father."<br/> Ah. There it was again. The same conversation from the night she delivered. Draco didn't understand how she could see straight through him, even when he had not realized what he was doing. Was he so poor at hiding his emotions?</p><p><br/> "I don't believe I understand. I feel I am perfectly capable of being a good father," Draco answered, his voice smooth and unbothered.</p><p><br/> Astoria raised her eyebrow at him, and Draco knew his charade was up. Draco turned away from her and sighed, running his hand over his mouth as he thought. "I don't know what it is, Astoria. I feel afraid that I might... break him and hurt him by just being me. He's so small and fragile, and I only want what's best for him. I love him so much, and I want to give him the best life." Draco spilled out his feelings to her, and he immediately felt lighter. He glanced at his wife again before facing her. Crossing his legs with his hands neatly folded in his lap.</p><p><br/> Astoria was looking down at her lap, paying close attention to his words by the look on her face. She then looked up at him and smiled. The type of smile that took Draco's breath away. "You are seriously foolish; you know that?"</p><p><br/> Draco was about to protest, but she held her hand up to him, quickly shutting him down "You contradict yourself, Darling. You say you might hurt him, but you love him so much and want just to make him happy. Look," she said and sighed, her eyes flicking to the door, and Draco knew what and who she was referring to. "I know Lucius is not one to take an example from. But do everything you wished he would've done for you and you'll be amazing."</p><p><br/> Draco deflated a bit and sighed. "It's not as easy as that, Astoria. What if I turn into him? Turn into a sour man and take it out on Scorpius unintentionally," he explained, the fear of the unknown consuming him. It always did. From the moment he realized his father fought for the wrong side in the war to now. It was a fear he lived with every day.</p><p><br/> Astoria frowned at him and patted the bed next to her. "Come here," she said, her voice soft and gentle. Draco nodded and stood up from the bench and shortened the distance between them and sat on the bed, placing his hand on the blanket, allowing her to set her own over his.</p><p><br/> "You are not going to end up like your father, you hear? You-" Astoria cut herself off and stared off into the room, thinking. "You could write," she suggested, looking back at him and shrugged.</p><p><br/> "Write? Write what?" Draco asked and had to fight the urge to roll his eyes at her. It certainly did feel that she was now just babbling anything that came to mind.</p><p><br/> "Write letters," she continued, sitting up a bit now, her confidence in her plan shining through. "Yes. Write letters to Scorpius. Write about how much you love him and care about him and of his good and bad times. Let those letters remind you what you're fighting for, Draco." Astoria gently brushed her thumb against his hand.</p><p><br/> Draco watched her fingers and let the thought sink in. It wasn't the worst idea, and it wouldn't hurt to try. He nodded slowly and looked back at her. "Alright, I'll give it a go."</p><p><br/> Astoria's face broke out into a radiant grin, and she leaned over to kiss his cheek. "Perfect. And if it doesn't help, we'll revisit this conversation and see what to do next. Now, go back down to our baby and let me rest," she said, her smile still evident as she shifted around to lay down.</p><p><br/> Draco let a soft chuckle escape from his lips and nodded. "Alright, love," he said and leaned over to kiss her head before getting up and walked out of the room. Draco carefully closed the door before letting out a heavy sigh. Writing? It felt silly, but he promised her he'd try and he had never broken a promise to her.</p><p><br/> Draco headed back down the stairs and back to the study, where he could hear Narcissa speaking mixing with Scorpius' soft cooing. The sounds made him smile. He knew that if anything, Scorpius would have two beautiful and strong women to depend on.</p><p><br/> "Sorry to keep you waiting," Draco announced as he walked back in. His parents hadn't moved from the position from before, but now Lucius was the one holding Scorpius, with an expression of slight interest as Scorpius held onto his finger and cooed.</p><p><br/> Lucius looked up at him and shook his head slightly before turning his attention back to his grandson. "No, bother. We are keeping ourselves occupied."</p><p><br/> Narcissa used her fingers to cover her mouth as she smiled and watched her husband. Her eyes turned back up and reached out and guiding Draco to sit next to her. "Quite. Scorpius is certainly a cheery baby."</p><p><br/> Draco sat down and leaned over slightly, his chest feeling warm at the sight of his baby's chubby face taking in the world in with no fears or fuss. He certainly had that best baby.</p><p><br/> Narcissa leaned back and turned to him. "Sorry we weren't able to come to the hospital," she whispered. "It took longer than expected to leave Romania."<br/> Draco nodded and placed his hand on hers. "It's alright. But will you be going back soon?"</p><p><br/> Narcissa frowned and nodded. "Yes. We'll need to be back by the end of the day. Your father still has a lot of work to do," she said before reaching over to lightly pinch Scorpius' cheek a soft grin forming on her lips.</p><p><br/> Draco was so pleased to see that his parents- both parents loved his son so much. He knew his mother would always be supportive, but his father had been a different story. He didn't want him to be cold nor distant to his child, knowing far too well what emotional setbacks that would cause. But seeing him here, with his son was more than Draco could've asked for.</p><p><br/> The three of them sat like that for a while. Lucius and Narcissa were going back and forth to hold Scorpius and amuse him while Draco patiently watched, knowing that he had his whole life to carry him and not to be impatient.</p><p><br/> But it wasn't long before Scorpius started to get red and with a disgruntled expression started to cry. Lucius- who was holding him was physically shocked and held him out at arm's length, unsure what to do. Draco didn't know it, but he had the same expression, reaching out, pleased that Lucius held no objection to passing his grandchild away. Draco kept him close to his chest and gently bounced him. "My boy, what is wrong? Are you alright?" he whispered as he brought his son's face close to his own.</p><p><br/> Narcissa, who had been smiling cheekily at the two men, leaned over to Draco, speaking over his shoulder. "He'll be hungry by this time," she said quietly.</p><p><br/> Draco looked over his shoulder, and his racing mind started to calm down. "Right, of course," he said and walked over to the carrier and in one of the compartments pulled out a bottle. He wrapped his hand around it, making sure the enchantment still kept it warm and fresh. "Alright, my boy. Just relax," he said and sat back on the couch, pulling the cap off with his fingers before holding the end to his baby's mouth, sighing in relief when Scorpius started to suckle, his cries stopping immediately.</p><p><br/> "A bottle? Why aren't you taking him to Astoria?" Narcissa questioned. "I thought we all agreed we all agreed on breastfeeding," she added, her lips pursed together.</p><p><br/> Draco nodded, his eyes fixated on his son. "We did. This is her breastmilk. We decided bottles would be more convenient from time to time," he answered, hearing the tone of his mother's voice. He loved both her and Astoria, but it was no secret the two butted heads occasionally, especially when it came to motherhood.</p><p><br/> Lucius watched his wife try to restrain herself and placed his hand on her knee. "Narcissa. You can bring this up to Astoria at a later date," he said, surprisingly calm.</p><p><br/> Both Draco and Narcissa looked up at him. Both wearing questing looks. "That was quite diplomatic of you, dear. How come?" Narcissa asked.</p><p><br/> Lucius gave them both a pointed look before turning away and getting up. "As long as he isn't screaming his lungs out for going hungry, I do not care how his milk is delivered," he said and straightened out his robe. "Come, the elves should have tea served in the parlour," he said and started to walk away from the three of them.</p><p><br/> Draco watched him go before turning to his mother, smiling at her. "He's got the point, you know," he said and got up carefully, making sure not to shift Scorpius around too much.</p><p><br/> Narcissa let out a sigh and nodded. "I suppose so," she replied and got up as well. Draco watched her meet her husband at the door before they both walked to the parlour. Draco took this time to pull the bottle away, giving Scorpius a rest for a moment. "You are so loved, my boy. I hope that this will last forever. But no matter what, your mother and I will always love you more than anyone else in the world" he whispered and kissed the top of his head, and as Draco lowered the bottle back to his tiny mouth, he could've sworn he was smiling.</p><p><br/> Draco had fed Scorpius two more times and changed his diaper a total of four times by the end of the day. He was carrying his sleeping baby against his chest with a blanket to cover him as both him and Astoria waved off Narcissa and Lucius after dinner was over. Once the two apparated, the couple hurried inside and let one of the house elves lock up.</p><p><br/> Astoria yawned and sighed. "Gosh, I can't believe I'm still tired," she said and lifted her dinner dress as she followed her husband upstairs to retire for the night.<br/> "Well, you are supposed to be on complete bedrest," he mused as he splayed his hand over Scorpius' back, gently rubbing it to keep him asleep.</p><p><br/> "Not complete bedrest," she teased back, and when they reached the top, Astoria reached out to Scorpius. "Let me put him to bed. I feel lost not seeing him most of the day."</p><p><br/> Draco felt reluctant to hand his baby to her, mainly because the weight of him on his chest was so comforting, plus how could he part from the most precious thing to him?. "Are you sure, love? You're tired, and he's already asleep."</p><p><br/> Astoria raised her eyebrow at him before a smirk grew on her lips. "Don't worry dear. Tonight if you're on night duty, remember," she said and leaned up to kiss him.</p><p><br/> "Right," he said and couldn't help but smile. Even the proposition of having to wake up multiple times a night for his baby seemed terrific to him. "Alright," he said and ever so gently pulled Scorpius away from his chest, holding him in his arms for a moment, basking in his son's cuteness. Draco leaned over and kissed his face, peppering a few more. "Goodnight, my sweet boy. I love you," he whispered against his cheek before planting another kiss and handed him to Astoria.</p><p><br/> Astoria was smiling at them as she took Scorpius and gently wrapped him up as she cradled him in one arm. "God, look at us. I never thought I would love someone more than you," she said and glanced up at Draco.<br/> <br/> Draco stood beside her and continued to have his eyes fixated on their boy. "Same," he breathed out. He then turned to her and found her smiling right back. With a beat, he leaned over and pecked her lips. "But you're a close second," he teased.<br/> <br/> A laughter erupted from her before Astoria quickly covered her mouth, hoping she didn't wake up Scorpius. "Well, so are you," she bit back and relaxed. "This is good. I'm glad we're on the same page."<br/> <br/> "Me too," Draco whispered.<br/> <br/> Astoria yawned again and stepped back towards the nursery. "Well, I better put him to bed," she said. Astoria then took Scorpius' tiny arm and lifted it up, waving it to Draco. "Goodnight, dad," she said in a silly baby voice.</p><p><br/> Draco gave her a crooked grin and shook her head lovingly. "You are too much," he said and leaned over to kiss her temple before letting them go. He stood there for a moment with his hands in his pocket, watching as Astoria stepped into his nursery. He wished he could follow them, but decided against it. He knew she was going to nurse him one last time before going to sleep and she wanted some bonding time with him. And as a Healer Draco knew how important the bond between a mother and baby were.</p><p><br/> With a heavy sigh, Draco made his way back to the bedroom. He closed the door behind him and started to undress, closing his eyes as he raised his wand to change himself out of his dinner suit into his night clothes. Draco walked to his side of the bed and laid down. He stared up at the ceiling with his hands rested on his abdomen as he recalled the day.</p><p><br/> His son. His Scorpius was two days and fifteen hours old. He was no longer than his forearm and had fed well that day. But then why, when everything went so smoothly did his chest hurt? Draco furrowed his brows and rubbed his chest. He knew why but he didn't want to admit it. He was afraid. He was afraid that there would come a day when things don't go smoothly. A day when his mother and wife will argue or a day when his father is harsh or a day where he himself might be cold and unforgiving. The idea of anything hurting his child made him sick the stomach, but the fear of being a source of that pain made his whole body ache from his heart, out. Draco had to keep himself in check. He couldn't let outbursts that may come go unnoticed. Its those times of rage he had to remind himself of the good in his son. The promise of the best life he made to him that morning he was born.</p><p><br/> Draco anxiously tapped his finger against his body as he glanced at the door. He knew Astoria was still with Scorpius and did not want to be disturbed. But being alone with his thoughts was nerve-wracking. What would Astoria say if she was with him, offering him her loving guidance? Of course, Draco knew what she would say.<br/> Draco pushed himself up and looked over at his writing desk in the corner of the room. He hadn't written at that desk for a while now, the only writing he did was business, and he always preferred to do that in his study. But it was far too late to go down, and Draco felt that this kind of writing deserved to be done in a more informal area of the house.</p><p><br/> Draco grabbed his nightgown and slid the silk over his shoulder and loosely tied it as he walked over. Draco rolled up the hood and found everything perfectly intact, undisturbed from the last time he opened this up. He drew out the chair and sat down and reached out to open his inkpot, placing the lid on the side as he brushed his hand along the peacock quill. He then leaned back and opened the long drawer in the middle, pulling the end of the parchment and dragging it along the top of the table and clipping it to the top, ensuring it would not slip while he wrote.</p><p><br/> Draco looked down at the empty parchment, the marbled page looking right back expectantly. Well, if the paper could have emotion, that is.</p><p><br/> Draco took in a deep breath and exhaled. It was now or never. He just hoped by the end of this; he would feel better. Draco reached out and picked up his quill, dipping it into his ink, tapping away the excess and held it to the top of the parchment and began to write.</p><p> </p><p><em>Dear Scorpius,</em><br/> <em>I write this letter to you to remind myself of the ups and downs I may face with you, though any memory with you is and forever will be dear to my heart. I hope when this letter is one day opened by you, you may find joy in reading your life through my eyes. My only wish is that we will be close enough that these feelings I pour out onto these pages will not surprise you and even when I am one day gone, these letters will stay with you and along with my memory bring you comfort.</em></p><p> </p><p>Draco pulled back and dipped his quill in his ink and blinked several times as he got a bit teary. When had he become so dramatic? Talking about a day when Scorpius would read felt far too into the future, let along a day when he will pass on. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>As I write this to you know, you are two days and sixteen hours old, marking the first night out of the hospital. So, I suppose this letter can be seen as your welcome home...</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p>
