    <p>Harry James Potter was a scrawny boy even though he was seventeen already he looked more like he could be twelve or thirteen. It wasn’t that his parents didn’t care about him, oh no that would be as far from the truth as can be, Lily and James Potter loved their son, they fed him and clothed him and made sure that he got everything that he deserved, yet he was far from spoiled, he was a very shy boy and very obedient, according to James he was the perfect little gentleman and he grumbled as he said this because Harry is more like his mother than he is like James. James described Harry’s lack of length and weight on “The growing spurt not yet functioning” Lily was optimistic in believing that once he leaves Hogwarts things will be better, Harry wasn’t so sure, being the Boy who lived didn’t sit so well with him at all, all his classmates were mean and vicious in the attempt of breaking the saviour of the wizarding world down.....</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore smirked where he paced in his office at Hogwarts, he had a secret that no one knew about not even his most faithful and trusted servant Severus Snape, the only ones that new of this secret were the Weasley’s apart from Fred and George, he couldn’t trust does brats if their lives depended on it, he was glad that they had left school otherwise he didn’t think that what he was planning would have worked out, no he needed to bid his time make sure everything was in order for his sweet master.....</p><p>Severus Snape sipped his tea in his house in Spinner’s end, looking over at his loyal and most trusted friend Lucius Malfoy, he stared at the man he knew since childhood as if couldn’t believe that what the man said was actually true. “ Narcissa is expecting again?, wow that is excellent news for someone her age?”” I believe congratulations is in order” Lucius smirked and blushed at the same time, he could hardly believe it himself when Cissy  told him that morning. “ Thank you my dear friend, yeah you should have seen Draco’s face when we told him, he went all shades of white that I didn’t even know existed it was classic to watch.” Severus laughed it would have been wonderful to see his Godson’s face, he was happy for the Malfoy’s they deserved some happiness in their lives....</p>
