    <p>“Fucking sirens,” James says, pressing his fingers into his temple, “they’re not even moving. Is it necessary to be this fucking loud when they’re parked?”  He tips his head back and rests it against the brick wall behind him.</p>
<p>“You’ve changed your tune,” Remus notes, nodding in James direction, “you were all for the sirens on the way here.”</p>
<p>“They’re not so bad when you haven’t been listening to them for three hours.”</p>
<p>“It’s been thirty-five minutes.” Remus chuckles and pushes away from the wall he was leaning against, shoving the sleeves of his windbreaker up as he walks a few feet away before turning around to face James again. “What do you think is taking so long?”</p>
<p>“How should I know?” James asks, throwing his hands in the air before letting them drop back to his side with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Well, why don’t we find out?” Remus questions, and with that he walks towards the cluster of people beside the cars without looking back to check if James is following.</p>
<p>Remus doesn’t need to ask, though, because as soon as he’s within earshot, he hears his superior, Agent McDougal, conversing with another man that he doesn’t recognise. He motions subtly for James to follow him behind the closest car.</p>
<p>“What -” James begins to ask, but Remus cuts him off.</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“…through the back, seeing as the front has been barricaded.” The man says, nodding his head in the direction of the bank.</p>
<p>“It’s a no-go right now. This guy is way too hostile and it seems like he’ll put a round into anything that moves towards him. We’re waiting on Whitehead. He’s about half an hour out, but he’s the closest trained negotiator, so we’ll have to wait.” McDougal explains, arms lifting up in a <em>what can you do </em>motion.</p>
<p>“We’ll keep the fire door in the back propped open for now, just let us know when he gets here.” McDougal nods as the other man turns and walks back to the other side of the building.</p>
<p>“Wh -” James begins to ask again, but this time he’s cut off by a female voice.</p>
<p>“Sir,” she says, sounding out of breath, and Remus immediately recognises her as Lily Evans, another agent that reports to McDougal. “There’s, well, there’s a woman giving birth in there,” she rushes out.</p>
<p>“There’s <em>what?</em>” McDougal asks, and Lily nods quickly.</p>
<p>“One of the hostages, she’s pregnant. Well, I guess she won’t be pregnant for much longer.”</p>
<p>“For fuck’s sake,” McDougal mutters before looking down at his phone again. Remus can only presume that he’s checking the time. “Not much we can do.” He shrugs before pushing past her. Lily falters for a second, as if debating calling after him, but deciding against it. </p>
<p> “Okay,” James says finally, turning to Remus, “what was that about?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear?” Remus asks, eyes narrowed, “there’s no way we have time to wait for a goddamn negotiator.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying, Remus?” James punctuates his question with a look over his shoulder at McDougal, who is currently pacing along the path at the front of the bank.</p>
<p>“Well,” Remus says slowly, tipping his head towards a small cluster of people standing at the corner of the bank leading to the back wall.</p>
<p>“Oh,” James lets out, a smile spreading across his face, “brilliant.”</p>
<p>Remus smacks James on the shoulder for encouragement before turning to step out from behind the car, but he’s met by the face of Lily Evans.</p>
<p>“What are you two doing?” she says, her hand on Remus’ chest as she pushes him back, almost causing him to stumble over his own feet.</p>
<p>“We’re about to be heroes, Evans.” James says from behind Remus, attempting to manoeuvre around him.</p>
<p>“And exactly<em>how</em>do you plan to do that?” She asks, stepping to her right to block James’ path.</p>
<p>“Look,” Remus says, standing up straight, “Lily, we don’t have time for this. That woman in there needs some help.”</p>
<p>Lily looks torn, but sighs. “Whatever,” she says, “I don’t even want to know. Go and get yourselves sacked.” She waves her hand at them dismissively before turning and walking away.</p>
<p>Remus turns to James and nods once, and the two of them head in the direction of the bank.</p>
<p>As they come closer to the entrance, a single fire door being propped open by a heavy duffel-bag, Remus realises that he doesn’t have a plan to slip past any of the local policemen that are gathered near the door. </p>
<p>“Hey,” he calls to them when he’s around five metres away, “We’re NCA. Lupin,” he explains, pointing to himself, “this is Potter,” he continues, nodding towards James. </p>
<p>“We’ve got the okay to enter now,” James says, reaching for the door to open it further, but one of the uniformed policemen gets there before.</p>
<p>“Sorry mate, but we can’t let anyone in until we get the order from a senior agent.” He says as he shepherds them away from the door.</p>
<p>Remus hears a shout come through the door, sounding far away, decides that there most definitely is not time for this, and runs. He hears shouting and scuffling behind him, but he doesn’t look back until he makes it through the back offices and comes to glass door of the bank’s main hall. He half expected to be pulled back before he got here, but there’s nothing they can do now as he stares at the back of the robber’s head.</p>
<p>He jumps when James comes to a stop at his side, breathing heavily. Apparently, so does the robber, because Remus and James are forced to jump away from the open door, their backs against the wall to either side of it, when he turns around and begins shooting.</p>
<p>“They’re readying some officers,” James shouts over the gunfire and breaking glass, “to come and get the hostages. They’re not happy.”</p>
<p>“No.” Remus laughs, shouting back, “I don’t imagine they would be.”</p>
<p>“So,” James whispers once the gunfire stops, “you have a plan? </p>
<p>“No,” Remus replies, removing the gun from his belt and turning the handle of the door. He pushes the door open, still hidden by the wall, and the shooting begins again.</p>
<p>“What’s his name?” Remus questions frantically, looking toward James. </p>
<p>“Oh, fuck.” James stops unholstering his own gun, “McCarthy!” He says finally. “Richard McCarthy.”</p>
<p>“Richard!” Remus shouts, and the fire stops again. “Richard,” he says once more, calmer this time. “How are you doing?” He nods at James and moves through the door, gun drawn.</p>
<p>“Nice day, isn’t it?” He notes, tilting his head towards the huge windows lining the wall on the left side of the hall as he slowly makes his way forward. “Can I call you Rich?” He doesn’t answer, so Remus continues.</p>
<p>“I’m here to help you out,” he says, taking another step forward, but stopping suddenly when Richard shifts. </p>
<p>“Stop,” Richard says, voice cracking and hands shaking.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Remus says calmly, lifting his hands up beside his head in a defensive position, gun pointing to the ceiling. “This is it, Richard. There are more people coming in behind me. Doing anything else is just going to get you a longer sentence.” He begins to walk forward again. Richard takes a shaky breath and lowers his gun, and Remus takes the opportunity to speed up his pace.</p>
<p>“You haven’t hurt anyone, Richard. It’s going to be fine,” Remus reassures him. “Toss the gun away.”</p>
<p>Richard closes his eyes softly, readjusts his grip and fires a shot straight at Remus. The bullet cuts through the windbreaker and his jumper and connects with his arm and he cries out. Remus guesses that Richard has never <em>actually </em>shot someone before, because the stunned look on his face is all Remus needs to make a grab for the gun, gripping the barrel and wrenching it out of Richard's grasp before sliding it along the floor behind him. Richard struggles, but he’s not a huge man, and Remus’ height gives him the advantage. He manages to pin him to the floor, knee on his back as he closes the handcuffs around Richard’s wrists. Remus looks up from the struggling man to see James sitting in the corner, hand white as the woman lying next to him clings to it. He pushes some fallen hair out of her face, and he murmurs softly to her.</p>
<p>After handing Richard over to some other officers, Remus makes his way out of the bank and out to where the hostages are being looked over, but before he can begin to talk to anyone, a paramedic is pulling him down onto a fold out chair and removing his coat.</p>
<p>“Woah, what are you doing?” Remus questions, trying to get to his feet, but the paramedic only pushes him back down.</p>
<p>“Stay there, please, you were shot. You need to be checked out.”</p>
<p>Remus had almost forgotten about that. The paramedic pushes up the sleeve of his jumper and begins to disinfect the wound, which brings back the pain. Remus thinks that this probably isn’t that bad, and that a real gunshot wound probably hurts a lot more than this, but he still swears when disinfectant hits it.</p>
<p>“Just a graze,” the paramedic says as he wraps a bandage around Remus’ arm and tapes the end down before stepping to the side to allow Remus to stand up, handing him his coat back.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Remus mumbles dismissively, pulling his sleeve back down and walking away, coat in hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>“You’ll <em>never </em>guess what this crazy fucker did,” James announces when they enter the office a couple of hours later.</p>
<p>“Tripped over his oversized legs and fell onto a bullet?” Peter Pettigrew asks as he walks toward them, eyeing Remus’ arm with a grin on his face.</p>
<p>“Talked down a hostile hostage taker and came away with only a graze.” James corrects, throwing his arm around Remus’ shoulder. “I reckon that deserves a drink tonight, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course <em>you</em> do,” comes the voice of Sirius Black from his desk “Can’t say no to the bottle, can you, Jamie?”</p>
<p>“Black!” Remus grins at him, dropping the case file onto Sirius’ desk and leaning against it with his arms crossed. “Better than your last case, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Lupin. You know fine well that I’ve made more arrests than you this quarter,” he says, pointing his pen at Remus accusingly.</p>
<p>“Quality over quantity, my friend.” Remus counters, “Quality over -”</p>
<p>“Lupin!” A voice interrupts his bragging and Remus looks to the back of the room to see McGonagall standing at the door to her office, holding it open.</p>
<p>“Ooh,” James sings, “Someone’s in trouble.” He tries to dodge it, but Remus hits him over the head quickly and James shoves him back. He re-balances himself and heads toward McGonagall’s office as the entire room watches. </p>
<p>“Remus,” she says as soon as he closes the door, “have a seat.” He lowers himself into the chair on the other side of the desk from hers, and waits for her to finish writing something down. He has a feeling that she’s prolonging  his wait on purpose.</p>
<p>“Do you know why you’re here?” she asks, finally looking up at him.</p>
<p>“Yes,” is all Remus says.</p>
<p>“Pray tell,” she urges, motioning to him.</p>
<p>“I disobeyed orders and created a dangerous situation,” Remus concedes, before continuing. “I helped a vulnerable woman and multiple hostages, while also taking down an armed criminal.”</p>
<p>“Remus -” McGonagall tried to argue, but he cuts her off.</p>
<p>“I <em>know </em>I didn’t listen to my superior, but I trusted by instinct and I saved people<em>.</em>”</p>
<p>“Yes, it may well have worked out fine. But you could have been shot. You could have been killed. You could have spooked that man and gotten the hostages killed.” She pauses, but Remus doesn’t say anything. “We have procedures for a reason, and you can’t go around breaking them for some time as a hero.”</p>
<p>“That’s not -”</p>
<p>“Be that as it may, Remus, but you’re suspended from all large-scale cases for the foreseeable future,” she tells him, handing him a typed formal notice.</p>
<p>“You can’t do that,” Remus argues, dropping the notice onto her desk. </p>
<p>“We can, and we are. I’m sorry Remus, but you need to learn to control your impulses before we send you into something like this again.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” Remus says through his teeth, “whatever you think his best.”</p>
<p>“For now, I have a placement for you, quite near here,” she offers, pointing to a case file lying underneath the discarded notice. “It’s small-scale, low risk. You’ll be living in a flat, owned by Mr David Bennett. He’s a suspected drug dealer and money launderer and lives in the flat above. You would simply be collecting information and evidence,” she finishes.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Remus sighs, “it should be nice to have some time to myself. </p>
<p>“Oh, no.” McGonagall chuckles. “You misunderstand, Sirius Black will be accompanying you.”</p>
<p>Remus groans, letting his head tip back. Black is a good detective and great fun to wind up, but the idea of spending any amount of time stuck in the same place as him doesn’t exactly appeal to Remus.</p>
<p>“Oh.” She grins. “Also, the landlord, how should I put this? He swings the other way. So, it would be in the best interests of the case if you and Black were to, you know, play some make believe – give him something to talk to you about.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Remus deadpans, picking up the notice and the case file and heading for the door, “thank you for your time.”</p>
