    <p>Storms weren't an uncommon occurrence where Virgil lived as a baby. They practically happened every week, and he and his mother would sit by the window and watch the rain from her rocking chair. The thunder sometimes scared Virgil, but when it did he would just grab onto his mother's black and purple cloak and she would hum to him, keeping him calm. It was calm. Rain meant calm, peaceful nights. Rain meant puddles to play in when morning rolled around, when the rain stopped.</p><p>So Virgil enjoyed the rain. So when he fell asleep one night when it was raining, he didn't expect for his mother not to come home the next day. He definitely didn't expect a nice police officer lady to come by and bring him to an orphanage. He didn't expect to be given his mother's cloak, freshly washed, and left with a ton of other children he didn't know, at an orphanage where his mother's best friend from college worked(surprisingly there actually weren't a lot of other children - about seven at most).</p><p>He lost his mother when he was only 2 and a half.</p><p> </p><p>Three years later Virgil would be adopted by a kind seeming man. He didn't stay kind though. Virgil accidentally lit one of his plants on fire - he kept a lot of potted plants at his house. That was when the abuse started. It was mostly verbal, but sometimes he would be hit. He was taken out of that home after three years and sent back to live with Ms. Dahlia at the orphanage. She didn't let anyone else adopt him, and basically became a substitute mother to him.</p><p>Ms. Dahlia told Virgil everything she knew about his mother. She helped him patch up his mother cloak whenever it would get damaged. He practically slept with that cloak as his blanket, as it was big enough for his mother to even do that.</p><p>He didn't have many friends in the orphanage - just one. A kid named Ceyin who insisted to be called by they/them pronouns instead of she/her, like everyone tried to do. They kept their thick, dishwater blonde hair cut short too, which Ms. Dahlia was fine with. He and Ceyin were Ms. Dahlia's favorite children, though she told them never to tell the other kids.</p><p>Ceyin had the same "problem" as him. Things would happen around them with absolutely no explanation. It could range from lighting things on fire, to disappearing and reappearing in random places. It was strange, but it was who they were, both Ceyin and Virgil. The two of them stuck together - even if Ceyin tried to make friends with some of the other kids.</p><p>They even had their birthdays in the same month, actually. December. Virgil was born on December 19th, while Ceyin was born on December 23rd. Usually that meant joint birthday parties for the two of them as well. Neither of them minded: double the fun, double the cake, and double the presents. They both celebrated their birthdays with the other kids in the orphanage on December 21st.</p><p>Their 11th birthday party was the same as usual. Celebrate from noon until two hours after their bed time and go to bed, stuffed with good food and cuddling a new stuffed toy each. No one suspected anything strange to happen on New Year's Day.</p><p>So the letters were a surprise.</p><p>A knock on the door early in the morning was an uncommon occurrence, so already Ms. Dahlia was confused and surprised. When she opened the door to be presented with a woman wearing robes...well, that just added to the surprise.</p><p>"I assume you are Ms. Fildrey Dahlia?" The woman stated with a thick Scottish accent. Even her voice gave off a strict grandmotherly vibe.</p><p>Ms. Dahlia's eyes were wide, but she gave a slight nod.</p><p>"Then may I come in?" The woman asked, to be allowed into the orphanage.</p><p>The two of them exchanged pleasantries - the woman introducing herself as Minerva McGonagall - until Virgil came downstairs with his purple hair(he dyed it two years ago and hasn't let it fade a bit) it's usual bedhead he has after waking up, and his mother's cloak around his shoulders(rolled up and pinned off using a safety pin so it didn't brush the ground and drag of course). He blinked at the two women, slowly walking over to Ms. Dahlia. She offered Virgil a gentle smile and held her arm out to him. He pressed herself against her side, wrapped up in both his mother's cloak and her arm, he felt safe enough to interact with this stranger. He looked at Minerva and waved to her in greeting.</p><p>"He's fairly shy around new people and doesn't like talking to strangers. Do you understand sign language?" Ms. Dahlia asked Minerva, and she gave a nod.</p><p>"I understand. Hello, my name is Minerva McGonagall." She introduced herself to this strange, quiet child. She watched his hands for a moment as he signed out something, and she took a moment to recognize what he said. 'Hello. My name is Virgil Raveina.' He had to spell out his name. "Virgil? You're one of the people I was here for, actually." She pulled an envelope out of her robes(it seemed old, Virgil noticed curiously), and held it out to him. He blinked at it then looked up at Ms. Dahlia, who nodded to him, so he reached forward and took the envelope. ''There is another child I am here for as well. A Ceyin Nydiel?"</p><p>"Virgil, was Ceyin still asleep when you left?" Ms. Dahlia asked the boy wrapped in purple and black, and he nods, staring at the envelope with wonder in his eyes. He had never gotten any mail before. "They'll likely be down in about an hour. Virgil, would you like to help me with breakfast?" Hearing his name broke him out of his daze, and he nodded to Ms. Dahlia.</p><p>The two of them worked on breakfast, Virgil having placed the letter in a pocket in his mother's cloak(and taken said cloak off to keep it clean as he helped his foster mother make breakfast). As soon as they were done, Ms. Dahlia went upstairs to wake the children(currently there were only nine of them - someone had been adopted just yesterday), leaving Virgil and Minerva alone. </p><p>As soon as breakfast was done with, Ms. Dahlia let all the children go outside after making sure they were all bundled up, except for Virgil and Ceyin. The two of them sat next to Ms. Dahlia's across from Minerva, Virgil wrapped in his mother's cloak again and pressed against Ms. Dahlia's side. They were both nervous, though Ceyin obviously less so, especially after they were given their envelope. Virgil is holding his again, turning it over in his hands.</p><p>"Now, I'd like to explain what those are for before you open them. They're an invitation to come to our school - Hogwarts." Virgil muffled a snicker in his mother's cloak, gaining a soft glare from Minerva. He instantly stopped snickering and shrank away from her, even after the glare is replaced with a softer look. Ms. Dahlia gently rubbed his shoulders as he curled up into her. "As I was saying...You two have the ability to use and control a thing known as magic - now don't interrupt me, I'm not done explaining." She stated as Ceyin opened their mouth to say something. They instantly shut their mouth with a soft click. "Yes, magic is real. And you two have it. Has anything strange, seemingly unexplainable happened around you two? That, is accidental magic, what happens when someone is unable to control their magic. It happens to all magical children. I am the headmistress of this school, and I believe you two would be wonderful additions to our school, and you deserve to learn how to control your magic." That...certainly explained the fires. Virgil glanced over to Ceyin, and they seem to come to the same conclusion, looking at him with wide, grey eyes. Minvera smiled faintly and gestured to their envelopes. "Open them." Virgil quickly does as told, taking out two sheets of...paper? This isn't like any paper he's ever seen...He has a little bit of difficulty reading the looping script, but he manages.</p><p> </p><p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</p><p>Headmistress: Minerva McGonagall</p><p>Dear Virgil Raveina</p><p>       We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
