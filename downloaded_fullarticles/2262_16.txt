  <strong>I wrote this ages ago, but I'm trying to move more stuff over to AO3 cus I have over 200 published things on FF and only 100 or so here, so I should get on that. On we go.</strong>
</p><p>-YDHP-</p><p>He <em>hated </em>networking. <em>Hated</em> socialising. Most of all, Vlad <em>hated </em>post-war parties.</p><p>Not because the end of the war wasn't an enormous reason to celebrate. It was that Vlad was a begrudged guest and the looks he got reminded him. He might be Harry Potters best friend, he might have been a part of the effort to bring down Voldemort, and he even might be the Chosen One, the Grand High Vampire.</p><p>But his invitation was purely for appeasement. Not as a celebration.</p><p>All the same... Vlad wasn't sorry he came. If rhere was one thing a vampire could appreciate in breathers other than their blood type, it was <em>elegance. </em>Innate grace and poise, carried flawlessly and appearing effortless. And by all that was evil, Vlad was surely looking at the embodiment of elegance.</p><p>Granted, she was more than twice his age. A <em>mother. </em>A mother to a good friend of Vlad's, no less. But he was immortal. Age was scarcely relevant since he turned eighteen and ended up in charge of a whole species. And she was <strong>gorgeous, </strong>pale colouring and that particularly intriguing hair with its layers of white blonde and black twisting together in soft braids that tumbled through the other, looser locks.</p><p>Draco would dust him for even thinking it. Vlad was glad for his solid Occlumency shields, as he was having dangerous thoughts about the woman currently performing that polite, somehow appearing-genuine laugh that one needed for such an occasion. It was soft and tinkling and he could hear it across the room, making his stomach fizzle pleasantly.</p><p>"You're being a little too obvious. At least to a vampire."</p><p>Ingrid sidled up to him, cheeks slightly pink which gave away that she had imbibed over a pint of blood within the last hour. That probably accounted for the slightly glazed eyes.</p><p>"Are you <em>drunk?</em>"</p><p>His sister shook her head, smirking. It was almost a smile.</p><p>"Mildly tipsy at best. Wizards blood is a delicacy."</p><p>"Ingrid-"</p><p>"He's alive, unturned, don't blow a blood vessel. He offered."</p><p>Of course he had. Vlad sometimes forgot Ingrid had the effect of dissolving most males - and some females - higher brain functions. Her vampire pheromones were uncommonly strong, and she had all the usual pale skin, dark hair, sharp fangs to say she wasn't hard on the eyes either. Vlad had to admit it else he would seem like some jealous brat; plus Ingrid would stake him. He had the power, she had the looks. Sibling rivalry and all.</p><p>Narcissa Malfoy was moving again, drawing Vlad's eye like flies to a corpse. Or a moth to a flame, if he wanted not to garner strange looks from present company. Ingrid excluded.</p><p>"Are you going to go talk to her? Or are you going to stand here like a breather virgin who's terrified of women?"</p><p>Vlad glared at her. Unfortunately, glares had no effect on Ingrid. She was a Dracula. Dracula glares worked on everyone. Except <em>other</em> Draculas.</p><p>"You mean am I going to get myself ashed by chatting up my friends <em>mother </em>because she happens to look good in a dress?"</p><p>"Yes. Ask her to dance. You've had enough bloody classes."</p><p>He cringed; Vlad had not been much for grace and balance when he was a teen. Many hours practice with various instructors and tutors and even Ingrid had forced his skills to improve. It was necessary for his job.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"If you don't I will. Or I'll go finish that guy off."</p><p>"Are you threatening to break the cease-fire to force me to make a fool of myself?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Ingrid was being deadly serious. Vlad sighed, but there was a welcome reprieve.</p><p>"She's dancing with the Minister. No murders."</p><p>She rolled her eyes and slipped away to cause havoc elsewhere. Reeking of Butterbeer and clearly tipsy, Harry found him next.</p><p>"Vladdo!"</p><p>"Harry!"</p><p>They hugged with smiles, and Harry pulled out an age old joke.</p><p>"You ought to get outside more. You're looking a bit pale."</p><p>"Jackass."</p><p>"Love you too Vlad. Having fun?"</p><p>Harry had his Order Of Merlin still slung around his neck, which Vlad reckoned would end up in a pile of barely-looked at stuff in Harry's home. Vlad lived with him there when he was in the UK, though he had his own castle in Transylvania. Harry had his own space in Vlad's home too. Turned up whenever he felt like it; he had a portkey since the apparition distance was a little much for most.</p><p><em>"Thrilling.</em> Can't you tell?"</p><p>"Honestly you look <em>dead </em>bored. Bored stiff. Hehe. Stiff. Dead. Coffin."</p><p>"I think you've had enough to drink."</p><p>Harry stuck his tongue out, then peered around to check they were alone before sidling closer.</p><p>"Don't judge me, but I might have checked out Draco's mom."</p><p>"I'll pass that on to your girlfriend."</p><p>His friend feigned shock.</p><p>"Gin would probably say she agreed. Anyway. I had to tell someone and Draco would gut me."</p><p>Vlad chuckled.</p><p>"She dances well."</p><p>"You won't know until you dance with her. Go ask her."</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"I can't. You must!"</p><p>Harry grabbed Vlad by the wrist and dragged him from his happy perch in the shadows watching. Vlad was physically capable of resisting and rebutting Harry's insistence, but he was allowing himself to be dragged for some reason.</p><p>"Mrs Malfoy!"</p><p>Lucifer, Vlad was embarrassed. Narcissa Malfoy turned, all five foot three of her in a gentle twirl, and looked at Harry who still had Vlad by the wrist. Unfortunately, the Minister was nowhere to be seen so Vlad couldn't tell Harry she was with someone else.</p><p>"Yes Mr Potter?"</p><p>"Vlad wanted to ask you to dance but I did it for him so here, dance. Bye!"</p><p>Vlad was going to <em>kill </em>him. Harry ran off, vanishing between a throng of bodies. Vlad was left with Narcissa Malfoy eyeing him oddly.</p><p>"I'm sorry. Harry's a bit drunk. I just said you dance very well and he hauled me over."</p><p>She surveyed him with keen eyes, making Vlad very aware she was almost thirty years his senior. Certain parts of him didn't mind that at all.</p><p>"So you don't want to dance?"</p><p>"Oh. Well... I'm here now?"</p><p>Narcissa offered him a smile. Vlad's dead heart spasmed in his chest. She held a hand out, observing the etiquette of a courting couples first dance. He tried not to read into it as Vlad took her hand - hellfire her skin <strong>was</strong> <em>hot </em>on his chilled exterior - and they stepped closer. The music wasn't terribly slow, but it was no rapid tempo and meant they moved almost leisurely. She made it look so effortless and he envied that; Vlad still worried about where to put his feet.</p><p>"You're very good for one so young."</p><p>Well, she <em>sounded </em>genuine.</p><p>"Heh. That's a new one."</p><p>"How do you mean?"</p><p>Narcissa followed his steps flawlessly, seemingly unaffected by his cold hand on her waist.</p><p>"I'm at least two centuries younger than any of my Council. Normally my age is the first to be insulted."</p><p>"Oh yes" her voice stayed even despite the gentle spin "you're a vampire. I forget you see."</p><p>"How? I'm six inches from your face with ice cold skin and no pulse."</p><p>"Perhaps. But I've seen many men less <em>human</em> than yourself Vladimir."</p><p>He tried not to get embarrassed, but that was just about the best compliment anybody had ever paid him.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>She smiled again, even more genuine than before. Vlad made a regretful observation.</p><p>"The song is over."</p><p>"I will allow you another if you so wish."</p><p>If Vlad wasn't mistaken, she stepped a little closer. Her perfume was a dream come true for him; light, unobtrusive on his vampire senses. A little spicy on the inhale. He had to stop himself inhaling at her neck.</p><p>Lucifer, her <em>neck.</em></p><p>Vlad had been told breather women could be aged by their neck no matter how well they tended their face. But Narcissa was perhaps late forties, perhaps fifty and her throat was a pristine column the barely-adult vampire was embarrassingly hung up on.</p><p>"Should I be fearing for my human status?"</p><p>Oh fuck, had she noticed? Vlad wrenched his eyes away from the sweeping line of her neck.</p><p>"N-no. I'm sorry. I don't often get this close to breathers since I left Hogwarts."</p><p>Her hand brushed the back of his neck, the feathery touch of warmth sending heat through his bitterly cold body. He bit back a gasp, hoping he didn't stumble. Narcissa rested her hand upon his shoulder as Vlad remembered there was a dip in their dances rhythm.</p><p>This was a bad idea.</p><p>This was <em>bliss.</em></p><p>Her lithe form matched every step, a demure grace oozing from her every pore. Narcissa smelled like cinnamon under her perfume; her blood sweet with a spiced wine of some kind, perhaps a pudding at the earlier meal.</p><p>"I would dare impose on you for another song, but I fear rumours would be rife."</p><p>"I hardly imagine that. I'm old enough to be your mother."</p><p>Vlad made himself let her tempting warmth go, but he left her with a parting quip.</p><p>"My mother is almost three hundred."</p><p>Then he went outside, needing some air not full of warmth and blood. He pulled the flask of soy from the pocket inside his waistcoat, taking a measured swallow to take the edge off his hunger.</p><p>"Sir? Are you alright?"</p><p>Vlad turned to find one of his security staff, who had probably been circling the perimeter a thousand times an hour.</p><p>"Fine. I just wanted a breather. Not like <em>that."</em></p><p>Jared smirked, cast a cursory glance around and bowed his head.</p><p>"As you were then Your Grandness."</p><p>Vlad waved him off, sucking in a few deep breaths. The air tasted damp, a tell tale sign it would rain later. Of course by then almost everyone in the hall would either be drunk, asleep or performing regrettable actions. Music leaked out of the open main door, and even if it hadn't Vlad would have been able to hear it through even thick stone walls. Closing his eyes, Vlad let the swell and scratch of harp and cello flow through him.</p><p>"Avoiding the partygoers are we Mr Dracula?"</p><p>He hadn't heard her approach. Unacceptable for one with senses like his; it was lucky Narcissa had no ulterior motives for Vlad than scaring him witless. He could have been ashed because he was enjoying the music.</p><p>"I needed some air."</p><p>"You don't need any air."</p><p>"Touché. However, I do have to breathe to talk. Rooms full of humans, particularly wizards, can affect even the most disciplined vampire. Add all the exertion of dancing, the flush of alcohol and the sheer amount of people all in one room... I needed some air."</p><p>"That isn't the only reason though, is it?"</p><p>Vlad shook his head.</p><p>"I'm not really wanted here. It's a pacifier because I'm Harry's best friend."</p><p>"Nonsense. You saved many lives Vladimir. My own included."</p><p>He shrugged non-committally.</p><p>"You didn't deserve to die. It's not a difficult equation."</p><p>Narcissa hummed, leaning against a patch of wall, seperated from Vlad by a climbing plant. A literally climbing plant; it oscillated as leaves moved up and down the vine-like stems.</p><p>"Surely being Harry Potter's best friend is a better reason than guilt for executing your husband."</p><p>He hadn't expected such a blunt statement from her. Especially with all her social graces otherwise intact - her shoulders were straight, polite smile fixed on a perfectly painted face. Her dress was practically fresh blood; deep red and the fabric ran like liquid as she moved.</p><p>"Harry tried to stop that but by the time he got anyone to let him try, Lucius was kissed. I'm sorry."</p><p>"I'm not. Lucius was a terrible man, but unfortunately my social standing is tied to his name. My name."</p><p>"You could go back to Black."</p><p>Narcissa hummed lightly, rolling her wand between her fingers.</p><p>"I would have to ask permission from the current Black patriarch."</p><p>"I know him rather well. In fact I could personally <em>guarantee</em> Harry would say yes."</p><p>A small sound of amusement escaped her.</p><p>"I suppose so. But there were three of us, I'm not sure I could be the only Black sister."</p><p>Vlad cocked his head, confused.</p><p>"You. Bellatrix. Andromeda. Yes?"</p><p>Narcissa nodded.</p><p>"Well... Andromeda is quite alive. She is always at Harry's house with young Teddy... who told you she was dead?"</p><p>If he thought her beautiful before, Vlad was thrown by how she looked brightened by uncontrollable hope.</p><p>"Him. Said he watched Bellatrix kill her."</p><p>"Well. He lied..." he wasn't sure it was his place to be involved, but Vlad found words spilled from him anyway "Would you like me to talk to her about you meeting up?"</p><p>"I wouldn't like to impose such a thing-"</p><p>"I see her twice a week. It wouldn't be a hardship."</p><p>"Well, I-"</p><p>"Vladdo!"</p><p>Harry yelled his name across the grass, blood reeking of stronger alcohol as his best friend neared.</p><p>"Harry, stop screaming would you? Sensitive hearing mate."</p><p>Harry giggled drunkenly, leaning against his redheaded ladyfriend.</p><p>"We're leaving. Wanted to see if you were coming back with us but I see you're busy so bye! Goodnight Mrs Malfoy!"</p><p>The two staggered off to the Apparition point, but thankfully he saw Harry using their home portkey - drunken apparating was a <strong>bad</strong> idea.</p><p>Narcissa watched them with a vaguely bemused expression on her face, then turned to Vlad.</p><p>"I've taken up quite enough of your time tonight."</p><p>"Not at all. It's refreshing not to have to talk the politics of crime now vs last millenia."</p><p>"Still, I should return to the party. Propriety and all."</p><p>Vlad didn't want her to leave.</p><p>"Where can you be contacted? If Andromeda wants to get in touch?"</p><p>Narcissa looked up at him; it was novel not to feel short when he was only five seven. Average to a human maybe, but vampires tended to be taller. Vlad felt stunted but Narcissa made him feel towering. She reached into her shimmery cloak wrapped around her against the cold, then pulled out a sheaf of parchment and self-inking quill. An address was scratched out when she leant against the wall.</p><p>"Here. I... appreciate the gesture immensely."</p><p>She handed him the address, then craned up on her toes to press satin-smooth and branding-iron-hot lips to his arctic cheek. She left him stood there, holding his cheek and the parchment and probably looking thunderstruck. Eventually he tucked the address next to his soy flask. His cheek still tingled with her warmth.</p><p>He apparated back to Harry's home a few minutes later after checking in with his security. Hearing playful giggles from the kitchen, Vlad headed straight for his bedroom before anything worse invaded his senses. The drapes in his room were heavy, thick material that let no light through. Just in case, the windows were protected by spells to stop any UV penetrating. Harry might have gone a little overboard.</p><p>Vlad stripped out of his heavy cape, hanging it on the wall hook. Next went tie and waistcoat, button up shirt with ridiculously ornate detailing. He kicked off his boots with a happy sigh, then changed his trousers for pyjama bottoms and got into <em>bed - </em>he hated coffins. Always had. Always would.</p><p>He woke early, the sun barely inching above the horizon. Vlad cast a sun protection charm anyway, feeling the magic settle across his skin before heading downstairs to the kitchen. It was a sight to behold, distinct scents telling him it was Ginny's shirt slung over the kettle and Harry's trousers on the breakfast counter. A quick wand swish moved <em>all</em> attire thoughtlessly discarded into a pile Vlad didn't have to deal with, allowing him to boil the kettle and dig out powdered soy from the cupboard.</p><p>Ginny, always an early riser regardless of the night before, ambled into the room with messy hair and a hickey blooming on her ivory neck. Objectively, Vlad knew Ginny had a nice neck, but he was chagrined by the following thought that said she wasn't a patch on Narcissa. She eyed him drinking a mug of soy in his pyjama bottoms, letting out a happy sound when she saw Vlad had pre-prepared hers and Harry's mugs so they only needed to boil the water for their coffee.</p><p>"Morning."</p><p>"Hangovers are evil. Harry isn't even alive yet."</p><p>Vlad craned his head, focused his hearing.</p><p>"I can hear his heartbeat."</p><p>"Semantics. He's buried so far in the blankets he may never move."</p><p>Chuckling, Vlad sipped more of his hot blood substitute while Ginny poured hangover relief potion into her coffee and stirred.</p><p>"Hey Ginny, you know when Andromeda is next due over?"</p><p>"Uh... I think it's actually today. Why? Does this have anything to do with you dancing with her little sister?"</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Vlad drummed his fingers on the side next to his wand. It sparked slightly.</p><p>"Narcissa thought she was dead. That's why she's never reached out since the war ended."</p><p>
  <em>"What?"</em>
</p><p>"Voldemort told her he had watched Bellatrix get rid of her. And it's not like anyone paid her mind while publicly mourning her husband and daughter and son-in-law."</p><p>Ginny frowned, swallowing her coffee in quick gulps to imbibe the relief for her headache faster.</p><p>"What the hell did you two talk about last night?"</p><p>"Nothing too in depth. Just that she hadn't asked Harry for permission to go back to Black because she didn't want to be the only Black sister left. The look on her face when I told her I see Andromeda regularly... nobody can fake that kind of hope. We knew she didn't want her part in the war, but she honestly thought there was nowhere else to go."</p><p>Being from a large family, Ginny shuddered at the idea of feeling <em>that </em>isolated, alone.</p><p>"Wow."</p><p>"Yeah. So you think I should bring this up with her?"</p><p>She nodded, red hair spilling around her shoulders messily.</p><p>"Absolutely. She doesn't say it but I know Andy must be so lonely sometimes. She talks about 'Cissa' sometimes, said she hated how Bella called her 'Cissy'. I think she misses her terribly but figured if Narcissa wanted her in her life, she would have reached out. She married a Muggleborn and her daughter married a werewolf, she thinks <em>Narcissa Malfoy</em> wants nothing to do with that."</p><p>Finishing the last of his mug, Vlad heard heavy footsteps thunder around upstairs. As he made himself tea, he made Harry's coffee and left a hangover potion vial and a glass of water next to it. Bleary eyed and wearing nothing but boxers and askew glasses, Harry stumbled into the kitchen with a low groan.</p><p>"Vlad's got you covered."</p><p>Ginny pointed her lover to the side, where Harry let out a happy sound and guzzled the water, then the potion in quick succession.</p><p>"Vlad, marry me."</p><p>"Not my type, I recommend Ginny in my stead."</p><p>"I think I'm still drunk."</p><p>Vlad sniffed, frowning.</p><p>"You both need showers, but yes. You still have alcohol in your blood."</p><p>Both humans cheeks coloured, especially when they looked around and realised they had left their clothes in a mess Vlad had to tidy slightly.</p><p>"Good idea."</p><p>"I'll make breakfast if you both go shower and remove your dirty washing from the kitchen floor."</p><p>"Bacon is in the fridge."</p><p>Harry downed his coffee and left with Ginny for the bathroom - <em>after </em>retrieving last nights clothes and taking them to the utility room next door. Vlad pulled the meat out of the fridge, knowing it would smell less appealing to him personally when it was cooked. Still, he had it fried in piles next to bread and toast, chewing his own sandwich when much cleaner and more alert people came downstairs.</p><p>"Andy and Teddy will be here in about half hour."</p><p>"I'll get dressed in a minute. Will you tell him what I was saying earlier?"</p><p>Ginny nodded, so Vlad left them to it while he showered and dressed himself. He felt much better back in a comfy cotton jumper and some jeans than he had in formal attire the night before. It helped that most of his 'muggle' clothes were in Harry's home, all his capes and collars and stiff stuffy suits back in Transylvania for work.</p><p>Taming ones hair when you had no reflection was no easy feat. Ginny didn't laugh at him so Vlad guessed he had done alright.</p><p>"Harry!"</p><p>Teddy announced his arrival loudly, throwing himself into his 'uncles' arms and turning his usually longer and turquoise hair short and black to match Harry's. Harry caught him and cuddled him tight, and Andromeda greeted them all happily, warmly. Vlad resolved to let them get settled before he jumped in with the whole Narcissa thing.</p><p>"Vad!"</p><p>Little Teddy hadn't mastered Vlad's name yet, but they saw each other plenty and he didn't mind Vlad's not-warm skin at all as he tugged himself up onto Vlad's lap and flashed his teeth - he was still cutting some of his milk teeth but could make thr front ones look like fangs.</p><p>He left for the kitchen when Harry and Teddy sat playing on the floor, wanting to steel his nerves before he approached her. However, Harry and Ginny were conspiring against him.</p><p>"They said you wanted to talk to me? If it's about eating me I'm going to have to say no."</p><p>She was smiling, but Vlad could sense her curiosity. He held his hands to show he was unthreatening.</p><p>"I'm still strictly on veggie vamps food. But... it's kind of about blood."</p><p>Andromeda sat down, looking concerned.</p><p>"What's wrong Vlad?"</p><p>"I spoke to your sister last night. At that Ministry event."</p><p>Her face clouded immediately.</p><p>"What does that have to do with me?"</p><p>Vlad drew in a breath.</p><p>"I know why she never reached out to you after the war."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>"Voldemort told her you were dead."</p><p>There was something strange about facing Andromeda sometimes; she was like a softer, prettier version of Bellatrix. <em>Literally</em> lighter - Bellatrix had black hair, black eyes, black soul. Andromeda had soft brown curls and eyes, and her soul was strong and bright despite many circumstances that could have darkened it. Vlad honestly found her inspiring.</p><p>"W-what?"</p><p>"I have honestly never seen anyone so hopeful when I told her you were alive. I uh, I said I'd pass on her contact information. She wants to reconnect but she didn't know she could. And I reckon she probably worries you won't want to."</p><p>He held out the parchment with Narcissa's information on, and it was almost snatched from his hands. There were traces of tears in her eyes.</p><p>"Is this for real?"</p><p>"If Harry <em>remembers</em> anything, I'm sure he can tell you he found us chatting in the gardens outside last night. She's an excellent dancer."</p><p>Vlad didn't intend for <strong>that</strong> to come out, and he cringed inwardly when Andromeda looked at him oddly.</p><p>"Vad!"</p><p>Saved by the toddler. He hurried out to the next room where Teddy wanted him to play. Joining Harry on the ground, he felt keen eyes on him when Andromeda came back out. Vlad managed to avoid being quizzed on his motives - mostly pure, he swore - the rest of the day, and he had to go that evening to get on with being Grand High Vampire.</p><p>Whether Andromeda wrote to Narcissa that day or that month, Vlad had no idea. Out of nowhere, there was a pack of extremely disenfranchised werewolves who were determined to wreak total havoc on the vampire world. Vlad barely had a minute to sleep for six weeks, negotiating and trying to stop rampant murders everywhere.</p><p><em>Finally </em>he got Romulus, the Alpha werewolf, to meet with him.</p><p>"The children of the moon grow wary of your kind."</p><p>"Which kind? I'm magical and vampiric. There is help available for werewolves in one of my worlds, and I bear them no ill will. Blood, my little brother is half wolf. I'm <em>not</em> your enemy."</p><p>Romulus was nearly seven foot tall and about as wide; every inch covered in thick muscles. Vlad felt like a toothpick next to him. There were three wolves behind him, the Alpha female - his mate -and their two sons Fenrir and Apollo. Vlad's Council members would barely last a minute between their teeth. Pure blood wolves at their age were no longer slaves to the moon cycle with their transformations.</p><p>"Hmm. I'm listening."</p><p>Vlad collapsed into his castle that night, blood from the signing of the peace treaty with werewolves still drying on his wrist and fingers. The smell of werewolf would take days and repeated washes to come out of his hair and clothes. He would start in a minute. First, he ought to check his correspondences.</p><p>Bill for soy blood. Important.</p><p>Advert for real blood. Set on fire.</p><p>Letter from Harry. Important.</p><p>Vlad flipped it over and tore it open.</p><p>"<em>Vladdo!</em></p><p>
  <em>I heard about the werewolf troubles. Figure that's why you've been too busy to see us. Don't forget it's Teddy's birthday soon, and he'll be heartbroken if you miss it!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Drop by when you can mate</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry."</em>
</p><p>Checking the calendar, Vlad sighed in relief. Teddy's birthday was in two days. He had time to rest and recuperate and still make it to the party. He penned a quick note back to tell Harry he would catch him up on everything when he saw him, and that he was absolutely going to be at the party.</p><p>Then he went to bed.</p><p>Vlad slept through to the next evening, showering and eating ravenously. A quick glance at the time had him deciding it was a polite enough time to apparate to Harry's house. Harry was in the kitchen cooking for one, and greeted Vlad happily.</p><p>"Hey! Gin is at a Harpies thing in Tokyo, she's gonna apparate back in the morning."</p><p>"Wow I'm really behind. Shouldn't you be there?"</p><p>"I offered but Gin insisted I stay back. In case it runs over, I can't miss Teddy's birthday."</p><p>Vlad nodded, helping himself to some of the leftover pizza in the fridge after reheating it with a spell. He was lazy like that. Harry sat opposite him and dug in to his dinner.</p><p>"So, it was the werewolves right?"</p><p>Vlad elaborated on the immense task of negotiating peace with the wolves, and apologised for essentially being an absent friend the last few weeks.</p><p>"You have an important job. I get it. I know you wouldn't <em>choose </em>to be gone for so long. Anyway, fancy a game of chess?"</p><p>And like that, Vlad was forgiven for his absence. They chatted lightly over chess until Harry was yawning.</p><p>"Ah bats, I was meant to set up for the party before I went to bed."</p><p>Chuckling at Harry picking up his vampiric language, Vlad waved off his concerns.</p><p>"I only got up two hours ago, I'll set up and then take a nap around dawn."</p><p>"Vlad, you're an angel. A dead one but still. Make sure you dress well, Gin got a digital camera so you can't avoid pictures this year."</p><p>Vlad scowled.</p><p>"Damnit. I'll pop home for a shirt or something when I'm done. Just give me the list and go get some sleep."</p><p>Harry handed over the party list in Ginny's handwriting, hugged Vlad and dragged himself off to bed with grateful sentiments in his direction. Vlad started with clearing the kitchen, placing the party foods already done under protective charms and leaving space for the as yet unprepared stuff. Teddy's cake had colour-change icing on, which Vlad envisioned him mimicking.</p><p>Decorations were a doddle for a vampire - Vlad could move fast enough that magic wouldn't even speed up the job. Everything was mostly shades of green and blue, which was less painful on Vlad's eyes than brighter colours like yellow and red. He read a book to pass the time, then apparated home for something other than his black jumper. Damn technological advancements.</p><p>He tried channelling Ingrid a little; she never failed to dress for the occasion. No matter what the occasion. His sister had four different 'ritual staking event' dresses. Knowing a photo could follow him around for all eternity made him mildly determined to not look ridiculous now Ginny had gotten around his species advantage of not being photographable.</p><p>Eventually he picked out his crimson shirt with shiny black buttons. It made his scrawny body look streamlined, broadened his shoulders slightly and didn't look too harsh on his pale complexion. Plus it matched his black boots with red detailing. They were his favourite boots but he dare not waste them on boring Council meetings. Comfortable despite their bulk.</p><p>Vlad apparated back with the clothing choices, slung the shirt and trousers over the back of his desk chair and, sensing imminent sunrise, he dropped off to sleep. Harry woke him about three hours later with a freshly made hot mug of soy blood, thanking him profusely for taking care of the set up.</p><p>"I'll open a vein to show my thanks if you like."</p><p>Vlad chuckled, taking the hot mug with thanks.</p><p>"I'd rather you check all the windows UV spells are intact before I come out."</p><p>Something was making Harry giddy and Vlad didn't know what it was. Probably cake for breakfast or seeing Teddy.</p><p>"So what did you get him?"</p><p>"A little cape, he kept asking for one like mine. And a plushie werewolf that howls if you put it in moonlight."</p><p>Harry laughed, sitting on the edge of Vlad's bed while he woke up a bit.</p><p>"Andy will love that. They'll be here in an hour, some people will be arriving in half hour or so."</p><p>"I can shower and dress in under a minute. Vampire speed rocks."</p><p>Vlad gulped the last of his mug, then shoved Harry lightly off his blankets so he could escape the bed. Harry eyed his selected outfit on the chair and grinned, nodding approvingly.</p><p>"Nice get up."</p><p>"I curse all digital cameras. Are you staying to watch me shower or...?"</p><p>Harry left with snickers, allowing Vlad to take a shower and dress in peace. Ginny kindly helped tame his hair, then took a few gratuitous pictures of Vlad scowling moodily at the camera.</p><p>"I'll burn that thing I swear."</p><p>"But then how will anyone appreciate how good I look?"</p><p>Ingrid had arrived, looking deadly and resplendent in her dark purple dress. She gave Vlad a once over.</p><p>"You don't look like you were dragged through a Slayers Guild either. Were you pre warned about the camera?"</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>Ingrid rolled her eyes, posed and then went to pour herself a glass of blood; Harry always kept a couple in for the occasional vampire visitors attached to being friends with Vladimir Dracula. Hermione, Draco and the Weasley twins were next to arrive, Mrs Weasley following with her husband and an outrageous amount of food to add to what was already there. Vlad got hugs; Ingrid got the twins rolling on the floor declaring undying love.</p><p>Nothing unusual at all so far. Yet Vlad couldn't help feeling there was something he didn't know.</p><p>As the clock hit ten thirty, the birthday boy and his grandmother popped in. Plus someone Vlad didn't expect.</p><p>"Narcissa! Glad you could make it."</p><p>"I couldn't miss his birthday now could I?"</p><p><em>Clearly,</em> Vlad was unaware of some development.</p><p>"Vad! I missed you!"</p><p>Teddy hugged his leg, but Vlad was still staring at Narcissa Malfoy in confusion. And more than a little desire; she had on a dress that could make full grown vampires weep. It was soft on her curves, black with a red iridescent shimmer in the light.</p><p>"I've missed something haven't I?"</p><p>Harry pointed down.</p><p>"We'll explain in a minute. For now pay attention to him."</p><p>Vlad leant down and picked up Teddy, who giggled happily.</p><p>"I think it's a special day for you, is it?"</p><p>"Birthday! I'm four!"</p><p>Teddy held up four little fingers, beaming.</p><p>"Wow, you're getting big! Why not go see everyone else? I can't hog you all day."</p><p>"Ok. I come see you later."</p><p>Teddy toddled off toward the twins, who both made a huge fuss of the little boy and he lapped up the attention. Andromeda and Narcissa followed him, though deep blue eyes met his before she left.</p><p>"So, what happened?"</p><p>"Your meddling paid off. Andy wrote to her sister the next day. I think Narcissa has spent more time at her sisters house than her own, and she's been here with Teddy a couple of times too."</p><p>"And nobody told me because..."</p><p>Everyone shrugged.</p><p>"Figured you would prefer to see it for yourself. Shall we go join the festivities?"</p><p>The day naturally revolved around one bubbly little four year old, who revelled in the attention and had a joyful laugh or smile for everyone. Vlad watched as Teddy took to Narcissa easily in shock. He knew Draco and his mother were on good terms, but they were visibly closer now than when he saw them together two months ago.</p><p>Vlad was in the kitchen helping clean up while Teddy napped and several adults were chatting with Butterbeer and Firewhiskey when she approached him.</p><p>"Vladimir."</p><p>"Vlad, please. Vladimir is formal."</p><p>She smiled, a slight head tilt sending white and black locks brushing across her shoulder.</p><p>"I owe you a debt of gratitude."</p><p>"Nonsense. I did very little. Almost nothing. Just... right place at the right time."</p><p>Narcissa shook her head.</p><p>"You don't give yourself enough credit."</p><p>Shrugging, he was glad his soy diet meant he couldn't blush.</p><p>"It was nothing. Really."</p><p>Warm fingers curled around his.</p><p>"I disagree. It <em>meant</em> everything."</p><p>Vlad wondered if he was imagining the quickening of her heartbeat as they looked at each other. He definitely <em>wasn't</em> imagining the footsteps that came closer, and they stepped apart somehow guiltily as Draco walked in holding a stack of dirty plates and cups. He looked between the two curiously. Vlad tried not to miss the feeling of warmth from her touch.</p><p>"Everything alright?"</p><p>"I was just thanking Vladim- Vlad for his assistance."</p><p>"Oh. Yeah. Good call Vlad. Anyway" Draco walked between them to the side and the significance was not lost on Vlad "everyone's doing 'never have I' like mature adults in there."</p><p>"You want to play never have I ever with your mom?"</p><p>Draco cringed.</p><p>"Oh. Right. Good point."</p><p>He threw them another glance before leaving them alone again. Vlad felt unreasonably nervous watching Draco go. He turned back toward Narcissa, intending to excuse himself as politely as possible.</p><p>It was the wrong (<em>right</em>) moment. Narcissa was aiming to kiss his cheek, and Vlad's turning meant she caught his lips. Neither pulled back. Vlad could scarcely believe the <em>heat </em>of her mouth, and when he added tentative pressure she yielded with a soft gasp. A hand wrapped around the back of his neck, his hand cupping her smooth cheek to tip her head just so.</p><p>She had to break away first, being the only one who needed to draw breath. Her soft pants were warm against his collar, making him squirm slightly. Vlad looked over her head to find they were being watched. They had been witnessed - by Teddy. Regretfully, Vlad stepped away from inviting body heat and crossed the kitchen to pick him up.</p><p>Teddy rubbed his tired eyes as Vlad lifted him, hair changing to black and white stripes.</p><p>"How was your nap?"</p><p>"Was ok. Hungry."</p><p>"You came to the right place. Mini sandwich or tiny sausage... thing?"</p><p>Teddy reached for a sandwich, peering at the two adults with big blue eyes over the food he was chewing.</p><p>"I shall go and inform Andy he's awake."</p><p>Narcissa made a hasty escape, leaving Vlad kicking himself for not stopping when he was <em>kissing his friends mother.</em></p><p>-YDHP-</p><p>
