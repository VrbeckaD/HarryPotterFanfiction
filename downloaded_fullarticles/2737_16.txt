    <p dir="ltr" align="left">She awoke in the early hours of the morning before the sun. Anya, the alpha being in her world, appeared at the foot of her bed. The familiar shadow figure, with what looks to have black flames surrounding it, slowly glided over towards her until it was right beside her pillow. It was then that Safrina knew that she would endure another sleepless night. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Her blue/grey eyes clamped shut as she waited for Anya to speak their piece quickly; as she does not want to be thrown back into the all-consuming darkness of The Pit again.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Tonight is the night little one. Tonight is the night that your destiny begins." hissed the shadow. Just as the child's eyes snapped open, the being disappeared, and an erratic knocking rasped on her bedroom door.  </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">With a shaky voice she called out, "Mama?" but to her dismay, the door opened to reveal five men dressed in long, dark brown robes with black hooded cloaks. She began to scream until her mother burst through the men with a pleading look on her face.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Safrina, there is no need to be scared, my child. These men are here to help you with the <em>special</em> friends in your head." her mother assured. But something was wrong. Worry touched her mother's eyes despite her otherwise calm demeanor. As her mother went to grab a cloak to cover her nightshift, her father strode through and roughly picked her up out of bed and practically threw her into the arms of the five men. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Instantly, Safrina started thrashing and screaming as the men dragged her down the spiraling staircase that held her bedchamber at the top. When she felt the backhand strike her face and heard the ringing in her ears, she realized that she was not going to break free. Slowly the ringing began to morph into laughing as she listened to the familiar voice of Anya booming in her ear. At the sound, she immediately went limp and let the men take her out to the carriage waiting for them outside. Right before they opened the carriage doors, she chanced one last glance towards her mother. Her father clamped his arms around her Mother's waist as she fought against him, spewing out apologies her daughter's way, through her sobs.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">The slow and painful realization slapped her in the face. For Safrina knew she was alone in the world. Her parents knew this was going to happen, and yet they simply let the strange men take their only child away, into the night.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> ~~~</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> The overwhelming empty feeling began to creep up on her in the cramped carriage. Knowing that this was the introduction of The God of Nothing, rather than attempting to evade it like she usually did, she let it consume her, thrusting her entirely into The Pit.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Inside The Pit, she felt nothing, heard nothing, saw nothing, and lost all concept of time and self. The Pit was a chasm created by The God of Nothing, designed originally as a means for the Gods to discipline and torture her. After the short six years of her life, however, and after the betrayal of her parents, she's embraced it. Now for the first time, she's using it to her advantage. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> ~~~</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> Safrina awakens from The Pit only to discover that she is in perhaps, an even crueler one. One in which fills up her lungs and suffocates her. One in which she is sweating profusely. Sweating<em>? No. It's all-consuming. It's water! She is surrounded by water! Drowning! </em>Then, as quickly as it came Its gone. She's finally able to rid her lungs of the water through an aggressive coughing fit. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> ~~~</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> Deep blue eyes watch as the dark red haired child's body aggressively convulsing with the intense coughing fit. Fortunately, the water seemed to work to bring the young child out of her stupor. According to the men that retrieved her, she is six years of age, the daughter of Henry and Selene of house Rockwood, and for some unknown reason, was arranged to be taken away by the Rockwood's themselves. Perplexed, the man absentmindedly ran his fingers through his short and curly dark locks atop his head.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Marcus Dumbledore, headmaster of the Orphanage for the Wizards and Witches of the Realm, set to interrogate the child in front of the council, due to the high born status and mysterious circumstances of her case.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Safrina of house Rockwood," Dumbledore drawled in a regal voice, "State your motives of your presence here today." His long, stark black hair and matching beard intimidated the child.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">It took everything in his power for the deep blue-eyed man not to clench his hands and roll his eyes in annoyance with the headmaster for the poor girl was just a child. Of course, she is unknowing of her parent's actions.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"It would seem, my parents, my lord have abandoned me," Safrina stated in a soft voice, maintaining eye contact with the headmaster the entire time. The man's blue eyes snapped to the girl. Taken aback by the bold six years old's statement, he starts assessing the girl in a new light.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"And what brought you to this conclusion child?" scoffed Marcus in a demeaning tone. Transfixed by the child, the man with blue eyes continued his never-ending gaze upon the child. Typically, he was much more composed during council meetings, but his curiosity bested him, and he found himself hypnotized by the child.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"The Gods my lord." muttered the child with a touch of annoyance in her voice. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Puzzled, Marcus replied, "Which Gods child?"</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Anya, the God of Darkness, Valladon, the God of Anger, and the nameless God of Nothing of course."</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Do these Gods talk to you often Safrina?" interjected the man with his somehow even darker blue eyes.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Exander." Dumbledore warned in a disproving tone, "You will do well not to speak out of turn."</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Pardon my lord, but it would seem that this child may be in need of my <em>expertise,"  </em>replied Exander, with unwavering blue eyes still fixated on Safrina.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"Very well, Lord Exander Sky." with that, Dumbledore nodded towards the five men, communicating without words to take Safrina away, into a single room under Exander's authority.  </p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> ~~~</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> Still disoriented from the brutal water splashing earlier, the older men surrounding the table before her seemed to go from utter disinterest to bewilderment. All except one. The man looked a bit younger than the rest. His hair was dark with no trace of graying in it, and his sharp features did not seem as worn out around their edges as his colleges did. The eyes, stark blue as the ocean in the night, were hard to miss as he downright stared at her the entire time. For whatever reason, the council deemed <em>him</em> to be the best caregiver for her. A sentiment that terrified her almost as much as the Gods. Almost. Suddenly, Anya's voice that was coaching her through the meeting changed, and Valladon, The God of Anger, took over.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">A flash of red took over her eyes, and the council seemed to notice the change. The grown men seemed to look slightly fearful for a moment until they composed themselves. Safrina took this opportunity to bring Valladon's words to light as she began spewing insults and profanities at the <em>men.</em> Once her eyes fell on Lord Sky on the far left of the table, she noticed he was not scared nor fearful of her. He donned a curiously knowing smirk on his face that stopped her in her tracks, and left her utterly terrified. The men once again were able to carry the puzzling child away at last. She was taken to her new dwellings without incident. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> ~~~</p><p dir="ltr" align="left"> Her new solitary room was extremely small compared to most, and extremely modest in comparison to what she once called her bedchambers. The long room was long and narrow and only had one small window of light. Along the right wall was a simple wooden desk and chair. Along the left, was a trunk. At the very back wall with the window, was a lumpy mattress with the headboard situated underneath it. The room indeed was of modest means. With a sigh, she stalked over to her bed, only to discover it had no pillow and the thinnest blanket she had ever seen. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Interrupting her thoughts, she turned to the door to see a small slot open and stale bread thrown inside. Remembering the emptiness of her stomach, she bounds over to the food. With great difficulty, she manages to consume a few measly bites until her throat dries up from the lack of moisture, and her baby teeth become to sore to attempt to snag another bit of the rock-hard bread.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Frustrated, hungry, cold, and hurt, she throws the bread at the door and collapses to the ground in the middle of the room. The complex emotions are taxing on the child and sobs course through her small frame. She begs for the comforting darkness of The Pit. The emptiness never comes, however, and she is left with the overwhelming mix of emotions with no end in sight. That's when she feels the arms of a stranger envelop her. Momentarily thrown off by the unexpected contact, she freezes as she thinks its a ghost.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">"There there, my sweet child. I am not going to hurt you." sang Exander. Safrina didn't hear him come in. Anya was quick to berate her for not listening to her surroundings. Afraid of both Exander and her voices, she becomes mute with fear and could only break out of his embrace and look at him with wide eyes. Sensing her apprehension, he attempts another approach, "I imagine your quite hungry?" This peaks Safrina's interest as her eyes light up with the prospect of a decent meal. Satisfied with her response, Lord Sky snaps his fingers, and a servant with a tray of meat and potatoes walks in with a goblet of water, and places them on the wooden table. No sooner than the meal is set down, Safrina runs to the table and in a very unladylike way, scarfs down the meal. With a chuckle, Lord Sky leaves the room.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">By the time night falls, exhaustion takes over, and Safrina welcomes the nightmares in store for her tonight.</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">
