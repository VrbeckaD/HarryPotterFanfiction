    <p>It is an old tradition in Wizarding World to meet your soulmate when you reach seventeen......</p>
<p>Its 11:59 pm, still January 8 if you mind and Severus cannot sleep though she tried her best to fall asleep. Many things are running on her mind and one of it is it's only one minute to go and she will be trapped on the "soulmate" thingy that many girls her age impatiently waits. </p>
<p>Severus look at her left side and she envy how chill Avery while sleeping. No one knows that Severus is a girl even Lily, her ex best friend.</p>
<p>Severus looks at the clock, its 12 o'clock then suddenly her right arm ache as it leave a mark that Severus knows so much...</p>
<p>"Bloody hell..."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It is said that in your seventeenth birthday, your soulmate's patronus will etched to your skin as a reminder that you belong to each other.</p>
<p>Severus can't eat even though she wants so badly, something from her system is telling her not to eat something, even the cheese bread in front of her that looks so appetizing.</p>
<p>Severus look at other house tables, wondering if her soulmate is unfortunately here.</p>
<p>Is he someone older? Is that the reason why she can't find him?</p>
<p>Or maybe... He is months younger than her soulmate.</p>
<p>No....</p>
<p>Yes, Severus still have no idea who the hell her soulmate is. But she knows what the mark is. Girls above her years, last year happily broadcast to the whole slytherins that they finally receive their mark.</p>
<p>How sickening.</p>
<p>'How dare you fate to tell me what I will do to my life!'</p>
<p>'I will do whatever I want.'</p>
<p>"Hey! Eat something mate." Someone on her right said then suddenly she heard a large bang.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem is not everyone can produce a patronus, leave alone the dunderhead one. Sounds like you can escape right? Actually, no. Love will always find you, wherever you like it or not.</p>
<p>And that's the reason why Severus hates love to the moon and back.</p>
<p>Love is not for anyone, and she already knows it. </p>
<p>No one needs to remind her...</p>
<p>As long as Severus's memory is not failing her, she knows that her Slytherin housemates are not all redhead. So what the hell is happening?</p>
<p>"Look at those slimy snakes! Red looks better on them, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Severus touch her hair, her hair stay black! What the hell is going on?</p>
<p>Why is she the only one who doesn't have an annoyingly bright red hair?</p>
<p>The food! Those arrogant gits know that Slytherin values breakfast...</p>
<p>"Oh my god! Too many red!" One Slytherin, Severus do not remember what is his name is, but she knows that he is a first year run so fast.</p>
<p>'Maybe he hates red. I really understand him.'</p>
<p>While her roommate Avery, look at her and grab her short and err greasy hair so hard then he yell at her.</p>
<p>"Do you know what's going on Snape? Why your hair is still bloody black!" </p>
<p>Severus don't know what to say. She can't say that she just know that her system is telling her that do not eat, Slytherin will think that she help those arrogant Gryffindor. Hah! Never in her life she will allow that to happen.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Maybe it's my lucky day, you know?"</p>
<p>Severus sigh and she looks at her Slytherin mates, theyâ€”not including her possess a bright red hair, a hue that even a three years old toddler know that no one in this earth can have a hair like this.</p>
<p>Severus leave the great hall with heavy heart. This is too much for today.</p>
<p>First, she receive her mark.</p>
<p>Second, Potter pranks everyone in Slytherin.</p>
<p>Third, Slytherin gave her deadly glare.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is her birthday.</p>
<p>No one knows of Severus birthday, except Lily of course. Last year, she gave a bracelet that Severus really adores, but James nicked it from her.</p>
<p>If only I know that...that bracelet is the last present that I will receive from Lily...</p>
<p>"I just want an ordinary and peaceful day. Why can't they give that to me? Is that too much for a birthday gift?" Severus murmur as she walks alone and miserable.</p>
<p>"This is too much..." She whispered, while on the other side, her soulmate feel something that he can't understand.</p>
<p>"Oi mate! What's going on?" Sirius ask James as he look at his happy suddenly into turned gloomy mate.</p>
<p>"I don't know mate, It's just I feel something different...my heart feels so heavy."</p>
<p>"What's it? Are you okay?" Remus interrupt his two mates and tap James's back while Peter look at James curiously.</p>
<p>"I don't know, but doesn't it matter." James sigh and he looks at his friends.</p>
<p>"Let's go back to eat."</p>
<p>'I feel guilty from the prank that I pull from the Slytherins and I don't know the reason why.'</p>
