    <p>"Look Harry, Veela!"</p><p> </p><p>Harry turned to look where Hermione was pointing. Down on the pitch were maybe a dozen or so of the most beautiful women he'd ever seen, dancing around in flowing, erotic patterns.</p><p> </p><p>"Veela"? Harry asked.</p><p> </p><p>"They're a kind of magical creature that derive from Europe. I guess they must be Bulgaria's cheerleaders".</p><p> </p><p>"They definitely look better than the Leprechauns", muttered Harry, his lips turning up in a smirk.</p><p> </p><p>"Harry!" Hermione exclaimed, swatting him on the shoulder with a rolled up piece of paper.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked around at the other people in the booth. All the Weasley men seemed to be in some sort of trance, drooling and staring at the Veela women.</p><p> </p><p>"Umm, Hermione. What's up with them"?</p><p> </p><p>"It must be the Veela allure. Veela give off a sort of erotic aura that draws in week willed men. Similar to a Sirens song". </p><p> </p><p>"Are they going to be alright"? Harry asked as he lightly pushed Ron's shoulder, seeing him rock slightly to the side before coming back.</p><p> </p><p>"After a while. Once the Veela leave they should be back to normal".</p><p> </p><p>As the game went on, Harry couldn't help but keep watching the Veela. Something about the way they moved seemed to draw him in. It was almost unnatural the way they swayed back and forth, moving around each other in circular patterns.</p><p> </p><p>Just as it was nearing the first break point. the Veela all stopped their movements. As one, they stood in a circle, and lifted their arms upwards, their mouths moving in what looked to be a chant.</p><p> </p><p>As the whistle blew, the Veela all opened their mouths as wide as possible, silvery gold wisps of light coming out of them, coalescing in the middle of their circle, then shot upwards in a beam of light, spreading outwards as it moved up, encasing the entire stadium.</p><p> </p><p>Harry heard Hermione loudly moan next to him. Before he could look over to see what was wrong, a heavy pressure fell over him, knocking him unconscious.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>'Harry'</p><p> </p><p>'Harry'</p><p> </p><p>'Wake up Harry'</p><p> </p><p>'Harry!'</p><p> </p><p>Harry jerked awake, sitting up in what appeared to be a large tent.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh Harry! I'm so glad you're okay".</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked up in time to see Hermione dive towards him, wrapping him up in a tight hug.</p><p> </p><p>"What happened"?</p><p> </p><p>"The Veela. They performed some sort of ritual".</p><p> </p><p>"What ritual"?</p><p> </p><p>"That's what I want to know".</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked over to a partitioned area of the tent. A tall red headed woman wearing a monocle in one eye was walking toward him.</p><p> </p><p>"You're Susan's aunt", said Harry, slightly surprised.</p><p> </p><p>"That's right Mr Potter. What can you tell me about what happened"?</p><p> </p><p>"Well, the Veela were dancing around on the pitch, I thought it was some sort of cheerleader stuff. But just as the break was about to be called, they formed a circle and started chanting. Some kind of light came out of their mouths and shot up in the air. I heard 'Mione moan next to me when the light hit us, but I passed out before I could see if she was alright". Harry looked to Hermione, taking her hand in his.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you Mr Potter. I'll leave you for the moment to get better".</p><p> </p><p>"Madam Bones. Was anyone hurt"?</p><p> </p><p>"No Mr Potter. Only a select few people were knocked unconscious. Everyone else seems to have been put in a trance that made them leave the stadium".</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, okay. Do you know what the Veela were trying to do"?</p><p> </p><p>"That's what I'm about to find out".</p><p> </p><p>As Madam Bones left the tent, a rustling from the tent partition she'd been in before caught Harry and Hermione's attention. Suddenly a head popped round the corner.</p><p> </p><p>"Susan"? Harry asked, surprised.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey Harry, auntie gone"?</p><p> </p><p>"Umm, yeah"?</p><p> </p><p>Susan sighed before stepping round the partition, coming to stand next to Harry's bed.</p><p> </p><p>"I guess you were knocked out as well"? Said Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, all three of us".</p><p> </p><p>"Do you know if anyone else was"? Asked Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>"Auntie mentioned that one of her Aurors was. Something Tonks I think".</p><p> </p><p>"Something Tonks? I like the sound of that, has a nice ring to it".</p><p> </p><p>The three teenagers turned to see a young woman with bright pink hair walk into the tent.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, hello. I'm guessing you're the Auror Susan was just telling us about"? Said Hermione, offering her hand for the older witch to shake.</p><p> </p><p>"That's right. You kids okay"? Tonks asked, getting head nods as conformation.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>"You've got to be kidding", said Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>"Unfortunately I'm not Ms Granger".</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked around the table he was sat at, taking in the reactions from the other people present. It was him, Hermione, Mr Weasley (who was there as an adult for Harry and Hermione), Susan, Tonks, a girl he recognised as Daphne Greengrass who was in his year at Hogwarts, a woman who her guessed was her mum, a little blonde haired girl he thought he'd seen a few times around Hogwarts, a tall scraggly haired man he guessed was the girl's dad, Madam Bones, and finally a tall silvery haired woman who stood next to Madam Bones. </p><p> </p><p>A few minutes earlier, Madam Bones had come back to the tent and lead Harry, Hermione, Susan, and Tonks to the tent they were sat in now. Like the Weasley's tent, it was much bigger on the inside, but where the Weasley's one still felt like a tent, this one felt as if they were in a palace. Madam Bones had lead them to the large table, everyone else already being there. She had then introduced them all to the silvery haired woman called Apolline Delacour, who was the woman who owned the tent. </p><p> </p><p>Apolline had told them all that she was a Veela, who had come here with her two daughters to watch the Quiditch match. She'd then gone on to explain what she believed the ritual that the other Veelas had done. </p><p> </p><p>"So", started Daphne's mum. "You're telling me, that my daughter, and all these other girls, have been turned into Veela"?</p><p> </p><p>Harry didn't find it hard to believe. Just looking at the girls around him, he could tell that they had been changed. Starting with Hermione, a few hours ago she'd been a small, slim thing with small breasts, large front teeth, and huge bushy hair. Now she was a head taller, had filled out alot in all the right areas, her front teeth seemed to have shrunk to a normal size, and her hair now flowed down and around her shoulders in waves.</p><p> </p><p>The same could be said for Susan. Before, she had been rather short, with curves that could be seen, but were sadly covered by quite a bit of pudge. Now, though she was still quite short, the pudge had practically disappeared, leaving her with a pair of absolutely huge breasts, big round hips, and the largest and softest looking arse Harry thought he'd ever seen.</p><p> </p><p>The same with Daphne, and Luna. What he remembered seeing them as back at Hogwarts was a far cry from how they looked now. Though he hadn't ever met Tonks before, he could guess that she had been far from the stacked goddess that she was now.</p><p> </p><p>"Can I ask a question"?</p><p> </p><p>Everyone turned to Hermione as she raised her hand.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course Ms Granger", replied Apolline.</p><p> </p><p>"Why is Harry here? I mean, only women can be Veela, so what happened to him"?</p><p> </p><p>Everyone turned to Harry, as he looked around shocked.</p><p> </p><p>"What do you mean"? Asked Harry, confused.</p><p> </p><p>"Haven't you seen yourself Harry"? Asked Luna.</p><p> </p><p>Madam Bones pulled out her wand and waved it in front of Harry, conjuring a mirror.</p><p> </p><p>Harry's eyes widened to the size of dinner plates as he stood up and looked at himself in the mirror. Where before had been a small, skinny little boy. Now stood a 5ft 10 Adonis, with rippling muscles, and what Harry thought was a rather large bulge in his trousers. </p><p> </p><p> </p>
