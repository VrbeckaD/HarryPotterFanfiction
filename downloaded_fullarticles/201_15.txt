    <p>Harry had expected several things when Andromeda had called him to pick Teddy up from school. She had said that it was an emergency and she was at the healer’s already and couldn’t get there in time. Harry had rushed over to the magical primary school expecting the worst. Had Teddy fallen, did he hit his head, was there a magical accident? He only hoped that his godson wasn’t hurt.<br/>	Stepping into Teddy’s classroom, he did not expect to see Teddy sitting in Draco Malfoy’s lap crying. Malfoy was talking softly and seemed to be trying to get Teddy’s hands out of his hair. <br/>	A slight widening of the eyes was the only indication that Malfoy was surprised to see Harry. “Is he alright?” Harry asked, crossing the classroom quickly. <br/>	Malfoy grinned at Teddy. “He’s not hurt,” he said softly as he continued to untangle Teddy’s chubby little fingers from his currently dark blue hair. “He had an accident with some paste and now his fingers are glued into his hair. He tried changing the length of it and it only made it worse, but we are getting it. A bit slowly, but it’s coming along.” <br/>	“I am too hurt,” Teddy pouted. “This stuff pulls my hair and it don’t work to make it slick like Amelia said it would.” <br/>	“I’m sure that it does hurt, Teddy,” Harry smiled fondly at the disgruntled little boy. Looking at Malfoy, he asked, “Is there a solvent or something to help you along there?”<br/>	“I put some on it already, but I don’t want to risk it getting in his eyes,” Malfoy sighed. “Might as well have a seat, Potter. This is going to take awhile.”<br/>	Harry pulled a very small chair out and sat carefully. When Malfoy chuckled quietly, he rolled his eyes at him. “Yes, hilarious,” he said dryly. “So, how long have you worked here?”<br/>“I started last year as an assistant. When I finished my courses over the summer, they offered me a position,” Malfoy rolled his neck, trying to loosen his shoulders. “I have you to thank for it, you know?”<br/>“Me,” Harry looked confused. “What did I have to do with it? It’s not like I helped you pass your courses.”<br/>Malfoy rolled his eyes. “When you spoke for me at the trials. They released the public records to the papers and you speaking for me opened a lot of doors.”<br/>Harry’s cheeks flamed a bit. He didn’t like being reminded that people thought so much of his opinion, but if it had helped someone then he would accept it. “I only told the truth,” he muttered.<br/>“Yes,” Malfoy nodded in agreement. “But it’s a truth that no one would have believed if not for you.”<br/>“So why teaching?” Harry asked, trying to change the subject. “I always thought you’d go into potions or something similar.”<br/>Teddy jumped up suddenly as one hand was freed. “I have to go to the bathroom,” he called over his shoulder as he ran to the back of the classroom. The door slammed shut behind him. Both men chuckled at the boy’s antics.<br/>Malfoy stood to stretch, his tall frame towering over Harry. He held a hand out to Harry, “I know those chairs are not comfortable for adults. Harry took his hand and let himself be pulled upright. Malfoy spoke again as he pulled a chair from behind his desk, “I want to positively impact children. I feel like if I might have had a better male role model growing up, I might have made better choices.”<br/>Harry stretched a bit before sitting in the offered chair, “That’s a really good reason, Malfoy.” He heard the door click shut and Teddy came towards them, tugging the side of his trousers up.<br/>“I need help, Harry,” he grumbled. He always got a little frustrated when he had to ask for help. He showed Harry the undone button on his trousers. With one hand still stuck in his hair, he couldn’t get the button done up. Harry helped him quickly before he went back over to Malfoy to finish his hair. <br/>“So, what are you doing with your time, Potter?” Malfoy asked. He appeared to be genuinely interested. <br/>“Nothing at the moment,” Harry shrugged. “I left the auror academy. I can’t be their poster boy and I’m tired of the fighting. McGonagall offered me a teaching position, but I haven’t decided yet.” <br/>“Defense Against the Dark Arts?” Malfoy asked as he continued to patiently pry Teddy’s fingers free.<br/>Harry chuckled softly, “How’d you guess?” He grinned at Malfoy when he looked up at him.<br/>“Just a hunch,” he laughed. “So, are you going to take it? I heard rumors that you were a pretty good teacher.” <br/>“I haven’t decided yet. If I do, it’ll limit the amount of time I get to spend with Teddy.” Harry watched as Teddy tried not to fidget too much. “Hermione wants me to take it, but I think that’s mostly because she’s not used to going so long without seeing me.”<br/>“She teaches Arithmancy at Hogwarts, if I remember correctly?” Draco asked. He let out a pleased sigh as Teddy’s other hand came free. Teddy jumped up and down, running to Harry he climbed in his lap to hug him. <br/>“I’m hungry,” Teddy proclaimed. Looking at his watch, Harry saw that it was well after time for them to have been gone. It was fast approaching dinner and Malfoy hadn’t seemed to be bothered by how long it took to free Teddy’s hands.<br/>“We’ll get you some dinner then, yea?” Harry said to Teddy. He looked up at Malfoy, who had stood to stretch again. “Do you wanna join us? It’s the least I can do after you’ve stayed late to help him.”<br/>Malfoy looked surprised at the invitation. “I wouldn’t want to put you out,” he said more to the floor than to Harry. <br/>“You’re not putting me out if I’m the one that offered,” Harry stood with Teddy, sliding him around to his hip. “I insist. And I’m a pretty good cook if I do say so myself.”<br/>Malfoy smiled brightly at Harry and his breath caught in his chest. “Well, if you are insisting, I suppose that I can be benevolent and grace you with my presence a little while longer, Potter.”<br/>“It’s Harry. Just call me Harry,”he said as he turned towards the door of the classroom. He looked over his shoulder to see if Malfoy was following him. <br/>“Alright then, Harry,” Malfoy spoke as he grabbed Teddy’s jacket. “What’s on the menu?”</p>
