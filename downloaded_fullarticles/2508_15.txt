Wilfully pissing his life away.</p><p>So what does that make me? ‘Mione would say it's my <em> ‘saving people' </em>complex rearing its moronic head again.</p><p>More likely it's my toxic <em> ‘unable to extricate my life from his’ </em> complex. Snarled together for-fucking-ever.</p><p> -</p><p>The coin alerted me and I Apparated straight to the back alley.</p><p>His pupils were blown and jaw slack. A dark runnel of blood issued from one nostril. Illegal potions. His arse in ripped skinny jeans <em> should </em> be illegal. But none of that mattered.</p><p>He was outnumbered.</p><p>Tripping off his head and wandless.</p><p>Yes, he'd ripped those guys off. Like I said, he's an arsehole.</p><p>But they would’ve killed him.</p><p>He needed <em> me </em>. If any other Auror had shown up, he’d be in Azkaban so fast—</p><p> -</p><p>This time was a first. He let me hold him as he came down; sweating and shivering and sobbing as the drugs left his body. Gingerly, I stroked his limp hair. He tried to kiss me; clumsy, clawing. He told me he hates me.</p><p>I reset his Galleon and went home.</p><p> -</p><p>I always get to the scene first.</p><p>What is it that compels me to save him? It’s not pity.</p><p>First off: He's a prick.</p><p>After that, he's everything.</p></div>
