    <p>Throughout Ron Weasley's entire life, he heard whispers. They were not loud enough to understand but they were loud enough to be heard.</p><p>When he was younger he didn't really think it was a big deal. Voices we're one thing, but it was whispers! How bad could that possibly be?</p><p>I mean, he had some odd beliefs and had a hard time with focusing but he wasn't crazy. All kids are like that. Plus being a wizard probably had something to do with it.</p><p>Ron just ignored them.  The whispers were not affecting his life much and he quite frankly, found it silly to tell his family. They would not be interested in such a dumb thing. Mum would probably tell him he was being ridiculous, Dad would tell him it wasn't anything bad, Percy would roll his eyes, and God forbid if the twins knew about it. It was whispers. Ron just assumed it would pass when he entered Hogwarts but he was wrong. </p><p>The whispers sometimes said a occasionally sentence or a word after the troll incident, but it was his guilt, he convinced himself. Nothing more. He was not crazy. Just felt guilty.</p><p>Than after the fight with the Basilisk, the whispers we're louder and started becoming sentences. He convinced himself that it was worry over his sister. He entertained the theory that he was a parselmouth like Harry, but he could not understand snakes when he was around them. It was just worry over Ginny, he told himself. They were quite close when they were younger. It would be only natural that he was worried.  He was not crazy. Just worried.</p><p>Than it was third year. This is when he started to see things that nobody else saw.</p>
