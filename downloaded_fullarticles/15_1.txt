  <b>Excerpts from <em>Unearthing Our Spiritual Past: Historical Research Into Pre-Christian Wizarding Beliefs </em>by Millicent Bulstrode (2007).</b>
</p><p>The Old Religion, or the “old ways” as fervent believers are wont to whisper breathy tones, is really an amalgamation of beliefs and traditions with a history as old and as complicated as the British Isles themselves. Born in Ancient Greece and spread through conquest and migration, the Old Religion practiced in the United Kingdom and Ireland borrows heavily from Roman and Hellenistic traditions and Celtic folklore (“Introduction”, p. 1).</p><p align="justify">Unlike the organized and standardized doctrines that Muggles practice, there is no central dogma or scripture to help indoctrinate new believers into the Old Religion. Most initiates are simply born into the faith and taught by their elder members of their practicing families. For those few who are proselytized or attempt to convert without guidance, little to no texts exist as a resource: most traditions and rituals are preserved through family lore and oral history. Though some modern texts have previously claimed to expose the secrets of the Old Religion, these are either scandalously altered for the sake of furthering certain political bents [the author would like to note that more than a few 'seminal' texts were published on the eve of crucial Wizengamot votes] or utilized as a poorly-disguised vessel for slanderous gossip [see Rita Skeeter’s 1987 exposé <em>Bathing in the Moonlight and Other Naughty Noble Stories</em>]. (“Faith Without Guidelines”, p. 19).</p><p align="justify">Those in possession of ancient manuscripts have zealously guarded them for centuries, not only because of their priceless nature, but also due to the memory of thousands of texts lost to the bonfires of the witch hunts. For the first time in modern history, the wards on these Most Ancient and Noble family libraries have been metaphorically lifted. For the purpose of this research, sponsored by <em>L’École magique des sciences sociales de Paris</em>, the author was granted access to multiple previously-unseen manuscripts dating back to the Roman conquest. In conjunction with interviewing longtime practitioners, this research aims to demystify the beliefs and practices of the Old Religion in order to lend a better understanding to the spiritual fundamentals of wizarding society (“Faith Without Guidelines”, p. 21).</p><p> </p>

  <b>Tonks Residence, Oxfordshire</b>
</p><p>
  <b><em>Beltane,</em> May 1, 1999</b>
</p><p>The steady warmth emanating from Andromeda's crackling fireplace was a far cry from the raging Beltane bonfires of her youth.</p><p>Fascinated by the cheerful dance of flickering flames, little Teddy rapidly toddled over to the sooty hearth as fast as his chubby legs could take him—only to be abruptly stopped by the magical barrier his grandmother had the foresight to put in place. Plopping unto his bottom, the little boy scrunched his button nose in surprise. In the blink of an eye, his nut-brown curls brightened to an unnatural shade of orange, undulating vertically atop his head.</p><p>"Oh, Teddy darling," sighed Andromeda Tonks, but she was too busy levitating large serving dishes to pick the boy up. "Harry, could you please strap him into the high chair?"</p><p>Teddy gurgled and tugged at luminescent hair, delighted by the turn of events.</p><p>Andromeda's maternal heart constricted at the sound. Despite all that had elapsed over the past few years, her grandson was a <em>happy</em> baby, so achingly reminiscent of her Dora as an infant. Just a year old, Teddy’s cheeky laugh and dimpled smile were already his most prominent Tonks features.</p><p>"I've never even heard of Beltane before, Mrs Tonks," revealed Harry, scooping up his impish godson with capable arms and settling Teddy on his hip. "Even 'Mione couldn't tell me much about it."</p><p>This change of perspective quite suited Teddy, who immediately began pulling at the buttons on Harry's corduroy jacket. Though Andromeda eyed the worn outer garment critically, she bit her tongue.</p><p>In the year following the Battle at Hogwarts, she'd grown fond of the Potter boy. She even came to regard him as something like a nephew; they were, after all, technically related by way of his paternal grandmother. Out of respect for Harry, Andromeda would never harangue the unassuming boy into buying some decent new clothes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Oh, but sometimes she <em>desperately </em>wanted to—especially when he insisted on wearing oversized hand-me-down Muggle clothing. It wasn’t as if Harry could not afford anything nicer.</p><p>Born into a societal class clinging on to their last shreds of old grandeur, Andromeda had grown up hearing about the fortune tucked away inside the Potter vaults. The estate had only doubled in size with the tidy sum Charlus Potter inherited from his Uncle Fleamont. Not that any decent pure-blood witch would sully their bloodline for ghastly merchant money, but envious whispers acknowledged it was a substantial amount of galleons—potentially enough to rival the Malfoy fortune.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Certainly, Andromeda thought, Harry’s inheritance should have been enough for him to purchase clothing without any previous owners. Then and there, she decided to gift him a dragon-hide jacket for his upcoming birthday. Circe knows Sirius would have approved.</p><p>"Well, you've always been at Hogwarts for it," replied Andromeda, putting the finishing touches on a table piled with enough food to put even Molly Weasley to shame. It was an extravagance for her usually middle-class budget, but Andromeda knew she would send Harry away with enough leftovers to feed him and the Granger girl for at least two weeks.</p><p>"But Dumbledore never celebrated it at Hogwarts—"</p><p>"Headmaster Dumbledore, may he rest in peace, was never quite keen on our old ways," interrupted Andromeda, quick to nip any Dumbledore talk in the bud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Although she’d never faltered in her allegiance to her daughter and, by extension, the Order of the Phoenix, Andromeda’s upbringing made her wary of the hero-worship surrounding the late headmaster. Brilliant wizard the man had been, but always so distrustful of any deep-rooted traditions that would undermine his own vision for a progressive wizarding society.</p><p>"Originally, we shared some of these beliefs with Muggles," she explained gently, remembering when it had been Dora on the receiving end of the tale. "But then time passed, and the world changed, and eventually most wizarding families adopted newer Muggle customs. By the time I was a little girl, the only ones to practice the old rites were the pure-bloods."</p><p>Harry eyed the fireplace warily, a slight frown pulling at his mouth. "So is Beltane… Dark?"</p><p>Andromeda sighed, slightly exasperated. There was not much to recommend her upbringing, since the Blacks were known for their less-than-stellar parenting. However, Andromeda could admit that her family had been much more comprehensive on teaching the nature of Magic. Certainly far more instructive than any professor ever hired by Albus Dumbledore—barring her own son-in-law, of course.</p><p>"Of course not," Andromeda explained, careful to avoid condescension. "Beltane goes back to the days of primitive Magic, before our kind developed ways to use it for harm. It’s meant to be a happy time, for celebrating life and youth and new beginnings."</p><p>With a flick of her wand, a floral arrangement of primrose blooms, rowan berries, and hawthorn branches daintily settled itself above the doorway. "It isn’t much, but this will have to do," she declared, speaking more to herself than her guest.</p><p>Harry looked thoughtful. "Did you celebrate every year with your family? With Tonks and, er, Mr Tonks?"</p><p>"Well, we did, or at least Ted and I tried to…" Andromeda trailed off. Over a year after her husband’s death, a dull pain blossomed inside her chest, reawakening like an old injury. Even Teddy’s sunshine could not soothe the gaping wound that had been carved out by the loss of their family. Its constant presence was reassuring, a faithful reminder that they had been happy and whole once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Last year's festivities were interrupted, for obvious reasons," Andromeda continued, cold steel hardening her words.</p><p>The previous May, the Tonks’ meagre Beltane celebrations had ground to a halt as a silvery hyena bounded into her living room, the Patronus effectively silencing all dinner conversation. Newborn Teddy had been delighted at its appearance, his chubby fingers reaching for the luminous wisps of magic.</p><p>Remus was the first to answer Fred Weasley's call to arms, despite all attempts to discourage him from charging into battle after weeks of malnourishment and fatigue. With the full moon only ten days away, it was a risk for even a talented dueller like Andromeda’s son-in-law.</p><p>Their newborn son coddled in her arms, Dora looked torn between asking Remus to stay or charging into battle with him. But the hard-headed werewolf would not be dissuaded from joining the fight, even as Dora whispered urgently into his ear and baby Teddy whimpered at the sound of their quiet argument. Sombre expression starkly pale against her pink hair, Dora reluctantly gave Remus her blessing to leave. <em>"If you need help, call for me and I will come to you," </em>she murmured within his embrace.</p><p>In retrospect, Andromeda knew that to be the moment she lost her daughter. As a mother, she should have realized that her impetuous Nymphadora—her brave little girl who earned her scars fearlessly fighting bullies on the playground—would not be content to wait and sit quietly while her husband risked his life.</p><p>By midnight, Dora’s patience had reached a breaking point.</p><p>In the months following the battle, whenever she closed her eyes to sleep, Andromeda could still see herself arguing, imploring, even <em>begging </em>her headstrong daughter to stay. Nightly, those visions held her hostage. And every night, without fail, Dora cuddled and kissed her infant son goodbye, the optimism in her voice faltering ever so slightly.</p><p><em>"Take care of him until I return,"</em> Dora instructed, her eyes blazing with determination, before wrapping her slender arms around Andromeda tightly. <em>"Love you, Mum."</em></p><p>Just before the valerian tonic finally kicks in, Andromeda’s last recollection is the strength of Dora's final, fierce embrace before disappearing from their lives with a sharp <em>crack.</em></p><p>A year after that fateful night, Teddy’s whimpers brought her back from the swirl of memories. The little boy cried for his grandmother to take him from Harry's arms, "Nana!" His young godfather had fallen silent, most likely submerged in his own recollections of the previous May.</p><p>Harry had become withdrawn in the weeks approaching the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, preferring the quiet solitude of Grimmauld Place to the overwhelming grief that hung heavy over the Burrow. To lift his spirits, Andromeda had invited the Potter boy to celebrate with her and Teddy at her home.</p><p>With the looming prospect of a highly-publicized memorial at Hogwarts, Harry had been roped into the role of honoured guest by the imposing Augusta Longbottom. Following the end of the war, Mrs Longbottom established herself as Chairwoman of the Ladies' Society Fundraising Committee for the Hogwarts Reparations Trust. Wielding her family influence and formidable headwear, Madame Longbottom had selected a motley party of reputable witches to aid her efforts—including Mrs Andromeda Tonks (née Black).</p><p>The Fundraising Committee had planned a large and lengthy event filled with speeches to commemorate the dead from both wars, as well as enough food to feed both attendees and Hogwarts staff and students. To his chagrin, Harry was scheduled to give a speech—an error from which Andromeda was unable to dissuade the committee—as well as unveil a large memorial plaque at the entrance of the Great Hall.</p><p>To atone for the massive, public, and most likely overwhelming event Harry would suffer through, Andromeda had planned Beltane as a private time for them to mourn the past—all the while embracing new beginnings.</p><p>After all, Beltane was about youth, fresh life, and <em>rebirth.</em></p><p>Taking her whimpering grandson from Harry's arms, Andromeda strapped a gurgling Teddy into his high chair, leftover from Dora's infancy. Fixing Teddy a plate of mushy foods, easy on his sensitive baby gums, she also handed Harry a plate of his own in the process: "Here, help yourself to anything you’d like."</p><p>The boy gratefully heaped mounds of succulent roast chicken, tender carrots and peas, and fluffy mashed potatoes. Not exactly a traditional Beltane spread of fruit and wine, but Andromeda supposed it would have to do.</p><p>While Harry wolfed down her cooking, Andromeda spoon-fed Teddy mashed potatoes that he diligently spat out on to his high chair and smeared on his face. Occasionally, she would spare a glance at the young boy—no, young <em>man</em>—who sat at her dinner table.</p><p>Despite having met James Potter only once in his youth, there was no mistaking the uncanny physical resemblance between father and son. Same handsome thin face, dishevelled midnight hair, and lanky-muscled frame.</p><p>However, to her eye, it was Remus Lupin's influence that became the most apparent to Andromeda. Upon meeting the Boy-Who-Lived, she had recognized the same starved look in his eyes: a hunger for family, friends, and unconditional love. Unbeknownst to Harry, who’d attempted to hide embarrassed tears upon first meeting his godson, Andromeda had looked at the Potter boy with quiet approval.</p><p>In Harry, she identified the quiet strength she had come to appreciate in Remus—sincere humility, awkward charm, and unwavering dedication. As much as Andromeda had enjoyed meeting young James, whose mischief had rivalled and complemented that of her cousin Sirius, it was these humble qualities that made Harry all the dearer to her.</p><p>And, more than anyone else in Andromeda's life, Harry understood the importance of family above all.</p><p>"Have you heard anything from the Malfoys recently?" she inquired politely, during a lull of conversation in the meal.</p><p>Andromeda used a cloth napkin to wipe away a smear of mushy peas from Teddy's cheek, since the toddler had yet to master hand-to-mouth coordination.</p><p>Once Harry paused and swallowed a forkful of flavourful roast, he shook his head apologetically. "Malfoy's still being monitored as far as I know, but Mrs Malfoy hasn't been seen or heard from in a while. I'd say she left for the continent like many of the others, but well…" he hesitated, green eyes pausing on Teddy.</p><p>"You doubt she'd leave Draco?" Andromeda asked frankly.</p><p>"Very doubtful," agreed Harry.</p><p>Cissa's loyalty to her son was infamous, to say the least. Though Andromeda felt she’d failed as an elder sister on many counts, Cissa’s fierce love for her child was one trait to be proud of.</p><p>"Well, you're right of course," she replied, setting aside Teddy's finished dinner. He'd done enough fingerpainting for the night.</p><p>With a flick of her wand, she summoned an envelope which soared into her hands from a bookshelf. On the back was a broken wax seal, emerald green inlaid with the Malfoy family crest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"This arrived with the morning owl," Andromeda informed him. "Narcissa… Well, my sister says she would like to see me."</p><p>She extended the letter for Harry's perusal, knowing it contained no sensitive information—the Black family was careful to treated all correspondence as potential blackmail. It was a concise missive, a courteous but stiff invitation to Narcissa's new residence, presumably still within Britain. An address would be provided upon RSVP.</p><p>Although Andromeda had checked for any Dark magic on her own, Harry still performed a few simple detection charms he'd learned during Auror training. Pale swirls of magic misting peacefully over the parchment, the letter gave no sign of being a curse, a trick, or a trap.</p><p>"It appears to be clean," he declared, scanning the contents.</p><p>"I thought so too," she agreed, and Teddy burped in chorus. "It doesn't seem forged either."</p><p>Returning the letter to its intended recipient, Harry leaned over to pick up Teddy, who had speedily crawled over to his favourite visitor once released from the abhorred high chair.</p><p>"Would you consider seeing Mrs Malfoy?" he asked carefully.</p><p>Before losing both daughter and husband in less than a year, Andromeda would have never even considered acknowledging such an intrusive question—let alone from a young man whose connections to the Black family were tangential at best.</p><p>Andromeda Black's strained relationship with her family was a subject those closest to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>her had learned not to broach. Even Ted, who had always carried some guilt over what his wife had chosen to sacrifice, rarely found Andromeda willing to discuss her feelings on the matter. And Ted had been her best friend, whose absence she still felt every day of her life.</p><p>But the Potter boy, <em>Harry</em>, had become something of an exception in Andromeda’s lonely new life—a special case if you will. Not only had she had come to rely on Harry for help with raising a rambunctious Teddy, but Harry had also been the sole witness to a significant moment between the two remaining Black sisters.</p><p>Simply put, Andromeda did not know what possessed her to go to the Malfoy trial.</p><p>One of the most publicized events of the year, the wizarding public was almost bloodthirsty in its desire to witness the fall of one of its most revered families. With the Dementor's Kiss barred as a possible sentence, the crowds gathered outside the courtroom and demanded <em>'Life! Life! Life!' </em>as the Malfoys entered the courtroom to face justice.</p><p>The trial was nothing short of mayhem.</p><p>In that foreboding tribunal chamber located within the bowels of the Ministry, the victims of Lucius Malfoy and his cronies called for his incarceration as the prosecution rolled out an unfathomably long list of crimes. Widows, orphans, and bereaved friends and relatives testified to the depravities of the Dark Lord and his faithful followers. The Wizengamot would then determine in which of those offences had Lucius and his son been involved.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, the Malfoy men were tried simultaneously rather than as separate cases for expediency's sake (a decision the Granger girl had unsuccessfully protested in court, alleging a violation of due process). The final effect was disconcerting.</p><p>Unlike the raving Lestrange brothers who preceded them, father and son stood stony—faces marble-white yet unflinching as allegations were hurled at them. Their Malfoy glamour had lost its characteristic sheen: expressions drawn and pale, platinum hair white and dull, and quicksilver eyes shuttered against the prying gaze of the Wizengamot.</p><p>As regal as a painted Madonna, Narcissa sat with the public, surrounded by Aurors to separate her from the masses clamouring for restitution, directly across from Andromeda. Following the revelation of her role in the Boy-Who-Lived’s survival and triumph, Narcissa Malfoy had become a polarizing public figure, redeemed and mistrusted in equal measure. Though Mrs Malfoy appeared to be unshaken by proceedings, Andromeda watched the intensity in her sister’s dark gaze, never straying far from her only child.</p><p>Utter silence descended when Harry took the stand, testifying in favour of Narcissa and her son. Despite Narcissa not being on trial, his defence of the mother was impassioned, recalling that without her intervention he would not have been able to defeat Voldemort. To the audience's discomfort, he reminded them that Narcissa Malfoy's love for her son had been a direct catalyst for the victory over Voldemort.</p><p>Draco Malfoy, Harry argued, was a pawn in the game of men far more powerful, cunning, and mercenary than him. The Malfoy heir was a disposable player in the plans of You-Know-Who. Even Dumbledore realized that Draco had only been set up for failure—Draco had never fought to win the war, only survive it.</p><p>On Lucius' behalf, Harry spoke sparsely and straightforwardly. Although his house and Gringotts account had been at You-Know-Who's disposal, toward the end Lucius was rarely an active participant in Voldemort's schemes. The man's fall from grace after the attack on the Ministry had rendered him inconsequential in the eyes of the Dark Lord. Ultimately, Lucius Malfoy was a self-serving coward who had renounced Voldemort while he was still alive, in order to search for his only son (although just prior to Voldemort’s defeat, as any self-respecting Slytherin would).</p><p>It was a powerful, memorable testimony that would eventually spare the Malfoys, whose last-minute switch in alliances had indebted Harry to them. It was also, Andromeda knew, not a testimony entirely of Harry's crafting. His friend Hermione, incensed by the Wizengamot's dismissal of her objection to group trials, had coached Harry relentlessly and now sat fuming in the seats reserved for the public.</p><p>Whilst the members of the Wizengamot deliberated in tense murmurs, the media, the accused, and the witnesses sat with bated breath. With her sister still seated beside the Malfoy solicitor, only Andromeda noticed how Cissa held herself absolutely rigid, lily-white hands clasped in the folds of her silk robes. Her lips moved minimally but rapidly, as if she was whispering to herself.</p><p>Andromeda knew better—her sister was praying to Her.</p><p>In the end, it was the testimony of another Hogwarts student, Terry Boot, that played a deciding factor in Draco's sentencing. Although the Death Eaters' spawn were expected to partake in the Carrows' punishments, no students punished by Draco ever experienced anything more severe than a sharp Stinging Hex. Most often, like Boot himself, they were subject to a mildly disfiguring jinx before being summarily sent on their way and instructed to keep quiet. The pattern only became apparent after Dumbledore’s Army—Andromeda internally snorted at Harry’s chosen name for his own loyal followers—compared notes.</p><p>The Wizengamot came to a decision: no Kiss for either man, but five years of probation for Draco and a ten year Azkaban sentence for Lucius, contingent upon his cooperation in testifying against his fellow Death Eaters. Draco would be required to return to Hogwarts to finish his schooling and help with the reconstruction efforts. [1]</p><p>Bedlam ensued in the courtroom as photographers and journalists alike erupted into a flurry of flashes and scribbling Quick-Quotes Quills. The Acting Chief Warlock, Griselda Marchbanks, was forced to call for order since the next defendant, Mulciber, was still awaiting trial.</p><p>The next morning, the front page of the Daily Prophet was emblazoned with a picture of Malfoy Sr.'s brief whispered goodbye to his wife and son before being whisked away into custody. It was then, right before the Aurors came to escort mother and son from the room, that Andromeda finally made eye contact with her sister.</p><p>What struck her the most was not the sheer vulnerability in Cissa's eyes (already disturbing enough in her usually glacial sister), but the split second it took for her sister to recognize her.</p><p>All of a sudden, the years of distance and silence between them had never felt as real and as tangible. Despite being sisters, born of the same womb and to the same House, Andromeda felt as if their separation had rendered Cissa a stranger.</p><p>The gaping vacuum inside her chest created by her family's deaths, which left her without breath at the most inopportune moments, immediately expanded as Andromeda realized the true scope of her own loss. Since her marriage, Andromeda had never felt faint, but for a split second, she was seventeen again and struggling to breathe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Not only had she lost the dead, she'd also lost the living.</p><p>Andromeda did not even notice that she was swaying on her feet until she felt the warm, steadying hand of the Potter boy on her shoulder. And so to Harry, and only Harry, would Andromeda ever consider giving the answer to such a personal question.</p><p>"Yes," she replied resolutely, heart softening as she looked at Teddy in Harry's arms.</p><p>Harry nodded. "Then whatever you need, you can count on me, Mrs Tonks."</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p><b>Number 12, </b> <b>Grimmauld Place, London</b></p><p>
  <b>New Moon, July 3, 1970</b>
</p><p>"Andromeda, <em>must </em>you be so rude to Rabastan Lestrange?" demanded an exasperated Aunt Walburga, sweeping into the drawing-room in a swirl of velvet robes, with all the airs of an injured countess. For reasons unknown to Andromeda, her aunt unfailingly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>wore dark velvet to each Deipnon dinner, even in that summer's unseasonable heat.</p><p>"Andromeda darling, sarcasm is just so unbecoming in a young lady," Grandmother Irma Black helpfully chimed in, already seated in her usual armchair by the fireplace. The night was too warm for a fire, but Aunt Walburga always insisted on being contradictory. "In my day, Amelia Greengrass' entire engagement was called off because she was uncouth enough to attempt a <em>joke</em> at dinner."</p><p>Aunt Cassie, Irma's sister-in-law, snorted in derision: "That wasn't because of a joke. It was because Amelia Greengrass was caught in a broom closet with her legs around a half-blood and her knickers around her ankles."</p><p>Grandmother Irma’s pale thin cheeks flushed in distaste, and Aunt Cassie crowed mockingly: "Why Irma, is your memory failing already?"</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Andromeda Black hid an unladylike snort from her viperous elders, knowing that her mother would not shield her from Walburga if things got nasty—and they so often did, whenever the entirety of the Black clan descended upon Grimmauld Place.</p><p>After a particularly excruciating Deipnon dinner, one of the few times so many Blacks could be persuaded to convene in Aunt Walburga's ridiculous townhouse fortress, the ladies and gentlemen of the party had retired to separate rooms. In Uncle Orion's private study on the third floor, the men were off to puff on imported cigars and gamble away Galleons that only wizards of their standing could afford to spare.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Other pure-blood families were more modern, like Andromeda’s Rosier cousins, who retired together for drinks in their library, but the Black witches were sticklers for tradition.</p><p>In the opulent second-floor drawing-room, the ladies gathered for coffee, digestifs, and scathing gossip. The most recent subject of interest was the Lestrange men, the family of Bella's abhorrent new fiancé. Ever since Father and Mother had formally announced Bella's betrothal at the previous Beltane, the Lestranges—specifically Rabastan—had been simply <em>impossible</em> to escape. The ink had barely dried on Bellatrix's engagement contract before Rodolphus' younger brother had unsubtly begun to drop his own heavy hints towards Andromeda.</p><p>Purposefully seated beside her during dinner, Rabastan had immediately attempted to ensnare Andromeda for every social event of the upcoming season. Under the watchful gaze of her delightful family, she'd successfully parried every invitation with a myriad of excuses before he tried to secure her as his date for the Malfoys' Yule Ball. She'd been unable to conjure up an excuse for an event so far in the future (it was still only July, for Circe’s sake) but Andromeda was saved by the scraping of chairs as Uncle Orion hastily adjourned the dinner party.</p><p>Before Rabastan could continue to harangue her, Andromeda politely excused herself and scurried away to the drawing-room. Pure-blood witches should never run, but that night Andromeda came suspiciously close.</p><p>"Andromeda, <em>look at me when I am addressing you,"</em> commanded Aunt Walburga imperiously from the chintz loveseat.</p><p>Seated across from Walburga, Mother shot her sister-in-law a sharp look. Though Mother would never admit so, Andromeda suspected she found Aunt Walburga's manners to be lacking—and Druella Black prided herself on immaculate deportment. Proper witches did not rely upon the overbearing mannerisms Aunt Walburga was known for, and Mother instead advocated for a more subtle art of feminine warfare.</p><p>"What did I do wrong, Aunt Walburga?" Andromeda sighed quietly, dangerously verging on insolent. "He asked me if I was interested in attending the theatre with him and I answered honestly."</p><p>"You asked if he had tickets for separate boxes," Cissa reminded her primly under her breath, as if Andromeda would soon forget Rabastan's bewildered expression.</p><p>"Aunt Walburga, why won't you believe me if I say that I <em>honestly</em> believe the theatre is best enjoyed when you eliminate all possible distractions?" countered Andromeda, as cautiously as she could manage. Although it was amusing to frustrate her aunt, Walburga was known for her volatile temper and predilection for unpleasant hexes.</p><p>Aunt Cassie smirked mischievously, already sipping on her second digestif. "And young men can be such a distraction, can't they darling?"</p><p>Playing with the fine beading on her new robes, Andromeda pointedly ignored Cissa's knowing smile. Rabastan Lestrange <em>was</em> distracting, to the point where Andromeda had considered a Silencing Charm to safeguard her sanity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Just turned fifteen, Cissa had finally been deemed old enough to partake in these post-dinner conversations, instead of being sent home for bed. Andromeda’s younger sister took to gossip and scheming with the type of aplomb that she herself would have to fake all her life. Even Bella despised these affairs, despite being Walburga's beloved goddaughter.</p><p>"Rabastan is very handsome though," whispered Cissa beside her, careful to not be overheard. "Certainly much nicer-looking than the boys in my year."</p><p>Breathtakingly lovely since birth, Cissa had just begun to receive her own formal offers for courtship from some of Britain's finest families. Quietly, Andromeda suspected Cissa was waiting for a specific offer, from a certain scion from a certain prominent House, known for siring blonde sons with pointy faces.</p><p>"Rabastan would make a fine husband for you, Andromeda. Wouldn't he, Druella?" declared Aunt Walburga, who considered herself an authority on all subjects pertaining to the Black family. Her husband, Andromeda's Uncle Orion, was set to be the next Black family patriarch. As such, Walburga believed herself to be closer to divinity each day, as long as Patriarch Arcturus would hurry up and bite the dust already.</p><p><em>"Ha!"</em> snorted Violetta Black, Andromeda’s great-grandmother, breaking her silence from her own spot beside the fireplace.</p><p>Born a Bulstrode witch, the true family Matriarch was a wizened crone almost as ancient as the odious tapestry that hung in the room. Perpetually draped in swaths of black lace since her husband's death thirty years prior, Violetta resembled a very blind, very frilly bat as she scrutinized Andromeda through her golden monocle.</p><p>"This girl of yours is much smarter than your first one, Druella," she croaked approvingly with a pointed glance at Bellatrix, who stood silently glowering beside the open window. "You may be quick to forget, but I remember Corvus Lestrange before all that little <em>unpleasantness</em> happened. This branch of the family isn't so distantly related to them as you'd like to believe, Walburga." [2]</p><p>Among pure-blood society, phrases such as 'the unpleasantness' or 'the little trouble' were nearly always utilized as euphemisms for incest, murder, or Muggles (or some lurid combination of the three). In this case, Andromeda had interacted enough with the Lestranges to know that was a stone best left unturned.</p><p>Violetta's daughter, Aunt Cassie, made no attempt to hide her sharp laugh. <em>"No one </em>in pure-blood Britain is distantly related, Mummy-dearest. That's why it's better to live on the continent than start marrying cousins."</p><p>"How can you think so, when you've never been married at all?" rallied Irma, in quick defence of her daughter Walburga's marriage.</p><p>Cassiopeia Black, technically Andromeda’s great-aunt, was the spinster of her generation—a fact which Grandmother Irma would always lord over her, despite Aunt Cassie’s complete disregard for matrimony.</p><p>After the defeat of Grindelwald (and a society scandal that meant she never spoke to her father again), she'd absconded to France to live out her days in a sumptuous pied-à-terre as an independently wealthy lady of leisure. Retaining her dark good looks even at an advanced age, Aunt Cassie's rare visits to Britain were often solely intended to scandalize her family—arriving in a flurry of luxurious perfume, sensuous silk, and unabashed hedonism. [3]</p><p>And while Grandmother Irma might have relished in Aunt Cassie's unmarried state, Andromeda had long suspected her great-aunt never wanted for company in her Parisian flat.</p><p>Ignoring her daughter and daughter-in-law's petty jabs at each other, Great-grandmother Violetta forged on. Borderline incest, after all, was just one of the many dubious ways the wizarding elite of Britain had forged their Most Ancient and Noble Houses and kept themselves pure for generations. After centuries, quibbling about it was simply a moot point.</p><p>"The Lestranges have already witnessed the collapse of one of their lines, only She knows if they have it in them to continue this one. Tell me, girl, did your father ascertain that <em>everything </em>would be in order when the time comes?" Violetta asked, peering inquisitively at Bellatrix, her suggestive meaning clear to everyone in the room.</p><p>Bella's visage whitened before turning a peculiar shade of grey, hand fisting in the pocket of her dress that Andromeda knew concealed her wand. Father had refused to buy Bella a wand holster for her birthday, leaving Bella to accidentally singe the inner lining of all her formal robes.</p><p>Knowing Bella's quick temper was often her downfall, Mother hastened to address her grandmother-in-law's concerns as tactfully as her Rosier manners would allow. "Madame, I assure you Cygnus would never sign a contract if all wasn't perfectly in—"</p><p>"I don't know, Mummy dearest," cut in Aunt Cassie with just a hint of bite, slate grey eyes dancing merrily. "Such <em>ladylike hands </em>those boys had. I’ve never seen such delicate fingers."</p><p>"Let's hope Rodolphus’ appendages aren’t all delicate!" snickered the old woman, mother and daughter sharing a good joke at Bellatrix's expense.</p><p>Scrambling for self-control, Andromeda fought the insane urge to laugh by biting the inside of her cheek and clenching her hands into the folds of her dress. Though Cissa remained impassive as always, Andromeda heard the tiniest exhale of amusement.</p><p>The eldest Black sister, always at odds with the crotchety Matriarch, shot them a look of injured betrayal, as if she hadn't laughed at Andromeda's expense a million times before. Though Bella wouldn’t dare retaliate under their great-grandmother's eye, something in her expression promised vengeance. Ever since childhood, Bella had made sure to toe the line under the adults' noses and unleash demons behind their backs.</p><p>Experience made Andromeda take note—she would need to ward her room that night, to protect her from one of Bella's signature nasty little hexes.</p><p><em>"Madame!"</em> hissed a scandalized Grandmother Irma, her prim features pinched in dismay. "There is nothing wrong with their fingers, they're perfectly formed. Just the right size."</p><p>As this set off another round of laughter, leaving Grandmother Irma looked vaguely perplexed and insulted.</p><p>According to Aunt Cassie after a few drinks, Irma Crabbe had once been a great society beauty—considered by all wizards as the catch of the season. However, a visibly unhappy marriage had set unkind tongues wagging, with pure-blood society suggesting that Irma's naive conservative tendencies had driven her philandering husband, Grandfather Pollux, to find his entertainment elsewhere. [4]</p><p>However, since Aunt Cassie rarely interacted with her family entirely sober, Andromeda could not confidently ascertain the veracity of this last bit of gossip. Cissa’s delicate inquiry the following morning had been met with a mysterious smile.</p><p>"You know what they say about <em>hands</em>, girl," leered Violetta, who greatly enjoyed needling her prudish daughter-in-law. "They match the—"</p><p>"I think that's quite enough, Aunt Violetta," intervened Lucretia Prewett (née Black), who'd sat quietly amused for most of the conversation. "Andromeda and Narcissa are still schoolgirls and Narcissa is only fifteen."</p><p>The stylish Lucretia was Andromeda's favourite aunt, even though she was technically her cousin some many times removed.</p><p>Although Mrs Prewett also lived in London with her attractive husband, she rarely made appearances at her brother Orion's dinners. Her official excuse was that poor Ignatius' asthma could not bear the stuffy air inside of Number 12, Grimmauld Place. Unofficially, most Blacks knew that it was due to Lucretia’s poorly concealed loathing of her sister-in-law.</p><p>"Everyone knew what <em>you </em>were doing at fifteen, Lucretia," snarked Walburga, who thought Lucretia was a bit presumptuous, acting and dressing too young for her years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Personally, Andromeda believed she was simply jealous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>While Aunt Walburga insisted on wearing the ostentatious dark robes of her youth, Lucretia swanned about in the colourful gauzy robes recently popularized by the songstress Celestina Warbeck. The whole effect was that, although Lucretia was a few years older than Walburga, she looked almost entirely two decades younger.</p><p>Additionally, the recent discovery that Great-aunt Cassie had also adopted the new lightweight styles (with a décolletage that plunged even more dangerously than Lucretia's) only added insult to injury.</p><p>"It may come as a surprise to you, dearest Wally," retorted Aunt Lucretia, unintimidated by her cousin and sister-in-law. "But school is primarily intended for learning, not for scheming to steal our best friend's beau."</p><p>As the vein in Walburga's forehead bulged, Andromeda discreetly turned away and stared down a rather gaudy arrangement of hothouse flowers, tucked amongst the potentially lethal knick-knacks of Grimmauld Place. She could not risk making eye contact with Cissa.</p><p>Even Mother, who always tried to appease her tempestuous sister-in-law, had to lightly press dainty fingertips against her lips to control a smile that verged on peeking through her stately demeanour.</p><p>For anybody fool enough to make the Black family’s acquaintance, the assiduously disseminated family legend was that Walburga and Orion had been destined for each other since birth. There was simply no match with a more illustrious heritage and a higher pedigree in all of wizarding Britain.</p><p>Off the record, on a shopping excursion to her aunt’s preferred Parisian atelier, Lucretia had once revealed to Andromeda that Walburga had pursued Orion relentlessly after discovering his liaison with one of her best friends—and also her biggest rival. Walburga could not stand someone having something over her.</p><p><em>‘She's always been greedy,’</em> Lucretia had remarked disparagingly at a particularly awful Deipnon dinner last winter, careful to not be overheard. Aunt Walburga was not above using her little house-elf as a spy.</p><p>"The Lestranges are a fine family for any of our girls to marry into," said Mother, in an attempt to redirect the conversation back to the original subject, used to de-escalating family squabbles. Considering the clan of impetuous and headstrong Blacks she'd married into, the graceful Druella Rosier had become adept at keeping storms at bay. "We already have the Patriarch's approval."</p><p>"Arcturus is a <em>fool</em>, a damned fool who only cares about that ridiculous pamphlet," declared Violetta contemptuously, referring to her nephew—a foreboding man who abided by Cantankerous Nott's <em>Pure-Blood Directory </em>almost religiously. Both he and his wife Melania had ‘regretfully’ declined their invitation to dinner.</p><p>Considering that Great-uncle Arcturus was an ageing curmudgeon who rarely left the confines of the old Black family estate, Andromeda found it hard to believe he was also Aunt Lucretia's father.</p><p>"When it comes down to it, the Lestranges don't follow the old ways," Violetta continued darkly. "And you girls, don't let these silly fools convince you otherwise: heathenism is much more unfortunate than a Squib or two in the family line. At least <em>those</em> can be dealt with appropriately."</p><p>If Aunt Walburga had been able to <em>Avada </em>her own grandmother, Andromeda was certain she would have done it without a second thought. As it was, most of the ladies in the room looked mildly uncomfortable with such an unwitting declaration of tolerance (or nonchalant acceptance of murder)—but all appeared unwilling to contradict the Matriarch.</p><p>For as long as Andromeda had been alive, the Black witches had been tip-toeing around her great-grandmother in hopes of staying in her favour (and in her will). After all, the old bat was said to have a collection of trinkets that rivalled the even the Selwyn family jewels.</p><p>"Nobody believes in that dragonshite anymore," retorted Bella, who couldn't give a damn about glittering diamonds unless they were cursed. At last, her patience had run out with the old bat. "Not in the Goddess or any of that nonsense you blather on about."</p><p><em>"Bellatrix,</em> don't swear in front of your great-grandmother," admonished Mother in a soft voice, never letting a harsh word cross her perfectly bred mouth.</p><p>"That <em>dragonshite</em>, as you call it young lady, is the root of all Magic. To understand it and to venerate it is beyond your pitiful scope of comprehension," retorted Violetta scathingly, peering at Bella with quite a bit of haughty condescension. "May She illuminate your path before you become irredeemable."</p><p>"So may it be," chorused Aunt Lucretia in frank agreement.</p><p>Madame Violetta Black was a living relic in many ways, but never more so than when she talked about the Old Religion.</p><p>In centuries past, wizards had believed Magic was a primal force, rooted deep in the bowels of the Earth. Its forces were supposed to be governed by the Goddess: a three-fold being who was maid, mother, and crone, and who had gifted wizards and witches with the ability to harness Her magic. During Great-grandmother Violetta's youth, the elder generations had still venerated the Goddess and the beings who'd roamed over her dominion, sources of all magic. When at her most nostalgic, Violetta had spoken of moonlit rituals and wild bonfire nights, extravagant feasts and ritual sacrifices to appease the Goddess.</p><p>Of course, with the advent of modernity, most widespread practice of the Old Religion had faded. Only the oldest of pure-bloods remained faithful and, even then, Christmas and Easter were popular celebrations among the younger set. Indeed, very few of her fellow students believed or even knew about the old ways at all, least of all Muggle-borns.</p><p>Andromeda supposed bloody animal sacrifices could not really compete with brightly wrapped presents under a glittering tree.</p><p>Still, the Blacks gathered to celebrate the holy days to appease the old lady, who (Aunt Walburga hoped) had little time left to share with them. The first family dinner of the summer break was a particular favourite of the Matriarch. Though Deipnon was held on the new moon of each month, having the younger set back from break gave Violetta an opportunity to berate three generations of Blacks over their many and varied failings in person.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix, who’d withstood more than one sly dig over five different courses that night, was starting to look as if she very much wanted to tell Violetta exactly where her Goddess could go shove it.</p><p>Sensing her sister was at the end of her tether, Andromeda sought to escape any potential bloodshed. Her periwinkle organza dress robes were new and she'd been hoping to wear them to the Young Ladies' Society tea the following week.</p><p>"Pardon me, but I need to use the powder room," announced Andromeda, seizing on the brief lull in the conversation. With Bella already sharpening her claws, she was eager to leave soon. After all, there was only so much time the Black women could tolerate being in the same room together.</p><p>Once she'd hidden for a satisfactory amount of time in the guest toilet, Andromeda reluctantly exited and headed down the dark second-floor corridor. For all her airs of grandeur, Walburga could certainly be odd—refusing to light the candles in the hallways during the summer. It was her aunt's own damn fault that her guests kept tripping over that heinous umbrella stand.</p><p>
  <em>"Pssst! Pssst, Andy!"</em>
</p><p>Quiet giggles came from the winding staircase at the opposite end of the hall. Two handsome boys, aged ten and nine, dangled their raven-haired heads precariously over the edge of the landing. Regulus, cautious as always, shot nervous looks at the drawing-room door, while Sirius greeted her with his usual debonair grin.</p><p>"Why good evening, dear cousin," he drawled.</p><p>"Reggie, Sirius, you absolute <em>scoundrels,"</em> Andromeda smiled, by way of greeting. "How did you two escape on Kreacher's watch?"</p><p>Mischievous little Sirius gave her a signature angelic smile, which told Andromeda that Kreacher had most likely been the subject of a devilish prank. She hoped Sirius hadn't tricked him into Apparating into Muggle London again, since Aunt Walburga had punished Kreacher rather severely that time.</p><p>Sirius deliberately ignored Reggie's panicked tugging at his sleeve. "Nothing of the sort, Andy. Say, you wouldn't happen to have any of those delicious biscuits, would you?"</p><p>"Has Aunt ordered Kreacher not to give you any?" queried Andromeda, bemused.</p><p>"One could say that," he admitted slowly. "But she never said we couldn't ask <em>you </em>to give us any."</p><p>Adorably, Reggie and Sirius attempted to look innocent and utterly failed. <em>"Please,</em> Andy?" they chorused pleadingly.</p><p>Hearing the rumble of men's voices from upstairs, Andromeda hurriedly handed over her own stash of Kreacher's biscuits. She preferred Memsie's chocolate-chip biscuits anyways—her family’s house-elf had a better grasp on flavours, having trained with the Rosier elves in her youth. "Here, but don't say you got them from me!"</p><p>Delighted, Sirius opened his gob and immediately crammed two into his mouth, shoving the rest in his pyjama pocket. With a muffled, <em>"</em>Cheers!" he hauled his little brother up and together they scampered back up to their rooms.</p><p>For the life of her, Andromeda could never figure out how Walburga had managed to produce such charming boys. It was enough to make a person doubt their parentage, but the thought of Walburga taking a lover was both disgusting and unimaginable.</p><p>"Meda, where are you? We're heading home!" drifted Cissa's voice down the hall, as the ladies began to take their leave.</p><p>Andromeda nearly sighed with relief. Thank the Goddess, she <em>despised </em>family dinners at Grimmauld Place.</p><p> </p>

  <b>Rosier Mews House, London</b>
</p><p>
  <b>New Moon, July 13, 1999</b>
</p><p>When Andromeda had first broken ties with her family, Cissa hadn't been at home—her younger sister had left early for a shopping excursion to Diagon Alley with her schoolmates. Already graduated from Hogwarts, Andromeda had taken advantage of a quiet summer morning at Asterfield House to leave without fuss and bother, only stopping to deposit a letter on the drawing-room table, slipping out through a side door unseen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Neither Father nor Mother had reached out to her since, although Gringotts had sent an owl to notify Andromeda that her access to the Black vaults had been revoked.</p><p>Because she had never really witnessed Cissa’s reaction, Andromeda once privately hoped that her younger sister hadn’t taken her departure as poorly as the rest of the Blacks (Aunt Walburga had sent a lovely flower arrangement containing Devil’s Snare). Remote silence meant that Andromeda was free to imagine Cissa didn’t wholly despise her, even though her intuition told her otherwise.</p><p>But Cissa had always been Andromeda’s favourite, her precious baby sister.</p><p>After a difficult labour, Mother had welcomed her and Bella into the nursery of the country manor where the sisters had grown up. A vicious fight had promptly broken out between the toddlers, over which of them would be first to hold the angelic newborn in the bassinet, who woke and wailed when jostled. Despite being sent to bed crying and without supper, it marked the beginning of a lifelong dynamic between the Black sisters.</p><p>Lustrous hair like pale gold silk, Cissa took after the fair Rosiers, rather than matching the traditional Black dark good-looks of her elder siblings. Cissa was indisputably the darling of the three sisters, wholly beloved and rarely denied anything she ever wanted.</p><p>Despite the coddling, Cissa grew to be an even-tempered and well-behaved girl, if a bit capricious. As the middle child, constantly at odds with the domineering and explosive Bella, Andromeda welcomed Cissa's soothing manners as a respite from the ever-present bickering. Foul-tempered Bella did the same and little Cissa grew to be the adhesive that bound the sisters together, often playing quiet confidante and advisor to both.</p><p>Until she made her fateful decision, Andromeda had not really understood what life without Cissa’s steadying presence would mean.</p><p>As was expected with every errant Black, Andromeda’s close connection with her sister was effectively severed by her whirlwind—and abhorred—elopement with Ted Tonks. After her departure, Andromeda’s first and last letter to Cissa was returned unopened, wax seal intact.</p><p>Regardless of the pain caused by the rift, leaving her family was a decision she could never bring herself to regret. The years she had spent with Ted and their daughter were full of more life and joy than all her time as part of the Black family.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Most tellingly of all, Andromeda struggled to regret her lost ties to Bella in the same way she missed being Cissa’s elder sister.</p><p>Over the years—through society pages and wagging tongues—Andromeda heard of the life that she herself might have lived. The wizarding press eagerly covered Cissa's enviable marriage to that Malfoy bastard (not literally, <em>the scandal)</em> and her life of dazzling charity galas and glittering robes. The birth of a long-awaited heir was splashed announced by Rita Skeeter’s scathing quill, and Dora returned from Hogwarts with rumours about the Malfoys unsavoury ties to that <em>other </em>bastard (that one quite literally).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Not once over the years had Cissa written to her, not even when Bellatrix had been justifiably condemned to rot in prison over those unspeakable crimes (Bella, her brooding, passionate, and temperamental older sister, had been dead to her since then. Whoever emerged from Azkaban, whatever heartless monster she became—Andromeda was welcome to despise that person freely).</p><p>Not once had she heard from Cissa.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Not once until that letter in May, over twenty years and two bloody wars later.</p><p>On a bright July morning, Andromeda stood on a lonely Muggle sidewalk, facing a long-forgotten mews house in the historically fashionable Mayfair district of London. From the outside, the house appeared small and unassuming—very different from the lavishness of the Malfoy townhouse Andromeda knew was tucked away somewhere else the city. If anything, Cissa’s choice in abandoning her husband’s residence was strategic, that Andromeda could tell, but for what purpose was yet to be determined.</p><p>Fisted in one hand was Narcissa's message, a perfunctory olive branch on luxurious heavy parchment—enchanted to self-destruct to if opened by the wrong hands. For her younger sister, the war was clearly far from over.</p><p>Approaching the house carefully, Andromeda surreptitiously flicked her wand, feeling her magic brush up against the magical protections. The old Rosier wards hummed, recognizing one of their own blood, while an additional layer of Legilimency sussed out her intentions. Had those been less than innocent, Andromeda suspected a more malignant curse would have made an appearance—one of the barely legal variety, long favoured by the Black family.</p><p>Once a Black sister, always a Black sister, Andromeda mused.</p><p>Having passed muster, Andromeda quietly strode up to the white brick façade and sharply knocked on the simple black front door. It was an unnecessary nicety—if Cissa and her boy knew what was good for them, they would have been aware of her presence the moment she Apparated on their doorstep.</p><p>Without pause, the door swung open to reveal a wizened little house-elf. Her bulbous eyes were a nebulous blue, nearly blinded by cataracts, and she wore a neatly pressed white pillowcase with eyelet lace trim as a shift.</p><p>"Memsie?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>asked Andromeda, surprise colouring her voice.</p><p>"Missy Andromeda," croaked Memsie, the old Rosier house-elf who had no business living longer than Methuselah. "Come inside, my Mistress will see you in her parlour."</p><p>In line with pure-blood tradition, Mother had most likely given Cissa her own house-elf as a wedding gift. Originally intended as a way to protect newly-wedded daughters, gifted house-elves often served as key allies to the young women in their husbands' households. Since house-elf magic was dependent on their mistresses’ magical core, Memsie's loyalty was solely to Narcissa and her offspring, not Lucius Malfoy.</p><p>Stepping over the threshold, Andromeda discovered a bright and airy interior, simply decorated in the mauve blues and ivories left over from the Rosiers' French heritage.</p><p>Originally part of Druella Rosier's dowry, Andromeda knew Father had not found much use for the quaint little mews house during their London visits, particularly when the much more opulent Grimmauld Place was just across town. He had not seen any appeal to the converted carriage house attached to the back of old Rosier Place, so close to his interfering in-laws. It seemed that after Druella's death, the house had gone to her favourite daughter.</p><p>Despite being reoccupied, the house looked unmistakably shuttered and unused. Paintings and furniture were covered by protective cloths, a thin layer of dust coating most surfaces. Although a few spots looked like they had been vigorously tackled with a duster, for the most part, the house appeared uninhabited.</p><p>For all her undying loyalty, poor old Memsie seemed to be at what Aunt Walburga had affectionately called 'the beheading age.'</p><p>With a brisk hobble, Memsie ushered Andromeda into a dainty sitting room, which appeared to be the only room clean enough for entertaining. Two chintz chairs faced a set of French doors leading to a fragrant garden, replete with magical blooms that should have been out of season. A delicate porcelain tea set was already served with steaming tea and chocolate—a Muggle brand, Andromeda noted.</p><p>From one of those chintz armchairs stood an elegant, slender figure.</p><p><em>Oh, Cissa</em>.</p><p>Narcissa Black was still as beautiful as ever, but the delicate planes of her face appeared sharp and hardened, fine marble worn down by age, worry, and pain. The resplendent champagne hair of her youth had faded to platinum blonde, streaked with white at the temples and braided into a neat coronet around her head.</p><p>A queen with no throne, no king, and no land.</p><p>"Andromeda, thank you for coming. Please, take a seat," Cissa spoke in a quiet sigh, as if her voice went unused for long periods of time, and gestured wanly towards the chair beside her.</p><p>Despite the long years apart, neither hugged nor wept upon reuniting. Instead, they scrutinized each other carefully, taking in any significant changes and searching for cues to inform the subsequent interaction. It was a reunion that would have made their mother proud—even as a young parent, Druella had loathed tears and snot. Had Cissa collapsed into some unseemly display of emotion, Andromeda would have suspected some trickery, enchantment, or potion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>"The Barmiest and Most Bigoted House of Black,"</em> teased Ted’s voice, always lingering in the back of her mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>From the first eye contact, Andromeda could sense that Cissa did not seek sympathy or pity, let alone an over-emotional tearful reunion that reeked of insincerity. Choosing the direct approach, Andromeda opted for Ted-esque frankness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Why have you asked me here, Cissa?"</p><p>Her sister pointedly chose to not to respond. "Let's have some tea first, shall we? Memsie, please offer my sister some refreshments."</p><p>Although Memsie did not abide by the Black family tree as Kreacher did, the emphasis on the familial relationship established that Narcissa would not permit any disrespect under her roof. It was a peace offering, expressing to Andromeda that Narcissa was willing to recognize her as one of her own.</p><p>She accepted the proffered cup, patiently waiting for Cissa to initiate the conversation. Unlike Bella, Andromeda had never been one to ruin the moment with impetuousness.</p><p>"I believe I owe you an apology," began Cissa, perfectly composed other than the tightly clasped slender hand in her lap. "No, I <em>know</em> I do. Many apologies, in fact."</p><p>"For?" Andromeda arched an inquisitive brow, curious about what Cissa believed she had to atone for. It was also an expression that highlighted her uncanny resemblance to their sister Bella. From the slight tightening of her mouth, it appeared Cissa saw the similarity as well.</p><p>"Where to begin?" Cissa hesitated. "For your husband, for your daughter, even for her werewolf husband—"</p><p>"His name was <em>Remus</em>—" Andromeda broke in, her temper flaring. She would not tolerate any disrespect towards her daughter's husband, a far nobler man than any in their mutual acquaintance.</p><p>"Forgive me, I did not mean to offend."</p><p>Looking more chastised than a woman of her age should, Narcissa fell silent. Her entire demeanour lacked the quiet confidence that had enabled her to rule pure-blood society with an iron grip. Instead, she seemed uncertain, as if she was treading on thin ice and didn't know where to step.</p><p>Observing the blossoming garden beyond the French doors, Andromeda noticed a cluster of rare white stargazer lilies. Among the brightly coloured blooms at Dora's and Remus' funeral had been a modest wreath of these, the preferred flower of the Black family. No note had accompanied the arrangement.</p><p>Resolving to be kinder, Andromeda smiled ruefully. "Old habits die hard, don't they? Even I had difficulties coming to terms with their marriage—not because of what he was, but because of the hardship I knew Dora would face by association. But Remus was a good man, in spite of his condition."</p><p>Andromeda decided that if she was committing to this, she would work on Cissa's prejudices later, tabling that inevitable conversation for another time.</p><p>Cissa looked regretful, or as close to regretful as Narcissa Black could look.</p><p>"It's not just for the werewolf. It's for the years of missed opportunities, for the distance, for not being brave…" her voice became almost inaudible. "For Bella."</p><p>Even in death, Bella's overbearing presence was inescapable. The weight of her memory settled in the heavy silence between the remaining Black sisters, who'd mourned the loss of their third long before her passing.</p><p>"None of us can be held responsible for Bella," declared Andromeda, breaking the ice with a tone sharper than intended. Cissa had always cared for Bella more than she ever could, making excuses for things Andromeda had found unforgivable (like water and oil they'd been, since birth). "She chose her fate a long time ago."</p><p>Cissa looked resigned. "Even then, I did not nothing while our family was driven apart, while Bella fell into the clutches of that madman. We walked straight past the gates of Tartarus, Meda, but I did nothing to stop it."</p><p>Despite the sombre topic at hand, Andromeda's heart surged with hope. Cissa had not called her <em>Meda</em> in over twenty-five years.</p><p>"If you have asked me here to atone for every sin you have ever committed Cissa, you are wasting my time," Andromeda replied, tone measured. "I am no priestess. The war is over and the past is in the past. We cannot change what happened… The only thing you can change is what will."</p><p>"How? How can I change anything? Look at what we've been reduced to," Narcissa retorted, gesturing helplessly at her current abode—though not exactly destitution, it was a far cry from the luxuries of Malfoy Manor. "I'm irrelevant on my best days, despised at my worst. I can't even live in my own home, it's been quarantined by the Aurors for months. This isn’t living Meda, it’s <em>surviving."</em></p><p>The torrent of words came out in a harsh rush, the first break in Cissa's composure. Oh Cissa, some things never really do change.</p><p>Andromeda nearly rolled her eyes, unimpressed. She wanted to end what looked like a months-long pity party before it really took steam. "Seems to me an improvement from having You-Know-Who at your breakfast table."</p><p>Cissa's jaw tightened, "The Dark Lord <em>never</em>—"</p><p><em>"You-Know-Who,"</em> Andromeda emphasized, wanting to nip that 'Dark Lord' nonsense in the bud as well, "is as dead as a doorknob, thank Harry Potter. You're alive and that's more than others can say."</p><p>Involuntarily, Andromeda touched the collar of her robes, underneath which rested a cheap silver Muggle locket with pictures of Dora and Ted, the reassuring cool of the metal always pressed against her chest.</p><p>Cissa fell silent, but she was still clasping her hands tightly.</p><p>"What about your boy, where is he?"</p><p>"Draco is… asleep, I believe.”</p><p>Andromeda paused in surprise. "It's almost <em>midday</em>, Cissa."</p><p>For the first time, Cissa looked discomfited by Andromeda’s incredulous gaze. Both women were aware that most strapping eighteen-year-olds did not waste their days in bed—especially the well-bred kind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Draco just returned from Hogwarts,” replied Cissa, eyes defensive. “He has few friends left in Britain, those who aren't in Azkaban have left for the continent."</p><p>Not a surprise. Most pure-blood families with questionable allegiances during the war had decamped for the continent as soon as the borders opened up again. These families had syphoned off their wealth to where the Ministry would not be able to follow.</p><p>"So he wastes his days in bed?” retorted Andromeda.</p><p>"Master Draco is a not being a proper wizard,” croaked a defiant voice from the corner of the room. “He sleeps all day and then goes out after supper. Mistress isn't seeing, but he comes back after Mistress has gone to bed, smelling like a liquor cabinet.”</p><p>"<em>Memsie!"</em> rebuked Narcissa sharply, but the little house-elf is unmoved.</p><p>Andromeda was pleased to see that Cissa had not attempted to squash her house-elf's spirit—although it would have been near impossible, considering Memsie had seen them all in nappies. Memsie had always been loyal to her mistresses and their offspring, but she loathed to see them behaving below their station. In her unforgiving approach to propriety, Memsie was all that remained of their mother Druella.</p><p>Taking note of this potential ally, Andromeda forged on. "Draco needs an occupation then, something to do with his time so he does not fall into idleness. Have you been in contact with that husband of yours?"</p><p>If the mention of Draco had made Cissa vulnerable, bringing up Lucius turned her to stone. "I have not seen Lucius in months."</p><p>Wisely, Andromeda kept her thoughts to herself as Cissa did not seem to want to elaborate further. Her dear brother-in-law was certainly in trouble.</p><p>Personally, Andromeda thought it would have been ideal to have Lucius locked away for life. However, she knew her sister would suffer without her ridiculous peacock of a husband. In any case, he would be dealt with when the time came (in nine years, thank the Goddess).</p><p>"And what do <em>you </em>do all day, Cissa? Tea parties?" The question was a little tactless to be sure, but Andromeda knew it would bring out whatever backbone was left in her sister.</p><p>Immediately, Cissa's voice turned hard. "The families of our acquaintance are either out of the country or indisposed to receive us—despite taking full advantage of our hospitality when it was <em>You-Know-Who</em> summoning them to the Manor. Nowhere else is the Malfoy name welcome."</p><p>"Then, have you thought about an occupation? A job, perhaps?"</p><p>Cissa looked aghast, as if Andromeda had suggested she take Tom, the elderly bartender at the Leaky Cauldron, as a lover.</p><p>Loyal Memsie harrumphed from the corner of the room, similarly offended.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"I hardly mean that you start working as a barmaid at the Hog's Head. But you can't hide away forever, Cissa. You're still young."</p><p>Her sister still seemed unconvinced. "But what would I even <em>do?</em> And if Lucius were to receive word that I was working—"</p><p><em>"Narcissa Black,"</em> scolded Andromeda, inadvertently channelling the steely mannerisms of their great-grandmother. "Your husband is rotting away in prison and your son is wasting away at home and drinking himself to sleep every night. What do you plan to do about it?"</p><p>Narcissa's blue gaze turned steely at Andromeda's challenge. A creaking above their heads alerted them to the movements of the last, unseen occupant of the mews house. Although it was now past noon, it seemed Draco was finally awake.</p><p>Cissa turned to Andromeda, expression determined.</p><p>"Well, I supposed we better get started then.”</p><p>Andromeda smiled, slow and conspiratorial, “Memsie love, would you please wake the young Master? It’s almost time for dinner.”</p><p>The elderly house-elf beamed, throwing back hunched shoulders: “With pleasure, Missy Andromeda.”</p><p> </p>
