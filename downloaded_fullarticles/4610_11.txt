<p>Ruined</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry exhaled. “I used to wonder if you were kinky.” </p>
<p>“Oh?” Draco caressed Harry’s chest, stopping to fondle his nipple. “What made you wonder?” </p>
<p>“Nothing,” Harry gasped, arching up. </p>
<p>Leaning down, Draco pressed his chest against Harry’s. “Tell me,” he whispered. </p>
<p>“It’s stupid.” </p>
<p>“I’ll decide if it’s stupid or not.” Draco scraped his teeth along Harry’s jaw. </p>
<p>Harry moaned, closing his eyes. “There were…rumours in school—”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” Draco laughed softly. “There were rumours about you, too, actually. About your…cock.” </p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Mmhm,” Draco hummed. “Ruined me for anyone else for a long time.” </p>
<p>Harry’s cock <i>flexed</i> and he groaned. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Like that, do you?” Draco sat back on his haunches, smirking. “Salazar but you’re a possessive sod.” </p>
<p>“Want to touch you,” Harry whined, shifting restlessly against the sheets. </p>
<p>“Too bad, <i>I’m</i> in control right now.” Parting Harry’s thighs, Draco eyed his cock. “Now to decide what to do with you.” </p>
<p>“Draco, please—”</p>
<p>“Should I suck you?” Draco continued as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “Or maybe I should lick your arse until you’re a screaming mess, then fuck you until you’re ruined.” </p>
<p>“Fuck,” Harry wheezed. “Please! Just…anything!” </p>
<p>“Anything?” Draco licked his lips. “Oh, Harry, never offer <i>anything</i> to a Slytherin.” </p>
