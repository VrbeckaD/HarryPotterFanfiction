    <p>“Wanna see! Wanna see!”</p><p>Aestas Scamander chuckled warmly as her oldest son, Theseus, clambered onto the bed, eager to see his new baby brother.  “Slowly Theseus, slowly now.”</p><p>Before Theseus could obey, he was lifted into the air by his Father, Viktor Scamander and gently placed next to his Mother. Shuffling closer, Theseus’s eyes were wide as his Mother gently moved the blanket to one side to reveal his new brother.</p><p>Snuffling in his sleep, the baby wriggled slightly before settling down. Tufts of reddish/brown were arranged messily on his head, which made Theseus grin. “He has hair like us Mummy!”</p><p>Aestas, who had short, curly red hair of her own, gently ran her fingers though Theseus’s messy mop, chuckling as her husband leaned in to kiss her on the cheek. </p><p>“One day…” he whispered, “… we’ll get a kid who has my hair colour.”</p><p>“Boring brown? No thank you.” She teased, tugging on a wayward lock that had escaped from his neat style to let him know that she was only teasing.</p><p>As Viktor smiled softly at her, Theseus wriggled closer, reaching out to touch the baby’s face.</p><p>“No, no, no honey…” Aestas gently scolded, “He’s sleeping right now. You don’t want to wake him up, right?”</p><p>“I wanna see his eyes!”</p><p>“You can see them when he wakes up, alright?”</p><p>Theseus scowled, crossing his arms in a sulk and opening his mouth to argue. However, before he could say anything, the baby began to whimper, eyes flickering open as tears filled his eyes.</p><p>“Oh dear, shh, shh, shh, shh….” Aestas cooed, gently rocking her youngest from side to side, “… I think you’re a little bit hungry, hmmm?”</p><p>Before she could uncover herself, Viktor quickly lifted Theseus into his arms and headed out of the room, “We’ll get dinner sorted.” He blurted out, keeping a tight hold on his oldest as Theseus wriggled.</p><p>“But I wanna stay with Mummy!”</p><p>“Mummy’s busy.”</p><p>“Doing what?”</p><p>As Aestas laughed behind them, Viktor knew that he was flushing slightly, “Stuff…. Feeding your brother.”</p><p>“Why can’t I stay.”</p><p>“…. Because I need your help? You want to help Daddy don’t you?”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>………………………………..</p><p>Around half an hour to one hour later, Viktor and Theseus made their way back into the room, a tray following them in the air behind them. Sitting up against the headboard, Aestas smiled at them. “Smells good. Soup?”</p><p>Viktor nodded, “My mother’s recipe. I feel like you might need it.”</p><p>“Oh, goodness yes.” </p><p>As Theseus was placed back on the bed, next to his mother, he was surprised when she silently gestured for him to lean back.</p><p>“Hold your arms out sweetie.” </p><p>When Theseus obeyed, he tensed up when his Mum placed the baby in his arms.</p><p>“Don’t tense up sweetie, just relax and hold your arms here…. And here.”</p><p>Glancing down, Theseus’s eyes were wide in amazement as his new brother stared up at him. Whilst his eyes were a beautiful blue, Theseus could see flickers of green around the pupil.</p><p>Satisfied that Theseus was okay with holding his brother, Aestas turned her attention to her food and her husband. “Have you fed the Hippogriffs today?”</p><p>“I was a little concerned with other things today….”</p><p>“… So, no?”</p><p>Viktor sighed, “I’ll go and do that.”</p><p>“Love you.”</p><p>“Love you too.”</p><p>Her husband rolled his eyes and beamed at her, before leaving to feed the Hippogriffs. Once she heard the back-door slam shut, Aestas ate a few more mouthfuls of soup and glanced over at her two sons.</p><p>Theseus was already besotted, a stunned grin on his face. “What’s his name Mummy?”</p><p>“Newton. Newton Artemis Fido Scamander.”</p><p>“… That’s a really long name Mummy.”</p><p>“Well me and your Daddy couldn’t decide on what to call him, so we gave him a couple of middle names.”</p><p>There was a brief silence, before Theseus turned his attention back to Newton. “I like it…”</p><p>“Good, that’s good.”</p><p>…………………………………………..</p><p>Hours later, both Theseus and Newt were settled down in bed (although Theseus did put up a slight fuss over being separated) and Viktor and Aestas practically collapsed onto their sofa.</p><p>“Artemis almost bit me…” sighed Viktor, “…. And Octavius almost knocked me out.”</p><p>“Artemis is coming into season, and Octavius is the Alpha. He wants to be the first…. He must have seen you as a threat. I’m sure I mentioned that to you.”</p><p>Viktor resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the surprised tone in his wife’s voice, “No… but never mind my darling.”</p><p>Waving his wand, he activated the newly bought gramophone, making sure to keep the volume low as it began. As a piano began to play, Viktor got to his feet and held out his hand for Aestas to take, “Would you do me the honour?”</p><p>Aestas hesitated, “I-I’m still a little…. Sore my love.”</p><p>“Then I’ll support your weight…” he smiled softly at her, “… come on.”</p><p>After some more hesitation, Aestas finally relented and let Viktor help her to her feet, smiling as he wrapped his arms around her and began to sway from side to side.</p><p>“Isn’t this our wedding song?” Aestas asked softly.”</p><p>“I believe so… where your brothers were giving me death glares.”</p><p>Aestas chuckled at this, “I think they were more concerned about their own children at that point. You should have been more worried about my Father.”</p><p>“True.”</p><p>They continued to dance for a while, before Viktor spoke up again. “Do you remember our vows?” He asked, twirling Aestas around, “In your arms, I find the courage and gather strength. No matter what, I need you with me, for now and forever. In your arms, I hide no secrets and feel no fears. My world spins and everything is right.”</p><p>Smiling softly at her husband, Aestas continued, “If today is a dream, don’t wake me. I’ve known you since we were only teenagers, making our way through life with our heads in our books, and ever since then, you’ve been my everything. There is nothing more real than this moment, being in your arms.”</p><p>Viktor beamed at his wife, twirling her around one last time as the music came to an end. “I love you…” he whispered, “… even if your hippogriffs do try and attack me from time to time.”</p><p>“They only attack occasionally!”</p><p>“Still too often!”</p><p>“Poor baby.”</p><p>“…. I love you.”</p><p>“And so you should… I love you too.”</p>
