    <p>Harry p.o.v</p><p>I frown and look at my arm again as more flowers appear. I run my finger over the new flower frowning and Ron pulls me from my thoughts. "You okay Harry?"</p><p>"Yeah." I mumble pulling down my sleeve and stare out the window.</p><p>Hermione sighs. "I know this worries you Harry but I'm sure you'll find them soon."</p><p>"And how do you know that. What. What if the flowers start to fade? What if he cuts to deep or voldimort gets him or voldimort gets me?"</p><p>"Cut your hand." Ron says shrugging. </p><p>"What?" Me and Hermione reply. </p><p>"If you cut your hand a flower will appear on the same place as your soulmate. You'll be able to easily see it." Ron explained rolling his eyes.</p><p>"That's a good idea." I reply nodding. </p><p>Ron shrugs. "I have my moments. </p><p>"You should do that." Hermione tells me.</p><p>"I should. But how? I dont have any knives and I cant just. Stab my hand in the great hall or during potions." </p><p>"Steal the knife." Ron says as he takes a bite of chocolate frog. </p><p>"Plus the knives we get in the great hall are to dull." Hermione tells harry. </p><p>"That's a weird observation." Ron tells her. </p><p>She shrugs and steals one of his beans. </p><p>"Okay then I'll steal one of the knives from potions."</p>
