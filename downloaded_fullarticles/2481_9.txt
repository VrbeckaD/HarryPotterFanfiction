  <em><strong>November 1,1981</strong> </em>
</p><p>All over Britain,witches and wizards were celebrating. The skies lit up in fireworks displays of many colors and owls flew the length and breadth of Britain. </p><p>For one man,all this meant only one thing. <em>James and Lily are dead. </em>The ratlike man with the short blond hair didn’t know it for certain,but a sinking feeling had taken over his gut. It took all his will to move from the couch when the doorbell chimed out the Gryffindor fight song,as he’d charmed it to do. </p><p>Voices drifted from the hedgerows nearby.</p><p><br/>
"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here." A woman sniffed angrily.</p><p><br/>
"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently.</p><p><br/>
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on the news. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."</p><p><br/>
"You can't blame them," said a man gently. "We've had precious little to celebrate for quite a long time."</p><p><br/>
"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors."</p><p>Peter went into the garden,a gasp escaping him.</p><p>”Professors?”</p><p>”Mr.Pettigrew! I had no idea you lived here! You should’ve told the Order!”</p><p>”I didn’t want <em>his </em>people finding out I was a double agent.”</p><p>”We’re expecting Hagrid shortly. He’s with little Harry.”</p><p>”Is it true?”</p><p>”About James,yes,but we managed to save Lily and Harry.”</p><p>”Who betrayed them? I’ll wring his neck when I see him next.“</p><p>”I suspect Lucius Malfoy’s hand in this,pretending to have abandoned the Dark Lord.</p>
