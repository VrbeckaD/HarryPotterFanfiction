    <p>Hermione gives Cobra a note to Eto telling her mother that she’s going out, and with Tyche coiled around her—Mini sleeping snuggly around the Horned Serpent’s neck—and Err’sh on her shoulders, Hermione Disapparates to the Potter Manor. With a soft pop, she reappears in front of the gates, and they instantly open for her. She starts walking towards the Potter Manor doors.</p><p>‡<em>I wonder why you were asssssigned another ssstrike misssssion ssso clossse to the ssstart of ssschool,</em>‡ Tyche hisses.</p><p>*It’s probably a small one, like a minor Death Eater or something,* Err’sh whistles.</p><p>“Regardless, I’ll just finish it quickly,” Hermione says, and she raises her hand to knock. Before she can, the door slams open, and a furious Alpha Rufus Scrimgeour shoulder checks her as he storms out. Err’sh whistles sharply at him, flaring his wings while Tyche’s hisses angrily.</p><p>“TAKE A LONG WANK AND THINK ABOUT YOUR CHOICES BEFORE I HAVE YOU BLACK-LISTED FROM ANY JOB IN THE MINISTRY!” Bella’s shrill scream echoes out from inside the Manor, her voice shaking every wall of the building. Hermione rubs her ears, and she tentatively creeps into the Manor.</p><p>She follows Bella’s yells further into the house, and soon, she hears the aggravated voice of Alpha Lily Potter and bored drawl of Professor Snape.</p><p>“—can’t just do that! Isn’t there some protocol or contract<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>you have to fill out?” Lily snaps, and Bella scoffs. Hermione pauses in the doorway, seeing Lily’s back is facing her. Professor Snape glances at her, but says nothing. She knows Bella is aware of her, but she too doesn’t say anything to her.</p><p>“I can do what I bloody please whenever I please—and that includes making you Deputy Head of the Auror Office. Wouldn’t you agree, Hermione?” Bella asks pointedly, and Lily whirls around.</p><p>“Hermione! I didn’t know you’d be here!” Lily exclaims, and Hermione tilts her head.</p><p>“You invited me to someone else’s house without telling her?” She asks Professor Snape, and he gives her a droll look.</p><p>“I did tell Lily. She merely wasn’t listening,” he drawls, and Lily blushes a little.</p><p>“I was listening Sev! Just, you can’t tell me things when I’m trying to cook!” She says indignantly, and Professor Snape just rolls his eyes.</p><p>“Anyway, Hermione, it’s lovely to see you here. Please, make yourself at home, I’ll go make us some tea,” Lily says, smiling at Hermione before she hurries away. At once, Bella and Professor Snape glare at each other.</p><p>“Shame you can’t stay Hermione, you’d make better company for Lily and Harry than this rag,” Bella hisses.</p><p>“At least I’m not a blatant squatter.” Professor Snape sneers, and he stalks away with his robes still billowing out behind him. Bella flips him the bird behind his back, then turns to Hermione.</p><p>“Here, you’ll need it for whatever hogwash <em>Sapphic Sev</em> is going to make you do,” The Alpha woman hands her a folded letter, and Tyche takes it in her mouth.</p><p>“Thanks?” Hermione tilts her head, and Bella shoos her away.</p><p>“Miss Mendonica!” Professor Snape snaps loudly down the hall, and Hermione walks to where he’s secluded himself in the shadows.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Allow me be frank, the way you delt with Maxine was too Gryffindor-like,” he drawls, and Hermione stiffens. She did quite well with her kill regardless if she can’t exactly remember it. Professor Snape narrows his eyes, and he looks down at the letter that Bella gave her. Wordlessly, he hands her a small, wrapped parcel, and she slips it into her pocket.</p><p>“Your target is a low ranking Death Eater conditioning teenage soldiers in the Amazon Rainforest. Simply discover their identity, and kill them, <em>discretely</em>. Preferably as an accident,” Professor Snape orders, and Hermione nods slowly. She’ll have to do some more hunting.</p><p>“Do I have a due date?” She asks, and he smirks.</p><p>“To be determined,” he drawls, and he looks her up and down critically. She’s wearing a loose white shirt tucked into black slacks held up with a black simple belt, and black boots.</p><p>“You all need disguises,” He sniffs, and waves his wand at her, turning shirt black. He then summons a black cloak, and he hands it over to her. Err’sh rises into the air to allow her to throw it on. Err’sh lands on her shoulder again. Professor Snape looks pointedly at her Familiars.</p><p>Hermione waves her hands over them. Err’sh transfigures into a Condor sized Raven, and Tyche transfigures into a King Cobra. Hermione waves her hand over herself, letting her magic guide her morphing. Her hair lengthens and twists into wild mass of black ringlets, her skin lightens to an alabaster tone, and her scent changes to strong citrus with honey.</p><p>“I suppose that will have to do,” Professor Snape drawls, and he hands her a Portkey. It’s a Muggle pen. Hermione flips on the hood, and she feels the pen start to vibrate.</p><p>“Try not to burn down the rainforest,” Professor Snape says, a note of apology in his voice. Before Hermione can question him about it, the Portkey takes her away.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione sucks in a breath when the heat and humidity washes over her, giving her skin the chills. She fingers the cloak, sensing the magic keeping her body still cool. Unfortunately, Err’sh does not have that protection, and he caws in annoyance. He<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>flaps to the nearest branch, trying to shake out his moisture laden feathers. Tyche hisses a mocking laughter at the Condor-now-Raven, and Err’sh claws his beak back at her.</p><p>“Behave you two,” Hermione mutters, and she looks around her. There’s nothing but tropical forest as far as the eye can see. Which, isn’t that much as the rainforest bursting with dense flora and fauna. Hermione pricks her ears, listening for any unnatural disturbances.</p><p>*Err’sh, lend me your eyes,* Hermione trills, and the Raven shakes his wings one last time, then launches himself into the air. Hermione closes her eyes, and travels down her Familiar bond with Err’sh. They both let out a little gasp when her magic connects with his eyes, and she suddenly can see what he sees.</p><p>Err’sh flies higher over the trees, his sharp eyes scanning the ground. Suddenly, he passes through a golden barrier, and red-hot runes flare to life—and Hermione’s punched out of Err’sh’s mind.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione screams in surprise and pain, stumbling back into a tree as her mental shields shudder. She can feel Err’sh panic from their bond, and Tyche presses her forehead against Hermione’s.</p><p>‡<em>Be at eassse, Sssroosss-Sssueensss-Sssirasss, [Brood-Queen-Mother,]</em>‡ Tyche hisses, and the place where her forehead gem was glows white. Instantly, the attack on her mind disappears, and Hermione lets out a ragged breath. Tyche rubs her face against Hermione’s, and Err’sh dives out of the sky onto her shoulder.</p><p>*Hermione Cage-Breaker! Are you alright?! I had no idea there was a barrier!* He caws worriedly, pulling back her hood so he can preen her hair.</p><p>*I . . . I’ll be fine, it just surprised me, that’s all,* She trills, leaning heavily against the tree, still breathing deeply. She looks down at her shirt, and the slight indent where the Locket rests. She knows Mini’s sleeping, and she won’t disturb the portrait for now. Her thoughts swirl restlessly, and then it dawns on her where she is.</p><p>“The golden castle,” She murmurs, memories of Eto, Ms. Carrow, the barrier, and that letter flashing in her mind. Eto had some blackmail on Ms. Carrow, so she might be a suspect for Hermione’s target, but the person she’s spying on might also be Hermione’s target. Either way, Eto knows something about it all, but Hermione can’t ask her about it.</p><p>If she does, she’ll have to explain her visions, and that’s something she wants to keep close to the chest. The wind shifts from being upwind for Hermione, to downwind, and suddenly they all stiffen. A single Omega scent wafts towards them, and Hermione snaps her head up.</p><p>A growl rumbles from her, and instantly fearful Omega pheromones accompained by the crashing of someone running fills the air.</p><p>“Go!” Hermione barks, and she throws herself after the Omega. Err’sh takes off back into the sky, and Tyche Slither-Syasasions away. Hermione follows the scent trail, jogging quickly after the Omega. She doesn’t want to catch them right away, since she’s hoping they’ll lead her to their base or to others waiting for the Omega.</p><p>She sniffs the humid air, and veers a little to the left. Apparently this Omega knows how to lay false scent trails. Hermione’s paitence is rewarded when she hears a shout in the distance. Picking up the pace, the tree line starts to emerge.</p><p>“Reggie! We have to go, now!” The Omega yells, her voice tinged with an Italian accent, and Hermione hears Reggie—who has an American accent—trying to calm the frantic Omega down. Suddenly, both the Omega and Reggie scream. Tyche’s triumphant hissing fills Hermione’s ears.</p><p>*There’s a lot of people here, Hermione Cage-Breaker!* Err’sh caws loudly, and Hermione looks up to see him circling high. Smirking, Hermione slows down to a stalking saunter, and she exits the tree line, her gaze fixed on the whimpering Omega and the dazed Reggie.</p><p>Gasps of horror sound around her, and Hermione pauses. Looking around, she didn’t expect there to be dozens of people in the small clearing. They all look like students having a party, as games, alcohol bottles, and food are scattered around a few mini campfires. A single sniff tells her that everyone are either Omegas or Betas.</p><p>“W-who are you?” Reggie asks, squinting at Hermione. She’s holding her head, and Hermione stares at her in shock. The Beta is slim and curvy, with long dark-brown, blond streaked hair. It’s in a low ponytail down to her waist. Her eyes are intriguing, both blue, but left one is blind.</p><p>She’s also one of the girls Hermione saved from the Werewolf pack when they were under Fenrir’s leadership.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione ignores Reggie, and turns her attention to the Omega that Tyche has coiled around tightly. Her Familiar rolls the Omega on her back, and Hermione blinks. She too, is another one of those girls Hermione saved. The Omega’s short, and her head would probably only come up to Hermione’s shoulder.</p><p>Her black hair is pulled back in a ponytail, showing off her biracial Italian-Portuguese features. The Omega stares at her in terror, her soft, dark-brown widening. A tingle scratches weakly at Hermione’s mental shields. Breaking their stare, Hermione blinks away the weak <em>Legilimency</em> attempt.</p><p>So the Omega can also cast wordless, powerful spells it seems. Hermione’s target would probably want to condition this one, or maybe, they already have. The fact she was spying on Hermione adds to her theory that the Omega may already be with her target.</p><p>“Hey, let her go, okay?” Reggie demands, crouching slowly. A few of the closer Omegas are edging closer to her, and Hermione feels a wary thrill start to pump through her.</p><p>“No,” Hermione drawls, and she snaps her fingers. Tyche <em>Slither-Syasasions</em> away with her catch, and Hermione Disapparates before Reggie can lunge at her.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione Apparates back where the Portkey dropped her off, and Tyche reappears a second later. The Omega starts squirming, taking a to scream, but Tyche quickly wraps herself around the Omega’s mouth. Hermione crouches over the Omega, avoiding direct eye contact with her.</p><p>She feels Err’sh sending a question through their bond, and she sends a mental picture of the five girls she saved. She senses him flying away, searching for to find if the other three girls are here. She waves her fingers, and silencing and illusion wards spring up around them.</p><p>*Mini, wake up.* Hermione orders in Twishity, and the Locket shudders groggily. It floats from under her shirt, and the lid snaps open. The portrait stretches, covering her mouth as she yawns.</p><p>‡<em>What’d I misssss?</em>‡ She hisses.</p><p>*You are going to make sure the Omega stays here, silently, and unseen,* Hermione replies, and Mini frowns at the Avian language. Hermione doesn’t want to reveal she’s a Parseltongue in front of a complete stranger after all. She lifting the Locket’s chain over her head. Mini frowns, and crosses her arms.</p><p>‡<em>Ssso I’m reduccced to babysssitting? You know ssshe won’t be able to underssstand me!</em>‡ The Locket hisses grumpily, and Hermione shrugs. She lowers the chain around the Omega’s neck, and Tyche uncoils from her.</p><p>‡<em>Can I at leassst mess with her a bit?</em>‡ Mini hisses hopefully, and she shrinks the chain length so the Locket becomes a chocker. The Omega grabs at the chain, but a raised eyebrow from Hermione has the Omega freezing.</p><p>*No, not today,* Hermione chirps, and Mini sighs.</p><p>‡<em>You usssed to be ssso fun, sssweetie,</em>‡ Mini hisses, and slumps against the sides of her portrait. Hermione rolls her eyes, and Tyche slithers up her arm to rest along her shoulders.</p><p>“W-w-what are you going to do?” The Omega whimpers, her English words heavy tinged with her thick Italian accent. She flinches when Hermione grips her jaw, forcing the Omega to face her. Hermione releases a short burst of her Alfā pheromones to grab the floundering Omega’s attention. The Omega sucks in a sharp breath, and her eyes snap up to Hermione’s.</p><p>“<strong>You are going to tell me your name.</strong>”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The Omega just stares at her, confusion leaking into her features.</p><p>“<strong>You speak Italian?</strong>” She states her words almost like a question. Hermione ignores the statement, and raising an eyebrow at the Omega. A hint of fear creeps along the Omega’s face the longer their stare continues, and she lowers her eyes.</p><p>“<strong>Er—Omega Jodi Stratten,</strong>” Jodi mumbles.</p><p>“<strong>Okay, Stratten, I’m aware that our situation isn’t quite the best, but I’m just going to ask you a few simple questions, and then I’ll let you go on your merry way,</strong>” Hermione drawls, and the Omega narrows her eyes distrustfully.</p><p>“<strong>What was the party for?</strong>” Hermione asks, and the Omega takes a few seconds before she answers.</p><p>“<strong>It’s the the before school get-together.</strong>”</p><p>“<strong>Any reason why there weren’t any Alphas?</strong>”</p><p>Now Jodi looks really confused.</p><p>“<strong>Uh, there weren’t any invited,</strong>” The Omegas says, and Hermione tilts her head at that. A party full of Omegas and Betas is a perfect hunting ground for conditioning soldiers. The fact that no Alphas are invited just adds to the temptation for her target.</p><p>“<strong>Why?</strong>” Hermione demands, and she catches a flicker of annoyance flashes across her eyes.</p><p>“<strong>We’re in Brazil,</strong>” Jodi says, an unsaid “<em>duh</em>” hanging in the air after her reply. Hermione leans back, deep in thought. She never contemplated that other countries might have a different population of Presentations. If the staggering amount of Omegas and Betas in the crowd is any indication, there is a significant decrease in Alpha numbers in Brazil.</p><p>“<strong>How many Al—</strong>”</p><p>A large blast of powerful Omega pheromones sends Hermione rolling backwards, Tyche hissing sharply in surprise, and Jodi lets out a pained and frustrated howl. Hermione leaps to her feet, and Tyche launches at the thrashing Omega. Jodi claws at the Locket’s chain, which is now deeply embedded around her neck, choking her.</p><p>Tyche coils up the Omega’s body, pinning her down. Hermione shakes herself, her body still tingling from the power and force of the Omega’s pheromones. She stalks forwards, simply watching as Jodi’s face starts to turn red from lack of oxygen.</p><p>“Let her breathe.”</p><p>At Hermione’s order, Mini hisses tersely.</p><p>‡<em>Fine, but if ssshe atttacksss you again, I’m going to really strangle her.</em>‡</p><p>Mini reluctantly loosens the Locket’s chain, and Jodi gasps in lungfuls of fresh air.</p><p>‡<em>I can bite her,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sssroosss-Sssueensss-Sssirasss, [Brood-Queen-Mother], jussst a nibble, and then ssshe ssshall sssee what real pain isss,</em>‡ Tyche hisses, her eyes shining at the possibility and she flicks her tongue slowly. Hermione tilts her head, and then shakes it. Tyche’s venom is too potent, and Hermione doesn’t want to kill the Omega.</p><p>This is supposed to be a discrete mission, although, that was thrown out of the bag when all those Omegas and Betas saw her kidnap Jodi.</p><p>‡<em>Knock her out, Mini,</em>‡ Hermione hisses, and Mini sighs.</p><p>‡<em>A little ‘pleassse’ wouldn’t hurt,</em>‡ The Locket hisses, but it releases a puff of magic. Jodi gags on it, but instantly slumps to the ground, unconscious.</p><p>“This was an utter clusterfuck,” Hermione growls under her breath, and snaps her fingers at Jodi, mentally casting an <em>Obliviate</em> at the Omega. She takes the Locket off Jodi, and the chain lengthens once more to its normal size.</p><p>‡<em>What are we going to do with her now?</em>‡ Mini hisses, bored already.</p><p>‡<em>Nothing. When her friendsss find her, it will be asss if Jodi jussst had a bad dream,</em>‡ Hermione hisses, and lowers her wards. Mini shrugs, and then yawns.</p><p>‡<em>Alright, I’m going to take a quick nap again, I’m tired,</em>‡ Mini turns her back to Hermione, and the Locket lip snaps shut. Tyche flicks her tongue at it childishly.</p><p>‡<em>Lazzzy thing,</em>‡ she hisses. Hermione taps her nose, and then starts walking towards where she felt that barrier.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione and Tyche keep a sharp eye out for anything unusual as they slowly walk through the forest. Behind that barrier might be her target’s base, or anything really, but she knows that whenever someone puts up a barrier, they’re keeping something hidden. Tyche lifts her head to the sky, and flicks her tongue.</p><p>Soon enough, Err’sh circles low over the trees, cawing softly down at her.</p><p>*I could only find one of the three, Hermione Cage-Breaker.*</p><p>Hermione nods, and holds up her arm for Err’sh to land on.</p><p>*Can you find the barrier again?* She tweets, and he nods. Flapping, he soars above her. To pass the time while she waits, Hermione takes out Bella’s letter. Leaning against a tree, she unfolds the parchment, and starts to read.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>You owe me a bloody explanation, killing for the Order of Chickens. Anyway, I’m only doing this because Sev now is in my debt.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You new name is Alpha Mia Val Mendonica. For the love of Merlin, remember that. Your hellish, dysfunctional family consists of your birth mother, Alpha Vyvian Mendonica, your other mother, a French Veela, and one of your many cousins is Alpha Hermione Mendonica.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You lived in Britain for your whole inconsequential life with Vyvian. You attended Hogwarts, and you were Sorted into Hufflepuff. You want to become a Magizoologist for some bloody reason. One of your life goals is to make a spell to help Maledictus control their blood curse since your best friend is a Maledictus (yes I know about her since she had to withdraw from Hogwarts). You also use a damn wand to cast magic, since wandless casting is Hermione’s signature move.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Don’t bloody fucking die because of Sev, or I’ll resurrect your corpse and kill you again.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Bella</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione’s eyes widen, and she has to reread the ornery Alpha woman’s letter. Burning the letter with her Cursed Fire, she sighs as she realizes now that her mission won’t be a quick in and out jaunt. Hermione takes out Professor Snape’s small parcel, and carefully unwraps it. As soon as she does, the small parcel suddenly swells, popping back into what was its original, much larger form.</p><p>She sits down to open the box, lying it on her lap. Tyche watches on, intrigued. Inside the parcel, is a worn textbook, and a bundle of clothes. Hermione picks up the textbook, scanning it’s title. Opening it, she flips through Professor Snape’s personal copy of the Advanced Potion-Making by Alpha Libatius Borage.</p><p>There’s numerous scribbled annotations throughout the entire book, with entire pages crossed out, and rewritten instructions on the side.</p><p>The bundle of clothes, Hermione finds, look suspiciously like pieces for an uniform set. Three sets of plain, bright green robes with a brown, white, and grey trim respectively are folded together neatly over the five sets of black waistcoats. Five sets of skirts of either green or brown colors are paired to five sets of thin, black shorts.</p><p>Presumably to go under the skirts.</p><p>Then there’s a long, thin, dark green cloak with gold fastenings. On the front, a little tag with her cover name gleams with a clean, glossy shine. Hermione stares at the uniform, and then groans as she realizes what she was manipulated into accepting.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>     — . —</p><p>Legilimens = Legilimency Spell 2x</p><p>Obliviate = Memory Charm</p>
