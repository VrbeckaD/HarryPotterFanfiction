  <em> <strong>Jeremy’s P.O.V.</strong> </em>
</p><p align="justify">Who would’ve thought Jeremy Heere was going to Hogwarts with his best friend, Michael Mell? No one, that’s who. At least not Jeremy. And definitely not Michael, his moms being muggles and all.</p><p>Yet here they were. Hogwarts. School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Or at least the train. But they were at the very least going to Hogwarts, which is an adventure on its own. Jeremy’s mom told him all about it, the spirits and houses and the food. She gushed about the food a lot. With the snacks on the train, he could tell why.</p><p>“Jeremy,” Michael said from the other seat. It was just the two of them in the compartment, which was totally, completely, absolutely fine. “What are you most excited about?”</p><p>“The food,” Jeremy said. “My mom has told me all about it, and she says it’s great.”</p><p>Michael nodded. “Do you think it’s anything like my moms cooking?”</p><p>Jeremy looked out the window, at the passing fields and animals. “Nah. Rosé makes really good sandwiches. And from what I know, wizards don’t settle for plain old sandwiches. It’s all or nothing.”</p><p>Michael smiled as someone knocked on their compartment door. Jeremy stood up and opened it to see a girl with black hair in a ponytail. She had her bag and wasn’t wearing her robes yet, but it was also the first five minutes of the ride and no one was in their robes.</p><p>“Uh, hi?” Jeremy said–asked. What a great conversationalist he was, huh?</p><p>The girl gave a small wave. “Hi, I’m Christine. Is this compartment open?”</p><p>Jeremy nodded and moved out the way. “Y-Yeah, it’s open. I’m Jeremy and t-this is-”</p><p>“Michael at your service,” Michael supplied. Jeremy shot him a grateful look and Michael nodded. They’ve been saving each other from embarrassment since third grade. This was a common occurrence.</p><p>The girl–Christine–smiled and walked inside. She sat down next to Jeremy’s spot. Well, this should be fun. “What are your families like? Both of my parents are non-wizards. I heard someone refer to them as Muggles? I don’t know if that’s a derogatory term or not, though. I hope not.”</p><p>Michael shot Jeremy a confused look. Michael was from one of the “non-wizard” families. Jeremy, on the other hand…</p><p>Jeremy shook his head. “N-no, no. Muggle just m-means non-wizard. There i-i-is a derogatory term, though. Muggle isn’t, um, isn’t it.”</p><p>Christine nodded her head and perked up at the sound of wheels in the hall. The snack-cart-thing rolled up and the lady pushing it smiled sweetly. “Hello, darlings. Would you like anything?” </p><p>Michael smiled wide and Christine furrowed her eyebrows. “I don’t have anything to buy with.”</p><p>Jeremy reassuringly/awkwardly patted her shoulder. “I can b-buy something.”</p><p>He stood up and took out a small bag filled with Knuts, Sickles and Galleons. Jeremy pointed out a few of the candies, the ones he recognized from when his mom brought them, and paid with the correct amount of coins.</p><p>When the snack-cart-thing lady rolled off, Jeremy sat down and revealed what he had gotten. Michael and Christine both gawked at the sweets. Christine looked up and smiled wide. “This looks so freaking cool!”</p><p>Michael nodded furiously, smiling wide as well. “Hell yeah, it does! Hey, Jere, how come you know all this stuff again?” </p><p>Jeremy blushed. “I, uh. My m-mom is a wizard, completely. She, uh, she’s a healer in a wizard hospital.”</p><p>Jeremy thought about all the times his mom was called in to help someone with a dragon burn or missing bones in the middle of the night. It was a time-consuming job, for sure. Sometimes Jeremy wished it wasn’t.</p><p>Christine grabbed a chocolate frog and opened it. She jumped back when the frog jumped at her face. “HOLY GUACAMOLE, ITS A MAGIC CHOCOLATE.”</p><p>Jeremy laughed. “Y-Yeah, chocolate frogs do that sometimes. Or, uh, usually. But really it’s the, uh, it’s the card you want.”</p><p>Jeremy took the container and took out the card. “Uh, ‘Circe’. I’ve already got t-two of her at home.”</p><p>Card Circe scoffed–non-audibly, of course, she’s inside a card–and left the card. Michael grabbed a chocolate frog and opened it with more success than Christine. </p><p>As Michael ate the frog, he took out the card. “‘Uric the Oddball’. Why’s he an oddball?”</p><p>Jeremy furrowed his eyebrows as he tossed Christine some Bertie Bott’s. “I dunno. M-Maybe we’ll learn about it? We did have to get a, uh, history book.” </p><p>Christine nodded and ate a yellow jelly bean. She immediately spat it out. “Ewwwww, this is disgusting.”</p><p>Michael grabbed his own jelly bean, this one green, and ate it. He frowned. “No, this one tastes like apple.”</p><p>Jeremy revealed the entire name. “‘Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans’. And by every f-flavor, they mean every flavor. Er, cherry, ear wax, um, chocolate, pepper. They got it a-all.”</p><p>Michael and Christine has opposite reactions. Michael smiled wide and grabbed his own box. Christine scrunched up her nose and pushed away the boxes closest to her. “That’s gross. Let’s continue onto something else. What house do you want to be in most?” </p><p>Michael furrowed his eyebrows. “House?”</p><p>Jeremy grabbed a cauldron cake. “Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. In g-general, Gryffindor is for the brave, Slytherin is for the ambitious, Ravenclaw is f-for the wise and Hufflepuff is for the loyal.”</p><p>Christine nodded. “Yep. I read that in one of the books. And apparently, all the ‘bad guys’–she made air quotes around those two words–are from Slytherin. The ‘good guys’–more air quotes–are from Gryffindor. And in the book, Ravenclaw is for the smarts and nothing else. Hufflepuff is for the ‘losers’.” Air quotes. </p><p>Michael nodded and frowned. He threw another jelly bean in his mouth. “Well, Gryffindor sounds like an absolute handful. Don’t want to be in there. I guess Ravenclaw?”</p><p>Jeremy thought a bit. “Yeah, that s-sounds like you, Michael. I would want to be in G-Gryffindor, though. Not that I’m particularly b-brave or anything.”</p><p>Christine kicked her legs against the chair. She didn’t seem to want anything else from the snack pile. “Actually, I think Hufflepuff would be nice. Even if it is under appreciated, it sounds like a good thing, and I like to think of myself as loyal.”</p><p>Jeremy opened his mouth as a voice reverberated throughout the train. “We are reaching Hogwarts in ten minutes!”</p><p>A guy about a foot taller than the three of them slid the door open. He was already wearing his robes. “You guys should change. And no, it does not involve undressing. It’s the first day. Just put on the robe and make sure it’s buttoned well.”</p><p>He walked away and slid the door shut. The three looked at each other. That was that, then.</p><p>Jeremy took out his case and took out his robe. Hopefully it didn’t shrink in the month he’s had it. Knowing Jeremy, though, it probably did.</p><p>He put it on and fumbled with the one button. Really, just one button. And he couldn’t even do that. It didn’t help that he was left-handed and these robes were a great example of forgetting that left-handed people exist. Just dandy. </p><p>Christine went to help Jeremy with the one (one!) button before realizing what she was doing. She blushed and sat back down. Jeremy blushed as well and finally buttoned his robe. </p><p>Michael gave Jeremy “that look” and put on his own robe with considerably less struggle than Jeremy. Christine did as well. Show-offs.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>As the train slowed to a stop, Jeremy, Michael and Christine shoveled the candy into the inner pockets of their robes. Those were expensive as a car for twelve year olds.</p><p>A extremely tall, wide and bushy man with a lantern called out for the first years. The three made their way to him. It was harder than it should’ve been. But that’s what happens when there are hundreds of kids milling around, it’s raining, and the sun had already set.</p><p>As they reached the man, Jeremy overheard him introduce himself as Hagrid. Wasn’t any weirder than the last name “Heere.” Probably a wizard thing, having weird names. That would explain a lot, actually.</p><p>The crowd of first years made their way to the lake. Were they going to swim? He wasn’t going to ask. Another kid asked for him, anyway.</p><p>“We’re not going to swim across the lake, right,” she said. It wasn’t phrased like a question. More like a demand. “Because it’s cold and it’s late, and I don’t want hypothermia.</p><p>Jeremy looked around a cluster of students to see exactly who was talking. It was a girl, which he already knew because of the voice, with brown hair held back with a headband. Now this was a scary kid. She held the air of someone who ordered others around, but did nothing herself. Not the type of person Jeremy hung out with or wanted to.</p><p>Michael elbowed Jeremy’s side. “I sure hope I’m not in the same house as her. She’d probably make me do her homework and feed me to a raccoon when I refused. Which I wouldn’t, by the way. She’s scary.”</p><p>Christine nodded as Hagrid responded to the girl. “I see yer not one ter wait a’ound, eh? No, we’re takin’ some boats. Too ma’y things in te lake that’ll kill ya if yer not carefu’.”</p><p>The girl gave a curt nod and turned back to the mini flock (read: cult) she already started. Christine whispered to them, “I hope she doesn’t treat everyone like that. She’ll just get in trouble.”</p><p>Jeremy knew she was wrong, but didn’t say anything. The girl obviously came from a family from money. Elementary kids with the huge houses would act the same way. She probably always got what she wanted.</p><p>The three made their way to a boat. Even if they didn’t have to swim, they were still only twelve. No upper body strength there, so they couldn’t row the boat.</p><p>Except, Jeremy was the only one with that problem, apparently. Besides someone else two boats away, everyone seemed perfectly capable of rowing to the castle. And even though Jeremy <em> wanted </em>to help, he physically couldn’t. Stupid scrawny Jeremy arms.</p><p>As Michael and Christine rowed the boat, Jeremy looked around and took in the view. The castle loomed over them and had too many towers to count. Every once in a while, silver figures would come to the surface of the lake before disappearing again. And were those people riding horses near the forest?</p><p>Whatever they were, they had reached the castle shores. Jeremy stumbled out, because of course he did. Christine held back a smile and Michael held back a laugh. Jeremy stuck out his tongue at them before turning towards the castle.</p><p>“A beau’y, is’t she?” Hagrid said wistfully from behind Jeremy, who turned around. “I reme’ber te fir’t time I came here like yeste’day. Dumb’edore, now he’s a good man.”</p><p>And then louder, “Come on! We ‘aven’t got all day.”</p>
