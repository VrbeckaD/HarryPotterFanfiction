    <p>I.</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Dursley of Number 6, Westminster Lane, Harrogate Hill, was proud to say that she were perfectly normal, thank you very much. </p><p> </p><p>Petunia Dursley was a thin woman with twice the usual amount of neck that came in handy when she peered over the back fence to spy upon the neighbours. Mrs. Dursley had long coppery brown hair and hazel eyes and was always attired in a neatly pressed dress of a pale blue or green. </p><p> </p><p>Petunia also had a son and thought that there was no finer boy anywhere. Dudley Dursley was a large beefy boy with thick blonde hair and very little neck. Dudley was in his final year of schooling at Smeltings High School and had an internship with Grunnings, a large firm that made drills.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia was immensely proud of her son but couldn't bare the thought if anyone at all found out about her most closely guarded secret:</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter.</p><p> </p><p>The Potter boy was a month younger than her own beloved son, Dudley but was not nearly so well mannered or kind and Petunia Dursley dreaded the thought that one day, one of those types might knock on her door and ask her about him.</p><p> </p><p>The day her beloved Vernon had died still haunted her worst memories. It had been a bright, summery day filled with airy golden light that made the very air seem to sing with joy - for it had been her Dudder’s tenth birthday and there was no better day in Petunia Dursley’s calendar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The Potter boy, as was custom, had been making her beloved family’s breakfast - a decent spread of fried eggs, hash browns, fried tomatoes, proper English pork sausages, short-cut bacon, and beans. In between the mutinous glaring of the Potter boy at Dudley in jealousy, who had been counting his thirty-nine presents and exclaiming about it being his biggest haul yet - and Vernon who had been delighting over Dudley’s growth and strength now he was ten - and Petunia’s own tearful exclamations over her baby boy being all grown up… something had gone terribly wrong.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia remembers that Vernon had roared in rage, but whether that had happened before or after that Potter boy had snapped and started to stab his Uncle five times in the chest with a kitchen knife. Petunia also remembers how Dudley had screamed - screams that still echoed loudly in her ear at night in the dark of her dreaming - and how her baby boy had all but tried to climb out of the window in his fear and had been too large to manage. Petunia also remembers slamming a sticky hot fry pan still greasy with pig fat from the sausages into her ugly little nephews shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>She still bore muscle deep scars from the heat of the fry pan on her hands. On days when was cold or she’d been doing a lot of gardening, those scars ached in a way that suggested that such a bone deep ache would only get worse the older she got.</p><p> </p><p>Standing in front of the window of her kitchen, overlooking the grey buildings of East London, Petunia Dursley hoped that she never would see her evil little nephew ever again - those big, dark, green eyes haunted her and she swore she could see them in the reflection of the window glass in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Returning to the washing up of this mornings dishes, Petunia fought against the shiver that wanted to crawl down her spine in remembered horror.</p>
