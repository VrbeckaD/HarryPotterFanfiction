  <u>Alpha, Beta and Omega Explained</u>
</p><p>Alpha: Dominant, not necessarily mean or controlling, can be male or female, 75% male, 25% female, ruts (extreme sex drive towards mate)<br/>
Beta: Normal, no heats or ruts, will always submit to an alpha by showing neck<br/>
Omega: Very submissive in the bedroom, not necessarily outside but can be, male or female, 50\50 split, heats (draws in an alpha to mate with)</p><p>A male omega's mate will always be a male alpha. A female omega will go for an alpha or beta of either gender but normally will go for male. A beta will go for either another beta or a female omega, no beta/alpha relationships known. An alpha will not ever go for a beta.</p><p>After the first mating in a beta/omega couple the omega will take the beta's surname, in an alpha/omega couple the omega will take the alpha's surname. In a beta/beta couple no surname change will occur.</p><p>
  <u>Platonic Mates Explained</u>
</p><p>Alpha a and omega a are mates. Alpha b and omega b are mates. Alpha a and omega b are platonic mates. Alpha b and omega a are platonic mates.</p><p>A platonic mateship is formed in one of two ways:<br/>
An alpha and omega not having mates yet (they've not been found/even born yet) or an alpha helping an omega (visa versa) who's mate is not there at the time.</p><p>Platonic mates will also help each other out on heats/ruts (respectively). Alpha a and alpha b have a very strong trust bond as they trust each other with their omegas.</p><p>A platonic mateship can be formed before one of the participants has presented as an alpha or omega. Having a platonic mate runs in families and is not yet know in muggles. There is three families where it is most common. Those are the families: Potter, Black and Malfoy.</p><p>Lets look at some examples then we'll get to the story.<br/>
James Potter (alpha a), Lily Potter {nèe Evans} (omega a), Remus Lupin (alpha b) and Sirius Lupin {nèe Black} (omega b).<br/>
Lucius Malfoy (alpha a), Draco Malfoy (omega a), Harry Potter (alpha b) and Severus Snape (omega b).</p>
