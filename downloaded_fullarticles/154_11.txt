    <p>The twelve year old groaned as he gripped his suitcase harder, playing with his necklace of the Deathly Hallows.<br/>
“Remember now dear, aunt Helen,” his mother said, the boy mouthed ‘more like Helllen’ quietly. “will take good care of you during the summer. It is fortunate that she agreed to house you, so be grateful,” his mother continued. </p><p>“Why can’t I just go to France with you and father?” the little boy complained for the fourth time that morning. His mother straightened his robes and held him by the shoulders, kissing him on the cheek.</p><p>“You’ll be fine, Draco. You will be back before you know it!” With a pat on the back and a masterful fake smile his mother shooed him into the fire place. “Now come on, America is waiting for you!” Draco groaned once more before he took some floo powder and sternly said “Oregon floo connection,” The next thing he knew he was stumbling out of a fireplace in a different country. </p><p>The building he was in was empty and old, not many wizards lived in Oregon. Draco had been excited to return home after his second year at Hogwarts only to be told that he was going to live with his stuck up aunt. He had protested so much that his voice was hoarse for days on end but nothing had stopped his parents.<br/>
His aunt was horrible, he had stayed with her once before. She didn’t let him do anything except reading or studying the whole time! She herself had practically avoided him as the plague, not that he minded that at least. But he wanted to do something this summer, not be stuck inside all the time! For Merlin's sake he was in another country, there was so much he could do! And to add salt on the wound his parents were going to France, doing all the things you can do there. </p><p>Outside the door Draco could see a person with the Malfoy symbol on their robes, probably the servant that was sent to take him to Helen. The old goat couldn’t even pick him up herself. He glanced at the coins in his pocket and slowly a plan started to form.<br/>
Outside this building was a muggle town, the building itself was protected with magic. His aunt wouldn’t be able to find him in the muggle world! He could run away, don’t go to his aunt, get her in trouble and all he had to do was exchange his money for muggle ones. He had enough for the summer on him, right? His mother made sure he always had a fortune on him in case he got into trouble, ... again. That’s a story not quite right for the moment.</p><p>Draco began stalking over to the bored looking man, tired too, probably by working for Helen Malfoy. Draco stopped before the man and held a hand up to stop him when the man was about to speak.<br/>
“Do you have muggle money?” Draco asked. The man gave him a funny look and nodded. “Can I exchange some with you for wizard money, like, right now?”</p><p>“Why, you won’t be needing muggle money at Ms Malfoy’s abode,” </p><p>“Well to be honest I would rather be at Mrs Malfoy’s abode,” Draco snapped at him. “But I can’t because mother wants to be alone with father. So instead I have decided to run away to the muggle world for the summer!” He proudly exclaimed, a fist to his chest and big grin covering his face. </p><p>“Do you have a fever or something?” The man asked, clearly concerned for the child’s mental state. Though he quickly flashed back in his memory on how emotionless and cold Helen was all the time, running away from her would be a dream come true for anyone. “No never mind, we can go to the cash machine around here and i can take some money out, how much do you have on you?” </p><p>“I have about 1000 Galleons,” Draco said, pulling out his enchanted bag of coins. They started to walk towards the cash machine and the man smiled. </p><p>“That would be around $4800, give or take a few,” </p><p>The rest of the process went smoothly. The man pulled out his own bag and Draco dumped all of his money into it. Then he put the dollars he got into his now empty bag. The man pointed towards a bus station close by he could wait at if he wanted further away from here. Exchanging goodbyes the man apparated away leaving Draco alone.<br/>
“Finally, I can- uh, wait ... what do I do now?” The question was met with complete silence.<br/>
“Running away is harder than I thought,”</p><p> </p><p>Draco whistled an unfamiliar tune while he leaned against the bus sign. His luggage was laying discarded on the ground and Draco’s robe was thrown away. Muggles didn’t wear robes. His white dress shirt and black pants weren’t any better but he didn’t have any muggle clothes and these were the closest things to it at least.<br/>
Draco stopped whistling when he saw a bus coming towards him, he quickly pulled a few dollars out of his bag and picked his suitcase up again. He had absolutely no idea how much money he should give or where he was going to jump off but he could improvise if need be. </p><p>The bus stopped in front of him and the doors opened automatically making the little wizard jerk back. He stood there for a while before he carefully stepped onto the bus. He had never rode in a wizard bus before much less likely a muggle one. He gave the bus driver four twenties nervously, “Keep the change,” he said, hoping it was either enough or too much money. </p><p>“I wouldn’t know what’s change, prob’ need to know where you going first, lad?” the bus driver said making Draco blush in embarrassment. He didn't know where he was going to go. Well he didn't even know what places there were close by.<br/>
He nervously looked into the bus and saw only one passenger there, a young girl around his age with brown hair. She smiled at him when she noticed that he was staring.</p><p>"I'll just go wherever she's going," Draco said, pointing at the muggle girl to the bus driver. The man nodded and gave him back three twenties, </p><p>"Gravity Falls then, laddie," he grumbled out. Draco nodded and walked passed him. The girl was practically jumping in her seat and wildly gesturing for him to sit next to her. She looked silly and goofy, definitely not someone the Slytherin would associate with normally, but he didn't know anything about Gravity Falls. Not even when he was arriving there. The girl would probably know a little more.<br/>
He slowly sat down in the seat next to her and she squealed in excitement.<br/>
There was a weird silence between them for a good few minutes before the girl held her hand out.</p><p>"I'm Mabel," the girl said, smiling. Draco noticed that the girl had weird metal things in her mouth. He switched from looking at her teeth and outstretched hand before reluctantly grabbing and shaking it. </p><p>"I'm Draco Malfoy, it's a, uh, pleasure to meet you Mabel," he said as politely as he could manage. She squealed once more making Draco wince.<br/>
“Well either way, I may have listened in on your conversation with the bus driver,” Mabel said so quickly that it took Draco some time to realise what she had said. “and, are you running away or something?” </p><p>“Is it that obvious?” Draco asked. Mabel poked his puffed cheeks and nodded. </p><p>She somehow looked even more excited now and Draco raised an eyebrow at her. “WELL, that’s great!” the girl said and Draco wondered if all muggles had no sanity or if it was just this girl. Suddenly the girl stopped and stroked her chin in though, “Wait you do have nowhere to go right?” she questioned and Draco nodded in confirmation. “Yes!”  Mabel said, back to being excited. </p><p>“What- Why’s that good?” he asked, more confused the more he interacted with the muggle. </p><p>“Well my parents sent me to live with my uncle in Gravity Falls for the summer and I’ll be all alone. And what is this,” she said gesturing between them, “A homeless guy my age,” Draco tried to protest at that remark, “-just so happens to go to Gravity Falls too- This must be the beginning of something. You have nowhere to stay and I have, probably, a place to stay, we should totes’ live together during the summer!”  She finished. And was it just Draco or did she just become one hundred more times confusing. </p><p>“I don’t think your uncle would want two kids to take care of,” </p><p>“No he wouldn’t mind, he’s going to take care of me isn’t he?”</p><p>“That’s different, you’re his niece and I’m just a stranger,” </p><p>That got mabel thinking at least. The girl looked sad and in deep thought for so long that Draco though she would finally be quiet for good, but then she brightened up once more. “He barely remembers me, and my parents didn’t talk much about me to him sooo why don’t you just pretend to be my brother! He’s old, I don’t think he would know if he didn’t have a nephew or not,” </p><p>Draco had to admit that the plan at least matched her personality, ‘weird with a dose of extra ‘what is this?!’ on the side’.<br/>
“We look almost nothing alike,” he settled on instead of ranting about how impossible it would be to fake a close family member. He had tried that, twice. Mabel shook her head in disagreement. </p><p>“We’re the same height, we both have adorable round faces and one of my parents have grey eyes so your eye colour is no probs,” </p><p>Draco tugged a little on his hair, “One of your parents doesn't happen to have blond hair too?” he sneered.</p><p>“No, but-” Mabel opened her bag of stuff and started to rummage through it eventually pulling out a tube of something. “-I have hair dye!!” She started to look him up and down and then added, “You need it, you’re too pale. White skin, white hair, light eyes,” she suddenly gasped, “Are you a vampire?!” she questioned. </p><p>“No, and why do you even have hair dye?” </p><p>“I wanted to dye my hair during the summer,” she explained. “But they would notice if I came home with pink hair so I bought hair dye in my own hair colour!” She pulled out a water bottle and smiled at him. “Now come on, I wanna dye your hair!” </p><p> </p><p>Dyeing hair inside of a bus with only one water bottle and two twelve year olds proved to be very hard. The hair looked fine, it just needed to dry, all Draco’s hair gel had though been washed away so now it was almost as fluffy as Mabel’s. The shirt and the seat were the worst though. His shirt was wet and stained brown and so was the previous seats they had occupied, they had to move after they were done because of the damage. Mabel’s own sweater was stainless though and Draco was quietly wondering how she had managed that.<br/>
His shirt was left on the stained seats and Mabel had let him borrow a yellow sweater with a watermelon on it, green shorts and a bandage on his knee from having been knocked to the floor when Mabel had poured ice cold water onto his head. </p><p>They were talking and Draco found that, for a muggle, she wasn’t that bad. “Should I be calling you by your name or by sister?” </p><p>“Whatever is fine, though I don’t want to call you Draco, it sound all stuffy and fancy,” Mabel said and before Draco could rebuke that his name was fine thank you she continued, “And it is not a Pines name, mum would never name a kid Draco,” </p><p>“So what name should I have then?” </p><p>“Uhh, well dad wanted a son to name Mason, so I guess your name can be that,” </p><p>“It doesn’t suit me,”</p><p>“You can have a nickname then,”</p><p>“Draco-”</p><p>“No,”<br/>
Draco sighed and wondered what nickname he then would use before suddenly remembering Pansy’s name for him, “Dray?” he asked and Mabel brightened. </p><p>“That’ll work, you can be Dray-Drop!” His sister agreed and Draco smiled to himself. </p><p>'This summer might be quite fun after all' he though, playing with the sleeve of the soft sweater he wore.</p>
